Saturnalia's sole and rare (less so after its 2003 CD reissue) album was on the ostentatious side of early progressive rock, perhaps slightly anticipating some of the earnest classical-rock-fusion-with-female-vocals explored by Renaissance in the 1970s. The songs tend toward the winding and ponderous side, and the vocals -- especially those by female singer Aletta -- can cross into the histrionic in the more strident passages. Perhaps a little more influenced by the male-female vocal tradeoffs typical of some late-'60s American psychedelic bands than most such British efforts, it also boasts plenty of hard rock guitar and a good helping of lyrics reflective of a fantasy world, Ã  la "Princess and the Peasant Boy" and the title track. As the song that brings in the strongest British acoustic folk feel, "Dream" is one of the more palatable tracks, but groups such as Renaissance were able to craft more accessible and memorable material using some of the same elements
