,jc4321234,2013-01-09T10:53Z,The episode that I have labeled S11E04 is actually S11E05.  
,jc4321234,2013-01-09T10:54Z,And the one that I have labeled as S11E03 is actually S11E04.  
,djt067,2013-01-09T11:34Z,there still seems to be a gap between your last upload ep4 and the tv team ep6. but not the end of the world. chrs...
,jc4321234,2013-01-09T12:29Z,"That's just not possible.  At the start of each episode it tells you what day it is in the house. At the beginning of the vid labeled ""S11E04"" it says ""Day 4"" in the house and its nomination day. Watch the beginning of S11E06 that is ""Day 5"" in the house and its the day after the nominations. That's why S11E04 needs to be relabeled as S11E05.  My mistake with mislabeling these has driven me mad lol, but I'm pretty certain this sorts it out though if you relabel the vids like how I've listed above and keep this as the real ep3."
