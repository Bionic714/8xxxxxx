,_RADIUS_,2013-01-26T23:15Z,"Macbook Pro Retina - OSX 10.8.2 

Unfortunately does not work. I've also made many attempts to get this damn game working but it seems extremely problematic at best. 

Thanks for the upload though!"
,conze,2013-03-08T16:52Z,Doesn't work please fix.
,gensouu,2013-04-06T13:46Z,"from what i can gather mountain lion have changed a code line in their rosetta that stops older games from working with new intel macs and such, there are a few apps that can simulate the correct environment to work but i haven't tested any (wineskin and wrapper), ill see if i can patch a file in the container but will update if i can fix issue, thx"
