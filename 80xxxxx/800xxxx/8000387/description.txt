All You Can Eat
Documentary exploring the increasingly popular world of competitive eating, discovering how Britain has begun to embrace America's love of super-sized food challenges. The programme takes a look at competitions in the USA such as New York's famous Independence Day hotdog eating contest, which is watched by thousands every year. In contrast, the slightly more eccentric eating competitions here in the UK include Whitstable's annual oyster eating contest, the very painful World Stinging Nettle Championship in Dorset, and the festival of fiery foods in Brighton.
