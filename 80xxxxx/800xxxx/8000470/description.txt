In the long-awaited follow-up to her Pulitzer Prize-winning Gulag, acclaimed 

journalist Anne Applebaum delivers a groundbreaking history of how Communism took 

over Eastern Europe after World War II and transformed in frightening fashion the 

individuals who came under its sway.
 
 
 

At the end of World War II, the Soviet Union to its surprise and delight found itself 

in control of a huge swath of territory in Eastern Europe. Stalin and his secret 

police set out to convert a dozen radically different countries to Communism, a 

completely new political and moral system. In Iron Curtain, Pulitzer Prize-winning 

journalist Anne Applebaum describes how the Communist regimes of Eastern Europe were 

created and what daily life was like once they were complete. She draws on newly 

opened East European archives, interviews, and personal accounts translated for the 

first time to portray in devastating detail the dilemmas faced by millions of 

individuals trying to adjust to a way of life that challenged their every belief and 

took away everything they had accumulated. Today the Soviet Bloc is a lost 

civilization, one whose cruelty, paranoia, bizarre morality, and strange aesthetics 

Applebaum captures in the electrifying pages of Iron Curtain.
