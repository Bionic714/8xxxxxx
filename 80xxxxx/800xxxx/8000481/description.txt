Left 4 Dead 2 (abbreviated as L4D2) is a cooperative first-person shooter video game. 
It is the sequel to Valve Corporation's award-winning Left 4 Dead. 
The game launched on November 17, 2009, for Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 in the United States and November 20 in Europe; in 2010. 
It builds upon the cooperatively-focused gameplay of the original and uses Valve"s proprietary Source engine, the same game engine used in Left 4 Dead.
Left 4 Dead 2 is set during the aftermath of an apocalyptic pandemic, and focuses on four survivors fighting against hordes of the infected, who develop severe psychosis and exhibit zombie-like tendencies. 
The survivors must fight their way through levels, interspersed with safe houses that act as checkpoints, with the goal of reaching a rescue vehicle at the campaign's finale. 
The gameplay is procedurally altered by an artificial intelligence engine dubbed the "Director" that monitors the players' performance and adjusts the scenario to provide a dynamic challenge. 
Several new features have been introduced: new types of infected, melee weapons, and a story-arc that connects the game's five campaigns together.......
