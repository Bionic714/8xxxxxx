,BD175,2013-01-19T04:30Z,"Crashes win7x64 by itself (black screen as game starts, nil response from PC including capslock/numlock). Have tried the admin rights thing, got .NET up to date, DirectX, etc. There is a patch on nosteam site but doesn't make it clear what it's for and I can't access yet because of the stupid depositfiles site limits (use torrents nosteam!). You may be better off with the Skidrow one instead despite the size."
