About the Game:

Rage is a first-person shooter video game developed by id Software. It uses the company's OpenGL based id Tech 5 engine.
The game is set in a post-apocalyptic near future, following the impact of the asteroid 99942 Apophis on Earth.
The game has been described as similar to the movie Mad Max 2 and to video games such as Fallout and Borderlands.
Influences on the driving and racing gameplay include games such as MotorStorm and Burnout. 
Players can upgrade their cars with racing certificates won from races.
Combat is undertaken from a first-person perspective; the player is armed with a variety of upgradeable firearms, as well as a crossbow, and boomerang-like weapons called "wingsticks" which can be used for stealthy attacks. 
There are several types of ammunition available for each weapon, to allow the player to further customize his or her player style. 
As an example, the crossbow's primary ammunition is metal bolts, but it also can shoot electrified bolts, explosive bolts, and more. 
There are two standard varieties of enemies, enemies with firearms which will take cover and exchange fire with the player, and melee enemies that will charge the player and attack with melee weapons....
