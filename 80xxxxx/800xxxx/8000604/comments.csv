[V],STFmaryville,2013-01-09T15:57Z,"I like the art. (He's better than Ramos.) I hate Otto. I'm torn about the surprise ending ... on the one hand, I was glad to see him, on the other it kinda cheapens the whole plot."
,robredstar,2013-01-09T16:01Z,"awww, i read it. it is ok i guess but i still don't like it. "
[V],GunningHawk90,2013-01-09T16:12Z,"Gotta agree with ya.

The ending really did cheapen the plot."
,redcorn,2013-01-09T16:13Z,He came into the picture too soon.
,FriendlySpidey,2013-01-09T16:28Z,Marvel didn't waste any time. I wish they'd find a new writer though. Thanks for the upload!
[T],MrDowntown,2013-01-09T17:52Z,"They want all those people who swore it off to stick it out the year? or so it goes on. Knowing he'll be back (for certain - as if there was a doubt) will keep more people on board in the mean time.

I really enjoyed it, it was fun, albeit creepy at certain point (ie. the 'view'). I am on board."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-01-09T20:31Z,"I would assume that this was written at least before 699 + 700 were released. So it isn't in reaction to fan backlash (""people who swore it off"") that the surprise ending was written. Honestly I just don't think Slott knows how to pace a story to even pretend it changes the status quo.

Then again, the initial online attempts to hype/make a big deal about Octospidey was probably thought up by editorial assholes."
,johnstav,2013-01-09T23:26Z,"good art..but the whole story is pointless, obviously they came up with this for people to show more curiosity about otto being spiderman and buy..and then return to classic spidey. stupid idea, stupid scenario."
,Bubbers83,2013-01-10T01:47Z,"My guess is Superior Spider-Man will last until...Amazing Spider-Man 2 comes out. Marvel will want ""Peter Parker"" back as Spider-man to coincide with the movie."
,JustAnotherApprentice,2013-01-10T03:11Z,"Thanks a lot,GunningHawk90!"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-01-10T04:50Z,"i dunno, they didn't bring back gwen stacy in time for the amazing spider-man 1 ... just sayin'"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-01-21T22:07Z,"spidey fans need to read this http://www.bleedingcool.com/2013/01/21/what-did-mary-jane-watson-really-say-to-mephisto/
