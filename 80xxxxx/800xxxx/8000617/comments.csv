,WuzzlePopple,2013-01-09T18:22Z,Thank you so much for doing this. I use to follow your blog until it was taken down. I stop looking for other BGC blogs  and was hoping someone would just post videos on here. Glad to see you on here Joey! 1+ 
,CdnReaper,2013-01-09T19:56Z,I agree with WuzzlePopple so glad to see you here and posting these shows. been watching this with the wife since season one. +1
,CdnReaper,2013-01-09T20:02Z,Can you get the Tanisha Gets Married Episodes ? and Tori & Dean sTORIbook Weddings?
,lalasmooch,2013-01-11T03:39Z,"i dont think the people who've commented on this have actually looked at the torrent before giving it a +1.

this file is 1.25gb for a 40 minute episode for starters... and after wasting 1.25gb to download it I found the audio is at least 5 seconds behind the video. unwatchable."
,WuzzlePopple,2013-01-11T23:33Z,"@lalasmooch, don't be bringing me into your drama post shit. Yes, I watched it before I left a comment, it's not that hard to watch a video and then leave a comment. Wuo;ld you believe that it's possible for someone to do that? I know, it amazing that someone can watched a video before leaving a comment!!!! 
My iTunes recognized the file, so when I uploaded the show to iTunes, it had the cover art the summary, the discripition, it was all there in it's wonderful color and sound.
So don't tell me I'm not satisfied with what I downloaded.
If you are not happy or satisified, keep me out of it, I don't need someone else telling me how I should approve a torrent. I know what I watched and what I listen to, and I say +1 for qaulity, Mmmmkay, thank you!"

1. I check before i upload things
2. This is straight from iTunes (No Converting or anything)
3. It's HD720p and the video & audio is clear
4. Don't leave false comments about the torrent

5. Maybe you wanna upgrade your computer. "
