[V],STFmaryville,2013-01-10T02:38Z,thank you GIANNIS511. i think this is the marvel now series that has impressed me the most with how it takes an original lee/kirby concept and updates it for today's audience while still respecting most of the great stuff of the past 50 years. hickman is doing great work. bagley too!
