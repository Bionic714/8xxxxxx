                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Observational documentary about people who fight their parking tickets. With 
 more being issued than ever before and new technologies being deployed across 
 the country to catch motorists, the film follows both council officials 
 responsible for issuing fixed penalty notices and the motorists who are 
 revolting against the system in all manner of ways - from getting tickets 
 deliberately to prove their point, taking their cases to the High Court and in 
 one instance forming a masked motorcycle gang to take their fight to the 
 streets. Narrated by Alison Steadma. 

                                 Enjoy!
