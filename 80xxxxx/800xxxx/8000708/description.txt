                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Documentary tracking down people across the UK who have made extraordinary 
 blunders on Facebook and other social media websites, revealing the potential 
 dangers of sharing too much information online. Stories include the friends 
 arrested on terror charges at a US airport after a joke tweet, the McDonald's 
 employee who went to jail after hacking an international superstar's Facebook 
 page and the model arrested in her pyjamas after police burst into her home 
 investigating claims she was harassing a celebrity.

                                 Enjoy!
