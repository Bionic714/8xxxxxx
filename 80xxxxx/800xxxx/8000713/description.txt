"The post-oil America Kunstler envisioned in A World Made by Hand (2008) proved intriguing enough to inspire a sequel, which, in turn, portends a longer series. Having established the parameters of a society bereft of government services, automobiles, public utilities, consumer goods, and computers, Kunstler writes with more finesse in this portrayal of a community of survivors in Upstate New York, an old-fashioned yarn of character-building confrontations between humans and the wild, outlaws and decent folks. Kunstler decries our refusal to face facts about our oil habit, dramatizes how quickly ΓÇ£the great thrumming engine of modernityΓÇ¥ can be halted, and celebrates the benefits of living intimately with nature. But his social concerns never overburden the suspenseful, darkly amusing story, with its touches of the fantastic in the mode of Washington Irving, or undermine his seductive characters: plucky young Jasper, the doctorΓÇÖs son; ludicrous bandit and psychopath Billy Bones; a sexy and accomplished witch; and the gruff leader of the bizarre and prosperous New Faith commune who possesses his own supernatural powers. Future installments will be eagerly anticipated."
