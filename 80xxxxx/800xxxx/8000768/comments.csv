,5p1n47,2013-01-09T20:03Z,just moved to Buttf**k nowhere and found out the comic shop 30 min out of town orders ONE ISSUE of Walking Dead a month.......got him ordering more now but for a week or so I would have missed this one so THANKS MAN!! MUCH APPRECIATED
[V],STFmaryville,2013-01-09T20:37Z,"No -- Thank YOU sir, for not only supporting your LCS but straightening the bullshit out with the owner. Sales charts indicate that guy should be ordering at least as many TWD copies as he orders Iron Man, Thor or X-Force! Tell him I said so."
,SirMilagres,2013-01-09T22:37Z,"great torrent, thanks"
,BabiesDontNeedSpleens,2013-01-10T04:46Z,"Thanks once again. Been picking up WD for a while now and the comic shop nearby went under. Interested to see where this all goes. 

Been trying out the new Cobra, but V3 is so sparsely seeded toward the front that some issues are almost impossible. Tried some for weeks. I hate being late to the game, lol

[V],STFmaryville,2013-01-10T13:41Z,"If Carl is really Dr. Octopus, I'm gonna be so pissed.

I'll try to compile all the Cobra issues today ... as you know, it might take awhile."
,InkFae,2013-01-10T16:33Z,Thanks so much!
,InkFae,2013-01-10T16:34Z,anyone know where to get walking dead Just Another Day At The Office and The Walking Dead: Cutting Room Floor? 
[V],STFmaryville,2013-01-10T19:57Z,"Just Another Day at the Office appeared in The Walking Dead: The Official Magazine #1. Neither the story nor the magazine have been scanned, as far as I know. Cutting Room Floor is a hardcover collecting early plots/scripts of the comic series, and hasn't been published yet."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-01-11T03:53Z,"BabiesDontNeedSpleens, here's your poisonous reptile collection:

,pow.r.pop,2013-01-21T02:09Z,#107 can't come soon enough
,songleaks,2013-01-24T22:36Z,"@STFmaryville (or anyone else), is there any chance you guys have a copy of issue #88 that doesn't cut off part 1 of the interview with Jay Bonansinga? "
[V],STFmaryville,2013-01-25T06:52Z,"songleaks, i see what you mean. how frustrating is that shit! i'll try to find that for you."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-01-25T18:04Z,"well thanks for seeding bashprompt, and thanks for the comment.

but any tard knows that Image has been the publisher of this series for over 10 years, and america's 3rd largest comic publisher for over 20 years.

i always try to fit name of publisher into titles, and since at least 500 people are seeding, i guess it isn't that fucking confusing."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-01-25T18:25Z,"songleaks, here's that issue -- including the interview you wanted:

Best book out there. Need a copy for my tablet."
,comrsrch,2013-02-09T19:31Z,"Thank you for all of the great scans! Also, I am a professor who is writing a journal article about scanner tags as a form of art, and I would love to chat (in a secure, anonymous way) with scanners/preservationsists to learn more about this part of the subculture.I'm just fascinated by these tags, and this art form deserves to be documented and preserved. Thanks in advance."
,comrsrch,2013-02-09T19:31Z,Anyone who wants to chat about this can reach me at trinitycomicresearch on gmail. Thanks!
