I review your uploads regularly and download many of them. I especially enjoy the Disappeared series. Thanks for the cyberlocker option, i use it occasionally to bring them back to torrent and help seed those without seeders. Sorry i don't say thanks more often. Consider this one to cover the 50 or so i've downloaded and shared, I'll be sure to say thanks more often. Again, best wishes for you in 2013!!"
[T],MrUnpopular,2013-01-09T22:42Z,"Thank you for the kind words and keeping torrents alive, we appreciate it. Just a FYI tNe over at kat  has been uploading Disappeared, so rather than dupe him we skip it. Dunno if you've found it but if you're wondering where the newer episodes for Disappeared are, there you go. :-) Good luck with 2013 also!"
,solodadd1,2013-01-10T09:59Z,"ok great i knew tNe had went to kat, but last i read he had stopped capping. good to see he's back in business. i didnt realize you havent uploaded the show in awhile, you give me so much to watch i'm like 5 episodes behind in disappeared. i'm about that many episodes behind in most of them. i've sampled almost all of them, other favorites are unusual suspects, deadly women, i didn't do it, final witness, and devil you know. my guess is you watch some of this stuff yourself. out of all of the true crime stuff ive watched in awhile, my fav was one of the cuff me if you can episodes about a guy who  lived at the TN/AL/GA state lines and hid in the mountains from the law, with the community helping him stay hidden. Most of these shows are sad and drama-filled. this episode i found myself laughing all the way through. if you didnt see it yourself, i definitely suggest it.  "
[T],MrUnpopular,2013-01-10T19:17Z,"Yeah, I read that tNe stopped but when going to released more Disappeared but saw that he did it so I was thought nevermind, no need to dupe him. We'll only upload if we're ready to and see he hasn't, but by the looks of it he has it covered for now.

I do watch some of the caps but I'm way too busy to have time to get to them all, but they are backed up. Some I do like more than others, but all of ID is (usually) interesting."
