the setups seems to detect the installation too. But after finished installation and reboot of my PC I'm still getting a warning that my data's are out of date.

,JWRBlack,2013-01-13T20:16Z,@airbusflyer: Look to see if you have multiple 'Enroute' folders in your Jeppesen folders. You will probably find one with older data. Just copy all the newer data from another 'Enroute' folder into it.
,FSallATP-2,2013-01-15T00:17Z,"@airbusflyer.
even the more expensive flight planning systems sometimes messup the routes. In europe i try the route first with IFR flightplan pro (freeware so far) as it validates the plan/route with eurocontrol respecting RADs, so cant go wrong there. otherwise Jetplan is a good choice but very hard to get..."
,airbusflyer,2013-01-21T13:48Z,"@FSallATP-2 and JWRBlack
I can't find any EnRoute Folder on my PC?! So no chance to delete one.
IFR Flight Planner is a nice tool but its sometimes a bit outdated due no actual NavData. Also they do not provide aircraft details. I configured one by myself but it's from being correct.
If someone having idea how to get Jetplanner or a solution for above please write :) Thanks ;)

PS: nothing about good flight planning and routes"
,precursor1188,2013-01-25T14:04Z,"@airbusflyer
Your original flitestar enroute data folder should be C-Jeppesen-flitestar-enroutedata.
The dvd install the flitestar enroute data to C-programdata-jeppesen-flitestar-enroutedata.
Programdata folder is hidden. U have to unhide it.
I guess you can copy the data from enroutedata folder to the other.
Hope this helps."
,airbusflyer,2013-01-29T15:58Z,"@precursor1188
thanks, that helped and now I'm on 1301 :)
Still 4 problems. 
First I can't add a B737 from Jeppesen Page :( 
2. The routes generated are still not CFMU valid. I got 5 errors on route LEMH-EDDV 
3. It's not generating the EET/ for the flight
4. I can't add own routes with airways, I have to enter and search every waypoint :(

But thanks already!"

I am totally new & novice to the community of Jeppview & does not know how to start and now wants to start using the software. 

In this regard, can you please guide me, first about the complete procedure for installation of Jeppview (where to find the installation file) & secondly how to run it as well. I am using Windows 7. Or you could refer me to any specific forum/site, where i can find the desired info.

Any help would be very valuable for me."
