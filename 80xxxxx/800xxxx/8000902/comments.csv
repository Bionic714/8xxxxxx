I hardly ever watch DVD screeners -- I usually watch m720p BluRay rips -- so please take my review with a grain of salt.
A/V/M = 8/6/7
Dark scenes were a little too dark and colors were sometimes over-saturated. Sharpness was okay, but not great on my 60"" TV.
But this was a great quality for a movie that hit the theaters so recently."
