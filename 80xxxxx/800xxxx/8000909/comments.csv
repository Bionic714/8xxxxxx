,jscalez225,2013-01-21T20:37Z,CAN SOMEONE SEED THIS? LIKE NOW?
,bleargh,2013-01-22T15:45Z,"This is working great for me in VirtualBox on my 64-bit Win7 machine. In VirtualBox I created a VM that has a CD-ROM drive configured to automatically mount a ""CD"" which is actually this ISO file. It booted right into it. During the setup, I was not prompted to enter a product key. The only weird thing was that Automatic Updates was enabled even though I chose not to enable it. I disabled it first thing, then ran Windows Update myself. The product key must be working, because after Windows Update updated itself, I got a big list of High Priority updates. It's getting all the high priority and optional updates now, so I'm quite happy.

Actually, one of the updates is a non-security one to install a WGA validation tool, so if you are like me, you probably want to uncheck and disable that! This is the reason I disabled Automatic Updates; I don't want a future ""high priority update"" to install something that's going to deactivate the OS. However, I get the impression all these unofficial XP distros are on borrowed time, no matter what you do..."
,sphinksy,2013-01-28T21:08Z,"@bleargh
That's why I usually just download the latest win XP which at the moment should be working and update it fully and then i disable automatic updates. Then I just use this for some time (usually like a year) and then I download another new version and rinse/repeat :)"
