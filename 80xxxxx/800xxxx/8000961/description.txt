      Rusty Cooley was named one of the top 20 fastest shredders of all time, and has been an influence to many guitarists including Mark Tremonti and John Petrucci. In this program Rusty teaches you his unique fretboard visualization through shapes, patterns and years of modal knowledge. Learn how the modes are covered across the neck, 5 and 6 string root modal patterns, extended and split patterns, single and double string techniques. Rusty shows you the modal sequences he uses then challenges you to play the scales and modes. Apply all these techniques and develop your own style over the full band backing tracks included in this program.

Enhance your learning experience, links with instructors, download backing tracks, access message boards, and much more.
