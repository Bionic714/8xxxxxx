Of course people in power will use your information against you!! what do you expect?
All actions have consequences and when you blab about your insane actions, be prepared for the consequences. 
If you think that deleting your comments will get rid of it, you are naive. Once posted, it will be archived and used forever.
Thank you mvgroup for sharing. I love most of your stuff. Its educational and beats the mindless shitty tv programs any day. "
