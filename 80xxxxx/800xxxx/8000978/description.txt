Don't Blame Facebook
This enlightening film tracks down people across the UK who have made some of the most extraordinary faux-pas on Facebook and other social media in the past few years. The programme discovers how sharing too much information online can have disastrous consequences, and reveals how these people's lives have been affected in the aftermath of their online 'fails'. From the friends arrested on terror charges at a US airport after a joke tweet, to the McDonald's employee who went to jail after hacking an international superstar's Facebook page, and the model arrested in her pyjamas when police burst into her home investigating a suspicion that she was harassing a celebrity, the film demonstrates why everyone should be aware that you can never be sure who is watching, reading and sharing your social media timeline.
