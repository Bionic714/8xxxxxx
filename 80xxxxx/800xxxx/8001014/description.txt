Plot synopsis:
An unqualified teacher finds himself saddled with coaching duties after a small group of high school seniors form a wrestling team in a last ditch effort to end a 9-year losing streak against a rival school. 

I searched for years and years to find this movie, so I would like to give back and make it a little easier to find for fellow wrestling fans.  Please excuse the poor quality, it is from a DVD rip of a VHS transfer.  If you are downloading, please seed!!!
