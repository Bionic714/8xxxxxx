,weaping_reaper,2013-01-10T07:03Z,"Really hoping you didn't end it when the clock hit zero like you normally do, Really hoping you were smart enough to leave in the interviews and trophy presentation after the game, I guess I'll find out."
,FreeAtLast00,2013-01-10T07:30Z,Nepotu....HUGE thanks. I live outside the US and the game wasn't on tv here. Now I can watch it. Thanks for making my week.

[V],Nepotu,2013-01-10T11:50Z,"To all my dear friends who wrote me, you're all so welcome, guyz! Thank you for your great words and I hope don't let you down in the future and achive your expectations. Cheers, brothaz!"
,Retrenched,2013-01-10T19:34Z,Yep - ending omitted.  Clearly not smart enough...
,weaping_reaper,2013-01-11T03:24Z,"Yet again ANOTHER INCOMPLETE TORRENT FROM Nepotu!!
You never fail us Nepotu, As soon as the clock hits Zero, and everyone starts walking, you cut it off!, 
ITS NOT LIKE THIS WAS THE NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP OR ANYTHING!! ITS NOT LIKE THEY WERE GOING TO GIVE OUT TROPHYS  OR ANYTHING, OR HAVE SERIOUS INTERVIEWS WITH THE PLAYERS!!
I swear Nepotu, you act like you are bootlegging a movie in a theater or something, as soon as the credits roll, you get the fuck outta there! "
,weaping_reaper,2013-01-11T03:33Z,"For anyone wanting to archive the FULL COMPLETE HD version of this game, I found a good rip on youtube. download Mozilla Download Helper and rip the game from there, I wish I could seed the game, But I goddamn refuse to seed an Incomplete bullshit torrent like this one."
,yu4657,2013-01-27T20:43Z,"Hey weeping_reaper, can't find the video on YouTube but can make a torrent from it. Can you link us, or upload somewhere for me? TY"
