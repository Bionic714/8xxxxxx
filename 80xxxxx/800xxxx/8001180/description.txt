The most (the 80's) of these remixes have been recorded from the Dutch radio.
But the quality is still very good to listen to.

Info From Ben Liebrand site (see www.benliebrand.nl)

A lot of people used and abused these GRANDMIXES to put out a series of bootlegs over the years,
earning easy money with Liebrand's work, which eventually caused Ben to stop making these mixes.

This also seems to be the perfect spot to make things clear.
- The GRANDMIX appeared 10 times from 1983 to 1992
- The GRANDMIX 2000 - 2012 are released by Sony 
- All mixes between 1993 and 1999 presented as being GRANDMIXES
  (including stuff like "Uncle Ben's" and DJ Bootleg 99 mixes) of the years
  1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998 and 1999 are NOT mixed by Ben Liebrand,
  and are just as illegal as all other GRANDMIX bootlegs
  no matter what people would like you to believe.
- As an additional mix to end the series of "In The Mix" shows on radio,
  Ben made the "Classics mix" featuring the best tracks from the late 1970's to roughly 1982.
- From 1999 on Ben agreed with Sony on a new 3-hour format which
  made it possible to get these new Grandmixes released on CD.
