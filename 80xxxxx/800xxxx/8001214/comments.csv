,bonzofan,2013-02-13T14:58Z,"The only bit of the koran it's necessary to know. This was the last part to be written and is the only chapter that does not begin with ""In the name of allah the gracious/merciful"" etc. This is because it contains no grace or mercy. Contains the ""verse of the sword"" (""kill the unbeliever wherever you find him..."") and, by the principle of Abrogation, replaces anything written earlier.
So, you worship a ""god"" that not only can't make it's mind up but also couldn't come up with a better method of organizing a book than ""longest bit at the start, shortest at the end"". 
Islam has always been a POLITICO-religious system. Born in war and violence and not changed yet."
