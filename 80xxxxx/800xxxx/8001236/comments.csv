,ImSoJaded,2013-01-09T22:51Z,"Seed, for Fuck's sake. Why bother uploading shit if you don't seed it."
,hashburki,2013-01-10T13:14Z,If you can't seed!!! don't upload!!!
,ImSoJaded,2013-01-10T20:28Z,"@dynstab1:
Yes, that's what I ended up doing. However, my previous comment still stands: if somebody wants to upload a torrent then, I believe, it is not an unrealistic expectation that they should seed it up to a sufficient ratio."
,indiaman,2013-01-11T12:55Z,"dynstab1 - Where are you ? I don't see any more uploads from you.I miss your wonderful uploads and hope you start uploading soon.
Regarding this upload, there may be a technical snag as previous uploads by KatQwerty have been great."
