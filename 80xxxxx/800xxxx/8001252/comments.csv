[T],Tyr3ll,2013-01-11T19:32Z,"jersson :
latest version does not really work with sound crack,that's why you risk to not see a such new release again.
...
There's many other programs that are able to do similar job as well.
don't focus on it,you could waste your time...best way is to buy it so.
best regards"
,TheGeekinator,2013-01-12T21:16Z,"Thanks for the above ""How to proceed"" notes Tyr3ll ... worked just fine!  I took the liberty of editing them as follows ...

HOW-TO INSTALL:
1.  Go offline (i.e., disconnect from internet BEFORE installing!)
2.  Install (dcloner.exe), then ""Run"" the program as ""Trial"".
3.  Open ""Advanced setup"" (second icon at upper-right of program interface)
4.  Disable (un-check) the option ""Check update automatically weekly"", then close the program.
5.  Run (as an administrator) the crack file ""Dummy-Maker.ExE"" (extracted from ""Maker.zip"").
6.  Enter your chosen ""name"" and ""email@ddress"", adjust date to year 2013, then click ""generate"", and then ""register offline"".
7.  Restart the program (still offline) and you should get full version now.
8.  Go back online (i.e., reconnect to internet) and enjoy.  This worked fine for me, so it should for everyone else as well.
ADVISORY:  NEVER click ""check for update"" from the program's ""About"" dialog, or re-enable the ""Check update automatically weekly"" option."

,itworks22,2013-01-15T23:28Z,"Followed the Geekinator's instructions to the letter - works great.

The program itself copied a protected DVD in about 45 mins - in one case it was almost 7gb (including some 3gb trailers etc.) and compressed that automatically to fit a standard 4.7gb DVD with effectively no picture loss at all on the main movie - just the trailers. The program has more to offer if you want to tweak it. 

Great chance to try out the new version - many thanks to the uploader."
