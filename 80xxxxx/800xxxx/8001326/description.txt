"Call me crazy, but I hear Ozzy, The Ramones (The 5 do a killer cover of The DemicsΓÇÜ"New York City") and Pink Floyd in their music. Catch them live, and dig this track, a scorcher from their not-yet-released CD. Call it NuPunk if you must, a rock and roll sub-genre this band has a definite handle on." -Bob Segarini

One of Toronto's best and most original bands.  With influences as diverse as Tool, Depeche Mode, and The Beatles, this multi-generational hard rock group is a must listen for any fan of classic, indie, or alternative rock!
