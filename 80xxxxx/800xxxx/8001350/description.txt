Information
------------------------------

He was ranked amongst the world's greatest athletes, but his extraordinary ascent is now matched by his spectacular fall from grace

After his first yellow jersey in 1999, glory, fame and fortune came fast. But for some his superhuman accomplishments were beyond miraculous, too good to be true. In Lance Armstrong: Master of Spin, Bob McKeown interviews insiders who tell an astonishing story about rampant drug-use in cycling, and sketches a portrait of a mighty champion--and cheater. What drove Armstrong to such extremes, and how could he have kept his own doping secret for so long?

Armstrong grew up without a father, and was raised by a hard working mother. He had a knack for sports and the mental toughness to succeed in gruelling endurance sports like the triathlon. He was a rising and ambitious star on the American cycling team, yet in his first four attempts in the Tour de France, 36th place was the best he could do--never being able to compete with the top tier of cyclists on the steep mountains.

Then came his fight with cancer, and his dizzying ascent to the top of the sport, cheating every step of the way, claim his critics. He attracted legions of fans and money, and bullied and chastised all those who questioned him. How did he keep so many secrets, and keep others who knew the full story from speaking out?

Bob McKeown peels away the fa√ßade, and takes a look at a remarkable man who stopped at nothing to stay at the top of the podium.
