Information
------------------------------

James Burke is Back! The legendary science writer and host of the landmark PBS series "Connections" and "The Day the Universe Changed" has returned for a one-hour special - "Re-Connections" - which is celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of his first appearance on American public television. The show, a local production of KCSM, will be shown throughout the PBS network in June.For "Re-Connection", Burke sat down with host Michael Malone, a fellow technology writer, for a lively tour through Burke's career, memorable anecdotes from the series, and Burke's current work creating a new Internet-based teaching tool, the "Knowledge Web."

"Re-Connections was filmed in a warehouse filled with old electronic equipment and other antiques owned by the History San Jose Museum. Old friends James and Michael quickly dove into an intense conversation that ranged from the birth of "Connections" to the challenges of shooting a mini-series around the world, to what Connections would be made today. Burke, as always, was witty, knowledgable, and most of all challenging. The result, "Re-Connections" is not only an important addition to the Burke story, but a memorable television event in itself.

Original broadcast date: June 6, 2004
