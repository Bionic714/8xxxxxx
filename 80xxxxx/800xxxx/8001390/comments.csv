[V],NLUPPER002,2013-01-09T22:00Z,"Everything i upload is real. so is this one.

Al info is provided, so why this question? "
,Transientbuddha,2013-01-10T04:05Z,"THere are two movies about hans and gretel.. 

""The asylum"" and  ""Witch Hunters"" ??
Wich one is this??"
,HugoDrax,2013-01-10T05:19Z,"Dear Transientbuddha. Which part of ""All info is provided"" did you not get? If you took a few seconds to go to the IMDB link provided by NLUPPER002, you would quickly discover that this movie is the mockbuster produced by Global Asylum for $135,000 and distributed by ""The Asylum"". Anyone with half a brain will also note that the cover picture provided with this torrent is titled ""Hansel and Gretel"", and not ""Hansel and Gretel Witch Hunters"", the blockbuster by Paramount with a budget of $60,000,000 starring Jeremy Renner. This is probably a hopeless request but here goes anyway... try the following techniques: ""thinking"", ""paying attention to details"", ""observational clues"", ""reading"", ""making efficient use of informational links"" and ""using common sense"". I'm not holding my breath."
,katana123,2013-01-10T08:10Z,"not the hansel and gretel that i'm waiting for..thanks for the upload though, can't complain about free stuff"
,Transientbuddha,2013-01-10T09:11Z,"Why should I go to so much trouble WHEN you could just add in the title ""from asylum"" or NOT THE UPCOMING HOLLYWOOD!.. Dumbfuck!..."
,DundeeNL,2013-01-10T09:36Z,"NLUPPER002 provides more than enough info and giving us the best High resolution quality.

So don't be an ass !

Again Many Thanks Upper !"

,endoii,2013-01-11T14:24Z,"NLUPPER002 provides exactly as much info, so there's still enough confused idiots dowloading this total crap courtesy of ""the asylum"". brilliant move, shit-peddler. but no thanks."
,silentinquiry,2013-01-16T15:57Z,"what makes it even worse, its in MKV format which is a nuisence to convert to mp4 or avi so most burners can transcode it to dvd, DUH"
,JoaquinAR,2013-01-19T15:27Z,"@NLUPPER002: thanks for the upload!

@everybody else complaining: you are assholes; try to read, people."
