[T],TeamExtreme,2013-01-13T16:55Z,"@dilyan_93
You are on you're own with that, try reinstall it.

@FUAUDRIN
you sure can. Just make sure you set offline mode to false, so it bypasses Mojangs authentication system.

@catat102
We know about this problem and we are working on it :)

@Stefancar92
The game was coded to only run in another directory.

,UntotenQD,2013-01-14T03:41Z,upload a The War Z torrent !! thnks
,deus223,2013-01-16T20:45Z,"Guys just do the world a favor and stop pirating minecraft it is so cheap to just go out and buy a copy of it. Offline servers are fuckin stupid, I bought  copy of minecraft and been lovin it ever since. If you love minecraft then support the makers and buy it!"
,deus223,2013-01-16T20:49Z,Support Minecraft! Buy it!
[T],TeamExtreme,2013-01-17T00:14Z,"Offline/Cracked servers are the same, the only difference is they have there own authentication system, so they tend to have a few more security plugins. Other then that, they are no different.

People like deus223 don't understand how Mojang (creates of Minecraft) makes money from piracy and support p2p.

There are a lot of people who would have never even looked at the game let a lone buy it, I was one of toughs people but just like any other good game, I got hooked on it and joined a server. With in a few months of playing on that server I bought the game and got a Minecraft skin. Today I own the biggest cracked Minecraft server in the world and you would be suprised to know how many of my players buy the game but you can always listen to idiots like deus223 and then Mojang and you miss out.

Support Mojang, Support ThePirateBay and support freedom!"

Like you said, Support Freedom!"
,SirBlackRandoms,2013-01-19T16:49Z,"Was just wondering cause I personally don't like the regular texture pack (default), is there a way to get texture packs onto this properly without it having to be patched? for some reason the MCPatcher Will Not work with the client : says there is an error with the minecraft.jar, if i could get an answer it would be very much helpful thankyou"

,Perkhaze,2013-02-02T01:29Z,nvm got it by updating drivers ^
[T],TeamExtreme,2013-02-02T09:07Z,@Perkhaze I would also recommend updating your java as well.

[T],TeamExtreme,2013-02-03T01:36Z,"Uninstall java, then download the 32bit version and install it, once that is down download the 64bit version and install it.

You should now have 32 and 64bit installed."
,xanat0s,2013-02-03T17:12Z,@TeamExtreme Why the fuck would i google something that is blatantly obvious? What's worse is your faggot fucking installer automagically opens up my browser to your faggot fucking page. Which is precisely what I would expect malware to do.

First off thank you for the great torrent, it is really awesome.

now, i would like to add modpacks such as those provided by feed the beast, is this possible with the torrent? if so, how?

Thanks!"
,brl1995,2013-02-03T18:06Z,"@xanat0s 

If you don't fucking like it then don't download and go fucking buy the game you ungrateful little bastard"
[T],TeamExtreme,2013-02-03T20:31Z,"@xanat0s
What are you on about...?

@brl1995 
You sure can. 

Our Minecraft launcher does not touch the Minecraft files, so you can mod it, just like any other Minecraft.

Most mods come with installation instructions but there almost all the same and very easy to follow. Open the Minecraft.jar with file Winrar located in the bin folder, drag the mod files in and delete the metainf folder that is also in the jar. Its really easy."

,Sylevar,2013-02-18T03:24Z,"Hey,

I got a question which will greatly help solve an argument my wife and I are having.  Does a ""cracked server"" mean that only cracked users can play? or can regular players play on a cracked server as well?"
[T],TeamExtreme,2013-02-18T06:50Z,"@Sylevar

With Minecraft there really is no such thing as a cracked server. Minecraft servers have a setting that you can turn off which lets anyone join.

So to answer the question: Anyone can join a cracked server, even people who have bought the game."
,eryk68,2013-02-20T00:18Z,"What am I supposed to put in for the username/password? It says to pick one. I came up with one, hit Login and get an error saying ""Login Failed"".

,nikkodrummer,2013-03-08T07:29Z,"can anyone help me ?
when i started it it works great but when the minecraft window appears it just got plain black and said 
 Bad video card drivers!      
      -----------------------      

Minecraft was unable to start because it failed to find an accelerated OpenGL mode.
This can usually be fixed by updating the video card drivers.

there is hope for me as a programmer. I can make the crappiest game and it will make me millions as long as people can mod it. for the people who made the mods they get nothing.

and why does it load every block in the world at the same time. there should be a temp file that then gets passed as a save when exited. I don't get how skyrim plays better  on high detail then minecraft does on medium with long distance vision"
