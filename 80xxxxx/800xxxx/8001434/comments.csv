For Some Games You Want To Download There is a Server Problem But Not For ALL Games.
In This Case, You Must Wait For The next Update That Will Fix The Bug. It Will Be Not Long Because They Release Update Frequently.""
So far these are the games that i was able to get: Half-Life 2, FarCry 2, Left 4 Dead 2, 18-Wheelers, and some others.
hopefully they will come out with an update soon."
