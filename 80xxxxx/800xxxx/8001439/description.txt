Perhaps you've already wondered and fantasized about how would your life be different if you were just a little bit taller, how many more opportunities would you have dating, how much more money you would make, how much more popular and respected would you be, how people would look differently at you, how much better would people treat you, how much easier would your life be and and how much better would you feel about yourself?

It's true we live in a world where appearances matter. It may not be fair and if you live like a monk or a like a nun, it may not matter, but living and working in the world as we know it, few inches can make whole lot of a difference. Your height doesn't determine your self-worth and it should't influence your sense of self-esteem, but let's face it few extra inches can open the doors of all kinds of new opportunities in your life. And you know it all too well.
