"WISH YOU WERE HERE," Part Two
New Arc! Great Jumping on point! Join the mystery everyone is talking about!!
As Dane and Jo try to find a way to clear his name, someone else is sitting pretty, unaware that it is merely the calm before the storm for them. And after Elle's latest "possession," will Dr Geller and Detective Wallace be able to set aside science and facts to start trusting in the supernatural?

I don't know when part two of a storyline became a "great jumping on point," but that's what Image said. LMAO!  --STFmaryville
