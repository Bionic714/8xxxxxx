West of Memphis is an examination of a failure of justice in Arkansas. The 
documentary tells the hitherto unknown story behind an extraordinary and 
desperate fight to bring the truth to light. Told and made by those who 
lived it, the filmmakers' unprecedented access to the inner workings of the 
defense, allows the film to show the investigation, research and appeals 
process in a way that has never been seen before; revealing shocking and 
disturbing new information about a case that still haunts the American 
South.
