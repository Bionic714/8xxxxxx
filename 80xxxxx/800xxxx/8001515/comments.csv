Unfortunately, after a few albums (and different producers - Mike Chapman to Giorgio Moroder), it seemed like she didn't find her niche, but this and her other solo albums remain a testament to her excellence.

Thanks again for this labor of love (including the quality!) - it is very much appreciated!"

Thanks for all of her other terrific releases as well!"
