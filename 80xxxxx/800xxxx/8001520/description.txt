The Rebellion, from the battle of Yavin to five years after!

Open resistance begins to spread across the galaxy in protest of the Empire's tyranny.  Rebel groups unite, and the Galactic Civil War begins.  This era begins with the Rebel victory that secured the Death Star plans, and ends a year after the death of the Emperor high over the forest moon of Endor.  This is the era in which the events in A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi take place.   The events in this story take place shortly after the events in Star Wars:  Episode IV -- A New Hope.
