                           DESCRiPTiON 
 
 One-off documentary investigating the popularity of supersized meals, 
 restaurant challenges and large-scale eating competitions in Britain and 
 America. The programme follows a 72-year-old Brit trying to beat his own record 
 of consuming 32 boiled eggs in a minute, and a man travelling to the US to take 
 part in a chicken wing-eating contest. There's also an insight into a hot-dog 
 event held in New York each year on July 4, and several eccentric home-grown 
 gatherings such as Dorset's World Stinging Nettle Eating Championship and the 
 Fiery Foods UK Chilli Festival in Brighton.
                                 
                                 Enjoy!
