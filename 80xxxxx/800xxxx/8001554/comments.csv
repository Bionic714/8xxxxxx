,Machine4578,2013-01-10T01:48Z,the crack is no good.. specifically the steam_api.dll!! SKIDROW sucks again!!
,OmniNegro,2013-01-10T02:11Z,"What exactly is wrong with the crack? You mention the DLL but never said what about it is wrong.

Are you just one of those whiney kids who hates Steam? If so, too bad. The game requires it.

If not, then please kindly explain what is wrong."
,Machine4578,2013-01-10T02:36Z,SKIDROW forgot to add buddha.dll dependency to the steam_api.dll which will make the crack NOT WORK!!..

,Beelzy,2013-01-10T05:30Z,"Yea broken sadly, kudos on the work though :/"

I hope there is a crackfix soon."

,SirAnon,2013-03-15T11:57Z,This does NOT work. It makes everything much worse and you will have to reapply other cracks/updates to make it work again.
