Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site :: On the invigorating Wednesday, January 9 edition of Infowars Live, Alex Jones confronts the thinly-veiled threats against his life as so-called pundits joke about killing him on nationwide television. 

He'll continue to explore the media's fascination with his impassioned speech on Piers Morgan Tonight, and also continue to break down their attempts to demonize himself and all law-abiding gunowners. 

On today's show, Alex welcomes former Congressman Ron Paul to speak about the establishment's attempt to "brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way," to quote Eric Holder. 

He'll also welcome Executive Director of Gun Owners of America, Mr. Larry Pratt, to chat about their respective interviews with the British citizen engaged in subversion of the Constitution.
