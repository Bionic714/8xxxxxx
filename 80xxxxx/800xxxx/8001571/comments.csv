,cavpollo,2013-01-17T01:47Z,"This works, and it is indeed for Flash CS6.
My PC is a 64-bit one, but for some reason I had to use the 32-bit crack... anyway, great torrent. Thanks!"
,Godofgeisha,2013-01-20T13:55Z,hey having trouble finding the program file folder for flash. I mean i followed the steps and downloaded the trial and the crack just cant seem to find where to put it. its not my first crack just kinda bewildered where to go on this one
,r-ardilla,2013-01-22T07:15Z,Security Essentials is giving me a warning about the dll files. Need I worry or is it a false positive?
,icescate,2013-02-16T19:40Z,"I've down loaded both files, yours & the original by thingy. they are both the same files with little variations but this one is just as vague as the first. Both of these files are for  the advanced user If you are someone trying to learn how to operate I suggest you try A differant download to learn how to do this properly my mistake was to think this was user  friendly but to my surprise I spent hours trying to figure it out but to my demise I wasted a few hours to lead to nothing. So basically it was a waste of time,  So I must say thanx for your effort.  "
,waster206,2013-03-11T02:27Z,works like a charm. many thanks. for anyone having problems just copy the cracked dll to c>program files>adobe>flash pro and overwrite the old one. very simple ...
,maxjasper,2013-04-12T03:24Z,Thanks a lot bro
,Ceyla,2013-05-20T05:16Z,"Indeed, this works fine.
If, however, you're having problems, it may be like cavpollo said, that you need to use the 32-bit crack, despite being on a 64-bit system."
