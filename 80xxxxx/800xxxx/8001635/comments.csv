,suiteo,2013-01-10T03:31Z,Plot? IMDB Link??? Without either of these two items (not to mention the technical specs of the video itself) it's a complete waste of time.  If you can't be bothered to be informative then I just can't be bothered with any of your downloads.

@suiteo: took less than a minute. @TvTeam: I love you guys but at least the specs on the video/audio would be nice. I am willing to post these for you and not JUST complain if you can message me on KAT. Thanks!"
