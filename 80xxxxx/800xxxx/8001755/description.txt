You've been wondering it for months now ... what will happen to Abby's bookstore? Wait, no. You've been asking, "Is it a boy? A girl? Twins? Triplets? Will it have powers? Is it an illusion cast by a magic spell?" (Okay, we'll answer the last one right now: No.) Your questions will be answered this issue! And, seriously, the fate of the bookstore is revealed, too.
