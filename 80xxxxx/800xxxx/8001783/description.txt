The importance attached to rapidly developing our biodefensive capabilities has recently resulted in a significantly increased funding for biodefense research. Accordingly, researchers will respond with an effort equal to the challenge, producing an impressive body of findings.

To ensure that this effort continues in the most efficient manner, Biodefense: Research Methodology and Animal Models presents a thorough historical and current review of biodefense research, encouraging researchers to leverage relevant results, rather than duplicate them. By building on the work of others, scientists will be able to proceed in a way that makes the best use of available resources, while avoiding unnecessary duplication of animal research.

Including contributions from recognized leaders in the field who have developed and refined the animal models presented, this book examines those bacterial, viral, and toxic agents considered to pose the greatest threats to public safety. Each section on a specific agent provides pertinent background information, followed by a description of those animal models employed in research and testing and a discussion of how the findings translate to human impact.
