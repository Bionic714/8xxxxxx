,Finishwhatustarted,2013-01-10T02:09Z,Many thanks. Been waiting awhile for this. Looked it over and it's complete.  Will be seeding for a while.
,Skycatcher,2013-01-10T03:45Z,"Checked it, it's legit, jumped through the book checking chapters. Table of contents don't work properly but who cares considering TOR is not releasing the ebook till April 9th....Nice one !!!!

btw its in epub and mobi format

Thanks."
,poboy975,2013-01-10T04:30Z,"You, sir, are my hero! I've been waiting for this book for so long, and I was intensely frustrated by the decision to hold the eBook until April."
,KidenStormsoarer,2013-01-10T05:53Z,"Thank you so much!  I'm going to enjoy this so much more, as i relish the thought of how much tor has screwed themselves over by NOT releasing this with the hardcover."
,ikilledsanta,2013-01-10T07:14Z,"Looked through it quickly and it seems to be legit. Can't thank you (and the original scanner) enough for this ebook...I pirate ebooks often, but when something I've been anticipating (like this book) comes out I'm more than willing to shell out a few dollars for the book. However, Tor's decision to go audiobook-and-hardcover-only lost them my patronage. I'm not going to buy the hardcover when the rest of my collection is softcover. And I'm also not going to wait a few months to read this book. So I'll pirate it now and buy the softcover when it comes out."
,bdnayi01,2013-01-10T08:46Z,"Thanks, Thanks, Thanks. Muchas Gracias. been searching for this since"
[T],micron66,2013-01-10T11:18Z,"Just so that everyone knows ,the epub and mobi in this torrent were made from an Uncorrected PDF scan,if anyone makes any improvements on this please label the new file as v1.0 for smaller improvements or v3.0 in case of major corrections.

Label it v4.0 only if it has been proof-read thoroughly and formatting looks near to retail."
,Andrewkobe,2013-01-10T11:37Z,"Thank you a million times over, loving this series.  I've been reading Sanderson's Mistborn trilogy in anticipation - another good read!"
,KidenStormsoarer,2013-01-10T15:05Z,"alright!  i'm about a tenth of the way done, so  time for a quality review!  while it isn't perfect, and there are some grammatical errors, i've seen FAR worse online.  the worse thing i've seen so far is a couple of places with a skipped word or punctuation, and one spot where it looks like some of the text got doubled as hotlinks...no clue how that happened.  overall, i give it a good 9/10 in quality...and considering that the ebook isn't even supposed to be available to anybody, i think that you, sacredpotion, are a miracle worker.  thank you so much!"
,bob9001a,2013-01-10T15:10Z,full of fucking mistakes
,sacredpotion24,2013-01-10T15:22Z,"thanks for all your compliments.... as for you Bob9001a....piss off.... i don't see you uploading anything better... Ive pen hours trying to find this and help share it with people..

KidenStormsoarer.... your very welcome... i dunno why there are errors... i fi were you i'd run this book through Calibre and see if it helps any of the errors and mistakes... it might also be some formatting issues.... just taking a shot in the dark here with suggestions... again your all so very welcome...and thank you  to everyone who has helped me over time download what i wanted really bad.. 

:)  happy new years guys."
[T],micron66,2013-01-10T16:01Z,"@sacredpotion24

running it through Calibre won't change anything,it will just convert and give the same formatting.

This will have to be corrected by running it through Sigil and manually correcting whatever errors there are .

,skyeater3,2013-01-10T17:30Z,"This is pretty good but does contain a few mistakes. Most of these are pretty insignificant. A few lines where the text seems to have skipped a line or something. And some occasionally funky formatting. The worst patch I've seen so far is a few pages into chapter 20 where a whole page or so seems to be pretty messed up.

Mostly minor quibbles for the rest of it though. :)

If anyone could fix this up that'd be great:) But otherwise thanks a bunch for the book. I didn't want to wait til April just to read it for whatever silly reason the publisher's had for that."
,Caelein,2013-01-10T18:33Z,"Thank you for this! I had no idea the ebook wasn't going to be released at the same time as the hardcover; what a dick move.  

I've seen a few comments here about mistakes in this copy, although pretty light.  I'll see what I can do about breaking it down and correcting what I can this weekend, unless someone beats me too it."
,bob9001a,2013-01-10T22:24Z,"""Ive pen hours"" ""your very welcome"" ""I fi you""  ""your all so very welcome"" ""wanted really bad"" What the fuck are you blathering about, you fucking moron? Try writing in English. No wonder you cannot see the mistakes, you are damn near fucking illiterate."
,wolfbrother_74,2013-01-10T23:31Z,"bob9001a Why don't you go fuck yourself, you self entitled piece of shit. Someone has worked to find these files and make them available to everyone. If you think you can do better, go find the fucking e-books and audio books yourself and upload them, or shut the fuck up. What the fuck is your problem? Are you fucking retarded? "
,bob9001a,2013-01-11T06:04Z,"I did do better, you pathetic loser wolfbrother (gay ass name btw), but if you think I am sharing with a bunch of inebriated fuck-ups like yourselves, then you are even more fucking stupid than I originally thought."
,sacredpotion24,2013-01-11T08:47Z,bob9001a  GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.  your nothing more than a leech.. all you care about is your own sorry ass...   get the fuck out!! ungrateful piece of shit.
,bob9001a,2013-01-11T11:37Z,"It looks like scared is living up to his name, the fucking moron. The Loser can suck it."
,KidenStormsoarer,2013-01-11T12:16Z,"ATTENTION!  if you go the the audiobook torrent, assuming that it's divided correctly, part three begins with chapter twenty.  the messed up part of the ebook is approximately 12 minutes into the audiobook."
,KidenStormsoarer,2013-01-11T12:19Z,P.S. it's ends at approximately 15:10
,Marikhen,2013-01-12T05:24Z,"Files seem to be pretty badly corrupted in places on my end.  Both files contain a major patch of text around like 1300-1350 where one line of the current chapter is broken off partway through, partial lines from other chapters are inserted, and then the broken line from the current chapter is repeated and it goes on normally.

It's ""legitimate"" as far as it reads like a real Wheel of Time novel ought to and as a continuation of the story, but it's irritating as hell to  have to constantly proofread and correct something like this as I read it, especially if/when I've never read the story before.  >_>"
,BiggC,2013-01-12T06:07Z,"There's been a bit of garbling, and a few points where this random new character ""Fie"" was introduced (took me a bit of time to realise that it was a poorly OCR'd ""he"").

I just hit the garbled page of chapter 20, I feel like it's an important part of the book, so I'm just using the audio-book to fill in the gap."
,BiggC,2013-01-12T06:23Z,"The part in chapter 20 is a lot longer than the garbled text would lead you to believe. I'm not sure if that's the only problem, so either use the audiobooks to fill in the gap, or wait for a better version to come out."
[H],Devin,2013-01-12T12:22Z,Thank you very much sir.
[T],micron66,2013-01-12T17:53Z,"ok guys,i just uploaded a fully corrected, proofed, formatted, spellchecked version of A Memory of Light in EPUB/MOBI - 

https://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8011950/Wheel_of_Time_14_-_A_Memory_of_Light_(v4.0)_(EPUB_MOBI)

It is retail quality and looks great on my ereader."
,Marikhen,2013-01-12T22:19Z,"The files from that link, or at least the MOBI file, are not what I'd consider ""fully corrected, proofread, and formatted.""  The index links are still corrupting the novel when you convert it to text (which I do for reading on my PSP), and straight from chapter 14:
Doses of Forkroot
“ IT ight . . ” Perrin whispered to Gaul, looking across the landscape.
“It’s dying.”
^ The boiling, thrashing, 

That doesn't look particularly well-proofread or corrected."
[T],micron66,2013-01-12T23:22Z,"@Marikhen

the problem is at your end as you are converting perfectly formatted .mobi file to garbage format like .txt

epub/mobi are the industry standard ebook formats,most all major devices/apps use these formats because the formatting on these is excellent.

Who the hell uses .txt to read ebooks? it is basic text document,of course the formatting will be lost if u convert the mobi file to .txt

I have been scanning/proofing ebooks since many years now.You're claim that ""That doesn't look particularly well-proofread or corrected"" is either a trollish comment or you are ignorant about ebooks.

The epub/mobi files i uploaded are perfectly formatted ,i never upload bad quality ebooks,don't believe me ? click on my user-name and check the hundreds of quality ebooks i have uploaded."
,Marikhen,2013-01-13T02:38Z,"First and foremost you are correct, the problem is in on my end.  Calibre is doing something very funky which is preventing newly added books from being displayed properly and as a result it kept showing the same, corrupted/error-filled books even when I thought I'd deleted them and put yours in.

Secondly you need to learn how to read better and not be so defensive.  I read eBooks in .txt format because I often read them on my PSP.  The only decent ""book"" viewing application I've found for it supports only .txt and .pdf formats, and .pdf viewing is crap.  The fact that .txt files archive better is a nice, if secondary, bonus.

Likewise you're being overly defensive in that you leapt to the defense of a bad copy of the book.  The section I cited was from the version in this torrent, not yours, but you ignored that to defend both it and your own upload.

On a side note before you, or anyone else for that matter, thinks to attack me over using a PSP as a book reader consider this.  The PSP does more than most dedicated book viewers and often costs less."
[T],micron66,2013-01-13T04:08Z,"@Marikhen

you said:""Likewise you're being overly defensive in that you leapt to the defense of a bad copy of the book. The section I cited was from the version in this torrent, not yours, but you ignored that to defend both it and your own upload""

you also said - ""The files from that link, or at least the MOBI file, are not what I'd consider ""fully corrected, proofread, and formatted.""""

clearly,you are referring to my upload and not the version in this torrent.

Let me make it clear for everyone - the versions in my link are indeed ""fully corrected, proofread, and formatted"".

You can read EPUB files on your PSP by using PSPKVM + this application -  'Albite Reader NoTouch 2.1'

http://sourceforge.net/projects/pspkvm/
https://github.com/dumbledore/AlbiteREADER/downloads

Here's another way to read epub files on the PSP. (If you have a file browser, you can do these steps directly on your PSP). Rename the .epub extension to .zip. Unzip the file, and you'll find some html files. Those are the actual text. You can open html files with the PSP's web browser to read it"
,Marikhen,2013-01-13T06:06Z,"Incorrect.  ""Clearly"" I was referring to what I *thought* was your upload.  I thought Calibre was properly loading your files into my library and it wasn't.  Instead of being overly defensive and attacking you could have simply pointed out that the ""errors"" I found did not, in fact, exist in your versions and suggested that I double-check your files, preferably with a different program.

Also, there are still errors.  They are not ""fully"" proofread or corrected.  The files contain significantly fewer errors but they are not 100% error free.  I noted a couple in the comments section for your torrent, and before you think to say that it's because I converted them to text files I verified their existance in the .mobi file.

I haven't bothered cross-checking any but the ones I commented on, but in addition to those I've found a few possible cases of missing quotation marks and apostraphes and at least one instance where two apostraphes were used in place of a quotation mark.   I'm not trying to be hostile or ""trollish"" but your claims imply zero errors and there are errors.

Thank you for the links though, I'll review them later.  Probably after I finish reading the book.  :-D

,TheDragonReborn26,2013-01-14T22:07Z,"Who is this bob douchebag? Choke on a dick bro.

Also, this copy is fine. It's about as close to error free as you're going to find. Only one closer is Mircons's.

Also, to all you whiny little bitches complaining about errors. Put your purses down. Change your tampons or whatever you have to do and buy the book scrubs."

,FUAUDRIN,2013-01-16T22:10Z,"Let me first say thanks for getting anything up quickly, but if you don't realize this is a messed up pieece of garbage YOU'RE the idiot. I hae the physical book next to me as I read this because frequently sections are out of place (during the chapter At the Edge of time in the ebook it switches back to Egwene as the sun is eclipsed, yet in the physical book there's another 3 pages of Aviendha. )This thing is horribly formatted with frequent mistakes in letters and text. So please don't read this as your only source. OP ty for getting ANYTHING up quickly but again don't act like you're the end all and be all of awesome book formatting, because this is terrible."
,FUAUDRIN,2013-01-16T22:11Z,"oh and I'm reading the .mobi on a kindle, so you can't blame formatting."
,Kapri25,2013-01-23T16:16Z,Anonymity...ain't it great? You get to talk shit about people with having to worry about repercussions. Can talk smack about all of the torrents yet somehow not believe that nobody else notices that you rant about all of them. Think being a troll is somehow cool and yet all it makes you look like is nothing more than a douchebag. Salute to the internet and the rise of the troll!
