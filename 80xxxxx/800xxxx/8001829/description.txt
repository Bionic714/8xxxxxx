After facing dark forces in 1970's Tokyo Japan, Ashley J. Williams finds himself trying to find a way back home and to his own time. But what happens when he gets back to his hometown and encounters himself as...a pre-teen?

Hijinks ensue when the evil of the Necronomicon tries to eliminate the Chosen One before he's even old enough to get a driver's license.

It's an untold tale from the past of everyone's favorite chainsaw-wielding, deadite-busting hero!

Thanks goes to Re-em for this release.
