"Life Skills"

Axl is shocked to discover that he and Sue 
are enrolled in the same Life Skills 
class. And things only get worse for the 
Ax-Man when he is assigned to work with 
his sister on a big class project. 
Meanwhile Brick's school therapist, Dr. 
Fulton (Dave Foley), tries to teach him 
how to reach out to his fellow students in 
order to make some friends; and Frankie 
and Mike find themselves dealing with an 
unreasonable insurance company after they 
discover a tree branch has fallen and 
broken the windshield of Frankie's car.
