It's now 1970 and Colonel Crawford is forced to retire after claiming to have found a potential landing strip for alien ships, which turn out to be human-made crop circles made by Tom Clarke specifically to discredit him. One of Crawford's sons, Sam, sees a newspaper report of an archaeological find in Alaska that bears the same hieroglyphs as is on the metal object he keeps locked away. He travels to Alaska to see what he can find out. Jesse Keys is now a young adult but keeps a low profile traveling from town to town. He's also a drug addict but while recovering in a VA hospital he falls in love with a nurse.
