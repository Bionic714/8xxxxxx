,ThatTunechi,2013-01-10T22:42Z,SCSA420 i was wondering if u can also upload ur torrents in 540p or 560p.i been downloading ur torrents since early 2012 and i cant download them anymore cuz i pay for every gb now.u still should upload the 720p but many people who download other wwe torrents download the 400p version and would like a torrent between 400p and 720p.i see a lot of sports torrents uploaded in 540p or 560p.if u do it ull be the only uploader that uploads wwe/tna in this resolution.if any 1 else would like this plz comment.thanks
