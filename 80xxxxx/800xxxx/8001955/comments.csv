,raymond_u,2013-01-10T05:06Z,seems like I'm having connection issues at the moment folks - but will seed when I get back to a stable connection - unfortunately about 11 hours away. Apologies for any inconvenience.
,mrudgiantgodofhellfire,2013-01-10T18:11Z,Like my boss said no excuses just get back to work lol Just kidding. Thank you for your hard work getting these uploads out
,raymond_u,2013-01-17T15:57Z,"Unfortunately, since my city is now plagued with floods left right and center (up to 1.5meters in some places) I'm going to have to suspend my uploading of these magazines for a while. I hope you guys understand. When I am able to regain stable internet speeds I will upload the editions I missed during this time.

Thanks folks."
