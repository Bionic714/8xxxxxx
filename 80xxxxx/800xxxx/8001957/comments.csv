,D0gmeat,2013-01-10T05:07Z,What happened to episode 8?
,pamala3,2013-01-10T05:13Z,"Thanks so much for quickly posting my show!  Does anyone know why episode 8 was skipped?  I think it was either the Christmas one with Tessa's birth mom, or perhaps when George shaved to look like Ken?"
,Notor1ous,2013-01-10T05:41Z,"Well almost everyone has incorrectly labelled this.... They didn't skip number 8, they just incorrectly labelled it as episode 9."
,skoli94,2013-01-10T16:47Z,"where is nr 8 ? , This one IS nr 9 !"
,esdii,2013-01-11T00:06Z,This ep is Black Thai which IMDB says is #8. Your mileage may vary...
,amalkamal,2013-01-12T03:27Z,People 9=8 .... so 8 is 9 ;)
,cowfucker,2013-01-16T00:47Z,8=9 7=8 5=6 4=5 3=4 2=3 1=2 0=1
,trixi50,2013-04-07T11:54Z,"I have just watched episode 8 and this is episode 8 too, but  it's been called episode 9. so the question is not where is episode 8, but where is episode 9??"
