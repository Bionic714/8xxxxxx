File size is a bit bigger than it needs to be for 720p resolution, and why not softcode the subtitles if you're using an mkv container? If you're going to use an .srt file, make it an mp4, not mkv.

jalucian -its an UPSCALED DVDSCR not even DVDR .
The greek subs come out later and mp4 suports AAC good but not like the untouched AC-3 .

use this  MkvToMp4  if y like "
