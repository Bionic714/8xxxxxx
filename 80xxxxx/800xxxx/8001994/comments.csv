,Llwynog,2013-01-16T03:37Z,"At 1:55 both the video and audio vanish for about a second, then come back for a second, then drop for another two seconds. At first I assumed the problem was my dying motherboard since stuff has a tendency to skip regardless of whether or not I'm streaming it, but it happened exactly the same way a second time.

Since I got it from EZTV I knew the odds of the file being bad were small so I fired up Vuze and had it verify the file. It said all was well so I tried again and the same hiccups appeared.

I just repeated the scan and test with the same result (with the torrent stopped so to programs trying to access the file at the same time won't cause playback problems; made that mistake enough times). It skipping in precisely the same place four separate times tells me the problem probably actually is with the file."
