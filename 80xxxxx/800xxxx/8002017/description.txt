"Be Careful of Stones That You Throw"

Rayna and Juliette are locked for their tour. 
When Rayna suggests taking her girls with her, 
she finds that Lamar's not above holding her 
hostage with some long forgotten family 
secrets. To everyone's surprise Juliette and 
Sean have eloped, though not everyone is 
celebrating. Deacon reconnects with a former 
flame, and Avery follows the advice of a new 
music producer that puts more space between 
him, the band and Scarlett.

18/Slower+
Evolve... or die.

Enjoy :)
