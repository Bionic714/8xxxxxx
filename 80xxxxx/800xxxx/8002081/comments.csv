Also, I bought Part 2 of Steins;Gate and just want to say to everyone waiting, it's definitely worth the wait. Better yet, it's worth the buy."
[V],Daman4Iife,2013-01-10T19:47Z,"Its similar to One piece and DBZ.
And its good you went out and bought part 2 of steins gate, Its really worth the money and you also support Funimation. "
,WafflesOverWomen,2013-01-11T00:22Z,"Yeah I just noticed the top of the box art read that it's from that studio, clearly a must-watch for me.

Absolutely, I want to start collecting my favorite anime that I haven't yet on blu-rays (or DVDs if I must, like Darker Than Black), so I feel like Steins;Gate was the ice breaker in that regard.

Thanks for all your work, btw."
,bigwhiteguy88,2013-01-14T08:59Z,The manga of this (in my opinion) is great and way better then the show. The show will diverge a lot from the original story line and add extra people that'll re-occur throughout the show that never show in the manga. But thats just how I feel cause I started on the manga. I'm sure there are a lot of people who'll like this series. I'm downloading it cause a voice actor I like is in it. A great upload like always. Will you be uploading Baka and Test Season 2 anytime soon?
