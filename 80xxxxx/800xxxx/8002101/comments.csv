,spaga_,2013-01-11T07:01Z,"why mkv? really want to know. mp4 or m4v are just as good formats but better because they play on every player out there. mkv doesn't, it's useless to a lot of us, which is why yify switched. 

give it a try? please? your torrents are great, but not so great after i re-encode them to play on any of my 4 players"
,tyl3rdurd3n,2013-01-11T20:05Z,"@Spaga: Because h264 encoding is more efficient and you get much better quality at lower bitrates than with straight up mp4. It has better support for multiple audio/sub files all within a single container (mkv). Also, I think until recently, you couldn't even put DTS in the mp4 container but you could in mkv which is why it has become the standard. And mkv is pretty much supported everywhere now so don't know what you're talking about."
,aaussie74,2013-01-12T11:34Z,"The movie is not 720 it is 1280x536.
For my player audio is not supported, that can happen with some times.Still dissapointing."

,ninth1der,2013-01-12T19:07Z,"@aaussie74
Mark Twain: ""Better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubt.""

Please research before you open your mouth. 1280x720 is 16:9 format (1.78:1 ratio). Most movies are shot in 2.38:1. Some ultra-wide screen movies (especially 60-70s films like Lawrence of Arabia) were shot in 2.55:1 CinemaScope.

Because the width of your display screen is NOT adjustable, a widescreen (2.38 or 2.55) presentation will include black bars top and bottom.  Google ""letterbox"" for details.  When encoding a film into a compressed format (.wmv, .mp4, .mkv) the black bars are zero data and are deleted for space.  The initial frame includes the entire 1280x720 but subsequent frames include only the 536 lines of changing data.
On a player (like VLC) that initial frame is unnecessary as the player knows what to do with only 536 lines of data.

Also to improve your viewing experience: 
1)  don't burn to disk and try to play through a DVD/BluRay player. 
2) don't try to play through a gaming system (Google ""Cinavia"" for the most obvious problem)
3) Use a decent desktop computer with a stand alone video card (not one with ""on-board"" graphics)
4) use an HMDI ready video card (or a DVI to HMDI converter
4.a) HDMI carried better audio signal than other digital formats
4.b) If you can't get HDMI audio out of your video card, use digital outs instead of 5.1, 6.1, 7.1 analog outputs from your audio card.  Your home theater head unit will thank you

Last issue:
I always seed to 200%.  And I allow Transmission (2.76) to use 80% of my upstream throughput and 10 connections per torrent (15% and 2 when I engage speed limit so I can work).  Why are there SOOOOOOOO many peers available but most are choked.
Don't be selfish with your bandwidth peeps!!!"
,ninth1der,2013-01-12T19:14Z,"@spaga:
Screw YIFY
All the uploads from YIFY are 2 channel audio.
Why in the name of all that is home theatre sound would you want a movie in 2.0 audio?
By the Gods of Harman and Kardon, I curse YIFY
By the Gods of Klipsch, Yamaha, Marantz and JBL, I curse his children.
May the demons of iPad, PSP and Dell torture him all his days
May LINUX UNIX and MacOSX reject his soul from the gates of Paradise
May he be forced to use Windows Vista (without service packs)."

Good quality :)

thanks :)"
,rdewitt,2013-01-13T01:07Z,"Seriously, please convert from mkv to anything else most of us can play like mp4 or avi. I wont dl an mkv cuz my time is valuable."
,Gumbercules79,2013-01-13T11:26Z,Any Cinavia BS on this one?
,mub_arak,2013-01-13T15:31Z,"A question:
What or who is ""SPARKS""? because I almost see him in every torrent title"

To all .MKV whiners out there: Suck it up!

Seriously! Havent any of you heard of routers and Smart TV's? I transfer my movies to my TV via my PC and it works like a fucking charm! If you cant afford a smart TV then there are other solutions that enable you to explore and display images and videos from your PC/hard drive to your regular TV."
,jimjam1,2013-01-14T01:54Z,everyone that is having a problem playing the mkv just get vlc media player. it plays everything and is free. also there are converters out there for free. thanks for the movie bozx.
,Nocturnus101,2013-01-14T05:41Z,@Spaga: Download VLC works like a charm.
,Nocturnus101,2013-01-14T05:43Z,"-sorry for the double post. ^

,11770,2013-01-16T05:42Z,"my tv is on the newer side , it can play the movie but with no sound. i believe that i need to change the format of the audio"
,lassik2,2013-01-21T03:03Z,Are there supposed to be subtitles for the Korean parts? I mean the movie still made sense but I wasn't sure if I was supposed to know what the Korean parts were or if it was intended that you have to assume what was said. With this style of movie it wouldn't surprise me if the Korean parts were just meant to be untranslated.
,mcrowley,2013-01-21T04:33Z,"Thanks BOZX!  You're great.

ninth1der, you seem intelligent, but spaga_ sounds dumb as a fuckin' brick.  Doubt you got through...

I usually download BOZX torrents for movies I actually want to see.
Not that YIFY doesn't contribute a lot or have his own niche, but I'd rather download a dvdrip than slowly watch my movie go out of sync.

  If I want to put this on my ps3 library(my 'player') I generally the downgrade audio to stereo and change the format to mp4 (not an option for audiophiles).  When I do this I don't pretend to be hard done by, mostly because it would be fucking foolish to think so.

rdewitt, I appreciate that your time is valuable.  My time isn't so valuable that I'm unable to click a mouse button and fucking walk away, go back, press it again a few times.  If it were I'd buy the fucking bluray like everyone else to whom time is a valuable commodity.  Besides, you posted on the wrong persons' wall.  I've never had a shit BOZX rip.  He knows his stuff and does a great job.  Bitch at a user who might listen to you.  It will save you valuable time...

Good rip.  "
,ryballs,2013-01-23T04:54Z,fantastic movie and quality
,veelckoo,2013-01-25T17:41Z,"What mcrowley said.
If you don't know how to use/convert MKV then buy the fucking bluray or go for yify's ""dvd shitty quality 1080p"" torrents."
,.Leto.,2013-01-26T12:18Z,"Good video quality.
3 English subtitles included: 
- normal ones
- for deaf people (so with the very annoying [ ], names of characters written in CAPS)
- non-english dialogues only (there's only a few lines and they're included in the other 2 subs anyway)"
,.Leto.,2013-01-28T12:16Z,"Not really surprising that this movie bombed at the box-office though. If it wasn't for the main actors, who are all excellent, I would have stopped watching. Too strange and slow paced I guess."

Honestly I thought the move was awesome, brought me back to the Reservoir Dog days. Not sure what people were expecting because of the title, but the back stories of the pyschos were pretty damn awesome. "
,Mingin,2013-02-02T07:26Z,I always look to see if there is a BOZX upload of the movie/TV Show/Game etc that I want. Always top top quality. And can someone please shove a cucumber up the arse of all those wankers who bemoan mkv files - get a fuckin life!! Or at least a bit of grey matter
,Mingin,2013-02-02T07:45Z,Big thankyou also to all those seeders out there. Download is mega fast
,redfury91,2013-02-06T02:15Z,how about while youre here at TPB go ahead and download a file converter so you wont have an excuse to cry about how your player doesnt support mkv files? seriously. im sure your converter dl will beat the time it takes to dl this movie. consider your sniveling problems solved.
