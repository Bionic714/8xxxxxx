Tom Judge's training as a priest did not prepare him for the horrors he's seen as a special investigator for the FBI. But Tom's current case -- an unholy combination of the supernatural and murder most foul -- is beyond anything he's ever experienced, and even the powerful Artifact he wields, the Rapture, won't be enough to save him.
