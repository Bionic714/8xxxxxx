Criticism of the Western Civilization - Collection 25 (Medieval & Dark Ages):

The Medieval Ages is a period of the Western Civilization history that lasted from the 5th until the 15th Centuries. It is often called the Dark Ages for it covered some of the darkest periods in the history of Europe when it was under the absolute dominance of the Church, with suppression of thought and learning. The last 500 years of that period was particularly harsh on Europe for it suffered from continuous wars (the crusades, the 100-year war, ..etc), famine, and plagues (the black death).

Many of the major incidents and the atrocities committed by the Church during the medieval ages were addressed in separate uploads. These include: religious wars, religious persecution, the inquisition, the crusades, war against science and scientists, corruption of the papacy and church, schisms in the church,...etc.

We have 30 titles in this upload. The emphasis here is on the social, economical and political aspects of the medieval ages.
