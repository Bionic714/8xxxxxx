,CaptButler,2013-01-12T23:24Z,Subs don't work.
,jigboxz1,2013-01-13T19:12Z,Great movie with French voices and sadly NO subs.What a weirdo uploader ... 
,CaptButler,2013-01-16T05:26Z,"Subs are there, they just won't load.  Subs that will can be found here:  http://www.turkcealtyazi.org/subs/down1/447602-Les-adieux-a-la-reine-2012-1CD-23.976fps-EN-28kB-TurkceAltyazi-org.rar .  Remember to change the name of the file after downloading and extracting."
,leligal,2013-03-18T12:41Z,Thanks! But what about video aspects?
,jj_13,2013-04-16T03:51Z,"Thanks TvTeam for always providing quality ups. Always appreciate your effort.

@CaptButler: Awesome! Having a hard time looking for the proper sub that actually synchs. Thank you. "
