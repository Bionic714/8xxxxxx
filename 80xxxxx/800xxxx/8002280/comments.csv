It might be a good idea to compare the episode list on Wikipedia and redo these.  I guess these torrents can't be fixed, bu maybe complete episodes can be reuploaded that are accurate.  TvTeam are my favorite, so this is constructive criticism, not a complaint.  I have never seen anything of theirs have a problem before.  Keep up the good work!"
