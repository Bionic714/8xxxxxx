He is a jesuit spy/co-agitator

Don't believe it?
Try talking about the jesuits on the air

Although, he cut off Eric Jon Phelps comments in order to give him credibility.

Just sword of violence?

Inciting violence are we mr. Phelps?

The Mr. Phelps of the IMF (impossible Mission Force)?
or the International Monetary Fund which bellies countries into non-repayable debt to control them?

To what end?

jesuit oath, in part;

to insidiously plant the seeds of jealousy and hatred between communities, provinces and states that were at peace, and incite them to deeds of blood

only that the church might be the gainer in the end, ... and that the﻿ end justifies the means"
[T],TalmudTimmy,2013-01-10T23:03Z,"dietrichzumwald, this is a lemon argument.

Eric Jon Phelps is an Israeli diamond merchant and a Zionist. So, of course he will create this ridiculous Jesuit conspiracy theory to take the focus off the Jews. Besides, everyone knows Alex Jones is a Zionist working for Israeli intelligence under Stratfor. Check out ""Mollygate""."
