Biography Documentary hosted by Ann Marie MacDonald, published by CBC broadcasted as part of CBC Doc Zone series in 2008 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

Samuel de Champlain lived his life with his eyes on the horizon. He never wanted to be the second person to see what lay beyond it.

We think we know him well - the founder of Qu√©bec City, a daring adventurer, a meticulous mapmaker and a great explorer. But in fact his life is as big a mystery as this country was when he first landed. Was he a commoner with uncommon ambitions? Was he illegitimate royalty? Or was he a spy? Whoever he was, Champlain was not the man we think we know.

Original broadcast date: September 25, 2008
