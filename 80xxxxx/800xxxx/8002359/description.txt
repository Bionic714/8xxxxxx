The Std XII Science students desirous of admissions to Medical/Dental colleges will have to answer single Eligibility cum Entrance Examination, namely, National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) for admission to MBBS/BDS Course in each academic year from this year.
The Medical Council of India and Dental Council of India have notified that the Central Board of Secondary Education shall be the organization to conduct the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test for admission to MBBS and BDS Courses.
Accordingly, the Central Board of Secondary Education will conduct the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test for admission to MBBS and BDS Courses in the academic session 2013-14 on Sunday, the 5th May 2013. It will replace AIPMT exam. But AIIMS will have its own separate exam.
