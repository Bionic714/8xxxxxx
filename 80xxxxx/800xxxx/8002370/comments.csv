I've never made a torrent, but there's no time like the present to learn, I suppose, so I'll give it a try.  Any non-obvious pitfalls the various online tutorials neglect to mention? 

And, before I forget, it's great to see you back on TPB"

Ya know, nothing too much to say in the way of advice. If you have any questions about seeding a torrent, or would like to discuss alternate ways to share the file with me so I can seed it, drop me a line at the Suprbay (the Forum link below - I'm LeonardTSpock there, also)."

,jessfranc,2013-01-11T06:08Z,Thank you so much LeonardTSpock for these issues of Taboo.  I was the person who requested them a while ago.  I would love to see more issues of this book if anyone else has them to scan and post.  Thanks again.
[V],LeonardTSpock,2013-01-21T07:13Z,"Hey jessfranc, you're most welcome. Glad you were still around to grab them. I'll keep looking for these (and like I said, I may purchase the issues I'm missing), but I have no timetable for you. Just keep an eye out and they'll turn up eventually."
