I may have just put it on PirateBay not that long ago but the average download speed is 1.5MB/s

Enjoy!! "

I just wanted to say thank you for your Yu-Gi-Oh! torrents, as well as other torrents you have that I might be interested in in the future. Your uploads are amazing quality! Keep up the good work!"
