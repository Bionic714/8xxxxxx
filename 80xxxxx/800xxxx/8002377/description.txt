I spent hundreds of dollars to get the Complete Season 2 Box Set of the original Yu-Gi-Oh! series for all of my loyal fans out there.

Encoded the entire season 2 of Yu-Gi-Oh! which is Episodes 50-97 into high quality MKV h.264 format with English audio. 

Now you can enjoy this show in an amazing quality. I can promise that this is the best quality version out there as of today. I think this turned out great and looks very good.

I found one descent torrent of this in a set that has all the seasons in one download but they were lower quality and fuzzy. 

My Season 1 encodes can be found in my uploads as well
My Season 3 encodes can be found in my uploads as well
My Season 4 encodes can be found in my uploads as well
My Season 5 encodes can be found in my uploads as well

Like Yu-Gi-Oh! GX? I encoded it as well and it can be in my uploads
Like Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's? I encoded it as well and it can be found in my uploads
Like Yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal? I encoded it as well and it can be found in my uploads

For playback all you need is the proper codec if you dont already have it. 
Combined Community Codec Pack (which I prefer) or the K-Lite Codec pack should give you all you need and more to play these back.

You should be able to hear audio just fine if you have one of the mentioned codec packs above. If you cannot hear any audio and do not want to install a codec pack for some reason, then you do not have and need the nero aac audio codec. As of today it can be found here.
