Encoded the entire season 4 of Yu-Gi-Oh! which is Episodes 145-184 into high quality MKV h.264 format with English audio. 

Now you can enjoy this show in an amazing quality. I can promise that this is the best quality version out there as of today. I think this turned out great and looks very good.

The second half of this season, episodes 169 through 184 were never released on DVD so they have been ripped from Hulu and fixed up to be just as good as if they came from a DVD. You cant really even tell that they didnt come from a DVD in most of the episodes because I fixed them up so well.

If you were happy with my Yu-Gi-Oh! GX Season 2 and 3 releases then you will be happy with these since the GX seasons came from Hulu and were fixed up by me as well.
I found one descent torrent of this in a set that has all the seasons in one download but they were lower quality and fuzzy. 

My Season 1 encodes can be found in my uploads as well
My Season 2 encodes can be found in my uploads as well
My Season 3 encodes can be found in my uploads as well
My Season 5 encodes can be found in my uploads as well

For playback all you need is the proper codec if you dont already have it. 
Combined Community Codec Pack (which I prefer) or the K-Lite Codec pack should give you all you need and more to play these back.

You should be able to hear audio just fine if you have one of the mentioned codec packs above. If you cannot hear any audio and do not want to install a codec pack for some reason, then you do not have and need the nero aac audio codec. As of today it can be found here.
