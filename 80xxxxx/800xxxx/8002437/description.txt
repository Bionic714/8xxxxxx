Encoded the first 6 volumes of Yu-Gi-Oh! GX which is the complete Season 1 Episodes 1-52 into high quality MKV h.264 format. 

Now you can enjoy this show in an amazing quality, I think this turned out great and looks very good. It is the best quality version of this out there in my opinion.

I found one good torrent of this from CP or CW whatever their name was but they were much lower quality TV rips. 

My season 2 encodes can be found in my uploads as well
My Season 3 encodes can be found in my uploads as well

Like the original Yu-Gi-Oh! series? I encoded it as well and it can be found in my uploads as well
Like Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's? I encoded it as well and it can be found in my uploads as well
Like yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal? I encoded it as well and it can be found in my uploads as well

For playback all you need is the proper codec if you dont already have it. 
Combined Community Codec Pack (which I prefer) or the K-Lite Codec pack should give you all you need and more to play these back.

You should be able to hear audio just fine if you have one of the mentioned codec packs above. If you cannot hear any audio and do not want to install a codec pack for some reason, then you do not have and need the nero aac audio codec. As of today it can be found here.
