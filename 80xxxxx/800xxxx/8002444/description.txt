This season was not released on DVD so I had to do a high quality webrip of this from Hulu and fix the video up alot. It turned out very good and looks as if it was ripped from official DVD's pretty much.

Encoded the entire season 2 of Yu-Gi-Oh! GX which is Episodes 53-104 into high quality MKV h.264 format with English audio. 

Now you can enjoy this show in an amazing quality. I can promise that this is the best quality version out there as of today with confidence. I think this turned out great and looks very good.
I found one descent torrent of this in a set that has all the seasons in one download but they were much lower quality tvrips and fuzzy. 

Seasons 1 and 3 can also be found in my uploads.

Like the original Yu-Gi-Oh! series and the other ones as well? I encoded them as well and they can be found in my uploads.

For playback all you need is the proper codec if you dont already have it. 
Combined Community Codec Pack (which I prefer) or the K-Lite Codec pack should give you all you need and more to play these back.

You should be able to hear audio just fine if you have one of the mentioned codec packs above. If you cannot hear any audio and do not want to install a codec pack for some reason, then you do not have and need the nero aac audio codec. As of today it can be found here.
