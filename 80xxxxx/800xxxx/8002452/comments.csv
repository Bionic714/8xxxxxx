Oh and it's overdue, but LeonardTSpock -- this song's for you my friend ...


Welcome back, your dreams were your ticket out
Welcome back to that same old place that you laughed about
Well, the names have all changed since you hung around
But those dreams have remained and they've turned around

Who'd have thought they'd lead ya (who'd have thought they'd lead ya)
Back here where we need ya (back here where we need ya)
Yeah, we tease him a lot 'cause we've got him on the spot
Welcome back, welcome back, welcome back
Welcome back, welcome back, welcome back"
