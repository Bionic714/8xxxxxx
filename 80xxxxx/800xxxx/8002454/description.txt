Encoded The Yu-Gi-Oh! Movie aka Pyramid Of Light into MKV h.264 format with English Audio and Selectable English, French, and Spanish Subtitles.

This is the PAL version converted to NTSC resolution and playback speed since America never released this in Widescreen. I used the audio and subtitles from the American DVD release to make it 23.976fps so the audio pitch wouldnt be sped up any like my other widescreen release was at 25fps.

Finding this movie was pretty easy but it was hard finding it with DVD like quality and the quality of others was driving me nuts so I decided to make a higher quality version out of the DVD. This is easily the best quality version of this movie that you will find online.

Want the fullscreen version? It can be found in my uploads.

For playback all you need is the proper codec if you dont already have it. 
Combined Community Codec Pack (which I prefer) or the K-Lite Codec pack should give you all you need and more to play these back.

You should be able to hear audio just fine if you have one of the mentioned codec packs above. If you cannot hear any audio and do not want to install a codec pack for some reason, then you do not have and need the nero aac audio codec. As of today it can be found here.
