I didnt have the actual DVD so I had to do a high quality fix up of this from an already encoded source and fix the video up alot because it wasnt that great in quality. It turned out very good and looks practically as if it was ripped from official DVD's pretty much.

Encoded the OVA of Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's into high quality MKV h.264 format with Japanese audio and English subtitles. 

Now you can enjoy the OVA in a great quality encode. I can promise that this is the best quality version out there as of today with confidence.

My Season 1 encodes can be found in my uploads
My Season 2 encodes can be found in my uploads

Like the original Yu-Gi-Oh! series? I encoded it as well and it can be found in my uploads
Like Yu-Gi-Oh! GX? I encoded it as well and it can be found in my uploads
Like Yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal? I encoded it as well and it can be found in my uploads

For playback all you need is the proper codec if you dont already have it. 
Combined Community Codec Pack (which I prefer) or the K-Lite Codec pack should give you all you need and more to play these back.

You should be able to hear audio just fine if you have one of the mentioned codec packs above. If you cannot hear any audio and do not want to install a codec pack for some reason, then you do not have and need the nero aac audio codec. As of today it can be found here.
