Encoded the first 2 Seasons into higher quality MKV format with English and Russian audio.

Finding this for download is pretty hard. When you do find it, it doesnt look so good in quality.

I downloaded as many episodes as I could find that had at least English audio for them and I did what I could to fix it up so there would be a better quality version available.


Here is screenshots of my fix up of the series both before I fixed it up and screenshots of after I fixed it up.

This doesnt have every single episode of Season 2 because no matter what I did, I couldnt find them all unless you wanted Russian audio only without subtitles, but I did find most of Season 2 which was Episodes 14-23 and 26
