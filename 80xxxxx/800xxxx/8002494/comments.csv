,frobknob,2013-01-11T18:40Z,Why are these named .CBR when they're actually .CBZ files?
[V],LeonardTSpock,2013-01-11T21:10Z,"Honestly, no. But does it matter?"
[V],LeonardTSpock,2013-01-12T03:18Z,"Ah, I'm guessing it's because I was brainfarting when I renamed the files after using WinZip to put them back together. I probably named them cbr instead of cbz like I usually do. "
