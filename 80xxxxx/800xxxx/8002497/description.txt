Encoded both seasons of Double Dragon into higher quality MKV format with English audio.

Finding this for download is VERY hard. When you do find it, it looks terrible in quality.

I downloaded all the episodes from the best source I could find and I did what I could with the video and audio to fix it up so there would be a better quality version available.


Here is screenshots of my fix up of the series both before I fixed it up and screenshots of after I fixed it up.
((Important note below screenshots))
