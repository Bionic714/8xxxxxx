,timaayy2000,2013-01-13T14:28Z,"Downloaded quickly. Scanned and no viruses. Quality looks HD, however there is a VERY noticable  large watermark on the bottom right corner of the video which is annoying. Other than that, good torrent."
,Junit151,2013-01-14T20:56Z,The uploader put an annoying watermark on the film.
