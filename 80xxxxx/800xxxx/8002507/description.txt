Encoded the pilot episode into higher quality MKV format with English audio.

This is a pretty old cartoon from around 1992. Mostly only people about 20+ years old will know what this is since it used to be a decent hit video game as well for Nintendo, Super Nintendo and Gameboy.

There was only ever one episode of this made and finding it for download is pretty hard. When you do find it, it doesnt look so good in quality.

I downloaded the Pilot Episode and I did what I could to fix it up so there would be a better quality version available if anyone cared about it.
