Thanks again :)"
,Vintrastorm,2013-01-10T13:14Z,"WARNING!
I haven't listened to this yet but in itunes this folder adds up to about 8hours, which would make this either an abridged version or an incomplete rip. According to wikipedia the book is about 42 hours.  "
,Vintrastorm,2013-01-10T13:17Z,"This is not the entire book! 
Just listened to the last file. Apparently this is only part 1 of X. "

,Jebeker,2013-01-10T21:34Z,"Thanks for the first part, looking forward to the rest.
Ignore bob9001a. He's an asshat and every comment he has ever made is negative with foul language. Plus he's just a leech."
,bob9001a,2013-01-10T22:19Z,Who are you calling a leech you fucking uselesss piece of shit?
,Vintrastorm,2013-01-11T15:05Z,"I agree. User bob9001a is "" a fucking reatrd"". 

It was nice of you to post an explanation and an apology. 

Good job!"

The irony is strong in this one!"
,bob9001a,2013-01-11T22:47Z,"oooooh I made a typo, you caught me, that makes all of your idiocy okay. What a bunch of cock-gobbling, ass-slurping morons."
