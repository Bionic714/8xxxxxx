Encoded all 26 episodes of this series into high quality MKV h.264 format with English audio.

I was able to find this show for download but it was always terrible just watchable copies of the series.

Now you can enjoy this great series in a great quality encode. I can promise that this is the best quality version out there as of today with confidence.

Like Zoids - Chaotic Century? I encoded it as well and it can be found in my uploads.

For playback all you need is the proper codec if you dont already have it. 
Combined Community Codec Pack (which I prefer) or the K-Lite Codec pack should give you all you need and more to play these back.

You should be able to hear audio just fine if you have one of the mentioned codec packs above. If you cannot hear any audio and do not want to install a codec pack for some reason, then you do not have and need the nero aac audio codec. As of today it can be found here.
