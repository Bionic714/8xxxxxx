Encoded all 67 episodes of this series into high quality MKV h.264 format with English audio.
 
I was able to find this show for download and there were pretty decent copies out there but no really exellent ones so I decided to encode this myself at a higher quality.
 
Now you can enjoy this great series in a great quality encode. I can promise that this is the best quality version out there as of today with confidence.

Like Zoids - New Century Zero? I encoded it as well and it can be found in my uploads
 
For playback all you need is the proper codec if you dont already have it. 
Combined Community Codec Pack (which I prefer) or the K-Lite Codec pack should give you all you need and more to play these back.
 
You should be able to hear audio just fine if you have one of the mentioned codec packs above. If you cannot hear any audio and do not want to install a codec pack for some reason, then you do not have and need the nero aac audio codec. As of today it can be found here.

The best runner up I could find to my encodes quality wise was an encode by someone named BA or Baka Anime at around 15.17GB. Here is a comparison between mine and theirs for those who might have wanted to see it.

Ive clearly made it look better. My image is clearer, the aliasing is less and I didnt crop off as much video.
