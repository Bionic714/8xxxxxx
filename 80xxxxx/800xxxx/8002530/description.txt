3)  The Birth of the Devil 
The Ancient Egyptians practiced a complex religion of many gods, and yet they had no devil in their mythology. In fact, most ancient cultures had no conception of the devil. It's only with later, monotheistic beliefs that the notion of pure evil emerges, along with its embodiment, the devil. By examining a historic period of dramatic transition in religious beliefs, Egyptologist Dr. Kara Cooney pinpoints a moment that brought profound change to cultures all around the Mediterranean -- a shift in politics and society that molded the very nature of divinity and beliefs still followed by many today.
