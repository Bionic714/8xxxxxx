This torrent contains the only digital copies I could find of books from the Worlds of Power series of novels (Castlevania II: Simon's Quest, Before Shadowgate, and Mega Man 2).

The Worlds of Power series of books were novels based upon popular third-party Nintendo titles and was published by Scholastic in the early 90's.

I personally reformatted Castlevania II and Before Shadowgate (as they existed as a word document and a text dump on a website respectively) and converted them into EPUB format using Sigil.

Mega Man 2 is a scan compiled into a PDF file. I did not scan or create this file, but I am redistributing it so that others may enjoy it.

If you find any of the other books in the series, let me know in the comments and I will add them.

Enjoy! :)
