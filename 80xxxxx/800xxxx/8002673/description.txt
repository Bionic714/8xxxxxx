Show Info:

Chris Hardwick revisits some of the greatest and most shameful stunts from Attack of the Show history. Remember all the Guinness World Records that we broke? Or the Wiffle Bat Fight Club? And who could forget Olivia Munn's infamous pie jump?

Notes:

I was expecting Eclipse to come out with his caps of AOTS but nothing has come out these past few days. We'll have to settle for the OzQuant caps. At least it's something. Thanks OzQuant.
