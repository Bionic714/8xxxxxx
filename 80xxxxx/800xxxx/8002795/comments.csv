,weaping_reaper,2013-01-12T10:12Z,"Is a ""BRrip"" and a ""BDRip"" the same thing? If not, Elaborate."
[V],scene4all,2013-01-12T21:26Z,"@weaping_reaper, BDRip is a rip that is straight from a Bluray Disc whereas a BRRip is a rip that has been re-encoded from the 720p/1080p Bluray (mkv file)."
,Shell71,2013-01-13T21:57Z,Hi I'm semi new to this and your torrents usually work really well for me .But half way through this one I'm getting the volume shut off and the screen reads something like i'm not allowed to play the movie on this device ( I'm playing it on my ps3 through my computer and even made a disc to see if this would work) am I doing something wrong.. Thank you so much for the uploads we do enjoy them.
,Meg-ha,2013-01-14T07:53Z,thanks!
,mikeb104,2013-01-14T23:18Z,Thanks for saving me from a wasted download. what you are seeing is the Cinavia protection that is encoded in the soundtrack. Certain blu ray rips and I believe many cam rips cannot be watched on PS3
,Shell71,2013-01-15T03:02Z,"Thank you mikeb104 ,so is that just a ps3 thing because I threw the disc away I made ."
,buggedoutbird,2013-01-16T17:51Z,@ shel and mike..it plays fine with all sound on my reg dvd player..but sound goes out on PS3
,buggedoutbird,2013-01-16T18:08Z,wait disregard that last comment. it works as i skipped chapters to check..but once i started playing it about 20 mins in the sound went out even with reg dvd player :(

,Kapri25,2013-02-24T23:01Z,For those with a Cinivia issue or better yet...those that seem to have issues with movies like this that deals with Sony or PS3...well the only way to correct the issue is get a different brand of dvd player. For now that is all I know on how to fix the problem. 
,JoelisaH,2013-02-28T05:15Z,Thank you.

,jarcemo,2013-03-05T21:47Z,"Thnx to the uploader! Movie was OK as i expected it to be! Storyline is intelligent and entertaining and acters were OK! I usually watch all the movies at film.greyfade.net because they have HD's but they didn't have this one so im happy to have piratebay :) Good torrent quality - A9 V9,"
,ViolentC,2013-03-17T12:26Z,"Please don't tell TPB that it wont work on your CONSOLE. Nowhere on TPB are there instructions telling you to burn the movie and try and watch it on a gaming console. NOWHERE... 
a PC plugs directly into a  HDTV with a HDMI cable.
Simply download and watch. no burning required. If your PC does not have HDMI output simply update your video card. (Much cheaper than buying a console)
PS3 and XBOX run on technology over 8 years old. you wouldn't buy an 8 year old computer, so why do people still buy those like they are new..."
