I usually watch all the movies at film.raeshashop.com because they have HD's but they didn't have this one so im happy to have piratebay :) Good torrent quality - A9 V9,"

I'm assuming you aren't saying that it was actually YOU that made that list..as the authors of aforementioned list are Katey Rich and Eric Eisenberg...here's the link in case you forgot where you plagiarized it from :

I wouldn't normally bother commenting on something like this, but I'm not a fan of ppl claiming something's theirs that isn't...no matter how irrelevant the item is"
