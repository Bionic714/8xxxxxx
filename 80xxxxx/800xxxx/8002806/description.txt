ALL IN THE FAMILY ( 197? )

One of several entirely unrelated porn flicks with this title, this
lower-than-low-budget version apparently dates back to sometime in the
1970s. Not exactly cinematic brilliance, but enthusiastic performances
and  plenty of fun, particularly for fans of porn from that era.

For the unsure there's a preview that runs about four minutes
and samples several places in the movie.

======================================================================

The original version of this, which you can find here and there on the
net, is quite dull and dark.  I did what I could with the color
within the limitations of the original source and the amount of
time I have to devote to such things. For the curious, along with
the screens image there's one with before-and-afters of the
same thumbnails.  The audio had some radical variations in level
so I did a little to try to even that out.
