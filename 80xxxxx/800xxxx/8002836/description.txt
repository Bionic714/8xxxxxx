Wicked Tuna Season 1 
Fishing is a hard life, and harder with bluefin stocks depleted. In Gloucester, Massachusetts, there's a special breed of fishermen. For generations they've used rod and reel to catch the elusive bluefin tuna. They depend on these fish for their livelihood, and the competition is brutal.
Over the next 10 weeks, the most skilled fishermen will set out in the frigid waters of the North Atlantic in hopes of catching the valuable bluefin tuna. When one bluefin can bring in as much as $20,000-they'll do whatever it takes to hook up.




6)  Man v Storm 
With an intense storm bearing down, only a few are brave enough to risk their lives at sea. But will they win the battle against Mother Nature and land a monster or succumb to her powerful ways?
