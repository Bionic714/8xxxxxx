,V1RotateV2,2013-01-13T00:49Z,"HEY GUYS! Finally I've been able to make run 1301 FULLY, VFR-enabled, under IOS 6.0.1 and app v2.0, using Diskaid v5.43!

- Erase JEPP FD application and download it from APPLE store.
- Open it once, without having updated anything.
- Close it completely (with X)
- Copy only TermCharts from 1301.
- Erase 'Enroute' Charts folder (whatever you find in Documents)
- Copy 'Enroute' Charts folder from 1213.
- Copy OVER PREVIOUS FOLDER, Enroute Charts from 1301.
- If you want to enable VFR Terminal Charts, create your own airportlist.bin file (need jepp.exe application and JeppView for Windows)
- Overwrite the older airportlist.bin with newer one in TermCharts
- Copy FROM ""C:ProgramData/Jeppesen/Common/TerminalCharts"" TO your IPAD folder ""JeppFD/Documents/data/TermCharts""
theese files: vfrcharts.bin, vfrchrts.dbf, vfrntms.dbf and vfrntms.dbt.

* Note 1: vfrcharts.bin must be writen in LOWERCASE letters, NOT IN CAPITALS.
* Note 2: Google to find jepp.exe application and it's manual.

Voila! FULL JeppFD ;-) "

,cya320,2013-01-16T13:24Z,"I seem to be having a problem with the enroute charts. They are not working. When I re-install the previous cycle, the enroute charts are back. I have tried 4 cycles and they all work except this one. The terminal charts work fine. "
