,dahaka47,2013-01-10T13:48Z,"Nice fake. 1.3.2 has not been released, it doesn't even exist.

Proof:

http://forums.gearboxsoftware.com/showthread.php?t=150758

Also, if you look at the game version at ""Find Games"" screen, you will clearly see 1.3.1.

You're a VIP uploader, shouldn't you be checking what you upload?"
,pakov15,2013-01-10T14:34Z,i've just installed borderlands 2 skidrow.then i installed this update.game doesn't work...i don't have steam installed. game only works with the 3dm crack..anyone help please
,Beelzy,2013-01-10T14:52Z,"It's an update to the not working 1.3.1 (https://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8001554/Borderlands.2.v1.3.1.Update-SKIDROW) and it seems to work fine here, so thanks a lot and kudos on the hard work :)"
,Machine4578,2013-01-10T14:59Z,"@dahaka47

this is not fake!!! this is actually the hotfix for v1.3.1 from SKIDROW(SKIDROW IS JUST STUPID LIKE YOU) so next time before commenting learn how to find out when scene groups release their games and updates... you fucking idiot!!!!"
,kelvinkeh,2013-01-10T15:45Z,"@Machine4578

What if later on Gearbox releases another new official v1.3.2? Then this patch will be definitely fake.. if it is fixed version from 1.3.1, should just stated cleary.. =="
,Machine4578,2013-01-10T17:05Z,"@kelvinkeh 

OMG!!! this is how SKIDROW labeled this release... im sure it will be nuked for mis-labeling.. but if gearbox does release an official update v1.3.2 why would this be fake??? its still a real v1.3.1 hotfix just mis-labeled!!!"
,theshop,2013-01-10T17:08Z,"@pakov15

You have to have a steam registry to emulate having steam installed on your computer.  Or just install steam.

To just get the registry, make a new text file and copy and paste the following:

Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREWow6432NodeValveSteam]
""InstallPath""=""C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam""

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESoftwareValveSteam]
""InstallPath""=""C:\Program Files\Steam""

Save the text file as steamreg.reg file and double click on it."
,pakov15,2013-01-10T17:34Z,@theshop i've installed a cracked version of steam applied the patch...WORKS LIKE A CHARM!!!!!thanks a lot....
,ASD2010ASD,2013-01-10T20:12Z,"Hi the Update is on skidrow site so give the man a break ok he didn't labeled it him self go and check it out (skidrowgames,net/borderlands-2-v1-3-2-update-skidrow)
keep up the the good work +1"
,OmniNegro,2013-01-10T22:48Z,"Fuck. Why does Skidrow have to ruin the numbering of patches to cover for a fucking mistake?

Own up to your fuckup and call this 1.3.1 Crackfix.

Or continue to be pussies with the likes of this shit.
(Database error. Sorry if this doubles.)"
,DemiAngelX,2013-01-11T00:59Z,"I'm just glad to see that Skidrow is trying to correct their mistakes, better than not at all. Much respect guys, thanks for the upload."
,mallemall017ri,2013-01-11T04:54Z,Does this work with the noSTEAM version of the game? The noSTEAM version stops working after you launch it.
,emdeec,2013-01-11T07:57Z,"Download it.. rename the archive 1.3.1.. and the bitching's over.



Geezus.. sometime you children amaze me.

Thanks op."
,tofumunch,2013-01-11T12:08Z,i don't know why but after installing this update the game became quite laggy to the point that it's almost annoying. hope i'm not the only one. 
,dahaka47,2013-01-11T17:16Z,"@ Machine4578 

Ah yes... Its not a fake 1.3.2 version, it is just 1.3.1 introduced as 1.3.2. And.... How doesn't that make it a ""fake 1.3.2""?"
,emisansev,2013-01-11T18:05Z,"People, I have a solution for the win 8 crash:

you need the VERY LAST win8 fix

rghost net/42877197

With the previous version of it the game kept crashing all the time after this update from Skidrow, now it just works."
,Machine4578,2013-01-11T23:50Z,"@dahaka47 

LOL!!! you need to learn the difference between ""fake"" and ""mis-labeled""...because this is the ""real"" scene release by SKIDROW that they MIS-LABELED!!!!"
,DemiAngelX,2013-01-12T12:22Z,"@Machine4578

What difference does it really fucking make, honestly? Is a single misspell really worth PMS'ing and bleeding over? Just sit the fuck down and enjoy the badass game you got for free."
,surenzxx,2013-01-13T22:20Z,Is anyone else having a crash when using LAN? It worked with the patch before 1.2.2. Does anyone know how to fix it?
,XtraZoom,2013-01-13T23:46Z,"Not working for me. I already have steam installed and updated latest updates for windows. It still crashed.

Running Win 8 Pro 64 bit FYI"
,XtraZoom,2013-01-13T23:52Z,@emisansev thanks for the Winderlands8.dll Now it finally runs
,davespen,2013-01-14T02:16Z,"Definitely makes 1.3.1 work, however seems to break LAN."
,dman8479,2013-01-14T13:45Z,Like davespen said it works but plz need a lan fix asap plzzzz
,dman8479,2013-01-14T13:47Z,like davespen said it works but plzz need a lan fix asap
,Beelzy,2013-01-15T08:16Z,"If one supports by buying the real game, can you then transfer characters from the cracked version to the real version of the game?"
,Bladedone,2013-01-29T00:19Z,"@Beelzy Fortunately yes. I'm not certain if it will be the same if it were Retail, but through Steam, you will have to transfer a few files (Located in your /Documents/My Games/Borderlands 2/WillowGame/SaveData) from one folder with a mess of numbers, to the other that lacks the content. Other than that, do that, and reload your BL2 game with your previous profile and character saves. You're good to go.

Downloading this now for a friend of mine who can't afford the game ATM. Works like a charm via Tunngle LAN while personally owning a copy on Steam!"
,_-Kaotik-_,2013-01-31T02:21Z,Game works.  LAN does not.
,noekk,2013-02-01T00:26Z,Does this install a Win 8 fix ? Thanks.
,The_Sound,2013-02-02T01:15Z,It worked perfect. Thanks.
,kvrtz,2013-02-08T02:33Z,"Hey, for some reason this is not working for me, i mean, i follow the instructions and all but after the installation of the update my game version is still 1.0.28.697606. I had never installed any previous update, just the borderlands 2 skidrow torrent. Any hints?"
,Jiggaa,2013-02-14T23:33Z,"when i click to run lan, the game freezes and then memory leaks until it crashes "
,Jiggaa,2013-02-14T23:59Z,"mediafire dot com/download.php?2z671tq22wetdmu
Thanks to ghost, this stops the crash for me.

 Can people with skidrow play with people that have a legit copy? It says version missmatch even though he has 1.3.1..."
,EbilPhish,2013-02-15T03:59Z,"Is this actually from SKIDROW?, the last scene version listed on orlydb is 1.2.2. http://orlydb.com/s/games?q=borderlands+update"
,1357911,2013-02-16T21:49Z,LAN doesn't work
,ccb26,2013-02-17T23:54Z,Why does this break LAN play?
,Azefir1,2013-03-28T15:08Z,http://cs.rin.ru/forum/download/file.php?id=12425 it should fix the lan problem
