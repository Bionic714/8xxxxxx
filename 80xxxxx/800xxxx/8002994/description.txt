"...the debut EP by ku─ìka might well be one of the most intriguing and ambitious releases by a Perth artist IΓÇÖve encountered" Alex Griffin, Life is Noise

An eclectic combination of delicate, ambient sounds, industrial glitches and captivating vocal layering structured with heavy bass and erratic beats. 
Music transcends from alluring and soft textures to melancholic darkness, focusing on melody and subjective beauty.
An aural surrealist, ku─ìkaΓÇÖs hypnotic compositions lull the mind into faraway and blissfully strange realms.
