Bimbotech is the successful result of mind control by her boyfriend, who only a year ago was lonely, but enterprising. He took a course in hypnotism, and quickly became proficient. After practicing on his pet dog with excellent results, he convinced his dog it was a cat, a remarkable achievement. The he turned his attention to the girl at the antiques shop, a good looking girl who had no interest in an ugly guy with a paunch and a spotty face like him. He was interested in her, and had a secret crush on her. So in her shop he asked to handle a gold granddad pocket watch with a long chain. He dangled it in front of her face and asked her to examine it and tell him the price. As soon as her eyes focused on the watch, he had her mesmerized. She was in his control, a perfect use of technique, which he used to create his own bimbo. His first order was for her to stop working and go shopping for slutty clothes. Then he sent her to work in a gogo bar, where she happily serviced men all day and night, only to return home to cook and wash for her new true love. Watch the movie, appreciate the technique of the bimbo.
