 In the 1960's, even Pakistan was swinging!     
 To prove it, here's this amazing version       
 of the Dracula story from 1967. So hot         
 it was banned on its original release.         
 The only Pakistani film ever to be rated "X"   
 in its country of origin, this sizzling little 
 gem is also the first Dracula film to include  
 the shocking "baby stealing" scene.            
 This first ever official release,              
 taken from the only surviving negative.        
 Zinda Laash - The Living Corpse - is a film    
 so rare that even the most exhaustive studies  
 of vampire films don't mention it.             
 Although the film caused a sensation on        
  its release back in the 1960's, it was        
 banned and all but forgotten...until now!
