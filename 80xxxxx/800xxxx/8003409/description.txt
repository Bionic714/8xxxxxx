setupcomplete.cmd phase online integration
IE9-KB2761465 (IE security dec2012 update)
KB2533552 (A windows update future pre-requisite sp2 perhaps)
KB2506143 (Part of Windows Management Framework 3.0 online update)
Reboot for System updating

Changes from Dec2012:
1) Had to drop Net4.5 pre-install.  It has some problems in the
redistributable that require a patch that is larger than the
redist. Said patch creates a loop effect with windows update
so I cannot include it. Windows update download does work,
and does not loop, so you can download net 4.5 anytime
and update it with windows update just fine.

2) Pre-Activation is BACK!!! I thought about a solution that might
work for both proponents and opponents of Windows Loader and came up
with a 2 index system by copying the scripts folder to the 2 different
installs rather than trying to use the same oem folder with the same
setupcomplete.cmd script. Windows Loader 2.2 is included in the
Pre-Activation index. (It's labeled)
