,dafufu,2013-01-14T06:19Z,thanks for the upload! 
,beserke1,2013-01-15T03:33Z,thx! any chance we could get the deck keys or some other fix to unlock all the decks? it is way too tedious and time-consuming to play 300+ matches to unlock all the cards in the decks.
,Jona198102,2013-01-16T00:56Z,"I'm using the THETA release, the SE.

I also applied the 2 available updates on Rlslog. Search for ""magic the gathering"" on the site.

For me, the decks were completely unlocked once I plugged the files into the game directory.

I never needed the unlock keys."
,Jona198102,2013-01-16T01:00Z,"I just remembered, if you go to ""Deck Manager"" and click ""unlock deck"" then quit and restart the game, it should unlock the full deck. I did have to do that for some of them."
,jimbo273,2013-01-16T10:27Z,"i dl both of your deck pack , but i think this one is deck pack 4 , and the other one is pack 2 and 3 because of the file name , how about pack 1 ? and does this mean this is the Ravnica expansion?"
,Jona198102,2013-01-16T13:50Z,Yes. The Ravnica expansion is in a THETA update on Rlslog. That's the 2013 Expansion on Steam.
,Jona198102,2013-01-16T13:51Z,"Just to be clear, since the Return to Ravnica expansion was in one of the earlier THETA releases, it's not included in the deck packs here."
,levas12,2013-01-16T15:49Z,The card Allied Strategies in Mana Mastery deck seems to be bugged and at least for me doesn't work at all (I get to cast it and pay mana cost but no effect occurs even though the animation plays through)
,Jona198102,2013-01-16T16:21Z,"@levas12

No idea what might be wrong. I have cast that card many times and it's worked every time."
,levas12,2013-01-16T16:52Z,Well maybe the problem is at my end then :/ I will try to fix also could you be so kinda and post a link to where I could get the first deck pack ( Ravnica)
,jimbo273,2013-01-16T19:10Z,"guess i have no choice to get theta version of return to ravnica , anyway i have the same problem with allied strategies too  , after using it i no cards are drawn  but it consumes my mana still"
,levas12,2013-01-16T20:40Z,Well it's good to know that the problem is not at my end ;/
,Jona198102,2013-01-17T13:13Z,"I am using the THETA release. TPB doesn't seem to like links. You'll need to go to Rlslog and search the site for ""magic the gathering"". There should be 3 things for DOTP 2013. The main Special Edition torrent and 2 updates."
,PADDYWHACKED,2013-01-27T20:22Z,I downloaded this and copied over the files in it but the decks didnt show up when i actually started playing
,jimbo273,2013-02-01T12:50Z,"when is the gatecrash coming to pc ? i keep getting the wrong info as google searches keep giving me the wrong platform or it gives me info about the original card game you play in real life , is there a site that you use ?"
,jimbo273,2013-02-02T20:16Z,"sorry nvm , :D i was confused , turns out that the update on deck pack you have been uploading is the gatecrash release"
,darone9,2013-04-08T11:26Z,"Do you have other deck packs, and wher can I download it. Thanx for upload"
,darone9,2013-04-08T11:29Z,"Did you upload other deck packs, where can I download it and thanx for upload."
,Jona198102,2013-04-09T14:14Z,"@darone9
