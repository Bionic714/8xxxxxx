,Newb787,2013-01-13T22:56Z,"Fail! Activation is only 29 days. You *may* improve your chances by hacking and tinkering further in the KMSano readme.

Also, a file is added that keeps your CPU running high: qemu-system-i386.

I suggest waiting until we have better activators and or the MSDN or Blue version. "

Does anyone have a real fucking office activator for 2013!?"
[V],murphy78,2013-01-14T10:59Z,"Arkenstone has helped me out quite a lot on my windows 8 kms activation stuff, and with kmsnano there are a few things you should know...

Firstly, it is sometimes picky with activation, but mostly because it doesn't have very many checks.  It's a very small program with a compressed hard drive taking up most of the file.

For those having issues installing this, I recommend uninstalling, running a system cleanup utility for uninstalls, and then re-install.

MS is notorious for leaving registry settings for activation and such after uninstalling, and if it has the wrong product key in your system, or has some sort of issue stopping it from activating to volumekms, it won't work.

Normal online kms servers aren't nearly as picky, but that's because they don't use exactly the same software as a super tiny emulated machine in a zip file.

Feel free to figure out how to activate office using slmgr and ospp commands if you want to use normal kms servers.  There are no cracks as far as I am aware.

/salute arken"
[V],murphy78,2013-01-14T22:36Z,"running admin command prompt command ""sfc /scannow"" can fix some activation problems.  Many people assume that it just fixes overwritten system files, but it does also fix inconsistencies in your activation.  I think the majority of problems people have with office activation are also on windows setups that are a bit fubar and haven't been scanned.

Just a tip for you Officeites, scan it if you can't get activation to work."

I ran KMS and checked the status of my Office. It was still not activated and KMS was still running in the background. I kill the process from task manager and ran the KMS again. It was not in the Process list after 4-5 seconds. I check the status of Office 2013 and it was activated.

,lamportyx,2013-01-17T00:34Z,for me this was easy! first i run the kms nano application. then simply it will disappear then i extract the kms nano application with winrar. into a new folder so that the content will not be scattered anywhere else. this time i click on manual cmd file then i wait for about less than a minute. the script just pops out stating that both my windows 8 and office 2013 are activated for 180 days.

,tuurdsfuh,2013-01-17T23:54Z,"I had to mess with this a lot to get it to work. This is exactly what I did and the only way I could get it to work.

Extracted the LaNanov11.zip
Then extracted the KMSnano.exe (right click to extract, don't launch it) into the same spot.

I ran in cmd:
cdProgram FilesMicrosoft OfficeOffice15
cscript ospp.vbs /inpkey:YC7DK-G2NP3-2QQC3-J6H88-GVGXT
cscript ospp.vbs /sethst:kms.shmtu.edu.cn

Ran KMSnano.exe
Ran manual.cmd and input kms.shmtu.edu.cn instead of IP.

I don't know if the cmd part was necessary but that's what I did and it worked."

[V],murphy78,2013-01-22T00:25Z,"For those with win7 having a problem activating just office, heldigard has info in the text file regarding skipping trying to activate windows.

The actual quote is:
""In case you dont want activate one product use the arguments: /noWin, /no2010 and /no2013 arguments to KMSELDI.exe and edit the Manual_Silent.cmd""

So add the /noWin and /no2010 arguments to the kmseldi line in Manual_Silent.cmd and try running said cmd.  If that doesn't work you probably need to run a command prompt ""sfc /scannow""  That will check all of your system files, including activation files.  If it bugs out your windows loader, just re-install it."

,xavi3r666,2013-02-22T05:04Z,"Hi everybody!

I came here to share this activation method which helped me to activate both office 2010 and 2013.

1. U need to have both office 2010 and 2013, u can get it here obviously :)

2. First of all, install and activate office 2010, then open any file in order to save the configurations about updates ( I usually don`t install updates).

3. After doing this, go to your folder where u have office 2013 and install it. 
It will ask you if u wanna update, just click ""OK"" or ""continue"". Wait until the installation finish.

4. After the office 2013 installation has finished, it will ask you to reboot. After rebooting,  try to open any office file, just to be sure the installation is correct.

5. Another reboot might be necessary after u open your office file.

6. Once again after reboot open the office file, go to: 
File>Office account>About Microsoft office. There you can notice your office is already activated. 

7. Enjoy it. 

IMPORTANT: I didn't logged in with my office account (and I would never) so I am not sure if this makes any important change in order to activate your office. But u are welcome to try this on your own risk.

As I said b4, this helped me to activate office 2010, but i started to install office 2007 first and then made the upgrade to office 2010 following the same method.

Hope this can help to everybody

Long live TPB "
