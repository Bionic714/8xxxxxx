Thank you"
,TheLahnik,2013-01-10T20:07Z,I'm actually getting 12% on the Wineskin torrent now. Testing this one to see if it gets past 9.30%
,TheLahnik,2013-01-10T20:29Z,"Nah, this one doesnt work. Stop's at 9.30% again.
The other Wineskin torrent is at 12.6% with around 400kb/s though. Sometimes it goes down again, but sometimes it gets up there.
I'd say use: http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7988762/Far_Cry_3_Mac_[Wineskin]"
