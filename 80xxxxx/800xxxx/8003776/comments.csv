Upon downloading and viewing , it is the TRUE story of Elvis if that's what you might be after, it is an old video (one of the producers died in 1996) and is just a buttered up version painting him as a real clean cut guy who was a great influence.  Mentions the drugs for about 5 seconds, with no coverage at all on his other bad whacko behavior.   "
