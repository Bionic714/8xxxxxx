,higherleopards,2013-01-13T01:20Z,"@aliendna99: Why don't you try finding out on the play store, which checks for compatibility before rendering results, or try google? Do you need someone to hold your hand? At any rate looks like I'm one of two people seeding this. And I know your not that person. "
,aliendna99,2013-01-15T17:33Z,"@higherleopards. Sir, are you a retarded person? What does google or play store tell me about THIS version in this torrent? Bah, I dont even bother discussing it with you, you are obviously intelligent as a woodworm."

By the way, the game has some graphic bugs."
