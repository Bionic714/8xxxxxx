I recently bought a Xperia Play and I couldn't hesitate in getting games for it. I found this file on a random website and I want to share it with you guys, so you have to spare time.


How it works:

- Transfer "com.sony..." folder on SD CARD TO /ANDROID/DATA
- Transfer Castlevania.apk to the root of the SD card.


Enjoy!
