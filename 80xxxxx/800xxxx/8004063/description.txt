Kristin Asbjørnsen is a Norwegian singer and composer.

“The night shines like the day” is the first album totally based on Kristin’s own lyrics and music.
The music is a powerful, mesmerizing beautiful exploration; quiet and intense, with an incredibly strong awareness in the way Kristin is approaching the songs. It’s soulful music that flows, touchingly grounded in Kristin’s unique voice.
This album is all about loss and belonging – a journey of hope, embrace and transforming moments of life.
Kristin wrote the songs at the piano; but along the way the music developed within a haunting and distinctive ensemble sound, where West-African guitars blend creatively with the cello and piano.
