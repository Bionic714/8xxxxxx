,CyberPlague,2013-05-12T16:41Z,"to change the laguage. Find the launcher file in BmGame-config-launcher. Then

- Edit Launcher.ini located in batmanBmGameConfig folder
- Search for [Launcher.CultureMap] section
- Put a semi-colon before each line in this section except ""default=Int"" and ""en=Int"". This section should now looks like:
Code:
default=Int
en=Int
;fr=Fra
;it=Ita
;de=Deu
;es=Esn
;es-MX=Esm
;pl=Pol
;ru=Rus
;pt=Por
- Save the file

Now your launcher and the game are in english.



Also change UserEngine.ini, open, change RUS to, Int"
