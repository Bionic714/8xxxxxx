,ron99,2013-01-15T18:05Z,"If your game is russian, simply delete the _russian files from game folder. It has worked for me so far"
,Koetsier,2013-01-16T11:22Z,"beso140, first of all thanks for the upload!

But I have installed it with English subs/sound settings, and in the game everything is selected to english. I've even deleted the 6 russian files in win32 folder.

But I just hear voices at the intro song, with subtitles, than when the game starts in the cage, I hear no sound and see no subtitles. How can I solve this?"
,sigint13,2013-01-18T20:42Z,"Well, nice job it almost works properly. Almost. The only problem (so far) is when I try to save manually the saving icon doesn't disappear and if I try to save again it says ""you can't save during autosave"" Any ideas?"
,sigint13,2013-01-18T20:50Z,My problem is when I try to save the saving icon doesn't disappear and I doesn't save either. Solution?

,BloonWars,2013-01-20T05:42Z,"I'm also stuck with the Russian.  I've deleted the Russian files from the game folder... I'm wondering if I'm able to navigate my way past the start screen and actually start the game if it will continue in Russian?

I'm pretty new at all of this so please let me/us know if you find something that works short of us downloading Rosetta Stone - Russian."
,BloonWars,2013-01-20T05:57Z,"Also, what are the files under ""bin>resources>de,se,fr,it,us...""?

,biteme1011,2013-01-26T07:15Z,"To get the game in english you have to download the english files from here and install them in the game directory, then you have to delete the russian files and go into the registry editor and change Russian to English and RUS to ENG. These steps all have to be done and then you will have the audio and subtitles and texts all in english!"
,voyer501,2013-03-23T18:45Z,is this the full game??
