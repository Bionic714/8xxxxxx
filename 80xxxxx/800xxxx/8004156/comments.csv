,minime93ireland,2013-01-11T01:01Z,For some reason I just don't feel like I should download anything from someone with the word scam in their name.
,ScamN2,2013-01-11T02:09Z,"@minime93ireland   I might have uploaded a dud once, but I've never uploaded a trojan or virus.
BTW TPB, my apologies about the multicore environment upload. As I said initially, I was new at torrenting. "
,ScamN2,2013-01-11T06:53Z,"Is It working TPB?
No daps, No Affirmatives, No appreciation?
No comments?
At least post a comment that it's legit."
