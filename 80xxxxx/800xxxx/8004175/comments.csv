,powerman123,2013-01-11T03:03Z,Does this have spammy watermarks on them or r they uncut?
,killbat,2013-01-11T03:26Z,Thank YOU!!! 
,cheater71,2013-01-11T03:39Z,"Sadly it does have a small watermark in the upper left corner. I wish i could find the episodes without the watermark, but at the moment I'm just happy to have them at all."
,Mellow129,2013-01-11T17:06Z,"Thank you cheater71!
Watermark or not, please upload them if you get more dubs.
Much appreciated."
,radicool123,2013-01-12T00:11Z,"Regarding quality (some vary):

580 by 322 resolution
300 kbps video bitrate
64 kbps audio bitrate (stereo)
Roughly 60MB per file
.mp4 format

But I have never seen a high quality video with just low specs. Rather impressed. Don't let the file size or specs doubt this torrent."

Amazing quality for the given specs though (no joke I was suprised too). 8/10"
