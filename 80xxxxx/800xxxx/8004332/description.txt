 DUTTA VS DUTTA is hilarious,dramatic,passionate
 film about people and time that once was very  
 real.About a period in Kolkata's history that  
 was very real.Basically a coming of age film   
 about a crazy father and equally crazy son,    
 This film celebrates the 70s,celebrates the    
 idiosyncratic Bengali who were once rich,      
 westerneized,very permissive,lusty,rebellious  
 ahead of time and dreamers.DUTTA VS SUTTA is a 
 fun filled tribute to this Bengali.
