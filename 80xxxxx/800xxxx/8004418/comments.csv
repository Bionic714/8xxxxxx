,alquimico,2013-03-27T14:28Z,"Hi there Darkreverser, is there a new version of Micro XP, called ""Micro XP Pro 1.11 International"" ?

""Micro XP Pro 1.11 International Released. Documentation to be released at a later time. With this build, I wanted to eliminate as many bugs as possible, re-evaluate all past decisions, polish every file, limit the causes of bugs and create a release suitable to all. Simply put, everything is updated and polished. Next release will be a Windows 8 Performance/Reliability guide along with scripts/tweak files. ETA, several months.

From the creator of Micro XP Pro 1.07, 
DarkReverser Presents: 

Micro XP Pro 1.11 International 

The slimmest most functional, fastest, most secure copy of XP you can find on the planet. 
This is my last release of Micro XP Pro 32bit. ""

This taked from:
http://www.alldownsoft.com/2013/01/download-micro-xp-pro-latest-versions.html

But when i download i get the exactly same iso file of Micro XP Pro 1.11b:

en_windows_xp_professional_with_service_pack_3_x86_cd_vl_x14-73974.iso

so there is no new version of this excelent xp?
would be nice to have a 64bit version of w7 or w8! Thanks!"
