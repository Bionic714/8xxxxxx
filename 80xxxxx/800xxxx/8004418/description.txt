[b]Instructions[/b]

Extract with Winrar 4.20.

Let's customize the ISO to you.
Are you going to be sharing files or printers in a network, if so choose the workgroup tweak or no tweaks.
Do you require everything to work "out of the box", or are you a beginner, if so choose no tweaks.
Is this purely a gaming system, you desire upmost performance and security and know what services are in XP, if so choose the regular tweaks.
Now that you've made your choice, go ahead and open the Iso with MagicISO or UltraISO.
Go into i386, now go back to your download folder and select the tweak file you picked, now drag it over, it will for overwrite now say yes.  Click Save.

Time to burn
Burn with imgburn or you're favorite burning software with the verification option checked.

Configure your BIOS
Restart your computer, keep pressing repeadedly the del button, this will get you into bios.
Find the boot options, and pick whatever optical drive Micro XP Pro is in.

Choose your partition and the rest of the setup is automatic.
Note you do not need to activate Micro XP Pro; no I did not crack it, I removed the activation component.
Note, despite this Microsoft will recognise Micro XP Pro as genuine, and it will work all Microsoft software such as Microsoft Office, Security Essentials etc.

[b]Languages[/b]
Please use the following language pack:
Please download this language pack for additional languages:
Create a system restore point before use, oherwise you may not be able to go back to your original language.
It's a clean, but stuborn language pack; the language you choose will stick :)

[b]Warranty[/b]
Micro XP Pro will install with "easy install" from VMware, but much of what makes this release great will not be installed.  Google "easy install vmware" for more information.
No warranty is offered to those who modify this ISO.  
Micro XP Pro works great in virtual machines, but drivers in this environment are often not stable; virtual machines are imperfect emulators.
In Virtual Machines, software like Alcohol 120% and Daemon Tools which install drivers will not function properly.
Make sure you pick the tweak file that is for you, see "Let's customize the ISO to you"
It is recommend to use Windows Update via Internet Explorer 8
