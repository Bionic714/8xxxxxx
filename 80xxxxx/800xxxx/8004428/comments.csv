,ZoolooCH,2013-01-13T19:21Z,"Ah, a non XviD version. Thank you!"
,WaltCD,2013-01-15T02:47Z,"FANtastic!
The DVDRip was great quality video AND sound. As it is a foreign film, it had subtitles in English, but also Dutch, Hungarian, Portuguese and Spanish.

The movie is an MKV file and I used DIVX Player Plus to play it on my Mac. It worked flawlessly!"
