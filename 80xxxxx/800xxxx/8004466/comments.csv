,lobalt,2013-01-12T00:02Z,Does this affect the ability to keep downloading legit apps? I heard the first W8 hack made issues with legit app downloads alongside crackle ones
,bg4545,2013-01-15T03:46Z,I haven't had any issues downloading legit apps even with cracked ones.
,puga831,2013-01-17T17:09Z,"Kept getting ...""The executable program that this service is configured to run in does not implement the service""
what worked for me was
1. opened TokensExtractor.exe tried to crack trial app and failed 
(Test licence could not be installed. Did you install WSServiceCrk ?)
2. ran wscrack_64 installer.exe as admin and clicked uninstall
3. while still on the program clicked install (WSService crack was successfully installed !)
4. went to wscrack_anycpu TokensExtractor.exe
5. Clicked on Bruteforce tokens.dat 
6. Selected (trial) app and pressed Crack it !  (Cracked !)"
