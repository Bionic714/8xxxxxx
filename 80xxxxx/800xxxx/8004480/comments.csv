Just wondering though, ive downloaded the torrent file with ""vuze"" which has stored on my computer as an ""OGG"" file.. how do i download these torrents to listen to them in mp3 format??

Thanks again "

No problem.

Its in the ogg vorbis audio format, not mp3 :)
You can play it with almost any mediaplayer out there, although if you have a mac and use itunes you need a plugin from xiph:

If you use a android smartphone its supported from start, just play the ogg file in any audioplayer.

If you are using windows i recommend vlc:
