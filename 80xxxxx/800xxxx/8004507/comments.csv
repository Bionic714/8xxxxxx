,Xpenguin,2013-01-13T09:38Z,"It's hard to say, a lot of complications have occurred in the past 6 months since our lead coordinator kicked me out of our group and we've lost access to his pricey servers that seeded all our torrents 24/7.

Our 3 most recent torrents took 2 full days to upload on our home connection, so things don't look too good.

The South Park Seasons 9-16 are finished albeit not finalized, but it's hard to say how this it will turn out. Being ridiculously kicked out of my own group, the boss has announced the task to someone else and will likely be releasing it under the same XP17 name, probably on Demonoid.

Now, I could give a rats ass about upholding some retarded Internet status, as my purpose is and always has been getting high quality stuff out there and maintaining a strong, free P2P community, so I'm not gonna encourage fanboyism or the boycotting of someone elses attempt to do a quality release.

However, I'm not gonna have my name hijacked if it's gonna be done for the purpose of spreading propaganda like numerous trolls have done in the past under my name.

So be wary of lamers and don't be duped into getting your time wasted."
