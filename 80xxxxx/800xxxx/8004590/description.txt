Rusty Cooley's second instructional release at CFH. This DVD/CD ROM set is your opportunity to learn how Rusty developed his NO-BOUNDARIES approach to Pentatonic & Blues scales to become the PENTATONIC MONSTER that he is. Covered are 2, 3, and 4 note per string concepts, legato technique, alternate picking, sweep picking, pickhand tapping with up to 3 fingers, string skipping, and more. This is not your usual "box pattern" pentatonics approach...this is "EXTREME PENTATONICS". The DVD features the 50 minute "RUSTY COOLEY - EXTREME PENTATONICS" video which includes 159 examples (88 examples from the "6 STRING" section, 41 examples from the "7 STRING CONVERSION" section, and 30 examples from "THE LICKS" section). Either watch the entire 50 minute video or use the "Direct Access" menu to access individual examples. Also featured on the accompanying CD ROM is the 100 page PDF file containing the "RUSTY COOLEY - EXTREME PENTATONICS" lesson tab/chart examples.

You would require a VLC Media Player or a compatible one to play the "*.rm" file.

Quality is low because it is an old video.


Enjoy!
