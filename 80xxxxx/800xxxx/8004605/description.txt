Either watch the entire 58 minute video or use the "Direct Access" menu to access individual examples. Also featured on the accompanying CD ROM is the 17 page PDF file containing the "RUSTY COOLEY - SHRED GUITAR MANIFESTO" lesson tab/chart examples.

You would require a VLC Media Player or a compatible one to play the "*.rm" file.

Quality is low because it is an old video.


Enjoy!
