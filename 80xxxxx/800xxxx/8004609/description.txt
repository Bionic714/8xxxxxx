Rusty Cooley's third instructional release at CFH. This DVD / CD ROM set is your ticket for a private lesson with Rusty covering his UNBELIEVABLE alternate picking technique. Included are 3 and 4 note per string concepts utilizing single/double/multiple string licks, string skipping, and more. The DVD features the 40 minute, 70 example "RUSTY COOLEY - THE ART OF PICKING" video. Either watch the entire 40 minute video or use the "Direct Access" menu to access individual examples. Also featured on the accompanying CD ROM is the 36 page "RC3.pdf" file containing the "RUSTY COOLEY - THE ART OF PICKING" lesson tab/chart examples.

You would require a VLC Media Player or a compatible one to play the "*.rm" file.

Quality is low because it is an old video.


Enjoy!
Seed.
