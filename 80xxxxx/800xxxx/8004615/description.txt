Todd Duane's first instructional release at CFH. This CD ROM includes the complete 48 minute "TODD DUANE - SHREDOMANIA" digital video; the accompanying 48 video examples (click here for a sample clip) taken from the "TODD DUANE - SHREDOMANIA" digital video, along with the 50 page PDF file containing the "TODD DUANE - SHREDOMANIA" lesson tab.

You would require a VLC Media Player or a compatible one to play the "*.rm" file.

Quality is low because it is an old video.


Enjoy!
Seed.
