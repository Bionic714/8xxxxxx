It's official that the "New West" era has began. With that being said, it's safe to say SLik d is apart of it. Being one of the younger artist of the movement, SLik has already found his path promoting his Good Vibes sound and image to the people. His sound gives off a very chill, relaxing, positive aura capturing moments in life. Known for warm easy going vocals followed by his smooth flow, listeners find it refreshing to hear what the emcee has to say. Already having a following since 06', it wasn't untill the summer of 09' when his first official EP "Summer Vibes" dropped and gave the people a new taste of hip hop. Bringing the sound of SoCal to life once again was the perfect formula for the 8 track EP. Love was shown from overseas from Brazil all the way back to his home state California and in between. But it did not stop there, his latest LP "Midnight Vibes" gave the followers nothing of what they expected but left them more than satisfied with the tape. Midnight now has theme music thanks to SLik, his response to that "No problemo homie, just spreading the vibes".
