David made his book available online in 2010, in .pdf. Unfortunately, the formatting was terrible. There have been some other copies floating around the internet(in epub or prc). The few copies I could find online, were also plagued with various formatting problems. 

I used an official copy of the book to properly format the paragraphs. I also included the four charts of Appendix 1 (from the original book), along with a hyperlinked TOC. 

The finished job is not "perfect," but I did my best, after many hours work. The imperfections that are there, are minor. 

I hope you enjoy the book. Please leave feedback.
