I can say too that if your using VLC with default settings than usually the player for whatever reason will make select frequencies cut out during certain scenes if you don't have the equalizer turned on, probably for some cinema filter so voices are clearer."

So I really can't take full credit for this torrent, but it just bothered me that no one had released anything like they usual do.  Usually I just download whatever dwjp90 puts out, but yeah, this time there was nothing so I made my own.  I'm not sure what's up with the audio issues.  I noticed that, too, but it's from the sceneline release; nothing I did.  So, you guys are welcome for the file, but thanks also to the original uploader and I hope dwjp90 shows up again soon."
