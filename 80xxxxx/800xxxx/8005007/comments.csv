,bob9001a,2013-01-11T06:00Z,that is a fuck-load of mp3 files
,mykillk,2013-01-11T06:39Z,"I don't want to sound like a jerk because I really appreciate the time you spent ripping the CD version of the audiobook. It sounds infinitely better than the crap Audible puts out.

However, with that said, I must say the way you named the files is really confusing. You used the word chapter in the file name but it does not correlate with the actual chapters in the book."
,bvrsknr,2013-01-11T15:19Z,"really appreciate the upload,been waiting a long time for this one
but I am seeing 135 seeds and 625 peers
but am getting no one actually seeding
come on people don't hit and run on this one
seed !!!"
,omg_666,2013-01-11T17:18Z,"we need more seeders over 53,8% :/ "
,alvasalrey,2013-01-12T04:11Z,"@ mykillk
i completely agree with you , this is just the way the  DRM removal tool named the files as i said i didnt feel like putting in the time to rename and chapterize (i hope thats the word :P) the whole thing i just wanted to listen to it lol i hope is a good start for someone with more time and patience or for those like me that just want to read it now"
,mykillk,2013-01-12T04:24Z,Relax guys it'll take the man a while to upload 4.5 GBs with the kind of upload speeds you get with typical residential internet...
,mykillk,2013-01-12T04:31Z,"@alvasalready

For sure man. What really matters is that the files are in order, which they are."
,jaquiow,2013-01-15T09:48Z,"I couldn't resist listening even though the files were incomplete, and i noticed that at least one of the chapters is from a previous book, wherein Egwene and co. fights in the world of dreams against the black ajah, chapter 8 of part 1, for that one.

What's up with this?"
,HotJonny420,2013-01-18T03:10Z,whos the narrator?
,Deadaus,2013-01-19T15:47Z,"There is nothing incomplete, you might have to check and make sure all the files are playing in correct sequence."
,Torrip,2013-01-30T23:23Z,"The end of file 064 has the standard ""This audiobook has been broken into multiple parts to make the download faster"" announcement, and concludes with ""Audible hopes you have enjoyed this program."" Odd; I thought you said you ripped this?"
,Torrip,2013-01-30T23:30Z,"Also, at the beginning of a few files the concluding seconds of the previous mp3 are repeated. What accounts for this repetition?"
,leetjakis,2013-03-23T18:13Z,"I downloaded this and listened to the whole thing writing down the chapters as they occured, I then converted it to Ipod format with all the right chapters named properly, here is the link to the torrent http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8291848"
