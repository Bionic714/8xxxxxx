Finally the one , the... 14th :P book of The Wheel of Time Series is here , brandon sanderson gives us the conclusion to this amazing series and im glad i can bring it to all of u out there (most of whom i know have waited as eagerly as me)

About this Release:
i barely ripped the CD's in the highest quality i could (or know how) and im uploading it as is , i have just started to listen to it and so far so good no skips no distortions none of that ugly stuff u find in some audiobook torrents, but for a good organization and chapter breakdown i will let someone more skilled (and with more time ) do it

Hope you guys enjoy this please let me know if everithing is ok when u finish listening (i will re-upload if i find problems along the way)
