Nope. read wiki abt 1080p. "" implying a resolution of 1920×1080 (2.1 megapixel) often marketed as Full HD"" which is not always. why? you should learn abt anamorphic - aspect ratio too. and you should understand the problem, including black bars and its connection to full 1920x1080"
,KEWLIOSUCKA,2013-01-12T18:55Z,Directly from the wiki - 1080p is a set of HDTV high-definition video modes characterized by 1080 horizontal lines of vertical resolution.

,killabese,2013-01-27T20:45Z,always download from yifi.  sadly this one has the cineva pop up on ps3.  rarely happens with the other down;loads from him
,JDFS22,2013-01-30T05:22Z,"Who gives a fuck about your ""M""? that's right nobody, your opinion about movies is shit anyway, just give us the A and V and then shut the fuck up, thank you!"
,mrohjeey,2013-02-06T21:23Z,"Well, im no pro at that, but my samsung screen 16:10 screen, 1650x1050p is set as Full HD, 1080p, and besides, things look so much better in 16:10 than 16:9

 giving a V/A after watched it."
,MemphisChik,2013-02-19T15:32Z,Cinavia prevents audio for entire movie when played back on PS3.  Must jump through hoops every 20 minutes to continue hearing movie.  Too much work.  
,dude8888,2013-02-23T22:10Z,"A=7, V=8, M=7
Good quality Bluray rip 
(but the audio is very, very, very low)"
,doudou53100,2013-03-05T17:51Z,"Thnx to the uploader! Movie was OK as i expected it to be! Storyline is intelligent and entertaining and acters were OK! I usually watch all the movies at film.greyfade.net because they have HD's but they didn't have this one so im happy to have piratebay :) Good torrent quality - A9 V9,"
