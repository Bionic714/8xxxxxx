Pros

Given the cons, none. They gave me a full refund instantly, though. Hope they'll fix the problems in the next version.

Cons

Wipes out the entire restore points history once installed and any new restore points thereafter created on a regular basis. Help and/or faq files non existent or inadequate. When an action ends up with an error, it does not give you any clues as to what the error is and what you should do when you get that error message. No or very late (and inefficient) response from Technical Support Team.
