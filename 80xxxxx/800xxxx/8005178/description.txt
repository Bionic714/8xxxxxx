For more than thirty years, Richard P. Feynman's three-volume Lectures on Physics has been known worldwide as the classic resource for students and professionals alike. That text was based on transcriptions of the hundreds of hours of audio recordings made during Feynman's legendary classroom lectures. Now, for the first time on compact disc, the best of these recordings are available in digitally mastered quality. Ranging from the most basic principles of Newtonian physics through such formidable topics as Einstein's general relativity, superconductivity, and quantum mechanics, Feynman's lectures stand as a monument of clear exposition and deep insight. Timeless and collectible, these unabridged lectures are essential listening, not just for students of physics, but for anyone seeking an introduction to the field from the inimitable Richard Feynman. 6 CDs: Total playing time: Approx. 6 hours
