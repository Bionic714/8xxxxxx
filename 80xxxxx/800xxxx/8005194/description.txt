Concepts of Biology by Sylvia S. Mader (1st edition NOT 2ND EDITION).

I had a pretty hard time finding this book but I eventually did so I figured I would propagate it.

*NOTE* When UI initially downloaded it Adobe reader could not open it for some reason. but I used foxit pdf viewer and it worked just fine.
