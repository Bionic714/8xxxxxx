,hmcdoual,2013-01-15T11:05Z,please please please seed!!!
,friaug,2013-01-15T13:23Z,PLEASE SEED! I will seed for a month after i get it myself
,sebolito,2013-01-15T13:53Z,"5,18%"
,friaug,2013-01-16T15:26Z,"God dammit, if you are done downloading it, keep seeding please! I'm stuck on 5% for 3 days now!"
,aryawirads,2013-01-16T15:38Z,please just stop downloading this for a while and let some other people to finish and seed... there are too many leechers
[V],thenoobish,2013-01-16T18:08Z,It's alex3142 that is not willing to seed.
,Pruusis,2013-01-16T20:55Z,"thenoobish, but still why does one upload torrent and not seed?!"
,aryawirads,2013-01-17T10:02Z,for those who have finished downloaing this torrent: what kind of port is this game? cider or wineskin?
,iborn4music,2013-01-18T03:33Z,"Its clear that alex3142 doesnt seed his own torrents. None of them can get started, popularized, and seeded, its all just leechers because the people who first downloaded the torrent dont necessarily seed it. Unfortunately, I am not seeing any seeds so far, so unless someone starts seeding out of random, this torrent may be dead. "
,Pruusis,2013-01-18T07:41Z,i agree with iborn4music
,aryawirads,2013-01-21T12:25Z,can someone please re-upload this torrent?
,BritchiV,2013-01-21T14:44Z,same f***ng problem (( stopped at 5%
,ctw056,2013-01-21T22:18Z,"utorrent is claiming there are 100 seeders, but i am not connecting to any...gaaaah"
,sunrayyyy,2013-01-23T19:45Z,"Hey Alex, there are quite a lot of us leeching right now and pretty much aching to seed. 

Do a brother a favour and seed until there are at least 3 to 4 people with full copies, please? 

Otherwise this torrent is going nowhere and that's just unfortunate for both parties on either side."
,aryawirads,2013-01-24T09:34Z,this torrent is driving me mad T_T
,patiodude,2013-01-26T22:22Z,Download is slow as fuck; currently 5 minutes in and less than 0.5%. Will seed if I ever finish the dl.
,aryawirads,2013-01-29T14:51Z,TO UPLOADER PLEASE SEED!!!!!!!!!!!
,thortin,2013-01-30T02:57Z,Anyone know if this is legit. All i see is how people get stuck at .05 percent and i know this uploader to upload something and never seed it.... Anyone know?
,Player_girl,2013-02-06T13:51Z,"I downloaded this game from another (Russian) tracker. This port doesn't work properly. I ran it on iMac (2,7 Intel Core i5; 4 Gb; AMD Radeon HD 6770M 512 Mb) / OS X 10.8.2. The gameplay is VERY VERY slow and you nothing can do with it. So I recommend not to waste your time."
,nicnoc227,2013-02-10T22:48Z,"Why the fuck does it stop at 5 fucking % ??????
It doesn´t make any sense."
,septimus379,2013-02-14T07:13Z,"All leechers, stop your downloads... (except a few of you), and then you guys sed please.  Seriously, you're all fucking retards.  right now we have one seeder divided amongst 68 leechers, so nothing is going to happen.  Everyone just get off, and let a few people get it, then it'll go much quicker."
,hansel85,2013-02-27T12:22Z,ShiTTTTT...stuck at 5% as well...this is annoying..really
,strawolu,2013-03-05T23:15Z,can you settle the problem alex3142 pleaaase?
,jids94,2013-03-08T22:46Z,"people ubisoft has not made AC revelations on mac platforms, wich means that this game is a FAKE STOP DOWNLOADGIN"
,todekah,2013-03-19T01:15Z,"jlds94, it's obvious that Ubisoft hasn't made AC:R for mac yet, this is a wineskin that nobody can determine if it works or not because there's so little seeders. I'm not even gonna bother on this one."
,TalibanNinjaX,2013-03-29T22:49Z,"If you are having trouble downloading, i suggest you download the torrent for windows /torrent/6838457 and then download Crossover /torrent/8215269 to install the .exe file. "
