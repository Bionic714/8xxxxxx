,crab2cool,2013-01-11T05:58Z,Can you link me to a reading list for the G.I. Joe series please? I have scattered issues and cannot make heads or tails due to the different numbering systems. It's a dog breakfast!
,Street_Disciple,2013-01-11T06:25Z,Awesome thank you

crab2cool, here's a reading list I found on IDW's forum:

,mixeng,2013-01-11T10:03Z,Is it possible that U or some else might have the entire '68 and '68 Scars Series ?

[V],STFmaryville,2013-01-11T14:32Z,"mixeng, here's the 3 issues released so far of '68 SCARS. #4 doesn't have an on-sale date at the Image site. It's always late. (Stupid on Image's part because it's a freakin' MINISERIES.) I wouldn't expect #4 before March.

I'll look for the first series."
,doom206,2013-01-11T18:27Z,"Thanks! Any chance you could do this for both the GI Joe and Snake Eyes series too?
Also do you have the old Marvel series Nth Man The Ultimate Ninja by Larry Hama? I've been looking for it but can't find anything. "
[V],STFmaryville,2013-01-11T19:22Z,"mixeng, here's '68 (the first miniseries), the 2 one-shots, and '68 Scars (1-3):

[V],STFmaryville,2013-01-11T19:30Z,"Street_Disciple and blackcanary, you're welcome.

blackcanary, thanks for the reading list!

doom206, yeah i can compile the joe and snake eyes series.

and i love nth man. sincerely! in fact i own the whole series and two pages of ron wagner's original art. but i don't have any nth man scans. i have looked before. i'll look again but don't get your hopes up.

someone is going to have to ask one of the Novus or Minutemen or Empire groups to buy the series and do some 2048px scans, 2013 style!"
,BabiesDontNeedSpleens,2013-01-12T04:01Z,"Thanks so much man, this torrent is great. i never thought I'd get it downloaded, so I really appreciate it.

Its amazing how far GI JOe came from shooting a million rounds at someone to catching a few themselves. IDW knows how to make things exciting, for sure.

 Made my day seeing these. "
