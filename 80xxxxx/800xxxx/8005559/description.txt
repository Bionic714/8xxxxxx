Now, about the "VOLUME 3" business ...

G.I. Joe Cobra was a 4-issue miniseries in 2009.

G.I. Joe Cobra II was a 4-issue mini in 2010. Sales were good and it continued as an ongoing, but issues 5 to 13 only said "G.I. Joe Cobra" on the covers.

G.I. Joe Cobra, also known as "Cobra Civil War" for its first 8 issues, is the current volume. In the indicia it is called "G.I. Joe Cobra vol. 2"

But this really is the 3rd series, so that's what I've decided to call it.
