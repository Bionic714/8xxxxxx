NTSC ISO file of the DVD from the box set. Mount it or burn it then watch it or sleep thru it.
There is a flaw with this one disk meaning the volume is rather low and I had to fix a glitch that DVD2 got stuck on.
However it is all there with menus including directors track for behind the scenes info and often there is some cool stuff U can learn that way...
