,shreko,2013-01-12T09:20Z,This is the most hideous film ever . best not down load 
,moremetalthanyou,2013-01-12T17:54Z,"You kind of know what you're getting with Full moon. Really cheap horror movies that always involve terrible doll animations. I'm tired of Charles Band, he hasn't made a good horror movie since Puppet Master 3."
,klxl,2013-01-13T03:22Z,this is a very crappy movie.
,frobknob,2013-01-13T03:59Z,"This is a stinker of a film. I don't know about the first two parts, but the last part isn't even original - it's from the 20 year old movie ""Dollman vs the Demonic Toys"":

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106743

Avoid, unless you're a fan of real low-budget dreck."
,Burnout13,2013-01-13T05:07Z,"Audio/video quality is fine I guess.

Terrible film. Like worse than student film quality. Just......bad.

"
,soundtech,2013-01-13T09:43Z,"Worst Movie Ever. Thanks for the upload though. Not complaining about that. You rock for finding the ""hard to find"" as well as the ""should have been left unfound""."
,highlander888,2013-01-15T10:47Z,"Thanks for the upload but...

there seems to be parts missing. There are non-sequitur scenes in the the first two stories
at least!"
,hashtagnwo,2013-01-21T03:44Z,http://www.imdb.com/find?q=The.Haunted.Dollhouse.&s=all cant find it
[V],joshua13,2013-01-29T03:39Z,"the first commenter's link is not about this film, but an 11min short of all most the same name. You can watch it on line for no, but creator says it's coming down. Easy to download as a 110mb mp4 too, especially if you do not  have flash plugin enabled."
,cgculpepper,2013-03-14T23:19Z,joshua13 is correct. I did post the wrong link.
