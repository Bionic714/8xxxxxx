Synopsis

Previously titled PUBLIC SPEAKING: A PROCESS APPROACH, Deanna Sellnow's CONFIDENT PUBLIC SPEAKING, SECOND EDITION distinguishes itself as the introductory text that most effectively presents the process of public speaking and the strategies students can use to become confident public speakers. Student-oriented and reader-friendly, the book offers unique coverage of learning styles as an aspect of audience diversity, as well as its extensive, integrated coverage of overcoming communication apprehension and the significant role ethics plays in public speaking. Changes to the Second Edition include three new types of boxes, even greater attention to ethics, a completely new interior design, and expanded technology offerings that include our Web-based Speech Builder Express. An ancillary CD-ROM and Web site offer adopters an interactive and multimedia enhanced presentation of public speaking principles and skills.
