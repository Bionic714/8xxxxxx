Thanks so much for this!

John Holt was the first radical education advocate I ever heard of. Saw him on Phil Donahue when I was in 7th grade and staying home from school. He helped me understand why I hated school, and I moved on from him to other radicals like Kozol and Illich. 

Back then I found it hard to believe homeschooling would be taken over by fundamentalist crazies. How the world has changed."
