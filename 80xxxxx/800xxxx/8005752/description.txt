The complete works of John Holt in .pdf form. Holt is frequently referred to as "the father of the modern homeschooling movement" and coined the term "unschooling" to describe allowing children to learn without coercion. I am very happy to be able to share Mr. Holt's work with you and would appreciate any constructive criticism you can give me, since this is my very first torrent. tia
