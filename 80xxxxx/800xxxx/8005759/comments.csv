Thank for for bringing this problem to my attention. I apologize for the error in my description. The narration stops after chapter 40. 
As far as I am aware of, this is the only audio version to be had (at least at this point in time). 
Again, my apologies. If I had a way to edit the title of the torrent, I would do so. 
I do have the complete ebook of it, if you don't have it already. I created it a few days ago. "
