,MrShite,2013-01-11T08:47Z,This is great stuff. Do you have the 2-disc deluxe re-issues of the Pavement albums? It's hard to find all of them in FLAC.

,MrShite,2013-01-11T10:40Z,"1 - Slanted and Enchanted: Luxe & Reduxe
2 - Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain: L.A.'s Desert Origins
3 -  Wowee Zowee: Sordid Sentinels Edition
4 - Brighten the Corners: Nicene Creedence Edition
5 - Terror Twilight: Farewell Horizontal Edition

I've seen ""Slanted and Enchanted: Luxe & Reduxe"" in FLAC, but none of the others."
