It's 1980 and Eric Crawford is now the head of the UFO program. Soon after his father's death, he blackmailed government officials into giving him the post. Jesse Keys is married but is becoming increasingly paranoid over his abductions and agrees to seek professional help. He soon finds himself under the control of the military. Jacob is married and still has his special powers. He returns to Texas and reunites with his family at their mother's death bed. He tells his brother Tom about his origins and Tom goes from being the biggest pessimist to the strongest believer in aliens. This catches Eric's eye who cannot help but wonder what made him change his mind. To get that information, he starts an affair with Jacob's sister Becky.
