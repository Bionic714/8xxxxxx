Editorial Reviews
All Music Guide - Sarah Erlewine
Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat has the distinction of being the only musical that starred Michael Damian, Donny Osmond, and Andy Gibb. Aside from attracting former heartthrobs, the musical stands as being one of the most approachable musicals based on religious materials. A rather straightforward telling of the tale of Joseph, the favorite son of Jacob also known as "Israel", Joseph the musical has catchy songs and colorful characters not to mention their costumes, making it a favorite of parents who want to take their children to a Broadway show. For anyone who's read the Bible, the story is predictable, although author Tim Rice has taken several liberties with the Good Book. Highlights in the score include "Close Every Door," "Go Go Joseph," "One More Angel in Heaven," and "Any Dream Will Do." For some, Andrew Lloyd Webber's music might be a bit too saccharine, but on a whole the show is fun, buoyant, and energetic.
