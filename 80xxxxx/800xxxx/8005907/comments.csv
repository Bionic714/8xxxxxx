,chicken84,2013-01-12T03:12Z,"installed and working..but i could not use the am.adl file as you had said..

i installed ad muncher to a custom folder not the default folder..i always prefer to install like that..can u explain how to --Click ""E"" to Extract Ad List -- this step a bit more..

but i could update the ad list from the software itself..is that enough??"

,superpaperdude,2013-05-05T12:16Z,"AWESOME.  downloaded quickly, and the crack works flawlessly.  I had a legitimate copy of this, and when I formatted my computer to upgrade to a new OS, the code I had purchased no longer worked.  PurpleBeanz, I shall look for you on any software torrents I might be needing!"
