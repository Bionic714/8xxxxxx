,jaquiow,2013-01-11T12:56Z,"When i first started it, it shot up to around 350mb, but gradually went down to less than 1kb.  Pausing and restarting accomplished the same thing.  I hope this is real."
,omg_666,2013-01-11T17:19Z,its the real thing (part 1-4) but we need more seeding. 
,Run408,2013-01-12T05:54Z,I'll seed for as long as I can...
,jaquiow,2013-01-14T11:11Z,"My download is a whopping less than 1kbs.  I think I'll give up on this one.  Shame it was at 84%, after many attempts."
