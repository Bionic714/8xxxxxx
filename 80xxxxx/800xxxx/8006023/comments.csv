I think it is inherent in mankind to be both jykel and and hyde...(primitve and intellectual)...just as a primative man would bash in the skull of another man so would a modern man and I don't beleive that only the jykel(bad-evil man or dictatatorial Goverments) have the means to obtain stones(guns-weapons)....even though I am not American I argue with others often that the 2nd amendment be protected as your forefathers who where much wiser than the fools of today so rightly stated (pardon my spelling) God Bless America"
