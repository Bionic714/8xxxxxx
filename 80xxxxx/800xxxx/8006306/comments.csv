,johnpaulmathew,2013-01-18T07:16Z,Tnx TeamGBZ for this awesome upload! But is it really 720p? Bcoz the resolution is written as 1280x544.
,johnpaulmathew,2013-01-18T07:27Z,What is the resolution of this video? Bcoz its written 720p on the title and on resolution info its 1280x544. Thanks for the upload.
,pokkiri,2013-01-19T12:36Z,"@johnpaulmathew
you wont get 720p for most of the films. even movies written you get most of the time with 800.
so dont blame  TeamGBZ.
after all this dude brought  some mallu movies in High Def.

@bibinkm.. dude the low size are available from long time.. go and find rather than asking for it here.

Now everyone is behind High res."

you wont get 720p for most of the films. even movies written 1080p you get most of the time with 800.
so dont blame TeamGBZ.

,johnpaulmathew,2013-01-19T14:12Z,@ Pokkiri: Dude hold on ur horses. I was just asking a simple question. I am indeed thankful to TeamGBZ for this awesome upload. But its written 720p and the resolution info is different. Just wanted to clear that bcoz I am on limited bandwidth and 4.36 GB is pretty big file size now-a-days. If you check out uploads in high resolution section of TPB you will notice that most of the 720p files are under 1 GB and even 1080p format is availbale at or under 1.5 GB. Ofcourse quality is not topnotch but those 1.5 GB files are almost perfect. Again I am really thankful to the uploader and didnt blame or anything the uploader as you have stated but just pointed out the difference only.
,alpha_phoenix,2013-01-24T07:31Z,good work...
,TeamGBZ,2013-02-12T12:10Z,what about the quality?
