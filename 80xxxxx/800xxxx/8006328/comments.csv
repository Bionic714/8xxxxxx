,MattMillz,2013-01-11T17:33Z,"Just finished watching, It's an interesting movie to say the least..
A/10 V/9 ..  For DVDSCR Standards this is a really really good copy on my 17 inch laptop screen its a LITTLE grainy, but when hooked up to my 60 inch TV by HDMI.. it looks REALLY good..

Whoever ripped this is new at ripping movies, and he did a superb job of doing so..."

,sugarpuffextreme,2013-01-11T19:49Z,"where is the dvdr?

didnt the dvd screener disc have surround?
if so, why doesnt this have?

Do original screener discs usually have bad encoding (bad encoding as in bad picture quality) compared to retail dvd disc?"
,rudoo7,2013-01-11T19:52Z,"@michaelmotes, hee hee, v.funny lol"
,Dtronco,2013-01-12T00:49Z,"I got something with the name ""LES_MISERABLES-2013EDAW DVDSRNR.avi.part"" that even when I took off the "".part"" at the end, did not work.

Think it's fake."
,jpmcnown,2013-01-12T03:06Z,"@Dtronco, A "".part"" file is usually indicative of an incomplete download. It's not fake. "
,Xclwnd,2013-01-12T16:03Z,A-V-M!?
,iovando,2013-01-12T18:00Z,this movie fucking blows dick. If you have the time and interest to watch people sing for 2:15 hours then this movie would suit you. Gets boring after 3 minutes.
,mabert,2013-01-12T19:52Z,WOW... a screener... WHATA GO NEON!!!
,kothabbai,2013-01-12T20:05Z,Thnk u...

,justknox,2013-01-13T00:48Z,"Why does this movie cut off at the 1:13:00 mark? 

Anyone else having this problem? This movie is incomplete."
,PSotero,2013-01-13T05:33Z,Great quality for a DVDSCR. Thanks!
,Gabri77,2013-01-13T05:50Z,Thx!
,bawbzor,2013-01-13T09:03Z,Quick question: Do they take away my Man Card if I watch this?
,d4rk3nigm4,2013-01-14T06:28Z,"Great upload. Thanks. Neon, can you please upload the movie Operation Terror? "

,n0fluxplz,2013-01-15T16:28Z,same problem with movie cutting off at 1hr 13 min mark. why is that?
,KKKDownlow,2013-01-16T20:40Z,Not worth the 2.31 GB download for only a DVDscr.
,Boh2,2013-01-17T03:45Z,"There have been lots of screeners as of late. What happen, did something get a inside man that went nuts. "
,mikald2,2013-01-18T02:15Z,"I agree with iovando,not a bad rip though.tnx NEON"
,The_Abee,2013-01-18T21:44Z,"Thanxx. it's one of the Best print so far. And, it's great movie. I'll recommend."
,raaaain,2013-01-31T23:38Z,"The quality of the video is superb; however, it  doesn't sync with the audio. 

I recommend downloading the torrent uploaded by sC0rp-ET:
