"Either Way" is a subtle and playful dramatic comedy, set in the remote north of Iceland in the mid 1980s. Two employees of the Icelandic Road Administration, spend the summer painting lines on the winding roads that stretch out to the horizon. With no-one but each other for company, the barren wilderness becomes a place of adventure, disaster and discovery as both men find themselves at crossroads in their lives.
