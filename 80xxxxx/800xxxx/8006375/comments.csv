,eeuropean2000,2013-01-11T12:31Z,"Oh, yay, yay, ya!  Rkstr you are best of the best.  Do you have any idea at all why you are the only one to post Runway when there are at least a dozen people who post other shows, including truly execrable ones such as Honey Boo-Boo?  One way or another -- thanks dude!"
[T],FatFreddy638,2013-01-11T13:09Z,"@eeuropean2000 - LOL!! If you check my uploads you will see I have also uploaded the ""execrable"" Honey Boo Boo:-) I only upload that show because it was requested and I told the people who wanted it they could pay for it from iTunes, which they did by donating to me via Paypal- its very popular but I don't watch it and I don't judge, each to their own.
What I do watch is Project Runway and the reason I upload it is because I love to share a show I love and is appreciated by everybody. I hope everyone is excited about Season 11 which premieres 24th Jan and I will of course be sharing with you all :-)"

,BigDanna,2013-01-12T07:37Z,"FYI, if you're having trouble finding episode 10, leave ""allstars"" out of your search.  It was added as two words ""all stars"".  Of course, I could be the only lame that had trouble and now everyone knows... oops...

Link prolly wont work either:  http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7986150/Project_Runway_All_Stars_S02E10_All_Stars_And_Stripes_HDTV_x264-"
