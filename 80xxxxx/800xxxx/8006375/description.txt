Couture de France

ReleasedJan 10, 2013

The designers go international! For the first time ever in Project Runway history, the designers retire sketching at 1407 for a day of sketching in Paris at the Eiffel tower! The designers also get a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to tour Valentino atelier and showrooms, and are also invited to a private preview of Valentino s Couture show. With all of their newly acquired Parisian knowledge, the designers return to NYC to design a couture gown of their own that will hopefully secure their spot in the finale.
Guest judges to determine who goes to the finale are House of Valentino and Cynthia Rowley.
