@Namorax: That could explain why this movie has not gotten the status it deserves (in my humble opinion) I think Redford plays the character to perFECtion. So lifelike that it could understandably be looked at as this was his natural character. Which may be why he didnt want to be known for it. Only one question left; is it? :-)"
,Worldtouching,2013-03-06T23:07Z,"Hi again Tyrell. 
Sorry to bother you again now. The problem is that there are no seeders left for the part im missing. 
At this point I have about one third of the movie downloaded, and I think I am the one who has the most of the seeders/leechers. I can also tell you that I have uploadet several Gb already, so it seems that there is really actual interest for this classic.
It was of course also for a big part my fault that I got started late on downloading. What happened was that I was every now and then checking in the ""new country for old men"" torrent, since it was there we had our communication, and I guess I had expected that you had given me some kind of heads up when you got around to the upload, not that you had said you would, and theres no complain, but thats just the reason that I didnt discover that the movie was already here untill after it had been here for a couple of weeks.
So in short, is it possible that you can seed it again (if you have already taken it off) or give it some priority (dont know how that works, and what torrent handler you are using, was just thinking that it could be that it didnt get priority since I usually have a very slow connction, I am travelling around in Asia and use the shared wifi in the hostels and hotels I stay)
By the way, should I get this torrent fully downloadet, I promise I will keep it alive for as many years as possible, just so you know it ;-)"
