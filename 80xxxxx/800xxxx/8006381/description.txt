as promised here's the ISO of "Little Fauss and big Hasly"

source : USA dvd import
language : english only with en_sub only.

Unfortunately do not expect a very good quality 'cause it will not be the case anyway.
Untouched and not remastered as well.
Original iso,nothing more so.
We think it is probably a crap copy of the TV's movie of this one due to poor quality.However it is a very old movie from 1970 so we should be indulgent to this topic.
