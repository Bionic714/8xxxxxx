,jyufer06,2013-01-12T11:54Z,audio is not in sync :(
,vplmxngvzwyvo,2013-01-12T12:41Z,"audio sync is 4000ms = 4sec.

just open the video in mplayer classic (google for the freeware player: ""media player home cinema"") and set up in options:

Internal Filter -> delay (ms) 4000

for this video.
For other videos just disable the checkbox :)

Happy watching a sync video."
,vplmxngvzwyvo,2013-01-12T12:48Z,"To make this smackdown sync, just delay exact 4000ms the audiostream (in some players settings)

And dont forget to set it back after watching :)"
,FreeManReload,2013-01-12T14:19Z,"for lag audio :
1 - play it in media playe classic
2- right click on the screen play 
3- chose audio the option
4- @ audio time shift ( activate it if it dose not)
5- make the number (-4100 or -4200 )
not : dont forget the  ""   -  ""  before the numbers .
enjoy and share the help as much u can in any thing as long as it good gor ppl :)
dont be lazy  ;)"

,xHopkins,2013-01-12T18:59Z,I did what you guys said about the sync on media player home cinema and it worked! thanks guys !
,joepocket,2013-01-12T23:00Z,"The audio sync issues are not easily fixed for me, because I don't watch SmackDown hunched in front of my laptop like a sad virgin. None of my players have audio sync options, because they're meant for files that are encoded properly by people who know what they're doing. Do not download."
,tabby999,2013-01-13T03:37Z,"thanks vplmxngvzwyvo, if anyones using a WDTV unit push options, choose audio lip sync and set to the mentioned rate"
