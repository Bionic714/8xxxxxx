Private Media Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: PRVT) is a production and distribution company that distributes adult entertainment via print publications, DVDs, the internet, and mobile.
 
Private magazine was established in Stockholm, Sweden, in 1965 as the world's first full-color hardcore magazine by Berth Milton, Sr. In the early 1990s, his son Berth Milton, Jr. took over and moved the company's headquarters to Sant Cugat del Vallès, Barcelona, Spain, although the company is incorporated in Nevada. Milton also started to produce movies and internet content, and in 1999, Private became the first adult entertainment company to be traded on the NASDAQ stock market. The company was de-listed by NASDAQ on November 15, 2011 because its shares have not met the exchange’s $1 minimum price for 30 days.
