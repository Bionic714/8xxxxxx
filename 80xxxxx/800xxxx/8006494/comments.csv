Incompetent? Stuck in the media stone age? Or you do this on purpose, like: crap encodes for the masses, real quality for scene-only sitez? ""scene4all"" kinda sounds like that last bit."

Thx to scene4all for this release, all their past releases, and for not being a smirky, patronizing asshole that talks smack on other people's work while contributing absolutely nothing of their own.

Thanks too to all seeders and leechers... Sincere thx all around."

,floydmcgettigan,2013-01-17T07:05Z,"@libertaswv: Well, I'm not sure my upload history here is relevant for the point I am trying to make. Funny, though, how your contributions are just as absent as mine, so who are you to talk?

I'm a video engineer. If I were to upload (or download) here, which I don't and won't, I'd post stuff I wouldn't have to be embarrassed about. And believe me I know how to produce it. But that's beside the point: These days, anyone can reencode a DVD with any number of tools with very high quality. It takes NOTHING to do this right.

I recently had the opportunity to inspect a pile of these torrented DVDSCR releases, and others, on a student's computer. Frankly, if the claimed source is DVD, even a relatively low bitrate encoding, what you get in a torrent by and large deserves the name ""crap"". It's totally substandard to get blocky, grotesquely banded video at 1-2 Mbps as a single recode of professionally done MPEG-2. This just can't be right. When this is topped off with a horrible beginner's mistake, neglecting to remove telecine, there is no other word for this than ""incompetence"". Sorry if the truth hurts.

Or there is another explanation.

What's funny is that most, if not all, of the DVDSCR releases seem to have encoding ""problems"". This is so pervasive that it makes one wonder. Not all scene guys can possibly be clueless. And the DVDSCR releases seem to originate almost entirely in XviD/MP3 - obsolete, low quality codecs. What you see here as x264/AAC or AC3 seem to be mostly recodes of some XviD original. Then, once the film is officially released on disc, all of a sudden much better quality becomes available - no more XviD, no banding, judder, etc. Why is that? There is a system to this, isn't there? Torrents of the highly desirable pre-releases seem intentionally crippled. Perhaps the MO is: release on TPB to hurt the studios, but keep the quality low to protect the business of the professional bootleggers who sell discs for profit. Any other suggestions?

Now about being thankful. If someone gave you a birthday present, but it turned out to be lousy, how would you feel? If you then realize that the giver could have easily done better, maybe you'd wonder if it isn't you who's the butt of a joke."

Your first sentence is silly, specious horseshit that ignored the basis of my original response entirely. 

I was giving you shit because you're talking smack on people who DO contribute while contributing nothing yourself. Your oh-so-clever attempt to turn the tables on me displays your fundamental lack of understanding as to why you're such a prick to begin with. 

I wasn't talking smack on people who contribute... You were. See the difference? 

No? I'm not surprised. 

As for your life story... Good gravy man - Who gives a shit? I couldn't care less who you are or what you've allegedly done or not done. 

Shut the fuck up with your (woefully inappropriate) attempts to patronize people, and stop talking smack on people who take the time to upload when you've never done a goddamn thing to support this site. I doubt very much you even SEED, considering your tone deaf, clueless attack on frickin' scene4all (of all people... someone who has contributed more in one week than you have in your entire life)

You're a ridiculously smug dick. You need to spend less time congratulating yourself, and more time fucking the hell off.

It's not that i'm suggesting you shouldn't enjoy your personality disorder... I just think you should enjoy it somewhere else, or in silence.

----------

Thanks again to scene4all, and ALL the community minded people who take the time, effort, and risk to upload - here and everywhere. Thanks too to ALL seeders and leechers, and for everyone who does what they can, when they can. Very sincerely appreciated.

Long live The Pirate Bay "
