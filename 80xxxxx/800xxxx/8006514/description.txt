Peter Evans is one of the very best of the new trumpeters in the free-avant
zone. Evan Parker plays tenor sax and soprano in ways that have extended the
music and he's done it for many years. The same could be said for bassist Barry
Guy and drummer Paul Lytton. When they came together for a live concert in
Portugal last year, anticipation among the audience must have been high. The
new Clean Feed (196) recording of the concert, Scenes in the House of Music
gives it to you straight-up. The expectations were justified. Fully.

Here are four superb free players pulling out all the stops, exploring
textural-aural intensity and movement in ways few can approximate today. This
is STRONG music and it will put all avant fans in a zone that has been reserved
for the very best. Music, I mean. That's what this is.
