This is actually great quality for a camrip but there is a MAJOR issue :

It seems some kind of tracking device has been used to cut 'camera shakes'.
Next time ,seriously, check what you're uploading

THERE IS A F***ING BLACK TRIANGLE THAT COVERS HALF OF THE FILM!
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON ON SOME PARTS!

Then again, this one's for free so i wont complain but you know what to expect.
Subtitles work fine.

Movie itself is kinda lame after all...too bad."
