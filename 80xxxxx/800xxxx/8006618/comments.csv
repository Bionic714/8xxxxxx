,farkakte,2013-01-11T19:11Z,"thanks - great up. cursory look shows nice standard dvd quality. rating by that standard it's a 9/9 imo. it's the best i have looked at so far from the few i have looked at.

Can't rate the flick itself - got this one for the wifey. :-) Seems like a pure musical with almost every bit of dialogue sung.

will seed."
