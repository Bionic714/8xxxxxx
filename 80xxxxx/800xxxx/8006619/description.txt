KISS
Milan, Italy
Date: 1980-09-02
Venue: Motovelodromo Vigorelli

Super 8 footage with original audio, total time about 10 min.  Picture quality is a bit blurry but surprisingly good, especially on the closeups towards the end.
Audio far exceeded my expectations even though it seems to be pitched down slightly (Paul's vocals sound a bit strange) and is a bit overcompressed because there's definite "pumping".
But just check out the awesome harmonies in Talk to me.
Classic... 

Setlist:
Detroit Rock City (cut)
Firehouse (end only)
Talk To Me (cut)
