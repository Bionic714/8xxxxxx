I'm curious though if anyone else is having a problem with the video and audio being slightly out of sync. I watched this and Les Misérables back to back and they were both like that. Since I haven't seen any other comments about it I'm assuming it's a problem on my end.

PHATFISH COMMENT-
Phatfish at 2013-01-17 03:52 CET:
A - Good

V - Good

M - The combination of comically awful acting and a somehow a story that lacks any sort of substance more then people constantly crying crocodile tears, in chorus, makes the almost 2 hours unbearable to watch.

MY COMMENT
gayestmovieever at 2013-01-10 14:59 CET:
I have been downloading torrents from this site since the beginning of time and i just registered now for the first time ever for the only purpose to state that ""This is the Gayest movie in the history of all movies"" and i am not talking about the kind of gay between 2 men that suck each others dicks and ass fuck one another. Anyone that thinks anything different should punch themselves repeatedly numerous times in the face and than proceed to tie a belt or a rope around there neck and hang themselves until dead. You deserve a slow painful death, that is what you like if you like this movie, its basically the same thing you that it feels like, you must not have any kind emotion that you need to watch this shit predictable ugly boring sad ass shit movie to feel anything and addicted to feeling shitty and being a shit human being brainwashed chicken troll.. This should be in sci-fi section since there acting was so far from reality, i am sure delusional morons that think that there actions and emotions where not fake as fuck dick son and so far from any reality in the world as we know it.. now BE GONE.


Both comments have Same exact meaning. just different wording. happy happy time"
,gayestmovieever,2013-01-20T10:51Z,"no jailbreak for iphone 5, wait maybe never unless u want to get scammed. big fat adverisement for drug pharmaceutical companys. every other movie this actor did was better than this crap including limitless. i am sure girls and fudge packers loved it and brainwashed terds.  hehehe"

I am going to post this comment or one similar on all of the popular shows and movies I get. The MAIN REASON FOR MY POST IS I WANT TO TELL/REMIND EVERYONE THAT THE ""COPYRIGHT ALERT SYSTEM"" was launched yesterday. Most of the major isp's are involved, AT&T, TIME WARNER, VERIZON, and CABLEVISION, along with many others. SO GET BEHIND A VPN if you don't want your ISP dropping you for copyright infringement. Supposedly u get around 5 warnings then they drop you.  Just a friendly heads up to all you Pirates! here is a link to a news article about it, pretty basic column. :: http://news.yahoo.com/pirates-beware-industry-isps-launch-copyright-alert-system-000744092.html PROXY VPN or ""Borrow"" Wi-fi from the neighbors for your downloadingl I had a VPN in the past but it made my downloads drop DRASTICALLY so I currently looking for the best VPN or other option where I can maintain a decent speed. I appreciate the work you put into uploading, and the sourcing that goes into it. You seriously rock man, Keep up the Great work!"
,woprr,2013-02-27T12:16Z,"Well, xxjaretxx is a nice neighbour, wants his neighbours jailed for his downloads :-(

Get a PC for dummies course, buddy, one hop proxies or neighbours wifi do not provide any anonymity, tor is too slow,

and nearly all latest bittorrent clients support encryption and privacy blocklists,

so this nonsense alarm system won't detect anything,

just fear propaganda. Keep seeding. 

To be clear, the BT clients encryption is better than vpn, because it's using point-to-point connections, but vpn's for this use case are concentrators which may provide easy mass- monitoring, by the FEDs e.g.

xxjaretxx, does not trust his own contracted ISP under laws and courts he can use against them,

but rather trusts some unknown VPN provider crooks under no law, maybe now setup in 10000s by FBI or content industry detectives?

Good luck. "

If you have any sence and logic AND just a little tiny bit of emotions in your brain or heart you must love this movie, it s not only scratch the surface and tries to be a novel romantic it goes a little bit deeper but if you dont have the skills  to undstand keep watching the shoot em up flicks"

If you can out drink and out fight every guy in your trailerpark, this is not your kind of movie. If you can read big words and spell words with more than 2 syllables you might like this movie. 'nuf said."
