AppleΓÇÖs iPods continue to set the bar for media players, with bold new features like the TouchΓÇÖs supersized screen and Siri voice control. But iPods still lack a guide to all their features.

- Go wireless. Use the TouchΓÇÖs new iOS 6 software to sync content wirelessly.
- Relish the Nano. Enjoy video and photos on the NanoΓÇÖs new big screen, and chart your workouts with the Nike+ pedometer.
- Master the Shuffle and Classic. Get mucho music on the little Shuffle, and use the ClassicΓÇÖs giant hard drive to tote around your audio and video collections.
- Pump it up. Blast iPod tunes through your home and car stereo.
