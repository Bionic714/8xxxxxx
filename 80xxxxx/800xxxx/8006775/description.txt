Book Description
The ideal beginnerΓÇÖs guide to C# and object-oriented programming

- Covers exactly what beginners, even those with no prior programming experience, need to know to understand object-oriented programming and start writing programs in C#
- Explains the advantages and disadvantages of C#, and tips for understanding C# syntax
- Explores properties, encapsulation, and classes; value data types; operands and operators; errors and debugging; variables; and reference types
- Shows how to use statement repetition and program loops, understand arrays and collections, and write your own classes
- Also covers inheritance and polymorphism

Beginning Object-Oriented Programming with C# uses the tried-and-true Wrox formula for making this popular programming method easy to learn.

From the Back Cover
Learn both C# and object-oriented programming!

Assuming no prior programming experience, this beginnerΓÇÖs guide introduces you to object-oriented programming using the C# programming language to demonstrate all of the core constructs of this programming paradigm. Author Jack Purdum uses knowledge gained from more than 25 years of teaching experience to give you this thorough, yet easy-to-understand introduction to object-oriented programming with C#. Each chapter reinforces the programming philosophy and concepts of object-oriented programming, while real-world situations demonstrate how to design, create, test, and deliver your programs. With this engaging and motivating book, you will be eager to start writing programs right away.

Beginning Object-Oriented Programming with C#:
- Teaches programming language fundamentals using C# with Visual Studio 2012 as the programming environment
- Helps you fully understand how reference and value data types differ and how those differences affect your programs
- Walks you through designing and writing object-oriented programs and custom classes
- Explores various types of program errors; explains how to detect, isolate, and correct such errors; and addresses how to prevent further errors using defensive coding techniques
- Teaches you advanced features such as database programming, inheritance, and polymorphism
