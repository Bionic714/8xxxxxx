All subtitles got errors removed and time-lines improved dramatically.
Subs from net have dozens of time-overlaps, too short times for long lines or too long times for short lines..."

,maps_5,2013-05-30T19:51Z,"Hello.

Could someone please supply me with a link for the torrent file?!

For some reason I seam to be having problems downloading it...
And it keeps failing on adding the magnet to the client (Vuze)...

Honestly I don't understand why, since it has always worked...
and the client is up to date...
I tried adding another magnet just for trying and it went fine...
But this specific magnet, for some reason, doesn't want to be added on the client...

Therefore, if someone could be so generous as to give a link for the torrent file, this would be much appreciated.

Thanks in advance.
Regards."
