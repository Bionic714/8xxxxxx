Agnstra, forgive me if it's good and I'm bashing :) To the rest of you, in my opinion, it's not worth the risk. Good luck!"
,Silver4k,2013-02-17T19:05Z,"Chances are, it's because some of the tools ARE ""malware"" when used in general. Tools to expose/change windows passwords would be detected as a virus, as would things that let you remotely edit the registry."
,CrAcKeZ,2013-03-22T15:38Z,"Its safe, checked with two different a/v's

Don't know if its working though, didn't test it yet.

Thanks for the upload agnstra"
,CrAcKeZ,2013-03-22T15:43Z,"Correction, the one a/v found nothing. The second one found the following:

Drvlmpe.exe (Trojan.AFH)
Drvmpe.7z (Trojan.AFH)
ipscan.exe (AngryIPScanner)
Mix.7z (AngryIPScanner)
UltralSO.exe (Trojan.Gen.2)
SETUP.EXE (Trojan.Gen.2)
UltraISO.7z (Trojan.Gen.2)
ShowDrive.exe (Suspicious.MH690)
ShowDrive.exe (Suspicious.AD)
win7PExtras.7z (Multiple Risks)

Of course I'm confident that these are not real risks as there are many patches/keygens/hacks etc that are reported from some a/v's as ""viruses"""
