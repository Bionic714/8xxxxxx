This edition of the Restored HBCD is a bug fix release of
the previous version (V 1.0). Mini windows has been further improved, Kaspersky
Rescue Disk is finally perfected and boots equally well from DVD or USB.
Several new utilities have been added or upgraded and some faulty ones have
been fixed. The aim of this Hiren's Boot CD Rebuild is to provide an austere
but convenient and usable interface to the utilities whilst keeping faith with
Hiren's original concept. No fancy splash screens or wallpapers. Just hotkeyed
menus to get you quickly to the utilities you want to use.
