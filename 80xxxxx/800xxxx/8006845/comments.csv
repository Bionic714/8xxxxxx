DO NOT DOWNLOAD.
Burned with iHas on 2.4x Verbatim and had Unreadable Disc error. Wait for some other release or maybe there is some new year's protection system :/"
,Assassinprofessor,2013-01-12T12:32Z,"can someone confirm whether it is working, pls?"
,Melvin.FoX,2013-01-12T14:47Z,"Assassinprofessor - it is working, however there are some unreadable disc errors during gameplay. Try for yourself, maybe you could play it without any problems.
In fact I haven't tried install it on hdd, maybe that would be a soulution."
,tazzeboy,2013-01-12T14:49Z,"Ran it throu abgx and patched it and what not,m do not have a IHAS burner but it playes fine, on the end of mission 2 and no errors yet, just one black screen after a cutscene, but the reset fixed that :)"

,twohearts_left,2013-01-12T19:21Z,"@Melvin.FoX

I believe its an issue with abgx and a live patch. 

i had the same issue with borderlands 2. it did this to me until the game was released and a patch was available on the abgx website. after that i patched, then re burned, and no more issues."
,twohearts_left,2013-01-12T19:30Z,"@Skrillex18

,Sam_Makrani,2013-01-30T09:32Z,"I have a question..
I have been downloading all kinds of games for my Xbox 360 Slim L.T.+ 2.0 Pal.. I have burned many sgd3 and never had any problem! But this game is really messing man!! DMC: Devil may cry (5)..
I have downloaded it from 2 different torrents, but i get the same error when i try to play the game i.e (Unrecognized disc...status code: 03-57-00)
My Xbox has no problem cause it plays every game..
Now this is what i did..
It was a 3.0 when i downloaded it, i injected the topology l.t2.0 by using Xbox Backup Creator, to make it a l.t+2.0 compatible game.. Then i use the .iso through abgx360 with unchecked ""Verify if stealth passes"".. And yes!! I keep the CIV option checked.. Everything went perfectly.. Region free, xgd3, topology was injected..
Then i burned it using the latest imgburn 2.5.7.0, Calculate optimal was checked.. Truncate done.. But then it said that it can't burn with 2.4x speed, supported speed is 4x 6x 8x only.. It still continues to burn.. Then it said the image size is larger than the disc size.. But it still keeps burning.. Then comes the finalizing part, failed at first attempt, but then successfully done.. Then it verifies and says that the image size is larger than the disc size, but it still completed the verification and showed the message of operation successfully completed..
Then i tried to play it but it says ""Unrecognized Disc.. Status code: 03-57-00""
I have wasted 2 dvds for the same game.. :(
What should i do?
Plzzz help me out of this plzzzzzzzz
It would be a huge favour..."

,Weakballs,2013-02-27T22:18Z,"@Sam_Makrani

Just do yourself a favor and reflash to LT+ 3.0- there are very few people who are going to be able to troubleshoot for you if you're running 2.0. Too many variables. Hope this helps."
,pulh4,2013-02-28T03:57Z,"IMA TEACH U WHINY BITCHAS HOW TO PLAY XGD3 WITH TRUNCATE METHOD  WITHOUT ANY NEED TO BUY AN  IHAS  BURNER BULLSHIT.
1- USE IMGBURN AND BURN THE DISC AT 2,4X SPEED USING TRUNCATE METHOD AND ALWAYS USE GOOD QUALITY DVDS, VERBATIM RECOMENDED
2- GET AN MP3 FILE INTO UR XBOX, USE A USB STICK OR WATEVER, AND BEFORE LAUNCHING THE GAME PLAY THE FILE USING THE XBOX PLAYER
3- LAUNCH THE GAME , NEXT START THE GAME, NEXT PAUSE THE GAME, NEXT STOP THE MP3  FILE AND FINNALY GO BACK TO THE GAME 
AGAIN.
4- PLAY THE FUKIN GAME TILL UR CONSOLE EXPLODES WITHOUT NO MORE DISC UNRECONAZIBLE ERROR.
IT IS RECOMENDED TO INSTALL THE GAME TO THE HARDDRIVE.
U WELCOME"
