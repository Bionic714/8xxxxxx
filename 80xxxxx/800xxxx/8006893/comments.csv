,KevinCostner,2013-01-11T21:25Z,"Can't burn to a disc with ConvertXtoDVD4, there's a problem with one of the files."
,Sifu73,2013-01-11T21:37Z,"I'm having the same issue!  Won't play correctly in any video player!  I ran it through VLC, Potplayer, SmPlayer, TheKmplayer, MPC, Media Player.  I'm running it through VirtualDubmod to see if it can be corrected!  There are frame issues with this file!  I forget the exact error It said in virtualdubmod!  It's running though the program now!  I hope it fixes the error!  If not, I guess I'll have to find another post of this movie!!!"

,mpenn20,2013-01-12T01:26Z,anyone know why this won't play on ps3?
,dhilton2001,2013-01-12T01:41Z,"...almost 4,000 seeders, but it took me 4 hours to DL..... and the file (AVI btw) is no good. I can't get it to play on anything.... WMP, VLC, Power Director, Roxio, etc..."
,TheEmpathicEar,2013-01-12T02:20Z,Is this DD5:1 audio?
,TheEmpathicEar,2013-01-12T02:33Z,Is this 6 ch audio?
,TBDarko,2013-01-12T02:40Z,"From what I can tell this source has given us Les Mis, Silver Linings Playbook and Argo in the last 24 hours. You sir, whoever you are, are a gentleman and a scholar. If you manage to also give us Life of Pi and The Master I will consider you a god amongst men."
,jennifer1927,2013-01-12T03:18Z,The 1.8gb has only 1:07 minutes... where's the other half???  Excellent so far though.
,DTownLA,2013-01-12T04:18Z,Oddly enough it works in quicktime...?!?! 
,oldjugbh4life,2013-01-12T05:02Z,Where's the other half?
,mpenn20,2013-01-12T05:39Z,"Argo.2012.DVDSCR.XviD-WTF works on ps3, in case anyone's interested."
,MyKrossini,2013-01-12T06:16Z,"A/V - 9/9   This is the ENTIRE movie. People who are saying where is the other half must be getting confused by the convertxtodvd error that occurs when trying to burn it. Again, this is the ENTIRE movie. I watched the whole thing on VLC player just fine. Thanks neon!"
,pplbrandon,2013-01-12T07:29Z,"V-8
A-8"
,a2dogs222,2013-01-12T09:08Z,"Beautiful play in VLC. Will not open on WD Live box, nor in VirtualDub."
,Pakosan,2013-01-12T09:34Z,Nope. There is a problem with this file. It might work with some players but it is strange it doesn't work with all when every movie does.
,ofpirate,2013-01-12T09:34Z,"first, the good news..

- quality is totally acceptable
- there is hard-coded englist subs for non-english parts

now the bad news..

- this IS incomplete (first hour and seven minutes to be precise)

tested with MPC & VLC.. 1:07

also remuxed out of the AVI container into an MKV with same results 1:07

neom is as solid as sources get.. hense the green scull - if neon says neon received the complete film, im inclined to believe it.. unfortunately, an incomplete film is being delivered via the this torrent.."
,leehwgoC,2013-01-12T10:05Z,"DON'T PLAY THIS WITH MEDIA PLAYER CLASSIC.

It will indeed end at the 1:07 mark.

HOWEVER, as another poster above has partly mentioned, VLC works.  It will play the movie in its entirety.

(fyi, I've also tested Windows Media Player... it just refused to play the file at all)"
,leehwgoC,2013-01-12T10:08Z,"@ofpirate

VLC plays the movie in full on my end.  I am literally watching the credits at 1:56 as I type this.  

Update your VLC, I guess."
,piratekitty,2013-01-12T11:20Z,"Seems to work in VLC only. 
Full 2 hr length.

Was able to run it through Handbrake."
,ofpirate,2013-01-12T12:11Z,"@leehwgoC - good call.. updated VLC and worked like a charm.. as usual, when all else fails VLC for the win! in many years of scene content ive never seen an anomaly quite like this, so i guess theres always something new to learn.. suspect this is  timecode related, but cant say so 100% - at any rate.. people helping people, good stuff!

 incidentally, relative to overall size, this is among the best standard def rips ive yet to come across.. stereo audio is also good, as is the sync.. subs for non-english dialog are perfect"
,Gabri77,2013-01-12T15:49Z,Thx!
,poijhbn,2013-01-12T17:06Z,"Cons: Only plays in VLC, no length/timecode information, FBI bullshit at the start wasn't cut out.

That's it. This is phenomenal quality for the resolution."
,scanman87,2013-01-12T17:12Z,Only works in VLC 2.0.5 & it's the full movie.
,Ecstasio,2013-01-12T18:46Z,"It's an mp4. Not sure why the group released it with the incorrect extension (avi). Nevertheless, it works perfectly in VLC and is good quality."
,mara08,2013-01-12T18:51Z,thanks
,topeak,2013-01-13T04:49Z,"When played under VLC, it runs the whole 2 hours.
That said, this file behaves oddly, like it's been nuked or something. When I skipped forward to test sync and length, the VLC window froze for a few seconds, and then played back normally. 

Not sure what is causing this, or if it's just this upload that's doing it, but it's certainly weird. 
If there's a cleaner copy out that doesn't have these glitches reported in the comment section, I'd download that instead. "
,iamwizard,2013-01-13T05:38Z,"Movie is full length (~2 hours)
Timecode is missing because keyframe construction is broken.
Before fixing, VLC would play entire movie with very slow seeking.
Fixed movie by importing to VirtualDub and letting it automatically reconstruct missing index block upon completion you will get errors but ignore those for now. Then use DixFix++ and use the normal Fix option and now your movie will show with A/V bitrates and seek like normal in VLC. Havent tried burning the movie yet."
,iamwizard,2013-01-13T05:39Z,^ fix only took about 5-10 minutes
,slashdotcoma,2013-01-13T08:07Z,"had to run the file through Pazera to get it work on Xbox 360.

It DOES have English subtitles for the non-English parts.

A: 9
V: 9
M: 9"
,minasat,2013-01-13T12:07Z,"Just like others said, original extension is .mp4 - Use DivFix++ to fix skip problem. 2hrs full movie it is."
,rollacansada,2013-01-15T01:39Z,AVOID THIS FILE!!  CANNOT CONVERT TO DVD!!!
,soumyaz,2013-02-08T14:37Z,"A10 V10 - Great movie, top 10 in the last few years for sure! Storyline is intelligent and entertaining, i wouldn't change it even a bit. Actors rocked, really really good acting! Quality was great! At site aole.ciroblazevic.com there is Django and Hobbit in HD already, great stuff! Thnx once again for this fantastic movie!"
