,Mildudon,2013-01-13T00:45Z,Just to be sure. What is the source blu-ray or DVD
,SaTaNiK1,2013-01-13T08:20Z,"Blu-ray of course.

,SaTaNiK1,2013-01-13T08:30Z,I meant that I could not get a hold of the blu-ray myself to do my own encode but managed to find someone else that uploaded it on TPB.
,asbolina,2013-01-19T18:32Z,The source looks like 720p at best. We could have a much better quality for the same bitrate. Too bad the original encoder did not spend more time on his release and that we cannot access the BDMV to do a decent encode.
,SaTaNiK1,2013-01-20T00:11Z,"@asbolina If I remember correctly this was the first anime to be draw in High Definition.

I finally got my hands on the Blu-ray Screens. The bad news is this encode is very washed out I have a comparison below.

The good-ish news is that I will be doing my own encode but it will not be for a WHILE.

I still need to upload Desert Punk, Naruto (All of it), Naruto Shippuuden (all of it, encoding now), Cowboy BeBop 1080p, and Bleach (all of it). Not to mention download a few box sets of the above that I am missing and the 149GB of Ergo Proxy Blu-rays. Busy Busy!

The bottle neck for this whole process is my damn upload speed unfortunately.

Also my Blood-C upload is almost done 97% so once that completes the upload speed on this will be a little better."
,BtheS,2013-03-31T10:10Z,@SaTaNiK1 I have been looking for a while and I am unable to find another 1080p Ergo Proxy release like this so I will have to download this. I would even download the 149GB source but cannot find that either (lucky bastard fidning it) dispite the washed out look that you have shown my love for high def needs satisfying. Thanks for this torrent!
,SaTaNiK1,2013-04-10T07:14Z,My encode of Ergo Proxy with fixed color is coming after 'Cowboy BeBop + Movie [1080p][DD5.1][Dual-Audio]' which should be released tomorrow.
