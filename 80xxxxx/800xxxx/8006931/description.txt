Warsaw City 2013 is currently our most sophisticated scenery package, featuring a highly detailed scenery of Warsaw city in Poland with surrounding airports. It is our largest, most expensive and most complex project so far - probably one of the largest on the market as well. This product is compatible with FSX/Prepar3D only.
 

Warsaw is the capital and the largest city of Poland. It is located on the Vistula (Wis┼éa) River, roughly 260 kilometres (160 mi) from the Baltic Sea and 300 kilometres (190 mi) from the Carpathian Mountains. Its population is estimated at 1,708,491 residents within a greater metropolitan area of 2,666,278 residents, making Warsaw the 9th most populous city proper in the European Union. The area of the city covers 516.9 square kilometres (199.6 sq mi), while the city's agglomeration covers 6,100.43 square kilometers (2,355.39 sq mi). Warsaw is a major international tourist destination and an important economic hub in Central Europe. It is also known as the "phoenix city" because it has survived many wars throughout its history. Most notably, the city had to be painstakingly rebuilt after the extensive damage it suffered from World War II, during which 85% of its buildings were destroyed.
