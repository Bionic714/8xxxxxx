Now, about the titles and "Volume 1 and 2" business ...

The way I see it, G.I. Joe Cobra was a 4-issue miniseries in 2009. G.I. Joe Cobra II was a 4-issue mini in 2010. Sales were good and it continued as an ongoing, but issues 5 to 13 say only "G.I. Joe Cobra" on the covers.

G.I. Joe Cobra, also known as "Cobra Civil War" for its first 8 issues, is the current ongoing volume. IDW calls it "G.I. Joe Cobra vol. 2" in the indicia. But IΓÇÖve decided the miniseries was the 1st volume, the series that started out with ΓÇ£Cobra IIΓÇ¥ on covers is the 2nd volume, and the current ongoing series is really the 3rd volume.

IΓÇÖve also left the title ΓÇ£G.I. JoeΓÇ¥ in these filenames because unlike the current series, ALL of these covers had that name prominently featured.
