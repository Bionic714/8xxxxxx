,GourmetPrince,2013-01-13T04:52Z,I have the hardcover. This book is very nice. Maybe it can help some people who suck as socializing understand subtlety.

,RyGuy-Anime,2013-02-06T03:30Z,It says 0 seeds :( please seed for the community
,waxlrose,2013-04-07T23:18Z,So you're not going to seed this ever? What was the point in uploading? Trolling?
,waxlrose,2013-04-09T05:37Z,"Hey everyone... I found the file at another site and noticed it was the same size as this one, so I figured the uploader got it there and renamed it... so, I changed the name of the file I found and put it in my torrent folder... it is now seeding and you'll have it in just a few seconds."
