The FLAC files are named in 3 different ways:
Filename - Meatloaf.flac
Filename - Meat Loaf.flac
Filename - Meat Loaf - Meat Loaf.flac

I can understand how 2 different naming methods can occur since there are two discs, but not three if they were ripped consecutively.

Also, If this is in fact Essential Meat Loaf, released in 2011, then the supporting files (cue, log, m3u) are all misnamed.
Those files are all named The Very Best Of Meat Loaf, which was the name of the 1998 release.

Although the 2011 version is just a repackaging of the 1998 version, they are two different titles so the supporting files should be named Essential Meat Loaf, not The Very Best Of Meat Loaf."

If your panties are that much in a knot, just rename the tracks. I never even caught the slightly strange labelling of the tracks on disc 1, nor the ""wrong"" title. It's not a big deal to me, especially considering I give ample information about the software, hardware and the rip itself.

You never brought up the EAC logs that are included, is it because it states that the CD's were accurately ripped and no errors occured? I thought so.

 My god some people just like to bitch & complain over absolutley anything. Next time, please feel free to skip over my upload.

I point out errors in your torrent, and rather than acknowledge that you f*cked up, you have to shoot the messenger. It wasn't a big deal, I was simply asking a question.

But if you wanna make a big deal about it then I'll say DO IT RIGHT NEXT TIME AND YOU WON'T HAVE THIS PROBLEM!

As for your precious EAC files, I don't give a damn about 'em. Don't read 'em, don't care."
