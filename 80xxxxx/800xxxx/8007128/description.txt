Wave Repair

Wave Repair is a shareware editor specifically designed for the restoration of WAV files that were recorded from vinyl records. It can also be used to process recordings made from tapes, but its restoration features are intended mainly for records. The name is perhaps a little unfortunate. You might think that Wave Repair is a program for fixing broken WAV files (eg. with invalid headers), which it isn't. In hindsight, I should have chosen a different name, but I'm stuck with it now.

It is a 32 bit program that runs on all versions of Windows from Windows 98 onwards. Note that from release 4.9.1, it no longer runs on Windows 95. This is because it was necessary to change the program help to a CHM file in order to maintain compatibility with Windows Vista, and CHM files are not supported by Windows 95.

Wave Repair is not a general purpose digital audio editor (in particular, it does not includes arbitrary copy/cut/paste editing of WAV files). Rather, Wave Repair eases many of the tasks that are required during restoration of music recorded from vinyl records, and which are often difficult using general purpose tools. I wrote it because I was unable to find an affordable WAV file editor which performed these tasks easily.
