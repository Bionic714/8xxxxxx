,fistanleydo,2013-01-13T04:37Z,"For some reason this and a few other movies don't play on my Sony blu-ray player. It says file unsupported but I have played many xvid files on this player before. I tried resetting my system, which has worked in the past, but it didn't work this time. I have never had this problem with any of extreme's torrents. I use a mac to copy the files to a hard drive and then plug the hard drive into the usb on my blu-ray player. Any suggestions?"
,mexicoflor,2013-01-15T01:18Z,"Thank you so much, I've previewed and it looks good!  Thanks for your time."
,Mr_Heisenberg,2013-01-15T23:18Z,"Good looking screener, definitely watchable. I however didn't realize this movie was a musical, which i cant bring myself to watch musicals. It takes away from the story line for me but thanks anyways EZ, nice work as usual.
