Encoded The Yu-Gi-Oh! Capsule Monsters Movie II into MKV h.264 format with English Audio.

Finding this movie was a bit harder than the others so I decided to encode this myself in high quality. This is easily the best quality version of this movie that you will find online.

Want The First Capsule Monsters Movie? I encoded it as well and it can be found in my uploads

Like the Yu-Gi-Oh! TV Series? I encoded it as well and It can be found in my uploads

For playback all you need is the proper codec if you dont already have it. 
Combined Community Codec Pack (which I prefer) or the K-Lite Codec pack should give you all you need and more to play these back.

You should be able to hear audio just fine if you have one of the mentioned codec packs above. If you cannot hear any audio and do not want to install a codec pack for some reason, then you do not have and need the nero aac audio codec. As of today it can be found here.
