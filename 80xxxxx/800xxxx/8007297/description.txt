I ripped the original 13 individual DVD volumes by Funimation, that were released before any of the sets were. 

Encoded all 51 episodes of The original series into high quality MKV h.264 format with both English and Japanese audio, and with all of the Subtitles as well.

Now you can enjoy this great series in a great quality encode. I can promise that this is the best quality version out there as of today with confidence.

For playback all you need is the proper codec if you dont already have it. 
Combined Community Codec Pack (which I prefer) or the K-Lite Codec pack should give you all you need and more to play these back.

You should be able to hear audio just fine if you have one of the mentioned codec packs above. If you cannot hear any audio and do not want to install a codec pack for some reason, then you do not have and need the nero aac audio codec. As of today it can be found here.
