,runtimmy,2013-01-11T17:38Z,thanks  again 
,Shirako99,2013-01-11T18:30Z,Your awwwwwwwwwesome thenoobish thanks for upload DMC
,Tegra3,2013-01-11T18:32Z,Ps3 3.55 n Rogero Scene is dead... Xbox 360 RGH is the place to be. Why I said this because I own both consoles and Xbox is so much easier to get games to work + no waiting for some Fixes. Thank You by the way.
,Shirako99,2013-01-11T18:59Z,But PS3 It's the best for me
,majuaraan,2013-01-11T19:35Z,@ tegra 3 you should try rebug
,romhunter,2013-01-11T19:40Z,"@Tegra3
You don't know anything about PS3-Scene. You are an ignorant. I got slim PS3 in REBUG 4.30.1 STD CFW and I can play all new games. If you keep in 3.55 CFW, shut up!

By the way, X360 is cool but uses DVD and games got poor quality compared with PS3.
And yeah, Rogero stuff is sh!t

@
Thanks, man!"

,Anon0x82,2013-01-12T11:07Z,"There is one file that does not get patched (by multiMan) to run this game on cfw 4.30. DUPLEX, released the file and instructions on where to move/replace it. So now this game works perfectly. Maybe, thenoobish will upload the file or search my friends! -_- "
,Anon0x82,2013-01-12T11:25Z,I got this working but you need something to get this to work! Dunno what happen to my comment about it 0well.

,flaviud,2013-01-12T13:53Z,"@Tegra3

Yeap, the ps3 scene is dead. You have the 3.55 fix in one day, but you can play on cfw 4.30 without the fix. Xbox sucks anyway "

,hbright84,2013-01-15T23:03Z,@spiderforpc. Learn how to spell you retard. PS3 can do all the things you so poorly tried to explain. The stuff you talk about is a bunch of stupid shit. You smell like NOOB all over!!!!
,Sublime90,2013-01-16T06:08Z,"@spiderforpc

Having all the systems,i can safely say the PS3 is way better than the 360.

heck the wii is better than the 360."
,007ankur,2013-01-16T07:03Z,does it work on pal region 
,007ankur,2013-01-16T07:05Z,does it work on pal version ps3 . plz help i want to download it 
,paerchu,2013-01-16T10:37Z,"Games developed exclusively for PS3 looks great overall, however, if it is multi-platform -- graphically wise, xbox 360 is greater than PS3 particularly in draw distance, textures, and shadows.

It's easier to run games in the xbox but if you have a fully customize PS3 firmware, extra thumbdrives and external drives -- rebug/debug and of those 4.30 CFW, then it's fair.

Value wise... PS3 > Xbox, clearly -- because of the bluray player. 

I know because I have every console plus an up-to-date PC (i7 920-GTX 670) 

:D Ups and downs. "
