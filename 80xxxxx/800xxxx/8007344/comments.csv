Audio - 9  very decent sound
Video - 7.5 for a screener it's pretty good but iv'e seen much better, on a 50inch Plasma it's a little grainy and not too sharp on images.

Audio is in Sync and the black borders have been rmoved (RLSLOG) i haven't watched it personally, just skipped through it.

Enjoy and +1 to the Uploader."
