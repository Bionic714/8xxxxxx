,HateMyJewHair,2013-01-11T18:08Z,Final issue? Is someone else taking over or is the series just ending? This started out with such promise.
[V],STFmaryville,2013-01-11T21:10Z,"Larsen announced several months ago that he wasn't continuing it. He may want to focus on Savage Dragon more, but honestly I suspect it has more to do with Rob Liefeld quitting DC and returning to his own properties."
,KryptonX7,2013-01-11T22:09Z,"Yeah, Liefeld has been rumored to be going back to Image to relaunch Extreme. Hopefully this will be a good thing and we can get some of those old school comics back like Youngblood, Brigade, Bloodstrike and Bloodwulf"
