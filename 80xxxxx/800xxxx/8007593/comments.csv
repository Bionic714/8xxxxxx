The main purpose that it's done by religious groups is to decrease sensation and discourage masturbation.  Did you know you lost a lot of the nerve endings in your penis when your foreskin was taken away?
If my arm or leg got taken away unnecessarily I would definitely complain about it. "

I'm sorry you blow your load so soon, but genital mutilation is wrong, male or female."

My parents aren't bad for circumcising me, it's you guys pointing it out who are bad!"" Classic kill the messenger shit."
