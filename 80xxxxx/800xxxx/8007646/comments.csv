,Ecstasio,2013-01-11T20:29Z,"Thanks. I grabbed this last night from two other sources and both had a luhe.sirefef.a infection. Not a false positive either. I do hope this one is clean and can only assume it will be, if not then I would be suspicious about the original release and TiNYiSO."
[V],Gh0stNet,2013-01-11T22:20Z,I can assure you that this is the original TINYISO release but cant say anything about the any infection
,Ecstasio,2013-01-11T23:34Z,Thanks for the response Gh0st. I was exceptionally careful with this when it completed and hit it with a number of checks. It came back with one standard  false positive trojan via Malware Bytes Pro. It's clean and good to go and now happily installed and working on my system. The moral of the story is for me not to f*cking download from anywhere but TPB. Thanks again ;)
