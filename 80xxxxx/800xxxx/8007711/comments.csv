,sososo93,2013-01-12T14:05Z,"@talekk 
if he is crackable why all tentative are down for all stuff because fsdreamteam use a server validation when you start FSX always need to registred ""bglmanx.dll""  or something i have buy GSX and always the prog in background check the license file dude its sure!!"
[T],_SnakEye,2013-01-12T14:13Z,"nothing is uncrackable , there just not enough demand in the PC world for FSX stuff for the heavy guns crackers to have a look at it.
I personally purchased  GSX, I don't know why you guys don't if you so know you going to be using it."
[T],_SnakEye,2013-01-12T20:55Z,"Everything is possible, it just not of the public interest to recruit SKIDROW and big groups like them to crack it.
face it, FSX is a small gaming market margin.
that means no one is really putting their energy on cracking those more complex Protection."

,cheetah_cheetah2,2013-01-14T07:32Z,"@vanzmelo
