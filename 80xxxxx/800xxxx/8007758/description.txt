THE STORY

A five man US fire team out of firebase Aries, Vietnam, deploys deep into the jungles near the Cambodian border to investigate the sudden silence of a deep listening post.

A Chinese American infantry grunt follows his squad and the questionable leadership of a battle-worn Sergeant who sees him as one of the enemy into a dark, seeping tunnel system crawling with Viet Cong guerillas and the interred bodies of their dead.

A deep cover CIA agent, posing as a newsman, accompanies a jaded starlet on her propaganda junket to Cambodia, only to turn his attentions to his true mission as assassin in Vietnam.

An untried Captain assumes leadership of a beleaguered firebase on the edge of "Indian Country" during one of the most explosive periods of the entire Vietnam conflict. Side by side with the camp's alcoholic surgeon, he will hold the line and defend his tiny island of resistance against threats anticipated and unbelievable.

All these disparate stories and the people who lived them will converge on February 13, 1968 ... the day when hell gave up its hungry dead and a whole new war began.

'68 ... history stops here.
