Info:


This is my personal collection of Acoustic and Unplugged music.
I collected this over the past couple of years.

It contains over 600+ songs by various artists, in various bitrates.

Every single file in this collection i downloaded somewhere, sometime by some uploader/release group.

I did not rename any of the files that have the name of the uploader/release group in it.

So i hope that everyone that downloads this collection has as much enjoyment of it as i have everyday.


Misc folder contains loose files(not in a album).
Some rare acoustic have a low bitrate and low quality, 
but the song it self performed by that artist was just to good to throw away 
because there were no origional(retail released video or audio) recordings ever made.



Credits:

All credits to everything go out to there respectfull artist/uploader/release group.


I hereby want to thank every single uploader/release group.
Without the time and effort u guys/girls put into this everyday, 
we would have never been able to enjoy all the media now floating around in cyberspace.
