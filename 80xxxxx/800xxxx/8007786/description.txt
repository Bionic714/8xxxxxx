              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This new, fully revised second edition of Fundamentals of Molecular Virology is designed for university students learning about virology at the undergraduate or graduate level. Chapters cover most of the major virus families, emphasizing the unique features of each virus family. These chapters are designed to tell stories about the viruses covered, and include information on discovery, diseases and pathogenesis, virus structure, steps in viral replication, and interaction with cellular signaling pathways. This approach portrays the 'personality' of each virus, helping students to learn the material and to build up their knowledge of virology, starting with smaller and simpler viruses and proceeding to more complex viruses.
