,miyoko56,2013-01-17T21:31Z,"Whenever i open the file and change it to english and i try to start the game, it shows the engine logo then a black screen with the main menu music playing. It works when its in russian. What am i doing wrong?"
,tmanga14,2013-01-17T23:23Z,"yeah miyoko, im having the same problem"
,Noonga,2013-01-21T11:28Z,"This is fucking ridiculous, what a waste of a download. At least put in a fucking guide as to how to get it in english. Next mention it's in Russian.

If it gets sorted though, like a guide is posted. All will be well."
,Delta42O,2013-01-31T20:40Z,"Guys for the black screen issue, you have to download the english.pak and put it in localized folder in the game directory.

Edit the system.cfg with English as language as mentioned above."
,kagami420,2013-02-05T17:58Z,thank you uploader
,kagami420,2013-02-05T18:00Z,"after installing the game is working fine. just need to download english pak from here

,kagami420,2013-02-05T18:08Z,"download english pak from here
http://www.2shared.com/complete/-7Ps0kYS/English.html"
,kagami420,2013-02-05T19:29Z,if u try edit system.cfg inside the game folder it'l  says acces is denied. so copy paste the system.cfg outside the folder and edit it. delete the orginal system.cfg and copy paste the earliar edited system.cfg into the game folder.
,Nate8466,2013-02-08T00:05Z,"Honestly this really pisses me off. When you post a torrent in Russian (hopefully knowing some English speaking people may want it, not knowing it's in Russian) you could at least have the brains to put in the English pak or say ""HEY ITS IN RUSSIAN GUYS"". Fucking prick. At least some people put a download to the English pak in their comments. So in conclusion: fuck you."
,expandingballoon,2013-03-27T03:51Z,"Okay, so you are just going to put the english pak into the game file, not into the folder where the russian pak is.
like so: http://imgur.com/M8H5iP4
Butl, the cutscenes will still be in russian. Does anyone know how to fix this?"
,expandingballoon,2013-03-29T03:48Z,I see how to do it now. That's what you guys meant by editing the cfg. Thanks for upload and all of the comments (the helpful ones at least)
