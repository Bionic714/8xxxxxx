,testname,2013-01-11T20:11Z,Thanks for the up.  I checked your torrents; you've had a lot.  I'm sure you shared stuff I've gotten before.  Thanks for all of the previous ups also; you've contributed much.
,reneshakil,2013-01-11T20:28Z,"u r welcome mate.
i wants to upload more as long as comics come, but here's some people didn't pleased what u've done. instead of thanks, they just complained. and today someone used foul language over my torrent description.
i think it's better to stop upload than humiliate myself."
