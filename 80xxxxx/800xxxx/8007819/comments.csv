,jumjumb,2013-01-12T12:25Z,Does this work with G5-PPC-Macs?  :o)
,atinexus,2013-01-12T19:26Z,This is the full retail image with support back to PPC G4 867mhz minimum. :)
,jumjumb,2013-01-13T16:19Z,"Thanks Atinexus 

I am looking forward to try this. The other torrents with Mac OS 10.5 used to make only a new install, but give you not the option to 'actualize' (I hope its the right word. In German its 'aktualisieren') the system. 
Hope this one can do it.  :o)"
,atinexus,2013-01-13T18:20Z,I am not sure Jumjumb all I know is that this is my full retail disc in ISO format. Hope it works for you!!!
,geo.metro,2013-01-18T08:26Z,"anyone get this to work on a  iBook G4, 1.4GHz, 1 GB of RAM?  Running Mac OS 10.4.11 now, Can not find a 10.5 that works!  !0.4 worked no problem on my older G3 dino, but I want 10.5 for my nice G4 iBook.  Tired of making DL DVD coasters.  Any ideas out there?  Will gladly pay shipping if I could find this OS for a good (low) price"
,atinexus,2013-01-21T18:51Z,geo.metro If you are using the internal DVD drive make sure that it is double layer DVD compatible or try an external DVD drive to boot from the disc. This should work on your iBook!
