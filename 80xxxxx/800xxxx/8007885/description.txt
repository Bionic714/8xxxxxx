Ok.  here is the deal.  This is the iso of the concert they did in Belgium.
You can find a few clips of it on youtube. Search Scala and Kolacny california dreamin

This is the same group that did "Nothing Else matters" in the new Zero Dark Thirty movie.

Its iso. AND its PAL.  yeah i know..but you cannot find this anywhere. It televised on PBS, and even PBS didnt keep a copy of it. Phillips makes a dvd player that plays PAL.  Thats what i have.

I found it in 100 pieces on Usenet...downloaded it.repaired it..and here it is.
