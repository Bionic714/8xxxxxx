This is absolutely one of my favorite apps, and I own over 200 photo apps. I would give it 10 stars if I could and each update keeps getting better and better. It is so feature rich that if I could only pick one app for my collection, it would be icolorama hands down.

Outstanding app for photography and illustration work. I just completed and published a book of illustrations created from photographs using this app. I am able to do more innovative work with this app on the iPad than any other I have used to date. Thank you!

This app can do so many things that other photo apps can't- It doesn't have layers But its got Everything else: wonderful adjustments and terrific filters and it's magic! Five stars plus!
