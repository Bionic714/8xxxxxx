,Pakosan,2013-01-12T09:31Z,This plays only HALF the movie. Something is wrong.
,tororosso85,2013-01-12T11:22Z,"The avi file has problem...
I can't convert it to dvd (""breaks"" at 67 minute) or to add subtiltes with avirecomp or aviaddxsubs...
I spent 15 minutes of my time,to download nothing...."

,zophras43,2013-01-12T22:59Z,"To fix this file: use VirtualDub to open this AVI file. Let it rebuilt the AVI when it's opening. Then ensure both Video and Audio are set to ""Direct Stream Copy"" from the pulldown menus on main application window. Click File>Save as AVI and save with a new name. Then use HandBreak to encode the new AVI file made with VirtualDub to another format. This worked for me."
,ectoendomezo,2013-01-13T03:25Z,"Don't know about anyone else..but via VLC..this file works flawlessly..is clear (no Moire' or 'filters' a la ""Hitchcock"" screener) AND..even has (Thank You/Thank You/Thank You) Hardcoded English Subs ..a little out of sync in ONE Brief quick scene.. but otherwise INVALUABLE (and of course imho HC'd subs are THE sadly Continuing Mortal Fatal Flaw in Torrents..so..its a BIG plus to have them)

So again for ME and for a Screener?:

Without Hesitation and Absolutely...A10/V10

There is a particularly nasty ""Warning"" that creeps in..but its briefly present and then gone again and only shows a few times and..So What?

REALLY nice file..I am frankly amazed..best of the ""For Your Consideration"" Screeners I've seen so far this year..so..THANKS TvTeam! Bravisimo!"
,ectoendomezo,2013-01-13T03:29Z,"Oh Yeah..also:

M 10

Great Movie far as I'm concerned..one of the best this year.

Great Story..Great Acting..Amazing Casting (similarities to actual perps/vics is AMAZING)..great directing..and the ""ca. 1979/80 Hollywood"" made THIS x-er PINE for the Last Of The Innocence..

Ben you Magnificent Bastid..Great Job! If Oscar has ANY meaning? They've got not choice but to Award this film up the wazoo.

Umm..For Your Consideration.."
,SAMSON4X,2013-01-20T09:28Z,"I had the problem too of not being able to convert this to DVD format. It stops at 67 minutes. Odd thing is it plays flawlessly to the end, but if I try to convert it the movie stops at 67 minutes. I will have to find another copy to download that's convertable. I see someone else has a solution of using Virtualdub, then Handbrake, then another program to convert to DVD...too much work and time, i will just download another copy from someone else, but thanks to the uploader."
