Taboo Extreme Bodies
For some people, improving one's appearance can lead to extreme body modification. Meet the "Vampire Woman"-she's a lawyer, a mother, and the world's most modified female, with 96% tattoo coverage, several sets of horns, arm implants, and 25 piercings. Meanwhile, artist Keroppy is leading the way in the trendy body modification industry. His newest exhibition features "bagelheads," people with what looks like a small bagel protruding from their foreheads.
