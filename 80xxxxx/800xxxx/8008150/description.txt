2013-01-11 mikedreams on... Way past bedtime. Got Lana on my mind. 

I signed up today for the email-alert of Lana Across America... 

There will be love.

This TS is not the richest and sharpest file I have ever seen -- it's AVC not MPEG-2, unfortunately someone was cutting corners? -- but it'll more than do just fine.

And this is with her full band, which is what I was looking for in the first place. And what I hope to see later this year in the USA. 

Here Miss Del Rey casts her heavenly hell in light touches, while throwing down some, sweet hot sneers! Enough to wring tears from these tired eyes. For The King lives inside The Queen. She got her Video Game face on. 

Anyway, I don't mind at all if the strings come along across America later this year, as long as the beat goes on. 

Come what may, as long as this beat poet-singer brings it here, I am there for the taking...

"Take your body downtown, honey... It's all for you."

Enjoy.


Caps...
