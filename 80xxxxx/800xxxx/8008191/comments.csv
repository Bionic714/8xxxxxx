,friherrekurre,2013-03-01T07:00Z,Unfortunately there are a few places in this version where the picture goes all pixley and the film hacks. Other than that it's a nice copy.

as said before in parts it gets bad but is watchable
I will say about 30min have been cut from this and i see no reason why. If you havent seen this you wont miss it but if you have i would look elsewhere for the full copy."
[T],nomad_runner,2013-03-28T20:17Z,"gismo, I don't know what you're talking about when you say 30 minutes are missing. I just watched it again and it's complete. Maybe your player skipped or something. The movie is complete. "
,lewsur,2013-04-08T12:29Z,I can't wait for them to officially release a BD version of this movie. I have the standard DVD and the soundtrack is amazing in 5.1. Such a shame to be 2Ch.
