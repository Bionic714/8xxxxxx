[T],TeamExtreme,2013-01-12T00:27Z,"""No need to install?"" This is an installer it installs/extracts all the files to %appdata%
""No need to put serials etc"" That's because we built the launcher.
""No boring installation of tool-bars"" The TE launcher never had any of this in the installer.
""This makes a portable version"" its not portable.

The_Duck1 this is not portable, it's an installer. Once Minecraft is installed your installer acts like an icon. You could have saved yourself quite some time if you just uploaded our Minecraft Launcher file which is less than 1mb big. The Launcher will download all the files needed."
