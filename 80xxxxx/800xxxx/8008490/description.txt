Fan cut of Friday The 13th The Final Chapter with extended and bloodier death scenes. Also includes the alternate dream sequence ending (no dialogue in that scene so I put music to it). This took me 3 full days to cut (extra to fix 1 bad cut).

It could be better, it could be worse too. I can not be logged on all the time, but will try to stay on as much as possible. Please help share this, thank you and enjoy my 8th upload (RE-Upload).

Run time 1:34:55, Widescreen, 2.0 stereo, blah blah... 


THIS IS A RE-UP TO CORRECT A EDIT GLITCH WHEN 'JIMMY' GOT IT... FIXED NOW
