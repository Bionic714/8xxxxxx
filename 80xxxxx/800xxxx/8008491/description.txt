The fourth in Matador's series of deluxe editions of the five classic Pavement albums is a rather joyous pop explosion after the complications of "Wowee Zowee". The double CD set, again packaged in an embossed slipcase with gorgeous 62-page perfect-bound booklet, contains the remastered original twelve-song album, ten non-album B-sides, ten outtakes, and fourteen live radio session takes.

Matador Records released an expanded 2CD edition of this album under the title Brighten the Corners: Nicene Creedence Edition on December 9, 2008.[6] It contains the band's fourth album, Brighten the Corners (1997) in its entirety, as well as 32 of the band's other songs from that era, 18 of which were previously unreleased. The initial pre-order offer from Matador Records also included the band's previously unreleased live album, Live Europaturn√©n MCMXCVII on 12" vinyl.
