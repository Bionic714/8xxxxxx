,Kataron,2013-01-12T02:59Z,"Oh, nice. Been waiting for this one. If it's anything like the first one, this will be awesome. Glad DC still puts out animated films now and then, they do a great job with them. Thanks, Extremezone."

,vatel88,2013-01-12T23:57Z,"To those that care(like myself) about having a full copy of this movie- THIS COPY IS MISSING AUDIO FOR THE LAST HALF. The entire movie is present but the commentary and the preview for the new superman movie are both missing audio.

Thanks extremezone for the effort but this is still incomplete (a disposable copy some would say)."
,duckkiller76,2013-01-13T07:37Z,I might have missed it but has extremezone posted a copy of argo yet?
[V],extremezone,2013-01-13T20:24Z,duckkiller76 will do when a good copy will be out-not bad audio as all version out/dvdscr
