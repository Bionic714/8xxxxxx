,dekode12,2013-01-16T06:43Z,why is it only 1.62 gigs shouldnt 42 hours be alot more then that?? i saw another one on this site with 4 gigs isnt that closer to what gigs we need?
,mykillk,2013-01-17T06:21Z,"No, 1.62 is plenty. Audiobooks sound just fine as low as 64 kpbs. The other guy uploaded 128 kpbs files which is a huge waste for audiobooks."
,mykillk,2013-01-17T06:22Z,In fact I have both and I think this sounds better
,darkphinix,2013-01-21T08:50Z,"Will try this, thanks in advance."
,zepheera,2013-02-14T21:42Z,"Just to verify, is this the unabridged version?"
,mykillk,2013-02-18T06:47Z,Wheel of Time audiobooks are always in unabridged format
