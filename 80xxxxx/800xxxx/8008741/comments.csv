well with the program ( btw thanks you guys beast and dechronic etc ), but the problem only arises when we try to activate advanced Inventory.

Another way to verify if the program is actually activated for good is to go to Help Menu and look at My Licence Information http://img577.imageshack.us/img577/2705/20130124202257.jpg. If it's greyed out, the program is not activated, like mine, which after following all the instructions by @ganie1608 and @Beast_iND still remains to be registered to run without time limitations.
Because My Licence Information is greyed out, the program has to be registered. If you click on Register QuickBooks... you'll then see the following screen http://img688.imageshack.us/img688/9803/20130124195048.jpg, which proves that the program has to be registered to run indefinitely.

Have you tried the solution pointed out to me by @dive8? 

""This doesn't look like a problem, just follow the instructions in the activator. Disconnect from internet, Close QB, run activator, click GO, click Yes, when instrucions pop up open QB, Begin Registration, Activation code 99999930, click next, click Finish, click OK in activator, and you're done.

The property and customer number is 99999930.
So, read the above instructions carefully, and provided that you get across with the UK product code and licence number, everything else should be fine.

Below, is a summary of events leading to a successful install, hopefully clarified and condensed a little, for simplicity’s sake. I cannot thank the above uploaders, coders, and posters enough! You people rule!

QB 2013 Pro: installation on Win8 running Classic Shell.

Install QB Pro normally. Use License no.: 1063-0575-1585-222   Product no.: 833-891 for installation.

Following installation, on subsequent restarts it will advise of 29 days (or less) left and prompt for activation. Ignore it.

Close QB and use task manager to finish off additional running QB programs (I found 3 of them).

Disable internet.

Run Activator V0.6 Build 70 - BEAST. (I ran it as administrator, just to be safe, and it worked fine that way)

Click “Go”

Click “Yes”

When the instructions pop up, open up QB. I left “additional licenses” option alone.

Begin registration process, you’re looking for PHONE registration, and if you cannot get it (I couldn’t), then click Help in QB, then About, then hit “ctrl-r” and then hit “ctrl-p” and the phone activation dialog should open up.

Enter 99999930 for the activation code.

Click “Next”

Click “Finish”

Click “Ok” in activator.

If QB asks for property or customer number, enter the same 99999930.

Enjoy the thrills and excitement of keeping a ledger, using Quickbooks Pro 2013!"
