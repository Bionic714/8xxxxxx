I've literally been trying to get this show for the last 4 years and trying to watch it on YouTube was just a total fucking Hassle.

Really Appreciate it, BloodyThorns."
,GambitWallstar,2013-01-28T15:47Z,Took a while to download but looks to be good. Watched several episodes and the quality is right on the mark for what I was expecting. Thanks again.
,GambitWallstar,2013-02-05T01:38Z,"Could you get North Shore with ALL 21 Episodes? Not just the 20 that aired in the US. There's already a copy on here but Episode 13 is messed up and there's no Episode 21. 

Just Figured I'd ask since you came through on this one..."
