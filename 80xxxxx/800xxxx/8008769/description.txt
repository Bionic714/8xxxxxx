For XVID AVI with MP3 audio, too tired, but to suppose:
V=9
A=9
.
So, for those who need a re-cap ...
The S10E15 I posted on the 2nd was really a dupe of S10E16 (VG-1)
The BBC in its infinite wisdom decided that S10E15 comes after S10E17 (VG-2)
Which is today. I checked - it is indeed "Jolly". Every source agrees on this.
So, what about FTP? They are using wikipedia numbering (15-16-17) 17-Jolly
Whereas I'm using BBC numbering (16-17-15) 15-Jolly
Confused? Well, I for one find that Quite Interesting ...
.
Best news - it appears the there's an XL coming tomorrow (hurrah)
