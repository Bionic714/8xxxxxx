Why waste your time by uploading duplicate torrents? For Christ's sakes, people..."
,werdbooty,2013-05-28T09:11Z,"@BaronVonWatermelon: before you start criticizing another's torrent, let's actually take a look at what's in here. Firstly, this ""duplicate"" torrent includes two music videos yours does not. Secondly, this torrent has a vastly superior description than yours; I can actually see what I'm going to get here, as opposed to the mishmash of tracks you've jumbled into your torrent (which includes no pertinent info other than ""320kbps"", a release date and a bunch of uselessly incorrect tags). Oh, and thirdly, a direct quote from the description on your torrent:

""I know this one's on TPB already, but the other uploads are both from the same shitty source.""

Odd you're giving someone shit for uploading duplicate torrents, hey?

Oh yeah, and this one has better seeds than your ""very well seeded"" torrent.

Learn what ""Info Hash"" means before you start spouting about ""exact same"" torrents. And open your damned eyes. Fool."
