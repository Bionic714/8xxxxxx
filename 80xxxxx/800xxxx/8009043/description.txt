On July 10 1987, Brazilian businessman Marcio Schitini was killed in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, by hit-men hired by his business partner Carlos da Silva Gurgel. Marcio was 34 years old. Although Gurgel spent some time in jail, today he is a free man. To add insult to injury, he is a successful businessman who tries to hide away his past, as per this video: http://videolog.tv/video.php?id=591922
