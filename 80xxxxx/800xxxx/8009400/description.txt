Ok, first off. Before you begin downloading and watching, I used the wrong codecs for the audio, so you're going to need to install VLC Media Player or the K-Lite Codec Pack. 

I'm really sorry about that, I completely forgot to use AC3. I used AAC, and hence most computers can't play it. I have yet to try it on another system, but comments should explain that. :P

Here are some screenshots I saved from the file:

Anyway, this is IPASuperior here. I have decided to release a super-small copy of The Hunger Games (adding up to 2.57 GB)

The framerate is 23.9776233. I can't remember the bitrate.

The exact dimensions of the video is 1920x800. This is becuase most films are filmed in CinemaScope. (I think it's called that XD)

Just download and enjoy. And please, people. Seed? :D
