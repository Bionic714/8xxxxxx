This is the first of the Ball-Stick-Bird books:

which are, unfortunately out of print. My copy has been through so many kids that it was falling apart and scanning it was a lot more work than I'd expected so I hope somebody else can use this file too. Some of the references to outer space might be a bit dated, as everybody was caught up in the "man on the moon" craze during the '60s and early '70s, but they are still the most interesting, respectful, and twaddle-free reading instruction books that I have encountered. They are just as suitable for four year olds who want to learn how to read as they are for skeptical dyslexic teens. This file is formatted to work with a Kindle but I still recommend printing it out on heavy card stock and putting it in a binder if you can afford to do so.
