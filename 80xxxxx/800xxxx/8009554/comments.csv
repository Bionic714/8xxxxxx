This series is terribly hard to get in English, and has a great plot that I would rather not read through subs to understands. Thanks for the torrent!"

Always check on the top of the torrent info, it will typically tell you what the spoken language(s) and subtitle(s) are in the torrent.

So look up on the top of this page, look under the Type, Files, Size, and Info column, it says:
Spoken language(s): English

This means this torrent is English Dubbed.

There is no column for subtitles, which means there is no english or japanese subtitles.

Look through the other torrents, check the top of the page like I just explained to you."

The only problem with this upload has to be the fact that it's dubbed =P
Even still, Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood English Dub 1 to 64, amazing quality.
