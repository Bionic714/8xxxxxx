www.psychicbutsane.com/

But what makes the multitudinous flavours of religion any different?  At least the loony UFO spotters expect derision, but question a person's religious beliefs and they go to war!"
,SciBooks,2013-01-26T03:20Z,"Anna Sayce from psychicbutsane seems to be the exact kind of person this book was written about.  She is selling classes in Psychic awakenings and aura healings.. where did her ideas come from?  what started the train of though that lead to her trying to sell this to others?  Why hasn't anyone tried to tell her it's simply her worldview rather than a product?  If they have, why didn't it make a difference?  Interesting case study there.  Pity about the damage it does to people not understanding the difference between a fervent grasp on an opinion versus medical science. "
