Contact (1997)
What Dreams May Come (1998)
Thank You For Smoking (2005)
The Children of Huang Shi (2008)
The Visitor (2007)
Rendition (2007)
Trade (2007)
Pay It Forward (2000)
October Sky (1999)
The Last King of Scotland (2006)
The Hurricane (1999)
Frost-Nixon (2008)
Dogma (1999)
The Fisher King (1991)
The Good Shepherd (2006)

Any of these would be awesome!"
