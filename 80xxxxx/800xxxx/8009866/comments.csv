""OUT THERE"" follows the coming-of-age adventures of Chad, his little brother Jay, and best friend Chris. Living in a small town, the boys run face first into the wall of adolescence, the horrors of puberty, first loves, mortal enemies, local legends, and social ostracism. They experience the wonderment and frustration of that terrifying limbo between childhood and adulthood. Growing up is weird to do… ""OUT THERE"".
