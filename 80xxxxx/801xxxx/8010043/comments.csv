,yasunori,2013-01-15T20:00Z,"There are screenshots, for fucks sake. What else do you need really, trust your own eyes rather then arbitrary scores that are in some way related to opinion of random entitled mouthbreathers"
,asmodeus130,2013-01-17T06:18Z,"Whats the point in the comments field then dipshit? Its easy enough to ignore the morons wasting space like you. Some cut who's downloaded it comment on the quality. Can you identify encoding glitches, poor audio, audio out of sync, watermarks, hard coded subs, etc from screens you dumb cunt?"
,jvjv,2013-01-18T05:46Z,and still neither one of you cock in the ass fags leave any comments about the movie . Just a couple of jizz eaters

Best copy I've found yet. The top 2 in the list, while they have more seeders than this one, the video doesn't match the audio and this one does. Great job!"

This is as good as any DVD Rip. High Quality video and the audio just skips a few times but sounds perfect."
