Now expanded and in full colour throughout, ORAL MICROBIOLOGY retains its unique ecological approach to the subject which helps the reader determine whether an organism will have a pathogenic or commensal relationship at a given site. In the new edition, greater emphasis is placed on the role of current molecular biology techniques in the understanding of oral microbes. The book also provides insight into current therapeutic and prophylactic antibiotic use, infection control, and the relationships between oral and general health. New authorship also offers additional expertise on viral and fungal pathogens and the role of oral microbes in acute and chronic infections.

- Successfully describes the complex relationship between the resident oral microflora and the host in health and disease
- Retains a unique ecological approach to the subject which benefits the reader by providing a clear set of principles to explain the underlying issues that determine whether the microflora will have a beneficial or an adverse relationship with the host at a particular site
- Published for the first time in full colour, Oral Microbiology has been expanded and completely rewritten with almost 100 brand new illustrations
- Includes discussion of the latest molecular biology techniques which have revolutionized our knowledge of oral microbes
- Highlights the biological and clinical significance of the existence of the oral microflora in the form of a biofilm on dental and mucosal surfaces
- Includes contemporary views on therapeutic and prophylactic antibiotic use, infection control, and the relationships between oral and general health
- New authorship offers further expertise on viral and fungal pathogens and the role of oral microbes in acute and chronic infections
