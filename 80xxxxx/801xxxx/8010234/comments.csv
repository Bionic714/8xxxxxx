,CarrotStickles,2013-03-19T01:51Z,Am downloading now. Will post later with the results. So far it looks legit to me so yay.
,CarrotStickles,2013-03-19T05:11Z,"It works great. You do have to download something else to make it work though. Just search for ""Plogue ARIA Engine"" and that's all you have to get. Really easy to all download. Thanks for the upload. "
