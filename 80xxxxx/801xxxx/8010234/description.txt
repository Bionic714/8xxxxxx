This software synth turns your VST, AU or RTAS host into a classic video game console, vintage 8-bit home computer and even an 80ΓÇ▓s arcade.

Plogue chipsounds authentically emulates 15 vintage 8-bit era sound chips (on top of their variants), down to their smallest idiosyncrasies.

But more interestingly, it also faithfully allows you to dynamically reproduce the accidentally discovered sounds effect tricks and abusive musical techniques that were made famous by innovative chip music composers and classic video game sound designers, which for the good part of the last 3 decades, have pushed beyond the boundaries of the original chip designs.

In short, whether you are already versed into chiptune/chip music or just interested in those sounds, this is one unique instrument for you!
