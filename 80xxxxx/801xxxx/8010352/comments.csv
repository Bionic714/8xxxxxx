[T],MrUnpopular,2013-01-12T17:53Z,"We don't do 720p, buy it off iTunes or wait for another group."
[T],MrUnpopular,2013-01-12T18:11Z,"Sorry about the audio issues in the release, forgot to double check for them. Just be glad we released it, and wait for another group if you're impatient. If you think you can release better, go ahead."
,LordWalterW,2013-01-12T18:23Z,is a joke?? Picture is cuted on top and bottom and quality is VHS
,LordWalterW,2013-01-12T18:27Z,"And no MrUnpopular, i cant release better (I have no acces to Discovery USA) but if you doing something you should do it perfectly, not shit like that"
[T],MrUnpopular,2013-01-12T18:33Z,"@LordWalterW It's not over cropped, it just looks that way. It's an SD source that's letterboxed so we cut out the back. It has 100% the actual picture. (but letterboxed sources usually cut out part of the channel logo and episode rating)"
[T],MrUnpopular,2013-01-12T19:31Z,Stop your bitching and get Gold Rush Alaska S03E10 HDTV x264-KILLERS
,K4YM1K,2013-01-13T00:17Z,"That's some terrible terrible quality...
Sound and video get rather choppy after about ten minutes : /"
,Ryzoz,2013-01-13T02:49Z,"Thanks for your time to upload, but the quality is terrible, as other have said."
,13ip0lar,2013-01-13T12:24Z,^Ditto. Thanks for you time and effort but no thanks. This literally has to be worse than 480p.
