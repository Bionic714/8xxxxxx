,kosterm,2013-01-30T06:38Z,"Wow.  I have seen better student films in elementary school.  I am not exagerating.  Amateur camera work or a bunch of exteriors of the same hotel fronts and signs over and over.  No interiors so the guy obviously had no permits.  I think he actually shot his moving shots from a bus.  Very poor audio quality caused by NO understanding of microphones.  The host reads off the page as strange music fades in and out like some twits is playing with the knob.  But, if you want a laugh, listen to the host mispronounce words like architect (arkutec), mogul (mongol) and gondolier (gondolina).  Hilarious."
