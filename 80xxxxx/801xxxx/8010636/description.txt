Trekkies (1999)& (2004)
Are "Trekkies" (or "Trekkers") just a bunch of geeks, loners, and societal outcasts who've found their niche on the fandom convention circuit? This delightful film proves that the stereotypes are simultaneously valid and woefully myopic, because the people introduced here are only as strange as you make them. We could just as easily embrace them as ideal citizens of the United Federation of Planets, living Gene Roddenberry's fictional future on present-day Earth. Who's to say theirs is not a better world than ours? Superbly directed by Roger Nygard and hosted by Denise Crosby (who played Tasha Yar on Star Trek: The Next Generation), the film offers splendid interview segments with all of the original Star Trek cast, and many from later Trek series,

2)  2004 Disc 2 
As promised, the sequel to Trekkies presents an expanded universe of Star Trek fandom, and even curmudgeonly Klingons will enjoy this globetrotting trek of discovery. NextGen alumnus Denise Crosby returns as host of this sincerely appreciative survey of Trek enthusiasts from the U.S.A., Germany, England, Australia, Italy, Brazil, France, and even war-torn Serbia. Director Roger Nygard seizes the opportunity to revisit the most memorable fans from Trekkies, and Trek savants the world over will be delighted to learn that Ã¼ber-nerd Gabriel Koerner is not only married but happily employed as a digital-effects modeler (go, Gabe!), while Whitewater juror (and Starfleet Commodore) Barbara Adams continues to exemplify the Prime Directive in Little Rock, Arkansas. Emphasis is duly placed on the charitable activities of Trek devotees (yes, the Trekkies/Trekkers debate continues to rage), while "filk" singers and Trek tribute bands are given props for their musical inspiration. Most importantly, Trekkies 2 meaningfully explores of the motivation, purpose, and appropriateness of Trek fandom in a world that is still light-years away from the benevolent idealism that Star Trek represents. Trekkies 3 (due a few years later) promises to expand the survey to Asia, Africa, India, the Middle East, and Russia. Could this be the start of genuine unification?
