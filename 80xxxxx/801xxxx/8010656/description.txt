Catch The Rainbow - Ritchie Blackmore┬┤s Rainbow Tribute Band from Sweden.

We are five guys who, after many years of music making now gathered us to realize our dream. We have played in bands such as House Of Shakira, The Poodles, Mannish Boys, Shit Happens, PlayBoys and Double Douce. In all the years we have had a great fondness for Ritche BlackmoreΓÇÖs Rainbow. And now the time has come to realize that dream.
