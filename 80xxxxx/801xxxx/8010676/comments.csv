,krace1,2013-01-13T09:58Z,Hate to piss on the parade but 15 to 20 gigs is a bit more than some computers can handle. Good luck with that. After a few weeks of downloading I'm sure most of you will be pleased to find  its all on a rar file.

Actually it is a single ISO (disk image) file. Fortunately, most archive utilities (WinRAR, BetterZip, etc) can extract the contents without having to mount a disk partition..."

gatasalvaje--thanks for the up."
,00sweeney,2013-01-24T02:27Z,"Took about 80 hours altogether to download. YMMV. Extracted using WinRar. The vast majority of files downloaded correctly, but received multiple errors for the following:
A Little Light Music
Rupi's Dance 
Secret Language of Birds
Ian Plays the Orchestral
Thick as a Brick
25th Anniversary Box Set (discs 2 and 4 completely missing)
Best of 25th Anniversary (completely missing)
Christmas Album

Some of them are missing songs, some of them art. I suppose there's the possibility of user error, but I've clicked on ""Extract All"" many times before and it's always seemed to work for me. :)

Still, thanks again for the upload. I'll just grab these albums elsewhere.
"
,00sweeney,2013-01-24T02:37Z,"I do have one question, though--the ISO file is 15.5 gb and the extracted files are 12.1 gb. Even taking into account the files that didn't extract properly, that seems like a much larger amount than is missing. Why is that?"
,zoan06,2013-02-03T02:33Z,All this and no Thick as a Brick 40th Anniversary. *sigh* The search continues...
