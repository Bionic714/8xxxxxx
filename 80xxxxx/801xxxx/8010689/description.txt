Dear Sirs,

We are ready to introduce CAERA - the CAE Results Archiver. 
CAE codes like Ansys, Femap, Abaqus can easily generate datasets with an enormous size - up to several hundred gigabytes of data. 
In such cases, archiving and extraction of necessary values from the dataset becomes a non-trivial task. 
CAERA is able to compress CAE-specific datasets with a factor of 30 to 40 times, effectively outbinding conventional archivers like WinZip or WinRar.
Such performance level has been achieved by using special algorithms toghten-up for CAE staff only. Also the decompression speed of CAERA is considerably higher.


CAERA can be effectively used to transfer CAE studies via Internet, storing the results and operating them both on desktop and the cloud

╨íurrent release is designed to work with Siemens Femap. For instalation use "instal.bat" from the Torrents
