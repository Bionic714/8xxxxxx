This is the original prequel series to the current show. It is filmed on location in and around Dublin. - Not live as are the new "current"series
The storylines are the same in essence as to the 2 later stage series.(In some parts word for word)
It is interesting IMHO to see how some of the characters have evolved.
having said that I honestly dont think its as funny by far as the 2 newer "popular" panto style series, but hey ho, download and make your own mind up


 ..Parts 1-7 & (Bloomers) of the TV sitcom which evolved into the 'Mrs Brown'
stage plays, written and performed by Irish comedian Brendan O'Carroll.
