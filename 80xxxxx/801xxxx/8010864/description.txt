And here you go, one of my older scanlations, Agent 327 04 - The Case of the Voice Boomer.

Why did the opera singer Maria Trallas disappear? Why was captain Tietjerksteradeel's beer supply destroyed? Why was Dr. Maybe unable to make up his mind? Why did the aircraft carrier crew have to go into the lifeboats? Confused? Not when you have finished reading "The Case of the Voice Boomer" where the brave Agent 327 once again risk his life to defeat the mad scientist Dr. Maybe and his gang.
