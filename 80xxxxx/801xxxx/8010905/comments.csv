,bighill89,2013-01-15T19:06Z,"This torrent is good with some exceptions:

* Track 13 ""Pretty Flaco (Remix)"" needs to be renamed to ""Jodye"".
* Track 15 ""Ticket"" needs to be renamed to ""Angels"".
* Track 16 ""Like I'm Apart"" needs to be renamed to ""I Come Apart"".
* Torrent is missing Pretty Flaco (Remix)."
,DickPope,2013-01-16T18:48Z,Wrong track names and missing tracks are one of my biggest pet peeves in music torrents. I'll wait for a better torrent.
[V],Vitamin_X,2013-01-17T01:10Z,"My fault its mislabeled but theres a fix for it, just use an auto-tagger, mp3tag, winamp, foobar etc all are capable of auto-tagging, I personally recommend using Winamp for auto-tagging. 
But, it does not have any missing tracks, check here for more info:

I even included bonus videos,"

You should've add the Long Live A$ap video clip, anyway.

Kiss kiss bye bye tchao salut !"
,Soto928,2013-02-11T12:08Z,"Why people complain about improper tags while pirating music is beyond me. You're getting it for free, so get over it. Good quality torrent. Just be sure to change the song names according to @bighill89."
