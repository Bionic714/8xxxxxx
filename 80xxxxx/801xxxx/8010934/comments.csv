,potvinsuks,2013-01-12T16:56Z,"Hey guys, are we supposed to uninstall .54 before installing this or does this get installed over?  Thanks Mikii and Snakeye."
,alcluizPT,2013-01-12T19:07Z,Thanks Mikii0804!!!
,Mikii0804,2013-01-12T20:15Z,"You have to uninstall previous version (0.54) using windows standard uninstaller.
"
,potvinsuks,2013-01-12T20:28Z,"Yup just realized that as I attempted to install it into the same folder and it just didn't seem right, so I'm gonna uninstall via standard uninstaller as you said.  Thank you for the help Mikii."
,potvinsuks,2013-01-12T20:55Z,"The planes are still in the simobjects folder, is that normal or should I manually delete them and everything associated with the plane and re-install?  Thanks just wanna be safe."
,potvinsuks,2013-01-12T21:23Z,Everything seems to be good following your instructions thank you.  
,potvinsuks,2013-01-12T21:26Z,Anyone find current or any airac for this baby?
,potvinsuks,2013-01-12T21:52Z,"Hmmm..I wonder if this plane uses the PSS airac, cause I believe this is the same or newer company now."

Will seed when finished :)"
,jnedorost,2013-01-13T13:44Z,"Ah, no PFD, MFD, working :("
,Mikii0804,2013-01-13T15:15Z,"Hi!

@potvinsuks: yes the right airac database is ""PSS Airbus/Boeing/Dash - native"" just place it in the correct folder and replace the old folder.

@jnedorost and klaflo: maybe it's a problem with your config because it's the original installer. Try desinstall, restart, reinstall, RESTART (very important) and load the aircraft.

Let me know if it helped"
,larsper,2013-01-13T16:17Z,"mine says license error i cant control the planes and there is no mfd,pfd"
,larsper,2013-01-13T16:18Z,mine says license error and i cant do a thing with the plane
,klaflo,2013-01-13T16:20Z,"hi mikibi an@jnedorost,
problem is solved go to the homepage bbs,techn.support,follow the link and have a look to  Knowledge Base Latest Articles  its a just a small problem with the admin.rights
now all is working perfectly again thank you very much mikii and snakeye!well done"
,jnedorost,2013-01-13T17:47Z,"klaflo: Maybe I should try reinstall and restart (as written by Mikii), cause I'm running WinXP on admin account, so there's no need for this."
,klaflo,2013-01-13T21:13Z,"yes jnedorost you should do it i have win 7 64 bit,i think it would be the best way wish you success leave me a post
helmut"
,potvinsuks,2013-01-13T22:02Z,Okay awesome!  Thanks so much gents.
,KuSH-420,2013-01-14T01:05Z,"Tnx!

Req: CS 757 fully updated :)"
,cheetah_cheetah2,2013-01-14T05:54Z,"Thank you uploader for sharing.
Everything is fine, everything works.
However the product itself is... I don't want to say garbage, but bad.
Aerosoft's Airbus X Extended is 10 miles above this product.
Thanks uploader again for letting us try this product.
However it's not worth the cash."
,sami_osman,2013-01-14T16:29Z,Mine has no screens working and the stick is frozen and the controls don't work just work by using the buttons i can't use the mouse to switch the aircraft button HEEEEEEEELP :'(
,Mikii0804,2013-01-14T17:06Z,"@sami_osman

Again it must be a problem with your config. Try reinstalling and for further support go to the blackbox forums."
,sami_osman,2013-01-14T20:38Z,"@Mikii0804

Thanks I Will"
,jnedorost,2013-01-16T19:47Z,So I did it and it's not working :( But I'll try to download ver. 0.60.1 :)
,Fara005,2013-01-16T22:09Z,"Don't Download it, it's a VIRTUS....

Buy this really nice product tu help developper to improve it...
"
,Juauzynhu_FSX,2013-01-18T01:26Z,"Nice torrent, i downloaded and here all functions worked great. Remember to calibrate joystick in aircraft FMC (sry bad english)"
,rieper45,2013-01-19T14:11Z,Thank you very much! but gauges(panes) are black.
,dsaw859,2013-01-19T18:33Z,@rieper45 The issue with blank screens has already been addressed here on page one of comments. The solution is found on BBS website and has nothing to do with Torrent. It's a matter of setting your fsx.exe to run as administrator. Make sure to read all comments next time you have problem to see if a solution is posted already. Cheers. 
,jnedorost,2013-01-20T09:27Z,"dsaw859: That's nice, but what if I'm running WinXP, where there's no need to run it as admin? :("
,FSXAirbus,2013-01-20T15:45Z,Version 0.61 is out! Any possibility of uploading it?
,Mikii0804,2013-01-21T17:46Z,"@FSXAirbus: I'll try to upload the new version this we.

@Fara005: I don't think it's a ""VIRTUS"".
And by the way this is the original .exe from the bbs online shop so I don't think there's a virus inside..."
,sami_osman,2013-01-22T14:09Z,"@Mikii0804
I Searched On The Forums And Support But I Didn't Find The Issue Please Post A Link If There Is...
Thanks."
,sami_osman,2013-01-22T14:10Z,"@Mikii0804
I Guess I Need Win7 To Run It :D"
,realfsx,2013-01-23T05:31Z,"@sami_osman
Blackbox has a windows xp fix(i assume this is what you are using) included in version 0.61. If you are using vista run fsx in admin mode"
,klipais,2013-01-23T08:21Z,"Two fucking idiot's  - Mikii0804 and _SnakEye ! Why you post serial keys for BB on the P-bay  ? They both are now banned !!! You couldn't contact normal hakers , who make for us quality RIP  ? Now we all didn't have newest updates , but you little brains didn't understand that .Stupid , fucking seedleaders .

,Mikii0804,2013-02-06T19:22Z,"@klipais

You seem to have a lot of things to say, so maybe you could crack it 'cause your comments don't help us at all... I don't have the sufficient knowledge for cracking it so I just shared it! What did YOU do??"
,klipais,2013-02-11T11:21Z,"Mikii_smallbrain_2 . Some people in the ***racker make rip , but now it's too late . Because newest version i s lock . What i do ?

,Mikii0804,2013-04-22T23:10Z,"@klipais

I just bought the real product and shared it with my own CD key... A small thank you would have been better than all the shit you bring!"
,Mikii0804,2013-04-22T23:13Z,"BTW I have v0.70 installer but blacklisted CD-key by BBS, if someone is interested..."
,jnedorost,2013-04-25T19:07Z,"Okay, I've spent like months trying to get this working and I'm getting pretty crazy about it. Since I've got WinXP, I can not set any admin rights (I've got admin acc), so this solution is not for me. Anybody help? :("
,klipais,2013-05-09T12:00Z,"Your own CD-key ??)))) I know who upload CD key for 0.60 BB . Ok , this key and other we loose . Make torrent with 0.70 , maybe someone install this bierdie without I-net connection , and take out new upgrades for repack . "
,MrAlexCougar,2013-06-02T14:40Z,Hi Mikii0804! Thanks for this product! It's just awesome but it needs some upgrades... Can you please upload the v0.70 installer? I have some ideas of cracking it...
