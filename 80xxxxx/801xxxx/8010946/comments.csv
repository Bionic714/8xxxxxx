I need it to DVD-DL!!!!"
,LotOfBollocks,2013-01-12T15:27Z,"To be honest, it is a default setting in the ""ripping"" software I use. Should not be that difficult to have a decent experience with this torrent anyway. I will have it in mind for future torrents. Sorry!"

By the way thanks a lot for bringing the untouched discs, and I hope that you'll find the first season."
