The fictional Borealis (6 p.m. Friday, re-airing 3 p.m. Saturday on Canada’s Space network) is set in a frontier town in a defrosted arctic 30 years into the future, and was filmed during the fall of 2011 outside of Calgary.

The network opted not to go to a full series, choosing to air the first two episodes as a two-hour movie, but the producers say they’re pursuing other options to continue the show.
