,five_5tar,2013-01-13T08:34Z,"  Borealis takes place in the near future, 2045, in the not so near Arctic, in the International Arctic Free Zone. The central character is Vic Carboneau, played by Ty Olsson. Vic owns the tavern/hotel/brothel and is the Customs Officer. Meanwhile, a number of different international interests are vying for control of the area and the valuable mining and oil rights. Patrick Gallagher plays Taq, Vic’s best friend and right hand man. Terry Chen plays Roger, the town’s de facto coroner/doctor. Alison Freemont is an internationally known biologist/conservationist/blogger, played by Michelle Harrison. She’s trying to keep the indigenous wildlife from being driven to extinction. Greyston Holt plays Dan an American postdoctoral student who ends up helping both Vic and Alison. Cristina Rosato plays Bettina, one of the girls who works out of Vic’s place. Clive, played by Bryan Dick, is one of her customers and a recovering addict who also does some work for Vic. While Vic does his best to keep things running smoothly in Borealis, the “law” comes in the form of the Canadian military led by Raminder, played by Karan Oberoi. When things start to heat up in Borealis and an international shake up of control looms, the UN sends in Svetlana, played by Christine Horne, to keep things on an even keel."

,Leslie_Powow,2013-01-13T22:28Z,"From IMDB:

""As a stand alone movie, I can see how ""Borealis"" may be slightly disappointing. As the pilot for a new series though, it's awesome. Why? It leaves one wanting more. ""

It looks like a movie that starts a show.  Downloading... thanks for the upload. :)"
