THE FAN-FAVORITE PHENOMENON CONTINUES! After last month's shocking events, Hella struggles to keep her carefully constructed suburban world from crumbling around her. While Jeremy and Eli attempt to escape the jungles of Mongolia, with the Daughters of Bright Moon hot on their tail, the Jenkins marriage hits a snag as Tia wishes to rejoin the "work force," Zari and Sara's play-date is crashed by an uninvited visitor; and Gio makes an announcement that shocks the world, but none more so than Paul's. All that, AND a cliffhanger that will have everyone talking. Don't miss it!

Thanks goes to Son of Anarchy for this release.
