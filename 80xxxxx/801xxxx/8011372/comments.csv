Any idea ?"
[T],The_Duck1,2013-01-12T21:47Z,"Thanks for supporting my torrents

I test all my torrents also on a win7 64 bit and for me they all working when i release them.

Sometimes is difficult to see if i got everything removed from my pc when i test a torrent, if i test it and the register keys also exist on my pc the torrents will work on my pc but not on yours.
I hope the answer is good enough for you you.

This is also one of the new torrenst its not  portable anymore but 1-click run."
