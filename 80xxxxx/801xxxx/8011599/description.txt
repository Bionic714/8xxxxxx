Synchronicity: the experience of events that are apparently unrelated, yet are experienced as occurring together in a meaningful manner.

A staff of slaves runs on teamwork. Teamwork relies on knowing your team mates. Knowing is being. And these two slave will 'be' each other until they get it right. Now, slaves, go fuck yourselves.

The household gathers to help us get the slaves in synch. They fuck themselves in synch, they are bound together on synch, they fuck each other in synch. The crowd is inspired and soon sex, whips and bondage break out among the guests, filling the room with the smell of servitude.
