Do you have perhaps any of the Paul Temple radio-series?

They were produced all over Europe at the same time.
I think the Finnish ones are all on CD/cassette, but hard to get outside of Finland. 
Btw, any other 'kuunnelmia' would be very welcome too!
(I have the Sinuhe egyptiläinen radio-series and can upload if there is any interest.)"

I'll found the Paul Temple series you mentioned, all in CD format. I'll put them in to the queue and upload sometime in the future. 

I just uploaded two new radio plays (kuunnelma) from 2012. They are both based on Arto Paasilinna's books.

,alohahe,2013-01-18T21:02Z,"GREAT!!! Many Thanks for this and the two wonderful Paasilinna's - two of his best books!

Btw, do you have 'Ruusun nimi' by Eco? Yle did broadcast it as radio play in three parts two years ago. I only have part 2 and 3, because part 1 was blocked outside of Finland without any reasons. Would be great to have it complete sometime.

Anyway, Paljon kiitoksia for everything!"
[T],auris3051,2013-01-20T13:28Z,"Sorry, but I couldn't found that ""Ruusun nimi""-play. I think it hasn't been released in CD format. If it will be re-aired in radio sometimes in the future, I might get to download it from YLE Areena. Bu for now, I can't help you."
,alohahe,2013-01-20T14:25Z,"OK, never mind. Thanks for looking. The play hasn't been released yet. I downloaded it from Yle Areena two years ago, but I have only part two and three, because part one was blocked. I am sure it will re-appear some time anyway. It was a dramatisation of Eco's 'The name of the rose'. "
