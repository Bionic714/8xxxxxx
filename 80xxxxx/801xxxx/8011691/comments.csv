,dfree19,2013-01-13T13:47Z,this is episode 1
,dfree19,2013-01-13T13:48Z,its a new series from where you want to take it from the future?
,vatel88,2013-01-13T18:26Z,This entire series has already be uploaded. Not going to post a link because if you're to lazy to search for it you don't deserve it. But i will confirm it is out there. i have grabbed the entire first season from this site.
,vatel88,2013-01-13T18:31Z,Also this show was released in germany/ france/canada/ and the US all with different episode orders. So this is technically the 1st episode. Only listed as the 3rd under the german release which is already been said is severely out of order from the way its meant to be seen.

What I've found out is that the Canadian release seems to be the ""most correct"" order of episodes :) 

Go hard Go strong EZTV :D    Big fan of yours :D"
