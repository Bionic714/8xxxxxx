For what its worth..I only recently began to 're-utilize' the comments..I NEVER use the ""+/- quality"" feature..

The sad reality is that in the era of the ""web""..in terms Specifically of ""social interaction""..in the post ""sns's"" world..a simple bumper sticker could suffice:

""EVERYTHING IS WORSE, NOTHING IS BETTER!""

The '+/-' system Does Not Work for this simple reason..SO many people..in fact the OBVIOUS MAJORITY..are simply CONSUMED with pure..RAGE.

If we could determine the number of ""actual"" +/- quality ratings? I am willing to BET (for real..real bet) that the percentage of ""negatives"" that are based on the REALITY of the file? Are MAYBE..20%.

The rest? are Sheer Unadulterated..""Revenge and Resentment"".

Fact is..the reality of ""culture"" and ""society"" NOW is like ANY highway or BUSY intersection in the WORLD;

Severe..Extreme..RAGE!

I simply DISMISS the ""quality"" ratings and have literally..no mere figure of speech..LITERALLY..Never..been the ""wiser"" as a result of a ""rating"". I have my own list of Serious or what I call 'Artist' UL'rs..no patronizing..just a fact..Yourself..or your crew as the case may be..Vicerock..ILPruny..Thorntonwilde..a few others..I simply relegate myself to what you share..and DISMISS ratings and negative comments as a result.

The Mortal Fatal Flaw of Torrents continues; Lack of Hardcoded English Subs for non-english parts..like in ""Premium Rush"" for example..and some like 'YIFY' are so bad about this that their torrents are..for me..like ""Fast Food""..the ""McTorrent""..LOTS of ""choices"" but (Almost) Zero real ""attention to detail"".

So for me the solution is simply ""KNOWLEDGE"" regarding the BEST..and here's the rub..Most Attentive To Detail..UL'ers. Problem Solved. (For What Its Worth)"
[V],QborT,2013-01-12T19:39Z,English subs are poor quality (broken English).  Just throwing it out there for those that might be curious.
