A - Good

V - Good

M - The combination of comically awful acting and a somehow a story that lacks any sort of substance more then people constantly crying crocodile tears, in chorus, makes the almost 2 hours unbearable to watch.

MY COMMENT
 gayestmovieever at 2013-01-10 14:59 CET:
I have been downloading torrents from this site since the beginning of time and i just registered now for the first time ever for the only purpose to state that ""This is the Gayest movie in the history of all movies"" and i am not talking about the kind of gay between 2 men that suck each others dicks and ass fuck one another. Anyone that thinks anything different should punch themselves repeatedly numerous times in the face and than proceed to tie a belt or a rope around there neck and hang themselves until dead. You deserve a slow painful death, that is what you like if you like this movie, its basically the same thing you that it feels like, you must not have any kind emotion that you need to watch this shit predictable ugly boring sad ass shit movie to feel anything and addicted to feeling shitty and being a shit human being brainwashed chicken troll.. This should be in sci-fi section since there acting was so far from reality, i am sure delusional morons that think that there actions and emotions where not fake as fuck dick son and so far from any reality in the world as we know it.. now BE GONE.


Both comments have Same exact meaning. just different wording. happy happy time

,iamjoynal,2013-01-28T14:50Z,"A film that captures real life the way J.A. Bayona captures it in his newest film The Impossible is a rare occurrence in filmmaking. Not only does he pay respect to the countless victims that were lost in the devastating tragedy, he makes artistic choices and liberties only the most seasoned directors can take. Quality is not so good, there is HD at theimpossible.blackunix.net and it worked great for me. Enjoy this spectacular movie!"
