,phillydan,2013-02-08T05:41Z,Anybody have a more recent set of the catalogs?  Or have the prices not changed that much since 2009?
,Corwin88,2013-03-26T21:28Z,"I don't think the average prices has changed so much over the past 4 years. Of course it depends within some of the countries. 
And of course specialty items, but for them you should instead get yourself special catalogs regarding the items you are looking for. "
