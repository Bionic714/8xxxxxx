Featuring Spoon's Britt Daniel and Wolf Parade's Dan Boeckner, this is the rare super-group that is more than the sum of its promising parts. Daniel's jaggedly tuneful pop merges with Boeckner's rock classicism for a nervy chemical reaction on songs like the scuzzed-up synth-pop "My Love Is Real" and the neo-garage rock stomp "Would That Not Be Nice." But the secret weapon might be drummer Sam Brown, formerly of Ohio punks New Bomb Turks, who bashes and swings with wrecking-ball force. Let's hope this isn't a one-time thing.
