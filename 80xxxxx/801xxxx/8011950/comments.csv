[T],micron66,2013-01-12T17:56Z,"@NoSoup4U

most welcome!

as a bonus i added 3 high resolution Color Maps because the maps on the ebook are not that big so you can't really check all the locations.

Enjoy and Happy Reading everyone!"
,NoSoup4U,2013-01-12T18:15Z,"I just skimmed through the book. It looks excellent.  

Wanted to point out (not complaining mind you) that the Epilogue TOC hyperlink does not work. Wanted to let you know. "
,NoSoup4U,2013-01-12T18:17Z,"Edited to add: The Maps TOC hyperlink doesn't work either. Again, not complaining. Just wanted to let you know, in case you have the ability to fix things. "
,NoSoup4U,2013-01-12T18:19Z,"Love the fact that you included color maps. :-) They looks great!  What a great day it is, in ebook land. "
[T],micron66,2013-01-12T18:44Z,"@NoSoup4U

the whole TOC works just fine for me.

what format (epub/mobi) are you checking ? what app/device are you checking it on ?"
,NoSoup4U,2013-01-12T19:29Z,"Micron,
I loaded the Mobi on my Kindle Fire.  I just deleted it from the Kindle and reloaded. There must have been a glitch earlier, as all is working well now. 

For some reason, I didn't have that problem with the one I had uploaded here. 

For those wondering, there is no problem with the book. If part of the TOC doesn't appear to work right, reload it in Calibre. That should solve the problem. 

First time I had that happen to me.  

Thank you for the reply. It prompted me to reload.

Sorry to all for any confusion etc. "
,BiggC,2013-01-12T21:27Z,Thanks a lot!
,bob9001a,2013-01-12T22:09Z,Finally a decent version. Muchos gracias.
,Marikhen,2013-01-13T03:16Z,"For those like me who convert eBooks to .txt format this is a very good copy to use.  There are enough line breaks between individual scenes/segments of the story in chapters to know when you're switching between them, the Table of Contents from other versions isn't corrupting a text file partway through, and I've yet to notice a significant number of paragraphs broken up by random cr/lfs and/or hyphens from where words were broken up to fit line space in the hardcopy.

@micron66:  Already admitted my comment in the other torrent's comment section was based on Calibre screwing up and not properly updating the files.   Just try not to get your knickers in a knot over someone having legitimate reasons to use .txt format when you read this comment.  ;-)"
,Marikhen,2013-01-13T03:25Z,"On a secondary note, please review this section from your file(s):
Tuon turned from Selucia to see Rand. “Damane! Tuon said, cutting Mat off. “Bring my damane Run, Musicar! RUN!”

Please note the  instead of a !.  There are 10 instances of  being used instead of a ! in the file."
,Marikhen,2013-01-13T03:41Z,"Lovely.  The site ignores forward slashes.  Well, | without shift pressed then.  /shrugs.  Also noticed at least one instance where an apostraphe wasn't properly inserted into ""He's"" in that section of the story.  There might be others."
[T],micron66,2013-01-13T04:26Z,"@Marikhen

You can read EPUB files on your PSP by using PSPKVM + this application - 'Albite Reader NoTouch 2.1'

http://sourceforge.net/projects/pspkvm/
https://github.com/dumbledore/AlbiteREADER/downloads

Here's another way to read epub files on the PSP -

If you have a file browser, you can do these steps directly on your PSP. Rename the .epub extension to .zip. Unzip the file, and you'll find some html files. Those are the actual text. You can open html files with the PSP's web browser to read it."
,muppet_77,2013-01-13T14:13Z,"This is an excellent copy and I'd never complain about free work, but I think it's premature to call this v4.0, no offense. There are many OCR errors throughout, still, just like the 3++ version. Many section breaks are missing, there are areas where the chapter title appears multiple times in the middle of the body of the text, and not to nitpick, but the end of chapter icon is missing from about half the chapters.

It's a very good copy, though. Maybe I'm just spoiled by the incredibly excellent Towers of Midnight EPUB from a few years back on TPB."
[T],micron66,2013-01-13T20:54Z,"@muppet_77

the scanner/proofer has named this a v4.0,there are very few ebooks that don't have any errors in them,over the years i have seen worst retail (v5.0) ebooks as compared to scanned.proofed one's.

The few errors that may remain in this copy are too minor and most people don't even notice such things."
,muppet_77,2013-01-13T21:56Z,"Like I said, I won't complain about free work, but to call this ""fully corrected and proofed"" is kind of silly when the punctuation is missing from almost half the dialog and there are multiple OCR errors on every page.

My only basis for comparison is the Towers of Midnight EPUB I got here last time when Harriet and friends decided to delay the ebook release.  It took until maybe 2 weeks after release, but it was completely perfect. This one isn't really close to that.

Still very readable, but I don't see how anybody can call it ""fully corrected"", that's all."
,bob9001a,2013-01-13T22:24Z,"It is better, but I am still finding a lot of fucking mistakes. Fix them. Now."
[T],micron66,2013-01-13T22:39Z,"@muppet_77

since u are such an expert in ebook proofing,why don't u improve this and share with us instead of being an armchair critic."
[T],micron66,2013-01-13T22:41Z,"@bob9001a

I can only assume that you are being funny..lol"
,muppet_77,2013-01-13T23:42Z,"Not an expert, and that's a silly response. Your response would make sense if I was saying this release isn't good. That's not what I'm saying.

I'm saying it's not as described. There's a big difference.

Anyway, there's no point in belaboring it. "
,bob9001a,2013-01-14T01:17Z,200 pages in and the frequency of errors is increasing. This is NOT v.4.0 quality. It still beats waiting 4 months which cannnot be said for the previous versions.
[T],micron66,2013-01-14T08:18Z,"@bob9001a

can you be more specific ,what sort of errors ? i'm sure they are minor.

As to the matter of  v4.0,there are no fixed rules for assigning versions in case of ebooks ,it's not as if there some ebook ""scene"" like movies/tv shows who follow a certain set of rules.

One person's v4 maybe another's v3 or even less.The basic idea of assigning versions is to let us know the best available copy."
,Pheav,2013-01-14T22:08Z,"@micron66 thanks for the upload. 

When can we expect your next ""new releases"" pack? I'm a big fan of these :-)"
,TheDragonReborn26,2013-01-14T22:13Z,"Micron, don't be childish. 
You should relabel this or change the description to say that there are still errors. You were doing fine until your ""Well if you're such an expert"" comment. You really aren't doing yourself any favors acting that way."
,bob9001a,2013-01-15T01:53Z,"they are mostly minor, but also quite frequent

Fie instead of He
were instead of we're
Knack showing up in bold during the middle of sentences for no apparent reason
and hundreds of similar errors that keep jumping off the electronic page"
,bob9001a,2013-01-15T01:59Z,"they are mostly minor, but also quite frequent

Fie instead of He.
were instead of we're.
Knack showing up in bold during the middle of sentences for no apparent reason.
Missing quotation marks all over the place when characters start to speak. This is probably the most common and annoying error.

There are hundreds of other similar errors that keep jumping off the electronic page.

So when is v4.0a coming out?"
,GSArora,2013-01-15T07:06Z,"Seriously? I've seen you clowns negatively comment on the other torrent as well. The official e-book isn't coming out for a while now, so be happy that people like micron are uploading it so you don't have to pay the 39.99 until it is out. Thanks though, for the torrent. Reread the whole series last week in anticipation for this."
,KidenStormsoarer,2013-01-15T10:28Z,"personally, i'd call it a 3.0.  still a ton better than the other version though, thank you for taking the time to do it.  also, ignore boba, he's been trolling all of the AMOL torrents with insults."
,trontium,2013-01-15T23:04Z,"Registered just to comment!

Many thanks to micron, have just loaded through Calibre to Kindle, looks perfect. 
Muchos gracias!
I would have to wait forever for this officially, in Ireland we always get things last :("
,milleva,2013-01-16T06:11Z,no longer works on my kobo just closes book and marks as finished when i go change page. 
[T],micron66,2013-01-16T22:40Z,"@Pheav

hopefully,the next ""new releases"" pack will be up in a few days."
,Giobemo,2013-01-17T01:49Z,Thanks a lot!!! Been waiting literally years for this one!
,melkume,2013-01-28T19:00Z,"I read the first 30 pages of the epub on my old nook and it is is very readable. Any errors are minor enough that they aren't distracting. Thanks for this upload! And to all the nit pickers, why don't you convert it to txt, open it in a word processor and go through all 900 or so pages of material and correct the errors. lol. You'll find that it is quite hard to find them all without giving up a lot of your time and a bit of your sanity. Just thank the uploader for this far better than average release."
[T],micron66,2013-02-06T22:43Z,"@Malice181

If and when you do finish the proofread,would really appreciate if you can upload it."
[T],micron66,2013-02-08T09:24Z,"@Malice181

excellent! no need to hurry,take your time."
,Malice181,2013-02-12T03:53Z,"Alright. There was a misunderstanding with my account earlier. Here is the proofread version for those looking for it. v4.0+:

,hotred8,2013-02-25T20:47Z,"QUESTION!!! I grabbed a few of yours but I was hoping you could tell me which of the books was similar to the Necro Files one? I LOVE the Hot Blood series, have read them all, and want something similar. THANK YOU!!! Also, I adore TWOT series and recently went to the Brandon Sanderson book signing for the final one. It rocked. "
,AmTrix,2013-02-28T07:08Z,"So far, so good. Haven't started reading it yet, but it opens up just fine on my Nook Color. Thanks, micron! I will buy the eBook when it finally comes out!"
