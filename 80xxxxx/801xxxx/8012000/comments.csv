,slims20,2013-01-31T23:15Z,"This worked for me (had to generate two keys before it worked) and it's clean (assuming a scan with Microsoft Security Essentials is sufficient).

Thanks for the torrent."
,xxpetexx,2013-02-21T02:01Z,"This 'keygen' is 100% dodgy. If you try and run it in a vm as advised it fails to run.

The error is 'Promo Engine Setup failed to load configuration from server'.

Definitely malware. Avoid it."
,xxpetexx,2013-02-21T02:11Z,"I take it back, the suspicious exe was from clicking anonymous download. The one I got from the 'get this torrent' link worked fine."
