Keygen for JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA 12 Ultimate.

Verified on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux:

*** VERY IMPORTANT: ***
Do not trust that this keygen is clean! I didn't create this and I really don't care whether it'll infect your system with anything. Unlike cracked application executables, you only have to run a keygen a limited number of times to get what you need from it. You also *don't* have to run it on an operating system installation that you care about.

Each time I've run any keygen, I did the following:

1. Start with a clean Windows virtual machine.
2. Ensure that you have a snapshot of its current state (before running the keygen).
3. Copy the keygen into the VM.
4. Disconnect the VM's network adapter.
5. Run the keygen and note the serial number that it produces.
6. Revert the virtual machine to the clean snapshot.

Now you have a working serial number, and you haven't run anything untrustworthy on any machine that you care about.

If this sounds like too much trouble, pay JetBrains $200 or take the risk of compromising a real OS installation. Please don't complain here if you ignore these warnings and expect nothing bad to happen.

Again:
USE THIS IN A VIRTUAL MACHINE WITH NO NETWORK ADAPTER, OR USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK.
