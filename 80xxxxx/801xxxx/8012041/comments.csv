,HateMyJewHair,2013-01-30T09:32Z,I read that 68 was supposed to be double size. Sure it's complete? 
[V],STFmaryville,2013-02-01T20:32Z,"HateMyJewHair, yes it's complete. Last summer, Larsen did say that #68 would be 80 pages. But it came out with 32 pages -- interestingly, it was solicited as a 32-pager. Larsen drew the last issue himself, so perhaps he changed his mind again once he started the work. But my guess is, he realized that a higher page count (with higher price) could make the orders returnable."

It was close to a quarter of a million dollars! This -- and a whole lot more -- is all printed in The Comics Journal #195 if anyone wants to read about it."
