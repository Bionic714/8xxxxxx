This has been stuck at 88% for two days:

and this one is stuck at 87%:

No seeders, including yourself, apparently."
,piyalsilva,2013-01-13T04:24Z,LemonJ-Lo I seed every torrent 400% and then delete them after seeding it cos i have to free my hard disk space to for new files. The fact is that most of the downloaders escape after downloading without seeding.  If the first downloaders escape without seeding it ll die soon. I think u can understand.
