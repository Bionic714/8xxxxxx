Although Nashville is primarily known as the center of country music, the city also has had a flourishing music scene in other genres, including R&B, and a big chunk of NashvilleΓÇÖs R&B history is due to Ted Jarrett, who founded Champion Records (and its sister labels Calvert, Kit, and Cherokee Records) in 1956, releasing several fine R&B singles, most of which were no more than regional hits, before the label officially folded three years later in 1959. This three-disc, 60-track set collects some of those gems, including sides by Earl Gaines, Gene Allison, the Fairfield Four, Baker Knight, and many others, making for a fun and varied playlist - and for a history lesson as well.
