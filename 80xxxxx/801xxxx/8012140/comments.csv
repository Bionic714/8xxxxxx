,LambentZerker,2013-02-04T19:46Z,"If I may, why does this not work on my PSX launcher? I've only just started using the torrent and stuff to play these games, but when I try this one it loads up to the Title Screen, but does not have any music playing or a 'Start' option. I can hear the sign vibrate in the beginning, etc, but nothing more than that. Any suggestions?"
,Swaffles,2013-02-23T18:32Z,"LambentZerker, that sounds like a problem your plugins. I did nothing special to this disk image, I converted it straight from my physical disk."
