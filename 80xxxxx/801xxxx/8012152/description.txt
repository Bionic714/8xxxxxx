Beth released her long awaited follow up album to Comfort Of Strangers and her Anti- Records debut, on October 1st in the UK and October 2nd in North America. Recorded in Portland, Oregon, with producer Tucker Martine (My Morning Jacket, The Decemberists), the album bears the fruits of a period of introspection & renewal: deeply lyrical songwriting, a newfound expressivity of voice, and, more than ever before, a daring synthesis of her broad musical influences into a powerfully individual artistic vision. 

I stretched myself as a singer on this record and used voices I never have before as a writer, she explains. A lot of the writing on this record happened in the dead of night, when spiders mend their webs, with an infant asleep in the next roomΓÇª as a result, my writing became a secret again: illicit and my own.
