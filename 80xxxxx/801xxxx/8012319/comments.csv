Thanks dude! Is it v1.2? Torrent does not say if its the newest release. If not how would I go about updating? I have v1.0 now. "

if you install from the given torrent then you can update it without any problem...bcoz its a dvd installer and you dont need any crack for it.......just put the key in the installer and validate and u r good to go..... hope it helps"
