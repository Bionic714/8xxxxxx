The material on Jack o' Diamonds was recorded in 1949 but never released at the time due to John Lee Hooker's vast contractual problems.

These 20 cuts were recorded at a private gathering in the Detroit dining room of Gene Deitchat, who set up a primitive recording device and let Hooker play.

Since these recordings have been cleaned and remastered, this disc is well worth picking up for Hooker fanatics.


ENJOY.
