When programmer Kevin Flynn became the owner of the large corporation Encom, he created a virtual world known as the Grid. Flynn also created a digital alter ego named Clu to keep the system under control. But when self-generated programs begin appearing and demanding their independence, things quickly become very complicated! In addition to creating this new digital world, Flynn has also fathered a child named Sam. Can Flynn balance the demands of his virtual life with those in the real world?
