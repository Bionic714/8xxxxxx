Jacob Clarke dies at a relatively young age. His wife eventually re-marries but his daughter Lisa, five years after his death, is abducted by aliens. Eric Crawford is out of a job and back to civilian life after the aliens recover all of the artifacts from the Roswell crash. As the years go by the various characters go about their lives but in 1991, Crawford is called back to service when the payload aboard a spacecraft vanishes. Jesse Keys' son Charlie is a successful schoolteacher but has decided that he will resist any further attempts at abducting him. Lisa meets Charlie when they are both abducted; she finds out soon after that she is pregnant. Crawford tells his now adult daughter Mary about the work he has been doing and invites her to join him.
