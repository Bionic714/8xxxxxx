A Hole In The Head is an hour long documentary about trepanation -the process of boring a hole in the skull.
A Hole In The Head examines the development of ìmodernî trepanation as used by people in the United Kingdom,
The United States, and The Netherlands for the purpose of attaining a higher level of consciousness.
This procedure, used by the ancient Egyptians, Incas, and others, is believed by the voluntarily trepanned
to allow for renewed brain pulsations that increase brain blood volume and thereby improve brain function.
Interviews regarding the history and efficacy of the procedure are also held with some of
the worldís most respected neurosurgeons and anthropologists.
