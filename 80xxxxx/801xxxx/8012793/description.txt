applet! It has very powerful features to uninstall and remove programs.

Remove programs easily

With its advanced and fast algorithms, Revo Uninstaller Pro analyzes an application's data before uninstall
and scans for remnants after the uninstall of a program. After the program's regular uninstaller runs, you can
remove additional unnecessary files, folders and registry keys that are usually left over on your computer.
Revo Uninstaller Pro offers you some simple, easy to use, but effective and powerful methods for
uninstalling software like tracing the program during its installation.

Revo Uninstaller Pro has a very powerful feature called Forced Uninstall. Forced Uninstall is the best
solution when you have to remove stubborn programs, partially installed programs, partially uninstalled
programs, and programs not listed as installed at all!

To remove a program completely, and without leaving a trace, you can monitor all system changes made
during its installation, and then use that information to uninstall it with one click only ΓÇô simple and easy!
