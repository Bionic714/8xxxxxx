Release Notes:
So what's different about this one, eh? Well, the main difference is I sped up the framerate to 34.746 fps to fix the poor framerate of the source. This took a lot of work. This results in the video going a little quicker, chopping off 25 minutes from the usual length of 2hr 49min to 2hr 26min. Don't worry. The whole movie is still there, and you likely won't notice anything besides the much smoother framerate. It took a horrible lot of work, 'cuz this made me have to change the audio to match the faster framerate. I was able to get the right settings in Adobe Audition CS6 to fit perfectly. While in there, since the audio was rather too soft, I enhanced it and the result is very good. Subtitles were a pain in the butt, because everyone elses subtitles were for a different framerate, so I had to resync that. It still isn't entirely perfect (mostly because the source subtitles weren't perfect), but it is extremely close. The mp4 is optimized to work perfectly in Quicktime, albeit I recommend VLC player with which it works perfectly and then some! Also I have tagged the movie cover art as an added bonus.
