[V],MP4SUX,2013-01-13T01:32Z,"So, I have to confess that I'm a bit confused as to your point. You seem to be marveling at how fast you were able to download this show - but if that's what you're trying to say - you're taking that current ""5 seeds / 6 leechers"" a bit literal.

In point of fact, there is still only one seeder (me) and it will be that way for about the next half hour until the magic 'spillover' moment when many get very happy all at once. All my upload bandwidth is dedicated to it, but it aint soup yet. I show about 200 peers (don't like the term 'leech') getting their own little bits and sharing with the others.

Of course, if you had a UseNet account, you could have had it the same time as I did.

Now, about ports. BitTorrenT seems quite hung up on 'port forwarding' and some torrent sites will get downright irate if you don't do it so that green check mark appears on the status bar (in my ancient version of uTorrent). Frankly, I've never seen much difference. As it happens, my VPN doesn't offer port forwarding on its US servers, but as it happens I'm pretending to be Canadian at the moment and port forwarding works just fine here. I check the ""port forwarding"" box in setup - hover over the icon in the system tray and it gives me a number - which I dutifully enter into the proper place in uTorrent.

Lacking a VPN and having, say a router with firewall makes the process quite difficult to figure out. But you pretty much get to pick your own number. This is because some ISPs will throttle certain ports if they get wind of a standard - so there isn't one. So, pick a number between the tens of thousands and fifty of them and enter it into the porper place in uTorrent (that part is easy). But then you need ot find where to enter the same number into your router. I have a D-Link router and I enter it's setup and click on ""advanced"" across the top and then I click on ""virtual server"" along the left side and in the middle is a table where I can make the appropriate entry.

My VPN bypasses all that - my router never sees the data unencrypted so it can't participate in the process.

And now eveone has but fourteen minutes left before they can see Alan do something truly deisgusting.

Good luck, let me know if I can be of further service,

Don't worry, by now everyone knows I like to ramble - so no harm done.

Enjoy the show.

although I always get good speeds from you
I was mostly impressed with how quickly you had the Xl version when it was only lest 24 hrs you had 
the regular one (no problem speeds ever)
and yes Alan is pretty disgusting"

Wouldn't it be cool if all that enourmous power was within my own little grasp?

Truthiness would belie the fact that the BBC generally broadcasts the regular version at 22:00 GMT(or is it that other one about an hour different?) on Friday (2pm for me at the antipode of Madagascar) and johncymru (BTW - have absolutely no idea who that is or even if they are the capper / encoder or just another distro in the chain like me) dutifully uploads it to UseNet, where I snag it and spread it far and wide throughout the BitTorrenT community.

And then the BBC broadcasts the XL version a day later at 22:00 on Saturday.

I can claim a lot of credit for a lot of things (very proud of my XIII project - still going strong), but when it comes to QI, Red Dwarf & Doctor Who ...

I'm just a rank opportunist at best (but with a heart of gold is the term, I think).

As I may have mentioned a time or twelve - for eleven bucks a month, you could have these shows just as soon as I do. But I guess the rationale is that I'm having fun being very convenient for all my loyal viewers.

Now, the 272p stuff - that's ALL me. I like a lot of little eps for a whole season at once in just a GB or two. Just posted Burn Notice today (and VERY happy that it took just long enough to not delay QI XL).Already working on the next one.

Enjoy it while it lasts - as the dearly departed Harry Nilsson Sang:

... now the other day another friend of mine said,
he said the sun's going yellow
and pretty soon we'll all be dead.
I said, my friend what do you mean,
you must be living in a museum
and things are never as they seeum.

So, I generally stay away from directly snubbing the MPAA & RIAA,
But I checked and the only copy here of ""Duit on Mon Dei"" is a Japanese
FLAC which seems to be the whole album in a single file.
I guess the rare exception is fine - I did do the TV movie ""MockingBird Lane"".

Wanted to include the lyrics, but every copy out there is horrible and identical.
I'd pretty much have to do it from scratch and I'm not up for that just now.
Seems there's damn littly pride anymore in getting anything right.
Just us Pirates baying at the moon ...

your comments are always a welcome site for soar eyes....However you are so clearly Skull and shoulders above anything my stew of grey matter can cope with in any articular fashion. I have I friend who talks of (news groups-user nets) an I struggle with his meaning also (not that it's ever unappreciated)....
Some wise man once said...
It's better to keep ones mouth closed and appear a fool than to open it and remove all doubt (thats what I have to work with unforunatley sometimes) I do however thank you for your kindness and sharing (although I am very sadly aware that nothing last forever!)
I used to consider myself an audiophile of sorts 
however i'm not up on my nilsson..(amazing voice and a true lost).just awrare of his more main stream stuff 
In this case maybe this one would be most appropriate (from midnight cowboy (I think)
Everybodies talking at me 
I don't hear a word they say 
only the shadows of mind

Hey Pal just got a lesson in usenet from my PC guru
(sabnzbd) just using small net for now but when my cionage situation improves soon I hope will invest in a proper deal!!!!( my general pace is baby steps)"

Sometimes I regret that it's not easier to keep track of conversations like this. Communication is always good - and with an audience, who knows what one will drop in passing that ends up having unsuspected meaning to others.

Anyway, here's my three step recipe for becoming an expert:

1) as at least three (3) really dumb questions.
2) use the knowledge you gain to undertand the bedrock of the subject at hand.
3) smile shy when people call you an expert.

If not taken too seriously, platitudes can be both useful and entertaining.

Most of life is just showing up.
The hard part about *any* task is sticking with it until it's complete.

Believe it or not, becoming known for my compact XVID / AVI offerings was never on my todo list. All I wanted was to get through to LOL / DIMENSION about the terrible thing they are doing in the name of quality. I posted my opinion on UseNet (post a file and you can attach ANTHING you want to rant about to it) and they are still there. Just NZB search MP4SUX and / or AVIGUY and look at the early NFOs (NZBclub will let you look at them without knowing a thing about UseNet).

But getting word to ""The Scene"" is as impossible as ... what was the line in that songe so long ago? Oh, yea ...

YOU CANNOT PETITION THE LORD WITH PRAYER!

So, while I was hanging around, I decided to put some skin in the game as it were. This gave me a platform for weighing in on the terrible wrong that to this day has not been eighted. Turns out there was SOOOO much for me to complain about and point to - management here one day likened my efforts as bordering on SPAM. That I didn't see coming, but it taught me a valuable lesson:

Being pissed at the government does NOT give one licence to punch the mailman in the nose. I was rightly chastised for criticising those who post here. Couldn't get to LOL or DIMENSION, so I'd leave error reports for every pixelation glitch I found. I still think my efforts noble (it was not for me, but the greater good in pushing for quality that a damaged file could never lay claim to).

see the discussion in the comments section of this file of mine for:
""The.Daily.Show.2012.12.11.Laura.Linney.PROPER.XVID-AVIGUY.avi""
Nothing like getting one's comeuppance to focus the mind. Decided quite clearly that if the multitudinous comments on the damage within a given file were so numerous as to risk being seen as a spammer ... well, a brick to the noggin' is always a wake-up call. I ceded the point and in the harsh light of reality decided that my rampage through the comments section of others was well past any useful end.

And then it shocked the hell out of me to refresh my page as my pink ""trusted"" skull was replaced by a green ""VIP"" skull.

So, now my rule is to never confront a fellow uploader - they didn't do anything wrong.

It's like Woody Allen in ""Small Time Crooks"", better expressed by the phrase ""life is what happens while you were making other plans.

I short, if there are those among ""The Scene"" that haven't heard of me by now, then they'd likely never be gotten though to. So, the veiled ""you should probably think deeply about what you're doing before we (management) are forced to step in.

Immediately seeing the light has its benefits - my green skull is proof of that. And the one comments section that I have tacit permission (unless another ominous comment arises) armed with which to rant about the horror of pixelations by the truck load - here in my own little home camp that is the comments section for every file I've ever posted, assures me that anyone looking for my LOL / DIM reports can find them just that easy. Just click on the link up there at the top of this comment and you'll be taken to see how prolific I've been.many files I've actually posted as MP4SUX. and there were near half a thousand I'd posted anonymously before realizing that this only protected me from those who could never, would never harm me in person.

And I've decided to be encouraging with a bit of reverse hypocracy - I freencourage any and all who see defect in my craftmanship to speak up loudl"
