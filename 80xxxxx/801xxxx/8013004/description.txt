For XVID AVI with MP3 audio, I support the contention that:
V=9
A=9
.
Just to reiterate - Wiki says it's S10E17, BBC says it's S10E15 (BBC wins)
Go visit bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006ml0g and see "Jolly" called 15/19
Why they called it 15 and broadcast it after 16, 17 is their business.
.
This one's special - actual "out of the Scene bubble" native XVID AVI
Brit show encoded by Brits and gratefully passed onto you by myself unchanged
Well, tweaked the filename a bit - gotta keep track.
