,TheDarkVirus,2013-01-13T01:14Z,"that's for its only me that's seeding and its many that dont buy it, they just download it from here."
,TheDarkVirus,2013-01-13T01:15Z,"i did buyd it and activated it and it works great.
and i recommend xmas edition."
,Hades714,2013-01-13T01:26Z,"There aren't many downloads.There will be but not too many...mainly 'cuz they stole money from people (wanted over 1000$ donations for their ""secret project"") and even if they sayed it will be free,it didn't get on Steam Greenlight and now they still want more...and I didn't mention about the fact they stole some of ideas from the forum of the original Slender."
,SlenderPi,2013-01-13T01:40Z,Hades... First: Fix your spelling and grammar and second... are you really gonna talk about stealing on a piracy website... -.-
,SuperBasedMan,2013-01-13T01:41Z,"um there is a problem. Christmas special and carnival dont work. They will start up but after you travel for about 10-20 seconds, they crash. please fix this"
,SuperBasedMan,2013-01-13T01:44Z,"as a matter of fact, i just tried prison and it crashed too. before i try the rest, please fix the crash. as i want to record a video but i cant.."
,TheDarkVirus,2013-01-13T02:21Z,did your pc meeted the requirement?
,Killer_mobsters,2013-01-13T02:48Z,"Doesn't work for me :/ When I run the program and choose a map, the game crashes after the game starts."
,Hades714,2013-01-13T02:55Z,"SlenderPi,I usually don't speak English and I have grammar errors so none is perfect and you got a point about me talking about piracy and stuff....but to me,it's kinda weird that Slenderman's Shadow got way more attention than the original one 'cuz it uses the same system.....maybe it's the maps that made the SMS popular.     °0°"
,IWG_Trollops,2013-01-13T03:01Z,"Anybody Having a problem with the gameplay, and says that it crashes after 20 or so feet, i fixed it easily by copy and pasting the serial key, deleting the license.dat and starting the game and pasting the key in but DON'T start it. Now what i did at this point was i changed the last digit of the serial and it worked. comment telling me if this worked."
,TheDarkVirus,2013-01-13T03:07Z,"i have problems to see the comments,
if the game crash try this:

delete: mylicense and copy the Key if needed.txt key. and start the game and paste it and see if it works (NEED TO RUN AS ADMIN)"
,Hades714,2013-01-13T03:21Z,"Thanks IWG_Trollops,it's working now."
,TheDarkVirus,2013-01-13T03:32Z,"i have fixed it!!!

just turn of the NETWORK and it should work great"
,IWG_Trollops,2013-01-13T03:46Z,"your welcome everybody, glad to be of help. The games great and i hate to download this without paying but i dont feel 6.99 is worth it for only 2 new maps."
,Hades714,2013-01-13T04:16Z,"LOL,I finished all the maps.The best two are Sanatorium and 7thStreet....and the easiest ones."
,Hades714,2013-01-13T04:27Z,Marc Steene (SMS creator) mentioned that Carneval will be multiplayer...
,SuperBasedMan,2013-01-13T04:43Z,"If having the crash problem, do what @IWG_Trollops said. it works! thank you! and Virus, i suggest you pasting his fix in the description for future ppl and give credit of the fix to trollops. great up"
,IWG_Trollops,2013-01-13T05:30Z,"@SuperBasedMan thank you dude, i appreciate having sumone that tries to help give credit to me for this fix. I honestly don't know why you have to change the serial. it might be a serial that can only be tied to one person. IDK but thanks and @TheDarkVirus Please give me the credit for this fix. Thanks Dude"
,TheDarkVirus,2013-01-13T13:02Z,"if i had the chance to change i had done that, (for helping) but it aint esay now :P"
,strongiam,2013-01-13T19:38Z,"so i know some of you are having a hard time getting it working because the game crashes 10 seconds in game. solution:
1-delete ""mylicense.dat""
2-copy license from ""Key if needed.txt"" on the main folder
3-run game as admin
4-input the key, but on the last number, instead of 9, put 8.
5-shit your pants with fear.
hope i helped ^^"
,IWG_Trollops,2013-01-14T00:52Z,"Fuck You @Strongiam I did the helping if anybody else thinks they came up with the fix then SCREW YOU. Im not as mad as this message sounds like, i just believe if anybody should be getting credit for the fix then ITS ME. OK"
,TheDarkVirus,2013-01-14T01:40Z,You got that point IWG_Trollops =D
,zlivuk,2013-01-14T09:22Z,"IWG_Trollops, don't cry... :("
,Hitman86,2013-01-16T18:11Z,@TheDarkVirus Is it possible for you to upload the Linux version as well? I know the community would be grateful. 
,Sonicfan244,2013-01-17T13:40Z,Works! All i had to do is input the key with the last digit from 9 to 8 and it works! Thank you! 
,TheDarkVirus,2013-01-17T18:07Z,Please Support the Creater of the game...
,IWG_Trollops,2013-01-17T18:44Z,"Guys head over to my new torrent, it is the updated slenderman shadows v1.1 that came out on the 15th with new features they added. http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8029414/Slenderman_Shadows_Rebuilt_V1.1_Updated_Latest"
,92298,2013-01-19T03:58Z,"As IWG_Trollops said, you must delete the mylisence.dat file and start the game. It will then ask for a serial number. Copy and paste the serial from 'key if needed.txt' but DO NOT start. Change the last digit in the serial and THEN start. I am reposting this from IWG_Trollops. IWG_Trollops did all of this, not me. Thank you IWG_Trollops for finding the fix."
,Akume,2013-01-20T20:46Z,"Alright, here we go. There are several ways to make the game work, so I'll go ahead and try to put everything said before into a single comment, making it easy for future players to run the game properly.

1) Open the folder where the game is located - There you'll find the ""Slender"" subfolder and a ""Key if needed"" .txt file. Copy the content from this file, because you're going to use it later.

2) Inside the ""Slender"" subfolder, delete the ""mylicense"" file. It's a .dat file, and it'll prevent you from running the game for the first time if it's there.

3) Run the game as administrator. Right click the  ""Slenderman's Shadow"" .exe file and select ""Run as Administrator"". Select any settings for running the game, and open it. 

4) It should ask for a key. Paste in the key you copied earlier into the text field, and change the last digit to any number. For example, you can just the change the ""9"" digit to an ""8"" one, and it'll work.

5) Enjoy. Also, don't forget to seed. Allow our pirate comrades to have the same amazing experience you did by seeding the torrent. It won't hurt.

Yarr."
