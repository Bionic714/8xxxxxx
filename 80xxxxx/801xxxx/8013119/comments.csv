,vili4kata,2013-01-20T15:30Z,I have a question and a problem - do I have to regenerate after I paste the db file and the problem is that most of the team names now have strange names (like teamname_215415...). I have the fifa-universe patch + the update 1 for it.
,tokke001,2013-01-20T16:14Z,"@vili4kata: did you install the 2012-13 patch first? http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7878140/2012-13_patch_for_FIFA_11_(from_FIFA_13)
you should not regenerate then. unless you still got errors, or if you want to use other edits"
,vili4kata,2013-01-20T17:03Z,"I installed this patch and the squad update and now I don't have such problems, but I noticed that the squads need to be fixed for the next version and also some of the kits for example Man City's away kit and the 3rd one. Also I think that Martin Petrov from Bolton need to be transferred to Espanyol, but I suppose EA will fix this. :) "
,granytat,2013-02-12T18:54Z,"hey, when are you uploading a new squad update, would be very useful considering the january transfer window"
