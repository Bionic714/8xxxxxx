 Soup Sisters are a Calgary-based non-profit enterprise founded in 2009. They are dedicated to making a tangible difference to the lives of women and children in need. Soup Sisters believe in the power of soup and the nutrition, comfort and warmth that the gift of soup can bring. This belief has resonated quickly and profoundly with communities across Canada, who come together through their local Soup Sisters events to cook, share and donate soup, to women's shelters in their community. The Soup Sisters' growing network has over 4,500 supporters, who collectively donate over 8,000 bowls of soup every month--over 75,000 bowls of soup have been donated to date
