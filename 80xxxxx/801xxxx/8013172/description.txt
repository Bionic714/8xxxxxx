In the UK we throw away 6.7 million tonnes of food a year - that's a third of all the food we buy, and a fifth of our total domestic waste. And about half of it could be eaten.
 Kate Colquhoun shows how to make your food go much, much further than you thought possible. 

 On her mission to use up leftovers, wrinkly fruit and past-it veg, she includes modern, tasty recipes for:

 ΓÇó Bakes

 ΓÇó Crumbles
 ΓÇó Curries
 ΓÇó Fishcakes
 ΓÇó Gratins
 ΓÇó Marinades
 ΓÇó Meatballs
 ΓÇó Milkshakes
 ΓÇó Pies Soups
 ΓÇó Stews
 ΓÇó Stir-fries


 ΓÇó . . . And more!
