,lyzetk,2013-01-14T01:23Z,"All of you commenters any seriously retarded.  It's Academy Award season, that's the whole reason there are so many high quality screeners out right now.  They're all going to have watermarks because they're not meant for release, they're meant for people in the industry.

Just be thankful that you have nearly DVD quality copies of all of these movies while they're still in theatres."

,silentinquiry,2013-01-14T17:33Z,My arent we all self righteous. You're getting me all teary eyed
,silentinquiry,2013-01-14T17:57Z,"Sorry, whether you like it or not, I prefer to wait for a clean dvd copy, sans watermark. My perogative. And I have your ""seriously retarded"" hanging, you jerk off. It's morons like you that  always have to make negative comments just to make yourself look important. Grow up. "
,star_trek_thebest,2013-01-14T20:15Z,Are there english subs for the foreign language parts?
,Synthesist,2013-01-17T04:44Z,"What you don't seem to get silentinquiry, is that when it says DVDScr, WE KNOW there will be an intermittent watermark.  We don't need you braying it in comments like a jackass.  If the movie is not what you require, SILENTLY walk away."
,silentinquiry,2013-01-17T15:32Z,"What you don't seem to get that a lot of people don't like the watermarks plastered all over it. And some of the uploaders are so anxious to get their little pink skull that they avoid being truthful about what their upload really contains. I am just saving others the trouble of going through all the downloading time like I had to do, only to find the movie is ruined with the egocentric watermarks. If this is ok with you ? huh? "

,ready4war,2013-01-26T22:42Z,"Silentinquiry...you need to stfu...You have come back to the same page repeatedly for several days to reply to people commenting about you.  Move on and get a life!  If you consider a watermark on the screen for 10 seconds, 6 times in two hours ruining a movie, go to the theather and pay for the real deal.  Again this is a free website and the DVD being uploaded are not meant for the public!  Stop trolling and move on!

Oh btw you are an annoying watermark! lol"
