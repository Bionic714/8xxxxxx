Here's a new one for the whole family featuring the voices of Christian Slater, Mark Hamill, Tom Kenny, Tim Curry and more. 

P.S.
While many other groups like to rip things off of VOD and claim they are DVDRiPs, we think that is a joke.  Since this film is already on VOD we did what any respectable group should do in this case and have provided proof of the DVD source.
