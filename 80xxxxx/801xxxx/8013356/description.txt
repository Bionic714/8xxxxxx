How.To.Fall.In.Love.2012.DVDRip.XviD-PTpOWeR





Plot: It is a tale as old as time, a tale as old as space, a tale as old as love itself. What you have here is the would-be ugly duckling (who is actually a hottie) who convinces the out-and-out hottie to make him into a hottie. Of course, then new hottie and old hottie fall hot(tie) and heavy and there are issues which must then be resolved. Okay, we promise to never use the term ‘hottie’ again if you promise to consider watching Eric Mabius, Brooke D’Orsay, and Kathy Najimy in this Hallmark original.
