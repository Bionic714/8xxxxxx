This Alan Ladd film did not come up in my searches and so I have made a fresh torrent of it.


Summary from IMDb


 A group of agents in the U.S. Office of Strategic Services (forerunner of the C.I.A.) are sent to France, during World War II, to knock out the French railroad system and, in accomplishing this mission, most of them will be killed because of an inside betrayal. After the war, one of the agents returns to find the traitor. Written by Les Adams &lt;longhorn1939@suddenlink.net&gt;

With this short summary most of the plot is left intact without spoilers.

After World War II Hollywood used revenge for acts or slights during WWII repeatedly.  Robert Montgomery's Ride The Pink Horse  (1947, also with Wanda Hendrix) is another example.  I cite this specifically because in Ride The Pink Horse (referring to a merry go round) one of the characters notes that Montgomery (and Alan Ladd in this picture by inference) had a "soldier gun."  After the "Good War"  GI's were allowed to keep their side arms from the field.  No research has ever been done that I know of which documents real life mayhem caused by this peculiar practice of the US government.

Ride The Pink Horse is also recommended.

Enjoy the film.  I watched Captain Carey twice myself.
