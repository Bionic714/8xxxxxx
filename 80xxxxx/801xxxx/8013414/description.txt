Rachel Rising #13
Publisher:  Abstract Studio
Publication Date:  December 26, 2012

Story & Art by Terry Moore

People are dying at an alarming rate in the little town of Manson. All of them in freak accidents with no apparent connection to one another. But Rachel sees a pattern forming on the map--a pentagram--and she knows who is responsible: Lilith, the first woman to set foot on earth. Nominated for multiple Eisner and Harvey Awards, Rachel Rising is an intense horror story from Terry Moore.
