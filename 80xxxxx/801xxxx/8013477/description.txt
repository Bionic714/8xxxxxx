From wikipedia:

Miami Connection is a 1987 independent martial arts film starring Y.K. Kim, who also wrote and produced the feature.[1] It remained unseen for decades until Drafthouse Films restored the film for a proper release in 2012.[2] The film was released on DVD, Blu-ray, limited-edition VHS, and various digital download options on December 11, 2012.

Plot
The synth rock band Dragon Sound, consisting of five University of Central Florida students, embarks on a crime-crushing justice in the streets of Orlando against groups of cocaine smugglers and ninjas.

History
The film was made in 1987. Richard Park, a film director, saw Y.K. Kim on the Korean talk show Meet at 11 p.m. in the mid-1980s. Park met Kim and convinced him to make a film. Kim said that he hoped to find a distributor so the film would play nationally, but hundreds of distribution companies and studios rejected the film. It opened in September 1988 in eight theaters in Greater Orlando. The film had a cost of about $1 million. In 2009 a programmer at the Alamo Drafthouse Cinema in Austin, Texas, Zack Carlson, found the film on eBay and made a blind bid. His bid, for $50 ($54.16 when adjusted for inflation) won.

--This rip was from a blue ray (what ever that is) so that makes me think that the quality of the film reels must have suffered over time.  I've never watched the movie but I thought you guys might like it.  It sounds amazing!  --Churl
