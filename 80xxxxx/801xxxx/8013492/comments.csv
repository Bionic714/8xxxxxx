,ciderhouse,2013-03-29T15:41Z,"Not a ""BDRip"" if it's a WEB-DL. The BD hasn't even been released yet. Although WEB-DL's (e.g. iTunes) are very good quality (already one posted on here on Dec 2012), they are not the same as a BDRip. You should change the title of this torrent (and perhaps remove the fake BD cover)..."
