,Co-pilotdiego,2013-05-20T14:00Z,"Downloaded and working perfectly!
Thanks so much!

1 question though: i tried to activate the HUD for the 737-800 via the iFly tool, and in the VC it doesnt appear! Somebody knows how to get the HUD working properly? The Gauges are installed, but just the HUD won't show up. Only the little silly bar that can go up/down. Any ideas? Thanks in advance."
