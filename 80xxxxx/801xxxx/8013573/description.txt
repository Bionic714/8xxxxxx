It's finally here to all pirates, the long awaited update V 3.0 for the iFly 737, 

tested and fully working. Instructions in the read-me file. Note: if you get an error 

saying a needed file is missing, check your "FS9/iFly" folder for a folder named 

"Updates"...If that's missing then you screwed something up when you installed 

version 2.1

Also, for the included crack to work, just place it in your FS9/Guages folder and run.

Re-install your textures and enjoy...I also advise that you save your sound-set and 

replace it after the update...FS9/Aircraft/iFly600 or you can just put the sound 

folder into the aircraft folder and enjoy.

This my first torrent so I hope it works....arrrgggghhhhh.
