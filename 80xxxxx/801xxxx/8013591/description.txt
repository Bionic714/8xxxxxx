ZOOT has been running neck and neck with DEXTER for the top spot on my short list

of tenor saxmen for years.....yes....even ahead of Coltrane.


This album has Zoot reaching into his Ben Webster bag.


Sweets Edison is the master of musical concision.  No superfluous notes.

His solo on track #7 MAUVE is a textbook example of this.


An even better example of musical brevity is Neil Young's one note solo on

Cinnamon Girl (circa 1970)  album:  Neil Young
