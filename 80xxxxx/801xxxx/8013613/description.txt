Nature Documentary hosted by Gordon Buchanan, published by BBC in 2013 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

Wildlife cameraman Gordon Buchanan follows a wild polar bear family over three seasons, something no one has done before.


1)  Spring 
Gordon and arctic survival experts travel by boat to far flung Svalbard. They manage to find a polar bear birth den and meet mother Lyra and her cubs Miki and Luca as they emerge from their den. Gordon helps scientists fit Lyra with a tracking collar and takes on the mission of living with this remarkable bear family.

2)  Summer 
Gordon Buchanan and the team return to Svalbard in mid-June on the trail of Lyra and her cubs Miki and Luca. Gordon works with scientists to try to understand how his polar bear family are surviving the unusual arctic weather. He finds Lyra and renews his bond with her, but discovers that cub Luca is missing. Lyra is devoted to her remaining cub Miki, but his future is also uncertain. Gordon documents the intimate details of polar bear family life as he sees Lyra and Miki in their epic struggle to survive as this mother bear tries to keep her cub safe.

3)  Autumn 
Gordon Buchanan and the team return to Svalbard in September on the trail of Lyra and her cub Miki. They have been away for six weeks and don't know if either bear is still alive. Lyra's collar hasn't sent a signal for a month - finding her this time will be a huge challenge. But Gordon does find her - and Miki is alive. Times are tough though. Lyra is very thin and has been reduced to eating moss and seaweed.
