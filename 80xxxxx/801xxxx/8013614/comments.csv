,D0gmeat,2013-01-13T04:54Z,Um why didn't you just post it as a movie file...? Or zip/rar it up? LOL Staying upwind of this one...
,Heromist,2013-01-13T08:58Z,"omg you guys are retarded.
open the iso file with what ever program.
I made it on Linux you dumbfucks.
I KNEW i was going to have this issue with you all
Look, open the iso, goto the folder. 
I ripped it from a site, the site said it was a .ro ext, 
when i did it i was curious about it too. 
""Why didnt you just upload it as a movie file""
RO IS A MOVIE FILE
you mean AVI or MKV or WMA or MP4?
i dont have a good video converter.
It werks. 
i wouldnt give you guys something bad. 
Not on the bay. NEVER.

GET WINWAR.
for the love of god, read the fucking description..."
,Heromist,2013-01-13T09:00Z,"2nd thing:
Why an iso?
I thought i would fuck with you guys.
And it worked TO well. If you know anything, get winrar. open it. DONE."
,harrypalmerman,2013-01-13T10:40Z,It says it has 17 seeders but doesn't download.   Is this for real.
,Heromist,2013-01-13T12:30Z,"huh, im seeding. 
is it working?"
,adrian17cy,2013-01-13T13:09Z,"no, it's not working. Just upload the file as a video, as it is. It is the same procedure as you did with the iso."
,rkh3,2013-01-13T15:24Z,"for Ktorrent: make a new directory, put all the parts you want fpr the torrent into it, File->New in Ktorrent, when the window pops up pick that directory.  No .. Big .. Deal."
,TerraTech,2013-01-13T19:15Z,"So let me get this straight?  The guy took time out of his life and recorded and created this torrent, uploaded it to share it so you all could see it.  So he f*cked up a bit, so what. It happens. 
Now you call him an imbecile and mommys boy and sh*t.  
You must be some f*cked up primitive losers to behave like that and really should seek help for your angry outbursts, stemming from who knows where. If youre feeling inadequate and alone dont put it on others. Deal with it. Nobody wants immature rude neanderthals like you in a society and youll sooner or later find that out, probably the hard way. "
,TerraTech,2013-01-13T19:18Z,"and  btw Thanks for the effort Heromist, trust me, much more people appreciate it than the other way around. "
,Lcouchjr,2013-01-13T19:52Z,"I gave it 12 minutes before I stopped trying to download it. It was still sitting on 0.0%. I know it isn't my connection, I did a speedtest and it was showing 56.98 Mbps. I guess i'll just wait until a ""SKULL"" uploads it. :("
,p0ssessed,2013-01-13T22:16Z,Seed please.
,Lartzzzzz,2013-01-14T01:17Z,@blech12345 *giggles* You are raging over the wrong things. Read your post. Now read his. Read your post. Now back to his. Now look at mine. 
,Lartzzzzz,2013-01-14T02:27Z,Chill and get some old spice. It'll do you good ! 
,mwalsher,2013-01-14T04:34Z,"> Suck my bloody cum hole loser

Ouch! You should get that looked at; it’s not supposed to bleed.



He’s obviously some kid upset that he can’t watch his comic-book cartoon fast enough. Just ignore him.



For the record, there is definitely something wrong with this torrent. There are supposedly 100+ seeds, yet nothing ("

,mwalsher,2013-01-14T04:46Z,"Strangely enough, Heromist seems to be capable of uploading videos, so I have no idea why the ISO:

,Heromist,2013-01-14T07:13Z,"MY god, you guys are pathetic:
ok do this,
1: download my fucking torrent
2: yes its a fucking ISO. 
I thought about a rar or a zip 
People complain when its a fucking zip bc people think its a fucking virus.
3: open the file with, Magic iso, with winrar, something. 
Almost anything can open an ISO.
4: goto the .ro file run it in VLC or whatever movie player.
the reason its a ro file is because it was that format when i ripped it.
If you have more issues. let me know.
for one READ THE FUCKING DESCRIPTION YOU DUMBASSES.
Also, im seeding. idk what the hell is going on.."
,Heromist,2013-01-14T07:16Z,"heres what ill do, Ill go remake it. I didnt want to use my fucking utorrent cause its a .exe and they dont make it for linux. pisses me off. My favorite torrent program. Anyhow. Ill remake it and make to where you dumbfucks can open it. My god, do you hear yourselfs.
And you are a fucking dumbass IF you dont realize that the Facebook i mentioned is actually my fanpage. GG there boss. "
,Heromist,2013-01-14T07:26Z,im gonna make a new torrent. please see my facebook page when its uploaded. about 10 or so minutes. i hope not too long.
,Lartzzzzz,2013-01-14T14:11Z,"Haha, yes. But all those problems he has will be gone with some old spice. "
,mwalsher,2013-01-14T23:54Z,"> Hey MW - YOU can suck my bloody shit hole.

That’s not supposed to bleed either. You must be really sick and diseased."
,adrian17cy,2013-01-19T20:44Z,Ha ha!!! Just passed to read new comments! Isn't it wonderful how people keep fighting for nothing?
