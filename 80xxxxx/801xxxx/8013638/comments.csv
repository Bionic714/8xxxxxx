I will definitely NOT pay for it - I will pirate it."
,topk,2013-02-06T15:08Z,"Nothing personal, Pirate Bay, I will not pay for your film - I will pirate it, like I always do."
,tpbmusic23,2013-02-06T17:24Z,They will however not demand money for it. Paying is just a way to donate money to the producer...
