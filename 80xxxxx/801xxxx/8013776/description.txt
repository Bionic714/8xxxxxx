What's NewΓÇöThe Highlights

    Pareto chart of t-values of effects: Quickly see the vital few effects relative to the trivial many from two-level factorial experiments.

    New ΓÇ£Color ByΓÇ¥ option: Color-code points on graphs according to the level of another factorΓÇöa great way to incorporate another piece of information into a graph.

    Right-click on any response cell and ΓÇ£ignoreΓÇ¥ it: This feature allows you to ignore a response data point without having to ignore the entire row.
    ΓÇ£Screen tipsΓÇ¥: Press the new tips button for enlightenment on the current screenΓÇöthis is especially helpful for novice users.

    3D surface plots for categorical factors: See colored bars towering above others where effects are greatest.

    ΓÇ£Min Run Res IVΓÇ¥ (two-level factorial) designs for 5 to 50 factors: Screen main effects with maximum efficiency in terms of experimental runs.

    ΓÇ£Min-Run Res VΓÇ¥ designs for 6 to 31 factors: Resolve two-factor interactions (2FI's) in the least runs possible while maintaining a balance in low versus high levels.

    Two-level fractional factorials for up to 512 runs and 21 factors: Build bigger designs than ever-before possible.

    On plots of effects simply draw a box around the ones you want selected for your model: This is much easier than clicking each one with your mouse.

    Central composite designs (CCDΓÇÖs) are now available for up to 30 factors and 8 blocks: This represents a significant expansion in RSM capability.

    CCDΓÇÖs are available that are based on the Min-Run Res V fractional-factorial core: Take advantage of a much more efficient design for larger numbers of factors.

    Box-Behnken designs are expanded up to 21 factors: This popular RSM design previously was limited to certain numbers of factors, but that is no longer the case.

    Crosshairs window: Predict your response at any place in the response surface plot.

    Full-color contour and 3D surface plots: Graduated or banded colorization adds life to reports and presentations.

    Magnification feature: An incredible tool for expanding a mixture graph that is originally a small sliver and difficult to interpret.

    Mixture-in-mixture designs: Develop sophisticated experiments for immiscible liquids or multilayer films involving separate formulations that may interact.

    Add blocks D-optimally: This feature will be especially useful for mixture designs, which previously could not be blocked automatically.

    Mixture design builder recognizes inverted simplexes and constrained regions that benefit by being inverted: This provides dramatic advantages in the power for estimating model terms.

    Points on 3D graphs: See "lollipops" protruding from surfaces where actual responses were collected.

    Row(s) in the design layout are highlighted when point(s) are selected on the diagnostics: The highlighting feature makes identification of problematic data much easier.

    Numerical optimization solutions are now carried over to graphical optimization and point prediction: Explore the results of the numerical optimization on other screens.
