Welcome as always, my friend.

@DanaWhite
Yes. it's a broadcast TS rip. Full 60fps and no encoding, so it's top quality.

@Xanthium111111
Lol. Anything that doesn't have commercials I can upload within 3-5 minutes after broadcast. That's why I love doing Showtime and HBO stuff. You're very welcome. :)

@saffronsghost
Prelims in an encoded 400p and natural 60fps TS both up! Enjoy. :)"
