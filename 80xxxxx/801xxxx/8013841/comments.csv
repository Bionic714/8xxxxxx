,DTheTorrentFan657289,2013-01-21T16:15Z,"It's a collection of some episodes to date. A lot of TV shows went on holiday break during late November to early January. The season will be finished in another few weeks once the last few eps air. Otherwise, this is a low ballast, decent quality assortment of the first few episodes TO DATE.

Good effort!"
