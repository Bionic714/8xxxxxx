The official prequel to next summer's 'TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN' film kicks off here! 'TRANSFORMERS: DESTINY' is comprised of two four-part stories covering events leading up to the film. In the first chapter of the DESTINY story arc, 'ALLIANCE,' readers will learn more about what happened to SECTOR SEVEN, what happened to the AUTOBOTS, and why their war on our planet is far from over.
