In anticipation of the upcoming motion picture event, TRON: LEGACY, Walt Disney Studios is teaming up with Marvel Comics to bring you a stunning new visualization of the original TRON story.  The race is on for Flynn and Tron to reach the central computer and take down the Master Control Program... but with Sark on their tail and every program under the MCP's command after them, will they survive the journey? Adapted by comics icon Peter David and drawn by breakout artist Mirco Pierfederici, there's no better way to get downloaded into the TRON universe!
