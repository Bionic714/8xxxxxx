Yeah, man. It's coo. TS stands for Transport Stream, which are direct copies of the TV broadcast in its original quality. You're basically watching what was shown to me on my own TV.

Always welcome, my friend."

Well, I love MMA and it's still not recognized by many people in many places in the world. Gotta help spread it. No one else does so in a normal fashion in the pirate world. Everything becomes big and recognized now days through the internet, so the more available I make it, the more people know about it. In turn, they start supporting the industry and buying merchandise, tickets, etc. Anything to help MMA grow. The main objective to my account is uploading MMA. I do other stuff as well, but that's just for fun and when I'm bored."
