2012/2013

Duration: 1 hour, 30 minutes

Gary Lineker introduces the best of the action and reaction from the day's eight Premier League matches.

A trip to Stoke may hold less fear for Chelsea than most clubs, as it is a fixture they had not lost since 1975. Nonetheless, recent meetings have been hard fought and Chelsea only won this season's reverse fixture with a late goal by Ashley Cole.

Other games include the meeting between European hopefuls Everton and Swansea at Goodison Park, Aston Villa against fellow strugglers Southampton, Queens Park Rangers versus Tottenham Hotspur, and Reading's home fixture with West Brom."
