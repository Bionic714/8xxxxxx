,dWdHELLCAT,2013-01-13T09:40Z,"yeah i'd love to get the 720 version,but it would take me a week because of all the leeches that don't seed,you get all this for free so you could at least spring for a decent internet plan you tight arses."

On this file, I'm seeing 3,853 people downloading and only 361 seeding. I already personally uploaded the file 7x's already. People love to take and run.

@dWdHELLCAT
Right now the 720p copy has 1,847 downloaders and 347 seeders, so with the ratio it may actually be a faster download when you do the math. Give it a shot and try your luck. Maybe you'll get good results."
