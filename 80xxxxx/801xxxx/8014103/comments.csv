,TeeHarvey,2013-01-13T15:20Z,For UAofE to tell the result of the game is WRONG on so many levels... somebody please fuck his mother in the eye socket
,hadi_22,2013-01-13T16:10Z,"there is no other logical reason for UAofE to spoil the game other than he expects us to bash him.
So here it goes, fuck you you cock sucker mother fucker"
,skycop51,2013-01-13T16:43Z,US Veteran living abroad would have no games just scores. I thank you so much!
,timotheophany,2013-01-13T16:45Z,"Lesson learned though, right? If you're torrenting a game you haven't seen yet, DON'T LOOK AT THE $@*&%@ COMMENTS BEFORE YOU WATCH IT!"
,GreenBlount,2013-01-13T17:27Z,"@timotheophany
Wrong, im torrenting this, because i never seen such a good game before (some records broken by that young Holiday), and i want to keep this on my hard drive for the future. Im not a fan of either teams, but a fan of challenging games. And boy, that was one of them. Hats off before the heroes of this glorious battlefield. And many thanks for the upload!"
,timotheophany,2013-01-13T17:59Z,"Also, I realize this was a long game, but almost ten GB? Damn this is going to take a while to download."
,hawkins4,2013-01-13T19:57Z,Yes i wish i could download and watch a 10gb anything.Hope someone puts in a low gb of this here game.
,ClamNutz,2013-01-13T20:07Z,"UAofE is a worthless faggot who needs to go fuck his grandparents a little more up their asses so they can continue to share their chlamydia with each other. What's it like when your sister is your mother you shit slurping cocksucker? Hope you enjoy the virus I'm gonna send you, you waste of life."
,barabusignasius,2013-01-14T02:30Z,Thanks for compressing this to only 9 gigs.
,FukkenSaved,2013-01-14T05:44Z,"I already knew the result because they always blow past games when you're watching later ones. The secret is to file it and watch it a few months later when you forgot the result. We have an entire spring, summer and fall ahead of us with no real sports.
The problem here is that it's 10 freakin' gigabytes. I already recorded this but it cut off because I didn't expect it to last so long. I can probably get the overtime portion if it turns out not to be a solid archive.
Traditionally a movie went on one CD, that's 700 mb for 1.5 hours. This game was like 5 hours so it shouldn't be more than 2, less than one if you cut the commercials...if you're wondering why you can't find old football games this is why"
,FukkenSaved,2013-01-14T05:55Z,"And you can help the situation by not putting everything as a linked rar set because nobody who permanently stores stuff is going to keep it that way. You get 5% at most by doing that, probably a lot less with x264. If people don't permanently store the data (which you're already harming with such large files) then stuff will not get seeded in the long term, and as this is sure to be the torrents will be dead within a few weeks."
,user34567890,2013-01-14T10:54Z,DO NOT SCROLL DOWN THERE ARE SPOILERS!
,user34567890,2013-01-14T10:58Z,"A: 9.5 
V: 9.5

1080p source. There are some sound glitches and digital artifacts, especially in the 4th quarter. 

No reason this should be 10 gigs, but oh well.

People who try to spoil the game for others are deeply wounded and emotionally defective. But they know this. Pity them."
