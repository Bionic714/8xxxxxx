This hot electro set is a departure from what I normally play as resident DJ in Muse Taipei, these tracks are in my rotation but not like this!!! Have the latest from Avicii, Dada Life, Chuckie, Joahim Garraud and killer remixes from Maison & Dragen, Wolfgang Gartner and Cosmic Dawn! And the brand new track from Sidney Samson!!! Enjoy!
