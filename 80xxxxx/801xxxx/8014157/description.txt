Before her untimely death at the age of 54, Teena Marie, known as the Ivory Queen of Soul or simply Lady Tee and as one of the only white artists ever signed to Motown Records, was working on her 14th and latest album, Beautiful. Recorded at her home studio and finished except for final mixes, Beautiful was seen through to its conclusion by TeenaΓÇÖs 20-year-old daughter Alia Rose, who sings with her Mom on two tracks, a cover of Curtis MayfieldΓÇÖs ΓÇ£Give Me Your LoveΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£Rare Breed,ΓÇ¥ which she co-wrote (Alia co-wrote two more songs on the album, ΓÇ£Sweet ToothΓÇ¥ and the title song). The first single, ΓÇ£Luv Letter,ΓÇ¥ is an homage to TeenaΓÇÖs Motown roots, with nods to Stevie WonderΓÇÖs ΓÇ£Signed, Sealed, Delivered IΓÇÖm Yours,ΓÇ¥ and a dedication to AliaΓÇÖs father, who just happened to be a postman, like in the MarvelettesΓÇÖ song of the same name.
