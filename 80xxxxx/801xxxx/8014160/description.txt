Special thanks goes out to user "rambam1776" for his FLAC uploads of Pavement, in particular the 2-disc reissues. I've been looking forever for those.

This is Alan Silvestri's score for the 1986 film "Flight of the Navigator". Please be decent and seed to at least a 2.0 ratio to help keep this torrent alive, because it's hard to easily find in FLAC, and I won't be seeding it forever.
