I'd like to thank archive.org, YouTube user VintageBritishComedy, Soulseek, and a few others for the various sources of her music. Without them I would not have been able to collect this many tracks [originally only 14 listed on Wikipedia].

If you have any complaints about quality let me remind you these songs are 80-100 years old and quality is as good as you're going to get. I tried my best to find better quality tracks where I could. Several of the YouTube sources had tracks joined together and I splitted whenever possible. Some track were not meant to be split so I left them be. For splitting tracks I used mp3 Splitter Joiner Pro, VirtualDJ Home Free. For conversion I used Freemake Audio Converter as well as a nifty site for converting Youtube videos to mp3.

P.S. If I'm missing a few tracks or if there are any tracks that are misplaced please let me know. This is a fan-made collection. There are no official releases for Florrie Forde's complete works.
