since we now have a sony bravia 2012 smart tv that can play files over wifi from my nas box running twonky i have found out that its very fussy on avi headers

and the avimuxgui throws it off which I used to align on interleaves for audio

seems I have to untick rec lists (which is
for media player windows to seek better)
and untick open DML

else it gives unsupported error on tv

so I will be changing the header creation from ow on so works for that.

seems though our samsumg smart tv 32 inch has no issues with either setting though

abvs converter using adv L5 profile and cbr mp3 audio also works fine but it dont align on interleaves which can be bad for some dvd players but I havent noticed issues with aligned or split on any gear here with it loosing sync"
