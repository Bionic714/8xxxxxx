No need to install,
No need to put serials and cracks to get the full version, (already done it for you).
No unnecessary registry changes, 
No boring installation of tool-bars in your browser,
You can even run this torrent from USB-Stick.
This makes a '1-click run' version a better version.

Lots of programs saved in your computer do exactly as they please. Many applications consider themselves to be so important that they trigger an auto-start command in the system without being requested. That means that every time the computer is booted up, they are started together with Windows, which isnΓÇÖt always the userΓÇÖs intention. As a result of this, the start sequence becomes considerably longer ΓÇô and manually shutting down most of the unwanted windows immediately afterwards because they simply arenΓÇÖt needed, certainly isnΓÇÖt fun.

The Ashampoo StartUp Tuner 2 lists all auto-start entries and allows them to be individually deleted or to be deactivated. If the user proceeds with caution in this area, and at least deactivates all of the unnecessary entries, then they will be able to enjoy a clearly faster start to Windows.
