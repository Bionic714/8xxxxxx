Meanwhile, thanks for these. Haven't come across The Perfumed Scorpion before."

OCR type is Clearscan, so they look great. Only complaint is they are done in color instead of black and white -- it inflates the file size unnecessarily.

Thanks again."

I recommend processing scanned images with ScanTailor before generating the pdf -- it takes longer, but the results are worth it, in my opinion."
