,emijrp,2013-01-13T17:43Z,"RIP Aaron.

I don't think this torrent was his work but it is related to the JSTOR thingy. The story behind this torrent http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/6554331"
,dithered_reality,2013-01-14T11:17Z,"RayMolacha: This is not Aaron Swartz' work.  Aaron Swarz was attempting to acquire non-free, current publications, and agreed to surrender the data he was in possession of.  The publications in this torrent are the ones JSTOR wants to publish for free download, and are all written prior to 1923.  These articles are ""out-of-copyright"".

JSTOR made these articles public in 2011.

Thank you for providing them all in an easy-to-download format, though."
,Anomalous,2013-01-15T05:39Z,"emijrp: thanks for the link. I got this back in July of 2011, when Aaron was indicted. I knew it was old, out-of-copyright work -- but I was under the impression that it was a non-contentious portion of Aaron's vast scraping. Reading gmax's description makes it clear that this is not the case. 

I apologize for any confusion. In any event, when I heard what happened to Aaron, ,I dug this out and put it up, much in the same spirit of gmax's original upload. 

I do believe that JSTOR relaxed their policy *after* Aaron's arrest. (They also declined to press charges or to pursue the matter in civil court.)"

,Anomalous,2013-01-15T14:07Z,"dithered_reality -- you are absolutely right.Thank you for pointing that out. I got this from here when it was initially released, and didn't see that it was still here and active (although I searched for JSTOR, that word wasn't in the original filename). Very sorry for any confusion. Thanks for clearing that up. It was never my intention to duplicate someone else's torrent. "
,cFranzc,2013-01-16T15:46Z,I use this material for consult my cuestions :D
,behold_the_radiant_brow,2013-02-22T05:57Z,"I am an history student with full access to JSTOR, but am downloading this anyway, partly as a gesture of solidarity, but mostly because the JSTOR archive is horrifically badly organised, and user-unfriendly. I thank anyone who spares me the indignity of using the JSTOR site. Now I just have to find ""Linda Colley, ‘The Apotheosis of George III: Loyalty, Royalty and the British Nation, 1760–1820’, Past and Present, 102 (1984), 94–129."" in this archive, and I can continue my studies without developing an ulcer.
