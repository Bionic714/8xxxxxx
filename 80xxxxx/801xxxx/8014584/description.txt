Aaron Swartz was was an internet activist. He believed tha information should be free. He co-authored the RSS 1.0 spec. He released about 20% of the PACER database of US Federal Court Documents. He set up a laptop in a utility closet at MIT and downloaded 35GB of the JSTOR archive.

Clearly he was a great risk to society. The feds arrested him. If he had been found guilty, he could have faced up to 50 years in prison, and a $4 million dollar fine. Wrap you head around that. 

Two days ago, Aaron Swartz was found hung in his apartment. 

This is his work. Let's keep this alive in his memory.

My bandwidth is pretty slow, so be patient and please continue to seed.
