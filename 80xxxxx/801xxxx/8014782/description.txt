A love triangle develops between the old-fashioned Christopher Tietjens, his vindictive wife Sylvia and young suffragette Valentine Wannop, in the midst of World War I and a Europe on the brink of profound change. As the war drags on, Christopher goes to fight in France, and leaves behind Sylvia, a son who may or may not be his and Valentine. He must ultimately decide who he is to remain with for the duration of his life: the beautiful yet manipulative Sylvia or the adoring Valentine.
