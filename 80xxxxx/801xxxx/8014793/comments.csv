[V],YIFY,2013-01-14T14:43Z,"thanks, people will not be impressed with 10bit since it isnt supported on xbox/ps3  and many media players."
,Vebb22,2013-01-14T19:05Z,"But new android nadiOS devices supports it ;)

Who cares about ps3/xbox?

Selfbuild HTPC is the thing."
[V],YIFY,2013-01-15T03:36Z,If I was encoding for purely personal use I would use 10bit without thinking twice. but since this is all done for the people i guess I cant really drop all xbox and PS3 and some media player support at this point
