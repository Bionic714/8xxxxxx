,gr689,2013-01-13T17:43Z,"Thank You CP been waiting for this one; Some sort of legal problems with cartoon network and DC animated division over rights of some of the characters; would hate to find out that this show gets cancelled; its the BEST show out right now and I know we all want MORE..Your the always the fastest one to get YJ up....would love it if we could get it the same day; but a big THANK YOU anyhow. 
Anyway for 480p or 720p to get uploaded just as quickly? "

,bitternugget,2013-01-13T20:37Z,Is there going to be an HD release?
,bob9001a,2013-01-13T22:25Z,Horrible quality as usual from cp
[V],{C_P},2013-01-14T02:27Z,"bitternugget: Sorry but we don't have any that can capture it in HD.

J-RedtheRed: No, they only air a heavily cropped version. They took the 16:9 and cropped it down to 4:3 so we dropped that cartoon for now. :( "
,ScottyD7421,2013-01-14T12:58Z,"Awesome {C_P}, many thanks for uploading.

Excellent quality as usual. Was starting to worry this show wouldn't come back to air.

Cheers"

,iamokaw,2013-02-11T09:39Z,Why does it look like the top and the bottom is chopped off? Like it was poorly cropped?
