,trilllo,2013-01-21T07:19Z,"Does not save the game.

What do?"
,trilllo,2013-01-21T07:22Z,"Nevermind, it didn't activate Xlive the first few times I started it. It just did it, can't save without logging into a profile."
,trilllo,2013-01-22T05:29Z,Turns out if I activate PhysX xlive will not activate and thus no game saving/loading.
,tradori,2013-01-30T17:48Z,watch this one it triggered my anti-virus.  backdoor greybird trojan.  no wonder the uploader is anonymous
,hamood_d10,2013-01-31T12:03Z,"For Windows 8 x86 no need for this guide

For people who use Windows 8 x64

1- Go to ""C:WindowsSysWOW64"".
2- Copy ""xlive.dll, xlive.dll (Security Catalogue), xlivefnt.dll, xliveinstall.dll, xliveinstallhost.exe"" to ""C:WindowsSystem32"".

Now you can play using PhysX and xlive
Because it look for these files in SysWOW64 not System32

Have fun"

start game on EASY
In Normal mode , there are chances of crash
For those who already started game in NORMAL:
GO TO C:Program FilesR.G. CatalystBatman Arkham CityBmGameCookedPCConsole
