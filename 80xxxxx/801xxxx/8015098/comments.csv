,singtoh,2013-03-09T09:50Z,"Hello benyalux thanks for the upload, zero clipping on the albums i downloaded. if you would like to check your entire flac library for clipping very easily go here: http://forum.audacityteam.org/viewtopic.php?f=48&t=69430&start=10, last post on page. Take the bash script, apply replaygain to all your flacs and run the script."

Cheers,
