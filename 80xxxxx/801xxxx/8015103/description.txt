Password Depot Professional

Password Depot is a powerful and user-friendly password manager which helps to manage all your passwords.

Password Security:
- Best protection of your data due to double encryption with Rijndael 256! Your password list is protected twice: with the master password and with an internal key.
- Protection from keylogging (intercepting of keystrokes) ΓÇô All password fields are internally protected from keylogging.
- Password Depot leaves no trace of your passwords in the RAM. So even an attempt by a hacker to use your computer and try to browse the cryptic memory dumps for passwords - a theoretical option - would be defeated.
- Clipboard protection ΓÇô Password Depot automatically detects any active clipboard viewers and masks its changes to the keyboard; after performing auto-complete, all sensitive data is automatically cleared from the clipboard.
- The integrated password generator creates virtually uncrackable passwords: instead of passwords like "sweetheart" or "John", which can both be cracked in a few minutes, you now use passwords like "g/:1bmV5T$x_sb}8T4@CN?A:y:Cwe-k)mUpHiJu:0md7p@
