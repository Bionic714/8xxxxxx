,lovestrange,2013-02-09T14:46Z,"@ anonym0ss - Thanks for the subs. Works great.

@ leligal -  Its shot in old 'Academy ratio', which is 4:3, with cameras from the 80's in order for it to look visually authentic and incorporate the period's video footages to give it a documentary look.

Excellent film. Pablo Larrain is quickly becoming one of the best filmmaker working. "
,hfvalenz,2013-02-27T05:04Z,"@leligal the film is filmed on betacam, so it will look like it's made in the chilean 80's"
