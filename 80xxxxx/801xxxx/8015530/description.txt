Overview:

Many lives have been lost on the lethal rocks surrounding the harbour town of Trewarthan. Mysteriously, a thick fog covers the land and the silence is shattered by the sound of ghastly foghorn. Suddenly, the faithful light of Fetch Rock Lighthouse is plunged into darkness. Follow Benjamin Parker, a young cartographer, sent to map the area, and Polly White, a ghost hunter determined to make contact with ΓÇ£the beyondΓÇ¥, as you explore the Lighthouse in four different time periods.

Use supernatural investigative techniques and realistic ghost hunting gadgets to reveal the evil presence that threatens Fetch Rock. Together you must defeat the evil that hides in the mist and uncover the mystery of Lights Out.

The game is best played in a dark room with your speakers turned up. Unless you're scared, of course.
