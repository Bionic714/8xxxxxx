,IAMH67,2013-01-14T01:40Z,"Might be a problem with your codec settings, I just watched the entire match from this file a minute ago.  Try running it with ""Media player classic"" or using ""K-lite"" codecs as it might be a VLC issue which is stripped of some codecs.

As you can see from the rest of my uploads people do not have complaints, and I have uploaded much worse qualities than this.

Yes it is not the best quality but it isn't the worst either, you might have noticed this in the description 

""Uploaded 10 minutes after the match."" 

Usually it takes people 7 hours or an entire day to upload a Torrent for football on TPB. Infact no other Torrent for this match has been uploaded on the TPB yet has it? And mine has been up right after the match ended. I do not go for 1080i quality in 3 days, I try to provide decent quality in 1 hours, there are many other users here who provide HQ torrents but you are being stupid if you are expecting an HD Torrent 10 minutes after the match.

The quality is not that bad either and ""the pixels are shit"" is really not an explanation as anyone else who has downloaded this file will tell you. This is a 640x360 video, the quality will remain the same if you play it as that but if you start stretching different resolutions everyone will get different results depending on their settings and not mine. The format and all the details are given in the info and I have even provided the screens. 

If you see the screens and think it is bad quality then don't download it? Of course when the video is stretched it might get blurry but it doesn't necessarily mean it will be the same for everyone. For example this is great quality for my laptop but for my TV's resolution it is small. Set the display size to ""normal"" and you will see the quality is 100% what I provided in the screens as the screens are from the video.
