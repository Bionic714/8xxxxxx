,brianxxx,2013-01-13T18:51Z,"Actually, the NRA (which I used to be a member of) is nothing more than a lobbying group for gun manufacturers. Back around 1920-1965 is when they were doing good by the people, then the money crept in. Now, the NRA makes more than 60% of it's direct income from manufacturers and the NRA does get a commission on large capacity magazines, gun sales, etc. Documented and admitted to by the NRA."
[T],spanikopita,2013-01-13T19:18Z,"Brianxxx...um. So what? Of course it is a lobbying group. Someone has to be organized to defend a right that is always and constantly under attack by elites who want us to believe that humans are not the cause of evil. It's carbon emissions, it's guns, it's lack of education, it's inequality. No. People are basically bad. Force levels the playing field and defends those who can not defend themselves. A lot.

So go ahead and be a minion. Pray that someone else protects you. 

“The most foolish mistake we could possibly make would be to allow the subject races to possess arms. History shows that all conquerors who have allowed their subject races to carry arms have prepared their own downfall by so doing. Indeed, I would go so far as to say that the supply of arms to the underdogs is a sine qua non for the overthrow of any sovereignty. So let’s not have any native militia or native police. German troops alone will bear the sole responsibility for the maintenance of law and order throughout the occupied Russian territories, and a system of military strong-points must be evolved to cover the entire occupied country.” - Adolf Hitler"
,GourmetPrince,2013-01-13T21:53Z,"Ohhhhh!!! Owned hard in those comments.

Fuck, those guys really pissed me off. The NRA may be involved in lobbying first and rights second, but at least they're involved at all.



Butt fuck man, I can't even comprehend the level of absolute stupidity, ignorance and arrogance of someone who would blame a massacre on peaceful gun owners or manufacturers. 

Want to end gun violence? Go end the fucking drug war then, which is the REAL cause of most violence associated with firearms. I've seen the constitution pissed on enough in my lifetime and I can't handle much more of it."
,Phaedron,2013-01-13T23:10Z,Thanks for this and for defending the 2nd Amendment and the Constitution.  I would love to see any of the NRA mags past and future until I can send in my subscription this next week. 
,brianxxx,2013-01-13T23:17Z,"It is not about defense, protection, rights, etc. That was my point. Your being suckered and fooled. Your money goes to the gun companies and the execs at NRA for salary and advertising...but only in ways that favor the manufacturers. 

I am a gun owner, I hunt and fish, come from a military family. I just prefer to use my mind to think and not be lead by the nose...which is what the NRA is doing. So you can be pissed at me for telling the truth, that is fine. But doesn't it piss you off you PAY and go along with the lies? If you donated money to protect children from being abused, then found out that very money was helping the children get abused...wouldn't you be upset? If not...you should be bothered by it...but then again many people need to deny the truth and choose to not see the facts because the truth hurts too much.

Besides, all those tired old arguments are worn out now...protection, self defense, gubbon'ment comin' to bust out muh corn liquor still and takes my guns, freedom, rights, etc. blah blah blah.

All I know is 1000000000 to 1 odds the hot air, big talk crowd is the first to piss their pants and run or drop to the floor crying as soon as you actually do face a gun or a SWAT team. "

,GourmetPrince,2013-01-14T23:59Z,"Two-thousand dollars said brianxxfag was on guard duty for 2 weeks and once killed a squirrel when he was 13.

When someone tries to compare the NRA to child abuse, you know they're fucking with you. 

Get lost, loser. There's plenty of Obama bots on the huffington post that would absolutely loooove to hear you out. But here, fuck off."
,triggerjerk,2013-01-15T08:41Z,"Technically, the NRA defends the second freedom, but that's just being pedantic.

I've been an NRA member for many, many years, and only let it slide when they insisted that I support Mitt. 

I don't really think things would be any better for us now if he had won. Bush II promised us a lot, but we lost more with him in than we did in the last four years. They're all pandering whores anyway.

And it always amuses me when someone calls the NRA an arm of the gun manufacturers. They may seem big guys to us, but they're small potatoes compared to most corporations. It's the 60,000,000 Members who all send in their $20, $50, or $100 that give them the power. Oh, and the fact that nearly every single one of them votes."
