I noticed soon as 2013 hit, there were a tonne of Magix's softwares posted, and a while ago, someone asked if I could put up all 20 gigs of my collection. Sorry its doubled in size since then. There are 12 DVD ISOs each ranging from 4.0 gig to 4.37 gigs in size each. No particular order, took me most of the evening to write them to ISO's and its gonna take me even longer to seed this. But once again, the "Baddest Man Online" uploads the largest collection of something. I'm on cracked wifi, all the abrasive "SEED!" comments will be ignored. Saying the word SEED! doesn't make it come any faster to you. Bitching and complaining wont get it there faster, if anything you leaving them comments slows your own speed, doesn't contribute to anything and honestly makes you look like a crybaby, "oh wah wah wah I'm not getting my free thing fast enough" My answer to these people, you want em faster, go buy em. And ill promise you one thing, you wont be able to buy most of these considering they don't even  sell some of these anymore.

Total size 49.6 gigs, unpack with winrar, mount with your favorite iso tools, copy and paste whatever, i gave you a bunch of different ways here to get them off the isos, nothing ultra packed or nothing, figured this is the way to go with it instead of waiting days for winrar to finish packing these up.
