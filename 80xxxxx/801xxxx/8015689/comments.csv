I was totally hyped to buy it but that was in November. And they haven't even given us so much as a public explanation. That's unacceptable, considering the years of hype and crowd funding that went into this. Sorry guys maybe I'll buy your next album... If you don't pull this crap again."
,Umbras363,2013-02-23T00:59Z,"Hey, man, no worries. I've talked with some of the people at ZREO (I myself am a member of their sister-project MREO, which does Metroid instead of Zelda, respectively) and it's not their fault. The reason it's taken so long is because of their ties with Nintendo over in Japan and how long it's taking them to communicate with the ZREO team.

Totally not their fault.

However, at least you probably had a chance to get the Twilight Symphony physical copies ordered! I didn't. If you don't recall a little thing called ""Hurricane Sandy"", it hit my area and put us in a blackout for almost a month, during which, the pre-orders went up."
,milesrotaru,2013-02-24T05:43Z,"I missed the CDs by the way, and I'm not waiting. But I'll probably feel bad and donate toward their next project."

,lolcable,2013-04-04T11:45Z,Thanks for the Torrent Anon. I'm sad to hear that ZREO is ending but I fully respect their decision.
,DocMak,2013-04-06T01:04Z,Just heard about this project... looks pretty awesome. What a sad ending...
,coulter2,2013-04-25T05:24Z,Zreo is done
