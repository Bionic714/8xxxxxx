Okay..also..I must risk the wrath of the angry web because I'm looking for a Documentary ca. 2010 about a kid that dies or suicides in the U.S. and it was ALL the rage/talk and now I CANNOT find it..looked great..the crew visits the friends and family of this loner/skater kid and the piece looked quite beautiful and was proclaimed so..but the name escapes me..I've searched and searched..anyone? same year as ""monsters"" because I saw the preview along with that flick..anyway..thanks for this.."
