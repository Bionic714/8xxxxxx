plot:

Marty's (Colin Farrell) deadline on his latest screenplay has passed and as he struggles to find the inspiration to complete it, his girlfriend Kaya (Abbie Cornish) has reached the end of her patience. She's tired of his drinking, his laziness, and the fact that he spends his time with his friends instead of with her. 

His best friends Billy (Sam Rockwell) and Hans (Christopher Walken) come to his rescue with the best of intentions, but when Billy and Hans steal a gangster's beloved Shih Tzu for ransom, Marty finds himself regretting his involvement with them. The gangster, Charlie Costello (Woody Harrelson), is devoted to his dog and vows to kill whoever stole Bonny.
