,SAMSON4X,2013-01-21T08:16Z,Just started the seed again Smokey. For everyone else please stop grabbing and going. When I stopped seeding originally there were ten seeders now it is ZERO. Please keep seeding so we don't have this situation of people sitting there with half completed files and no one to download it from. We should be keeping music/musicians alive by keeping the seeding going.
