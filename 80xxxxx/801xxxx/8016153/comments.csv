EVERYONE is stuck at 88% for days because you dropped the ball and stopped seeding.

You ever want to get a skull, you have to do better than simply flood the section with new posts."

So instead of flooding my torrents with comments you better read it"
[H],LemonJ-Lo,2013-01-14T15:29Z,"Sorry, didn't see this comment, but no, I don't understand your attitude.

If someone asks you to seed a torrent that has died after only a couple of days, I think that the responsible thing for a poster to do is to put it back up long enough to finish.  BT shows that there are hundreds of people stuck at 88%.

What's the point of flooding new posts when people can't finish the ones that are only a couple of days old?  More than once, I've had to reseed your torrents for you so that others can finish because it has gotten stuck and I've had to find another copy elsewhere.  As a courtesy to others, I copy the new file over to your torrent so it can finish.

You aren't doing anyone a service, you're creating more unhappy people than you are helping.

If you've deleted the torrent, then please create a new, identical one, and I will copy the 88% I have over to that and continue seeding after I complete it."
,piyalsilva,2013-01-14T15:58Z,"Ok, it you feel  any difficulty with my torrents dont download them and if you dont understand my comment do whatever you want. I didnt ask you to seed my torrents for me. 

Also you said you find the same file from others and  put it there and seed for me. I doubt you really did it   cos won't work unless the file is identical in every aspect. You better upload it yourself and start seeding and we ll see how good you seed it and how well that torrent is going to perform. "
[H],LemonJ-Lo,2013-01-14T19:46Z,"""I doubt you really did it cos won't work unless the file is identical in every aspect.""

And that is exactly the case here.  Your post:

http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8006878/Natalia_Forrest__My_dream_man_VFacademy_2013_HD_XXX

got stuck at 87% after you stopped seeding.  I found this post:

http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8010874/Natalia_Forrest_-_My_dream_man__%28VFacademy%29

by Rothschild (whose posts *never* die, by the way), which contains exactly the same binary file.  I renamed your file to match his, rechecked it, then used his torrent to get the missing 13%.  

I then copied it back to your original file, and started your torrent again.  This let all the others who were left hanging complete your torrent.

I do this trick all the time to try to complete torrents that get stuck.  Unfortunately, it only works if someone else has posted the same binary file.  In the case of the post I have asked you to reseed, there isn't another post, and I haven't found it on usenet either."

And if you want to find lots of his dead torrents go to his torrent page and sort by seeders (SE) low to high"
