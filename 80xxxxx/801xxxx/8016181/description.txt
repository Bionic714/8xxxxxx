  Omi Khurana's London dream has just ended.    
  On the run from a dangerous UK gangster       
  who he owes money to, Omi returns to his      
  native village in Punjab, pretending to be a  
  well-heeled London lawyer. Much has changed   
  since Omi ran away from home a decade         
  back after stealing money from his doting     
  grandfather, Darji. The old man has since     
  become senile and most importantly, forgotten 
  the secret recipe of "Chicken Khurana" a      
  dish that made the Khurana dhaba  famous      
  across Punjab. Omi's childhood sweetheart,    
  Harman is soon to be married to his cousin,   
  Jeet, though neither seems too happy about it.
  Adding to the quirkiness of the Khurana family
  is a free loader uncle, Titu, who once did    
  a stint at a mental asylum. Will Omi be able to
  cover his deceit and lies for long, even as   
  he tries to recover the lost recipe of        
  Chicken Khurana - the family's only hope      
  to reclaim their pride & wealth.
