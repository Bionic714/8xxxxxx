Book Description
Publication Date: July 25, 2012
Thorium energy can help check CO2 and global warming, cut deadly air pollution, provide 
inexhaustible energy, and increase human prosperity. Our world is beset by global warming, 
pollution, resource conflicts, and energy poverty. Millions die from coal plant emissions. 
We war over mideast oil. Food supplies from sea and land are threatened. Developing nations' 
growth exacerbates the crises. Few nations will adopt carbon taxes or energy policies 
against their economic self-interests to reduce global CO2 emissions. Energy cheaper 
than coal will dissuade all nations from burning coal. Innovative thorium energy uses 
economic persuasion to end the pollution, to provide energy and prosperity to developing 
nations, and to create energy security for all people for all time. "This book presents 
a lucid explanation of the workings of thorium-based reactors. It is must reading for 
anyone interested in our energy future." Leon Cooper, Brown University physicist and 
1972 Nobel laureate for superconductivity "As our energy future is essential I can 
strongly recommend the book for everybody interested in this most significant topic." 
George Olah, 1994 Nobel laureate for carbon chemistry
