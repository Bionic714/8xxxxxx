Shank *FINAL* (Jimbus edition)
-----

Genre: 2D beat 'em up.
Developer: Klei Entertainment.
Co-op play: Local.
Year: 2010.


This edition contains the full game (nothing has been deleted) and patched to the last version (1.3 or 0.0.0.2).


Features of this non-Steam version:

  - Reduced installer (all in one file).
  - Updated with the last patch.
  - Cracked (just install and play).


Notice this is not an update but the full game. Do not install it over an existing installation.

This edition is virus free, but it includes a trainer, which may be detected as virus by some programs, though it would be a false possitive. If you do not believe me, just delete "bintrainer.exe" because it is not needed to play the game.

For those who might ask: Yes, this is the first Shank, not the sequel.
