 Omi Khurana's London dream has just ended. 
 On the run from a dangerous UK gangster    
 who he owes money to, Omi returns to his   
 native village in Punjab, pretending to be 
 well-heeled London lawyer. Much has changed
 since Omi ran away from home a decade      
 back after stealing money from his doting  
 grandfather, Darji. The old man has since  
 become senile and most importantly, forgott
 the secret recipe of "Chicken Khurana" a   
 dish that made the Khurana dhaba  famous   
 across Punjab. Omi's childhood sweetheart, 
 Harman is soon to be married to his cousin,
 Jeet, though neither seems too happy about 
 Adding to the quirkiness of the Khurana fam
 is a free loader uncle, Titu, who once did 
 a stint at a mental asylum. Will Omi be abl
 cover his deceit and lies for long, even as
 he tries to recover the lost recipe of     
 Chicken Khurana - the family's only hope   
 to reclaim their pride & wealth.
