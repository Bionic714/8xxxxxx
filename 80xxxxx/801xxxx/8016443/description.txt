Glamour Photography

Forget the 90ΓÇ▓s Glamour trend, because Sue is reinventing the category. Sue Bryce is the Australian Portrait Photographer of the year for 2011. She built a portrait business from zero to $25,000 per week as a single woman in her home garage.

In this special workshop Sue will teach you how she photographs women, how to bring more feminine posing into your work, her secrets for hair and makeup, and the powerful marketing techniques she's used to build her business. She wants to demonstrate how you can become not only a better photographer, but a better business person as well.
