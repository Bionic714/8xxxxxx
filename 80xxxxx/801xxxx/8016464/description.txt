The Jehovah's Witnesses - known by their fortnightly Watchtower magazine - is known internally as "The Truth". And it is express, rock-like, non-negotiable doctrine that they exclusively are in God's sights, they alone have guardianship and are charged with safekeeping and dispensation of accurate bible knowledge && understanding, and are sole inheritors of the earth's physical surface; pre, peri* and post Armageddon. In short, their religion is a haven, "a secure protection" and "the only place worth being" while everything and everyone else will permanently perish. 
They are currently living "in a spiritual paradise"*, in lieu of an actual physical, live forever 'para sempre, felicidad' one, priviledged only to them whereby they as God's marshalls will welcome back the dead among other duties. 'Lieu' french, 'place.'
