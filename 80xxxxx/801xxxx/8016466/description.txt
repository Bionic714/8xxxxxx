In this workshop you will learn to select your images in a fraction of the time, with better result and adjust your images in no time flat with greater consistency. In addition to teaching you the keys automating and speeding up your workflow with Lightroom 4, Jared Platt will also spend one full day on image adjustment techniques and other tips and tricks in Lightroom 4 and Photoshop CS6 and his favorite plugins. And finally, Jared Platt will take you through a self evaluative critique of your own portfolio and teach you how to look at your own photography with a much more critical eye.
