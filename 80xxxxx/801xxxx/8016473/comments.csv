,photog89,2013-01-18T05:45Z,All of my uploads had to be stopped as I'm travelling for a few more days. I am trying to upload the torrents 3 at a time as well. Hang in there though. As soon as I get back they will be uploading again!

Kept skipping and stuttering... rest of the files were fine. Faster to reencode than redownload the file. Thanks for the great upload, been after this for a while."
