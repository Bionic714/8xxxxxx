,AIVAS,2013-01-14T04:15Z,"Best guess is that this is S11E09. There's no official North American designation available for it but then this is the UK edit so who knows. There's supposedly 20 episodes (including specials) but I've only ever seen 8.

Sooooo.... assuming that S11E09 is correct the content matches the torrent title NOT the title in the description (which is probably a cut & paste error)."

,ClipperCigars,2013-01-24T01:52Z,"@ iPlunder. IMDB is total garbage and useless when it comes to TV shows. Rarely, if ever, does it get episode numbers right.

11x09 is correct.

,EthanBB,2013-04-17T17:56Z,"It is UK edit of S11E09 (Plane Boarding Bite the Bullet) .. I have no idea when will US version go out, it looks to me, this is kind of ""leak"" because of early airing (probably)"
