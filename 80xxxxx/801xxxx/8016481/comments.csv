I tried to upload to this category first, then a few of them kept saying it couldnt upload because something was wrong with the name. After I kept changing the name to no avail, I did some research. My research told me that when I got that error, it was because something in the file would be allowed to be uploaded to that category, which is why I had to upload it to the other category. Fix the system and I can upload things in the correct category"
