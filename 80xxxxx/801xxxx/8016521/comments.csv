,DaSqurlyOne,2013-03-21T02:08Z,"It takes forever to download. If you want to watch it this week, you might want to find a different one."
,DaSqurlyOne,2013-03-21T02:09Z,"OH my, sorry I forgot to thank you for the up. I will be downloading it all and uping to a ratio of at least 2. Waiting a week for Quality is worth it."
,jerzey83,2013-04-01T05:45Z,this torrent really sucks the only way it actually works is if i have to download a separate video program it wont work on windows media or windows media center
,Izlakd,2013-04-04T18:50Z,"jerzey83, it's just a Matroska format. Use VLC, it's not that hard. Or for that matter, you can use VLC to change .mkv files to mp4.
 Personally, I prefer .mkv."
,aL0k8r.,2013-04-28T21:13Z,"@jerzey83: that is extremely ignorant of you to say this torrent really sucks just because you don't know how to play the files... install mpc-hc or vlc player & you'll be able to play them no problem... & you might wanna do some research next time before making such an idiotic statement, thanks!"

,obliveron,2013-05-12T04:33Z,stfu rhodyvik. 1 your more than likely full of shit. 2 if not your stupid for using such a bitch ass isp. 3 welcome to the internet. ppl are always trying to stop others from downloading things for free. if you want to pirate things suck it up and let them do whatever they feel they need to do about it. Because they wont give up. but we wont either. as long as there is information there will be people giving it and getting it for free. so i guess 4 is if your legit then it sucks. but your the one person out of a million. casualty's of war bro. maybe you should have read your isp contract.
