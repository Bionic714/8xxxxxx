3)  High Tide of the Confederacy 
During 1862, Lincoln's military commanders were squabbling, his political popularity was waning, and the North seemed unable to exploit its industrial and numerical superiority. Then came 1863, when the South failed at Gettysburg and surrendered Vicksburg, a strategic Mississippi port. These two momentous events marked the turning point in the war.
