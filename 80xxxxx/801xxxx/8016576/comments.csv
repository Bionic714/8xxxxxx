,benwelker,2013-01-13T22:48Z,"Dear TvTeam,
You are one of my favorite uploaders on this site because not only do you upload the good shows promptly but they are in great quality. One thing that bothers me to no end however is when you reupload the same shit. Take this torrent for example. This episode of mythbusters aired originally about 3-4 weeks ago. Why upload it again? I'm sure if someone was looking for it, they could find the original you uploaded or a copy somebody else uploaded. There is really no need for you to upload something twice. It's a waste of time and I hate having to see if the shit you're uploading is something I've already seen or something that's actually new. ONLY UPLOAD NEW THINGS FOR THE LOVE OF GOD PLEASE!!!"
,mikeike65,2013-01-14T00:17Z,"@benwelker I have asked the same question. Either way, hes just spamming the TPB and trying to drive traffic to his shitty site. Furthermore, releasing this hours before an actual NEW episode is due to be released is also quite suspect.

Use the quality in the upper right and down vote this. Somone that does this does not deserve a green skull. "
,ferdowsi,2013-01-14T02:14Z,@benwelker I don't think this episode was available before.
,goodsatan,2013-01-14T03:51Z,I couldn't find this episode previously and I don't see it elsewhere on TPB when I did a search.
,digital69,2013-01-14T04:23Z,They may have repacked it...  sometimes they put out fast but it isn't the best size etc...
,-G-rad,2013-01-14T11:10Z,"It's a new episode:
-Which boarding plane method is the best
-Shooting with teeth (supposedly to fool a pathologist).
It's a PLUS from me :-)"
,13ip0lar,2013-01-14T11:45Z,"This was released before because I recall watching it. However as much as I'd love to rip TvTeam a new one because I think they are tools for the most part who don't seed their own torrents, this appeared on several log sites. So it's likely a scene issue not just a TvTeam issue."
,benwelker,2013-01-14T18:58Z,"Well as much as I sarcastically hate getting technical on everyone, this episode first aired on television on October 7th 2012. So even by my own admission, I was wrong as well. Turns out it wasn't 3-4 weeks ago, it was about 3-4 months ago. However it does say convert in the title. Is it possible that this episode is now a different religion er uh I mean format? Maybe now it's an mp4 or avi or mkv? Maybe that's why it's reuploaded but I promise this episode has been uploaded before. If you haven't seen it though, go ahead a download it. Since I've got no life, I'm usually checking TvTeam's torrents every half hour to see if something good has been uploaded and so when I see something that's old but just barely uploaded, I get a little upset. Sorry guys!"
,Hydra25,2013-01-14T22:42Z,"The October airing (and upload) was from Australian TV. This one is apparently from UK TV. As far as I can tell, this episode hasn't yet aired in the US.

So it will likely be re-ripped and re-uploaded again after the US airing. I, for one, am happy to have a choice in what to download, even if the episode already ""exists""."
,ClipperCigars,2013-01-24T02:48Z,"@ Hydra25, it's nice someone got it right. :)

@ Everyone else:
This is not the AU's mis-numbered SBS broadcast version. This is the correctly numbered UK version. Had anyone bothered to pay attention instead of bashing TvTeam, you would have noticed that ettv and sceneline also posted this on the same day. Why? Because it was a newly released encode in the scene that was never posted before. 

That none of you have the slightest idea what is happening in the scene is not TVTeam's fault nor any reason to bash them. All they do is relay scene releases to the public as they become available. 

You guys was a tip? Try using your internet access and browser to check out a scene release log site once in a while instead of for posting ignorant ungrateful bullshit. "
,Rorzzer,2013-01-29T16:00Z,No i dont care what you people say. This is NOT a new episode. regardless of where it just aired and when. People want the newest available episode regardless of where its from. Uploading this again as S11E09 is extremely MISLEADING and unnecessary.
,Apoc_69,2013-02-14T23:16Z,Or you guys can quit your bitching and rip it yourself!  Thanks tv team. You wont hear me crying about something that is free that you put some work into.
,Arkh01,2013-04-08T14:05Z,"Well, i don't care what everybody say. I've watched every mythbusters episode since S01E01, and i haven't seen this one.

So thanks TvTeam."
