[T],_SnakEye,2013-01-14T21:21Z,"how did you guys manage to make it work?
when I apply the patch (and it replaces the DLL file as expected) I am still asked for Serial number when launching AivlaSoft EFB DisplayUnit application.
is there something I am missing?"
,game_over_,2013-01-14T21:57Z,"SnakEye, try entering whatever number you want ;)"
,Taco92,2013-01-14T22:08Z,"Thank you very much, namco-nexgen!!"
,sososo93,2013-01-14T22:33Z,"@SnakEye 
you need login a registred with the trial mode for 30days i have a trial mode me and i have tested the patch for test for watch if he say then i am in trial mode with left day remaning and the conclusion he say nothing when launch the software because i am now on full licence !!
ps: sorry for my bad english:)"
[T],_SnakEye,2013-01-16T20:27Z,"sososo93, let me see if I got it right.
what you are saying is, I need to pick Trial Mode for 30 days, then run the Patch and basically the trail mode would never run out / remain indefinitely? "
,sososo93,2013-01-18T12:53Z,"@SnakEye  
yes with trial mode for 30 days it works for me the patch reset the trial mod but you need to launch patch always when you start the soft:)"
