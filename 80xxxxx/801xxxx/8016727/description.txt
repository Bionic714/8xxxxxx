Grinderman - So Long, Goodbye, Farewell

Nick Cave's other band has disbanded.  Alas, they failed to release any live material or a collection of rarities.  So, here are live performances of the two Grinderman albums in their entirety.  Most are from the Treacle & RAK sessions.  Others are from bootlegs, I'm afraid.  

Also, included are all the b-sides, outtakes and one-off songs.  There is no need to thank me, just SEED!
