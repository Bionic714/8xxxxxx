Rosolino or exactly what happened....a suicide pact?.....It's really not as interesting as the excellent music he made......the music is what matters most.....is it not?"
,froogAL,2013-01-14T00:29Z,I forgot to mention that the BASS on this album is overblown...boomy...flaccid...luckily there's no sign of the cheesy reverb which marred so many otherwise excellent albums from the '50s
,BinkMastering,2013-01-16T12:11Z,"thanks froogAL!  you're right, the bass is a bit boomy but easily overlooked.  Excellent recording and performance!  I have the album recorded in Toronto by Don Thompson with Sweet And Lovely, and Who Can I Turn To.  Frank certainly gets around the horn.  Thanks for the post.  Cheers."
