Frank Rosolino could have probably traded fours with bird.....his technique

with the trombone was that good....talent rivaled only by JJJohnson IMO



Particulars describing this "cult" album are included.



Track#3 ...Don't Take Your Love From Me....is "baroque" ie highly ornamented.. 

which is one of the more salient qualities of BEBOP, eh?





FYI: Frank tried to murder both of his sons before turning the gun on himself.


The history of this LP might have contributed to his emotional problems.


Don't let that infamy keep you from enjoying this amazing LP from 1958.
