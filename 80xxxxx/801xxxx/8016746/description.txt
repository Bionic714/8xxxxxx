VAMPIRE KNIGHT┬« BY HINO MATSURI [LANGUAGE: ENGLISH]

 ~ TORRENT BY CAPT_HOOKFTW ~

Despite this upload being of relative good quality, there is nothing better than having this Manga on your hands. Every sane human-being would prefer to get the originals, and that you can only get by buying it (as long as it is being sold). Sharing is not Piracy. Piracy is receiving money from what you do not own. The only thing that Pirate Bay has from Pirate, is the name (and some users...) P-D
