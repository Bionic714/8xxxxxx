Welcome back!!!. You made me an addict to your uploads, i really appreciate your work

Why did you change your lettering? where are {HD Micro}, those distinctive brackets? Those things made you unique!. Really happy you are back like Batman"
[T],KickAssTorrents,2013-01-15T02:59Z,"Hey Soletar, I still am but if Yify is prepared to supply half of India with FREE downloads good on him, because Im NOT"
,soletar,2013-01-15T18:31Z,"LOL... i got the great Kickass to reply. Thanks a lot for your work. I often sing your praises in comments on your old uploads. Welcome back, KING Kickass"
,onlyHD,2013-01-17T17:19Z,"@MrKickASS : First of all i really hate to write this comment. Kickass i am your fan and i respect you not just for your quality rips but also to your age. You may have any rival between you and YIFI even may be with other uploaders.
A 50+ wise man like you commenting about a country(india) without any proper reason is setting a bad example. It may also create bad image about you. And i am expecting a proper response from you soon. "
[T],KickAssTorrents,2013-01-18T20:10Z,"@onlyHD - First I have NO issues with any uploader. Secondly I do have  major issues with torrent sites, Making a lot of money out of us encoders. Thirdly its a known fact that India visits torrent sites more than any other country in the world, so as a country they download more but most cant seed as the bandwidth in many places of India is so slow.
Also remember I encode/upload and SEED. Many uploaders just upload a seeded torrent in their name so no encoding, no seeding and get lots of credit for doing nothing. ATITUDE Oh YESSSS "
,onlyHD,2013-01-19T16:34Z,"Hello KickAss..!!
              you are right about the fact of bandwidth here. my home plan is 750 bucks and you wouldn't believe my max dl/ul bandwidth is 60kpbs and it take hours to complete a single movie download. besides at this rate seeding is impossible for bunch of movies or it's a mere waste.
Inspite of all these issues, most of the best uploaders are also from india like StyLishSaLH, RiddlerA, MRShanku, sujaidr, ameet6233 etc. remember, i am not accusing you for anything, just saying that india is not the only country using torrent. hit and runners are also there from rest of the other countries. as i mentioned before, i am your big fan, for your classical movie uploads. and i am thanking you sincerely for that. BTW, i request you to do more classics as you did before.

                                               _ Best Regards."
