Automate and monitor your computer's functions with Intelligent
Shutdown, which takes Windows Task Manager to a new level. Using
it, you can schedule just about any task, including shutdown
reboot, and hibernate, run at a predetermined time, or on a
regular timetable. Intelligent Shutdown also monitors CPU
memory, and network usage. Also handy are Outlook-type reminders
with several time options for scheduled tasks. Though the
interface is a bit chaotic, it requires only a few keystrokes to
navigate, since all of the features have check boxes and
drop-down lists. We found stability a slight problem. The memory
function caused our test machines to slow to a crawl, but
despite that flaw, Intelligent Shutdown will work nicely for
intermediate to advanced users who strive for automation
