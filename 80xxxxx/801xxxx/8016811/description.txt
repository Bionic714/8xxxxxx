Simple chat conversation that started simply by me offering to help them with a free poster (simply cuz i started noticing really bad template posters advertising all these big names in the biz, to which they have no official ties to) just to give em a hand. Nothing more, no money was asked for it, wasn't looking for a job. Just trying to be descent to a nobody online just cuz i like to offer it to prove I'm human and capable of feelings. Sometimes tho, I should just stay away from them. Simply seeded here to shut them up. Period. Hes sent more than just this constantly simply cuz now he wants me to do the poster and I'm refusing him now. All because some facebooker got all completely bent out of shape cuz they can't send a picture online. (asked for their logo so it would stay their product, and apparently thats enough to set this page with 10,000 faked likes right into a bitch mode which I'm just not gonna bother anymore) Not even gonna link to your page. They can look it up.
