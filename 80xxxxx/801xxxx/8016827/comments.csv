,JW001,2013-01-14T19:23Z,"Thanks for making this available. The author seems to have a rather large axe to grind and does it with extreme prejudice. Nope, I've never had anything to do with Scientology, but this guy has issues."
,shamanist,2013-01-15T02:22Z,any chance you have goddard's book... a real classic...

,lhgaw2,2013-01-18T13:11Z,Fantastic book! Would recommend buying it to support sweeney. Anyone who screams in the face of tommy davies deserves a few quid haha

,maryxjane420,2013-01-30T23:40Z,"I'm about half way thru ""Going Clear"" and its amazing. As a long time resident of Clearwater, I like to know everything about the creeps all over my town. John Sweeney is so nice! He has answered my tweets and retweeted things I've sent him! THANK YOU FOR THIS!!!"
