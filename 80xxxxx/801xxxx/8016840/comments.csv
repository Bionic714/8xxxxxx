,powerman123,2013-01-18T00:24Z,"wrongfun, do episodes 154-166 have watermarks on them? On left corner top etc?"
,wrongfun1,2013-01-18T01:41Z,"at the beginning of each episodes logo of TV7 appears, but immediately disappears after a few seconds. There arent any permanent watermarks or something like that"
,powerman123,2013-01-18T01:48Z,k great :D. So no episodes have narutoget.com on left corner or something like that? :o
,wrongfun1,2013-01-18T21:55Z,"this video has no any signature like narutoget.com or other release group signature
download one episode and make sure"
,brarh,2013-01-20T04:16Z,Hey do you have episodes 1-53? If so could you please upload them or link me to where I can? I don't want to watch these before the others.
,wrongfun1,2013-01-20T13:48Z,"there arent episodes 1-53 of 720p quality
so I never did them
you can find them of 720x544 or 640x480 quality without problems on this tracker
i think i do not need to put out another release of the same quality"
,brarh,2013-01-20T19:08Z,I haven't been able to find episodes 1-53 with English Dub. The main kicker that makes me like these releases of yours is that they also have  Japanese audio. I could settle for a just English one if I could find one but I can't seem to find one.
,wrongfun1,2013-01-21T11:42Z,I have not episodes 1-53 with dual audio. sorry
,brarh,2013-01-21T19:20Z,Ohh well no problem. What about the movies and OVAs then? Do you have any of those with Dual Audio?
,wrongfun1,2013-01-21T22:13Z,"no. only the episodes that I have uploaded.
i know site where there are episodes 1-53 whith dual audio but that site is not in english and there registration is necessary in order to dowload.
and, above all,
there english audio is not in video-container, but as external files. if these conditions are satisfied you, give me your email and I'll send you link"
,luisakanewt,2013-01-28T05:15Z,Amazing download!!! But episode 152 the first 3 minutes the audio is in japanese...do you have any fix for this?
,wrongfun1,2013-01-28T16:57Z,no i havnt
,wrongfun1,2013-01-28T22:29Z,this video may contain short Japanese audio inserts instead of English audio because for them there was no similar English
,XxXUltraRuney5XxX,2013-02-03T03:06Z,hardly anyone is seeding!
