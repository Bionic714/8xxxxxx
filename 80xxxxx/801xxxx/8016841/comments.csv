,foulsala,2013-02-24T16:58Z,"Quality was good - A9 V9, thnx to the uploader! Movie was OK as i expected it to be! Storyline is intelligent and entertaining and acters were OK! I usually watch all the movies at film.kbc44.com because they have HD's but they didn't have this one so im happy to have piratebay :) Thank you once again uploader for this great share!"
