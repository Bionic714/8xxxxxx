,bluepen,2013-03-01T13:29Z,"I have this in hardcopy - I found it very useful for learning how to incorporate more quick & easy visuals in my note-taking. I'm a 'words' person, but have found that using visuals more helps my memory and comprehension - plus it's fun! The book gives you that little bit of help to start doodling even if you're someone who 'can't draw'. Well structured. Recommended. "
