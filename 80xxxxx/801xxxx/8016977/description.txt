// introduction

Once upon a time, the studio behind Toradora! and Shakugan no Shana created a fable-minded story full of fairy tale tomfoolery, attractive archetypes, allusions to allegories, parodies of paraΓÇªugh, enough alliteration! You get my driftΓÇª
Ryoko ┼îkami, the ΓÇ£wolfΓÇ¥ of our story, and her BFF Ringo, also known as Little Red Riding Hood, are members of Otogi BankΓÇöa high school club that helps classmates out of grim situations. One day, a meek young man proclaims his love to Ryoko, who does nothing but bite him in return. ΓÇ£YouΓÇÖre much too weak for me,ΓÇ¥ she huffs. So the boy joins Otogi Bank to prove he has the stuff to protect his belovedΓÇöeven if it means taking a blow to the head with a lead pipe. HeΓÇÖs no Prince Charming, but will Ryoko allow herself to have her own happily ever after?
