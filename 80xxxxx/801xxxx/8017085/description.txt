Within the next eight years, Valjean creates a new identity and life for himself as a wealthy factory owner and the mayor of Montreuil-sur-Mer. Fantine, one of the women who works for him, is a single mother who sends all her money to the people who care for her small daughter, Cosette. When the other workers find out she has an illegimate child, they demand her dismissal. 

Now on the street, Fantine turns to prostitution to make money to pay for Cosette. She's arrested but Valjean steps in and takes her to a hospital. Maltreated and malnourished, Fantine is on her deathbed. When Valjean promises to find Cosette and care for her, their lives change forever.
