Nearly all of the issues were written and scripted by the same two people (and those that weren't were done by the original artist with an assist by the original writer), they were clearly VERY familiar with Baum's original books. You get to see far more than just the characters from the 'Wizard of Oz' in these books, which was a huge plus for me.

Two other comments...

First, this is a darker, more intense world than the one in Baum's novels and the 'Wizard of Oz' movie. It's not an 'adult' story by any means, but it's doesn't have the same fanciful whimsy of those original books, either.

Lastly, and this is my only minor gripe about this book, the art does sometimes seem to change in quality from issue to issue, and sometimes page to page. I imagine this was probably just because Bill Bryan was working his ass off. They managed to released 44 issues in less than four years, which is a relatively outstanding number for a company the size of Caliber or Arrow during the comics glut of the 90s (where creator owned titles would sometimes be months late, or never show up at all). Regardless, once you get into the story, which is really easy to do, the art won't slow you down any. And it looks pretty solid most of the time, anyway."
