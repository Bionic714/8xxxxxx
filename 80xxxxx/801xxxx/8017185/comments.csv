[V],murphy78,2013-01-14T02:29Z,"Volume sersions... hahaha
I meant versions... 

no the xdelta was specific to the torrent it was included in.  If you read, though, you will notice that prowmc is included here."
[V],murphy78,2013-01-14T05:56Z,You are most welcome my oniony arkenstoney friend...
,TheMaskedVillan,2013-01-16T09:49Z,"Thank you my friend. You put a lot of work into this one. I have a legal serial number for the upgrade, so I may try that. I only want to install it in a virtual machine to test it out. I'm in no way ready to give up on Win 7."
,monlaki,2013-01-19T15:22Z,will this work with windows update?
,dsscottage,2013-01-19T18:22Z,I have a Win8 OEM product key. Can I use this file to do a clean legal installation with my product key?
,danwat1234,2013-01-24T04:49Z,"I upgraded from windows 7 64-bit, which was activated with daz, to windows 8 Pro (non-VL, no media center) 64-bit.
When asked to enter a product code in the installation process I pressed 'skip' or whatever the button was called.

When installation was done, I ran KMSnano 14. ""qemu-system-i386.exe"" has been using a whole core of my 3GHZ core 2 duo for about 20 minutes or so. Is it hacking something or has it crashed?
Maybe I should try KMSnano 15."
,danwat1234,2013-01-24T09:26Z,"Using KMSnano 15 along with temporarily disabling the Windows Firewall and disabling the Smart Screen Filter, it worked."
,Amigaland,2013-01-29T14:43Z,Thanks. Is there a way to make a bootable USB out of this? Seems difficult for dual-layer iso's.
