"The Outsider"

Mr. Gold finds an unwilling test subject to see 
if a spell he has concocted will allow him to 
cross the border of Storybrooke  without 
losing his memory  and go in search of his son, 
Bae; Belle stumbles upon a vengeful Hook in the 
Storybrooke harbor whose main goal is to 
eradicate Rumplestiltskin; and Mary Margaret and 
David go house hunting in search of a bigger 
place to live. Meanwhile, in the fairytale land 
that was, Belle meets Mulan as the two set out 
to slay a fearsome beast called the Yaoguai, who 
has been ravaging the land.
