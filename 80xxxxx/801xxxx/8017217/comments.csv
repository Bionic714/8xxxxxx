To anyone struggling, just download the sygic from previous page, install trial, download additional data and then replace with full. Much easier than this B.S. Thanks for the awesome App Pirate, works like a charm and I love those different voices."
,KaBaDaBrA,2013-01-15T15:23Z,"Just found this now :) Hope it works on my SatNav system.... I'll keep seeding too, fellow South African here!!! :)"
,KaBaDaBrA,2013-01-15T15:26Z,If I copy it onto an SD card for a car gps system (Windows CE) based to I just copy all the files onto the card and voila? The guys I got the device from said I can use either IGO 8 or Sygic.... need some advice :)
,chop007,2013-01-15T18:27Z,"Kabadabada, no I don't think it will work because android, i.e. Galaxy S2 in my case, the file structures and imaging formats are different. You would have to get files that are in the same size/format. This will only work on android, not on another O.S. I am not sure what you would have to change as I only know Android."
,chop007,2013-01-15T18:28Z,"Awesome the South Africans have arrived, lets milk this puppy."
,chop007,2013-01-22T19:04Z,"Thank you Scorpio for your effort, I really appreciate your awesome work. Especially in S.A where they charge us an arm and a leg and 3/4 of the population is below the poverty line. Great work, all good deeds are repaid."
