The two biggest pop-culture brands by the name of TLC join forces for an all-new docu-series with “Totally T-Boz” (working title), focusing on Tionne “T-Boz” Watkins as she returns to Los Angeles with the goal of re-booting her music career, this time as a single mother, and after surviving years of recoveryfrom a life-threatening brain tumor, which forced her to relearn how to walk and talk. Now, she’s coming out of the shadows and uprooting her comfy life in the suburbs of Atlanta for a return to the bright lights of Hollywood, with the support of her closest family and friends.
