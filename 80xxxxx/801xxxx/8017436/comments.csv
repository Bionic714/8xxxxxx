,Coltbear50,2013-02-02T14:50Z,"I followed the musical trails of ABBA members after the group broke up, and bought Agnetha's ""Wrap Your Arms Around Me"" and follow-up albums, as well as Frida's ""Something's Going On,"" but don't recall this album being readily available here in the U.S. when it was released, so thanks very much for this and your other (superb quality) releases from both artists!

They are all truly labors of love (from the artists, as well as you making these hard-to-find releases available), that still deserve a much wider audience here in the U.S.A. and everywhere.  Thanks again!"
