What is Adobe Muse? 

Adobe® Muse™ software enables designers to create HTML websites for desktop and mobile devices, without writing code. Design web-standard sites, like you design print layouts. Use familiar features, hundreds of web fonts, and built-in tools to add interactivity. Then, publish with the Adobe Business Catalyst® service and redeem site hosting support, or publish with any hosting provider.

NEW Mobile layout options - Create unique smartphone and tablet versions of your site by selecting a layout in the Plan mode. Control how your design will look on all brands of smartphone and tablet devices.

NEW Mobile content and style options - Make your site look just as amazing on mobile devices as it does on large desktop monitors. Freely design the smartphone and tablet layouts by controlling the content and style of each experience.

NEW Touch-enabled interactivity - Take advantage of mobile viewing by hyperlinking phone numbers to automatically dial when tapped or email addresses to open emails with the "To" address already filled in.

NEW Gesture-enabled widgets - Use Adobe Muse widgets in your mobile designs. Interactivity will automatically convert to touch gestures, such as finger scrolling or page swiping, without coding.
