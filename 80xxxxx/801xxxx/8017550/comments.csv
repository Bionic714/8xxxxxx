,Lonsman,2013-01-14T08:37Z,"Clearly dududus, you are not a THINKING person who does their own research and weighs all the facts. You are just another angry moron who wouldn't know his asshole if it bit of his dick. It's a shame, really. Like him or dislike him, get your facts straight. And maybe you should put up a punching bag in your basement!"

[T],pharmakate,2013-04-14T18:30Z,"Noam Chomsky does not support and has never supported Pol Pot. This has been an anti-Chomsky talking point for years, and has been repeatedly denied by Chomsky.

The false claim seems to derive from the fact that Chomsky dares to compare the lethal effects of Pol Pot's policies with those of the United States in Vietnam and other countries, and the U.S. does not come off looking very good. Obviously."
