"A Test Before Trying"

When Springfield Elementary is threatened 
with closure because of low standardized 
test scores, the fate of the school rests on 
one student who missed the test, and who 
must raise the average above the minimum 
threshold: Bart Simpson. Meanwhile, Homer 
finds a parking meter at a local dump, and 
starts deploying it around Springfield to 
fleece unwitting parkers of their quarters.

Evolve... or die.

Enjoy :)
