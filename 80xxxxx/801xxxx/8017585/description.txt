Review by Stephen Thomas Erlewine

The first single-disc Pink Floyd compilation to surface in 30 years -- the last being A Collection of Great Dance Songs, released as a stopgap between The Wall and The Final Cut -- A Foot in the Door: The Best of Pink Floyd has its share of idiosyncrasies, quirks evident right from the choice of the moody ΓÇ£Hey YouΓÇ¥ as the setΓÇÖs opener. ΓÇ£Hey YouΓÇ¥ might not be an ideal keynote song but it is certainly one of FloydΓÇÖs signature songs, something that canΓÇÖt be said of every one of the 16 songs here, the oddest choices being ΓÇ£The Happiest Days of Our LivesΓÇ¥ (used as an extended intro for ΓÇ£Another Brick in the Wall, Pt. 2ΓÇ¥) and ΓÇ£The Fletcher Memorial HomeΓÇ¥ (an album cut from the un-beloved The Final Cut). Apart from these tunes, A Foot in the Door serves up the expected -- five cuts from Dark Side of the Moon, three from Wish You Were Here, four from The Wall (of the big radio staples, ΓÇ£Run Like HellΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£Young LustΓÇ¥ are absent), adding the early Syd Barrett ΓÇ£See Emily PlayΓÇ¥ and the latter-day ΓÇ£High HopesΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£Learning to FlyΓÇ¥ almost as afterthoughts. Although the compilation could withstand some minor tweaks -- a post-Syd song like ΓÇ£One of These DaysΓÇ¥ would have been welcome, for instance -- this is still a very worthy compilation of (most of) the Floyd songs everybody knows by heart.
