                           DESCRiPTiON 

 UK tv show concerning archaeology/history.

 Tony Robinson explores the Dorset Ridgeway and investigate how the discovery of 
 burial grounds, henges that showcased unexplained rituals and a town built on 
 top of an Iron Age hill fort have made the area one of the richest 
 archaeological sites in the country. The team also explains how recent 
 scientific advances have helped shed light on Britain's prehistoric 
 civilisations.
