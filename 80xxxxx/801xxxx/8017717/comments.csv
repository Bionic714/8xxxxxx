,mmlol3,2013-01-15T01:46Z,Danimal - It's a shame you're even allowed to download. Just because you have a computer from the 80's and it takes you 15min to unrar 200 MB you don't have to complain. Sceneline always offers flawless torrents with great speed. Just shut up about rar already...

Danimal - you suck balls lol"
,Stefanovics,2013-01-15T13:19Z,"it's about 10 seconds to unrar, so it doesn't matter.
thanks for the upload"
