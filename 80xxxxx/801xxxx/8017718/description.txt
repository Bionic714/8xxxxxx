Ski Sunday returns with Graham Bell and Ed Leigh. The series will feature all the thrills and excitement of the men's and women's downhill tour, culminating in the World Championships in Schladming. Vancouver gold medallist Amy Williams also joins the team and looks ahead to some of the British hopefuls for medals at 2014's Winter Olympics in Sochi. This time the team is in St Anton for the women's downhill as they follow British No 1 skier Chemmy Alcott on her return from a career-threatening injury. Plus Ed Leigh presents a special feature from Alaska, the last frontier of snowboarding, where one of the greatest snowboarders on the planet, Travis Rice, is pushing the boundaries of the sport.
