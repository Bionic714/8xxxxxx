plot:

When a young Donny (Adam Sandler) hooked up with his hot teacher, he never thought he'd wind up becoming the single father to their son, Todd (Andy Samberg). Needless to say, Donny's parenting skills fell way short and Todd took off on his own as soon as he turned 18. When Donny learns that his only son is now making big bucks, he winds up on his fancy doorstep to reconnect. But Todd, who is about to get married, isn't quite as excited to see his father after all this time and struggles to keep his clean-cut world intact.
