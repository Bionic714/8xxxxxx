-HELP-

If you can't start the app with 64x (More than 1GB Ram available) try making an text file with the following:

java -cp -Xmx6144M -Xms3000M -jar FTB1.2.0.jar

The numbers after Xmx and Xms are the available Ram, try to make them suitable for your PC, THE XMS NEED TO BE almost THE HALF OF THE XMX.

Save the file as .bat and run it.
