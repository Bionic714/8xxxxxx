NOTES:
Cyndi Lauper's new reality show debuted on January 12, 2013. 
Two episodes aired that night, this is episode 2.


This cap of the show is at the best quality possible, at 1080p.  
There will probably be lower quality versions out there if 1080p isn't for you.

VERY SPECIAL thanks to Reb for the file. 

Season one will be 12 episodes. 


ENJOY!
