Introduction
This book is designed to help you teach yourself how to program with C++. No one can
learn a serious programming language in just three weeks, but each of the lessons in this
book has been designed so that you can read the entire lesson in just a few hours on a single day.
In just 21 days, youΓÇÖll learn about such fundamentals as managing input and output,
loops and arrays, object-oriented programming, templates, and creating C++
applicationsΓÇöall in well-structured and easy-to-follow lessons. Lessons provide sample
listingsΓÇöcomplete with sample output and an analysis of the codeΓÇöto illustrate the topics
of the day.
To help you become more proficient, each lesson ends with a set of common questions
and answers, a quiz, and exercises. You can check your progress by examining the quiz
and exercise answers provided in Appendix D, ΓÇ£Answers.ΓÇ¥
