I am going to try this because getting it all working under Linux is difficult.

I have been trying to get hold of linuxcoin-v0.2.1b.iso from www.linuxcoin.co.uk but the site has gone.

I have a Debian Wheezy setup using an ATI 5450 running the latest AMD stuff for Linux but I can't get cgminer to find my card even though the computer detects it and has OpenCL."
