,Heromist,2013-01-14T07:43Z,did you get this torrent from some where else or did you get it from mine. Everyone is a fucking retard...
,Templayer,2013-01-14T10:19Z,"@Heromist
You are the only retard around here.

Your torrent is impossible to download, I downloaded for more than two days I believe, and I was stuck at 0%. More than 20 people were stuck at 0.1 %, as far as I could see in utorrent.

Go to you mommy, child. Also, this guy is a skull. That means TRUSTED. 
Calling everyone a  retard just because nobody can get your .iso (cd/dvd image archive, no idea why you used that) and thinking somebody copied your shitty torrent is just demented. "

@Heromist .i."
,mwalsher,2013-01-14T23:56Z,"> did you get this torrent from some where else or did you get it from mine. Everyone is a fucking retard...

Um, @Heromist, your upload is a dead .iso file that nobody can download (check your torrent client; I would be surprised if it reports ANY transfer from your end).

That Heromist ’s upload reports 100+ seeds when it seems that nobody can download it seems pretty suspicious."
,Heromist,2013-01-15T00:55Z,"My torrent for some reason wasnt seeding. Some people told me they got it and it worked fine. When they did, they said the audio and video were both fine.

And you can use Iso for compression too you dumbass.

also, i took the torrent down anyhow. 
thats why its not seeding.

I was thinking maybe someone got it and converted it and made it work for the dumbasses who couldnt figure it out cause they are retarded.
I can open an ISO like a zip file, i dont know why you cant.
Get winrar."

I usually watch all the movies at film.raeshashop.com because they have HD's but they didn't have this one so im happy to have piratebay :) Good torrent quality - A9 V9,"
