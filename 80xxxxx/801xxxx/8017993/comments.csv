[V],LeonardTSpock,2013-01-14T05:20Z,"Dorothy is a comic book created by Greg Mannino and Mark Masterson and published by Illusive Arts Entertainment, LLC. Dorothy is based on the Wizard of Oz books, originally by L. Frank Baum. The series was published erratically for 4 years before ending on a cliffhanger. The official website for the series is inactive.

Dorothy is different from many other comics because it is not drawn, but rather, actress/model Catie Fisher is photographed on a green screen and the world is digitally created around her. This style of comic which is illustrated with photographs is known as Fumetti or ""photo comics"".

In 2006, Dorothy was added to the Oz Museum in Wamego, Kansas."
