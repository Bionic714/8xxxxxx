NOTE: If the Market fails to download the app, log on to your Google Checkout account, Cancel the order and try again.
NOTE: It seems on Android 2.3 audio is now recorded in large chunks causing a delay, thus not allowing DroidCam to stream and play-back smoothly. As of now, nothing can be done about this
You can check which version of Android your phone is running by going to Settings -&gt; About Phone.
