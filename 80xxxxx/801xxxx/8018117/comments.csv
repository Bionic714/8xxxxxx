,megoesmo0,2013-01-14T11:39Z,Thanks for this one. Really appreciate it!
,.Leto.,2013-01-14T14:02Z,"I typed my comment saying that this was ""really hilarious"" during the first bit that the 2 hosts, Tina Fey and Amy Polher, did at the beginning. That was really funny indeed, they really are great hosts, but the rest was your typical awards show. Nice event though, specially the Jodie Foster's speech."
