It's a practice that has been going on for generations - hand-fishing for giant flathead catfish. There's no rod, reel or bait - just two hands and a whole lot of guts. It's a cult and a culture, the disappearing remnants of a dangerous tradition that has played out on American rivers since the 1800s, man versus nature at its elemental best. ""MUDCATS"", premiering Thursday, February 9, 10pm ET/PT follows the men who compete with each other in an effort to showcase the best ""mudcatters"" in Oklahoma - ""hands down""! Deep in the heart of this historic state lives an adventurous group of people, who have chosen to hand-fish as their passion - these men have learned the ways of from their fathers and grandfathers, and who have every intention of passing the tradition down to their sons and daughters and grandchildren. The drive to be the best runs deep.
