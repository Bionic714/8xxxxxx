Ep 11: This Donkey Kicks
 Things go awry when Kenya feels she's worth more of a cut than Phaedra is willing to offer her for the Donkey Booty video.
 PREMIERE: Sunday January 13, 8 pm

Phaedra and Apollo are eager to begin working on their Donkey Booty video, but things go awry when Kenya feels she's worth more of a cut than Phaedra is willing to offer. As NeNe takes up residence in Hollywood, she struggles with how to focus on her acting and leave the home details to Gregg. Kandi celebrates Todd's birthday with a huge surprise party, but she goes on the defensive when Kenya interferes with Todd's celebration by bringing up her business beef with Phaedra.

A huge thank you to all the original cappers and posters
