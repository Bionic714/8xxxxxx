,res19,2013-01-14T07:06Z,low resolution video is for the birds. this is 2013 m8.
,Kalebz,2013-01-14T07:08Z,"Do not trust ETTV. Torrented what AVG believes to be a virus and then slept with my sister.

Fucking idiot i hate you"
,Robert237,2013-01-14T07:09Z,@mpenn20 it is an hour long HDTV rip 
,mpenn20,2013-01-14T07:16Z,"and i just meant compared to other ~1hour long shows, ones that end up only being around 350mb. Also, thanks for the upload ettv, great quality as always."
,bord123,2013-01-14T07:17Z,Its a large file cuz its a 60min show
,spc.sykd,2013-01-14T07:17Z,"ettv > all

enough said."
,ap2882,2013-01-14T07:24Z,"Hour long shows with commericals ~42 mins ~350MB

Hour long shows without commercials ~ 400-500MB

It's still oversized."
,mpenn20,2013-01-14T07:57Z,"Ok I get it. My only question was that an upload from ettv from tonight (Revenge S02E11 HDTV XviD-AFG[ettv]) for example, is 350mb for about 45 minutes of video. By that math, a 60 minute rip would only be about 460-470mb. It's not a big deal, I was just wondering. Not complaining about quality as I know ettv is the best and quickest."
,Elropo,2013-01-14T08:17Z,"agreed, it is very large for a 50 minute HDTV tv show"
,res19,2013-01-14T09:00Z,"Why is better quality an issue? I don't understand the problem. I guess if you're watching this on a laptop, resolution wouldn't matter. If you use a flatscreen TV, however, you're cheating yourself by not downloading the hi-res version. Get more storage.. its not that expensive."
,bran2k,2013-01-14T09:35Z,"Thanks for all you work and effort on this show and the hundreds of other episodes of other shows I have dl from you. Ignore the haters, and keep up the good work please."
,kleine23,2013-01-15T01:44Z,is there a difference between this uploaded episode and the other season 3 episode 1 uploaded by ETTV? just want to make sure im getting the right episode.
