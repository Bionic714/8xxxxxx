NOTE:  Those were pred in a real mess by several tv-cap groups.
       We used the episode order from the links above.

NOTE: I suggest downloading VLC Media Player to watch this release.  You can download it here:
	  
http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html

A few important and simple keyboard shortcuts for VLC are:

Double click: Fullscreen
Spacebar: Play/Pause
V key: Enable/Disable/Change Subtitles.
G/H key: Subtitle Delay (-50ms/+50ms each tap)
J/K key: Audio Delay (-50ms/+50ms each tap)

NOTE: I do not have constant Internet access, so this upload may take a couple of days.  Please be patient!

NOTE: I am in the process of uploading all the recent DVDRips that are not on TPB.  Considering I do not have fast upload speeds, nor do I have constant Internet access, AND there are pretty much unlimited DVDRips/BDRips to uplad, this will take a super long time.  However, let me know if you have a request, and I will see what I can do.

Enjoy; please rate, comment, and seed!
