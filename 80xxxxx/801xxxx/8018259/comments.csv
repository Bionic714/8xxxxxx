[V],psspss,2013-01-14T08:00Z,"hmm looks like the mp4 this time has produced a slight out of sync of 100ms or 200ms

I will add a new one"
[V],psspss,2013-01-14T08:52Z,this is no longer seeded.. grab the fixed copy instead
[T],trialNerror,2013-01-14T15:04Z,"i LOVE how everything that goes wrong is never your fault. lololol
the mp4 didn't produce the out of sync...
your whatever method of encoding does.
i just tried a couple different progs to convert to avi to see if there is anything going on with the mp4 since you've been bitching about mp4 from day one.
hmmm, nope, no problems.
they converted to avi just fine and were in perfect a/v synch just like the mp4.
so, me thinks you should ditch whatever crapware you've been trying to use but keep getting problems with and you try something more reputable like MeGUI.  -thumbsup-"
[V],psspss,2013-01-15T00:31Z,"havent you heard theres bugs in all software

its written by faulty humans

so if theres a bug in your soft and causes a minor audio annon and theres a bug in my converter that amps it.. then it shows up

thats life

there does seem a audio clich at the very beginning not sure how or why it ecists but adjustment I made in sync revealed itself"
[V],psspss,2013-01-15T00:34Z,when audio is no constant in sources thats when i find audio issues vbr for audio is lame hardly saves much data no in mp3 anyhow
[V],psspss,2013-01-15T00:41Z,"i never said it was your source in error anyhow

but I mut admit i never have issues with dhd evolve killers sources for sync but I suspect its cos they use more data and less compression as they bigger much bigger then yours

not complaining though.. small is good

just saying theres some error occurs with the converters with different compressions

ftps sources are worse for sync problems
even their own mp4s are often out fo sync 
maybe after a ad break later and a couple of others
tend to have issues always so pays to check

I didnt noticed on bigfoot cos of the weird accents
in the intro and didnt check randomly liek i always do.. when you dont you get caught out hehe :)"
[V],psspss,2013-01-15T13:39Z,"sorry for the typos.. eyes been foggy today

but not bu, and not for no etc..

seems I had a issue with the t key on lappy"
