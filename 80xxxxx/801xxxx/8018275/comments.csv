,Oneiromancer12,2013-02-02T21:42Z,"Mr. Spock, do you know who could upload JM de Matteis' Dr. Fate or Ostrander's The Spectre?

It would be much appreciated, I know you don't do superheroes, but maybe you know someone.

Thanks!"

,znev,2013-02-23T18:54Z,"Hi, dear mr LeonardTSpock !
Thanks for your amazing work, both in uploading and restoration. It's been great to find 'Eclipse Magazine' and 'Somerset Holmes' thanks to you.
Anyway, I'm still looking for the complete run of the Eclipse 'Ms Tree' serie : I found one torrent with missing issues, and there's only one complete torrent, but with no seed. Could you please do something, or do you know where I could find that great stuff ?
Peace and love for you!"

So, is there any chance for you to upload the rest of Anne Rice's comics like-
The Vampire Companion,
The Witching Hour,
Interview with the Vampire : Claudia's Story

and also my last request -
Neil Gaiman's Neverwhere.
