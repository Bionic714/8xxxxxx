Real Stories of the Highway Patrol (Sometimes referred to as RSHP) is a half hour syndicated television series which ran in the United States for six seasons from 1993 to 1999 for a total of 780 episodes, capitalizing on the success of "real-life" police series such as COPS. Reruns were aired on the now-defunct Fox Reality Channel.

The series revolved around the stories of highway patrol officers and state troopers from across the country, who would give commentary on a particularly difficult arrest they made. More often than not, the officer's work caused him grievous injury and a subsequent commendation from his police department. Each crime and subsequent arrest was dramatized for the viewing audience. Unlike COPS, not all of the footage in the show is COPS similar camera recorded.

The series was hosted by Maury Hannigan, who at the time was Commissioner of the California Highway Patrol.

As you can see its not a full pack of them. Just the ones I've found so far, and they are VHS rips.
