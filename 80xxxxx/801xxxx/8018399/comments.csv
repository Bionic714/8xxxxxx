Read, see the pics @ http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Lost-Highway-Blu-ray/15410/#Review
My copy is practically identical with the BD.
Go ahead and make snap shots of the same frames as the pics posted on there then compare them."

That's French BD though so slightly different transfer.
My source (hdclub bd) is US transfer.
Besides this is BDRip 720p 4.2 GB for God's sake whining twat. Download a 1080p 10 GB and you'll have the same quality."
