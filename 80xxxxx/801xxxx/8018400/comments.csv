,Egy_Wrath,2013-01-19T22:19Z,"in the description it say 1920*800

so how its a 1082p then ?!!!"
,Wormyz,2013-01-21T19:14Z,"YIFY, I'd just like to tell you how grateful and thankful I am to you for all your downloads!!!  :)"
,iiProcs,2013-02-01T06:09Z,"@Egy_Wrath

because the film is 2.4:1 and not 16:9. I would rather dedicate the bitrate the to film and not black bars hence why they are cropped off leaving you with a 1920x800 image. Saying this is 1080p is perfectly okay."
,Drim009,2013-02-14T05:53Z,Wow movie . Very good quality considered the relative small file size . However i'd rather had a bigger file with even better quality ;)
,firexninja,2013-02-16T06:09Z,thank you!
