thanks blackcanary!"
[V],blackcanary,2013-01-14T14:52Z,That's good to know.  Thanks STFmaryville!
,Canadia99,2013-01-14T23:19Z,I've been looking for the Perez JLA issues FOREVER!!! Do you have any more? Thanks for posting!!!!
,CeraKesh,2013-01-15T02:09Z,"There may be more coming from the Perez run, but probably not anytime soon.  This marks the introduction of the New Gods/Darkseid into the mainstream DC Universe outside their own books/Jimmy Olsen"

[V],STFmaryville,2013-01-15T22:37Z,"Canadia99, you can find old (but readable) scans of the entire original JLofA series in this torrent:

If you need a list, Wikipedia says Perez worked on 184–86, 192–97, 200.
And you may want JLA/Avengers by Perez & Busiek:
