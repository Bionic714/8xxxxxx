4)  Zambezi River of Life 
The wild water of Africa's Zambezi river spills over Victoria Falls. The local people fully aware of its awesome power dubbed it 'Mosi-oa-Tunya' or 'the Smoke that Thunders'. With a width of 1 mile and a height of 360ft, the Victoria Falls forms the largest sheet of falling water in the world. In the height of the wet season, columns of spray can be seen from 30 miles away, as 546 million cubic meters of water per minute plummet over the edge. The Zambezi is traversed several times by one of the world's most epic natural events: the wildebeest migration.
