I, Jonathan Welton, care more about truth than about money. My heart is to empower others and release the truth that sets people free.

That is why I have provided my latest manuscript free of charge. Most likely you have not heard the contents of this material anywhere. Not because I am presenting something fringe, but because I am speaking biblically and historically, not in the trend of popular culture.

I am taking great personal risk to stand up for the truth that will set people free. It would be much easier to continue traveling and speaking popular messages about the prophetic seer realm, but the Lord has directed me to take a stand in this arena. Although the hate mail from the close-minded is piling up in my inbox, I have heard from so many more voices of encouragement as peopleΓÇÖs lives are being dramatically impacted by this book. I challenge you to give it a fair chance.
