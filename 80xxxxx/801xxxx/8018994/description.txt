Lockpicking has become a popular topic with many in the security community. While many have chosen to learn the fine art of opening locks without keys, few people explore the fascinating methods of attack that are possible WITH keys. Keys to the Kingdom addresses the topics of impressioning, master key escalation, skeleton keys, and bumping attacks that go well beyond any treatment of these topics in the authors previous book, Practical Lock Picking.

This material is all new and focuses on locks currently in use as well as ones that have recently emerged on the market. Hackers and pen testers or persons tasked with defending their infrastructure and property from invasion will find these techniques uniquely valuable. As with Deviant Ollams previous book, Practical Lock Picking,  Keys to the Kingdom includes full-color versions of all diagrams and photographs. Check out the companion website which includes instructional videos that provide readers with a full-on training seminar from the author.
