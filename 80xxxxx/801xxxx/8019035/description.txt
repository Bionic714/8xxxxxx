------------------------------

FRONTLINE travels to Alaska to probe the fault lines of a growing battle between those who depend on the Bristol Bay region of southwest Alaska, home to the last great wild Sockeye salmon fishery in the world for a living, the mining companies who are pushing to extract enormous amounts of mineral deposits, estimated to be worth some $300 billion, and the political framework that will ultimately decide the outcome.
