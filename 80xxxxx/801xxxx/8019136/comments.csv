Colin Murray presents highlights of today's Premier League fixtures, which were Manchester United v Liverpool at Old Trafford and Arsenal v Manchester City at the Emirates Stadium. The Red Devils were looking to do the double over their great rivals having claimed a 2-1 win at Anfield earlier in the campaign, while the Gunners were seeking to improve upon their home form in this campaign by emulating their 1-0 victory of last season over the Citizens. Plus, a look back at all the goals and talking points from yesterday's matches  thanks"
