The game itself will work fine, but shortcuts will not be created.

I apologize for this mess-up. I have identified and fixed the problem. It won't happen again in any of my future releases. "

,Cerebral222,2013-01-16T12:57Z,"Thanks for this esharoth, I didn't even know it existed. I think this is better than Mysterious Journey II, because it's not as hard, which makes the adventure side of it more enjoyable; nice upload, +1 from me, cheers."

i seed all torrents for life.

and i give special precedence to torrents that have less seeds. a torrent like this would be given my full bandwidth in the rare occasion of someone connecting and trying to obtain it.

if more people did this, data would never die."
