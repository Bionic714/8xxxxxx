Those of you still having problems with registration, due to a previous installation of the software. Follow these instructions:-

1. Start Menu
2. Run
3. Type in Regedit & hit return
4. Select HKEY_USERS
5. Press Ctrl + f (Search)
6. Search for {C06F4056-C35F-4bf8-A93A-9F098F3E503D}
7. Delete the Key, including the subkeys.

Xilisoft added a hidden registry key that wont allow you to add any more keys after the first key gets blocked. The above is the workaround.

Worked for me after I was also hit with registration after using an earlier version for a while. I downloaded this one only to hit a spot of bother.

Now, go forth & spread the word !!!!!"
