So I choose to install windows on my main hard drive it all installs perfectly until the green progress bar reaches about 90% of the completing installation stage. then I get a message pop up saying ""windows could not configure one or more system components. To install windows, restart the computer and then restart the installation. I hve tried installing again but same error always. Please help me I just cleared my old windows 7 hoping for a fresh installation and now I can't do anything and I'm writing this from my iPhone."
[V],2010kaiser,2013-01-15T14:01Z,"@Packedcash

It could be one of a number of reasons.

1) Are you booting off a disk or USB.
2)try writing the .ISO to disk at the slowest speed possible or if your using a USB to boot off. Write it to the USB again.

3) When your trying to install and you get to the window where you select the drive to put Windows 7 onto:

1) Highlight the drive in the window and select 'Drive options'.
2) Then select 'Format'.
3) then select 'Delete'.
4) Then select 'New'.
5) Then select 'Apply'.
6) Then select 'Install'."

This .ISO of windows is pre-activated. You don't need to do any activation post install as the activation is doing during the actual install.

If you remove the $OEM$ folder the .ISO will no longer be activated during install as it contains the Loader, and command script etc.

Should you decide, and i can't see why you would, to remove the $OEM$ folder. You can activate this copy of Windows 7, post install with DAZ Loader. You can download it from the link below:

[V],2010kaiser,2013-01-21T17:49Z,Forgot to mention also. If you remove the $OEM$ folder it will no longer be branded either.
,AnsarA,2013-01-21T18:57Z,"Thanks for replying uploader...

But why the previous ISO was of 4.9 GB and this is 500 MB less...

Whats missing and whats added???"

and now this one (updated one) which is 4.4 GB...

and after this another upload on 15 January

[V],2010kaiser,2013-01-22T13:38Z,"@AnsarA

The 1st .ISO at the link below Is Windows 7 Ultimate x86(32bit) + 64bit. It has SP1 'Slip Streamed' into it. It's also branded and per-activated. On this one though, all updates are in separate SFX files for each architecture. The reason for this is to give the downloader the choice of what to install and download.

http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8024587/Windows_7_Ultimate_32bit_64bit_SP1_Updates_Activated_Branded

The 2nd .ISO Is Windows 7 ALL Editions x86(32bit) + 64bit. SP1 is 'slip Streamed' into both architectures but it's not branded and there are no updates either 'Slip Streamed' or provided seperately.

If your unsure of any other .ISO's i've uploaded of Windows 7. Just read the torrent description and you'll see that there a variations in the content which explains the disparity in torrent size.

,led_zeppelin_2009,2013-01-23T09:20Z,"Dear Kaiser. I would like to express my gratitude & appreciation towards you for your dedication & contribution of providing impeccable services to PirateBay and all its members over the years.
However, I was wondering if it could be possible for you to create Windows 7(32/64) Bit along with few necessary Softwares included & most importantly drivers. Although the main concern would be the size that it would overall take. Please can you make Bootable Windows 7 but it should be less than 4.4 GB in size since it would facilitate most of us otherwise it is difficult to burn in DVD. By the way my name is also KAISER :) Thanks beforehand"
[V],2010kaiser,2013-01-23T12:06Z,"@led_zeppelin_2009

I could make that Windows 7 .ISO but it would be difficult if not impossible to keep it under 4.7GB.

Even if i made a Windows 7 'LITE' by removing a lot of Windows components, the addition of drivers, updates etc significantly increases the overall size of the finished .ISO.

What i'd suggest is to buy a cheap 8GB USB and copy whichever Windows 7 download you require onto that and install Windows directly off the USB rather than a dual layer DVD.

WinUSB Maker from JOSH CELL does this transfer to USB flawlessly and can be downloaded from the link below:

I already did this but still nothing changed.
1) Are you booting off a disk or USB.
2)try writing the .ISO to disk at the slowest speed possible or if your using a USB to boot off. Write it to the USB again.

3) When your trying to install and you get to the window where you select the drive to put Windows 7 onto:

1) Highlight the drive in the window and select 'Drive options'.
2) Then select 'Format'.
3) then select 'Delete'.
4) Then select 'New'.

6) Then select 'Install'. """

[V],2010kaiser,2013-02-06T22:44Z,"@will_gore

The torrent is an .ISO. Not a bootable .ISO.  That's a common misconception. You need to make the .ISO ""bootable"". It doesn't come pre-made as bootable.
