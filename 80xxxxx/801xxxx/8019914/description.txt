Smart Editor
After you finish a sentence with punctuation, Smart Editor examines words in your sentence and determines if another previously suggested word makes more sense. Words are underlined within the text field to prompt you to tap on them and select the word we think is more likely. We look forward to hearing what you think of Smart Editor!

Living Language
We've updated Living Language to include functionality whereby relevant and trending words are crowd-sourced and made available to Swype Beta users who opt-in to the service. Users who do not opt-in upon installation of Swype Beta will not contribute to nor be affected by Living Language words.
