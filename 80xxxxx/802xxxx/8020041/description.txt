The band was founded by Trollg and Kj in 2009. It consists of close friends who have also been playing music together in the past. On June 2009 we released a 3 track EP called "That of the Swamp" that was met very well by audience and critics alike. Since then , we have been composing material for our next release and performing on local live gigs.
