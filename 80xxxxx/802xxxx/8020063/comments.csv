There is nothing to do!
This is a quest guide addon, it has nothing to do with your account.

You ROCK! I know its pathetic, but my gameplay satisfaction depends on you..."

Then, bind ""interact with target"" to a key, as well as make a macro that targets the target of your focus target (the focus target should always be your main). This will save you a headache."
,tfdanielxd,2013-01-16T19:28Z,"OK thanks for the response. Im not multiboxing or anything, its just that I thought there was a setting that the guide took into account your 3X exp and automatically adjusted the quests and stuff."
,tfdanielxd,2013-01-16T19:30Z,"On Zygors website its called the Smart Injection System. I was just wondering if this version had it. Great addon either way, thanks for the upload!"
