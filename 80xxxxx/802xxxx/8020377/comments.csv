[T],pharmakate,2013-01-15T01:24Z,Could someone who completes this download please confirm that it's legit?
,hit_shead,2013-01-15T02:40Z,Please don't put in an archive. I'd like to see the contents before downloading. Thanks.
,kyouki85,2013-01-15T03:05Z,"Sorry, it's easier for me that way. It's hard to keep track of folders on my computer *^.^ And yes it's legit. I'm not much for ruining other people's computers. I'm too White Hat for that."
,kyouki85,2013-01-15T13:41Z,Quality up if you like this please!
[T],pharmakate,2013-01-17T05:19Z,Not a single seed yet??
,phibes,2013-01-22T03:13Z,Stuck at 69.4%. Anyone get the whole thing yet?
,dia1961,2013-01-28T19:54Z,"Well, kyouki85, any chance you could seed this for a couple of weeks?
Once we downloaders have a complete copy, we can seed."
,dia1961,2013-01-28T20:06Z,"Thanks for the effort, but: How about breaking this into 3 archives? Like others, I've been stuck at 69.4 percent for more than a week, and though I can sort-of open the zip file, only one file on which I have clicked, has opened. If there were three smaller files, chances are more people would be able to download."
,xymbxxxya,2013-02-28T16:25Z,stuck at 69.5% please seed
,mercurochrome,2013-03-04T22:48Z,"69.5%, Still! Has anyone got a complete copy?"
