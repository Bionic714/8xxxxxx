This is a massive "motherload" of Origami books. I got the Origami Motherload 1 and 2 before the links finally expired and now am sharing them here for everyone to have for a long time to come. If I'm missing anything or if I downloaded your upload and didn't give you credit, don't hesitate to contact me.

Unzip and use! You'll need Adobe Reader, preferably 7.0 or above and a .djvu reader.
