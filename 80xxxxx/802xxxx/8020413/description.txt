RUST Vol. 2 - Secrets of the Cell

Picking up where the previous volume, Rust: Visitor in the Field, left off, after a second robot attack on the Taylor farm, Roman, Oswald, and Jet begin to seek answers to the mysteries of the past. Oswald becomes more and more suspicious of Jets connection to the robots, while Jet himself tries to connect with the flesh and blood family that has harbored him. Roman looks for comfort in his friendship with girl next door Jesse, but what he doesnΓÇÖt know is that a new evil may be looming on the horizon for his family. Will they be ready when it comes?
