Next time, you might wanna read the torrent description before posting.

,Audiovore,2013-01-15T04:20Z,"You might want to put a list/link of the changes in the bloody description next time, so people can decide before downloading. Instead of getting haughty for no reason."
,chiverito,2013-01-15T05:13Z,"i think your purposal is very good, but i think you removed many things, because the movie is half the length of the original cut, but i support entirely your project of getting all the trilogy into one 3 or 4 hour video.

sorry about my english"
,chiverito,2013-01-15T05:20Z,"very interesting, i'll be waiting the hd version of this."
,sissor,2013-01-15T13:18Z,why would anyone watch this?
,Audiovore,2013-01-16T02:30Z,"I like the ideas of this edit. But the cuts and transitions come off abrupt, and the pacing feels wrong.

If you're looking for a good book edit, wait for an HD source and someone at FanEdit.org to do one."
