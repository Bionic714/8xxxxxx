,adam0s84,2013-01-16T21:00Z,"It looks like the current version is for some reason still called ""2011"" there has however been an update and this version no longer works unless you block it in your firewall. Otherwise it will just pop up a bubble that says ""HDD Regenerator is Outdated!"" and not let you do anything. the newer version has a new realtime monitor and better handling of drives being scanned while connected via usb."
