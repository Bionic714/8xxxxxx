,E_E_Fan,2013-01-15T16:35Z,"I've been looking forward to this album since I devoured their last, ""Man Alive"" (which I highly, highly recommend). I preordered this as soon as it was available. Sadly I live in the US and shipping is taking way too long. Please, download this but consider buying their CD or at least digital download. They are a really nice and talented bunch and I'm excited for what next from them. Tell you friends about Everything Everything."
