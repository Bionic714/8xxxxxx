DLCs and CFW hacks for PS3 aren't exactly my forte. I can look into it, but don't expect an upload of them anytime soon.

Have you tried looking for them at PS3Repack? They have a lot of PS3 DLCs there.

You can also try making a request on the SuprBay forums. You'll be able to reach out to more people."
