You have quite a music collection. I noticed that you had uploaded James Gang Rides Again back in August. It has to be one of my all time favorite rock albums of the ""70's"". There wasn't a song on that album that I didn't like. I would really like to get it in FLAC format, but it seems to be dead right now. It shows 4 seeders here at TPB but my bittorrent client shows 0. If you find some time to seed it again, I would gladly seed it for a week to try to get it going again. I'll leave the torrent in my client for a few days and see what happens. Thanks for sharing.

other year or so I'll blow the dust off of it.

I check all of my uploads now and then and seed them for patient music lovers.  My rig's antique.

The older uploads are uncompressed .wav   ,,,,
 .flac is simply compressed .wav ,, same fidelity
but wasted memory space with .wav...THX Baron!"
