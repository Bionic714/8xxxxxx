Johannes Brahms (1833-1897) was the master of "thick" choral works.

His REQUIEM remains one of the greatest, best loved choral works ever...

and often considered to be his masterpiece.


This (DDD) Telarc recording of the Atlanta Symphony and Chorus (USA)

from 1988 includes 4 of Brahms well known choral works.


The Schicksalslied (Song of Destiny) gives me chills, or as I used to 

call them, "musical orgasms."  I got tired of trying to explain that

to people so I filed it away next to "Cliches."


These "old" Telarcs are well engineered.....truly HI-FI
