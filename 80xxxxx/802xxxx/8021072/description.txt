The Middle Beat EP is my 3rd official release as Ronin E-Ville and contains 4 tracks of funky, jazzy, and dubby downtempo electronica. This is all my original work, though artists like Thievery Corporation, Bonobo, DJ Krush, Kruder and Dorfmeister, DJ Shadow, King Tubby, Scientist, and Lee Scratch Perry influence me.

As a producer, I always prioritize sound quality and production values, while as a DJ, I always dish out the beats; on this release IΓÇÖve also brought a renewed focus on instrumental melody to an eclectic blend of acid jazz, dub, and trip hop.

Thanks for checking out my music! Please seed, promote, and share! 

Cheers,

Ronin E-Ville
