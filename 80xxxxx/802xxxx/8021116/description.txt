Ripped from a DVD with 0% loss.

20 subtitles -- I know some of them aren's listed, and I probably listed a few that aren't there. Check out the LOG file to get more technical info.

In the original DVD there were lots of soundtracks with dubbed sound. If you prefer the voice of your local B-actor over Robin Williams and Robert deNiro, this is not something for you.
