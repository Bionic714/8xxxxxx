Uncut is an indie band from Toronto, and they enjoy playing loudly. Both of their albums have received pretty decent reviews from pitchfork; why are they are so 'under the radar' is a mystery to me. They have a new one finished, but the release date is not yet set.

This torrent includes both of their studio albums at 256k MP3. I personally have purchased both of their albums, and when they start touring again, I'm going to go out and support them.

Fight for your indie bands!
