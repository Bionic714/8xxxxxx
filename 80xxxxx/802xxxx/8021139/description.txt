Ubisoft has marketed Far Cry 2 as the true sequel to Far Cry, however the sequel has very few noticeable similarities to the original game. Instead, it features completely new characters and setting, as well as a new style of gameplay that allows the player greater freedom to explore different African landscapes such as deserts, jungles, and savannas. The game takes place in a modern-day Central African nation in a state of anarchy and civil war. The player takes control of a mercenary on a lengthy journey to locate and assassinate "The Jackal," a notorious gun runner. As of January 23, 2009, the game has sold 2.9 million copies.

IF YOU SHOULD RUN INTO ISSUES:

Problem lies with your machine, either you are missing net framework 2.0 or higher, missing directx newest version, or missing newer drivers for your gear. I've tested this on 3 of my own PC's with seperate configs, all ran perfectly.
