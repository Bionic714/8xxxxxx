Grow up.
Grow a brain.
Learn critical thinking. 
Question authority.
Question everything.
The world and the universe are far more amazing and wondrous than that one ancient book will tell you. 
Seek the truth of reality. It's far more impressive than this tripe.

I know, I know, you're gonna tell me I'm free to leave. I know I am. I'm also free to post rebuttals to your drivel and will continue to do so whenever it suits me.
Have an amazing day :-)  "
