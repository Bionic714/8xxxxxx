Learn blues soloing techniques with Neville Marten. This excellent DVD will get you improvising like the professionals. The blues greats don't think technically, so to teach blues in too technical a fashion tends to miss the point. This DVD will show how, by using and embellishing basic fingerboard patterns with string bending, finger vibrato and other essential skills, you can quickly start to become a more musical sounding blues player.

Start hearing the blues and learn to be able to solo fluently and creatively Â­ and sound more like your heroes than you ever thought possible! 

Also includes three blues play along tracks.

Enjoy!
