Movies : Comedy : TV Rip : English, 87mins
This is a redo of my torrent to reduce file size, new format mkv.

Please Note: this film has an 'ET contrast fog' which affects facial shots at distance, close-ups not bad. It does affect Leo's & Huntz scene to the point of almost not being able to see the face, Huntz more than Leo. You will recognize the voices.

Leo Gorcey's final film shortly before his passing on.
 
The PHYNX ... in all its' horror, complete, milk & cookies to anyone who can watch this in one pass. Cameos at the end & the overall complete horror of fimlmaking will keep you entertained or sleeping.
