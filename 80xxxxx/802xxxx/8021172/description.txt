7-Zip Compression:
=================
7-Zip is an advanced compression format featured in PowerArchiver. It is an open source format, providing an open architecture and high compression ratio. 7-Zip outperforms ZIP, ACE and even RAR in many tests. However, 7-ZipΓÇÖs greatest strength is that it is not controlled by any organization or individual, but by an open source LGPL project to which anyone can contribute. More information on 7-Zip and its superior compression can be found at 7-Zip.org.
PowerArchiver also features a Transparent Update feature for 7-Zip archives, which allows you to quickly add or remove files even if the archive is ΓÇ£SolidΓÇ¥. PowerArchiver supports all 7zip methods, including LZMA2.

Superior RAR extraction:
======================
Our engineers have spent months of development time to custom tune extraction of RAR archives. End result is that we now have the fastest RAR extraction engine on the market, which extracts up to 10% faster than everyone else, including WinRar 4.x!

=======================================================
PowerArchive features innovative Queue System. This is the first time such an option is available in compression utility, and it enables you to better organize your compression, extraction and backups, as well as schedule multiple jobs to be done sequentially without slowing down your system ΓÇô as multiple compressions would do if run all at once. Another first for PowerArchiver.
