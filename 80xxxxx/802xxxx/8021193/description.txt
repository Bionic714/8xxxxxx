POtHS - Victory Over Sin and Evil Vol 15 - Army of The Lord


POtHS says: Here's how you beat Satan at his own Game.

Description:Army Of the Lord by Walter J Veith:
In 1 Chronicles 11, God gave David's mighty men great victory over their enemies. They slayed hundreds in the name of the Lord. Study these mighty men that made up the Lord's army, and glean lessons for the battles you are facing in your own life.

In this sermon, Walter Veith dissects 1 Chronicles 11, plumbing the depths of the typology in these verses. Be reminded that Christ will conquer the oppositionΓÇöincluding the sin that lives in each of us.

The Door Was Shut  For Every Truth - Philip Sizemore:
The parable of the ten virgins in Matthew 25 gives us a picture of what will happen just prior to Christ's Second Coming -- some people will try to get into heaven, but the door of probation will shut because they did not obey the truth they professed to believe. Join Pastor Philip Sizemore as he analyzes the symbolism of this parable and its urgent message to all people today. (38 minutes)

Prayer was of vital personal importance for Tozer. "His preaching as well as his writings were but extensions of his prayer life," comments his biographer, James L. Snyder, in the book, In Pursuit of God: The Life Of A.W. Tozer. "He had the ability to make his listeners face themselves in the light of what God was saying to them," writes Snyder.

JESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.

Born of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.
