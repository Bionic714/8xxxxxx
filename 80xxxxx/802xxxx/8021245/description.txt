Instead, we live in homes, apartments, or condos with small rooms and even smaller closets. But you can enjoy an organized, beauty-filled life no matter what the size of your space. In this practical book, readers will learn how to

-make the most of existing storage space and find clever ways to add more

-find creative ways to arrange furnishings and accessories that maximize space and bring harmony and style to the home
