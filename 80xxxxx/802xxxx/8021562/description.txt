Summary: "I am Alice. Do let me hear a story."

Here and there - in the space between buildings, in back alleys, perhaps even in the underground - the Forest bleeds into our world. The Forest is a forbidden place where the rules of our world do not apply. Our heroes must struggle against the Forest, without so much as the hope of assistance or understanding from the outside world. They do battle against the "riddles" the Forest imposes upon them with the aid of superhuman abilities known as "gifts." And should they know defeat in their battle against the Forest, they will face that which they fear most - expulsion from Shinjuku.
