I wonder what is wrong with release groups nowadays... The whole point of 720p is the quality. They start and keep decreasing the bit rate and there soon will be no difference between this and the xvid encoded HDTV ones...

~756mb for a 720p release is just sad, it should be cataloged as m720p not 720p. It looks like crap in larger monitors and in TVs its a joke. They should just put out two releases, one for people with 10"" monitors and poor internet speed with crappy bitrate, and the regular 720p with ~1.5 gb filesize. Back to capturing my own thing i guess.

It's a 22 minute show.... Not an hour long show! 750 MB for 22 minutes is sure big enough!"

What are you talking about? That is a fantastic quality copy! 

resolution: 1280x720
video codec: H264, MPEG-4 AVC
video bitrate: 1809 kb/s
audio channels: 3F2R/LFE
audio bitrate: 448kb/s
audio sample rate: 48000 Hz

What's the matter with you?!"

pxgs is right! 
1280 by 720 small in comparison to people TVs or monitors, also it used to be 1 gig for 30 min shows and 3-4 gigs for hour long shows "
,misuchiru03,2013-02-06T07:51Z,"Guys, I use a 56"" LED TV and I see no problem whatsoever with the quality of this.  This is normally how I get them.  What we SHOULD be complaining about is the 1GB file for a 1080p BR rip of a 2 hour movie... THAT is not right."
