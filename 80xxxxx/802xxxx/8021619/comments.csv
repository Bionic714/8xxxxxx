,tasoz,2013-01-27T12:41Z,"Really bad rip, the framerate is wrong making the movie feel like it lags even though it shouldnt. 1.8GB movie lag but 40GB bd raw works fine? nah dont think so. Redo it if you want something decent. THe quality is way to low for justify the 1.8GB size too.
However the download speed was decent, not good just decent.

If the file was 500MB or smaller and was a instant download then perhaps it would be worth it if your on a computer from the 80's but no, this was just utter crap.

V/A = -1, crap.

Sorry man, try again but this was utterly awful, downloaded a new one, smaller, much faster that had none of these issues."
