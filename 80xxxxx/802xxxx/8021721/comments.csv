,jhhyde,2013-01-15T06:30Z,Thank you for this upload.  I live in an area that does not have a high def PBS station so I appreciate your efforts.  I hope you will consider the next two episodes of this program.  And if you have any of the Nature series that would be greatly appreciated also.  Thanks again.
