It is stilted in its acting and execution, forced in its delivery and a strange cross between ""That 70's  show"" (albiet using the 1980 instead), ""The Vampire Diaries"" (minus the supernatural) any other teenage angst TV show you can think of. BORING, not funny or even very good for nostaligia purposes for any old enou to remember the 1980's. Not worth the bandwidth  or disk space in my opinion. I watched it deleted it immediately, and will NOT be downloading/watching any more episodes"

,impala63rag,2013-01-25T11:04Z,"I LOVE IT!!! I watched every episode of ""Sex and the City"" consecutively (as I have almost every series of every genre) shortly after it was canceled, and thirsted for more. The movies were great, but I had hoped they would eventually start the series over fresh with new characters. This is so much better. To be able to reconnect with Carrie as she was in her youth. I actually lost a few tears at witnessing her introduction into fashion, writing, and a love affair with Manhattan. I thought it was great that even in her first relationship, she handled a difficult situation with that tough/cool composure she has. "
