Notes ..........: Like many cable shows the runtime of each 
                  episode varies. In this case from 44min to 58mins.
                  We decided to go for 550mb for the whole set for 
                  consistency and also cause the shorter eps didn't
                  compress well enough for a 350mb size.

NOTE: I suggest downloading VLC Media Player to watch this release.  You can download it here:

A few important and simple keyboard shortcuts for VLC are:

Double click: Fullscreen
Spacebar: Play/Pause
V key: Enable/Disable/Change Language of Subtitles.
G/H key: Subtitle Delay (-50ms/+50ms each tap)
J/K key: Audio Delay (-50ms/+50ms each tap)

NOTE: English subtitles are on by default; simply tap the V key 5 times in VLC to disable them or delete the Subtitles folder.

NOTE: Three samples are included as well as the 12 NFO files.

NOTE: I do not have constant Internet access, so this upload may take a few days.  Please be patient!

NOTE: I am in the process of uploading all the recent BDRIPS/DVDRips of popular TV shows that are not on TPB.  Considering I do not have fast upload speeds, nor do I have constant Internet access, AND there are pretty much unlimited DVDRips/BDRips to upload, this will take a super long time.  However, let me know if you have a request, and I will see what I can do.

Enjoy; please rate, comment, and seed!
