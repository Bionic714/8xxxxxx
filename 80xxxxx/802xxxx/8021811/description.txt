The documentary details the slow decline of Shenyang's industrial
Tiexi district, an area that was once a vibrant example of China's
socialist economy. 

With the move towards other industries, however, the factories of
Tiexi have all begun to be closed down, and with them, much of the
district's worker-based infrastructure and social constructs.
