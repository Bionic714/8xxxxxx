,CosmAvngr,2013-01-15T18:30Z,"Keep these mSD releases coming. 

They are the best size/quality compromise (I have tried nearly all of them).

You should really make these your specialty. I mean why re-release EZTV releases. EZTV shows up in the same list with the same torrent with 4000 seeds. 

But mSD are hard to find, and they are great."
