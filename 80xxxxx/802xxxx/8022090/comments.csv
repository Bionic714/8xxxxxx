How to install large (4GB+) PKG files:

1. copy .pkg onto a NTFS USB stick or HDD and plug into PS3

2. in multiman, click "" toggle FAT32 / NTFS "" under PFS DRIVER (on left menu next to settings)

3. click File Manager / mmOS

4. find the .pkg on the NTFS drive

5. double-click it (press X twice)

6. it will copy the pkg and exit to XMB where it is ready to be installed (in a bubble)

7. install from XMB as usual

8. profit!


so forget about FTP and splitting files.. this way is the quickest and ridiculously simple! "
