In a strange new dimension, many unexpected encounters guide Willow on the quest to return magic to her world. While she's increasingly better at keeping her darkest self at bay, her mystery companion Marrak encourages darkness, making Willow wary of his intentions while dependent on his knowledge of this magically abundant realm. Just how far down the path of volatile magic will she go to get what she wants? And whom might she find there?
