,ehsank4ta23ta0,2013-01-16T22:59Z,why don't u upload both the 720p quality 2-3 days later? isn't it possible to upload them at the same time or at least upload the 720p first?
[T],mf-den,2013-01-17T06:02Z,"720p is coming. Well, we only do 720p encodes from Web-Dl source as I mentioned in my notes as they tend to have a much better quality than the normal HDTV ones. So whenever the web-dl comes out, we re-encode it and post it. Thats why the 480p HDTV comes out first and then 720p web-dl. Only this time there has been a slight delay in the upload, otherwise we post the 720p as soon as we get a hold of the original web-dl source."
