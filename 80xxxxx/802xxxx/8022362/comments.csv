,Fox_Trot,2013-01-16T06:25Z,Why has not a single person commented about the quality/review of the file? 5000+ seeders and a trusted source and no one cares to comment....what gives?

,Rabotlhoko,2013-01-18T10:11Z,"I have to say when I started to download here,I downloaded YIFY ....I take nothing away from the team...since they can give you 10/10 picture quility.....My advise is ,when you watchin all your movies on your PC ...Team YIFY would the 1 for you ....but if you gonna use you 40-65 inch Samsung LED,LCD or plamsa TV screen with 5.1-7.2 sound system your good sound system wont be that useful  .... YIFY Team is tops,but they provide 2.1 stereo sound .Should they improve thier sound quality ...they will be able to challenge the big boys like BOXZ-SAM etc..... Anyway Goodwork YIFY."

,electrond,2013-01-21T14:58Z,Thanks for the upload. But insane lame movie! Worst movie ever. 
,15shells,2013-01-21T15:42Z,"Stupid people don't get this film, and have to let you know,  because they're confused fools. Grasping blindly for confirmation that it's just bad and makes no sense, they'd tell you it's stupid. They got it backwards. This is a good, thought-provoking, violent, ALLEGORICAL, crime film. It's about money, force, and economy.  AGAIN: if you're dumb, just be a good little lamb and go grab ""Seven Psychopaths"" or some other stylish piece of shit."

,sorsxrc35,2013-02-24T06:24Z,the movie is pretty bad? it's because you are brainwashed in the head.....
,kirce2002,2013-03-11T18:52Z,"Thnx to the uploader! Movie was OK as i expected it to be! I usually watch all the movies at film.maswagg.com because they have HD's but they didn't have this one so im happy to have piratebay :) Good torrent quality - A9 V9,"
,Rah407,2013-03-28T04:09Z,This movie is whatever.... a 'meh fest' at best. Great quality video and audio though.
,mr_romano,2013-03-30T13:50Z,"Absolutely agree with Rabotlhoko. If you watch your torrent file from YIFY on your big screen, sound is terrible. You need to have volume almost on max to actualy hear what they talking about, but rest of the sound is too loud. Very hard to watch. So u end up reading subtitles. PLEASE MAKE THE SOUND BETTER!!!"
,SoFaKiNg42,2013-03-31T11:07Z,1920*800 is not 1080p. I would just like to remind everyone. I don't understand how no copies are above 800p
,keba1968,2013-04-08T11:54Z,"@SoFaKiNg42 It's 1080p because the missing 880 lines are in the black bars at the top and bottom of the screen, due to widescreen format not being 16:9. Now you understand."
,keba1968,2013-04-12T13:13Z,"My mistake, of course I meant the missing 280 lines (140 above and 140 below the visible picture)."
,JDFS22,2013-04-15T18:46Z,"@Woesaka

Shut the fuck up bitch, first no one gives a flying fuck about your opinion on the movie, secondly if you really think this is the worst movie ever... I am proud to announce you deeply retarded."
,pfl723,2013-04-20T05:40Z,"Great Download, Thanks!"
