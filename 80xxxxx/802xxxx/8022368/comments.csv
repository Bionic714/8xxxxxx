,Dr.Caplan,2013-01-15T07:27Z,lol nice work
,MuppetStrangler,2013-01-15T07:31Z,Haha dude you jumped the gun!!! XD
,atndigcrk,2013-01-15T08:18Z,"lol...wow 20 uploads quickly bound to happen 
yify is the back bone to this site!"
,Afzal8920,2013-01-15T15:44Z,rename it
,tyl3rdurd3n,2013-01-15T16:00Z,"@atndigcrk: Umm... sorry, but he is by no means 'the back-bone to this site.' He isn't a 'releaser'. All that he does is downloads what others release, compresses and re-uploads (without giving credit to the people he owes his rip to, of course). Anyone can compress video - doesn't take any special skill."

""Anyone can compress video - doesn't take any special skill. ""

Talking out of your arse.... you cannot compress a video to the quality Yify can. Yes once you have the settings and all the correct software yeah you can, but takes tonnes of time. Not like your dumb 200 gig friends upload. Yify would have uploaded it for 25 gigs (or less) and would have looked 95% as good. Not everyone can download huge files, yes I appreciate large quality. But Yify provides great quality for size. Me thinks you jealous or something. "
,Nimh,2013-01-15T17:08Z,"@ Tyler: 

Yeah but he does and gets praise for it, It's in convenient size and decent/good quality.  (for the average user - not the purist with a 60+tv.) 


Seriously thats why he's popular, alot of people dont want a file 3 times as large with basically the same quality. 

My internet connection has only mildly improved upon from when i cable back in early 2000.   2gigs is large enough. "
,tyl3rdurd3n,2013-01-15T19:19Z,"@Dyna-C4-mite: ""you cannot compress a video to the quality Yify can."" There are other uploaders doing a far better job uploading these 'economical' rips than YIFY is. There's no reason to be jealous of YIFY. I was just saying he's not the 'back-bone'. He's not contributing new content just sorta recycling what other put out and he's not even alone at doing it so it's not that he's irreplaceable, like it's being suggested."
,tyl3rdurd3n,2013-01-15T19:30Z,And the Friends upload was never meant for people like you. It's for people that don't compromise over quality and can tell the difference b/w a good rip and an overly compressed one.
,Nimh,2013-01-16T06:07Z,"@Tylerdurden,

Can you tell us who else are good, in terms of real 'bang for buck' efficient compression?

There should be some protocols uploaders stick to, that makes this process of selection much better.  

I feel i care about quality. To my friends and family that don't download, you know, majority of the public,  Yify downloads are perfect.

,joven_embate,2013-01-17T04:34Z,"yeah, only Yify can upload good quality movies on a smaller size, nobody else does, before you post bad comments, thanks yify first, because we know you make downloads of their movies too,"
,fuckyou143,2013-01-17T06:15Z,"""backbone"" LOL"
,FureeTutawk,2013-01-31T04:31Z,"@tyl3rdurd3n
Maybe your jealousy would be better directed to caring about the needs of your downloaders, and providing them with a choice to accommodate their hardware needs and internet connections instead of the massive 2,4, even 10, 15GB torrents I'm finding lately for a single movie.

Thanks, yify, however it's done, you make sure the masses can eat cake, too"
