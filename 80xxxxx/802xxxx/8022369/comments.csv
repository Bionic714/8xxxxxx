,t.i.j.,2013-03-05T17:38Z,"Thnx to the uploader! Movie was OK as i expected it to be! Storyline is intelligent and entertaining and acters were OK! I usually watch all the movies at film.greyfade.net because they have HD's but they didn't have this one so im happy to have piratebay :) Good torrent quality - A9 V9,"
,solomong,2013-04-26T00:59Z,"Not complaining, just pointing out something. Wikipedia points out there is an 'after credits"" footage. At the end of the movie it says there is an ""Extended Version"". Question: Was the after credits footage shown in the theaters or not?"
