Do u think i need the Marvel UK generation 1 too , which ran for 332 issues , heard its all reprint of Marvel US G1."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-01-15T13:17Z,"christmas_cake, the Marvel UK series was certainly not all reprints. It was published more frequently and had a lot of original content -- some bad, some good and some great stories.

One alternative to reading through them all is that IDW in recent years published 6 ""Best of the U.K."" miniseries: City of Fear, Dinobots, Prey, Space Pirates, Target: 2006 and Time Wars. Currently they are reprinting all the U.K. stories in trade paperback as ""Transformers Classics UK"" -- volume 3 of the 8-volume (planned) set came out recently, volume 4 is due out this Spring.

Hope this info helps!"
