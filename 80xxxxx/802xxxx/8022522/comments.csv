,ectoendomezo,2013-01-16T00:22Z,"Thanks for this..

Can you do ""Los Olvidados"" (The Young And The Damned"" (1950)?

Or ""A Prophet"" (2009)?

Always ""More"" eh what?

Thanks though.."
,gldnarm66,2013-01-16T01:14Z,Nice! Can you download more controversial and twisted movies like this??
,onlyHD,2013-01-17T17:24Z,you are a controversial king..!! you wouldn't believe me but i was about to request this one.thanks for sharing.. :)
,onlyHD,2013-01-17T17:29Z,then one more thing if the audio source is mono then additional track might not be required which enables to improve the video bit rate. not complaining just suggesting...:)
,onlyHD,2013-01-17T20:51Z,"@vNa5h :WTF is wrong with you guys. if you don't like the quality then download the source, rip the movies to your own taste and upload them, don't be a dumb troll. help to improvise rather than criticise."
