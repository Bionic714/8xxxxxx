,AlexGreat,2013-01-30T01:55Z,"This doesn't work for me. Win 7 Pro, 64 bit. .NET 4.0 installed. Program opens, click on ""Patch"", error message: ""Patching failed"
,AlexGreat,2013-01-30T01:57Z,"""Patching Failed, target executable does not match expected MD5""
""Trying to load mandroid.exe""

... and it just hangs there. I ran it with admin privileges, in the folder where mandroid.exe is, and in a random folder. Any ideas?"
,Xtse,2013-01-30T06:50Z,"4.5.55 is out, maybe it's already updated it for you - either way I'm going to patch and upload the patcher for that shortly. Keep an eye out. :)"
