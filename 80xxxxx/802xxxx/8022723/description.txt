Kyle visits Yolanda's gorgeous estate and shares that her issues with Kim have not been resolved, despite Kim going to rehab. Kim admits the same thing to her life coach, who advises she talk to Kyle. Kim takes that opportunity when the ladies and husbands all meet for dinner at a Moroccan restaurant. But bigger news is revealed by Brandi: Adrienne and Paul are threatening to sue her based on things she's said in the past. The debate about Brandi's intentions erupts into a full-fledged fight, with Ken and Mauricio at odds, and Brandi telling Mauricio to "f--- off."
