ODD HUGO is a band whose imagination comes across as warm and inspiring. It is manifested intrinsicly in the vocal and stringful textures of Rando Kruus and Oliver Vare and set in the landscapes created by the drums of Kaarlo Nõmmsalu, coloured delicately with the trumpet of Aigor Post and the trombone of Henri Aruküla. It stands independent and ingenious.

OH is an Estonian band and was formed in August 2012 by frontmen Rando and Oliver. "These Grey Fields" EP is OH-s debut release - just to give a taste of sounds before recording a full album in February - March 2013
