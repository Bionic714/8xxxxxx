the intended purpose of these comments sections is more intended to be related to the integrity of the torrent & files within than any one mans opinion of the value of the content.. IMDB would be a more appropriate place for that.."

,canapple,2013-02-26T00:37Z,"it is a good film. after premiering at festivals in 2011, the film was named the best undistributed film of the year by the indiewire and village voice polls, and placed 12th in a similar poll conducted by Film Comment. thanks for this.

and fuckoff @arnold111. no one fuckin asked you to watch this film. what the fuck is an 'unnecessary torrent?' and who the fuck are you? just a leecher. you've never upped a thing, so be thankful to others."
