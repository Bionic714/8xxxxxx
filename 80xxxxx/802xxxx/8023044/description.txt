Move wrapper to desktop

Double click the wrapper --&gt; install windows software --&gt; navigate to the DVD or gamersgate file --&gt; install the game --&gt; set the start file as main .exe file --&gt; run the game

Altough the gamersgate version works out of the box, For dvd version you might need a No-CD patch*. Get it from gamecopyworldand replace in the game folder the original file with the No-CD patch one.

Run the game!

Enjoy!

*When using a no-cd patch make sure you own the game and after patching keep it for yourself only.
