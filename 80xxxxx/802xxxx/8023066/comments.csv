- TPB have trouble with the servers and many downtimes
- I can download the torrent file and seed it nicely from my seedbox 

It's very easy. Just make an account, tell to a mod or admin who you are (from TPB) and they'll appoint you as uploader. After you creat the torrent for TPB add the same torrent file to publichd and that's all. 

Cheers!"
