-=== Plot ===-

A maniacal multiplayer game from the makers of Bayonetta and Vanquish, Anarchy Reigns allows players to unleash an attack arsenal in heavy-hitting solo and multiplayer combat. Set in the post-apocalyptic future, this is an over-the-top close combat fighting game, set in a open and fantastical world. Pick from an imaginative mix of human and cyborg characters and set out on a multiplayer challenge where anarchy reigns, or enter the arena in a twisty single-player experience as Jack or Leo and let the viscera fly.
