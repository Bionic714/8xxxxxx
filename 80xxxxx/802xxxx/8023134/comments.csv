,micnor14,2013-01-22T07:39Z,"Thank you condor369, keep em comin. 

BTW: to the at least 5000 people that DL'ed this before me, (except MoviesR101) - why no comments? Not even a thanks? 

I think TPB would do pretty damn well if it used the ehentai system for content like bounties and credits, attained by seeding much like H@H does...hell they even have torrents over there too. "
,onleej,2013-01-22T10:52Z,Thanks  for the movie. I'll seed till I reach 5.0 ratio.

Enough F words in the first 10 minutes to hear for a life time. Bad acting, poor camera shooting. All around pretty lame movie.  Could have been a lot better without all the fake gangster, fake cop, labor worker language. But this is what Hollywood has come to."
,MFINN23,2013-02-04T09:03Z,"I would value your opinion if your top complaint wasn't that they swore too much juju lol.  ""Labor worker language""?  Wtf is wrong with you?"
,juju83,2013-02-04T22:53Z,"Only uneducated filth would no understand what I meant, so Im not worried at all.

Only the ghetto, uneducated, filthy moronic trash speak the way they do in this movie because they are too stupid to say anything other than the work fuck.

Im sure you enjoyed it."
,thxsomuch,2013-02-05T17:59Z,this is a great movie!
,spunkster,2013-02-09T22:25Z,"Boohoo, somebody alert the media, somebody said a no-no word. 

Juju, have you ever seen a Scorcese or Tarantino film in your life? Get off your high horse, you self-righteous, indignant, buffoon.  This is how cops talk.

This film was lauded by critics and won 2 awards. David Ayer also penned and produced the Academy Award-winning Training Day. Jake Gyllenhaal was nominated for an Oscar for Brokeback Mountain and won a ton of others. The acting, writing and directing is top notch here. 

I didn't even notice the cursing, because I'm a grown man (and a college graduate). Cursing doesn't equal stupidity. Go watch George Carlin, who was a comic genius, and who also cursed like a sailor. You need to take your tampon out of your boypussy and quit crying like a little baby, nobody here agrees with you. "
,libertaswv,2013-02-09T22:31Z,"@juju83: So ignorant. 

""labor worker language""

lol :). What a gross little asshole.

The ""filth"" of which you speak are the wellspring of our language. The language of the people. The language of the street. The english language is a living thing, professor tightass - and it always has been. It breathes, it percolates, it borrows, it evolves.... it curses.

Asserting that profanity is somehow worthy of contempt or censorship displays an ignorance of the history (and working purpose) of the english language so profound it staggers the mind. Pick up a book. Do a little research before vomiting out the silly, puritanical nonsense with which you've been imprinted. 

I don't know if your association of ""ghetto"" and ""filth language"" denotes racism, latent or overt, but your conflations, misconceptions, and untenable ignorance are more than enough to make it clear that your opinion is a product of an extremely limited thinker. 

Additionally, when extolling the virtues of 'proper' language, it would behoove you to familiarize yourself with the basic rules of grammar. Casting aspersions against the educational accomplishments of others while ignoring nearly every elementary grammatical rule illustrates that you are as ignorantly hypocritical as you are comically prickish.

In 'common' parlance, you're a witless fuckhead, juju83, and you are aggresively uninformed. Spare us the evidence of this fact in the future. Please.

@josegrande: Damn man... Those ARE great tits :). 

-- Sincere thanks to condors369, and all seeders and leechers. Much appreciated all around.

Will seed to 20 or more

Your so educated..
 ""would no understand what I meant""

And
""other than the work fuck."" You sound very intelligent.


Only uneducated filth would no understand what I meant, so Im not worried at all.

Only the ghetto, uneducated, filthy moronic trash speak the way they do in this movie because they are too stupid to say anything other than the work fuck.

Im sure you enjoyed it."
