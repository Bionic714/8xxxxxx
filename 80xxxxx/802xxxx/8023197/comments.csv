,Chris9710,2013-01-16T00:27Z,"Sorry.
Here's how to do it:
1. Run keygen
2. Kill explorer.exe and fences.exe with task manager
3. go back to keygen (alt+tab)
Then once patched, you can press cntrl+alt+del to log off and then log back in so that explorer.exe starts again"
,jacob5800,2013-01-16T01:54Z,when it does nt work u have to try something else just to make it work for the others merci

,LittleJohnKs,2013-01-17T05:43Z,"To stop Explorer in Win7, hold down shift key & right click on empty area, click on exit explorer.
To restart Explorer in Win7, open task manager by ctrl+shift+esc, Click on File tab, run new task, type in explorer.exe  A quick reboot without restarting.  Works the same in Win 8."
,awannan,2013-01-18T21:41Z,thank you!
,JAB69,2013-03-12T15:54Z,"Nah, doesnt work, all steps above followed, Win7"
,moeburn1,2013-03-30T23:33Z,"@Chris9710, you say to end ""fences.exe"" task, but I don't have a ""fences.exe"" running.  Fences is installed, enabled and working, but I don't see a fences.exe? 

And the readme says to close it from the system tray.  It isn't IN the system tray!!!  I can right click on my desktop, hit 'enable fences', and it restores all my fences from my old version 1.0, and then when I go to configure instead of opening up an exe like the old version did, the new 2.01 just opens up a Control Panel dialog.  maybe thats why there's no fences.exe?"
,moeburn1,2013-03-30T23:40Z,"WTF is the keygen for?  I don't appear to need it.  Fences seems to be working just fine without it, I don't see any greyed out ""pro only"" options, or any time limit or anything like that.  And when I ran the keygen, it broke fences."
,donkerinternet,2013-04-09T21:45Z,that patch doesnt work that easy on windows 8. Try other download link here and that includes a patch that works because it auto closes Fences
,Pituto,2013-04-13T04:13Z,Thanks to Chris9710 !
,piratewawa11,2013-04-26T20:35Z,Thanks Works nice
,Racecar56,2013-04-29T17:26Z,"I got the ""Can't open file"" error before, but I was successfully able to use this by installing the program, *setting it up* (don't miss this), running the keygen, killing explorer.exe, successfully patching it and saving the license, and then finally running explorer.exe again. Thanks for the torrent!"
,Racecar56,2013-04-29T17:27Z,"Also, this was on Windows 8."
