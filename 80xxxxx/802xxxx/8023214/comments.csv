,jccman33,2013-01-15T20:21Z,Thanks. I have been searching for the Most Wanted Files issue and was not even aware of the 100 Project issue. Any chance of you uploading the two Earth's Mightiest Heroes eight issue mini-series from 2005 and 2007? Also if you have the A-Next series from 1998 that would be awesome. THANKS again for all the great uploads.
[V],STFmaryville,2013-01-15T20:48Z,"to everyone, i'm sorry but i spent an entire day and just could not find the Armed Forces giveaways #5 & #9. (i put a Spanish #5 in there instead.) i hated using the word complete when it's a 98.5% complete collection. share 'em if ya got 'em!

VonStone and jccman33, you're welcome. i don't have them at hand but i can probably find your requests. it will be thursday at the earliest, since i want to seed this one and make it as healthy as possible.

and jccman33, wow i thought ""ok i need to throw in ""illuminati"" -- i was baffled at the amount of spinoffs once i started looking!"
,tpacomics,2013-01-15T23:38Z,"This is just awesome. Thanks, STFmaryville! Any chance you can upload the 2006 volume of Justice League of America (it ran for 60 issues)? Thanks again."
