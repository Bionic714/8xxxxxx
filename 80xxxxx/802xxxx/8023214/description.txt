All the credit is due to the magnificent scanners, especially Megan-Empire ΓÇô who recently released New Avengers volume 1, all 64 issues and 3 annuals, in digital form ΓÇô because she inspired me to gather all the other comics. Also I must shout out praise to the Minutemen ΓÇô who released the set of New Avengers volume 2 scans and annual. There are several other scanners who are responsible for us being able to read these great comics, and all of them deserve applause and a thank you!

One last note: the third volume of New Avengers began on January 2, 2013.
