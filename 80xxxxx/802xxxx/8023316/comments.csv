,biteme1011,2013-01-17T21:33Z,You rule Yify! Nobody can touch you and the haters can suck my ballbag!!
,biteme1011,2013-01-17T21:37Z,nVelocius I totally agree! I've been looking for Of Mice and Men in HD forever! That film is awesome! That film is where I discovered the talent of Gary Sinise and he became one of my favorite actors. Loved him in Forrest Gump too.
,biggybo,2013-01-19T07:15Z,"I'm a huge fan of this series but this one was just total crap compared to the last three. Not scary at all, and the story wasn't great either. Thanks for the upload though, great quality. "
,SoCaliLyfe,2013-01-19T19:41Z,Hey yify you think you could upload The Pursuit Of Happiness.
,MarkP91,2013-01-26T06:05Z,Anyone know how to remove the Cinavia protection? Everytime I burn a newer Blu Ray that pops up when I play it

,loremnon,2013-01-29T19:39Z,"YIFY, your quality is great. It was a fast download, and the audio is a 10. People who are complaining about Dolby 5.1 should realize that it's impossible to have that with .mp4. Thanks! You are the best!!!

@SoCaliLyfe You spelt the ""Pursuit of Happyness"" wrong. They spell ""happiness"" with a 'y' because that's how the asian daycare spelled it."
