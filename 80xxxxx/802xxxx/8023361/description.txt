NTSC, 16:9 widescren format in a iso file of the DVD from the box set. Mount it or burn it then watch it or sleep thru it. It is all there with menus but NO directors track in any of them... Maybe an occasional bonus special.
Also there is NO alternate language tracks or subtitles. They spent very little to none to produce these.
					
The torrent will start to move in 1 day from the date of this posting. Seems season 1 is very popular.

More SG1 seasons will be forthcoming soon..
