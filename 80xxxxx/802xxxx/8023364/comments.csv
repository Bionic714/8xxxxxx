Did you rip these yourself from originals? I'm asking cuz quality on season 1 is horrific, looks to me like someone reauthored a dvd9 and shrunk it to fit dvd5."
[V],Scrufuss,2013-01-15T21:09Z,"I have always ripped them myself from DVD9 to 5 using DVD2. I did no authoring at all. I just let DVD2 do its thing.. 
HOWEVER Disk 1 of season 1 had a low volume and a few glitches I worked around. Notice in season 2 they have no other language tracks or subtitles at all. Cheap bastards
2 years ago when I did SG Atlantis they came out fine.. Horrific isnt my verb more like marginal is what I would use.. "

Just saying it's a shame you didn't upload the unshrunk versions instead, some scenes have macroblocks due to poor compression settings. 

I compared yours with ~600mb per filesize x264 encoded rips (by Meech I think) and yours are way worse even with less compression."

MAYBE I should delete it all together and saty screw it, you do it"
[V],Scrufuss,2013-01-20T13:00Z,Maybe you should upload a few torrents yourself and set an example.

Baje la primera con audio latino, el audio español de españa no me gusta. Solo hay 4 sesiones en audio latino y son las primeras 4 sesiones y crei que por fin las habia encontrado gracias a ti, pero resulta que por intentar mejorar el video borraste el audio, cosa que creo no funciono. Mejor subelas en dvd9 con audio latino tambien. Gracias de todas formas xD."
