Note:  Released in a cardboard gatefold !

Track 19 is the first time this version has been released !
Elvis hated the horn overdub and ordered it to removed it from the released version !

Quite a few outtakes on this disc have explicit language !

BMG released some of this material on their own cd (A Hundred Years From Now) , but edited out the explicit language.
 
    
With covers. Enjoy!
