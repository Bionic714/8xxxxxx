,machosalad,2013-01-16T11:59Z,"To figure out how it was encrypted i first created an empty weaponlist.wep and wrote 1234 in it. When i then started pocket tanks and looked at the weapon packs installed i saw a random string at the end of the list. It looked like this: 2*0,

When i then replaced the 1234 with 2*0, i got the string 1234. This gave me the clue that the encryption process is reversible and that 1234 = 2*0,

I tried lots of other strings to figure out exactly how the encryption process works. After a couple of days i managed to encrypt the weapon files using this technique, but it didn't quite look right. There was another encryption process where all bytes where displaced."

After decrypting the weapon files and peeked at it with a hex editor i saw the first bytes looked like this: ♫↕igi↕♫lOr30♫na↕
This was from weaponslist.wep which contain the first 30 weapons. After inspecting the string i saw the characters spell Original 30. This meant that the pack name was ""Original"" and that it had 30 weapons. When i changed the string to ♫↕345↕♫81299♫67↕ and encrypted the file and started pocket tanks i saw the original pack had changed name to 12345678 (99). This gave me a clue on how the byte displacement encryption process worked. after playing around with it some more i noticed the bytes where displaced at a chunk of 16."
