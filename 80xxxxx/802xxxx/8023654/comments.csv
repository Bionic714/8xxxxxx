,Knitty1,2013-01-28T17:27Z,The end of the book is missing.  It skips to the author notes.
[T],TxJag,2013-01-28T23:08Z,"@Knitty1 it looks fine to me. Can you tell me where it cuts off? Give me the last paragraph. Cause this is what I have:

“For over a week now, as the details leaked out, the press had been fixated on the set of ancient playing cards that were found in the Knight’s pocket. But as the President picked up his pace and followed the path back to Camp David, he knew that when it came to kings, queens, jacks, and the rest—and especially when it came to Beecher and the Culper Ring—nothing beats a wild card.”"

[T],TxJag,2013-02-08T15:55Z,@Azemone that's because I AM YOUR SOURCE! I am mesquite! Look at my uploads here and compare it to my uploads there. I upload EVERYTHING I have there and here on TPB and KAT.
