Filmed between April and August 1986, Ozzy was at the peak of his 1980s popularity. This video was a promotional celebration of Ozzy's triple platinum fifth solo album, THE ULTIMATE SIN. Originally broadcast on MTV, the video contains additional music videos and of course Ozzy swearing. THE ULTIMATE SIN album has become lost in Ozzy's catalogue over the years, so this performance is a must-see, since nearly every song from that album is here.
