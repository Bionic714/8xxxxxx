The episode numbering for Storage Hunters is confusing to say the least but I think I have it figured out now.

,storm2012,2013-01-17T03:47Z,"I googled Storage Hunters season 3 in the first week of new year & the searches i got said the new season would start on the 13th & according to wikipedia there was only 13 episodes in season 2, so either this is listed incorrectly or the infomation from numerous sources i got are incorrect. i would more than likely say this is incorrectly titled but oh well it doesn't make any difference to me. keep em coming."
,storm2012,2013-01-17T03:56Z,Just checked the tvguide link & apparently the 2 episodes that aired on the 6th are titled season 3 episodes 14&15 umm season 3 would start from ep 1 wouldn't it & where are these so called 2 epidoes. very confusing to say the least. so technically this torrent would Season 3 ep.3
