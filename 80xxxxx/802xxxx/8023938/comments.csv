,MadRevolver,2013-01-15T17:21Z,I just signed up to thank you. I love klei games and their replayability. When I have some money I will buy all their games. THANK YOU AGAIN you keep our nights warm:)
,Bozica,2013-01-15T18:34Z,"Installed normally, but on game start nothing is changed. Version History says it's the build as of 14.Jan.2013 but no rotting food in game or anything suchlike.

I guess it's just a pre-update thing... and the real update is yet to happen.

BTW Thanx for making this awesome game available to the oppressed masses of the illegal gaming world! :)

Keep up the good work!"
