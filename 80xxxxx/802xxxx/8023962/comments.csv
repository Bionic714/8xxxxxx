DibyaTPB sent the original releases in 720p and 1080p. Do you want the episodes re-encoded to a smaller size?"
,HondoOhnaka,2013-01-15T22:38Z,"Whoops, you're right! I don't know how I missed those. Disregard my last comment. 

But I hope you continue to upload the rest of TCW Season 5 as it comes out.

Thanks"
,odiato,2013-01-22T01:41Z,"Thank you for this. If you have it can you upload Season 1 Episodes 3, 16 , and 24 at this same quality? They seem to have been skipped. Thank you."
,odiato,2013-01-22T01:43Z,"Okay, I found Season 1 Episode 3 at this quality. It's just 16 and 24 that were skipped. Thank you again."
