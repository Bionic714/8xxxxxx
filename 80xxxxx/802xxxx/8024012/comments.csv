The image format is acceptable and a universally preferred format by audiophiles seeking lossless music.

It seems it is you that needs to learn to rip, trans-code and tag what you acquire. That is not the job of the up-loader.

Try a little tact, and a dash of humility when addressing those that provide at no cost to you.

Many thanks to the up-loader."
