,TheJoypad,2013-01-16T12:54Z,Some songs are corrupted to the point of glitching.
,vatel88,2013-01-16T17:02Z,This torrent is TRASHED! Some tracks the audio is completely toast! others its degraded to the point of ear splitting static. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT IF YOU WANT A FULL COPY IF THIS  ALBUM.
,vatel88,2013-01-16T17:05Z,"@Rpgaddict- From Wiki- Combichrist's song Never Surrender was featured in a gameplay demo for the upcoming hack-n-slash style video game DmC Devil May Cry with Andy LaPlegua working on the soundtrack for the whole game.

Andy worked on this soundtrack but the rest of Combichrist did not. "

responsible,
https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/dmc-devil-may-cry-original/id586410212
and there is absolutely no static like you are claiming it to be, Im pretty sure its a problem entirely only at your end."
,thanksamil,2013-01-17T04:19Z,@ Vitamin_X thank you very much for this upload. I listened to the entire soundtrack and only find track 1 and 2 are with static noise.
,EnemyDrone,2013-01-17T06:07Z,yeah put this on to bump while im cleaning and WTF....glitches galore!!! Freaked my dog out!!!
,-Frozzles,2013-01-17T09:08Z,"The Combichrist Songs people keep asking about are part of their new album, that are somehow connected with the game. It comes out the 25th I believe."
,Feathers_,2013-01-18T20:53Z,"""Crush Him"" and ""found"" are glitchy, but those are the only two. The rest of the songs play fine and are great quality. 4/5 rating for this torrent."
,devj89,2013-01-19T16:59Z,"Vitamin_X , first two tracks r fucked up , believe me  !

+1"
,Remorze,2013-01-23T08:42Z,"I'd just like to confirm that, as -Frozzles said, the Combichrist tracks from the game are being released separately as their DmC soundtrack album ""No Redemption"", due to be released Jan. 25th."
,EX_CroW,2013-01-29T16:38Z,Don't bother downloading.  The album is all messed up.  @Vitamin_X you need to either reupload this album in working condition or take it down.
,EX_CroW,2013-01-29T16:39Z,"Here's a link to download the full album that actually works.

,omitted_name,2013-02-27T23:05Z,Thie songs are fine for me. I am not sure why some of you are having problems but try re-downloading it and if tha doesn't solve it move to another.
,p1z3l7,2013-03-16T13:14Z,"I can confirm, soundtracks ""Crush Him"" and ""Found"" are broken. Other songs aren't broken, but you can hear static (on Arcade Machine (Diegetic) and Remember Us for example)."
