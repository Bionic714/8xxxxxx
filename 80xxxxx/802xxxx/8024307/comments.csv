,benwelker,2013-01-15T22:04Z,Why is this file so damn big?
[T],theburningbush,2013-01-15T23:50Z,"benwelker: I believe it's because the frame rate is so high: 59.940 fps. It's certainly not because of the resolution, which is only 640 x 360.

Also, the a/v is way out-of-sync; the farther into the program, the worse it gets. I'm currently DLing Jimmy.Fallon.2013.01.14.Uma.Thurman.720p.HDTV.x264-BAJSKORV to see if the sync is good there."

[T],theburningbush,2013-01-16T05:48Z,"See https://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8026401 for a small, in-sync version of this program."
,.Leto.,2013-01-19T11:17Z,Not the first time a AFG release is out of sync. It happens so often actually that I'm not even downloading them anymore.
