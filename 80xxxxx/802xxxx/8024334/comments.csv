,pc_div,2013-01-17T13:19Z,"I can't install, my bitdefender warn me with this...

File:  setup.exe=>(CAB Sfx r)=>file.exe Trojan.Generic.8620410 Infected 

and in install  i receive a lot of errors, any  ignore i do...not working......too bad, i gona try other version... thanks anyway Prophet and for the uploader....!!! "
,PseudoPositive,2013-01-17T14:28Z,"@pc_div, I installed this with no problems; my AV is Comodo, I scanned the ISO & DIR folder, they both came up clean, Bitdefender is well known for PseudoPositives, try install on another rig without AV, if you DL another copy of this, you'll probebly get the same result; save your bandwith, there's nothing wrong with this copy, just FYI.

just copy & paste the contents into the install DIR (Overwriting the original files) & you're good to go."
,dada1973,2013-01-19T00:35Z,the game works but too many bugs.  I think I'm on 3rd mission and when the game starts it said mission failed.  but I didn't even do anything...
,raspykitty117,2013-01-19T08:30Z,thanks! :D first i tought the installation folder was gonna go into the SGW folder XDD
,raspykitty117,2013-01-19T08:47Z,Cant put in any folder there. I need more space in that folder? now what? 
,raspykitty117,2013-01-19T08:49Z,NVM i fixed it! thanks ´for le game :3
,ozdlinc,2013-01-23T17:18Z,There is a hidden script at then end of the installation which uses wscript to run a fake svchost.exe from the temp folder which then starts to disable services like the security center most AV progs wont pick this up but trust me its there god knows what other services this shit has disabled
,RETXEDTAGNOB,2013-02-07T09:55Z,Thanks! its awesome! MABUHAY KA!
,bucaneerplayer,2013-02-23T03:52Z,"Newbie here. :)  I installed using the installer on to my laptop (c:) , followed directions and copied over the crack files into the directory (copy/replace).  Restarted computer. Clicked on desktop shortcut and the program will not open, but a popup box says: ""Can't Start...d3dx9_39.dll is missing from your computer..""
What should I do?   Thanks in advance for any tip."
,plyply,2013-02-24T22:01Z,Is this the v1.2 version of the game?
,shimano1,2013-02-27T04:04Z,"Bought this shit from a retail store, however the PC DVD ROM didn't work.  Every time I tried to run the game, I got an ""INVALID SERIAL KEY.""  Pissed me the FUCK OFF.

It was a sealed, genuine DVD too!! 

Hopefully, this torrent will work as I'm tired of trying to get the real disc to run. 

City Interactive doesn't respond to their paying customers promptly. TORRENT FTW!!"
,shimano1,2013-02-27T04:46Z,"Fantastic upload...works better than my OEM disk. Time to play! 

Thanks HeroMaster, you rock! "
,jamillos22,2013-03-01T11:32Z,"Unfortunately, the settings error is so stupid, that I had to uninstall the game. It won't save changes not inly in video, but also in keyboard mappings and none of the patches/fixes I tried helped. No official patch for this after 2-3 years since the release – so f*ck off. "
,RockDedJoy2,2013-03-15T11:40Z,Can anyone tell me exactly what to do to install the game properly since the 1st time i installed it had an error sry for being a noob but i sont want to get angry for not succeeding and smash the monitor again
,RockDedJoy2,2013-03-15T11:54Z,Can anyone tell me what to do exactly since i cant figure things out now i am instaling the game.  or do i have to do something before it? opened setup.exe but dunno what to do coz its failing all d time d installation
,Mutant_Gu,2013-06-02T03:27Z,Is it working on windows 8 64 bit?
