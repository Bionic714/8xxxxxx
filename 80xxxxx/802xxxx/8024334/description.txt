When the democratic government of Isla Trueno is
overthrown, an aggressive and hostile military
command rises to power. A highly trained special
ops unit is sent in to help the rebels accomplish
objectives that only a sniper can handle. In
addition to intense sniper missions, players will
also take part in a variety of assault scenarios
where their prowess with weapons will be a huge
help to the undermanned rebels. Sniper: Ghost
Warrior seeks to challenge players in new ways so
that the game is both demanding and entertaining
Developed by City Interactive's dedicated next-gen
games studio, Sniper: Ghost Warrior delivers an
impressive visual and technological gaming
experience and features a realistic ballistics
system that measures bullet trajectory, bullet drop
and environmental effects such as wind, fog and
rain. Encompassing a wide array of single and
multiplayer levels, players will encounter a
variety of challenging terrain. Players take on the
role of a Ghost Warrior, an elite sniper in a
highly trained special ops unit, whose unique
skills in the art of stalking, target detection
surveillance and shooting accuracy will determine
mission success. Covert missions force players to
operate undetected as they attempt to eliminate
hostile enemies one head shot at a time
