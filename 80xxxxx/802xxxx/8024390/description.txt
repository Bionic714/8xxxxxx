I am currently digitizing all my Zymurgys along with BYO (Brew Your Own) magazines.

I am looking to find the missing issues and will post what magazines I am missing if anyone wants to share them to have them digitized. I will be happy to return after digitizing them. Email me at  beermags (AT) gmail dot com  if you think you can.

Here is the list of needed BYO's:


BYO 30 Great Beer Styles


Guide to Kegging

Thank you to who shall be nameless for help with the missing issues. Without his help, they would not have happened!


Hope you enjoy these. And if you find any errors please 
email me at  beermags (AT) gmail dot com  .
