Today's specialty cheese market is booming, and many once obscure cheese varieties are now widely available. The Cheesemonger's Kitchen collects 90 delightful recipes that move cheese into a meal's starring role. Culled from chef and cheesemonger Chester Hastings's 25 years of experience, these recipes take full advantage of the varied flavors of cheese in ways both traditional and innovative. A cheese book that focuses on recipes rather than acting as a buyers guide or primer, this substantive and personal exploration accompanied by 50 color photographs plus wine pairing tips from acclaimed sommelier Brian Kalliel is a comprehensive guide to the vast world of specialty cheeses.
