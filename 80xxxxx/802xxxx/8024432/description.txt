                           DESCRiPTiON 

 The actress and comedy writer meets six women who have gone through midlife 
 crises to find out what happened and how they coped. Among them are Gaynor, 
 whose husband left her for the woman next door; businesswoman Nicky, who 
 experienced several tragedies but managed to reinvent herself as she approached 
 40; and divorcee Leila, whose desire to have a child has led her to undergo 
 artificial insemination using sperm donors.
