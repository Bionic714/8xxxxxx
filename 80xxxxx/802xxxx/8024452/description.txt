[I do not have the book on .pdf]

I also added the appendixes from the CD to this .pdf and "answers to selected problems".  If you want everything from the 8th edition CD, go to this torrent: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7360087/Automatic_Control_Systems_by_Benjamin_C.Kuo(Solution)-Eighth_Edi ; it has some programs on it you may want

The solutions and everything in this .pdf is on the CD, but I just combined it all, bookmarked it, and optimized it so that other people don't have to.  Keep this easy to use .pdf in one file on your flash drive for school use.
