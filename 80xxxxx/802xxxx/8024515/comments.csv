01/2013 :..... RELEASE.DATE .. PROTECTION .......: Steam
 - :.......... DISC(S) .. GAME.TYPE ........: Diablo Clone

Note: This minor update only changed the exe file since the last one, so we
 only included the crack. For this reason you need to have your game
 updated to Update 10 before installing this

Changes
 Stability
 - Fix for potential Steamworks related crash

Gameplay
 - Fix for a desynchronization error which can occur in 3 player multiplayer
 games in very specific timing circumstances
 - Fix for a rare issue where the effects on a merchant's items (or items
 left on the ground) can be wiped if a player takes ownership of a level
 while the original owner is departing.

The award-winning action RPG is back, bigger and better than ever
 Torchlight II takes you back into the quirky, fast-paced world of
 bloodthirsty monsters, bountiful treasures, and sinister secrets - and, once
 again, the fate of the world is in your hands

Torchlight II captures all the flavor and excitement of the original game
 while expanding the world and adding the features players wanted most,
 including online and LAN co-op multiplayer. Torchlight II is fast, fun,
 and filled to the brim with action and loot. Adventure solo or online with
 your friends

Key Features
 Multiplayer - Play co-op with your friends via LAN or over the Internet for
 free. No subscriptions, no item sales. Our new matchmaking service lets you
 find friends, start new games, and join existing games. And, as always, you
 can play single-player offline as well

Customizable Characters - Players will create and customize a character from
 one of four brand new classes. Each class can be played as either male or
 female, with customized cosmetic features and looks to make each individual
 character stand out. All new skills and loot give loads of opportunity for
 unique character builds

Moddability - TorchED, the Torchlight II editor, will give players the
 ability to create their own mods, adding even more content to the world.
 Have your friends download the same mod and play together. TorchED will be
 available as a separate download very shortly after launch

New User Interface - Torchlight II boasts a new and improved user interface,
 designed to be easier than ever for new players to pick up and play. This
 intuitive interface ensures you can focus on playing the game the way you
 want to

Open World - We're not only in the town of Torchlight anymore Explore vast
 overland areas and multiple hub towns, fight through rain, snow, day and
 night. Our level randomization ensures new layouts, paths, loot, and
 monsters every time you play

New Game Plus - In New Game Plus, the game's not over until you say it is.
 Once you've beaten Torchlight II's primary campaign, you can start again
 with the same character for a significantly greater challenge. You'll keep
 all of the skills, gold, and gear you worked so hard for
 Pets & Fishing - These popular features make their return in Torchlight II
 in improved form. More choices, better effects, and your pet will still
 make the run to town to sell your loot so you don't have to

1. Install the update into the dir where you have Torchlight II with
 Update 10 installed
 2. Play the game
 3. Support the software developers. If you like this game, BUY IT"

,SACEMJTM,2013-01-16T16:01Z,"Problem Sir ?

Why a 36 Mb .exe instead of the 5 Mb .rar we can find on a lot of other websites ? 

This patch is just a new torchlight.exe, isn't it ? Why an installer way too big ?

So, good or bad file ? Someone tested ?"
[V],Mr.Stifmeister,2013-01-16T16:39Z,"@SACEMJTM: Yes its 5MB when its compressed in rar, this is unpacked for you."

,kloudykat,2013-03-31T18:57Z,Hope this is the update I need to get SynergiesMOD working!
,kloudykat,2013-03-31T19:53Z,"Alright kids, clear some space on ya dirty floor cause I'm about to drop some knowledge on dat ass.

Download Torchlight.II-RELOADED, then get the Torchlight.II.Update.10-RELOADED and Torchlight.II.Update.11-RELOADED.  You can find all of those files on TPB.

Then get the SynergiesMOD 2.005 zip file from their page (google it). 

Install the game and crack it first, then copy the updated files from the Update 10 to your install directory, then run the Update 11 .exe

Once all that is done, extract the SynergiesMOD zip to ""yourtorchlightinstalldirectory/PAK"" and start the game, then start a new game.

You should see the new classes, Myrmidon and Ninja.  Alright, hope this helps some people out.  Now that I finally got it installed, cracked, patched and modded, I gotta get playing!"
,raymund14,2013-04-05T05:23Z,when will the new version of torchlight II be uploaded? there's a new one out there which utilizes   GUTS. and the new synergiesmod is utilizing it and the new mod isn't working with this version of the game.
