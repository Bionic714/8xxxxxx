If that's the manufacturer brand which the script detected, that's the OEM theme etc which it will install.

If your un-happy with it. Use my copy below which is not branded but is activated. Hold onto the Updates from this download and just update it after install.

  There's no added performance etc by using a 'branded' version. It just offers some people the option to have e.g. HP branding on a HP PC or laptop. 

It is no better or worse than any of my other Windows 7 uploads. It just gives an alternative to downloaders from other Windows 7 uploads.

Hope this clears things up for you ;-)"
