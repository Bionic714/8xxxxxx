Cleveland Brown (Mike Henry) and his family and friends are back for more

becoming a Major League Baseball scout; and befriends the family's new physician,
Dr. Fist (recurring guest voice Bryan Cranston). Also, Donna takes her run for
local office way too seriously, and Cleveland Jr. takes Rallo under his wing
after a lice outbreak at school forces him to chop off his beloved 'fro.

Cleveland is furious when Donna's ex-husband, Robert, crashes Freight Train's
birthday party and upstages Cleveland's gift for his dad. To make matters worse,
Freight Train officially adopts Robert, and Cleveland must learn to get along with
his new "brother". Meanwhile, to pay off a bet they owe to Donna, Rallo and Junior
become "dog bounty hunters", tracking down lost pooches, returning them to their
owners and collecting the rewards.
