,slinckkey,2013-01-16T05:05Z,works but sometimes the mouse arrow disappears. any fixes for it?
,v.a.h.e,2013-01-16T10:06Z,"i havent found a fix for the mouse, but if you move your mouse around the screen like really quick (go crazy) the cursor should be back :)"
,unicorn555,2013-01-17T06:38Z,"hey friends, does this work multiplayer? 
personally i'm a bit sceptical about this.... because EA is really strict with the whole piracy thing "

,v.a.h.e,2013-01-18T12:49Z,"@lanouch 

hahah:) you are very welcome!

@Kinopu

ill try to fuck around with it but i really dont think i can find it out as i am not a computer geek or anything, and this is actually my firs torrent... so if anyone else with more experience could help us out it would be great"
,Cuthalion13,2013-01-18T18:13Z,"HEY DUDES!
 Im sorry for this late post (made this account for this comment lol) , i've actually solved the cursor problem some days ago just by changing resolution (and then back again if you want to). I'm not 100% sure if this is going to work for the rest of you but it works everytime for me :D"
,espirates,2013-01-20T19:33Z,"piece of shit game, doesn't even work on mac mountain lion, i can't click on anything, slow as hell too. thought if I went into options but can't even get to it."
,espirates,2013-01-20T20:22Z,"how do i remove this from my mac, where are all the files at?"
,Introverture,2013-01-21T09:53Z,Why the hell is this game so slow? Even with the VERY LOW settings its very slow and i know its not my graphics card because i can play StarCraft 2 in high settings smoothly
,eljayem,2013-01-22T01:56Z,Is there any suggested version of Wineskin for this torrent? 
,juanitopomes,2013-01-26T17:51Z,"I created ALL the heroes except the men of the East, when I was creating one of them, the game closed, then i came here to see any issues and i saw the mouse issue, this issue never happened to me before but now everytime i open the game I have the mouse issue... this one of my favourite games and I don't have any Windows to play it so this torrent it's the only solution, could you give me some help?"
,Kinopu,2013-01-27T17:02Z,Fix the mouse issue ASAP please :)
,hurukh,2013-01-30T17:50Z,"Anybody made this work? The menu is slow as hell for me and by the time I manage to click on options my cursor just disappears. So I have no mouse cursor and the menu is really slow, haven't even been able to start a game. I tried running it through the debug mode, but still no luck.
If anyone has found a way to run this game please tell us how you did, I really want to play this one. Thank you."
,Cuthalion13,2013-01-31T17:40Z,"It's really slow even on the lowest settings, to get the mouse back you have to change resolution. Hard without a mouse at first but after that you're good."
,Alex_g_87,2013-02-02T22:24Z,"Thank you for the ported game v.a.h.e didnt even know it existed but love it, am on Os 10.7 i7 2.2ghz 4gb amd and intel hd, the game does not run on amd dont know about nvidea but is almost perfect on intel hd if you are having problems with it being slow just download gfxCardStatus open and select intergrated only which will run the intel card only as the name gives away, this should solve the slowness as for the cursor Cuthalion13's method works very well. Thanks again for ze game"
,IAmSoGreat,2013-02-26T23:55Z,"ok i dont get why it runs slow for some people, it runs fine on my late 2010 15' mac book pro and my counsins late 2010 13' mac book pro but runs slow as hell on my late 2010 21.5' imac 

as for the mouse problem, if you cant get to options fast enough to change resolution then press command + tab, move your mouse off the window till it appears again and then change resolution and click accept. 

hope this helps and if anyone has worked out how to make it run right please let us know 

oh and thanks V.a.h.e.for the upload it might not be perfect but its fun"
,ctpcheng,2013-03-03T04:57Z,thank you soo much! Now where can i find the expansion... :D
,ctpcheng,2013-03-06T01:08Z,do any of you have to use the arrows to scroll through the screen? Going to the edge of my screen doesnt do anything and i have to manually shift it using the arrows on my keyboard
