,Dodlegob,2013-01-20T16:56Z,"Really? you guys don't know?

When you go to install, Hunt down your original install location.

Select that location.

When it comes back to the ""this is where its gonna install"" screen, Delete the ""current"" name from the end of the ""old"" name
Example
I started with Don't starve Nov 30th version
D:gamesdon't_starve_beta_nov_30

select this again when I go to update

D:gamesdon't_starve_beta_nov_30don't_starve_beta_xxx_xx

Delete the ""new"" part (when you do, it should actually tell you it's ""changed"" bin and other things before.

D:gamesdon't_starve_beta_nov_30
Install and enjoy your old stuff."
