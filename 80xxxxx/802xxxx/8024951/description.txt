This is ultimate series on the fight against the Mafia,
 told by the people who tried to stop them - the FBI. The
 stories involve many twists and turns as the Mafia tried
 to combat the FBI by recruiting FBI agents into their pay.
 It will feature dramatic reconstruction, archive and
 exclusive testimony from witnesses and from FBI special agents.
 
The Mafias Greatest Hits is based upon exceptional access
 to the FBI s previously secret files on the Mafia. It aims
 to uncover the extraordinary truth behind some of the
 Mafia s most notorious killers. The FBI wants to reveal how:
 they didn t realise the extent and scope of the Mafia and
 its organisation until 1963 and then started to try and
 actively combat it, they realised that many of the crimes
 which they were trying to solve before that date (and thought
 of as racketeering ) were all interlinked and answered into a
 small group of Mafia bosses in New York, they realised that
 killing is an essential element of Mafia culture as it is the
 way in which the Mafia establishes territory and also
 establishes hierarchy. If you want to lower murder statistics
 in an area you firstly rid it of the Mafia.
