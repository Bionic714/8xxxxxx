,AquaPigmyNinja,2013-01-15T22:52Z,I had no idea they were even releasing this. One of my all time favorite anime! Thanks! Can't wait for the rest!
,mooserocka,2013-01-19T20:14Z,yea good anime but how many times can you watch it piggy. GEEZ It was on repeat for adult swim for 6=8 years. I wouldnt be suprised if it was still on i just havent watched adult swim in a while since like season 2 of bleach. Great anime and once again audio video 10. Just how many times can you watch it. I watched it so much i almost hate it lol.
,luf4all,2013-01-21T02:51Z,It's always good to have the best quality available just in case you wanna see it again. TV quality sucks anyways.
