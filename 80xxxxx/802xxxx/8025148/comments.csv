[T],MrUnpopular,2013-01-16T00:13Z,"Love you too, xevilx. :)"
,Neon_Jackal,2013-01-16T08:54Z,Split archive? Really? Could you at least tell me what file format it is?
,yeemen,2013-01-16T15:33Z,"The file is in .mkv format. Good quality and audio, thanks!"
,cuteycindyhoney,2013-01-16T20:50Z,"Thanks for this! Everyone, avoid that group calling themselves UNPOPULAR. They upload crap, and actually brag about the poor quality in their little message! "
[T],MrUnpopular,2013-01-17T01:00Z,"@Neon_Jackal it's a split archive because it's leeched directly from the scene, it's how they pre releases - split into archives. Sceneline doesn't bother extracting it, but it takes like 5 seconds so why complain?

@cuteycindyhoney Damn right we do!"
