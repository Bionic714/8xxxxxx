No subtitles included in this blu-ray but I simply converted 29.970 fps english subs found on the net to 23.976 with Subtitle Workshop, it works perfectly."

A movie with John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara, simply good acting and great colour scenery makes for a great movie, listen for the great tenor voice in the early Irish pub scene, when the patrons sing ""The wild Colonial Boy""."

So Thank You very much for this :)"
