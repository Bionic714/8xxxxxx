Thanks."
,Catvision247,2013-01-16T11:51Z,"Thanks very much!  
If you'll post each movie in 40gb and 1080p you will be my king forever!!! That would be awesome. Please do that and make my day!!"
,HerrNiIsson,2013-01-22T18:56Z,I agree with Catvision247
,p_bacon,2013-01-31T08:35Z,You guys should really buy this collection. It's worth it IMO
,niggerbitte,2013-02-14T03:35Z,"Please please please... please seed. I got here by reading this http://www.skeptic.com/reading_room/the-great-afterlife-debate/ and then I searched for the word atman and then I got to this site http://www.supertonica.net/ and then, I just felt deep within I really have to and want to see this. So please seed, because it shows it will take infinity until it gets to me! I'll leave my computer open since 7.30 in the morning smth in usa time until midnight. Please please. Thank you in advance. Peace :)"
,Skram0,2013-03-07T06:57Z,"I'm looking for a 1080p encode also.

Things are going backwards, as someone recently posted on 3/1/13 some 3GB 4000 Kbps encodes. May as well just re-encode it down to 30x16 ""watch"" size and get it over with. It's amazing the crap-quality people get used to these days."
,HerrNiIsson,2013-03-18T09:26Z,This collection is available at rutracker in 1080p full bluray quality! It's a mega-pack of 132GB!
,Skram0,2013-04-07T04:08Z,"@HerrNiIsson
132GB!? Jesus christ!

The only things I download THAT large are whole TV series. For just 3 movies seems ridiculous. I'm looking for something around 9GB each, about 27GB for all three in 1080p."
