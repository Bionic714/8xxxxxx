Evening, Torrenter. I have uploaded this as my first torrent, to showcase the talent of a new, up-and-coming band called Ã†ther Realm. They're made up of some personal friends of mine, and I've uploaded this in hopes of spreading their name, as well as their music.

This is an upload of their most recent album, "One Chosen by the Gods", which they released for purchase very recently, here: http://aetherrealm.storefrontier.com/

That is also their official merch store. PLEASE BUY THEIR STUFF. It's awesome. I have the blue shirt.

They're primarily a Viking-style Melodic-Deathmetal band, which means fast, pounding drums,  heavy guitar shredding with sweeping orchestral backing, and harsh, powerful vocals.

Their Lineup: 
Vincent Jones - Vocals, Orchestrals, Bass
Heinrich Arnold - Guitars
Jack Rodriguez-Dougherty - Guitars
Tyler Gresham - Drums

Their Facebook: .com/AetherRealm

If people ask, I'll upload the lyrics. 

Track information is already set on the files.
