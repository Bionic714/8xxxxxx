Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site :: On the Tuesday, January 15 transmission of the Alex Jones Show, Alex reports on the no holds barred assault being waged on the Second Amendment with NY Gov. Andrew Cuomo leading the charge, passing a sweeping new act in the NY Senate completely banning certain types of firearms and magazines all in the name of keeping you safe. 

Alex also covers the debt crisis which has some influential figures requesting a nix of the arbitrary debt ceiling altogether.
