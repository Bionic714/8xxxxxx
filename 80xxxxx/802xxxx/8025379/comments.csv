,Knightyme,2013-01-16T19:22Z,"@silentinquiry  ??? you can download files of a given torrent in any order you want, or not download files, say the movie, at all while getting the others."
,silentinquiry,2013-01-16T20:46Z,"not with bit torrent you cant, nor frost wire"

Why would you want to convert to other formats and lose quality?

""transcode on most burners""

What the fuck does that even mean?

And yes, the .nfo IS available before you download it."

It sets its torrent client to prioritize the .nfo and sample files.
It shuts the fuck up."
,silentinquiry,2013-01-21T15:30Z,"Christ, It's like talking to the Normal Brothers; SUB and AB. My nero burner will not convert MKV files to DVD. Get it stupid ? I have to convert the MKV file to MP4 or AVI before my nero burner will accept it and transcode to DVD.
My god are you people dense. "
,silentinquiry,2013-01-21T15:35Z,"And my P2P program wont display the contents of any NFO file, until its completely downloaded, therefore I have to wait and see what the fuck you shit heads have uploaded before I can decide on dumping it. I am typing this very slowely so you can get it, OK ? Now go back to jerking off you assholes."

Try using µtorrent for downloading Bit Torrents (or any one of many other clients) as you can prioritise individual files within the torrent (eg. downloading the .nfo file or sample first) An .nfo file will often only take seconds to complete downloading, you don't need to wait for the other files to complete.

If you have issues with converting some file types, you can try ConvertXtoDVD. It works with many more file formats than Nero and gives the option of burning once converted.

There's no need to get sarcastic or attack uploaders or fellow posters when it is you who is using less flexible or less compatible software than others."
