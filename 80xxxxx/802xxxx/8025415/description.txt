The Rocketeer is a rollicking tribute to pulp novels and Saturday morning matinee serials. It follows the high-flying adventures of stunt pilot Cliff Secord and his girlfriend Betty, after Cliff finds a mysterious jet pack and takes to the sky. One of the most beloved comic series of all time, The Rocketeer has been completely remastered and is presented here with glorious all-new coloring for the first time.
