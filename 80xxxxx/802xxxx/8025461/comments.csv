,headfood,2013-02-02T20:24Z,how do you install the mods?
,coolpw,2013-03-08T13:16Z,Not launch
,coolpw,2013-03-08T13:19Z,"Minecraft can not launch in it's current configuration
What the problem? please help"
,BloodravenD,2013-03-16T07:00Z,"@headfood  It does that automatically so you don't have to.  If you want to make it like a regular .minecraft folder.  Copy everything over and put all the ""instMods"" into the minecraft.jar"
,bavs01,2013-04-01T16:01Z,Really nice! It works perfect :) Thx for upload

DO NOT update the launcher or your profile wont work!

You CAN update the mods but NOT the launcher!"
,BloodravenD,2013-04-09T08:43Z,"Just a heads up to everyone, 1.2.3 of the launcher is out, you do not need to update to it.  If you do, you won't be able to get the files and your profile won't work."
,khaotik69,2013-05-13T23:13Z,I am trying to launch but it keeps saying connection failed when trying to download .jars. Any suggestions?
