I been trying to find this one ever since I lost the vinyl.
Thanx for the upload. I'll seed for a while after downloading.

The album was re-done in '84 with a more heavy instrumental sound to them, while this one has a more raw rock & roll sound to them, possibly from the 2007 album ""The Early Sound City Sessions"" which had the original songs from '78 not the '84 remakes.

Still an awesome download though, I haven't heard these ones till now.
Still, my search for the '84 album continues...
