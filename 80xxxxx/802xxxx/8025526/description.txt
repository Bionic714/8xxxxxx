Issue #20 completes the 2 part story arc by Si Spurrier (Crossed: Wish You Were Here) and Raulo Caceres (Crossed: Psychopath). The story involves a former criminal who was turned into one of the Crossed, but still retains a level of self control and rationality compared to the other Crossed.

Enjoy and seed!
