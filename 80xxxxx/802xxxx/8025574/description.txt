Adventures in the Rifle Brigade: Operation Bollock (3 Issues)


The Rifle Brigade is a British special forces commando unit commanded by Captain Darcy and staffed with a variety of oddball and at times deviant soldiers from varied British cities and allied nations. The two stories concerns their various covert missions across Europe and Africa and their relevance to the Allied victory.

'Operation: Bollock' in particular focused on the team's diplomatic and action-packed attempts to gain for themselves the missing testicle of Adolf Hitler. It is being held in the small Arabic country of Semmen and is being pursued by many forces, German, American and British, none of which the Brigade can trust.

The American forces are represented by Maryland Smith, a whip-wielding adventurer with the unwanted nickname of 'Mary'.
