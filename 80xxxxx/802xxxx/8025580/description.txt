Along with the guitar, he sings and plays the theremin, the cello, musical saw, keyboards, drums, bass & bouzouki. Morse has a degree in electrical 
engineering and owns anelectronics manufacturing company, DynaMetric, Inc. Unusual for a rock guitar player, Morse does not use a pick.

Musicians for this album include all of Spock's Beard original line-up, and Alan's brother, Neal, also co-wrote with him several tracks.
