Robert "Battler" Britton is a fighter pilot with the Royal Air Force. Commanding his own squadron of trusted veterans, heΓÇÖs one of BritainΓÇÖs most successful pilots, thanks to his superior strategic thinking, his courage, and his survivalist instinct that always seems able to get him back home if he has to ditch his aircraft. EnnisΓÇÖs take on the character sees him teaming up with an American squadron, camped behind enemy lines in the heart of the Sahara desert. Although the two squadrons take a bit of time to get over their cultural differences, BrittonΓÇÖs leadership pulls the group together to take on some serious German opposition.
