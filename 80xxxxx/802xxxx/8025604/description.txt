Hey guys. This upload is quite special to me, since its an artist I have been following from the start. 

In honor of his one year anniversary, I am releasing all of his tracks for download!

Archie is becoming a massive banger in the club scene, and I hope he gets out there a lot in the upcoming years.

This pack contains every single one of his unreleased/EP/remix/single releases to date, as well as his early Brony work, which he deleted from his youtube channel a while back. 

If you love these tracks, be sure to support him by buying future releases!

(NOTE: For some tracks, the album artwork shows another man in shades by the name of Archie. However, he is not THIS Archie. Don't get confused! :P)

Hope you guys enjoy. Send a like on Facebook or a follow on Twitter if you do!
