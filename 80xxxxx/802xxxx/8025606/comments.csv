,candyspaceship,2013-01-19T16:41Z,"I'm done, you can start uploading season 15 or 18 :))"
,dfields,2013-01-21T15:13Z,"Thank you so much for uploading these! I've been watching your uploads periodically in hopes you will post more seasons, so I'm really grateful.
The only thing is that the audio keeps cutting off, usually after a commercial break but sometimes just randomly. If you restart and forward to another time right away, it will go for a while with sound, but not always. (It's happening both on the Island and Duel seasons. Haven't checked Gauntlet.) 
I'm using VLC and I've never encountered this issue before. Do you know what might be causing it?"

I've just watched an episode of The Island and that didn't happened untill the middle of the episode, but them it disappeared towards the end. I really don't know why that is like that but it looks like a bit of unsync between sound and image. Did anyone else had the same problem? I'm using Media Player Classic. Maybe is something about the codecs we are using? Or maybe it could be because of the encoding.

Sorry about that. I'll try to workout that problem for future uploads. ;)"
