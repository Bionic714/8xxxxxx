Three years in the making, Recipes for Disaster is the long-awaited follow-up to the CrimethInc. collective s notorious first book, Days of War, Nights of Love. This 624-page manual complements the romance and idealism of that earlier work with practical information and instruction. Over thirty collectives collaborated in testing, composing, and editing the book s 62 sections, which range from Affinity Groups, Coalition Building, and Mental Health to Sabotage, Squatting, and Wheatpasting. These are illustrated with extensive technical diagrams and first-hand accounts, and prefaced with a thorough discussion of the diverse roles direct action can play in social transformation. If you re looking for a tactical handbook for revolutionary action, look no further.
