Writer & Artist: Jason Paulos


Written and drawn by Jason Paulos (Mad Magazine, Hairbutt the Hippo, Green Lantern), EEEK! is a retro anthology paying homage to the classic horror comics of the 50's, 60s and 70's, when the world was a bloodier, more ironic place and justice came for you whether you wanted it or not.
