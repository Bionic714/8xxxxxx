,khallian,2013-01-16T08:28Z,my God.. you want us to download 8.21gb of data without giving us the names etc.
,balter,2013-01-16T08:31Z,@khallian: maybe try the files link before whining?
,freeverse,2013-01-16T08:51Z,"What, you can't look at the Meta-data? Everything is clearly labeled in the torrent. There are almost 70 games in there, I'm not writing up a list.

There's King's Quest, Space Quest, Day of The Tentacle, Full throttle, Discworld, Gemini Rue, resonance, and a bunch of others. It's not one big zip file-Each game can be downloaded separately, so no, you don't have to download 8 gigs to see what's there."
,benj_pagt,2013-01-16T14:24Z,"@khallian: Try clicking on the figure next to the word ""FILES"" on the upper right. It's clear that all 71 files available are listed nicely."
,RipperDaVe,2013-01-18T01:51Z,This is really freaking sweet! Thanks a lot!
,stephen6789,2013-01-20T17:30Z,"looks like a sweet package, right?
try getting any of these games to work!"
,freeverse,2013-01-21T09:51Z,"@steven6789: The readme File may be a bit messy, but It's actually not all that hard. I think most of these games should work pretty easily just by using the Android ports of AGS and ScummVM. The only problem I can think of that I didn't cover in the Readme is if your hardware isn't up to spec, but if there's some issue you're running into, I may be able to help.

Unless you're trying to run them on Windows... In which case, I think you have the wrong torrent :)"
