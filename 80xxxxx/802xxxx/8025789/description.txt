Storyline

In 1893, the railroad is coming to Pecos, Texas, and crooked land agent Martin Conroy has his henchmen terrorize local ranchers into selling cheap, to his own profit. Tim and Chito try to aid crusading editor Carsen by summoning famous marshal Terry Moran from El Paso. What they get is Moran's attractive daughter, also named Terry. The female marshal can shoot, but our heroes still have a big job ahead... 


User Review

Hard not to agree with the other reviewers—this is not the duo's best oater. The boys appear to be just going through the motions without the usual spark or enlivening banter. Add to that an all-too-familiar storyline, and the results are mediocre, to say the least.

I always admired Holt as maybe the only matinée hero with a sidekick bigger and handsomer than he, and no buffoon, to boot. Together, they were an appealing exception to the usual. But, by 1952, the handwriting was indeed on the wall. These matinée cheapo's were about to be absorbed into the living room's little black box. Too bad, Holt and Martin didn't work out a TV deal like, say, the Cisco Kid or Gene Autry. Anyway, about the only memorable part of this 60-minutes, is a leading lady who maybe can't decide on a stage name, but can sure shoot a gun.
