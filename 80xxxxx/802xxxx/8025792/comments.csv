so he went out of his way to reupload someone elses workaround after creating a new account on a free file sharing website...like i wouldnt even bother complaining about such trash on TPB but come on this guy probably doesn't seed, and he is so impatient to the point of going out of his way to do all this work...lmfao people."

I have had this account for quite some time and I noticed the mod that I was using was not on here so I simply uploaded it, a matter of maybe 5 minutes. And I clearly stated it was not mine, I'm not taking credit for it, maybe you should calm yourself, it's the internet. So I don't understand how I really ""went out of my way""."
