This will remove the Razor1911 splash screen on GTA 4 startup

There is one like this uploaded by "Anarith" but that replaces the splash with another one. This file takes the splash out and starts the game immediately without viewing another splash screen.

I do not take credit for this modification, I have been using it for some time and saw it was not available for download.
