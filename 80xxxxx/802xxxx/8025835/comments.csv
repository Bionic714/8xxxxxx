A Message from Daryl

Hi Everybody:

I guess you are wondering why there is no show.  We're going on a production hiatus and we'll be back with new episodes soon.  In the meantime, keep on watching the past episodes here and on Palladia (11pm EST every Thursday night).

Thanks for all of your support and keep on telling everybody how much you love the show.

And, see you soon.

Daryl"
