One survivor of a seemingly failed robbery is left without any memory of what happened -- and has no idea who he is. Unable to move and kept alive by a machine, his frustration and desperation drive him to reconstruct what may have happened.

The unremembered mission was simple: steal a briefcase from a safe deposit box then meet his co-conspirators at a derelict depot outside of town. The thieves, with code names mysteriously drawn from the exploits of the tale of Peter Pan, needed only to wait until midnight to collect their payment.
But something went wrong.

This survivor is left with a frantic search for answers as he haphazardly attempts to remember what happened. Did anyone else survive?

What happened to the briefcase? How much of this is from his damaged memory and how much is made up?

Who is he?

And what on earth does all of this have to do with Hollywood?
