Try to find some Hudson Brothers I had no luck so I added three singles I collected way back when.
I just learn that that brothers where sign to Elton john's label Rocket Records and that some of his band members perform on various tracks and even had some tracks produced by Bernie Taupin Rendezvous included here was one of them


 1 - So you are a star 128kbps
 
 2 - Rendezvous 128kbps

 3 - Sweet Cindy 160kbps (shown in files as just sweet but I.m guessing thats wrong


Hope someone enjoys this file...comments are welcomed.(new at this and need the    feedback)
