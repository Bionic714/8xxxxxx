,pksource,2013-02-23T22:22Z,"Great episode, nice plot so far. Storyline is intelligent and i wouldn't change it even a bit. Quality - A10 V10. I usually watch everything at film.plotar.org	because they always have HD but they don't have tv shows so having TPB for TVshows is great, thnx!"
,thomasnikolaii,2013-05-04T15:59Z,"@ironspine68 
Technically ""indians"" are asians, so this show includes everyone. So i agree with you: How the fuck is this show racist? "
