Mary Crawford has joined her father's project but is proving to be cut from the same cloth as her grandfather as she is quite vicious and will stop at nothing to succeed. The scientists believe they have found a way to block signals from the implant. Charlie and Lisa meet quite by accident in a group therapy session and after subsequently undergoing hypnotherapy, realize that Charlie is the father of Lisa's 9-year old daughter Allie. When an emotionally unstable member of the therapy group shoots Charlie and takes all of the others hostage, Allie demonstrates remarkable powers. In order to save everyone however, Allie agrees to go with Mary Crawford.
