[V],TorrentTracts,2013-01-23T22:27Z,"Kjostid, that Arms Length Away album that you're talking about is called ""Because You're The One I'll Carry With Me"", right?  If so, it's a 2012 release.  I've moved onto 2013 releases now."
[V],TorrentTracts,2013-01-23T22:29Z,"Mr_emito, that new Xth album you're looking for by Sho Baraka will be included in my very next 2013 bundle.  So far I have about a gig worth of the bundle accumulated.  And, as you know, I bundle two gigs at a time.  So it should be torrented soon."
[V],TorrentTracts,2013-01-23T22:30Z,"Clardx1, I was never able to find those albums for you back in 2012.  Sorry about that.  :("
,syncnd,2013-01-24T18:22Z,"Hey, T...could you upload Joyous Celebration's discography? Thanks."
[V],TorrentTracts,2013-01-27T21:52Z,"Syncnd, I checked my collection for ""Joyous Celebration"" and I only have one of their albums.  I believe they have about 14 or 15 in total, so 1 disc would hardly make a discography.  Sorry about that.  :("
