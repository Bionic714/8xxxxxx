2013 - THE YEAR IN CHRISTIAN MUSIC
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Another year, another reason to honor God.  Amen?

As with the past two years of gathering together music for all of you to sample, it's my continued prayer that you will turn to your Bible for God's Word, and only tune into this music supplementary to that.  I also pray that you share this music with your family and friends, support those Artists whom songs find a regular home within your collection, continue to seed for perhaps a little longer than you might normally would, and above all else, give the glory to God where it rightfully and righteously belongs.

That being said, let's start 2013 right.  There are 26 titles being shared today.  Grab it all if you want to, but if you're genre specific, and looking for Pop, we have Adam Gilley and Capital Kings. If you're looking for some Praise And Worship we have Andy Park, Bluetree, Hillsong United, Hymns Collective, and Planetshakers to choose from. How about Contemporary?  Chris Tomlin, Jason Castro, and Kim Walker. There's a lot of Hip-Hop / Rap being shared today including CJ Luckey, Crossover, Forgiven, Je'kob, Ruslan, Skrip, and SOC. Are you looking for some Christian Hardcore? How about Defy Tolerance, and Overcome. Techno we have DJ Cmd. Rock we have Elizabeth South, Twenty One Pilots, and Vota in this bundle. Singer / Songwriter we have Ryan Delmore. And for Gospel there's The Tri-City Singers.
