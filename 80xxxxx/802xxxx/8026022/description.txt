"Emily and... The Social Experiment"

After a year long absence, Dr. A.J. Aquino 
returns to Denver Memorial, but before he can 
rejoin the staff, the Chief insists that he 
make peace with Dr. Bandari. Emily is tasked 
with treating a patient who claims to be a 
psychic, and is convinced that her tarot cards 
predict her own impending death. Elsewhere, 
Cassandra and Dr. Bandari treat a patient who 
needs a lung transplant, but Micah's discovery 
of a new medical issue leaves the patient with 
a tough decision. Meanwhile, Emily decides to 
test her theory that Will was jealous of her 
recent date, so Tyra offers to teach Emily how 
to flirt.
