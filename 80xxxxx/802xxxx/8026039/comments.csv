[T],theburningbush,2013-03-22T19:15Z,"The 8 unaired ""Apartment 23"" eps will air in Oz

This is a ""heads-up"" post to the amazing crew of torrent uploaders...

The last 8 episodes of ""Don't Trust the B---- in Apartment 23"" that ABC has yet to air after it unceremoniously cancelled the series are scheduled to be shown on Australia's Arena channel on Mondays beginning March 25.

There are many Apartment 23 fans who would be very grateful if these become available at TPB!

Ref: http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2013/03/aren...re-us.html

The FOXTEL TV Guide at http://www.foxtel.com.au/whats-on/tv-guide confirms that at least the first 2 unaired eps, ""The Leak..."" and ""Monday June,"" are scheduled for broadcast on Arena on March 25 and April 1, respectively.

Many, many TIA to anyone who UL's these last 8 eps!!"

I hope so. That's why I wrote: ""There are many Apartment 23 fans who would be very grateful if these become available at TPB!...Many, many TIA to anyone who UL's these last 8 eps!!""

I've certainly seen many items at TPB that were cap'd from the Oz channel ""Arena."" I hope these Apt 23 eps are as well."
