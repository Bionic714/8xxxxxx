,smokeym1,2013-03-03T05:54Z,"Wont patch, OR authenticate. Garbage"
,Deathrock_Sean,2013-03-12T18:20Z,"Confirmed 100% working. Use maximum attention while patching. I'm not explaining anything for the n00bs that are complaining, pull your eyes out of your ass.

,Daikataro,2013-03-28T02:23Z,"WORKING 100% If you're so stupid as to be unable to follow the clear instructions provided, you're too stupid to correctly use the software anyway."
,omega1147,2013-04-23T12:04Z,"100% Working I agree with Deathrock_Sean and Daikataro. Read the damn instructions that came with the software on how to install and activate pay the fuck attention to what you are doing and pull your eyes out of your ass. If you're so stupid as to be unable to follow the instructions provided, you're too fucking stupid to correctly use the software anyway. 

The Instructions could have used better English and grammar but nothing and no one is perfect.

After install and activation and before you connect back to the internet run the app go to preferences and uncheck use net notify close and reconnect to the net you can now use this app while connected to the net with out blocking it with a firewall but still not a bad idea just in case.

Respect 2 Digital Insanity & Ching_Liu Thank you very much!! I have used soundforge for years even when sonic foundry still made it."

,elasher,2013-04-25T22:47Z,"aaaand nevermind i figured it out, was just on the wrong program is all. Working 100%!!!!"
,VictorFS,2013-05-07T02:45Z,"Hi guys, I got a problem with patching can you help me?
I downloaded sound forge 10 from another link. The patch wasn’t working, so I downloaded this. Stills not working, I uninstalled the program, downloaded the program from this link, and installed again (internet off, of course). Then I opened the patch, selected the program, clicked patch. After selecting the folder, always appears an error: “an error occurred while patching the file(s)!”. I tried alternating the directory order and folders (between sony folder, Sound forge, and shared plug-in ones) and the version of the program (the two options for sound forge 10, then the options for s.f. 9), then turning the anti-virus off and running the application, but nothing worked! What the fuck is wrong here?"

,Spitfirecy,2013-05-09T10:53Z,i have a problem.. i followed all the steps one by one but my keygen application doesnt open even when i try to open it as admin.. anyone know how to fix this?
,heres_johnny,2013-05-12T22:31Z,"This just worked flawessly. The instructions in the PDF document can't be any simpler. Just read the damn thing slowly and carefully. Easy to install and fast torrent. Don't forget to disconnect from Internet before starting the installation procedure.

To block all program connections and prevent activation issues in Windows, go to advanced firewall settings and create an outbound firewall rule. Browse the executable and block all connections.

Thank you very much, uploader. Gonna seed till 1.00 share ratio, enjoy!"
