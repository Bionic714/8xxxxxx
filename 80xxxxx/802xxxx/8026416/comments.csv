,SmokeShadows,2013-01-16T23:18Z,"So, iv got a question... iv been following your downloads for a while now, and iv downloaded all of the various versions of this app (epsxe) so far and installed with no probs, what ill do is i would normally download them, put them in a folder on my memcard and then install using a file manager, it would normally ask ""replace application"" overwrite user data ect.  and they would usually install with out a hitch, but for some reason this time it tells me "" Application not installed, an existing package by the same name with a conflicting signature is already installed"" now im not too sure what this means, i dont want to try to uninstall it because im afraid of losing all of my saved data and everything, what would you recommend? or is there something im doing wrong? or is it just something on the epsxe devs end? please help me! and thanks for everything hobbitwarez!"
,SmokeShadows,2013-01-16T23:32Z,"So iv been following your posts for a while now, and i seem to be having some difficulty with this one, maybe you or someone could help me out? heres my situation, everytime i downloaded previous versions of epsxe and tried to install, it would say ""replace application, overwrite userdata"" ect, so i would and it would install flawless, but for some reason after i hit ok install anyways it tells me ""application not installed, an existing application by the same name with a conflicting signature is already installed"" im not too sure what this means but i dont want to uninstall my app because im afraid of losing my savedata and everything, i just want to update my already installed version, if it comes down to it ill just try that anyways but i want to avoid that at any cost lol got any suggestions on how to get around this?? thanks in advance"

[H],shirepirate,2013-01-17T01:28Z,"@SmokeShadows

when you get the conflicting signature message, the previous app must be uninstalled. there is always an easy way to backup saved data, though. just look through the ePSXe folder to find it, then replace it after new install."
,ShareMo,2013-02-25T06:00Z,Nice app.  Thanks.

,Hednoize,2013-04-19T01:50Z,I see it still wants the android permission to contact license server. Is that somehow cracked/disabled in this torrent despite that permission being required?
,Hednoize,2013-04-19T01:55Z,It requires permission for some license check. Is that cracked/disabled in this torrent despite the app asking for that permission?
