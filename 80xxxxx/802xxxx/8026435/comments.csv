What is this Supernatural for Ants?"
,spyderx810,2013-01-17T07:49Z,"Sorry I may have been a bit hard, I can only imagine you took the 220MB x264/350MB xvid or the raws (either or) and converted them to something like 150-200 kbps X264 / 32 ac3, now that I think about it. While it may be fairly watchable, quality is truely out the window at that point (I know,  I've done the conversion). I assume this is for those who are lacking in bandwidth (Australia an Canada and those others with bandwidth caps)."
