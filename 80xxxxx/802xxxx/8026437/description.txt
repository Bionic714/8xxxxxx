Fresh off the OWSLA Nest's press. Enjoy.

"Hello World!

I would like to start off by thanking The Nest for releasing this intimate funk ep, and Drip.FM bringing a fresh platform for new music and artists to be heard. I would also like to thank the OWSLA family for being the most awesome group of creative minds in dance music. 

Funk Files Vol.1 is a collection of songs I have created inspired by my obsession with Funk and Electronic music. I hope you enjoy the Funk!

Keep It Groovy,

Jason Justice"
