Stereoscopic 3D Motion Graphics Workshop
Create a Striking Title Sequence
 
In this workshop, youΓÇÖll work along with Angie Taylor as she uses After Effects to create a title sequence in stereoscopic 3D. Along the way youΓÇÖll learn the fundamentals of how stereoscopy works and how After Effects creates the illusion of depth in a moving image. YouΓÇÖll also see how to combine 2D tracking and some basic 3D animation to create a 3D tracking effect, and how to work with effects, transparency, and styles. After completing this workshop youΓÇÖll understand the complete workflow involved in creating stereo 3D, from setting up a stereo 3D rig, to compositing footage and adjusting settings, to adding finishing touches like depth of field and motion blur.
