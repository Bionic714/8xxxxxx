Not long after our newest Tuts+ site, Webdesigntuts+, launched, they posted an excellent tutorial that details the process of designing a warm and cheerful home page in Photoshop. After high demand, weΓÇÖll take that completed design and convert it into a standards-compliant HTML and CSS web page. Along the way, weΓÇÖll review a variety of nifty techniques that will help you to improve your own workflow.
Even better, when we hit 80,000 RSS subscribers, weΓÇÖll take things even further and convert the finished product into a custom WordPress theme.
Rather than overload you with a massive 4-5 part series all at once, IΓÇÖll post a new episode in this miniseries every day. ItΓÇÖs my hope that, if youΓÇÖre at the point in your career where you can benefit from a series like this, youΓÇÖll work along with me each lesson.
