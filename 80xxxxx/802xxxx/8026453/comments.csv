,Fegan,2013-01-16T11:07Z,the audio and video are out of synch by a few seconds. Not worth downloading.
[T],SCSA420,2013-01-16T12:50Z,NO they are not out of sync because I just copied the mp4 file to a 8 GB USB flash drive and connected it to my LG 3D BluRay player and it plays perfectly here. Obviously the problem is on your end not mine.
,Fegan,2013-01-16T13:05Z,"Sorry for my previous comment.  This file plays perfectly on my computer via VLC, so my blue ray player must be at fault. Apologies for my wrong criticism of the file."
