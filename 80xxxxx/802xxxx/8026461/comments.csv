,eryqqp,2013-02-02T07:38Z,This asks you to upgrade to Bitcomet after you have downloaded it. It isn't the series I expected or maybe I just needed to use bitcomet to download it. but it should tell you that!!!
,verified-vidz,2013-02-03T05:43Z,its the whole series wtf...works fine for me!!

Don't waste your time."
,CaptPeacock,2013-04-05T17:20Z,"Oh, forgot to tell ya... website urls keep popping up onscreen, no way to get rid of them.  I don't know if this happens in all episodes, I got just the first one, but it's just another reason not to get this one! "
,CaptPeacock,2013-04-05T17:23Z,"This is only 320x240.  I wouldn't bother.  I looked at the first one.  It has urls hardcoded.  No way to get rid of them.  

A waste of time."
