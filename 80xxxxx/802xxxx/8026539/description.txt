Name says it all.

This torrent is "as is"  which means I do not promise any support. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK !!!

I use legit Norton and it didn't detect any threat but this is not my patch so I don't guarantee it. 

Here is the Virus total report which TO ME it seems like false positive:

I strongly recommend to use sandboxie to apply the patch and then just recover the patched files. This is what I do and had no issues.



Enjoy!
