,dragonFyr,2013-01-17T23:35Z,"Brilliant show...so far it has a great plot that is really dark and horrific. If I still acid, this would be one of those shows I'd watch while tripping."
,JustRacey,2013-01-18T08:21Z,"The torrent is absolutely fine, but I totally disagree with dragonFyr and micron66. I can normally force myself to at least wath a full episode of a new shows premire, but I barely made it thru 1/2 of this one before deciding to delete this from my hard drive. This is NOT worth downloading and NOT worth watching. I'd rather go to the dentist and have a root canal than have to sit thru any more of this show."
,Sup3rCh1p,2013-01-18T16:11Z,"@ Justracy- the first half of this was a bit aimless but you seriously missed out by not watching the rest. Top show, definitely worth watching"
,kinvore,2013-01-21T10:35Z,"Wow, I love this show already.  Refreshingly original, visually intriguing, quirky, and compelling.  Not for the Honey Boo Boo crowd."
,Mister22,2013-02-04T17:13Z,"Could have been good, but deleted it when the race mixing scene came along, with the British woman and African man (Are there any other ways they portray racemixing?). Somehow all British TV-series made the last 10 years always put in a racemixing couple or sex-scenes with an interracial couple. 

STOP IT!

Race mixing is NOT NORMAL! It WILL destroy our countries!

Antiracist is just a codeword for anti-white.

,Deathspanka,2013-02-19T15:36Z,"@Mister22 - Black, white, yellow, or other colours on our skin does not matter because we are all homo sapiens = human 

I hope you be colour blind and se life from another perspective. 

You typed and i quote ""Race mixing is NOT NORMAL! It WILL destroy our countries!"" That is qualified bullshit, you know that if you have any brains left. 

You have forgotten where your Ancestors came from and that is sad to see. Spread love instead ..

Love
