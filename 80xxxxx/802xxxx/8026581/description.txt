Book Description
CSS is messy. At least, it always seems to get messy as projects and teams grow in size. If youΓÇÖve ever battled specificity issues by throwing ΓÇ£important!ΓÇ¥ at them, or found the components of your site so increasingly intertwined that youΓÇÖre afraid to change anything, then this book is for you. If youΓÇÖve ever come into a project and found yourself confused by the existing code, then this book is for your co-workers. Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS explores techniques that can make your sites more manageable.

A flexible guide to developing sites small and large. Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS (or SMACSS, pronounced ΓÇ£smacksΓÇ¥, for short) is more style guide than rigid framework. ThereΓÇÖs no library within here for you to download or install. SMACSS is a way to examine your design process and as a way to fit those rigid frameworks into a flexible thought process. ItΓÇÖs an attempt to document a consistent approach to site development when using CSS. And really, who isnΓÇÖt building a site with CSS these days?!

Learn about the four types of CSS rules for state-based design, and how this approach to development can make it easier to work on larger sites and with larger teams.
