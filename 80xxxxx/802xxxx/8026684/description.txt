Here we got the final update of ESET Smart Security . I recommend you read some of the important notes attached into the article about ESET products.

ESET Smart Security - offers advanced detection technologies and multi-layered security features.

If your antivirus detects as virus to any of the programs, MiNODLogin and / or MiNODServer, do the following:
- Disable the antivirus (in some cases is not necessary).
- Install MiNODLogin and / or MiNODServer.
- In Advanced Settings, in the Exclusions option, add the folders where
have been installed (by default, in the eset folder C:Program FilesESETMinodxxx).
- If the antivirus has sent the files to the quarantine, restore them.
