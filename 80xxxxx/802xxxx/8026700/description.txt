Premise (according to Wiki):

The series focuses on Dr. Jason Cole (Steven Pasquale), a successful neurosurgeon 

with a secret. Every night at 8:25pm, Cole is switched into an alternate personality 

named Ian Price. Cole has been able to hide Price by sipping a strong pharmaceutical 

mixture but due to recent events, that's no longer the case. Cole's alternate 

personality is focused only on creating obstacles for Cole to endure, which could 

cost him his life, romance and career. The series is a modern take on the classic 

Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde story.
