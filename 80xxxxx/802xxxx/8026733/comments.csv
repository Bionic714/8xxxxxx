,dermaph,2013-01-20T00:02Z,"thanks for all the quality ups mate.
any chance you'd snag and up the podcasts each week too?"
,themismatch,2013-01-21T18:56Z,"Week 37: pastebin(.)com/d9RFz1sW

And I don't access to the podcasts. If someone is willing to set up a pot and we each put in like a dollar, we could rip *all* the content (Q&As, uncuts, podcasts, etc.)"
,Demonsniperhd,2013-01-21T19:40Z,mismatch I appreciate your comments so much.  Thank you so much for your links for new episodes.  but I want to know how do you get this pastebin links for new weeks?? Thank you.
,themismatch,2013-01-21T20:27Z,"Demonsniperhd, I have access to a Project Go account, but it doesn't have all the features (uncuts, podcasts, and Q&As, to be specific)."
,ianqaz,2013-01-21T21:26Z,Alright guys I really want to get the Podcast and Q&As so I'm going to start this pot and see where it goes. I figure the more people we get the less we all have to pay so Email me at rtz21@ymail.com if your looking to get in.
