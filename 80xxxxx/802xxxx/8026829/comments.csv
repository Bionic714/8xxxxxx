This is a great set of torrents, and of historical value to any and all SF geeks."

,AmaHist,2013-01-16T20:00Z,"Thank you, weasel. Seeding has settled down and atm all the torrents back to 1900 are adequately seeded. I'm still watching and will reseed as necessary. The average time from initial seeding to good seeding base is about 18 hours, which is pretty good. I've learned along the way and it's going faster."
,AmaHist,2013-01-16T20:01Z,"Tyvm, Fruster. I'm pretty pleased, this is the first time I've been able to re-up a big set that people really want."
