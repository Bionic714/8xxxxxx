Book Description: Raspberry Pi: A Quick-Start Guide gives you everything you need to get the Raspberry Pi up and running and doing cool stuff. You will get started by learning what additional hardware you need and how to connect it, install Debian Linux and configure it to your needs, and customize the Pis firmware to get the most out of your hardware. Then the fun begins. You will connect the Pi to your home network and try surfing the web and tweeting messages. You will learn how to get the most out of Midori, the Pis standard browser. Then in a few simple steps you will turn the Pi into a kiosk system that displays Twitter live search information. You will also learn how you can control the desktops of other PCs in your house with the Pi. Once you have the basics down, you will explore the Pis versatility with a series of home projects. Turn it into a web server in your home network. Convert the Pi into a powerful multimedia center so you can watch high-definition video and listen to your favorite music. Play classic video games. Then use the GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi to build electronics projects such as an out of memory alarm, and learn how to access the project using a web browser. Power to the Pi!
