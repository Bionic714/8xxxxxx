[T],FatFreddy638,2013-01-16T09:40Z,this should be labeled episode 3 sorry. Itunes named the special episode at the beginning of the Season episode 1 and has been naming them put of sync ever since. This job is really annoying sometimes trying to keep track of everything

,.h.264,2013-03-07T10:35Z,"You have uploaded two S03E04's, both different content. Why aren't you taking down the incorrect one then? Apparently counting is too difficult for Dance Moms watchers; you can tell the quality of demographic that must be into this show if they can't even get SXXEYY right. It's fucking annoying being a non-mentally-handicapped fan of the series. .__."
