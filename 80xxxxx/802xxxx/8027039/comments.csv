First of all, you are welcome for appreciating my work.

Dude, encoding is not a fast process. It takes time to download the source, encode it and upload it. Season 5 will probably get added today. Have some patience just like others are waiting. We also have a life of our own. Each and every season will get added in due time. Don't worry :)"
