Game info:
~~~~~~~~~~
Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is an open-world action role-playing game set
in Amalur, a mysterious and magical new fantasy world created by New York
Times bestselling author R. A. Salvatore. Brought to life visually through
the trademark style of renowned artist and Spawn creator Todd McFarlane,
Reckoning brings a new level of visual style and visceral action combat to
the RPG genre. The game is being developed under the leadership of Ken
Rolston, lead designer of the critically acclaimed RPGs Elder Scrolls III:
Morrowind and Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion.

Reckoning combines intense third-person action combat with deep exploration,
expansive character development and customization, and immersive
storytelling in an extraordinarily detailed fantasy universe. Gamers begin
their journey when they miraculously rise from the dead, wielding dangerous
new magic capable of changing the very Fate of Amalur. Thrust into a brutal
war between multiple races, factions, and alliances, players vie for the
secrets of their immortality and the ancient evil that threatens to consume
the world.

The lore of Kingdoms of Amalur spans an epic course of 10,000 years of
history created by R. A. Salvatore. Reckoning captures a moment in this
history, the tale of a singular hero capable of reshaping the fate of the
world of Amalur. Every building, tree, and creature has a clear and defined
history within this immersive world filled with extraordinary landscapes,
mysterious cities, colorful characters, and fantastic creatures inspired by
the legendary art style of Todd McFarlane.
