Light Flow allows you to take control of your notification LED colors and makes them successively flash one color after another. 

It also allows you to set repeating sounds on vibration patterns for you notifications. You can also set a "sleep" mode or "on charge" where the lights and/or sounds and vibrations will not be heard or seen. If you've come from a Blackberry device and miss the features of BeBuzz / BerryBuzz then give LightFlow a try!

This program will allow you to control the notification color for the over 250 applications and system events such as:
 * Missed calls
 * Voice mail
 * Calendar reminders 
 * gmail
 * email
 * SMS messages
 * MMS messages
 * Low battery
 * No signal
 * Google talk
 * Facebook
 * Twitter
 ...and many many more


This is a fully working version...
