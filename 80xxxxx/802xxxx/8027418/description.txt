Hi,

Do not expect too much from the January Playlists. Its like the artists still are digesting their short holidays. The music lacked the creativity, innovation and inspiration it normally has.

I am always looking for best quality (sound) songs that really tell you something, give you something, instead of mainly drawing attention to them selves. In short, I am not looking for artists which make music, instead I am looking for music that makes the artists. I listened a lot but did not find too much (So, some old favorites I heard recently are included.)

I added 1 second of silence between the songs; feels more at ease. Less jumpy and still quick enough to carry over some feeling (charge) from one song to the next.

Enjoy
