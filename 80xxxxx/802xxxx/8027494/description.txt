Distinguished Journalist Mr. Robert Fisk.

A collection of documentaries (Beirut to Bosnia),
lectures/speeches and conversations.

Please enjoy one of the best journalists of our age,
telling a truth.


Unthinkers, please switch back to the opium of Fox news;

Hate-commenting is not a virtue.
