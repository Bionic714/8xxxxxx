Hi,

Inspired by a request of a radio station to make a Trance show I made a playlist containing 30 songs and cut this in five peaces of about 25 to 35 minutes which can be played in a row as well as separately. A kind of building blocks (111-115). Really cool.

EnjoyΓÇª


111 Roadtest (Pure Trance)

01 Andrew Rayel (Aeon Of Revenge (Radio Edit))
02 Juventa (Roadtest (Original Mix))
03 Swedish House Maffia (Greyhound)
04 The Glass (Superhero (Ursula 1000 Remix))
05 Psilocybian (Flippin Mental)
06 Billy The Kit (Booster)
