 The Paris-based imprint was founded back in 2006 by Agoria, Alexandre Cazac and Yannick Matray, and has become an outpost for wide range of music, from the experimental work of Apparat and Danton Eeprom's electro to the neo-classical compositions of pianist Francesco Tristano.
 To help celebrate the label's sixth birthday, InFiné approached French musician Jean Michel Jarre and asked him to curate his favourite material from the imprint's back catalogue.
 Jarre is himself a pioneering electronic music artist with over three decades of experience, including classic and influential albums like 1976's Oxygene and 1978's Equinoxe.
 Among the 12 tracks Jarre picked are French producers Oxia and Rone. All tracks on the collection have been previously released.
