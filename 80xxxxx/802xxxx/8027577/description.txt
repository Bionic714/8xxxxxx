"The Dark Angels were the first Legion of Space Marines, genetically modified superhuman warriors created by the Emperor himself. Since fighting at the forefront of the Great Crusade, at the dawn of the Age of the Imperium, the Dark Angels have battled against Mankind's most terrible enemies. Now, over 10,000 years later, the Dark Angels still heroically serve Mankind."

In addition to full, OCRed codex I've included "FrankenDex" made from trimmed down iPad version.

Mind You this add-on is *not* complete set of rules as it lacks "fluff" pages with unique entries, yet it's still useable for list building and stats/special rules reference.

Also works with *every* device capable of displaying PDFs, unlike iPad version.
