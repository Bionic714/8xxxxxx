Originally written by Mike Geiger, Woody Mullis, and Michael Hoffman.  This track was recorded by my good friend Ryan Foltz, who was also the engineer and producer on the Rancid song ΓÇÿCivilian Ways.ΓÇÖ It features a talented group of Cleveland musicians called The Ohio Ramblers.  I love Zydeco music and wanted to record something inspired by the works of Clifton Chenier, RockinΓÇÖ Dopsie, and Buckwheat Zydeco.
