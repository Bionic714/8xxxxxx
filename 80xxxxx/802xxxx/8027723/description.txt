Written in the spirit of my work with Operation Ivy and the British Oi! band Cock Sparrer, I wrote this song during the financial bailout of Wall Street addressing the idea of hard times and importance of standing by your friends.  I dug out my old Seville for this one and ran it through a Mesa Boogie amp, the same set-up I used in Op Ivy. The Bivona brothers from the Interrupters are my backing band, Jesse on drums and Kevin on guitar and bass.  Originally released on the ΓÇÿRock N Roll TheaterΓÇÖ album that accompanied ΓÇÿDanteΓÇÖ in April 2012.
