Lip Up Fatty-This is the third 2 Tone era song that weΓÇÖve done so far.  I first saw Bad Manners while I was in high school-when they played the Berkeley Keystone in 1983.  A lot of the punk rock kids went to that show, and it was so cool to see punks, mods, and skaters all under one roof getting along and loving ska music.
