Originally released in 1973, this song was written by Ronnie Lane and Ron Wood for the FacesΓÇÖ third album, also called ΓÇÿOoh La La.ΓÇÖ As soon as Travis Barker heard my demo for this song, he wanted to play on it, we recorded at his studio the next day and made the video the day after. I have a long working relationship with both Travis and J Bonner. J is my favorite reggae bass player that IΓÇÖve played with and worked with me on PoetΓÇÖs Life and the Jimmy Cliff album. Travis is in the Transplants with me. IΓÇÖm so fortunate to get to play with these guys. In the video, thereΓÇÖs a shot of me standing on a garbage can on the corner of Durant and Telegraph, in the distance you can see the church where my parents were married in 1958. This song is dedicated to my dad Don Armstrong 1931-2012
