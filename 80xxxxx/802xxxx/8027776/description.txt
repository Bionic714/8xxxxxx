Hi,

Inspired by a request of a radio station to make a Trance show I made a playlist containing 30 songs and cut this in five peaces of about 25 to 35 minutes which can be played in a row as well as separately. A kind of building blocks (111-115). Really cool.

Enjoy...


112 Sweat (Pure Trance)

01 Snoop Doggy Dogg Ft. David Guetta (Sweat)
02 Markus Schulz vs Ferry Corsten (Loops & Tings (Radio Edit))
03 Above & Beyond Presents Tranquility Base (Razorfish (Jerome Isma-Ae Remix))
