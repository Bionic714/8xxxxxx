,jeffreyarmani,2013-01-20T21:07Z,"it works at first then it starts crashing, picture goes crazy and everything, i think the game's damaged"
,KoenStrider,2013-01-30T10:54Z,"Same here.  The game loads, music starts playing but screen is not working properly.  Flickers, broken, ..."
,Majormonk,2013-01-30T19:35Z,do you know if there's a fix for the screen flickering because it happens to me too
,retry4z,2013-02-04T05:42Z,"Hmm, it works for me... I set it up through Wineskin Winery, so maybe some files are missing here. You can do it yourself though, just download wineskin and a windows version of risk II, and follow these steps: http://wineskin.urgesoftware.com/tiki-index.php?page=Manual+6.1+Wrapper+for+Wine+Notepad"
,retry4z,2013-02-04T05:49Z,this is the Wineskin version I used: mediafire dot com/download.php?as33soc56cuqb0a
