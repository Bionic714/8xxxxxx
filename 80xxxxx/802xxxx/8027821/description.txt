IΓÇÖve always loved Social Distortion, and Mike Ness is a great songwriter. Rancid and Social D. have a historyΓÇª Mike played guitar onstage with Rancid at Roseland in New York in 1996, and Matt Freeman played bass with Social D. on tour. We used to love seeing Johnny Two Bags play in Cadillac Tramps, and during his stint in U.S. Bombs. You can see how intertwined we are.
