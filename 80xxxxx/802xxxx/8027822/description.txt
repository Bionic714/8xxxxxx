DJs in the 60s, from the UK would bypass playing the smoother R&B from Tamla/Motown, and would instead choose to play artists on labels like Okeh, Champion and CameoΓÇô rarer records on labels that would churn dance floors with their harder sound. We love to play songs that have a big strong back beat that moves quick. Northern Soul!
