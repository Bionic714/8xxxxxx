ShakinΓÇÖ up Orange Street- the street with a beat, in 1964 was Jamaican ska singer, and heavyweight producer Prince Buster, a musical pioneer. I love the story that Prince Buster was security for Coxsone DoddΓÇÖs ΓÇÿDownbeatΓÇ¥ sound system. He was hired because he was a boxer. If anybody wanted to smash CoxsoneΓÇÖs sound system, youΓÇÖd have to get through Prince Buster first. He was super influential with the 2 Tone movement ΓÇö Madness ΓÇ£One Step BeyondΓÇ¥, and ΓÇ£MadnessΓÇ¥, are Prince Buster Songs, plus The Specials- ΓÇ£Enjoy YourselfΓÇ¥, ΓÇ£Judge DreadΓÇ¥and ΓÇ£Al CaponeΓÇ¥, to name a fewΓÇôand weΓÇÖre doing ΓÇ£Thirty Pieces Of SilverΓÇ¥.
