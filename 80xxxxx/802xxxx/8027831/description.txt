I remember being ten, and buying a single called ΓÇ£Blinded By The LightΓÇ¥ by Manfred MannΓÇÖs Earth band. I played this song over and over again until I drove my brothers crazy.
ΓÇÿBlinded By The LightΓÇÖ was written by Bruce Springsteen. So I guess IΓÇÖve loved Bruce SpringsteenΓÇÖs music since I was ten. This song, ΓÇÿIΓÇÖm GoinΓÇÖ DownΓÇÖ is one of BruceΓÇÖs saddest songs.
