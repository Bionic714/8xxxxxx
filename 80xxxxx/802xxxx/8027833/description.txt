This song came out on Bob DylanΓÇÖs Blood On The Tracks album, one of my favorite tracks of all time, and DylanΓÇÖs one of my favorite artists. IΓÇÖve seen Dylan a few times and when he sings he changes the melodyΓÇô the chords stay the same but the melody is completely different from the original version. Nikola, a good friend of ours from Paris, who passed away a few years ago, loved Bob Dylan. Nikola said when you see Dylan live you have to disengage your way of thinking, donΓÇÖt judge it, and just listen to the song as if it was a totally new piece of art. Yes, IΓÇÖm with Nikola on that.
