Louis Jordan and the Tympany Five was a BIG time R&B, jazz and dance band, put together by Jordan in 1938. They had a smokinΓÇÖ rhythm and horn section. This one was done in 1946. It spent 18 weeks on top of the R&B charts, and peaked at number seven on the national chart. The band AND this song were a big hit with everyone. The tune is a jump blues, that was written by country songwriters Denver Darling, who was known as a ΓÇ£hillbillyΓÇ¥ songwriter and guitarist, and Vaughn Horton, who wrote a hit called ΓÇ£MockinΓÇÖ Bird HillΓÇ¥, and Milt Gabler, who ran Decca Records, and was Louis JordanΓÇÖs record producer. Even though the song came out in the 40ΓÇ▓s, (a decade before rock and roll happened) itΓÇÖs a predecessor. And, because of all those wonderful influences of Country, Jazz and R&B, in it, the record could be on the list for being one of the first rock and roll songs.
