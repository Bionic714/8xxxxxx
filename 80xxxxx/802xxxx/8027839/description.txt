Critter v2 #4
The life of a super hero is one of constant checks and balances and Critter is feeling the heat from all sides as a beast rampages through town and she runs smack dab into the In Crowd!

Critter v2 #5
Critter has just barely gotten to break in her updated costume before she is hit with a mystery from beyond the grave. This special issue tells us just what happened to the former Josie who was killed during a scaffolding collapse at a concert hall. Secrets begin to unravel. Is Critter strong enough to handle the truth?

Critter v2 #6
After learning the shocking real story behind the death of the original Josie, Critter has taken to the streets in an attempt to clean up the super villain mess that Tidepool unleashed with his attack on the high security prisons a few months ago. But Critter is just one person and with her disconnection with Purrrfection, who will step up and help her set her destiny back on course?

Critter v2 #7
Purrrfection is going through difficult times of late and there's only one thing that might pull them together - a road trip! Critter and the gang head to Las Vegas for an event at the Babylon Hotel and Casino.
