This was done at Ryan FoltzΓÇÖs place in Cleveland with the Ohio Ramblers. IΓÇÖve heard three versions of this song, and I dig them all. One is by Tony Allen and The Champs from the 50s, another is by Bobby Paris, which was a Northern Soul hit in the 60ΓÇ▓s, and thereΓÇÖs a great reggae version by Horace Andy from the early 70s. Our rhythm is like the Bobby Paris version, and our chorus is more like Tony AllenΓÇÖs. If I ever met Horace, IΓÇÖd ask him what version he was influenced by. I feel this is the kinda song where everyone adds something to every new version as it floats down the river of music. Our addition to the ΓÇÿNight OwlΓÇÖ was our call and response Outro.
