Every time we play this song it comes out a little different. We never know how itΓÇÖs gonna land ΓÇö but thatΓÇÖs what makes it fun though.  I added a harmonica to it, for an acoustic show I did for the nice people at Guitar Center. This version has the Hutton Brothers, and Kevin Bivona playing on it, and it features a glockenspiel and plate reverb, which gives it a Phil Spector-ish vibe.
