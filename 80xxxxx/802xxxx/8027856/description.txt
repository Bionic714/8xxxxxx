This song harkens back to the 80s when I became friends with many of the DJs at KALX in Berkeley. I could walk one block up from Telegraph Avenue, onto Bowditch Street, and just like that, I was in the coolest radio station on the planet, and could request a song. Their vinyl library was massiveΓÇôPunk, Reggae, Hip Hop, Soul .. you name it. My early music education came from hanging out there. The first time I heard any great band, I heard it on that station.
Operation Ivy played live at KALX in 1987. We just had two microphones in the studio ΓÇö two DJ mics. One to mic the band, and the second mic was used for the vocals. KALX now actually resides on the Cal Berkeley campus. I still love to listen to it whenever in the East Bay.
