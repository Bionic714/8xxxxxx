This is a ska version of the DrifterΓÇÖs song, ΓÇ£Saturday Night At The MoviesΓÇ¥.  There have been a few reggae covers of Drifters tunes, a cover version of ΓÇÿOn BroadwayΓÇÖ recorded by Dave Barker and the Aggrovators, produced by Bunny Lee, ΓÇÿSave The Last Dance For MeΓÇÖ by the Heptones, and a version of ΓÇÿAt The ClubΓÇÖ by The Pioneers. Thanks to my brother Jeff for suggesting this song.
