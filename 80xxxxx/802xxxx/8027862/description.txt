Hi,

Inspired by a request of a radio station to make a Trance show I made a playlist containing 30 songs and cut this in five peaces of about 25 to 35 minutes which can be played in a row as well as separately. A kind of building blocks (111-115). Really cool.

Enjoy...


113 Only You (Pure Trance)

01 Havana Brown Ft. Pitbull (We Run The Night (Alternate Version))
02 Planet Perfecto Knights (Resurection (Paul Oakenfold Full On Fluoro Radio Edit))
03 Susana & Shogun (Only You (Radio Edit))
04 Benny Benassi (Spaceship (Uk Edit))
05 Yan Krow (Saxo Beach (Tribalero 4 Ibiza Remix))
