Usually, flute is not the first instrument you normally think of when it comes to reggae, but IΓÇÖm a big fan of it. The flute part on this track is inna Duke Reid Treasure Isle fashion; like John HoltΓÇÖs ΓÇ£Ali BabaΓÇ¥, and Phyllis DillonΓÇÖs ΓÇ£Love That A WomanΓÇ¥.  This song was recorded with some of the ΓÇÿEngine RoomΓÇÖ musicians, who went on to record with me and Jimmy Cliff.
