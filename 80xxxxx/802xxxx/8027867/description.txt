This song was on Elvis CostelloΓÇÖs masterpiece ΓÇÿKing Of AmericaΓÇÖ album which came out in 1986.  On this record Elvis Costello used musicians Ron Tutt (drums) Jerry Scheff (bass) and James Burton (guitar). All three also played in Elvis PresleyΓÇÖs live band from 1970-1977.  James Burton, the man with the Pink Paisley Telecaster guitar, was also  a member of ΓÇÿThe Hot BandΓÇÖ- ΓÇô who not only backed up Elvis Presley live, and in the studio, beginning in 1969, but he also backed up Gram Parsons, Emmylou Harris and Merle Haggard.  Elvis Costello recorded this at a live session at the Sound Factory in Hollywood.  Jimmy Cliff and the ΓÇÿEngine RoomΓÇÖ recorded in the same studio for JimmyΓÇÖs ΓÇÿRebirthΓÇÖ album.  When I was producing the Jimmy Cliff record last year, I couldnΓÇÖt help but think about ΓÇÿKing Of AmericaΓÇÖ, and how T Bone Burnett had all those guys play live in the studio, and how all those ΓÇ£engine roomΓÇ¥ tracks we did, were done live in that same fantastic old room.
ΓÇ£On tv they prosecute anyone whoΓÇÖs excitingΓÇ¥ is one of the strongest Elvis Costello lyrics ever.
