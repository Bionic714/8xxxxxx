ΓÇÿComing to Your RescueΓÇÖ is one of my favorite Northern Soul songs. Originally recorded in Hollywood on May 26. 1967 by the Triumphs, the producer was Larry Williams, an R&B bandleader/musical director, who also worked on tracks for Little Richard, Johnny Guitar Watson and Lloyd Price.  I used the Ohio Ramblers on mine.
