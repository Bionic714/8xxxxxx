Many of you remember the ''The Tighten-Ups" a previous Trojan series which has not been available for a number of years. CREATION ROCKERS Volume 1-6 is a ''one-off' series of some of the very best in reggae music. Each album commences with titles from the Ska era in the second half of the 1960's and works through to bang-up-to-date examples of reggae in its present form. Each one a little gem, a classic ot its time. -liner notes
