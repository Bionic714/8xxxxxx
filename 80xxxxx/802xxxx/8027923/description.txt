Hi,

Inspired by a request of a radio station to make a Trance show I made a playlist containing 30 songs and cut this in five peaces of about 25 to 35 minutes which can be played in a row as well as separately. A kind of building blocks (111-115). Really cool.

Enjoy...


114 Turn Me On (Pure Trance)

01 Shake (Cosmoon)
02 Luke Bond (Dropzone (Radio Edit))
03 Xonia (Remember)
04 Kaskade & Deadmau5 (Move For Me)
05 David Guetta Ft Nicki Minaj (Turn Me On)
06 Beat Service Ft. Emma Lock (Hiding To Nothing)
