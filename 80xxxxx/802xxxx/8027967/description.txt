Description:

Cross Before the Crown by Paul Godfrey, 2012-10-06:
No reward comes without sacrifice. What will you need to sacrifice to be saved? In a word: everything. Count the cost.

It's Not A Social Club by Paul Godfrey:
Why do you go to church? Is it to chat about the week with people? What is Church for? This sermonette answers what Church should be for a Christian.

It is a Social Club? by Ben Jones, 2012-09-26:
Often there are seeming contradictions in the bible. This is one of those times. We are not to have "undue familiarity" but we are to be "highly social". This sermon is one side of the coin and ties everything together well at the end. If you wish to understand the full balance, watch this in conjunction with It's not a social club.

FAQ - Is Jesus God by Paul Godfrey:
Possibly the most debated concept in and out of Christianity, yet biblical has a very clear answer. This will be especially helpful for the myriads of people who seem to be confused on the trinity.

FAQ - Who is the Holy Spirit by Paul Godfrey:
There are a lot of theories on the Holy Spirit, and we certainly can never have the full answer, however, there is clear enough evidence that not only does the Holy Spirit exist, but that He is a person. Watch the video for the evidence.
