Hi,

Inspired by a request of a radio station to make a Trance show I made a playlist containing 30 songs and cut this in five peaces of about 25 to 35 minutes which can be played in a row as well as separately. A kind of building blocks (111-115). Really cool.

Enjoy


115 Sundown (Pure Trance)

02 Deepwide (Lacuna (The Madison Remix))
