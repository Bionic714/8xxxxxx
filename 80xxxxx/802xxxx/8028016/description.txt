Game Description:

In Tony Hawk's Project 8, The Birdman is out looking for the top 8 skaters for his new Project and it happens that he has stopped in your city to search for the best top skaters. It is up to you to prove that you can make the cut among the 200 other people varying for the coveted 8 spots. You are start out ranked 200th with various goals set for you throughout the city including the return of classic mode from the early Tony Hawk games. 

Chances to rank up come in various different ways now. There are spray painted lines located throughout the city to mark a type of goal. Weather it is grinding a certain distance, completing Natas spins, keeping your balance while doing a manual for a certain time and distance, point combos, and trick combos. Also players can obtain missions via random strangers located throughout the city.

Players can also earn Stokens by performing tricks to impress the locals that can be found wandering around the city. Players can use these Stokens to buy additional clothing, haircut styles, shoes, tricks, and boards from the store.

New to this game is the slow motion "Nail the Trick" mode where the focus is placed on the skater's feet and the movement of the board can be controlled with both of the analog sticks to build up a huge combo score!
