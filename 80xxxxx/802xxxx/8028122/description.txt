Book Description
4 STAR DOODY'S REVIEW
"The Case Files series is well known to medical students, and this second edition for psychiatry provides an excellent review of this subject. I particularly liked the way the clinical vignettes are presented in random order, much like real-life scenarios. The clinical pearls are very helpful, and the answers explaining the diagnoses excellent and thorough. Students should strongly consider carrying this book with them while doing their rotation in psychiatry."--Doody's Review Service
