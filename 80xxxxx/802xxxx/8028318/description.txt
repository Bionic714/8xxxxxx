It's Not A Social Club by Paul Godfrey:

It is a Social Club? by Ben Jones, 2012-09-26:
Often there are seeming contradictions in the bible. This is one of those times. We are not to have "undue familiarity" but we are to be "highly social". This sermon is one side of the coin and ties everything together well at the end. If you wish to understand the full balance, watch this in conjunction with It's not a social club.

FAQ - Who is the Holy Spirit by Paul Godfrey:
There are a lot of theories on the Holy Spirit, and we certainly can never have the full answer, however, there is clear enough evidence that not only does the Holy Spirit exist, but that He is a person. Watch the video for the evidence.

JESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.

Born of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.
