In 1910s Russia, Tsar Nicholas II and his wife Alexandra 
find their son Alexei, sole heir to the Romanov dynasty,
 suffering from hemophelia and conventional medicine failing
 to help him. Alexandra looks into finding holistic treatment
 and finds Father Grigori Rasputin, a destitute monk who claims
 he had a vision from the Virgin Mary telling him that the Tsar
 needed him. Though Nicholas and the royal doctor are both skeptical
 of Rasputin's alleged healing abilities, young Alexei quickly bonds
 with the charleton/prophet, so he remains in the Royal Court. But
 Rasputin's constant boozing and womanizing angers the aristocracy 
and worsens the already unstable tensions between Nicholas and his
 subjects. With the seeds of revolution brewing, it becomes 
increasingly apparent that a bad end awaits for the entire Royal Family.
