[T],GIANNIS511,2013-01-16T20:15Z,Am I the only one that isn't really excited with the death of Peter Parker? For so many years we saw a funny character and that was his great characteristic. Now he is just smart and nothing more. I really hope they will bring Peter Parker back to life soon.

[V],STFmaryville,2013-01-17T02:31Z,"it's just bleh. i read 700, superior, and the daredevil guest appearance. octospidey is pointless. not sad, not meaningful, not worth raging over. just pointless.

the internet will break if he rapes mj in 2 weeks though!"
,N4n4y4,2013-01-17T10:03Z,"Correct me if I'm getting this wrong.
But, I think the last page of Superior Spider-Man shows that Peter's still around & is the cause of ""Spider-Man's"" reflexive ""Heroics"". Also, he's sworn to get his body back.

I guess THAT is how they intend to keep the viewers interested."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-01-18T01:40Z,"so why bother having a hero die heroically if it lasts 21 pages of ""story time"" (2 weeks in ""real world"" / publisher time)?"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-01-21T22:12Z,"GIANNIS511, what do you think about this shit?!?
