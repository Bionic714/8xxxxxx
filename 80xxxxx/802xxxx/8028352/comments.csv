,toufage,2013-05-12T17:42Z,"I wanted to say that in this torrent the english sub is not a real english sub, it is not a translation of the Japanese audio but the English dub put into subtitles. This creates a large problem with the timing of the subtitles, leaving some characters silent when they're obviously talking in Japanese. And from my research the English dub is very watered down/poorly translated in OVA3 especially in the in-depth scientific descriptions."
