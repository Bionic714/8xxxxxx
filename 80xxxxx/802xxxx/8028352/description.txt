Encoded all 7 episodes of The Tenchi Muyo Ryo-Ohki series into high quality MKV h.264 format with both English and Japanese audio, and with all of the Subtitles as well.

This is the next part of the story that comes right after the 13 OVA episodes. Some people tend to call it the other half of the OVA and claim it is the OVA, but it is its own short series meant to continue from the 13 OVA episodes.

Finding this series for download was pretty easy actually, but I didnt find one that looked all that great. There were some pretty decent copies out there though.

You can find Tenchi Muyo OVA in my uploads as well on KAT. I tried uploading it here but it claims its already in their system. I havent been able to find it.

For playback all you need is the proper codec if you dont already have it. 
Combined Community Codec Pack (which I prefer) or the K-Lite Codec pack should give you all you need and more to play these back.

You should be able to hear audio just fine if you have one of the mentioned codec packs above. If you cannot hear any audio and do not want to install a codec pack for some reason, then you do not have and need the nero aac audio codec. As of today it can be found here.
