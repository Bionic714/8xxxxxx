I sincerely hope Peter David is recovering from the stroke he had. He has entertained me consistently for years and years -- truly one of Marvel's shining lights!"

Peter David fans: visit his website, check it out, support him through these hard times.

I'm getting a few e-books and making a X-Factor subscription, may not be much but each small contribution counts. Peace, out!"
