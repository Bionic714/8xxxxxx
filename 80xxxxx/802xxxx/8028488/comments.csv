Blu-Ray quality except for the 2 screenshots of the Crazy 88 fight in color, that looks like upscaled DVD to me. Thanks anyway, a lot of people have been waiting for this for a long time."
,horea88,2013-01-17T06:30Z,Awesome post! But been stuck at 5% for quite some time. Please seed.
,.Leto.,2013-01-25T06:17Z,"So I finally finished downloading this. Like I already said mostly blu-ray quality, so it's excellent, with a few new scenes/shots coming from a lower source.
There are only subtitles for non-english dialogues. They're in green and sadly hard-coded so you can't change them.
Thank you for this, it's interesting to see the full version. Maybe one day Tarantino will release this himself."
,tiktokcarrera,2013-01-25T17:28Z,I'm sure most here have seen these movies in their current release form but for those that haven't I won't spoil it for you. The only thing I would edit out is the reveal before ch. 6. It would actually make the ending a little more interesting. I think that was the way it was in the original screenplay.  Other than that it was a good effort. Thanks.
