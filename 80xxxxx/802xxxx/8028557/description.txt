The Story: Yun Guang Han has infected his Order of the Dragon initiates with next-step evolutionary bacteria and built himself a super-creepy army with which to conquer the world! Spider-Woman is safe in that box with the parasite-infested Hulk, right?

STFmaryville says: "I want everybody to read this sentence again: 'Yun Guang Han has infected his Order of the Dragon initiates with next-step evolutionary bacteria and built himself a super-creepy army with which to conquer the world!' and now ask yourselves ... Why can't we get more kids and women to read comics? LMAO!

I would also like to point out that despite the solicitation text above, this issue was clearly written by KELLY SURE DeCONNICK not Fraction. Idiots.
