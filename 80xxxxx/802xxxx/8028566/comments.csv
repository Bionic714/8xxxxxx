Nobody is sticking a fucking gun in your face telling you to download. What fucking dicks, give props to the guys and gals that are uploading a movie that is pretty much still at the theater, so all you bitches and basterds who have nothing nice to say spend your money to go see it at the movies, hopefully when you go some asshole will shoot the place up and you get killed...what a bunch of PURE ASSHOLES!!!!! Thanks S4A, really appreciate the upload, you have a lot of followers who really give you props!!!!"

,salazam1,2013-01-21T04:15Z,can any of you idiots explain to me what a google is?
,PltosChrm,2013-01-22T01:22Z,"Imnot saying this to be a dick or a troll, because I liked the movie. However, theperson recording was a spaz that CONSTANTLY zooming in and out on the screen. Find a point where everything fit in frame and leave it alone.  It's a cam so it isnt expected to be great, but that was really annoying.  The sound was okay -- an holow echo throughout-- but the movie was pretty good: what youd expect from a Tom Cruise flick. Smae character, different name.

Thanks for spending the time to upload, but truth be told, people should same their bandwith and wait for a better copy"

While not entirely original, Jack Reacher is both a competent mystery movie and an exciting action film. Tom Cruise had a great acting session in this movie, loved it! Quality sucked but i found a better one at jackr.facegirlsbook.com and it worked well for me. Enjoy this action, it's great!"
,fdbob,2013-01-29T13:42Z,"thanks scene4all these people who complain are a mob of retrobates who dont deserve to download anything, what abunch of dick heads!!!"
