Notes: we choose tommie vid as it seemed to have the less flicka in it just changed
brightness a little and tweeked few other things then synced line at
50m.40s - 52m.09s is cam audio due to break in line. Throughout the movie there may
be a couple glitches but nothing major  and they do not spoil the movie just been
honest so enjoy till better arrives--  !!!!
