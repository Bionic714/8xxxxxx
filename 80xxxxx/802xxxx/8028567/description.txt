Synopsis

Seamus and Ciaran are childhood friends with a shared commitment
to Ireland's independence from British rule, a commitment which 
puts a sudden end to their teenage kicks and lands them a lengthy
 sentence behind bars. Soon the friends' passion spreads to other
 political prisoners who join them in a 66 day hunger strike.

The hunger strike of May 1981 was a revival of the hunger
protest of late 1980, when seven strikers abandoned their 
fast, misled into believing that the government was about
to give in to their demands. Until 1976, IRA political prisoners
had virtual "prisoner of war" status. Then a policy of 
"criminalisation" of terrorists came into force. The prisoners
refused to wear convict garb and began the "blanket" and the 
"dirty" campaign. McKeown, who was sentenced to life for the
attempted murder of an RUC officer and "causing explosions",
was 18 when he was arrested. He began his hunger strike at the
age of 25.
