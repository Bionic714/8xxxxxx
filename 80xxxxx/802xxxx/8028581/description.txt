Notes

we choose tommie vid as it seemed to have 
the less flicka in it just changed brightness 
a little and tweeked few other things then 
synced line at 50m.40s - 52m.09s is cam audio 
due to break in line. Throughout the movie 
there may be a couple glitches but nothing 
major  and they do not spoil the movie just 
been honest  so enjoy till better arrives--  !!!!
