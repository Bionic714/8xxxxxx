DESCRIPTION:

ΓÇ£Contentious, rude, hilarious, moving, and truthful. A book youΓÇÖll dip into for the rest of your life.ΓÇ¥ ΓÇöIan Rankin

The male genitals are worn externally as evolution is in the process of expelling them from the body. 
Another million years and theyΓÇÖll be stored in a drawer.

The award-winning Scottish poet Don Paterson has assembled a comic, intelligent, and cranky collection of brief truths and conjectures and, in the process, revitalizes the classic pith of the aphorism. ΓÇ£The formΓÇÖs only virtue is its brevity,ΓÇ¥ Paterson writes; 
ΓÇ£at least the reader cannot seriously hold that it has wasted their time.ΓÇ¥
