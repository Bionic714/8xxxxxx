On its release, Lost Sirens received a fairly positive critical reception. The album was hailed by The Independent's Andy Gill who claimed that New Order's ninth outing 'actually bests its parent album [Waiting for the Sirens' Call].' Gill particularly recommended I Told You So, Sugarcane and Hellbent as the album's better tracks. Metro stated the album 'offers few classics but will still delight fans of the band with its feelgood sound.'
