Chirayu (Eternal) | 2011 | Hindi | CFSI | x264 | MP3 | Phantom

After the Gujarat earthquake of 2001, 6 eminent Indian filmmakers got together to contribute individual segments to ΓÇÿChirayuΓÇÖ. This film thus becomes a boquet of six individual stories designed to reach out to the children of Gujarat traumatized by the earthquake and put a smile back on their faces. The directors who have contributed segments are Virendra Saini, A K Bir, Shyam Benegal, Santosh Sivan, Aziz Mirza and Sai Paranjpye. An embellishment to their efforts is provided by the renowned animator Ram Mohan.
