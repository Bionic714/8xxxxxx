,macguytpa,2013-01-22T21:34Z,"@4rky - WTF is wrong with you?  Despite your warning I downloaded, installed, and launched the software and it is most defiantly not Deluxe but in fact Home and Business Edition."
,ecsinfl,2013-01-23T14:42Z,i agree with 4rky .. this is Deluxe Not Home and Business .. if you look only at the App name only after installation it does indeed say Home & business But when you run it the program Clearly shows the Deluxe banner  
,SuperKizzy,2013-01-24T01:44Z,"For the record this is IN FACT the HOME & BUSINESS version of TurboTax.  This is NOT the Deluxe version.  Not sure why previous comments state otherwise, but download it for yourself and see. "
,ensign120,2013-01-24T04:59Z,"This is in fact Deluxe version.  Whoever uploaded just renamed the application.  If you start it, the Deluxe version banner appears."
,LIFAS2,2013-01-24T16:59Z,"I downloaded this on 1/24 at 10:30am. I installed it and ran updates. When I opened it, the top banner said ""HOME&BUSINESS"" and had the following tabs: Personal Info, Business, Personal, State Taxes, Review, File. Anyone stating that this is not Home & Business for Mac is full of it. I was able to transfer my info from the previous year and download my state, as well. I'll report back if I have issues, but I have been using H&B since 2008 without a hitch."
,SuperKizzy,2013-01-24T21:54Z,I'm going to say it again.  This is the HOME & BUSINESS version.  It is NOT the Deluxe version with the file name changed.  The file name is Home & Business and the application itself is in fact Home & Business.  It is HOME & BUSINESS all the way through.  Download with confidence.
,sean_man,2013-01-25T04:14Z,"This is in fact Home & Business. Before I updated it said Home & Business. After updating it says Home & Business.

I just used it completely. It's perfect."
,brkdog,2013-01-26T00:32Z,"If you run into the problem with it showing the wrong version, go to /Library/Application Support/TurboTax 2012 and delete the ""ttkind"" file."
,headstash,2013-01-27T18:52Z,Mine also says deluxe. before and after update... do i need to register it? also does it matter which magnet link i choose? any help will be greatly appreciated.
,thetinguy,2013-02-01T07:33Z,Another confirmation for the fact that this is Home and Business 2012
,yar1vn,2013-02-03T03:40Z,definitely Home and Business
,nagah,2013-02-07T03:04Z,"This install shows Home & Business on a Mac running Mountain Lion

BUT

shows Deluxe on a Mac running Lion, both before and after doing the updates"
,nagah,2013-02-07T03:07Z,"Install this on a Mac running Mountain Lion and it will, in fact, be Home & Business"
,johnnymp3seed,2013-02-07T03:20Z,"I'm getting the Deluxe, not the home & bussiness - i went to the Lib/App Support folder but I do not have a TurboTax folder there. Any ideas as to how I can get this to function as the Home & Business version??"
,riker92,2013-02-11T23:06Z,"1)   Will the app and forms still properly ""update"" (I figure it would have to ""phone home"" to do that)?

2)   Are you still able to use this for electronic filing of your Tax Returns?"
,cutelatinagirl,2013-02-14T00:09Z,Just chiming in to say that I installed this on Snow Leopard and it is indeed Home & Business edition; this is what it says in the upper left corner and continues to say after updating. Thanks for upload!
,askmoses,2013-02-21T01:57Z,"I'm looking for US Home and Business 2012 for Windows... the ""Mac"" won't run on W will it?"
,Atum-Ra,2013-02-25T02:51Z,I'm unable to update (download the necessary paperwork from The IRS)... Any ideas?
,xlsbri03,2013-03-02T13:47Z,this is indeed turbo tax home and business looks like depending on the operating system you have its either deluxe of home and business    using a original copy does the same exact thing    THANKS FOR THE UPLOAD A++++++
,1Swift,2013-03-31T10:02Z,"@Atum-Ra 

Having the same issue...Did you ever solve it?"
