Synopis:

A psychological gangster film based on fact. 

Machine gun totin' Ma Barker lead her family 

gang (her sons) on a crime spree in the 

Depression era. Her loyal brood have every 

perversion imaginable. The sadistic Herman 

sleeps with his Ma. When Fred Barker is 

released from prison, he brings home his cell 

mate/lover Kevin Dirkman, who also sleeps with 

Ma, much to Fred's chagrin. Lloyd Barker is a 

spaced-out drug addict who sniffs glue if 

nothing better is around. Ma kidnaps happy-go-

lucky millionaire Sam Adams Pendlebury and 

holds him for ransom. Arthur Barker - Ma's 

wallflower son - and Herman's hooker lady friend 

Mona Gibson also figure in the story. The bloody 

finale is virtually choreographed and a visual 

stunner. Filmed in the Ozarks.
