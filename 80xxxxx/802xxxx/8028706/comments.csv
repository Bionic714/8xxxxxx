,nice_guy75,2013-01-17T15:42Z,"Where did you get this ISO from, I am sure you must have seen our IDs in computer property. Anyways, I am not sure where did this member get our OS but before going for installation please check the MD5 checksum value of the ISO.

There are loads of modified Alaska ISO are floating on the net and many of them have bugs in those ISO. MD5 Checksum value of official ISO of Alaska is 766d54668e8500c43656ede62a0e7332"

I do respect the job, but

better take clean win 7
also took me 6 times to reinstall to finde right loader. those  did not work and made bootloop"
,nice_guy75,2013-01-19T08:50Z,"Daz loader works perfectly. I have been using the Daz loader and didn't face any problem.

Can you please tell me which program is not working, no one complaints about this till date. I wonder you find this OS slow, I have removed some of the components to speed up the OS and also disabled few services as well to speed up the OS. Don't go on size of the OS its because of the updates I have integrated and softwares you got in the OS itself."
