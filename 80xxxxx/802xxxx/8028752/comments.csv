,THANGDL,2013-01-17T02:07Z,Woo! thank so much! i've been playing SD v1.9 it's very good. Now is newer.
,THANGDL,2013-01-17T13:34Z,It works perfectly. But i don't know what different is between SDv1.9 and SDv2.0 ?
,Mau40,2013-01-18T05:25Z,"dunno either
thats probably because there is no official 2.0 
update for sleeping dogs.
cant find anything about it on the sleeping dogs forum

but is solved my mouse probs so i dont care really ;)"
,Skrotorian,2013-01-21T00:35Z,"After updating from 1.9 to 2.0, my game will no longer start! any ideas? I ran the .bat file which completed successfully then copied the cracked files. Whats going on"
,Skrotorian,2013-01-21T01:33Z,"As of now, no version will start, not even the core game, and it used to run fine and so did the updates..."
,Skrotorian,2013-01-21T05:35Z,"This and the 1.9 version, along with many previous, are now obsolete and unworking. Please release a proper crack for 2.0 so everyone can play once again, thank you! (p.s. it used to work so well i love this game)"
,Skrotorian,2013-01-21T21:38Z,"My sleeping dogs is now working, it was a problem with nvidia optimus, sorry for the confusion"
,_purple_,2013-01-27T21:29Z,"No uploader bothered to mention that steam is necessary for the game to play. It is not obvious since this is a cracked version. Needless to say that it should be in the instructions. In the end it was the only change in the system that made the game to finally launch.

Anyway thanks for the upload and the release."
,gilknut,2013-02-11T23:12Z,"This does not work. The downloaded archive can't be unpacked by either WinRar or 7zip, the files turn out to be at 0 kb when you do and it gives error messages. Have downloaded it again and the same result. The 1.9 version worked fine, but not this. What's the deal?"
