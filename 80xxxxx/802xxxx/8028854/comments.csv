,josue37,2013-01-17T00:35Z,que idioma trae???????????
[V],2010kaiser,2013-01-17T00:39Z,Es Inglés. Si lo que buscas es una versión en español. Descargue el torrente y agregar un paquete de idioma español.
,maheshrautray,2013-01-21T09:35Z,"""Updates Activated""  -true or false ?"
,maheshrautray,2013-01-21T18:17Z,really ?
,asusG75VW,2013-01-25T04:10Z,"Thanks Kaiser, Hopefully this is activated just like Orbit30's version for Windows 7 AIO R2."
[V],2010kaiser,2013-01-26T20:41Z,"@maheshrautray

If the torrent description says it's activated and has the relavent updates included. I'll go out on a limb here and say it's highly likely if not absolutely certain that this torrent contains a pre-activated version on Windows 7 64bit. It would have Service Pack 1 (SP1) 'slipstreamed' into it and carries a separate .SFX file (Self extracting Archive) which holds all the 64bit updates available up until 15/01/2013.

If that's what it says in the torrent description, then that's what i've included in the torrent.

Hope this clears the issue up for you ;-)"

,silents429,2013-03-19T01:37Z,Excuse me. I installed this and it asked for a key. I skipped it but what do I do? I read the instructions but will those keys in the how to work? What do I do here? I thought this said it was activated? May I have some help please.
,Fanciestmoon,2013-03-29T18:28Z,"Alright, Well I'm feel this is me being stupid or simply not knowing what to do, But I'm having an issue and figured I'd ask you.
So I downloaded the file and it came in as an .exe(which seemed odd) I basically said ""Fuck it"" Ran it, nothing happened. So I extracted the files and got a LINKS.exe, SOFTWARE.exe, and INFO.exe, which was all fine and dandy. However during the process, there was a problem with the extraction. Says that it couldn't extract the .iso and the the file was corrupt. 
Any ideas whats up?"
