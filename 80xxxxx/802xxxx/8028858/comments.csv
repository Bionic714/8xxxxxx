,Pedeadstrian,2013-01-16T19:42Z,"Thanks for the upload. Once I have it finished, I'll find out if it works on my retail copy of Borderlands 2. If not, I'll just download that too!"
,suitretas,2013-01-16T19:51Z,"Wow, pretty fast Gh0stNet, Thanks.

Can someone answer me if this works flawlessly with the skidrow versions?

I've been downloading all of skidrow's dlc's and updates so far, so i wonder...

Thanks"
,manaho,2013-01-16T20:10Z,Big thanks in advance:)
,manaho,2013-01-16T20:11Z,@suit  It should work perfectly 
,fedeuy,2013-01-16T20:18Z,"Thanks GhOst!, any1 happen to know if this is usable with the original Steam copy of the game?"
,Yorgal,2013-01-16T21:26Z,I have no voice in the DLC content in french version( i didnt tried in english) someone can help?
[V],Gh0stNet,2013-01-16T22:00Z,because this dlc torrent does contains only English language and if u want other languages then wait for skidrow release 
,jesters_fool,2013-01-16T22:18Z,"This killed my Borderlands 2. I haven't had to have Steam since installing BL2 (Skid Row) and with this ""update"" game won't launch. It tells me I need steam installed and running and also have to download and install GreenLuma (which I didn't need before) I'm not an idiot. I followed all installation instructions and get a long list of errors involving ""steam works"" and game doesn't launch."
,myromm,2013-01-17T01:05Z,"That is a wonderful torrent. havent been able to play BL2 with friends on lan for quite a time and this torrent solved all my problems, works great."
,ego1607,2013-01-17T01:35Z,Since I've instlled it all my characters are misssing. Anny sugestion on how to resolve that?
,suitretas,2013-01-17T02:31Z,"So dudes, anyone got it working??"
,MaDuce,2013-01-17T04:16Z,it's not compatible with previous installations from skidrow. my splash screen page crashes when trying to launch after i applied this update. i tried re-installing a couple times and still couldn't get it to work. best wait for skidrows if that's the copy you have installed.
,Beelzy,2013-01-17T06:30Z,Works great here. No problems at all. Kudos.
,Luis_Eva,2013-01-17T07:01Z,"Working excellent, Thank you very much for this :D"
,Kingsanx,2013-01-17T08:58Z,"Thanks, download does as intended. No harm, no worries."
,DominusTk,2013-01-17T10:09Z,"Excellent download, thanks. But does this include the new costume pack?"

,kkonfused,2013-01-17T13:36Z,windows 8 fix is not working...anyone else is having a problem while running on windows 8?
,kkonfused,2013-01-17T14:29Z,Scratch that...reinstalled the game...works perfectly!
,suitretas,2013-01-17T17:47Z,"OK I tried to install this and it works flawlessly so far...
Just do as it says in the README FILE.

So... thanks Gh0stNet."
,Mr_Ceiling_Cat,2013-01-17T19:47Z,works fine. thank you
,Zmajce,2013-01-17T19:55Z,Does LAN gaming works with this update?
,Zmajce,2013-01-17T20:24Z,"Can anyone confirm LAN is working,
I am getting host don't have the same version msg, although all my friends have exact same files as me (took same steps to install game as me)"
,wroth91,2013-01-17T21:25Z,"awesome, works perfectly, thank you"
,themightyjoe,2013-01-18T06:12Z,"Crashed my Skidrow version as well. Not saying it doesn't work, but if you have Skidrow's version, just wait a bit longer. Now I have to go reinstall and all that mess."
,diegodgo87,2013-01-18T17:58Z,"Works fine with Skidrow game, awesome dude. thanks."
,TheDragonReborn26,2013-01-18T23:48Z,"Yeah, you guys talking about it not working with the skidrow release don't know what you're talking about. It works perfectly and it's simple."
,samengo,2013-01-19T07:40Z,"My Borderlands 2 won´t work anymore! Thank you,FUCKTARD!"
,OmniNegro,2013-01-19T09:05Z,"How can there even exist so many that have problems with this? It works flawlessly. Something is wrong with how you are doing it. Please follow the directions step by step. If you have to do anything unusual, please let us know what it is. We may be able to figure out what is wrong if you will help us rather than screaming obscenities at people for bothering to give you a game for free.

If all you want is misery, then fuck you in your sorry ass with a telephone pole mounted on a freight train.

Good enough for you juvenile kiddos?"
,xxela,2013-01-19T16:21Z,"Thanks !
Works great!


If you have windows 8 just apply the fix"
,ap2882,2013-01-19T17:02Z,"You have to reapply the windows 8 fix once you install this, FUCKTARDS."
,TheDragonReborn26,2013-01-19T22:05Z,No you don't. You don't have to do anything other than what the directions say to.
,samengo,2013-01-20T08:32Z,Can someone tell me how to de-install it?It completely killed my Borderlands 2
,samengo,2013-01-20T08:41Z,"Or at least someone tell me whats wrong,I do it 100% like in the Read-Me and Borderlands 2 won´t start."
,xxela,2013-01-20T12:25Z,"If it dont start after update
Apply the Windows 8 fix if you have Windows 8
If still wont work apply Steam install fix"
,TheDragonReborn26,2013-01-20T14:04Z,"Funnily enough, I've found that A LOT of the time people think there is something wrong with their game when all they need to actually do is run it as Admin. If the fixes included aren't working, might want to try that. Sometimes the simplest solution is right there."
,samengo,2013-01-20T14:38Z,"I´ve tried everything but it won´t start.The 2 previous DLC´s worked just fine,seems that the file is corrupted.For god´s sake I hope I´ll be able to deinstall this someway."
,hctulKTL,2013-01-20T20:30Z,"Hey, anyone having problems....I have a possible solution for you. I also followed the instructions exactly and had issues. To be precise, the game crashed at the splash screen. The problem turned out to be that I was trying to install over version 1.2.2 (fully thought I had 1.3.1). After downloading and installing Skidrow's 1.3.1 update (this one specifically: http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8001554/Borderlands.2.v1.3.1.Update-SKIDROW) over my botched dlc installation, and then reinstalling the the dlc....everything worked fine. I don't know, maybe this will help some of you. I haven't tried a LAN game as yet, so I can't tell you anything about that."
,hctulKTL,2013-01-20T20:37Z,"Keep in mind that you don't necessarily have to uninstall this. Just install skidrow's 1.3.1 update over it along with the crack that comes with that, then reinstall this dlc and it's own crack. If it doesn't work over that then, well, good luck."
,omgzelda,2013-01-20T23:40Z,THANK YOU SO F**KING MUCH FOR THE WINDOWS 8 FIX !!! YOU ARE MY HERO MAN 
,killerbuz13,2013-01-21T01:58Z,And this fucked up my start up....Now what should I do?.....
,larra91,2013-01-21T07:23Z,"Gh0stNet what is the difference between your torrent and the others? i can see that you have here explained the fixes and have update.V1 what i really actually dont get it what is this update all about, but HeroMaster and MrStifmeister torrent is bigger than yours, so any ideas?"
,samengo,2013-01-21T18:39Z,"Guys everybody who got problems with this,check out the version of ""HeroMaster"".It works like yo mama!"
,larra91,2013-01-22T19:02Z,"works perfectly for me, i have Borderlands 2 Skidrow, Borderlands 2 Crack Only Fixed-3DM, Borderlands 2 Update 4 incl.DLC-SKIDROW, Borderlands 2 Mr.Torgues Campaign of Carnage DLC Proper-SKIDROW, Borderlands 2 Sir Hammerlock's Big Game Hunt DLC Incl.Update.v1...this order I installed everything and works like a charm :)"
,KoaLARP,2013-01-23T19:38Z,"works perfect,did not even need any fixes.

save games and characters are intact.

running on win 7 64bit

thank you very much"
,Zillatat5,2013-01-29T02:24Z,Anyone know if this works for Mac?
,Jesaynt,2013-02-02T04:48Z,"Yeah this borked my retail copy. I've got Win 8. It doesn't run at all with the fix and I get an initialization error without it.

Oh well, was a nice try."
,Radcobra101,2013-02-04T07:05Z,"ALRIGHT this did not run for me for a bit i had i mean not even the loading screen it was the launcher and then that was it.
Heres what you do if this happens to you.

Borderlands.2.Sir.Hammerlock's.Big.Game.Hunt.DLC.Incl.Update.v1.3.1.Hotfix.CrackedFixesSteamInstall Fix

install Steam, and use x32. dont have Steam open when using x32  just in case."
,e3y0re,2013-02-09T10:08Z,"Works perfectly with SKIDROW, thanks.
Install them in this order:

1) Borderlands.2-SKIDROW

2) Borderlands.2.Update.4.incl.DLC-SKIDROW (for the Season Pass, not sure if it's included with Mr Torgues.)

3) Borderlands.2.Mr.Torgues.Campaign.of.Carnage.DLC.Proper-SKIDROW

4) Borderlands.2.Sir.Hammerlock's.Big.Game.Hunt.DLC.Incl.Update.v1. (This file)

Make sure to follow the instructions and copy the files in ""Update 1.3.1...."" & ""Crack"" in that order, both folders contain steam_api.dll, and I'm not sure which is better, but copying & overwriting everything from the Crack folder last worked for me.

*** Don't get Borderlands.2.v1.3.2.Update-SKIDROW, you don't need it! ***"
,skulldragon,2013-02-17T01:35Z,"This package solved my issues with B2. Sometimes some weird crashes due to some ""missing files"" may occur, but then just restart game, skip doing of what you did and then you can play.

""The Borderlands 2 Season Pass allows users who purchase it to access the four DLC packs for Borderlands 2 at a reduced cost compared to purchasing them separately as soon as they become available."" aka it's NOT needed."
,Gvapo,2013-02-20T02:48Z,Works perfectly.........thank you.....
,angelgamer1,2013-02-23T00:22Z,I don't understand how to install this. All I am getting in the download are 5 RAR files. What the hell do I do with those?
,Doremonhg,2013-03-03T12:56Z,"Okay, I don't really want to be an asshole but you guys are the worst team. Why the fuck did you have to make your fucking release's name so long? So long that it even bypass Windows's name rules. I fucked my copy up just because of it."
,axl2396,2013-03-04T21:34Z,"Ok... so I get the Torgues DLC installed and good, but the Sir hammerlock dlc breaks my game, am I just not doing this right or...?"
,tiz2,2013-03-17T21:48Z,"@Doremonhg: Tsk tsk little noob, don't bite the hand that feeds. Windows 7/8 doesn't have a problem with the length of the tittle, but the program you use to decompress the files might. Winrar doesn't have that problem. But how that made you fuck up your copy of anything is entirely on you."
,officerssw,2013-03-24T00:15Z,"I've been having trouble recently with LAN functionality. My friend and I have played for months with no problems, but now all of a sudden I cannot connect to his game. Only he can connect to mine. Does this sound familiar to anyone? I've port forwarded in my router, the firewalls are down, we're on the same patch version, we've checked seemingly everything...

help?"
,kunaulia,2013-04-01T12:48Z,"Please somebody, Is this works with nosTEAM? thx."
,Yingi,2013-04-05T19:32Z,"It's not difficult to use guys, here is my instruction guide for Windows 7
1) Download the torrent
2) Open the folder
3) Highlight the 5 rars
4) Right click, press Extract here
5) At end of extraction there will be the folders the Instructions in the description of torrent speak of.
6) Follow rest of Torrents instructions"
,Zipgun,2013-05-09T02:09Z,"@tiz2

Tsk tsk...Look who's fucking talking..Only a NOOB would download shit of a PUBLIC Tracker fool. Especially one that is under litigation. Hell I only use this site for reviews and or what came out. I then down off the PRIVATE trackers I belong to even then just to demo the game. If I like it I BUY it. Unlike most of you who just steal like no tomorrow. Keep on doing that then one day there won't be any games to steal. Anyways watch who you call a NOOB. LOL! Guess it takes one to know one eh? :D"
,Zipgun,2013-05-09T02:18Z,"@Yingi

WRONG!

You only need to right click on a single Rar.

And NEVER use extract HERE. Always use extract files, so they all go into a separate single folder.

Sheesh like I told the other noob only noobs use PUBLIC trackers. Either they don't know about or how to join a PRIVATE tracker or just have too slow a connection and cannot keep a upload ratio. 

On my slowest day my down speed is 65MBPS and about 20MBPS up. 14GB game off a private tracker heck 10mins or less. Not sites like these were their are still morons using 56k and most take 5 hours to weeks to download just a GB."
