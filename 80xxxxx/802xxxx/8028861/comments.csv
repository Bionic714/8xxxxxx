,tataie_nae,2013-01-17T11:21Z,"I unzipped the file with WinRAR, I burned the ISO image with Nero and restart your computer does not boot from the CD. What is wrong here, please some help. Thank you."

The Windows 7 .ISO needs to be burned to a DVD not a CD as the image is too big for a CD. It also needs to be a bootable image. If you don't know how to do this. Look at the tutorial below:

,ingersedat,2013-01-22T13:58Z,Why is the file in this torrent a .exe ? It should be an ISO! How am i supposed to burn a .exe? Please help!
,ingersedat,2013-01-22T13:59Z,"The only file in this torrent is 32bit Ultimate SP1 Activated.exe . Please help, i really need this!"
,ingersedat,2013-01-22T14:01Z,"The only file in this torrent is a .exe file? Where's the ISO image? Please check, i need this! Thanks!"
,ingersedat,2013-01-22T14:02Z,Sorry for the multiple comments. My comments were not appearing...
,sphinksy,2013-01-22T22:37Z,"I would also want to know why it's an .EXE file and not .ISO
Can I just rename it to .ISO and then burn it??"
,An_Edcase,2013-01-26T18:26Z,"@ingersedat @sphinksy If you'd actually read the description you would understand that the .Exe file is a Self Extracting Archive, which contains the  Windows 7 x86 .Iso. The torrent also comes with burning tools for the Iso and Bootable USB  software."
,garg33,2013-01-27T03:41Z,Its a self extracting exe you can extract iso file anywhere in your pc.

But... when I get ready to burn the DVD, it always read Non-Bootable Image... and I can't seem to change that... also tried to read the tutorial that you posted, but I couldn't find anything useful... Think you can help?"
,J0nyB,2013-01-29T02:16Z,"Simply can't select Bootable (in Miscellaneous) and also can't load a ""boot information source"" (as per the tutorial...)

can you please help?

thx"
,pravathen,2013-02-02T04:52Z,do i need to burn the self extracting archive or the iso file? if i burn the iso file how can i install the updates?? please reply..... thanks in advance.
[V],2010kaiser,2013-02-07T23:02Z,"For anyone having trouble making a bootable .ISO. I've upload a small utility which makes a bootable Windows 7, vista or XP image in just a couple of clicks. just follow the instructions in the torrent description and also in the README.nfo file contained in the torrent.

,gerberlocs,2013-02-09T06:30Z,hello i downloaded your winusb maker and i was wondering how long it is supposed to take to complete the transfer of the windows 7 to the usb
,lassik2,2013-02-14T22:29Z,Is there a way to install all the updates at once rather than clicking on them all individually? That really takes a long time....
