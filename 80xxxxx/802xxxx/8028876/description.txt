A makiwara board is a great piece of equipment for karate practitioners. The primary use of makiwara training is to carefully, slowly strike it in such a way that you will to condition your striking tools. These include various parts of the hands as well as your feet. Ultimately with enough practice on the board your striking areas will adapt and strengthen the bones, and connective tissues used for the strikes. Callouses also commonly form over the knuckles with enough practice.
