The following torrent is one that I created with my collection of Gameboy Advance ROMS in gba format. It also includes my personal factor emulator for PC: VisualBoyAdvance (latest stable version). It is the most up to date and compatible GBA emulator.

If you enjoy this torrent, check out my other Nintendo game collections:


Installing/Using VisualBoyAdvance:
 1. Open the folder entitled "Emulator" within the downloaded torrent.
 2. Open VisualBoyAdvance-1.8.0-beta2.zip with a program such as WinRar or 7-zip
 3. Extract to somewhere on your computer.
 4. Run VisualBoyAdvance.exe to start the emulator, make shortcuts if desired.
 5. Go to File--&gt;Open Game and choose the location of the roms on your computer.


Now just select a rom and play! You can also configure a gamepad if you got it.

 These roms are compatible with ANY GBA emulator out there. If you are using another OS, VisualBoyAdvance is also avaliable for Linux (v1.7.1) (here) and OSX {v1.7.0) (here). Both downloads are provided by Sourceforge.net.

 Anyway, I hope you guys enjoy my newest Nintendo collection, enjoy and SEED!!
