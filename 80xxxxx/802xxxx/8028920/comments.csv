[V],STFmaryville,2013-01-16T21:47Z,you're welcome onemangang
,dbranson17,2013-01-17T00:44Z,Thanks... I don't think I should read this without being caught up on the Bionic Man and Bionic Woman books which are totally lacking on TPB.  Any chance you have any of these?  The last Bionic Man I read was #14.  : (
[V],STFmaryville,2013-01-17T02:50Z,i didn't have any of them before this one. i just grabbed half of the comics you're looking for from this torrent: http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7299746/
,dbranson17,2013-01-17T04:30Z,no... Bionic Man is on like issue 19 or 20... the last one I found was (through) #14... looking for anything after that.
[V],STFmaryville,2013-01-17T15:32Z,"i know you want the whole series, i don't have time or i'd seek it out for you.

you've only missed one issue, #15 is out now. bionic woman was a 6-issue mini, or was cancelled after #6, not sure which. so 21 comics total, that torrent i linked has half of the collection."
