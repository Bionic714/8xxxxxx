The following torrent contains my collection of SNES roms in smc format. It also includes my personal favorite emulator Snes9x 1.53 (latest version). I have yet to find a game that doesn't work with it. It also has gamepad support ect.

 I haven't managed to think of anything that's not in this collection, let me know if you do..

Installing/Using Snes9x:
 1. Open the "Emulator" folder within the downloaded torrent.
 2. Open either snes9x-1.53-x32.zip or snes9x-1.53-x64.zip (depending on your OS) with a program such as WinRAR or 7-zip. If you unsure just go with x32.
 3. Extract it's contents somewhere on your computer.
 4. Launch snes9x.exe to start the emulator, make shortcuts if desired.
 5. Go to File--&gt;Load Game, choose the location of your roms, and than choose a game. 



 And that's it! You can now play any SNES game on your PC! You can also get OSX version of Snes9x by clicking here (v1.53), and for Linux here (v1.43).
