The Bandicam program makes it possible to record a 
certain area on a PC screen, or on a program that 
uses the DirectX/OpenGL graphic technologies. 
Bandicam will help you carry out a video record with 
high compression ratio, while keeping the video 
quality closer to the original work, and provides 
performance far superior to other programs that 
provide similar functions.
