Designers
-------------------------------------------

This is a collaborative project between zydratex and I. zydratex and I will be programming additional builds weekly. We will never sell the bots. I learned AHK in four days to make this bot. A PokeMMO bot that costs 99 cents is 99 cents too much. 

zydratex and I encourage those who enjoy PokeMMO to pay for donator status. Servers aren't free, and the dev team works very hard to keep the game fun, so please support the developers!
