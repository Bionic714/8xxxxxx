My Colouring Book is the eleventh studio album released by Swedish singer-
songwriter Agnetha Fältskog. It was her first album release for 17 years
and was well received by ABBA fans, as well as the general music press, with
renditions of songs which she had listened to during her teenage years in the
1960s.

"... in no way parallel anything done by ABBA, Fältskog's voice retains the
simple purity of tone and expression that she brought to the group's sound 30
years earlier, enough so that serious fans are likely to enjoy this CD,
especially attributes such as her stripped-down rendition of "Fly Me to the
Moon" and her covers of standards such as "Sealed With a Kiss" and "The End of
the World." The sound is excellent and the playing is impeccable, in settings
that range from an instrument or two right up to a full band and orchestra
accompaniment."
