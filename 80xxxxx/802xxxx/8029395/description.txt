One step sparring is a two person martial arts drill wherein one
partner will deliver a designated, controlled strike and the other
partner will take a designated type of step and perform a controlled
block and counter. As a rule, all martial arts that use one step
sparring will have a series of one step, two step, and/or three step
drills, that follow a progression of increasing difficulty and
realism. Be sure to also view my full Karate student guide -
