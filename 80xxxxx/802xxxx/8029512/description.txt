In Texas, a closeted lawyer/husband returns home with a surprise for his lonely, sex-starved wife - a cowboy hunk to serve as their handyman (and other things). She at first doesn't realize that there's more to their man-to-man relationship than employer-employee, but neither do the two men realize they share a past incident which links them tightly together.
