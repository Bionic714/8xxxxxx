Always the best uploads."
,Hamster-X,2013-01-17T01:23Z,Thanks a million! I anxiously await your weekly release of the New 52. +1!
,Jobyn,2013-01-17T03:20Z,"First, I registered mostly for the sole purpose of thanking you for your work. You are the best.

Second, and less importantly, do you plan on adding the Threshold comics? Are there other spin-offs that I have missed?

Thanks again!"
,HateMyJewHair,2013-01-17T03:34Z,"I have a request:

James Robinson's run on Justice League of America. That would be Justice League of America Vol 2 38-60.

Even if you can't do it, thanks for everything else you do. "
,asgrade,2013-01-17T04:07Z,Where is Threshold?
,Pletar,2013-01-17T07:26Z,"Threshold is a sort of DC cosmic book that recently started.

Can anyone explain the recent trend towards larger images/file sizes? It's a real bitch because it takes up so much space, takes a while to load up each page and (personally) doesn't fit my screen anyway..."
[V],mirrormaster82,2013-01-17T08:12Z,"Treshold : http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8030740/TRESHOLD___01

HateMyJewHair: Sorry but I'm currently not able to fill out any requests.
You're welcome everyone."
,calvinvin123,2013-01-17T09:29Z,shouldnt threshold be part of the pack isnt it new 52?
,kissfan1,2013-01-17T12:03Z,"As always, thank you!!!"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-01-17T14:29Z,"first of all, thanks mirrormaster82, for this torrent and for all that you do ..."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-01-17T14:47Z,"Pletar, as years go by, file sizes go up. 10 years ago an avengers scan was 4mb and now it's 40. but 10 years ago my laptop had a 12 gig hard drive, now it's 120. i know it's problematic, and there are several scanners that keep their file sizes down -- conserving hard drive space and transfer time without a noticeable sacrifice in quality. however those aren't usually the releases you'll find here, and i think that's because the scanners who release a book on wednesday morning usually are more interested in getting out the .cbr as quickly as possible (and don't get me wrong, they do amazing work).

as far as fitting your screen, use CDisplayEx and the option fit to screen or the fit landscape menu.

and one more thing, not trying to be an asshole but i always say if you don't like the files, go spend $3-$4 and buy a printed copy. printed copies use zero bandwidth and zero drive space!

also, HateMyJewHair, you can get the justice league comics you want from
http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/6615963/
(#38-59) and
http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/6613553/
(#60)"
,Pletar,2013-01-17T15:37Z,"Re: STFmaryville

Thanks, I just wanted to know why. I live in an area with limited bandwidth, and to be honest, I don't think there are any comic stores around my region, let alone my country! "
,free3dom,2013-01-17T15:48Z,"The increase in file sizes are because of the increase in resolution of the files released digitally - from 1280px to 1920px (page widths). This probably happened because tablets are increasing in resolution.

This is a good thing, as storage space is cheap...and the increased resolution will provide a much better experience in the future on higher resolution devices :D"
,redrobin2,2013-01-18T01:27Z,you never disapoint mirrormaster
,Bubbers83,2013-01-18T03:35Z,"Hey Mirrormaster, any chance of posting the Ame-Comi Girls comic? Havent seen them up in the past few weeks and I know you a great guy to go to for requests."
,whoresman1,2013-01-18T11:25Z,Thanks!
,Doc_T,2013-01-19T01:17Z,They're stopping Grifter?~?~?~
[V],STFmaryville,2013-01-19T05:29Z,"Doc_T, yeah. And Blue Beetle next week.

Even if you count the 6 upcoming titles: Threshold (just began), Justice League of America, Vibe, Katana, Man of Steel (or whatever it will be called), and Constantine, there are NOT 52 series in The New 52."
,jmdf42,2013-01-19T07:29Z,"I was wondering if anyone knew where to find Geoff Johns Superboy: The Boy of Steel. 


I've been looking everywhere, but i couldn't even find de Adventure Comics issues where the story arc was first featured..."
,jmdf42,2013-01-19T07:32Z,"Does anyone know where i can find Geoff Johns Superboy: The Boy of Steel? Or maybe upload it? 


I've looked everywhere for it, but i can't even find the Adventure Comics issues where it was originally release..."
,netfire_,2013-01-19T23:54Z,"How do you make these? I want to download the Peter Milligan version of the shade. I'm willing to pay for them, but as I understand it you cant actually download the comics you actually pay for, which is total bullshit. I'm not willing to have my comic collection vanish when their server goes down. Am I mistaken? or is there some  sneaky way to do this?"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-01-20T02:00Z,"jmdf42, here ya go:

,netfire_,2013-01-24T10:47Z,"Nope, I was right, you can't. can you get them?"
