Britsh TV series which will interest those of you who are into geneolgy.


I have already uploaded Series One of this program and episodes 1 - 5 of Series Two.

I am now uploading episode 6 of Series Two and will add to these as they become available. 

Please note I only have an upload speed of 75 kbps. 

However when seeding (uploading) at this speed my download speed drops from 460 kbps to around 120kbps.

I have had complaints from my wife and teenage son, who share the internet connection, about their diminished accessability while Iam seeding.

I seeded the previous episodes practically non-stop for a month.

In this time I saw a large amount of completed downloads, however the number of seeds available did not increase.

In fairness to my wife and son I have decided to stop seeding these, and will only seed future episodes for a limited time.

So please please seed.


Accessability to The Pirate Bay of recent has been a very hit and miss affair, with it being down most of the time.

If you having this problem use http://pirateproxy.net/ which always works.
