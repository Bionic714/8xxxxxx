track 15 is not complete. only 27.8 kb. Good thing I already have this song."
,Filbert65,2013-01-17T22:00Z,"@Zaschark Indeed it is. Therefore I think it is sad to find this album here.
I completely support piracy when it comes to music provided by money greedy record labels, but this guy does this on his own.
He's a really talented musician and his style is unique, I really think he deserves getting paid for what he puts a lot of time into.
So please instead of downloading this album here  go to his website and pay for the album which is only $9."
,reffik,2013-01-18T00:29Z,"I agree Filbert65, but not everyone has that 9 bucks sadly enough (myself included at the moment). But I've been to two of his shows and bought a t-shirt, so i make sure to support other ways. Besides, this is a 192k copy, so it's a good way for people to try before they buy. Wax provides lossless and 320k so if you want a great version, buy it!"
