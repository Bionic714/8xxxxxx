"Burned"

Olivers confidence is shaken after 
being beaten by the Dark Archer and 
he takes a break from being Arrow. 
However, when Laurel calls Arrow for 
help investigating a firefighters 
suspicious death, he reluctantly 
agrees but his hesitance while 
fighting almost costs him his life. 
Meanwhile, Tommy throws a benefit for 
the firefighters and Thea tries to 
lift Moira out of her depressive 
state.
