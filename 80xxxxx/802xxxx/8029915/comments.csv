1. CompTIA Network Plus Training Kit Exam N10-005
2. This one
3. CompTIA Network Plus N10-005 Authorized Cert Guide
My question: I bet all 3 covers the same material, which one is best to study? I really don't want to study all 3!..."

I uploaded the two other books for you. I was getting a database error and so I could not respond. Study, study, think, think and all will be well."
