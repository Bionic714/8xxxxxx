"Cold War"

When the entire Weaver family gets sick, it forces 
the Bird-Kersees to confront something new and 
terrifying -- the common cold. The Bird-Kersees - 
especially Larry - can't understand why Debbie 
takes care of her family even though she is 
exposing herself to their cold. Having learned 
there is no cure for colds, Larry makes the 
community quarantine the Weaver house, but Reggie 
has other plans.

Evolve... or die.

Enjoy :)
