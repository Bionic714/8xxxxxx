,ThatTunechi,2013-01-17T03:38Z,SCSA420 i was wondering if u can also upload ur torrents in 540p or 560p.i been downloading ur torrents since early 2012 and i cant download them anymore cuz i pay for every gb now.u still should upload the 720p but many people who download other wwe torrents download the 400p version and would like a torrent between 400p and 720p.i see a lot of sports torrents uploaded in 540p or 560p.if u do it ull be the only uploader that uploads wwe/tna in this resolution.if any 1 else would like this plz comment.thanks

,naman1234,2013-01-17T11:14Z,ye i also want 450p to 500p versions because i do not have space and low net speed
,zasshu,2013-01-17T21:32Z,Ditto on the request for lower resolutions. Not everyone has high internet speeds. Appreciate the upload though! thanks.
,ThatTunechi,2013-01-18T01:03Z,"zasshu, i like his uploads but its to big.thats why i hope he will also encode his uploads in something between 480p and 720p"
