Release Notes: One flashback and one re-release on this mix. Jessie Ware's song "110%" was recently officially re-released with a different title for her album. The new title of the song is "If You're Never Gonna Move". The sampled vocal, "carvin' my initials on your forehead," have been edited out of the new version and you know how we feel about editing things out. Azealia Banks' video "212" is obviously not new but we slept on it back in September of 2011. We love the song and need some Azealia in this mix, so there she is. Her fresh sound has come to define what the Groove is all about. And are you ready for a talented new superstar R&B singer who can rival Beyonce in gorgeousness? Well we have been blessed with Tinashe. By the way, this release comes with a parental advisory sticker.

"I don't want your daughter, she look like Steve Atwater." -Riff Raff

We love us some Riff.
