What you have here is a unique and important collection. What you have here is  "Quake 1" "Quake 2" and "Quake 3" *compatible archive of 
 Skin, Texture, Wad, Pk3, Model, Mdl, MD2, MD3, Bot, Bsp, Name, Demo, Frontend, etc etc Tools & Editors and so on.

Some of the Quake Editors Thread - Stoneless - ToeTag - Qoole - WinQoole - qED -
Quake Studio - Quma - Thunder - Quark - and so on..

Then I included folder of Misc Quake 1- Quake 2 and Quake 3 Utilities - Other Editors- as Well as Tools and More..!

I also have Quake Game Converters- where you can take a Quake 1 & make it Quake 2
compatible- as well as make the Quake 2 Map a Quake 3 Compatible!

I can't type everything-even by categories as there are many but we have 474MB worth!
