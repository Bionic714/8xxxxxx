,pirate450,2013-02-23T22:09Z,"Great episode, nice plot so far. Storyline is intelligent and i wouldn't change it even a bit. Quality - A10 V10. I usually watch everything at film.plotar.org	because they always have HD but they don't have tv shows so having TPB for TVshows is great, thnx!"
,oddzero,2013-04-12T21:01Z,so at the risk of lookin like a newb I will post this comment... I got the dreaded letter from my cable company today for this torrent. I know there are programs out there to make it so your IP addy is changed.. but not sure where to find them. Can anyone help?
