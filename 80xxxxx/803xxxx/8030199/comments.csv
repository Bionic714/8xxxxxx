[V],MP4SUX,2013-01-22T19:32Z,"Two reasons. First, just before this show premiered, one of the stars had a recurring role on ""The Gilmore Girls"" as Rory's sometimes boyfriend. Could never get the heebeegeebees from those sorts of roots.

The second reason is that one other has asked me to post it for the obvious pixelation issues - and I'm not really up to adding another LOL / DIM debacle to what I'm already doing.

Or maybe the best answer is that I can only spread myself so thin without crashing and burning and this show falls below my radar of consideration. Taking on new tasks (even shows I don't personally watch) isn't beyond me, I've done ""Boss"", ""Last Resort"" and a few others that I've never really seen - but you'll note they are encoded by more responsible members of ""The Scene"" (which is anyone that is not LOL / DIM), so I feel secure in a high probabilityy of getting it right without really knowing so myself.

Some are equally mystified that I do 'The Daily Show', but not 'Colbert'. If you talk to professionals of any capacity, they'll tell this one story - volunteers are horrible to work with as you have no leverage, nothing to keep then in check.

Whim and Whimsey are my watchwords along with ""wow, THAT MANY people are lining up to download MY stuff?"" Kule ...
