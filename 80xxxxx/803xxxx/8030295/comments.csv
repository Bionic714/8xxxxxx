,oil52,2013-01-17T05:36Z,"@Epicfrog - According to the wiki it is the 11th episode of season 3, comedy central just decided to air them in two sessions. I think both 4e01 and 3e11 are acceptable though."
,Rammaukiin,2013-01-17T05:36Z,"epicfrog, it is supposed to be season 3 episode 11. For some reason they decided to make a season ""3b"" instead of 4, so season 4 is technically the second half of season 3. :)"
,armstrongdesigns,2013-01-17T05:57Z,Seeding away  - Thx eztv
,YaMoonSun,2013-01-17T13:59Z,"I'll be sure to seed, though I'll be pretty irritated if the wiki is correct and they're only airing one more episode..
Keep up the good work eztv =)"
,faircopy,2013-01-18T05:12Z,"Per the official tumblr, this is season 3B: http://workaholics.tumblr.com/post/39785347345/are-you-ready-to-getweird-for-years-to-come"
,epicfrog,2013-01-24T05:47Z,"whatever you want to call it, it's still the fourth run of 10 episodes"
,epicfrog,2013-01-24T05:49Z,"I guess it makes sense though, it was only 6 months ago that the s3e10 aired"
,{me},2013-02-06T09:32Z,"They did the same thing with South Park.

Thanks always eztv

Happy Pirating"
