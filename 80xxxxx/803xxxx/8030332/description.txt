If youΓÇÖve not heard of Kevin Tihista before, then you might not be aware of the majesty of a record from the year 2001 by the name of DonΓÇÖt Breathe a Word. Recorded by Tihista (rhymes with ΓÇ£fiestaΓÇ¥) under the name of Kevin TihistaΓÇÖs Red Terror, it was a record of sumptuous soft pop, influenced by the work of The Beatles (in particular the solo work of George Harrison), Bread and America to name but three, and critically lauded by the end of that particular year. However, timing is everything and due to the events in New York in September of 2001, many records that were released at around that time were forgotten about ΓÇô including TihistaΓÇÖs. Since then, there have been two largely ignored albums also under the moniker Red Terror, plus a collection of demos ΓÇô but nothing much else. For a man with myriad personal problems including crippling bouts of stage fright, this radio silence of nearly seven years may not come as much of a surprise. So it was something of a pleasant shock to discover a new album in 2012 in the form of On This Dark Street.
