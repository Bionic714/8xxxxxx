But really, past a gig or two it's fucking pointless because there is no way this aired in 3400x2800 resolution HD. Come on now, use your brain. This is not necessary."

Someone's a little slow in the head. If you don't understand what something is, learn to google it. By the way, it's a 45 minute show. 

You're welcome, btw. Moron. :)"

You may want to try googling what a Transport Stream is as well before coming to conclusions."
