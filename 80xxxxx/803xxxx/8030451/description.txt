Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site :: On the Wednesday, January 16 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex covers Obama's announcement that he will use executive action and illegal orders to attack the Second Amendment after the Newtown massacre last month. 

Alex also covers the effort to impeach Obama for wantonly violating his oath of office and engaging in high crimes and misdemeanors. 

On today's show, Alex welcomes Texas state representative Steve Toth who has introduced the "Firearms Protection Act" that will make any federal law banning semi-automatic firearms or limiting the size of gun magazines illegal in the state. 

Alex also talks with Obama critic James David Manning, pastor of the ATLAH World Missionary Church in New York City.
