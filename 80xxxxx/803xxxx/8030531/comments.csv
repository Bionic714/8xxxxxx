[T],mf-den,2013-01-17T13:38Z,"First off, there are even no thoughts of converting X-Files into bluray by whoever made it cos they have to completely remaster it like Star Trek, so atleast for the next few yrs x-files wont come out in bluray. Also the dvd's for x-files is the 640x480 or 4:3 res ones so if they r encoded the quality would be very poor cos the original eps itself is not that gr8 in quality. That is why ur not able to see any low sized files, still we will try to give it a shot some time, but cant give u any guarantees that it can be made into a small file cos to give encodes from dvdrip a decent quality u need to give it atleast a 200mb file size per ep. or even if u reduce it to the lowest possible file size, the total size would atleast be 35gb+"

,Knan4051,2013-01-18T07:26Z,He's already busy encoding/downloading/uploading all the shows he does now. Asking to do an old show like the X-files is asking too much. Hard drives are so cheap right now anyways
[T],mf-den,2013-01-18T20:42Z,"@jhoneyeng: I dont see it in the foreseeable future, sry ur request is way too big."

,mista_nik,2013-03-10T02:18Z,"hey is that the same reason that I can never find any of the original Dr Who episodes in small file size? It's such a beloved show in Britain and it's been around forever but I cant find anything smaller than like 300-350mb per 20 min episode part. With a series as long running as Dr Who that means the smallest size you can find for the whole collection is 200gb! I would have thought someone would have taken the initiative by now and encoded the lot in small file size, high quality mkv's like all of your wonderful uls, for surely that encoder would be worshipped as a God throughout Dr Who fandom. But it sounds like that might be an impossibility eh?
Either way, thanks for the work you do, it is appreciated."
