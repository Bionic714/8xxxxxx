Pathways and Dawns, the first solo album by former Dead Can Dance percussionist Ulrich, is largely as percussive as one would expect. What may come as more of a pleasant surprise is how melodic the album is and UlrichΓÇÖs gift for an evocative lyrical metaphor. In ΓÇ£Always DancingΓÇ¥, for example, he gives us the line ΓÇ£In photographs I hear your songΓÇ¥, and ΓÇ£Life Amongst the Black SheepΓÇ¥, which I first heard as part of the Orphee compilation, retains itΓÇÖs melodic power here.
