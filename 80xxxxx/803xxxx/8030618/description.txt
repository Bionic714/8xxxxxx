USB Method! Find tutorials how to put this game in your flash drive then to your xbox. :)
Pretty simple. First Configure your flash drive in Xbox360 so it can recognize the usb and then download the game demo from here. Then open up Horizon and insert your usb in the pc so Horizon can recognize it. Once it appears saying: Game Profile, Game save, Game demos. That your usb drive. Now find your completed file of the demo and drap it to the program so it can transfer the file into the flash drive. It will take about 30 min or less to complete the process. After that, Safetly take out your usb and insert to your console. Then go to your my games section in Dashboard! ENJOY!

NOTE I am pretty sure you don't need an Modded Xbox360 to play this demo. So basically, THIS IS FOR EVERYBODY TO PLAY!
