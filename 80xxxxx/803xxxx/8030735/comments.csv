[V],MP4SUX,2013-01-17T17:29Z,"Actually, what I hate was ""The Scene"" rushing headlong in the change from AVI to MP4 and doing nothing the fix a major problem - massive amounts of ""Gross Piselation Errors"". They claimed the switch was for quality reasons and soooo many damaged filces belie the intent.

There is also the problem of so many with devices that cannot handle the newer format (not everyone can buy the latest toys on a whim).

Mostly, I've been more keen to be known as AVIGUY, but MP4SUX was chosen in haste long before I knew I'd be doing so much uploading.
