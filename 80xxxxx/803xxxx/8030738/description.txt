The kids that play on this song are very talented musicians. We have Dash and Tim Hutton, who formed a band called the Telecasters on here. Dash also plays with Haim. The two brothers are singing with me on the chorus. They have great voices, and their dad Danny Hutton whoΓÇÖs in Three Dog Night, has an incredible voice too. The whole family is humble, kind and pleasant to be around. This is our take on an old Rancid song originally recorded in 1992.
