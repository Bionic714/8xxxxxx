When IΓÇÖm down and need a lift IΓÇÖll play a Buddy Holly songΓÇôstrong guitar riffs and fun to singΓÇªand just like that I feel better! Buddy Holly & The Crickets originally recorded this tune in 1958. Buddy and his band wrote their own songs, which wasnΓÇÖt so common in the 1950s, and he was much bigger in the UK than in America..bigger than Elvis.
A statue now stands in BuddyΓÇÖs hometown of Lubbock Texas with Buddy holding his Fender Stratocaster guitar.
