I came across a version of this song performed by Hylo Brown. The tune was written by songwriter and piano player Bolivar Lee Shook. Great name. Bolivar would steal rides on freight trains near his home in Prentiss County, Miss. He got thrown from one of those trains, injured his leg and was handicapped for life. Without manual labor for wages- he turned to music. Bolivar taught piano, singing and tuned pianoΓÇÖs until he passed in 1964. Spent his childhood in a frame cabin on a hill- which overlooked a wide valley. There you go.
