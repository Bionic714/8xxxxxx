Times have changed since Rancid originally tracked this one in the summer of 1992. Everything was all word of mouth back then, like where to play, what bands and records to check outΓÇª and where to record. All we did around that time was play Gilman Street, play house parties and hang out on Telegraph Avenue everyday. This is a stripped down acoustic version of ΓÇ£Battering RamΓÇ¥.
