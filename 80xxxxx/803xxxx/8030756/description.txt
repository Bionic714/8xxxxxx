G.B.H. are hands down, one of the greatest punk bands. I first saw them in 1983 at the On Broadway in San Francisco. My brother Lars Frederiksen was at that same show but I didnΓÇÖt know him at the time. We recently toured with G.B.H.ΓÇô I always enjoy watching them play and thirty years later they still kill it. This song was originally on their Leather, Bristles, Studs & Acne EP, which came out in 1981. I always dug how this song started out bluesy, then turned into full-on hardcore.
