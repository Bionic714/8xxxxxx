Kerub Crispin's bazaar is a wondrous treasure trove! By the light of a Mossliver oil lamp, you'll uncover antiques of all kinds: weapons, amulets, talismans; some ornamental, some precious and even some that are magic... Each has its own tale to tell, and each tale its own episode! It's the perfect opportunity for the old Ecaflip to share some of his memories, encounters and extraordinary adventures with his adopted son, little Joris.
