This one was written by John Fogerty, and recorded originally by his group, Creedence Clearwater Revival. John wrote the song about a down and out musician playing a gig in Lodi, which is a small agricultural city located in the Central Valley of California. John claimed that he thought Lodi had ΓÇ£the coolest sounding nameΓÇ¥, and thatΓÇÖs what inspired him to use it in the song. John was from our neighborhood, born in Berkeley, Ca.-which is about 70 miles from Lodi, and he went to El Cerrito High School. Growing up in the East Bay, coming from a working class family, Creedence was the Holy Grail of what we consider great, and cool about music.
