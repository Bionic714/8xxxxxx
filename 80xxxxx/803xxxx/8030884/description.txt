Rancid just played with the Last Resort this month on our recent UK tour. Rancid has always been a fan of leader Roi Pearce and the band. We give a nod to them on the song The Ballad of Jimmy and Johnny from our LetΓÇÖs Go recordΓÇô ΓÇ£Jimmy Likes Ska, and Johnny Likes Last ResortΓÇ¥. You need look no further than these guys, that we consider one of the greatest punk bands of all time. King Of The Jungle takes you on a journey through the inner-city jungle..This is our take on this great song.
