The reggae band, the Black Emeralds are the backing band for this track. J Bonner is the leader of The Black Emeralds, and he and I are in the Engine Room together, and we both played on Jimmy CliffΓÇÖs Rebirth album. J, and his cousin Salina also played with me on my solo record, A PoetΓÇÖs Life. Bobby Freeman wrote this tune, but I still consider this a Ramones song. This is our third Ramones cover.
