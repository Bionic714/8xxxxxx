This song was written in 1951 by a trio of songwriters that included Tex Atchison. He also wrote quite a few hillbilly boogie, and rockabilly tunes, such as ΓÇ£Tennessee Hound DogΓÇ¥, ΓÇ£MailmanΓÇ¥, and Johnny BondΓÇÖs ΓÇ£Sick, Sober and SorryΓÇ¥. Tex Atchison started recording in the 1930s with the Kentucky Ramblers, who became the Prairie Ramblers. In the post war era, he played with Merle Travis (40ΓÇ▓s-50ΓÇ▓s), Ole RasmussenΓÇÖs Nebraska Cornhuskers, and Leon Chappel in the early 50ΓÇ▓s. Tex became famous for his Western Swing fiddle playingΓÇô and as a teenager, he would be digging coal by day, and play fiddle, sax and clarinet at night, in coal miner dance halls. Tex Atchison was called ΓÇ£Arguably the best left-handed fiddler in the history of country musicΓÇ¥ ΓÇô by country historian Charles K. Wolfe. Being a Southpaw myself, I always have an affinity for a left handed muso.
