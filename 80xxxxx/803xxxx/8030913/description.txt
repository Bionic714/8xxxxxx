The song is now titled ΓÇ£DifferentΓÇ¥, but for a few months Ximena and I simply called it, the ΓÇ£whistle songΓÇ¥, on the account that it opens with her whistling.  When I heard that she could do that, and carry a melody, I was like holy crap, we gotta get that whistling into a song as soon as possible. Ximena Sarinana is an extremely talented singer, and performer from Mexico. We co wrote this song ΓÇ£DifferentΓÇ¥, for her 2011 album. IΓÇÖm looking forward to writing more music with her someday soon.
