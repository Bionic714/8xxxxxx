The Bridge Of Gold is not for the old, itΓÇÖs for the young at heart- to get a new start.
One side is the past, the other side the future. 1930ΓÇ▓s, Great Depression..a man named Strauss engineered that Golden Gate, across a treacherous channel, where no one had succeeded before.
People moved west, to follow a dream. I wrote this song with my best friend Matt Freeman. The original version came out on the ΓÇÿDevils BrigadeΓÇÖ album.
