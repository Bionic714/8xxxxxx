Hank Williams was born in Alabama, and when he was young he met a black street performer by the name of Rufus Payne, who taught Hank guitar. Rufus had a huge influence on Hank. A teenage Hank put together the Drifting Cowboys to play live on the radio. At 23, he met Nashville music publisher Fred Rose, and recorded the tune ΓÇ£Move It On OverΓÇ¥, and the rest is history.
There have been many different lyrics used on this song over the years. Ricky Nelson has a rockinΓÇÖ version of this song, and he changed the lyric from ΓÇ£I canΓÇÖt buy no beerΓÇ¥ to ΓÇ£I donΓÇÖt work no moreΓÇ¥. ThereΓÇÖs a great jazz version out there by Willie Nelson and Wynton Marsalis. The rhythm section are my bandmates in RancidΓÇôMatt and Branden, and this is our take on it.
