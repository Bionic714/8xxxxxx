,socratus,2013-02-02T15:17Z,"works great. For some reason, regedit command dont work on all OS.

 if you get to licence prog. again, then write "" Team EAT "" as a username, and "" 2012-347150 "" as a serial. "
,PurePluto,2013-02-22T02:54Z,"All you have to do is download mIRC from the actual website, then enter this information:

Name: Team EAT 
Serial: 2012-347150 

That's all there is to it!"
,PurePluto,2013-02-22T02:55Z,"Here is the simple thing to do, download mIRC from their website. Use these credentials, Name: Team EAT Code: 2012-347150"
,war59312,2013-02-23T18:03Z,"You have to patch the file first, it's include.

If you don't patch mirc.exe first then the serial does NOT work."
,helldemonfiend,2013-02-24T02:43Z,thanks again 
,LunarisDream,2013-02-28T04:18Z,Thanks to TorDigger for the upload and PurePluto for the workaround!
,gaditas007,2013-03-03T06:10Z,"Name: Team EAT 
Serial: 2012-347150 

this is all to need to do. 

Thanks guys! works perfeclty."
,dudi4155,2013-03-15T14:09Z,"Guys, the point of the crack is that you can put ANY serial and it will work.

As for the upload itself, works great, thanks!"
,dobarsi,2013-03-16T08:41Z,thanks working
,mr2old,2013-03-20T17:59Z,"Works great.. just install, apply the crack, and THEN register it and it works like a charm.

TYVM"
,Maharaja-Krishna,2013-04-08T22:53Z,"1) Downloaded mIRC directly from the mIRC website
2) Installed it normally
3) Replaced the original mirc.exe file with the cracked one
4) Entered the registry information (regme.reg)
5) Choose the dialog ""have already the registration code"" (or something like that) and entered the registration information which is in the regme.reg file. NB: Any other registration code did NOT work.

That worked (for me)!"
,jalucian,2013-04-19T04:27Z,"PurePluto and gaditas007 are wrong. You cannot just enter that registration information and have it work. You have to replace the ""real"" mIRC.exe with the smaller version in the Crack folder, then run Regme, THEN register with that info. Then it will work. Why anyone would say that you can skip those two necessary steps is beyond me..."
,humpahoe,2013-05-12T06:12Z,people are fucking idiots. that's why
