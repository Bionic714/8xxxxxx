This is totally watchable for who does not want a bigger file. After five minutes you stop noticing the resolution, if you notice. Thanks, mate!"

For a movie starring Walken and Pacino this movie should have been better but it's a waste of time. Nothing makes sense."
,antiseed,2013-01-19T22:21Z,"why even say ""please seed"" etc? the only people looking at this torrent are the people who haven't downloaded it yet... looking at the screens, quality looks fine for 700mb

This movie was excellent!  

I'm going to watch it again, and I'm also going to take some friends to the theater to support the film and actors.  Epic last night out movie!

That last statement proves that even leaked screener films on torrent sites have little effect on box office numbers.

I'm going to tell everyone I know to go see it!"
