this is the worst movie that main actor ever did. Limitless was a lot better and every other movie this guy did although that was advertisement also. OMG this movie is so fucking gay. only girls and fudge packers like this movie. just promoting big fat advertisement for the shit pharmaceutical drug companys. what fucking bullshit stupid ass retarded movie, feels like got dick in ass movie. wtf almost as gay and shitty as The Impossible but not quite

A - Good

V - Good

M - The combination of comically awful acting and a somehow a story that lacks any sort of substance more then people constantly crying crocodile tears, in chorus, makes the almost 2 hours unbearable to watch.

MY COMMENT
gayestmovieever at 2013-01-10 14:59 CET:
I have been downloading torrents from this site since the beginning of time and i just registered now for the first time ever for the only purpose to state that ""This is the Gayest movie in the history of all movies"" and i am not talking about the kind of gay between 2 men that suck each others dicks and ass fuck one another. Anyone that thinks anything different should punch themselves repeatedly numerous times in the face and than proceed to tie a belt or a rope around there neck and hang themselves until dead. You deserve a slow painful death, that is what you like if you like this movie, its basically the same thing you that it feels like, you must not have any kind emotion that you need to watch this shit predictable ugly boring sad ass shit movie to feel anything and addicted to feeling shitty and being a shit human being brainwashed chicken troll.. This should be in sci-fi section since there acting was so far from reality, i am sure delusional morons that think that there actions and emotions where not fake as fuck dick son and so far from any reality in the world as we know it.. now BE GONE.


Both comments have Same exact meaning. just different wording. happy happy time

,lodalo3,2013-01-21T08:05Z,I'm pretty sure anyone with half a brain will be able to see your opinion on this movie is about as reliable as you trying to pass as a hetero sexual. Clearly you're so insecure about being gay that you have to drop the word every other sentence. And then scream for attention (that you misleading believe no one will catch on to) by blasting a movie that has been nominated for mulitiple awards (some already won) because you're too big of a pussy to admit you cried.
