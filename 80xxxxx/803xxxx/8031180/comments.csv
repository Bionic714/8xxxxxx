It's a fine little book, clearly self-published and modest in its particulars. But the writing is brisk and funny. It could have been (and probably was) a blog series a la ""Stuff White People Like"".  

You'll read it in about half an hour and have a good time doing so.

But the best part is trying to sort out which of these douche categories GourmetPrince belongs to. My current guess is ""Guy who still quotes 'The Holy Grail' and/or 'Spingal Tap'."""

1) The book WAS put out by a publisher (Three Rivers Press)

2) Turns out there's no ""g"" in ""spinal"".

3) Upon further review, we find that GourmetPrince is more likely to be one of the ""Guys who insist a stripper was into them""."
