Monster's Balls NextGen Client is here.

Features: 


- All the guns in both 1.6 and Zero are replaced. Zero now contains ALL modded guns, some even retextured and/or re-aligned by me. And i'll tell ya.. Changin the origin is easy but takes a SHIT load of time. Took about an hour to reorigin - only 9 models (albeit i was busy besides realigning)

- There are folders "centered guns" in 1.6 and "more guns.. " in Zero. These contain mostly Centered origin guns, and in Zero's folder it contains 2 more models for AWP and M4A1. And the centered guns. (All this especially for you angry baba !)

- New Graphics, weather effects, skies (you may not notice them but believe me i changed them)

- All new CS:S starting music for 1.6 and a rejuvenating, movie-type one for Zero

- New icons for games (same as 2.2, but they are different from the default ones aint they!)

- Various new maps (many of them suggested by our members in sonny (sonic) 's post.

- New guns (as y'all know) for 1.6 are mostly from Zero's default ones. I can change them and bring new ones, but believe me, I RARELY could find the guns passing our high standards to be replaced in 1.6. Those that passed (like a galil i found, dual military tmps, angry baba's suggested minigun, etc.) have been replaced.
NOTE : YOU MAY BECOME ADDICTED TO GUNGAME AND DEATHMATCH PLAYING WITH THESE AWESOME NEW GUNS. NOW I LIKE PLAYIN ON GG TOO (EVEN BEING THE WORSTEST GG PLAYER EVER!)

- New game menus which are multi purposeful. Now you can change games, view demos, and do a lotta things (see for yourself)

- New team menu and pictures too , while joining/changing teams

- New command menu (PRESS H in LAN/ ONLINE game when connected) with support for upto 30 mp3, you can refer to my forum post for tutorial

- New WADs (textures for mapping) (like thats gonna do good to any of us!). But dont delete them, you need them for playing on various other maps.

- New HUD and RADARS for both games, Red hud and Blue radar for CS and Green (CZ:DS) hud and CS:GO STyle radar for Zero.

- Included VARIOUS PLAYER models for both games, WHICH ARE HIGH IN SIZE, given, but have lower polys. (i know coz i saw these with my own eyes)

- Now you can even connect to Zombie servers, without having to download the zombie models, and some of the zombie sounds.

- Now support for mission play and mission packs in Zero. (Click on Play Missions (lol)) You can add your own too, i've already found and total of 5 mission packs are there. Took me 3 days to finish the work and in finding the neccessary files (OMG).

- Remade most of the Options menus and the last tab is worth checking out.

- Fixed LAG problems, most of the game in CZ wont lag (normally) except when sometimes the game abnormally shows high latency for all the servers.

- Resized and re-texted the Connecting to server (etc) options.

- New MOTD for LAN servers. And added some cfg files too.
