This tune was originally done by rockabilly singer-songwriter Ersel Hickey. Ersel had a hit in the 50s with Bluebirds Over The Mountain. Ersel met Phil Everly (Everly Brothers), who encouraged him to write his own material. So he did. Hickey wrote songs recorded by Richie Valens, The Beach Boys, Jackie Wilson & Lavern Baker too.  Ersel is in the Rockabilly Hall Of Fame. HeΓÇÖs a true rock and roll pioneer. This is our take on this wild jumper!
