,jarldan,2013-01-18T16:54Z,"Thank you! On a side note, I'd like to say that if you enjoy listening to this, please buy the album. I did the same with 7Sinners: downloaded it here first and bought it online. ""Straight Out of Hell"" costs 10 bucks only on Amazon (pre order as of today, Jan 18th) album to be officially released on Jan 22nd. I'm from Brazil and it usually takes a little longer to deliver. Shipping could be a little bit expensive, but ask your friends if they want something delivered and you can split. Do it and support the band!"
