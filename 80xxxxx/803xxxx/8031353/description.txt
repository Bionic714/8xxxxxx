Fugazi, Verbal Assault and Operation Ivy played together at the Rocket in Providence Rhode Island. It was April 16th, 1988, on Ian MackayeΓÇÖs 26th birthday. WeΓÇÖve remained friends ever since. During that time Operation Ivy toured in a 1969 Newport that was beat to hell. The 69 Newport had a giant box on the roof that my father had built to store our equipment in. Fugazi is one of the greatest and most powerful live bands I have ever seen. Blueprint was on the 1990 Repeater album and is one of my favorite tunes.
