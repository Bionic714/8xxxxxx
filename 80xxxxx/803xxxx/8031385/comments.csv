- Stop the Startdock Start8 service, change its startup mode to 'Disabled' and re-log in, then click the 'Patch' button.

,free3dom,2013-01-18T14:09Z,"Thanks, it works great :)

For those having trouble, try the following:
1) Uninstall existing version completely, and delete the ""ProgramData/Stardock"" folder.
2) Reboot or Logoff/Logon.
3) Now follow the steps provided above.
NOTE: after installing, close the window that shows up - do not click TRIAL, click the red X :)
Also, be sure to block the application with a firewall."
