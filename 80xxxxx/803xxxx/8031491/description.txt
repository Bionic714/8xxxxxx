A dutiful Samurai, a madcap Ninja and a bizarro Zen Monk team up to battle the undead in Feudal Japan. Can these unlikely allies stay friends long enough to stop the zombees from taking over their homeland? ZOMBEE is a full throttle blend of action, comedy, friendship and horror. You'll laugh until you cry and maybe throw up in your mouth a little.


Enjoy and seed!
