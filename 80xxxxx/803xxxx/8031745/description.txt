From Wiki:

Christopher Joseph "Chris" Isaak (born June 26, 1956[1]) is an American rock musician and occasional actor. Isaak was born in Stockton, California,[1] at St. Joseph's Medical Center,[2] the son of Dorothy (née Vignolo), a potato chip factory worker, and Joe Isaak (1929–2012), a forklift driver. Isaak's mother is Italian American, originating from Genoa.[3] His father is German American.

Isaak signed a contract to Warner Bros. Records in 1984 for his first album Silvertone.[1] The tracks "Gone Ridin'" and "Livin' for Your Lover", from this album, were featured in David Lynch's cult classic Blue Velvet. Isaak's second self-titled album Chris Isaak was photographed by fashion photographer Bruce Weber. Isaak's contract was renewed in 1988 when Warner Bros. moved him to their Reprise Records label.

His best-known song is "Wicked Game."[1] Though released on the 1989 album Heart Shaped World, an instrumental version of the song was later featured in the 1990 David Lynch film Wild at Heart.[1] Lee Chesnut, an Atlanta radio station music director who was obsessed with Lynch films, began playing the vocal version and it quickly became the station's most-requested song. Chesnut spread the word to other radio stations around the country and the single became a national Top 10 hit in February 1991. The music video for the song was directed by Herb Ritts and was a big MTV and VH1 hit; shot in black and white, it starred Isaak and Danish-Peruvian supermodel Helena Christensen rolling on the beach, embracing and whispering in each other's ears. Another less-seen version of the "Wicked Game" is directed by David Lynch and comprises scenes from the film Wild at Heart. "Wicked Game" also featured as the backing music in the 2001 TV advert for the Jaguar X-Type range of cars in the UK. In 1995 Isaak split with longtime guitarist James Calvin Wilsey, and that year's Forever Blue and the accompanying tour featured Hershel Yatovitz on guitar.

In 1999, Isaak's "Baby Did a Bad, Bad Thing" was featured in Stanley Kubrick's final film, Eyes Wide Shut, starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. The song is on his 1995 album Forever Blue. The music video for the song is directed by Herb Ritts, it was shot in color, it starred Isaak and French supermodel Laetitia Casta in a motel room. This was Isaak's second collaboration with Ritts.

Isaak also composed a theme song for U.S. late-night television variety/talk show, The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn. In 2001, Isaak starred in his own television show, The Chris Isaak Show. It aired from March 2001 to March 2004 in the United States on the cable television network Showtime. This adult comedy show featured Chris Isaak and his band playing themselves and the episode plots were based on fictional accounts of the backstage world of Chris Isaak—the rock star next door. In 2004, his track "Life Will Go On" was featured on Chasing Liberty's soundtrack, which starred Mandy Moore and Matthew Goode. His track "Two Hearts" was featured in the closing credits of the 1993 film True Romance, directed by Tony Scott, written by Quentin Tarantino, and starring Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette.

Isaak's longtime producer, Erik Jacobsen, was instrumental in his sound for 15 years. Jacobsen is known for his production work with The Lovin' Spoonful, and solo albums from Spoonful's John Sebastian and Jerry Yester. Isaak ceased working with Jacobsen on his 2002 album, Always Got Tonight. In 2007 Isaak opened for Stevie Nicks on her Crystal Visions Tour during the first leg of the tour.

Isaak was ranked #68 on VH1's 100 Sexiest Artists.

In 2006, he was guested by Johnny Hallyday to cover Fats Domino's hit Blueberry Hill. The duet was recorded and issued on Johnny Hallyday's live album La Cigale (2007, Warner Music). At the end of this record you can hear Chris Isaak thanking the French Rock'n'Roll star as "The King".

Isaak collaborated with John Shanks for his 2009 album Mr. Lucky.

He contributed a cover of Buddy Holly's "Crying, Waiting, Hoping" for the tribute album, Listen to Me: Buddy Holly, released September 6, 2011.

Isaak recently released an album called Beyond the Sun, which was recorded in Memphis, Tennessee at the Sun Records studio. 



Heart Shaped World 1989


Heart Shaped World is the third album by Chris Isaak. Released in 1989, it became his breakthrough album and featured the Top 10 hit "Wicked Game". The album was certified 3x Platinum by the RIAA and has to date[when?] sold about 2.6 million copies in the United States according to Nielsen Soundscan.


When Heart Shaped World was released in the summer of 1989, it was on Billboard's pop album chart for ten weeks, reaching no higher than No. 149; but in October 1990, after Lee Chesnut, music director of WAPW in Atlanta, played the song repeatedly over two weeks after hearing an instrumental version on the soundtrack from the 1990 David Lynch film Wild at Heart, "Wicked Game" was released as a single and the album reached the 7th spot on the chart, garnering sales of more than 500,000 copies.[2] Probably more important in propelling single and album sales, though, was the steamy video featuring a topless Helena Christensen and a shirtless Isaak in the surf and on the beach. Filmed in black and white, the video was in heavy rotation on MTV.
