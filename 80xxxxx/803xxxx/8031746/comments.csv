,Espana25,2013-01-17T20:16Z,"good post but can anybody confirm the source of this ? where,what and how is this working ? 149 MB of package does it also include the freight version of the aircraft or just this variant only ! ?"
,ItayD,2013-01-17T21:16Z,It works for sure.. it includes the update V2.10 also and registry file that fixes this problem
,CaIlMeMaybe,2013-01-17T21:41Z,This works but you'll have to run Enablebutton as administrator for it to work. Still have to test the plane to see if it flies properly.
,Raider1500,2013-01-18T02:13Z,Req. Flight1 ATR for FSX
,cheetah_cheetah2,2013-01-18T05:42Z,"This works just fine.
Both passenger and freight version are included. No liveries.
Crack is in form of EnableButton, dlls and registry entries.
Update is included, no registration or crack needed for it. 
Load Manager works good.
Good torrent."
,cheetah_cheetah2,2013-01-18T05:45Z,"The only thing that is maybe messed up a bit is sound. It's not smooth as it should be and some internal sounds are heard in external view etc. but I guess that's PMDG's fault. 

Someone asked for the author of this torrent. In the readme file it says ""BRENSHALE"", nothing else."
,jnedorost,2013-01-18T14:52Z,"Maybe it's a reup, bud instead of the previous one this works perfecly for me :)"

,Joker_Se,2013-01-19T16:45Z,"Yay it works !!! whats the diffrence to the pmdg 747-8i both te passenger  and freight can

,Espana25,2013-01-19T21:29Z,Sound shouldn't be an issue if this is a proper working version as i remember i got my hands on some other torrent sometime back which also contained the freight version as well and it did not have any sound problems i wonder if there is something wrong with sound files on this upload!
