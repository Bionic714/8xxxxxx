,ectoendomezo,2013-01-18T16:24Z,"Okay..so the file is great..+1

The Doc is also a Great Story..TRULY a rare gem of anti-depressant nature..a rare and genuine Cinderella story..

Made by Big Time Fanboy's it gets a little ..umm...Fanboyish..however on the Fanboy Annoyance Scale from ""Aww Jeezis Thats Pathetic"" to ""Well..Okay..That's Actually Pretty cool.."" I'd definitely say these guys Did The Right Thing and made a TRULY Positive Statement.

Great Job Fanboys! Sugarman..the exception that proves the rule."
