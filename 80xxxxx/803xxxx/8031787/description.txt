Part 8 of the complete Chronology of Spider-Man as listed here.
        
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7979089/The_Essential_Spider-Man_Reading_Order

Contains Chronological Issues 1400-1599.

Only a few exceptions:

-Webspinners was a mass of dead torrents and merely an anthology series, so I let it slide.

-Same for the Flashbacks, save for the Untold Tales Issue, which I placed first.

Enjoy!
