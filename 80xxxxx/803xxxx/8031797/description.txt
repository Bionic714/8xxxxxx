An unknown technology hidden within your ship, the DarkStar One, appears to be the key - but then an unforeseen twist dramatically changes the course of events. Delve deep into the galaxy, discovering new races, solar systems, technologies, and ever-stronger opponents as you travel on your epic journey.

DarkStar One features an elaborate story, related by more than fifty minutes of video sequences. You can choose and upgrade your spaceship - a fast attack ship with many light weapons or a near-invincible cruiser with heavy weaponry.
