,Zlenny,2013-01-17T16:34Z,"I guess it is working, many thanks to all the scanners, leechers, seeders and the TPB team, let's seed this one until the end of time. "
,Hamster-X,2013-01-18T00:58Z,"Thanks for the re-up, it's working for me now! On the seedbox it will stay xD"
,Zerojohnnyx,2013-01-19T18:54Z,"This is a really great upload, thanks! Except for the tie-in issues, I had ASM up until 531. 

I only had this problem though:
""RAR comic archive 'The Amazing Spider-Man #403c (Spectacular Spider-Man #226)' may be corrupt""

So, that was the only issue I could not open. "
,Sky923,2013-01-19T21:58Z,Thanks so much for uploading and re uploading this. Really wanted to get into this series.
,Zlenny,2013-01-20T03:03Z,"keep looking out for future torrents, they will be done like this working on a few others right now. 
@Zerojohnnyx - could be the comic reader you're using or the file didn't dl properly. the file is good on my end. 
@Sky923 - glad I could help, happy reading "
[V],STFmaryville,2013-01-21T22:10Z,"thanks very much for sharing Zlenny!

spidey fans need to read this: http://www.bleedingcool.com/2013/01/21/what-did-mary-jane-watson-really-say-to-mephisto/

that shit right there just blew my mind."
,Zlenny,2013-01-23T05:39Z,"a shame she doesn't know Spidey is not Peter...especially considering all the years they, 'shared a toothbrush.'"
,msreyes,2013-01-31T03:38Z,Thank you very much!!!! I am a newcomer to comics and it's great that I can read the original story line from the beginning. Plus my bf is a huge Spider-man fan but he never had the chance to read from the beginning. Will def be seeding for awhile. Thank you again!!!!!
,msreyes,2013-01-31T04:43Z,Had to leave another comment because for a 10gb+ file it is actually downloading very fast. Cheers uploader and seeders!!!
,3alexela3,2013-03-13T06:43Z,"The Other One Wasn't Working, It Had No Seeds At All.. So I Came Across This One.. IF It Does DL Completely, I'll Continue To Seed For A While. This Is Worth It.
Spiderman Is A MUST HAVE.

:3."
,Centrojas4,2013-05-31T16:43Z,"I've already downloaded this and in the seedbox it will stay for a loooooongg time. Thank you very much for this incredible work....all the ""amazing"" comics and all the story arc are in this torrent. It is just AMAZING :-P. Greetings, from Argentina. Bye!!! "
