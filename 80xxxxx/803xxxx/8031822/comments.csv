,crila,2013-01-19T21:51Z,"The 57 seeders, can someone confirm that is working? Have you tried it?"
,crila,2013-01-20T19:36Z,Works for me. I removed the 2 version and using the installation instructions i started it. Hope is gonna work more than a month.
,rogersarevok,2013-01-28T03:47Z,worked for me
,miknig,2013-03-02T12:51Z,Is there anyone has Adobe Muse crack for MAC?
,O.Dicky,2013-03-05T01:21Z,"Worked great, thank you!"
,rickrocka,2013-03-05T12:11Z,Adobe Muse 4.0 is out. Can you apply your crack to that as well? I tried it and it didn't work.
,dothamost,2013-03-14T18:15Z,"Works Perfect and is update-able. Instructions are for MAC but its almost the same for Windows Users.

1. Install Abode Muse, Making sure you uncheck the automatic start after installation.

2. Update to the latest Version. After programs updates and installs- CLOSE the Program.

3.Go to folder Contents: C:Program Files (x86)Adobe Muse and copy & Replace MuseOnAIR

4. If you don't have an abode account- Create one.

5. Create Adobe account:
https://www.adobe.com/account/sign-in.adobedotcom.html

6. Run Adobe Muse and select 'Try Adobe Muse for free'.

7. Sign-in with the account you have created.

8. Accept the License Agreement and use Adobe ID for finish activation.

9. Enjoy!"
,idoubleyou,2013-03-16T21:34Z,"this is a great program, but do you have the most updated version? They updated alot of the features. Including using background images instead of just a solid color or gradient fill. Id appreciate it!"
,rickrocka,2013-03-18T22:59Z,Has anyone got this crack to work with Muse 4.0 in Windows? 
,fatalyst,2013-03-20T05:06Z,"The crack that worked for version 3.2 doesn't work well for 4.1 -- Adobe Muse starts normally, but you can't open some 2nd level menus (all Object > Insert {someting}...)

BTW, some can also try Xara Designer Pro for visual web page creation; it provides similar to Adobe Muse features and much more."
,sumer12,2013-03-22T14:24Z,"I have Problems with Win7, after the 30 days trial version. It says your trail has been expired! Need Help...  "
,xDW,2013-04-11T05:56Z,Can you be tracked by using Muse to create your own website using the HMTL created?
,KGBMICHEL,2013-04-12T06:36Z,We need a crack for actual Adobe muse ( The 4.0)...
,flowerii,2013-04-20T12:47Z,does anyone know where can i find mac version? :(
,pt109,2013-04-24T08:00Z,"Yes the crack for 4.0 Mac please, or anyone has the 3.2 dmg? it is no longer available for download so no way to run 3.2 either."
,remozito,2013-04-25T01:19Z,"I think the crack just block the time limit, but i've not all functions.. For exemple, hyperlinks are not availables."
,romintang,2013-05-04T15:03Z,"Thank you for this upload. 
@fatalyst is true it's not working for latest version 4.1
And it's true also imho, xara designer pro 7 and xara web designer premium 9 is a lot better than muse."
