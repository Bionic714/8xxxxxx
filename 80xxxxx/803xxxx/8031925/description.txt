Prepare to take the Commandos on their deadliest mission yet as you infiltrate deep behind enemy lines across three extensive campaigns. From the frozen ruins of Stalingrad through to the forests of central Europe and onto the beaches of Normandy, your men must use their skills to confound the enemy.

These men are the best the Allies have - are you fit to lead them?
