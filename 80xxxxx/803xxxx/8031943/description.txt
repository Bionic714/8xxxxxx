My newest torrent here includes The Lord of the Rings series in epub format with cover art. The collection also includes 'The Hobbit', which I'm sure needs no explaining especially with the new movie and all. Though it's not officially a part of the series, I think that it belongs here with these books.

This download includes the following:
 [1937] The Hobbit


 [1954] The Fellowship of the Ring


 [1954] The Two Towers


 [1955] The Return of the King


 Thanks for taking the time to check this out. If you a fan of reading check out my other ebook torrents! PLEASE SEED!!!
