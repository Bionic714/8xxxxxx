VIDEO :
This is not a dumbed-down HDTV version !
Don't let the size of the release fool you, it is possible to achieve top quality at such low bitrate, whith the adequate tech.
This is proper HD in all its glory. This is visually as good as the source, as long as you use ffdshow to watch it (just install K-Lite Codec Pack if you're a noob, and forget about VLC), since ffdshow has the deband filter activated by default -otherwise you'll still have something very nice with some banding here and there.
Reception was close to perfect if not perfect. The channel broadcasting this had a few hardcoded french inserts, the rare times when something danish appears on the screen or someone speaks in a non-danish,non-french language, bar that, you have a BluRay rip equivalent.
