POtHS Comment: His BLOOD is the only thing that Redeems us.

Description:

Pastor Gary C. Price is the Senior Pastor of Omega Church and Ministries Center located in Atlanta, Georgia. He has been ministering to the Body of Christ under an anointing that deals specifically with the bondage of the inner-man.

Pastor Price believes that the present day Church has lost the vision that Jesus Christ imparted to the Apostles before He departed to be enthroned with His Father. He also believes that the Church must be brought to repentance and humility through self denial in order for God to move in these last days. When listening to his words many have received the revelations of a prophetic voice calling the Church back to patriarchal authority and obedience to the Holy Spirit.


Seed long and Prosper with Blessings from our Father. I have prayed to The Father, Bless all that Seed Long. (I have 4 year old active seeds out there, must be working for some folks!)

Ephesians 5:11
11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove (expose) them.
