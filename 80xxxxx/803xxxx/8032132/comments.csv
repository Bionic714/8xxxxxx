,rosstitute,2013-01-21T18:44Z,How on earth has this got +8? The audio is awful.
[T],dabadguy69,2013-01-21T21:49Z,"change the audio to stereo if you dont have 5.1,  it has 5.1, stereo and mono.  "
,pro346pro,2013-01-24T08:35Z,128k 5.1 sound maybe you should up the bitrate to 192k if your using aac. the program megui(its freeware) allows many different audio settings better than all the programs your meant to pay for . P.s really like your rips.
[T],dabadguy69,2013-01-24T20:17Z,thanks for the info.  my encoder only allows up to 160 kb
