,silentinquiry,2013-01-18T16:11Z,"Demo only with watermark. The original doesnt open in theaters till feb 1, 2013"
,BigSniff,2013-01-18T17:54Z,"Demo only with watermark? What, like a screener? The title kinda says that already."
,silentinquiry,2013-01-19T03:45Z,"For christ sake.DVDSCR does not mean it is guaranteed to have watermarks.. Tying to save people all the time like I had to do, downloading it only to find it is ruined with those distracting watermarmks. If youcan't same something constructive, shut up and mind your own business."
,silentinquiry,2013-01-19T03:50Z,"Incidetly its a great movie, audio and video are 10's, cant wait till a clean dvd copy comes out. "
,idontbelievethis,2013-01-19T05:02Z,bigsniff. You've been sniffing too much glue. Are you telling us all screeners have watermarks? What planet are you from? get real
,tinypenis,2013-01-24T15:08Z,"BigSniff may have been a bit antagonizing but, his point is still a good one. Uploads labeled as a screener should be assumed to have watermarks - be pleasantly surprised when they don't. Nothing wrong with remarking on the invasiveness of the watermarks though."
,ChBukow,2013-01-26T14:09Z,"This copy has bad IVTC causing stuttering. Frame sequence is (frame, frame, frame, repeat previous frame) and so forth. It's better than the BiGKATS release which drops frames on top of stuttering, but still a pain to watch. Also, the white level is elevated (i.e. black becomes gray). Getting the MYSTiC version, hoping that one is proper."
,batmansun,2013-01-28T14:59Z,"This as good as it gets in the real sense, everything perfect, three great actors the mainstay of this movie, no words to describe anyone of them, Julianna Margulies a good actress herself looks wooden in comparison, though it would be unfair. Quality was so-so but there is a HD one at stand.blake7.net which worked great for me. Enjoy this entertaining movie!"
,Taurean22,2013-01-28T22:17Z,Do you fucking morons really believe anyone here is stupid enough to believe that there is a better copy out there that magically did not find its way to the pirate bay?  FUCK OFF!
