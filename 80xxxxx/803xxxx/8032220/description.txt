Teaching and Learning Early Number is a bestselling guide for all trainee and practising Early Years teachers and classroom assistants. It provides an accessible guide to a wide range of research evidence about the teaching and learning of early number.

Major changes in the primary mathematics curriculum over the last decade - such as the National Numeracy Strategy, the Primary National Strategy, the Early Years Foundation Stage and the Williams Review - have greatly influenced the structure of this new edition. The book includes:

- A new introductory chapter to set the scene
- Six further new chapters - including Mathematics through play, Children's mathematical graphics and Interview-based assessment of early number knowledge
- Six completely re-written chapters and two updated chapters
- A new concluding chapter looking to the future

The chapters can be read in a standalone fashion and many are cross referenced to other parts of the book where specific ideas are dealt with in a different manner. Issues addressed include: new research on the complex process of counting and on children's written mathematical marks; counting in the home environment and play in the school setting; the importance of mathematical representations and of ICT in children's understanding of number; errors and misconceptions and the assessment of childrenΓÇÖs number knowledge.
