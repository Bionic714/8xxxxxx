My collection of photos from modern Athens, Greece.

Most of them are from the 2008+ uprising since a murder of a 15 year old kid by the police took place, and the more recent economic downfall which... didn't quite help our beautiful city.

Also included are some photos from the 1896 Olympic Games, photos of various times during the 20th century, and some under-construction photos of the Athens Metro (2000+).
