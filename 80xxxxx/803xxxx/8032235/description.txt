This text is designed for use in a senior undergraduate or graduate level course in Fourier Transforms. This text differs from many other fourier transform books in its emphasis on applications. Bracewell applies mathematical concepts to the physical world throughout this text, equipping students to think about the world and physics in terms of transforms. The pedagogy in this classic text is excellent. The author has included such tools as the pictorial dictionary of transforms and bibliographic references. In addition, there are many excellent problems throughout this book, which are more than mathematical exercises, often requiring students to think in terms of specific situations or asking for educated opinions. To aid students further, discussions of many of the problems can be found at the end of the book.
