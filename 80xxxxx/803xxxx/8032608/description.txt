And here is a little gem from Alice. It is a spinoff of Lanfeust of Troy.

This is a FIXED version, my first upload was of an older version, Alice did fixed versions of all 3 books. So get this instead :)

This do like many european comics feature nudity, so depending on your location, it might not be safe for children :)

Troy, the world where everyone has magical powers... Now separated from Lanfeust after his departure from Xingdu Palace, Cixi decides to return to Eckmul on her own. We find her much later, installed in the capital of the elders in a double life; at once mistress of Thanos and vigilante by night. But what happened in the meantime? How did she get there? The secret of Cixi delivers a cocktail of adventure and humour that made such a sublime success of Lanfeust...
