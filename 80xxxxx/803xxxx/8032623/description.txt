Criticism of the Western Civilization - Collection 26 (Crime & Violence):

The mass shooting and killing of innocent people is only one form of the violent crimes that are plaguing the Western societies. There are many factors that make the situation worse: a culture and history of violence, a media that glorifies violence, deteriorating economic conditions, drugs, increase in the cases of depression and mental disorders, easy accessibility to guns,  increased levels of extremism, fanaticism and racism, and the deterioration of the moral and religious values.
