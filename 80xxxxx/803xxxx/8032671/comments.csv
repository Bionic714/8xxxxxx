,sebolito,2013-01-19T00:57Z,need more seeders im stuck at 57%
,allegra_geller,2013-01-19T09:00Z,"mistarz: your upload does NOT contain permanent serial. C4D serials looks like this: 14333392167-RTFM-BAMF-ERTY-WGVG (example, not a real SN)

Not like the one you provided: 14400092590

Do your homework"
,zmw637053,2013-01-19T09:10Z,"Serial included is not working. Gives an error saying ""Please paste at least one valid serial."" I'm just posting the 11 numbers, am I doing something wrong?"
,wazakakaa,2013-01-19T09:42Z,"fishy! fishy! fishy! serial incomplete and .dmg wants to write something to your comp b4 open, too bad!"
,sebolito,2013-01-19T13:04Z,"not complete permanent serial

,mistarz,2013-01-19T15:18Z,"14400000518-ABCD-EFGH-IJKL-MNOP

Should work.

,pinkdice13,2013-02-06T21:55Z,Dude.. Wtf I was so excited that this finally downloaded and the whole file is 1mb? what did you do to C4d?? It wouldn't come up as a virus otherwise...
,mistarz,2013-02-19T20:25Z,"@pinkdice13

Im sure you did something wrong....as it says above its 6.35 GB.Its the full C4D R14 and it works perfect with the Xforce serials i posted.
So maybe you just downloaded 1 MB of data.

,FentonSpadrig,2013-03-01T19:05Z,"Not Studio, only Broadcast... unfortunately."
,mistarz,2013-03-05T17:35Z,"@FentonSpadrig

Its Studio.
I reuploaded the keygen.
See my torrents.
Open up the keygen paste your serial wich you find in your installed c4d r14 under HELP>Personalise and voilā its Studio version."
,ma978630,2013-03-14T21:04Z,"I made the mistake of copying and pasting the whole serial number list and installing them. Now whenever I try to reinstall the program, it only installs as Broadcast. It does this even after being completely uninstalled and after I used to new serials. 

Any help would be awesome!"
,buboh,2013-03-16T22:47Z,"Works for me with the keygen, theres just one problem: After updating it, its converted from C4D Studio to C4D Prime.. Maybe I'm just doing something wrong, help would be awesome :)"
,ruredi,2013-03-20T08:55Z,"If the installation started there is nothing happens. 
Log file:
21:28:48 19.03.2013 : Start installation
21:28:48 19.03.2013 : Calculating space
21:28:48 19.03.2013 : Copying installer files
21:28:50 19.03.2013 : Restarting Application

So i can not install it. :("
,XthedoomlegacyX,2013-04-01T00:16Z,"Great torrent! works great :) when you first install it, paste all the serials in. When you open cinema 4D you will only get broadcast version, so go top help and then personalize and paste back the serials again. Then you will get studio with all the other versions :) "
,mistarz,2013-04-11T23:53Z,"Props @ XthedoomlegacyX
i knew not all are dumb :P"
,mofwa,2013-05-14T00:08Z,"Hi! 
I followed all the steps, updated and tried to insert the serials that extra time but it's just Prime. Not even the text ""There is a new version coming when you restart"" is shown. I tried to remove mca file in /library/preferences and uninstalled the software. No difference. Any ideas? "
,Towkind,2013-05-25T00:07Z,AWESOME!!! thank you for this awesome upload! :D
