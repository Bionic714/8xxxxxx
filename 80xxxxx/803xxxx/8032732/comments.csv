Every day is a live-fire exercise for Christian and Alex, who buy, sell, trade, and restore some of the world’s rarest firearms. But with two experts in the family under one warehouse roof, the office politics can be as explosive as the weapons being sold. Family dynamics take on a unique flavor at the Cranmers’ International Military Antiques (IMA), where the questions of the day include whether or not to buy a $250,000 Korean War-era tank; or if it is better to unload a $25,000 British colonial cannon now or let it gain value for later. Figuring out the road to take is no job for the paper-pushers, especially when the only place to learn the real worth of the goods is on the firing range.
