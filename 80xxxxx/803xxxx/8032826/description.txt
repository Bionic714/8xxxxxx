Mari0 1.6 (Jimbus edition)
---------

A great installer for this wonderful game.


About the game:
--------------

Two genre defining games from completely different eras: Nintendo's Super Mario Bros. and Valve's Portal. These two games managed to give Platformers and First-Person Puzzle Games a solid place in the video game world. But what if Nintendo teamed up with Valve and recreated the famous Mario game with Portal gun mechanics?

A complete from scratch recreation of Super Mario Bros. with a focus on perfectly imitating the feel the 1985 classic gave us. Then give Mario a portal gun, add puzzle game mechanics from Portal and there you go. And if that wasn't crazy enough, play 4-player coop, with everyone having their own Portal gun!


Features:
--------

- Complete recreation of SMB
- Elements from Portal
- Portal gun that shoots portals
- 4-player simultaneous coop
- Level Editor that was used to create the levels in the game
- 33 different hats
- Downloadable Mappacks
- Game modifiers for extra fun


Just install and play. The installer will place a shortcut at the desktop and an entry at the control panel to easily uninstall the game.
