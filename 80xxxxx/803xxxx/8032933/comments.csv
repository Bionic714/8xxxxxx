,geek4real,2013-01-19T14:18Z,"The sound in this and several other PublicHD movies recently plays only the commentary audio track when I use MPC-HC.  When this file is played in VLC or Splayer I hear the normal audio track.

I like to use MPC-HC for my surround sound though (with AC3 Filter).  Does anyone know how to turn off the commentaries for an mkv file in MPC-HC???  

(File is great otherwise. Thanks!)"
