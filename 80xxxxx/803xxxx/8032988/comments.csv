I will rate it at A10 V9 and thats only because its a bit grainy but I do not know if thats the way the movie was meant to be or not... Great job though TvTeam!!!

Actors rocked, really really good acting! Quality was great! At site aole.ciroblazevic.com there is Django and Hobbit in HD already, great stuff! Thnx once again for this fantastic movie!"
