,bobsfougarakhs,2013-01-22T14:02Z,Well the truth is that the KMS instructions are written using English words but in a language other than English... I had to take a look at the instructions given on another torrent which used KMS. It works flawlessly nonetheless!
,brianxxx,2013-01-22T14:36Z,"@bobs - 
then post that link or copy and paste those instructions for others. A lot of noobs are confused by KMS tools and I have typed my fair share of how tos."
[V],2010kaiser,2013-01-22T17:22Z,"They're a GOOGLE translation from Russian.

Fell free to post your imterpretation of the instructions for any users having difficulty with KMS ;-)"
