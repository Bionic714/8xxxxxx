And here you go, the FIRST album in Loisel's fantasy series, Roxanna & the Quest for the Time-Bird. I do sadly NOT have access to the rest, so can't scan them :(


The world of Akbar is in danger: Ramor, the cursed god, is about to be liberated. The sorceress Mara has found a way to prevent the god's resurrection and to bind him again to his prison, a conch. To succeed during the incantation however, she needs the legendary Time-Bird, a mythical beast able to control the flow of time. She sends her daughter, Pelisse (Roxanna in the English translation) to a past lover, Bragon, once a fearsome warrior, now a gray-haired lord of the manor, to convince the aging hero to embark on one last adventure in order to save the world of Akbar.

Themes of the comics include imaginary fauna and flora and nostalgia, as aging heroes deal with their fading glory, new heroes take their place and villains accept their past and manage to find peace. A melancholic mood permeates the whole story.
