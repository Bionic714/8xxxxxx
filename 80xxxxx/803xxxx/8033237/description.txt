This BEST OFΓÇª package has taken tracks from thirteen albums over the period of 1980 to 2006 and is just phenomenal. Normally ΓÇÿBest OfΓÇÖ albums tend to have a few mediocre tracks whilst leaving out fan favourites, this one though does not have one bad track and any great tracks that were left out was only because they probably run out of roomΓÇªthat is the problem of having so many super songs recorded over the years!

All the favourites are there such as Twenty Nine Ways, the fast TalkinΓÇÖ Woman Blues on which Paul does the brilliant ΓÇÿtalk too muchΓÇÖ bit at the end, MaggieΓÇÖs Farm, the Gary Fletcher penned Green Stuff that has become a kind of signature tune at their live gigs, Come On In plus many more-in fact there are 41 crackers on this excellent 2CD set.

Paul Jones does an awesome rendition of Georgia On My Mind from the album THANK YOU BROTHER RAY, Dave Kelly takes lead vocals on tracks such as the smooth Leave My Woman Alone as well as adding some scintillating slide guitar.

Tom McGuinness is brilliant as ever on lead guitar alongside the top class rhythm section of Gary Fletcher on bass guitar and drummer Rob Townsend, although the earlier tracks have Hughie Flint on drums who left in 1982 to be replaced by Rob. Also you cannot talk about the musicianship of this band without mentioning the harmonica playing of Paul Jones, he is one of the greatest blues harp players around and if you donΓÇÖt believe me then just listen to this album.

I was lucky enough to have become a fan of British rhythm and blues in the mid 1970ΓÇÖs and my three favourite bands are still going today; Dr Feelgood, Nine Below Zero and The Blues Band-long may they keep playing as British music needs them. The only way I can finish this review is to reiterate how tremendous this 2CD set is. Now all you need to do is go out and buy it!
