DLed in about 10mins, scanned with Avira (clean). Jumped around the movie to check it out, haven't watched it all the way through, but so far:

V:9
A:10

Great rip, thanks a lot!"

I D/Led a bunch of other high-res versions and they all have a DTS audio - what is that? I can't play it, can't burn it to a DVD either. I almost gave up, but now this one is the ticket. THANKS for a great job!"
