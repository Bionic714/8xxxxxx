And this is another one I'll surely look into.

I just finished reading the two volumes of The theory of the grain of sand by Schuiten & Peeters, from their Obscure Cities collection, in a portuguese translation (in paper, not e-book). It was awesome! If you haven't read it, I highly recommend it :)

Cheers"
