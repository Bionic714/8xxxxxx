[V],murphy78,2013-01-18T07:55Z,It didn't work for me when I was running a torrent program. I shut the program down and then it worked fine.  Make sure you don't have any security programs or other programs running.

[V],murphy78,2013-01-18T12:43Z,"pro wmc is retail only. KMS is volume activation, so you need normal pro, pro N, pro vl, pro N vl, enterprise, or enterprise N...

It says so right in the description..."
,mitulv,2013-01-18T19:32Z,thanks for this! will try.. but does it unlock the personalization settings? can we change wallpapers etc.?
,mitulv,2013-01-18T19:49Z,does this activate personalization settings?
[V],murphy78,2013-01-18T21:55Z,You can do everything you would normally do with windows. This program does not hack system files.
,alsta,2013-01-19T02:15Z,"ou must know, that MS deactivated my Windows 8 pro and Office 2013 this morning. There was the message that I did used software to activate Windows. Installation key was removed.  Tried to use KMSnano once more, but it not worked. 
Earlier used KMSnano about 4 times to increase lease time. It was experimental installation. :)"
[T],crwildman,2013-01-19T03:22Z,"@murphy78  Why was a new version released so soon after this one?   

You said it didn't work when you had a torrent program running.  That is probably the only thing i had running on that fresh installation lol.

Oh well, I uninstalled it... Ill give it another go eventually."
