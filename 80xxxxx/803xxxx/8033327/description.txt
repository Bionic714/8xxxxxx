KMSNano - The Ultimate Activator by heldigard of MDL forums
Based on the work of Ratiborus's KMSmicro v3.10
heldigard gives many thanks in his text file.
Read it and you can find out who else are activation champions.

This is v12.  There are other earlier versions that may or may not work currently.
You should always check for the latest version before using.
I have personally tested this as working with my Windows 8 Pro Jan2013 release.

KMSnano - is the ideal tool to activate the final version of Windows 7/8 and
Office 2010/2013. Activator does not require user intervention, the entire
activation process takes place in the background, just run the activator
and a couple of minutes to check the activation status of Windows and / or Office.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Activates: Windows Vista/7/8 Business/Pro/Ent/N/VL and
Windows Server Std/Data 2008/2008R2/2012, as well as Office 2010/2013.
-Other Versions will NOT activate-
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Requirements: . NET 4.0 or Windows 8

Instructions:

1. Prescan file and then shut down Security Programs and any other running programs.
2. Extract the zip file. (Optional - I ran from within zip)
3. Run KMSnano.exe
4. Wait about 120secs while the files run in the background.
(It doesn't let you know when it's done, you can check task manager or just wait)
5. Run the Check_Activation.cmd to verify your activation status.
6. Go about your business. You can get the Win8 watermark to go away by
auto-hiding the taskbar or similar system stuff. (WindowsKey+D works also)

To fix any botched activations from other "hacktivators" or activation problems
in general, you can run admin command prompt command "SFC /SCANNOW"

To see if your currect activation is working, run the included script:
Check_Activation.cmd inside the zip file. That will list Windows and Office
activations. Read the included text file for more info.

Note that Pre-Release versions of Office or Windows will NEVER activate.
Get an actual release if you want to activate. (RTM or Retail)

Why use this program over any other activation method?
It does not modify any of your system files.
Because it's not a crack or a hack.
Because it's the only way to get legit activation without using legit servers.
Did I mention it activates ALL KMS activation software?

Change Log from 11.2:
- Code Improved.
- Add TriggerKMS to install task scheduler or check activation and run KMSnano.exe
(I haven't tried it, but apparently you can schedule "run trigger.cmd" every so
often and have it figure out if re-activation is necessary and re-run kmsnano.exe)

(Big Salute to heldigard and Ratiborus if you are reading this)
