Consisting of 4 new tracks, fun is the most desired object this year! Except not desired at all! 

The reason for this being an EP is that there aren't enough tracks to warrant it a full album in itself and the tracks that I could have added to these do not fit the style. Like 3.48 Shark. Does that fit? Nope. 

It's also the shortest "album" I have ever made, being at a mere 8:43, not counting the instrumental. Comparing this to my other work, even demo tracks be longer. 

Why is the cover name in Japanese? Because I was bored and I had John Lennon's son on my mind for some reason.
