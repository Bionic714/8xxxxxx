Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site :: On the Thursday, January 17 broadcast of the Alex Jones Show, Alex continues confronting the deluge of anti-gun rights propaganda being spewed forth by mainstream media outlets intent on aiding the destruction of the US Constitution. 

Alex will also break down the importance of calling for Obama's impeachment and the sounding of the war drums in Africa. 

On today's show, Alex welcomes Jackson County, Kentucky Sheriff Denny Peyman, one of the sheriffs who recently indicated that he will not enforce federal actions violating the Constitution. 

Also on today's show, we welcome Ron Paul's former congressional chief of staff and constitutional lawyer Lew Rockwell to give his take on the ensuing all out frontal assault on personal sovereignty.
