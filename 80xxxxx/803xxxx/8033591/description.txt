This is the Hirgana section of Japanese Pod 101 (japanesepod101.com)

I made all these videos perfect for iTunes so you can just drag and drop them into iTunes and they will be in order by season ep. 1 2 3 etc....

you can also put them on you iPod iPhone iPad and they will be neatly organized so you can find them easily... was a pain in the ass to do all this so enjoy :)

i will also be uploading katakana and the whole basic Japanese serious

my internet is not the best so the first people to download it, it might take quite some time im sorry for that....

please see and share :)
