,slymarino,2013-01-18T07:05Z,Theslcguy it's because there is 2 cd files!!!

I think I'll pass on this one.

,honkeyman,2013-01-19T01:13Z,"Why post so much negativity?

Instead of complaining that it's a split movie, provide advice and/or torrent to combine videos.
Instead of complaining about size, be grateful you have access to a decent copy of a movie weeks before it's dvd release date.
And quit talking about what you think of the movie itself (not video/audio quality)...the comments section are not intended to discuss who your least favorite actor is..find some douchey forum to post your douchey opinions.

Having said that, scene4all you are the shit."

take care, Zenith"

,MrSmartyPants,2013-01-19T12:02Z,"honkeyman, Sorry, I just wanted to say 'monkey balls' in conjunction with some bad actor, and Kevin James seemed like the perfect opportunity to do so.

I'll keep my comments to A/V next time. I can't this time, because I didn't DL the movie, because Kevin James sucks monkey balls (in the middle of the summer [in a really swelteringly hot clime])."

lol also did you know that google chrome is a brutal web browser? :P"
,watty42,2013-01-19T21:51Z,"@jammer77a 

addition to my previous comment, google chrome will undoubtedly register tpb as a malware site due to the Digital Millennium Copy Act...  considering there is new ordinance stating that google will no longer show thepiratebay as a ""search suggestion""... for some reason they think that the majority of traffic going to tpb is simply through people searching google (highly unlikely), and Chrome is just a garbage empty web browser that is just google's piss poor effort of jumping into the browser market.. I suggest a nice installation of firefox, mainly for a safer form of ""do not track"" (an area where google had been lacking in until one of its later revisions in 2012) 

Cheers!"

Movie is really good if you watch it without any prejudice. Its not really a comedy movie but a good movie with some comedy.. :)"

,briebee72,2013-01-27T22:51Z,"Ciniva is not just on ps3. it is also on alot of newer bluray players that also play files and it is also on alot of newer recievers.  my 800 dollar reciever has ciniva protection on it. It would be nice if uploaders along with all the other info would put if the movies are ciniva protected so those of us who dont want to sit in a shitty office chair and watch a movie on a computer monitor wouldnt waste our time downloading the stuff.

you either have to play these movies on a computer or off some cheap ass walmart dvd player that also plays files. as nice high end equipment all has the protection. even my frekin aquas tv has the damn chip in it.

so stop all the ps3 dogging its not just ps3's "
,pl4c3b0,2013-01-28T02:41Z,"If you were screwed by cinivia protection its because you bought the wrong equipment like a moron. Ever heard of htpc? Lol ps3 and bluray is already a dying technology, but the PC will always be here to stay. Plus most of us use our pc on the TVs we have anyway since they are almost identical to computer monitors. Stupid people and stupid investments. You mad? Good."

,ianpac1969,2013-02-02T06:52Z,All new BD players from Feb 2012 onwards are mandated to have Cinavia activated so this will become a big issue soon as more people upgrade to a BD player.  It is unlikely the Cinavia code will ever be cracked so it looks like the focus will be on issuing hacked firmware releases for the BD players

Movie overall felt rushed, completely unrealistic storyline. Good acting though by the cast, and there were a few moments where I did find myself genuinely laughing, but otherwise a terrible film."

Yeah, totally. That's why poeple cant watch this movie on their epic failstation. DERP

Seriously though, in this case your absolutely right. Your failstation is better. It's doing you a huge favor by not letting you watch this utter garbage
