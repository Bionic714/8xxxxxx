,Tiger_Zip,2013-01-19T17:41Z,"The sever named: Hades :

Started 4 Days ago and the population is growing extremly high fast. The reason for this is that its built on a new system that people like.
Right now its low bc it havent been on for so long yet.
What i know is that they nerfed the bosses for 1 more week so that ppl have chance to get gear before the pop goes up.
But 2 players on? NO the homepage are having an real issue connecting with the server so it will always show that sort of numbers.
once your ingame you will notice it.


Have fun playing guys!"
,zifnab369,2013-01-20T06:24Z,If I already have the current xpac of WOW do I need to delete that or will this work as a different DL?
,Tiger_Zip,2013-01-20T14:06Z,"You dont have to delete anything.
This is like a portable World Of Warcraft.
If you allredy have one installed you dont have to delete it just dont place this one inside that one or something like that. as long as you place it inside a diffrent folder it will work fine.
Dont forget ppl to always start using
""WoW.EXE""
Do Not use the Luncher.exe"
