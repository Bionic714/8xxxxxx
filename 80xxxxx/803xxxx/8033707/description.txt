The autobiography of Henri Charriere, one of the few people to
successfully escape from the notorious French penal colony of
Devil's Island, served as the basis for Papillon. Steve McQueen
plays the pugnacious Charriere (known as "Papillon," or "butterfly,
" because of a prominent tatoo), incarcerated--wrongly, he claims--
for murdering a pimp. He saves the life of fellow convict Louis Dega
(Dustin Hoffman), a counterfeiter who will later show his gratitude
by helping Charriere in his many escape attempts, and by smuggling 
food to Charriere when the latter is put in solitary confinement. 
One breakout, which takes Charriere and Dega to a leper colony and 
then to a native encampment, is almost successful, but Charriere is 
betrayed (allegedly because he stopped for an act of kindness) and 
back the prisoners go to French Guiana. Years later, Dega is made a 
trustee and is content with his lot, but the ageing, white-haired 
Charriere cannot be held back. A tribute to the unquenchability of 
the human spirit,
