I just finished reading the x-men chronology and I was looking for avengers and spiderman!

So about the avengers chronology,YES PLEASE "
,blackkami,2013-01-19T21:54Z,@Keeper21 Could you tell me where you found the x-men chronology?
,FriendlySpidey,2013-02-02T00:01Z,"There  was an extensive X-Men chronology in 17 parts on Demonoid, so maybe that's the one? 

My landlord got mad at me because it caused me to exceed his ISP's tiny bandwidth cap."
,Jakemeister5,2013-03-10T23:44Z,"You can find that X-Men Chronology on H33T now...

And I second the motion for an Avengers Chronology....and maybe make a motion for a Fantastic Four Chronology!

Thanks for these, they're great!!"
