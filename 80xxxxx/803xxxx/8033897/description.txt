"After School Special"

Appearing unexpectedly at Mystic Falls High, 
Rebekah wastes no time trying to force Stefan, 
Elena and Caroline to answer her questions about 
the search for a cure, leading to a bombshell piece 
of information from Elena. When Bonnie's father, 
Rudy Owens, accepts the role of Interim Mayor, he 
makes it a priority to protect his daughter, who 
isn't at all comfortable with the role he suddenly 
wants to play in her life. Professor Shane 
continues to encourage Bonnie to believe in her 
powers, but he soon finds himself in danger when he 
reveals too much to the wrong person. Later, 
Caroline does her best to comfort Tyler after a 
violent confrontation. Meanwhile, at the lake 
house, Damon and Matt train Jeremy, trying to raise 
his game as a hunter, but Klaus is impatient with 
their progress and intervenes to speed up the 
process.
