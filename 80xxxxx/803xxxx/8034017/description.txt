This PC monitoring solution ensures the productivity of your employees and protects company secrets from being stolen. It offers simple remote install over a network and real-time access to all reports and logs.

Key Features:
Keystroke recording:
Once installed and running, Refog registers all keys pressed by a user, thus acting as a keylogger. This function captures all data that has been entered by an employee using a keyboard, including chats, usernames, passwords, emails, search queries and other content. In addition to key logging, Refog is also able to log clipboard text.

Remote monitoring:
It is never necessary to install Employee Monitor manually, as the remote installation feature enables setup of Refog on all network PCs in just a few mouse clicks. All that is required is the admin user password for the domain or computers. All reports are available over the network, and when necessary these can be accessed in real-time.

Web history logging:
Even if users delete their browser's history, the informaton is retained in Refog's log database and always available via the reports function. All relevant information is collected including URLs visited, page titles and the timestamp.

Screenshot history:
With customizable capability, Refog takes full color screenshots of a desktop screen. This ensures that the log of what is being typed by the user is backed up with visual evidence of exactly what they are doing. Without being monitored, it is often the case that employees get carried away with excessive web surfing, shopping and other personal tasks. With screenshot history, it is always possible to gather evidence if an employee is wasting the company's time. Multiple monitor configurations are supported!
