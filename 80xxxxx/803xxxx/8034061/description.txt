"So You Don't Want to Dance?"

In an attempt to rally votes for new 
educational reforms, President Gilchrist 
and First Lady Emily hold an extravagant 
gala to gain the support of the unlikable 
Senator Thoroughgood, who attends with 
his wife Bunny. Meanwhile, Skip builds 
the confidence to ask Stacey, the 
mailroom clerk, to the event. Elsewhere, 
Becca reveals a hidden past between her 
and Marshall.
