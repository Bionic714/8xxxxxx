Finally, a decent Sly & The Family Stone Discography torrent!

I can't believe there isn't at least 1 good Sly & The Family Stone Discography torrent around, but now there is. The only studio albums that aren't here are 1976's "Heard Ya Missed Me, Well I'm Back", 1979's "Back on the Right Track", and 1982's "Ain't But The One Way" because I don't consider them "Real" Sly & The Family Stone albums, so sorry if anyone is dissapointed about that.

Also included here are 3 pretty decent bootlegs; 1 from 1969 and 2 from 1970.

As usual, everything here has a CBR of 320.
