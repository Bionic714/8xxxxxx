"BETRAYAL," Part 13
After the hostage trade, Cressida ends up in the Achaean camp, far from Troilus, her lover in Troy. The Achaeans treat her little better than a whore, while her father, the Trojan traitor Kalchas, won't listen to her pleading. Only Diomedes gives her any respect - but can Diomedes survive in battle against Troilus?
