Connecting with Computer Science, 2nd Ed., by Anderson, Ferro and Hilton.

NOTE: This torrent is of an error-riddled PDF. Seriously.

So why would I make a torrent out of it? Because I've yet to find a better PDF for this particular book, and 'something' is slightly better than 'nothing.' (It's like a busted-up library book, but without the aura of pestilence.)


I fiddled around with pdftk for a few minutes to see if could improve the error situation. Alas, no go. (And, I'll be honest, I didn't try for long.)

So if you find a better PDF of this book, please use it instead, and pretend this torrent never existed. Until then, at least you can see what the end-of-chapter exercises are, that you were assigned for class. (Hopefully. I didn't actually check to see if those pages were all error-free.)
