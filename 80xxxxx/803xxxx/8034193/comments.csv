[V],STFmaryville,2013-01-18T13:21Z,"I don't know if that's a selling point or a drawback, so I'll add that this is a 1st issue that stands on its own. You don't have to know anything about any other comic. If you can relate to a young man starting his first ""real"" job -- and it just happens to be as an interplanetary astronaut -- I think you'll enjoy this! I think it is outstanding."
