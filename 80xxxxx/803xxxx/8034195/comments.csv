Rename this episode to

Archer (2009) - 4x01 - Fugue and Riffs

For XBMC to recognize it."

,swampmatt,2013-01-18T08:20Z,Looks great! Can I request that you leave more of the credits on at the end instead of just cutting at the drumroll? It's kind of nice to see who the guest voices were without having to look up every episode's credits on IMDB. I loved the quality of your rip! Thanks again!

I would but they get cut off because of stuff at the end, I can leave it there in the future if you would like, but its not really visible."
