============================================

This Torrent contains the following complete collection of Andrew Loomis Books 

which are in public domain and collected from various sources on the Internet.

3. Figure Drawing

4. Fun with a Pencil

5. Heads Hands

Penned almost 75 years ago by Andrew Loomis, this is a treasure for students of 

drawing and those who want to learn 3D modelling in Maya, 3D Max, Softimage, 

Cinema 4D, Photoshop, CorelDRAW and other allied software programs. Grab them 

while you can, for such a complete collection does not exist anywhere on the 

Internet  and is rarely available in hard copy. Please seed so that others can 

share this treasure :)



My similar torrent (uploaded about 2 years back) was deleted from TPB ( I don't 

know why), but I am reuploading this again as there was a demand for this even as 

late as 10 Jan 2013. It seems that with every torrent I upload, my oldest torrent 

gets deleted. I have lost quite a few good 'In Demand' torrents this way !

Please seed to keep this torrent alive.


I have also included excellent 146 Handwriting Fonts for Windows in this torrent.

==============================================================================

THE MOMENT WE REPENT AND ASK GOD FOR FORGIVENESS FOR OUR LAPSE, WE ARE PURGED OF 

OUR SIN AND NEW LIFE BEGINS FOR US. TRUE REPENTANCE IS AN ESSENTIAL PREREQUISITE 

OF PRAYER.


===============================================================================

GOD BLESS.
