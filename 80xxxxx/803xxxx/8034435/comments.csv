I hate to make requests BUT...I'd look forward to an HD version of this!"
,bp1924,2013-01-18T09:21Z,"The HD version would have to come from someone else. Sadly, I only get the OWN network in standard definition. I will have part two uploaded after it airs tomorrow."

,Matvej,2013-01-18T12:04Z,"What a great torrent, thanks bp! 

sycophat, scum and liar, liar even in the interview with Oprah. PEOPLE DONT CHANGE..."
,DieKuche,2013-01-18T17:57Z,"thanks for the upload!

And he's still dodging and not owning up to his responsibility. "
,tigonridge,2013-01-18T20:21Z,"Thanks for uploading. In my eyes, Lance has been and still is a great human being. Some will still call him a liar no matter what he will say. It takes serious grit and dedication to be an endurance racer, I don't care how much drugs you've used. Lance wasn't the only one who drugged by far; but as of yet, he's the only one who's admitted to it."
,tigonridge,2013-01-18T20:29Z,GO LANCE!!! :D
,WuzzlePopple,2013-01-18T21:05Z,"Laughing out loud literally to the person who wants this in HD, as if his confessions will come in more clearer. As if you are going to watch it over and over again just to see the wonderful color and listen to the wonder sound in HD. Yes, please upload this in HD, I'm sure the graphics, the special effects will come in all it's beautiful glory. We might get to see boogers up Lance's nose if we can get this in HD! And if you upload this in HD, I will be able to put along side my bluerays!"
,tigonridge,2013-01-18T21:14Z,Let me correct something. He was NOT the only one who admitted. 
,thehyperkid,2013-01-18T22:14Z,"@WuzzlePopple lol so true.... and hopefully in 5.1 sound, I'll crank my subwoofer!"
,chadoboku,2013-01-19T01:43Z,"thanks for the vid, cant wait for part 2 where we get the real story.

heres my editorial

Lance Armstrong, Take away everything but you cant take away those 7 yellow shirts hes got hanging on his wall.

A champion. A hero to many, A professional cyclist. A performance enhancer user, He had a big secret, He won seven bicycle races with the help of his friends, A Doctor by the name of Ferrari, helped him enhance his body. There has been a culture of many cyclists using performance enhancing substances since the 90’s and doctors have helped them do it. Armstrong says it would not be possible to do what he did without the enhancers. A member of his former team, a RAT sang to the choir. On national television, he and others pointed the finger at lance Armstrong, telling everyone that he had been using performance enhancing substances. A liar and a bully. He has been banned from all sports, he cant even run, without someone telling him hes cheating. Nike dropped him as a sponsor, and he lost a 70 million dollar endorsement deal. Live strong cancer organization has asked him to step down. And all of the people whom he sued, are now suing him back, and want the money back they spent, or paid him. Everyone will try to take him down now, put him in jail, and make him pay lots of money, and admit the entire truth about everything. But he will only tell half the truth, what they need to hear. He will pay some money back. He wont goto jail, he wont serve time, why? Because he is a celebrity now. They will try to tell him what he cant do now, and they will try to take away everything the man has gained. But one thing they wont take away are those 7 awsome yellow shirts on his wall. =D
