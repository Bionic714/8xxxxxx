From your description, it looks like you just took the original 16/44.1 files and resampled them to a higher bit depth & sample rate, which does absolutely nothing to change the sound quality and just makes the files bigger. And you even used flac level 0 for some reason, as if you were just trying to make the files as big as possible.

I guess you did something to alter the audio, since you apparently removed the DC offset, which should be totally unnecessary with a professionally produced recording, but OK. Did you do anything else besides resample this a bunch of times for no reason?"
