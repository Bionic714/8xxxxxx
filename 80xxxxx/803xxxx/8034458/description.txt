          Welcome to Nerdvana
          Eleven contestants meet each other and hosts Curtis Armstrong
          and Robert Carradine for the first time, while also exploring
          their new home, Nerdvana. In the first Nerd War, teams are picked
          and friendships and alliances are made. In the Nerd-Off a supersized
          game of strategy will determine which nerd is to be banished
          from Nerdvana forever. 
                            
                                 
                                                  
      
            
                                                     
                                                 
                                                                      

      We know who we are, where we came from, and why we're here. Do you?
