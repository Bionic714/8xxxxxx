Description:

 The password manager with the highest level of security combined with an easy to use interface.
No other password vault offers more possibilites to store your confidential
* login information and credentials (user name, password, clickable logon URL),
* PIN of credit cards, ATM cards or phone locks PINs,
* secret text notes,
* secret contacts (email, phone numbers) and
* secret bookmarks and hyperlinks
in one single application. And no other password manager has more security features, like
* application master PIN or master text password
* data encryption with 256 bit keys based on a combination of SHA-256, AES and Twofish, the most secure hash and encryption algorithms available today's cryptography
* encryption keys are not directly derived from the master password, to prevent brute-force password cracking using cracking hardware (e.g. graphic card clusters), when the phone was lost or stolen
* only one Android permission is necessary for the app: access to SD card for backup / restore (no internet access needed and no ads!)
* backup function for all stored passwords and other confidential data based on ZIP AES 256 encryption (backup can be read on your PC with normal UNZIP software)
* backup can be SEND directly to a safe storage via bluetooth, email or cloud storage
* the backup file is overwritten on the deletion, so that it cannot be restored by recovery tools
* initial data load using the restore function based on CSV import file
* app is locked automatically, when there is was user input for 2 minutes (timeout is configurable)
* "exit" menu on all screens, that stops the app completely
* optional self-destruction function after 7 unsuccessful logon attempts
* user name and password can be copied to the clipboard and are deleted automatically after 30 seconds
* configurable password generator
* on Honeycomb and ICS systems, the application prevents that sensitive data is shown in screenshots for the "recent apps" list
