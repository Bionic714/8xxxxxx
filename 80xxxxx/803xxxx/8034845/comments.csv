,RivalMascot,2013-01-21T22:46Z,"Same.  It just sits for hours & does nothing.  Also, when do you think you will be able to upload the other parts?"
,kidlonewolf,2013-01-22T06:26Z,"Seed good people, been waiting for this one"
,cangri1,2013-01-22T18:25Z,damn whats up with all these leechers and no seeders how hard is it to seed a 61.65mib file come on guys...
,kidlonewolf,2013-01-22T23:37Z,"gibigbig could you please upload again it seems these leechers will never seed, most post upload speed to nothing an only download. or if you could upload it or send it to me personally?"
,gibigbig,2013-02-04T01:53Z,"I will reseed when i have all modules and provide mirror links. Mean time, go work out in your 30 days apart."
,pikafan,2013-02-15T05:50Z,"Just cant wait for the seeded final torrent, I made this account especially to thank you. Really looking forward to it"

,pikafan,2013-03-01T18:51Z,"bro, been over a month... can you please tell us an update on this?"
,gibigbig,2013-03-04T22:53Z,"Will start seeding in a few days, just need to grab everything and organize it. Btw, don't rush the 30 days thing. i failed by skipping ahead. Now she got someone else. You should probably read these before you do anything as well.

,pikafan,2013-03-05T05:25Z,its been over 2 months for me....
,gibigbig,2013-03-05T05:51Z,"Im organizing the zip now. Should be up by 2mrw. But like I said, its prolly for the best things didnt work out. Getting back with your ex sucks anyway."
,pikafan,2013-03-05T11:32Z,"you are kind of right, i thought so too.... but after thinking a lot, going through a lot of stuff... meeting new people, I still feel she is the one.. well atleast i want to make things alright between us.. we had a horrible break up"
,gibigbig,2013-03-05T21:13Z,"Full torrent added. Seeding with my webserver, (might take a few days for it to grab a copy off my utorrent because my upload speed on campus sucks, but once the file is sent the server should seed at atleast 10MB/s)
