[V],esharoth,2013-01-18T09:45Z,"About the system requirements, which I forgot to mention: they're nothing to worry about, but you do need a graphics card with at least Shader Model 3.0. Just a heads up for people with really old PCs.

Also there's some known game issues mentioned in the readme file, be sure to check those out."
,IndigoAK,2013-01-18T11:38Z,Was patiently waiting for this to hit TPD.  Thank you very much!
,PPierce34,2013-01-18T16:33Z,So was I. I got sick of waiting so I asked for it on the forum yesterday and esharoth kindly responded and uploaded it. Thanks again.
,dilinwe,2013-01-18T20:53Z,cannot install on win 7 64x the installation is stucked for hours /:
[V],esharoth,2013-01-18T22:57Z,"I've tested the installer on Windows 7 x64 for over a dozen times. It would be great if you could tell me your system specs, if you have UAC enabled, and if you tried installing the game from a normal or administrator account.

In the meantime, you can extract setup.bin with 7-zip."
,klord2010,2013-01-19T14:51Z,nice game. thanks.
,Divi107,2013-01-19T23:46Z,Thank you so much.
,00sweeney,2013-01-25T04:24Z,"Downloaded fine with Win 7/64. BUT, the first time around Norton zapped it, so I had to exclude the file and then download again. If you're getting hung up, perhaps your anti-virus software is interfering with the installation. It's happened to me before and it wasn't immediately clear to me that Norton was responsible. Just a thought.

Thanks for the up, esharoth."
[V],esharoth,2013-01-25T13:23Z,"That's good advice. And if you're worried about running the executable, upload it to VirusTotal and you'll see that it's clean:

,arn420,2013-02-01T21:31Z,"Thanks for it.
Hey esharoth can you please upload Antichamber.This game will be awesome."
[V],esharoth,2013-02-03T10:22Z,"It's already up on TPB:

,ultrababa,2013-02-12T21:45Z,Thanks a lot man!
,sirms,2013-02-23T02:03Z,Anyone know of or can obtain a mac copy?
[V],esharoth,2013-02-26T13:14Z,"Here is the MAC version:

,apokalypsi,2013-03-08T17:58Z,"Hey, TPB. Need your help. Got the game working, but for some reason, I can't increase the resolution above 600x400. This normally wouldn't be a problem, but the the dialogue text doesn't exactly scale with the size. It's cut. This is weird. http://i.imgur.com/NHrYXgo.png"
,Groovious,2013-03-13T07:32Z,"Looks really rad, thanks."
,flaminga,2013-03-14T12:20Z,How many acts is there so far?
,itsRyanSan,2013-04-07T00:21Z,"Hey esharoth!
You said there is no virus but virustotal.com says it has a trojan!
TrendMicro-HouseCall - TROJ_GEN"
[V],esharoth,2013-04-21T10:03Z,"Look at the date when I posted that: 2013-01-25. Now look at the date of the last analysis on VirusTotal: 2013-04-16. 

So now, in April, one scanner out of 46 used on VirusTotal detects a trojan. And it's Trend Micro's free product HouseCall, but their premium TrendMicro didn't detect anything.

I will go ahead and say that it's a false positive. If you don't agree with that, don't download this torrent. Support the developers by buying the game."
,mycophage,2013-04-28T05:53Z,"The Mac version esharoth linked to appears to contain a Windows .exe file; it's not clear how it's supposed to run on a Mac. 

(esharoth, thanks for posting these games - I asked this question on the Mac torrent's page, but I am repeating my question here because the thread is more active and I thought you'd be more likely to see it.)"
[V],esharoth,2013-05-02T15:05Z,"I have replied to you on the page for the MAC version of the game, it doesn't come with an exe file."
