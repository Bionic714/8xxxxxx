Top 100 REAL Hip-Hop & Rap Songs of 2011

I put this list together to share great Hip-Hop and a lot of slept-on gems with the masses and to emphasize the fact that REAL Hip-Hop is very much alive. If most of these artists and songs are unknown to you, I highly recommend you give it a listen. You won't find many commercial Hip-Hop artists or songs that were on the radio on this list.

I've tried to highlight a number of different projects and artists, but more or less, it's a collection of my favorite Hip-Hop and Rap songs of 2011. There was a tremendous amount of great music, and it was very difficult to narrow this down to 100 songs and near-impossible to order them. I had to leave off songs from a lot of very good projects and albums. I could have easily turned this into a Top 200 list! But I'm happy with it, and I hope you enjoy it. 

The only rule I have when making the list: No more than 4 tracks from a single project. Other than that, it's just the best of the best.

Check my other torrents for soon to come Top 100 lists for 2012, 2010, 2009, 2008 and beyond. One love.
