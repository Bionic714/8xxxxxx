 Description
SpeedView is an advanced speedometer application that uses the phone's built-in GPS system to show your current, maximum and average speed, as well as the direction, total distance, and time traveled. Suitable for running, car driving, biking, or hiking.

ΓÇó High accuracy
GPS-based speedometer that is more accurate than the one in your car.

ΓÇó Linear compass
Shows your current direction of travel. A compass mode is also available.

ΓÇó HUD mode
Mirrors the numbers so you can place your phone on your car's dashboard and see the speed reflected in the front glass. You can check out this video to see how it works:

ΓÇó Speed graph
Displays a graph chart covering the last several minutes.

ΓÇó Speed warning
You can set the speed limits for three different types of roads so that when you go too fast a visual alert or sound will notify you.

ΓÇó Display units
Supports units such as miles, kilometers, and nautical miles.

ΓÇó GPX track export
Enables you to save your current track to the SD card or email it to someone. The GPX format is supported by Google Earth and many other programs: http://www.topografix.com/gpx_resources.asp

ΓÇó Background mode
You can minimize the program and keep it running in the background. It will work as usual and even notify you when you exceed the speed limit.

Please note that the accuracy of GPS measurements is affected by a number of factors including atmospheric conditions, obstructions and the visibility of satellites.
