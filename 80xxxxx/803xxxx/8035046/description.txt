Details

Join inspirational pianist Stan Whitmire for a continuous play set of 20 worshipful solo piano compositions. 

Dove Award-winning pianist, Stan Whitmire, has a list of accomplishments, both diverse and impressive. He brings to each performance a rich musical heritage spanning several generations and covering a variety of musical styles. 

A featured soloist and accompanist on many of the Bill and Gloria Gaither Homecoming video projects, Stan often works with the Gaithers both in the studio and on occasional concert dates. Since the fall of 2003, he has had way too much fun being a part of Mark LowryΓÇÖs solo-concert dates and video shoots. 

Many artists with technical training play mechanically, and many with feeling are limited technicallyΓÇönot Stan, who accomplishes both, accurately covering the entire keyboard, yet still playing with deep emotion. His passionate presentation of varied stylings will lift your spirits and nourish your soul.
