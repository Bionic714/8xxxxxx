I know it's my fourth Fred Anderson review in a couple of months time, but his
80th birthday resulted in some additional releases. So for the completists and
the fans: here is another excellent Fred Anderson album, recorded live on
Nov. 17, 2007 in Pozna┼ä, Poland, at the Made In Chicago festival, and just
released on the Polish label Estrada Pozna┼äska, and we can only thank them for
that. Anderson is accompanied by Harrison Bankhead on bass, and Dushun Mosley
on drums. There are no real surprises, apart from the fact that the album
brings no less than seven tracks, ranging between nine to sixteen minutes long,
so you get a lot of music, played in his typical free bop style full of
rhythmical and lyrical soloing, once in a while interspersed with some slower
spiritual moments. You can not but admire the man. His love of music is truly
contagious. Impossible to listen to this without enjoying it too!
