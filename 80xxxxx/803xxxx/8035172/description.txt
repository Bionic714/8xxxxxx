  I created this because of a few
reasons...
1: I've already bought this documentary
   3 times, so I clearly love it.

2: Because of this, I wasn't buying
   it again!

3: Every time I found a copy on the net,
   it was terrible.

4: You should have a good copy too.


  This is a DVD ISO file, and I'm going
to explain how you use it, as I saw a
comment on one of my other ISO releases
saying "This works great guys, all you
have to do is install VLC, and
right-click on the ISO file, then select
Open".
  Now although that does work, it's not
it's intention, as most others already
know.
  The purpose of an ISO is for burning,
or some times "Mounting", but burning
is the intention of mine.
  An ISO is also known as an "Image",
or "Image File". You should burn this
to DVD using your favourite burning
program. If your NOT a SUCKER, and DON'T
use MS Windows, but do use Ubuntu, or
another form of Linux, just insert a
Blank DVD into your Burner, then
right-click on the ISO file and select
"Write to Disk". Once it's finished, put
it in your DVD Player and follow the
on-screen menu.

  Enjoy, as I know you will.
