,Osiris69,2013-02-26T02:45Z,"Are these 3D movies done in red/blue glasses or the TV 3D glasses on 3D TV's that look like shades?  I have the red/blue glasses, but not the more common, more expensive 3D sunglasses.  Can the 3D sunglasses (brown/black shades) work on normal flatscreen monitors?  Or do we need to have a special monitor in order to get the 3D effects?  I have an NVIDIA GeForce 650TI video card with the 3D ability, but only in red/blue vision and not sure if they can use the brown/black 3D glasses.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks in advance!!"
