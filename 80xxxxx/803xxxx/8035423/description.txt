Cubemen v1.27 for Mac

ItΓÇÖs the age old struggle between Good vs Bad, Blue vs Red, Little men vs Little men. Use your own little Cubemen to defend your base from other little Cubemen that are trying to run it over. ItΓÇÖs the usual story, but with many very interesting twists. 

Play a purely Defense game in various modes on a sweet selection of levels, or go into Skirmish mode and play a new type of TD game against either the computer or another human opponent. 

ThatΓÇÖs right.. Two way REAL-TIME TD against the computer or a real person! 

There are no static towers, just little men! Spawn your little Cubemen with orders to get to a certain location to attack or defend. You can move your Cubemen around the board at any time or click on an enemy to target them. 

Cubemen Multi-Player games are cross platform, so you can play iPad v.s Steam or Steam v.s MAS or MAS v.s iPad... lots of Cubemen Multi-Player goodness!
