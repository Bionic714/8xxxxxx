,MakeeFdo,2013-01-23T17:40Z,"I would say V4 A8.
This was a great movie overall, ton of action and a great plot. Acting was also good and there is nothing i could say against this movie, general public should like it. There is a better copy of this one at film.trendypics.net which worked great for me! I hope for more movies like this one!"
,Nichyego,2013-01-24T22:47Z,"Yay, 5.1 sound... Hold on.
V: Horseshit for 2.75 GB = 5/10 (304 pixels)
A: Acceptable = 7/10

It's very early to expect good HD rips, and it's absolutely watchable, so thanks anyway."
