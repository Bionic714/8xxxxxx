,mwisher,2013-01-18T22:43Z,Excellent. Many thanks.
,pythonista99,2013-01-19T06:45Z,For Chrissake - 12 MB and NO seeders.  Can you get the damn thing going pleeeeez !
,Fan_of_Claudia_z,2013-01-19T10:06Z,"Yes, it would be nice. As I type, about 100 peers, all with zero percent downloaded/seeding.

Oh, only a few of these books are WW2 related."
,mwisher,2013-01-19T13:24Z,Almost no one is seeding back. Come on folks don't be greedy. If everyone did that no one would have a complete file.
,raindr0ps,2013-01-20T02:44Z,"No seeders. 540 leechers, Zero percent from 53 peers. I really don't believe anyone has ever gotten a bit or byte from this torrent."
,Fan_of_Claudia_z,2013-01-20T22:51Z,"I've been trying to grab this for 3 days now. Not one byte has been received.

Why do people upload torrents then promptly log off? What's the point except to perhaps annoy people?"
,marcolou16,2013-02-14T04:34Z,Too bad not working !
