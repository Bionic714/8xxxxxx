Please don't change file names, as it would prevent sharing, sorry for not naming them correctly."

Could you also upload Season 3 in 720p? English subs for the first two episodes are now available and the rest, hopefully, are on their way"
,eluent,2013-05-01T11:19Z,"Yes season 3 has just happened. But not here.
This was just the HD of the second season that was aired by arte and that was later than the original airing. So unless some good HD of season 3 surfaces, I'll encode and share it when it will be aired here, and I don't know when that will be."
,eluent,2013-05-01T17:01Z,"Actually season 3 can be found on HD and it is  in a very fine quality, tough I've only be able to find it on cyberlockers, so I won't encode or release it."
