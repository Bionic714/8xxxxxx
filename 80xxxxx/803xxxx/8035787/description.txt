From Hollywood Reporter:

In the 106th issue, Dwight's back story unfolds as Negan continues to ponder what to do with Carl.

Turns out The Saviors have a code of their own.

In last month's The Walking Dead No. 105, Negan reveals that his community of "Saviors" lives by a system of twisted rules that includes points and multiple wives -- and a brutal torture for their betrayal that explains just what happened to Dwight's face.

In this month's 106th issue of the Robert Kirkman comic, the owner of the spiked bat that was used to brutally kill Glenn continues to ponder Carl's punishment for gunning down multiple members of his team after Rick's son witnesses his iron form of justice. The comic marks Charlie Adlard's 100th consecutive issue.

AMC's The Walking Dead, which was renewed for a fourth season without showrunner Glen Mazzara, returns Feb. 10.

This might be the first time I've ever posted a 2nd version of the same comic, but these Minutemen releases 1) are both different resolutions from the Empire release and 2) include the alternate cover (see picture) celebrating Charlie Adlard's 100th issue drawing The Walking Dead.  --STFmaryville
