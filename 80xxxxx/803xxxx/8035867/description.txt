Die Hard 4.0.: The True Story
The True Story looks at the real lives and true stories behind Hollywood blockbusters and this episode examines the real life inspiration behind Bruce Willis adventure thriller Die Hard 4.0. The much anticipated fourth instalment of the Die Hard franchise sees a slightly aged - but just as capable New York Cop John McClane (Willis) take on the sophisticated cyber-criminal mastermind Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant). Gabriel holds the United States to ransom as he wreaks havoc by shutting down the country remotely via the internet and only McClane can stop him.
The True Story examines how likely large scale cyber terrorism actually is and what steps are being taken to stop it. In Die Hard 4.0 the cyber-attack is codenamed 'Fire Sale' - a term now actually being used among hacker communities. Are we really living in a world where a teenager can infiltrate and shut down an airport from their bedroom? Or where criminal gangs can rob a nation-wide chain of banks with the click of a mouse?
