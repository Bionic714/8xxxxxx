  The film is based on the life and times of a   
  superstar heroine from the dream factory we cal
 'Bollywood'. The film is a daring, shocking     
  glamorous, scandalous behind the scenes        
  account of the reality behind the world of     
  glitz and glamour that our film stars inhabit. 
  For a country obsessed with films and film     
  stars,  Heroine will take audiences on a       
  voyeuristic journey to see what really goes on 
  behind the closed doors of make up rooms       
  and vanity vans. It will give them a chance to 
  go beyond the gorgeous smiles and politically  
  correctquotes, to see what really happens in   
  the lives of India's sweethearts. The bitching 
  and the politics, the secrets and the lies, the
  incredible highs of fame and the lonely        
  depths of failure.
