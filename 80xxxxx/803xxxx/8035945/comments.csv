[T],JinRohEX,2013-02-21T19:16Z,"Sorry for the confusion. The program does not require a serial key for installation or normal working but you need one to activate it and make the unregistered bar go.
I repeat you can use it normally even without activation. If it bothers you try LibreOffice:
http://www.libreoffice.org/
It is free and feature packed enough to satisfy an average user like me. "
,orion8_2012,2013-02-22T18:07Z,Does it still work after 30 or 60-day (trial period)?
[T],JinRohEX,2013-02-27T21:40Z,Yes keeps on working fine even without activation.
,orion8_2012,2013-03-04T21:36Z,You don't happen to have the x64 version?  Thanks.
