MICROSOFT OFFICE PROFESSIONAL PLUS 2010 32-bit SUITE contains:

Microsoft Access
Microsoft Excel
Microsoft SharePoint Workspace
Microsoft OneNote
Microsoft Outlook
Microsoft PowerPoint
Microsoft Publisher
Microsoft Word
Microsoft InfoPath

INSTALLATION:
Run setup.exe

This is not a trial version and works without activation (how it does admittedly beats me). I have personally tried it on two computers with Windows 7 Ultimate SP1
and had a few friends try it as well and there were no issues as such. Although I have not tried the SharePoint feature or tried to update it.

Hopefully it will work for you as well.
