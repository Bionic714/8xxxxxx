Is the Collins' bloodline is cursed? For those who know the truth about their history, that answer would most likely be a resounding yes. However, could something even more insidious be occurring? Is their bloodline being tainted in an effort to produce the ultimate evil? Collinwood has been home to the supernatural, but has it ever seen true evil like this?
