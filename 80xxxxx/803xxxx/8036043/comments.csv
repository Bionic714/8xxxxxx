[T],analogreflections,2013-01-18T21:23Z,"It may not be blu ray as a source, cause it's from digital TV station (HD, 720p) and how do you think TV stations get this high quality? They get it from either tapes or bluray disc.
No it's not web dl, don't be a troll, as i see this is only hi-res version of this flick on tpb, so instead of complaining, download it, enjoy and don't forget to seed  ;)"
,phase700b,2013-01-19T02:46Z,No problem. It's just that when the description says BRrip that's what people expect.
,TheLathe,2013-01-19T09:22Z,"Well, I think it's pretty dang bitch'n to be able to have this!  Thank you mate for taking the time to capture this HD broadcast  : )

The other fellow really shouldn't complain; I just watched a 1942 film posted here that was an HD web rip called 'THE CAT PEOPLE' and it looked frigg'n STUNNING!"
,.Leto.,2013-01-19T12:14Z,"""It's just that when the description says BRrip that's what people expect.""
Exactly. Don't try to fool people by pretending this is a blu-ray rip when it's actually a HDTV rip."
[T],analogreflections,2013-01-19T15:16Z,"Well, I just assumed that source that TV used was blu ray, it wasn't my intention to FOOL anyone.. what difference does it make to me? I just want to share something with people over the world for free, my intentions are all positive, and believe me fooling someone isn't between them."
,TheLathe,2013-02-01T22:31Z,"Thanks kindly!!!

I didn't think at all that you were trying to 'fool' us  :)

One thing though and it's REALLY odd.  What I do is I burn the downloads here and play them on my OPPO for best quality, and usually after checking the stats in MEDIA INFO and making sure the level on encoding isn't too high or there are Stripped Headers or anything that I need to fix, they usually play just fine.

However, for some odd reason your encode here totally locked up my OPPO and wouldn't play.  Weird...  I checked the detailed stats and I cannot see WHY the hell it's doing that.  You haven't used high reference frames and the level you used I think is 3.1 which should be fine.

Do you know why this is happening.  I tried to re-render in MKVMerge (you had used handbrake I think) but that didn't help.

Any suggestions...?

Thanks mate!!!"
[T],analogreflections,2013-02-02T21:10Z,"If you don't solve it using method phase700b provided on the other torrent page, I strongly suggest you connect your PC with your television set, I'm doing that for couple of years now and I'd never go back to dvd or bluray player."
,TheLathe,2013-02-03T03:10Z,"@OP

Oh, I know mate!  I've had my PC connected to my 50"" Plasma for about 11 years now  : )  Believe me, I've got it all wired for that way, BUT, I do like to keep the films in disc format if I like them.  And, my OPPO player honestly is one of the very best in quality, so I wanna take advantage of the higher quality processors, etc. in it.

Otherwise, if I was just watching the films and didn't care as much about either keeping them or squeezing out all the PQ I can, what you say is very much ideal.

BTW, I REALLY appreciate your posting this TOTALLY BITCH'N older classic films, especially ones like 'THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN'!!!  And especially the HD rips from broadcasts; is is frigg'n AWESOME to be able to have nice HD prints of these more obscure films!!!

Thanks so much!!!"
[T],analogreflections,2013-02-04T00:24Z,"I will try to get more of classics in future. As you can see, lately I'm focused on older movies, ones you can't easily find in HD. My only dilemma is whether to make them smaller in size or try to get best picture possible, because I've noticed larger files mostly have less seeders/leechers. Maybe making of two versions would be the solution where one is light (up to 2gb) and other is max quality which I can get."
,TheLathe,2013-02-05T08:09Z,"Oh YES please keep the quality, by all means.  Both of these movies, this one and 'THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN' easily fit on a single DVD and on this site that is considered small.

There are MANY people here who REALLY appreciate the best quality available.  And, we are not talking Blu-ray size or 14 Gigs or anything, which there are many like that.  I just downloaded BOZX's full Blu-ray of 'SKYFALL' 45 frigg'n Gigs! :)

If you can get the most quality like you have with these two (they look totally BITCH'N, BTW!!!) and keep the file  sizes under 4.35 Gigs, believe me, that will be GREAT!!!  I don't care if there even bigger, but that apparently is good enough...

Please don't pay attention to some of the little grunts around here who download the really small files, trust me, THEY won't be the ones interested in these older CLASSIC films.  Of course, if you WANT to make an additional smaller post then of course by all means do so, but most here will appreciate the better quality for sure!

Thanks!!!"
