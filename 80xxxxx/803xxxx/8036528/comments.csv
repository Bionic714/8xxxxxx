,7117,2013-01-18T18:32Z,..is it dubbed english or  original unintelligible indian english ??
,NCmom99,2013-01-18T20:01Z,"Thanks for all the downloads, they are great.  I try and always use yours, they all seem to be really good downloads.  
Could you please see about the movie ""Promised Land""  it came out at the theater on Dec. 28th I think.  I really would like to get that.  And my son is requesting ""The Haunted House"" that came out the 11th of Jan. If you get them, send me an email... christy.williams98@gmail.com    thanks"
,ouldscratch,2013-01-18T20:14Z,"@7117 I believe it's tolerant English, so I doubt you'll understand!"
,7117,2013-01-18T20:48Z,"..yes this is like i  thinkin, terrible hindi-english accent, totally not understandble speech, needs subtitles, but anyway V is okay 9"
,Ponsh,2013-01-18T21:29Z,"@7117 

What a numskull. You need subtitles or a dubbed version of life of pi?

My godness, some of you effing Americans seem to only comprehend that nauseating red-neck accent.

Travel the world a little, socialise with international students, watch/listen to some of the fantastic non-English films/music out there.

Life does exist outside the Americas. In fact, life and culture outside this region pre-dates the Americas pretty much everywhere."
[V],steevo-be-thy-name,2013-01-18T21:58Z,"@ 7117  The ironic thing is that your written English is terrible , so if you speak like you write you would be unintelligible yourself . "
,chenzhen,2013-01-18T22:08Z,"Ponsh your right!!! People need to open there mind and smell the effing coffee....
In some years the Americans gonna make there own version of Life of Pi,like they did with so many great movies cause the yankees don't watch films in other languages,please!!!They are missing out so many great films,music,etc"
,pottermouth,2013-01-18T22:08Z,"well i can understand the english perfectly well,maybe a few drops of earex would help!!!

And as far as subs go...I haven't watched the movie yet, just checked out the quality. I don't know if there are any parts in Hindi, but since this is an academy screener sent to academy voters in America, I'm assuming that any foreign speaking parts will have subs hardcoded, just like the few foreign language parts in django. thanks"
,mpenn20,2013-01-19T04:36Z,@michaelrwatson - hardcoded subs should be there for foreign parts. some idiots earlier were asking if there were english subs for every word spoken because they can't understand an indian accent.

[V],LeonardTSpock,2013-01-19T08:24Z,"What's with the scene4all hate club down voting? Could somebody explain this to me? Because honestly, down votes should only be given if the upload is being represented as something it isn't. Like, if it's bad quality, a fake, badly cropped, out of sync, a cam when it says SCR, etc. Down votes because you don't like someone's uploads are misleading and unnecessary."
,sorasbestfriend,2013-01-19T09:10Z,"@chenzhen - I agree with you, just like they do with every other non-american movie. Take for example the girl with the dragon tattoo...you want to know why they re-made the original Swedish movie? Because Americans apparently can't read subtitles, and everything has to be in English for them to enjoy! And please don't come here and say ''..b-b-but muh high budget movies!'' if you compare the girl with the dragon tattoo with the Swedish movie män som hatar kvinnor, you'll realize it's essentially the same movie with nothing extra added, the only difference is the language."
,DrSedeuss,2013-01-19T09:21Z,"@sorasbestfriend It's pointless to blame an entire country because some mongoloids on The Pirate Bay need their hearing checked.
As for Fincher's Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, it was remade because it could be made better, and it was. Rooney Mara does it better than Noomi Rapace. Plain and simple.

Now, this movie? Absolutely incredible. Possibly the best of 2012. I was absolutely floored."
,mpenn20,2013-01-19T09:33Z,"@sorasbestfriend - definitely agree with how lazy SOME Americans are..can't say the same about myself. I remember looking for versions of the original girl with the dragon tattoo and seeing all kinds of copies that were dubbed english instead of having english subs. Really infuriated me. I love foreign movies, and dubbing really takes so much away from the films. However I did like the American version too because I also thought Rooney Mara was awesome."
,joeyy17,2013-01-19T10:54Z,"Finally, a movie with a solid story and has meaning. Really makes you think. Torrent is 10/10. You dont need the best quality in the world to understand an imaginative movie like this."

,dredre27,2013-01-24T06:42Z,"Thank you. This movie did not reach my little ag town--not enough swearing and nudity or senseless crude humor for our area's mass of mostly uneducated lamers.

The movie is a STORY. One of those old fashioned mostly extinct thingies with actual dialog and a plot. So if all you want is non-stop explosions and no real dialog, skip this movie. Otherwise grab it. 

Oh. There's a big attempt at promoting religious interfaith. So if you are diehard zealot of one faith or another you might find this offensive. Aside from that it is a good movie. It is worth the watch, as far as wasting portions of your life on your butt in front of a screen goes. Lots of special effects too for all you tech lovers.
