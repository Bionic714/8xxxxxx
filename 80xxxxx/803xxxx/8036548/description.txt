Your Baby Can Read

Format:MP4 720 x 404

This is the newer version of Your Baby Can Read.
I had the previous version that began each volume with a girl saying, "Hi my name is Aleka".

This is the new version (2010). Each session begins with a boy saying, "Hi my name is Graham."

This set includes 4 DVDs. Each more advanced than the previous one. (Go in order...)


This program is awesome. My son has learned so many words from them, he really enjoys them and is saying / reading so many more words than anyone else we know his age.

I do recommend getting the program, we have used the flash cards a lot and my son loves those as well. They really compliment the dvds. But these dvds are a great start, and once you see how much your child starts learning and doing from them, you might want to consider getting the flash cards, which is when you will see them really learning on how to read instead of just speaking.

Enjoy!
