,misaoni,2013-01-20T13:17Z,"this is real pilot episode. thank you for the torrent! the first part is similar to the first episode of BBT so it may seem fake, but the middle etc is all different. cheers"
,sora4fse,2013-01-20T23:37Z,"thanks 4 the up load dude, really digged the girl in the pilot way better then the current one there using now, for some odd reason she seemed to fit better."
,-G-rad,2013-01-21T11:26Z,I definitely never saw this one. It's a pilot with first cast. There are differences in story too. And I like the new girl better.
,papuanewguineapunkjr,2013-01-22T02:19Z,Cool! It is what it says it is. It even has the official production company stamp at the beginning. My family thanks you.
,area4689,2013-01-24T06:11Z,"i'm surprised most of you guys like this better than how it is now. not for nothing, but i'm actually glad the show is what it is now. i wasn't digging the fact that lenard and sheldon are ""close"" friends, although obviously they're friends now but still maintain their differences which i personally think its what makes them who they are. second, i don't like the fact that sheldon has, i believe, very open personality, compared to his personality right now. last but not least, their nerdy girlfriend (NO PUN) is a turn off, its just me, personally, i just felt like that particular character is too much. overall, im happy to the characters the way they are now, that being said, it is interesting to see how this show began, and without that insight, the show wouldn't be how it is today! thank you uploader!"
,cancab,2013-01-25T18:49Z,"Interesting pilot
doesn't at all compare to actual show
worth checking out though if your a fan of the show
not the best quality...audio seems to be a little out sync.....but watchable"
