The Big Bang Theory's Unaired Pilot, refers to the original pilot made for the 2006-2007 season that was not picked up by the network, thus it was never aired. Only Johnny Galecki and Jim Parsons were in the cast, and the female lead, Katie, was envisioned as "a street-hardened, tough-as-nails woman with a vulnerable interior". Katie was played by actress Amanda Walsh . They also had a female friend called Gilda (played by Iris Bahr ). The show's original theme music was also different, using Thomas Dolby's hit "She Blinded me with Science"
