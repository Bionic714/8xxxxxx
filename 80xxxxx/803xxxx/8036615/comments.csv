,PiratePinoy,2013-01-22T09:11Z,Recyclebin32? is this different from Shred Guitar In 6 Weeks with Andy James?
,RecycleBin32,2013-01-22T12:25Z,"Yes actually.
Shred Guitar in 6 Weeks is a 6 DVD series.
Full Shred Ahead is an even more in-depth look into the techniques, it is Andy James' Web column for lick library. This comes in no DVD, just the site.
Cheers! :)"
