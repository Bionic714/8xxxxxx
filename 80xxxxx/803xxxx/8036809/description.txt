"I'm Sorry For You, My Friend"

Rayna and Juliette get ready to perform in San 
Diego in their first arena concert on the same 
bill. Rayna finds that working without Deacon 
is too disruptive and makes an interesting 
proposal to Liam, while Juliette sends Sean a 
message through the press. Gunnar takes a road 
trip to Austin to visit his brother, and 
Scarlett tags along for the ride so she can 
catch Deacon's performance in Texas with the 
Revel Kings. Meanwhile Avery makes his move to 
sign with Dominic, and Teddy and Coleman's 
campaigns find them in a dead heat.

Evolve... or die.

Enjoy :)
