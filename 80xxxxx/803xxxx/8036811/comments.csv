http://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/4763047/life-of-pi-en

clik on the link under the pictures. you'll have a "".srt file"". when playing with VLC (or other player), click video-subtitles-open file-choose that srt file, and youre done! 
as for the audio, you can also fix the lag if theres any."

,hiotis21,2013-01-19T23:17Z,i hope this movie to be good
,MMusic123,2013-01-20T00:07Z,"a040674.. good instructions on subtitle finds & sync from box_77, but one thing he didn't mention is most subtitles download as  zipped files, so you will need to extract them first- then you should have a .srt (subtitle file type) that can be  opened from VLC player (or other type).  You have to have the opened/extracted .srt file to sync as a subtitle.  (at least for me  they are always zipped files)"

You will see no more imaginative film this year than Life of Pi, whose conceit of a young Indian boy stranded with a Bengal Tiger in a lifeboat amid the Pacific Ocean is fantastical yet real in its metaphoric implications. Quality sucked but you can find a HD one at lifeofpi.blackpathway.com which worked great for me. While the framing device of a story told to a stranger uses the old flashback, the lonely lifeboat is as new as any story told in the last century."
