,msteright,2013-05-29T01:26Z,"I have an important question:
when you make a usb bootable hirens disk. sometimes when you put it into a computer, and you boot normally to windows to use the windows tools on the hirens disk, the antivirus will delete and quarantene files in my usb stick that makes hirens not work right. I have made a cd so that i have a perfect copy, but i was wondering how i could make it to where nothing can delete or move files in my hirens usb stick."
