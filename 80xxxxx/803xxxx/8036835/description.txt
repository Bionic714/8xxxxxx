"Pilot"

Recently, life hasn't been smooth sailing for 
16-year-old Carrie Bradshaw - her mother just 
passed away, her rebellious younger sister Dorritt 
is acting out, and their father Tom is struggling 
to raise two teenage daughters alone. As Carrie 
begins the first day of her junior year, she can't 
help but feel as though all eyes are on her, and a 
pity party from rival Donna LaDonna doesn't help 
the situation. Even when surrounded by her group 
of friends, Mouse, Maggie and Walt, Carrie feels 
as though her life should be heading in a 
different direction. The arrival of new guy 
Sebastian Kydd brings Carrie some excitement, but 
it isn't until she accepts an internship at a 
Manhattan law firm that things begin to fall into 
place. In the city, Carrie meets Larissa Loughlin, 
a free-spirited, outgoing style editor at 
Interview magazine, who introduces her to a world 
she's only dreamt of.
