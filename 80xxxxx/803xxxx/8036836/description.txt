"Hustle 'N' Bros"

Cleveland is furious when Donnas ex-husband, 
Robert, crashes Freight Trains birthday party and 
upstages Clevelands gift for his dad. To make 
matters worse, Freight Train officially adopts 
Robert, and Cleveland must learn to get along with 
his new brother. Meanwhile, to pay off a bet they 
owe to Donna, Rallo and Junior become dog bounty 
hunters, tracking down lost pooches, returning 
them to their owners and collecting the rewards.
