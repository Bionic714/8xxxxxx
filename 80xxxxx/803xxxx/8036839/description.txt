"One Kid at a Time"

Feeling guilty over not being able to 
spend enough quality time with each of 
their kids, Frankie and Mike decide to 
dedicate each day of a three-day weekend 
to one of their offspring. Unexpected 
revelations emerge when Axl takes them to 
a paintball range, Sue talks them into an 
exhausting itinerary consisting of 17 
separate activities, and Brick tries to 
bring them to a "Planet Nowhere" sci-fi 
book convention. 

18/Slower
Evolve... or die.

Enjoy :)
