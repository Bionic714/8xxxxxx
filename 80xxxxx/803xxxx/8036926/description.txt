Archer (2009) - Season 4 - Episode 1 (WEB-DL - 1080p)
-----------------------------------------------------

The half-hour, animated comedy that revolves around the International
Secret Intelligence Service (ISIS) and the lives of its employees
continues with Season 4. Although their work of espionage, reconnaissance
missions, wiretapping and undercover surveillance is daunting and dangerous,
every covert operation and global crisis is actually just another excuse for
the ISIS staff to undermine, sabotage and betray each other for personal gain.
