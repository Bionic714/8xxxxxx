,garlor,2013-01-20T19:14Z,"same, your serial number is incorrect. please reinstall chrome"
,PseudoPositive,2013-01-21T08:07Z,"I see this is extract & Play, is there a registry value  included with this?, you do need one for this game; if not export any reg file and right click then go to edit, then wipe all the data off, then copy & paste this:

Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWARETechland]

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWARETechlandChrome]
""SerialNumber""=""XTITY-92Y9L-MGPVA-KJ4Z6""
""DestinationDir""=""C:\Program Files\Gathering\Chrome\""

Now you have to fill in the missing backslashes TPB takes out, so make it look like this:

Note: change the DIR line to suit the games DIR, you will remove the word Gathering unless that's the name of the folder that the game is in. Make sure you enter the new reg value. Hope it helps."
