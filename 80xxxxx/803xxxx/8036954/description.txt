i-Studio 6

i-Studio 6 is a fantastic music and video converter, letting you use the power and flexibility of iTunes to get your own media onto your iPhone and iPod Touch. With i-Studio 6, you can convert DVD video or video files in a variety of popular file formats, along with audio CDs and other audio platform files, into AAC, MP3, and MP4 formats that are compatible with your Apple device. File transfer from the program into your iPod or iPhone is accomplished using iTunes, so you never have to leave that familiar interface just to enjoy your own material.

You also don't need to be a technical wizard to enjoy the benefits of i-Studio 6. The program automatically selects settings to acheive optimal audio and video quality. And if you're short on material to import to your Apple device, just use i-Studio 6 to search for and download clips from YouTube and 11 other content portals!

Fortunately, Apple's best sellers not only support the iTunes protected AAC/M4P in the form of DRM-protected audio- or video files; they can also handle unprotected M4A-, M4V- or self-created MP4-videos. These are the best prerequisites for counting on the store of own collections instead of commercial providers and for creating the desired contents yourself - using the right program.

*i-Studio is not able to convert DVD-videos or other videos or audio-CDs that are equipped with an effective copy protection. Annoying, but it was not our idea and we cannot change it.
