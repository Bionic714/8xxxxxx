The overwhelming majority of people who practice internal martial art forms do it to be healthy. They donΓÇÖt do it for martial power. However, if you practice for martial power, health comes as a bonus. Everything you do becomes dramatically stronger.

The system of Hsing-i is based upon storing an immense amount of chi in the lower tantien, and then allowing it to spread throughout the body to be used at will. In China it is known as one of the most direct ways to make your body strong and healthy.
