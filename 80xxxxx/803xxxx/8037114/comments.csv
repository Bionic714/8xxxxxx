,guidoanselmi,2013-01-21T04:43Z,"The second side of ""Gandharva"" has made countless trips to my turntables and CD players over the 40 or so years. There's something there quite unlike any other music I know there - an aura or sorts. Those Grace Cathedral recordings were meant to be a showcase for quad sound, though I don't believe it was ever released to the public in that way. I recall a film was made about the recording session, but it too seems to have disappeared in the Warner vaults. As good as the stereo version is, I've often wonder sound multichannel sound captured the ""space"" of the cathedral. "
