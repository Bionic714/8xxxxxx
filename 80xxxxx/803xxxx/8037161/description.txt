For the five members of Black PrairieΓÇöall of whom come from well-established acts such as the Decemberists and DoloreanΓÇöthe band is an experimental melting pot. Letting loose its weird curiosities, the Portland group explores the possibilities of standard acoustic instruments while also utilizing some that are less common, like the dobro, bazouki and archtop guitar.

Although signed to the traditional bluegrass label Sugar Hill Records, Black Prairie isnΓÇÖt really a bluegrass band. With influences ranging from Eastern European folk to rootsy Americana, and with half an albumΓÇÖs worth of instrumental tracks, the groupΓÇÖs second record, A Tear in the Eye Is a Wound in the Heart, ebbs and flows like a film score. 

Instrumental tracks such as ΓÇ£Evil LeavesΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£34 Wishes: The Legend OfΓÇ¥ show songwriters capable of compelling, near-classical arrangements. Other songs, like ΓÇ£Rock of AgesΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£What You Gave,ΓÇ¥ center on singer-violinist Annalisa TornfeltΓÇÖs countrified vocals, blending Alison KraussΓÇÖ sweetness with Patty GriffinΓÇÖs earnestness. The two styles, however, often feel disconnected from song to song. ItΓÇÖs difficult not to imagine what these musicians could do within a more cohesive narrative.

In the moments when the compositional artistry complements the vocals, the bandΓÇÖs possibilities feel endless. The seductive ΓÇ£How Do You Ruin Me?,ΓÇ¥ one of the albumΓÇÖs darker tracks, places TornfeltΓÇÖs simple, echoing vocals against flurries of accordion, percussion, bass and violin, which weave in and out of focus.


While thereΓÇÖs no denying that, separately, all its parts are strong, the bandΓÇÖs sprawling creativity could use a filter. But then, that might defeat the purpose of Black PrairieΓÇÖs existence.
