Sliders-2 Workshop: Reclaiming the Vessel ΓÇô Preparing the Body for Slide - Filmed Live Virginia Beach, VA September Sept. 19-21, 2008

This unique and wonderful workshop saw the culmination of a series of techniques that spanned 70 pages! As a reflection of the ΓÇÿtask at handΓÇÖ in getting the physical body ready to slide, these techniques included physical body sounds, movements and rhythms (Phase-Toning), in addition to the usual see/feel visualization kind of techniques. These new and exciting technologies will begin enabling us to shift our 3D conscious state into a more expanded conscious state. To prepare us for this shift, this workshop covers information on our very own embodied Kara-nAΓÇÖdis Seal, the Aah-JhAΓÇÖ Hydro-Acoustic Body, the D-2 Control GrUΓÇÖ-al (ΓÇÿGrailΓÇÖ) Window, the Dimensional Penta-gΓÇÖel circulations (within the D-1 Jhandas, the D-2 GrUΓÇÖ-al, the D-3 TEΓÇÖa-Wha and D-4 Jha-Dha windows) and the ΓÇÿI AMΓÇÖ bands of consciousness.

These amazing Sliders-2 techniques will assist us in opening the communication between the D1, D2, D3 and Density-1 ΓÇÿI AMΓÇÖ levels of consciousness, allowing our ΓÇÿI AMΓÇÖ levels to communicate with each other and also allowing us to more fully reunite with our own embodied natural GhaRE Spirit. To assist us in this process, this workshop includes a ΓÇÿDaily GrailΓÇÖ technique program with instructions on how to clear our food of both the unnatural GharocheΓÇÖ and natural GharEΓÇÖ and how to re-enliven it. It also includes the wonderful new phase-toning techniques that teach us to listen to The Voice of our own embodied Spirit, GhaREΓÇÖ, so we can gradually become The Voice of our embodied Spirit.

This program also includes important information on foot baths, dietary changes and exercise ΓÇª how much, how often, what sort and mostly importantly, why. There is also more information on the amazing 12 Steps of Materialization (plasm, protoplasm, vapors, metallic electroplasma, hydroplasma, thermoplasma, ectoplasma - includes celestallon, celestalline and celestallite ΓÇô and finally endoplasma water-matter) and the fascinating manifestation and materialization process that takes place in the RaSha Body, Light Body (in the etheric duct system), Spirit Body and Aah-JhA Body. Finally, join Team Indigo for the exhilarating Wave of Sacred Psonns (including several beautiful new songs) for the International Day of Peace-Fall Equinox and bringing in the Host of Al-benΓÇÖ-yhan.
