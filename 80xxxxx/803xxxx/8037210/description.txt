Hard Disk Sentinel Pro

Hard Disk Sentinel is a hdd monitoring tool that will help you find possible hard disk problems, performance degradations and failures. It can alert if a problem detected or if temperature is too high and it has other reporting options. As hard disk sizes are constantly increasing, data stored on them are more and more valuable for the user of the computer (and this is especially true for a company or office). Serious problems can occur upon a hard disk failure.
