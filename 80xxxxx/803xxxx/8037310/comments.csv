Would it be possible to get the handbooks for Sliders 5 and 11 as well? I only ask because it seems that sliders 5 and 11 have certain stardust alignment information."
,GoAaT999,2013-01-21T00:27Z,"Hi, 369369369 :-) You're most welcome! I definitely plan to make and upload torrents for the rest of the Sliders series (which, of course, will include 11). I'm still working on converting the dvds, etc. but wanted to get some of the ""new stuff"" seeding, so by the time another batch is ready, there will be more seeders of the previous, hopefully! As for the handbooks--that's an interesting idea. I'm not sure I have the tools for that, but I can experiment and see, at least. ;-) I don't have ""Elements of Discovery"". I've seen a couple of ""Kathara Team Modules"" and I prefer Ashayana/E'Asha's presentations to those (the former seem kind of ""second rate""--no offense intended). Thanks!"
