Po, the Dragon Warrior panda, leads the Furious Five in maintaining calm in
the Valley Of Peace. With Tigress, Monkey, Mantis, Crane, Viper and Shifu
fighting by his side, Po defends the Jade Palace against all intruders,
""skadooshing"" the bad guys with his trademark panda moves, and leaving
plenty of time for dumplings.

Po and Mantis visit the equivalent of an ancient Chinese
Comic-Con, where Po's fanboy enthusiasm gets out of hand.
