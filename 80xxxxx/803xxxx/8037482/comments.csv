Ah well, enjoy the crap out of it."
,ShadowWolf87,2013-01-19T03:55Z,"Should also mention that for whatever reason, not all of volume 2 is in this torrent. Yay.

But you can find the rest (as well as some things I DIDN'T have) here:

[V],STFmaryville,2013-01-19T05:34Z,"ShadowWolf87, thanks for linking to my recent torrent. Love your torrents! 

You have Disassembled and Secret War in this, which I probably should have added when I collected mine. I kinda-sorta think they bridge the gap between Avengers vol. 3 and New Avengers vol. 1 ... anyway, keep up the good work my friend."
,Keeper21,2013-01-19T15:36Z,"Thank a lot man!

Will you continue with the other Avengers titles(Mighty,dark,new reboot)like the spiderman chronology or is it just this torrent?

Thanks a lot once again!"
,SPACEHERO55,2013-02-03T01:36Z,Hey this is so great. Thank you so much. I'd like to make a request if possible. Is there any chance you have Avengers vol 3 and vol 4 complete? I'd really appritiate it...Thanks.
