And here is another euro goodie, even if you dont like travel books, Guy Delisles 3 travelogues are worth a read.


Outstanding among the works of the comic author and artist Guy Delisle is his Asian trilogy:
Shenzen (Lassociation, 2000), Pyongyang (Lassociation, 2003) and Chroniques birmanes (Delcourt, 2007). These three albums, comprising 584 plates, grew out of time Delisle spent in Southern China, North Korea and Myanmar.

The narrator of each volume is Delisles alter ego. But this isnt any adventurous Tintin, Delisles anti hero is quite normal, not a daredevil but sort of a nice guy without obvious vices and with an expanding waistline. The drawings are in the same spirit, neither spectacular nor eccentric but sober, unfussy and direct. Guy Delisles work is characterized by an endearing modesty.
