For those of you that are Ti/Po (Tigress/Po) fanatics, you'll love this episode. Wait for the moment at the beginning of the episode for Tigress to arch her butt against Po's crotch inadvertently. "

Seriously though, thank you for your steady stream of encodes, loadstone, and your conviction to keep providing good sourced, standard sized xvid/mp3 rips nowadays too - it is very much appreciated by folks hoping to compile backwards compatible avi collections for some of these shows (like TCats2011, TMNT2012, Robot Chicken, TRON Legacy, etc.).

PS: I noticed you gave the 2 most recent Robot Chicken episodes a miss; will you be revisiting 'em at some point later or should we not be expecting any RC 06x14/06x15 release from you? TIA and keep up the good work."
