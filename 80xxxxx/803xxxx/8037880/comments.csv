,The_Abee,2013-01-19T16:33Z,Ah! that's what I was waiting since past month. Great print. even greater than S4A's. (In size as well) LOL
,brbear,2013-01-27T18:30Z,"This encoding is flawed.

For some reason, the last third of the film (say around the 1:20 mark is jittery, choppy and hard to watch.  It's bareable, but just.

At first I thought it was intentional, given the scene -- but it continues until the end of the film, in scenes that don't warrant it, and appears to be worse in scenes with a lot of detail and motion.

You will see no more imaginative film this year than Life of Pi, whose conceit of a young Indian boy stranded with a Bengal Tiger in a lifeboat amid the Pacific Ocean is fantastical yet real in its metaphoric implications. Quality sucked but you can find a HD one at lifeofpi.blackpathway.com which worked great for me. While the framing device of a story told to a stranger uses the old flashback, the lonely lifeboat is as new as any story told in the last century."
