FYI - this does not work with AppleTV 1G. I didn't think it would but I thought I would check."
,cchamber,2013-01-19T03:10Z,"I could not get the app activated. I was using the Keygen but I was probably doing something wrong. Any suggestions?

,blegi,2013-01-19T13:23Z,"Hi
discovered same problem like cchamber"
,PinkestFloyd,2013-01-19T18:20Z,Activation fails on this. Junk torrent. I ended up just buying the app though because it kicks ass!
,techpoint,2013-01-19T19:03Z,"You guys are too retarded to understand what patching means. Hit PATCH in the keygen on Beamer application BEFORE opening it, then open BEAMER and type in the user / serial. 

This torrent and crack works PERFECTLY. If youre too retarded to figure this out then please leave piratebay."
,aa-tkd,2013-01-19T19:16Z,"This one is working fine on my computer this is how i did:

1, once you have downloadet start the crack generateor and change name and generate the code.
2, press patch and find your beamer software on the computer.
3, dubble click on the generated code to get copy it.
4, start the beamer software and press ""enter licens code"" and paste the code into the software.
5, you can now use beamer in unlimited time :)

good luck!"

The missing step is that when you open the keygen, the top line says ""symmetry // CORE"" — you can either leave that or change it to whatever you want before you hit Generate, but when you get into Beamer, you have to use ""symmetry // CORE"" or the custom name you entered in the keygen as your name in Beamer. I had the same problem as you, 'cause I put a random name and entered the generated serial and got denied. When I redid it and used ""symmetry // CORE"" as my name, it worked.

1. Unzip
2. Copy Beamer to your Applications folder
3. In CORE Keygen, hit Patch and locate the copy of Beamer in your Applications folder. The keygen app should say it was successful.
4. Launch Beamer and hit Enter License.
5. In CORE Keygen, copy ""symmetry // CORE"" or whatever's up there and paste it into the Name line in Beamer.
6. in CORE Keygen, hit Generate. Copy the resulting serial into Beamer.

That should do it."

Thanks for that helpful and polite clarification. I do find it odd that people put out keygens / patchers that give the option of adding a custom 'name' yet the only one that works is the stock one that is already filled in. Oh well, I already bought the app. I was so impressed with the demo from the developers site, I had to have it. Works VERY well. Thanks for the help all the same FetalPig."
