Information
------------------------------

Documentary following a project to rebuild Gwanghwamun, the entrance gates to the Gyeongbokgung Palace in Seoul. Destroyed during the Japanese invasions of 1592, it was rebuilt in the 19th century only to be moved during the Japanese occupation in the early 1900s. Later, the wooden structure was wrecked during the Korean War and the base was rebuilt with concrete. The structure has become a symbol for the nation's struggles and major restoration work began in 2006, with the gate being disassembled and moved back to its original location. The South Korean government carried out the renovation using a 1925 blueprint and century-old glass photographs, native pine and traditional tools and techniques.
