Folksinger Caroline Herring has quietly but steadily been building a canon. It began back with her debut record, Twilight, in 2001. From the start she received many accolades, including ΓÇ£Best New ArtistΓÇ¥ at SXSW. Since then, the praise has continued to come in droves for her five subsequent albums. Camilla continues this construction project with her now-trademark deft craftsmanship, stirring storytelling and timeless tales that reveal a songwriter whose gifts of keen observation are being honed more sharply with each outing. Here, with Camilla, we have again Herring the historian, the storyteller who excels at chronicling and mythologizing historical figures who might otherwise exist only on the fringes of American folklore.
