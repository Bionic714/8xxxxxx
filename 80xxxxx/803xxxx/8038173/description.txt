From the Infowars web site :: On the Friday, January 18 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Prison Planet editor and journalist Paul Joseph Watson runs down the latest efforts to hobble the Second Amendment and demonize gun owners.

Also on today's broadcast, host Mike Adams talks with Texas State Rep. Steve Toth, who has stepped up to defend and protect the Second Amendment against the predatory behavior of Obama and the feds.
