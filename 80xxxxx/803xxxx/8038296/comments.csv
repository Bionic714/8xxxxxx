[V],STFmaryville,2013-01-19T23:44Z,"tpacomics, i will torrent that supergirl series, as soon as i download the issues. i ended up needing to get almost all of them from that MTCDC torrent you mentioned. (even though TPB is only tracking 1 seeder, luckily there are others out there -- the torrent is found on multiple sites.)"
