This is a torrent that I didn't create. I only found it on another site and I realized it isn't present here at TPB. All credit must go to the original scanner, Bchry-DCP. He or she makes so many of the best .cbz and .cbr archives of trade paperbacks and graphic novels!

Please seed and share with our friends here on TPB. --STFmaryvile
