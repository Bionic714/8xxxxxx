While ΓÇ£Home,ΓÇ¥ ΓÇ£40 Day DreamΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£JanglinΓÇ¥ are the joyous, bubbly, go-to favorites from Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic ZeroesΓÇÖ debut album, there is one song that rose above those anthems to stick with me on a deeper level. While it didnΓÇÖt have the same peaks and valleys, and the chorus wasnΓÇÖt nearly as catchy, the albumΓÇÖs title track, ΓÇ£Up From Below,ΓÇ¥ was captivating and beautiful in a subdued way, sounding just as much of a prayer hymn as an indie rock song.
