Dance Floor, a re-issue of the discontinued initial release from Dance Music Production.

Re-written, restructured and re-released, this course focuses on the methods and production techniques behind writing, engineering and producing a professional white label/funky house record for clubs.

The 4-hour video course walks through, step by step, the entire construction and production sequence, from a blank sequencer to the final production. The recording software was left running throughout the entire production and was later edited down to the most important points filling four hours for the DVD.

Split into sessions, the DVD covers the construction and production ethics used by todayΓÇÖs professional dance artists to create funky house. These sessions include what to listen for, the inspiration, the ideas, sampling, manipulation, pitching, frequency tuning and editing, vocals, building a groove, processing, effects, arrangement and mixing.
