BIRKHOFF TELLS NIKITA ABOUT SONYA  
Birkhoff (Aaron Stanford) tells Nikita 
(Maggie Q) that Sonya (guest star 
Lyndie Greenwood) is Amanda's (Melinda 
Clarke) mole and not only has Amanda 
reactivated Sonya's kill chip but she 
also placed a second mole in Division 
to keep an eye on her. Nikita, Michael 
(Shane West) and Ryan (Noah Bean) 
devise a plan to use Sonya to ferret 
out Amanda's hiding place and Birkhoff 
sets a trap for the second mole. 
Meanwhile, Michael confronts Alex 
(Lyndsy Fonseca) about her drug use 
and she begs him not to tell Nikita.
