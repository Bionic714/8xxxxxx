Duration: 118 min
Language: Japanese
Subtitles: English (hardcoded)

Synopsis:

An interesting film by Hitoshi Yazaki, produced during JapanΓÇÖs ΓÇ£lost decadeΓÇ¥. With its yellow colored images and sleepy atmosphere, it indeed captures some of the mindset of the era. Buildings are being torn down, people wander aimlessly, and even TokyoΓÇÖs streets appear strangely quiet. The two main characters are a man suffering from amnesia, and a woman who claims to him to be his sweetheart, but in reality is his sister.
ItΓÇÖs a beautiful movie with atmospheric music, some truly beautiful images, and the excessively adorable Yoshiko Yura. Yet, itΓÇÖs also a film that very much requires the interest and mindset for something that is heavily downplayed both story and character wise. It lacks aggressive social bite as well as sharp and rewarding character/psychological focus. -- sketchesofcinema.wordpress.com
