,pyroactive32,2013-01-21T05:25Z,"So, here's what happened. William Bell is actually still alive because he sent a clone to the age of dinosaurs and when he stopped all of the observers when he came back. Then, Walter realized that stopping Bell was a big mistake the first time he did it, so he went back in time with the observer child Michael and helped Bell create the newer universe and they became gods."
