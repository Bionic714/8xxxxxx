,isos4ever,2013-01-19T21:58Z,"I just downloaded this and tested using VLC and MPC and the video is out of sync.

I even rebooted my computer to make sure and played it again. And it's still out of sync."
,IPASuperior,2013-01-20T00:22Z,"@ isos4ever Hmm. Can you open it with VLC and quickly find the FPS? It's supposed to be 23.970. If it says 23.976, that's my fault and I'll fix it asap."
,isos4ever,2013-01-20T01:15Z,"@IPASuperior:

I have no idea how to find the FPS using VLC, however I do have MediaInfo and I checked it out with that and it reads this:

""Frame rate: 23.976 fps""

I guess this is the info you wanted, correct? :)"
,IPASuperior,2013-01-20T02:49Z,"Ugh. Ok, I know what's wrong. -.- the fps is wrong. I'll have to delete this torrent and reupload it. 

Sorry man. :/ give me a bit. "
,isos4ever,2013-01-20T16:49Z,"@ IPASuperior

Will you be removing and making a new topic for the re-done video or will you just add the new file here and mention that it's upgraded?"
,cozndan,2013-01-21T02:54Z,"It's not just out of sync, the sound cuts out midway thru the first episode"
,Vanek679,2013-01-21T15:02Z,you said that you needed help. in what way I can help you. with my English if something is wrong then I'm sorry I'm just out of Russia
,IPASuperior,2013-01-21T23:47Z,I'm going to delete this guys. Just watch my account for the upload. It's on it's way.
,isos4ever,2013-01-29T01:08Z,"@ IPASuperior

Do you have an idea when the updated version will be re-upped? It's been a few days since your last message and I was just wondering."
,isos4ever,2013-02-08T02:21Z,"@ IPASuperior

So I am guessing that this won't happen now, correct? :("
,IPASuperior,2013-02-09T16:01Z,"I have completely lost my Hulu+ account and can not get the show again.

So, no. Probably not. :("
