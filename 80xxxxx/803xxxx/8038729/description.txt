## Description

The CAT dataset includes 10,000 cat images. For each image, we
annotate the head of cat with nine points, two for eyes, one for
mouth, and six for ears. The detail configuration of the annotation
was shown in Figure 6 of the original paper:

Weiwei Zhang, Jian Sun, and Xiaoou Tang, "Cat Head Detection - How to
  Effectively Exploit Shape and Texture Features", Proc. of European
  Conf. Computer Vision, vol. 4, pp.802-816, 2008.

### Format

The annotation data are stored in a file with the name of the
corresponding cat image plus ".cat", one annotation file for each cat
image. For each annotation file, the annotation data are stored in the
following sequence:

 1.  Number of points (always 9)
 2.  Left Eye
 3.  Right Eye
 4.  Mouth
 5.  Left Ear-1
 6.  Left Ear-2
 7.  Left Ear-3
 8.  Right Ear-1
 9.  Right Ear-2
 10. Right Ear-3

### Training, Validation, and Testing

We randomly divide the data into three sets: 5,000 images for
training, 2,000 images for validation and 3000 images for testing.

### Copyright

The CAT dataset is only for research purposes, we do not have any
