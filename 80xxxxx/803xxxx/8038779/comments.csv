@ Yakomo ....... and you are a ""trusted uploader"" .... ( ? )

You have absolutely no idea what you're talking about .... ( Sorry to say ) .... !

===============================================

YOU have used a ""1080p.BluRay"" as the ""INPUT"" in this Convert.

THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THIS DVD IS NTSC .... ( 1080p.BluRay = NTSC )

===============================================

THIS IS PAL MATERIAL ( 25 Frames per second )

NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT .... !!"
