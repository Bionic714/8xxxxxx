,LordOfKobol,2013-01-23T13:18Z,"system requirements, grandma's pc wtf lol ;P thanks for this, but, does it really need the original sims 3 farlight download????? cant ya get it to work with whatever version. cheers. (also without us having to do stuff in regedit, that crap never works for me, and im fine with that, havent needed to so far, so, well only with, whats that game.. uh bloody, GTA rip off... WTF, saints row the third, I gave up in the end, bugger that crap. also it starts of bugged to hell. games like that should be fixed by groups like yours before uploading after an hour or so I gave up and deleted it. also, would be great if you could up GTA san andreas, with fully functioning 360 controller for windows support.. somehow. (not sure whos saints row I downloaded tho.. *shrugs* anyways thanks again."
,LordOfKobol,2013-01-23T13:21Z,"or if ya could just uh make some kinda, patch/hack w/e that implements full controller support for GTA san an, I have it on my ps2, but c'mon, PC FTW!!! (I know theres stuff like pinnacle game profiler, ect ect, but, that stuff blows just as hard)"
,wistfool,2013-01-24T18:21Z,"Um, the other torrent is only 162 MB? How can that be? I'm not questioning your awesomeness or whatever; am just kinda bad at this stuff."
,Dr.D.,2013-02-04T15:52Z,"@wistfool: The file in this torrent is 1.4GB big, so I don't know what your problem is."
,Dr.D.,2013-02-04T15:53Z,@HeroMaster: Thanks for the upload.
,SMOAK-inc,2013-02-17T22:28Z,"Just Curious, but if I OWN the legit copy of the most recent expansion, do I need to use a crack for any of the previous expansion packs? Since usually the crack is to skip the disk check but the disk check is for the most recent expansion."
,Shoobox,2013-02-20T02:38Z,"@Dr.D
the official Monte Vista is 217mb
so again why is this 1.41gb
what else is added to possibly make this 1.41gb?"
