thanks for the .....
I see you added a link fro conservativestream.com
I came across that sight awhile back but have never seemed able to get they audio to work?
any ideal what I may be doing wong...(maybe my quicktime is the problem? can anyother players be used?)or is it just the fact that it's still under construction?....great for find conservative stations...but that seems to be all I can get from site....any thought you have would be greatly appreciated thanks "
