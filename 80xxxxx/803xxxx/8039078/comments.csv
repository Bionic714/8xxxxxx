This is Michael Mann's definitive cut on Bluray.

I'd like the theatrical cut, which has the ""I will
fing you"" song in English. But it seems it's only
released on VHS and R2 DVD?

Thank you 3Li - you're my favorite uploader."
,Cibaka,2013-01-20T09:47Z,"Correction - ""I Will Find You""."
,joegi50,2013-03-18T20:57Z,"Our favourite movies and we finally have the best Audio Video, subtitles. Thank you.
One suggestion: whenever possible please have full screen, not widescreen. Thank again 3Li"

Oh yeah..one more thing..I have to advocate for Widescreen Always.

I do not understand the full screen mentality. Who would actually ""want"" to see a film..in Digital Clarity with all the bells and whistles of modern 'home theater' Yet Have 1/4 of the picture cut off? I mean that is a kind of bizarre idea..""yeah I want the Directors cut bluray quality but I want ONLY 3/4 of the Picture..""

Uhh..What?

Anyway...sorry..carried away there.

Requests (widescreen and 3+G Please):

'Shakes The Clown'

'Rolling Thunder'"
