I was laying in my room with window open. It was about 3am.   I heard a knocking sound.  I didn't pay any attention to it.  But I sensed something was watching me.  I made a very fast movement to jump up and look.  I heard the loudest sound, Like a huge model rocket going off outside the window.  Whatever it was.  It cut through the air quick.  So fast that it almost broke the speed of sound instantly.  All the hairs on my body stood on end.  I have never experienced something like this before.  It scared me so bad, I had to wake my wife up and tell her about this experience.  Something was looking in my window.  And It was not human."
[V],psspss,2013-01-19T10:05Z,"maybe it was someone wearing all black with a sky rocket otuside pranking you? prowler

or a meteorite explosion?

sometimes theres some local explanations
rather then paranormal or alien one"
[T],crwildman,2013-01-19T10:45Z,"yah well i live on 100 acres of land around a bunch of woods, no one would be outside pranking me.   Something saw my window open and came to take a look.   Whatever it was, it moved away from my window with a very high rate of speed.  So it was nothing coming down from the sky.   It is the unexplained."
[T],crwildman,2013-01-19T10:56Z,"Nothing that I know of could of broke through the air at such a high rate of speed to sound like a model rocket whizzing by in the air, with the origin of the sound starting directly outside my window which is only 2 feet from my head.  Then the sound shot outward, not directly up, not directly past me either.  I was at the window in less then a second looking out and I saw nothing, The moon was full so visibility was great.  Very weird experience, that I will never forget.  Just thought I would share that because I never believed in this paranormal bull shit, or ufos... Until this happened.  I just thought it was a bunch of crazy nuts or people on drugs lol"
[V],psspss,2013-01-19T11:23Z,"well maybes its that bat creature with red eyes


maybe you should not leave a window open

i would consider buying some of these $120usd 720p camerea for around the home I have a couple for front door and out side

I can use ispy on pc to bring up all cameras for instant view and they records to sd card everything 32gb needed though for best hing and
also can email stills or upload to ftp.. lots of functions

checkout dx.com and search om ip camera

even the $63 models arent bad but sd 640x480

also amazing IR on them at night even if use in a bedroom to capture ghosties"
[T],crwildman,2013-01-19T23:05Z,Yea soon as it happened i was thinking that i definately should have cameras around the home.  Because I want to know what the hell that was so bad.
