You will see no more imaginative film this year than Life of Pi, whose conceit of a young Indian boy stranded with a Bengal Tiger in a lifeboat amid the Pacific Ocean is fantastical yet real in its metaphoric implications. Quality sucked but you can find a HD one at lifeofpi.blackpathway.com which worked great for me. While the framing device of a story told to a stranger uses the old flashback, the lonely lifeboat is as new as any story told in the last century."
