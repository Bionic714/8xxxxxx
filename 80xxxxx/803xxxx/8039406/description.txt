In To the Moon you control Dr. Wyatt and Dr. Rosaleane, scientists who live in a world where it's possible to recreate memories. 
This enables the scientists to give dying people a chance to live out their final request ΓÇô even if only in their minds. 

Our scientists start To the Moon by arriving at the house of a dying, elderly man named John, whose last wish is to visit the moon. 
He doesn't seem to have indicated why, so it's up to the scientists cum detectives to infiltrate his mind and search for clues to discover the root of his desire. 

Once they've travelled back through enough layers in his stored up memories (working their way from senior citizen to child), the plan is to make his childhood-self want to become an astronaut, giving him the chance to "remember" going to the moon.
