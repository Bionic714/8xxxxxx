Information
------------------------------

The story behind one of the best-loved films of all time - E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial - how it was made and what the experience was like for its young cast. Including the story of how Steven Spielberg shot the film in script order to get a genuine emotional response from the child actors, and how E.T.'s eyes were inspired by a combination of Albert Einstein and a newborn baby. Henry Thomas, who played Elliott, returns to the house where much of the film was shot for the first time in 30 years. We also find out what happened to Henry and his fellow child stars once filming was over.
