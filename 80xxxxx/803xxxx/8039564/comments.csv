This is what I would suggest if you really want to move these books:

1) Make a file list of the contents as a separate .TXT file. Just a directory listing if nothing else

2) RAR each individual folder seperately

3) Make a torrent out of the separate RAR'ed folders *and* the contents listing

That way people can d/l whatever pieces parts they like, and will no doubt sing your praises as a collector of fine occult materials.

Just my two cents..."
,e8hffff,2013-01-19T15:51Z,Don't download RAR's as they usually are passworded.  This sharer has been warned with the same file a month or more ago and said they would separate the files into smaller blocks.
,VA_ATS,2013-01-19T22:26Z,"The .rar doesn't have a password...and I .rared the folders individually....

I did separate the files like I was told to....Why trll the comments section>?"
,w4r3zh4ck,2013-01-19T22:32Z,Why even give this guy sense ? Just let him get trolled.
,frobknob,2013-01-20T11:12Z,"VA: Look up at the torrent description. See where it says ""Files: 1""? That means the torrent has One, Fucking. File. When you click the ""1"", it shows you that the One File is named ""VA_ATS Esoteric Library.rar"" and it's size is 51.16 Gig.

And you're not even seeding the thing. 

I think it's time for you to give up."
,VA_ATS,2013-01-20T12:44Z,"I am seeding; I just can't always seed, because the extra drain on my wifi, will boot me offline..

If you would do me a favor and list exactly how I should package all the folders before .raring so you can pick what you'd like, I'd be more than happy to do so..."
,VA_ATS,2013-01-20T12:56Z,"By the way; once the .RAR is downloaded, it has the list of files, which you may pick and choose what you want to extract. After you have taken what you want, just delete the damn package....You think I like having to let 100GB of my hard drive sit in a rar and the folder I had to rar?

Give me a break dude..."
,w4r3zh4ck,2013-01-20T17:02Z,Why don't you give us a vacation dude.. Enough is enough
,shaman2.0,2013-02-01T18:49Z,Any possibility of getting this seeded?  Thanks for the upload!
,burt007,2013-02-12T09:31Z,"Why don't you seed this reiki manual torrent?

http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7972568/Reiki_Course_Manuals

It's only 9 megabytes."
,RainAcaicia13,2013-03-03T19:04Z,Can someone please seed this I really want to download this. Thx
