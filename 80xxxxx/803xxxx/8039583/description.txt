Berlin in the 1930s. A small revue theater is told to shape up or otherwise face closure because of its political criticism. The performers don't want to lose their jobs, so they comply with the orders. With a good close of raunchiness they spice up the entertainment -- only to discover that work has never been this much fun! This array of top stars from the scene is sure to spark your fire.
