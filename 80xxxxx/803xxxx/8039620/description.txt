Movie Info

The final months of Bobby Sands, the Irish Republican Army activist
 who protested his treatment at the hands of British prison guards 
with a hunger strike, are chronicled in this historical drama, the 
first feature film from artist-turned-filmmaker Steve McQueen. Davey
Gillen (Brian Milligan) is an IRA volunteer who is sentenced to Belfast's
 infamous Maze prison, where he shares a cell with fellow IRA member
 Gerry Campbell (Liam McMahon). Like most of the IRA volunteers behind 
bars, Gillen and Campbell are subjected to frequent violence by the 
guards, who in turn live with the constant threat of assassination at 
the hands of Republicans during their off-hours. Campbell and Gillen are
 taking part in a protest in which they and their fellow IRA inmates are
 refusing to wear standard prison-issue uniforms as a protest against 
Britain's refusal to recognize them as political prisoners, a move that
 is complicating their efforts to pass information among the other 
prisoners. As the protest fails to get results, one IRA member behind
 bars, Bobby Sands (Michael Fassbender), decides to take a different 
tack and begins a hunger strike, refusing to eat until Irish officials
 are willing to acknowledge the IRA as a legitimate political organization
. However, while Sands' protest gains the attention both inside prison 
walls and in the international news, not everyone believes what he's 
doing is right, and Sands finds himself verbally sparring with a priest
 (Liam Cunningham) who questions the ethics and effectiveness of the 
strike.
