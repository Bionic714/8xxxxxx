Although there is nothing complicated about constructing healthier homes, building for health is still not standard practice, and in fact there are many aspects of conventional home construction that are detrimental to human well-being.


 From foundation to rooftop, to home care and repair, Prescriptions for a Healthy House takes the mystery out of healthy-house building, renovation, and maintenance by walking the owner/architect/builder team through the entire construction process. Chapters include:

 - Frame construction alternatives
 - Thermal and moisture control
 - Flooring and finishes
 - Furnishings
