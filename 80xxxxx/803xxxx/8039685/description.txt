Singer-songwriter Joshua Radin’s fourth album, Underwater, is full of a lot of things, but energy is not one of them. From someone prone to reviewing high-energy stuff, though, this is a nice change of pace.

“Let the rain fall,” he says. “Tomorrow is gonna be better,” he says. “Time passes slow,” he says. “I’ll save it for another day,” he says.

Makes you want to charge out the door and conquer the world, huh?

If not, that’s okay. Because we all have those days where sleeping sounds better than anything else, or maybe stuff just sucks. Don’t fear, there’s a Radin for that. Underwater is really a step back towards material from the earlier Radin catalog — see “One of Those Days” from 2008′s Simple Times — but it’s still perfect folkish melancholia à la Ryan Adams.
