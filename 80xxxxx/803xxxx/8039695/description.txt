The True Believer: Thoughts on the Nature of Mass Movements
By Eric hoffer 1951, 192 pages, language: English

A stevedore on the San Francisco docks in the 1940s, Eric Hoffer wrote philosophical treatises in his spare time while living in the railroad yards. The True Believer -- the first and most famous of his books -- was made into a bestseller when President Eisenhower cited it during one of the earliest television press conferences. Completely relevant and essential for understanding the world today, The True Believer is a visionary, highly provocative look into the mind of the fanatic and a penetrating study of how an individual becomes one.


The Ordeal of Change
By Eric hoffer 1963, 128 pages, language: English

Eric Hoffer -- one of America's most important thinkers and the author of The True Believer -- lived for years as a Depression Era migratory worker. Self-taught, his appetite for knowledge -- history, science, mankind -- formed the basis of his  insight to human nature. Nowhere is this more evident than in Hoffer's seminal work, The Ordeal of Change, essays on the duality and essentiality of change in man throughout history.
