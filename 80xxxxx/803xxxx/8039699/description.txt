Growing up in our generation, it was almost impossible to not have heard the song ΓÇ£Ocean AvenueΓÇ¥ over and over again until it was recognizable just by its few opening chords.
Well, nine years, three albums, and one hiatus since YellowcardΓÇÖs breakout track and album of the same name, we get their eighth studio album, ΓÇ£Southern Air.ΓÇ¥

IΓÇÖll cut to the chase quickly. This is a good album, and, after many listens, possibly even YellowcardΓÇÖs best. So fans of Yellowcard, take heart.
But what makes this album unique is that there might be something to enjoy here for even those who arenΓÇÖt overly fond of the violin-toting, pop-punk rockers.
