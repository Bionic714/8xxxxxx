Proving your Windows Server skills isnΓÇÖt a task to be taken lightly. TodayΓÇÖs MCSE tests against a broader-than-ever set of technologies, from Windows Server itself to the entirety of System Center. But you already know that. MicrosoftΓÇÖs 70-414 exam is the fifth and final hurdle between you and your MCSE: Server Infrastructure certification. 

Congratulations! The road to get here ΓÇô as well as all those nights of studying ΓÇô has surely been long. 

Having gotten this far, youΓÇÖre already experienced with installing and configuring Windows Server 2012. You know how to administer it. You also know how to configure its advanced services, and design and implement a server infrastructure with the aid of System Center. 

But this exam is different. 

MicrosoftΓÇÖs 70-414 exists as the capstone to your entire certification effort. This exam doesnΓÇÖt so much ask ΓÇ£what to doΓÇ¥ as ΓÇ£when to do it." Indeed, youΓÇÖll get a few questions about Windows Server 2012 and System Center configurations, but the 70-414ΓÇÖs primary goal is proving you know when to implement Microsoft technologies. 

To help you prep for an exam like this, weΓÇÖve brought in one of our big guns. Veteran CBT Nuggets instructor Greg Shields has passed over 30 IT exams in his career. HeΓÇÖs been an MCSE almost as long as thereΓÇÖs been an MCSE, and he knows his way around Microsoft certification. That deep and broad experience is why weΓÇÖve asked him to produce our 70-414 MCSE: Server Infrastructure capstone training. 

In this exam prep series, Greg speaks directly to MicrosoftΓÇÖs exam objectives. He explains each objective in common sense terms, whiteboarding architectures where appropriate while demoing configurations when a little extra attention might be necessary. This training is no MCSE braindump. ItΓÇÖs a targeted study guide thatΓÇÖll make you a wiser Windows Server administrator while tightly focusing on your 70-414 study efforts. 

Good luck with that final step towards Microsoft MCSE certification. With GregΓÇÖs help, youΓÇÖll be ready to prove not only that you know ΓÇ£what to doΓÇ¥ in solving IT problems, but also ΓÇ£when to do it."
