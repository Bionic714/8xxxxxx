Joss, Joss, Joss. What are we going to do with you? The queen of the growling throat is back with a sequel to her 2003 debut, The Soul Sessions, and itΓÇÖs dropping into a post-Adele world. The two powerhouses are not truly competitors ΓÇö Adele caters to the Top 40, Joss less so ΓÇö but both are soul-styled Brits with AK-47s where their larynges should be. Since StoneΓÇÖs 2009 Colour Me Free, the charts have been in a committed relationship with AdeleΓÇÖs ΓÇ£Rolling In The DeepΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£Someone Like You.ΓÇ¥ Heck, sheΓÇÖs not even the most famous Joss in the world anymore. But you know what Stone has that sets her apart?
