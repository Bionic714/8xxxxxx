	NOTES:
	
	--crf 23 slower
	
	Really poor compressability on this one so had to use
	--crf 23. Didn't help much cause files are still big
	and look pretty bad. All the grass, leaves and water
	really mess things up.
	
	INFO:
	
	MINDTHEGAP is living up to its groupname. We do mind all
	the gaps in archives out there. If we see a rerun airing
	of unreleased eps from series we try to get it. If the
	show is really old and the hope of finding the original
	release is gone, we try to fix that too with iNTERNALs. 
	
	This of course makes our releases a bit random and some
	might think we are mad but there will be a reason behind
	the madness.
