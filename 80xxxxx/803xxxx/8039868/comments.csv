[V],HighCode,2013-01-19T19:28Z,"Hoops, thx phase700b for pointing it out, I meant it's full screen, I meant 1280/720.
Again display is 1280/720. sorry about it.
(1920/1080 @ 4000 KB/s would be bad news lol)"

,.Leto.,2013-01-21T02:09Z,"Don't waste your time with this. The English dubbing is so poorly done, ridiculous and horrible that it's ruining this movie, which is really great btw. Get this release instead with the original Indonesian audio:

It's also the unrated version, 1:41:04, and I played both files simultaneously fullscreen, picture quality is identical, I can't see a difference."
