It then uses this key to BLACKLIST the License Code provided with this program. If you Uninstall the program, it does not remove this registry key. Meaning it stays in your Windows Registry forever. This constitutes a violation of your rights because it is not a documented function. Also, this key Exhibits random behavior because it seems to work on 1 computer but not one another. So if you block it in firewall in your FIRST installation, then Keep it blocked, you will be able to register. If you run this program without a Firewall, you will NEVER be able to register it again. I understand they want to sell this software to make money, but they are SNEAKY about it. Good luck finding the License in your registry to remove this POS for good.
 NTFS does not really need defragging anyway because its all Hog Wash B.S. modern hard drives do not need."
