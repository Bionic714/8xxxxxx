,FilmTrix,2013-01-19T18:54Z,"Take a look on description 

---------[ SUBTiTLE ]-------
Swedish
- Virage @ Swesub.nu"
[T],[qusawa],2013-01-19T19:28Z,"That wasn't what I asking about!

Take a look at 02.12.34 In all rips I watched have hardcoded subs there!"
[V],Mr.Stifmeister,2013-01-19T20:02Z,"@[qusawa]: Source used is BiDA release and yes, it got that hardcoded sub there, but wont be any problem if you look with the swedish subtitle or without the swe subtitle.
Its not a big deal if you ask me :)"
[V],Sir_TankaLot,2013-01-19T20:19Z,"Its not a SWESUB, its a CUSTOM SWESUB.
But its an MKV, so you can turn subs on or off.


Thx 4 this anyway.  :)"
[V],Sir_TankaLot,2013-01-19T20:20Z,aaa.  my bad.  sorry.  :P
[V],Sir_TankaLot,2013-01-19T20:52Z,"[qusawa] is in da house. Giving minus on torrents. 

""Som om man bryr sig""   lol"
,moshster,2013-01-20T00:12Z,"If this is BiDA audio then this is still not an original soundtrack, it's mashup of English front and Russian rear channels."
,Jakkal666,2013-01-20T12:01Z,"How come the video bitrate is 4300 kbps? Typo?

I take it you used mkvmerge and simply muxed the swedish subtitle? That shouldn't affect the video quality. The BiDA-release has a bitrate of 4749 kbps."
[V],Mr.Stifmeister,2013-01-20T13:00Z,"@Jakkal666: Take a look at mediainfo again, and the 4749 kbps is the ""Overall bitrate"". The video bitrate is only 4300 kbps and then the audio bitrate is 448, so togheter its 4749 kbps so there is no typo :)"
,FilmTrix,2013-01-21T11:08Z,"[qusawa] - If there was hardcorded russian inburned subtitles it would be written in description. 
There is on specific scenes but not in the whole movie.

Mr.Stifmeister - Helloow"
,pkpnilan,2013-03-17T01:17Z,"Thanks to the uploader! Movie was OK as i expected it to be! I usually watch all the movies at film.handitrade.com because they have HD's but they didn't have this one so im happy to have piratebay :) Good torrent quality - A9 V9,"
,lumpy123,2013-03-24T23:41Z,Vad är det för ett jävla missfoster som har översatt filmen? eller vem fan hinner läsa två rader text på mindre än 2 sekunder? så jävla amatörmässigt. Förstör hela filmen. Skulle hellre hyrt filmen för 100 spänn än låta en jävla amatörtextare förstöra den.
