,Katara_dk,2013-01-19T18:40Z,"Once again you have managed get the video and audio out of sync -.-' 

When will you learn from your mistakes?"
,poffik,2013-01-19T20:49Z,he's too busy blowing his own trumpet
[T],SCSA420,2013-01-19T22:07Z,"It sure is fucking funny because I just copied the mp4 file to a 8 GB USB flash drive and connected it to my LG 3D BluRay player and it plays perfectly in sync here. Maybe your pc just isn't good enough so go Get yourself a newer faster pc or a BluRay player that is mkv and or mp4 compatible like a LG, Samsung,Panasonic or Philips like I have here then all you have to do is put the file on a USB flash drive like I do here then connect it to the BluRay player and away you go how hard is that?"
,znavy264,2013-01-20T13:54Z,Ya Audio and Video out of sync...confirmed.  SCSA420...it has nothing to do with our PCs.  
[T],SCSA420,2013-01-20T20:42Z,"LIKE I SAID BELOW THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE F'N VIDEO FILE. I'M SICK AND TIRED OF HEARING YOU LEECHERS WHINE. THE FILE PLAYS PERFECTLY FINE HERE IN PERFECT SYNC ON 3 DIFFERENT BLURAY PLAYERS AND 3 DIFFERENT PC'S. IF IT DOESN'T WORK FOR YOU I DON'T GIVE A FUCK ANY MORE BECAUSE I'M SICK AND TIRED OF HEARING YOU PEOPLE WHO CANT FIGURE OUT HOW TO PROPERLY CONFIGURE YOUR COMPUTER AND VIDEO EQUIPMENT TO PLAY HD VIDEO FILES BITCH ABOUT HAVING SYNC PROBLEMS. OBVIOUSLY IF IT IS NOT OUT OF SYNC ON MY CORE I7 2700k QUAD CORE CPU WITH 16 GB OF RAM, NVIDIA 680 GT GRAPHICS CARD AND 10 TB OF HARD DRIVE SPACE AND ALSO PLAYS FINE ON 3 DIFFERENT BLURAY PLAYERS (LG, SAMSUNG, PANASONIC) AND 3 DIFFERENT PC's (CORE I7 SANDY BRIDGE PC, CORE 2 DUO PC, CORE I7 IVY BRIDGE LAPTOP PC) IT DOESN'T TAKE A DUMB ASS TO FIGURE OUT THAT THE PROBLEM IS DEFINITELY ON YOUR END NOT MINE  AND IT IS YOUR PROBLEM NOT MINE.

,Apophis_,2013-01-21T18:00Z,"Please, top talking SCSA420, your rips are really bad and it is a shame that there are people that are watching TCW like that. The quality of your torrents is really, really terrible."
,Ahsoka420,2013-01-22T00:31Z,"SCSA420
I'm a little embarrassed that you have to write this in the first place, FACT People, you are downloading these torrents for free, be grateful. A lot of work and bandwidth is spent by the uploader SCSA420 on providing YOU with free content. Be grateful for what you get, otherwise, spend the big bucks and go to the theaters, order the WWE Pay Per View's yourself or buy the store bought BluRay's when they come out.

I have been a fan of your uploads for a few years now. When I moved away from Limewire and Bearshare and became ""enlightened"" to torrents I found you when I was looking for WWE and TNA wrestling shows and The Clone Wars. They are consistently the quickest, best looking and complete I have been able to find. I have never had any trouble with any of your uploads playing and that is playing them from an Xbox 360, to a double core laptop and a 2nd gen i7 laptop to a netbook and then to a standalone DVD or BluRay player.

Fuck the haters bro they will be gone soon. You will always have our core group of downloaders that greatly appreciate what you do for us. I for one will stick with SCSA420. Thank you for your wonderful releases they are perfect. We can't live in the past where you never need to upgrade your codecs because technology will leave us behind if we do. Keep uploading, and take no notice of the ungrateful shit heads, there are so many of us that are eternally grateful for your efforts, I for one, so keep up the good work. As I quote Mr. Spock, ""The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or the one."" We the MANY appreciate what you ""The One"" do, fuck the few."
,redcardinal,2013-01-26T00:13Z,"Well, I just played this on my 4 year old pc in both VLC and Windows Media Players and I played fine. The audio is NOT out of sync.

SCSA420 - many thanks for the torrent and ignore these complaining halfwits.

Complaining halfwits - Katara_dk, poffik, znnavy264 and Apophis_ - you're either trolls or very stupid. Either way, suggest you go away and don't comment again until you've either reached puberty or learn how to play media files..."
,Katara_dk,2013-01-26T16:07Z,"Sure SCSA420 blame my computer, like znavy264 said: ""it has nothing to do with our PCs. ""

I just got a new Computer system:

Intel Core i7 3.6GHz
16GB DDR3 SDRAM PC3-21300
Radeon HD7970 3GB GDDR5 Memory 
3TB HDD
480GB SSD
Blu-ray Player/Burner

And the video and audio is stille out of syncs.
Nomatter what player I use (VLC, KMPlayer or WMP).

It's not my computer that is the problem, it's your files.
If you still say it's my computer who are the problem, then you say almost all computer in the world can't play your videos, because they need a computer super, because my computer is one of the best you can get :)"
,redcardinal,2013-02-01T00:03Z,">>Katara_dk

Like I said in my previous comment, this worked fine on my pc with audio/video in sync SO CLEARLY THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THE FILE...

As of now, there's about 90 peeps seeding and strangely enough they don't seem to be experiencing any difficulties."
