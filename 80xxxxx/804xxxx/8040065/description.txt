Lyrics : There is no political solution / To our troubled evolution / Have no faith in constitution / There is no bloody revolution / / We are spirits in the material world / Are spirits in the material world / Are spirits in the material world / Are spirits in the material world / / Our so-called leaders speak / With words they try to jail you / The subjugate the meek / But it's the rhetoric of failure / We are spirits in the material world / Are spirits in the material world / Are spirits in the material world / Are spirits in the material world / / Where does the answer lie? / Living from day to day / If it's something we can't buy / There must be another way / / We are spirits in the material world / Are spirits in the material world / Are spirits in the material world / Are spirits in the material world
