From the personal finance correspondent for public radioΓÇÖs Marketplace Money, a new plan for a new economic realityΓÇöthe philosophy and practice of living frugally.
As a once-in-a-lifetime downturn deepens, our go-go economy has become an uh-oh economy. But as trusted finance reporter Chris Farrell explains, thereΓÇÖs a silver lining to this cloud: It is accelerating a trend already under way in America toward what he calls the New FrugalityΓÇöa fresh way of thinking about how, what, and why we consume. In todayΓÇÖs economy, a ΓÇ£sustainableΓÇ¥ lifestyle isnΓÇÖt just one thatΓÇÖs good for the planetΓÇöitΓÇÖs one that is based around core values and one that sustains your bank balance as well.

In this friendly, approachable book, Farrell explains both the theory and the practice of living frugally. Frugality, he reminds us, does not mean old-fashioned penny-pinching. It means spending your money on quality rather than quantityΓÇöbuying the best you can afford but the least you need. Drawing on his expertise as a financial reporter and his years of conversations with his public radio listeners, he provides down-to-earth, practical advice for every aspect of your financial life, including:
ΓÇó how to always maintain a ΓÇ£margin of safetyΓÇ¥ in your spending
ΓÇó the frugal home: renting vs. owning
ΓÇó the two best ways to save for college
ΓÇó wise debt vs. foolish debt
ΓÇó why giving your money away can be ΓÇ£newly frugalΓÇ¥
