,silentinquiry,2013-01-19T18:10Z,Is this the Russian source one ?
,l4mee,2013-01-19T18:34Z,It must be since blu-ray release date is Feb 05
,silentinquiry,2013-01-19T19:26Z,"Thank you, therefore it has the russian title, etc, will wait for a clean dvd."
[V],Zen_Bud,2013-01-19T19:49Z,"@silentinquiry

Nobody, include you ,have watch this rip yet!

at the moment  92%, so why are trolling?

I will see it later tonight and anoXmous rip is real nice work."
,silentinquiry,2013-01-19T22:26Z,Are you saying this is without the russian title and is in english? 
,silentinquiry,2013-01-19T22:28Z,Let me know what you think ok ? 
[V],Zen_Bud,2013-01-19T22:39Z,"@silentinquiry

I give the A10 and V10

but sure there are hardcoded Russian but that's is so little and  is not disturbing, but it is not favourite flicks.

What do you think?"
,silentinquiry,2013-01-19T22:50Z,"I will bow to your judgement, thank you"
,silentinquiry,2013-01-19T22:55Z,"Мой друг, я склоняюсь к вашему суждению"
,32asfdoc,2013-01-20T01:57Z,"Do not listen to the trolls. 
Anoxmous rips are first rate."
,sshalafi,2013-01-20T13:36Z,"Does this version have the rear russian audio channels?

Why doesn't the torrent description point that it is the hardcoded Russian text? I'm tired of uploaders not pointing it so people download it thinking it's another version."
[V],Zen_Bud,2013-01-20T14:42Z,"@sshalafi
I have watch 50% and no russian audio so far:)

The hardcoded text is not in the dialogue,
 it is info ex ""Moscow 1999"" , and is not at all disturbing :)

So the info is correct!"
,silentinquiry,2013-01-20T16:02Z,"32asfordoc,
Nobody asked your opinion, nor said anoXmous uploads were bad, so go crawl back under your bridge pin head."
[V],QborT,2013-01-20T18:55Z,"Zen_Bud, maybe if your uploads were labeled correctly people would bitch less.  

Nobody to blame but yourself when you don't include the RC tag on an RC rip.  It ain't rocket science."
[V],Zen_Bud,2013-01-20T19:36Z,"@QborT

you are working very hard with yours rocket..!

,berzha101,2013-01-21T15:29Z,"^Zen_Bud, lolololol"
[V],QborT,2013-01-21T20:08Z,"Mock me all you want (I don't care), it certainly doesn't change the fact that this rip is labeled incorrectly."
[V],Zen_Bud,2013-01-21T21:09Z,"Why do you return here and spread shit if you don't care?

This is correct label  and you have to learn how ...

and that don't changed that fact that you are a moron!
"
[V],Zen_Bud,2013-01-21T21:13Z,"Hej QborT  andmoron here are some more wrong label flick....LoL

https://thepiratebay.sx/search/Cloud%20Atlas/0/99/207

hahahahahahah lot to do ..........hahahahaaha


al wrong hahahahaha"
,pepiloco,2013-01-23T18:50Z,Thanks. Full HD. Excellent
[V],QborT,2013-01-24T17:41Z,"Really Zen_Bud?  Do you understand what an RC/R5 rip is?  Every single rip of Cloud Atlas available (so far) is from an RC source, that you P2P crews have been trying to pass off as authentic.

Some of the P2P groups have labeled this correctly, but most haven't.  And that is truly a shame for the average users.

The only reason I return to your rip is because despite calling me names and your attempts to mock me I am trying to point out the obvious to you.  THIS IS AN RC AND anoXmous LABELED IT WRONG!!!!!

You were offended by users complaining (actually they were just asking and you got very defensive) about Russian titles in the movie.  Basically all I'm saying is label it correctly and you wouldn't have to defend youself.  Easy as pie."
[V],Zen_Bud,2013-01-24T18:33Z,"@QborT 
Fuck off spammer or I report you and get you banned !"
[V],QborT,2013-01-27T19:30Z,"LuLz, truth hurts eh.  Providing realistic info for the users so they can make an educated decission is spam?  Go ahead and report me if you wish."
[V],Zen_Bud,2013-01-27T20:15Z,"****** WHAT ARE THE PIRATE BAY PLANING TO DO ABOUT MINUS SPAM ? *******
















This is OLD and nothing happens. And we are tired that nothing happens:(

,MyFootHurts,2013-02-13T05:00Z,"What a shit uploader. Can't even label the torrent correctly and when he gets called on it his response is to say ""other people label it wrong as well!"" and to cry about.

Well fuck you, you fucking crybaby child."

,alregenhardt,2013-02-24T19:27Z,"Well, I WAS gonna get this torrent, then I seen how immature this guy is.  No thank you!"
,IncisiveJim,2013-03-04T05:18Z,Excellent audio and visual.
,prozin32,2013-03-20T22:08Z,"Thanks to the uploader! Movie was OK as i expected it to be! I usually watch all the movies at film.hasann.net because they have HD's but they didn't have this one so im happy to have piratebay :) Good torrent quality - A9 V9,"
,WalterLloyd,2013-03-27T15:31Z,"wtf is RC? so is this a good copy or not?

Instead of whining like morons give us some useful info"
,brewhead,2013-03-29T04:42Z,"RC is good info, you ignorant fuck. It's called Region C. Which means its a Region C sourced rip. For this movie specifically, it means that the on screen date/location titles in the movie are in Cyrillic.  Do you know what Cyrillic is? "
,brewhead,2013-03-29T04:43Z,"Oh, and Zen_Bud, you are a fucking child. Grow the fuck up."
,rahlo10,2013-04-18T22:46Z,thanks
,Robertsx,2013-05-20T07:22Z,"V/A 10/10 Quality is amazing. Movie is shit, I made it half way through and decided to cut my losses and turn it off."
