Liam Neeson headlines this thriller about a prominent doctor on a business
trip to Germany when he awakens from a coma to find that another man has 
stolen his identity and taken over his life. Dr. Martin Harris (Neeson) has
just arrived in Berlin to deliver an important presentation when he realizes
that his briefcase has gone missing, and leaves his wife, Elizabeth (January Jones),
at their hotel to try and retrieve it. During his cab ride back to the airport, 
however, a serious car accident lands Dr. Harris in the hospital, where he lies 
in a coma for four days. Upon awakening, Dr. Harris is horrified to discover that 
every relic of his identity has been completely erased. His shock is soon compounded 
when, upon seeking out his wife at a lavish party, another man (Aidan Quinn) appears 
by her side claiming to be the real Dr. Martin Harris, and requests that hotel security 
protect them from the unstable "imposter." Facing total denial from everyone he turns to, 
Dr. Harris gets a tip from a sympathetic nurse to seek out the assistance of Ernst JÃ¼rgen 
(Bruno Ganz), the former head of the German Secret Police, who implores him to track down 
Gina (Diane Kruger), the illegal immigrant taxi driver who narrowly saved his life, and may 
hold the answers to all of his questions. Now, the closer Dr. Harris gets to solving the 
mystery, the greater the danger becomes until the astonishing truth is revealed, plunging 
him into a desperate race against time.
