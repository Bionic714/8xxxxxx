When a mission of first contact doesn't go as expected, astrobiologist Liang is trapped underneath the surface of Mars. With the help of his trusty jetpack and his allies on the surface, you must help Liang discover the secret ecosystem underground and bring a sleeping planet to life. Waking Mars developers Tiger Style describe the gameplay as "action gardening" where the player controls how the ecosystem of Mars develops, making for a unique environment dictated by the player's actions.
