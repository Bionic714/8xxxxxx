BIBLICAL PREDICTIONS- All Nations Will Rise Against Israel:
For those familiar with history, it's clear that Israel are not the aggressors.  As Obamanation strives to supply Israel's neighbors, Muslim Extremist nations with severe hatred for both Christians and Jews, with weapons of deadly warfare, we Christians must choose sides.  Do you stand loyal with the Apple of God's eye or those dark forces ushering in the NWO and the end-times?

Conspiracy Theory with Jesse Ventura Apocalypse 2012:
Do scientists really believe Earth is headed for disaster in 2012? Is our government secretly planning to save and protect the elite - while leaving the rest of us to fend for ourselves?

Date - 12-14-09;  Are UFOs real? What does the Bible have to say about them?  Are they the evil, hybrid beings called "Nephilim" of ages past?  Right now countries all over the world are opening up their secret files to the public about UFO ΓÇ£sightings.ΓÇ¥  Bible scholar Dr. Chuck Missler, from the Koinonia Institue, and Sid Roth discuss the connection between UFOs and the Nephilim on the TV program, It's Supernatural.

Testimony - Army Training & killing of civilians acceptable:
JESSE MACBETH: TESTIMONY OF A FORMER US ARMY RANGER IN IRAQ.  This 35 minute interview will change how you view the U.S. occupation of Iraq forever. I cannot possibly recommend this more highly. An Iraq war veteran tells of atrocities he and other fellow-soldiers committed reguarly while in Iraq. I have never seen this level of honesty from a U.S. soldier who directly participated in the slaughtering of Iraqis.
