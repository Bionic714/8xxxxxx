The novels feature the adventures of a group of young children Julian, Dick, Anne and Georgina (George) and their dog Timothy. Blyton created several similar groups for her detective series, including The Secret Seven, The Adventurous Four (not to be confused with The Adventure Series) and Five Find-Outers, but the Famous Five is the best-known and most popular of these.

Most of comic books in the series are based on Famous Five books created by Claude Voilier. The first three of these volumes have also been released in English, under the name The Famous Five.
