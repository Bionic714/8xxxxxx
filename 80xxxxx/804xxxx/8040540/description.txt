ΓÇÿTalhotblondΓÇÖ is based on the true story of Thomas Montgomery, a machine worker
in Upstate New York. To outsiders, Thomas Montgomery seemed like the perfect family 
man taking his girls to swim lessons and his dog Shadow for walks each day. He had a 
beautiful wife by the name of Cindy for 16 years.

Inspired by the chilling real-life cast of Thomas Montgomery, this made-for-television 
drama from producer/director Courteney Cox serves as a cautionary tale about trusting 
strangers on the internet. Montgomery was a family man fast-approaching 50 when he began
chatting with an online stranger who claimed to be a gorgeous teenage girl. Infatuated 
with the pictures she had sent to him, he claimed to be an 18-year-old Marine recruit who
was on his way to boot camp. Before long, Montgomery and his internet chat partner were
engaging in intense rounds of cyber sex. But when the mysterious internet beauty turned 
her affections toward one of Tommy's co-workers, the stage is set for a deadly confrontation
fueled by deception and desire.
