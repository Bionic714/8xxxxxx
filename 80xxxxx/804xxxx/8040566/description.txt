It was by the noughts that Gibrat began to shift gears in his work. He started work on his landmark two volume series, Le Sursis set during the Second World War in Nazi occupied France.

The story is set in sleepy town of Cambeyrac, Aveyron. Julien, our protagonist, sneaks into the sleep village. A deserter presumed dead, he decides to spend the remainder of the war hidden in an attic of an abandoned home. He spends his days gazing upon Cecile, the waitress in a nearby cafe. As the months pass, military presence begins to close in the small village. Can Julian resist staying hidden long enough without caving in to his urges for the lovely Cecile?

Critics admired Gibrat for managing to capture a sense of realism and tone. The narrative successfully interweaves history to the reader without hitting them over the head. Despite the settings being bathed in warm summer light, characters still have to confront grim reality of war.

These books are just gorgeous to behold. Each comic panel is steeped in atmosphere and theres a definite feeling of isolation and longing between the characters. Note that it is in this period that Gibrat started to shift his illustrations towards a more painterly look.
