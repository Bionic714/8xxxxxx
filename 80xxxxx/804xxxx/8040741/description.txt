This is a compatibility conversion of http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7692942
(My android phone couldn't play the original 24 bit files, so I converted them to 16 bit/44,1kHz.)

Some minor adjustments to levels, balance and overall sheen were made in reaper. (http://reaper.fm) Original rip is tilted somewhat to the right side.

Foobar2000 was used for the conversion and tagging.

B1 We Drift Like Worried Fire
B2 Strung Like Lights At Thee Printemps Erable
