The con to this is that all the episodes are MKV formatted. So Windows Media Player won't be able to play them. Except episode 25. Which is an MP4.  But VLC works fine for the MKV format.

All around impressive torrent. Naturally this took some time to download. Took me two hours. So give it time. It's worth the wait!"
