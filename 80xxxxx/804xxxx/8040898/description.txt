One of the better Japanese Drama's. This is the complete series, and is a mix of two different fansub groups, Amrayu and SARS. Credit for the subbing goes exclusively to them, this is only a re-posting of their work as it is no longer readily available. Find their other work here: http://www.sars-fansubs.com/
