,jamc92,2013-01-24T20:36Z,"You know, I really like your version but it doesn't have something that it's really useful for me and maybe other players. A ""Server Browser"" that's why I prefer from another uploaders. Thank's for the upload anyway! If someday you include a Server Browser, your version will be my default L4D2 game to play and to recommend."
