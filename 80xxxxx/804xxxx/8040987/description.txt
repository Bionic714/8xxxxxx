Recommended settings for our torrent :

for best flexibility : (utorrent and BitTorrent users)
fast peers should use 7000 as global connection number
very fast peer (T1 and more) should use 10000
we recommend you to use a minimum number of 1000 at least if you have 1 meg up speed real anyway.
(We recommend to any cabled peer to use PeerBlock 'cause most cabled IPs are highly tracked concerning P2P activity...)
Work always in crypted mode (Normal or Forced for your own security and our,please.)
running without it is just dangerous as risky business 'cause we are all highly tracked and even more as you can imagine on torrent network.
We always try to bring you the best security as we can on any torrent that we could seed...
Ty for understanding
Note : transmission peers must use the maximum number as well as this torrent client have a huge lack of flexibility as far as we know.
Avoid to run with too tense,you must always try to be maximum flexible as long as you can.
This condition is crucial and will permit us to keep a better stable seed so.
avoid to run on torrent if you have a too slow connection 'cause you could be responsible of huge traffic congestion on our seed...
If you need some help for best experience,feel free to ask some so. 

Enjoy and seed,please,as long as you can,thx.
have a nice evening
Best regards
