Season 11 of Project Runway returns with a whole new look. This time, every challenge is a team challenge, forcing the 16 designers to work together while making their own creations stand out. The competition is intense and every episode has you on pins and needles waiting to see who creates beautiful clothing, who creates conflict and who creates both! Style icons Heidi Klum, Tim Gunn and Nina Garcia welcome Zac Posen as a featured judge and are also joined by guests including Bette Midler, Susan Sarandon, John Legend, Miranda Lambert, Joan and Melissa Rivers and more. Tim Gunn will serve as the mentor to the designers as they sew their way to Fashion Week. Aspiring designers not only have to make it work, they have to master the fine art of working with others.
