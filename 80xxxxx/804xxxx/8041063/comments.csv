Dowloaded Office 2013 x86 you uploaded and tried to activate with KMS Nano v12 [on a Windows 8 Pro which was earlier activated using KMS Nano v11.2 or something] and now after extraction nothing happens.

Do i have to activate both with same version of KMS Nano? Coz I deleted the old one when v12 became available.."

,Newb787,2013-03-27T03:31Z,I don't like these....I may just have to goto 2010 or 2017. These activators mess up my legit windows and tells me that it is not legit even though it is.
