I uploaded that torrent using that name but when I tried seeding it, my torrent client claimed I was downloading it and was ""stuck"" at 99.3 percent. I decided to create the same torrent under a ""different name"" (""The Zendradon Awakening""--which is, basically the ""subtitle"" of the program) and it seems to have been a success, since the torrent client shows that I'm ""seeding"" it! :-)"

,GoAaT999,2013-02-15T20:10Z,"Hi, Nishkap! You're welcome. :-) I've not done all of the workshops in the sense of viewing them/incorporating all the techniques. Right now, I'm working through ""Dance For Joy""--so, I have a loooong way to go! ;-) In fact, I've only been fully immersed in these teachings since August of 2012 (though, was drawn to them in 2008, or so, and 2010 with greater magnitude). The learning curve is pretty fast yet steep! :-) It depends on why you are drawn to these teachings, as to where to begin, I imagine. However, the ""easiest path"" seems to be to start at ""the beginning"" of the teachings, since each workshop builds upon the previous. The first 8 presentations, in succession, seem to be (by date as a reference): ""The Amenti Series-1 Classes"", ""Ancient Rites of Passage: Personal Healing Through Planetary Service"", ""The Evolutionary Path of Consciousness"", ""Kathara Bio-Spiritual Healing System: Level 1"", ""Beyond the Veils"", ""The Egypt Lectures: Awakening the Flame of Orion"", ""Architects of Light and Secrets of the Indigo Children"", and ""Angelic Realities: The Big Picture"". I can give a further listing of what's next after a while, if you'd like (the whole listing is pretty vast!). I'm not on ""FB"", but I can communicate, here--just as easily--it would seem (and maybe our questions/observations will help others, here, as well?). Thanks and good luck/wishes. :-)"
,GuardianAlly,2013-03-24T20:10Z,"Many thanks GoAat! I will seed as long as I have HD space... You wouldn't happen to have the Manuals for the ""Dance For..."" series would you? Or the one for the Camelot Interview?"
,GoAaT999,2013-03-26T05:32Z,"Hi, GuardianAlly! :-) Great! Thanks for seeding! Yes, I am planning to scan/make .pdfs for the ""Dance For..."" handbook as well as the Project Camelot Interview accompaniment (plus all the other various handbooks I have)! I've been slightly side-tracked, lately, but hope to get back to converting and uploading the rest of the material relatively ""soon""!"
