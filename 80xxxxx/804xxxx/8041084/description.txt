Clipstory

We all use Copy and Paste, well only about a hundred times a day! Copying and Pasting text, files and graphics is one of the most invaluable features of Windows, but the problem is that you can only copy and paste one thing at a time . What's needed is a way to copy and paste to the clipboard, and see the history; and that's why we call this application Clipstory!

Clipstory gives you a huge extension to your copy and paste abilities, you can quickly cycle through your entire history of copied text, files, images, audio and binary data. Through use of the keyboard shortcuts a preview popup is shown in the corner of your screen, and this works with any and all applications.
