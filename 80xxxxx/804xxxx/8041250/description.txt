Agatu proudly presents complete (to my knowledge at least) soundtrack to Master of Orion 2, the greatest space strategy game of its kind.

It contains: battle themes, racial (diplomacy) themes, event themes and general UI BGM by Laura Barratt.

I'm uploading this torrent because all other sources seem to have died, and Master of Orion must live on!
