,logan-x-art,2013-01-20T00:42Z,Thanks for the bit about Overtime...
,ziggyff,2013-01-20T02:22Z,yes...HBO apparently had some technical problems with Overtime and no one seems to know when or if it'll be  put out there...the rest of the show was pretty good though especially Martin Short
[T],theburningbush,2013-01-20T18:45Z,"From what I can gather from the comments at HBOs RTWBM site, not only is OT not available for on-demand viewing now, it wasn't even available for live streaming while OT was occurring.

Here are a couple relevant excerpts from that webpage:
(1) Link to OT is broken, as may viewers are noting ... so, are y'all [BM & guests] in your chairs pretending we're watching? If y'all are going through the motions, will we be able to see it on-line later?

(2) With all the money people spent on HBO, one would think Overtime streaming would work right. Someone needs to get fired right away..."
[V],MP4SUX,2013-01-20T22:04Z,"Boy, I really hate the HBO web site.
My mouse scroll wheel doesn't work.
I can't mark text.

I went snooping to see what I could find anyway.
'Community Feedback & Technical issues Forum'
has exactly two entries regarding no overtime.

But there is no response anywhere to be seen, a complete stonewall.

[T],theburningbush,2013-01-20T22:57Z,"Here's the message I sent to HBO via www.hbo.com/about/contact-us.html :

========
On your webpage at www.hbo.com/real-time-with-bill-maher is this statement regarding the Overtime segment of episode #268 of the ""Real Time with Bill Maher"" program: ""We apologize for the technical difficulties with tonight's overtime live segment. Please check back shortly for tonight's's video.""

In the context of that statement, would you please define the word ""shortly?""

Thank you.
========"
[V],MP4SUX,2013-01-21T00:33Z,"Would you please define ""you""?

You do understand that I nor anyone around here are not in any way connected with HBO?

So, I assume you are rhetorically asking *them* a question ... add my vote.

AVIGUY"
[T],theburningbush,2013-01-21T01:37Z,"Yes, AVIGUY, I prefaced the entire delimited-by-""========""-lines section with ""Here's the message I sent to HBO...""; thus, the entire delimited message was directed to HBO.

Glad we're on the same page, and, BTW, many thanks for your AVI posts...you provide a great service!"
[V],MP4SUX,2013-01-21T02:25Z,"Ahhh ... dummy me, you are correct - it's laid out to be perfectly understood, except by me when I'm not paying attention.

As for the rest, it's the abandoned XVID community that held the door open for me, I just walked through.

AVIGUY"
[T],theburningbush,2013-01-21T05:06Z,FYI to everyone: HBO has finally uploaded Overtime for the 18-Jan-2013 program.
