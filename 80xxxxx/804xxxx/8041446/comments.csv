Quality report, anyone?"
,theaetr,2013-01-20T15:15Z,"Horrible quality, don't download."
,Zagorath,2013-01-20T16:30Z,"I downloaded this guy's episode 11, the quality was AWFUL. I mean, it was amazingly bad.
It cropped the image, looked really grainy, the audio felt thin and tinny. I suspect this one is exactly the same. Don't download this, wait a few days for loadstone2k12's version, or some other high quality version.

Low quality doesn't usually bug me, but this one was especially bad, probably because of the completely unnecessary cropping."
,bob9001a,2013-01-21T15:53Z,Just another embarassing effort by the worst encoders out ther. They should just quit and save everyone from their crappy uploads.
,ScottyD7421,2013-01-26T08:55Z,"Thanks for uploading {C_P}, much appreciated.

The Video and Audio for this download are both fine and i'd rate both 8/10. Negative comments regarding blurry and heavily cropped video and low sound are false. I've downloaded a lot of {C_P}'s files in both Young Justice and Green Lantern The Animated Series and have no complaints. If you want HD download HD, otherwise be greatful someone is out there uploading Avi's.

Cheers"

Thank you very much, I just hope they keep them coming but, I'm not certain they plan to.

Great Up...Many Thanks kind friend."
