In terminal type:

sudo apt-get install csh tcsh libglw1-mesa libglw1-mesa-dev mesa-utils elfutils gamin libxp6 libxpm4 libxt6 libxp6 libxmu6 libxau6 libxinerama1 xfs xfstt ttf-liberation ttf-mscorefonts-installer xfonts-100dpi xfonts-75dpi alien

Type ""Y"" to confirm.

After installation has completed, just copy and paste the program you want to install to your home folder and type:

for i in *.rpm; do sudo alien -cv $i; done


Remember to copy one at a time if your a new user, advance user's will know how to convert this package.

And finally, Open a terminal, if not opened already and type: 

for i in *.rpm; do sudo alien -cv $i; done

Go and play some video game until it finishes converting the package.

Double click the .deb package created and let the Ubuntu software install it. Don't worry if it says the package is of bad quality, just click install.

Happy Modeling ;)"

,punksterhd,2013-04-01T06:50Z,"Here's a link to a script for Ubuntu. 

I tried this with sudo bash on terminal,  

then went to the autodesk page : https://students.autodesk.com/?nd=register_v2 

created a student account and got a free serial from there and used that on for install.

Here's the link to the script: https://truck.it/p/7lB4sH-_K3

Good Luck ;)"
