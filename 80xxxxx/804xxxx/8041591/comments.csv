THANK YOU AirKiller-I have download dozens of games on here and when it came to the Penumbra series I struggled with getting one to work. I have obviously unpacked many .rar files, and also mounted .iso, .bin, .cue  ETC But-I never had to deal with copy and pasting ""crack"" files. Other instructions on doing it  seemed simple enough but their ""crack"" file was a .exe and I could not unpack it to copy and paste-just play the little animation and song, by the ""crack"" engineers (LOL Crack engineers, I love it) -anyway-I am SO happy to not only get one that worked, but I love it that you post your Skype if anyone has problems! Thank you again! "
