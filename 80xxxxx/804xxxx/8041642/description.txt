Dubbest is a Reggae band based out bridgewater, Massachusetts.
Avoid the Pier is Dubbest's second studio album.  Seed to support the band

Nearly two and half years after our first release: Off Dubbat, we are proud to present a newly evolved sound.  Avoid the Pier was done in a home studio, eliminating outside pressures and time restraints.  That luxury ultimately taught us how to develop our ideas and create music that we are truly proud of.  Recorded with no theme in mind, the album ended up accumulating a cohesive mood tying all the songs together, with a sort of dark and psychedelic humor.
