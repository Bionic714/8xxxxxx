,Bamboodel,2013-01-25T13:38Z,"thx man, much appreciated.."
,mendocinosummit,2013-01-25T20:32Z,Can we update to 1.09 or 1.091 after we run this?
,mendocinosummit,2013-01-25T22:06Z,Never mind updating to 1.091 works.
,thordanssoa,2013-01-29T04:51Z,"okay, so I'm having a problem and would appreciate some help. I downloaded SKIDROW's torrent and both updates, and then updated to 1.091 with no issues, everything ran fine. However, after dragging both the dlc folder and the activator into the install folder and running the activator(which did crash as described) my game is unchanged. The DLC does not appear in the box in the launcher, and the game looks identical"
,thordanssoa,2013-01-29T04:55Z,"Never mind, I have just been blinded by my own foolishness. I accidentally dragged the new DLC folder inside the preexisting DLC folder. Thanks for the fantastic torrent."
,Hywell,2013-01-30T00:58Z,"Hey! I just like to thanks for this torrent. I promise that i will seed and wait for more dlc mods.

Works like a charm!

Cheers!"

,Laraza47,2013-02-19T01:54Z,When I attempt to open the activator nothing at all happens. Suggestions? 
,Laraza47,2013-02-19T01:59Z,"When I click on the activator it does nothing at all, any one have an idea on why?"
,Laraza47,2013-02-19T04:51Z,"Never mind! I had the wrong update, everything works now, thanks a ton!"
,taikuh,2013-02-21T23:23Z,What exactly does the activator exe do? I ask because I play on a Mac and am wondering if I can manually do the changes on my Mac to get the DLC to work.
,Daphoenyx,2013-05-16T23:27Z,"Can anybody help me? I've tried this several times now, and the error I always get is that the Launcher doesn't show ANY dlc... And if I click on ""Start CKII"", it will come up with an error and won't let me load the game anyway.

What I did:
- downloaded base game Crusader Kings II from Skidrow and installed it
- downloaded patch 1.092 and installed it (overwrote when prompted)
- placed the DLC folder from this download into the game directory
- placed the activator from this download into the game directory, launched it
- the game crashed, as expected
- started the game from the launcher and this is where I got the problem: no DLC at all, and the game wouldn't start anyway.

Can somebody please tell me what am I doing wrong?"
,T3st1fy,2013-05-30T08:54Z,Daphoenyx try installing skidrows version then install skidrows #2 patch then use official update (well not past 1.092 i would imagine unless you use the latest dlc torrent i uploaded then 1.10) then after that do your last 3 steps if dlc does not show up in-game use activator again may take up to several tries
