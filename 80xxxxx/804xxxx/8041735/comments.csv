,topjack2000,2013-01-23T07:44Z,"Is this for real? Are there any real seeds.  If so, how come we can not connect to them.  This is obviously a fake and should be reported as such."
,topjack2000,2013-01-23T13:49Z,"I deleted this torrent, and I downloaded the trial from adobe website, and used the dll crack and all was great."

,barak35,2013-05-09T21:29Z,"@kayser3171: your screenshots kind of shows that this is not CS6 Extended. I think if it was, it would be the title of the window, don't you?"
