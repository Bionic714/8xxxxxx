,cheetah_cheetah2,2013-01-20T17:19Z,"Thank you uploader, and thank to those russians :D
This is the latest version of AES.
There are 24 serials, all have worked for me.
I got exactly 336 credits (240+96 bonus).
I wonder how long until they got detected, blacklisted and deleted...
"
,Snjufo1,2013-01-21T13:06Z,Works perfectly...thank you so much....:)
,anchit02,2013-01-22T02:10Z,Does anyone know why it is so difficult to crack FDST products? Their new scenery and GSX? I would love to have a GSX torrent. Someone please crack that thing!

,Espana25,2013-01-23T23:18Z,"This is a good torrent and a very nice upload as well and this new AES version also amazing ,but the bitter truth we all know the upload wont last long as far as the working serials are concerned pretty much of the serials on the list are already getting blacklisted and have few have already gone.!"
,nosar77,2013-01-26T19:05Z,Work Perfectly! Thanks! 
,lantonovdelagpe,2013-02-01T23:50Z,AES 2.26 is out and all this credit is blacklisted. :(
,airbusflyer,2013-02-02T00:58Z,Yep...with 2.26 Aerosoft or Pabst done good work with blacklisting the keys. I didn't check these ones but the one I have are not working. So I got back my 2.25 with the working ones :P
,anchit02,2013-02-02T07:47Z,Could someone try these codes in 2.26 and let us know it if works.
,anchit02,2013-02-02T07:48Z,Fuck! Nevermind..
,lantonovdelagpe,2013-02-02T16:21Z,@anchit02  I already tried it. ALL the credits are blacklisted. :(
,anchit02,2013-02-03T10:44Z,"Dang it! Some needs to go through the AES programming codes and figure out how to crack this whole credit issue! In the mean time, please share 2.26 credits if you have them."
,lantonovdelagpe,2013-02-03T14:12Z,@anchit02 If I've got whate ?
,anchit02,2013-02-04T06:50Z,Credits that work in AES version 2.26.
,lantonovdelagpe,2013-02-05T02:09Z,"@anchit02 No duy, I don't have, but I want. :(
I need AES on CYUL... -_-"
,anchit02,2013-02-05T04:22Z,"Why cant anyone crack AES, or even better GSX!!"
,lantonovdelagpe,2013-02-23T23:17Z,AES 2.30 is out but I can't find any good serials.
,anchit02,2013-02-25T13:37Z,"Its pretty new, it'll be awhile for someone to come out and share. I'll be on the look out, and do share if you find some."
,fsxking08,2013-03-15T00:35Z,"anchit02: Its because of how they get their products out through the Addon Manager. You have to enter your serial through the Addon Manager and then its activated, and that makes it 100% impossible to crack. I bought FSDT's GSX and Its worth it, I use it every single time I fly, just buy the damn thing, its the only thing I ever actually paid for for FSX"
,gr8simba,2013-04-04T16:11Z,"How can i use credits to enable airports what i done i use all keys now i have 336 credits when i try to activate any airport i get this error ""Addon Scenery ""Flytampa Dubai X 2012"" not found or are not active Please install or activate in the scenery Library first"" any help new in FSX :)"
,turontado117,2013-04-22T01:06Z,"all the key works but i have a bit of a problem. it always say "" error while connecting flightsim ....... "" does anybody know how to fix it? anyway thanks for this upload"
,Trillshit17,2013-05-19T20:11Z,can some one release AES 2.30 please or Fs2crew ngx 2.3?!
