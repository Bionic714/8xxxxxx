 The texture: like "something mysterious is happening in the corner of the room" rather than a big space. A candle or 60 watts bulb is good enough rather than energy saving of high luminance LED. In the such kind of light, the sound quality that is suitable for an event which people are quietly looking forward to.

An ambiguous position like a cheap painting which someone bought at a night stall illuminated by scent light. The particular dark depth of "cheap stuff", "counterfeit" or "fake".
