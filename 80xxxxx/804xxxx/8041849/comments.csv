[V],Daman4Iife,2013-01-23T07:28Z,"no, and even if they was, its going to be a upscale since the show was not shot in film or on HD. 480p its the best its going to be. or 576p on Pal "

I miss Daman too, Moose. "
,Sketti11,2013-02-10T02:36Z,"I don't know to much about new releases and I guess the search eludes me. I have been looking every where for decent Marvel Anime torrents, but I can't find them. I don't mind file size. Only decent one I can find is Dr. Strange. Any chance you can upload?"
,AquaPigmyNinja,2013-02-11T20:57Z,"Damn, so I guess with Damon on hiatus, I might need to look elsewhere for Pt 2. of Steins;Gate. Anyone have any leads?"
,mooserocka,2013-02-14T07:14Z,ya daman is out for a while. He was sexist and hated gays which is weird in this day and age but he always put out the new stuff. it sux no one else is doing it
,AquaPigmyNinja,2013-02-15T01:03Z,"Guess I'll need to order the Steins;Gate blurays and do it myself. :P It's ok, that show is worth the money."
,spaz1123,2013-02-15T23:45Z,"Hey Daman could you possible find the time to upload Horizon in the Middle of Nowhere 2? I would appreciate it. You are my favorite anime uploader, never have had any problems, thanks for all the hard work."

,gratefullydrunk,2013-02-17T10:12Z,"@Daman

Hope to see you back on the scene soon. We love your work and are eagerly and PATIENTLY awaiting your next upload."
,Barkerboy21,2013-03-01T14:18Z,hey Daman! I 
,mooserocka,2013-03-07T00:53Z,at gratefully drunk your an idiot. Seriously. So because someone supplys us with dubs that makes him god. maybe you can suck his penis but im not. I like daman but when it comes to his ideas how he HATES  WOMEN as a main character  in ANIME and refused to put an anime up because there was two homosexual characters. I only speak the truth you idiot. Its not like i put daman down one bit. He said these things these came out of his mouth. So im not putting him down in any way we all miss him and dunno if he is even comming back. So how about you shut the hell up and actually read his posts before you label somoene a god. Daman is awesome i apreciate what he does not what he beleives in. 
,ANIMELIFE,2013-03-09T02:04Z,guy relax...gratefullydrunk only  said daman was a good free dual audio anime uploader which does not mean god so relax
,ANIMELIFE,2013-03-09T02:05Z,"BTW ARE YOU ASKING WHY DAMAN IS NOT UPLOADING ANYMORE WELL ITS BECAUSE OF UNIVERSITY scene at kat
"
,ANIMELIFE,2013-03-09T02:09Z,"still dont beleive it then go to kat  the search daman 



"
,Lost_Leaf,2013-03-11T05:50Z,"You just claimed Daman is a sexist and a homophobe. Am I right? Then you got disgruntled when gratefullydrunk defended Daman. In your defense, you say that you are only speaking the truth. No you're not."
,Lost_Leaf,2013-03-11T05:51Z,"I was there when you had this discussion with Daman. He said he doesn't like female-lead shonen [the operative word being shonen]. Had he said he doesn't like any anime with women in it simply because they're female, then that would have been sexist. He also gave his rational & personal reasons for why he doesn't like female-lead shonens, and it wasn't because they were female, but because of how the writers convey the females. Again, that isn't sexist. It has more to do with the public perception of females having to act like cliched girly-girl females, and males having to always act like an overly reinforced stereotypical view of men. Blame it on the writers if you have a problem with how they portray characters based on genders. "
,Lost_Leaf,2013-03-11T06:06Z,"Daman also never said he hated gays. You're twisting words. He said he doesn't like the Yaoi genre of anime, and he's god well damned entitled to an opinion of his preferences.  I'm sure there's genres you equally dislike. And he has every right not to upload anime that he doesn't like, it's completely up to him. Stop dictating what he should and shouldn't upload under slanderous and false accusations. "
,Daww,2013-03-12T12:02Z,"I miss your uploads, hope you come back soon. ^_^

If only we could ban some retards from downloading if all they're gonna do is spout abuse."
,ANIMELIFE,2013-03-13T12:20Z,guys stop getting too overacting .yes lostleaf its true tha moose is saying whatever word hewants .BY stereotypical you mean by words by my definition is dumb.Anyways to the main subject dont think Daman buys all of the anime I think he is mostly juust an anime encoder.wow the cost of  all the anime he uploaded is approximately around 12000USD which a hole in my pocket.So moose dont say comment someones comment and drunkguy dont reply bcause its the greatest reply.HEY if someone is trying to bring someone down just means your better than that person
,ANIMELIFE,2013-03-13T12:23Z,"Daman at university and dont have time to encode or watch anime anymore 

he,s probaply gonna change his likings to something else than anime...more likely he's gonna forget about pirate bay and probaply stop"
,ANIMELIFE,2013-03-14T02:58Z,@LostLeaf dude its the same gay/yaoi what the hell dude they are the same genre
,mooserocka,2013-03-14T03:59Z,lost leaf i DID not change his words at all. EVERY time i brought up a female anime he said he DOESNT like how females in anime are not bad ass and that was his quote. Then i said remy from black lagoon was bad ass. All his awnswers were a lil sexist he doesnt like women in anime o well thats his decision. But u cant defend the thing about gays. HE said and i qoute that anime is GAY AS SHIT i will never put it up. Then when we asked what he meant he meant ITS GAY as in men on men and he will never post because of that. So if thats not hating gays in anime i dunno what is. He refuses to post something because it has two men kissing in it means he does not like gays in anime lost leaf what did you take from that?
,indi711,2013-03-14T05:26Z,Does anyone know of a good english dub uploader? I've been searching a few torrent sites but can't seem to find anyone as good as daman! I joined BakaBT thinking I could download from there but they don't do any funimation stuff :( any suggestions would be appreciated.
,Lost_Leaf,2013-03-15T10:47Z,"Moose, he isn't being sexist. That's just how you're reading into the situation. As I said, I was there when you and Daman had these discussions, I just looked back on all of the pages for reference if you want the quotes. It's not because they're women that he dislikes them, it's because of how the women are portrayed in the anime. "
,Lost_Leaf,2013-03-15T11:19Z,"Also, Daman said ''Moose, Black lagoon is not shounen but Seinen, and Revy and rock are both main leads''. He is saying that the reason Black Lagoon is good is because it is not Shounen but Seinen, this is because he doesn't hate female-lead anime, he only dislikes female-lead shounen. Could this be because he is not sexist? And it's more to do with the portrayal of women themselves within shounen? Yes. "
,Lost_Leaf,2013-03-15T11:29Z,"Animelife. You are right, yaoi is gay anime. I never said it wasn't though. What I actually said was ''Daman never said he hated gays, he said he hated yaoi''. 

It's important to understand the fundamental difference between the two: yaoi is a genre, homosexuality itself is a sexual orientation. Daman hates a genre, not homosexual people. Hating a genre does not make you homophobic. "
,Lost_Leaf,2013-03-15T11:33Z,"indi711, try www.minitheatre.org

I've found their catalogue of content surpasses Bakabt. The only different is that it's direct download, not P2P. "
,mooserocka,2013-03-15T23:43Z,Ok and once again then i asked him to name an anime with a female lead and he said he DOESNT LIKE ANY. BUt im mostly going vs how he doesnt like gays. like i said he just doesnt like them. I dont care cause he put out anime. I loved shangri la i finally watched it but he refused to put it out cause of a female lead. When i then said it had a co lead of a male and a tranny also. He then  had nothing to say. So shangri la is not just a female lead. He was wrong. then if you were there u should kno my quotes when he hates gays was right. He said he will never post gay anime where men kiss men. OR anything releated to so yes he hates gays i dont care i dunno why ure defending him he said it straight out lol. who cares he put out anime we liked it now he stopped shyt happens.
,mooserocka,2013-03-15T23:47Z,he never said he hated a genre. HE said and i quote i will never post that GAY SHIt. So yea he obriously has something against it whyt are you defending someone who obviously doesnt like it. I honestly dont like that genre either but refusing to post it isnt right caus esome people might like it. IF you say i will never post that gay shit or that shit is GAY!!!!! that means he doesnt like it he never ever said the genre either he said and i quoted it. So stop defending it geez its ridiculous. I dont like the gay anime either if he doesnt like it its not a big deal. I just feel bad for those who do and wont get it lol. Who cares if he is sexist and hates gays. Its just how it is not a big deal i still am glad he put out anime for us ya know. 
,Lost_Leaf,2013-03-16T06:07Z,"I don't see what the problem is, Moose. You asked him to name an anime he likes with female leads? Easy. He acknowledged that he enjoys Black Lagoon. It's just that it's Seinen, not Shounen. But they're both still anime. So he has just given you a female-lead anime he enjoys. Clearly he isn't a sexist. 

He also never once said he hated gay people, he said he hated the gay genre of anime. Two completely different things! I'm a heterosexual male, do you think I'm going to watch gay porn? No. It doesn't make me homophobic though. "
,chrisluigi,2013-03-19T05:11Z,"I dearly hope you come back, Daman. You never finished Steins;Gate, and for that I am sad. Just in general, though, you are easily my favorite pirate."
,frozenville,2013-03-26T14:28Z,mr daman. did u get involve in translating animies? just curiuos.
,mooserocka,2013-03-30T01:52Z,actually no HE DID not name an anime he liked now that you brought it up. I brought up black lagoon. 
,mooserocka,2013-03-30T01:57Z,ANd saying he hated anime where two guys making out makes him utterly sick to his stomach kinda means that. Also i dont see what the big deal is i dont like watching anime with 2 guys making out either. Just ure stickin up for him without knowing what he meant at all. I know what he meant cause i feel the same way but i can watch it though. 
,Team_Alice,2013-04-01T14:27Z,"@moose 
you say you don't like the genre, yet you'll watch it? no one should have to force or be forced to do something. if he doesn't like yaoi, then he shouldn't have to upload it, plain and simple. he's was making no money from these uploads, so really you and i have no say in what he does and does not release. just let it go."
,Eruad.Zche,2013-04-12T09:06Z,"This guy has been working on some anime in HD like Damen. His torrents are really good and fairly new so not as many releases yet and seed ratios are a bit bad, but had no trouble downloading some shows.
http://www.nyaa.eu/?user=117917"
,Lost_Leaf,2013-04-14T14:48Z,"I concur with Alice. And you're beating around the bush, Moose. Who brought up who is irrelevant at this point. The point I'm making is: you propositioned Black Lagoon at Daman, attempting to throw examples of good female-lead Shounen at him, and he responded by telling you that Black Lagoon is not Shounen but in fact Seinen. Regardless of who brought it up, he still likes Black Lagoon. He just hates female-lead Shounen.. 'Shounen'. Do you understand now? It doesn't make him a sexist, as a Shouen isn't defined by its characters being exclusive to women, and so the genres he does enjoy will also have women in them, such as Black Lagoon. 

And I think you're intentionally taking Daman's words out of context for the sake of an argument. Clearly you don't feel the same way as Daman, or this argument never would have started. "
,mooserocka,2013-04-18T19:05Z,Alice once again you dunno whats going on but chime in.Im not saying what he can or cant upload. Im arguing with lost leaf cause he is DEFENDING something that daman did that cant be defended. Cause its damans opinion and its just how it is. I actually share a similar opinion i dont like watching the GAY shit as he called it either. I would if it was a good show though but i dont go looking for it. I am the first to say i love what daman puts out even tho he quit on us. Is he ok im worried about his health hes been gone a long time with no word. He could have atleast said this is my last upload see yas. We got nothing i apreciate what he did. Alice know the story before you chime in this has NOTHING to do with daman and its mostly just about lost leaf sticking up for someone that did something wrong. 
,EpicFluro,2013-04-20T14:39Z,is daman coming back at all. is there another place that does the same kinds of torrents small ish size and great quality. dual-audio
,Lost_Leaf,2013-04-27T06:24Z,"Eh? Something that Daman did, that can't be defended? 

If I may ask, Moose, why can it not be defended? And more importantly, why are you so certain you know what Daman meant? You're a person, much like me, yet your opinion on the matter is supposedly better than everyone else's. Why is that? 

You really are a contradiction. Daman isn't obliged to do anything for us; let alone let us know when he was leaving. He isn't a slave. "
,ApoPug,2013-05-05T03:45Z,"Some good new up-loaders are:

,ApoPug,2013-05-10T07:17Z,"dont listen to that retard he obviously dosnt know shit about anime because the real anime torrent site is: http://www.nyaa.eu/

Oh and here is cbw's link: http://www.nyaa.eu/?user=164725

the other sites above also have great duel audio series"
,mooserocka,2013-05-13T21:05Z,I think apo pug doest knbow waht hes talking about. Those links are to NON english. Only subs atleast thats what i got. Cbm is great they just arent on the pirate bay for some reason. They have released alot of BRAND NEW dubs that i havent even heard of yet. I used to just go in the search and type daman now i just go in the search and put cbm or lime. 
,ApoPug,2013-05-14T02:52Z,All the links I gave have duel audio torrents. moose must have down syndrome the only link i gave to subbed anime is the main websites url dumbass. maybe if you could read past the first 2 words you would see all the torrents say duel audio. learn how to navigate websites before you cry on the comments and look stupid.
,ApoPug,2013-05-14T02:55Z,and cbm is for cornbreadman and he is one of the up loaders on that website you retard.

,mooserocka,2013-05-21T00:20Z,dude your  a moron the site it took me too was for direct downloads not torrents. They were subbed not dubbed. So how about you keep my name out your mouth and just like what you like. cbm cornbread men whatever the name is. Sorry you think your so coolwow u knew the full name of cornbread men you want a cookie you jerk off. lol. I just wanted to let all the people waiting for daman to just go to any site besides this one type in cbm and you get all good anime. Instead of comming here and typing daman. Its easier to just type cbm and get anime all listed for you then go to your crap link which you cant DO anything from and it says SUB SUB SUB SUB for like 4 animes off the bat. 
,mooserocka,2013-05-21T00:22Z,moron also THE NAME OF the CATAGORY is called SUB  cmon. Sorry but my way is easier to find stuff but if people want to try your way thats cool too. Since your such a jerk off about it tho i would say just type it in. 
,mooserocka,2013-05-21T00:26Z,mr infamous thanks man your link worked good. awesome anime on there ure the man. thanks brotha man.
,Lost_Leaf,2013-05-24T09:04Z,"You're just a little but of an idiot, aren't you, Moose? Just a little bit. 

Unless you lack that head meat between most people's ears, that which enables common-sense and rational thinking, you would have noticed that Nyaa is a torrent site—much more comprehensive than KickAss! Nyaa specialises solely in anime of subbed, dubbed, and, yes, even dual-audio. Learn to open your eyes. 

KickAss is great, but it's nowhere near as diverse when it comes to its pickings in anime. KickAss is like a general store: it gives you a basic spread of each category. No more, no less. "
,ApoPug,2013-05-24T21:33Z,"Thanks lost its glad to see someone with a brain for once.

moose is such a retard he dosnt know how to navigate torrent sites im surprised he hasnt gotten caught by the FCC yet.

Btw moose you just look like a fucking retard when you wine and cry and have no idea what your talking about. Cbm is an uploaded-er on Nyaa and its all in the subbed category but if you read past 3 lines you will see the file name says duel audio. If you really like anime you would know about Nyaa anyway.

Everyone is tired of your poser ass moose learn how the inter-webs work before looking stupid."
,vashterbation,2013-05-24T23:12Z,"Thanks ApoPug and anyone else that has left some dual-audio links here.

@Lost_Leaf. You recomended www.minitheatre.org on a post back around march, hows the quality of anime there?

@moosefaggot. Your a retarded little pre pube maggot troll.
Try more input on a torrents contents and less input of your piss pathetic personal opinion, the comments here are about 40% Moosetears."
,Lost_Leaf,2013-05-25T17:02Z,"I tend to alternate between avenues: minitheatre is great in its own right, but from memory, it is direct download. Which isn't for everyone. But the file sizes often tend to be smaller, for people with low or limited bandwidths. 

Bakabt.me is another great sign-up site. Unlike minitheatre, it tends to have higher quality anime, but they don't upload Funimation content. 

Nyaa is pretty much an open, wild field of wilderness: you'll never be sure what you'll come across, as it has just about anything you can imagine. Sign-up isn't mandatory either. 

At the moment CBM is uploading a classic series, Monster, which is making the rounds all over various torrent indexes. If you're into psychological suspense, very worthwhile. 

If all else fails and a particular anime to your inkling can't be found on any of the above, then KickAss is a nice last alternative. "
,vashterbation,2013-05-25T20:57Z,"haha i knew of bakabt and nyaa >.< but thanks regardless.
I will try minitheatre for their funi content."
,mooserocka,2013-05-30T18:21Z,I just think its funny how dumb you guys are. yes im allowed an opinion. And lost leaf your a god damn moron. Always getting invoved when no one asks you too. Yes i know the cbm link was to dub but the other link WHICH IS WHAT I WAS TALKING too that apo im a jerkoff and live in my moms basement  had to say was not. IT was subs and all this other crap. So it was not a dub link. geez the site was down when i tried to write all of this last time and im not doing it again so ill try and keep it short. apo pug who the hell cares about navigating you moron. You posted a link that u said was too something and it wasnt thats it theres nothing else. I like just typing cbm and getting what anime i like. Just like when daman was active i typed daman and there is everything he posts. Its not brain surgury u shoulda been swallowed prick. lol. WOW. Sorry if i prefer typing a word clicking then it downloads VERY EASY i just want it in enlish and cbm has been. vashter get off apos dick how about that why dont u suck im off all i gotta say to u. Lost leaf seriously thoug you are really annoying always acting like your high and mighty and you know what your talking about you dont cause the issue i had was that the link he posted was not DUBS. THE cbm one was but the one on top of it was not. So why dont u stop butting in when you have no clu whats going on.
,mooserocka,2013-05-30T18:27Z,Also lost leaf this is what i wanted to say actually before i red jerk off boys comments. I never really said pirate bay sucks go to kick ass torent. I actualy dont like kick ass at all. Just cbm is not on pirate bay like dman isnt on kick ass. If cbm was on pirate bay of course i would go here. I only prefer those 2 sites because there is a comment section to know what your downloading other torrent sites dont ahve a comment section. So before you rambled on about how kick ass torrent is horrible i agree and dont care for neither. I actualy go to the torrent searh engine which directs me to other sites and i type cbm or daman. IF anyone knows any other names that i can type it will be helpful. Just dont post horrible links cause i wont watch subs. 
,mooserocka,2013-05-30T18:42Z,Also does anyone know any NYAA people that have been doing one peice english uploade. from episode 100 on. IF someone could post a link to that it would be very nice since my normal way only works with newer dvd anime not long series like one peice.
,Lost_Leaf,2013-05-31T10:31Z,"Oi, shit-for-brains! Yeah, that's right, I'm talking to you, Moose. It's apparent to everybody here that you're suffering from delusions of incurable grandeur. I haven't quite decided whether I should class you as a B-grade troll, or just the village idiot who burnt his own village down by mistake. Unfortunately you've come to TPB at an inconvenient time; we've just passed legislation, and won't be taking in any more refugees from an inbred land in a faraway place.

I grow weary from having to break down seemingly simply things as if they're perplexingly vexing—you're not a five-year old, just a man with donkey fat stuffed in his cranium. 

So I'll explain this one last time: Nyaa is an anime torrent index with subbed, dubbed, and dual-audio. You need only to look on there for five minutes before figuring that out. So don't whine that they're only subbed, you clumsy baboon. Just to get this clear, Nyaa is the link Apo posted i.e. you're wrong again, Moose. 

"
,Lost_Leaf,2013-05-31T12:33Z,"Cornbreadman is actually from Bakabt, but he uploads to other torrent indexes shortly after. And Daman is actually on KickAss. He's just currently inactive. 

Search Daman4life on KickAss, he's there. 

One last thing: where did you actually get the idea that I said KickAss is horrible? When I clearly said ''KickAss is great, but it's nowhere near as diverse when it comes to its pickings in anime''. Your mind is sordid and vile, please don't ever procreate. "
,ApoPug,2013-06-01T02:24Z,"moose you 5 year old retarded baby cant you read for 2 seconds i said its an anime torrent site you fucking dumb shit. All the links i posted have duel audio anime except the one to the main website. Do you come on tpb to just sound like a retard or do you really have no other friends??? Try reading for at-least 2 seconds before nerd raging on here where obv. no one likes you. The only reason lost is saying anything is cuz your so fucking stupid you couldn't find your head if it was in your ass. 

Once piece just started getting re-dubbed by Adult Swim and if you watch the English dubs before 230 or whenever adult swim took over the dub, you will miss all the good stuff because Disney fucked it up and cut all the ""bad"" parts out of it. So my suggestion if you can read moose and i know its hard for you, watch one piece subbed."
,Bharberry,2013-06-01T05:47Z,"If any of you guys could seed for a day or two that'd be great. Whether you have something against Daman or not, I'll take this torrent and could use some help downloading it. Thanks!"
,mooserocka,2013-06-01T21:51Z,dope
,mooserocka,2013-06-01T21:51Z,ok lost leaf once again no one asked  you to break anything down. No one had any problem there was nothing to be explained. Since daman your hero doesnt post anymore i told everyone here to write cbm in the search for new anime. THAT IS IT. then this idiot gave 2 links.  
,mooserocka,2013-06-01T21:52Z,The link he gave to cbm worked but its exactly the same anime that pops up when i write it in. The other link i said WAS NOT dub it was a bunch of subs and other stuff. THATS IT. you moron. There is nothing to get involved with. If the jerk face apo pug shoulda been swallowed instead wasnt making insults there would have been no responces. 
,mooserocka,2013-06-01T21:53Z,All i wanted to do was help the people waiting for daman to come back geez. YOUR morons. Make something outta nothing. 
,mooserocka,2013-06-01T21:55Z,and for the last guy that posted. Im seeding now. I usualy only seed 7 things at a time so it doesnt slow my downloads. I got ya though. no problem.
,mooserocka,2013-06-01T22:00Z,one more thing apo shoulda been swallowed. I DONT watch subed anime. I dont like to READ my anime. IF you do that get a manga. I cant stand reading anime with high pitched japaneese noises in the backround it bothers me worst then you do

,ApoPug,2013-06-02T08:09Z,"moose its obvious here you have no friends. And no one commenting here likes you. 

Maybe you should start paying attention more in school. But i guess its hard to focus when your mom is strutting here stuff right in-front of you huh? 

When you learn how to find dubbed anime like someone with half a brain ill talk to you again. Till then go play in traffic.

Oh and here is a cool anime: http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/6185125/Initial_D__1st__2nd__3rd____4th_Stages_%28Dual-Audio%29

It is in the 5th stage right now but its subbed so dont bother looking moose."
,ApoPug,2013-06-02T10:16Z,"And to further prove you dont understand the English language I said, Nyaa is a anime torrent site and I gave the link: http://www.nyaa.eu/

I didnt say they were English dubbed did I?

Then I gave a list of duel audio torrents:

,Lost_Leaf,2013-06-02T10:37Z,"Apo called you a retard because he was tired of your constant and unnecessary slander towards Daman. You didn't get a series you wanted from Daman, so you threw a tantrum. 

Quotes from Moose:

''the site it took me too was for direct downloads not torrents. They were subbed not dubbed''.

Apo posted links to only Nyaa, which is a torrent index for anime, so you must have been smoking some heavy shit to not actually see torrents. 

''Its easier to just type cbm and get anime all listed for you than go to your crap link which you cant DO anything from and it says SUB SUB SUB SUB''.

Actually, as we've already said time and time again, Nyaa is subbed, dubbed, & dual-audio AND it has CBM content. 

''the issue i had was that the link he [Apo] posted was not DUBS''.

Apo originally actually gave three different links to the same torrent index on Nyaa. All of them were either subbed, dubbed, or both.

It's not hard to appear high and mighty when a man stands before a donkey. The contrast between intelligence and stupidity is a distinct one. It seems like when everyone is against you, them sucking on someone else's dick is a logical explanation as to why within your head. No wonder nobody takes you seriously. "
