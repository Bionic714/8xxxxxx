[V],MP4SUX,2013-01-20T18:32Z,"Looked closely, not seeing it.
Took reference png from each that show detail along the bottom.
Please refer to the following bayimg codes:

Fringe.S05E12.(23.06.351).png
This shows a license plate, the focus of the shot is on the driver,
but the ""JGN 342"" is clearly legible - no blur whatsoever.

kaILAAAEM
Fringe.S05E13.(21.20.823).png
This shows Walter picking up a box of cannisters,
""BIOHAZARD"" is clearly legible - no blur whatsoever.

I am open to receive legitimate complaints, but you're going to have to be specific.

,genocide44,2013-01-21T03:10Z,"what I said was a legitimate complaint there was a blur coming from the bottom of the screen in each episode how much specific is that,had to download from another source."
[V],MP4SUX,2013-01-21T05:38Z,"I'm sorry, but you're not making sense. What does ""coming from the bottom of the screen"" mean?

At what time in which video and what does this blur look like?

I can't honestly respond until I can find it. You led me to believe you'd seen blur along the bottom of the screen ('coming from' is new) and I looked, showed an example and cannot find it.

I'm not saying it's not there, but if you can't point it out and nobody else seems willing to chime in and back you up, what am I to do?
