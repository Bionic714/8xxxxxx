This is the complete 3-CD set for Video Professor's Learn HTML in .iso format. 

Burn this to a CD or mount it virtually and then run the icon.exe or vidprof.exe file.

You'll know it's working when you begin to hear the proto-dubstep. Press 'Continue' to skip the introduction where he tries to convince you to install shovelware.

Seed, comment, and enjoy.
