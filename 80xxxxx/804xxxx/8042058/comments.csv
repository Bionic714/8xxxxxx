2012/2013

Duration: 1 hour, 20 minutes

Gary Lineker introduces the best of the action and reaction from the day's seven Premier League matches.

There is a London derby at Upton Park, where West Ham host QPR. Rangers' manager Harry Redknapp enjoyed a successful seven-year stint as Hammers boss but will be desperate to get one over on his former side, with his new charges lying in relegation trouble.

In the Midlands, there is a derby between West Brom and Aston Villa. The Villans may have struggled in the league this season but this match comes just days before the crucial second leg of their League Cup semi-final against Bradford.

Elsewhere, champions Manchester City take on Fulham, Liverpool face Norwich, Newcastle play Reading, Swansea host Stoke and Sunderland travel to Wigan."
