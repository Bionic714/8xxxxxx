What exactly is the difference between Party Hardcore and Hardcore Party?? Have a nice day my favorite uploader:)"

Around 2007-2008 Party Hardcore was a very successful website, so much so, that another company decided to use the idea and record a few parties of their own using some of the strippers from the original Party Hardcore site. A smaller nightclub was used and the usual mix of amateur and pro girls remained. Four “parties” were made and released on DVD in Europe, they were also put up on the adult-x website as a “pay per view” video. I'm guessing they were not too successful or Party Hardcore stepped in and stopped their guys performing,  as no more parties were made and eventually the copyright to the parties were sold on to the Extreme CFNM website as bonus content to the usual “Loverboys” material that they usually showed.  That might not be 100% accurate, but I think it is a general idea of the difference."
