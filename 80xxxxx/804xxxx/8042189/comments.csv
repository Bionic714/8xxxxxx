,sagesagesage,2013-01-20T22:45Z,You can always tell by the movie poster if it's gonna be complete shit. This is a good example.
,bilper,2013-01-21T00:06Z,There isn't a trash can big enough to contain this rubbish.
,snowbirds,2013-01-21T01:27Z,"It is a fun game to try to guess how low the IMDB score is going to be for movies like this.  

I guessed it would be in the 4's.  

I was wrong.  Lower."

,highlander888,2013-01-21T06:40Z,The 22 reviews are all glowing for this movie though.
,snakeroom,2013-01-21T21:06Z,"up to 84 reviews, down to 2.6....
seems like a perfect 'get the fuck out of my house or you'll have to sit through this whole movie' kind of movie......as soon as your ready for the party to be over, you pop that bad boy in and watch em scurry like cockroaches "
,injun_mojo,2013-01-22T07:56Z,looks like a winner. how the frack can it have so many seeders....
,butters72,2013-01-22T18:06Z,"A/V 9/9
Movie- they came so close to a good B-move but so far too. The lead protagonist was so bad that I think my dog would be a better actor. the writer did a nice job but everything from editing on just fails to meet the standard.  "
,killermany,2013-01-24T00:19Z,pay me and I will watch that terrible movie  o/ 
,1battyboy,2013-02-02T14:39Z,BEST MOVIE IN THE WORLD
