Darlinghurst Road is a journey through the streets of a red light district after dark. It is the true story of a strange, parallel universe filled with sex, drugs, criminals and violence. Gritty, disturbing and written without compromise; Darlinghurst Road is a book that will stay with you long after you have put it down.

The setting is Australia and Darlinghurst Road is the main street of a place in Sydney called Kings Cross. A seedy area of only a few square miles where hookers haunt the alleys and organized crime rules, it is also the place, where the Author lived the chapters of this book. Read the book, take the journey and experience this rare opportunity to peer through the murky window into a world that most people will never see.
