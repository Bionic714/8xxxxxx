Product Description
From upscale ballrooms to roadside juke joints, people have been dancing close for decades. Blues dancing opens up a new world of partnered expression, a connection between two people. The music that drives both the dance and the feeling is pure American Blues dating from the early 1900s to the present, full of call and response and emotional intensity. From the early blues of the Mississippi Delta and Texas to electric Chicago blues, this rich musical style covers a variety of tempos and emotions, and runs the range of the human experience. Blues is a challenging dance to learn simply by watching, as many of its moves and stylings are subtle. This video shows in depth and clear detail how two can move as one, as well as how to structure a dance to connect you to your partner and the music in ways you never thought possible.
