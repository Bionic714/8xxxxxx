Every swing video I could get my hands on.
Made by amazing teachers. Go out a buy the video, or better yet, sign up for their workshops! The video is no substitute for a community!

Videos on everything from East Coast Jitter bug, Charleston and Lindy Hop, complete with stylization and aerials, to West Coast Swing. Blues too!

Love and Share, get out and dance:)
