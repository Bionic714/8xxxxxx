They go as far as to boo. People talk shit on Americans, but if you watch -- the UFC events in the states are the only ones where fighters from ANYWHERE get cheered when they perform well. Canadians are pretty good about this too, as long as GPS isn't fighting."
,mikedongs,2013-01-21T00:24Z,"uh, i meant GSP... not GPS."
,kjhgviyvoiyoi,2013-01-21T02:55Z,"mikedongs Are you joking?
I think people around the world are quite agreed that the audience in the U.S. is quite unbearable. How many times have we heard joe rogan ask the audience in the United States to show a little respect for the guys who have just given everything?
You boo at fair winners like if they won by kicking the opponents balls.
I haven't seen this event yet, but if it is like you say, maybe the Brasilians just want you to notice how fucked it is too boo a fair winner. And I guess you got the point.
By the way I'm European, and I like many fighters from around the world, not just from my country."
[V],SecTPB,2013-01-21T04:00Z,"Brasilians do have a more one-sided opinion on who they boo and cheer for, but if it's a great fight they keep their boos to themselves mostly. In the US, even if you put on a great fight or tried your hardest, you get no respect and still boo'd. JDS vs. Velasquez 2 for example... I felt SO bad for JDS at the end of that fight, man. That was terrible. Crowd should have been ashamed of themselves. It was a mostly all Mexican crowd, but still. JDS is a hero, man. "
