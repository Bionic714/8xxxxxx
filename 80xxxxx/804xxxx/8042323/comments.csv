,MusicTime,2013-01-20T23:27Z,"@.Leto.:  Then just get the standard version: http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8042450/Craig.Ferguson.2013.01.18.Carrie.Fisher.HDTV.XviD-AFG

Personally, Craig Ferguson is one of my favorite shows and I prefer watching it in the best quality that is out there.  

Thanks sceneline for continuing to put out great quality rips of this show."

and I'm a fan of Ferguson too, he's by far my favorite talk-show host, but I REALLY don't see the point of watching people talking in high-res..."
