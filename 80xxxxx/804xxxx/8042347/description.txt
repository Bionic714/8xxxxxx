The second tutorial on writing and producing dance music. 

This course focuses on writing, engineering and producing a trance track.
 
Starting with a blank sequencer, the 3 hour video course is designed to be used in conjunction with the Dance Music Manual (first or second edition) and follows Phiadra through the construction and programming of the trance track "Sunset". It shows how the theory of the book can be applied into practice.

The recording software was left running throughout the entire construction and production of the track and was later edited down to the most pertinant points filling three hours to fit onto the DVD.
 
Split into easy to understand sessions, the DVD covers the construction and production used to create Sunset including the inital starting point of getting the ideas down, through to how to approach the synth programming, application of effects, processing and finally arrangement to create the complete track.
