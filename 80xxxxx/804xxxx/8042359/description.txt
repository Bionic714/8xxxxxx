But one night in May, 2007, one resident discovered a bizarre creature about 19 inches tall that didn't resemble any known animal in the world: A pink, 
mostly hairless creature with large luminous eyes.
Although a picture of the creature exists, many believe it's all just an elaborate hoax, while others are sure this is proof of alien life.
