,ransit,2013-01-20T08:09Z,Once A Better Version Is Released I Will Upload ASAP.

,jarryd988,2013-01-20T08:57Z,"thanks 4 the upload, can you put up anymore films"
,SL1DE,2013-01-20T10:15Z,"This is unwatchable. :| 

Seriously, it has been over a week and THIS is the only CAM of this movie, what the fudge is going on? Usually a big movie like this would have like 50 different CAM's by now."
,lanebob13,2013-01-20T12:33Z,big movie ?
,tariq6,2013-01-20T14:59Z,FOR REAL MAN TAKE THIS UPLOAD OFF 
,capnsparrow23,2013-01-20T19:52Z,Thank you for the upload people who dont read the description should shut up. You will get your skull if you keep uploading then there will be no questions whether it is fake or not. Keep on sir. Your efforts are appreciated!
,AlphaYang,2013-01-20T23:18Z,"Video and audio ratings from ransit are pretty apt for this release. Thanks for the upload though.

v - 2
a - 4

In retrospect, if I, or anyone for that matter, want to see the movie that badly, it'd be best to just go to the theater and pay."
,ScottyD7421,2013-01-21T01:07Z,"Whilst i'm always appreciative of those people who upload, and at the risk of being ragged on by individuals who post negative and rude comments simply to ""cyber-argue"" with other people, why would you (@ransit) upload something which is by your own opinion almost un-watchable? This type of upload serves no purpose other then bragging rights for the uploader and clogging up the bay. Don't get me wrong, i'm not complaining about the quality of the upload i just don't see the point of uploading in the first place. "
,spina27,2013-01-21T01:47Z,"OMG thanks for tryin but it was truly unwatchable. I cant believe there has been NO uploads lately like Ganster squad, The guilt trip, Mama, Texas chain saw, Fun size, Chasing maverics..... can't anyone get movies to upload PLease!!!!! This is sup to be a great movie and this is the only copy out??? Thats CRAZY!"
,huckleberry40,2013-01-21T08:34Z,"Thanks for trying dude, and giving everyone fore warning on the quality of this (something) movie!!!! But again thanks!!!"
,DebiG,2013-01-21T16:18Z,Why are you all giving links to sites that you have to open a paying account to watch the movie. I might as well pay to watch at the theater.
,DebiG,2013-01-21T16:19Z,Why are you all giving links to sites that you have to open a paying account to watch the movie. I might as well pay to watch at the theater.
,WhoreWithNoMoney,2013-01-21T17:22Z,"It might be a bad cam but f**ck it it's free so please stop the BS,just thank the uploader."
,rollacansada,2013-01-21T21:26Z,PURE SHIT UNWATCHABLE!!!!
,dadiorick1,2013-01-22T09:20Z,Thanks for the up but i'll wait
,nycmon,2013-01-22T17:25Z,"thanks for the upload and the warning ransit lmao...watched a few mins and deleted it cuz it's pretty bad. I'll wait for you to up a better copy once better sources get released.
