Artist: Duo Sladko Medeno
Bulgarian Folk Songs
Complete Discography [Wav Edition] Remastered

Folklore in the form of music has strong messages from the past of a nation.Each generation of musicians give their interpretation and broadcasting in this area. Duo "Sweet Honey" in their own specific style makes the transformation of the tunes coming from the history and the texts - to sound like an intelligent game and fluidity of the subconscious. Pleasure is that - to feel the spirit of
tradition combined with modern range of feelings. I wish pleasant listening to submitted discography.
