Yes. Mislabeled.

,trace535,2013-01-21T00:31Z,"Man.. SNL is getting dumber and worse with every season.

What happened to the show that gave us great sketches like celebrity jeopardy?..."
,res19,2013-01-21T02:57Z,"Agreed, this one is terrible. Check out Saturday Night Live S38E06 with Louis C K if you want to watch a good SNL."
,Death2Dipshits,2013-01-21T03:17Z,"Celebrity Jep fucking sucked. Just because YOU aren't relevant anymore, doesn't mean the jokes are too. You fucking moron."
,funseeker521,2013-01-21T08:41Z,"Yeah, I don't think JL is going to become comedienne. I also liked the Louis CK one and Bruno Mars was amazing. What a talented kid. I had never heard of him but he is going to be huge."
