Activates VL version:

Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8 (except Professional + WMC) | Office 2010 | 2013 

Local KMS server to activate Windows 7, Windows 8 Professional and Enterprise versions and Office 2010, Office 2013. The ability to use a stick. KMSmicro v3.11 contains a built-in tool to cheat meter activation (with offline MDL). Cheat meter is inside KMSmicro and has no effect on the activated computer. Contains directly the KMS and set cmd and reg-files to help in activation. To work on the project was joined by experts from the MDL forum. They are good programmers, and constantly improve the code of their programs. Feel free to use them in their work with the server..
