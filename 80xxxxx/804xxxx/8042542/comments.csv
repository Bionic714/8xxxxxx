This is not some production of a filthy rich corporation but a documentary financed by us and made for us and our friends/family/peers/coworkers. In time, as short as possible, it will also be on tv. Please do not pirate it.

Producers of this documentary are absolutely ok with people watching the movie with a broad group of friends etc so instead of just downloading it from here, please all pitch in 1-2$ each and keep it off p2p networks.

Again, this is not the case of ""I've made a movie for moneys, it's called Spiderman of Doom 15, so if you find it kewl enough, gief money plox kthxbai"". We all want it to be a success (since you are interested in watching it, ""we"" includes also you personally) and we are hampering it by sharing it here.

,mdcore,2013-01-21T10:13Z,"Quote from John de Lancie concerning pirating and funding:

Dear Contributors,

At long last the documentary is finished. It was made possible by your generous contributions and the work of many professionals. When we first started, we were asked by many a concerned Brony if their parents, friends, and loved ones would find the documentary appropriate for viewing. Most emphatically, yes. As promised, the film is respectful, insightful and entertaining -- we present it to you with love.
Now, to a more down-to-earth matter: Please enjoy the documentary with family and friends but, please, do not upload the documentary to the Internet (YouTube, etc.). Why? Let me explain.
When we first had the idea of a Brony document ary, it was budgeted at $60,000. We figured two days of shooting with two cameras, followed by six weeks of editing. However, when the response to the Kickstarter campaign resulted in five times the original goal, Mike and I felt duty bound to expand the scope of the show. Immediately, this translated into four more cameras at the convention site in New Jersey. It also meant including four additional cities in the United States as well as traveling to Israel, Germany, Holland, and England. Of course, with this major expansion, we were now dealing with hundreds of additional hours of raw footage that necessitated the need to hire yet more editors, sound engineers and video engineers. And this is just the tip of the iceberg.
As is customary in the film business, one tries to defer salaries so that all the money is put on the screen. Of course airlines, hotels, restaurants, camera operators, sound techs, video and audio post houses do not defer their costs. Neither do lawyers or insurance companies. These people are paid up front. The people who traditionally defer their salaries are the writer, the director and the producers. There are six of us who have worked on this film for over eight months with the hope that our efforts would be recompensed AFTER the film is released. Mike, in particular, has worked an extraordinary twelve hours a day, every day for the entire eight months. This is why I’m asking that you not upload the film to the Internet. If someone, other than yourself and close friends, would like to see the documentary please direct them to www.BronyDoc.com (or directly at our online distributor, www.scrnland.com). It’s a modest amount to pay and it would be greatly appreciated. Also, while we are on the subject of the Internet (YouTube in particular), we want to take this film to the next step in distribution because we think the Brony message needs to be experienced by the general public and not just Bronies. However, for festivals and film distributors to take the film seriously and to give it a wider viewership, the documentary cannot have been available on sites like YouTube.

Please honor our request.

Thank you,
John de Lancie"

""The documentary got PREPAID and all expenses were covered by the community before the work on it began.  Now they are trying to get some extra cash out of it.""

No.  At this scale, you don't ""prepay"" an entire film.  A lot of the production salaries are deferred so more money can go into other aspects of the film to make it the best possible.  The deferred salaries are made up for by money earned from purchases after the film is finished."
,xobust,2013-01-21T16:28Z,"you think that just because you pirate something you won't buy it. well i'm going to tell you something, that is wrong. allot of studies show that p2p users buy more movies and music so uploading the documentary here is actually a good thing. 
There are many reasons to pirate one being that you simply don't have money at the moment. Then if you like the movie you could go and buy it later."

,Hamtaro88,2013-03-06T19:56Z,"Okay for all the people whining that this is hurting the brony community, get your head out of your ass. The people who created this film did not do so to get people to ""understand"" the brony community. They did it to make a profit. They have a 0 investment in this film. They got other people to pay for it with no strings attached, it's not like these independent film makers went and spent money out of their own pocket and people are ripping them off. No, they had free money handed to them that they were not obligated to pay back so long as they made the film. The fact that they feel entitled to ALSO receive a profit is pathetic. And now they are trying to guilt trip everyone into feeling bad when they are literally out nothing? And before you believe that horseshit of them putting up their own money that they are blowing out, I suggest you take a moment to think. They were given over FIVE TIMES what they expected for this film during the kickstarter. That means they had 5 times what they thought they needed. If they couldn't manage that money better, that's their own damn fault. Not to mention they have not submitted any kind of proof that they are out anything.

Also if you are still on that ideology that this was made to give outsiders a perspective on the brony community, consider this: how many regular people will actually PAY to see a movie about a fanbase of men who like a girl's cartoon? Not many. The only people who will see it are bronies and the people they force to sit through it. No one is going to shell out $25 to learn about a fanbase that they previously did not give a damn about. The only way they would see it is if bronies loaned them the DVD, which is letting them watch it for free ANYWAYS. If they REALLY wanted to make it be seen by as many as possible it would have been put on the internet for free in the first place. I can promise you that if you offer it for free a LOT more people will actually sit down and watch it.

Well played Mr. DeLancie, you fooled the brony community to try and turn a quick buck. Too bad some of us are not sheep that worship all that is ponies."

,wolf.ger,2013-03-11T19:04Z,"@Hamtaro88 That is not how kickstarter works! The Kickstarter goal doesn't describe how much money you need to do what you want to do, but how much money you need to make the absolute minimum of what you would like to achieve deliverable. Everything you get beyond that doesn't go towards your Ferrari, but into making your project a lot better.

Compared to the original ""minimum plans"", this documentary is so much better. Still, five times the money they asked for can't possibly pay for all this.

And then there is the bonus content, of which the whole idea is that it can't be produced with the kickstarter money, so it is delivered later with the money from the sales.

There are legimate reasons to get the torrent, but if you can pay for it, don't be a dick and pay. And yes, if you own a 700$ computer can pay 12.99$ for a movie. Don't try to tell me otherwise."
,VeKTeReX,2013-03-15T16:07Z,"I may be a bit confused, is this seriously a whole documentary about people who like the toy ""My Little Pony""?"
,Hamtaro88,2013-03-16T15:39Z,"@wolf.ger: Are you retarded? Like seriously. I want to know if you are retarded. I want to believe that there is a reason for how much stupid is leaving your fingertips and being placed upon the computer screen other than you are just stupid. At least if you are mentally retarded I will feel better about how  dumb you sound right now.

Let me explain to you the reasons why you are stupid:

1. You don't fucking ask for money to make a project if that money won't cover it. That's like asking for people for money to make a cake, but you only ask for enough to cover the frosting. You've already promised the people the cake, you have to present it now. Literally if the minimum was a FIFTH of what they were asking, there was NO reason that ANY money should have come out of their own pocket. Adding nice little extra things is nice and all, but finish the BASE product first. That's like if Blizzard spent their budget on designing half of Starcraft, then half on designing the expansion, leaving both games only half finished. You finish the base product before you start spending on expansions, that's just common logic.

2. You don't get it do you? Let me spell it out for you: this film was made by donations. Donations. That is free money. Money you do not need to pay back. They are out NOTHING. The film was 100% funded by donations. To make a profit off of a donation funded film is quite a dick thing to do. It's a 100% profit return with no investment, and it is heavily frowned upon in the business world. A business is about investment returning profit. If you are returning profit off of NOTHING then you are literally just scamming people. Literally what they did is had bronies pay for the expenses, then collected the profit. The only reason they got away with it was because they can class it as ""donations"" and are not required to return to their investors that way. It's a business loophole used by only the greatest of slime balls. It is a cheap trick to make maximum profit, and I for one am glad they were stopped before they made a killing off of this fanbase who is apparently too stupid to realize when they are getting fleeced.

3. I am not paying for it not because I cannot afford it. I am not paying for it because they do not DESERVE to be paid. They made this documentary under false pretenses and those pretenses have been realized now. I will not pay for a product that claims it's meant for one thing when it's clearly not meant for what that claim states. In this case it ""claims"" that it was made to give a perspective on bronies and teach the world about their culture (a laughable goal at that even. As there is hardly much to really teach people beyond ""boys like girl's cartoon. Apparently a big deal.""). When in actuality it was made for one singular purpose: to fool exploit bronies for a profit. The evidence is clear as their statements and actions about this film are hypocritical.
