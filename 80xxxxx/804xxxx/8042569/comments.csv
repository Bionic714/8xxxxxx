,dragonbandit314,2013-01-20T22:37Z,"Hi 80z, 60 is such a well rounded number.
Many thanks for all your efforts.
As always I will seed to WAY beyond 10:1.
Another +1 from me.
Be well."

,nonsentence,2013-01-21T14:53Z,"Your legendary compilations rock on!  You are quite right, 59 is an awkward number!  Thank you so much.  My wife is stuck in China because of visa issue, and she loves the music I send her via your compilations.  Much love!"
,tkm0718,2013-01-22T02:11Z,"Soooo awesome!  I hope 60 is not the last of this amazing series!  ;)

You rock!!"
[V],80zforever,2013-01-22T06:54Z,"nonsentence, that's so sweet. For now until she gets the visa, I suggest you ride with a blonde chick (WINK) while listening to the tunes hahahaha

tkm0718, I think this is the last one, not 100% positive but again it appears that way."
,nonsentence,2013-01-23T23:44Z,"80z: I won't tell her.  Hell knows no fury like a woman's wrath, as they say!  "
,digitalpress,2013-01-24T14:23Z,"WOOOO! New classics! Thanks as always for posting these up, can't wait to dig in. *seeding*"
,Giallokiller,2013-01-24T19:01Z,I'd say that number 100 sounds so much better than 60! ;)
,oldschool80s,2013-05-15T01:35Z,Hey 80z - wish you'd post some new 80s stuff!  Any chance you'd have some Whirling Dervishes or Richard Mazda?
