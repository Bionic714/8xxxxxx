Preaching The Blues is a live album recorded by the blues rock band Fleetwood Mac, released in October 2011 through Secret Records. The recording is taken from a live concert that the band played on 10 February 1971 and includes Jeremy Spencer and Danny Kirwan, both on guitars and vocals, as well as the newly initiated Christine McVie on piano and vocals. There is a strong possibility that this is a recording of the last show to feature Jeremy Spencer before his departure from the band.
