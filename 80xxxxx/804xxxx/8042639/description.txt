Game information:
=================

There are many medieval fantasy titles πâ╗but none like the innovative Once 
Upon A Knight. Set within a world of treachery, nobility and milk (yes 
milk), Once Upon A Knight delivers powerful gameplay πâ╗while never taking 
itself too seriously. It features extensive play with a comprehensive 
real-time strategy mode and exciting RPG modes. Throughout, Once Upon A 
Knight mixes hardcore depth and detail with a clever, tongue-in-cheek 
sensibility that appeals to a broad range of gamers. Forget what you know 
about fantasy titles πâ╗this one offers a milk-based economy, mothers-in-
law, flying witches and secretive knights named Floyd. Whether players 
select RTS, RPG or both, they'll find themselves in a brilliantly rendered 
setting, battling evil, saving damselsπâ╗and generally being noble and 
just.
