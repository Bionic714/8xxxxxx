Game information:
=================

Many years ago in the land of Flanaess, an evil demoness founded a cult 
dedicated to elemental evil, the four elements as symbols of true evil, 
and based it in a temple outside the village of Nulb. Eventually, after 
years of tyranny and chaos, the good armies of the nearby lands, headed by 
the infamous Circle of Eight descended into the temple and razed it, 
imprisoning the villains inside. For years thereafter relative peace 
ensued, as daring adventurers slew the remaining monsters that ravaged the 
land above and the temple itself faded into but a distant memory...until 
now

Bandits have begun to patrol the roads outside Hommlet and Nulb again. 
Wicked forces are rumored to be afoot, converging on the ruined temple for 
malevolent purposes. Who and what these men are, no one can be sure. All 
claim to be bent on slaying monsters and bringing peace and security to 
Hommlet; but deeds speak more loudly than words, and lies cloak the true 
purposes of the malevolent. 

So begins the classic Gygax D&D module, The Temple of Elemental Evilπâ╗ 
brought to the PC for the first time with 3.5 Edition rules by Troika 
Games. A game like no other; where players will assemble a party of 
adventurers to uncover the source of this sinister and ominous activity, 
rallying to the very heart of evil within the Temple itself. 

-Literal computer translation of one of the world's most beloved Dungeons 
 & Dragons campaign settings, the Realm of Greyhawk. The first and only PC 
 game to utilize the newly released D&D 3.5 Edition Rules. 

-Options for creating up to five characters per party, in a reactive world 
 filled with nonplayable characters (NPCs) that react differently to the  
 unique attributes of the adventuring party 


-Improved, easy-to-use turn-based combat system quickens gameplay and  
 allows players to better manage battles and spell casting 

-Dozens of skills and class abilities, over 50 feats and hundreds of   
 spells from which to chose, including cleric domain spells 

-Multiple quest solutions lead to different paths for different parties 


-Over 50 side quests allow players to explore beyond the main storyline 

-Multiple starting points depending on the party's alignment, and multiple 
 end games depending on how the game is played
