Saints Row 2  brings  true  freedom  to  open-world
gaming. Players can play as who they want, how they
want, and with whomever they want in this sequel to
the  much  acclaimed  and  tremendously  successful
Saints Row.  Set  years  after  the  original,  the
player finds himself in a Stilwater  both  familiar
and strange and challenged with bringing the Saints
back  as  the  rightful  kings  of  Stilwater   and
bringing vengeance to those who wronged him.
