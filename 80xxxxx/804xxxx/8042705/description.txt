And guess what, ANOTHER Troy spinoff, from Alice and JJ.

A complete tale from the Legends of Troy series. In his laboratory in the Conservatorium of Eckmul an old Sage named Alunys is feeling a little anxious.  After years of research heΓÇÖs on the verge of formulating the fourteenth highest Enchantment which would make him a legend among Sages and a shoe-in for the title of Venerable.

But during an experiment things go horribly wrong and Alunys exchanges a portion of his mind with that of his cat! In the company of the irritating Kyslapeth and the beautiful young herbalist Marikiri, he sets off on an expedition to find the only creature that can help; the legendary Krobatridere. His search will take him across the pirate infested Furious Sea to the remote and dangerous islands of the Haggatoe Archipelago where the surprise of his life awaits...
