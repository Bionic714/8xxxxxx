,twijjit,2013-01-20T14:56Z,"I did too! For the longest time... I know most of it's staged, but I just treat it as a non-reality show, and it's great! But it was starting to feel like it wasnt going anywhere..until I saw bits and pieces of these while they were converting (havent actually watched them yet) and looks like they're finally starting to move toward something.. I guess they're on a season break now, but 'll still find a way to catch up on em when they start up again :)"
,twijjit,2013-02-16T14:47Z,"Most of you who follow the show and have watched every available episode, know that there are entire gaps of missing episodes that have not been made available via torrents. Most of these missing episodes are now available via iTunes. Hopefully, some of you can get some free time and money to help out in replacing these missing episodes, as I fully intend to do as well. If you'd like to collaborate on this project to divide the task up, you can find me on ytepisodes.com - just post a message about it in the forums and I'll see it :)"
