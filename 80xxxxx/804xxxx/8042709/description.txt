Operation Repo S10E26 Roll the Dice (Aired Dec. 12th, 2012)

Description (from iTunes): When Ronnie takes the fall for losing their previous repo, Carlos tries to make amends. Lou and Carlos go after an airport shuttle, but have to contend with angry passengers who are less than thrilled about missing their flights. And a final repo goes terribly wrong when a professional gambler gives chase and his bodyguards drag Lou and Ronnie into a violent shootout. Will it all go south before Carlos is able to make things right?

Note: These will be my last uploads for Operation Repo and South Beach Tow. It's not really practical for me to keep doing it this way, and I've sorta lost interest in these shows. If later I manage to subscribe to the TruTV channel and I find a decent video capture device, I'll start up again and do all the TruTV shows. :)
