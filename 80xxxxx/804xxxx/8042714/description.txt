And here is Charlotte Gainsbourg mon amour, scanlated by LeChatBleu.

I finished my translation of Fabrice Tarrins autobiographical comic book Charlotte Gainsbourg mon amour. It's full of anecdotes, mostly from his younger years, revolving around him and his childhood celebrity crush Charlotte Gainsbourg, the daughter of famous French singer Serge Gainsbourg.
