South Beach Tow S02E13 Snakes in the Yard (Aired Dec. 12th, 2013) 

Description (from iTunes): 
It's judgment day for Tremont, Robert Sr. is still missing, and Robbie doesn't have the money to pay back Larry's loan. The yard is overrun with snakes, and Jerome's stalker makes one last desperate play.


Note: These will be my last uploads for Operation Repo and South Beach Tow. It's not really practical for me to keep doing it this way, and I've sorta lost interest in these shows. If later I manage to subscribe to the TruTV channel and I find a decent video capture device, I'll start up again and do all the TruTV shows. :)
