This may look like a talk show, but it is emphatically a comedy show. This fast-paced half-hour combines traditional elements of the late-night format with bold and irreverent comedy sketches - both inside and outside the studio. Hosted by Emmy-nominated writer Spike Feresten, it gives the staid late-night format a long-overdue update. Among other things, this refreshing approach to the genre uses guests in unpredictable ways, like delivering the monologue and performing in the comedy sketches. Additionally, the show features a staff of writer-performers, hilarious field pieces and much more.
