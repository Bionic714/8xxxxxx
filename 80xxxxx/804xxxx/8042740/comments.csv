,redhealer,2013-01-21T04:55Z,"This episode more closely matches S01E10 ""Alien Evidence"": 
An enigmatic photograph; a strange substance that floats to Earth; the continuing appearance of mysterious ""men in black""."
[V],psspss,2013-01-21T05:51Z,i think hes saying the title is wrong.. the repeat they switched the order perhaps? so its the same contents as S01E10 720p uploades after this
,Rawzor,2013-01-22T13:02Z,any chance of sharing this as an avi?
