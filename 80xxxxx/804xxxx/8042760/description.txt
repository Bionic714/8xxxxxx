DVD Extra Making of The Greatest Raid Of All


1)  Victoria Cross For Valour 
In September 1944 at the Battle of Arnhem, Major Cain won what was described as the "finest Victoria Cross of the whole war". Telling his story, along with other personal accounts of staggering bravery, Jeremy Clarkson looks at the history of the highest military decoration awarded for valour in the face of the enemy.

2)  Greatest Raid of All 
Jeremy Clarkson tells the story of one of the most daring operations of World War II - the Commando raid on the German occupied dry dock at St. Nazaire in France on 28th March 1942. It was an operation so successful and so heroic that it resulted in the award of five Victoria Crosses and 80 other decorations for gallantry.
