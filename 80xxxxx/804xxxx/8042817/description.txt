Encode:

As you imagine it took some time, loads of security in it, days of work i can
tell you, all for the security of the source.
Firstly there were watermarks, starting with small numbers counting from 0 to 9
randomly hardcoded in the video, and that during the whole movie, popping up
mainly in the centre eye of the video half lucent.
some kind of weird code for identifying dont know, cant blur them only when they
appear, would be around 300.000 of them so made small constant blur spots over the
20 spots where they randomly appear, now they are gone, wont effect the viewing
hardly seeable unless you are searching for it on purpose.
second watermark is a long line also hardcoded in the video with exact details of
owner, had to blur that parts only when they appear none of this line watermark
appears twice on the same spot, so had to blur each one manually and adjust them.
that was a pita, 720 cuts were necessary to remove them, some are above,below left
or right, not that much are in the center of viewing, but some are, and if its
daylight you will see them slightly, only appear 10sec each time there is no other
way to get it anymore secure.

sample is a bit longer,i chose a spot where you can see the blurs
the quality was already amazing, only added sharpness, well and the blurs
the video is complete nothing is cut out.

decided to make 2 versions one as usual for quality, size 2.4gb 720x304 @1700
and another for guys with lower bandwith size 1.4gb  640x272 @1000

its a big risk going out with this movie, hope you appreciate my work

I am a big fan of Lord of the Rings, watched each in cinema, and if you are too you
should also go to the cinema and support the producer and watch the movie on a big
screen, in 3d perhaps with the higher framerate.
