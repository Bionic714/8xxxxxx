Poor Moon is Christian Wargo (Fleet Foxes, Crystal Skulls), Casey Wescott (Fleet Foxes, Crystal Skulls) and brothers Ian and Peter Murray (The Christmas Cards). The band, named for frontman and primary songwriter Christian WargoΓÇÖs favorite Canned Heat song, began four years ago as a long-distance project while Wargo and Wescott were touring in support of the Fleet Foxes 2008 self-titled debut and Ian and Peter were living in the Bay area. Their first shows were at intimate Seattle house parties where they used playful throwaway monikers like Rabbit Kingdom and Cookie Mask. It wasnΓÇÖt until the band opened up for Deakin at SeattleΓÇÖs Neumos (under the name Peppermint Majesty) that things began to really take form. Recording began soon after. We at Sub Pop are immoderately proud to be releasing Poor Moon records. Illusion, Poor MoonΓÇÖs first release, was recorded in a variety of bedrooms, practice spaces, the Murray residence, and at AVAST! and Fastback studios in Seattle, with the help of engineer Jared Hankins and guest performances by many musician friends. Poor MoonΓÇÖs debut full-length will be out on Sub Pop in August 2012.
