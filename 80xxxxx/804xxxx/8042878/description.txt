KeyScrambler encrypts your keystrokes deep in the kernel, as they travel from your keyboard to the destination app, so whatever keyloggers may be awaiting in the operating system will get only scrambled, indecipherable, useless data to record. This preventive approach enables KeyScrambler to stay one step ahead of the bad guys instead of running after them. It protects your data/identity even on security compromised computers, defeats both known and unknown keyloggers, and effectively closes the gap in traditional anti-virus, anti-malware programs, whose detect-and-remove method proves ineffective in dealing with new malware attacks.
