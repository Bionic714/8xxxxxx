[V],Snowhiter,2013-01-21T02:43Z,No problem - thanx for the continual support. Comments are appreciated as that gives me an indication that TPB users are d/loading and not just other leech sites ;)
,peilass,2013-01-31T01:36Z,"I do appreciate your personal response to my comments. I'm sure I'm not alone -- I see from others' comments that your work is not going unnoticed. I also appreciate the timeliness of your uploads -- the day after they are shown in the UK. I assume you are located there. So, from Canada (an expat Brit), keep on chooglin'!"
