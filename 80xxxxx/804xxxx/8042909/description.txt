 The film is based on the life and times of a   
 superstar heroine from the dream factory we cal
'Bollywood'. The film is a daring, shocking     
 glamorous, scandalous behind the scenes        
 account of the reality behind the world of     
 glitz and glamour that our film stars inhabit. 
 For a country obsessed with films and film     
 stars,  Heroine will take audiences on a       
 voyeuristic journey to see what really goes on 
 behind the closed doors of make up rooms       
 and vanity vans. It will give them a chance to 
 go beyond the gorgeous smiles and politically  
 correctquotes, to see what really happens in   
 the lives of India's sweethearts. The bitching 
 and the politics, the secrets and the lies, the
 incredible highs of fame and the lonely        
 depths of failure.
