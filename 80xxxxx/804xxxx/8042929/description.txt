And here is the scanlation of Manara and Jodorowskys Borgia.
Scanlations of all 4 books + 2 of the Heavy Metal albums.

Borgia is a historical saga about the legendarily depraved family during the reign of Pope Alexander VI, aka Rodrigo Borgia. Compared to most of Jodorowskys other works, Borgia is striking for its lack of metaphysical subtext. Ultra-violent and outrageous, the narrative descends to depths that are almost transcendentally profane. Things happen in Borgia that I cannot describe in a respectable newspaper. Art is provided by Italian erotic comics maestro Milo Manara who here shows a great facility for mangled bodies and bloody stumps in addition to naked ladies.
