It means so much to me to see this series again and I seriously-- I just, am so happy. Thank you so much for this. I will definitely be helping to seed when I get there and am ELATED to see you were mentioning another season! 

I wish I had the means to do something equally to what you've done for myself and my Dad on memory lane. THANK YOU!!"
