I can easily manage to wait for so long :) I can finally stop raiding my longboxes and just read this excellent run of Priest's Black Panther on my Ipad :)

So thank you very much for uploading this!"

[V],STFmaryville,2013-01-20T15:13Z,"well I felt like it was a long time.  :-P

i have never read this, but i will now.

by the way, for anyone who never watched it, the marvel knights black panther animated series is well worth renting or buying (the torrents on TPB seem flawed). it was based on hudlin and romita jr.'s BP volume 4, and it's like $9 on amazon."
