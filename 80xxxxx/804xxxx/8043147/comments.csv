,Raai1707,2013-01-24T10:09Z,Does this work together with the Borderlands.2.Update.4.incl.DLC-SKIDROW or do I need to install the rekommendet update aswell?
,OhHiDere,2013-01-25T10:10Z,"Erm, i've got a slightly dumb question.

Does this work with the Steam version of Borderlands 2? I've pre-purchased it and bought the two other DLC's (Pirate Booty and Tourge).
Sadly, i didnt buy the season pack so i need to buy them all seperatily, and i do not have the money.. :/"
,Raai1707,2013-01-25T19:14Z,"@OhHiDere 
You can always try. Copy your savings before doing anything to be sure that u want lose your progress.
If it does not work just reinstall the one´s u have or try to download the hole game :)"

Welp, time to steal my mom's credit card."

1) install borderlands 2 skidrow
2) install 1.3.2 skidrow
3) install torgues carnage skidrow
4) install hammerlock skid row

...or do I have to put an older update in there somewhere ? Thanks."
