You cannot find any difference between the original MS win 7 &  this lite version. The only problem is in win7 64-bit is you cannot use Microsoft update & integrated updates till june 2012 so you don't have to worry abt updates, 32-bit works just fine with no probs at all. "
,banzer,2013-01-22T02:38Z,"This has both x86 and x64 edition; at boot you can choose which to install. I've only tried the x64, and I can say it's very speedy. Alot of the bloat has been removed, but the basic functionality is intact. Some programs and features maybe missing, but you may or may not miss them."

do you mean to say the win7 64-bit has updates till june 2012 integrated in it and also that one cannot use Microsoft update. i suppose this means updates beyond june 2012 will not be available/possible on this version.

> 32-bit works just fine with no probs at all.
i suppose this means one can use Microsoft update on this version.

please clarify. thanks."
,hemu.moto,2013-01-24T14:41Z,"@gnufella

A crack or activator should work fine - no need to go through a new download and installation because you already have the copy you want to have installed. Just search for some serials or a crack. I believe they're universal (not tied to these downloads, just the version)."
