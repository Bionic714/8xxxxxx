WINDOWS 7 ULT 32-BIT
It's bootable image based on en_windows_7_ultimate_with_sp1_x86_dvd_u_677460.iso

This Windows is updateable through Windows Update (language packs cannot be installed).

There is no any software or updates added except newer Internet Explorer 9.

Windows 7 will be activated if SLIC 2.1 is found in BIOS.

Reminder: Note that almost all the drivers are removed and you should have your computer drivers ready before installation.

If you are regular user you will not notice any difference using my lite version compared to full-featured Windows 7.

An autoattended.xml file is inserted in the image to automate the installation (Language: EN, name: Administrator, PC name: IK-PC, time: UTC+2h.
All can be changed after setup). You need only to point a partition for installation and in 5-10 min Windows should be installed.
