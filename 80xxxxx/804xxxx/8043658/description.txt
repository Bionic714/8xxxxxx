This comic has everything: beautiful artwork with breathtaking landscapes and a story inspired by Scottish poetry, legends and history... Perhaps the characters could be a little less stereotypical... But hey, its still a wonderful series. For the fans of Rob Roy and William Wallace!


Davey, a young dreamy shepherd, sees his life changed when he meets the gaze of a beautiful aristocrat. With flaming heart, he scales the walls of the castle to declare his love for the lady, but its just a beginning of his adventure...
