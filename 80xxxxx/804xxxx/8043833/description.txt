A stunning restoration of this film with the great care and attention that was needed to do it justice. Transports you back to 1972 as though it was yesterday. The fun and humour of the time and the affection with which all those involved look back at the period and project is infectious and heart-warming. How modern technology enables material of this type to be cleansed and invigorated with new life is as remarkable as the performance of the band itself.

The second Disc includes, interviews and hours of never-before-seen footage.
