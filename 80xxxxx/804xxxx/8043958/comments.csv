Alleen droomde ik ervan dat het linkje naar moviemeter anders moest zijn, zoiets: http://www.moviemeter.nl/film/86041"

Either my download became corrupt or there IS a problem with this rip.
BTW the first 30 minutes although great quality it was a crappy film anyway and I probably would have given up on it anyway. Divine intervention perhaps? lol"
