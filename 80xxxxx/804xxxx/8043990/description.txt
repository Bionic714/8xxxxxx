This series spins out of the N.O.W.H.E.R.E. storyline within Teen Titans.  Barely making it out of the events of "The Culling", Fairchild, brother and sister Thunder and Lightning, the monstrous Ridge, Beast Boy, and Terra are being pursued by Rose Wilson and Warblade, who want them dead at any cost!  No one's survival is certain each month in The Ravagers!
