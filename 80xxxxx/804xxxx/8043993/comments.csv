,Dilluck,2013-03-28T19:15Z,"to get past the Russian language, go into the program files at C:Program Files (x86)Paragon SoftwarePartition Manager 12 Professionalprogramresourcelang and change the Russian files to the English ones, which can be found by downloading the free 'Home Demo' version from the Partition Manager website :)"
