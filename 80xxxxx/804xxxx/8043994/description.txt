The Link:
From Fireworks to Forensics
Technology is all around us. From computers to cameras, cell phones to satellite navigation-our dependence on technology has never been greater. But how many of us ever stop to question how these inventions actually came about? Challenging the commonly held view, that they appear fully formed, out of nowhere, The Link reveals the surprising origins of some of the most important technological breakthroughs of the modern world. In this episode Josh Klein follows the links from ancient Chinese alchemy to the latest technology in crime fighting. Also see Justin at the DLR Robotics Laboratory. The robot can catch balls thrown at him. Visit an 18th Century wax work anatomical model at La Specola. Join Josh Klein in WW2 radar ops room at RAF Air Defence Radar Museum.
