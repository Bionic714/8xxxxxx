Growing Up Poor

Sociopolitical Documentary hosted by Andrew Knott, published by BBC in 2013 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

Filmed over one summer, this documentary follows three very different teenage girls and boys all on the cusp of adulthood and dealing with the pressures of growing up with one similarity - they are all surviving on under ┬ú10 a day.


1)  Girls 
For Bridie, her hopes of joining the army hinge on her staying out of trouble with the police. Amber is 16 and pregnant. She's fortunate that her mum is there to support her, but nonetheless scraping money together for all that she needs is a daunting task, quite apart from the prospect of motherhood. Like so many British teenagers affected by the recession Shelby was on jobseeker's allowance, but she's determined to find a job. Currently completing a work placement, she hopes it will develop into a real job.

2)  Lads 
Craig doesn't want to leave home but his mum has lost her job and cannot keep the house, leaving him unsure of where to go or what to do. After growing up with no father figure, Wes is determined to be part of his son's life - but being there and financially supporting him are two different things, so finding work is a priority in a city where jobs are scarce. Life on the streets means the smallest mistake can affect your entire future, as Frankie knows only too well. He is a changed person now and has a plan, but in a recession just getting a chance is hard enough.
