How to see who is connected to your wireless (Wi-Fi) network (router) with MyLanViewer Network/IP Scanner:

Your home wireless network can be used by neighbors or other outsiders without your knowledge. You can enable encryption for your wireless network, but it does not guarantee that your password will not be compromised, even if you are using a WPA2 security. So you need to check who is connected to your wireless network. For such things you can use special programs or a control panel of your Wi-Fi router. 
MyLanViewer Network/IP Scanner will show you all devices from your subnet, even those that are hidden. For these purposes you can use the "Subnet Monitoring" tool from the MyLanViewer. It will show who is connected to your Wi-Fi router.

System Requirements:

Windows 2000, XP, 2003, Vista, 7, 2008, 8. 32-bit or 64-bit. Net Framework is not required.
