Not only does he pay respect to the countless victims that were lost in the devastating tragedy, he makes artistic choices and liberties only the most seasoned directors can take. Quality is not so good, there is HD at theimpossible.blackunix.net and it worked great for me. Enjoy this spectacular movie!"
