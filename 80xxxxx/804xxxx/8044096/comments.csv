,sisco955,2013-01-21T03:34Z,Descent copy. I did not change vob to avi and it still played on vlc. Audio/10 video/8. Used crop feature 1.85:1 to get best picture size.
,sisco955,2013-01-21T03:53Z,"Audio 9. I listened with earplugs and it sounded okay. Video 7. Picture was not sharp, r5 maybe. I used the crop feature 1.85:1 to increase screen size and did not have to change vob to avi. It played fine on vlc."
