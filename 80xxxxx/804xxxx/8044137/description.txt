Genre-defying, Manchester-based indie rock outfit Everything Everything formed in the late 2000s around the talents of drummer Mike, vocalist, guitarist, laptop cowboy Jonathan, bass player Jerry, and guitar player Alex, all of whom share (professionally) the last name ΓÇ£EverythingΓÇ¥. Slaves to no single formula, the group draws from a well that runs as deep as the Beatles and Bowie, as accessible as R. Kelly and Michael Jackson and as heady as Ezra Pound and Steve Reich. The band signed to XL Recordings imprint Salvia in 2008 and released the single "Suffragette, Suffragette" in late November with plans for a full-length the following year.
