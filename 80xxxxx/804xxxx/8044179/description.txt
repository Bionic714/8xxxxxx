===Release Title===

Android Applications [Case1]

===Release Instructions===

here is a superb file manager for your android device:

any included SD DATA folders (starting with "com") go in /Android/obb or /Android/data (for non-OBB files). if these directories do not exist, create them.
SD DATA not in opaque binary blob (OBB) format is compressed in an RAR archive.
this is because of the large amount of files contained within, it makes
transferring the SD DATA much easier. as a general rule these will go in
/Android/data, then the RAR must be decompressed with an android archive extraction utility. do not copy the SD DATA itself to the folders previously specified, copy the provided folder containing the SD DATA to these folders in every case.
