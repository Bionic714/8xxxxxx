,ghdsd,2013-02-01T05:20Z,"WOW - Episode 7 was AWESOME!  Angie got drunk and ran around naked, and Jessie kicked the crap out of Fajita Mike and threw him out of the property on his ass ....  ok, sorry guys, just kidding.  I wish I knew what really happened - that was just my fantasy SINCE WE MIGHT NOT EVER FIND OUT!!!  Ok, sorry .. I had to vent somewhere."
,jdd6718,2013-02-01T05:40Z,What's Wrong with these people all they upload now is this hillbilly trailer trash crap
,ghdsd,2013-02-01T09:54Z,"jdd6718 - you are right!  The new ""Here Comes Honey Boo Boo"" trailer trash at it's absolute worst got uploaded 3 days ago and has 125 seeders.  Full Throttle w/ sensible business managers, biker chicks, great bands and plain ol' rock and roll legends with great story lines gets blown off.  I think it's the US Liberals pushing their mentality to have mindless entertainment for the masses of trashers and entitlement folkers instead of good ol' economic growth of capitalism, bikes, and hard core rock and roll.  Here Comes Honey Boo Boo???  If you don't know what I'm talking about ... go get it.  It's way popular here in the US and speaks volumes of folks living off of Gov. Programs instead of trying to find honest work and try to make this a better place to live in instead of flowing through the thalwag of social ambition.  Ok, I've rambled enough ... I'll be glad to be dying in another 20 years and leaving this mess to those young people who think not caring about anything other than how many minutes they have left on their cell phone plan is all that matters .... our wise and almighty leaders (Obama) have the wisdom to change Newtonian physics, social aspirations and economic structure of supply and demand so we will be lemmingfied to follow ...without thought,cause, or even aspiration to care ... for we have seen the light as told by some blind kid who looked cool sitting on the corner of the street w/ snot hanging out of his left nostril ... but none of that mattered because the 45 year old girl hanging on his every word and holding his head from dropping into the gutter flowing with vomit... I shall thank that woman tomorrow with some mint leaves to blend with our tee.
HONEY BOO BOO is where this country is going in  the next 50 years, and we are now laughing at the apearr point of our demise111  goddamn .... i NEED to see Angieland again.  See knows how to calk me down, instead of shooting the TV with Piers Morgan on it tonight!!!!!
I'm walking home tonight....I'll watch for Goat on his way home because he thinks I talk too smart and he says I intimidate him... I say I would rather be intimidated than be a fool who runs around being bad ass scaring people!   I sleep a little scared better than I sleep a little embarrassed for being creepy.  Holy crap!  I better shut up- or Michael is going to figure out who I am and that would spoil the surprise I have planned for next year."
,ghdsd,2013-02-01T10:19Z,"I just got a call from Piers a few minutes ago.  Apparently he is really upset with my comment on Chelsea handler when I told him to go back to England before we kick his ass AGAIN because England tried to take our guns away and we told them NO!!  Oh what would Michael Ballard do in this situation???  I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE THIS SHOW IS REALLY LEAVING US FAITHFUL FOLLOWERS OUT IN THE COLD HERE!!  Did Jessie blow himself up at the end of the show?  Did Angie leave Michael because of the pre-nup??  Did Goat and Jessie kiss and make up??  Did Jessie give his Ultimate Biker Award out yet>  Did the weather hold out for Jackyl on Thursday night?  Tanya Tucker ... stood by her man a little TOO much and miss the show on Wednesday???  Oh damn, I'll blow up before I learn any of this ... no wonder Honey Boo Boo is so popular.  Nothing happens there to think about other than ""Is she really THAT dumb????"""
,triptych6969,2013-02-01T13:22Z,awesome rip now we just need the other episodes.
,Harleyjew,2013-02-01T21:29Z,"First, thank you for the upload. Second, someone mentioned give a +1. What is that and how do I do it?"

What's Wrong with these people all they upload now is this hillbilly trailer trash crap

jdd I could not agree with you more. It is truly astounding. How stupid are these people to begin with to even think up these shows and then how stupid are these people to be airing  them and furthermore how brain dead do these people have to be to watch it (no offense anyone) but mostly how bored are these morons who actually do these for lack of a better word stunts or actions or whatever you want to call it. These idiots give white trash a whole new meaning and they just reinforce Americas' stereotype of rednecks. I realize these small towns have nothing to do but wow how do they come up with this stupidity and how do the powers that be find it so funny that they actually think people would watch them. 
It is truly astounding. And they keep coming up with new shows that are even dumber than the ones already on. Honey Boo Boo I heard the name but have no clue what the deal is since I have no desire to let the info assimilate in my brain. It might push something that is important in my brain out and let that crap in :-)  All i can say is thank G-D for DVD's and the HBO, Showtime, TMC, Starz and Encore networks. And the worst of it people around the world may actually see these shows. What they must think. I hope they do not think all of us are that foolish. Personally I like BBC-America. Graham Norton beats anything we have in the talk show format. Bring back Ab Fab although since it is a new world, they aren't as funny anymore. Or maybe I just grew up. Bring back The Carol Burnett show. Just the interaction between all the characters but especially Harvey Korman (RIP) and Tim Conway was worth watching it. Tim Conway making Harvey Korman laugh is irreplaceable. And Harvey Korman beginning to lose it but unable to hold back his laughter is priceless. And as far as my cable company, Time Warner, they removed the Ovation network and Current TV and those were outstanding channels showing important programs.
Okay I vented enough. "
,Harleyjew,2013-02-01T22:14Z,"ghdsd mentioned Tanya Tucker who is a legend. She had her first hit at the young age of 13 (Delta Dawn) and just kept going. Hit after hit after hit endless. Download her boxed set. I am sure you can find it here and if not, if someone can explain to how to upload a torrent, I will up it for you. She also fit right in at Sturgis because she has and loves to ride her Hot Pink Harley Davidson. More power to her. When I die, I want to go to Texas and ride my Harley with her on one side and Bocephus (Hank Williams Jr.) on the other :-)

Keep the rubber side down!"
,CoBrit,2013-02-03T23:57Z,Where elsewhere? I have searched & found nothing apart from streams that you have to pay for.
,ghdsd,2013-02-04T03:31Z,TorrentDay is a great site ... and they uploaded ep 6 and 7 today
,RossPat,2013-02-04T05:55Z,"""TorrentDay is a great site ... and they uploaded ep 6 and 7 today ""

,RossPat,2013-02-04T06:07Z,"I have S4E6 & 7

,CoBrit,2013-02-05T00:42Z,TorrentDay either requires an invite or $. Took me long enough to get an invite to TheBox...
,8899liava,2013-02-05T11:59Z,"please love this series hanging out for ep6, and random user dont bs us you spammer."
,8899liava,2013-02-05T12:56Z,"well after lots of searching i found ep6 on a streaming site, hesitant to post the link cause all those scammers lol I am sure i am going to look like one but might help someone out... (http://vidbull.com/kx2obvquuggm.html)
