,Tyler0120,2013-01-26T23:56Z,Can you mod these versions of Half-Life 1 & 2?
,brokengnome64,2013-01-30T18:21Z,"How do you activate the cheat console in this version?  You can't really add -dev -console from the command line since the game has to be executed through the ""Start Half Life"" file.  Is there a way to activate the cheat console without the command line commands?"
,HungryMoo,2013-04-01T07:53Z,"Why does it say ""Could not findsystem dll to load""?"
,HungryMoo,2013-04-01T07:54Z,"it happens to all the games

1.Stop the torrent from your torrent client and do a force recheck of the files.
2.Extract again
3.Stop Steam
4.Start a game from an ""Start X.exe"" (Where X is the game name) in compatability mode for Windows XP SP3.

Optional:
5.Update DirectX and Video Drivers. 
6.Scan for viruses using Malwarebytes"

,papin97,2013-04-21T04:33Z,"This game ONLY contained all Half-Life games (except Death Match, Blue Shift, and Opposing Force) and Portal. Where's CS 1.6? Where's DoD? Where's TF Classic?"
,pepo930,2013-04-27T21:38Z,"@CrazyGamers-Elite
The Half Life 2 games files are in gcf format, they work with steam.

@papin97
