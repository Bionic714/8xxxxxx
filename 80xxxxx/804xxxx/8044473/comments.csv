Good video, poor audio.

Thank you for upload."
,TheLathe,2013-04-25T22:37Z,"Yes, thank you very much for the excellent film!

But, what the other fellow said is true, the primary audio seems to be coming from the front right channel as opposed to the center.  

Thanks though!!!"
,TheLathe,2013-04-29T05:55Z,"What I did was snag a DVD rip from here and extract the audio from that and mux it in with your nice HD video  : )

Looks (and now sounds) REALLY nice!

Thanks mate!!!"
,malcolm_sv,2013-05-12T05:34Z,Maybe TheLathe can upload his version too.
