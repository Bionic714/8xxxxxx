Notes: Colors and contrast seem washed out in quite a few scenes which would indicate that the source had wrong black levels. But under closer inspection black values in most scenes go as down as 0,0,0 (RGB), so I decided not to color correct because that would have resulted in crushed blacks in a lot of places.
You can use the 16-235 -&gt; 0-255 custom shader in MPC-HC to color correct yourself if it bothers you, although I dont recommend it.

Fixed dirty lines on left and right sides so the damage is less visible.
