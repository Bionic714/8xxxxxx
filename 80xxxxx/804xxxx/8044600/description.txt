Note: On at least one or two of these, the scanner(s) had some pages out of order. I know how annoying this is, but I downloaded a *different* set from another torrent and *it had* the same flaw. Sorry!

From Wikipedia:

Supergirl is the name of six comic book series published by DC Comics, featuring various characters of the same name. The majority of the titles feature Superman's cousin Kara Zor-El.

In 2004, DC Comics introduced an updated version of Kara Zor-El in the pages of Superman/Batman. The following year, she began appearing in her own ongoing series, with Superman/Batman #19 being republished as issue #0 of Supergirl.

DC relaunched Supergirl in September 2011 as part of The New 52 reboot.
