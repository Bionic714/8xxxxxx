Before its reissue on Sanctuary in 2003, SolomonΓÇÖs Seal was the forgotten Pentangle album. The bandΓÇÖs swan-song, recorded as the folk quintet were splintering, reviews at the time dismissed it as a lacklustre final bow and subsequent assessments tended to concur. But how many actually heard it? The initial vinyl pressing was limited and the tapes were thought lost for years, eventually turning up among a pile of boxes propping up John RenbournΓÇÖs harmonium. That it re-emerged in 2003, in the midst of new folk revival, was entirely fitting, as here was a Pentangle album that dispensed with the progressive genre-fiddling of earlier albums in favour of a midnight-clear sound that chimed perfectly with the sounds of Will Oldham, PG Six and the like. A mix of quietly spooked standards and road-weary originals, itΓÇÖs a forlorn album, certainly; Jacqui McSheeΓÇÖs vocals on The Cherry Tree Carol and Willy OΓÇÖ Winsbury are heavy with an ancient across-the-ages sadness while tracks like Danny and BertΓÇÖs composition No Love Is Sorrow reveal the melancholy, yet still-warm alchemy at the heart of this truly unique outfit.
