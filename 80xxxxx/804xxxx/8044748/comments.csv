As I'm not very fluent in French I have not had any access to all the great French comics so I'm really grateful for all your hard work :)

My question/wish is whether you are planning to upload the complete Peter Pan Loisel comic? I am Swedish and we got the three first albums published here in the 90s and I'm dying to read the rest of it. If you will upload it, is there an estimate of when it will be available?

Thank you once again and keep up the good work! We really appreciate it! :)"
