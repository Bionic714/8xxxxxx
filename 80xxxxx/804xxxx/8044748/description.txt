And here is one of DarthScanners longer series...Aquablue.


Aquablue centers around the adventures of Wilfried Morgenstern, called Nao, young orphan and one of the sole survivors of the White Star cruise spaceliner wreck. Growing up on a space lifeboat with only Cybot (a simple but sentient and caring robotic nurse) to care for him, he eventually arrives on Aquablue, a planet almost totally covered by water. Arriving on the surface, Uruk Ur, a gigantic manta ray-shaped whale, takes an interest in him before disappearing back into the depths of the sea.

Taken in by the primitive blue skinned humanoid natives who see in him a messenger of their gods due to the visitation of Uruk Uru, he grows up one of their own. Eventually he becomes a strong young man, skilled at swimming, diving and fishing to non human levels, even though he does not have the gills and other water adaptions the locals possess. His abilities, strength and ingenuity, as well as the friends he makes during his adventures, help him overcome the issues he faces during the series.
