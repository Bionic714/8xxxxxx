[T],FatFreddy638,2013-01-21T02:44Z,"seriously!, you're having a go at me about spelling!!!.You try uploading over 600 shows in 9 months in your spare time whilst holding down 2 jobs  and we'll see if you make any typos.These are the things that make me wonder why I bother!"
,faduck,2013-01-21T09:27Z,Thank youuuuuuu :)
,CyndiLauperFiles,2013-01-21T23:10Z,"rkstr, did I catch you on a bad day? It was literally just an FYI.. nothing more, nothing less.  And with a friendly smile face at the end.  Plus I even thanked you for the file!!  How are you taking offense to that?  As a big Cyndi fan, I can't help myself but to point out when I see her name spelt incorrectly.  Also, anyone searching 'cyndi lauper' won't find this file. 

We've chatted before on a different website and you were so nice, but now I see you in a different light.  

Please understand it was a friendly FYI.   And, I feel your pain. I cap dozens of shows per week, for myself to keep.  I only upload about 10% of the stuff I cap online due to the ungrateful people out there. I mostly upload to private sites and IRC channels rather than here, because many Pirate Bay users are the most ungrateful of them all!"

[T],FatFreddy638,2013-01-22T08:52Z,"@CyndiLauperFiles-bad day,sorry!

One too many ""this is the wrong episode/season/spelling/please upload this comments"" I think my time as an uploader is coming to an end soon. Too much effort for very little reward. which you seem to know already.Sorry mate"
,CyndiLauperFiles,2013-01-31T03:15Z,"No worries.. I get it.   And yeah, people complaining makes you think 'why do I bother?'.  "
