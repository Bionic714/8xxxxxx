Finally someone has uploaded a copy of the episode ""Give the Guy a Hand""."
,RevaD,2013-01-21T12:05Z,"Spoke too soon!?!? The episode listed as ""1x07 - Give the Guy a Hand"" is NOT ""Give the Guy a Hand"". It is ""Cherchez La Femme"" which is not episode 7 in any country. It is E12 in Canada, E11 in France and E10 in Germany. 

Can anyone who has finished downloading these 12 episodes tell me which one is actually ""Give the Guy a Hand"" or ""Im Namen der Ehre""? 

After the opening credits it will show ""Im Namen der Ehre"" near the bottom right corner. The opening credits can be anything from 2 minutes to 8 minutes into the episode."
,Child-of-Knight,2013-01-21T23:47Z,Going by filesizes it would appear 1x07 and 1x12 are the same file.
,RevaD,2013-01-21T23:48Z,Both of your episodes 7 and 12 are actually episode 12: Cherchez La Femme
[V],thetorrentlord,2013-01-23T00:58Z,"Episode order & Alternate versions

Confusingly, RTL in Germany, M6 in France and HBO Canada/Super Écran 1 in Canada all have 

or plan to air the series in a different episode order, reflected in the following chart.
Episode 	                                                                   		

Canadian order 	French order 	German order
The General's Daughter 	3 		1 		1
Trojan Horsepower 	1 		2 		7
Harvest 		4 		3 		2
Dead Drop 		5 		4 		4
Sharks 			8 		5 		6
12 Hours 		11 		6 		12
City of Love 		9 		7 		9
Switch 			10 		8 		3
Hot Ice 		6 		9 		8
Give the Guy a Hand 	7 		10 		11
Cherchez La Femme 	12 		11 		10
Payback 		2 		12 		5

It is unclear at this point what the ""proper"", intended order for the episodes is. The 

German home video release presents the episodes as they were broadcast on RTL, adding the 

two unaired episodes (Give the Guy a Hand and 12 Hours) as episodes 11 and 12 

respectively. It is unknown what order the forthcoming French and potential North American 

home video releases will reflect. It is however certain that unlike other shows, 

production order should not be followed, as Trojan Horsepower was the last episode to be 

shot yet features the first meeting between Frank and Juliette, two characters who 

interact in other episodes, and is also the episode where Frank first sees the red Audi R8 

which appears in most later episodes. Trojan Horsepower served as the pilot episode in 

Canada, the second episode in France and the seventh in Germany. Those two countries both 

used The General's Daughter as the pilot episode, which had in fact been announced in the 

media as the pilot when production started. Based on the chronology of events, the 

Canadian release most likely carries the correct order of episodes.

In addition, at least some episodes reportedly have three different edits depending on the 

country of broadcast."
,Bynx,2013-01-23T15:25Z,After watching the first 3 episodes I noticed that to save money they use the same chase scenes for completely different chases. Really distracting. They could have at least re edited a bit to make them look different leaving out the slide through the fish market.
,Maxpayne33,2013-01-24T05:50Z,"Having seen all of the episodes, (except ""Hand"") here is an order that makes sense.  Trojan, General, Harvest, Dead Drop, Sharks, 12 Hours, City of Love, Switch, Hot Ice, Payback and Cherchez is CLEARLY the Series 1 Finale.  GREAT show, must have more!"
,taxentaxen,2013-02-02T18:58Z,"@RevaD @Child-of-Knight
You are right. 1x07 and 1x12 are BIT BY BIT EXACTLY the same files. I just get 1x07, stop torrent, copy 1x07 as 1x12, do Force Re-Check, and everything goes fine! There is no need to download both files. When 1x12 is done, just copy it as 1x07. You can save 349MB data transfer! Or actually 1x07 is not really 1x07, you don't need it anyway."
,FilipeR10,2013-02-17T03:42Z,"Hi, it's only me or in the episode 6 called Hot Ice (if the one i have is right, i have the 2HD release that is suposed to being releasing the canadian version as it goes air), anyway, in that episode he seems to be testing the car for the first time, as he had never drove it, should that not be the first episode of the series????
Thanks."
