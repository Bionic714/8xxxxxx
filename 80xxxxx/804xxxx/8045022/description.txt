NOTE: I suggest downloading VLC Media Player to watch this release.  You can download it here:

A few important and simple keyboard shortcuts for VLC are:

Double click: Fullscreen
Spacebar: Play/Pause
V key: Enable/Disable/Change Language of Subtitles.
G/H key: Subtitle Delay (-50ms/+50ms each tap)
J/K key: Audio Delay (-50ms/+50ms each tap)

NOTE: English subtitles are on by default, simply tap the V key three (3) times in VLC Media Player to disable them.

NOTE: Three samples are included as well as the NFO files.

NOTE: I do not have constant Internet access, so this upload may take a few days.  Please be patient!

NOTE: I am in the process of uploading all the recent BDRIPS/DVDRips of popular TV shows that are not on TPB.  Considering I do not have fast upload speeds, nor do I have constant Internet access, AND there are pretty much unlimited DVDRips/BDRips to upload, this will take a super long time.  However, let me know if you have a request, and I will see what I can do.

Enjoy; please rate, comment, and seed!
