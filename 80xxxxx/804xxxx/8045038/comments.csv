,The__Akram,2013-02-11T12:30Z,"Seriously, there should be an obligatory IMDB link for every movie added here"
,Galaniel,2013-02-11T17:04Z,Yes because doing a search takes a whole 10 seconds longer.  I mean you could have sex with a real girl twice in that time!!
,bptamblyn,2013-02-12T01:14Z,@iamhelix it is protected. Audio stops like 20 mins into the movie.
,bptamblyn,2013-02-12T01:14Z,"I should note, this was on a blue-ray player not on my comp. Plays fine on my comp."
,bptamblyn,2013-02-12T01:15Z,This copy is Cinvidia protected.
,Phatfish,2013-02-12T20:31Z,"I'm over the top amused by all this failstation, fluxbox, balloon-diskplayer fails.

Having fun with all your consumer garbage?

Don't you guys never learn...

Also you spelled ""fail"" wrong is F-A-I-L not B-O-O-M...

Just sayin'..."
,Lewisiom,2013-02-12T22:50Z,"I think it was a gr8 movie, I mean, I was nearly laughing just before it ended but me landlord happened to knock on me door..."
,Sick3r,2013-02-13T05:24Z,"Oh I'm going to enjoy this!! =D

Some UFC guys in there it seems."
,teigur_1,2013-02-13T06:28Z,Well.... Im downloading at the moment but I got to say this movie looks good from what I see on imdb. Kevin James was not bad in King of queens and very funny in Grown Ups.
,stalkersrage,2013-02-13T06:32Z,"@Phatfish - ""Don't you guys never learn?""

What the fuck? Apparently the answer to your question is yes. I believe the phrase you were looking for was ""Don't you guys ever learn?""

And no, they don't. That's why this movie has been slowly climbing up to number 2. "
,vypliv,2013-02-13T15:07Z,"Nice social debate going on here. I was hoping to read something about the torrent, but people being proud of the size of their TV...thats also interesting. Reminds me of my proud ownership of SVGA monitor, which natively supported high resolution of 640*480 with 256 colours."
,spcigel,2013-02-14T09:17Z,""" Gelanie"" :""Yes because doing a search takes a whole 10 seconds longer. I mean you could have sex with a real girl twice in that time!! ""

Oh c'mon now,showoff.A REAL GIRL?! I Doubt that,but you know if that is true I am on his side hands down.A IMDB link to every movie so some of us can havex 1-2 times rather than look for the movie on imdb ourself.

More sex to the downloaders,IMDB links on every movie upload damnit!"

,DrugSquad66,2013-02-15T06:40Z,"what a cocksucker of a movie, i had to sit through it because of work, felt like cutting my face off having to watch it. So fucking awful, a disgrace, abysmal, like if depression and nihilism were combined into a torture.  "
,Juhko1985,2013-02-15T10:28Z,"Very nice quality but movie 4/10
There were some funny parts.. but overall a ""children"" or a ""family"" movie.."
,03storic,2013-02-15T11:25Z,"What is with all the aggression here? Who cares about anyone else anyway? 

The world keeps turning whether or not you have a massive television and even if you didn't like the movie that doesn't mean other people won't enjoy it."
,Flimx,2013-02-15T11:44Z,"Wow, so many haters on this site...

I just finished watching this movie and I really enjoyed it. 

Id like to rate it:

A: 10
V: 10

This movie was a 7/10 truth be told, u will like it especially if ur tired of all these mainstream flicks. It was funny, no supercomplex story though. "

,xxjaretxx,2013-02-27T10:42Z,"Thanks abunch Man! Ive been around for years on TPB this is the first comment i have ever left. I am going to post this comment or one similar on all of the popular shows and movies I get. The MAIN REASON FOR MY POST IS I WANT TO TELL/REMIND EVERYONE THAT THE ""COPYRIGHT ALERT SYSTEM"" was launched yesterday. Most of the major isp's are involved, AT&T, TIME WARNER, VERIZON, and CABLEVISION, along with many others. SO GET BEHIND A VPN if you don't want your ISP dropping you for copyright infringement. Supposedly u get around 5 warnings then they drop you.  Just a friendly heads up to all you Pirates! here is a link to a news article about it, pretty basic column. :: http://news.yahoo.com/pirates-beware-industry-isps-launch-copyright-alert-system-000744092.html PROXY VPN or ""Borrow"" Wi-fi from the neighbors for your downloadingl I had a VPN in the past but it made my downloads drop DRASTICALLY so I currently looking for the best VPN or other option where I can maintain a decent speed. I appreciate the work you put into uploading, and the sourcing that goes into it. You seriously rock man, Keep up the Great work!"
