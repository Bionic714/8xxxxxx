Again, these are NOT whole episodes! They are the project parts! However, if you like the shows I really do suggest getting the DVD series. This is more to help you decide if you like the series. =)

This series also airs on regular, free tv on PBS. If you want to see a whole episode without buying it, try to catch it on TV! It'll give you a better idea of what it's all about.
