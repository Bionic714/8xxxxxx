Saint Patrick's Day, or Paddy's Day as it is better known in Ireland falls this year on Sunday the 17th of March.  There are many versions of this on the Net, but none feature the original DVD quality and none have the tracks already split and tagged ready for VJ or Pro Video Discotheque use on the night.

Fellow Celts everywhere and yes that includes Wales, Scotland and yes even the Norwegian's will get goose bumps listing to these tracks, and hopefully you will as well.  Enjoy the magic live from Slain Castle and happy Paddy's Day where ever you celebrate it.

Format 16:9 Wide Screen
VOB (MPEG2) files as original DVD quality but split into music tracks for Pro VJ Use.
