From Wikipedia, with a couple of notes that I added:

In 2005, Marvel began publishing Black Panther vol. 4, which ran 41 issues (April 2005 - Nov. 2008). It was initially written by filmmaker Reginald Hudlin (through issue #38) and penciled by John Romita, Jr. (through #6). Hudlin said he wanted to add "street cred" to the title, although he noted that the book was not necessarily or primarily geared toward an African-American readership. As influences for his characterization of the character, Hudlin has cited comic character Batman, film director Spike Lee, and music artist Sean Combs.

Issue #18 features the wedding of the Black Panther -- T'Challa marries former X-Men leader Storm. Their marriage lasted for six years of comics (until 2012's Avengers Vs. X-Men crossover).

Issues 28 to 30 features the undead heroes-turned-brain-eaters of an alternate Earth, taking place between Marvel Zombies and Marvel Zombies 2.

Based on the Hudlin-Romita Jr. issues, Marvel Animation and BET began producing a primetime animated series. Djimon Hounsou was cast as the voice of Black Panther. The series is produced in motion-comic style. The series premiered online in the US on June 23, 2010, and was released on DVD in the US in January 2011.
