Create a Beautiful, Modern Home with One-of-a-Kind DIY Furniture
 Beds, organizers, Adirondack chairs, a play table, and more! It's easy to build inexpensive, quality furnishings with this indispensible collection of woodworking projects from Ana White, the popular blogger who has inspired millions of homemakers with her stylish furniture plans and DIY spirit. As a young mom on a tight budget, Ana learned to make her own well-designed pieces inspired by the styles in her favorite storesΓÇösaving thousands of dollars in the process.

Now, in this reference for woodworkers of all skill levels, Ana shares everything she has learned along the way. Inside The Handbuilt Home you'll find:
 ΓÇó Plans for 34 versatile furniture projects for every room in your houseΓÇöfrom beginner-friendly home accessories to sturdy tables, a media center, kidsΓÇÖ items, and storage solutions
 ΓÇó Comprehensive information on using off-the-shelf lumber and basic equipmentΓÇöalmost every project can be made with a drill, a saw, and some hand tools
 ΓÇó Easy-to-follow instructions, costs, and time estimates to guide even the most amateur of carpenters through any project
 You donΓÇÖt need to be physically tough or superstrong to make your own furniture, and itΓÇÖs okay if you donΓÇÖt know that a 2x4 doesnΓÇÖt actually measure 2 by 4 inches. All you need is the determination to create a better home for yourself or your family and the confidence to say, ΓÇ£I can build that.ΓÇ¥
