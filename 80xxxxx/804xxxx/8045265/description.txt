       "Entrance of the Gladiators" or "Entry of the Gladiators" is a military march composed in 1897 by the Czech composer Julius Fuc√≠k. In 1910 Canadian composer Louis-Philippe Laurendeau arranged "Entrance of the Gladiators" for a small band under the title "Thunder and Blazes", and sold this version throughout North America. It was during this period that the song gained lasting popularity as a screamer march for circuses, often used to introduce clowns. 

       In 1974, writers Leo Sayer and David Courtney wove the introduction and melody into their composition, "The Show Must Go On" which became a hit for the pop group Three Dog Night.

      Gwen Stefani's "Don't Get It Twisted" from her 2006 album "The Sweet Escape" makes use of the theme in the song's main hook.
