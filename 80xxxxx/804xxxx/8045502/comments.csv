Noise
Man from Nowhere
K-20 Legend Of The Mask
Battle for Terra

Might I suggest regular care & feeding of your non-seeded torrents? If not possible, do you know of any alternatives?

Thanks"

@ bazquux ....

Exactly right now, Sadbawang has 3000 
uploaded movies here at The Pirate Bay .... !

""regular care & feeding"" ....

.... Do you really mean that he has some kind 
of ""responsibility"" to keep them alive .... ?

===========================================

IF you type in your requests in The Pirate Bay seachbox,
there will be an easy ""piece of cake"" to find what you're looking for .... !

/ Good Luck !"

I'm talking about the 1134 that have no seeds. I'd love to be your accountant!

""Do you really mean that he has some kind of ""responsibility"" to keep them alive""
The logistics behind such a large number will be rather difficult. I have made a request in the comments before for the exact same titles. I have also asked in the suprbay reseed forums with no joy.

""IF you type in your requests in The Pirate Bay seachbox, there will be an easy ""piece of cake"" to find what you're looking for""
Let's see:
1) Noise - there is no other copy available. Note that there were two titles with that name in 2007.
2, 3 & 4) Nothing around 2GB in H.264 with seeds.

The reference I made to alternatives, was to do with seedboxes or alternative download sites. 

Good luck to you in finding somewhere to shove your patronising answer."

@ bazquux ....

IF this amazing uploader Sadbawang is gonna keep up YOUR ""regular care & feeding""
for ""nonseeded movies""..... , then he has to save 3000 movies x 2 GB for this service .... 
( Not 1134 .... )

.... Because Sadbawang probably can't ""foresee"" on 
exactly which movies there will be seed-problems ..... !

================================================

And you failed to find 1 of your 4 movies through TPB searchbox .... ?
Houston ! .... Houston ! .... We have a spoiled downloader of ""free movies"" here .... !

.... Maybe you should try to get a life, or something .... ?

You do realise 1 in 3 files aren't being seeded? It's quite simple to see when seeds are getting low while peers are non-zero. Try and learn some basic screen scraping using Perl or wget & awk.

""And you failed to find 1 of your 4 movies through TPB searchbox .... ?""
Your lack of comprehension would dismay a kindergarten. There was no ""failure"". There simply aren't alternative files matching those criteria for ALL FOUR TITLES. Duh!

""We have a spoiled downloader of ""free movies"" here .... !""
Time and bandwidth is not ""free"" for downloader or uploader. What a stupid argument you make.

"" Maybe you should try to get a life, or something .... ?""
I wouldn't take your life over this, no matter how pitiful you are. 4chan misses you, moron."
