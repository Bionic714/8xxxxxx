[S],soda,2013-01-21T04:30Z,Link failed because we don't allow them.  If you bypass anti-spam measures we will consider you a spammer.  I've deleted your comment this time.  Don't do that again.

Is there a reason it's not allowed? Just strikes me as odd, and I'm curious."
[S],soda,2013-01-21T11:15Z,"Your links were ""legit"" in the sense that there were only one or two (iirc) pointing to a band's fb account on a torrent of that band.  [That's why I didn't ban you.]

But too many people have gone too much further, posting their links on dozens of other people's torrents in floods of ""if you liked this torrent you should check out xxx's facebook page"" spam."
