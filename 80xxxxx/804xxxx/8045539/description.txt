Recommend to you to use latest version of VLC player. Install K-Lite Codec Pack or shark007 codecs
in case of any kind of problem in playback (For non-VLC Media Player users). Alternatively, install
Core AVC codecs, the fastest decoder that there is coupled with Community Center Codec Pack and play
on Windows Media Player Classic. Check sample to be sure.
Enjoy!
