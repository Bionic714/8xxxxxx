,PrinceCorwin,2013-01-21T04:37Z,"I know we all appreciate the effort completely, but I can't help asking why are ther so many duplications amongst the packages? Not complaining... just asking."
[V],shirepirate,2013-01-21T06:11Z,"@PrinceCorwin

because many desire the latest versions of these apps, and cracked apps cannot be updated through normal means. there should not be any duplicates of same versions of apps, if there are it was a mistake. same applies for the games packs."
,fang80,2013-01-21T12:24Z,I really appreciate your work but I agree with princecorvin. I think it is too many duplicates. It would be enough to update versions once in 2 weeks or once a month. Beside that you would have more time to crack other paid apps. 
[V],shirepirate,2013-01-21T13:37Z,"@fang80

you can deselect any apps you don't want to download in your torrent client fairly easily. you won't be counted as a seeder without the full torrent contents but you can still seed back the part that you download and that is enough."

,chop007,2013-01-21T21:21Z,"For those with custom roms and kernels, sometimes it requires the latest app for bug fixes, improvements and compatibility. Thanks Hobit, you may be short but you bring the giants to their knees. Awesome."
,vcdman17,2013-01-21T21:42Z,"Yeah, all those duplicates mean I have to scroll through a list of FREE apps for an extra 5 seconds. Really? Thank you Hobbit for everything. I check every list you guys put out regardless of how many updates are in it. Much appreciated."
,pretohit,2013-01-22T00:15Z,"Thank you Hobbit for everything... you are doing great, no complaints about duplicates around here..."
,00Daddio,2013-01-22T06:03Z,"Great pack, Thank you! If you come across this one here I would love to get it. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ceton.companion  It is not an expensive one but I hate haveing to buy it for myself and every kid in the houses tablets and then the wifes."
