..until I came across your release, its quite unbelievable that something so good could still be so small..

I'd like you to release some anime that really good some good ratings.. like Steins;Gate (TV)
Clannad After Story (TV)
Rurouni Kenshin: Trust & Betrayal (OAV)
Fullmetal Alchemist (TV) Brotherhood
Death Note (TV) 720p
Hyouka (Detective anime)

..give a hint to ppl who follow you on what can be xpected next in ur releases.. ^_^"
