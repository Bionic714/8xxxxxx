,duQ0603,2013-01-21T07:36Z,seems to be a bad broadcast... both this file and a streaming site have the same audio glitch out about 3/4 of the way in... total video/audio desync 
,Mortavian,2013-01-21T07:49Z,"Not just desync, but a solid 10 minutes of audio is gone. On the flip side, you get ten minutes of silence at the end."
,tokerator,2013-01-21T08:06Z,Yep. It's fucked about 33 mins in.
,antonavy,2013-01-21T17:32Z,"Yeah, the sound is messed up from ~31 mins."
,shruvly,2013-01-21T21:43Z,"Yup, sound is fucked up beyond repair from ~30mins..."
,ragehavoc,2013-01-23T06:28Z,"Hey people, if the video is fubar GIVE HIM A NEGATIVE RATING, that way other people wont download a shitty vid and hopefully this will get removed"
