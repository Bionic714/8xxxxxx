[V],STFmaryville,2013-01-21T13:01Z,thanks for sharing Rakoth
,ch3yt,2013-01-21T17:40Z,"A masterful collection from Empire (and thanks to Rakoth for re-posting).  I'm still hoping for the last part of the series to be released in such wonderful quality, too..."
[V],LeonardTSpock,2013-01-21T19:14Z,"What is Empire? These are the recolored versions of the series that were done for the Absolute books, later released one issue at a time through DC Digital. Issues 57-75 and the Sandman Special (The Song of Orpheus) are also available."
,Rakoth,2013-01-22T15:22Z,"Leonard, Empire is the group of people who ripped and converted the comics. Thank you for clarifying some of the info from the description.

Everyone else, thanks for seeding and enjoying. Strangely enough, shortly after this went up I started hearing another Empire ripper just completed a full 1-75 run in even higher resolution. I'm trying to get my hands on it to share soon. "
[V],LeonardTSpock,2013-01-24T04:17Z,"I'm not trying to be a jerk here, but I think this needs to be clarified. There is no 'ripping' involved. You can go to DC Digital and buy all 75 issues of the recolored issues that were done for the Absolute editions. I know this, because I've had them (the issues in this upload) for quite some time. It's very clear when you look at them that these weren't done by a home scanner. They're absolutely perfect in every way. I understand that somebody had to download (likely from SLSK, where they've been for a long time), compile and distribute them as a torrent, but making it seem like they've done something special kind of bothers me. Of course, I'm against scanner tags to begin with, so take this as you will. "
,Rakoth,2013-01-25T20:00Z,"Yes, you are correct in stating these are available digitally and aren't scans. That's why I put digital in the title of the torrent, the description, the tags, and never said it was scanned. If you want to quibble over the parameters of a rip, more power to you I guess, but purchasing these from DC Digital or Comixology doesn't just give you DRM-free CBRs. There is a process involved in creating these, Empire is the only group to have taken the time to go through that process, and I think they deserve the credit for that (which isn't exactly asking you to grovel and send them a donation). 

I know we're getting way out into the weeds here and most people don't care, but I'm kind of curious about your feelings against scanner tags. If nothing else, it's helpful to figure out if you're downloading something better than what you have and serves as a mark of quality. If you have scans of Preacher that aren't tagged and look like crap, it's tough to figure out if a different untagged Preacher torrent is better, worse, or exactly the same. "

Where can I find the rest of the issues?"
