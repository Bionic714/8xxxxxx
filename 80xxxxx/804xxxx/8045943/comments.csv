Most uploaders take the attitude that just because it's free and they have a skull by their name that they can upload shit with no warning and we should be grateful for their turdish upload. Again, THANK YOU, and the glitches you mention are not too terribly bad. Keep up the good work, you have earned my trust!! Peace, Love, Respect, DrScott"
