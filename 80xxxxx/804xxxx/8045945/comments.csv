""STUFF YOU SHOULD KNOW"" is a new genre-bending television series about a real podcast that's set in a fictional world. Let us explain...Josh Clark and Chuck Bryant are two real guys - uber-popular podcasters and actual Discovery Communications employees. Their podcast, also called Stuff You Should Know, is in the top ten on iTunes with more than five million monthly downloads. Science Channel follows Josh and Chuck inside and outside the recording booth with ""STUFF YOU SHOULD KNOW"", a series that combines all the delicious informational nuggets of their podcast and wraps them in deadpan mockumentary-style humor. Along for the ride are a wide array of guests making cameo appearances, including John Hodgman, Sarah Silverman, Neil deGrasse Tyson, Rufus Wainwright, and Michio Kaku.
