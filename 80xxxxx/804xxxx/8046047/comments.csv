1. Some security softwares may give warning for patch, it is false positive and don't worry about it.
 2. Do not update the application."

,elto73,2013-01-31T22:57Z,"TROJAN WARNING
run your antivirus software if you downloaded this.  I think ""ChingLiu.Install.Notes.nfo"" could be a trojan called TR/Dropper.Gen. I dont know enough about it to be sure though.   I downloaded another one of Ching Liu's cracks and I got a virus warning.  Many people reporting that the activation is not working with Ching's cracks.   Please post if you have a trojan on your system. "

DID YOU NOT READ THE COMMENT FROM THE UPLOADER!

You people who keep posting comments about ""Trojans"" should inform yourselves before posting stupid comments!"
