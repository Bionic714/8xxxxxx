,SAMSON4X,2013-01-21T22:23Z,SILENT...this is what is called a SCREENER. With all screeners there is the FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION message that flashes very infrequently throughout the movie. If you are UNHAPPY with it thenyou have two options you can crop the movie to hell to hide the little message at the bottom of the movie or you can  DELETE THE DAMN MOVIE and wait for the DVD to reach your nearest store. What do you wanna do?
,silentinquiry,2013-01-22T02:23Z,"I will wait for you uploaders someday to be a little truthful as to the content and info in your movie. That way we dont have to WASTE TIME, BANDWIDTH and my rapidly declining patience, downloading a piece of crap. Really quite simple. Honesty, you ought to try it sometime. Thats what I want. Till then I will wait for a clean dvd rip, something you know absolutely nothing about. "
,silentinquiry,2013-01-22T02:26Z,"And where in the hell do you get the notion that every ""SCREENER"" has watermarks, They DONT."
,SAMSON4X,2013-01-22T20:44Z,"As I said SILENT...Feel free to wait for the video to come to DVD... and when it does, make sure YOU BUY IT and upload it in multiple formats: AVI/HD/720/1080, AC3/MKV/Wide Screen etc to TPB for everyone to download. Also, feel free to go into movie theatres with you camcorder and record current movies and upload those too to TPB. Until then STFU be thankful, and appreciative to those who upload SCREENERS for your enjoyment"
,silentinquiry,2013-01-23T01:42Z,Yeah right
,silentinquiry,2013-01-23T01:56Z,"you just dont understand. screeners like yours are not enjoyable, they are annoying, why bother wasting peoples time, patience till the dvd's come out then go for it. whiner"
