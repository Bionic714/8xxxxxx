I noticed that there seems to be a lot of versions of this movie with Chinese subtitles and versions that do NOT allow a person to convert it into DVD format. I have a great version that I ran through VIRTUAL DUB for the sake of rebuilding the AVI file, which had errors in it that didn't allow conversion. It is NOT cropped like some other versions and does not have non English subs hard coded in. It also plays and converts completely. ENJOY
