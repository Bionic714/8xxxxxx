Saint Dominic's Preview is an album by Northern Irish singer-songwriter Van Morrison, released in 1972. The diversity of the material on the album highlighted the skill with which Morrison could fuse Celtic folk, R&B, blues, jazz and the singer-songwriter genre. "Jackie Wilson Said (I'm in Heaven When You Smile)" and the title track, top quality blends of Stax soul and folk, became staples of his live set, while lesser known tracks such as "Gypsy" and "Redwood Tree" continued to display a lyrical celebration of nature's beauty.

Also on the album were two lengthy, hypnotic tracks, "Listen to the Lion" and the closing "Almost Independence Day" which were given primal, cathartic and intense vocal performances from Morrison. These tracks were more similar to the songs on his critically lauded 1968 song-cycle Astral Weeks.

Rolling Stone Magazine declared it "the best-produced, most ambitious Van Morrison record yet released."[1]It ranks at #36 at Rate Your Music's Top Albums of 1972.[2]

It was his first album not to have love as its central theme and significantly (as his marriage was deteriorating) the cover shows Morrison looking like a gypsy troubadour out on the street.
