Brendan is a local (Detroit) boy, as is, of course, Jack.
Know a girl who went out with Brendan. He dumped her. And damn, she's beautiful.
Would be nice to have his other albums in FLAC.
Very talented fairly unknown, unrecognized artist.
I don't think he or Jack care much. They just do what they do."
