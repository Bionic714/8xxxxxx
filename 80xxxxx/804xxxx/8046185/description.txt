Wonderful World
By Eric Webb

IΓÇÖm not breaking any boundaries when I say that Brendan Benson is a maestro of power pop. ItΓÇÖs kind of his ΓÇ£thing.ΓÇ¥ Accordingly, I wonΓÇÖt try to drop any new knowledge bombs. What Kind of World is an airtight, wonderfully crafted album that sounds like the freshest studio project of 1978. ItΓÇÖs such a satisfying listen that you have to wonder if Jack White has it in for olΓÇÖ Brendan.

Benson and White, bandmates in the Raconteurs, both released their new albums on April 23. To no oneΓÇÖs surprise, WhiteΓÇÖs Blunderbuss, which also wears its old-school influence proudly, has dominated both the charts and the chatter of music fans. In an otherwise lackluster week for new releases, the wonderful What Kind of World would have been the weekΓÇÖs most exciting album, hands down.

Fans of Styx and REO Speedwagon need look no further than BensonΓÇÖs oeuvre, which holds the energetic, propulsive kind of pop-rock that made those bands household names. What Kind of World doesnΓÇÖt indulge in the more bombastic, arena tendencies of those bands, instead keeping affairs on the mellow-and-confident side.

Recorded entirely in analog and divided into two sides, any track on What Kind of World could serve as a single. The title track alternates between a slow burn and a sweeping chorus, while ΓÇ£Happy Most of the TimeΓÇ¥ settles into a nice, piano-heavy Ben Folds groove; ΓÇ£The Light of DayΓÇ¥ could easily be a ΓÇ£Sha ShaΓÇ¥-era Ben Kweller tune. ΓÇ£Here In the DeadlightsΓÇ¥ bears more than a passing resemblance to RushΓÇÖs ΓÇ£Tom SawyerΓÇ¥ in the chorus.

Benson has a poetic flair, singing on ΓÇ£Happy Most of the TimeΓÇ¥ about the ΓÇ£heavenly sway of teenage hips,ΓÇ¥ and on ΓÇ£Pretty BabyΓÇ¥ crooning ΓÇ£keep me anywhere you want, just never set me free.ΓÇ¥ That track is a darker one, sounding more than a bit like White himself and setting off the more somber tone with a beautiful violin part. The bluesy overtones match perfectly with lines like, ΓÇ£Why now, baby, would a lady bring the heat?ΓÇ¥

What Kind of World excels in its accessibility. Benson writes songs that sound like what weΓÇÖve come to expect good old fashioned rock music to sound like. Even in moments of stylistic experimentation, like the folk-flavored ΓÇ£On the Fence,ΓÇ¥ Benson keeps things tight and toe-tappingly listenable ΓÇö there arenΓÇÖt any navel-gazing diversions or tedious ΓÇ£artisticΓÇ¥ indulgences. What Kind of World is just well-built music.
