,KuBiSCaNn,2013-01-21T19:16Z,"I'm definitely giving this one a try, so far I have no comlaints about scene4all ups, so yeah, tnx in advance.
Btw @gazjones, the time difference is probably due to the cut in the end titles as @tororosso85 said.
Cheers!"

Pretty good quality for a webrip.
The movie itself was not as good as I hoped for. But still, it's Silent Hill :D"
,antiseed,2013-01-22T10:48Z,@strawhat0gunner with English like that I'm surprised you like any movies
,antiseed,2013-01-22T11:04Z,"@dabsmgee if it weren't for people ""complaining"" how would anyone know if the quality is good? Think before you speak."
,WinkyPirate,2013-01-22T19:25Z,It's a complete movie. Some lagging in some parts but the audio is good. For this type of rip I give Video 10/10 and Audio 10/10. 10 is the best. Thank you.
,woyaboy,2013-01-22T19:36Z,"IF you liked the first movie and are a fan of the games, this movie is just fine. It really was not bad for fans, but I can understand why people who haven't immersed themselves in the Silent Hill world wouldn't like it. Just keep in mind, most scary movies are critically panned, and this movie needs to be judged off what it provided for SH fans, and not the average movie goer. "
,CarlZeiss,2013-01-22T20:26Z,"woyaboy is correct.  If you played the games I think you'll enjoy seeing Pyramid Head, and Alessa, and that detective dude come to life.  It's pretty cool.

But... Look, even though I do not agree with the critics that are in many reviews, this is a case I give them all the reason, the film deserves a failing grade he received, is 1 hour and a half of pure bad taste, whoever wants to suffer a little, feel the desire!"
,ectoendomezo,2013-01-23T00:53Z,"Sigh..the initial 'Silent Hill' was imho pretty damned great..creepy..hero's DIE..and Sean Bean? I'll watch him in ANYTHING ..most underrated actor in the game..he was Superlative in the 'Hitcher' remake..just awesome..

So all in all? Graci UL'er..Graci!"

Audio is muffled and flat but audible. Video is leached but very much watchable.

This is a fine copy till you get your 1080p fix, when you'll want to re-watch to verify whether it really is the letdown you thought the first time. 

Srsly. Go to 8m15s and watch Sean Bean say words at a picture frame for a taste of this movie's expository grace. "

The first one was way better! The plot for this is also off. In the first one, the dark part of Alessa killed off all the townspeople. But now some somehow managed to survive, even though in the first one ALL of them were in the church...hmmm, WTF?"
,linnie.wesker,2013-02-20T03:33Z,What is that thing that pops up at 1:15:19? Looks like a command prompt but I can't really tell.
,mwalsher,2013-03-24T01:23Z,Why is it listed as being 89 minutes? The other copies are 94 minutes. ఠ_ಠ
,mwalsher,2013-03-24T01:27Z,"@linnie.wesker, I can’t afford the bandwidth to download it just to check (I’m going to get one of the other copies), but I am guessing that the ripper (ViP3R) used a screen-capture tool to copy the contents of their screen, and at some point it, or something else, popped up a window.

Of course this means that this rip is just a re-encode of the web stream instead of the web stream itself. It would have been better to either download the video, or use an RTSP-capture program (and then a video-conversion program like VDub or AviDemux) to get it. By just capturing the decompressed frames as they are shown on screen, it is susceptible to frame-dropping, not to mention re-compression."
