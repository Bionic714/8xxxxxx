it will be proved when they visit it again.. so why so long to visit the moon anyhow :)
didnt they take pictures of the landing site with the jap satellite that orbits? last year?

some say its cos ufos have a base there and told them to leave and not come back

however its possible they modified the photos for a reason like removing ufos from them
and perhaps the landing pad was a fated one
cos the photos they had werent so good or had
too much ufos in the backgrounds lol"
