Lights, Goulding, Action
By Eric Webb

Meet Ellie Goulding. She looks like Gwen StefaniΓÇÖs long-lost little sister. She shaves the side of her head. Her drumming technique sounds like Meg White after chugging a liter of Fanta. SheΓÇÖs romantically linked to Skrillex, which is certainly a life choice that someone could make. Her song ΓÇ£Lights,ΓÇ¥ despite being first released during the Paleolithic Era, climbed the Billboard charts this summer and went triple platinum. She performed at William and KateΓÇÖs wedding. She records some great covers.

All of this is to say that Ellie Goulding is a person it wouldnΓÇÖt hurt to know about. And what better time for ΓÇ£LightsΓÇ¥ to hit it big than right before the release of her second album, Halcyon? In a record that the singer herself called ΓÇ£tribalΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£anthemic,ΓÇ¥ Goulding puts on her best Florence Welch face and makes a stab at her very own Ceremonials, and the result is a some gosh darn pretty electropop.

The heir apparent to the ΓÇ£LightsΓÇ¥ throne is ΓÇ£Anything Can Happen,ΓÇ¥ a study in vocal layering and self-harmonization. GouldingΓÇÖs dusty soprano gets a good workout throughout as a post-produced instrument, her every chirp cut up and reassembled as a hook. ItΓÇÖs got some killer lines, too: ΓÇ£IΓÇÖll give you everything you need/But I donΓÇÖt think I need you.ΓÇ¥ The synth-heavy ΓÇ£Only YouΓÇ¥ recalls Passion Pit and features more vocal trickery, while the excellent ΓÇ£JOYΓÇ¥ gives GouldingΓÇÖs canary-like presence an excellent showcase in a heavenly hymn.

However, thereΓÇÖs a dark edge cutting through Halcyon, first apparent in ΓÇ£My Blood,ΓÇ¥ with a shamanistic, Eurythmics feel. The title track is heart-tugger (ΓÇ£I knew you were a fighter, but you never fought for meΓÇ¥) with some welcome guitar, and on ΓÇ£Hanging On,ΓÇ¥ we get to hear Goulding the Ghost, as her haunted heartache stings like frostbite, arrayed in tinkling strings and spooky backing vocals. At the end, ΓÇ£I Know You CareΓÇ¥ introduces GoudlingΓÇÖs balladeering prowess. ItΓÇÖs affecting.

The big winner on Halcyon, for my money, is ΓÇ£Figure 8.ΓÇ¥ The song is high stakes from top to bottom, with a nerve-wracking sense of danger, some light dubstep and a big buildup. You can tell it would be amazing live. In fact, the entirety of Halcyon flows together so well, even in itΓÇÖs less flashy moments, that it would make a great set list as-is. Make it happen, Ellie. Maybe for the 2032 farewell tour?
