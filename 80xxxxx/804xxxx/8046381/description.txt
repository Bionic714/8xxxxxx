You haven't ridden a bike since you were twelve. Now you want to rediscover the freedom of that two-wheeler. This book is an introduction for you--for adults who haven't ridden in years or aren't riding as much as they want to. Sure, you never forget how to ride a bike, but if you haven't been in a bike shop in years, you will be overwhelmed by all the choices and all the sparkly new machines. How do all the brake designs compare? What sort of frame style is best for your intended riding? This book answers those questions. Also covered are some very basic bike repairs that every rider should master, along with numerous riding tips.
