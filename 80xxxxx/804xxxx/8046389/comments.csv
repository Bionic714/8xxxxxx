Great stuff, gentlemen.
One issue:  the film is probably 20-30% in French (e.g. in the bank @58 min) but the English subtitles aren't there (none throughout the film); my French is ok, but there's a bunch I missed; it's mostly banter, but there's a good bit that's said between the Fr. bankrobbers that (w/VLC player 2.0.5) wasn't there.  I consider it a minor issue, but takes away from enjoying the dialog!
Thanks again, dudes."
,ectoendomezo,2013-01-23T14:19Z,"Sadly upon viewing..no Hardsubs for French Speaking Scenes (essentially the entire 'robbery' sequence) otherwise fine share.

Lack of Hard subs is imho 'THE'..continuing.. Mortal Fatal Flaw with torrents. A Plague.

Take 'Premium Rush' for example..with several short but literally 'Absolutely Critical To The Plot' scenes in Mandarin..and yet after loading 5 different shares..I've yet to find a single version that has the subs.

So okay..yeah..sure..hey..of course..we can sit there with our wireless mouse and switch English Subs 'On' and 'Off' between scenes...but that is in reality Not A Solution. Not, however..a WORTHY solution.

I applaud all UL'ers for their Time and Generosity. Truly. But Hardsubbed Films are THE BEST of torrents. The Real Deal."
,osriccc,2013-02-10T06:47Z,To the one above: HARDSUBS are the worst. English is not everyone's language.
,lostnights,2013-02-28T02:45Z,"I agree subs shouldn't be hard-coded, but at least offer only foreign parts for ""english"" subs so you do not have to have them on the whole time.   There is another version here that says it offers foreign only parts on the subs, but it doesn't line up right to me..  "
,highresjunkie,2013-03-07T10:57Z,"Lostnights is completely wrong. The other version's subs are perfect and the quality is just as good. This is the only version anyone should use if you ask me:
