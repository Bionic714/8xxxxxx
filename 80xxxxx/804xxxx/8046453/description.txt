Windows Firewall Control is a nifty little application which extends the functionality of the Windows Firewall and provides quick access to the most frequent options of Windows Firewall.

Windows Firewall Control offers four filtering modes which can be switched with just a mouse click:
No Filtering ΓÇô Windows Firewall is turned off. Avoid using this setting unless you have another firewall running on your computer.
High Filtering ΓÇô All outgoing connections are blocked. This setting blocks all attempts to connect to and from your computer.
Medium Filtering ΓÇô Outgoing connections that do not match a rule are blocked. Only programs you allow can initiate outgoing connections.
