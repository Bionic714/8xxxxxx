≤     Videographers and filmmakers win by telling a good story. Now you     ≤€

≤     revolutionizes post-production and speeds your sync in seconds        ≤€
≤     rather than days. The new PluralEyes for Mac is a standalone          ≤€
≤     application with a new timeline, visual feedback, and ëtest &         ≤€
≤     tweak' features for quality control. PluralEyes 3 is up to 20x        ≤€
≤     faster than PluralEyes 2, and can easily prepare an audio/video       ≤€
≤     sync for any NLE. For a faster, less tedious and more accurate        ≤€
≤     workflow, use PluralEyes 3 to put the focus back onto creative        ≤€
≤     storytelling.                                                         ≤€

 ≤    One quick note about the version thing in the keygen:                ≤€
 ≤    Version in our keygen should be higher than the version of this      ≤€
 ≤    release. So e.g. if this release is v11.4 you should use v11.5 in    ≤€
 ≤    the keygen. :)                                                       ≤€
