,wil2200,2013-01-21T21:49Z,"Can't get it to work. I removed the previous version. Installed this. Used the 'keygen' but it says it can't find the file.
Then I tried just exporting the license key - but every time Start8 starts up, it deletes the key...
Not sure what the deal is...."

,JosePetrOFF,2013-01-25T19:19Z,"Nope,still not working on a 8x64 Pro - 'can't open file' "
,JosePetrOFF,2013-01-25T19:25Z,Ignore my last - my problem appears to be Windows-related and not patch related - I followed the instructions on  my other laptop and it worked the first time around :)
,SunnyBay,2013-01-26T14:18Z,"This is sure to work for everyone:

Install Start8 by running start8-setup.exe
- Close the trial start window

Open Task Manager
-End all Start8/Stardock tasks
-Restart Explorer.exe

*IMPORTANT*: After restarting explorer.exe the Start8 Menu should disappear from the left corner toolbar

Run keygen.exe

-Save license to folder C:ProgramDataStardockRegistrations
-The license key will be named like 'start8sig1234.bin'

- Apply patch to Start8.exe in this folder C:Program Files (x86)StardockStart8

- After a few seconds you will see a message popup ""Yep ! File Successfully Patched""

Restart the Operating System
- Done !"
,jpmcnown,2013-02-03T00:51Z,"I can confirm that NONE of the instructions above work with Windows 8 Pro 32 bit. Ya get a ""Error =( Can't open file"""
,Panzer_IV,2013-02-06T07:29Z,"I just uninstalled my expired Trial, reinstalled latest version and it still said expired as I expected.. then I followed exactly the instruction from (SunnyBay) just above my comment and it worked flawlessly.

Obviously it won't be able to overwrite if you don't kill the application/service first (-_-) cmon guys it's really easy."
[T],geloso,2013-02-07T01:26Z,"Os cuento como lo he hecho yo y me ha funcionado:
-Desinstalar la version anterior
-Cerrar y volver a abrir el explorador de windows y borrar el directorio c:Archivos de Programa(x86)Stardock
-Instalar Start8 y cerrar la ventana de activacion.
-Ejecutar el keygen como admin. y guardar la licencia (No cerrar el keygen)
-Ctrl+Alt+Sup: Administrador de tareas: Finalizar todas las tareas Start8 en procesos
-Finalizar tarea explorer.exe en la pestaña Detalles.
-Aplicar ""patch"" del keygen
-Reiniciar el sistema

I tell you as I have done and it has worked:
-Uninstall the previous version
-Close and reopen Windows Explorer and delete the C: Program Files (x86)  Stardock
-Install and close the window Start8 activation.
-Run the keygen as admin. and save the license (not close the keygen)
-Ctrl + Alt + Sup: Task Manager: End all tasks in processes Start8
-End Task explorer.exe on the Details tab.
-Apply ""patch"" the keygen
-Reboot"
,h3atz_br,2013-02-07T09:29Z,Don't forget to execute keygen with administrative privileges or he can't path the start8.exe file
,voltron0,2013-02-21T14:20Z,"I kept getting the ""Error =( Can't open file""  no matter what I did, I finally copied the entire start8 directory to my desktop, then patched it and volla it worked... I then just deleted the old dir and copied in the one from my desktop. I hope this helps some people"
,q2323,2013-02-28T16:42Z,"AVG says Trojan, MSE says nothing, anyways, doesnt work with the instructions provided. 

Instrucitons from morph3x may work."
,Fahkeye,2013-03-03T03:16Z,"this works on 32 bit win 8,  i had everything done but when i patched it said cant open file, i read geloso instruction and the thing i missed was killing explorer. once i did that the keygen worked  thanks to all. "
,mizar,2013-03-03T22:25Z,I followed the instructions from SunnyBay and it worked flawlessly. Don´t forget to kill windows explorer in task manager. Thanks to all of you! This is file sharing!
