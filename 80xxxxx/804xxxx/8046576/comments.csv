Though I am wondering if this is a web rip since the video does have the Nick logo on the video and at the beginning you see the words 'New Spongebob'.

If this was a Web Rip/DL then the logos would not be there. I am guess that ths is a TV rip then.

Any which way, I appreciate this video since I have never seen this episode."
,DaveorDavid,2013-01-21T13:47Z,Webrip since i found this on web (forgot the site).
,DaveorDavid,2013-01-21T14:07Z,@isos4ever any episodes? Requests??
,gur0ch4m,2013-01-21T22:54Z,"@DaveorDavid Since you're offering so nicely, I just can't seem to find a properly working episode of ""Whatever happened to Spongebob"" / ""WhoBob WhatPants"" (Season 5 Episode 18 ?) and ""Pest of the West"" (Season 5 Episode 16 ?). They're both double-length episodes and all the ones I've been able to find have either been horribly out of sync or russian. So that'd be greatly appreciated. And thanks for contributing :)"
,DaveorDavid,2013-01-22T00:18Z,K. I'll try.
