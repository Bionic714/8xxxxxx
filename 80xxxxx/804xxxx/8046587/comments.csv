Put it on ABC or better yet stick it on Hulu and you're more likely to get some better viewership numbers. Their main audience isn't little kids who liked Tron Legacy. It's college age kids who are drawn in by the visuals and the story, people who can't access Disney XD. For the love of the Grid, this show deserves more than the cancellation it almost certainly will get."
