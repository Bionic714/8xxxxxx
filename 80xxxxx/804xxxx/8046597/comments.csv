,profodes,2013-01-31T17:19Z,"First of all, Thanks for the upload!!

I'm experiencing the following problem:
When I try to open a chart in Jeppesen FD I can find the field which I want to see. For example EHGG.
But then I get the this message:
""Chart Library Problem - The requested chart is nog in the library.""
Does someone know how I can fix this problem?

BTW... I can open the charts in Jeppesen TC.
But because I like the highlight function in the new version of FD I would like to open them in FD too.

Thanks in advance,
Profodes"
[T],_SnakEye,2013-02-03T19:27Z,"""V1RotateV2"" published a method which I am basing mines on, making ""Enroute (latest version) work on your iPad Device. This less complicated and/or without the need to re copy ""Enroute"" folder twice on your iPad Device.
I've been able to make run 1302 FULLY, under IOS 6.1 and JeppViewFD v2.0
- download JeppView from APPLE store.
- Open it once, without having updated anything.
- Close it completely (with X)
- Copy only TermCharts from 1301.
- Erase 'Enroute' Charts folder (if exists)
- On your PC, Copy the following files from 1213 into your 1302 at the same tree structure:
	* Enroute/db_a/store/appedoc_store_1.lock
	* Enroute/db_a/store/appenr_store_1.lock
	* Enroute/db_b/store/appedoc_store_1.lock
	* Enroute/db_b/store/appenr_store_1.lock
- Now, just copy the 1302 Enroute folder onto your iPad device 
- If you want to enable VFR Terminal Charts, create your own airportlist.bin file (need jepp.exe application and JeppView for Windows)
- Overwrite the older airportlist.bin with newer one in TermCharts
- Copy FROM ""C:ProgramData/Jeppesen/Common/TerminalCharts"" TO your IPAD folder ""JeppFD/Documents/data/TermCharts""
these files: vfrcharts.bin, vfrchrts.dbf, vfrntms.dbf and vfrntms.dbt.

* Note 1: This procedure is not absolute to v1302, this can be done on later versions to come as well.
* Note 2: vfrcharts.bin must be writen in LOWERCASE letters, NOT IN CAPITALS.
* Note 3: Google to find jepp.exe application and it's manual.

Voila! FULL JeppFD ;-)"
[T],_SnakEye,2013-02-04T12:32Z,BTW - I just tested the same procedure on JeppFD Cycle 1303 and it works fine.
