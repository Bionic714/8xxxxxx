,storm2012,2013-01-21T12:26Z,"Hey psspss, the way you are listing these episodes are correct going by information i had got from both  t.v. websites & wikipedia but i must say it is confusing to say the least with how some of these shows get listed. Anyway thanks for the U/L"
[V],psspss,2013-01-21T12:57Z,"the production site is even confusing doesnt seem to have a tv guide or seasons listed
alone give current title names and first air times"
