,mistercrayle,2013-03-15T22:30Z,"Why would you fools attempt download a re-uploaded version of this? Look at the files included, it's no different than what ChingLiu has uploaded. "
,krg102,2013-04-08T18:30Z,Anyone know whether this version does not give iLok issues with AAX plugins like Guitar Rig?
,lurchin,2013-05-03T15:36Z,"@mistercrayle actually ChingLiu's version did not have the MF error cracked, this was done by a user in audioz.info and is included in Mukundas' patch. But the best way currently is still using the original patches as described in audioz.info, because Mukundas added ""funny"" texts by a nut who called himself Anonymous, thus changing the actual program interface. The original audioz.info patched version runs perfectly, just no AAX plugins or MP3 bounce, but that is a small trade-off for an otherwise great program."
