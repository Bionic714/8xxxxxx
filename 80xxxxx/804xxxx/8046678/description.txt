Imelda May's 2011 Album More Mayhem

Imelda May, born in Dublin and raised in the Liberties, may be an unknown name to some, but to many she is already a superstar. She is unmistakable both in her music (a fusion of surf guitars, blues and rockabilly that wouldnΓÇÖt be out of place in a David Lynch film) and her style, with a solitary curl and shock of blonde in her jet black hair.
