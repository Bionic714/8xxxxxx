The core rulebook for Hellas RPG as well as the Princes of the Universe and Worlds of Sun and Stone books. These are not mine, I got them from Demonoid before that shut down and hadn't seen them on here. As always, seed and enjoy!

Publisher Description:

HELLAS is an epic, generational space opera that spans 100 years of the fourth and final age of the Hellenes, a spacefaring race that has warred for control of their galaxy for countless millennia. The player characters are Heroes who will set off to save their worlds from an ancient threat. They will live, triumph, suffer, and eventually die as Heroes, either achieving apotheosis and ascending into immortality, or succumbing to their fate.

HELLAS is greatly inspired by the heroic stories of ancient Greece and uses Greek-inspired language, themes, and tropes. However, HELLAS is not Greek, nor is its characters presumed to be living in some distant future or bygone past based on our own reality, any more than a fantasy RPG based on European mythology is based on a real medieval Europe.
