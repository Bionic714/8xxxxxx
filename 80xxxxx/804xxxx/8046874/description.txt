--WARNING: THIS IS WINDOWS VISTA--
Windows Vista can cause suicidal thoughts, feelings of
depression, nerd rage, slow hard-drives, and T.F.K Syndrome.
You've been warned.

murphy78 sadly presents Windows Vista SP2 AIO 18in1 DaRT8
This release contains updates up to Jan08-2013, patch day

No Windows Vista Settings were mercy-killed in the making of this ISO.
No Programs are added to the Windows installs.
No Unattended Settings were added to the installation.
No Registry Settings were modified.

Microsoft Diagnostics and Recovery Toolset 8 included in boot options.
Features include System File Scan, Recovery, Backup restore,
Offline hotfix removal, disk cleaning and repartitioning, etc.
Initial Boot Setup is a little sluggish. It is from the amount of
content in the install.wim. It clears up when selecting partition.
Sluggish behavior is from the vista boot.wim, not DaRT8.
(Thank anarchist9027 for this AIO addition)

---For Pre-Activated:
OEM Branding adds your system brand logo in the first slot
of the User Pictures choices, replacing the flower.
OEM Branding adds system logos in a few operating system
windows. (Computer properties, etc)
OEM multi-brand activation attempts to see if it can install
activation files on your system. SLiC 2.0 and supported BIOS
is required for this.
setupcomplete.cmd script checks your activation, and if this
branding could not find a suitable match for your system,
setup installs Windows Loader 2.2 with the default options.
If you have problems with this, Get Windows Loader, run it,
and click the uninstall. Then try using Windows Loader with
different advanced options. Read the text for info on them.
(Big thanks to searchengine and daz for their work)
(Thanks also to anarchist9027 for helping me with activation
check scripting)

NETFX 4.5 could not be installed as it requires an online MSU
hotfix, and you cannot install those during setup in Vista.
I have included a folder in the ISO called Net45
Inside is the net45 redistributable and the 3 hotfixes.
I have included a script command to install all 4 without
needing any input. The net45 installer will automatically
install the missing msu file.

Condolances Pirates,
