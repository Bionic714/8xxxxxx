Release Notes
Artist : Dio                           Rating : You Decide!
Album  : Dios Inferno The Last In Live abel  : SPV
Description :
One aspect of the live CD that is often ignored
is it's function as a testimonial to the
artist's ability to put on a great show. It is
not a substitute for being at the concert, nor
does it contain the visual aspect that a DVD
would, but it is a piece of history preserved
for the sake of those who could not view the
tour in question. In the field of putting on a
great show, Dio has never waivered, even as he
enters his 60s he is still going on as strong as
ever.
However, even the greatest of performances can
be tainted if the play itself is not of the
highest caliber, and here lies the flaw in this
album. This is taken from the trough of Dio's
fall from significance in the realm of music
(before the resurgence that occurred with
Magica's release), the Angry Machines tour. As
such, we have two tracks from Dio's weakest
release, accompanied by an overloaded collection
of early work from the first 2 studio albums and
Ronnie's past work with Rainbow.
Although all parties in question perform well,
the lack of anything new or fresh on here is
quite disappointing, though not unexpected. If
you replaced the Angry Machines songs and
"Jesus, Mary and the Holy Ghost" with songs from
the Sacred Heart album, you would have the exact
same set list that can be found on the Sacred
Heart video. All of this screams out a single
message, Dio is considered a has been and thus
is limited to playing only the classics.
One advantage to this CD, however, is that
because of Tracey G's radically different
approach to soloing and his highly dark sound we
get a radically different take on many of the
older Dio material. "Holy Diver" and "Heaven and
Hell" sound much more doom oriented than on any
other live compilation containing these
classics. "The Last in Line" has a more agitated
sounding solo, probably because it's a difficult
solo to pull off so Tracey retailored it to fit
his own style.
Out of all the material covered on here, the
material off the "Holy Diver" and "Last in Line"
albums are the strongest. The two best songs on
here are "Straight through the Heart" and "We
Rock". By contrast, the Rainbow material and
"Heaven and Hell" are performed quite poorly.
"Man on the Silver Mountain" is played way too
damn fast, and up until Doug Aldrich joined the
band for the Killing the Dragon tour, they never
lived up to the dramatic studio version of
Heaven and Hell.
The newer stuff is a mixed bag, owing mainly to
inconsistencies between the 2 albums that Tracey
G had played on before hand. "Jesus, Mary, and
the Holy Ghost" is a stand up performance, well
worthy of being the opener of the show. "Double
Monday" is not bad, it's one of the less
disjointed and confused songs off of Angry
Machines. "Hunter of the Heart" is an utter bore
fest, owing completely to it just being a lousy
song. You could have Tony Iommi play this song
and it would still suck.
In conclusion, I can't really give this live
album a strong recommendation because of the
large number of alternatives out there,
particularly in the video format. The release
onto DVD of footage from the tours of the first
two albums would be preferrable to this,
although more recent fans of Dio should probably
pick up "Evil or Divine" on DVD. This CD may
find a home with core Dio fans who liked Tracey
G's playing style, but it's recommended audience
is not large by any standard.
