Release Notes
Artist : Dio                           Rating : You Decide!
Album  : Stand Up And Shout The Anthologybel  : Rhino
Description :
Every once in a while a greatest hits collection
comes around that will be an absolute must have
for any fan of a band, one that contains all the
right amount of perks and rarities to entice the
most hardcore fan, yet still contain all the
necessary hits to rope in the casual listener.
Stand Up and Shout lives up to its name by
shouting one thing to the potential buyer, If
you buy me you will get it all!! You get every
era spanning Dios career since the early 70s
with Elf up until his last great effort in the
1990s Strange Highways.
As someone who was an already established
enthusiast for Dios Sabbath and solo work at
the time, my main reason for getting this
release was the Elf and Rainbow material, the
former of which I was 100% unexposed to while
the latter had only been touched upon due to
live performances and one greatest hits
compilation.
The Elf material, for its time, is quite an
innovative fusion of blues and rock that
requires a bit of historical perspective in
order to grasp. When you consider that the
heaviest thing going on at the time was Black
Sabbath and that they were considered an
aberration, this is quite hard edged stuff and a
path can been seen to where Dio would grow into
what he is now.
The Rainbow stuff includes the obvious tour
favorites Long Live Rock and Roll and Man on
the Silver Mountain, as well as the only
slightly less well known Starstruck. Although
these songs are all a great listen and rock
hard, I had hoped that more epic tracks such as
Gates of Babylon would have made it onto here,
but of course those tracks are to be found on
Rainbow compilations.
The Black Sabbath stuff is presented
chronologically, which is a breath of fresh air
as most Sabbath compilations are dreadfully
unorganized. You have all the essentials from
both the early 80s era as well as the strongest
song from the 1992 reunion in Computer God. We
also get a great live version of Voodoo from
the Mob Rules tour back in 1982 that qualifies
as a genuine rarity.
Dios solo material has also been well organized
and includes pretty much all the no-brainer
tracks from the first two albums. We get a live
version of Sacred Heart from the famous tour
that spawned the Video concert carrying the same
name, definitely a great perk for the Dio fan
that already has most of the discography. To my
relief, the Dream Evil material was not given
the shaft and the two best songs from it are
found on here. Likewise, both Lock up the Wolves
and Strange Highways managed to get their title
tracks onto this compilation, rounding out the
tail end of a career that spanned more than 20
years at that point.
To the prospective buyer who is looking for some
stuff with Ronnie Dio attached to it that is not
found on the LPs, as well as the fan of metal
who wishes an introduction to the artist, this
is the album to go for. It listens extremely
well owing to it being well organized and all of
the songs being digitally remastered, which is
more than what I can say for the majority of the
large amount of Dio greatest hits CDs out there.
Get yourself a copy today and be prepared to
Stand up and Shout.
