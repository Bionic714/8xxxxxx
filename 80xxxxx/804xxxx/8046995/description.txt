IMPORTANT :
The size of the file is NOT an absolute indicator of the quality of the video !

As for this file, it should look better than the source (DVD collection Criterion "Early Bergman"). It retains its detail while removing most of the spots, some of the scratches and most of the excessive noise that had made its way from the old film to the DVD.
As imperfections are removed, so is a lot of (undesirable) data, which explains -along with good x264 encoding- how you can obtain such good quality at such a low bitrate.

Many Bergman movies should follow, chronlogically tough not each one needs a new encode.

"Bergman's neorealist, Gothenburg-set drama is the story of BeritΓÇôan emotionally vulnerable young woman recently out of a reformatory and with an abusive motherΓÇôwho is seen first attempting suicide by diving off the docks, then protesting furiously when she is rescued. A chance of happiness seems to present itself when she meets a dock worker at a dance, but first she must reconcile him to her troubled past and vicious-tongued mother. Bergman makes excellent use of his gritty, sea-front locations and doesn't shirk from showing the drudgery and misery his protagonists endure in their day-to-day lives."
