You know what? IΓÇÖm in Adult Pop mode this week. And thereΓÇÖs nothing wrong with that, especially if youΓÇÖre an adult. IΓÇÖve been listening to Scars on 45, the group out of Bradford, England, for several months now, and with the release of their debut LP (self titled) last Tuesday, I canΓÇÖt help but think theyΓÇÖre on the verge of blowing up.

If you like The Fray, quit reading right now and buy this album. If you donΓÇÖt like The Fray at all, or are just kinda ambivalentΓÇª then keep reading? I guess it would be nice if someone read this.

To say the lads and lass of Scars on 45 remind me of the Denver quartet known for mix station mainstays ΓÇ£Over My Head (Cable Car)ΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£How to Save a LifeΓÇ¥ isnΓÇÖt much of a stretch. In fact, itΓÇÖs a necessary evil that I need to get out of the way early. For one thing, theyΓÇÖve both been featured on GreyΓÇÖs Anatomy. The lead single from the GreyΓÇÖs Vol. 4 Soundtrack that will have moms across America swooning is ΓÇ£Heart on Fire,ΓÇ¥ batting third on the Scars LP and packing a mature piano-pop sound. Also English accents. Swoon!

None of that is meant to be condescending, because I really like ScarsΓÇÖ sound. It helps that they have a lady vocalist, Aimee Driver, who provides beautiful harmonies and takes the lead on some verses and the occasional entire song (ΓÇ£Change My NeedsΓÇ¥). The balance between her and lead singer Danny Bemrose makes for some great natural romantic undertones to songs that are, largely, about romance.

Most of the tracks on the album have a similar mix: piano, acoustic guitar, and a chorus of harmonizing vocals; mellow electric riffs; bass lines that complement everything else. Scars arenΓÇÖt afraid to wear their influences on their sleeve ΓÇô read: Oasis, Augustana, etcΓÇª but theyΓÇÖre not knock-offs either, and the fact that theyΓÇÖre able to match up sonically to such accomplished acts is an impressive feat for a band so fresh on the popular music scene.

Bemrose didnΓÇÖt even consider a career in music until a foot injury cut his professional soccer career short some twelve years ago, at which point he met up with another former player in Stuart Nichols. Bemrose and Nichols began learning guitar and bass, respectively, lighting the fuse to what would eventually become Scars on 45. Keyboardist David Nowakowski and drummer Chris Durling were added and material soon started coming together. Their first gig as a band came in 2007, the same year they added Aimee Driver, who had never sung for an audience before then.

For a time the band was confined to mostly smaller gigs in England, but as of late things have really begun to pick up steam: a label signing; features on GreyΓÇÖs Anatomy, CSI: New York, One Tree Hill, and other shows; a musical guest appearance on The Tonight Show With Jay Leno; and an iTunes single of the week (ΓÇ£Burn the House DownΓÇ¥). Scars on 45 are a band thatΓÇÖs easy to root for, so itΓÇÖs great to see all their hard work paying off.

There arenΓÇÖt a lot of risks taken on this album, but there doesnΓÇÖt need to be. At least not right now. ItΓÇÖs beautiful of itΓÇÖs own merit, and thereΓÇÖs no reason not to believe theyΓÇÖre heading for stardom soon. The emotion of the music is effortless, genuine and instantly stirring. Scars are able to separate themselves from The Fray with their ability to spread catchy songs across the entire album and not just concentrate the hooks in a couple singles. Also with the great accents and far more pleasing vocals. That said, ΓÇ£Heart on FireΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£BeautyΓÇÖs Running WildΓÇ¥ are the strongest tracks on the album. HereΓÇÖs the video for the first:

So maybe this musical style isnΓÇÖt in your wheelhouse, or maybe itΓÇÖs right up your alleyΓÇª ladies. Regardless, definitely give Scars on 45 a chance, because theyΓÇÖre a great band with the natural talent to justify their early success and the work ethic to keep it going.
