,higherleopards,2013-01-21T21:14Z,Thank you!! I've been trying to find this for awhile. 
,crucius,2013-01-25T13:53Z,"Thank you very much for uploading this, but please describe a bit further how to make it work. I followed the instructions you provided and the game asks to connect to the internet..."
,ZoomStop,2013-01-25T17:00Z,"Works great if you follow the posted directions!
The modded Google Play can be downloaded here:

,zonecode,2013-01-28T01:14Z,"Is it possible to get some clarified instructions?
I don't understand what "">"" means.  Anyone?"
,ap2882,2013-01-28T04:15Z,> means greater than. Simple 3rd grade math. We need bobiras to provide a non-rooted solution...
,zonecode,2013-01-29T03:58Z,Yea by posting that comment I learned that & g t with quotations around it makes a greater than sign.  Thanks for telling me what grade I should have learned that in.  
,saikorican,2013-01-29T16:58Z,"Idk man the instructions were pretty clear to me. Thanks for the download btw, I needed a better game for my S3"
,KaraSakal,2013-01-31T01:46Z,"Followed instructions. After opening with modded playstore I'm basically stuck at the download screen for a couple of minutes. THEN, it boots me out of the download screen and a notification above says""FF Dimensions Looking for resources to download""."
,bruss1988,2013-01-31T11:29Z,"Im getting the Resources download thing.

Also you need to open the RAR file while it is on your computer before you transfer it to the folders on phone."
,bruss1988,2013-02-07T10:42Z,So youre just going to ignore our cries for help!? I am stuck at the download screen. I followed everything perfectly and it does not work. I am using GS2.
,justonemore65,2013-02-09T08:37Z,"I also followed the directions, got FF installed with titanium, opened with the cracked Google play store, moved the file to Android/obb (This folder didnt exist so I created it). 

Ive tried constantly to get this game to work and do know what Im doing with these kinds of things. 

I get the same problem as others, it says it needs to connect to internet, when it does theres a white screen loading and it loops until it closes with an error. 

Ive got a rooted TBolt with ICS 4.0.4 running.

Anyone get this working that can provide the rest of us with some kind of update on how they got it to work? 

Thanks "
,justonemore65,2013-02-09T20:56Z,"So apparently if I tried to move the ***ffl_gp folder while the phone was in developer mode, it wouldnt recognize that I had placed a new folder and the game wouldnt run properly until I disabled that, reinstalled, moved the folder over to the obb folder once more, then finally opened the game. 

After that I was able to finally get the game to run, been playing for 10m now with no problems, thanks for the upload! "
,zonecode,2013-02-15T03:59Z,"Yes justonemore65 you're right.  I find that if you run the game once then exit before you move the obb file folder to where it goes in android/obb/... 
Then run the game again and after that it works.
I think it deletes the folder inside obb the first time it runs."
,maikel,2013-02-15T06:20Z,Will there come a version of this that works for non rooted devices?
,Vahn7302,2013-02-21T08:31Z,"Trying to run on Xperia Play, briefly says ""FF Dimensions Looking for resources to download"" before Force Closing immediately. Any ideas on how to fix? "
