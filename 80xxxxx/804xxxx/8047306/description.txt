PROPER NOTES:

Test.Drive.Ferrari.Racing.Legends-SKIDROW was released with a "Loader"  and
not a cracked exe.  This is  why  you  see  the  original  exe  renamed  to
"TDFerrari_o.exe".  As this is not allowed and in  this  case  considerably
slows down the game with Xlive messages  while  starting  and  playing  the
game, you can see why we have included a proper cracked.  SKIDROW  use  the
loader to bypass the steam "bind" stub to  not  have  to  bypass  the  G4WL
integrity checks and hence leaving the drm intact.  Our crack is completely
null of these issues with SKIDROW's loader approach.  The  game  starts  up
quite considerably faster and has no mention of  xlive  problems  with  our
crack being used.
We have also included a source code of how Skidrow's pathetic  approach  to
this game was implemented.
For those interested in viewing this its included here:
