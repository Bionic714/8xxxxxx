,bonding,2013-01-23T13:22Z,"Activated Windows 8 Pro with Media Centre too. The only problem I've noticed is that once you activate Windows 8 Pro, you cannot upgrade to 8 Pro WMC. Other than that, good work."
,James0775,2013-01-26T07:36Z,Worked like a charm. Thanks so much
,FireIsHot,2013-01-26T10:19Z,"THANK YOU! I just did a fresh install, upgraded to WMC and then realized it was more or less a patch to prevent activation via KMS!

Anyways I stumbled upon this, ran it, my computer restarted, signed in, cmd ran for a sec, then everything popped up saying it was activated. :) __ I'll comment if anything changes.

,sconnell80,2013-02-03T17:54Z,I tried using the activator and after restart it made my screen black and never loaded up my desktop or start page. I ran SFC /SCANNOW to fix the problem and then it restarted and never activated my windows 8 pro with media center. Wish it would of worked.
,kristina111,2013-02-07T03:35Z,"Thansk for this,

 I am not sure if this is working for me.

I have seen Windows is not activated in the system > properties.

Do someone know about it. I have successfully customized the start screen and watermark is gone.

Someone guide."

,devanika3,2013-03-27T05:43Z,holy moly i have downloaded a lot of stuff but this has got to be the fastest download ever thanks :)
,eviltib,2013-04-09T03:48Z,I downloaded it and it activated my windows 8 just fine but when I download anything I get disconnected from my internet and I have to change the port my wireless card goes into. Anyone know if that is a card problem or a windows problem?
