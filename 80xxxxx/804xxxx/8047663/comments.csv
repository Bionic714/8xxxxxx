It is as easy to make a torrent from a directory tree of individual files as it is to make a torrent from a RAR version of the same directory tree.

If you make the post from individual files, then people can examine the file list and verify that it is legitimate.  Can't do that with a RAR file.

And your past posts show a history of dropping the ball on seeding before the torrents complete, so why waste my time on a big RAR file when there's no guarantee you'll seed long enough to finish?"
,Ashaar,2013-01-21T19:56Z,"Don't be so upset, I' am sorry if I ever offended you. This torrent is in rar because there are too many books in it so I avoided the long list. These are good and rare books, go for them mate if you find even 10 books of your liking I think purpose of downloading will be fulfilled."
,kkaucher,2013-01-22T01:15Z,"And, just as LemonJ-Lo predicted, you've seeded half the file and vaporized into the ether. You can have your RAR file, ""mate!"""
,frobknob,2013-01-22T08:21Z,"I agree: posting a bunch of books as a single RAR is a pain in the ass and needlessly wastes bandwidth - which *some* people have to pay for. Particularly when some of the files are going to be dupes of stuff people already have, or stuff they have no interest in.

Please reconsider posting torrents with individual files so people can pick and choose what they want to d/l and seed."
,Ashaar,2013-01-22T10:14Z,"Ok, I will repost and also please open this file with 7zip so that you have all the books because some have titles more than 260 characters."
