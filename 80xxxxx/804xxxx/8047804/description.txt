Frédéric François Chopin or Fryderyk Franciszek Chopin (1 March or 22 February
1810 – 17 October 1849) was a Polish composer and virtuoso pianist. He is widely
considered one of the greatest Romantic composers. Chopin was born in Żelazowa
Wola, a village in the Duchy of Warsaw. A renowned child-prodigy pianist and
composer, he grew up in Warsaw and completed his music education there; he
composed many of his mature works in Warsaw before leaving Poland in 1830 at
age 20, shortly before the November 1830 Uprising.
