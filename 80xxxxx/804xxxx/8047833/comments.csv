After installation, only icon on desktop is ""UDC Output File"" which is just a folder and not the main window of a Converter...I mean....I can't activate it, nowhere to put the key. Please, help me activate it. "

There doesn't appear to be any actual program to run to activate after installing this - I only get a virtual printer added my printer list which, without activation, adds an ugly ass NOT ACTIVETED graphic to anything converted.

please advice"
