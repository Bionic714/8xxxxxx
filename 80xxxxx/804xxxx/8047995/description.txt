I initially began providing these free karate downloads to help support my students. Eventually I started sharing them freely with the world to help promote a more positive perception of martial arts in general. Also, I try to educate people as much as possible about martial arts, fitness, and health. This is because I have found that there is a lot of crap information out there about martial arts and fitness, and so much more good information. As a result, I ended up sifting through a lot of different articles and books, as well as trying out many different exercises and routines, and taking classes from different instructors. I wanted to make sure I could distill all of this experience into what works and how to progress in martial arts and fitness. The files in this torrent are the result. Please visit my home page to keep up with my latest news and research.
