This is a full scan with printing instructions to produce the full workbook at use in many Geology programs so that you don't get suckered into paying a bunch of money for a book that is just printed and handed to you anyway.  Find a friend with a laser printer and print the damn thing yourself.  Or find a friend with mad skills and a huge auto-feeding scanner who will scan, assemble in InDesign, export into PDF and then make a textfile of printing instructions so you know what page ranges to print in color (duplexed) and black and white (duplexed) to assemble your own workbook.
