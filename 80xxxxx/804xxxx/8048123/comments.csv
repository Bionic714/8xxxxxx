Incorrect source file"" 

and 

""An Error occured during updating multiDataPC_AC#MP_Fort_Wolcott.forge.""


AFTER THAT UPDATE CRASH. Game working without new crack so I think is not updated.  

Game is NOT installed on disc C. 

Source of Game: rld-aiii.iso

,Mostafa95,2013-01-23T14:44Z,First of all the crack didn't work after uninstalling and reinstanlling the game 10 times the crack worked but another problem appeared it ruined the deluxe dlc and the save help
,Mostafa95,2013-01-23T14:55Z,"the crack worked after a day of uninstalling and reinstalling but ruined the save and the deluxe ( the game isn't installed on the C )
help please"
,MLO89,2013-01-23T19:19Z,I couldn't even get the update to install. Gave me a message saying it was not compatible with this version. Got same message trying the RELOADED 1.02 update. I have the Black Box version. Looks like I'm fucked.
,Lobuno,2013-01-24T14:45Z,"This works GREAT with RELOADED release!!!
Been playing a few hours with no problem.

WARNING: Remember to tune down Anti-Aliasing settings in game menu if you are experiencing graphical glitches.

The game is a bit boring till you re in 5-6 hours of ""intro"" gameplay.

Uplay is shit. Uplay offline functions are also shit."
,RVG90,2013-01-25T10:28Z,Best way to get this working is to do a fresh install of Skidrow's version WITHOUT APPLYING ANY OTHER CRACKS just the one that comes with the update.
,XHaloXX,2013-01-25T11:53Z,You dont need this update. it just fixes few bugs in SP and doesnt fix any of performance nor FPS issues. this update mainly for MP to include the core functionality for Battle Hardened Pack DLC and its useless here. i own the game and didnt notice any change on SP except few bugs fixed. nothing major actually
,silviu_bs,2013-01-25T14:00Z,Ok so i installed this update and lost my savegames( after playing for about 2 hours)... Does anybody know how to get them back. I would appreciate any help with this issue.
,themike10452,2013-01-25T23:58Z,Could anyone please extract this update and post in a torrent so we can use it on RG Mechanics/Black Box Edition?? Thanks!
,RanY2jith,2013-01-26T19:37Z,Themike - Use 7zip and extract the files :)
,MLO89,2013-01-29T20:08Z,7zip cannot unpack this exe in a usable way.
,Scorpioz6,2013-02-09T06:33Z,"Useless Update with alot of problems , don't download it ..."
,Dewarton,2013-02-16T19:28Z,"DO download it, don't listen to the noobs...
Works perfect, the only thing is UPlay stays in english no matter what language is your OS :)"
,hippo2432,2013-02-20T00:38Z,"so i put the original crack in, the install didn't work then i did a fresh install without putting the release crack in and i still get the error that it can't find the folder location. any help would be appreciated."
,hippo2432,2013-02-20T00:45Z,oh i forgot to mention i have the skidrow release.
,Skyduxx,2013-03-24T01:45Z,"It says that it is not compatible with the game installed or somethin' 
I have a ""R.G. Mechanics"" release

Help me, please"
