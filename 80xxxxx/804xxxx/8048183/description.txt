The Sharma brothers consist of former boxer,    
Brijmohan; Jagmohan, an Electrical Engineer;    
and Manmohan, a Mechanic. The brothers operate  
a garage under the name of 'Mohan Brothers' in  
Bombay. Brijmohan hates all women and does not  
permit even a poster to be hung on the walls of 
either the garage or their residence as well as 
instructs his brothers not to get involved with 
them. While working the late shift, Manmohan    
assists a customer, Renu, and both rather       
dramatically fall in love. Subsequently,        
Jagmohan meets with Renu's friend, Sheila,      
and both are attracted to each other. Unable    
to face the wrath of their brother,             
both conceal this information from him.
