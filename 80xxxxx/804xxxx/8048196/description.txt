The Perfect Vagina
After having watched Channel 4 - Penis Envy, it's now time to move on to lesson two and have a look at women's insecurities: The Perfect Vagina.
Fronted by Lisa Rogers, this documentary focuses on the rise in vaginal cosmetic surgery, specifically labiaplasty. For the uninitiated, labiaplasty involves cutting off the inner labia so that they don't 'hang' below the outer labia. Ouch! The labiaplasty business has skyrocketed over the past few years, and Lisa's mission was to find out why so many women hate the appearance of their vulvas to the point that they'd willingly have pieces of them surgically removed.
