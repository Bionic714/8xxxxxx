A dying Thakur Surjeet Singh bequeaths the            
entire estate to his son, Raghuvir, disowning         
the other, Dhurjan, the family's black sheep,         
who also indulges in black magic. The latter          
swears to use magical powers to usurp the estate,     
and even arranges the abduction of Raghuvir's         
daughters, Sapna and Aarti. Mangal and his men       
manage to apprehend Dhurjan, imprison him in a       
dungeon, and rescue Aarti. However, they are unable
to locate Sapna, and Raghuvir gets killed. Before  
dying, he informs Mangal that Sapna has one of two
pieces of a locket around her neck, while the other
is on Aarti's, and when joined together will reveal  
the location of a treasure buried in a dungeon. 20
years later, Aarti and her boyfriend, Vijay, along  
with several others, will attempt to unearth this 
treasure - not realizing that they not only face      
betrayal from one of their own, but will also release 
and fall prey to an ageless and indestructible entity.
