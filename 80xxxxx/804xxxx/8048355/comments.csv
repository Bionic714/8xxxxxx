I have been looking for this for a long time, my kids will be thrilled.
Is it easy to convert flv files to mp3 or avi? or is it not unnecessary?"
,legoblox,2013-02-13T10:43Z,"Kyouki85, thank you so much for this upload, I have been looking for this for ages.
Kids have watched the first episode and a/v is excellent.
Unfortunately most of ""202 Ascent of The Red Sentients, Part 2"" is missing, should have guessed as the file is only 69mb.
Kyouki85 are you able to upload this episode separately? and put a link to it on this page.

Does anyone know a program to convert these flv files to avi or mp3?"
,legoblox,2013-02-16T00:36Z,"Episodes 223 & 224 fps is only 5 not 25 so is very jumpy.
have downloaded ""any video converter"" from Cnet, a free program to convert these flv files to avi or whatever.
Best youtube version of 202 that I have found is one by Codezt17 its about 140mb and is not cropped like many versions."
