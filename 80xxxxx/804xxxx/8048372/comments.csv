,Taosinky,2013-01-21T21:05Z,@Mr.Stifmeister : Dont care. I prefer Heromaster upload. :D
,omegaviper,2013-01-21T21:15Z,yeah but you're dumb and messed up on the first one then left it there 
,ijam_j,2013-01-22T03:59Z,"@Mr.Stifmeister
So what? Uploading first doesnt mean youre better or anything of that sort. To me, you just told me what kind of childish immature kid that you are. GTFO with you and your uploads."
,SergioFCPorto,2013-01-22T04:25Z,thanks

,x22jivetrky,2013-01-23T17:49Z,"Hey,
I followed the given steps but when launching the game from Future Soldier.exe only the Uplay opens with no choice to allow him to access internet (otherwise I get stuck on the uplay loading screen) & can't play the game.
Did I do anything wrong ?"
,MAA11792,2013-01-23T21:02Z,Thank yaaaw! I actually consider buying this game on steam.
,kiyoshi106,2013-01-24T21:28Z,"i installed the dlc but when i copied the content in the skidrow folder, the game starts with uplay & can’t play the game. plz help"
,Beelzy,2013-01-25T04:49Z,"Same problem here with UPlay. SKIDROW with a random password doesn't seem to work either.

Anyone able to help?"
,Beelzy,2013-01-25T04:59Z,"Seems the updates are messed up.

Update 1.1 installs in the Ubisoft folder, no matter if you have the Black Box version or whereever you've placed it.

Same goes for update 1.6, which installs in the windows folder directly, and that's really just an awful mess :/"
,MAA11792,2013-01-25T15:22Z,"PLEASE UPLOAD AND CRACK ARCTIC STRIKE AND FUTURE DLCs

PLEASE UPLOAD AND CRACK ARCTIC STRIKE AND FUTURE DLCs

PLEASE UPLOAD AND CRACK ARCTIC STRIKE AND FUTURE DLCs"
,happyfarm,2013-01-27T01:51Z,"If you have the problem with the Uplay screen preventing the game from launching, copy the cracked content from the SKiDROW folder from DibyaTPB's torrent (http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7374464/Tom.Clancys.Ghost.Recon.Future.Soldier-SKIDROW_[PublicHD]).

For some reason, the cracked files included with this DLC pack won't work for some, with the result being the Uplay screen preventing the game from launching. I had this problem and I simply tried copying the cracked files from DibyaTPB's Ghost Recon torrent over the cracked files from the DLC and it now works fine."
,Dark2000,2013-02-04T04:48Z,"This really works for those who get the uplay launcher error.

,h4ck4l1fe,2013-03-25T03:14Z,yep installers are all screwed up....they install in to the windows directory for whatever reason. big waste of time for nothing
