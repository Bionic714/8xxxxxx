Living most of his life in central Indiana, the_witchdoktor has a distinct taste for dark UK drum & bass and 
ragga style jungle, Dirty Elktro, or OUTRIGHT SICK Dubstep! His crazy, unique style of... We will just say "BASS"! Has been crushing dance floors since 99' he will leave you with a bad taste in your mouth and burnt soles
son your shoes! A BASS-force not to be reckoned with . .
