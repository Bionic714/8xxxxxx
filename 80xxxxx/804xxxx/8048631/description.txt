Well, now we got a lot of good european stuff, but we havent seen any real progaganda, so time for Qadhafi, a tale of the life of Qadhafi, and how he helped the Libyan people. 
If they agree now 33 years later is anyones guess :)

So prepare for History of the Libyan Revolution - Once upon a time...Qadhafi
