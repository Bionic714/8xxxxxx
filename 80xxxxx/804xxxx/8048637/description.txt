And now that we got our daily dose of propaganda from Qadhafi, what is better than some religious comic to go along with it?

So here you go, Medjugorje - Our Lady and Children.


Some background for it:
On June 24, 1981, young Mirjana Dragicevic and Ivanka Ivankovic reported seeing an apparition of the Virgin Mary in a village in what is now Bosnia-Herzegovina. The following day another vision was reported, this time also by four other young people:, Marija Pavlovic Jakov Colo, Vicka Ivankovic, and Ivan Dragicevic.

The children claim that they saw an apparition on the hill Crnica (on the place called Podbrdo); the alleged apparition was a white form with a child in her arms. Surprised and scared, they did not approach. The next day at the same time four of the youths returned, and were later joined by the other two.

For several years the six visionaries reported seeing daily apparitions from the Virgin Mary and Medugorje became crowded with pilgrims. It has been reported that Our Lady of Medugorje has been appearing daily to three of these visionaries ever since, some say that they have stopped having daily apparitions.
