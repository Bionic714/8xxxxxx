The Kardashians Return to Miami

 ReleasedJan 20, 2013

 In the season premiere, things are heating up in Miami when the Kardashian sisters make their return. However, Kourtney and Kim are in for a shock when they arrive at DASH and and find their store in shambles! Meanwhile, Kourtney bans Scott from moving to Miami with her because of his dark past during their last Miami adventure--but juggling two small kids and a business by one's self is no easy feat. Plus, Kim's new relationship with Kanye West is blossoming, but her divorce proceedings with Kris Humphries carry on--and her sisters start to wonder if she truly is alright.


I upload this and all the other shows because I am a generous person.THIS IS NOT MY JOB! I do this in my spare time between 2 jobs using my own resources. Having said that, I will continue to upload this show when I have the opportunity and in the format that is most favourable to my bandwidth.I rip this show from iTunes and they are notoriously unreliable with posting them
 If any of this is a problem then please find the program elsewhere.
 Thanks and enjoy the season
