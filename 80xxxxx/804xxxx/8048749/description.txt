Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site :: Mike Adams guest hosts on this Monday, January 21 edition of the Alex Jones show. Mike follows up on last week's heated pro-Second Amendment developments in the wake of Obama's support for radical anti-Second Amendment legislation and his unconstitutional signing of numerous anti-firearms executive actions. 

Mike talks with Jackson County Kentucky Sheriff Denny Peyman about his pledge to not enforce federal laws restricting the right to own firearms and he also talks with Max Velocity, an author and trainer providing tactical instruction. 

In the third hour today, Mike talks with author Jon Rappoport about New York creating a psychiatric police state.
