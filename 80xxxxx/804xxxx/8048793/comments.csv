,mmcquagge,2013-01-23T03:49Z,I'm not sure it is fixed. It's been stuck at 99% complete all day.
,00sweeney,2013-01-23T05:56Z,"It's stuck, but as far as I can tell all the books download except for the epub version of The Lincoln Conspiracy.

So, unless that's the one book you're REALLY looking for, go ahead and download."
,00sweeney,2013-01-23T07:00Z,"Oh, and it looks like there are two copies of Lincoln Conspiracy and one of the downloads fully--I had thought it was a copy in a different format.

So, there you have it. Even if you're stuck at 99%, it appears as if you'll have the entire download at that point.

,mmcquagge,2013-01-23T23:37Z,"bighss, no file conversion needed just open your itunes with your ipad connected, go to ""on this ipad"" at the top right, open books and drop them in =)."
