,FureeTutawk,2013-01-31T04:23Z,"LOL sounds like someone's jealous of yify's success. Want a good quality small file movie? Yify every time. Got the goods to display even better quality? Check it, yify's got both for almost every title."
,gramranger,2013-02-01T05:18Z,"I have to agree with @Furee. I preview movies that I want to buy, and don't want to waste time downloading 5gb fricken over-ripped movies when these 700mb ones are of great enough quality to get a good idea.

One thing I wish YIFY would do better though, is be on top of the foreign-only parts in subtitles. Leaving those out makes some movies a complete 'wtf is going on?'"
,rakib.kot,2013-02-24T16:55Z,"Quality was good - A9 V9, thnx to the uploader! Movie was OK as i expected it to be! Storyline is intelligent and entertaining and acters were OK! I usually watch all the movies at film.kbc44.com because they have HD's but they didn't have this one so im happy to have piratebay :) Thank you once again uploader for this great share!"
