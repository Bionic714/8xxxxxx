[T],Swegin8r,2013-01-26T04:19Z,"@unintoxicated: As stated in the instruction file, the default installation directory is ""Program FilesWondershareDVD Creator"" or if you are running a 64bit OS then it will be located at ""Program Files (x86)WondershareDVD Creator"". Inside that folder is where you will find ""DVDCreator.exe"".

There are three ways of applying the patch. 1) Use the 'Search…' button and find the above file in the location I described. 2) Drag the file on to the patch. 3) Place the patch in the above directory. After using one of those three methods press the 'Patch It!' button."

I heard a BING and a message popped up .Thank you again, Works now -keep up the good work.           unintoxicated (noob!)"
