When Beau Randolf, the founder of hit adult 
video franchise "College Girls Gone Crazy," 
is murdered, Castle and Beckett are 
confronted with a lengthy list of husbands, 
fathers and ex-college girls who all have 
motive. So to find the killer, they must 
delve deep into the victim's life, where 
they find surprises at every turn. Also in 
the episode, Alexis starts a video blog, 
but Castle is not happy that personal and 
intimate details about her life are being 
made public.
