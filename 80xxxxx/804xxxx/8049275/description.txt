Cutting out processed and junk foods from your diet and introducing the superfoods listed in this book will help you boost your immune system, fight illness, and increase your energy levels. Superfoods are rich in vitamins, minerals and anti-oxidants. This book lists them individually and explains why they are so good for you and how they can help keep you healthy. It also lists a number of spices which have medicinal benefits in their own right. 

 By combining these spices with some of the superfoods, this book includes some simple but delicious recipes that have their roots in the Mediterranean, Asian and African regions, all of which are known to be among the world's healthiest diets. There are mouthwatering salads, wholesome soups, delicious main courses and vegetable dishes, fresh juices, and nutritious smoothies. You really are what you eat. With this book to guide you, you can change your eating habits for the better and make a difference to your general health.
