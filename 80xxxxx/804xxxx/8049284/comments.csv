  You seem to fulfill a lot of requests. If you don't mind, I have one to throw your way...

Iron Ghost 1-6 (Image comics 2005-2006 mini series)
Thank you once again"
,VonStone,2013-01-23T12:17Z,Thank you very much for all your efforts finding and uploading the Black Panther and Captain Marvell runs! I will keep me busy reading on my Ipad :))
,johnnyisawesome1234,2013-01-23T21:12Z,Thanks for everything you do for us dude. Can you get Uncanny X-men #475-544 (there is no need to get the whole thing)? This is the volume: http://www.comicvine.com/the-uncanny-x-men/49-3092/? 
,johnnyisawesome1234,2013-01-24T20:42Z,"Oops, never mind my last comment! Just found a good torrent for what I wanted."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-01-25T06:08Z,"BSnapp, I've had no luck locating Iron Ghost, although I did find the miniseries in Spanish.  ;-P  Frustrating! Sorry. I'll keep an eye out for it.

VonStone, no problem. I'm happy to give something back when I can. Thanks for saying thanks!

johnnyisawesome1234 glad to hear you found them. Don't hesitate to check with me when you are unable to locate stuff. I'll try to help, anyway.  :-)"
