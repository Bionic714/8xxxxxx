,TMV91,2013-01-22T05:13Z,"First off I'd like to thank you for your wonderful torrents. Much appreciated.

I have a quick question. What is the difference between this torrent and the one you uploaded on 2012-11-11?
This is the one I'm talking about: http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7816163/Omar_Rodriguez_Lopez_archive_%282004-Nov2012%29

I'd just like to know what additions this torrent contains over the previous ORL one. Thanks in advance and keep up the good work!"
,e7add9,2013-01-22T05:16Z,"this torrent has 4 albums Omar released since the date of the other ORL torrent i uploaded. it also contains a different, higher quality version of the Omar & John album and a higher quality version of Sepulcros de Miel"
,TMV91,2013-01-22T05:52Z,"Awesome. Seems like it'll take quite a while for the download to complete, but it's well worth the time.

I'll be seeding this for a long time. :-)"

At any rate, if you have the Bosnian Rainbows Clouds Hill recordings, I'll name my firstborn after you if you take the time to upload it.  Thanks again either way!"
,e7add9,2013-02-21T14:00Z,"@deathbykisses

The ""Live a Clouds Hill"" album in this torrent is a collaboration between ORL and Faust, not the Bosnian Rainbows recording. To find it, navigate to the folder ""Omar Rodriguez Lopez & Faust"". there should be two FLAC files in there

sorry for the disappointment"
