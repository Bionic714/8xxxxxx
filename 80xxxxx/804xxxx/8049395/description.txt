"The Corpse on the Canopy"

After Hodgins and Angela were drugged 
and woke up to a bloody corpse 
hanging in the canopy of their bed 
and flower petals around their son 
Michael's crib, they are forced to 
believe that Pelant is back for 
revenge against Hodgins. Although 
Hodgins wants to go after Pelant 
directly, Booth knows it's best to 
work within the system and not go 
against protocol. Meanwhile, as the 
Jeffersonian team investigates the 
corpse, they discover the victim was 
a Special Forces agent working for 
the world's biggest supplier of 
mercenaries, and Angela and Hodgins 
decide to start an investigation 
without the rest of the Jeffersonian 
team for the sake of their family.
