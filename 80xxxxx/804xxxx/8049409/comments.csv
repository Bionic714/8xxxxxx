,anarchist9027,2013-01-23T02:29Z,Symantec Endpoint requires no cracking or patching. It is enterprise based anti-virus and needs no serial to use.

,bito007,2013-03-02T01:58Z,I got it figured out now. Pls disregard my previous comment. I would like to know if this is for sure a RU2 version that supports Windows 8. I just ran Windows 8 Upgrade Assistant on my laptop that has this Symantec RU2 installed and this RU2 version came up as crossed out in the results. Does it mean that it's not compatible with Windows 8.
