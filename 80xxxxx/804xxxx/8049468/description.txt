ISBN: 089296880X | 2013 | EPUB

As the demands of work grow more intense, personal life can get shoved to the side. But resolving the job-versus-life conflict doesn't require the kind of big, disruptive, scary transformation that so many time-management "experts" recommend. In TWEAK IT, Cali Williams Yost proves that a comfortable work+life fit can be achieved through making small, consistent, everyday changes--tweaks--that, cumulatively, will optimize job performance and well-being. This engaging, practical book, filled with case studies of people who've tweaked their way to professional success and personal satisfaction, guides readers through an easy-to-implement program that can be tailored to suit any individual's life, both on off the job.
