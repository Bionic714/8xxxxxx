Original airdate:  Saturday January 19, 2013


NOTES:

S01E03 is already available, but this cap is encoded at the best quality possible, at 1080p.

If your setup cannot handle 1080p files, there are lower quality versions out there.  The file has been tested and plays fine. If it doesn't work for you, then your equipment cannot play 1080p.

VERY SPECIAL thanks to Reb for the file. 

Season one will be 12 episodes. 


ENJOY!
