So OK, it's not a masterpiece but I think It deserves a bit more credit then people give it. Especially considering how people rate other garbage films. I enjoyed it.  On the other hand it's hard not to enjoy Olivia Wilde. Fuck me..."

I am curious about this flick but not enough to pitch 40 bucks for it blindly, so I appreciate the chance to check it first.
:)

PS: The download is going brutally fast :D"
