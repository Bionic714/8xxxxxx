In the year since Rockstar Game's incredible Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas was released, a lot of unbelievable software has come and gone for the PlayStation 2. Metal Gear Solid 3, God of War, Shadow of the Colossus, and Devil May Cry 3 have all pushed the limits of our imaginations with their excellent concepts and mechanics, and have continued to set standards and expectations as to what a videogame should be. Of course, that left us with an interesting question: "With the release of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas - Special Edition in the midst of this summer's 'Hot Coffee' scandal, how does IGN's 2004 Game of the Year still hold up?"

The answer, not surprisingly, is still "enormously well." Though the game itself doesn't feature anything new by way of content, bug fixes, or storylines (with the exception being that the buried "Hot Coffee" mini-game has now been removed), it's still an excellent experience -- and other than a few extras that have been added outside of the software, it remains unchanged. With that in mind, we present below a modified version of the original review that ran more than a year ago with a couple of specific changes. One: the overall opinion of the piece has been skewed a bit to reflect the high quality software that's been released since, and Two: we have now added mention of the bonus extras included in the special edition package.
