
he official game of the 2008 season, MotoGP 08 features all the riders, bikes and tracks providing the definitive 2-wheeled racing experience. The development team's overriding aim was to deliver an unparalleled handling model that allows access points for gamers of all skill levels and just as importantly provide a challenge to meet each player's abilities.

MotoGP 08 puts the player at the center of the MotoGP experience by letting them join a team and compete alongside their sporting heroes in all three race classes -- 125cc, 250cc and MotoGP. Good results in qualifying and racing earn points that can then be exchanged for bike upgrades to improve attributes such as straight line speed, braking and cornering.
