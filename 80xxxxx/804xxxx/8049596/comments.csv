http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2071645/"
,nazgull2k10,2013-01-22T22:40Z,"deserves alot more then a 7.5 imho.  This is an EXCELLENT plot/story.  If they unfold it right, it will easily be *the* show to watch monday nights.

10/10 for me.  "
,jonaslorik,2013-01-23T01:33Z,Not going to give it a 10/10 based of the pilot. It was enjoyable though. This show looks promising (it has fucking Kevin Bacon.)
,drphildobaggins,2013-01-23T04:04Z,"Fucking dramatic ear bursting ""scary"" noises all the time. Fuck they annoy me. "
,JustAnotherApprentice,2013-01-23T07:22Z,"Thanks a lot,eztv!"
,greenwheel,2013-01-23T08:03Z,@jonaslorik - yeah but Kevin Bacon is no Alec Baldwin :-P
,ironymon,2013-01-23T14:48Z,"Plot sounds stupid, i'll just have to touch the guts myself and see. "
,ironymon,2013-01-23T14:48Z,I love cooked bacon....
,logan-x-art,2013-01-23T22:58Z,"yea this was fucking stupid, it was pathetic and predictable...the plot was shit, the acting was second rate shit and the hack Kevin Bacon should go back into obscurity where he belongs..."

,pirate450,2013-02-23T22:11Z,"Great episode, nice plot so far. Storyline is intelligent and i wouldn't change it even a bit. Quality - A10 V10. I usually watch everything at film.plotar.org	because they always have HD but they don't have tv shows so having TPB for TVshows is great, thnx!"
