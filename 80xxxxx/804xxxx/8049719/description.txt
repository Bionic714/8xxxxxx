Beatle, activist, artist and author, John Lennon's personal life was never short on drama. Thirty years after Lennon's shocking death, Christopher Eccleston (Doctor Who) stars as the enigmatic musician in a defining period of his life, the years from 1967 to 1971, as he moved from "Beatle John" to icon. From the death of father figure and manager Brian Epstein, his breakup with first wife Cynthia, his fascinating love affair with Yoko Ono, through his spiraling drug use and decision to leave England for New York, this is the story of an artist destroying everything to find himself.
