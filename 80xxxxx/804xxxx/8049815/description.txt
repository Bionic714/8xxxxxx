Sweeney may be familiar as a member of that freewheeling folk band Bellowhead, but his partnership with the accordionist and singer Hannah James brings out his more intimate side. From the hypnotic opener, a Purcell hornpipe, their collaboration works its way through an atmospheric series of traditional songs and instrumentals. Sweeney switches between ∩¼üddle, viola, nyckelharpa and bagpipes, while the undemonstrative James adds ultra-discreet foot percussion. She brings a touch of girlish mischief to The FarmerΓÇÖs Cursed Wife, a tale of a scold who is too much even for the devil himself. Light a log ∩¼üre and let the musicians do the rest.
