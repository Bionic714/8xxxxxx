Thanx for making my collection complete."
,tpacomics,2013-01-22T14:14Z,"Awesome! Thanks, blackcanary."
,ProfessorQ,2013-01-31T02:37Z,"blackcanary, you are doing an AMAZING job on here!! Many, many thanks. May I make a request? X-Men (v3) (2010-2013). That series is ending soon and it would be GREATLY appreciated to get the full run on TPB (before v4 starts)."
,quelagg82,2013-02-08T19:30Z,"Great up, thank you kindly.

Any of chance of getting the issues released when it was just X-Men. I have from 116 on, but its a bit expensive for me to buy the rest at this point."
