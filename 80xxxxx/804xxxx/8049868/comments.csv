So go download and install the K-lite codec pack full version or mega version both of which comes with Media Player Classic Home Cinema and configure it properly for .mp4 and .mkv playback. If you do not have it you can get it from the link above in the torrent description or get yourself a BluRay player that is mkv and or mp4 compatible like a LG, Samsung,Panasonic or Philips like I have here, then all you have to do is copy the file onto a USB flash drive like I do here then connect it to the BluRay player and away you go playing the 720p video with NO problems. How hard is that?"
