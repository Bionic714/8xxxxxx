SUMMARY......: 

"A House Divided / Executive Retreat"

With presidents like Jefferson and Jackson tripling America's size,
slavery is finally addressed by Lincoln, leading to war, and the three
decades that followed had weak presidents without vision, leaving
Congress and industrialists to lead.
                                                                                

RELEASE NOTES:
