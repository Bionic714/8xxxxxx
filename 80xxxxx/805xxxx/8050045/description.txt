  Steeped in the principles of hardcore, but an arm's reach away from mainstream success, Springfield, Illinois' Park sounds like the future of modern rock on their stellar second album, It Won't Snow Where You're Going. Fronted by singer/guitarist Ladd Mitchell, the group's skillfully crafted and dramatically executed music falls midway between Thursday's thrust and Incubus' hardened melodies. Songs like "Gasoline Kisses for Everyone," and "Day One and Counting" are cathartic and innovative, as Mitchell and guitarist Justin Valenti build a roar that shimmers as often as it splinters. On "Which Wrist First," glistening, Chameleons-like guitar lines fuse with the jagged urgency of vintage At the Drive In, and despite it's title, "This Would Be Easier if You Would Just Die" is very much alive on the strength of Mitchell's powerful shout-singing. Tender moments like "Conversations With Emily" are rare but just as captivating, affirming that Park also possesses a depth that could catapult them to next-big-thing status.
