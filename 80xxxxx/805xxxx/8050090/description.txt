Mara has become one of my favourite Runrig albums. It has a spiritual and romantic dimension, different from some of the other albums which have a stronger political slant. The Mighty Atlantic is great, and very well-known. Other songs like Road and the River (simply stunning), The Wedding and The Dancing Floor are just superb. And the album ends with the outstanding Lighthouse, which almost has a gospel-like quality. All this incredible songwriting, with the fantastic music, and of course the voice of Donnie. If you like Runrig, you will love this CD.
