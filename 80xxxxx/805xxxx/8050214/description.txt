Snow in March
By Matt Jones

Quick, what does Miike Snow have in common with Britney Spears, Madonna, and Kylie Minogue?

Well, quite a lot, actually.

If your level of familiarity with Swedish band Miike Snow was on par with mine before this week, this might surprise you. As it turns out, two thirds of Miike Snow (producers Christian Karlsson and Pontus Winnberg, otherwise known as Bloodshy & Avant) are the same gentlemen who co-wrote and/or produced a good amount of material by the ladies mentioned above, including SpearsΓÇÖ megahit ΓÇ£ToxicΓÇ¥.

Therein lies the importance of separate branding, young reader.

If youΓÇÖre looking for a brand this week that makes aurally pleasing sequences of bleeps, bloops, keys, horns, sighs, ΓÇ£oohsΓÇ¥ ΓÇ£wahhhsΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£aahsΓÇ¥, then look no further than Miike SnowΓÇÖs latest product on the market, Happy to You. ItΓÇÖs the aggressively haunting sophomore effort from the same ensemble that put together 2010ΓÇ▓s terrific eponymous debut, and although it came out the last week of march, Happy sounds like it wouldnΓÇÖt be sad if winter decided to last another few months.

ThatΓÇÖs not to say itΓÇÖs a sad album though; although it has its somber moments, itΓÇÖs largely a lighthearted effort.

Okay, I just made that up. I donΓÇÖt really know what this album is about. Most of the lyrics areΓÇª cryptic. IΓÇÖm not even going to take a stab at it. ThereΓÇÖs a lot of symbolismΓÇª probablyΓÇª and some spiritual imageryΓÇª references to pharaohs and stuffΓÇª and some nice juxtaposition ofΓÇª thingsΓÇª Yeah, IΓÇÖm not even going to try. I would give them the benefit of a doubt and assume that the lyrical complexity matches the production expertise, but I kind of think Karlsson, Winnberg, and lead singer Andrew Wyatt just enjoy keeping their listeners guessing.

After watching the two music videos that accompany this album so far, I really donΓÇÖt think IΓÇÖm wrong.

And hereΓÇÖs the explanation.

After watching the videos, I have to agree that theyΓÇÖre high on vivid imagery and low on clarity, which seems to be the intent. I think the same can be said for the album as a whole too. Karlsson and Winnberg are experts at Making Things Sound Good, so donΓÇÖt be surprised when these songs stick with you well after you turn everything off. The music is, again, haunting. The French horns in ΓÇ£DevilΓÇÖs WorkΓÇ¥ rattle the sternum with their severity; Donnie DarkoΓÇÖs rabbit friend Frank seems to make an appearance in ΓÇ£Black Tin BoxΓÇ¥; ΓÇ£Bavarian #1 (Say You Will)ΓÇ¥ invades your ear with the battle driven rat-a-tat of a snare, a bass line that mimics every movement of a plucky key ensemble, and WyattΓÇÖs soft but penetrating vocals. All that said, I really donΓÇÖt know if thereΓÇÖs much of an overarching theme tying the content together. This isnΓÇÖt necessarily a bad thing, and of course I could just be wrong, but itΓÇÖs certainly worth mentioning.

IΓÇÖm hesitant to say much more about this album as it still seems like a bit of a work in progress, especially considering WinnbergΓÇÖs hinting at the continuation of the Alien Children Use Big-Nosed Stepford Men in Shiny Pants to Ruin the World video series. CanΓÇÖt wait.

IΓÇÖve found that I enjoy Happy to You more with each listen, which is no doubt a testament to its earworm quality. And I seriously canΓÇÖt wait for the next videos in the series ΓÇö first, because the imagery is phenomenal, and second, because WHAT IS HAPPENING?!?!?

I guess weΓÇÖll find out soon. Or not.
