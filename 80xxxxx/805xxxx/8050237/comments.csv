,spam_hater,2013-01-22T22:35Z,"Nice game, thanks.
I played it for about 2h... With my system (fat PS3, rogero 4.30 CFW) it is prone to hang during battles. Hope there will be an update to fix that."
,Helgi00,2013-01-23T03:04Z,Is there a fix for 3.55 for this? Duplex is usually pretty good at posting fixes for there stuff.
,Helgi00,2013-01-23T03:14Z,Has anyone got this working on 3.55?
,imyoungxd2,2013-01-23T03:22Z,"I've had the game freeze on me twice in 2 hours.
One in a battle and another one when I was about to save.

Hopefully there is a fix."
,imyoungxd2,2013-01-23T03:27Z,"""Bug destroys save file

Several U.S. journalists from various magazines already have a copy and confirm that the bug appears after about 45 minutes playing time. Namely a specific quest is concerned, during which you have to find a special bar.

Who's Score stores directly in front of the Quest, looks finally to a ruined game. Therefore it is recommended to refrain from storing before the quest and save it until after the quest. For safety, you should also create a second score and the first copy to be in the worst case can access a backup.

It is unclear yet whether developer Level 5 is already working on a patch, and this is still on time. Finally, the role play appears as early as tomorrow in the U.S.. In Europe, Ni no Kuni: The Curse of the White Queen only on 1 Annually published.

Lies before us a copy of the game and we saved even before the said location. The bug has not occurred, which may mean that the bug does not always occur, or the European version is not affected.""

DUPLEX version is BLES01555 (European)."" 

The freeze is actually the fault of the game... now we have to wait for a patch... Gamefaqs board has many users with freezing."
,FreakAlchemist,2013-01-23T04:38Z,It time to see what the big fuss is all about on this game.
,spam_hater,2013-01-23T09:03Z,@imyoungxd2: thank's for the info.
,treign,2013-01-23T09:06Z,"I managed to get this one running with TB, i had issues coping the files over on FTP but after some persistence i managed to get them all copied. Currently using multiman to launch, but i get some wizzard book issues. Nothing major. All in all i managed to play a nice bit of the game today and finished up a review if you are interested in seeing what the game is all about while your download finishes on here. C4POmZP6qoY"
,imyoungxd2,2013-01-23T15:48Z,Game seems to randomly freeze frequently in forests. No freezing in towns or the world.
,hbright84,2013-01-25T10:39Z,I have played this game for 13 hours and no big problems for me. The only problem I can tell is when you open the wizard companion guild it takes a minute or two and you are unable to press any button to cancel. I think some people may think the game freezes at this point and turns it off maybe corrupting it somehow. Don't turn the PS3 off just have some damn patience and it will load. Best JRPG/RPG ever!!!!
,thematic,2013-01-27T04:36Z,"damn.. so much freezing case...
is there any fix for this bug ? or anyone can upload PSN version ?

Thanks!"
,spam_hater,2013-01-28T18:16Z,"After some trying and still freezing I decided to download the PSN version (used PSNStuff). Installed it, copied the savedata and continued my game... Since 9h no freezing at all.
I recommend the PSN version."
,boromir222,2013-01-31T13:49Z,Games working on Rogero 4.30 v2.05. Thank you! 
,spystone,2013-02-02T11:12Z,"If anyone got problem with the game.
Try update your multiman I'm pretty sure it'll work."
,ArmosNights,2013-02-18T09:36Z,"Regarding the random freezes, just remember to save often. Wizard companion takes some time to load. 50 hours in so far, this game is indeed great."
,ps3431,2013-02-21T17:35Z,"Works for me,thnx to uploader...Rogero 4.31 and multiman 4.18.00"
,binoysupper,2013-03-12T23:59Z,is there a fix for 3.55?
,blechner,2013-03-19T00:42Z,"@treign: You said you managed to get this game running with TB. Looks like we are the only people still using TB :) Anyway, how did you get it running? Did you find a fix somewhere?"
