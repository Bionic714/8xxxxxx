[V],thetorrentlord,2013-01-23T00:58Z,"Episode order & Alternate versions

Confusingly, RTL in Germany, M6 in France and HBO Canada/Super Écran 1 in Canada all have 

or plan to air the series in a different episode order, reflected in the following chart.
Episode 	                                                                   		

Canadian order 	French order 	German order
The General's Daughter 	3 		1 		1
Trojan Horsepower 	1 		2 		7
Harvest 		4 		3 		2
Dead Drop 		5 		4 		4
Sharks 			8 		5 		6
12 Hours 		11 		6 		12
City of Love 		9 		7 		9
Switch 			10 		8 		3
Hot Ice 		6 		9 		8
Give the Guy a Hand 	7 		10 		11
Cherchez La Femme 	12 		11 		10
Payback 		2 		12 		5

It is unclear at this point what the ""proper"", intended order for the episodes is. The 

German home video release presents the episodes as they were broadcast on RTL, adding the 

two unaired episodes (Give the Guy a Hand and 12 Hours) as episodes 11 and 12 

respectively. It is unknown what order the forthcoming French and potential North American 

home video releases will reflect. It is however certain that unlike other shows, 

production order should not be followed, as Trojan Horsepower was the last episode to be 

shot yet features the first meeting between Frank and Juliette, two characters who 

interact in other episodes, and is also the episode where Frank first sees the red Audi R8 

which appears in most later episodes. Trojan Horsepower served as the pilot episode in 

Canada, the second episode in France and the seventh in Germany. Those two countries both 

used The General's Daughter as the pilot episode, which had in fact been announced in the 

media as the pilot when production started. Based on the chronology of events, the 

Canadian release most likely carries the correct order of episodes.

In addition, at least some episodes reportedly have three different edits depending on the 

country of broadcast."
