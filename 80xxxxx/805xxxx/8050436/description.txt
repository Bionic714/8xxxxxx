Slipknot/Stone Sour frontman Corey Taylor has collaborated with Foo Fighters' Dave Grohl!

Also featured on the track are Cheap Trick guitarist Rick Nielsen and former Kyuss bassist Scott Reeder.

'From Can To Can't' will appear on Grohl's upcoming documentary Sound City: Real To Reel.


I've also included two extra songs featuring Corey Taylor:

Apocalyptica 'I'm not Jesus'
Biohazard  'Domination'


enjoy and seed!
