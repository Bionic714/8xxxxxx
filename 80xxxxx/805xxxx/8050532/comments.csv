The story is very predictable and formulaic but it is very enjoyable. Old men get ripped off by young man and sexy girls, old men finally wake up and exact revenge.I think the English have a term for this type of movie, a ""romp"", and certainly it could have been a ""Carry On Sugar Daddies"" sort of movie.
I found it an enjoyable 90 minutes or so, with maybe a few too many shots of old men in even older underwear, hahaha. Not the greatest movie of its era, but then again I don't think it is meant to be taken too seriously, just enjoy it for what it is.....silly fun."
