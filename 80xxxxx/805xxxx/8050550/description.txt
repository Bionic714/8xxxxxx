Title Continuity:
Star Wars: Legacy (2006) #50 continues to Star Wars: Legacy War (2010) #1 

Notes: 
Set more than 100 years after the latest point in the current Star Wars timeline, Legacy will investigate, according to its tagline, "All New Sith Order! All New Empire! All New Skywalker!"
 
It is such a departure from the already-explored areas of the Star Wars chronology that LucasBooks had to give the era its own continuity symbol and era. Officially, LucasBooks dubs this very-much-after-Return of the Jedi time period the "Legacy Era".
