Three times as many lined up for the reduced bit rate as the full MINI.
Letting my client decide, it gave twice as much bandwidth to the larger file.
And the reduced bandwidth file spill-over was about 1 1/2 minute before the MINI.

I note that the two files I offered just about equalled the old standard (~195MB).
Since then, the reduced bit rate version is getting a lot more peers.

Well, as long as everyone who wants to see it gets to, I'm satisfied.
