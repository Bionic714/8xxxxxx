Angela (Alektra Blue) should be embarking on her dream honeymoon… hard to do when your fiancé' gets cold feet just before your nuptials. Depressed and confused, her best friend (Kaylani Lei) convinces her to make use of her “non-refundable” travel plans. Reluctantly, a bitter Angela heads to a posh couples resort—alone. The place may be paradise, but it is the eclectic and hilarious cast of characters she meets that leave an impression. From the over-sexed and anal loving Martins to the delusional horny rock star to the sultry lesbians, these are truly some unforgettable vacationers! One person in particular, a handsome staff member, snaps her out of her sadness. Is he just a rebound or does he actually have a chance to capture her wounded heart?
