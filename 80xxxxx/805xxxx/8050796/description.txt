From Wiki:


XTC were a New Wave[1] band from Swindon, England, active between 1977 and 2005. The band enjoyed some chart success, including the UK and Canadian hits "Making Plans for Nigel" (1979) and "Senses Working Overtime" (1982), but are perhaps better known for their long-standing critical (rather than commercial) success. 




Fossil Fuel The XTC Singles 1977 - 1992 1996


Fossil Fuel: The XTC Singles 1977ΓÇô92 is a compilation album by XTC released in 1996. It was their third such Greatest Hits album following 1982's Waxworks: Some Singles 1977-1982 and 1987's The Compact XTC. It collects all thirty-one of their Virgin Records UK singles in chronological order. It does not include their pseudonymous singles as The Dukes of Stratosphear, The Three Wise Men or The Colonel.

The two discs reflect their shift in popularity from Great Britain to the United States in the mid-eighties. Some of Disc 1's tracks ("Making Plans for Nigel", "Sgt. Rock (Is Going to Help Me)", "Senses Working Overtime") were Top 40 hits in their homeland while a handful of songs from Disc 2 became popular on stateside college radio ("Dear God", "The Mayor of Simpleton", "The Ballad of Peter Pumpkinhead").

With no little significance, the compilation closes out with "Wrapped in Grey", which had been released as the third single from 1992's Nonsuch and then quickly recalled and deleted by Virgin Records, an event which effectively ended XTC's association with the label.

It reached No. 33 on the UK album charts.
