,MissNitch,2013-02-01T21:32Z,"Merci Beaucoup! I won't pay for the album, music is free- but I'll always buy swag, see live concerts and donate a dollar if Otep emailed me and said she was in need. "

,MissNitch,2013-04-07T10:13Z,"Yeah, I hate to be that bitch, but this album isn't working. It plays through about 1 min or less of each song then skips on. Great loss"
