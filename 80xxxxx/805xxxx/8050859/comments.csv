,Chronus,2013-01-26T01:20Z,"stoping at 99,8%! reseed please!"
,jackjake,2013-01-26T21:04Z,"I was stuck at 98% for a week so I gave up and got it this way:
I deleted the partial download.
Then downloaded ONLY the text file. (had no trouble getting text file)
Went to WINow site and downloaded trial version.
Then used text file to unlock the program.  
Be sure to download version 4.0.7f (google the version to save time)

Fully activated.
Many thanks to uploader for text file. Don't know why this torrent didn't catch fire. 
I don't have anything new to upload, but I DO seed. Everybody should do likewise. 

Comment if this works for you, too. "
,barstock,2013-01-29T22:42Z,Thanks for the heads up.  I suppose the only thing cooler would have been if you posted the 80 bytes of the text file here.
,jackjake,2013-01-29T23:19Z,"I didn't think it would have helped. The file is already established on this uploaders page. If I'm wrong, go ahead and upload it. Peace. "
