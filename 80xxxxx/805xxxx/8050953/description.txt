Why I'm uploading this:

To gauge demand for superior AAC audio encoding at high quality and low file size.  You really would need very expensive speakers to hear the difference from FLAC.  Fuck the MP3; it's outdated and should never be used again.


About Nightwish:

Nightwish is a symphonic metal band from Kitee, Finland. The band was formed in 1996 by lead songwriter and keyboardist Tuomas Holopainen, guitarist Emppu Vuorinen, and vocalist Tarja Turunen, who was replaced in 2007 by former Alyson Avenue singer Anette Olzon. In 2002, original bassist Sami Vänskä was replaced by Marco Hietala, who also took over the male vocalist role previously filled by Holopainen or guest singers.  Nightwish is the third-best-selling band and musical entity in Finland with sales of more than 900,000 certified copies.  The group is also the most successful Finnish band worldwide, selling more than 8 million records and receiving more than 60 gold and platinum awards

About HE AAC v2:

High Efficiency AAC v2 Profile ΓÇô defined in 2006, uses AAC-LC, SBR, PS

Advanced Audio Coding is designed to be the successor of the MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3, known as MP3 format.  

HE-AAC v2, a.k.a. aacPlus v2 or eAAC+, the combination of Parametric Stereo (PS) and HE-AAC; used for even lower bitrates; defined in 2004 and 2006

AAC and HE-AAC are better than MP3 at low bit rates (typically less than 128 kilobits per second). This is especially true at very low bit rates where the superior stereo coding, pure MDCT, and better transform window sizes leave MP3 unable to compete.

While the MP3 format has near-universal hardware and software support, primarily due to MP3 being the format of choice during the crucial first few years of widespread music file-sharing/distribution over the internet, AAC is a strong contender due to some unwavering industry support
