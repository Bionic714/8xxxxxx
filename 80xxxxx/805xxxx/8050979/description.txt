Drugs Inc: 
Drugs: A multi-billion-dollar industry that fuels crime and violence like no other substance on the planet. Turning cartel leaders into billionaires, the illegal drug industry also provides vital income to hundreds of thousands of poor workers across the globe. While some users sacrifice their lives to an addiction they can't escape, others find drugs to be their only saving grace from physical or emotional pain almost impossible to overcome. Where should the lines be drawn in this lucrative industry?
 Hash 
Smuggling hashish from the remote Moroccan Riff Mountains to the streets of Europe is a dirty, dangerous business. A former British gangster serves as guide into this illicit underworld, visiting a secret hash-making location nestled in the mountains. Using everything from hidden car compartments and donkeys to skis and drug mules, the smugglers' key is to be as inconspicuous as possible. At the front line of Europe's war on drugs, customs agents near Gibraltar seize 100 kilograms of hashish.
