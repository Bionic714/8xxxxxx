,Rizzo220,2013-01-22T22:46Z,So I take it this won't work with Snow Leopard?
,Shitzkrieg,2013-01-22T23:11Z,"Thanks very much for this and sorry for the noob question but how do I make a bootable disk from this if its not an .iso file? Is it possiblet to make a bootable DVD with this file? 

I looked online and can't seem to figure it out. Thanks in advance..."
,Shitzkrieg,2013-01-23T00:07Z,^Never mind. Figured it out finally.
,pjp_76,2013-01-23T12:24Z,Why wouldn't it work with Snow Leopard? This is just the current version which works also with 10.8 ... nobody said that it would not work with Snow Leopard ... as long as you have a x86 type CPU it should work just peachy :)
,rherald,2013-01-23T16:14Z,how did you make a bootable disk?
,7117,2013-01-23T20:48Z,with 'Disk Utility' 
,nagah,2013-01-23T21:33Z,Works fine. Thanks pjp_76
,bobbyphoto2,2013-01-24T02:23Z,serial does not work!
,pjp_76,2013-01-24T19:02Z,"@bobbyphoto2: Not sure how you tried entering the serial - however I am running 10.8.2 and just copied and pasted the serial and it worked right away, not sure whats wrong on your end ..."
,Incertus,2013-05-24T05:24Z,Is this update-able or is this a stationary build?  Need to know to avoid locking myself out.
