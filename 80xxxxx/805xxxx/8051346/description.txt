For XVID AVI with MP3 audio, Compared to the alternative, should be a 12:
V=9
A=9
.
Well, brand new series and LOL / DIM screw it up within the first minute.
This replaces "Gross Pixelation Errors" @ 00:31 in ALL previous versions.
Nice of them to screw up so soon, unlike Fringe (27min into second hour).
