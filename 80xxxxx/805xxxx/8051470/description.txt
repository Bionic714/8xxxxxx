Miasmata 2.1.0
==============

Miasmata has been updated to version 2 and is now available for download. Unfortunately, the new update was too big to offer as a patch and we made an all new installer instead. This should not affect your save games but please do back them up just in case.

What has changed:

1) Optimizations
- Framerate improved by 10-50% or more
- Frequent in-game stutter has been reduced significantly

2) Additions
- Windowed Mode
- Vsync
- FOV (Field of View) Adjustment Slider

3) Important Bug Fixes
- Late-game creature interaction improved
- Many small bugs

How to play:
1) Run setup_miasmata_2.1.0.5.exe and install the game;
2) Launch the game using main executable or shortcuts.

If you like the game, BUY it!
