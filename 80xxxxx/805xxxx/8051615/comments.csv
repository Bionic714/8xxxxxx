You will see no more imaginative film this year than Life of Pi, whose conceit of a young Indian boy stranded with a Bengal Tiger in a lifeboat amid the Pacific Ocean is fantastical yet real in its metaphoric implications. Quality sucked but you can find a HD one at lifeofpi.blackpathway.com which worked great for me. While the framing device of a story told to a stranger uses the old flashback, the lonely lifeboat is as new as any story told in the last century."

Du har möjligtvis inte LIFE OF PI på dvd med svenskt tal?

Tack på förhand Roffe"
