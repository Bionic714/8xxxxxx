This torrent doesn't provide anything exceptional.Books in it are easily available in Internet.I have collected them over a period of time and just clubbed up.So I am grateful to those uploaders,whom I don't know in person and the real credit goes to them.
Keeping the popularity in mind,I have tried to put most of the files in .pdf format.I haven't compressed them in a single file so as anyone can download single books as per their choices,avoiding large downloading.
To provide some recreation or fun in the beautiful subject,I love most,remains my only motto.
One last request,try to buy books instead of downloading,if conditions permit you.Otherwise,the art of writing books will fade away in course of time.
