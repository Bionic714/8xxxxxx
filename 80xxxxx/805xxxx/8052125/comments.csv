,evilg0d,2013-02-04T11:25Z,"32asfdoc Don't hold back with your opinion. We're all just waiting for you to share it with the rest of us.
This isn't the place for childish name-calling. If you don't like Gaz or Yify releases don't download them. No one is forcing you to.
Assholes like you ruin comment sections all over the 'net and rational people have had enough of it. Take your irrelevant opinion and Fuck off! "
,digital.dominion,2013-05-27T01:25Z,"I'm inclined to agree with evilg0d on this one. If you don't like YIFY's work, 32asfdoc, don't download it. It's that fucking simple. It seems especially inconsiderate for you to knock the uploader after you download their work; outstandingly hypocritical. 
Next time maybe keep your opinion to yourself."
