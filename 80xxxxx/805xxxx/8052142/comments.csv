True experts rarely make definitive statements.  Physical scientists, economists, and other with proper training always make statements based on the best available information and in the language of probability.  Scientists know and accept that they could be wrong, that what they say today could be proven incorrect tomorrow given new evidence.

It is the public (and especially those in the media who want to sensationalize everything) who jump on statements as being absolute truths without an adequate understanding of scientific reasoning who are the ones at fault here."
