I will do a test install on Win7 x86 at the weekend, hopes it will work."
,slugfestwastaken,2013-01-24T13:41Z,"Tested on Win 7 64 bit.

Crack causes application to fail and crash. If I can find more debug info I'll share it."
,cohecho,2013-02-06T06:27Z,"yep, not working on Win 7 x86. Even trying opening in compatibility mode as Win XP SP3 doesn't work. Too bad!"

Because it says 'Cannot Connect to Prezi.com' when trying to register...
