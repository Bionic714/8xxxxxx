 Mark Kermode talks to director Sam Mendes about his latest film, Skyfall - the 
 23rd outing of the James Bond series. Featuring contributions from Skyfall 
 stars Daniel Craig, Javier Bardem and Dame Judi Dench, this Culture Show 
 Special also reflects on Mendes' prolific career in both film and theatre. From 
 directing Dench in the West End at just 24 years of age, to sweeping the board 
 at the Oscars with his debut movie American Beauty, Mendes has always done 
 things his way. Celebrated for his visual elegance and ability to coax great 
 performances from his actors, the director reveals why he wanted to take on 
 Bond and what surprises lie in store for Skyfall audiences around the world. 
   
                                 Enjoy!
