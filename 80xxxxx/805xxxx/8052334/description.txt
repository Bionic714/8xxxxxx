If you admired the apocalyptic standard set by A Clockwork Orange, you'll love this dazzling Nic Cramer 35mm film, where droogs are still droogs, but their tonic is sex, not violence. Alex (Kaitlyn Ashley) and her gang (Isis Nile, Olivia, Rebecca Lord) roam dingy alleys in a search for wanton sex against a rich noir cityscape setting. First they attack a street bum (Dick Nasty), and Rebecca Lord winds up with a very wet, gooey facial. Then a man in a wheelchair (Jon Dough) succumbs to these wild-eyed street nymphs. Soon after, Alex is seduced by her parole officer (Shelby Stevens), and is committed to an asylum where Jonathan Morgan and Nikole Lace try to recondition her out of her nymphomania. Is this the final era of Planet Earth? Perhaps. The future of adult film? Definitely!
