                           DESCRiPTiON 

 You know youre a proper A-list celebrity when TV programmes start showing 
 before they were famous clips of you. So, congratulations to 2012 Britains 
 Got Talent winner Pudsey who makes his third festive appearance in the 
 schedules with home video of his early puppy days.
 
 Pudsey shares top dog billing with Uggie, the scene-stealing Jack Russell 
 terrier who won the Palm Dog Award at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival for his 
 role in The Artist. But other animals have achieved global celebrity, too. Take 
 a bow Crystal, the capuchin monkey from the Night at the Museum films and 
 online sensations Nora the piano-playing cat and waterskiing squirrel Twiggy. 
   
                                 Enjoy!
