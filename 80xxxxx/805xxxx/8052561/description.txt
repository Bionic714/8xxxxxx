Sony Music will release Destiny's Child "ove Songs", a new career-spanning collection of the most sensual and romantic recordings from the best-selling vocal group, in Ireland on Friday 25th January, 2013.
 
Comprised mainly of romantic gems recorded between 1997 and 2004, "Love Songs" features "Nuclear", the first new Destiny's Child recording since 2004. Produced by Pharrell Williams (who co-wrote the track with DC's Michelle Williams, James Fauntleroy and Lonny Bereal), "Nuclear" features vocal production by Beyoncé and Lonny Bereal.
 
Generally known for their dance floor pop and R&B anthems, Destiny's Child demonstrate their equally compelling command of contemporary torch songs and ballads throughout "Love Songs".
