 -  Snapshot  is  the tale of a lone robot lost in an abandoned world. Armed '
 '  with  only  his  trusty camera, Pic sets forth on his great adventure. A
 `  camera might not seem like enough for  a  puzzle  platforming adventure,
 .  but  this  camera is different from most: it has the ability to  capture
    and remove from the world the very objects that it photographs. Not only
 .  that, but it can also use its powers to  paste  the  photos it took back
    into the environment!
 .
 :  Everything that the camera captures is perfectly preserved, and when the
 |  photos are restored  the  objects are restored with it. On top of all of
 |  that, this amazing  camera  can  also  rotate  the photos before they're
 |  pasted. Take  a  picture of an incoming fireball, rotate it and paste it
 |  to send it flying into a wall of heavy boxes to knock it out of the way.
 |  See  what  kind  of crazy things can happen to Pic with his awesome (and
 |  probably magical) camera during the adventure of his life!
 |
 |  Features :
 |
 |
 |  ┬║ A unique photography mechanic that lets you take a picture of the game
 |    world and paste it back in elsewhere.
 |  ┬║ Over 100 different  levels  of  platforming  and  puzzling, 4 distinct
 |    environments  to  explore,   all  with  hand-crafted  high  resolution
 |    graphics.                                                              .
 |  ┬║ Secrets  and  time trial challenges for every level ensure that you'll .
 |    never play the same way twice!                                         :
