Short bio: 

Boxed Wine is an indie pop band from New Jersey that formed in late 2011. After getting a solid lineup together, they quickly released a self-titled EP and started referring to themselves in the third person. It took the band a while to come up with a name as meaningful as Boxed Wine, but they believe it says everything it should. The groupΓÇÖs influences are quite varied, but they generally love mixing pop structures with fuzzy bass and disco beats. Ultimately, their goal is to make music that anybody can enjoy and hopefully dance to.

Why youΓÇÖre holding this:

Boxed Wine is pleased to announce the release of this new EP, acting as a ΓÇÿsamplerΓÇÖ for their debut album coming out in a few months. The three songs chosen lean toward rock, pop, and dance vibes, respectively. Still, they hope youΓÇÖll like all three and choose whatever fits well on your station.

A bit of press:

"ΓÇªSirius XMU-ready anthems that will no doubt have these dudes burning up the festival circuit by this time next year." ΓÇô Modern American Weekly

"ΓÇªjangly pop right out of the top drawer. If your band is going to play guitar driven music nowadays it has to be jangly and fun. This ticks both boxes and an element of indie fuzziness too. Clean vocals and a good chorus make it a catchy and potential festival favourite." ΓÇô Blushing Panda

ΓÇ£ΓÇªextremely likable power-pop with terrific melodies and interesting beats ΓÇô sweet, fizzy, and as intoxicating as a 5-liter box of FranziaΓÇÖs best swill.ΓÇ¥ ΓÇô Jim Testa (Jersey Beat)
