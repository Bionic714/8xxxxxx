Adventure Time with Finn & Jake - Season 5 - Episodes 7 and 8 (WEB-DL - 720p - MP4)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Just another season in the Land of Ooo. Ooor is it? Jake's a daddy now and has
a litter of pups to raise. LetΓÇÖs hope itΓÇÖs not too much of a stretch (get it?!)
for him. Finn's a celebrity hero in need of anonymity, but will he take his low
profile too far? What time is it? Time for Five. Five More Short Graybles,
that is! Speaking of sequels, Fionna and Cake are back for another
flippy-floppy special episode. And The Lich is on the loose! Will this
spell the end for Finn, Jake and the Land of Ooo as we know it?!!!!!!!!
I can't even put enough exclamation points on that last sentence.
