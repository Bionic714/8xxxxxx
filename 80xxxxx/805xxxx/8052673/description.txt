The original DVD release of season 5 for the 1987 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cartoon series did not contain two episodes. The second episode called "Once Upon a Time Machine" was missing, as was the double length "Planet of the Turtleoids" episode, which should be numbered episodes 21 and 22 for that particular season.

The release of season 10 contained these missing episodes as special features, but none of the other torrents currently around have these episodes included as a rip. I downloaded the ISO for season 10 and ripped these episodes for my own use but decided to share them for your viewing pleasure.

Of note: I'm not an encoder. I'm sure I could have packed the files smaller or in a better container. I don't particularly care myself. If you want to make them smaller, be my guest. Also: no subtitles are included.
