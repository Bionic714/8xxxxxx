,nic25magg,2013-01-29T10:03Z,"Dear fairytales2,

First of all, thank you for trying my uploads and for your comments.

Secondly, Windows did not prevent me to delete the folder after using this Program.

If such prevention occur, the most probable reason is that a sub-program is still in use and may be in ghost mode. Please get Process Explorer at 

http://www.filehippo.com/download_process_explorer/

to see which sub-programs prevent deletion. You will get more description on each program compare to Windows Task Manager"
