,DJSABREBLADE,2013-02-08T07:39Z,if this is the retail blu ray quality than i have to say that i am disapointed. seems to be bleak bland and lack color even more than the retail dvd. i think i prefer the MCFLY version personally. but thats just me. maybe a real blu ray will one day be released! cheers and heres to hoping that wil happen :)
