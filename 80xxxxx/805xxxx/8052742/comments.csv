,DenDenDenDen,2013-01-23T21:27Z,Thanx but what about season 8 and 7? will you upload them too?
,fart_toy,2013-01-24T01:59Z,"do you ned them uploaded in mp4 format, like this one? or do you want the dvd's?"
,DenDenDenDen,2013-01-24T11:04Z,dvd's would be very great in ISO format like you did the first time with season 10. please  upload them and help turtle fans get their favourite cartoon.
,DenDenDenDen,2013-01-24T11:10Z,When can we expect season 8 and 9 in ISO format?
,DenDenDenDen,2013-01-24T11:11Z,I meant season 7 and 8
,fart_toy,2013-01-26T04:20Z,i probably wont be uploading those seasons in dvd iso format.  the only reason I uploaded this season was because it wasn't currently available.
,DenDenDenDen,2013-01-26T10:10Z,Your choice but unfortunately not all people live in USA and can buy these dvds to watch their favourite cartoon in good quality.Think that's really unfair.
,fart_toy,2013-01-27T12:24Z,would you want them in mp4 format?
,DenDenDenDen,2013-01-27T13:29Z,Yes please.
,dejandeko,2013-01-30T19:08Z,"in ISO format would be great like the one from your other torrent.
@DenDenDenDen is right not all people like in USA and can buy the DVDs :D
So can you upload some seasons(if possible all of them) ?"
,dejandeko,2013-01-30T19:16Z,and when can we expect them ? anyway if you can put all the ISOs in one torrent would be awsome :D
,fart_toy,2013-02-01T02:35Z,"I'll be honest guys. I'm more interested in converting my existing videos into itunes video libraries with thorough metadata.  I only uploaded the iso because I was hoping originally that I wouldnt have to do it myself, but ended up doing it myself anyways."
,DenDenDenDen,2013-02-01T10:07Z,We agree with your terms fart_toy please upload season 7 and 8 in format that is most convinient to you nor me or my children can wait to have this amazing cartoon in better quality then web provides.When you upload?If possible do not delay please:)
,DenDenDenDen,2013-02-06T22:49Z,fart_toy it unfortunately looks like you are not going to do anything at all. thank you for all you've done but you could've done a lot more and you know that...
,fart_toy,2013-03-14T19:18Z,wont upload anything tha is already available. seasons 7 and 8 are already available in dvd rip formats on tpb. just do a simple search.
