,kdsnm,2013-01-23T15:08Z,"Hi. Thanks for your uploads. Hard to find European comics. Are you going to scan Largo Winch The Price of Money and The Law of the Dollar? Again thanks, great job."
[T],data9724,2013-01-23T19:01Z,"Yes, I'll scan the next Largo Winch books eventually. But go buy them while you wait."
,MouloukZarak,2013-01-27T23:48Z,"hey man, that's nice, but you should have also uploaded them in french ! First volume is full of nearly incomprehensible stuff or bad english as would be from a foreigner.

Anyhoo I don't mean to be grumpy as fan subs are always full of dedication and hard sweat but still the first volume is pretty bad. 

Keep up the good work, thanks"
[T],data9724,2013-01-28T19:21Z,"Hehe, this is FAR from the worst i have seen, trust me :) But yeah, they're not all that great, but neither is the 15 mb french scans...
BUT I have ordered all 4 in french, and got a person to do a new scanlation, so hopefully we will have a good version out soon :)"
