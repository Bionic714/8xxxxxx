A) Cameron Monaghan is literally THE worst actor on the show,
B) Ian looks all the more horrendous now that he has a military cut, and
C) This is just plain creepy, Dr. Bob. Were he older, it would be a littttle more plausible...but he's still a minor, mate. Annnnd I saw the first ""All Ian"" file from back in 2011...

...creepy."

As I said in the main section ""If you like what I've done, leave a comment.  If not, leave a comment.""

Thanks for the Creepy comment!

Ever since you've left that comment the amount of people getting this torrent has increased.  

When making these torrents, I never thought of them as creepy.  I just liked the acting and interaction of Ian Gallagher in the various senarios he was presented with.

Well folks in the spirit of Shameless we have in this torrent the non-creepy, the sorta-creepy, and the very creepy!!!!!!!

Jump onboard and see what all the fuss is about!

PS: He is a good actor (though I agree not the best on the show, however, not the worst either!)
His hair cut............really.........you think he has a real choice over that as an actor?
Creepy = Shameless. (btw, I mentioned that this has all his scenes in it, NOT just the ""sex"" scenes.)

Peace to all."
