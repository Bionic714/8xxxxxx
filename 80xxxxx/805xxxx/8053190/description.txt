Contents :  Well I've enjoyed the series so much, and especially the acting abilities of Cameron Monaghan 
A.K.A. Ian Gallagher, that I put together a compilation of all the scenes that he appeared in.  Now if he just 
appeared in a scene and had no real input into that scene, (ie. not much talking, in the backround, etc.)  
I did not include it.  I had taken the scenes from the episodes downloaded from this site.  Special thanks 
goes to all the uploaders for their help.  I used a simple video editing software program to just cut and 
paste them together as one big avi file.  


Cameron takes a very challanging role, that of a gay teen in the seedy side of Chicago, and performs it extremely well.

If you like what I've done, leave a comment.  If not, leave a comment.

Anyway I did this project for myself in 2011 after the first season and uploaded it here (Feel free to look for it on the piratebay site).  Since season 2 is complete and season 3 is actively comming out, I thought that I would tackle Ian Gallagher for the complete season 2.

I find it more enjoyable following a single caracter than when all the story lines are intwined together.




enjoy!!
