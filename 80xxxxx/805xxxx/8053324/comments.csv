when I say soon... I mean directly after the incredible hulk.. because seriously... gotta have that in there along with what I've already done being thor and captain America (which is my first upload on here that unfortunately has only what.. 9 seeders?... it has nearly identical settings and good quality and has the same file breakdown as I have atm.)

anywho... I want to put up incredible hulk next and then avengers... then i'm off into the trilogies and the harry potter series."

?"

Appreciate the link, but unfortunately that is the DVD unrated version... Trying to find a Bluray Unrated version of ultraviolet that isn't ""japanese"" only or what have you is the issue. Actually there isn't anything OTHER than the DVD version of the unrated one on amazon. This covers numerous other retailers. I've tried.. When i initially went to make my purchase it was one of the things i was most unhappy about, i was forced to purchase the rated version which is just terrible in comparison."
