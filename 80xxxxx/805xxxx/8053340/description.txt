Dark Horse proudly presents Joe R. Lansdale's cult novel, Dead in the West! Why dress up for Halloween as a cowboy, Indian, or walking corpse when you can see them mixing it up in East Texas, 1876? The residents of Mud Creek have trouble on their hands when only a down-on-his-luck preacher with a six-gun and a boy stand between the town and an army of the living dead, re-animated by an Indian shaman's curse. Jack Jackson is at the height of his form with Dead in the West -- his art gives a feeling of authenticity that perfectly complements the story and will leave you covered in goosebumps. For all fans of A Fistful of Dollars and Night of the Living Dead, this book is for you!

Enjoy and seed!
