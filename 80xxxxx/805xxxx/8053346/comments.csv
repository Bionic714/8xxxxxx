,Klazik666,2013-01-24T06:44Z,"Apparently Conan is not as popular as Colbert or Jon Stewart :(

jsv88: If you don't have problems with direct downloads, check out sites like lateshows dot net or scnsrc dot me"
,.Leto.,2013-01-24T10:26Z,"RAR and 1GB?? no way I'm going to download this!
Like Klassik said you can find a smaller version on other sites."

,.Leto.,2013-01-24T17:23Z,"@Klazik666: thanks for the advice about direct links, I've already found a few recent 300-400MB shows that aren't uploaded here yet. I'm really tired of that RAR 1GB crap!!"
