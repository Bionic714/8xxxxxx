This is, for the most part, Nick Drake's discography. The only things left out are the compilations that aren't that important. That means compilations that don't contain any unreleased material such as the 1971 S/T album, 1994's "Way To Blue", or 1985's "Heaven in a Wild Flower".

Everything has a CBR of 320.
