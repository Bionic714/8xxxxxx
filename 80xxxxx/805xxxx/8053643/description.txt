"What Happens at Howdy's, Doesn't Stay at
                                    Howdy's"

Frank wants to throw Jimmy a memorable 
bachelor party, but Jimmy resists the idea, 
citing the crazy things that tend to happen 
when he goes wild (such as impregnating 
serial killers). But, when Sabrina convinces 
him to cut loose, things get a little out of 
control and Frank reveals an ulterior motive 
for encouraging Jimmy's outlandish behavior.
