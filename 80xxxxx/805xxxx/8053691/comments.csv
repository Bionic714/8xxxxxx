,Chaos_Seer,2013-03-06T05:41Z,"I installed the one e-reader in the list, and while it loads fine it does fail to load any ebooks, and without error messages. It simply doesn't load any pages. Anyone else have this experience?"
,hobo100,2013-03-07T20:45Z,Yes...e-book reader does not appear to work as installed. Indexs fine..but just a white page when opened. Have heard this from others installing e-readers.
