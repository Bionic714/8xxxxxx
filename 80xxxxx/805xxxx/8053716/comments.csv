,malger,2013-01-23T16:12Z,"Issue 12 is from the first Booster Gold series, not this one."
,tpacomics,2013-01-24T00:21Z,"Malger, you can get ish #12 here: http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/5272205/Booster_Gold_v2_001-027_(up-to-date)
Just click download torrent file and choose only the file you want. It won't take long since it has 8 seeders, and all you want is like 20mb."
,m0thhhh,2013-01-26T00:32Z,THANK YOU SO MUCH! I've been looking everywhere for this! Booster Gold is my favorite of the DC bunch.

I thought it was due to the browser but it's the same when I tried it in IE, Firefox or safari. Really really want this bundle!"
