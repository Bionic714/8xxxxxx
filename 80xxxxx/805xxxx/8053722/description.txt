"Misery Loves Company"

Aria is down for the count when sidelined by the 
flu, so Hanna and Emily are on their own to follow 
up on a new clue. Surprisingly, Meredith steps up 
to help take care of Aria while her father is away, 
but when it starts to look like Meredith may have 
ulterior motives to her nursing Aria back to 
health, Hanna and Emily turn their attention 
towards saving their friend. Is Meredith just 
trying to start anew with Aria and be her number 
one fan, or is there reason for her friends to be 
concerned?
