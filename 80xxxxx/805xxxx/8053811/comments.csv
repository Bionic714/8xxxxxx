,Nikoli1129,2013-01-23T15:09Z,Seed please.  Been stuck at 0.1% since last night.
,turtlex,2013-01-23T20:38Z,I'm stuck too.  
,Fausto99,2013-01-23T23:23Z,"My access to Internet is somewhat limited... I am able to seed it from 3pm to 10pm Central Time Zone. Sometimes I can seed it for a few more hours, so it may vary.

The quality of the scans is very good and I got rid of all the ads so the waiting is worth. Sorry for the slow speed, I am hoping it will improve once more people finish downloading it."
,Fausto99,2013-01-24T00:53Z,"I am using a netbook at the moment, so when I move out where there is no Internet, it stop seeding... I prepared a PC to seed it all night :) Hopes that helps with the speed."
,liquitas,2013-01-24T18:28Z,Would love to help seed but stuck at 2.5%
,Nikoli1129,2013-01-26T20:18Z,"Anything you can do to seed this better?  Been downloading it for four days now and the best I've gotten to is 26%.
I appreciate your work putting this torrent together, but it'd be awesome if we could all enjoy it."
,Fausto99,2013-01-27T22:51Z,"@Nikoli1129: This Torrent it is the only one I am seeding, I disabled all my other completed downloads to free the upload speed just for this Torrent. It is uploading at 15KB/s at max speed with an average upload speed of 9KB/s... I am cant aford to upgrade my connection to upload faster, all I can do is to keep seeding at this speed.

To avoid interrupting the uploading at night, I set a PC I can have working all the time as the host for this Torrent... I am seeding it since 3 days ago without interruption, it is all I can do to ""boost"" the speed, unless there is a trick somewhere to speed up uploading speed. I searched around but I could not find anything useful.

I know my uploading speed is not great, so I am very glad for the people that started to seed it right away. Sadly I am the only one with 100% at the moment, so I ama afraid the speed will remain the same. :("
,gldnarm66,2013-01-29T02:27Z,"Fausto99, what is your upload speed? 1 byte per second? This will take one year to finish! Get a real computer!"
,liquitas,2013-01-30T04:50Z,"http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8082066

Try this you guys.  I assembled my own version of this torrent (with some additions) and while my UL speed isn't THE BEST, it should still be a lot better than this.  I appreciate the effort Fausto, I'm just trying to help out some folks that might be frustrated with the wait."
,Fausto99,2013-02-04T02:11Z,Thanks for the support guys! I will never upload Torrents again :)
,X-STORM,2013-03-12T01:42Z,This a good torrent Fausto!
