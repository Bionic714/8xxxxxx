This Torrent includes "Madrox"(5 of 5) that works as an introduction to X-Factor Investigations, of course contains the whole Volume 3 (2005-2013 still ongoing) from #1 to #249 and all the comics involved in Messiah Complex since they have a big impact on X-Factor.

There are some complementary comics like "The quick and the dead" and "Layla Miller", I put them in the correct order, so you can read them with the rest of the serie.

X-Factor is connected at some point with Secret Invasion but since that Arc is so big, I did not include it. There are other good Torrents with a good speed if you want to download the whole Secret Invasion. X-Factor participation is small.

Following what happens in Messiah Complex, there is another small Arc named Second Coming but the participation of X-Factor is small too. (I can upload it too, just ask) 





Please, help me to seed it.






Disclaimer: The scans are not mine, I am just gathering them in one Torrent. Special thanks for the uploaders that worked so hard on this serie.
