"Emily and... The Teapot"

When Emily, Will and Cassandra compete against 
each other to be Dr. Bandari's research 
assistant, feelings get hurt when they have to 
describe each other's flaws. Emily is 
determined to solve the medical mystery of a 
young patient whose x-rays reveals a bullet 
lodged in his lung, but who has no signs of a 
gunshot wound or scar. Meanwhile, Emily comes 
to a revelation about her personal life after 
diagnosing a daredevil with a rare disease that 
forces him to change his entire life.
