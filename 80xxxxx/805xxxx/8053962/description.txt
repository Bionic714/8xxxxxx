ASAP is missing approximately one minute of the show. They will
try to argue that it's the previously on but nowhere either on screen
or on the audio track does it mention this is Previously On "The Lying Game"
Typically shows will have one or both of those occur so we know this happened
in the past

It's clearly the setup for the entire show, similar to the opening of Burn Notice
where it explains . In addition the ABCF bug is already full formed and
in place and the TV rating one is long gone. There's no point in these CRF days to cut
that and it shows a sloppy careless approach to preing TV. No quality gained by removing
it

I say we remove the optional wording for Previously On in the rules and give people
what they want. Protect for glitches if you want (in those sections) which is why
the rule was initially put in but come on
