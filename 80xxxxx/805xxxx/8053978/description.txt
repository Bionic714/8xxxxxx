Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site :: On the Tuesday, January 22 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex returns to the airwaves and continues fending off the seemingly endless barrage of anti-Second Amendment propaganda. He'll also break down the Facebook warning from a Nobel Peace Prize Nominee declaring the "litmus test" for military leaders being whether or not they will fire on U.S. citizens, the fallout following Obama's two inaugurations and more.

On today's show, Alex welcomes Lloyd Alan Chapman, president and founder of the American Small Business League, to explain how Obama's second-term, and notably Obamacare, could spell certain doom for American small business owners.

Television show host, broadcaster, and film-maker Max Keiser also joins us today.
