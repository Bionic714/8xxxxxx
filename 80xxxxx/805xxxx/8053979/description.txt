RELEASES:
Once.Upon.a.Time.S01E01.DVDRip.XviD-REWARD &
Once.Upon.A.Time.S01E02.DVDRip.XviD-CLUE-Once.Upon.A.Time.S01E22.DVDRip.XviD-CLUE

NOTE: S01E01 is from REWARD DVDRip, who must have gotten a commercial sampler.  For some reason CLUE did not rip S01E01.  Also, there is no SUBPACK.  Don't blame me; I'm just the uploader, and you should be grateful for a non HDTV rip with no logos.

NOTE: Three samples are included as well as the NFO files.

NOTE: This may be a slow upload, taking a few days, so please be patient!

NOTE: I suggest downloading VLC Media Player to watch this release.  You can download it here:

A few important and simple keyboard shortcuts for VLC are:

Double click: Fullscreen
Spacebar: Play/Pause
V key: Enable/Disable/Change Language of Subtitles.
G/H key: Subtitle Delay (-50ms/+50ms each tap)
J/K key: Audio Delay (-50ms/+50ms each tap)

NOTE: I am in the process of uploading all the recent BDRIPS/DVDRips of popular TV shows that are not on TPB.  Considering I do not have fast upload speeds, nor do I have constant Internet access, AND there are pretty much unlimited DVDRips/BDRips to upload, this will take a super long time.  However, let me know if you have a request, and I will see what I can do.

Enjoy; please rate, comment, and seed!
