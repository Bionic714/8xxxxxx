.: Plot :.
What happens when an exuberant, irresponsible dreamer who always says ΓÇ£yesΓÇ¥ moves in with his overly responsible little sister to help raise her five-year-old daughter? BEN AND KATE, a new single-camera young ensemble comedy, follows these odd-couple siblings as they push each other out of their comfort zones and into real life. KATE FOX (Dakota Johnson, ΓÇ£The Social NetworkΓÇ¥) followed the rules all her lifeΓÇªuntil she got pregnant in college and dropped out just shy of graduation. After the birth of her daughter, MADDIE (Maggie Jones, ΓÇ£We Bought a Zoo,ΓÇ¥ ΓÇ£FootlooseΓÇ¥), Kate put her twenties on hold. Now working as a bar manager to make ends meet and maximize her time with five-year-old Maddie, sheΓÇÖs uber-prepared for every possible catastrophe ΓÇô except for the arrival of her older brother, BEN FOX (Nat Faxon, ΓÇ£Bad TeacherΓÇ¥). Ben likes trouble a lot more than his sister does. His infectious energy makes you want to follow him into any number of bad ideas. HeΓÇÖll totally screw up your life, but somehow, youΓÇÖll feel good about it. Where Kate is all about planning and preparing, Ben is big on spontaneity and out-of-the-box ideas. But donΓÇÖt let the Velcro wallet fool you ΓÇô heΓÇÖll probably be a millionaire someday. When Ben comes to crash on KateΓÇÖs couch for a few days, he finds a sad state of affairs. KateΓÇÖs surviving, but not living. Ben realizes that for the first time in their lives, Kate needs his help and heΓÇÖs determined to bring some much-needed chaos into her overly stable world. He starts by offering to help look after Maddie so Kate can get back to experiencing her mid-twenties and making mistakes, since the one real ΓÇ£mistakeΓÇ¥ sheΓÇÖs made turned out to be the best thing that ever happened to her. Always there to help with BenΓÇÖs crazy schemes is his partner-in-crime, TOMMY (newcomer Echo Kellum), who worships Ben like a hero and nurses a serious crush on Kate. KateΓÇÖs British best friend, BJ (Lucy Punch, ΓÇ£Bad TeacherΓÇ¥), is a cocktail waitress at the bar that Kate manages and an all-around hot mess who would do anything for Kate, even if her advice is often questionable and occasionally illegal. From writer/executive producer Dana Fox (New Girl, ΓÇ£What Happens in VegasΓÇ¥) and executive producer/director Jake Kasdan (New Girl, ΓÇ£Bad TeacherΓÇ¥), BEN AND KATE is a heartwarming story of deeply mismatched siblings: a sister who needs to go for her dreams and a brother who needs to get his head out of the clouds.
