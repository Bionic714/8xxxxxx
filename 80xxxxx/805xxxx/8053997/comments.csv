,KShelbrock2,2013-01-23T09:17Z,I dont know what the problem is bet when there are 662 available seeds and I can only connect and download from them at 40-50kbs there is a problem... are you guys allowing encyrpted data transfer?? if not you need too... 
,KShelbrock2,2013-01-23T09:21Z,and make sure you allow incoming legacy connections through your torrent down-loader...
