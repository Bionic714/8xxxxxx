,slaemerstrakur,2013-01-23T05:26Z,Great show. Can't believe I discovered it just 3 weeks ago.
,Mr_Heisenberg,2013-01-23T06:46Z,audio goes out of sync about half way through. vlc player fix is +400ms
,Hemude,2013-01-23T07:45Z,Audio sync is off in the second half. Get the torrent labeled PROPER instead of this.
,.Leto.,2013-01-23T13:16Z,"Don't download the ASAP release, it's out of sync. Get the PROPER release instead:
