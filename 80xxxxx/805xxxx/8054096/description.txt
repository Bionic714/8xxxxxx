.: Plot :.
At long last, Emily Owens feels like she is an actual grown-up. She can finally put her high school days as the geeky-girl-with-flop-sweats behind her; sheΓÇÖs graduated from medical school and is now a first-year intern at Denver Memorial Hospital, where sheΓÇÖll have the chance to work with world-famous cardiologist Dr. Gina Beckett ΓÇô and where, not-so-coincidentally, her med-school crush Will Rider is also an intern. So why does everyone keep warning her that the hospital is just like high school? Emily soon finds out the hard way ΓÇô her high school nemesis, the gorgeous, popular Cassandra Kopelson, is also just starting out at Denver Memorial, and it seems like theyΓÇÖre rivals all over again ΓÇô not only as surgical interns, but for WillΓÇÖs attention. Fellow intern Tyra Granger warns Emily that the cliques at Denver Memorial are all too familiar: the jocks have become orthopedic surgeons; the mean girls are in plastics; the rebels are in the ER, and Tyra has her own Awkward place as the principalΓÇÖs kid ΓÇô her father is the chief resident. EmilyΓÇÖs the new kid all over again, and itΓÇÖs just as Awkward as high school. Only this time around, Emily will have to balance the personal and emotional turmoil of social politics with the high-stakes world of life-and-death medical decisions. At least she has fellow intern Tyra and nerdy-but-cute resident Micah, to count on as friends. Emily is growing to realize that although she may be a geek, she may also grow to be a great doctor, flop sweats and all.
