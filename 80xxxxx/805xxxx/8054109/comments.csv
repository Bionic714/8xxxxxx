,kille10000,2013-01-28T00:20Z,"Thx for a great upload! =)

I seem to having some problems installing the maps I want.
Navigon automaticlly downloads about 500mb of maps for San Mario, The Vatican City, Andorra and Monaco.

I tried to restart the phone and download the maps I want but it doesnt work.

Does anyone know what the problem might be?

Thx in advance!"
,DuRoi,2013-01-28T03:45Z,"First time that happen to me because of problems with Wifi connection, yes you need to download maps with wifi connection and not with regular 3G GPRS connection (almost sure), but then i try a few times with patience and phone in other place to receive better signal from wifi and i got it to work. Try also to do one search in google first just to make sure your wifi connection is working good. Like that i think you can finaly download maps you need. Tell us if you got it to work."
,toorentz,2013-01-29T05:55Z,"You better check your wifi connection. 
I think the problem is connection. "
,imperator_eu,2013-01-30T17:26Z,Thank you toorentz! My girlfriend won't have to rotate the printed map in their hands anymore :-)
,eshborn,2013-02-02T11:40Z,"Just a fast Question will this work on my GPS or do i have to have  Android ??

I have a Navigon GPS but was wondering if the software would work ??

thank you "
,DuRoi,2013-02-04T04:43Z,"I think this one is just for Android devices. I don´t know if there is other version (not android) that fits your needs. Try to search in Navigon web site, may be you will be lucky."
