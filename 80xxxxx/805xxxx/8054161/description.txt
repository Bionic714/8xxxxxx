Based on the work of Ratiborus's KMSmicro v3.10
heldigard gives many thanks in his text file.
Read it and you can find out who else are activation champions.

KMSNano is an Offline KMS Activator that emulates a KMS server in the memory of
your computer and sends activation data back and forth attempting to activate
volume versions of Windows and Office. I have personally activated KMSNano without
having my lan drivers even installed on a fresh install of Windows 7.

This is v15 with an updated KMSELDI tool. I have also included TriggerKMSv8.
The trigger and kmseldi programs that came with normal v15 apparently had issues.
There are other earlier versions that may or may not work currently.
You should always check for the latest version before using.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Activates:
Windows Vista Business/Enterprise Default/N/VL
Windows 7 Pro/Enterprise Default/N/VL
Windows 8 Pro/Enterprise Default/N/VL
Windows Server Std/Data 2008/2008R2/2012
Office/OfficeVL 2010/2013.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Retail-Only Versions of windows that will NOT activate are:
Vista Starter/Homebasic/Homepremium/Ultimate - Default/N/E
7 Starter/Homebasic/Homepremium/Ultimate - Default/N/E
8 core/coreN/ProWMC
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Requirements: . NET 4.0 or Windows 8

Instructions:

1. Prescan file and then shut down Security Programs and any other running programs.
(Torrent program caused problem for me)
2. Extract the zip file. (Optional - I ran from within zip)
3. Run KMSnano.exe
4. Wait about 60-80secs while the files run in the background.
(It doesn't let you know when it's done, you can check task manager or just wait)
5. Run the Check_Activation.cmd to verify your activation status.
6. Go about your business. You can get the Win8 watermark to go away by
auto-hiding the taskbar or similar system stuff. (WindowsKey+D works also)

To fix any botched activations from other "hacktivators" or activation problems
in general, you can run admin command prompt command "SFC /SCANNOW"
I very much recommend running that command on older systems with stale system files
that may have a lot of inconsistencies.

To see if your currect activation is working, run the included script:
Check_Activation.cmd inside the zip file. That will list Windows and Office
activations. Read the included text file for more info.

Note that Pre-Release versions of Office or Windows will NEVER activate.
Get an actual release if you want to activate. (RTM or Retail)

For people trying to activate just Office 2013, extract kmsnano.exe to a directory
using 7-zip or Winrar. Run admin command prompt and navigate to the extracted
files directory. now run the command "kmseldi /qemu /noWin /no2010 /log"
Click on the little activation button once the qemu program is up and running
with it's little black screen. I was having trouble trying to activate regular
Windows 8 Pro VL with the kmseldi but the actual kmsnano.exe worked well.
So if Office 2013 doesn't activate, try a different version of kmsnano using those
commands.

If it does not activate Office, try running admin command
prompt command "SFC /SCANNOW" then repeating the command.
You can also run "SLMGR /REARM" and reboot to void any activation.

Why use this program over any other activation method?
-It does not modify any of your system files.
-Because it's not a crack or a hack.
-Because it's the only way to get legit activation without using legit servers.
-Did I mention it activates ALL KMS activation software?

(Extract LaNanov15.zip to a directory. Run the "Run Trigger.cmd" to set the
trigger to check activation every time you boot and activate if less than 30
days left on the 180day KMS activation. You can edit "Run Trigger.cmd" to change
how many days activation will have before expiration before the TriggerKMS runs
kmsnano.exe *CHEER*)*

*I could not get TriggerKMS to work on Win8 because of the system file blockage,
but I have inquired on the MDL boards and will advise in the comments if I can
figure out a way to get it to work. It runs, it just won't successfully install
the trigger to the Task Scheduler in Windows 8. When I get this stuff sorted out
I'm sure a Win8Pro pre-activated won't be far behind. I've already been trying
everything I can. I may settle for a runonce and leave further activation up
to the user. KMSNano doesn't install during setupcomplete.cmd on win8.

- Optimized for W7 and Office 2010 with KMSELDI v8.
- Automatic convert non activated support Windows versions to VL.
- Automatic skip permanent activated Windows versions.

- Automatic skip permanent activated Office versions.
- New KMS Client with simultaneous request.

- Clear KMS server name after installation.

TriggerKMS v8:
