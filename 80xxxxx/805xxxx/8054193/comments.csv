,Rizzo220,2013-01-23T20:10Z,"I currently have Compressor 3.5.3 on Snow Leopard.
Will this 4.0.6 work with my version of compressor  on SL?
Cheers!"
,nagah,2013-01-23T21:22Z,"@Rizzo220,

Compressor 4 minimum system requirements are an Intel Mac Core 2 Duo and Snow Leopard. So, you should be fine. Further: the Compressor 4 install will not remove your 3.5.3 version in case you need to fall back on that version."
,Rizzo220,2013-01-24T01:38Z,"@ Nagah... Thanks for the info. I d/l, named it Compressor2.app and works fine with 10.6.8 on my '07 MBP.

,revixi5,2013-02-11T08:24Z,"Same here... crash on opening. I suppose it is only an update, and not the complete software installation."
,quicrack,2013-02-25T08:29Z,"@revixi5

It should be a complete sofware installation, like it was earlier.
Please check reviews at Mac App Store page - some people are complaining about instability."
