The only thing is that my disc is scratched so you might not even be able to get it to work.  I was able to read pass the scratch with TransMac.  I do not know if TransMac adds or subtracts anything from the disc.  Anyways, thank you to Jesus Christ for only good in my life for the remainder of my lifetime on earth.  Amen.  Thank you Jesus Christ."
,repayfriendship,2013-01-23T09:52Z,"Jesus Christ!  I almost forgot, use Disk Utility in Mac to burn to disc before using it.  You can also partition a 40 gb section and install it directly onto your harddrive and boot from that section.  However, the disc method is easier.  This disc is for use in extreme emergency only.  I would go get one from Apple if you can.  If you get the chance and like this program, I would buy it direct from Apple.  Please enjoy and be legal.  hehe  I try.  "
