,rowsol,2013-01-26T15:59Z,The video is 30 fps but for some reason it feels like 15.  It could be my end.
,Nimh,2013-01-27T17:47Z,"Sir Paul does crappy encoding, that's why. 

Has problems with ps3's and many. many people complain of audio problems unless VLC is used. 

People say don't complain but a decent encode is compatible with many devices and programs. 
Sir Paul's uploads are not, though he is quick."

,kjhgviyvoiyoi,2013-02-03T20:43Z,"I would really liked to see this bacause of Jones and Sonnen. But all of this crying.. I mean really crying with tears. After 1min 25sec I've allready seen 3 men spilling tears over how hard it is where they come from. What the fuck?
Whats happening to USA? Their soldiers are crying, their fighters are crying, their presidents since Clinton sucks on their underlips trying to hold back tears like 3 year old European children.
I miss Patton, Reagan, John Wayne, Cassius Clay, Dirty Harry.
Fuck this fuck!

Thanks any way tykoon.."
,ReLoaDitt,2013-02-28T05:53Z,"Lol... a few ppl crying doesn't have to relate to all of USA, that's dumb. Thank you tykoon"
,extracube,2013-03-09T14:05Z,"Overall pretty good video quality.

Somewhat agree with comment above, vid rate can get a bit jerky once in a while, not huge but sometimes a bit noticeable.  Still I'll watch it.

@kjhgviyvoiyoi  excellent point, seems to have become fashionable for ""leaders"" in America to cry in public.  excellent point.

Thank you!"
