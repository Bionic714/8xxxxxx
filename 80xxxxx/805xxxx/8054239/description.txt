Getting their first significant break, by gatecrashing a Small Faces show in Orlando in 1971, Philadelphia-born Bang are often cited as being the closest band America had to Black Sabbath in the early 70ΓÇÖs, though there is much more to Bang than being mere copyists. This can finally be witnessed here on this deluxe remastered CD set, which encapsulates all of the bands recorded output from their Capitol Records Period, which spanned from 1971-1974. Also included in here is the previously unreleased, debut album Death of a Country, which was initially rejected by Capitol, as being a heavy concept album, they thought no one would understand. Highly regarded as a cult act by many for years, itΓÇÖs now time for this truly amazing rock band to be enjoyed by a new audience. (riseaboverecords.com)
