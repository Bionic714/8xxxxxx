,canukhed,2013-01-29T19:02Z,"Excellent as always.  Thank you for this, it is great for my older 32-bit PC's.

What is a comparable 64 bit version of XP Pro SP3 with similar additions/fixes and updates?"
,sdfbjklu,2013-01-30T04:50Z,"Thanks LuxLOL, I've used the black edition from you with success before, but am now having an issue. During the install after I format my hdd and setup copys the files setup prompts for a restart.  After the machine restarts however, setup does not resume it begins all over again.  The older copies of black edition that you posted never did this, any ideas why I am having this issue? Thanks"
,LuxLOL,2013-01-30T07:34Z,"You might double check your BIOS boot priority setting. Make sure that the HDD that you are installing Windows XP to is listed as the second boot device after the CD/DVD drive. If you only have the CD/DVD drive listed, then that would cause it to only boot from the CD/DVD like that."
,Ryall,2013-01-31T11:45Z,Thank you LuxLOL
,ss010991,2013-02-01T07:45Z,how do i open this .22 file??

One question, why haven't you switched to .NET 4.5 yet?
