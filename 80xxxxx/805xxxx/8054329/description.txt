Qlimax is an annual event held by the Dutch entertainment enterprise, Q-dance. It is considered one of the leading hardstyle events on the calendar and a major attraction of Q-dance and contains some of the most sophisticated production and setup for any event.

Like most of the Q-dance events, an anthem is made every year by the headlining DJ (with the exception of 2001 and 2002) to represent that edition. Below is a list of the anthems for each edition:

2007: Headhunterz - The Power Of The Mind
