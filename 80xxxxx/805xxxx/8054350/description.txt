Scene Notes
============

We want to reply to your words SKIDROW The fact  we  released  our  proper
release 41 days after your crack simply has to do with the  fact  that  our
members have a real life too and don't spend all their  time  playing  each
and every game pred the day or week  they  are  out.  We  did  notice  your
pathetic crack a few weeks afterwards when one of our  members  decided  to
try the game, using your release. The entire proper crack for this  release
was done in about two days and then thoroughly tested for  two  more.  Your
reaction it is not suitable to release a proper after such a long  time  is
understandable but nevertheless it doesn't change  the  fact  your  release
screamed for a "crapfix", old doesn't mean forgotten

Next, you mix up a fact that a loader  is  technically  the  same  like  an
emulation and try to claim everybody is only releasing unclean cracks. What
was it about the evolution ladder guys? It  seems  your  lab  monkeys  have
taken over the entire leadership of the group since the real  SKIDROW  died
in 1993. This can be the only reason you have come to the conclusion that a
modified startup flow  is  the  same  like  the  immitated  behavior  of  a
protection, like an EMU does it

So say what you want, you can talk all day but the simple fact remains, you
made a pathetic excuse for a xlive crack that would make any true  reverser
feel sick to his stomach. You then try to change the subject and move focus
(understandable as this must be embarrassing for you)  to Steam CEG cracks
All those who are interested in the next generation of your famous work can
examine Hitman Absolution, here you really teach the whole scene about  the
art of reversing by releasing an unmodifed protected exe (if you need proof
check  the  authenticode  signature  of  the  exe,  signed  by  valve)
which is nothing but a 100% Authentic loader solution

We thought since you love the Sims series so much, here  is  another  addon
also for you guys. Enjoy
