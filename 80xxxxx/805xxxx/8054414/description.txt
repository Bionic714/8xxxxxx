Zoey 101 is an American television series that ran from January 9, 2005, to May 2, 2008. It was created by Dan Schneider, produced for Nickelodeon and syndicated worldwide. The show stars Jamie Lynn Spears as teenager Zoey Brooks. It was initially filmed at Pepperdine University in Malibu, California, then at stages in Valencia, California beginning in season 3. It was nominated for an "Outstanding Children's Program" Emmy in 2005.[1] Zoey 101 was the most expensive production ever for Nickelodeon series, as it was shot completely on location in Malibu.[2] It was also Nickelodeon's best performance for a series premiere (live action or animation) in almost eight years.[2] Despite this, many critics have made negative comments about the show, its setting, and its characters.
