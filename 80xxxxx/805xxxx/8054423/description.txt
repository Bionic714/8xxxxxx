Fronted by the charismatic Aaron Beavers (guitar/ vocals) and joined by Harley Husbands (lead guitar), Mike Therieau (bass) Craig Bagby (drums), Shurman has just released their fifth full length album and eighth release overall on Teletone Records. The album, Inspiration, is nothing short of inspiring with heavy guitar drenched melodies and an intoxicating roots rock vibe. A shining example of what classic American rock is supposed to sound like. (turnstyledjunkpiled.com)
