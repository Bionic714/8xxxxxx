In the same way that Michael PollanΓÇÖs slim bestseller Food Rules brought a gust of common sense to the everyday activity of eating, Just Ride is a revelation. Forget the ultralight, uncomfortable bikes, flashy jerseys, clunky shoes that clip onto tiny pedals, the grinding out of endless miles. Instead, ride like you did when you were a kidΓÇöjust get on your bike and discover the pure joy of riding it.

A reformed racer whoΓÇÖs commuted by bike every day since 1980, whose writings and opinions appear in major bicycling and outdoor magazines, and whose company, Rivendell Bicycle Works, makes bikes for riders ready to opt out of a culture overrun by racing, Grant Petersen shares a lifetime of unexpected facts, controversial opinions, expert techniques, and his own maverick philosophy. In 87 short, two-to-three page chapters, it covers:

ΓÇó Riding: Count Days, Not Miles; Corner Like Jackie Robinson; Steer with Your Hips, Shift with Your Legs
ΓÇó Suiting Up: The Shoes Ruse; PonchosΓÇöthe Ultimate UnracerΓÇÖs Garment
ΓÇó Safety: #1 RuleΓÇöBe Seen; Helmets ArenΓÇÖt All TheyΓÇÖre Cracked Up to Be
ΓÇó Health and Fitness: Why Riding Is Lousy All-Around Exercise; Saddles DonΓÇÖt Cause Impotence; Drink When YouΓÇÖre ThirstyΓÇöNot Before

Also includes chapters on Accessories, Upkeep, and Technicalities as well as a final chapter titled ΓÇ£VelosophyΓÇ¥ that includes the essential, memorable thought: Your Bike Is a ToyΓÇöHave Fun with It.
