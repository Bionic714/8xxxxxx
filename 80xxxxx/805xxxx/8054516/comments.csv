I looked at your other uploads and really liked the response you gave to other people.
So, I thought you wouldn't post some invalid files.

I searched on Internet and yes 7-zip and winzip didn't work for me.
After searching, I found that the zip file does not include ZIP Standards.

So i searched for the solution and found uniextract, which worked for me.

So thanks and sorry for my previous comment."
