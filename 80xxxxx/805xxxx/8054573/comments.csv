No need to be rude? Maybe if you responded to the comments that I left on episode 3 asking for episode #2."
,justlookingnow,2013-01-29T20:56Z,Thank you uploader for this show! I look forward to many more as I am greatly appreciated that you are the only person that uploads this show.
,justlookingnow,2013-01-31T21:23Z,"Hi can you please upload more new weekly episodes of Diners Drive Ins and Dives.

 Please ignore the rude guy who was swearing as he is obviously very inconsiderate and ungrateful for the work you do.

I on the other hand appreciate this very much as I love this show but had to cancel the channel and you are the only one that uploads this show.

Thank you in advance."
