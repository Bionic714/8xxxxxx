,vatel88,2013-01-23T23:07Z,when will little children learn to read before jumping to conclusions. no where does it say :witch hunters so why would anyone think this is the major release 2 days before its opening night? can we say stupid?
,pwnt_soup,2013-01-24T00:37Z,"thanks for the up, that said its another Sci-Fi ch low budget movie that should be labeled as such"

,marut76,2013-01-24T08:16Z,"It's funni that all these Asylum cheap knockoff flics get a ton of mistaken internet traffic on P2P and the makers get nothing from it lol
Only income is from the stupid few who pick these dvds up in the supermarket bargain bin"

,.Hermit.,2013-01-25T10:40Z,"I get that this is not ""Witch Hunters"" but is this one REALLY that bad?"
,.Hermit.,2013-01-25T10:43Z,@vatel88 was you here for the Wolverine movie? it was on here b4 it was even finished. 
,ToshJoy,2013-01-25T22:10Z,It's very obvious that it is not the one in theaters. Just based off the actors list alone and the cover. Should do research before downloading something blindly.
,gitnitdone,2013-01-25T22:18Z,vitel....... u might not wanna thorw the stupid word round cause i also downloaded stand up guys allready and its not even released till feb 1 2013....had lots of movies be4 release date lol.... there screener dvds
,cmonk2112,2013-01-26T19:19Z,first of all the movie isn't out on dvd yet... obviously it isn't the new witchhunters movie... FUCKING IDIOTS
,seednope,2013-01-26T21:03Z,"HUUUURRR DUURRRR I'm gonna download this piece of shit because the title is similar to a newer movie that might be good!  I'll be back to rage on the comments if it's not, though!  HURR DURR GRRR"
,MCarle,2013-01-26T21:07Z,cmonk did you read any of the other comments?? there have been plenty of films on pb sometimes months before they are even released in theaters. do you really think the first time ANYONE sees the movie its in a theater?
,A134E882,2013-01-28T02:28Z,garbage

,jibbre,2013-01-31T17:28Z,i just watched the whole movie to realize it wasnt the new know FML... i feel robbed this movie is so fucking bad
,evrookie,2013-02-03T03:43Z,"terrible, shit movie, not new one, DONT DOWNLOAD"
,Delta_6,2013-02-03T06:21Z,"If you can get past the horrible acting, lack of any substantial plot, horrible music score, poor directing, and the worst visual effects this side of 70's this movie is almost not one of the worst movies ever made.

It is not the movie you think it is; do not watch this even if you are bored."
,touchablehusky,2013-02-04T02:03Z,"As soon as I saw that this was put out by Asylum, I knew that I was in for a bit of a stinkery-doo.  Remember, these are the folks that put out that rather miserable Hobbit rip off movie.  I'm always shocked when I see actual actors in these movies, and seeing Dee Wallace (think The Howling) in this one is still a surprise!  But bills need to be paid, I guess.  Nice quality on the upload (and thanks, by the way to scene4all)...this one's good for a late night  mst3k shoutfest over beers!"
,Noosh,2013-02-07T10:37Z,YR the fukin asshole knowing full well how U titled this movie nowing full well that people want the one thats out right now then U go and piss on uss by uploading this bullshit fukoff
,Team_Alice,2013-02-10T02:57Z,"hey Noosh your the asshole here. it says dvdrip, the movie you want is still in theaters."
,raffab,2013-02-13T08:08Z,"this is BS, its not the 2013 Hansel and Gretel, dont bother downloadin"
,Ketamiini,2013-04-05T18:47Z,"Are all people braindead today? READ INFO, ""genre: horror""  The movie name ""Hansel & Gretel""
and the move thats is in theaters is named ""HANSEL AND GRETEL WITCH HUNTERS"" and this is a 2013 movie but NOT the one you all are looking for, so grow up BLZZZZZ?!!"
