,RichX_HD,2013-01-23T10:57Z,can I install in sim3 blackbox version?? need some confirmation before I start to download.thanks in advance
,zoranjoza,2013-01-23T17:30Z,Is it possible to get this expansion working with The Sims 3 Gold Edition?
,dhod4ever,2013-01-23T19:25Z,"@RichX_HD, zoranjoza

blackbox version, Sims 3 Gold Edition, R.G.Catalyst RePack, and other repack games are not valid for normal patch or incompatible for newer expansion. ""also included portable versions and RIP version""

how to know if it's repack? no hassle installation a one click installation that install the game from a part 1 to last part.

If you want to enjoy and play a newer expansion of Sims 3, you better download the individual ISO installer.

try this torrent -  http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7841638/The_Sims_3_All_Expansions___Stuff_Packs

that's a working torrent and a duration of 5 hours installing. the choice is yours!"
,garrettj4,2013-01-23T21:38Z,Thanx!!!
,rareblackbird,2013-01-24T01:08Z,Thanks!!! 
,garrettj4,2013-01-24T02:33Z,is anyone else getting a no disc error 
,dhod4ever,2013-01-24T11:19Z,"@garrettj4

you paste the crack in the wrong folder. do not paste the crack in the 70s 80s 90s stuff folder. Paste the crack in the SIMS 3 BASE GAME.

solution? If you backup the files before overwriting the crack then paste the original files back. If didn't backup it, then you will need to install again the 70s 80s 90s stuff."
,xboxuser11,2013-01-24T14:32Z,"Thanks for this one!! really appreciate! anyone wanna know something, any one know why this torrent take 1.24gb, when the FLT version take 3.09gb?? it's a huge difference....thanks!"

,russianhornybear,2013-01-26T22:22Z,"@xboxuser11

this version just a PC stuff ,without MAC folders and so on. No more differences.But if this install complicated for you ,better dl DVD version"
,BDSMers,2013-01-27T12:08Z,"@piratebunnie try the skip when you drop that windows 8 peice of crap in it. Windows 8 is the biggest ballsup peice of software since windows Millenium
Then again, you could format the hard drive and install W7, or even better if you can find the drivers XP :)"
,Army_Force,2013-01-27T16:08Z,"this is full game? cuz i download it and i got this error

""This Product Requires an Installed Copy of Sims 3."""

,Pissard93,2013-01-27T16:43Z,Mac versions??

,ldavner,2013-01-27T22:07Z,i try to click on the installer and it won't open..anyone else have this issue? i'm thinking of just re downloading the file

,AhoyCaptinNikki,2013-01-29T05:57Z,"So I purchased the disk back in either 08 or 09 (when it first came out) and wanted to try out an expansion pack, so I downloaded this. When I went to install the Stuff Pack, it said that I needed to update The sims 3 so I said yes and waited for an hour for an update that never even started so I figured that it could be that my version of the game was out dated. I ended up downloading another version of the game on here and went to install the Stuff Pack again and it said the same thing. Has anyone else run into this problem and knows how to get past/ fix it?"
,AhoyCaptinNikki,2013-01-29T09:36Z,"Never mind, I figured out what was wrong."
,TONPumper,2013-01-29T12:59Z,Why is this version 1.24 GB and the other version here is 3 GB?
,Green.Banana,2013-01-31T04:25Z,"Will this circumvent the BS warning I got today that Sims 3 apparently detected it was an unofficial version, even though it's not allowed to update itself without my consent?  "
,Kaleidoscoped,2013-01-31T04:35Z,I too am having a problem with the no disk error but I don't understand why. I didn't paste the crack in the 70s 80s 90s folder. This isn't my first sims 3 torrent so I knew to put it in with the sims 3 base game folder however it's not working. I've been looking for a mini image to just mount and skip the whole crack deal but I can't find one anywhere. Any ideas or should I just reinstall?
,alqueen,2013-02-01T17:19Z,"I can't seem to update the game during install. :-/ I can't even get to the serial input part. It says Can't update Sims 3. Unable to run setup.

Any ideas, people? Thanks in advance."
,juggalettelove19,2013-02-03T02:35Z,ok so i have downloaded sims 3 seasons and 60 70 8s packs but now when i try to use the cc magic when it gets to the page where you can choose a family or make a new town. a list comes up with all my mods on it and then when you close the list it it tells me it cant find a disk. how can i fix that? because it was working when i was just playing supernautral earlier today...
,Drapes12,2013-02-07T11:40Z,"When I open the sims3 launcher it does not recognize that ive installed this update.. I have though because when I go into re install the 70 80 90s stuff installer it ask for an uninstall. 
tips? "
,thetank77,2013-02-08T18:50Z,THIS IS NOT AN ISO FILE. IT IS A RAR FILE. YOU CAN INSTALL THE GAME BUT YOU CANT PLAY IT BECAUSE YOU NEED THE DISK TO PLAY. WITH NO ISO TO MOUNT YOU CANT PLAY.
,mikehunt3,2013-02-10T01:31Z,"Registration codes dont work, tried all 3"
,Hetallian,2013-02-11T22:20Z,"Worked perfectly, but now it's asking for the disk.. help???"
,Green.Banana,2013-02-13T00:02Z,"Does this not include the Disco music tracks?  I have the station, but nothing plays.  A few other tracks don't play, even in Options, either.  "
,Smo_ladyargg06,2013-02-13T05:17Z,"I was wondering is it possible just to download the crack, I mistakenly deleted at some point( i had to redownload the game) and i am not able to play the game because of it. I do not want to have to download the whole file over again .. but if i have to I shall wait..lol"
,ktb0513,2013-02-26T20:41Z,"I was unable to get this one to work, it kept asking me a cd. I did but the crack file in the correct folder but the only problem that i see is that i have my original sims 3 downloaded from origin so its not in the electronic arts folder. The other games i have downloaded from you guys worked perfectly (kp sweet treats, and master suite stuff) i will try to reinstall once i get my copy of university in that will probably solve the no cd issue i seem to be having....thank you very much you have saved me some money an i am very happy :)"
,kattallia,2013-02-28T12:56Z,I plan on dling this when i go to pick up my sims uni xD that way i can write uni over it and wont need to worry about if it wants a disc
,MissAllyRae,2013-03-14T08:44Z,Where do you find the codes to install it??
,traitergurl,2013-03-25T01:18Z,seed plz its going very slow
,Artticus,2013-04-10T18:40Z,Works like a charm. remember the the codes are in the readme that was in the zip. also you put the crack in the sim 3 bin folder not the 70-90 stuffs folder. hope that helps all you guys having problems
