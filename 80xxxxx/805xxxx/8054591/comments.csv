and

""DOOMSDAY PREPPERS BUNKERS""

[T],MrUnpopular,2013-01-30T04:44Z,"@tonkobonko Doomsday Preppers Bugged Out is just the original 1st season of Doomsday Preppers but with tweets and fun facts added to the episode. I was going to cap it but decided it was pointless.

Doomsday Bunkers is online already and has been since it first aired."
[T],k3nd00d,2013-01-30T08:37Z,"Correct, thanks MrUnpopular.

And... No new episode of Doomsday Preppers this week folks."
