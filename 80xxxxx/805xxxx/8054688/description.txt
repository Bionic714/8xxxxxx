Slacker Cats is an animated ABC Family series that premiered on August 13, 2007. It was the first animated show on ABC Family since the Fox Family era.[1] It was created using Adobe Flash.

The show was initially marketed as a children's show, but in later advertising and in press kits issued to the media, it was clearly indicated that the show included a more adult tone and themes.[2] The show's 10PM broadcast time further illustrated that its target was an adult audience. The program was rated TV-14.

Slacker Cats was animated by Film Roman, the same company that animates The Simpsons and King of the Hill. It features the voice talents of comedians Harland Williams and Sinbad in the lead roles. It was created by Andy Riley and Kevin Cecil, who also served as executive producers along with animation director Seth Kearsley, who designed the characters.

Slacker Cats was canceled on September 17, 2007 after 6 episodes. A second season premiered on the ABC Family website on January 19, 2009, and, according to its creators, will be released on iTunes and Xbox Live Marketplace.[3] The second season was numbered as a continuation of the first season, episodes 7 through 12.
