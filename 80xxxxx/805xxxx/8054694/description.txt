ActiveFax

ActFax has been designed for network-wide transmission and receipt of fax messages, as well as sending and forwarding fax messages by email. The software runs on any Windows version from Windows 95 or higher and also supports terminal servers. Due to the client/server architecture of ActFax, all data is stored centralized on the fax server. With the integrated fax client and the ActFax printer driver, faxing from any standard application is as easy as printing. For the integration of the fax service into own applications, ActFax offers various standardized interfaces. Due to the intuitive user interface, the installation and configuration of ActFax is done in just a few minutes. Since ActFax automatically detects and configures the available hardware, the fax server is ready for operation right after the installation. ActFax is also available for free download through the download area for in-depth testing.
