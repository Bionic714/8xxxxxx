 Abby couldn't be more thrilled to have a new star on team, but Melissa is starting to feel like Sophia is pushing Maddie out of the spotlight and into the corner. When Abby assigns Maddie and Kendall a duet, Melissa pretends to be happy about it but confides in Abby the awful truth. Jill, Christi, Kelly and Holly band together and try to get Melissa to admit her deceit. Meanwhile, Abby once again bans Brooke from the competition but gives Paige a solo so she can try to justify her spot on the team.
