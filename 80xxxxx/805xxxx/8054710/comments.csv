One small thing though ""Bit rate : 320 Kbps
Channel(s) : 2 channels""
MP3 stereo isn't actually 2 channels as some of the information is shared between left and right. The ONLY true 2 channels, and therefore only true stereo is to encode it in DUAL CHANNEL, then the left and right are truly separate."
