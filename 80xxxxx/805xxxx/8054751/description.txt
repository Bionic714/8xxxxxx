Prager 20130122  3 Ultimate Issues Hour: Society Raises Your Kids

Prager H3: Society raises children as much as parents do. You may not like the idea, but itΓÇÖs hard to deny.



Prager 20130122  2 Liberal Vision

Prager H2: Suddenly, the NY Times declares the President to be ''a liberal'' with a ''sweeping liberal vision.''
 They never called him liberal during his first term or during the election.
 But now they shout from the rooftops. Why? 
 Dennis talks to Dinesh DΓÇÖSouza, best-selling author of ''ObamaΓÇÖs America'' and director of the popular
 documentary ''2016.'' 
 If the Jews had guns in Nazi Germany, their fate would have been very different.
 But the Left finds this idea ''laughable.''



Prager 20130122  1 Anew

Prager H1: For the President everything exciting is ''anew.'' Old values are boring...
  After how many rules does the free market lose its freedom?
