MESSAGE FROM OzQuant:

All the thanks to people who helped me seed the show for the past 6 months.

The show finishes tomorrow (23rd) with a pre-recorded episode (not live).

I'm hoping that Eclipse will come out of retirement and share the HD version of the show.

I will still be recording and seeding AOTS Finale and the X-Play Finale tomorrow.

Come over to kat ph and say and bye !
