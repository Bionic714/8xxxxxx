[T],FatFreddy638,2013-01-29T10:48Z,"sorry peeps,iTunes are playing silly buggers again this week and not releasing Beverly Hills on schedule like they did for the first 9 episodes (but they will release that awful Vanderpump Rules). You know the drill though, when I get my hands on it I will upload it :-)"
,teddybare,2013-01-29T12:06Z,"This is bullshit rockstar! You're a lazy ass! 
Sorry for my ranting, there wasn't enough drama on E11, so I gotta create it here :p 
Watch it on sidereel."
[T],FatFreddy638,2013-01-29T12:40Z,"@teddybare - you crack me up! Come over to KAT,we've got a H'Wives Social Group where you can create as much drama as you want. 
Personally I think this withholding the episode is a conspiracy to make us watch that vile Vanderpump show."
,jchen9999,2013-01-29T14:10Z,please upload episode 11
[T],FatFreddy638,2013-01-29T14:38Z,"ah jchen9999, I was worried you weren't going to show up and leave one of your moronic messages. I suspect you may be a bot but I don't think even they are that stupid."
,teddybare,2013-01-29T16:13Z,Whats KAT?
,teddybare,2013-01-29T16:15Z,"Okay, I googled and found it. Thanks Rockstar."
,LizTaylor,2013-01-29T21:25Z,@Rkstr you know I love you but please stop saying 'peeps' and 'playing silly buggers'!!! It's too irritating for words Hun :0(. 
[T],FatFreddy638,2013-01-29T23:41Z,"@LizTaylor - tell me the other times I have used those expressions that ""irritate"" you so much."
,LizTaylor,2013-01-30T20:25Z,"@rkstr Actually now that you mention it, never. I was thinking of a different rockstar. :-D "
