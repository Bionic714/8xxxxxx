Ep 10: Home Is Where the Art Is
 The ladies attend an art opening (with Paris Hilton), and Brandi plans a trip to Vegas.
 PREMIERE: Monday January 21, 9 pm

Tension is still high at the Moroccan restaurant, but everyone moves on. Adrienne and Paul visit Kyle and Mauricio to discuss Brandi's actions; Yolanda crosses paths with her ex-husband Mohamed as she decorates a mansion for him, and Kim has a psychic point out the ghosts inhabiting her house. At an art gallery opening (where Kim and Kyle's niece Paris Hilton is a guest), Brandi invites the ladies to Las Vegas, and despite their rocky past, Kyle decides to go.

Yes "finally!"
