Just to let you know there is a glitch on track 48. Erline Harris / Rock and Roll Blues....it should be 2:39 min.....seems it is missing the first 1:25. Wondering if it is fixable? Could be a bad cd original.  BIG TNX for your generosity!!   "
,kenncomm,2013-01-26T05:58Z,"Also found 25 - Virginia O'Brien - Lullaby (Rock A Bye Baby)...too short

30 - Gertrude Niessen - Rockin' The Town....too
short....content missing.
Prob bad cd mastering. "
,pumafred,2013-01-28T20:29Z,Thanks for this (will check the flaws reported by others). Any chance you would have The Backbeat Of Rock And Roll collection?
