Release Info:

The Cave's story is based on a magical talking cave with a labyrinthine set
of tunnels within it. Seven characters, drawn from across time and space,
have come to the Cave, believing they can "learn something about themselves
and who they might become", as stated by Gilbert, while harboring a dark
secret. In one example, a knight character, seeking a treasured amulet,
encounters a princess who possesses the amulet in distress from a dragon;
instead of coming to the princess' rescue, he lures the dragon into eating
her and recovering the amulet for himself when the dragon coughs it up.

Notes:

DUPLEX supports valid scene releases only, and no region dupes.
DUPLEX will not patch updates for you because we think the base retail
version is enough to test out a game.
If you want updates and support - BUY IT and support the developers!

Enjoy This Fine DUPLEX Release
