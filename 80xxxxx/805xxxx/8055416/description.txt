Only Boys Aloud, the 141 strong choir from the Welsh Valleys are best known for achieving huge success on ITV1’s hit show Britain’s Got Talent, coming third in the final in 2012. Their debut album sees the choir marry traditional Welsh songs with an impressive selection of choral versions of more contemporary tracks, including stirring takes on Coldplay’s classic track "Paradise" and Take That’s "Never Forget".
