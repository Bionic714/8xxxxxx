William Mortensen's THE COMMAND TO LOOK


I searched in vain for a copy of this excellent book online.  Failing to find one, I at last bought one of the few horrendously expensive copies available.  To avoid others having to share my fate, I have photographed its pages and created a .cbz to share with those who would like to learn from this wonderful little book.

William Mortensen is a sadly underrated and extremely dead photographer.  He ain't making any money from the odd copy of this indispensable tome that occasionally appears on the open market.  Greedy bastards are, by refusing to share this valuable resource without first shaking down the interested reader for all they've got.

I had to pay through the nose to get my hands on this.  I want to be the last person who does.  I won't see my few hundred dollars back.  But by sharing this, I hope to save people who actually want to use these techniques the same expense.
