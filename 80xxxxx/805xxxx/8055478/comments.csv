To play in multi-player and use the editor you'll have to login using an account, so buy the game if you want those features."
,Pedeadstrian,2013-01-23T20:11Z,"Thanks, I've been waiting to try this out."
,MinerWars,2013-01-23T20:43Z,"Dear Pirates, I knew this will happen once we introduce offline mode... enjoy it and if you like the game, buy it. Thanks

,sgt_noobums,2013-01-23T21:51Z,"Hell yeah!

You know a dev has confidence in their game when they tell the pirates to enjoy it.  

Thanks and most definitely will purchase when i have the cash if i like it!"

Certainly a lot of people won't, but if i enjoy it - i will buy it. Just like i've bought five other titles this year already after playing a ""demo"" from here. :) 

We're not all asswipes. Not thoroughly anyway."
,sgt_noobums,2013-01-26T05:38Z,"Well said jkcarber, well said indeed."
,uNreaLSvK,2013-03-16T23:28Z,"Well now I just feel bad for myself. I haven't bought a game for like 2-3 years, and I only bought like 4 games I really, REALLY liked. I first wanna see that it will be worth the time I spend playing it for the next 2-4 years. I only bought SOF and CS, and the extensions to it, but I used to play them for a damn long time."

You should update your version of Miner Wars 2081 - we just released a major update: 

- rendering engine has been rewritten from XNA to DirectX (better stability and performance, no more alt-tab crashes)
- tons of fixes and optimizations
- full source code of game and engine
