All bugs fixed and textures added! Run the game with HDTP.exe.

Deus Ex is a cyberpunk-themed action-role playing video game � combining first-person shooter, stealth and role-playing elements � developed by Ion Storm and published by Eidos Interactive in 2000. First published for personal computers running Windows, Deus Ex was later ported to Macintosh systems, as well as the PlayStation 2 game console. Set in a dystopian world during the year 2052, the central plot follows rookie United Nations Anti-Terrorist Coalition agent JC Denton, as he sets out to combat terrorist forces, which have become increasingly prevalent in a world slipping ever further into chaos. As the plot unfolds, Denton becomes entangled in a deep and ancient conspiracy, encountering organizations such as Majestic 12, the Illuminati, and the Hong Kong Triads throughout his journey.

The game received universal critical and industry acclaim, including being named ""Best PC Game of All Time"" in PC Gamer's Top 100 PC Games and in a poll carried out by UK gaming magazine PC Zone.[3] It was a frequent candidate for and winner of Game of the Year awards, drawing praise for its pioneering designs in player choice and multiple narrative paths. It has sold more than 1 million copies, as of April 23, 2009. The game has spawned both a sequel, Deus Ex: Invisible War (released in December 2003, for both Microsoft Windows and the Xbox video game console), and a prequel, Deus Ex: Human Revolution (released in August 2011).

Tnx for upload "
,Backstabing,2013-01-23T23:05Z,"Thanks, great upload!
@sanu911: Just.. get the fuck out seriously."
,Klamrian,2013-01-23T23:55Z,"sanu911, all people probably don't know the original Deus Ex, one of the most highly acclaimed, intelligent and groundbreaking computer games ever made.

So just to be fair: If you don't know anything - at all - this may not be what you (that's how you spell it - y-o-o) are looking for. And if you call it shit, that IS what you are made entirely out of.

And on the other hand: If you know shit, then you have hit gold with this upload. So thanks!"
,Niasyn,2013-01-24T16:48Z,Thanks for this great upload!
,PseudoPositive,2013-01-27T03:01Z,"Works perfectly, cheers uploader."
,groundbeef,2013-02-01T22:00Z,This was Trombones initial release before he compiled it complete with install packaged combined with 2027. This is a UG torrent that has been irresponsibly allowed in to the public unfinished. The proper release is now available. Hopefully next time people will respect the sources.
