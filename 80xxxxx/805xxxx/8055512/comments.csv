,dunit80,2013-01-25T09:55Z,Game works perfectly. But a warning to everyone. This game is fucking TERRIBLE. One of the worst games Ive ever played on 360. The graphics look like something off the original XBOX. Theres a reason this game is only $20 brand new in the store as a new release. Its really really bad.
