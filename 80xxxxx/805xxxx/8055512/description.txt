Heavy Fire: Shattered Spear sends soldiers after a captured spy who holds the plans to a secret Iranian nuclear weapons facility. The sequel to Heavy Fire: Afghanistan is both playable alone and with up to three others via couch co-op, the latter a solid choice if you're the type who prefers the military authenticity that only a claustrophobic foxhole-slash-crowded-couch can provide.

This torrent is probably from this release: Heavy_Fire_Shattered_Spear_JPN_RF_XBOX360-Caravan but I'm not sure.
