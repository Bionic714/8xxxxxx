Notes: 
This series focuses on the Rogues exclusively after the Battle of Endor (with the exception of #1/2), and is tightly integrated with the Stackpole novel series of the same name. Indeed, through a clever use of a very focused part of the timeline--the whole run seems to happen in or about the year 5 ABY--all 35 issues serve as a kind of "prequel" to the novels.
Almost the entire run was collected by individual story. Oddly, though, the first story, "The Rebel Opposition", was never traded on its own, and only made its first appearance in collected form in May 2006. The trade series, Star Wars Omnibus, collected Rogue Squadron again--this time with about three storylines per book--for a whole new generation of fans.

The title has the distinction of being Dark Horse's first attempt at an ongoing Star Wars comic--even though it still kinda feels like a "series of miniseries", as they had done previously with their Star Wars license. Indeed, if you go by strict cover numbering, the first 20 issues are actually five separate 4-issue miniseries. Although they aren't numbered on the cover as an ongoing series, they do have such a marking in the indicia. It isn't until issue #21 that the indicia numbering is reflected on the cover of the issues. The database, as a result, uses the indicia numbering for consistency.
