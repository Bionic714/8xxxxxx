At long last we have the January release of... (*Drum Roll*) OTHERWORLD

For those of you who do not know what other world is, well its similar to the old game slave maker only this one is more detailed and has a strong tie in with several well know anime series. It is very open concept has a fairly well developed world and lends itself very easily to being modded.
