Music is a multi-faceted universe and Ray Charles made a major contribution to changing its boundaries, bringing different kinds of material into play in order to express their full emotional impact. It takes a rare kind of energy and sensitivity to succeed in combining elements of jazz, blues and country music, trustingly and with no false pretenses, simply using your sense of soul. Tainted at first by tragedy and drama, the path Ray Charles took through life demonstrated his unwavering energy and determination. In spite of his success, he never forgot where he came from nor who he was. This shy and discreet man enthusiastically let himself go on stage, revealing a rare ability to really get something across to the audience, which made him one of the most impressive showmen of his time.

This boxed set presents the first chapter in the long story of Ray Charles' career as an artist, from the 1948 Down Beat 78s through to the 1959 album The Genius of Ray Charles, his last for Atlantic before signing to ABC. The 13x13cm box contains the seven CDs in individual slipcases plus a 60 page booklet (Eng/Fr) with authoritative notes. (amazon.com)
