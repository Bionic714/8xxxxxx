,Tigrak,2013-01-26T10:43Z,I believe this torrent is broken. I've had it running for 2 days straight and gotten exactly zero downloaded. Can you please check it and possibly reupload? Thanks for the share...?
,triggerjerk,2013-02-01T13:15Z,"One week later, 0.00% downloaded, still one seed and 125 leechers. Thanks for nothing. "
