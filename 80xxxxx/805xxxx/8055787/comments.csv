,MoviesR101,2013-01-23T20:49Z,I know I I see WEBRip in different torrents? Is this a Screener or TS? How much longer for the Bluray 1080 or DVDR? 
,Boh2,2013-01-24T00:02Z,I think this was released in other countries before the US.  So they have access to online versions.  Or maybe an employee of one of the online stores ripped it. I know they get them before the release date but I'm not sure how far in advance.

,omegaviper,2013-01-30T09:09Z,@wtf are you going on about?
