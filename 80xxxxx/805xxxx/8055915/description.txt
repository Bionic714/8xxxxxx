KMSNano is an Offline KMS Activator that emulates a KMS server in the memory of
your computer and sends activation data back and forth attempting to activate
volume versions of Windows and Office. I have personally activated KMSNano without
having my lan drivers even installed on a fresh install of Windows 7.

This is v15.1.  There are other earlier versions that may or may not work currently.
You should always check for the latest version before using.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Activates:
Windows Vista Business/Enterprise Default/N/VL
Windows 7 Pro/Enterprise Default/N/VL
Windows 8 Pro/Enterprise Default/N/VL
Windows Server Std/Data 2008/2008R2/2012
Office/OfficeVL 2010/2013.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Retail-Only Versions of windows that will *NOT* activate are:
Vista Starter/Homebasic/Homepremium/Ultimate - Default/N/E
7 Starter/Homebasic/Homepremium/Ultimate - Default/N/E
8 core/coreN/ProWMC
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Requirements: . NET 4.0 or Windows 8

Instructions:

1. Prescan file and then shut down Security Programs and any other running programs.
(Torrent program caused problem for me)
2. Extract the zip file. (Optional - I ran from within zip)
3. Run KMSnano.exe
4. Wait about 60-80secs while the files run in the background.
(It doesn't let you know when it's done, you can check task manager or just wait)
5. Run the Check_Activation_all.cmd to verify your activation status.
6. Go about your business. You can get the Win8 watermark to go away by
auto-hiding the taskbar or similar system stuff. (WindowsKey+D works also)

To fix any botched activations from other "hacktivators" or activation problems
in general, you can run admin command prompt command "SFC /SCANNOW"
I very much recommend running that command on older systems with stale system files
that may have a lot of inconsistencies.

Note that Pre-Release versions of Office or Windows will NEVER activate.
Get an actual release if you want to activate. (RTM or Retail)

Why use this program over any other activation method?
-It does not modify any of your system files.
-Because it's not a crack or a hack.
-Because it's the only way to get legit activation without using legit servers.
-Did I mention it activates ALL KMS activation software?

Change Log from v15:
- Detect Office 2013 Grace Edition.
- Fixed bug when Firewall service is off.
- Add TriggerKMS v8.

(Use my custom "Run Trigger.cmd" for win8 trigger setting. It will run when 30
days left on kms activation or less. You can edit to run sooner or later. Once you
run the "Run Trigger.cmd", don't move or delete either the kmsnano.exe or
triggerkms.exe)

To remove the trigger task, go into task scheduler and look for triggerkms on the
list of tasks. Double click it to open the settings, then click the delete button.
(May be slightly different on non-win8 systems)

(Big Salute to heldigard and all the peeps who contributed to this project)
