     dir to your DocumentsRockstar GamesSocial Club dir.
     (%USERPROFILE%DocumentsRockstar GamesSocial Club).
  4. Copy over the cracked content, ie. the rest of the files, from the Crack
     dir to your installation dir.
  5. Play the game offline. Make sure that all the games exe files are blocked
     from going online by using your system or third party firewall to prevent
     outgoing connections on every game exe file. Do this before starting the

     is at your own risk.

,MaxKohler,2013-02-04T08:54Z,"Works good.

I spent half an hour trying to get past the social club login screen because of the previous instructions...

For anyone having trouble with that, you have to disable your internet connection before starting the game for the first time so that it gives you the option to enter offline mode.

Blocking the exes with windows firewall isn't sufficient."
,MaxKohler,2013-02-04T17:40Z,"EDIT: re using windows firewall - it does work but you have to block them through the advanced settings rather than ""allow a program or feature through windows firewall"".

It won't let me post the link so just google ""block program from accessing internet with windows firewall""."
,adrenilator,2013-02-12T15:07Z,"I start the game and all the beginning stuff goes thru, but when the game actually starts, I see a room with a door and the game crashes...

Have a 2 gb vid card, a 2.7gb 6 core processor, 8gb of ram and am running on Windows 8...

Anybody have any solution?"
,kmadvani,2013-02-12T21:28Z,"I have the exact same problem as adrenilator.
Anyone know a fix?"

,Brutus88,2013-02-25T19:24Z,"I had the same problem too.

Just make sure that you install ALL the updates starting from 22 and finishing with 113. Most of the newer updates require the previous one. If you don't want to check just install all of them.

Also disable anti-virus for the installation of the updates. Then copy the crack content and also disable your Internet when starting and playing the game. Hope you fix it and enjoy this great game."
,Chuck684,2013-03-02T17:24Z,Why can't they upload a full version of the game with all these patches already installed. This thing has so many patches now it's not even worth fucking with. Crazy.
,VBCoder,2013-04-10T11:47Z,"Since I feel obliged to all who those helped to seed this torrent, here is my tip:
- If you have fresh install of the original reloaded version, allow it to update until it reaches v1.0.0.113 (Don't worry, it will work).
- Delete ALL FILES from Social Club folder found in your documents.
- Make sure you blocked Play Max Payne 3.exe and Max Payne 3.exe in your firewall.
- Follow the instructions in this torrent.
- You may encounter problem passing social club after this, I resolved it by removing all files in Social club folder and copied ""Profile"" from v1.0.0.81 (Search the piratebay and use ""Profile"" folder from it) [Make sure you delete all previous files from Social club folder in your documents]
- The ""Profile"" came with this torrent didn't work for me so I suggest you do as I mentioned in the first step.
- Cheers"
