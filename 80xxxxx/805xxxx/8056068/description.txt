Tub Hatfield (Hershel Savage) and Marge McCoy (Misty Reagan) are brother and sister, but when Marge divorces her husband, she and her brood of two sons, Brad (Scott Irish) and Jack (Tony Martino) and a daughter Dana (Tara Wine) move in with Tub, his son Ronnie (James Miles), and his two daughters, Sue (Heather Wayne) and Anna (Summer Rose). On their very first night together, Brad makes out with his cousin, Sue, while Jack and Anna go for a moonlight ride in Jack's car with the inevitable result. Later, Sue and Anne start to compare experiences, but get so horny that they end up naked and in each other's arms. Dana happens to walk in on this lesbian scene, realizes what is happening, and quickly makes her exit.
