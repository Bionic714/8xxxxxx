 This website gives you some basic information and safe links to download the setup file. This website does not host the setup file and is not affiliated with the authors of DVD43 Plug-in.

Note: The standalone DVD43 (EXE version) is now obsolete due to incompatibility with Windows 8 and all 64 bit versions of Windows.

DVD43 PLUG-IN (DVD43.DLL) is a free decrypter plug-in that provides an interface that DVD copy programs can use to decrypt.

SUPPORTED OPERATING SYSTEMS: Windows 8, Windows 7, Vista, Windows XP, and Windows 2000.  (32 and 64 bits)
