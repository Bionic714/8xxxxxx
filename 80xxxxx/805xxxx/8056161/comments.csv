I hope you someday encode The Dark Knight (2008) and Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) the same way. Thank you.. especially for the 5.1 audio"
[V],dhjudasx,2013-01-23T21:02Z,"eroticburps

Fact of the matter is that i think by now.. the Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises have finished encoding..

TDK is the imax version (portions of the film that change from 1920x800 ~> 1920x1080 and back again)

Anywho.. they are coming...

As for terminator 2... i'm trying to get my hands on the ultimate Directors Extended Cut edition.. with all the little scenes that really make it great.. think it's like 30 minutes longer with it all... until then i won't be touching it."

,clu.kai,2013-01-24T12:48Z,"@Judas, do you have any other torrent websites, blogs where we can DL, seed, leech your torrent uploads? because most of the time piratebay is not working. I'm just worried because we might not be able to get your precious torrents uploads someday IF and only IF they successfully shutdown this website. You get my point? :)

THANK YOU for reading and uderstanding :D
again, #1 supporter here!"

@dhjudasx:

hi, this movie ""The Incredible Hulk (2008)"" 1080p is not playing on big tv screen. What's the problem I don't know?

What is your video bitrates for all your movies? "
