Hi. I'd like to ask you again) and I hope it will not bother you a lot. In my collection of Good luck Charlie 3rd season episodes from 1 to 6 and 13 are in HDTV. It would be great to have them in WEB-DL too. And if you have them too could you please make them?) or maybe give me the links where I can get them.
I really love this serial!
P.S. 8th episode is good but it has watermark at the corner, so if you make it too that would be just great. And anyhow thanks)"
