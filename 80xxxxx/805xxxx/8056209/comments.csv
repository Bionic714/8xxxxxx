,dknomed,2013-01-23T21:39Z,"Thanks for the Upload! Also Can we get a Request in? Can you upload a Game called Strike Suit Zero i think it came out today, i love these space games"
,tamriilin,2013-01-23T22:34Z,I agree with dknomed. Strike Suit Zero would be dope.
,solidcz,2013-01-24T01:38Z,"torrent works nicely, but game is very anoying. Ships move like packmules and when turning a bilion ton cruiser make a ebrake turn like it is made from paper. For me its another cheap bullshit game. Makes me sad i love space games and space sims. See ya! Arrr"
,erithrius1,2013-01-25T21:38Z,"I'm having problems - how do I save? I played for like 20 minutes, then went back to main menu and tried to ""continue"" my game, but it started me over.

Also, the audio seems TERRIBLE! It basically only works in the comic scenes. 

How can I fix these two things? Thanks guys!"
,erithrius1,2013-01-25T23:35Z,"Never mind, apparently restarting the game fixed both issues."
,boomertv,2013-02-08T09:54Z,Awfull game played it but didn't like it
