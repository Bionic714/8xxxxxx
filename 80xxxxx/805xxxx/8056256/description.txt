Sorry about the image, for some reason TPB wouldn't accept a 480x360 picture because it was too "big". Anyways, this is my first torrent, it is the Slow Mo Guy's videos packaged nicely and formatted in mp4s. A playlist file is included that will play all of the videos in sequence and is generally accepted by any modern media mplayer. Please seed, and if this catches on I can index more internet videos. If I get responses I can also package podcasts, i.e. the RT Podcast in one current up to date torrent.
