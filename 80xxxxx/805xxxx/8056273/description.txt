These are my favourite books that I have obtained for the Kindle/eBook reader.

With the exception of Fifty Shades, they're all top quality reads. 

If you enjoy these, please support the authors and buy their books, if not these ones then others.

Included are :
 
A short history of nearly everything - Bill Bryson - A brilliant science primer, if a little dated now.

All hell let loose - Max Hastings - The second world war through letters from those that were there

Elric - Michael Moorcock - The original and best sword n sorcery.

First Contact - Chris Tucker - Very funny short story

The Hydrogen Sonata - Iain M Banks - Another brilliant Culture novel from the best.

Skagboys - Irvine Welsh - How Renton and the boys got hooked

Snuff - Terry Pratchett - Another Genius book from Pratchett

The Blade Itself - Joe Abercrombie - More magic.

There are quite a few more, enjoy!
