Planet Blue (Israel, 1995, 86 minutes, Hebrew)
has started its way as an esoteric weekly midnight screening but evolved into a cult event and has been shown regularly for more than 7 years strait!
The film drew some of the audience to watch it, up to Twenty Three times ! - for the most extreme groupie (to my knowledge ).
