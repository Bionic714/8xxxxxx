It's no secret today's media landscape is evolving at a fast and furious pace ΓÇö and students are experiencing these developments firsthand. While students are familiar with and may be using the latest products and newest formats, they may not understand how the media has evolved to this point or what all these changes mean. This is where Media and Culture steps in. The eighth edition pulls back the curtain and shows students how the media really works, giving students the deeper insight and context they need to become informed media critics.
