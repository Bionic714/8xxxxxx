The lesser size ones have either got an audio problem or video isn't very great. Please ICEBANE! It would mean a lot to all the kingdom release fans."
,jcallows,2013-01-30T00:07Z,thanks for the upload!  i noticed the file size of this movie is larger than others of comparable running time.  is there a reason for this?
,ABS_7,2013-01-31T16:08Z,"@jcallows: That's because the audio and video are not compressed to lower standards like 2 channel audio or somethinbg, which is done by some uploaders to lower the file size below 3 gigs. This is the perfect 6 channel sound and a super video. 1080p generally is this size so as to fit 1 movie in one whole dvd without loss of vid/audio from the source whatsoever."
