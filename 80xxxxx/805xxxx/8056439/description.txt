The Rape of Europa 
As seen on National Geographic Channel with the name Nazi Art Theft. World War II was not just the most destructive conflict in humanity; it was also the greatest theft in history: lives, families, communities, property, culture and heritage were all stolen. The Emmy Award-nominated documentary film, The Rape of Europa, narrated by Academy Award-nominee Joan Allen, is the epic story of the systematic theft, deliberate destruction and miraculous survival of many of Europe s art treasures during the Third Reich and the Second World War. In a journey through seven countries, The Rape of Europa takes the audience into the violent whirlwind of fanaticism, greed, and warfare that threatened to wipe out the artistic heritage of Europe. For twelve long years, the Nazis looted and destroyed art on a scale unprecedented in history. But young art professionals as well as ordinary heroes, from truck drivers to department store clerks, fought back with an extraordinary effort to safeguard, rescue and return the millions of lost, hidden and stolen treasures. The Rape of Europa addresses the questions of our time about the role of art in defining culture, and our shared responsibility to protect it. The film is an emotional witness to the destruction wrought on culture and art by fanaticism, greed, and warfare. But it is also a hopeful film that demonstrates how it is possible for humanity to protect the integrity of cultural property in armed conflicts.
