And here is a great childrens book, Lou!.
I am pretty far from being the target audience, and I still loved it :)
The first 3 books are scans, the last 2 are scanlations.

Lou is a girl who lives with her mom in an apartment in Paris. She has a best friend Mina and a crush on Tristan a boy who lives in the same building. Lou is smart and levelheaded while her mom is still in teenager phase. She plays video games while writing a novel. Lou has won prizes in France for best youth comic and this is the first English version. Check it out.
