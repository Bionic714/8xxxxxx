,anarchist9027,2013-01-24T00:32Z,I'm pretty positive this is probably a KMS activator or a hacktivator because there is no known permanent Windows 8 activation besides KMS or serial number.
,TheEmpathicEar,2013-01-24T00:54Z,"How long does this ""activation"" last? Months?"
,karty,2013-01-24T06:29Z,"As of now, there are no Windows 8 permanent activators are available.

Use heldigard's KMSnano v15.1 to have your copy of Windows activated 180 days by using offline KMS activator; there is also a Trigger provided to check activation status and activate it again when your expiration nearing.

Note: Heldigard's KMSnano activation survives Windows Update. Tested on Windows 8 Pro VL x64.

You can get it from here:

,lammiboy,2013-01-30T01:27Z,"Starts a program calls QEMU machine emulator, Not sure what it does, makes me a bit skeptical, but I'll repost if it works."
,lammiboy,2013-01-30T01:49Z,Does nothing.
,lammiboy,2013-01-30T01:56Z,"@Myself. Very sorry, the first time I ran the program it didn't work, restarted and ran again, Works great. Thank you."
,Hydranix,2013-02-03T15:03Z,"@lammiboy

QEMU is a an emulator capable of emulating many different processor architectures on x86. It can also emulate x86 on x86, which makes it a visualization tool too.

It is probably the lightest (least resources consumed whiel in use) virtual machine/emulator out there.

It synergizes with Linux's KVM too, which can be a pretty powerful combo. Unfortunately only a real operating system can offer such powerful programs. So windows users are mostly SOL&JWF.


It's my best guess that QEMU is launched during the cracking process to emulate a KMS server, which in turn activates windows.


The more you know..."
,sharpless512,2013-02-03T18:08Z,"How long does this waiting is? I runned it, allowed firewall and i'm waiting now. I see it that QEMU is using 31% cpu and 1,2GB ram"
,Neogranadino,2013-02-03T19:49Z,"Ok so... it didn't work for me, sadly :/

I allowed it to access my network through the firewall,  ran it as administrator and waited like... 25 or 30 minutes. It did nothing. 

I restarted the system and did the same and again, nothing happened. 

Thanks anyway :["
,jamesensor,2013-02-09T04:20Z,"Working. Took some time, then checked ""my pc"" info and it was there, activated. I disabled auto updates to keep track of its infos (activation tech somehow maibe lurking around)"
[V],murphy78,2013-02-09T06:53Z,"""@w4r3zh4ck - I stole it :] problem?""
The problem is that older versions will get virus blocked, and have less compatibility.

Don't download from this guy. I say this as someone who doesn't run any website, and never makes any money from my uploads.

If it doesn't work, you will just be more confused than people already are with all those hacktivators out there.

Look for newer kmsnano versions that people haven't stripped and potentially infected...

Don't visit this douche's website and help him earn advertising money."

,xuangxi,2013-04-11T08:26Z,windows 8 activator by nepstarjay works flawlessly
,lub094,2013-04-29T01:32Z,"http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8421168 you don't need activators cracks and hacks, just follow these steps and you can get your windows legitimately activated, permanently!"
,japlumbun,2013-05-27T02:17Z,I thought this was safe and it was working until I was gonna use it for a new computer today and AVG turned this up out of nowhere (it was not detected when I downloaded it but rather seems to have been detected because of a virus activation or something) https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-kMNLtmAMyieTFqempHcEhaU2c/edit?usp=sharing
