Serena is simply the best woman tennis player in history; and a lot of us true tennis fans would really wanna watch her games more than any other player right now.
Thanks for your effort anyways."

Who the hell wants to watch women? 
The real tennis is in the men's game."

@smokedog2 No, true tennis fans know that Serena is nowhere near the best woman player in history. She is the best in this era, but this era is particularly weak for obvious reasons."
