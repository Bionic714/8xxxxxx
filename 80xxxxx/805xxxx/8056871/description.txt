Review: 

Thumbnail me is an open source software project based on the ΓÇÿMovie ThumbnailerΓÇÖ binary.
The main idea is to offer a GUI thanks to QT 4.8.0 Framework.
How it works:
Thanks to a friendly GUI, Thumbnail me lets you convert your favorite 
media into thumbnails in a few seconds.

WhatΓÇÖs up in 3.0 version?
Thumbnail me sourcecode has changed considerably. 
New features like ΓÇ£upload thumbnails to imageShackΓÇ¥ or ΓÇ£jpeg, png, bmp, 
tiff output formats supportΓÇ¥ are available.
All updates are available in the release notes.
