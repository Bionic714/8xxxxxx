,mpenn20,2013-01-24T03:35Z,"-Excellent quality as usual s4a.  V9A10. Thanks for the up. 
-For ps3 users out there, there is NO cinavia.
-And for those who will undoubtedly complain about it being in 2 cds...get virtualdub and merge the files. It takes about 3 minutes."
,notnowplz,2013-01-24T03:40Z,is this 1 or 2 cd's???

,int7777,2013-01-24T07:43Z,it's 2 CDs. Thanks for the upload
,DiscGolfNutt,2013-01-24T08:25Z,"@ mpenn20. Thanks for letting us know about the Cinavia not being on this movie. Nothing pisses me off more than getting 20-30 minutes into the movie and then it stops playing because of Cinavia. I wish the uploaders would put that in the INFO area, rather than the IMDB link. We can go to IMDB and check that info out easily, but we never know if we're getting a Cinavia protected movie until we try to watch it. Thanks again."
,mpenn20,2013-01-24T09:20Z,"@DiscGolfNutt - no problem, glad I could help. Cinavia sucks but there's a pretty easy workaround. It's a little inconvenient, but when the cinavia prompt pops up you just back out of the movie, manually adjust your clock forward (i usually move one day forward, but you can do like an hour if you wanted), then resume the movie. You'll have to do it again in 20 minute intervals, but for a 2 hour movie that only ends up being like 5 times. Like I said, a little inconvenient but it still allows you to watch the movie thru ps3."

,ennfenn,2013-01-28T06:00Z,thank you :)
,zakimar5,2013-01-28T19:02Z,"HORRIBLE movie. Daniel Craig is UNWATCHABLE, the worst Bond EVER.

SPOILER ALERT follows.

I was hoping for Javier Bardem (the ""villian"") to win and wanted to see Bond and M die, at least I was partially satisfied.

Thankfully I only wasted my time with this crap, and not my money as well. I'm never going to pay for another Bond movie as long as this idiot is playing him. 

I wish Clive Owen hadn't turned down the role."
,Xenirina,2013-01-29T00:00Z,"I'm writing this for the people who don't understand why it's in two parts:

SPARKS (the release group that ripped the movie) released the files in two parts as the Scene rules say that each file must be able to fit on a 700MB DVD. That's why it's in two parts and it's going to stay that way.

You can easily merge the file through various programs with no trouble at all."
,porkstu,2013-01-29T05:48Z,"Who gives a shyte whether it is in 2 files,the movie is fucking free you ungrateful fucktards,dont like it go fuck yourselves

Thanks!"
,nikodo,2013-01-29T17:28Z,"Xenirina: First of all, there is no such thing as a 700 MB DVD -that's called a CD.

I'm sure you did that mistake because no-one uses CD's anymore. Hardly anyone uses DVD's anymore.

That's why the ""Scene rules"" are hopelessly outdated and needs to be thrown away or at least changed goddammit. 

Make it a full 1.4 GB file instead of that old 2 x 700 MB thing. DO you really think that people still burns the files onto 2 CD's?"
,jaydogg30,2013-01-30T01:20Z,"To all thats trippin over it being in two parts ... Dude! please stop! really? take a movie file thats in nine parts, and so small its an inch square on your screen, and RE-Rip it! personally i use nero, again free all day long on the mighty TPB. combine all the movie files, in order of course, lol that be fucked up if you didnt, up the resolution to ntsc or greater if it will let you, add some options like triple anti-ailasing (or whatever), and some motion detection filtering, and boom! got yourself a full screen high res movie! well, depending on the origional file you may get some pixelation like a smokey background is all blocky but for the most part its very watchable and very good quality. and depending on your machine the recode could take a couple hours. takes about an hour for mine.
