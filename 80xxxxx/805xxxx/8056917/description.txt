This is just the DRM free version of Dungeon Defenders zip file I had when I bought the Humble Indie Bundle7 this year.  

Forgot which version of the game it is, but Gamespy works. 

sometimes older versions of the game you can find people still playing, but I prefer this one. 

This has all the DLC included as well.
