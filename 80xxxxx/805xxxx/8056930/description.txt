A collection of all of Nirvana's best quality "vault" material, presented as an album for the first time. There are no filler tracks featuring multiple demo versions of songs you already know and love....only one track in this compilation appeared on any release of Nirvana's first four records (Endless, Nameless was not part of the original album and the version here is different - better IMHO). A Big Mix of Besides will burn nicely onto two CDs by putting tracks 1-22 on disc one and 23-43 on disc two. Enjoy!
