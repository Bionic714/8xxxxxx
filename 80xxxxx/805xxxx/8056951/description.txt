Many wild game cookbooks feature a section on venison. In this cookbook, however, every recipe calls for venison. This collection of 301 venison recipes represents the combined contributions of Bud Kilmartin, a deer hunter and camp cook from New York, and over 100 readers of Deer & Deer Hunting Magazine. If you need to feed a hungry bunch at deer camp, or serve special guests in your home, look no further for creative ways to prepare hearty and delicious venison.
