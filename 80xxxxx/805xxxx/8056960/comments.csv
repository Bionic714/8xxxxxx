,MisterMS,2013-01-26T19:25Z,"@friend55

Are you fucking serious?"
,Ayni.,2013-01-28T03:04Z,What's the difference between this one and this: http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8060558/Flight.2012.720p.BluRay.DTS.x264-PublicHD. Aside from the size?
,realloyalist,2013-01-29T00:11Z,Problem with YIFY all the additional audio channels are stripped out so you only get stereo.
,paerchu,2013-01-30T01:52Z,"are you serious @ jalucian? I hope TPB should dedicate a page for yify's rip-- all of his rips are only good for you guys with small monitors who doesn't even have a surround setup up -- yify's rips are the abomination in the hidef section of TPB. 

at least bozx has a decent upload that works perfectly in a 32"" and a 5.1 digital output.  usually 10/a-v/10"

A/10

Movie itself is brilliant.

Thanks."
,Aim_To_Maim,2013-01-30T02:57Z,"@jalucian no way a 1-1.5 GB copy is the same quality as this. Its just as paerchu says you must be watching a crappy little 15' monitor or something. 
I'd suggest getting a decent setup before you go offering your obviously limited opinion. 
At least 4GB + for decent quality on big screens is my rule."
,onleej,2013-01-30T20:20Z,"Thanks for the movie, I'm downloading it now. Thanks to those who seed - I'll seed until I reach 30 ratio to give back to the community. Cheers."
,jimaa66,2013-02-02T23:03Z,"You go take your YIFY-
I'll stick with the always solid video AND audio of a BoxZ file.
Thanks BoxZ. Superb work."

,ReDdEviLCnD,2013-02-04T08:58Z,friend55 is a moron
,Superflow,2013-03-04T00:24Z,Great quality but it's the most boring movie I have watched for years. I just begged it would be over after the main event.
,Ayni.,2013-03-05T03:50Z,"Great quality.
Thanks."
,maurixio,2013-03-20T03:08Z,"Yeah!
