,Illudrium,2013-02-16T15:57Z,"Nevermind, my fault.  I had used daemon tools to run the iso instead of extracting it's contents with winrar.  On my way to installing it correctly now."
,HeyItsRay,2013-03-11T22:18Z,"Can you post a video or comment more detailed instructions, or can somebody help me?"
,HeyItsRay,2013-03-11T23:12Z,"Never mind i got it, but is there any way to play online?"

,cthorat,2013-03-22T08:37Z,"Hi, the uplay.exe when run, keeps on updating...it has done it like 9 times now and still going on...is this normal or is there something i am doing wrong?"
,voyer501,2013-03-23T17:01Z,"my question might be a bit stupid but i am confused, am i suppose to run the fc3.setup or is it in uplay? if so where in uplay ???? the uplay installed and updated without issue so just the game piece i am confused about and i dont see a fc3.exe anywhere"
,voyer501,2013-03-23T17:05Z,ran the setup now when i click on the shortcut it opens and then closes like right away
,voyer501,2013-03-23T18:33Z,"k minus all the prior stuff i said i installed it wrong , now i installed it right but i am having the updating loop on uplay and also when it get to use the cracked version i get uplay.exe has run into an error "
