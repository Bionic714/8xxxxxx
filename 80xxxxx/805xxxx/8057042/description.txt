Book Description
Publication Date: January 22, 2012 | ISBN-10: 0321837533 | ISBN-13: 978-0321837530 | Edition: 9
In a Liberal Arts Math course, a common question students ask is, ΓÇ£Why do I have to know this?ΓÇ¥  A Survey of Mathematics with Applications continues to be a best-seller because it shows students how we use mathematics in our daily lives and why this is important. The Ninth Edition further emphasizes this with the addition of new ΓÇ£Why This Is ImportantΓÇ¥ sections throughout the text. Real-life and up-to-date examples motivate the topics throughout, and a wide range of exercises help students to develop their problem-solving and critical thinking skills.
 
Angel, Abbott, and Runde present the material in a way that is clear and accessible to non-math majors. The text includes a wide variety of math topics, with contents that are flexible for use in any one- or two-semester Liberal Arts Math course.
