,Woobedoo,2013-02-03T04:48Z,"It's been over a week.  You haven't finished seeding either of your torrents.

Would you care to tell the 180 downloaders you've left hanging what the problem is?  And if you're not intending to ever seed these torrents out, it'd be nice to know that too."
,magnifikus,2013-02-24T20:41Z,C'mon!! SEED!!! PLEASE! I promise I'll seed for a coupla weeks at least once I get the whole thing.
