The three main characters (Blake, Adam, and Anders) were roommates in college, and, in a phase-of-life transition, continue to do things associated with college after dropping out (drinking, partying, pranks, etc) as they transition into adulthood. The "friendship family's" action is generally confined to the main characters' house and their workspace, a cubicle the three of them share at a telemarketing company called TelAmeriCorp.
