Three Imaginary Boys is the debut studio album by English alternative rock band The Cure. It was released on 11 May 1979, through Fiction Records. It was later released in the United States and Australia with a slightly different song line-up as Boys Don't Cry.
The record company decided which songs were put on the album, as well as the cover artwork, without Robert Smith's consent. For all Cure albums since, Smith has ensured he is given complete creative control over the final product before it goes on sale.
"Foxy Lady", a soundcheck with vocals sung by Michael Dempsey, was not supposed to be on the album, and was removed for the American release. Smith has stated that "songs like 'Object' and 'World War' and our cover of 'Foxy Lady' were [Chris Parry's] choice"
