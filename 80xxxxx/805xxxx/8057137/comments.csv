,dipsss,2013-01-30T23:13Z,The Type setting seems to only have East Asian and Middle Eastern available which results in periods being placed at the beginning of sentences when writing text. Is there a way around this? Thank you for the torrent btw.

,Thooty,2013-02-06T18:34Z,"@Ching_Liu
I have same problem as @pvbers
I read instructions and did everything what I had to do, but it still shows that is not for my version.

Maybe there is a problem with destination folder where is Photoshop installed? Cause I have it installed on my D: disk, not C: but I don't know :-)"
,flankers,2013-02-09T12:29Z,@Thooty - just put 1330 in first input field...rest doesnot matter ^^ 1330 is specific for recognizing photoshop
,vaticanjew,2013-02-11T13:57Z,"Hello, I, like @papatazaa, also got stuck on step 3c..
My serial number isn't valid and I'm running it as administrator.. 
It's no use typing in a random string of numbers either, so..
Any ideas?"
,smirnoff9969,2013-02-13T17:10Z,dude it doesn`t work with Win7 64!!!
,roumor2,2013-02-14T00:11Z,"WIN8x64 FAIL

Installed both 32x  and 64x versions of cs6.
AdobePatchInstaller.exe said: This patch is not applicable for you."
,Dr.BARTON,2013-02-25T10:03Z,"@roumor2

If the updates wouldn't apply then it seems that the first step from the ""nfo"" file was not done properly.

The reason (in my case anyway): a newer version of the ""ApplicationManager"" is present in the system. And this would prevent ""aam-patch.painter"" from accomplishing its purpose: patching the updater.

Solution: Get rid of the existing ""ApplicationManager"". It seems to be located in the ""C:Program FilesCommon FilesAdobeOOBE..."". I just went ahead and ""shift-deleted"" the ""OOBE"" folder (skipped everything that wouldn't be deleted, though I'm sure there is a more appropriate way to do it). After that I did the first step from ""nfo"" again and voila - the updates applied flawlessly :)"
,techo95,2013-02-25T13:20Z,please help...it shows that serial number isn't valid
,ahl0t,2013-02-26T01:14Z,"Thanks Ching_liu its work for me
The only problem can solved this is the internet connection :D
1.first need to disconect the internet
2.open the ""aam-patch.painter"" ang pacth it :D
3.run the ""ApplicationManager6.2_all 
4.install Photoshop_13_LS6 & put the serial nmber 123456789etcc.....
5copy the crack files into the installed location on adobe photoshop cs6 :D

,XtraZoom,2013-02-28T10:40Z,"""C : Users  Username  AppData Local Adobe  OOBE""
""C :  Program Files (x86) Common Files  Adobe  OOBE""

OOBE is located at 2 locations for Win 8 64 bit. My problem is despite finally patching Adobe App Manager when install CS6 it says it cannot connect to internet and it will disable the software after 7 days or something similar. I also have Fireworks CS6 in my system. I hope in future there is all - in - 1 method to install both Adobe products easier."
,nice_guy75,2013-03-10T03:29Z,"I have followed each step still getting ""Invalid Serial"" msg.

Any suggestions?"
,Saveus_asap,2013-03-12T18:33Z,"""Ching Liu (the man who knows how)""
Ching Liu should be a synonym to the word ""consistent""

The software works fine so far.

Although after installing it, it said i've go to validate within 7 days or it'll stop working.
When I launched it today(the 6th day), it said serial number was invalid so I cancelled, and launched it again and the validation message dd'nt pop up. 

In other words the download was successful.

Thanks Ching Liu and of course my fellow seeders :)"
,ensayofr,2013-03-30T09:07Z,"I may sound stupid but where is the ""amm-path.painter.exe"" patch? after installing ""Application6.2_all.exe"" I don't get the first file anywhere... I do not have it in the ""1.Application manager - Patch painter"" folder either..."
,MasonD680,2013-04-02T00:37Z,"Hi, I've been having some issues with this.  Step 3c: ""... and enter any serial.""
No set of numbers I've tried works.  Every time I get told that the serial number is invalid.  A couple of suggestions here in the comments say use 1111's, others say start with 1330.  I've tried these, but with no success.
Can anyone help?"

,TONPumper,2013-04-22T00:47Z,I'm getting an error that says that the update is not applicable for me. Any suggestions?
,TW63684,2013-04-22T09:07Z,"installed and runs great, no virus, I don't know what the guy above was talking about"
,BogPojkin,2013-05-01T20:35Z,"Finally got i working.
Firstly, for the serial number. The serial number must start with ""1330"". If it's not working anyway, you probably need to re-install Adobe Application Manager and re-use the crack.
Tip: After you've used the crack and it says [Complete], or something like that, scroll up and read everything. It it says something with ""failed"", then Adobe Application Manager probably isn't installed or updated properly.
Restart your computer.
If the UPDATER (AdobePatchInstaller.exe) fails, you should know that you need to re-install any previous versions of Photoshop CS6 and use the one on this torrent.
If you know that and it's still not working. Try restarting your computer. Still not working? Install both 64-bit and 32-bit version, restart, update. You can also try re-installing Adobe Application manager and re-crack it (with aam-patch.painter.exe).
Thanks to Adobe, ChinLiu and Painter, and whoever cracked the dlls.

Also, it is NOT a virus. My F-secure tried to block the patcher too, but I guess anti-virus software just hates keygens and patchers."
