,RefractedMemories,2013-01-30T19:17Z,"Hello 
Let me say that we are very happy to have people care enough about this release of ours to want to share it. Neil Young calls pirating the new radio, and I see his point.  We would also like to say that if you like our music please consider helping us continue to be able to produce it by purchasing our album if you can.  We can appreciate the 'try before you buy' attitude promoted by the file sharing community, but also believe that if you enjoy someone's creative endeavor - especially when it is self produced and promoted - it is nice to try and help it suceed.

Jack & Mike"
