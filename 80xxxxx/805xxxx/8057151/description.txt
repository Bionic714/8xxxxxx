   International duo REFRACTED MEMORIES aka Michael Wadlow and Jack Morefield composed a strong sonic introspection mixing sublime synths with melodic blues guitar.
The Cares of Tomorrow is a deep and gentle album, where warm crunchy rhythms and ethereal pads contrast with interference frequencies, fantastic melodic guitar lead lines and organic echoes.Groove and smooth are the foundation of this album which will send you drifting into other perspectives that should wake up your emotions.
