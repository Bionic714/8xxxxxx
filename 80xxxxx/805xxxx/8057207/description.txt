Richard Feynman -- Nobel Laureate, teacher, icon and genius possessed an unquenchable thirst for adventure and an unparalleled gift for telling the extraordinary stories of his life. In this collection of short pieces and reminiscences he describes everything from his love of beauty to college pranks to how his father taught him to think. 

He takes us behind the scenes of the space shuttle Challenger investigation, where he dramatically revealed the cause of the disaster with a simple experiment. And he tells us of how he met his beloved first wife Arlene, and their brief time together before her death. Sometimes intensely moving, sometimes funny, these writings are infused with Feynman's curiosity and passion for life.
