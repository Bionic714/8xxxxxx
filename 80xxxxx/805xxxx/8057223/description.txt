"Dream Weavers"

When the Weavers and Bird-Kersees chaperone Amber 
and Reggie's school dance, Marty, Debbie, Larry 
and Jackie find themselves in their own "high 
school" dramas. Debbie's attempt to re-create a 
romantic moment from her courtship with Marty 
backfires, and, Jackie is so fascinated with how 
Marty and Debbie met in high school, she believes 
the moment she met Larry was boring by comparison 
-- so she tries to change history.
