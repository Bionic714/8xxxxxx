Encoded all 26 episodes of The Tenchi In Tokyo series into high quality MKV h.264 format with both English and Japanese audio, and with all of the Subtitles as well.

Finding this series for download in decent quality must be pretty tough with all the requesters I had asking for this. I can promise this is more than likely the best quality version available now. The one I did find and check out, was just watchable and looked like a crappy VHS rip that was ruined even more by encoding it. I mean it was pretty terrible looking the one I could find.

The DVD's for this series had a VERY poor video transfer, I dont think Ive seen a DVD have this crappy looking of video on it. Its not as good looking as most of my other work but I did what I could with it to make it look better and its probly one of the best copies you will find out there. Enjoy!!

For playback all you need is the proper codec if you dont already have it. 
Combined Community Codec Pack (which I prefer) or the K-Lite Codec pack should give you all you need and more to play these back.

You should be able to hear audio just fine if you have one of the mentioned codec packs above. If you cannot hear any audio and do not want to install a codec pack for some reason, then you do not have and need the nero aac audio codec. As of today it can be found here.
