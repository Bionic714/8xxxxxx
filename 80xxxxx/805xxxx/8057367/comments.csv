,KandajiD,2013-01-25T19:15Z,yes it is for the free account. the game will go officially free sometime in feb.
,2si3,2013-01-31T16:13Z,"@KandajiD is this same version with EU one ? because on official site I don't see 2 version (eu/na) ones, I tried to download through official site downloader but after 4 hours of download just got annoying, it size was 41 GB !! and it was only at 61% ... and time left over 3 hours
so let me know if is same version and how much size does the game itself have after install."
,s1raz1,2013-02-06T05:05Z,"Yea, u need at least 45/50 gb to DL/installl this game, half for DL half for install.
Keep that in mind."
,s1raz1,2013-02-06T05:25Z,"I mistype, i DL the game from the Tera site and that was the space usage, since this is a rar file i dont know whats in it, or i know if will it work because if it is installed already, it could need the registry files."
