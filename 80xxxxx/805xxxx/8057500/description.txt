I created a PDF from the ebook that is available through the online portion of the textbook, Connect Math. This is my first time making a PDF, and I'm kinda short on time, so there's no fancy sectioning or anything. The page numbers at the bottom of each page are off too. But hey, it's better than paying $150 for a goddamn textbook. Hopefully this will suffice until a proper ebook is released. Enjoy!
