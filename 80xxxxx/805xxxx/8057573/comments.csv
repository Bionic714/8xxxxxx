,logansama,2013-01-31T06:22Z,"@3ntomb3d theres some many rips witch 5.1, and all with sizes 1gb or 1.5 or 1.7, cmon, today adsl conecctions, let you download this sizes, in 1hour 

 @pobban2 you are totaly right.

They are popular because they have a request system and many many releases. There is almost no movie that I have searched and they hadn't already released it or in queue to be released. They have released many good old movies too.

But I believe that the main reason they are so popular is because they try to achieve the best combination of small file size and good quality, something that (I believe) matters to the majority of the p2p community."
,_purple_,2013-02-02T12:48Z,"P.S. The problem is not the time needed to download a big torrent but uploading it with at least 1:1 ratio with a 512kbps/1mbps/2mbps upload speed and especially when having to upload like 5 movies, 5 episodes, 2 games, etc."

@Percypp:

You're a scrote. I'm watching this on a 55"" TV via HDMI right now and the quality is still far better than DVD. Get some better hardware, maybe your situation will improve. In the mean time, if you want BluRay quality, go buy a BluRay player, buy or rent the movies you want to watch, and leave torrents to people who appreciate them.

Considering it took all of 15 minutes to download, and it was free,

,Grondaivor,2013-03-03T08:40Z,"For those who are to stupid to understand why this is in HD, this is a 21:9 aspect ratio, not a 16:9. This means that it cannot be 1280p:720p because it would warp the screen. the 720p represents Height, not quality. The quality you get from 720p is because of the large resolution, while this may be 536p, it still contains the 720p quality. Only difference is the 21:9 vs 16:9 (This has black bars). to ""Increase"" the resolution would be a waste of time and unnecessary file size increase. "
,Grondaivor,2013-03-03T08:51Z,"@3ntomb3d,

YIFY does a amazing job at keeping video quality, but it is fairly debatable that it would not hurt the file size at all to give it 5.1. I like to think YIFY keeps it 2 channels for its large widespread capability. There are many devices that do not cooperate very well with 5.1 and would not be deemed necessary for devices that don't even support 5.1. 2 channel still provides a decent quality. I REALLY don't think it would kill to use 128 audio though. Its a slight increase from the 95 and would help prevent me from having to turn my headset ALL the way up."
