When a young man with a chronic speech impediment is caught by the police for joyriding, Fitz is 

brought onto the case and recommends a psychological evaluation. However D.S. Beck releases the young 

man contrary to Fitz's advice, and the violent murder of a loan shark in a dark alley marks the 

beginning of what Fitz considers to be a Bonnie & Clyde style killing spree. A volatile male 

personality with enough strength to murder a man with his bare hands, and a female with the sexual 

chemistry to lure potential victims to their death. Fitz's success on the professional front 

contrasts with his own personal failings as the drink and gambling take their toll
