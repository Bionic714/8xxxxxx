[H],LemonJ-Lo,2013-01-25T20:17Z,"@LD1ne: You need to follow the TPB instructions exactly for posting a torrent.  It isn't sufficient to simply post the torrent file you create, you also need to download the converted torrent file from TPB and seed *that* if you haven't done so.  

If you did follow the instructions, then simply try it again as a new torrent post.

,LD1ne,2013-01-27T03:14Z,Ok i'm sorry i screwed up with this one going to be uploading a new one shortly with the correct method. Is there anyway to get rid of this listing so people don't try to download it anymore?
