,sofinsicc,2013-01-24T07:20Z,This is not the image provided from Acer but rather an all in one package to help restore... It is Windows 8 (all versions) with acer w510  drivers...just google how to make a bootable UEFI usb drive then extract to thumbdrive... boot with dock connected and usb drive plugged directly into w510 via provided cord... plug a wireless mouse into the dock (just do it) then boot from usb
