,rotted84,2013-01-26T16:53Z,Can anyone tell me if it is Multilanguage or what spoken language and subtitles it contains please !!!
,nazgull2k10,2013-01-26T19:50Z,"unfortunately, this is nowhere NEAR as great as Monkey Island or Maniac Mansion.. in fact.. this is more akin to Lost Vikings then anything.  All of the ""puzzles"" are solved FAR too easily and always consist of 2 hitting a switch so a 3rd can pass.

,rotted84,2013-01-26T21:03Z,"for all who want to  ""CHANGE LANGUAGE""
go to your installdir
Data..Config..edit ""language.cfg to your preferd language."
,rick404,2013-01-27T01:25Z,"@Mr.Stifmeister

,noelakos,2013-01-29T11:08Z,"The game is laggy !! -_-
i cannot accept that im playing games like FARCRY3 with ultra high visuals and my FPS is great and smooth and this 2D platform, disabled all visuals, and FPS is really that bad... seriously ! WTF ?"

,naks123,2013-02-03T19:37Z,Damn Sweet! Thank you and respect to the uploader!
,CRFbadass,2013-02-06T21:46Z,"So I just downloaded it, I'm pretty sure I did everything right... and when it installed or whatever I had a note on the screen saying ""Support the software developers. If you like this game, BUY IT!"" So I was all happy, then it came to a screen where my only options were ""Repair game"" or ""Uninstall game"" and so I clicked repair and i'm clicking the desktop icon now, but it's just taking me to Steam to buy it :/ what did I do wrong?! "
,ag_orange,2013-02-07T20:42Z,It won't continue from my last saved game....just says Push enter over and over again...i've tried deleting the folders with the numbers in the App data->Roaming->Doublefine->The cave but nothing helps... I guess i'll must play it from the beginning...
,ajrodelo,2013-02-13T08:45Z,the game crashes as soon as i start it
,387318,2013-02-22T03:25Z,"Ok so I downloaded this to uTorrent and it is done downloading. so i click it, now what? it was saying i had to put it on a disk?"
,sudha_beast,2013-02-26T05:16Z,d3dx9_43.dll plz help system error cave .exe
,saragm,2013-03-19T14:43Z,It crashes soon after I start playing. When I touch a fuse box with any character. It crashes the entire computer actually.
,jimmy_randall,2013-05-04T05:29Z,"I can't tell if I'm missing the Achievements or if they are not available?  I guess since the game is pirated there's no way to register with Steam to log them, eh?

(I found an ini file that keeps track but I'd rather see it in the game.)"
