,shamag,2013-01-24T10:51Z,so where are your Total Marvel packs that you say you release?
,Keeper21,2013-01-24T14:57Z,"Great!Im waiting for the Total Marvel torrent!
Thank you"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-01-25T06:44Z,"Thank you dadrkhomr!

First, it's been documented that many A+X solicitations from Marvel are wrong because stories were late or whatever, so that isn't dadrkhomr's fault at all.

Second, I understand the reasoning behind asking about ""where's yer torrent that has this"" but FUCK quit whining and say thank you for what he did post. This doesn't apply to everybody, just the pissants who don't show gratitude."
