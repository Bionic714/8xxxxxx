,lucidfer,2013-01-24T19:42Z,"I had to finally register here, just to say that this is a wonderful torrent. Could you upload the 1940's era Warner Brothers cartoons? That would be fantastic. Thanks!"
,padenj420,2013-01-25T06:53Z,"No worries. :) I'll be doing the 50's next, then the 40', then '29 - '39."
,brandonj12011988,2013-02-10T01:12Z,"would you be able to link me up with the 1929 - '39 torrent
ive been looking for a while and can not find it.

thank you so much."
,padenj420,2013-02-10T19:22Z,I haven't been able to upload it yet. The 40's just finished. I'll probably get it posted tonight or tomorrow. :) Glad you're enjoying these.
,brandonj12011988,2013-02-11T02:28Z,"oh okay.
yes, i love oldie cartoons, thanks for taking the time to upload."
,padenj420,2013-02-11T05:03Z,"No worries. :) I noticed that this collection never got reposted since Demonoid went down, so I figured it would be a good idea. "
,brandonj12011988,2013-02-11T20:33Z,"good call on your part, cartoons definitely aren't made like they used to be."
,brandonj12011988,2013-02-12T21:25Z,"when you upload it can you post a link on here 
thanks"
