  Manish Bhasin presents a review of the semi-final second-leg          
  encounters, which saw Aston Villa host Bradford City at Villa Park    
  and Swansea City face Chelsea at the Liberty Stadium. Bradford, who   
  led 3-1 on aggregate following the first leg, were aiming to become   
  only the second team from the fourth tier of English football to      
  compete in this tournament's showpiece match, while the Swans were    
  looking to defend a 2-0 lead from the opener and reach the final for  
  the first time in their history.

  W4F is one of the oldest TV Scene groups and releases a diverse mix   
  of quality TV programming including sports, documentaries, scripted,  
  reality, talk shows and other quality content that may be overlooked  
  by other groups. We release purely for fun and to share programming   
  we like with the world.                                               
                                                                        
  W4F is a global group interested in spreading quality programming     
  from around the world to the internet. If you are passionate about    
  your country's TV content, feel it is unrepresented and want to share 
  it with the world please feel free to contact us. We are interested   
  in all television markets with a focus on English content from the    
  USA, Canada, Australia and Europe. Potential recruits will preferably 
  have the ability to receive digital TV broadcasts and some knowledge  
  of digital capturing.                                                 
                                                                        
  From time to time we are also interested in hearing from site         
  owners who are interested in affiliating W4F. We are looking for      
  private links with archives.
