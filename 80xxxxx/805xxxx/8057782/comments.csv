,jc4321234,2013-01-24T07:57Z,"I really have been drinking that's whats funny, copying and pasting becomes difficult.  But you'd think the biggest torrent site would add simple features such as editing torrent titles or even a functioning delete button.  It makes fuck all sense why they don't allow mistakes to be corrected."
