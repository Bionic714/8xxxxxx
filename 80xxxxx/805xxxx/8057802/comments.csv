,notnowplz,2013-01-24T11:14Z,i just hate it when they do 2 cd's is all!!!!!
,.Leto.,2013-01-24T11:52Z,"Yes I agree, 2 CD is really stupid. And totally useless. Seriously, unless you live in some third world country and can only download 700MB movies, who still uses CD for his movies nowadays??? Plus the one who ripped this was forced to use a really low video bitrate, 900 kbps, just so he could put the movies on CD!! Incredibly stupid once again. We're in 2013, CD and 700MB movies are completely outdated.
Not really a problem though, the blu-ray will be available very soon."
