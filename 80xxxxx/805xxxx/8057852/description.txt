Elements is a sound looping application.
It gives relaxation & meditation.
Sort of same as our Comfeo app (Available at the piratebay for free (up to 2.1)
And yet so different.

Like daytime the night has totally different sounds and settings.
Its just a switch away!

There are many things in the planning for this new installment.
