,Dargo80,2013-01-24T12:35Z,"@dackanuber Try this. Find fmodex.dll at dll-files. com. download, extract, copy and paste it in System32 folder.

c:/windows/system32/"
,Zwagon,2013-01-24T15:19Z,"If you're having dll problems, trying copying the crack to the Binary folder in the Main game folder instead."
,sixtailer,2013-01-25T03:35Z,"This version is NOT COMPLETE.  Doesn't include any of the backdrop graphics.  no stars, no nebulae, no earth, no gas fields.  essentially it lacks and of the stuff that makes the screenshots look so nice.  NUKE this garbage until we get a real complete version."
,blaymoric,2013-01-25T03:53Z,"Downloading, will report back when/if I can"
,warrain,2013-01-25T03:54Z,Is it possible for you to upload the soundtrack alone?
,Ears14U,2013-01-25T06:27Z,Error in the installer.  Runtime Error (at 30:3617):Could not call proc.
,aLsordon,2013-01-25T08:15Z,"is it true what @sixtailer says?, this isnt complete?, please anyone!"
,sixtailer,2013-01-25T09:37Z,"I got it to work....but it involves installing the other version that was seeded here on the bay...the one by COGENT.  once both are installed, copy the ""ART"" folder from the pc > main directory in the COGENT version, and replace the one in the install directory for this version.  this rearranges some of the folders (though there are still the same number of files total) and enables the backgrounds and starscapes to work....makes ALL the difference in the world.  you're welcome!"
,rmpyro,2013-01-25T14:10Z,Cost only 15 euro on steam. 
,blaymoric,2013-01-25T23:15Z,"Game itself work's fine, running at 1920x1080 all settings maxed smoothly Win7 x64. However, what Sixtailer said it's correct, for whatever reason when this idiot made the torrent, the planets in the background are missing."
,PPierce34,2013-01-26T00:04Z,"I just installed and don't have time to play right now. I have no idea what is supposed to be in the background of the first training mission, but there are stars and blue nebula looking things in the background. Are you guys saying I should be seeing more in the background?"
,blaymoric,2013-01-26T03:15Z,"@Ppierce, Yeah I'm mostly sure it isn't just supposed to be a Blue nebula + stars. I think there is supposed to be a planet in the black void"
,Lobuno,2013-01-26T05:59Z,"@Ppierce: that's exactly what's wrong. You should see a huge blue planet in the background.
I'm playing the COGENT release and works great, the the difference is HUGE, being able to see the background now enemy ships are spotted better against the background they are designed to be against.
Check yourselves!!!!!"
,rebelflagvl,2013-01-26T07:17Z,"Normally I don't say things like this but if you like this game you guys should buy it, i got it for like $15 and its a steam kickstarter game which means its not from a big studio it was donations which got this game made. they asked for $100,000 to get the game made and raised almost twice that but thats all they have."
,Lobuno,2013-01-26T11:50Z,"Look here some images from the game as it should display http://www.gog.com/gamecard/strike_suit_zero
The second screenshot is from the first/training mission (see the huge blue plante taking the whole screen).
Also buy if you like."
,[F]OxY,2013-01-27T00:03Z,"True, this version is lacking pretty much anything that make it good!
If you really want the full experience you should download the Cogent release and do what sixtailer said...
btw, here's the link http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8060176/Strike.Suit.Zero-COGENT"
,Lobuno,2013-01-27T11:32Z,"@Foxy:
Don't need to do what sixtailer said, simply install COGENT release, it's perfectly OK."
,PPierce34,2013-01-27T18:43Z,So basically this release should be nuked. Don't download or seed it. Download and seed the Cogent release.
,randylin,2013-01-27T19:59Z,"It works, however can you upload the first patch for me? It seems the game keeps crashing after a certain mission and it keeps crashing after launch. I realized the first patch for SSZ fixed this so please upload it."
,randylin,2013-01-27T20:02Z,Please upload the first patch of SSZ as it fixes this game crash problem I am having and I can't play it ever since!
,VegitoDBZ,2013-01-29T18:06Z,Game works perfectly
,RiverRaidII,2013-01-29T21:20Z,"As mentioned before, the game may work fine, but there's background art missing."
,rnandesh,2013-04-10T11:17Z,The game started to crash when I arrived to level 10 :-(
,rnandesh,2013-04-10T11:18Z,Does anyone knows in which folder of windows the saved game files are stored?
,rnandesh,2013-04-11T10:00Z,"@Lobuno : as sixtailer said, we need to copy Art folder of Cogent release to our actual game installation. 

@sixtailer : Thank you :-)"
,Kevin91x,2013-05-29T04:22Z,"It doesn't include artbooks or soundtracks in this release. What a piece of garbage, rather download COGENT version .."
