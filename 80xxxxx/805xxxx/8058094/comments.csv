,.Leto.,2013-01-24T16:30Z,"It's a bit out of sync but there's a repack version available. It's not uploaded here yet but you just have to google ""American Mary 2012 DVDRip REPACK XviD AC3 - HDSI"" "
,SKiNmanikin,2013-01-25T14:33Z,"totally out of sync in gomplayer, vlc and mplayerc"
,.Leto.,2013-01-26T02:07Z,"Like I already said there's a new version of this 1.8GB release available and that one isn't out of sync. I just finished watching it a few minutes ago and I didn't notice any problem. So stop downloading this one and google ""American Mary 2012 DVDRip REPACK XviD AC3 - HDSI"". That's not too difficult, isn't it?
About the movie itself Katharine Isabelle is absolutely fabulous, the movie is very well shot but I was expecting a lot more gore. Still excellent though. And more entertaining and interesting than a lot of movies with a 100 million $ budget."

,SKiNmanikin,2013-01-26T18:25Z,"the other MAJESTIC version is out of sync a little also, just enough to be anoying"
