,xavi3r666,2013-02-21T19:38Z,"Hi everybody!
I just wanna share this trick which helped me to activate my office 2013.

1. get a copy of any office 2010, as well as any 2013 here in TPB office account> about office.

8. Done, now you can see it is activated. I haven't log in in the office program, and I do not know if by doing this might cause an error in activating office, so I suggest don't log in unless you want to do it by yourself! ;)

I hope this can help u as to me. I've got win 8 64 on my pc, this lil trick happened to me the same way when I had office 2007 and I wanted to upgrade to office 2010. I wonder if you can also do this by installing first office 2007 then office 2013. 
Good luck everybody and long live TPB "

,xavi3r666,2013-02-22T04:48Z,"Fucking windows.
Sorry everybody, my previous comment wasn't complete.

Hi once again.

I came here to share this activation method which helped me to activate both office 2010 and 2013.

1. U need to have both office 2010 and 2013, u can get it here obviously :)

2. First of all, install and activate office 2010, then open any file in order to save the configurations about updates ( I usually don`t install updates).

3. After doing this, go to your folder where u have office 2013 and install it. 
It will ask you if u wanna update, just click ""OK"" or ""continue"". Wait until the installation finish.

4. After the office 2013 installation has finished, it will ask you to reboot. After rebooting,  try to open any office file, just to be sure the installation is correct.

5. Another reboot might be necessary after u open your office file.

6. Once again after reboot open the office file, go to: 
File>Office account>About Microsoft office. There you can notice your office is already activated. 

7. Enjoy it. 

IMPORTANT: I didn't logged in with my office account (and I would never) so I am not sure if this makes any important change in order to activate your office. But u are welcome to try this on your own risk.

As I said b4, this helped me to activate office 2010, but I started to install office 2007 first and then made the upgrade to office 2010 following the same method.

Hope this can help to everybody

Long live TPB "
