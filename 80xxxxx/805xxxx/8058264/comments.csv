,doritoman,2013-01-24T18:49Z,thanks.. but the bit rate is too low.. i noticed you started lowering it again.. it should be 2000 for 1080p rips :/ thanks anyway

You have totally wrong!
This is top notch rip!"
,doritoman,2013-01-24T22:30Z,I'll DL it still to check but 1600bits for video isnt enough for a 1080p rip especially for 1hour54minutes. most 1080p rips i see have 2000-2200 bit rate for video. a 1080p rip should be 100mb for every 10 minutes. so this video should be 1.5gb with 2ch audio :) just letting you know anyways. this is closer to 720p quality than it is 1080p :)
,pro346pro,2013-01-25T03:23Z,Bitrate is fine plenty of up loaders  doing large size rips .....@doritoman but you haven't dl it so how would you know.
[V],Zen_Bud,2013-01-25T03:37Z,doritoman...moron fuck off
,doritoman,2013-01-25T05:23Z,"Its surprisingly good quality :) my apologies, but no need to talk foul to your uploaders :o"
