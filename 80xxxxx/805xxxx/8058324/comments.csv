,.Leto.,2013-01-25T05:57Z,"I don't know what the hell is wrong with this site, almost nobody is posting the 300-400MB versions anymore!!!
There's no way I'm going to download a RAR 1.1GB talk-show!!!
You can find non-720p versions on the internet. For example this one is here:
Conan.2013.01.23.Kathy.Griffin.HDTV.x264-BAJSKORV
