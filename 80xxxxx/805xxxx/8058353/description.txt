Another Obscure Charleston title featuring art from the great Steve Ditko.  Each issue has on average at list 1 story pencilled and inked by Ditko, if not the covers as well.  Alot of them have 3 stories by the master.

I hope you all enjoy and seed this well, as my bandwidth is limited, and I can only keep it up till my share ratio hits 5.0 or so.
