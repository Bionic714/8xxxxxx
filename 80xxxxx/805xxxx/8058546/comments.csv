So here ya go: http://www.gamerankings.com/pc/671772-the-cave/index.html
Let me know if there is a better game review site to link to."
,lordvo1demort12,2013-01-24T13:18Z,this games pretty good i played a demo on my xbox .. quick question .. i have a mac .. and if id download this torrent would i be able to play this on the mac ? 
,asnsmooker,2013-01-24T13:54Z,when will u upload DMC?anyway thnx alot.....
,riczter,2013-01-24T14:30Z,"voldemort, no this wouldn't work on a mac. I don't know much about macs but i think mac programs install using a different method with files ending in .dmg, while windows programs install using an executable .exe file. I hope i got that right. 
Tpb has a seperate section for mac games. http://thepiratebay.sx/top/402"

Ranking means nothing. In fact most often times I end up enjoying games that get a fairly bad score. We all have different aspects of what entertains us. Just like would you rather have a clown perform at your birthday party or a famous rock band? "
