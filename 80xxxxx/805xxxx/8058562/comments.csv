,muckymucks,2013-01-24T11:21Z,This is worth watching just for the end when they admit they ruined TechTV.
,xSamsonx,2013-01-24T18:56Z,"I made an account to say thank you, to you and all others who seeded and put up these torrents. When I moved and directv dropped G4 I was unable to watch it until I started torrenting them. Thank you for all of your hard work over the past couple years. 

AOTS is one of my favorite shows of all time. I will continue to seed until downloads fall silent. I'm seeding episodes all the way back to september. After a couple PC crashes I've managed to accumulate a huge back log of episodes. Thanks for everything"

X-Play's last episode: https://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8061121

ALSO
apparently there's a ""secret ending"" that was not included in multiple TV broadcasters
go to youtube and find a video titled: ""AOTS Finale: Secret Ending.mp4""


@Muckymucks
When they had the owner of G4 on before Kevin left, they talked about how they felt they had went about it the wrong way and ended up ruining TechTV. They know they did it, but they didnt do it on purpose. I think we all are past that and hope something new comes out of this just like G4 did when TechTV went away.

@XSamsonx
I was put into the same situation, so i tried to do my part to help spread the show. Thanks for supporting the show and these torrents."

Loved the secret ending. I remember sometimes when I'd gone for a couple weeks just scrolling through demonoid catching up on torrents. Again, Thanks for everything. I'll check out the x play finale."
