I have n NHL account but I'm in a part of Asia now that blocks access. Without this I'd be lost. Again, you fucking rawk!!! Now if only I could stop catching the final scores on facebook before I get to watch the game. :()"

I lost my job and can no longer afford cable so this is a godsend and so are you!!!"
