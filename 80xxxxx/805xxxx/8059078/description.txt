The only game you need to put the data in the adroid/OBB folder is call of duty black ops zombies. all of the others you can just install and run. some of them will need to download the game files. grand theft auto 3 is about 1 gig and vice city is about 1.7 gigs. The Bard's Tale is a little under 2gigs. thank you and please seed.
