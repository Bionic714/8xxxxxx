Discovered by Kenny Dreamx, Jimmy Heidecker, and Andrew Wendland

Introduction:

For years it has been rumored that Pink Floyd's masterpiece "Echoes" from Meddle can be played while watching "Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite" from 2001 - A Space Odyssey. Many people have enjoyeed this sync and consider it one of the best. Kenny Dreamx introduced me to his Ummagumma/2001 sync some time in 1999, and I was impressed with it but was unsure if it was intentional. Toward the end of 2001, Jimmy Heidecker sent me a note about his discovery of a complete sync for this movie adding the remaining portions to Kenny's sync. After some experimentation, I concluded that Jimmy almost had it right. He had the right songs but in the wrong order. What I present here is what I believe is the intended sync, but I admit that this is most complicated sync on this page, and the one in which I have the least confidence. However, it is very enjoyable to watch.

Ummagumma was re-released on cassette in 1973 with all of the studio songs and only one of the live songs. The songs were in a completely different order than the original 1969 double-album release. It is this re-ordering of the songs that is crucial for this sync. Keep in mind that it is not necessary to use the cassette version to perform this sync, most CD players can be programmed to reorder the tracks during playback.

The sync begins with a piece from Meddle, follows with the Ummagumma cassette tunes, continues with the title track from Atom Heart Mother, returns to the Ummagumma unused live tracks, and concludes with Meddle's "Echoes." The pattern is:

Meddle - Ummagumma - Atom Heart Mother - Ummagumma - Meddle
