,sixtailer,2013-01-25T03:41Z,"This version is NOT COMPLETE. Doesn't include any of the backdrop graphics. no stars, no nebulae, no earth, no gas fields. essentially it lacks any of the stuff that makes the screenshots look so nice. NUKE this garbage until we get a real complete version."
,aLsordon,2013-01-25T08:13Z,"is it true?, this isnt complete?, please anyone!"
,Lobuno,2013-01-25T11:25Z,"@aLsordon:
Yes it's true, the space graphics are missing so you see the galaxy pitch black (i.e. you don't anything except ships, space stations, etc)
Someone said you can fix this downloading COGENT release (http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8060176/Strike.Suit.Zero-COGENT) and replacing the ART folder of this release with COGENT's one."
,Lobuno,2013-01-26T05:54Z,"Download COGENT release and forget this. The ONLY difference is this one includes soundtrack and art book, you can take those and delete the rest."
,Lobuno,2013-01-26T11:49Z,"Look here some images from the game as it should display http://www.gog.com/gamecard/strike_suit_zero
The second screenshot is from the first/training mission (see the huge blue plante taking the whole screen).
Also buy if you like."
