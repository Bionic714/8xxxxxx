The mods delete them eventually and then you look silly getting all bent out of shape over a comment that no longer exists. Besides, it's not like they ever come back to this page and read your comment and have a profound moment of reflection upon reading your words of chastisement. Chill out bros, balance will soon return to the universe.

Now how about the A/V??? That's what I wanna know."

I'll say that I was happy to hear Arnold was returning to the big screen for starring roles once his Governorship was over. Quality was so-so but there is a HD one at stand.blake7.net which worked great for me. Enjoy this entertaining movie!"
