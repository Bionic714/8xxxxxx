Lost in time. Low on gas. Surrounded by dames. As Ashley J. Williams tries to find his way back into the present, he lands in 1920's Chicago smack in the middle of the clash between Eliot Ness and Al Capone, but a time-lost copy of the Necronomicon threatens to change the course of history! It's a hot time in the old town tonight when Ash finds himself exchanging his boomstick for a tommy-gun, butting heads with deadite mobsters and crossing paths with dangerous dames. All new adventures! All new enemies! Featuring the hero from the classic horror/adventure movie!
