"It's not just a war for talent out there, it's a war for the right talent. Cable sheds light on how managers can identify and attract the right people to turn strategy into reality." --Susan Ashford, Associate Dean for Leadership Programming and the Executive MBA Program, University of Michigan "Change to Strange takes the mystery out of the gap between strategy and strategy execution. Daniel underscores that success is dependent on the quality of your workforce, specific targets, and disciplined measurement. The book provides a useful process and a set of questions that your leadership team needs to address to create a great organization that stands above competitors." --Stan Kelly, Senior Vice President, Wachovia Corporation
