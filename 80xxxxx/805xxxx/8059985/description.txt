Why are we sometimes so unhappy and unfulfilled?
Why do we sometimes get into the wrong relationships, take the wrong jobs, and make the wrong choices?
The answers and solutions to these everyday plights are revealed by todayΓÇÖs ΓÇ£scientists of the mind,ΓÇ¥ evolutionary psychologists who have discovered stunning new lessons about the power of instincts and their capacity to transform lives positively.

But too many of us have lost contact with our instincts. We donΓÇÖt hear them. We donΓÇÖt use them. And that gets us in troubleΓÇôover and over again.
