What People Want, for the first time, addresses the changing demographics and differences in the workplace to highlight what matters most in employee-manager relationships. Based on first-of-its-kind research that assessed the needs of hundreds of professionals across a variety of industries, Terry Bacon explores in-depth the seven most important needs-for trust, challenge, self-worth, competence, appreciation, excitement, and an ability to develop and sustain an identity of merit.
