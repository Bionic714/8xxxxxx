Ultimate Spider-man - Season 2 - Episode 2 (WEB-DL - 720p - MP4)
----------------------------------------------------------------

On his journey to become the Ultimate Hero, Peter Parker has handled tough
challenges. From learning to team up with fellow Super Heroes (including
The Avengers!), to fighting baddies from across the Marvel Universe, to
remembering to pick up groceries for Aunt May, Spidey thought he had things
all webbed up. Now, his world's been turned upside down as his teammates
become roommates and they're left to face foes without the help of S.H.I.E.L.D.
But when iconic Marvel villains like The Lizard, Kraven, Electro, the Rhino and
Doc Ock team up to take on the young heroes, it's time for Spidey to discover
the "great responsibility" of being a leader in season 2 of Ultimate Spider-Man.
