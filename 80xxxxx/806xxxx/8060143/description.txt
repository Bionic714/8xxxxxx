This patch is for the GOG release, according to GOG it fixes the outstanding bugs
on their initial release of Tomb Raider 1 2 3.


Tested and works fine with the main game which can be found here (thanks esharoth):

And finally thanks to Khusagno of Torrent Reactor for providing the password, which 
is otherwise practically impossible to acquire without getting spammed to death by some uploaders of this patch and their crappy spam and surveys. I don't give much credit to pricks with malicious intent, sorry.


Do seed and enjoy!
