,greend20,2013-02-04T06:57Z,"Wow, just wow. I've been looking for some good rips of this show forever. 
How many seasons do you have?
Hope you keep putting em up, either way thank you very much. 
This show is rated 9.1 at tvcom. To put that in perspective Seinfeld is also a 9.1. 
Good stuff atndigcrk, good stuff."
,greend20,2013-02-04T07:04Z,"To Miksta78, There are only 23 episodes in Season 7, there are 23 episodes in this torrent. I don't know what info you have but you are wrong. Season 7 starts with Inked in Blood and ends with In Cold Blood. "
,Miksta78,2013-02-05T16:17Z,^   Check it out for yourself....http://www.tvrage.com/The_First_48/episode_list/7
,Miksta78,2013-02-05T16:18Z,Ive been using that guide from season 1 all the way to season 6 and it's been spot on all the time except for 7
,Miksta78,2013-02-05T16:20Z,...and heres another one for ya...http://epguides.com/First48/
,Miksta78,2013-02-05T16:21Z,...and episode 5 is an update special....season 10 update special 3...
,Miksta78,2013-02-05T16:27Z,...and don't bother looking at Wikipedia's list cause it's completely wrong and outdated....
,Miksta78,2013-02-05T16:30Z,...and like i said...it's an observation and not a complaint...grateful to get this as it's difficult to come by....
,greend20,2013-02-14T12:00Z,You are correct Miksta78. I've been using tvdotcom episode guide all this time. I looked at the one you provided and some others and I now see the others. I apologize. This season 7 download is missing many episodes. You know where to find these?
,greend20,2013-02-14T12:09Z,OK> Here is the deal Miksta78. I just checked out the season 7 dvd on amazon and it only has the 23 episodes. So these extra episodes must be tv only. So unless someone recorded them and uploaded we won't be able to find them. 
,greend20,2013-02-14T12:17Z,OK again. All those episodes you and I thought were missing are season 8 episodes. 
,Miksta78,2013-02-15T18:43Z,Looks like a big mixup...oh well as long as we get them spose it doesnt matter what order they're in....thanks
,mness,2013-02-20T13:06Z,I can't thank you enough for putting these seasons up!! I had been looking everywhere for them. Ur the best
,greend20,2013-02-28T07:44Z,Looking forward to Season 8! Just an addicting show. 
,Hick3y,2013-03-08T11:15Z,"I used to record episodes of the show on the A&E website. But as of recently, they updated their flash player and I can't do it anymore. I hope someone catches the airings of the new episodes on tv and shares them on here with all of us! That would be awesome! 

The newest ep's i'm up to are =
Birthday Girl (March 7th)
After the First 48 - Brother's Blood (March 7th)

Fingers are crossed ;)."
