,WD-i,2013-05-12T04:44Z,"This crack doesn't work at all...

This is what I do each time:

1. Mount the given iso with Daemon Tools
2. it auto-runs setup.exe
3. I set the installation folder and the COGENT  installer does its thing
4. After it finishes, I go back into the original iso with 7-zip and copy the files from the CRACK folder
5. I go to the folder where it installed, go to the BINARY folder, and paste all of the cracked files into it
6. I run the cracked SSZ.exe
7. screen goes black, and then (for some ungoldy reason) my monitor tells me it's no longer connected to my PC...

So yeah, if anyone can let me know what I'm doing wrong, I'd really appreciate that."
