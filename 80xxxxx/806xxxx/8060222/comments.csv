,Danbouges,2013-01-30T18:43Z,"you know what? thanks man... But I have to agree with the other guy. If you are going to lie and put 1080p on a 816p movie... I'm offended. Why not advertise ""Looper 816p"" just because it came from a 1080p blu ray doesn't mean you can stamp ""1080p"" on the upload. I can't believe pirate pay doesn't enforce this. I'm shocked it says you are a moderator. How do you guys allow this? If you fully rip a 1080p BRD and your end result is 1080p, than your 1080p! But if you're too lazy to do a good rip, why should you be able to advertise at 1080p next to the guy who spent his time making a 45 GB true 1080p rip ??? You don't. You should have labeled this 720p. You are being dishonest and cheating. I'm sick of it too. I'll seed... I'll download and I'll seed, i'm all about the sharing, not trying to be a dick. But as far as 720p/1080p piratebay should enforce that you can only label something 720p if it is 720 lines progressive or greater. you can only label 1080p if it's 1080 lines progressive. you can't just do any shitty rip any old way with pixelation and poor quality and half of the bitrate gone and call it ""1080p"" just because you happened to have ripped it from a 1080 original source. People don't care what your original source is in the title... put that in the description. IN THE TITLE PUT WHAT RESOLUTION THE ACTUAL FRICKIN FILE YOU ARE OFFERING IS IN. DON'T LIE TO GET DOWNLOADS. What you are doing is dishonest and not good for the site. I'm not sure why you are chosen to moderate the site. Don't be childish and ban me and/or the other guy or something because we disagree. I'll seed. I would also thank you for being nice enough to upload this for me if you would just be honest."
,Bitrader,2013-02-01T01:08Z,"i agree with @Danboughs. i,m not going to download this b/c he is right.  As i understand, PB wont remove something if it's properly labled, if it's says 1080p and it's not 1080p it sould be removed or re-named to acommodate the data in the torrent. if people want to download 1920x816 in smaller files thats fine, let them, but for those who want a real 1920x1080 movie we shouldn't have to sift through BS to find it."
,sean2e1958,2013-02-06T10:42Z,"Hey dipshits, 1080p is a standard for TV's. There's 1920 pixels horizontally and 1080 vertically.

This is isnt a 16:9 ratio file and is 2.39:1 or 2.40:1 aka cinema standard.... Notice how there is still black bars like if you watched a 16:9 video on a 4:3 display??? basically there is 132 vertical pixels for each black bar... We just go with 1080 as a standard for 19:9 HD, It could of  easily been known as 1920 HD "
,erraticchevy,2013-04-22T18:13Z,"Ya you guys are a bunch of dumbass ass crybaby's.
1920x816 doesn't change any resolution from 1080.
the guy just ripped the video without the bars so your not downloading more files that you dont need. 

He did you guys a favor and you complain because your ignorant. If you have a 4x6 photograph and cut a quarter inch off of the top and bottom, is it going to make the pictures resolution look different? Not as Good? ""NO."" Its the same thing with the video. Its still the same with no bars. If you don't understand resolution then you shouldn't be making comments about this. These guys do you a favor and you complain over something you know nothing about. Good luck in life"
