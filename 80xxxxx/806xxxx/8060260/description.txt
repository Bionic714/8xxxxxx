Tad - Inhaler (1993)

This is a reseed. Sorry the other didn´t work.

nhaler is the third studio album by Tad and was the band's major label debut after two records and an EP released through Sub Pop; it was also their first album with drummer Josh Sinder, formerly of The Accüsed. Tad toured with Soundgarden to promote Inhaler although the band failed to obtain worldwide success; but the record is widely regarded to be the band's strongest and obtained positive critical reception upon release.

The song "Grease Box" was played during the end credits of the 1994 movie Brainscan starring Edward Furlong.
