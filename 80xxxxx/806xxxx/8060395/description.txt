A father, Hunter Isth, is rocked by a tragic accident in his life. He fleets town and is no longer seen. Partying teenagers fall victim to a town lunatic. Throughout the years the stories become urban legends and more than likely, myths. In present day we meet Jenn, a tough and beautiful girl, who has just been released from an extensive stay at the hospital. When her parents bring her home she barely has time to rest as her friends come over and drag her out camping for the weekend. Seven friends venture out to the woods but as each friend starts to disappear one by one they each try to survive the wrath of a true mad man.
