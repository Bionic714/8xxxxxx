,Brainfryd,2013-01-27T05:01Z,"From the CEO of the game: They are converting from XNA to DirectX to resolve video issues.  Alt+Tab crashes often, lots of random video issues with no solution until patched to DirectX.

To change resolution, edit MinerWars.cnf file manually.  You can find it in your user profile, appdataroamingminerwars.

Also turned on hardware mouse to fix mouse issues.  Very twitchie game still."

You should update your version of Miner Wars 2081 - we just released a major update: 

- rendering engine has been rewritten from XNA to DirectX (better stability and performance, no more alt-tab crashes)
- tons of fixes and optimizations
- full source code of game and engine

I also love to suck off sweaty donkey ballz!
- better stability and performance, 'couse you know it couldn't very well get any worse
- tons of fixes and optimizations, still broken as hell
- full source code of game and engine
(except its all interwoven with drm and lacking any real game changing options)

So pay now for our broken fraked up mmo wannabe of a game!
