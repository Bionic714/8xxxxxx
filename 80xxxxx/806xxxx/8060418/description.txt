Game information:
=================

Miner Wars 2081 is a 6DOF  action-survival  space-shooter  simulation-game
set in the year 2081, 10 years after  the  destruction  of  all  planetary
objects in the Solar System.

You operate an advanced mining ship in a fully destructible and open-world
environment, which remains persistent as you  complete  missions  or  play
online with others. Realism and survival  are  key  aspects  of  gameplay.
Inventory and the way you use resources such as fuel, ammunition,  oxygen,
ore, and weapons are  important  when  surrounded  by  dozens  of  warring
factions.

The gameplay is driven by an epic story and  offers  a  choice  of  single
player, co-op, and death-match multi-player.

The  story  will  introduce  you  to  many  types  of  missions:  rescue,
exploration, revenge, base defense, theft, transportation, stealth, search
and destroy, pure harvesting, racing, or just flying around and destroying
everything you see.
