try this mate it may work actually i do not own this process Xilisoft added a hidden registry key, which won't allow you to add any more keys after the first key gets blocked. So here is a workaround: 1-Start 2-Run 3-Type in Regedit 4-Select HKEY_USERS 5-Press Ctrl + f (Search) 6-Search for {C06F4056-C35F-4bf8-A93A-9F098F3E503D} 7-Delete the Key,including the subkeys Credits to blackboxcard for writing the Instructions.

an anonymous commented forwarded here if it helps all credit goes to blackboxcard :)"

Using the keygen to register, the program doesn't crash during conversion."
