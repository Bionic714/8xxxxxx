Changes in AnyDVD & AnyDVD HD 7.1.4.0, 2013 01 24:
 - New (DVD): Support for new discs
 - New (Blu-ray): Support for new discs
 - Change (Blu-ray & DVD): Time value for removing short video sequences can now be adjusted in 0.5 minute steps 30 seconds seems short enough to keep all interesting extras like small deleted scenes, but long enough to skip all annoying studio logos and still frames 0.5 minutes (30 secs) is now the default setting (was 1 minute)
 - Change (Blu-ray): Made speedmenus more robust
 - Some minor fixes and improvements
 - Updated languages

Please,follow step by step the same instructions that we have provided in our previous torrent for v 7.1.3.0-Final and you should still be ok so.
(don't forget to still do all as online and never forget to uncheck "check update" and rebooting before applying patch anyway)

enjoy and seed,please.
kind regards
