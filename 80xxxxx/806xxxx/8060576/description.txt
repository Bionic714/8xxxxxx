Thanks to the original porter. 

all whiners: Some games may or may not work for you. But really, what did you expect? If you really wanted to play games you should have bought a windows pc..

I'm doing my best in trying to provide games to the mac community. If it doesn't work for you, please write what system you're on, and if it does work for you, state that and please, also now, write what system you're on.

Feel free to request any game you want.

Requirements:

AMD Phenom X4 965
8 GB RAM
nVidia GeForce 9800 GT
Mac OS X 10.6.5
