Each day of their sun-soaked vacation seems to pass with the gentle flow of a refreshing breeze as the carefree trio swims, dines on the terrace, and simply enjoys their time together.

Their casual dinner conversation soon leading to the revelation that Hugo is gay, Frédéric and Hugo subsequently develop a warm friendship despite their drastically different lifestyles. In the days that follow, the deeply personal conversations between longtime monogamist Frédéric and free-thinking Hugo send the once-lazy family vacation into unexpectedly introspective territory as the sexually static father and husband gradually begins to question his longstanding beliefs about human relationships.
