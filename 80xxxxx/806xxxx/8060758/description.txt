EDGE is an exciting new AOR/Melodic Rock band from Karlskoga, Sweden. They started out as a project by 2 friends sharing the same dream. Having played together in different bands off and on since the mid nineties, Jonas Forss and Tobias Andersson (Shadowland, Seven Wishes) knew each other by heart. For fans of Melodic Rock/AOR.
