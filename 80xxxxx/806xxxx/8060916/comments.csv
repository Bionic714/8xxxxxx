I should note that this is for this cane be used to restore any computer ... with that said by all versions i mean 32bit only since its for the Acer W510 "
,sofinsicc,2013-01-26T07:10Z,"A couple things I forgot to mention.. I was told that in order to restore the W510 it had to be a 4gb thumbdrive. However, I used an 8gb and it worked fine. 

In order to boot from the USB, you must first shut down your Tablet (Acer W510). Hold the Volume Down + Power On buttons until it boots to BIOS. 

Create a Supervisor password and then disable secure boot

Now set the boot order to USB first in the list."
