Thanks again."
,dee60,2013-01-28T19:49Z,I apologize. I've already asked that question.
,dee60,2013-01-30T18:45Z,"'The Trouble With Jessie' is actually episode 6 according to the IMDB Jessie blog, tvrage.com, epguides.com, tvguide.com and more. 'Nanny in Miami' was never aired and IMDB calls this episode 6 screwing up the list. 'Say Yes to the Messy Dress' is considered E07 not E08 by many sites. Jessie S02 has 9 episodes not 10 according to the references I quoted above.
Watched this one V=9 A =9, thanks again."
