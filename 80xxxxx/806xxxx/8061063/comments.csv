,kitschnsink,2013-01-24T22:33Z,Hopefully I've done this upload properly this time. I'll try to remove the original one that isn't seeding.
,shar4813,2013-01-25T20:38Z,Is this seeded...
,Cheops75,2013-01-26T07:43Z,Please seed...it has been over a day for a less then 2MB file to be downloaded....
,Cheops75,2013-01-27T17:23Z,"kitschnsink, you obviously have zero idea how to seed. Either you get some help or stop ul altogether. "
,shar4813,2013-01-27T20:02Z,"I would really like this book, so kitschnsink thanks for trying and I hope it will seed."
,jkh73,2013-04-10T16:40Z,Will you be uping the new book?
