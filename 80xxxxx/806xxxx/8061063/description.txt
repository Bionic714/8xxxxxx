Stone Barrington is back in Manhattan and pleased to receive an unexpected visit from his friend and sometime lover Holly Barker, now an assistant director at the CIA. For her part, Holly is glad to leave the staid, official environs of the capital for the dining and atmosphere of New York, but her sojourn isnΓÇÖt only for pleasure. An explosive incident requires her immediate attentionΓÇöand StoneΓÇÖs investigative expertise.

But what initially appears to be a clear-cut case soon becomes increasingly complexΓÇöand dangerous. For in the secretive world of government intelligence, national interests all too often conflict with power grabs and turf wars, and extreme wealth allows even the most pursued rivals to slip through the cracks. As Stone and Holly follow the trail from LondonΓÇÖs posh embassy district to ManhattanΓÇÖs Upper East Side, they learn just how well the most cunning plans can be disguised . . . and how far some people will go to wreak vengeance.
