BritainΓÇÖs Royal Family is always in the public eye, but the legions of loyal helpers who toil in their palaces and castles are rarely seen or heard from. Now, a new film by Montreal documentary maker John Curtin tells some of their stories.  SERVING THE ROYALS: INSIDE THE FIRM, takes us behind the scenes, where 1200 men and women cater to royaltyΓÇÖs every whim. They iron the QueenΓÇÖs bed sheets, polish PhilipΓÇÖs riding boots, squeeze CharlesΓÇÖs toothpaste onto his toothbrush and walk the royal corgis. Privy to the monarchyΓÇÖs most intimate secrets, they are its biggest asset and greatest liability.
