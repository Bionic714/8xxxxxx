The Bee Gees were a musical group founded in 1958. The group's line-up
consisted of brothers Barry, Robin, and Maurice Gibb. The trio were successful
for most of their decades of recording music, but they had two distinct periods
of exceptional success: as a pop act in the late 1960s/early 1970s, and as
prominent performers of the disco music era in the late 1970s.
