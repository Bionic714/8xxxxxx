"Catch Me If You Can"

Jeremy is furious when Klaus tries to control him
by putting Matt's life in danger. Damon coaches
Jeremy as he prepares to take on Klaus' new
vampires, but they find that Kol has beaten them to
it. Kol makes it clear that he will stop at nothing
to convince everyone to give up the search for the
cure. Looking for a new ally, Rebekah reminds
Stefan that they were once close friends. When
Sheriff Forbes and Mayor Hopkins question Shane
about his involvement in the Founders' Council
deaths, Bonnie steps in with questions of her own
and Shane's responses push Bonnie to the edge of
her powers. Elena negotiates with Klaus to keep
Jeremy safe, but when danger suddenly appears from
a totally unexpected enemy, Elena comes up with her
own daring plan for Jeremy. J
