,sarabear1,2013-05-14T03:26Z,Do you know that in America guns take more innocent lives then they save?
,ShoopDogg,2013-05-15T03:08Z,"Dear Sarabear1:
Did you know that in America nobody cares what you think unless you have a citation, and more importantly, if you understand the reasons for the first amendment? 
Please, next time you seek to lecture us on a website used by its constituents to illegally propagate files like this, use an argument instead of an annoying, ""Hey, I'm right and you're wrong"" thing. What I'm trying to say, is you should just download something that you're interested in instead of poking fun at those downloading their interests."
,sw311,2013-05-18T00:12Z,"sarabear1;ShoopDogg - Guns used 2.5 million times a year in self-defense. Law-abiding citizens use guns to defend themselves against criminals as many as 2.5 million times every year [REF1] -- or about 6,850 times a day. This means that each year, firearms are used more than 80 times more often to protect the lives of honest citizens than to take lives. [REF2]
You are 64 times more likely to be killed by your doctor than by someone else wielding a gun. That's because 19,766 of the total 31,940 gun deaths in the USA (in the year 2011) were suicides. So the actual number of deaths from other people shooting you is only 12,174.[REF3]

[REF1] - Gary Kleck and Marc Gertz, ""Armed Resistance to Crime: The Prevalence and Nature of Self-Defense With a Gun,"" The Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology, Northwestern University School of Law, (Fall 1995)
[REF2] - According to the National Safety Council, the total number of gun deaths (by accidents, suicides and homicides) account for less than 30,000 deaths per year. See Injury Facts, published yearly by the National Safety Council, Itasca, Illinois.
