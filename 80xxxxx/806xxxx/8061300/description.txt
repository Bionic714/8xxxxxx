One of the great under-recognized singer/songwriters of the late 1960s/early '70s, Paul Siebel made only two studio albums, and they're both contained here in their entirety (unlike a previous Siebel collection that was missing half of his second album). Siebel matches often-poetic lyricism with a fluid country-rock sound (guests include the Byrds' Clarence White and future Eagle Bernie Leadon), but what really brings it home is his trenchant vocal delivery, a keening Bob Dylan-meets-Bill Monroe high-lonesome wail that cuts straight to the heart of the song.
