Star Wars: Obsession (2007)

Publisher: Dark Horse Comics
Publication Date: July 2007 - December 2007
Country: United States
Language: English 

Notes: 
A mini-series that is directly connected to the main Star Wars: Republic continuity. The issues are collected in the book, Star Wars: Clone Wars, vol. 7. That book is found in the listing for Star Wars (becomes Star Wars: Republic).
This series is noteworthy as an example of LucasBooks better control over its prequel-era Expanded Universe than its post-ROTJ era. Tying into Episode III, the Clone Wars animated series, the already-established Republic story lines, and the Random House novels of the time frame, it stands as an exemplar of cross-media continuity.

Number of issues: 5
