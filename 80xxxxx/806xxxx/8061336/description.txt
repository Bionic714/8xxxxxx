20 years after riots ripped through Los Angeles, "Uprising" documents how
hip hop forecasted -- and some say ignited -- the worst civil unrest of the
20th century. The film revisits the riots in gripping detail and draws from
a diverse collection of voices -- the rappers, rioters, victims, police
officers, journalists and everyday citizens of South Central Los Angeles.
