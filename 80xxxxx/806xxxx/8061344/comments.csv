,asusG75VW,2013-01-25T04:45Z,"Hey Halloweenpsycho,

Is this a genuine permanent Activation?

The reason why I ask this is there there are others that you and I know about and I tried them and it looks legit, but there is a program you may have heard about called Decor8 by Stardock and it mentioned that Only activated Versions of Windows 8 can change the Lockscreen.

But my version was activated by the popular activation; I don't know the name, but all things were activated and it showed it activated. But the Decor8 found a loop hole in pointing out that it was not the case of me being activated for real.

Can you use Decor8 and see if the program will allow you to change the lockscreen?"
,Halloweenpsycho,2013-01-25T05:32Z,"yes this is genuine  activation with genuine microsoft emplyee serial with a mass amount of activations. So give it a shot, and let  me know what ya think :)"
,Halloweenpsycho,2013-01-25T05:35Z,"Please Note: I forgot to add this is only a 64 bit version retail. I am working on getting a 32 bit retail. So please take caution in downloading if you have a 32 bit system this copy will not work for you, you will need to find a 32 bit copy. Again..This is a 64 Bit version ONLY..."
,Halloweenpsycho,2013-01-25T09:34Z,"it seems the extra add on for windows media center serial has gone bust. So for all those..the initial activation works great..As for the add ons. That is simple. Go to http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/feature-packs
There you can have a free upgrade key emailed to your created email of choice..teehee.. You may need to activate your free upgrade key by phone as something is up with internet activation of this free upgrade key..so to do this go to the bottom left where your start orb would normally be, when u see start pop up right click it, from the menu select command prompt Admin, and copy this command and paste it into Command Prompt.
                  SLUI 4
Then press enter, after this a screen will pop up for you allowing you to select your country, simply call the number from your country selection give them the long 9 column numbers and presto you will receive the info to activate your permanent Windows Pro 8 with Wmc :) Then I would suggest downloading Advanced token manager and make a back up of your installation, so you wont have to go through the hassle again :) Anyway..As always..Enjoy :)"
,Hugh_Hef,2013-01-25T09:43Z,"Wish someone would comment who has had success with this up and let everyone know the serials are working.

,FireIsHot,2013-01-26T09:21Z,"Hey thanks, but the key doesn't work anymore. Also can you tell me if there''s any updates I shouldn't install?

Because around the 8th or 11th I installed some updates: KB2757638 - KB2778930 - KB2785220 -KB2785094 

And after a restart it kept forcing me into a temporary profile, after a couple of times, it actually erased all my pictures and documents (which I managed to get 95% back)

Finally I had to do a format/fresh install, and now I'm scared to install those above and any other new updates (Security and Specific Win 8 x64 Updates) The net frame work and such are fine.

Running the Pro 9200 build x64 bit version.

Thanks!"

,Lanyus,2013-01-27T00:35Z,"@Halloweenpsycho, Hey mate, I thinking about doing a clean OS install on my laptop and trying Win8 (have 7 currently).
This seems to be the best upload on tpb so Im going with it. 
Im not a noob, never had issues with games nor program installing/burning/cracking/w.e.
Quick question:
1- I read someone say you should use your official email to register ans use on windows 8 (I think its called Microsoft ID now or something like that).
Do you recommend doing that? Or just use some other email without your real personal information? 

I'll dl this and seed when finished, planing on doing the installation next monday, 
Will post results.
Thanks in advance (: "
,Halloweenpsycho,2013-01-27T02:02Z,"@Lanyus
Honestly it doesn't matter for real or just a quick fake info email just to get te code. Either will do :) It's a free upgrade code:) so no worries on getting bitched at by anyone for anything illegal..:) Hope you like it..take care"
,Mico280,2013-01-27T04:18Z,"
@jazzyle either mount it with a mounting program or extract it with winrar. Im assuming its an iso file"
,Halloweenpsycho,2013-01-27T04:30Z,"@jazzyle
Well if you are just wanting to upgrade using it through windows desktop and not a fresh install then just use winrar or 7zip and extract it, and run setup. Other than that if you want a fresh install, i suggest downloading power iso, you can get full version here in the community..Then simply burn it to a dvd, and then make sure when you reset your pc that you set your boot priority to boot from dvd and your hard disk as second boot. Simplest way..Hope that helps :)"
,Lal0JR,2013-01-27T05:28Z,@Halloweenpsycho Just wanna say Thanks!!! worked like a charm! your key worked..i did the activation thru phone. haha your awesome thank you again! keep up the great torrents!! waiting on the 32 bit now :) tested on (1-26-2013)

,Halloweenpsycho,2013-01-28T08:02Z,"I have confirmed the key i provided to still be good it has just been massively used and all online activation has been disabled for the key but the good news is you can still activate by phone.
Once you install and get ready to activate like normal, Go to bottom right and once start pops up right click and select Command Prompt Admin
Simply Copy this Command and paste it into your command prompt SLUI 4
This will give a window to slect your country and correct phone number for your country..then just follow instructions when u call..After you have completed online activation be sure to download Windows Token Manager 3.5 r3 and be sure you back up this installation, and save the created folder some were you will not lose it. I suggest creating two new folders one saying windows activation backup
and the other WIndows ""Wmc"" Backup
After you have backed up your initial installation follow instructions below to get wmc for your install

,Halloweenpsycho,2013-01-29T06:00Z,"OK to make the copy bootable. I have already made the iso bootable, all you will need to do is to burn the iso image.
1: Download Power iso, you can get full version here    https://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8071057/Power_Iso_5.5___Serials_
2: install use key activate..
3: Open power iso go to top right and select burn
4:Say for instance you put the iso on your desktop, were it says image file in power iso, the little drop down button menu straight across you press button select desktop and select the Iso.
5: Put a Blank disc in your dvd burner, make sure yo have the coreect drive with the blank disc selected.
6: Press the burn button and wait until process is done, and Dvd opens the tray.
7. Now all you need to do is restart pc, you willl need to press F2, Delete, basiclly what ever button it says to enter setup, press it.
8. Select boot options, and be sure to select your Dvd drive with the disc you just burnt as you first boot priority, and your hard drive as second.
9: Press F10 to save configuration, Note: if the F10 does nothing make sure your keyboard doesn't have a button called F-lock if so press it and retry F10 should work now.
10: After the save simply reboot, you will see a screen that says press any button to boot from Dvd, just press enter is fine, it will then load windows 8 install and your on ur way.


Hope this helps

C:WindowsSystem32slmgr409
Which is nothing more than a config file for the pc, i don't know what your using, but i sure don't see any other user accounts other than the admin. So maybe your application is screwing with you.So as for saying i made a hidden account in some attempt to get info. I don't appreciate the allegations. I earned my trusted skull beside my name because the apps and programs i upload are quality, and not laced with crap. rust me, you don't earn that trusted reputation by lacing your files..So just this..if you don't trust this file, then go download someone Else's windows 8 pro. Don't try the blame game, or try to make me look bad cause it isn't going to work. If you really feel this way, then why cry about it on here.. go to the chat, and chat with a admin, and tell them about it.  I have nothing more to say..

As for the others i am really sorry your having issues getting your windows 8 to activate. The serial number i provided in the read me file i have double checked it, and it is still activation by phone. I have done 3 pc's this morning with the same serial, and it worked fine with phone activation, as well as the other serial i added..That was the last one i tried and it activated fine by phone as well..The program to activate Windows is also good to go as well, as i have checked it myself and had no issue with it. So i don't really know what else to do, i have given several options, and my methods have been multiply confirmed to work by several others. Maybe it is just bad luck.:( Anyway i hope that you can get it activated. Best of luck and best wishes."

,GoMade,2013-01-29T22:25Z,"It seems that people are having a real issue activating this torrent and there has been some explanations from the original poster but they are consistently vague.

Product keys are different for upgrade versions versus clean install. Halloweenpsycho has said that he has installed and activated this torrent 3 times this morning but failed to explain how exactly he installed the windows 8 operating system. 

@Halloweenpsycho:

Did you install as an upgrade from windows or any other operating systems? Did it work? What key did you use? I know that you can do this from your desktop by mounting the ISO and running the setup, but, is the product key going to work and activate considering that this method requires a product key for upgrade platforms? 

Did you install this from a formatted hard disk? A clean install? Did it work? If it worked then people trying to upgrade from windows 7 will not be able to use the product key because obviously that product key is for clean install/full install and not the upgrade. 

Also- it seems that people are trying to activate this online and it is failing. After they have failed they try to use the phone activation method and it fails as well. So am I to assume that if you try to activate this online and it fails, trying to activate it over the phone AFTERWARDS is going to fail as well? IN other words do NOT try to activate this online and go STRAIGHT to the phone activation?  Is that right? Because you are not explaining that or any of this clearly even though you think you might be. 

I am trying to install this on my computer that already has a bought and paid for windows 7 home premium activated OS on it. It's a laptop. If I install your torrent on this machine and I can't activate it then I am screwed. I have to reformat my system and lose everything. I do not want to lose anything and I am not interested in a clean install of windows 8. 

I need to know that the product key is going to work for UPGRADING from windows 7 only. Not a clean install. 

Thanks"
,GoMade,2013-01-29T22:33Z," ""Halloweenpsycho at 2013-01-29 22:10 CET:
product id is the 9 column string of numbers that you will see.""

No it isn't. 

To find the product ID you need to go to the control panel and select 'system.'  Or hold the windows key and press the pause/break key and then look for the product ID at the bottom. It is a number with the letters OEM in it. "

,Halloweenpsycho,2013-01-30T00:29Z,"@GoMade
i don't know how much clearer i could be..In my read me file included and the topics i posted after the key for online activation was used up from its 25,000 uses..So i explained to use the phone activation, gave a detailed explanation of how to do this, how to add other keys of needed..etc..i also said.clean install..never once did i mention upgrade. So even though you seem to think your reading things that make no sense then read them again, all info is there..Simple..the key provided had 25,000 online activation uses..they have been used up as i said in previous posts. So that means you have to use a telephone activation in which the key provided still works for phone activation mentioned in previous posts..You will need to use a clean install, which i explained in previous posts. As far as i know you can not use this to upgrade. So..in order..Read my , Read before install file included in the download, the only difference is instead of activating online, you will need to use the phone activation, to do this read my previous posts, and it explains how to do this. Thats it..simple..After activation just google windows 8 wmc upgrade. It will take you to a microsoft site were you provide your email or just make a fake one just to get the activation code. then delete the email after..Simply go to activate and add new features.. Again this may or may not work online, so if you get a error or it doesn't work online then do it by phone, as explained. This is a free and permanent activation for windows 8 pro 32 and 64 bit. The offer is only good till jan 31st so hurry..Fresh install only as far as i know... I did not try for a upgrade, it may or may not allow for a upgrade..i am unsure..if anyone try's it and has success please post..As for those worried about there windows 7 being lost you can go here http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8058081/Windows_7_Sp1_Halloween_Edition_%5BAll_32_and_64_bit_versions%5D
This includes all editions from starter clear to ultimate 32 and 64 bit, as well as permanent activator, couldn't be any easier...SO there is the explanation that i was sure i made simple..But i figured maybe some were still having issues, when all it takes is to read the post..good luck all..and thanks for choosing Halloweenpsycho uploads :)"

So lemme get this str8. After installing & activating this version using phone (or net) it'll stay activated forever even if all the windows updates are installed afterwards? I ask this because all torrents I've downloaded previously get deactivated once a specific bunch of windows updates get installed.Can this version stay activated forever without getting deactivated after installing those updates?

Also no recurring activations after a period of days, just a one time activation & that's it? Activated forever?? Btw this is 64bit right?

,darkbackground,2013-01-30T11:33Z,"@WILD4LIFE 

Microsoft will probably release a update in the future that will check the genuine of the key, probably through a windows defender update, so beware of those. Microsoft has said that they will fight piracy harder on windows 8. 

If you want to have it genuine from now on, be safe and dont download any updates, but i think its safe for now. By the time they will release a genuine check we will probably know the name of the update and skip it or there will be a new windows loader/crack until then.

correct me if im wrong Halloweenpsycho, also, will you remove this torrent after today? "
,Halloweenpsycho,2013-01-30T20:46Z,"@lordvirus
Like dude..the folder your looking for is located at

,Halloweenpsycho,2013-01-30T20:51Z,"as for the key being deactivated. For one the key that everyone used was genuine microsoft employee key with 25,000 uses, secondly..if everyone updated to WIndows 8 pro Wmc which i am sure everyone did, that is also a genuine key provided from microsoft.

Activate the Wmc code over the phone. If you entered the code and tried to activate it online and it tells you it can't activate it, that is fine. That is what it is supposed to do. 

Go to your command prompt (admin) enter SLUI 4 and select your country then call the number and give the automated teller your block group codes provided. 

It works. And this works for upgrading from windows 7 while keeping all system settings.

I did have problems also... but the reason is because the serial I entered to START the installation didnt work so I used some other key... 

If this is what you did too... Then you need to change the product key to once again use the keys that came with download... 

1. To change the product key...

A. Go to Search (by hovering mouse in right corner of screen)
B. search for ""command prompt""
C. type in... ""slui 3"" 
D. you will get pop up window that asks for NEW product key... enter the key that comes with download!
E. It will say ""key has been blocked""... THATS OK! Its only been blocked for online activation!
F. Go back to command prompt and now type... ""slui 4""
G. You will get pop up window, choose your country and call that phone and follow instructions!

3# goes with 2 the system may not have the supported hardware needed to run windows 8. or #4 It is possible that the iso file that you burned could be corrupt, maybe try burning it at a slower x rate. I will keep a look for issues arising with windows 8 and try to keep everyone informed of a fix.."

Burned the ISO into a blank DVD, performed a clean Install formatting my Primary partition and keeping all my media on the 2nd one (:
(So you don't have to backup 350+ GB in movies into an external HDD xD always recommended though)

The original key worked just fine. 
Installation went smooth, Installed a few drivers for my ASUS laptop, even though windows made every Fn key work by default.

I skipped the WMC update, never used it on 7, don't really need it. 

On WIN8:
Fast and smooth. You can just use your desktop and ignore metro interface altogether, which I thought I'd do, but it isn't that bad really, Its like a cool shortcuts menu. 

http://bloodxdisposable.tumblr.com/image/42073915329
(Thats how I use it)

UNINSTALLED all the apps though, just kept the weather one.
Only thing I didn't really like is the personalize menu, you cant change default fonts and background color in themes anymore...

Unless you know how to mess with the registry, which I do (:

I changed the ugly default font.
(I created a .REG file that everyone can use, I can share it if you want with instructions on how to pic the font you which tio use, 3min process)

Everything on this torrent worked as expected, for the ones who couldn't figure it out, either you are a noob or had just really bad luck :/

The community is here to help though.

(Sorry for late feedback) 
And thank you Halloweenpsycho (:"

:PLEASE NOTE: The Wmc upgrade serial that was provided in the original Upload is no longer valid, or useable. 
:PLEASE NOTE: That if you try via internet or via phone to use this wmc serial it will deactivate your windows and may have cause for a 
fresh reinstallation of windows 8.

:PLEASE NOTE: Those who have asked how or if they can change the account user pic or if they may delete any of my stuff once installed.
A:#1= Yes you can change the picture it was just put there as default to give a change to the default user pic, as i found it boring and that suited my name :)
A:#2= Yes anything of mine you want to delete, be my guest it will not alter Windows 8 in anyway as Windows was not altered, the only alteration that was made
was to the 64 bit version of my upload which was the choice to bypass the initial serial to simply install windows, for 32 users i simply forgot to take
that action, as i was in a rush for community delivery for all to enjoy :)

Please also be aware  i will be removing the Windows 8 activator as i need some time to refine it and fix the bugs..I apologize for any inconvenience. But i would rather give you quality, rather than a quick through together.. "

,Halloweenpsycho,2013-02-03T11:38Z,"I have noticed on my torrents that people are leaving comments about kms activation. Not that i mind, i welcome all comments :) but something people should be aware of.
the way a kms works is
KMS Activation Renewal

KMS activations are valid for 180 days—the activation validity interval. To remain activated, KMS client computers must renew their activation by connecting to the KMS host at least once every 180 days. By default, KMS client computers attempt to renew their activation every seven days. If KMS activation fails , the client will retry every two hours. After a client computer’s activation is renewed, the activation validity interval begins again.

I could go into extreme detail of the ups and downs with the kms activation system, but i figure no real reason too..One thing i will say is that with the kms just be aware that you only receive 1 rearm and in most cases none at all, with the method i provided you have 1,000 rearms. Truth is genuine is the best ofcourse. But everyone likes to do it there own way. Now the kms operation could be manipulated to represent a infinit amount of elapse time, but rewriting a kms server can be very strenuous and touchy. But all in all to each there own. :) Just a small heads up on what a kms activation does."
,Halloweenpsycho,2013-02-03T11:49Z,"@deathCHEF
it is plenty small enough to fit to a dvd as the iso is only 4.37 gbs and a dvd is 4.7 gbs. here do this.
get a copy of power iso you can either get the full version here on the TPB or you can just download a free trial of it. Then just install it, then afterwords open it up. Then select burn, i already made the iso bootable so no worries there..Simply point the to the correct location on your computer to were you have the iso and select it, make sure you have a dvd in and just click burn. Now after you do that..reboot your pc..then normal default is either f2 or delete to get into bios. Once into bios go to boot optionsand select your dvd drive as number 1 and your hadr drive as number 2. then press f10 and save..then it will reboot and now you will see a screen that says press any key to boot from dvd.just press a key and proceed with install. after the installation makes a reboot don't hit the key to boot from dvd, just let it boot normal, and the installation will continue. after it is all done you can then go back to bios and switch your boot options back to normal. Then once in windows 8 to activate just follow the instructions i have written on here which you should see above in detail..and that is it :)"

 I installed by phone method (worked just fine).I had problem in updating the apps after tweaking.

For those who is having a problem in updating/ downloading new apps solution mentioned above didnt work for them, this worked for me.

Try this FixIT

http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/microsoftaccounts.diagcab

N.B: download this tiny program it will check your windows for compatibility issue, it will not solve them you have to solve by your self, you can run it couple of times, all issues may not necessary to be resolved.


Then, try disabling the Windows Update service.

Press Win + R
Type services.msc /s
Look for Windows Update service and Double click on it and in the Startup type box select Disabled. Click Apply and OK.



Go to the Windows folder and rename the ""SoftwareDistribution"" folder to ""OldSoftwareDistribution""

N.B. if you have problem in renaming the folder and have a dual boot windows you can rename it from other one.

Now try enabling the Windows Update service in Windows services

,DeadSOLz,2013-02-06T18:18Z,"Yes, I've been following the instructions you posted above. It still doesn't work because it keeps freezing. I am at a complete loss as to what to do."
,DeadSOLz,2013-02-06T18:39Z,Also; is it supposed to give an error after entering the first script? I'm talking about the script containing the product hey. It gives me an error after entering the first and second scripts.

I've got an activated Windows BUT it still freezes randomly when I'm connected to the internet. I have installed nothing yet!!!!
I'm going to install Dell Inspiron drivers and see if that helps the issue or not. Ugh. I hate these freezes!!!"
,JH2Hobbzy,2013-02-06T20:46Z,"Ive been running windows 7 and i went through and updated drivers and removed the software and programs that the initial scan advised me to. only when my computer did its final restart did any problems happen, I did a diagnostic through the command prompt and it gave me a failure while setup is in progress message. so it sounds like windows 8 just didnt install properly and i should do a system restore but then it will not allow me to for some reason."
,greedybaztard,2013-02-06T21:43Z,"so i did the install... went sorta smooth.. got the welcome screen did all the inital stuff.. then, no live times.. just a blank desktop.. cant do anything says im not authorized as an administrator. someone help please!"
,greedybaztard,2013-02-06T22:02Z,"phone activation worked and everything i just dont have admin control and its frustrating... i cant see anything on my desktop and the only way i can access a program is by running through the task manager... cant see the start button, or live tiles, or anything"

,djari3,2013-02-07T03:10Z,"guys i found a way!!! instead of putting this code (PKQ6T-N8GMC-VXYX4-HWMTH-8HRDP
)  when using the command prompt thing use this

slmgr.vbs -ipk XKY4K-2NRWR-8F6P2-448RF-CRYQH  

now after that do the other step but dont activate by the phone... instead try to use another serial code and put the original one (PKQ6T-N8GMC-VXYX4-HWMTH-8HRDP) and it should work... i fugure this out myself.. it would still say that is not activated but it would be so you can add the other code on the notepad to add the extra features and change the scary pic... enjoy!!!"

,vikrant47,2013-02-07T11:54Z,"hi, i installed and everything works fine. but i have a question, there is a feature in windows 8,it ask us to ""trust this pc"". should i do that? "
,Halloweenpsycho,2013-02-07T12:17Z,"@vikrant47 
Which feature is that?"
,DeadSOLz,2013-02-07T13:53Z,"Halloweenpsycho, you've completely ignored me! :( Well, anyway, let me add something:

The installation and process works perfectly. It is very easy to do and the instructions need to be followed perfectly.

The PROBLEM is not with the torrent, it's with Windows 8. Apparently, hundreds (if not thousands) of people have the same freezing issue. I think it's related to the wireless drivers on some laptops (I can confirm that it is a big issue on my Dell Inspiron 15R N5110). I think the wireless drivers that Windows 8 installs cause an issue where the entire Windows freezes and a hard reset is needed. I didn't try replacing the drivers because I wanted a stable Windows so I gave my Windows 8 up.

But, besides that, the torrent is perfect and the license key is legit! People, if you are having problems, follow the instructions on the previous page! Follow them EXACTLY! Thanks, Halloweenpsycho! :)"
,Halloweenpsycho,2013-02-07T14:25Z,"@DeadSOLz
I sincerely apologize for my lack of reply, i assure you i would never try to ignore a person in need of help..Your accounts of the freezing issues encountered in windows 8 is correct.. Eventually there may be a fix for it, but at this time it seems a loss. 
I really hope that all goes well for you, and if you are a trusty windows 7 user you can always try my windows 7 all editions upload.

SO when you install and boot up your pc will automatically detect your manufactured board, and display the correct backgrounds and pc information for your computer make and model, as well as the manufacture contact info ,such as Phone number and website..I am really sorry to hear that 8 hasn't worked out for ya. But thanks for the replies, and i wish you the best of luck.. "
,Halloweenpsycho,2013-02-07T14:58Z,"@vikrant47
If it is asking you to trust pc after install for some reason. you can feel confident in doing so. As no files after installation have been changed..it is retail all the way.. Only files i changed in this version was my background for your install, the pc account pics which can easily be changed to waht ever you preffer. And the initial installation serial by pass..ALl other files are in tact and un altered :) "

,Halloweenpsycho,2013-02-07T19:05Z,"@greedybaztard
No that sounds great for hardware specs and shouldn't have a issue..i am using a sabertooth z77 asus 32gb corsair vengeance 1866, ram etc..I had issues to with this board, i had to update the bios in order for it to function properly. You can try updating the bios, and see if that helps..You also described upon reboot it goes into setup..i am assuming you mean windows 8 setup. I am sure you have done this, but be sure that your windows 8 disc is not in the drive first..try running safe mode, with the net enabled.Normally to get into safe mode with asus you will wait till the asus screen disappears is when you immediately want to start hitting f8 and continue pressing it till the safe mode screen pops up. Note: some asus boards will also use f8 as a boot option as well..if yours does..then just wait till asus disappears and wait like a sec then hit f8. `Reading further on your board it seems the freezing is a common known issue with this board, and as i said updating bios says it should fix this issue according to asus.If you manage to get into safe mode go to command prompt run it as admin, and  copy and  paste this command   net user administrator /active:yes this will enable a new administration account in edition to your account, so at logon you will see the admin account, use this to do anything needed to disable the admin and go back to just your account simply reverse the yes with a no. Now if you still can't get into anything by doing this, i would suggest using the safe mode to number 1: update bios which i wi have provided the exact url for your bios to your board. http://www.asus.com/Motherboard/M5A97_LE_R20/#support_Download_36
DOwnload it.. use it to update bios..then after wards you run Driver genius which you can get here.. http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7941150/Driver_Genius_12.0.0.1211_Full_Precracked_Activated%5BA4%5D
This is full version and updateable data base..RUn this to update all your drivers.. OOnce you have done all this.. then give everything a shot as normal..Please let me know if this helps you..I am crossing my fingers for ya..So give me a update on the progress.."

,goast32,2013-02-10T02:45Z,"Ok everyone, I have found a solid workaround.

Regardless of what others say, download this:

http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7789752/Windows.8.Activator.K.J.v1.11_Tam.exe

**********
Steps:

1. Turn Off/Unplug Internets

2.Click English at the top

3. Click ""Windows 8 + Server 2012""

4. Click ""Install Pirate Activation""

5. Profit!

**********

My Windows 8 is now permanently activated, I even tried doing windows updates and it worked fine. You wont be able to upgrade to windows media center however. If some one else releases some more keys that will work you can always reverse this activation by selecting ""Remove Pirate Activation""

Hope this helps."

,Rush,2013-02-10T23:06Z,"@davhaa 

 Change the boot priority of your DVD drive/USB stick, which can be done in the BIOS

When given the option, select a Custom install (not Upgrade). On the next screen you’ll be shown a bunch of partitions/volumes. Select the one that’s labeled Windows 8 (or whatever you called it). 

Be ABSOLUTELY certain that you’ve selected the right volume, then click Next.

 If you select the wrong drive Win 7 gets formatted

The Windows 8 installer will now do its thing. It will reboot once or twice, but eventually you’ll be greeted with a multi-boot menu that allows you to select which OS you want to load (Windows 8, Windows 7, or any other OSes that’re installed). Windows 8 will load by default after a few seconds, but you can change it back to Windows 7 by clicking “Change defaults or choose other options” at the bottom of the screen. 

 You now have a PC that dual-boots Windows 8 and Windows 7."

,Halloweenpsycho,2013-02-11T04:53Z,"@All Downloaders..
First before you even download and waste your time, please make sure your pc is compatible with windows 8, that you meet the requirements, with your Motherboard etc..Please note you may also need to Update Bios to correct issues blocking the installation of windows 8 or errors occurred with in the installation process. Before you Update Bios..I can't stress this enough..Besure your system is even capable of running windows 8, as at some points it is slim, but updating your bios with out being at least slightly knowledgeable of the procedures can result in a bricked system and you having to flash your bios to a earlier version..If you have no clue what the above means..then i would suggest sticking with your current operating system.
PLEASE NOTE THAT THE FOLLOWING SERIAL HAS BEEN BLOCKED!!!
PKQ6T-N8GMC-VXYX4-HWMTH-8HRDP
Below you will find a new key provided and a detailed instruction as how to activate.
PLEASE ALSO NOTE: DO NOT..I repeat DO NOT!!!
Talk to a customer service rep.. This is a quicker way to get the serials blocked, and the live customer service will have info on the key the automated system does not.. AGAIN DO NOT TALK TO CUSTOMER SERVICE REP..The keys provided are Genuine, but have exceeded online activation thus phone activation comes into play.. I am sorry for all the caps but this is crucial. Just follow the steps below 1 by 1 use the automated service as instructed. LAST NOTE: you CAN NOT!! use the Windows media center Serial provided in this download any longer, You will need to either find a patch for the WMC or a genuine serial which is out there with a little searching and patients.
The windows media center serial is also referred to as Upgrade features. SO please.. Follow instructions closely and i promise all will go well, if you deviate from instructions all may not go as expected. If you are new to the community please do not hesitate to ask before you do something you do not understand. One of us will be around to help, although it may not be 5 minutes after you ask the question it will get answered. There are some very knowledgeable peeps here. I am currently very busy with other projects, so i will be away for a while as i explain at the bottom of the page. But i will check back periodically and please be assured if i am unable to answer a question you have there are some very good people that will help you out. Also for those that have said this doesn't work, or it's fake etc...Look at all the people that have verified it as working, SO for those that assume it doesn't work..Just ask for help..It works..Trust me... I wish you the best.. I will update this post on new pages to come..Thanks for all of you that take the time to help out those less knowledgeable in the pc world. And thanks to all your support by choosing Halloweenpsycho Torrents..Take care..  
New key tested 2/10/2013 working

Ok for the time being this is all i can offer the serial you need to use to activate is 6CNK2-RTVRV-TXYQK-86DBM-B4DHC
Do not and i repeat DO NOT use the extra features serial for wmc..You should be able to use above serial to activate via internet as i have had it reset. It is possible that the uses may have been surpassed..if you receive a error first check to see if windows is activated as it is possible it may just have had a error.and still activated..if it is not activated you will need to do the following as this works fine...Please be sure TO NOT USE FEATURES UPGRADE WMC SERIAL..It will deactivate your system..

I've done everything exactly as it was said in the directions, except call the US number listed.

I'm also not asked any of the questions (like if I'm a home or business user or which number computer is this), it just basically says ""welcome to hell, start punching in those numbers"". What do I do now? :"

you can not use this ISO file with that tool, you have to convert this iso file to UDF format. you can do that by following steps:

1. Open the ISO using PowerISO
2. Then go to the file-> Image Properties
3. on Image Properties, click on the ""UDF"" checkbox.
4. Now save the ISO file
5. Again open the DVD USB tool and now you can create you bootable DVD or bootable pendrive easily"

Yeah the wmc serial is a no go atm..to change it back to normal pro..you can try the above instructions and see if that will allow you to revert, if it does not allow you to revert then you may need to re install, and use the instructions with the serial above..hope this helps. In the future i would recommend that you use a back up activation program which you can download from this link

Thanks to josh cell software
Just activate your windows and once activated make a backup of the activation, and be sure to save it some were safe were it wont be deleted, as for in the future if you would need to reinstall windows 8 for some reason you will not need to go through the activation hassle, just simply use the Advanced tokens manager to re activate :)"

I think there may be a kms activator for wmc as well, but i am unsure of that..i am working still on a  permanent activation program, so as soon as i am able to complete it, you will be able to activate pro and wmc permanent.

I am very sorry for the slow reply..
Here is the best way to explain this process.
Download Power iso. Either free version or from out TPb community full version. Once you have it, you are now ready to make a back up disc.
Simply use your dvd burner. Just open power iso and select burn, and then point the source folder to were ever you may have downloaded the iso too..Example..C:usersYournamedownloads.
Then once you have the iso selected just be sure you have a blank dvd in and then select destination would be your dvd burner. Then just click burn. Once you are done. Your disc is ready. Now restart your pc.. upon restart your black screen will appear saying something like F2 or delete to enter bios. Simply Press the button needed usually F2 or delete to enter bios.Once you get into bios, select boot options, then you will select your dvd drvie as your first boot, and your hard drive as second boot.. Press F10 and save, now once it reboots a new screen will be seen saying press any key to boot from dvd. Just press a button and your into the windows 8 disc.. From there select what ever it is you need to do. Once your done simply go back to the bios and reset your boot priority to 1st Hard drive and second Dvd rom. F10 and save.. Now all will boot fine..If you need help passed this point please let me.. know.."

,Halloweenpsycho,2013-02-16T16:08Z,"for those seeming to have issues activating, i just want to provide information as to the validity of the current posted working key.
Product Key	: CQ7YK-YQNWC-KDJPF-2XB2P-KWXT7
Profile		: NT 6.2
Validity	: Valid
Product ID	: 00178-
Advanced ID	: XXXXX-01781-109-439185-00-
Activation ID	: 9c44-90a865f22e76
Edition Type	: Professional
Description	: Win 8 Professional Retail
Edition ID	: res-v1781
Key Type	: Retail
EULA		: Retail
Crypto ID	: 1781

Pleas note: that some of the information from the above description i have removed for obvious reason :)
Which means this is a retail key that is currently valid and has not been blocked, i don't want to keep providing new serials when i have checked current ones and confirmed them to be valid. As well being confirmed by others to be currently activating as normal.
So for the keys i have that i may later provide the community with once the key shows {Blocked}. I promise i am keeping a close eye on the keys and i will know the moment they are blocked, as i check them every two to three hours.
I hope that you understand why i am reluctant to provide a new serial, as if i provide a new serial when the others are still functioning, we all run the risk of those key's being {Blocked} and i would like to keep this torrent available to the community as long as i possibly can.
I apologize to those having issues, but if you continue to have issues, number 1..The keys i provide will only work with my torrents or a valid retail copy of windows 8 pro, and some Vl Copies. So you may want to use a Kms activator as much as i am not a fan of Kms activation, it will at least allow you to be activated for 180 days. Don't be discouraged how ever. I am working still on a permanent activator for windows 8.. I am close..Until then I suggest using the serials provided. or a kms :( ..
Please keep me current on your successful or non successful activations.. Thanks in advance..    "

I have tried both booting this from USB and a DVD and it is now working at all.  I have burned from 2x to 12x and verified using PowerISO and i checked UDF in the properties and burned it... still doesnt work.

So then I made the a bootable USB and the same thing happens, it does not work.

Just remember to be able to use the windows 7 usb/dvd tool to make the image you will need to use power iso and load the image and the select udf under image settings and then save the file as a iso which it should already be once your done.

,IgorekPhD,2013-02-18T16:45Z,"Instructions for dummies:

1. Use CQ7YK-YQNWC-KDJPF-2XB2P-KWXT7 to register Windows 8 Pro over the phone. DO NOT do it over internet. You must disable it and choose the phone activation method.

2. Call the UK number with Skype (free phone call) to get the activation numbers.

3. Enable internet and click on activate. Your windows is now fully and officially activated.

4. For Windows Media Center - click on Add Features from Control Panel -> System

5. Use key HQTY6-GPTG3-4YNXW-FFCQC-JB2M3

6. Go to command prompt (hold windows key + R) and type slui 4. That will bring up phone activation screen similar to the one in step 1.

7. Repeat Steps 2 and 3.

8. Congradulations, now you have Windows 8 Pro with WMC

Everything was tested twice yesterday.

P.S. You don't need any halloweenpsycho activator. Do it manually."

Does the manual way for phone activation still work? Answer being, yes..Thanks to the last two chaps for confirming that the activation method described in detail is still working as strong as ever.. So please only use the activator as a last resort in activating your windows 8. As the above described method is to make your windows genuine, and also allow for full activation of Both pro and wmc..

,Simon1557,2013-02-18T23:38Z,"Anyone else having trouble installing this in UEFI mode?

I've been using the leaked RTM version since October but today when I interrupted disk checking the computer got fucked. When I boot it I'll get a black screen but the files are still accessible. 

I decided to re-install everything, so far I've downloaded the .iso and burned it to a DVD disc but when I boot into my UEFI BIOS I can't find a way to boot the DVD with UEFI. Normally you should see an icon saying UEFI but it's not visible for me which means if I launch it from there I boot it with legacy mode. If I choose ""launch EFI shell from filesystem device"" I get a ""no found"" error message. I've read about it and someone said you need a file called shellx64.efi on your installation DVD but re-burning is not an option anymore cause I'm out of discs and I've got no USB drive either. What should I do?

The only thing I can think of is that you have modified the .iso file which means my motherboard (Asus P8P67) don't wanna launch it with UEFI cause of secure boot? However there is no option to either enable or disable it so I'm not sure if my motherboard supports it but what else could prevent me from booting with UEFI? I know it worked before so why shouldn't it work now? Maybe I should try formatting the SSD which I have my corrupted Windows 8 installation on?"

,Simon1557,2013-02-19T10:11Z,I've got it working now. by installing retail Windows 8.
,skull007,2013-02-19T10:23Z,@Halloweenpsycho it says the key CQ7YK-YQNWC-KDJPF-2XB2P-KWXT7 is already been used when trying to do phone activation.
[V],murphy78,2013-02-19T10:47Z,"WMC upgrade keys won't work. They are tied to the first computer that activates them from a previously activated retail system.  You could do a data.dat swap and phone method if a key is legit and unused, but that's it.

There is, however, the occasional Volume-MAK key which has x amount of activations.  If this guy posted one, you should seriously think about saving any successful activation with advanced tokens manager."
,MyDoors,2013-02-19T13:12Z, Simon1557  You must turn off this UEFI mode in the bios  this the  I have my Hp h9-1350 you don't use the SSD just your new format drive.. I don't what brand you have hope this helps you...

I downloaded the file, installed it correctly but the activation code is not working.

1) Not sure if there are different codes if you install from 0 vs. updating (I updated)

2) Can this be done via internet or it is a must to do it via phone, as I read in othe comments?

Thanks!"

,Halloweenpsycho,2013-02-24T03:26Z,"Ok to all those providing support of my torrents i want to thank all of you. I will be taking a short break for a little while as i am writing some new programs, and correcting some more issues in the activator. I am in the process of a pre activated install of windows 8 32 and 64 bit. I am in hopes i will be able to complete it. As i said i work alone so it will take some time..But i wont be totally gone, i will check in from time to time..As there is a lot of people using my torrents that have added  lot of help in the activation process to get all of you up and going..For all of you i thank you very much for this. I am sure that any questions that may arise will be met with some talented people and testimonies that will guide you in the path of a successful activation. Also i want you all to know that i am not trying to throw a wrench or talk bout about kms, as it is a process that can help you activate. But just understand that 1 it will allow you 180 days of activation meaning it isn't permanent, and as for the emulated versions being offered, you need to understand that emulation is and has been a making in the works for many years.. Easy for beginners, just take a check Mame emulation for example, from some real superior professionals in the emulation field. I mean Emulation is not a 100% accurate, as a lot of methods are not. Future updates in windows 8 will be exploiting the emulation process of Kms emulation and making it more difficult as will many efforts to the activation of windows 8. Windows 8 in essence is not that great of a upgrade from windows 7, in which i prefer to windows 8 any day. But i have taken the time to familiarize myself with in order to be able to offer help needed in this new system. But people always like new things, and the latest technology, in which you will find the touch screen to be a step up in technology with windows 8 and that's really about it. Still that doesn't mean that we will just ignore it, as there are a lot of people wanting to use this software. So myself and others will always be working on ways around activation's in the attempt to offer a emulated genuine copy of windows 8 threw Activation flaw's. Except in the torrents i have provided these are genuine and permanent which allow for updates, and full use..So to all of us working to crack the case I say good luck.. I will be working in a effort to help further this software in the piracy community, Thanks for all your support. I will return.. "

I didn't use your download, had win8 installed already, but your key and instructions helped.

slmgr now says it's permanently activated.
Thanks for your continuous support here."

This method worked for me and Windows now reports permanent activation. Thanks!"
,bryan214,2013-02-25T21:42Z,"Still works great! I called the UK number from the US and activated it fine. You'll probably have to install all the updates before you can get apps from the store though. 

A heads up for people installing this on an HP laptop, it's likely you'll run into problems. There's a lot of stuff about it online. Apparently the DVD install doesn't work all the time, I'd try backing everything up first and mounting it through daemon tools first. If you're upgrading make sure to uninstall any 3rd part antivirus first or the compatibility check will hang. 

Jcasas was just reposting Halloweenphyco's guide on page 24 to confirm it still works and renew it on the front comment page. So all credit still goes to Halloweenpsycho, thanks man!"

If you want Windows 8 activated you can’t have WMC aswell,  WMC keeps disabling the activation code but if you already tried adding in WMC and it disabled Windows 8 this is how to re activate it.




1)  Disable/Delete WMC by following the steps on this page:

**it's not alowing to post the site, ""7pmtech"" 

2)  Run the Windows 8 set up again.  (May need a reboot before it lets you)



3)  Follow the steps for the phone activation that Halloweenpsycho posted. 

(Not including the WMC steps)



4)  It didn’t work for me first time, if it doesn’t for you either re-start the phone activation method again using this code instead:



slmgr.vbs -ipk CQ7YK-YQNWC-KDJPF-2XB2P-KWXT7

 slmgr.vbs -ato




5)  Once again, don’t follow the WMC steps he posted.



6)  UK lady should say the ID is working and gives you one back like before.



7)  After you type it in take a screenshot of the code in case it happens again for whatever reason.



8)  Click activate.



9)  Don't add in WMC.



10)  You now have Windows 8 Pro Activated.  Now switch over to a Microsoft account in PC-Settings for Store downloads etc."

I had a permanently activated Win 8 Pro with WMC (activated in last November using a free MS WMC key). Unfortunately some days ago my PC's motherboard failed and I had to replace it with a new one. It comes from the same vendor but a different type. No other change was made on the PC. 
At a new start it seemed that Win 8 will have no problem with the change, but finally I noticed that Win 8 was not activated any more. And there is a message: ""This product key is already being used on another PC. Try a different key or by a new one"". My question is: do you see any chance that your method can help reactivate my Win 8? Or any other suggestion? Thanks for your help."
,Halloweenpsycho,2013-03-05T09:34Z,"@optimist7
Yes absolutely my methods should take care of your issue..what i would try first before doing any re installing is simply follow the above instructions i give on how to activate. Just follow the whole instruction list except skip the actual windows 8 activation as you only need to have the wmc activated, so just follow through instructions and skip to the wmc activation method, and give it a shot :)"

,optimist7,2013-03-05T20:07Z,"@Halloweenpsycho
One more question before trying your method. The last two items on the instruction list are: check activation remained period (9.) and check volume activation expire (10.). Are these steps really necessary? In case Windows is permanently activated, the system should report that ""windows is activated"" and the date of activation. That' all. No grace period, no expiry."

Retail means that it is a retail version of the software, meaning just as if you bought it from the store. The iso is Untouched and nothing manipulated in order to make the program function. The Untouched version that you see, is worded as so, because a lot of people were releasing edited copies or pre releases of the software. I decided to word it as retail, so that people looking would know my version is retail. The only thing i changed, was the installation screens on my versions, as to mark them and add my own touch to the installation process. So retail = Untouched. ;)"

lol..its all good..just had to through a little love your way, since you seemed to be wanting to make out with me..lol.Nah buddy..Thats what makes TPB a great place, as we are all entitled to our own opinion and we are allowed to express those opinions :) Just do me a favor, if you want to use my torrent just check back time to time for code updates, as it is a little hard to reverse the algorythm of Microsoft Serial's and thus takes a while to get new codes done. I can how ever suggest a alternative to this Windows 8, you can use the Untouched version provided by a different uploader. Just note that the process used to activate the windows is Kms Emulated activation , and needs to be re activated every 180days. But the fall down to this is that Microsoft is Starting a mass check on Kms activation methods, and pushing checks to the users, and may deactivate your system. Now Also i have made a Activator, and i am still working on the activator, the one i released is a temp job as i am well away from my finished activator, working alone is a bitch..lol...My activator will activate your system. How ever at the current moment Once you use my Activator to Activate Windows you will need to turn off your automatic updates, as upon trying to update your system it will deactivate it. So let me give all of you a link to my Activator, and also People said they had issues with the personalization being locked still, i also made a unlocker for that as well. So for those waiting on new codes Try my Activator and Also my Unlocker..

Buddy i am really sorry..But at this moment i have no new wmc codes atm...I will soon.. :) Now with all the comments, i realize how hard it would be to read through them all, and a lot of thing can be over looked as for help. So I will be sure to post this every so often to make those aware of Backing up your Activations Of windows 8 and or Windows 8 Wmc.. Thanks to Josh Cell Software He has been kind enough to provide a method to back up your activations so that in the future, if you would ever need to re install for some reason or another, you will not need to go threw the hasle of the activation method all over again, you simply just restore your System activation..Very easy, and very Handy..I have uploaded the software at this link
https://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8084095/Advanced_Tokens_Manager

I have provided detailed instructions as of the process..Besure you pay close attetention..I will Note here: If you are only going to install Windows 8 Pro and WIndows 8 Pro Only..You will only need to complete your activation method and then back it up. Now how ever for those Wanting to install Windows Media Center, which let me explain that the media center is seriously not needed at all, as the Home Group produces the same function basically, with allowing you to share Your computers, or allowing lets say your xbox, or ps3 to connect to your pc. But for thos that insist on The Wmc. If you are going to install the Windows Media Center. You will need first to ofcourse Activate your windows 8 pro first, and let me stress this..Besure that after you Activate windows 8 Pro and before you install Windows 8 Wmc You will Need to Back up Your WIndows 8 Pro Activation First, and then after you back up WIndows 8 pro Activation then Install the WIndows media center and then again after you activate WIndows media center you will need to run another backup for the wmc..So you will need a Back up for both WIndows 8 pro, and WIndows Media Center..NOTE: IF YOU FAIL TO BACKUP WINDOWS 8 PRO, BEFORE YOU INSTALL WINDOWS MEDIA CENTER YOU WILL MORE THAN LIKELY need a new serial for windows 8 pro..But your if you have the back up for wmc, then you can still use it, but only after you have reactivated WIndows 8 Pro..:)"

The main part I have problem with right now is the calling part. I downloaded Skype after the whole install of Windows 8.

While using the phone activation I tried all possible combinations. With internet on, with internet off, with the Location on the Activation thing as UK and US. The call is always a fail or I need Skype Credit for it to work. So do I have to get Skype Credit, I thought it was a toll free call. Sometimes it says its call failed.

I tried skimming through all the comments to check and see if there is a explanation but couldn't find one through my search. 

So what I'm asking is could you explain how the phone part works on Skype (never tried phone Skype before)? It's suppose to be a toll free call right, whys it keep asking me for Skype Credit. 

Thanks for your work, hope my question isn't too much trouble to answer. "
,Halloweenpsycho,2013-03-06T04:17Z,"@WRyng
Well in all honesty, you can use your phone to make the toll free call, i am unsure of your location. Now you can use the other numbers for other countries if need be. Yes skype is free and free to call a toll free number. Now that number you may need to use the one intended for your country. It is just best to use the us or uk number as more of a count toward were the activation was made. Any way..give it a shot that way..and if all else fails. You can use my activator and unlocker..hope this helps :)"

,Halloweenpsycho,2013-03-08T01:09Z,"@HardTaco
Sorry buddy..had to get my meds..Ok..here is the step process to ensure a correct bootable usb. When i made my iso i sadly forgot to use a 3-3 combo and used only joilet 2-3 combo..So..first things first..WIth your new build first be sure that your new board states it is Windows 8 ready. Even boards that state they are ready for windows 8 may still need a bios update. My build for instance..Sabertooth z79, 32gig of vengence ram, 3rd gen I7 extreme, Nvidia gefore 690 classified 4gb video card. Even though it was stated the board was windows 8 ready, i hade to run a bios update to get all to run correctly, but in any case just try to run what you have first to be sure that a bios update is not nessacery..:) To make this usb boootable and super easy..If you already have a WIndows 8 iso, lets say you have mine for example..Download Power iso..Once you have installed it, open the prgram, and drag the current iso to the power iso window. Now once you have done that, locate Image settings, in the image settings make sure that you check the box udf. Now select Save as, and default it will show daa as the file extension. Simply choose Iso from the drop down window and then proceed to save the file where ever you want it :) Now to make it super easy, with no hassle..Download Windows 7 Usb/Dvd tool you can get it here, https://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8154656/Windows-USB-DVD-tool
Now that you have taken care of setting up the iso with udf checked you can now use this tool to make the bottable usb in 4 easy steps..it does everything for you. :) But remember this..The above i described with power iso is nessacery as if you try to just use the tool i mentioned it will tell you the iso is invalid, because i did not make the iso udf compatable. So i really hope this helps with everyhting..If you need any further help please don't hesitate to hit me up..:) Good luck on your new build..."

I am really sorry to hear your having issues getting the usb to a bootable state..I wrote about this a few times, on how to fix it but i realize there is a ton of comments to go through as well, so let me try and help you out on making a bootable usb..Ok first your using the usb/ dvd tool for a iso. So here is what we need to do in order for you to be able to use that tool. First things first..We need to download Power iso..which you can get here..https://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7931780/Power_ISO_5.5_FINAL_keys_keyG%5BLz0%5D_by_Senzati
Great program to have around :) Now once you set the program up, open it up, and drag the iso file into the open window in power iso. Now go to the top left and click on file/ you will see image properties/ in image properties you will see a box that says UDF/ Make sure to put a check beside this box. Now We want to click on Save as/ by default the extension will be set to Daa now first lets just use the drop down and select to save it as a iso. Once you have done that save the file were ever you want on your pc. Ok now your ready to use the Windows 7 usb/Dvd tool to make your image..Everything should be ready to rock'n roll.. :) If you have any issues please hit me back..hope this helps."

If your process failed at 99%, then I had the exact same problem as yours, and i found the solution online.

The cause for me was that I was using a 32bit Windows and the download tool tries to search for the ""bootsect.exe"" that is only available in 64bit windows.

I followed the instruction of scenario 2 in this link and it completed successfully:
http://davidnudelman.com/2012/win7-usbdvd-download-tool-unable-to-copy-files/

and SIW2 in this page provided the link to download the bootsect.exe:

,adonese12,2013-03-10T20:16Z,"@roltzeji 
here am gonna tell you what i did to install windows 
1-if you have dvd , burn the iso using poweriso just search it in tpb ,when the burn ends the dvd will automatically eject
2-enter the dvd again open it , open setup and then wait until copying temporary files
3-it will ask you if you want to get latest upgrade blah blah choose you are free to accept
then it will ask you if you want to upgrade save all you files and settings or clean installation
after that windows will check for compatibility if you choose upgrade all will ask you for the desk where you want to install windows(it's something like that not remember exactly)
and then it will take time till all that end
then your computer will restart and the installation wil continue after that you will be asked to enter the sn wich you will find at the download contents you may skip this step 
after that you successfully installed w8

****
HOW TO ACTIVATE YOUR WINDOWS:
disable internet 
first open cmd as administrator and then type the command
 slmgr.vbs -ipk	GPTCC-XN297-PVGY7-J8FQY-JK49V
and then go to windows activation type it in control panel 
hit activate by skype
choose country uk 
call the free toll number+448000188354
press 1 for home user
then she will say a lot of words whether you are familiar with the skype activation method just press the hash key and then insert confirmation id wich you will find at the bottom of the past program(activate by skype method)
it's 9 columns insert them it will ask you one by one then it will ask you this activation for one or more press one then enter the confirmation that you will hear and now you are all done"

If you are experencing these issues and the bios update does nothing for you, then more than likely your pc is not capable of running windows 8. You can revert back to windows 7 and you can use my torrent if you like it contains all versions of windows 7 64 and 32 bit from starter clear up to Ultimate..WIth all oem for all pc's..Menaing when you run my torrent it will load the correct screens and info for your computer again intel, asus, etc.. my Windows 7 torrent is located here..https://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8058081/Windows_7_Sp1_Halloween_Edition_%5BAll_32_and_64_bit_versions%5D

Also to those having a issue and if i have not got back to you, please be patient i am not ignoring you as i will get to you as soon as i am feeling better.

PF9TR-KNB98-T7JPF-TWF8W-F3G7C
BYXV8-9YN72-VTF7H-8G7PT-WW8X2
choose one of them
if you searched internet and didn't find any way around you may use activation by crack yes it's not like activation by skype but this is temporary until some one get a working key
BTW i visited microsoft community and asked them about working crack or keys but they didn't give me anyone how bad they are"
,adonese12,2013-03-12T04:48Z,"okay and this is kms activation it will last for 180 days not bad
Now to make sure you have the right key installed for your version. You can find the keys you need here: http://textuploader.com/?p=6&id=noQu

You need to add it by opening a cmd prompt in admin mode by pressing WinX and selecting Command Prompt (Admin), then type this:
slmgr /ipk XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
replce the Xs with one of the keys that you'll find at the site

If your system accepts the key, then you need to select the KMS server you wish to use  this code:

slmgr /skms lunar21.no-ip.org:80


Once you do that now comes the deciding part of this whole thing. You now need to run the activation code by running it in the same window as the other 2 codes:

(If everything goes correct, you should now be activated. If you get an error then we will deal with that shortly).

To check if you are activated run this code in that cmd prompt:
slmgr.vbs /ato

(You can see there exp and it should say 180 days. If not look below for the error number you received.)


thanx :)"

You will need to just re install and use your back up activation :) You can uninstall wmc, but it is a daunting task. easiest to re install. When you re install since you backed up windows 8 all you need to do is to enter the serial that you backed up which can be found in the configuration file in the backup folder by right clicking and opening with note pad there you will be abe to see your serial. Then just activate as normal just by trying activation over the internet. Ofcourse you will receive a error, but no worries.. just exit from the error and then run backup restore and it will re activate from there :)"

Very new to this but just a heads up to newbs...always go to your pc's website and save LAN or internet drivers or any other important drivers to disc/usb before doing OS install. 95% of problems after install due to driver issues especially on laptops..please research torrents and read instructions cause the pros feel you are copying off them during an open book test...thnx

,mj_c,2013-03-21T08:28Z,"Hey guys.

I see how most people are having problems installing Windows 8. I was, too. I have a Macbook Pro Retina 15"" running Mountain Lion. I wanted to install Windows 8 on it using Parallels without buying anything.

And somehow I did.

I made this account for the sole purpose of telling you how I did it. I did all of this while connected to the internet. I imagine this works on Windows, too, because the only thing that really matters is the product key.

MAC: Start with Step 1
WINDOWS: Skip to Step 3

Step 1. I downloaded Parallels 8 (trial, I plan on cracking it or whatever) and I installed the Windows 8 Halloween Edition .iso made by Halloweenpsycho (thanks brotha!).

Step 2. In Parallels I had to enter an activation key for Windows. I entered the first one in the Windows 8 pro 32 and 64 bit Serial [With Wmc] torrent by Halloweenpsycho (it's on his page). It's the first key that starts with a ""V.""

That worked in Parallels and I went into the Windows installation and tried to enter the same key. DIDN'T WORK.

So I found another activation key. This one worked. I struggled finding this. There were countless YouTube videos providing links but almost every website promised it after I took a survey...not doing that bullshit. Anyway, since I have a YouTube account enabled with monetization, I thought I'd take advantage of it, so if you feel like clicking my links that would be cool, lol jk. But seriously. I usually only post music but I figured this would help people. 

Step 3: Watch my latest video on YouTube. Username /mattjc33

First download Power iso prefferable from

now the iso you got from my torrent, once you have installed the power iso and you have it opened up simply drag the iso into the empty window. Now go to image settings, make check sure you tic the box UDF, now after you do this simply save the iso, by default Power iso will be set to save the file as Daa, so be sure to change that to Iso before you save the file. Now once thats all done you can now use the windows 7 usb tool as it will now recognize the iso as valid. :)

I installed and have been running this Windows 8 for a few months now, mostly without issue. The one thing that's still bugging me is that Windows 8 doesn't seem to boot properly on it's own, as if it's missing some files required for it to start. I had built my own computer and tried installing from a 1TB external, which didn't work, so I wound up downloading the iso to my laptop's old HDD and installed it to the new computer's HDD that way. Now, both hard drives are connected to my machine because the operating system doesn't boot up if the laptop's HDD (containing Windows 7 and the Windows 7 boot files) isn't hooked up. Any ideas on how to fix this? (I hope this made sense, but if it didn't I can try to explain it better)

Thanks!"

This method has worked for everyone so far, please help me support it because people usually only listen to you, thanks

1. Download Windows 8 Pro Retail [Permanent Activation Wmc Included]
2. Update to windows 8
3. If your key does not work it is fine.
4. http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8132839/KMSnano_v25_Portable_Activate_Windows_and_MS_Office ... Download and open this file, and your windows should be activated.
5. Go to Control Panel and click on ""Additional features"" It is either ""additional"" or ""more"" features, then use the WMC code that came with this program, and you should be able to download WMC.
6. After it downloads, windows should be unactivated, but then just download this FILE: http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8156714/Windows_8_Personalization_Unlocker ... and even though it is supposed to be a personalization unlocker, it actually activated windows for me.
7. after you open the file, your computer will open a blank blue screen, but be patient for windows is only preparing for a restart. after it restarts, windows should be activated! Good Luck! :)

,SavageGod,2013-03-30T09:36Z,"All you guys using the ""personalization unlocker"" do you know if this is a permanent or temporary activation? I'm guessing it hasn't been out long enough to find out, and I'm sure microsoft will address it eventually with updates. Just a guess of course. The only true, PERMANENT ACTIVATION FOREVER method that I'm aware of is either ""purchasing"" or doing the ""call in"" method. Of course, true Windows 8 connoisseur's, such as myself will only do PERMANENT ACTIVATIONS FOREVER methods, as the KMS 6 month rearm is not feasible for putting windows 8 on family and friends laptops. 

As for all, please pay tribute to Halloweenpsycho for his hard work and dedication to providing us with reliable keys to use for calling in, week in and week out. He is truly an asset to the Piratebay/Kickass community, and as such deserves to be paid homage to. And yes, he has accertained to the greatness of the top 10 contributors in my head, reaching the status of ""ChingLiu"", ""Scene4all"", ""piratepedia"", ""EZTV"" and the great ""thethingy""(ok ok, maybe not on ""thethingy"" level yet, but maybe in a few years!)

Anyways, all that being said, any chance you have any fresh, working keys for us Halloweenpsycho?

I truly appriciate the complaiments more than you know as i respect these users very much.I consider this Very touching and i sincerely thank you.@ All others
If you seem to have a issue with windows 8 my best explanation for the issues encountered 
#1= CHeck your motherboard make and modle and besure it is capable of running windows 8.
#2= If you are comfortable go to your motherboard manufacture website, locate your modle and update your bios ""Please note this can sometimes cause a system to brick, todays boards are a quite lesser chance of this occuring but it can occur, but note it is fixiable.
3= If you can't seem to fix the issues or have problems locating the above, please feel free to leave the information for your system and i will be glad to look into for you.

And also, I am not worried about WMC(Is it that big a deal??)

,Warsun99,2013-04-02T03:57Z,"Well I gave it a shot.I figured I would test out this.I had been meaning to do it for a while so I finally did it.Now my opinion.The controls are clunky.Not too clunky.You do have some easier windows to access like your programs.

But when it comes down to getting what you need.You spend most of your time double checking.Was it here? Was it here?That is a problem.No start button.I had to download a separate button for that.Why? I needed a Run button.It was not there.In fact it would be normally located on your toolbar.But your toolbar provides even less on how to customize your desktop.

I saw that as a problem as well.Well changing your desktop background.Surely this is easy.NOPE! You cannot change it due to the Retail of this product.I tried several programs.None of them work.I could change one screen even another but I could not get rid of the background or add something i would like to see without trouble.

This i considered poor.An because of that I do not want Windows 8 Pro.Lack of customization is a failure.A good side is it has some programs that are up to date an ready to use.The downside of this is.You are behind a window.You are behind TrustedUser.So you cannot access anything because Trusted User is Administrator.So you are behind a window.An someone can watch you an what you do.Even get account information.This brings up the thing that completely waste your time.

Windows 8 Does not utilize more than 4 core processors.If you have a 6 core an benchmark.You do not see a difference between 4 core performance over 8 Core performance.Thus a complete an total Waste of your time.I would not recommend downloading this.Holloweenpsycho did put this up but I would consider this a waste.Go back to Windows 7.Nothing to see here new."

Hi, I'm about to install this OS according to your instructions and I have a question: when I ask for the product key I put this key??:

2. Update to Windows 8 With This key:
PKQ6T-N8GMC-VXYX4-HWMTH-8HRDP

Or this??:
Use this Key during installation to activate.
PKQ6T-N8GMC-VXYX4-HWMTH-8HRDP
this came in the folder from the start.
Please help me."

I have a small question..you come into a torrent with 1100+ comments of people stating this works, and all is well. SOme have issues because there pc is not windows 8 compatable. But i am dumb founed as to why you would instruct people to not download this as it a waste of time ? If there is a issue..i may be able to help you, let me know if you would like help. As for all others with questions..let me look into some things and i will reply i promise..been very busy.. :)"
[V],murphy78,2013-04-11T13:23Z,"Windows 8 has built-in WAT updating. Using any widely spread internet keys without disabling the updating can result in many people logging onto their computer to a big non-genuine screen. People who have used Windows 7 when WinLoader was new know the feeling.  If you still feel like trying your luck, you can use either the default Win8Pro key: XKY4K-2NRWR-8F6P2-448RF-CRYQH

Or the gVLK KMS key: NG4HW-VH26C-733KW-K6F98-J8CK4

The only known method of making a permanent activated wmc setup is to use a non-banned wmc key with a retail data.dat from a legit user's system, and swap the files a few times using phone method. I'm not going to give the exact procedure because it's bad to try to get a bunch of people to use it, but I'm sure halloween has probably included instructions.

They can, and probably will ban all wmc keys halloween provides. Your system will attempt to communicate with the activation server daily. Check eventvwr.msc admin details.

I still recommend using kms, esp now that the re-activation is instant."
,nubcake,2013-04-11T15:33Z,"Thanks, HP.
I think it's good...It installed, i login.
There's a little warning icon on the bottom right of the taskbar, when i open it, it says windows determined the key has been blocked.

Doesn't say how long i have or what will happen if i don't get a new key.
Not really a huge issue, i suppose there are activation blockers out there..but the less stuff to install, the better :)

thanks ! also, i'd remove the special hello screen lol. makes it seem....unlegit/trusted."

- you just need a serial for the initial install page thats all.

- you have to be online when using the toolkit, no if's or buts - you have to be.

there, installation issues ALL SORTED.
tested on 3 PC's, perfect.

reading these comments, some retards shouldn't touch PC's full stop, stick to your android phone + PS3. (i.e. chuckus36)"
,PineappleStarz,2013-04-13T03:10Z,"actually, i was being mean to chuckus36 - just looks like a young caps typing goon lol.

follow instructions ^^ and rejoice!

Microsoft Toolkit.exe must STAY on hdd (create a folder for it and mark it as ready only, also add AV exception for antivirus so it doesn't delete it.

if you cant see that it says ""activated"" scroll the toolkit window down lol

and yeh Murphy - your a DICK!!"

,PineappleStarz,2013-04-13T10:44Z,"@pbntomi26, check optical drive - does the reader read the burn, maybe it doesn't like the disk etc 

do what i do, do a usb install with WinSetupFromUSB 1.0 (google it)

if it still screws up maybe your hdd needs disk check or is faulty.

or your not waiting long enough maybe that 92% takes a while cos its a large cab file? dunno."

The ones that cant get this to work, its not a bad torrent, you just need to take a second and read the comments and find the fix. 

I installed over windows 7 ult the first time and the key would not activate and the activator found here (https://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8319779/Windows_8_Personalization_unlocker_and_Activator_All_in_one) also would also not work.

I then formatted part of the the HDD and installed on a empty partition, then ran the activator after and its worked like a charm. 

SO WHAT IM SAYING IS: install to a fresh partition and it may work better for you.


enjoy; SEED!

thanks for a great torrenrt. keep up the good work

I told him i was sorry for what i said about Everybodylies which is  a helper..ANd ""Soda"" which is a ""MOD: a while back Soda decided to say some vvery nasty stuff to me on a thread i put up. and Everybodylies stuck his ose in and said some nasty stuff as well and told me to fuck off son..SO i said i was sorry for telling him what i thought of him. But few moments ago i wrote Hobbitdude another helper that stuck his nose on Everybodylies behalf because he has no spine. You see i told Everybodylies what a piece of filth and shit i thought he was..So.. He ran to a mod, which i cant prove it was ""Soda"" but i have my suspisions..Anyway..he ran to a mod and cried his little eyes out and had my trusted status removed because i told hime what i thought of him. I questionsed all about freedom of speach this and that...How the Pirate bay proudly boasts from time to time The FREDOM BAY. But because i exercised my freeedom of speach. I was puished..and mocked by Everybodylies by him going to my torrent here.
https://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8362989/Evil_Dead_2013_%5BFixed%5D
5th line down and leaving me a nice little smiley face because he was so proud of his work. So fellow pirates. I wrote that i wasn't sorry, and i should never have to give up my freedoms to make tpb happy. You see, i try to be a good person i really do. But God knows some people just push me to the point i can't take it. In short we all have a  breaking point. But note this. You as a person me nothing to tpb community. They have gotten away with so many things for so long, and they probably always will. I may not be here anymore once Hobbitdude the helper cries to the mod that took my status away for speaking my mind. But remember this. I will always be around some were..some place..And don't ever give up your freedoms to please others. Sincerely yours.

HP was doing his own stuff here, replying to others & helping em out in comment section but then came Murphy on one of Psycho's Windows 8 torrents & start blabbing about keys being blacklisted & how KMS is the only trusted method of activating...blah blah...

I've activated 10 computers using HPs's keys, one of them being my current Gaming PC & NOTHING has happened so far to any of them. They still work fine & I can do windows update as well. Murphy is just jealous clown because right after HP's Windows 8 torrents came on tpb, nobody were downloading his useless KMS dogshit activation based torrents.

YOU REALLY ARE A DUMB FUCKING MONKEY MURPHY, YOU FUCKING CLOWN!!! YOU RUINED IT FUCKING IDIOT!!!"

He went and cried is little baby eyes out to a admin that took the trusted status away from me. I have tried pming several admins, and go figure, i never get a pm back. Its all good.. I started on another excellent site, were i will never have to worry about any pathetic pieces of shit like 'MURPH78"" WHo started the whole thing. ""Everybodylies a helper a.k.a Baby Back Bitch"" ""Soda a Admin worthless piece of shit"" I am on my way to vip status.

I will always offer my help, and i will continue to support the work i have done here. I don't think i will upload anything else here atm, except new keys as needed:)  But as soon as i am set up good and proper on my new site i will send the links here. And let everyone know where i reside. Oh one more thing..The mod that took my trusted status is to much of a coward to tell me he did it. I think it's ""Soda"" But i will never know, because they got balls to down my trusted status, but they don't have the balls to come forth. You all take care, and don't be afraid to ask for help, as i check these everyday normally :)"

It has the keys required & method of activating Windows 8. Follow the instructions EXACTLY as mentioned by HP in that torrent i linked. Your windows should be activated forever if you do everything right. But in case if the activation on those keys are all spent, tell HP about the issue here & he should upload a new torrent with new keys shortly. Imo the keys should be still working from that torrent & if you follow exactly as instructed by HP your windows should be fully activated."

This will tell you whether your pc is compatable with windows 8. Now as for second. If you are wanting to install this on a new pc that has no operating system, or you just want to upgrade to windows 8, or do a fresh install you can do this :)
I have made this windows 8 bootable already, just go to your bios at start of pc, go to boot options, and select the Dvd rom you are using as your first boot priority and your Hdd as second, Hit f10 and save. Upon reboot and load you will now see press any key to boot from cd. After you have installed and you are all done, simply go back to bios and reverse the directions..All done..
Now if once you have activated Windows, and you still can't change your user pic or background etc..SImply use my

Today i tried to activate the same way (instructions from that keys file) and i'm stuck at installation ID. Robot tells me he needs to connect me to ms representative (tried all 5 keys just to be sure) and after talking to a girl with rly nice voice she told me that it CAN'T be activated (some kind of ID mismatch or something like that).
Anyone had problems like that?"
,Halloweenpsycho,2013-04-26T03:27Z,"you should never talk to ms staff. If you have a issue under the us or uk number you can use different numbers, and if skype is giving a issue you can use your phone to do so. Talking to ms staff will only get the keys blocked. As for the back up manager. If you install a new pc you will have to do the activation all over again, as the token manager is connected to the slic to the specific pc in which the activation was saved."

below informations maybe useful for new downloader : 
this setup included some windows update , so that is why this setup file size is larger than default installer which is around 3gb
this setup working for efi boot/system (if you understand what is it)
default language is EN-US
this is 64-bit :)
default IE is a little bit laggy , should be no problems after you update it to latest version through windows update

,Halloweenpsycho,2013-04-28T22:05Z,"You are all more than welcome..i am glad i am able to help. I try to offer help to everyone i can, be it my torrent or another persons torrent..Yes i was a trusted uploader here. I had a bad day, lets just say that. I won't go into detail over it, because i spoke with the mod responsible for removing it and we agreed for me to let it go, and i would earn my status back. I mean be it a mod, or just a normal user..it is only human to anger, but to make peace is a out of body experince. I will always be here as long as tpb has me. And if something happens here. I will always be around at another site. On another site atm, i am close to being a mod. It is a huge site, quite like the piratebay. Once i get my mod status i will surely update all of you as to where that site is. Sometimes i don't get the chance to anwser some of you, for that i apologize. I get busy time to time, and i just get sort of lost..I sincerely mean this. I thank each of you who have supported me, and even those that try to down me. With out you guys, i would be doing this for nothing. A wonderful person once said to me ""We are all but human, looking for help, Knowledge and a thirst to succseed, but always remember that the teacher and helper was once and always will be in need"" I mean take this fellow coming to my torrents and trying to steer people away, why? Because he needs knowledge, but doesn't understand how to seek it thus he lashes out toward those that have it. I am in no way shape nor form a expert at anything in life. I have done things with computers from a child to adult hood, in order to learn how to bring things to life. But as above i will always be in need of more knowledge. Just think if everyone knew everything about everything. Some pretend too, but if we did it would be such a waste to live. One other thing. Some of the mods here, are bully mods plain and simple.. "

,CyrusWong,2013-04-30T11:02Z,"Halloweenpsycho , how to restore the ""back up key"" ?

directly restore the wmc key or restore 1 by 1 ? win8 keys 1st then follow by wmc key ?"
,Halloweenpsycho,2013-04-30T13:55Z,"yes to restore..you must first use the windows 8 pro activation backup. you will need to enter the serial used in the back. In the backup folder you will see a config file. Right click it and select open with notepad. Here you will see the serial that was used during backup. You will need to enter this serial into windows as you were activating it for the first time. But you don't need to proceed past that point, i mean trying to activate via phone or net. once you enter the serial then run the backup program, it may ask for the last 5 numbers of the serial, which you will have, then just repeat same step for wmc :) "

,Halloweenpsycho,2013-05-01T02:11Z,you have to activate it by phone. once activated make a backup of activation.

,met2ica,2013-05-01T02:48Z,"What i'm really confused about is, once i call them do i just give them any key or a certain one?"
,Halloweenpsycho,2013-05-01T05:18Z,"just any of the windows 8 pro keys.just be sure to put the key in by going to the bottom of your windows 8 screen, click the folder you see. Look for computer, right click it and select properties. Now you will be at the screen were you can add your new key, and then on to phone activation. Do not talk to anyone from ms..only use the Automated system. If it says that the key you are trying to use is invalid, then hang up, and go back and change product key following steps above until you get a good serial. Talking to Ms staff will get the keys blocked quickly. If it says you need the installation Id it is the same place were you went to activate following above steps. Just scroll down and you will see it there..on the phone you will have a 9 column number to give to the automated system, once you are done it will give you a confirmation number to type in. :)"

,hacavitz,2013-05-01T18:19Z,"@Halloweenpsycho I am very interested in installing this W8. It seems to be the best option out there. However, I just have to ask some questions before doing it:

1. I'm living in Mexico right now, can I still activate it? (since it's supposedly done by phone)

2. I've read that sometimes W8 gets stuck on a black screen when being installed. Does it happen in this case? If so, is there a way to avoid that from happening?"
,Halloweenpsycho,2013-05-02T03:38Z,"not a problem.the black screen, blue screen drivers issues, all come back to compatibility issues 99%  of the time. Use this site to make sure your pc is compatible with windows 8.
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/win8/CompatCenter/Home?Language=en-US
Now if you are unsure of the make and modle of your motherboard or pc, download a free little program called speccy. This will give you all the info needed on your pc. Also not matter what part of the world you are in, this should work fine. You can simply use the phone number for your country. :) Hope this helps, if you all need anything hit me back."

By the way, I was previously able to activate Win8 without WMC successfully using the one of the serials in your same posting.  Now I have updated to Win8 with WMC can not activate this version.  However, I did use the Advanced Token Manager before updating.  If I need to revert back I will need to do a fresh install again and then run the Advanced Token Manager, right?"

I finished downloading and now currently seeding

I have a win Vista 32 bit and I know this is a Win 8 64 bit version but can I use this and do a clean/custom install instead of an ""upgrade"" install?

Or do I have to install the win 8 32 bit before upgrading to 64 bit? Though I heard that cross-architecture upgrade might not be possible unless I do a clean install right?

I already backed up my files etc."

So I tried to reinstall it again but it hangs during setup and I cannot even install windows 7. I set my bios to start from cd/dvd but when it says do you want to boot up from cd I press 'y'  but nothing happens. It's as if this install will not allow me to install anything at all.

1. Fresh install of windows 8 pro with key provided in the included text file.
2. Install went smoothly.  Downloaded HP's serial text file torrent
3. disconnected from internet
4. opened cmd prompt (admin) and entered slmgr.vbs -ipk with one of the keys in the file.
5. messages pops up saying installation of key went successfully.
6. entered slmgr.vbs -ato, then closed the error message.
7. went to System --> view detail in windows activation
8. hit activate by phone and chose country.
9. Called 18554699468 (number shown in the view details in windows activation window) using Skype on a separate computer
10. entered the 9 groups of ID
11. robot tells me it can't find the confirmation ID

,jgibbs99,2013-05-09T01:45Z,"HP, this download was 22 minutes, installation went smother as a clean install than an upgrade, however both did work. activation was simple and easy to follow, thank you very much for the time and effort you put into this, much appreciated!"
,jgibbs99,2013-05-09T01:57Z,"Hmm, I wrote a comment thanking you for this torrent however someone deleted my comment updating my previous comment on how this torrent worked for me. So I'll try this again, I downloaded it in 22 minutes, initially tried to upgrade Win7 64bit and ran into a few issues but eventually it installed and activation was simple and easy to understand, success! I then rinsed and repeated on my desktop which went much smother doing a clean install than it did with the upgrade option. So yeah, this is a flawless torrent, the included keys work and activate without any problems. Thanks again m8 _/"

Could you explain it to me? In a brief way or something. How many keys do I have to input? 2? One for the installation and one for the ""after-installation"" activation? Do I still have to activate by phone, online or just input the key into a window of the OS?

Can you please tell me what I need to use to get this installed on the other computer. I tried the 64 bit version and it started installing and went to restart and when it came back un it said it could install it - so what would be the reason why it would not install.  it is a Acer Inspirion.

,introver,2013-05-14T22:34Z,"Alright guys for anyone having problems with this like I did Please listen to these directions closely.

Step 1: Disconnect from internet. Open command prompt as admin and type this- slmgr upk (this will uninstall all product keys)

Step 2: Type this in the command prompt 
             slmgr.vbs -ipk(enter product key here)

Step 3: Once you entered the product key that hallowen has provided in the links in the comments and it says ""product key installed successfully"" you're going to want to type this into command prompt again.
              slui 4

Step 4: now that you typed in slui 4 MAKE SURE YOU SELECT United Kingdom as your country, it doesn't matter where you live. Now that you selected UK, a page will pop up with the number you should call. Call that number using skype or your phone. Once you call make sure you say for home use, then enter the 9 boxes of number as the operator tells you make sure you don't fuck up. 

Step 5: The operator will then give you the other 9 box numbers, if you entered the first 9 correctly. Listen carefully and enter then slowly. 

Step 6: Hit Activate and WINDOWS 8 is activated.

P.S i would not recommend activating windows media center, it can fuck up your windows 8 activation and I dont feel its worth it, after all how many of us use WMC? But anyways enjoy!"
,hacavitz,2013-05-15T04:54Z,"^^^ @introver Did you use a serial when you first installed it? If so, where did you get it from? Did you use the one that comes in the ISO or another one?

Btw, thank you so much for providing instructions. It definitely makes it a lot more clear."
,introver,2013-05-15T07:39Z,"@hacavitz
I used a lot of serials that didnt work thats why i put that command (slmgr upk) 
Because it will uninstall any product key.

Now the keys you're going to want to use for this are the ones that halloween provides in this download, he updates them like everyday pretty much. So try these keys out. Remember call the UK number, or it wont work.

,DACynder,2013-05-15T20:39Z,I'm cross with getting 8 or sticking with 7. My Asus laptop had 7 64-bit when I bought it back in 2010 and I've been hearing that Windows 8 passively uses less memory which would boost gaming performance and overall be less of a strain for my computer. Would it be worth it for the upgrade? And if so am I able﻿ to keep all my files and settings with the upgrade? :/
,introver,2013-05-15T21:15Z,"@DACynder
It's true windows 8 uses less memory, I recently switched from windows 7 on my gaming PC to windows 8. 
You don't really notice the performance boost in games.
Although you definitely notice the faster boot up times and shut down times. If you like the look and feel of Windows 8, just switch. It is a learning curve, and you have to learn how to use Windows 8 but I feel its worth it especially since its getting more and more updated. 
Now, about keeping your files. Yes you can keep your files, but I would recommend you do a clean install first, I had to delete 300 gigs of games but I can easily re install, i felt it was worth it.

At the end of the day its up to you."
,hacavitz,2013-05-16T04:10Z,"@introver Thanks a lot for providing any feedback from your experience with this torrent.

I agree that it'd be fun to discover a new user interface and ""play"" with it. That's what I'm looking forward to, plus the boost performance of course.

I will surely give the information of how the installation went for me, once I make it. Just pay attention guys, and be sure to ask questions if you've got them, you should eventually manage to do it as long as you met up the required specs."

If you did a upgrade, I would suggest you do a clean install. Back up your files, and then it should install fine. 
Also 32 bit and 64 bit the only difference is that with 64 bit of windows you're allowed to use over 4 gigs of ram. If you have more than 4 gb of memory installed, you need 64 bit windows 8 which is this one. "

@Halloweenpsycho -- Thank you for providing this torrent and working with others to help them get it activated. I would strongly recommend copying and pasting Introver's instructions on Page 53 into the torrent description. 
I believe it would vastly cut down on people posting about the same issue over and over and help a lot of people out. That way, it would make the comment section a lot easier to navigate and make it easier for you to help others who are having different problems.

Thanks again! "

I'm thinking twice about trusting the release now, questioning what other crap you've injected into it.

If there's one piece of software that shouldn't be injected and tampered around with (and especially injecting your own big, bad, and scary pictures into the user's profile), it's a fugging operating system -- the last place anyone wants to see any sort of looney tampering around with.

Mate i can appreciate that. This a full retail legit copy that i simply marked with my own installation back round. As i am sure you can see from the 1300+ comments there is nothing else touched but the installation. Except i did remove the initial need for a key to install. I am not being a ass but my release has been the biggest on the net, and not one person has reported a issue with any funny software. All major sites sporting torrents my Windows 8 torrent is Number 1. As i said i am not being a ass, or vein i am simply saying i don't appreciate the accusation of me tampering with other files. I was a trusted member here, had a disagreement with a mod and got heated thus my status was removed, but i should earn it back soon. Point in note is, if you seriously think this is fishy after all the work i have done, and all the success it has obtained then simply go download a  untouched unmarked Windows 8 Iso.  I take pride in my releases as well as my artwork, as you can see with all my releases. You will always see Hallowenpsycho Pics on all my releases , as i am truly that. A Psycho :) Take care"

injection may be the wrong term as well. As i injected nothing into the Operating system, all i did was change a couple of files.And Any way they are very simple for someone that knows hot to change them to do so, takes about 2 minutes. :) O and i also added all oems  for all PC brands, which means upon boot your PC will load your default PC background Example: Dell, Hp, Acer, Asus, etc..So here is what to expect with my version. Upon installation of the Windows 8, you will see my load screens, marking this windows 8 as my release. You can expect your Windows to run correctly and with the least hiccups. You can expect your PC to load the correct background for your PC. As well you can expect to have a full activated legit copy of Windows 8 , and Wmc as i constantly update the serials, instead of needing a program such as Kms you will only need to Activate with Legit key that can only be Blocked and not Blacklisted. You can expect continued support from me and from those knowledgeable of the issues you may be facing. All in all, i want you to have the best experience possible, and i believe you will.

Yes as long as you are using it as  a dual boot were both boots can be accessed or chosen upon initial boot of the system.
Well to be honest when i made the iso i did not select UDf, which was, my mistake as i was in a  rush so trying to use Windows 7 usb/Dvd tool will not allow you to make the Bootable image. Power ISO can make the image for you. I would suggest Power ISO, now if you would like the full version you can download my torrent here and use one of the serials provided to make it a legit update-able copy.
https://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8501267/Power_Iso
But note these are serials only. I usually never include a software with my uploads unless it needs a crack, and then normally i just make them portable. So you will need to go to Poweriso.com
and download there free trial. Upon first run just choose to enter serial, and you should be good to go with full update able copy :) Now if you need help wit making the ISO please let me know. :)"

So he told me a couple months ago that he would think about reinstating my trusted status in a couple months so i pmed him and just asked him about it and i received this nice little reply 
Enough. We do not give skulls to people who hustle for them.

Do not ask me or any other member of staff about this again. 

So i am appealing to the higher ups and asking what the issue is. I am sick and tired of this Shit and being treated like a asshole. I have only tried to help people and provide good uploads, and all of this because i asked one night why i was kicked from chat and Soda replied With a nasty remark to get over myself and move on, and Everybodylies

I get some nasty stuff from a VIP member downing my uploads. I asked to have it removed and Everybodylies was the one to reply and said no. That i didn't mind. But for what he said about me before i told him what i thought of him. Next day my Trusted status was gone and a Smiley face from Everybodylies on my new torrent. And it took me a month to find out who removed it. Finally staff told me it was Soda. I pmed and asked him about it nicely. And he fed me the crap i was not trustworthy and he would reconsider reinstating my status in a couple months which i knew was a lie. And now, here i am. I tried to be nice and polite, but screw them. All this was done for spite! I may not have a account after this so if i disappear from tpb look for me at p2pdl.com some damn nice people there.

This is a big issue with windows 8. Hopefully Ms will have a fix for it soon. I can only suggest running a repair with the disc, or by pressing F8 during pc boot to enter into recovery options. Hope this helps"
,ThaStunna,2013-06-01T13:00Z,"@yoheena  

Halloweenpsycho posted a link of a new windows 8 that you dont have to make a disk for. when you download it. It has a setup menu. and here's the cool thing when you upgrade or re install window 8 non of your your programs get deleted. its as if you were on windows 7 and upgraded to windows 8 without starting over. and having to get back all the stuff you lost. but what im trying to say is to get the newest link of windows 8 from Halloweenpsycho. the one you dont need a disk. download it. and install it. think of it repairing the damage. windows 8 should be running like new again. 

i had the same problem i think yesterday 5-30-13. when i signed into the pc. The desktop. every thing was gone. when i took my mouse to the corners of the screen nothing happened i was stuck in just black. i could only see my mouse. i shut down the pc like 3 times. nothing again and again. then i made a desktop icon on the task-bar and clicked on it. went to user , downloads , i found the file that had windows 8 setup. did it over again. then i had to wait for Halloweenpsycho to post up new keys to activate it.  its the last link he posted in the comments. that has everything you need yo finish the job.

but yeah mine is working awesome have not had a problem yet. got all updates. working good!  sorry for long message. lol"
,travelermatt,2013-06-01T14:18Z,"I would just like to add that I too had the black screen with cursor issue. 

Doing a little trouble shooting I found the cause to be one of the windows updates, Im afraid i cant be clear as to which one yet, but the solution for me was to clean install and turn off updates until this issue is resolved.

has been working for 3 months now. hope this sheds a little light onto the situation."

Hi bro, great work on the upload. 

quick question, when i try to do the phone activation on skype, i dial the number and instantly disconnects saying number incorrect or barred. 
i am from the uk but currently living in new zealand, do you think the problem is because i am calling UK number from outside the UK?  

thanks again!"
,KonZ3N,2013-06-01T15:43Z,"@yoheena
I had that experienced w/ Windows 8 Pro 64-bit too. I just restart my pc then voila, its all good again. I got that problem when I haven't bought a good UPS PC got hit by strong fluctuate w/ electricity. Then last thing you I know, start PC then that black thing w/ cursor only appears. I guess my HDD got hit w/ the whole OS thing corrupted I guess."
,Halloweenpsycho,2013-06-01T16:10Z,"@travelermatt
Possible..Just use the number for your country :) Let me know how it goes."
,Pandasaur,2013-06-02T02:30Z,"@Nexusxxx Gtfo, why are you hating on Halloween? He's only been doing good on thepiratebay.

Concerning the black screen issue, check if you have avast installed. If you do, you can uninstall it or follow these steps.
Start your computer and log in to your windows 8 OS
After you login with your password or a direct login with out password as usually you will get a black screen if you have an installed avast anti-virus
press ctrl+alt+del and choose task manager , you can also do it by pressing  ctrl+shift+Esc .
Go to startup tab in Task manager and right-click your avast! Antivirus there and choose  Open file location.
A window will open and click on AvastUI  this will open avast user interface .
Now go to security >Behavior Shield > Settings.
security >Behavior Shield > Settings. and click on  Trusted Processes
Add the following 2  files by browsing them to this paths C:Windowsexplorer.exe and C:WindowsImmersiveControlPanelSystemSettings.exe"
,alxxpally,2013-06-02T03:22Z,"Thank you, Halloweenpsycho. I followed the steps you provided from the new link posted with keys. First time Windows 8 user and hopefully I'd enjoy the OS. I got it permanently activated. To hell with WMC. I'd rather play movies via VLC. Kudos! :p"

Pumpkin.  You have the same sob story every time i turn around. I just received pm back from Mod that i just need to chill out and i will receive my trusted status back, which is good news. So that's what i am doing. As for Soda i don't like him, he don't like me end of story.
I don't know were you get the inkling that i linked people to your comments and asked them to go after you. I believe what was said was simply hey guys check out this guys comments, it is totally amusing. You can search the comments here to see that comment for yourself. As for what you call my ""sob story"" as you put it. There is no sob story, i was informing people of what the staff were doing, well not staff but Soda in general. Fans? I wouldn't say fans, i would say it correctly put as supporters. You seem to be leaning toward me as a vein person, which you couldn't be more wrong. I didn't make me, the people who support me have given me that privilege of being well known in which i could never thank them enough. You seem to be a sour bitter person, but if i had nothing better to do than set and troll others torrents i would be bitter too. You need a life, and maybe a Hug. Call my Mum, she will give ya a hug. I mean for a while you were amusing, but you just got really boring. You talk about quality uploads? I mean seriously are you blind, you really posted that on a torrent with over 1400 comments ? Listen, simply put if you don't like my uploads tell someone who cares. For me, i am done with these conversations with you, so reply all you like but talking to yourself is going to get lonely pretty quick. Take care, and best of luck to ya.  "
,Halloweenpsycho,2013-06-02T11:09Z,"You guys are all very welcome. And thank you all for your support, and the continued seeding of this torrent. With you guys it will live on. I will continue to update and maintain the serials for all of you. God bless. Take care all."
,Halloweenpsycho,2013-06-02T12:01Z,"Oh..and guys dont for get to join me at p2pdl.com nice upcoming torrent site, very friendly people and good atmosphere :) My name is the same on their, hope to see you all there.
And just to update you all on the new serials i am re posting the link.

,bigdawg74,2013-06-03T17:17Z,is there an ETA on new serials? I've tried every one and they all say expired. Or maybe tell me how the serials are created and I can generate one that only I know. Thanks for the great torrent btw!!!
,bigdawg74,2013-06-03T17:21Z,"every serial says ""expired"". will there be more serials posted or is it possible to generate one myself so I know that it won't be expired?"
,Halloweenpsycho,2013-06-04T00:38Z,is everyone having the issue with the serials being expired? let me know. i will get on some new ones :) thanks all.
,Vanteezie,2013-06-04T00:56Z,"I've been trying to get this activated for close to a month. I've logged on just a few minutes after you posting the new codes, and they were always expired.

If you're having trouble please follow the link that Nexus posted, it got me activated in a matter of minutes.

Thanks Halloween for the killer copy of Windows 8, but bad job on the activation."
,Halloweenpsycho,2013-06-04T02:04Z,"just ignore the child below, with his wonderful technology of kms. Kms is used for business and schools to maintain a copy of windows activation on for 180 day period where as if they have a employee leave there software will become deactivated. This kid below you has been trolling my torrents for like 4 months now..lol... As for his big non trusted remark, i was trusted and will be again, had a issue with a staff member and it went over board. But that's in the past and i am moving on with that, no need to harp on it. Anyway, just ignore him as i do seems to really be getting under his skin.lol. As for the serials what issue are you having exactly? what is the error saying? Hit me back."
,Halloweenpsycho,2013-06-04T02:56Z,"@Vanteezie
Sorry to here you have had such a issue, but you got to realize i have a ton of people using these keys, and they usually last for about 10 activations each. Sorry to hear you had to use that lame kms. Since you have had such a issue with this, i would like you to get the best you can, with permanent activation. So if you would like to go to p2pdl.com and leave me a message under i am under the same name, i will be sure to get you a reserved key. Again sorry you have had many issues mate. Take care, and hit me back :)"

@stircr 

Many of the comments reveal that a multitude of people have the same issue as you.

If your method of activating Windows 8 means waiting indefinitely for hit or miss serials from a non-trusted uploader you need to rethink your strategy.

***************************************
Activate Windows 8 How-To Guide:
***************************************

Download Microsoft Toolkit:
http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8322107/Microsoft_Toolkit_2.4.3_Official_Torrent

Run program > Windows > EZ-Activate > DONE! ACTIVATED!

This uses KMS activation (volume licensing through Microsoft). It is entirely offline, doesn't require the Internet or for you to place phone calls. You can backup/restore activation and safely use Windows Update.

My copy of Win8 has been activated since October 2012. MS Toolkit takes care of the entire process and re-activates for you.

Enjoy!

@Vanteezie enjoy :)

(Side note, removing my comments is childish behavior. Act like an adult.)"
,Halloweenpsycho,2013-06-04T07:39Z,Seems serials have all ran out..I will work on some and get them out asap.. :)
