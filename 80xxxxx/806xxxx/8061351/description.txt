The Triffids were hailed by the British music media as "one of the most influential and important bands to come from Australia" and their 1985 album Born Sandy Devotional, has more than contributed to their legacy. Led by singer and songwriter David McComb, The Triffids formed in Perth in 1978 and soon relocated to London, achieving popularity throughout Europe and becoming the first Australian group to feature on the cover of New Musical Express. On the album Born Sandy Devotional, McComb's literary and haunting songs reflected upon the sheer size of the Australian landscape, which in turn mirrored his complicated emotional life.

The single Wide Open Road' was the group's first Top Ten hit and the album led to The Triffids being signed to a major label; but more than ten years of a nomadic existence were beginning to take their toll on McComb, who died in Melbourne in 1999.
