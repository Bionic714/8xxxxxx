Additional Notes:



I first heard this group on a skate video called "The Adventures Of Mr. Mooseknuckle" and was hooked. Shortly after that I found out a friend of mine actually had the CD and he let me borrow it. Sadly, he moved away and I never got to give it back to him (and another CD of his too. Sorry John). I searched high and low on the internet and was not able to find what I would call an "acceptable" copy of this when I was ripping my collection so I thought I would put one up myself. Thanks to the power of EAC I was able to rip the album before it was totally unreadable. 


Oh yeah, the producer "B-Zar" featured on this is actually that actor/producer guy Balthazar Getty. Crazy.



Anyway, enjoy!   NBD DWAI JS
