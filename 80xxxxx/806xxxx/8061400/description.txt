SUITS ΓÇ£Blood in the WaterΓÇ¥ Season 2 Episode 12 airs Thursday Jan 24 at 10/9c pm on USA.

Episode Synopsis: The war with Daniel may be over, but the battle has left Pearson Hardman vulnerable, and Harvey must protect the firm from a rival whose attack seems as personal as it is professional.

Show Summary: ΓÇ£SuitsΓÇ¥ delves into the fast-paced, high-stakes world of a top Manhattan corporate law firm where Macht stars as legendary law partner, Harvey Specter, and SAG Award-nominee Adams stars as his brilliant, but not-technically-legal associate Mike Ross. Despite his lack of bonafide credentials, MikeΓÇÖs photographic memory and encyclopedic legal knowledge make him an invaluable asset to Harvey.

The dynamic duo have managed to guard the secret thus far, but as the first season came to a close, MikeΓÇÖs future hangs in the balance when his ex-best friend sets out to expose him to the firmΓÇÖs top suit, Jessica Pearson (Torres).

But, Jessica could have bigger problems on her hands when the other half of Pearson Hardman, Daniel (guest star David Costabile) reemerges on the scene. Meanwhile, MikeΓÇÖs love life has become complicated after he crossed the line with the firmΓÇÖs best paralegal and his only friend in the office, Rachel (Markle). In addition to Costabile, guest stars for the season include Eric Close, John Finn, Margo Martindale and Rachel Harris.
