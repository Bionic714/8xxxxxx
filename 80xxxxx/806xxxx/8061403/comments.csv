,taz420nj,2013-01-29T09:18Z,You can tell just by the file sizes that this is garbage - unless you intend to watch it on a phone or something.
,taz420nj,2013-01-31T16:57Z,"Oh wow.  So I D/L'd an episode just to see..  And yeah..  320x240 low bitrate garbage.  Not only that, they are TV recordings..  And not only THAT, but this dumbass has watermarked the video with spam links to his site. Do not bother with this.  It needs to be nuked."
,verified-vidz,2013-02-03T05:49Z,taz then dont download it!! someone will find it useful
,taz420nj,2013-02-05T13:37Z,"Yeah maybe someone back in 2001.  These things are awful quality, reminiscent of the KVCD movie rips that nobody uses anymore..  Seriously, Why 320x240??  Why not at LEAST 640x480?"
,taz420nj,2013-02-05T13:40Z,"Oh and that's besides the fact that you put WATERMARK SPAM TO YOUR SITE ALL OVER THE VIDEO, YOU DUMBASS!  Only lame turds with impotence problems do that."
