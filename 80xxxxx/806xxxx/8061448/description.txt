Panzer Front is still considered among many tank enthusiasts to be the greatest tank game ever made. This torrent contains the bin file, so it should work on the PSX emulator. Not sure if it could be burned, but then I am no tech expert.

I have taken it upon myself to preserve and spread the joy of this increasingly rare game. I am currently working on getting a hold of the sequel, Panzer Front Ausf.b for PS2, which was a Europe/Japan only release.

Please enjoy this tank simulator and seed. If it doesn't work then post a comment please and I will try to fix it with my limited knowledge of computers.
