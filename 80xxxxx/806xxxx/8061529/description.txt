#314 - Ian Edwards, Brian Redban

Ian Edwards (born in Batswana on February 11, 1972) is a stand up comedian. He has appeared on Family Guy, Live at Gotham, and HBO's Bad Boys of Comedy. He can be seen weekly at the Laugh Factory in Los Angeles. On August 1, Gilbert Arenas used one of Edwards' jokes on his popular blog. This has created some controversy as Arenas did not cite Edwards in the same entry. However, Arenas credited him on the next entry, two days later.

Edwards was born in England and has lived in Jamaica, New York, and California. When he was 21, he stopped working the drive-thru at Burger King to try his hand at comedy. Since then, he's appeared on Def Comedy Jam (twice) and Show Time at the Apollo. He's written for Saturday Night Live, the Lyricist Lounge show on MTV, The Boondocks for the Cartoon Network, etc., and is currently a cast member of the fifth season of Punk'd on MTV.
