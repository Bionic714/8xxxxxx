Let's Active sort of fell apart during the British tour for Cypress when Sara Romweber's unexpected exit disrupted the band and their "collective effort" feel. Rather than attempting to find a replacement, Mitch Easter opted to retreat into the studio and focus on music for the next record, and, from Big Plans for Everybody on, Let's Active became more or less a Mitch Easter studio project. This new definition didn't really hamper the record, but the changes were certainly noticeable. First of all, records made in 1986 sound very different from records made in 1984, and this is no exception. The new wave-ish flourishes and kinda-retro feel were removed in favor of a more straightforward, mainstream production. Easter's lyrics seem more universal while at the same time more personal and introspective than on previous records, though no less catchy. That, combined with the more organic arrangements, led to a highly rewarding album that, despite its many connections to the time, remains an album unfairly ignored


ΓÇ£Mitch Easter carved his place in music history as a hip producer in the '80s, most notably for the early R.E.M. albums Murmur and Reckoning; unfortunately, these achievements often overshadowed and distracted him from giving his full commitment to his own recording career with Let's Active, a band that, between 1983 and 1988, released some of the finest Southern power-pop/jangle-pop of the decade.
After a short stint with the Sneakers, a band he formed with future dB's Chris Stamey in North Carolina in the late '70s, Mitch Easter set up his legendary Drive-In Studios in 1981 and formed Let's Active with bassist Faye Hunter and drummer Sara Romweber. The trio released a six-song EP, 1983's Afoot, on IRS Records. In 1984, the band released the more experimental Cypress. While the EP and album sold modestly, they found a strong following in the emerging alternative/"college rock" audience. Hunter and Romweber left shortly after the release, leaving Let's Active as essentially a solo project for Easter. Romweber later went on to join Snatches of Pink.
Easter recruited drummers Eric Marshall and Rob Ladd, along with multi-instrumentalist Angie Carlson (Hunter returned temporarily for bass duties) for Big Plans For Everybody in 1986, another critically praised yet commercially undervalued album. The harder-edged Every Dog Has His Day, which replaced Hunter with a full-time bassist, John Heames, was released in 1988. Following a small-scale promotional tour of college campuses, the band hung in limbo -- no subsequent albums were recorded. Easter has continued producing into the '90s while infrequently playing with other bands, including Velvet Crush and Vinyl Devotion.ΓÇ¥ (From AllMusicGuide).
