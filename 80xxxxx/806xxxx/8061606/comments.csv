,HEzooL,2013-01-25T11:23Z,"Well, I for one wanna thank you sceneline, since I don't like to watch sd anymore, now that I get the choice of hd. Sure it could've been compressed to 1.02-1.24gb as other episodes seem to be in size, but it's just silly getting pissed with the fact hd requires more space."
,.Leto.,2013-01-25T12:26Z,"@HEzooL: this isn't about space. Some of us can only download x GB per month, so we're careful about what we download. This isn't a movie, this isn't a TV series, this a TALK-SHOW, there's really no need for high-res for this!!"

TIA"
