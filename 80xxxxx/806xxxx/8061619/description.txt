Four years in the making, SuperFreakonomics asks not only the tough questions, but the unexpected ones: What's more dangerous, driving drunk or walking drunk? Why is chemotherapy prescribed so often if it's so ineffective? Can a sex change boost your salary?



SuperFreakonomics challenges the way we think all over again, exploring the hidden side of everything with such questions as:




    How is a street prostitute like a department-store Santa?

    Why are doctors so bad at washing their hands?

    How much good do car seats do?

    What's the best way to catch a terrorist?

    Did TV cause a rise in crime?

    What do hurricanes, heart attacks, and highway deaths have in common?

    Are people hard-wired for altruism or selfishness?

    Can eating kangaroo save the planet?

    Which adds more value: a pimp or a Realtor?
