sorry"
,Yobhtron,2013-01-25T07:25Z,Thank you very much dhjudasx!
,lochin,2013-01-25T08:44Z,please The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian and The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader too..I already have trilogy on 720p..but the quality is bad..plasee..I very like yours rip..thanks
,stativarius,2013-01-26T22:03Z,"Thanks for all the great rips!  Been with you since the first, Captain America.  You give it all: 1080p, DTS, Subs, small size and even Chapters while almost every movie is a must-have.

Can't stand YIFY, anoXmous and their stereo-only downloads.  This is 2013, our home theaters beg for exemplary audial resonance and our hard drives can stand the paltry 100 MB hit.

Your work is highly appreciated!"
,pro346pro,2013-01-27T00:20Z,Actually anoxmous has 384k 5.1 swell as stereo now....no disrespect to the up loader.
,eroticburps,2013-01-27T10:06Z,"anoXmous is known for his 1080p encodes and now he too has started encoding movies in a 6 channel audio.. he's doing a great job.
seems like dhjudasx and anoXmous are the  real thing here who cater to people as per their needs in terms of audio and video. you guys Kill It.. way to go!"
,g01851,2013-01-28T17:39Z,Thanks for all the great vids you post... I use you as my first 'go to' if I'm looking for a movie :)
,g01851,2013-01-28T18:07Z,"anoxmous hasn't uploaded anything in a year, unless he's using a new handle now."
,g01851,2013-01-28T18:10Z,"oops NVM... seems there's a diff between 'anoxmous' and 'anoXmous' in a search!  In any case, he seems to do much more 720p rips with lower audio quality..."
,pro346pro,2013-01-29T08:46Z,anoxmous is still doing uploads hes the ripper zen bud is the uploader!
,Naralli15,2013-03-08T03:56Z,"Perfect, thanks so much! Played this with VLC and experienced no problems. There are 2 audio files so you can pick the one that best suits you.
