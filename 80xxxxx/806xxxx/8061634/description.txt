DESCRIPTION:

A different way of discovering and developing the best business ideas

Jack Welch once said, "Someone, somewhere has a better idea." In this myth-busting book, the authors reveal that great business ideas do not spring from innate creativity, or necessarily from the brilliant minds of people. 
Rather, great ideas come to those who are in the habit of looking for great ideas all around them, all the time. Too often, people fall into the trap of thinking that the only worthwhile idea is a thoroughly original one. 
Idea Hunters know better. They understand that valuable ideas are already out there, waiting to be found - and not just in the usual places.

ΓÇó Shows how to expand your capacity to find and develop winning business ideas

ΓÇó Explains why ideas are a critical asset for every manager and professional, not just for those who do "creative"

ΓÇó Reveals how to seek out and select the ideas that best serve your purposes and goals and define who you are, as a professional

ΓÇó Offers practical tips on how to master the everyday habits of an Idea Hunter, which include cultivating great conversations

The book is filled with illustrative accounts of successful Idea Hunters and stories from thriving "idea" companies. Warren Buffet, Walt Disney, Thomas Edison, Mary Kay Ash, Twitter, and Pixar Animation Studios are among the many profiled.
