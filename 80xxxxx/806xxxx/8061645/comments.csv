,WideSide,2013-01-26T21:02Z,How do you get the exports (like to iOS) to work?
,VeryC,2013-01-27T00:08Z,"I did not make the crack, I merely distributed it here on tpb with my own updater. I found the crack here: http://forum.cgpersia.com/f19/game-maker-studio-53522/"
,N4o7A,2013-01-29T21:59Z,Thank you sir for the torrent!
,VeryC,2013-02-08T04:05Z,"I have just uploaded the latest update for GMS, the next time you start game maker it will request you to upgrade.

Happy Pirating ;)"
,nfsmaster,2013-02-08T18:20Z,"when i have installed gamemaker, there is this updatezip and the gamemaker-studio exe + some extra files..
but the problem is i cannot install gamemaker as windows says i don't have rights to open the file even though i have tried anything to get it to work.. i checked all right etc..
really dont know what the problem is.."
,VeryC,2013-02-09T01:03Z,"@nfsmaster, Where have you installed GameMaker? I highly recommend installing it to the default folder C:UsersUSERNAMEAppDataRoamingGameMaker-Studio

And also what os are you using?"
,nfsmaster,2013-02-13T12:25Z,"fixed it now.. complete delete and redownload.

btw when is version 1.1.806 coming for us as update?"
,axa993,2013-02-14T14:39Z,"I just wanted to say THANK YOU.
If I create something that might be successful I will buy GMS.

Question: are you planning to ""support"" this release by constantly updating it? That would be... Simply awesome."
,VeryC,2013-02-16T10:08Z,"I do plan on continuing support for it, i have already uploaded the first update. I do plan on supporting this as long as possible. I will probably upload a new update within the next 24 hours. "
,nfsmaster,2013-02-18T10:34Z,"where do you get the upgradezips? is this something we can do by ourself, to ease your work?"
,axa993,2013-02-18T15:56Z,I would appreciate the updates as this is the best GM:S torrent I have found on the internet. Updates would be awesome so I don't have to run around chasing updates...
,VeryC,2013-02-18T22:57Z,"There is no way of obtaining the updates except by directly from me, this is because i have some things that i have programmed into the upgrades that is required for the updates. Everyone should be receiving updates automatically through my update tool. At this point everyone should be on v.1.1.805 If you are not on this version, let me know. It should prompt you to update when you start GM:S."
,VeryC,2013-02-18T23:01Z,"Ohh and i forgot to mention, there will be a new version of my tools that will be released very soon. It will be a manual update. I will only be including the tools to update GM:S. So the update will probably only be about 2 mb to download."
,nfsmaster,2013-02-20T19:27Z,V1.1.827 is released from yoyogames.. will it be this update coming for us? and when?
,VeryC,2013-02-21T04:00Z,"I will be releasing 1.1.827 very soon, i am working on changing some things to the updater, this way i can tell people when a manual update is required. I am saying in the next 24-48 hours. So this will be a manual patch, but you will only have to download the launcher this time, which is only about 2mb."
,Bkid001,2013-02-22T19:49Z,"It took forever and a day to update after install (at least on a crappy hotel connection :P), but after that it was GREAT.

This is the most SOLID release of GMS we've seen yet, and your auto-updater included is quit nice. I can finally export APKs to test apps before I actually purchase GMS."
,VeryC,2013-02-22T23:35Z,"I am not quite finished with the manual patch yet, so i will be releasing an update to 1.1.827 in about an hour.

The manual patch fixes some issues that may occur in the future and also will notify you if a manual patch is needed and give you a link where you can download it.

oh and btw Bkid001, i myself only get 700 kb download. And the updates on average are 100 mb, so it should take less then 10 minutes on a good connection."
,Bkid001,2013-02-23T02:05Z,"@VeryC

I'm sure it'll be better when I get home. :P"
,nfsmaster,2013-02-23T09:27Z,"is the update uploaded? 
I didn't get notified when i started GMS a minute ago"
,C0nflikt,2013-02-25T20:29Z,"Um, am I the only one who detects the Win32.poison trojan in this torrent?  The GMS executable comes up as infected in Kaspersky after you install the program."
,promade,2013-02-26T21:41Z,Nice software ! Thank you :) 
,VeryC,2013-02-28T04:11Z,"I am sorry to everyone, i have been sick with strep and have not been feeling up to anything, i am starting to feel better and will just be releasing the next update with the manual patch. As for you C0nflikt, you would be the only person getting this. Or at least the only one to notice this. I would just recomend uninstalling Kaspersky, and going with something lighter such as Security Essentials which i have never had any problems with."
,axa993,2013-03-03T13:19Z, @C0nflikt: Install Avast and enjoy.
,nfsmaster,2013-03-10T20:59Z,"no update yet..?
the newest from yoyogames is 1.1.867.. my launcher is only running 1.1.805..

when are we gonna get the newest version?"
,HighOnPsi,2013-03-13T07:39Z,Is this currently supporting iOS and Android exports?
,nfsmaster,2013-03-13T16:51Z,"@HighOnPsi

Yes, this version supports every module, including android and iOS.

But beware that it is currently outdated."
,axa993,2013-03-18T16:49Z,"OK, it would be nice if we got the promised update... Can you at least point us to any other location where we can get updates by ourselves?"
,VeryC,2013-03-19T17:16Z,"I am very sorry about the update not being up yet, I have a lot of work to do at this time. The next update will be a manual update, I will be uploading the torrent asap. I hope you all understand this. After this next update all future updates should be released within 24-48 hours of yoyo releasing ther update."
,VeryC,2013-03-22T21:51Z,"Manual Patch Has Been Uploaded!!!

You can get it here: http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8288568/GameMaker-Studio_1.1.867_Manual_Patch

This is just to satisfy your crave until i finish the next version of the updater.

-veryc-"
,RaythXC,2013-03-24T20:58Z,"I downloaded this, installed it, then ran the manual patch (without changing any settings), and when I run GM Studio and open a tutorial or new project, it comes up with an error. The window then disappears but it stays in the task bar. I have to close the process directly in order to re-open and it keeps happening.

Ideas?"
,RaythXC,2013-03-25T02:02Z,"This is my error:

""Unable to create directory"""
,VeryC,2013-03-25T09:05Z,"RaythC, make sure you can run GMS before you do the manual patch. After try applying the 
manual patch. Get back to me with the results."
,RaythXC,2013-03-25T18:14Z,"Ok I done as you suggested.

 GM Studio ran fine & opened the new project when I ran it first time. After running the upgrade it came up with the error"
,VeryC,2013-03-26T09:38Z,What did the error say?
,van0014,2013-03-26T16:19Z,"Just to clarify, to compile games for IOS or Android, you need to download the associated SDK otherwise it won't work."
,van0014,2013-03-26T16:24Z,"@raythXC Ive had this happen before, ad its very frustrating. But it might be your security permissions. Make sure you can create and delete files in game makers temporary directory.

Its odd, but sometimes my security settings get messed up. I assume i have a virus, but i also have avast. I thought it should pick up viruses as soon as their downloaded."
,RaythXC,2013-03-26T17:27Z,"@VeryC: It says ""unable to create directory""

@van0014: I'm not trying to create the project in my AppData folder. It says it can't make it in ""Documents"""
,VeryC,2013-03-26T22:41Z,"It sounds more like a permissions problem. Try to download my portable edition that I just uploaded here: 
http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8304543/GameMaker-Studio_1.1.867_Portable_Edition"
,RaythXC,2013-03-27T17:33Z,"Problem is definitely with v1.1.867.

This version runs fine, but both the update to 867 AND the portable version (after removing the other one) both come up with the same ""Unable to Create Directory"" error and close.

When I check the location, the directory is there, and I can make directories manually.

The error also occurs if I run it in administrator mode."
,RaythXC,2013-04-02T01:19Z,"Does anyone know howto export to Android? When I got the SDK the latest android version is 4.2 and GMS says I need to have the 3.2 API, which the SDK manager wont let me dl"
,THEMAN7,2013-04-07T03:09Z,This is shown as a virus on my computer but runs perfectly fine. Beware
,flintp,2013-04-09T00:10Z,"I also get the unable to make directory error after installing the manual 867 update even if I run it as administrator. I have tried making projects in different directories, none work. I'll try it on my other computer later."
,braffolk,2013-04-09T22:18Z,guys lets move on to this http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8312617/GameMaker-Studio_1.1.872_Portable_Edition its never.
,VeryC,2013-04-12T22:45Z,"NEW VERSION SOON!!!

I will be uploading v1.1.913 in 3-5 hours. I will release more details when I get it uploaded."
,VeryC,2013-04-14T06:08Z,"Latest version 1.1.917 Is out, i have the latest auto updater uploaded and ready for download.

DITCH THIS TORRENT!!!

http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8371172/GameMaker-Studio_1.1.917_With_Auto-Updater_V2"
,VeryC,2013-05-02T03:36Z,"Ok, so some news. This is the recomended torrent to download for the time being. As soon as i go through the beta of my new launcher and everything runs fine for people. You will all be forced to move to the new version. You will recieve a update notification, after updating you will recieve a message telling you that you need to download the new launcher. From there this version will never work again."
,kjerooni,2013-05-15T22:38Z,"Which is better: GameMaker Studio, or GameMaker 8.1 pro?"
,xXxZombinexXx,2013-05-18T06:04Z,Here is a working one with no errors but its an older version: https://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8480332/Radical_Studios_Torrents_-_GameMaker__Studio_1.1.929
,xhizors,2013-05-19T06:57Z,"@VeryC: Your launcher is a piece of shit. It should just LAUNCH what it needs to instead of telling people they need to come here to update and then not launch anything... It's a fucking launcher, how hard is that to understand?"
,xhizors,2013-05-19T06:58Z,"Don't bother wasting your time with this garbage, it doesn't run because his ""launcher"" won't let it run."
,VeryC,2013-05-28T06:29Z,"Ok I know there are a lot of complaints going about right now, please keep in mind that I got back from Google I/O a few days ago and have not had much time to do much. I will also be going to Microsoft Build next month.

 The reason why downloads are not working anymore is because I have exceeded my bandwidth by quite a bit. As in 126 Gigs.

 Right now YoYo is going through the odd transition between the 1.1.xxx versions to the 1.2.xxx versions. So I am holding off on releasing the last auto updater.

 And there is a lot greater advantage to using a auto updater then manual uploads. The rate that yoyo can release updates is astounding at times. Its just simpler to just create a updater that does all the work for me. I don't have a very fast upload speed, and when you have pure leechers who grab the latest version quickly and aren't decent enough to seed there share. If I am just uploading a new update file to my server whenever there is a update I use less bandwidth and you receive the update faster.

 Now for some other news, I will start uploading regular install versions until the auto updater is perfected. I will need people who are willing to help with this as I have no way of telling how the updater will work in your environment.
