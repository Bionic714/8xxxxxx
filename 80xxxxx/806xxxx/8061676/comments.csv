,alejandro70pb,2013-01-25T20:42Z,GRACIAS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,nonsentence,2013-01-25T21:26Z,Thank you so much!  I look forward to listening to this tonight.
,Maxpayne33,2013-01-27T01:21Z,"80z:  When we collect the music we love, there's a sense of Completion that we must achieve.  As a Radio and Club DJ in the New Wave era of 80-85 in the U.S., my goal was to own the very songs that come back to my subconscious years later.  When we find these LPs, they are equal to a Musical Holy Grail.  When we are granted TWO at once, it truly is a magnificent gesture from a kindred spirit.  THANK YOU for these and, while I think you provided a few songs from the Producers over the years, this is the first time I've seen the complete first LP offered.  Time to turn up the volume all around the world!  There are two gems here, for sure, and based on your track record, two more to discover for the first time."
,dragonbandit314,2013-01-27T17:19Z,"Maxpayne33, NOT exactly the way I would have said it ... but you are totally correct.
80z, as always, I look forward to the next installment of my education. A lot of the artists from the UK are a wonderful reminder. So many of the non UK artists are new to me. Many thanks, from this side of the pond. Be well. T."
,80spreferred,2013-01-28T00:57Z,"Thanks80z.  Looks like another cool contribution to the so many I've never heard of.  Always love the artwork.  Takes me back to ""that 80s look"".
What software do you use to assemble and clean the files?"
[V],80zforever,2013-01-29T06:39Z,"Hi everyone. thanks for commenting. I am really hoping this archive lasts a while.

80spreferred, I am using a software called Trans Music Manager to assemble etc. but I am not cleaning the rips anymore as it takes away the natural sound of vinyl. Instead I re invested in buying mint and sealed copies of those LPs I really loved and upgraded the rips."
,8675309,2013-01-29T07:27Z,Awesome!
,Maxpayne33,2013-01-29T21:35Z,"Had such a great weekend reliving these great musical moments, thanks again!  Just ran across ""Everywhere That I'm Not"" by Translator.  Any chance you have any of their stuff?  Thanks again for the great work you do and, yes, the Archive will live on!"
,smurphyzeke,2013-02-02T05:32Z,"Thanks. Able to download as I'm home. One of the best parts is coming home and seeing a new upload by you, 80zforever."
,Ianp,2013-02-15T14:20Z,"Hello ""80's"", would there be any chance of seeding this one again please? It is Rare , but a classic.

,digitalpress,2013-04-24T14:48Z,"WHERE HAVE YOU GONE, 80zforever? This hiatus has been way too long, we miss your contributions! Hope all is well."
[V],80zforever,2013-05-09T08:36Z,"digitalpress, thanks for checking on me! all is good but I just think people have had enough of me and the music I post LOL, otherwise there's still some more rarities to share. be well and thx again"
,digitalpress,2013-05-11T14:59Z,"But you're 80z FOREVER! I don't know why anyone would tire of what you do and this is a bad thread to prove that as I doubt many people check back in on comments from a torrent they've already raided. I continue to seed every one of your ""Rare Hits"" and ""4 Rare Album"" torrents and see lots of people grabbing them on a daily basis. I truly hope you come back or find another outlet for sharing your collection with us. Thanks for everything you've done for your fans!"
,dragonbandit314,2013-05-15T00:05Z,"Yes 80z, we, the faithful, keep coming back. Just in case you have provided another superb offering.
Be well."
