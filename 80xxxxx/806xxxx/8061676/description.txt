Sometimes I have no plans of uploading new stuff, until I pull out a few records and enjoy them so much that I decide to post them or when a request comes along. So we have for download two LPs (The Producers and The Silencers)requested by Maxpayne33 and two others that are my picks. Yachts LP is one of the new LP arrivals of last week, still sealed after 33 years! It's hard to describe the feeling when I opened the shrink. Was it just nostalgia or mourning in loss of our youth and the music of our youth? Oh by the way I think I had posted The Producers in one of this series before or I could be wrong. My apologies if it had been.
