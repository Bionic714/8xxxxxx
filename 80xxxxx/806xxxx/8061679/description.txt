A previous incarnation of the lovely Martha Tilston where she is joined by multi-talented Nick Marshall. Acoustic whimsy of the highest order, Mouse wowed audiences with their dreamy songs and lingalongs. With Martha's voice melding perfectly with Nick's guitar wizzardry they gave many an audience goose-pimply moments. Famous for their intimate late night sets in the candle lit surrounds of the Small World stage, they also featured on the acoustic stage at Glastonbury festival, amongst many other swish venues. Although only 2000 copies of their album "Mouse Tales" were made, it remains a great favourite of those lucky few who own a copy.
