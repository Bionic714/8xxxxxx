so it gets a little tricky starting the game, but it does kick over; got to admit, I wouldn't have downloaded this version if I knew the menus were not in English, & I've tried to change it, but no go. Thanks anyway NZupload, but just a little more info here about the menus would have helped."

If your version of Alpha protocol runs in any other language than English (and if you want the game to switch to English), try the fix below.

    Go to X:UsersUSERNAMEDocumentsAlpha ProtocolAPGameConfigAPEngine (where X: is your system drive, usually C:) and open the APEngine.ini file with a text editor. Scroll to the [Engine.Engine] section and set Language=EN. Save and close the file.

    Go to X:Program FilesSEGA CorporationAlpha ProtocolEngineConfigBaseEngine and Open BaseEngine.ini file with a text editor. Scroll to the [Engine.Engine] section and set Language=EN. Save and close the file. Now start the game."

When you start the autorun, before installing go to configuration > softfare + components > language gui > english"
