,UglyDucklingxyz,2013-01-25T17:43Z,"Could we please also get S11E00 The Road to the Runway, if possible? Thank you very much. "
[T],FatFreddy638,2013-01-25T20:03Z,@UglyDucklingxyz - I was waiting for someone to request that I give more despite already giving what I consider a huge amount.
,Sweep09,2013-01-25T22:17Z,thanks
,Sunrise12,2013-01-25T22:40Z,"Thanks, rkstr!!!!!"
,UglyDucklingxyz,2013-01-25T23:06Z,"Dear rkstr, 

I politely asked if it was possible to get that episode as well. 

Stop acting like I insulted your mother. 

Thanks"
[T],FatFreddy638,2013-01-25T23:51Z,"what you didn't do UglyDucklingxyz was actually show any gratitude for the upload that I provided which in my eyes is very rude.Is ""saying thanks for the upload"" that difficult for you? It might have made your request that much more tolerable"
,prettypiratepete,2013-01-26T08:43Z,Thanks for the upload!! Your efforts are always appreciated rkstr. 
,Yidhra,2013-01-26T12:01Z,Thanks :)
,chernye,2013-01-27T03:10Z,rkstr! thank you so much mate!
,HDfan2,2013-01-27T22:22Z,"i hate this shit bad quality, i wonder where is WEB-DL version? or DIMENSION, INMERSE, CTU, ""RKSTR"" source is the most ruin source."
[T],FatFreddy638,2013-01-28T03:16Z,"@HDfan2 - why don't you source the show,rip it and upload it yourself or find it from any of those uploaders you talk about (and I know you won't) and quit your bitching."
,HDfan2,2013-01-29T01:50Z,pfff lalalalalalalala
,malmo2013,2013-02-01T09:10Z,FYI rkstr is no longer uploading to this site.his account was removed last night.
,HDfan2,2013-02-02T06:18Z,"@malmo2013 

i'm so glad for that :D"
[M],suzitastik,2013-02-02T10:20Z,"His account is active, stop talking shit."
,dbranson17,2013-02-03T03:10Z,"wow... you're even a bigger asshole than before... why don't you get some f*cking medication, loser!"
,dbranson17,2013-02-03T03:14Z,"BTW, that was to FatFreddy638 who is obviously also RKSTR - you just can't copy the  princess bitch comments that come out of both of them

There are 15 other ways to get Project Runway, so stop uploading so we don't have to listen to your 5-year-old whining anymore!"
,malmo2013,2013-02-03T05:17Z,"LOL! Dude calm down.its a torrent site.no wonder the guy left,so much hate! Definitely gone though and not uploading anymore,told me himself on another site."
,HDfan2,2013-02-03T23:36Z,"OMG!  i'm so really, really happy, somebody  is sharing 720p source: Project.Runway.S11E02.720p.HDTV.x264-YesTV"
,Sweep09,2013-02-06T22:47Z,"I for one would like to say that some of the more contrite comments in relation to quality and so on, is starting to grate. I for one gratefully appreciate the provider's efforts and forbearance in the face of generally nasty and just plain mean comments. But most of all I really appreciate the provider's taste in TV shows. If the comments are true that the provider will no longer provide, then it is a sad day for all of us."
