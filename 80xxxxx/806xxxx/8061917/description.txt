Aramaic is a group of Semitic languages with a 3,000-year history. It has been the language of administration of empires and the language of divine worship. It is the original language of large sections of the biblical books of Daniel and Ezra, and is the main language of the Babylonian Talmud. Aramaic remains a literary and liturgical language among Jews, Mandaeans and some Christians, and is still spoken by small isolated communities throughout its original area of influence.
Syriac was originally a local Aramaic dialect in northern Mesopotamia. It was a major language among Christian communities in the Middle East and Central Asia before Arabic, the language of conquering Muslims from the Arabian Peninsula,
became dominant. It is now spoken as a first language in small, scattered communities in Sweden, Syria, Lebanon, Turkey, Iraq, Iran, Israel etc.
