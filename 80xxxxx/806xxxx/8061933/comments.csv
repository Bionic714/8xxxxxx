[T],Tyr3ll,2013-01-25T11:38Z,"Activate.exe has been scanned with four different anti-virus & anti-spyware and we don't found trojan,bro ...
So is it the setup exe as suspect ?

[T],Tyr3ll,2013-01-25T11:39Z,possible false-positive...

Would be nice from your part so.
Thx by advance

[T],Tyr3ll,2013-01-25T14:48Z,"btw,DVDFab can be only registered for one year max.There's not yet lifetime license available from Fantageo.You may get only few months to try and test it so.
This already not so bad and will permit you to make an idea about this soft.
However we do not recommend you to use with DVD files,it performs Blu-ray,mkv and HD video files very well like mts and m2ts files as well and is one the best media player that can detect righly most of subtitles for special movie made with particular structure.
Play very well h.263 movie files like Pot player where PowerDVD fails most of time...
Take your time for test it so.

,chop007,2013-01-25T21:15Z,Works Awesome.
,jqt51,2013-02-18T10:51Z,Very clean. Install software as Admin. Nothing else to do. Instructions keys are not needed. Same for activation (not needed). License valid until 2013-08-03. First class player indeed. Thanks for the download. 
,jqt51,2013-02-18T12:35Z,Just a while before I tried version 1.0.1.5 with the activator. Software didn't work right. So I uninstalled and deleted all files after killing the process. I realised that the activator found here for version 1.0.3.3 is the same as for the previous version. This is why after installing v.1.0.3.3  license time stamp ended up being 2013-08-03 because activator time stamp is 2012-08-03. You can download same software at home site minus the instruction text and the activator.
,jqt51,2013-02-19T00:26Z,Installed as Admin on another computer. Rebooted when prompted to. Launched software(V.1.0.3.3). Accepted firewall access. Yes to be default player. Registered using info in readme text. Did NOT use activator. License valid until 2013-08-03. Works.
