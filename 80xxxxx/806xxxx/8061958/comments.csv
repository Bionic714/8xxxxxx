,abdul86,2013-01-31T00:09Z,"Failed to find a verified ini file for this Xex/SS combination
Verification failed"
,punkfreak123,2013-02-02T05:13Z,"Works fine with flashed Ihas B Verbatim burned with Imgburn.

The game as of 2/1 is also fully verified through abgx. Set your autofix threshold to level 3."
,technorte,2013-02-05T02:22Z,"Works fine but it´s not HD. The graphics are the same of the older versions.

Don´t expect graphics like Goldeneye 007 Reloaded or Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary. 

They are not the same. I was playing Turnig Point: Fall of Liberty an old game from 2007 and it has ""better graphics"".

I wasted  a DVD but it´s not your fault. At least I didn´t paid 40 dollars for it.

Thanks anyway thenoobish."
