Notes:

This Game Collection originally contains 3 Games on 2 DVDs.
Hitman Bloody Money (DVD1) turned out to be the exact same Disc that was
released on the XBOX360 in 2006.
Therefore we decided to not pre DVD1 as its a 100% dupe of a previous
scene release. DVD2 contains the new HD remakes of Hitman 2 and Hitman
Contracts.

Enjoy - Buy the game if you like it!
