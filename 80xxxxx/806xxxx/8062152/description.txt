The Education of Michelle Rhee: Her Legacy of School Reform

Michelle Rhee, the former chancellor of the Washington, D.C., public schools, is one of the most admired and reviled school reformers in America. FRONTLINE was granted unprecedented access to Rhee during her tumultuous three-year tenure as she attempted to fix a broken school system. As Rhee returns to the national stage, FRONTLINE examines her legacy in Washington, D.C., including her battles with the teachers' union and her handling of a cheating scandal in the District.
