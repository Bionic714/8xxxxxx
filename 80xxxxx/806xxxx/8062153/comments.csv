P.S. I'm coming home back on Sunday night, until then I will help seed through my cellphone(thanks to everyone else who helps in keeping my torrents alive). When I get back I will upload new SC-related torrents."

,SoniStreet,2013-01-27T18:30Z,"@Tiraffe You are welcome, please note that I do not take credit for every torrent I will upload, some of them are taken from other sources, however I do check every single file before uploading and reorganizing them.

I have just uploaded the original StarCraft(vanilla) OST in FLAC which I ripped my self. Enjoy!"
,SoniStreet,2013-01-27T18:34Z,P.S. I just purchased 1TB External HDD for the sole purpose of sharing files and upgrade my net speed to 25Mbps UL.
