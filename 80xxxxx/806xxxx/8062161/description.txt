Steering, speeding up, braking, cutting, blocking: who is the smartest driver in this strategic racing game, leaving his opponents behind and passing the finishing line first?

Dash Race is the electronic version of a popular turn-based paper game that can be played everywhere at any time, because all you need is a sheet of squared paper and colored pencils - or Dash Race for even more fun and challenges.

Up to four players make their moves in turns, following very simple rules. This results in an amazingly realistic driving behavior. In order to take curves at optimal speed, you'll need experience and dexterity. Play the pure and truly timeless strategic variant in "Classic Mode", or turn to the breath-taking "Challenge Mode" for a wild arcade-style Dash Race.
