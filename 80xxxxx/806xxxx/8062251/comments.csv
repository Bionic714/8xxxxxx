Also you may have to put a driver named ""dinput8.dll"" in the Win32 folder (Where the .EXE is located) for the xbox controller to work without the game crashing. Hope this helps!

And as chichet says, copy everything in crack folder to install dir -> binaries -> win32 folder.
And if the game crashes at startup at Capcom logo, it may be because you got an controller plugged in (xbox control ect). Try plug it out and start the game.
And for the saving problems, some users seem to solve that by right click on shortcut or exe file then properties then comparability and check run as administrator."

,XtraZoom,2013-01-27T00:53Z,This going to sound stupid. Does anyone here use xpadder? If so can you tell me why it is possible to use xpadder on DmC Reloaded but I can't seem to able to use it on actual legit steam DmC?
,emadgsm,2013-01-27T01:06Z,shittt thank you very much working 1000% perfect grapich on windows 8 
,MuggyAtom,2013-01-27T01:12Z,"@XtraZoom , Xpadder simply assigns buttons on the controller to buttons on your keyboard.  So as long as you have the drivers installed on your computer for the controller it should work.  Also look into MotionJoy because it not only helps with controller support, but also helps with finding and installing the driver for the specific controller"
,3nder14,2013-01-27T01:13Z,"I exited the game and tried to start it up again, but it keeps on crashing. Anyone know how to solve that?"
,XtraZoom,2013-01-27T02:33Z,"@MuggyAtom this controller is from a bygone era, reason I still use it is due 1 its not broken and 2 it has lots of buttons.

Windows 8 already detected it 3axis 12button. There is no issues using it without any need of driver. 

I am asking is why input from xpadder is not detected by official steam version of DmC but could be detected by Reloaded's DmC?

Did steam use something to hide its input from xpadder?"

With a seed/peer ratio like this, you should be able to average about 200kB/s, depending on your available bandwidth.  That means you should be able to download this entire game in about 12 hours.   If not, make sure your torrent app's ports are forwarded to your router properly.  If you haven't forwarded your ports, then you won't be connectable, and you will get TERRIBLE download speeds because seeders won't be able to connect to you.  

If you don't know what port-forwarding is, google it.  "

,moeburn1,2013-01-27T15:57Z,"guys, please, your problem is not because of a lack of seeders.  whining ""omg seed pls seeeed"" isn't going to do anything.  even if there WAS anyone else to seed, they aren't going to see some whiny plea on this comment board and think ""oh, maybe i WILL seed!"".  But there are NOT any other secret hidden seeders anywhere.  THIS IS IT!   I can guarantee you that 90% of people that have downloaded this game are seeding it!

The simple fact is that this is an incredibly popular game, and it was only released two days ago.  Supply cannot keep up with demand.

IF you are getting terrible download speeds, WAIT!  THEY WILL CHANGE!  you should AVERAGE about 200kB/s.  Spiking up to 500kB/s, and then plummeting down to 0kB/s.  But as long as your ports are forwarded properly and you are connectable, it WILL finish in less than 24 hours!"

Here's two things that can make your download speed absolute CRAP:

1) Make sure you have your torrent app's ports forwarded to your router.  If not, you will only be able to connect to peers yourself, and they won't be able to connect to you.  If your port isn't forwarded, you'll get as little as 10% of the avg dl speed you could get.

2) do NOT upload/seed at FULL SPEED!  Most of you are probably using ADSL, and if you are uploading at full speed, your download speed will plummet to near-nothing.  Upload at 50%-75% of your maximum possible upload bandwidth to allow download bandwidth through.  This is a known limitation of asynchronous DSL."

Not sure why other people are having problems, here is my situation. 

1: I have cracked steam on my computer
2: Mount the image, and let it install
3: Copy the 2 files from the Crack folder, to the Win32 folder where you installed the game.
4: Create shortcut from DMC DevilMayCry.exe on your desktop.
5: Run the game. (I didn't even need to run as administrator, although that might help others)

No bugs with the sound, it works perfectly. I use an Xbox 360 controller, and it works perfectly, didn't even have to configure it in the options menu. Didn't need to change anything in my internet or firewall settings.

Are you extracting the crack files directly from the ISO to the Win32 folder? If so, that's probably what's blocking you.

Try opening DMC game folderDevilGameConfigDefaultEngine.ini and look for this ""MaxSmoothedFrameRate="". It's at 1000 default, just change it to 60 (if you have a 60 refresh rate) and save the file). 

After that try starting the game (maybe disable HD shadows and antialising as well).

Remember to back up that file 1st :D. Also if this works for you and fixes it completely pls let me know it worked."

In game HD Textures, HD Anti-aliasing, HD Shadows and VSYNC turned ON (ignore previous post, with it off it's still doing it).

Also if it still doesn't work: Nvidia control panel, manage 3d settings, only for DMC chance the Maximum Pre-rendered frames to 1 (remember to click apply). "

There is one strange problem later on, though, in a part where a character says ""Run, Dante!"", after some jumping, I reach a wall, screen turns perfectly WHITE, can hear my character walking if I try to walk, but can see absolutely nothing other than endless white. Anyone has this problem or has any clue what to do with such a thing? Is it from the game or the crack? Is an update needed?"

,betengan,2013-02-02T20:50Z,"Alright, regarding my previous comment, my problem is solved. The white screen of nothing turned out to be a strange glitch where the game actually skipped a group of demons, which you supposed to fight first, and straight to a jumping sequence. That skip caused the level to not finish properly after the jumping sequence. Anyway, I solved it by restarting the whole chapter or level (not just from the checkpoint), and the second time round, the demons showed up before the jumping sequence, so I figured out the first level run had a glitch. Hope this helps someone out there."

,Thorstone,2013-03-08T15:23Z,"Hey LDesire,

Install the game

then open the dvd (not run, but open), you will find a folder named crack (i havent downloaded it yet but this is the most usuall). copy these files.

Find the folder where the game was installed, open the folder, now there might be a win32 or something like that folder, if it's not paste the files in the instalation folder, if there is, open it and paste there.

Run game.

i will comment again if there was anything wrong i said there, but it's kind of hard to know when i don't have the file my self.
good luck"

,LilGreenEyesz,2013-03-10T21:04Z,"Lol I'm such a noob haha, if any1 else gets the same error I did then all you have to do is download the latest version fo Direct X -.- . hah great torrent and thank u!"
,crotchfist,2013-03-11T01:27Z,"got the game installed just fine, and it plays great. only problem is the stuttering/mini freezes. tried using the techniques to fix it posted above, but none seem to work. using Windows 8."
[V],SecTPB,2013-03-13T08:02Z,"It won't run. It tells me that I need to be running Steam. Installed as per directions. No good. I tried opening it with Steam running, nothing happens. Not even an error. Tried loading the .exe in Steam itself. It says it can't play a modded game. I uninstalled Steam and we're back to ""Steam needs to be running for you to play this game."" Info on a fix?"
[V],SecTPB,2013-03-13T08:33Z,"Never mind. I didn't realize that on Windows 8, even as an Admin, you don't have unlocked rights/ownership to folders. You have to edit the registry to enable ""Take Ownership"" to appear in your context menu. When you move the files to the game folder, it only looks like it's being copied over, and even shows a percentage and overwrite dialog, but it doesn't actually do anything. Odds are, if you get the Steam error, you either don't have ownership to the files, or you forgot to copy the crack files to the folder."

,lutakflint12,2013-04-01T23:49Z,"Ok so a little feedback from me

1.Tried to run this game on win xp sp3 , doesn't work too much freezes and stuttering.

2.After that i dual-booted into my windows 7 , installed the game and voila! it works perfectly without any freezing or stuttering.

3.final conclusion: this game runs poorly on win xp but runs perfectly on win 7 . I advise anyone that wants to play games and are  still using an xp to dump it and install win 7. :)"
