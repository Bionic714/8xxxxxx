,piuloc,2013-01-27T10:31Z,Err ? No need the previous version Warcraft 3 reign of chaos ?
,kuci3,2013-01-27T10:46Z,"it's already installed within the same folder. if you have problem running it, maybe you need to uninstall / delete any old installation first, perhaps?

As I've mentioned, I can't guarantee it will work on everyone's machine but hopefully, there're others here who're lucky too."
,piuloc,2013-01-27T16:25Z,"For sure it gonna work on my MB cuz we have same OS, Mountain Lion. If you play garena too, you know which version is used there ? Thanks for great torrent !"
,piuloc,2013-01-28T07:42Z,"Dead wrong for me and others ! Your folder doesnt work at all, kuci3. I checked inside by ""show package"" of Frozen Throne.app, but no such thing there ? I'd ask what software you use to run the game on your MAC ? CXZ, Wine, or Crossover ? From what I've seen, yours doesnt even have an .exe file, so cant run with Crossover or any other soft.. I have to say this a useless file !"
,kuci3,2013-01-28T18:30Z,"i'm sorry for you piuloc & the rest who can't get the game running on your macs. maybe u should try some possible solutions from comments in this torrents

bcause I'm running the game natively without using any other software. what I did was installed the game and patches on my friend's macbookpro running native Snow Leopard, and copy the whole folder (tht I'm sharing with you guys) to my iMac, that's all. It just works for me.. "
