Warcraft III : The Frozen Throne (running on Mountain Lion 10.8.2 + 1.26a patch)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a fresh installation folder copy of W3:TFT from Snow Leopard and has
been tested to run perfectly on my 2011 intel iMac running on Mountain Lion 10.8.2
with the latest 1.26a patch from Blizzard (no CD key required)

However I can't guarantee it will work on your machine, but it's worth the try!
Good luck!



INSTALLATION
------------
- copy "Warcraft III Folder" folder into your Applications folder.
- Enjoy!!



p/s: please continue to seed so that others can join the fun too!!
