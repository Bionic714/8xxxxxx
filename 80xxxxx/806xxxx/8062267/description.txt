Windows 8 for Dummies [Team Nanban]

 2012 | PDF | 9 MB

DESCRIPTION:

So you say Windows 8 has got you flustered! Really? Apart from the start screen, what is really so different in it as compared to Windows 7? 
Sure I agree the start screen does fly in your face when you donΓÇÖt want it to and it may get some time getting used to, but in a week or so, when you have got used to it, you may actually even start (gulp) liking it. 
Nevertheless, if there are some of you or your friends, who have made the switch to Windows 8, and need some help, the Windows 8 for Dummies is a great eBook.
