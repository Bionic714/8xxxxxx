 In this course, author James Fritz shows designers how to use Muse to create HTML-based web sites using a toolset familiar to anyone who's used Photoshop, InDesign, or Illustrator before. The course covers the design process from start to finish, from setting up web pages and populating them with graphics and text, to creating dynamic menus and adding special features such as widgets, slideshows, embedded video, social media integration, and more. The final chapter shows how to publish and update your site and view analytics on web traffic.
