,NewWorldOrphan9,2013-01-28T07:36Z,"*****CAPCOM Title Crash FIX*******
Worked for me!!:

For everyone who is using Razer “Nostromo”. You keep crashing after CAMCOM logo right? Basicly you don’t need to unplug nostromo or uninstall it’s drivers, all you gotta do is to go to:
Start Menu -> Search -> Device Manager -> Human Interfaces -> Razer Nostromo -> Double click it and disable driver. If you disable nostromo driver you can play without unpluging or unisntalling anything. I hope it helps."
,devlinclark,2013-01-28T13:58Z,thanks heromaster game works fine
,s1raz1,2013-01-29T04:29Z,"+1 
Everything works fine, odd, i tried a few other torrents and for some reason DL speed was super slow. I dont use a controller,  Keyb+mouse works just the way i liked it.
This one used all my DL broadband :D"
