On their seventh full-length release, Brooklyn's (by way of Atlanta)
Goldsparkle Trio were taped live at the Knitting Factory in New York during the
2001 Vision Fest. The trio, who manage to walk the finest line between
composition -- both highly and loosely structured -- and free improvisation,
are at their level best here, walking a tightrope of tension where their
naturally lyrical improvisational style is juxtaposed against their innate
desire to push the envelope. Check out the opener, "Naysayer," where Charles
Waters' clarinet playing vacillates between a folk melody and an angular scalar
investigation while remaining in the grip of the rhythm section's melodic
backing. Elsewhere, as on the title track, a propulsive bassline by Adam
Roberts brings in an Ornette Coleman-esque melodic line, deceptively simple,
though its rhythmic construction is anything but, changing signatures after
almost every bar and adding improvisation sometimes in the chorus and at others
in polyrhythmic bridges created by Andrew Barker's drumming -- he is anything
but a time keeper. The beautiful, edgy scalar structures that are at the heart
of the mismatched angles in "Williamsburg Concerto 1 & 2" offer a view of the
taut license at the heart of the group's compositions. Here intervals are
introduced and extrapolated upon in a thematic manner and discarded in favor of
complete disintegration that gets reconstructed in the process of free blowing
-- Waters' saxophone solo here is devastatingly phrased and executed, as the
rhythm section forgets about keeping up; they do much more -- they provide a
ground upon which he can eventually land. The communication on this date is
nearly astonishing and the rapport between the players is instinctual at this
point. If you cannot catch Goldsparkle live, this is easily the next best
thing, and the most desirable of all of their recordings.
