Ever since hearing his lyrical and musical talent expressed so strikingly in ΓÇÿBrothersΓÇÖ from Dean BrodyΓÇÖs self-titled 2009 album, I was hooked. His low cut twang with beautiful lyrics and equality stunning musical talent, Brody truly is someone were going to hear a lot from. He can make you laugh, cry, sing and listen, a talent which comes only once in a blue moon and 2012 brings this greatly talented country boy back into the spotlight with his album ΓÇÿDirtΓÇÖ.
Whether its Friday night or a quiet one in, Dean Brody has you covered. Born from dirt, back to dirt, but itΓÇÖs what you do in-between which only truly matters, ΓÇÿDirtΓÇÖ showing this all to show well. The beautiful story told through track three, ΓÇÿUnderneath the Apple TreesΓÇÖ will make you listen every time while tracks like ΓÇÿCanadian GirlsΓÇÖ and ΓÇÿitΓÇÖs FridayΓÇÖ will make you want to sing-along. The diverse effect of this album means one minute youΓÇÖre reevaluating your life while the next your excited about just getting out there and having fun. Either or, Dean Brody inspires every part of you to get up and do something with ΓÇÿDirtΓÇÖ.
Very rarely does such a talented storyteller emerge in the music industry, so we need to embrace them when they so appear. I havenΓÇÖt hear such a beautifully executed album with metaphor and fun, integrated so well with the fundamentals of storytelling in a long time. ΓÇÿDirtΓÇÖ truly is a storytellers journey, an artistΓÇÖs passionate expression about love, life and everything in-between; because hey, like Brody says, we come from dirt and all that matters is the middle. Being the prime songwriter, this truly is pure Dean Brody.
