,pxpierre,2013-01-27T04:02Z,"""When did a torrent site turn into a critics site?"" - Since 1972 or 73, I cannot remember exactly.

,Phatfish,2013-01-27T22:16Z,"A - Good

V - Ok

M - Story is ok, a bit thin but decent but the special fx are fucking awful. I dont know wtf they where thinking when they all sat around the table and:
"" Hey, let's just put a tiny person in a cardboard box, paint it white and that will look great as a robot! Yeah man, totally!""
Either they had a really tight budget and/or no imagination what so ever."

Good quality and worth the watch. 
@phatfish. You sir are obviously not pleased with anything in life. The mechanics and voicing of the robot is what makes the character. It adds a bit of humor. "

This movie is pretty good. Very different from any other movie. Cute and with a good plot. If you have elders in your immediate family, this would be a great movie to watch with them."
