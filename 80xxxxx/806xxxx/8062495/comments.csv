Seeds/Peers,,,,,,4/78

I might delete and reload the torrent, I should be getting better speeds than this."
,pennknig,2013-01-26T00:33Z,"I will DL when it's seeded,,,,,,I'm not waiting 6w5d for this,,,,,,I will play the 1st HAWX again......."
,Budd69,2013-01-26T02:04Z,It's retarded we have 4 torrents of the same content spreading out the seeders and leechers. It's brilliant.
,AnonymousSurfer,2013-01-26T04:57Z,"Yeah getting 8.1 Kb/s with 5 of 414 seeds connected...

People need to seed this game it looks awesome!"

,pyrosite,2013-01-26T18:48Z,where do i switch the language to english?
,MAA11792,2013-01-26T18:59Z,Stupid quacks.. now why would you set the game to auto-launch once the installation have been completed?
,AnonymousSurfer,2013-01-26T23:33Z,"Works great UNLESS you plan on using a controller such as a PS3 controller. Here are some problems with the controller:

Triangle makes the game crash when in a dogfight (no problems scrolling through menus though) and the game may crash after some time even though you don't have to press triangle. Pretty sure this is the maker's fault though"
,AnonymousSurfer,2013-01-27T00:53Z,Fix for the controller problem. Make sure (With PS3 controllers and DS3 Tool installed) to switch it to Xbox 360 emulator. Then change it around a little bit and everything works perfect!
,MAA11792,2013-01-27T01:41Z,"@AnonymousSurfer you no0b, try Xpadder or MotionInJoy which are 3rd party software for controllers.."
,MAA11792,2013-01-27T01:42Z,"Anyhow it works like a mother fucker, real sweet! THAAANK YAAAW!! +1"
,hellboundsx,2013-01-27T01:58Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME (THE TORRENT IS FINE) BUT THE GAME IS SOOOO BAD, FOR AN ACE COMBAT THIS GAME IS LIKE 1/10 THE CONTROLLS ARE SO STUPID, GAME OPTIMIZATION IS SO BAD, 8GB TO GO TO YOUR RECYCLE BIN!
DONT SAY I DODNT WARN YOU!"
,Scrapith,2013-01-27T03:04Z,"@MAA11792

DS3 tool the guy mentioned, IS montioninjoy"
,dwilly66,2013-01-27T05:51Z,DOWNLOAD IS GREAT GAME IS ABSOLUTE SHIT
,genocide44,2013-01-27T06:17Z,does this game have fullscreen mode without the black bars on top and bottom??
,LowBlow88,2013-01-27T12:58Z,SEED!!!! FFS!!!
,S1nthet1c,2013-01-27T15:49Z,I take it that the game works fine with an XBox 360 controller?
,LowBlow88,2013-01-27T15:52Z,SEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEDDDDDDDDD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,MAA11792,2013-01-27T16:18Z,"@Scrapith that's true but why does it go under two names, now that.. is stupid.^^"

,RobHAMR,2013-01-29T07:08Z,The helicopter gun won't stop firing after downloading this. Blocked it from the firewall and everything. Reinstalled about 4 times and tried different torrents. Anyone know about this?
,Qu3stik,2013-01-31T13:17Z,boring and shit game..
,thelol987,2013-02-01T07:18Z,"@RobHAMR let that run for a couple of mins and do its thing, you wont die and the helo will go down and you will start the proper mission."
,RAMEN00DLE5,2013-02-01T09:26Z,"I am so so so so so so so so so so so so sad about how this turned out :( Even better, I get to see my favorite IP crushed skulleffed and killed with molten plasma (way hotter than fire) just in a few weeks too! YAY! Dead Space and Ace Combat, I shall miss thee....."
,FerrelBMW,2013-02-10T10:13Z,"@RobHAMR WTF, you commented the same thing too @extremezone`s Ace combat ????"
,FerrelBMW,2013-02-10T10:20Z,"By the way, the torrent is fine, 
but the game is totally shit... "
,hotrippr,2013-02-10T11:41Z,"Great download, awesome game, great change of pace from the typical games out there. Game play is perfect with an Xbox controller!
