Don't say I didn't warn you."

,Eosphoros,2013-02-05T16:01Z,Downloaded this to test out EevilJ6204's claim of bogus crack and I don't know what he's talking about. Install/crack went fine with no redirect to any survey/offer site and it never asked me for any personal information.
,Fanchig,2013-02-06T10:41Z,"Agree with Eosphoros, I had no problem upgrading from 7.1.3.0 to 7.1.4.0 with this version. EevilJ6204 seems the one full of shite here."
,YeArr,2013-02-24T07:13Z,people like the first two posters are paid to smack talk torrents to turn away the timid.
