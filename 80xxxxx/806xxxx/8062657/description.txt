 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 I, the uploader (not the creator), recommend using VirtualBox to run this virtual appliance, though any hypervisor you wish to use should be able to run it. I say this without any guarantee of it working under anything else.

 I uploaded this torrent to provide an alternate download method to the direct HTTP download through Sourceforge and to "replace" the old torrent of version 0.1 (Santa edition). I will still keep the old torrent alive for a few weeks, though after that I will stop seeding the old one. I hope that you find this useful and enjoy!
