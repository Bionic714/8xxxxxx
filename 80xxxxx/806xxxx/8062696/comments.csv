blackcanary a request: do you have The Walking Dead 088 (2011) (c2c) (Archoboros-CPS) ? all the *seeded* torrents i find have the no ads version, and even shipJ's 0-Day Week of 2011.08.17 (which had the c2c) seems to lack seeders.

the ""c2c"" has an interview with author Jay Bonansinga that is cut out of the ""no ads."""
[V],STFmaryville,2013-01-25T17:56Z,"hey blackcanary, never mind. i did get it from shipJ's torrent. thanks anyway, and thanks for all you do!"
[V],blackcanary,2013-01-26T01:20Z,"STFmaryville, yes I have it, but glad you found it. :)  Thank you for all the uploading you're doing as well. :)"
