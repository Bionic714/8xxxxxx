For everyone who is using Razer “Nostromo”. You keep crashing after CAMCOM logo right? Basicly you don’t need to unplug nostromo or uninstall it’s drivers, all you gotta do is to go to:
Start Menu -> Search -> Device Manager -> Human Interfaces -> Razer Nostromo -> Double click it and disable driver. If you disable nostromo driver you can play without unpluging or unisntalling anything. I hope it helps."

,tower1000,2013-02-09T16:57Z,"Oke so I found a Solution for the ppl with a PS3 controller and Motionjoy that got stuck on the ""capcom screen 'has stopped working'""

1) be sure to use the xbox360 settings in motionjoy (even if u have the ps3 controller)

2) go to Device and Printers

3) open HID-compliant game controllers properties

4) go to Hardware open HID-compliant game controller

5) go to driver > disable it

6) open up the game and play

Atleast this worked for me"
,T3chEra,2013-02-10T00:58Z,"Is there a solution to the Vergil's health resetting glitch, yet? Every time I get his health down to the point where one more hit should kill him, it resets all the way to full. Please help. I'm on Devil Hunter if that's relevant.

Up until that, this torrent worked perfectly for me all the way through, downloaded in 1:25hr and installed without incident. During play, it never crashed or anything. 

If you want to use a PS3 controller, run  MotionInJoy as administrator and have it emulate an Xbox360 controller. The sensitivity, vibration, and buttons should all work and be configured correctly already without needing any change. If you don't run MotionInJoy as administrator, the driver for the controller sometimes stops working in the middle of the game, in which case you just need to alt-tab out and re-enable it, and you should regain use of the controller without having to end the game."
,T3chEra,2013-02-10T19:57Z,"Well, the health glitch is fixed with the Skidrow Update Cracked, which appears to be perfectly compatible with this version of the game. Someone posted the changelog for what else comes with the update under that torrent, which should pop up closer to the top if you searched ""DMC Devil May Cry""."
