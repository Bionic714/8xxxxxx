An image file of the disk which came with Garmin Navtalk GSM phone. It contains Intellisync software, which syncs contacts and calendar with the device. I've searched whole internet for this software and this torrent is the only way to download it.

Please seed it, and keep it alive. It's only 24 megabytes, thus it won't clog up your hard drive.
