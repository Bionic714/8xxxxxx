An art-house comedy about an ordinary family running the unusual business of elf tourism and spiritual sessions. Their house is built around an elf stone, which is sacred to the wife Lara, who is blessed with a sixth sense. When they get an offer to sell the stone at a high price, her husband Óskar is really tempted.

Lára, a mother of two, is gifted with a sixth sense. Not only does she communicate with people in Summerland (the sweet hereafter) in open trans-science sessions, but she also has good connection with elves. In her garden she and her husband, Oscar, have a big elf stone, which Lara attends to every day. Oscar runs the family business of elf tourism and medium sessions. Business is not exactly blooming, so when he gets an offer from a German eccentric to sell the stone for a substantial amount, he is really tempted.
