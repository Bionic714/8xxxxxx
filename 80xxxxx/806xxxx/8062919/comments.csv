,Swag03,2013-01-25T16:59Z,dude i hope it works ;D
,phat_71,2013-01-25T18:16Z,"DL speeds are quite good considering the difference in Seed/Leech. If it keeps at the speed I'm getting now I'll have it in 8-10 hours. Which works out well since I won't be home to play before tomorrow anyway. I'll keep uncapped upload till the weekend is over, assuming it all works (and nosTEAM has never failed me so far)."
,Amped1337,2013-01-25T18:27Z,NEED SEEEEEEEEEDS D:

,gimmiethespoon,2013-01-25T22:34Z,"Hello nos...Hate asking this way but are you going to upload the latest Borderlands2 DLC anytime soon?
Thanks for your hard work and great torrents  =)"
,Tang76,2013-01-26T01:11Z,My game keeps locking up at the end of each mission.  Sticks on submitting to leaderboards or W/E.  Anyone else having this issue?
,Bloodspeaker,2013-01-26T02:33Z,Yeah me too
,Bloodspeaker,2013-01-26T02:40Z,Yeah mine too
,Darklight999,2013-01-26T04:50Z,does this have the Vergil's Downfall DLC?
,Tang76,2013-01-26T05:10Z,Vergil's downfall won't be released until later as a separate file is my guess.  I still have to close the game after each mission due to it trying to submit to leaderboards.  I ran as admin as instructed per nosTEAM forum but didn't work.  Any1 have a fix for this?
,nosTEAM,2013-01-26T09:43Z,"If at mission end your game is stuck at ""Submitting score to leaderboard""  just press ""Alt+F4"" to close game. Open game again and you can continue story."

Ive updated EVERYTHING .Net 4.5, DriectX, C++, etc..."
,NewWorldOrphan9,2013-01-28T07:35Z,"Read this fix on a website for ""CAPCOM Title Crash."" Worked for me!!:

For everyone who is using Razer “Nostromo”. You keep crashing after CAMCOM logo right? Basicly you don’t need to unplug nostromo or uninstall it’s drivers, all you gotta do is to go to:
Start Menu -> Search -> Device Manager -> Human Interfaces -> Razer Nostromo -> Double click it and disable driver. If you disable nostromo driver you can play without unpluging or unisntalling anything. I hope it helps."
,Knightarchx,2013-01-28T08:18Z,Stuck on Submit to Leaderboards on after every mission. I know to Alt f4 out but any permanent solution?

What a bunch of fucking ingrates asking for ANOTHER release of some shitty game (lol @ Avatar the fooking game) before even thanking the team for their effort on this one. THANKS nosTEAM, you guys are some bad mudda humpas"
,sheesh10,2013-02-01T13:25Z,I really do like nosteam release..they work perfectly..theres only one thing..their logo. Their logo need to be in sync with the games theme..or at least look awesomely labeled.Because if you just put it like that it looks like shit.

,d3v1lyuan9,2013-02-19T07:09Z,"Hey guys, here's the deal, I was playing DMC as usual in HoH mode, until when the ""spinning wheel"" occur, my brother (1.5years old) clicked on the reset button accidentally... And when the game finish loading after the pc back on, I found my glorious save data became a ""corrupted save"". I got no ways to recover it but to overwrite it or delete it. Although I'm frustrated, I'm still willing to trace back my step but the feeling is totally different, it's like your LV80 warlord got hacked back to newbie, I really wish that people can help me out here! Spare me the save file and it's location (Because I really couldn't find it anywhere) Please don't criticize me for not paying enough effort and do understand my situation... "
,OrangePillow,2013-02-22T01:50Z,"@ d3v1lyuan9

I'm using XP and the place where I finally found the saves after searching like crazy was in -- 

C:Documents and SettingsUsernameLocal SettingsApplication DataSKIDROW220440Storage. 

I needed the savefile location aswell at some point and no one seemed to be able to share the information. To help a fellow gamer out I decided to share this information, even when I had to make a number of downloads and zig zags to be able to comment on the site.

I hope this helps you out and give a shout if it actually did.

,OrangePillow,2013-02-22T01:55Z,"@ d3v1lyuan9

C:Documents and Settings->Username->LocalSettings->ApplicationData->SKIDROW->220440->Storage. 

The backslashes didn't register, so this might confuse you less than my previous post.

,d3v1lyuan9,2013-02-22T12:56Z,"@OrangePillow Man, you're helpful, but the thing is I'm using windows 7 here, I can't find ""Documents and Settings"" but thanks too bro!"

,RafVne2,2013-04-18T22:10Z,"Thanks for the up.
As always, Nosteam release works without problems, well one, BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE.

Here's a thing, as a rule I block cracked games with my firewall, (actually my games folder is blocked so nothing from there can connect), but after completing a level it tries to ""submit score"" (or something like that), and since connection is blocked, it keeps on trying and I can't do anything. Is it safe to allow the connection, or is there another way?"
,RafVne2,2013-04-18T22:12Z,I mean beside closing it.
,RafVne2,2013-04-18T22:58Z,"well it looks like update 2 fixed the problem...
be carefull it seems that update may delete your saves. So copy it first."
,Mikex03x,2013-04-20T05:52Z,uhhh what version would this be
