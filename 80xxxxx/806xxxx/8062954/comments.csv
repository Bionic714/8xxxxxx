I suspect the same is true of this one. How could you get a novel of 600K words, or 1500 pages, into a file this small? Seems impossible."

,Paul-mc,2013-01-26T12:02Z,"@Avijit90 - I suggest you use the word ""abridged"" ( a term defined as ""shortening"" or ""condensing"" and which is most commonly used in reference to the act of reducing a written work, typically a book, into a shorter form), in brackets, in the title next time you upload something similar.

Thank you, just the same. "
