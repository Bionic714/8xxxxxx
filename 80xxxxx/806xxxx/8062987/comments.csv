Boston's All-Star point guard finished with 23 points, 10 rebounds and 11 assists, but the remainder of the Celtics offense continued to struggle (40.8 percent shooting), leading to Boston's season-high fifth consecutive loss. The Knicks also benefited from a strong performance by Amar'e Stoudemire (15 points, nine rebounds) to build a 10-point fourth quarter lead, which was enough of a cushion to hold off the hosts down the stretch.
