,Rinkaku,2013-01-26T14:19Z,It's stuck on 0.0% and 0.3 kb/s. There will be 30 more DMC games untill I download this.
,Lestat550,2013-01-26T21:58Z,"Confirming quality. Beautiful torrent, no freezes or crashes, full playthrough on nephalim. Thanks azaq! Your torrents always top notch."
,Phlo813,2013-01-27T02:57Z,"hi, i rarely contribute here but since i'm benefitting so much from such comments, i think i'll jump in with my humble piece of info:

i use this release of DmC, but experienced MANY freezes ingame, whatever the graphical quality, and couldnt figure out why.

finally what did the trick was the same work-around as with the old game Prototype: use the shareware (1.xx) version of DXTORY to limit FPS for the game, and it solved it right away.

system: windows xp pro sp3 (32bits), phenom2 x2 545, geforce gtx 560, 2GB ddr2, realtek HD audio chipset.

hope this helps someone, don't bother responding."
,Phlo813,2013-01-27T02:59Z,"by the way, the DLC didn't seem to have been installed, or maybe it's unlocked later in the game?

as of now i have no costume options."
,s1raz1,2013-01-28T07:13Z,"@Plho
Seriously?... U running a 2013 game with 2 gb of ram.. 
Best advice.. grab ur pc and toss it to the garbage."
,Phlo813,2013-01-28T14:32Z,"running all kinds of 2013 games very smoothly on these 2GB ram, dude.
don't mind the insult, but check your facts; windows xp lets you get more out of your ram than later OS, even tough it prevents you from having more than 4GB.
full load, DmC takes up less than 800MB ram.

i can't be certain, but i'd swear the freezes come from the software not handling resources well for my setup, and i'm sure i'm not the only one running into this problem. 
thought i'd share the workaround.

but feel free to trash your computer if you're frustrated i don't mine."
,Phlo813,2013-01-28T14:35Z,"and in case it wasn't clear, i specified my specs especially because i knew this was an outdated setup, and because i knew it would be useless to most.
the eternal struggle between new games and old computers can use any help it can get. ;)"

,shottie2thebody,2013-02-04T01:24Z,"for some reason the dlc won't work for me, is it already installed along with the setup?"
,roho94,2013-02-06T21:16Z,"ok, i finished the game now, and there is no DLC."
