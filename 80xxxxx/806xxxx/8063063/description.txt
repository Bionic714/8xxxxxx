An epic re-imagining of Shotaro Ishinomori's manga classic CYBORG 009, CYBORG 009: CHAPTER 000 is the historic first chapter of the forthcoming Archaia graphic novel coming this summer. Cyborg 009: Chapter 000 features the first ever truly digital variant cover!

When a young man known only by the numerical designation "009" discovers that his body has been cybernetically augmented and "improved" against his will, he must break free from the clutches of The Black Ghost, a secret society hell-bent turning humans into cybernetic weapons of mass destruction for sale to the highest bidder. 

Written by F.J. DeSanto (The Spirit, Insurgent) and Bradley Cramp (Gattaca, Lord of War) and stunningly illustrated by Marcus To (Batwing, Huntress, Red Robin) and Ian Herring (Jim Henson's Tale of Sand), Archaia and Ishimori Productions are proud to present this incredible new take on one of the most famous manga titles of all time!
