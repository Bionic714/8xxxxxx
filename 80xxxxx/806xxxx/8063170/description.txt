SACRIFICE is a self-published, creator-owned fantasy/action comic book by Sam Humphries and Dalton Rose. The series makes its triumphant return in January and will ship on a monthly schedule until the final, sixth issue.

Issue #4 will be available in stores (and digitally) on January 16, 2013. (That's also the day you can pick up issue #1 of Sam Humphries' UNCANNY X-FORCE with Ron Garney).

The first three issues have had advanced sell outs due to reader response and strong retailer support. SACRIFICE is a full-color, six-issue limited series about Hector, a native of the 21st Century who is forced to survive during the brutal Aztec Empire.

The first three issues are still available at comic shops. Previous issues are also available digitally on comiXology.

More information on SACRIFICE, including a list of participating retailers, online ordering, and digital download information, is available online at www.aztecsforever.net.
