,flameberg,2013-03-03T12:00Z,"the only 'newer' thing is 2012-2013, and it's hard-cover only, not PDF. Also you can use this set of books for self-education, and yes, you absolutely should use the newest available set of books if you're taking an exam.

So gtfo."
,fkgfni43y23kmsdf,2013-03-16T13:46Z,"Thanks for the upload. However I must say that this is not a ""complete"" collection. C4 and C5 books seems missing. Those you can get from here (Again old)

FYI: Older version means there will be trivial differences from new ones. Those dumb suckers who says 2010 is ""old shit"", these are 500+ pages books, not cars. Also these are free!!! So If you want new ones, go buy them for £35 each without complaining"
