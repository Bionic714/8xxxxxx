A & V are right on par.
Small file size too for 720p."
,e8hffff,2013-02-18T09:18Z,mkv sucks.  mp4 please
,swampmatt,2013-03-10T00:43Z,"MKV work fine for me. My first-gen AppleTV won't play the newer MP4s and I have to use Handbrake to convert almost everything using the legacy presets. MKV, AVI convert nicely. I sometimes have problems converting the MP4. So thanks for the MKV. "
