After tracing relevant psychoanalytic and historical origins of the family horror film, Tony Williams traces this theme's development from Frankenstein, Hitchcock's influence, Satanist movies, to the genre's seventies renaissance. The book also argues that family horror never vanished from the eighties films but still functions as a motif.
