,Gabzilla16,2013-01-28T03:09Z,Why is no one seeding this??
,TheLathe,2013-01-30T03:42Z,"I know, REALLY weird...

This is the first time in hundreds of Conan shows that I've ever seen this.  The client shows like 25/35 seeders but none of them are seeding, which seems VERY unlikely.  Maybe something just off with the torrent when it was made.

I went ahead and snagged the HD 1 Gig torrents of both the 21st and 23rd shows.  Better than nothing!  : )"
