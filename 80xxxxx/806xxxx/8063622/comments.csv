Can you seed this? everyone is stuck at 73.6%"
,gunbravo,2013-01-29T14:14Z,"I managed to download this directly from TVTeam's site. Although the sample file was missing, if you have the show, you don't need the sample. So check to see if you have the show at 100% and help me seed. everyone seems to be stuck at 73.6% and this should get you going.
I'll seed to 100% and after that you are on your own."

However when i played programme in the vlc player,Windows Media Player & GOM player, i noticed the audio out of sync slightly with video 
[ie.sound was slightly ahead of picture]

This may or may not bother you, but if it does, i fixed it with a free downloadable tool called "" Avidemux 2.6 (32-bit)"" and set the audio ""shift"" to +250 and the sound is back in sync with video...

Hope this helps someone!!!!"
