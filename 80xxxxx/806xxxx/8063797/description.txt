It's the penultimate issue of YOUNG JUSTICE!

In case you missed it, YOUNG JUSTICE has jumped five years ahead to mirror the hit Cartoon Network animated series, Young Justice: Invasion. The team's adventures continue in YOUNG JUSTICE #24.

The fight between Kylstar and the most powerful heroes of Earth continues. Will they ever be able to escape? Meanwhile, Martian Manhunter, The Flash and The Atom have been kicked off of Brainiac's spaceship ... with Nightwing and the other members of Young Justice still aboard! But will they be strong enough to defeat him on their own?

YOUNG JUSTICE #24 is written by Greg Weisman and illustrated by Christopher Jones.
