,redinfernus,2013-01-27T09:50Z,"Stuck at 97.85%. The other issue if this torrent is having the same issue, but it's even worse (stuck at 41.45%)
This needs to be seeded badly!
Also, does anyone know if this is just another copy of The Colbert Report?"
,PterriThePterodactyl,2013-01-28T10:19Z,"Mine is also at 97%, however, the only files that haven't downloaded fully are the sample files. The actual episode should play fine despite the download not being complete. 

HOWEVER, the audio is out of sync, at least mine is, I might try playing it with a different media player."
,shinjukublack,2013-02-01T08:10Z,"Yes, it's stuck at 97% because apparently no one downloaded the sample ;)

Just uncheck the file in your bittorrent client and POOF, torrent complete. Haven't checked on the audio. If this copy is bad I'm giving up; between the Colbert Report mistake and unseeded torrents, I'll just assume I'm not supposed to watch this episode!"
