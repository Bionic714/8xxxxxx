,surmav,2013-01-28T10:39Z,I installed as ENG language but after i ran game it's in Russian!?
,surmav,2013-01-28T10:43Z,"Ohh nvm, you have to select manually from components English language because as default it sets Russian, didn't notice that before. If you choose from installer between En and Ru it just changes installer language not game language, so be sure you choose English from Components before install."
,surmav,2013-01-28T10:43Z,"Nvm, had to choose English from components before install."
,Stemborer,2013-01-30T09:48Z,@surmav what do you mean bec when i installed the game ive chosen EN and english but when i ran the game the text is russian

 Copy/ move the folder  ”CookedPCConsole” to the “DevilGame” folder in the game’s install folder*, when asked if to merge and over-write existing files, click “Yes”

* Default game install path:

4. Start the game and continue playing.

Good luck guys.....:)"
