Marking the tenth anniversary of the Soham murders, this new documentary for ITV1 reveals the devastating impact on the family of one of the victims, Holly Wells.

The Wells family speak exclusively about how they have coped without their daughter, who along with friend Jessica Chapman was murdered by Ian Huntley in 2002.

At the time the murders caused a national outrage – and this documentary plots the chronology of the horrific events of that summer, and follows the Wells’ very personal story of how they have come to terms with the loss of their daughter to remain a strong family unit over the past decade.
