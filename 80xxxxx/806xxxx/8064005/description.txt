  After disbanding New ZealandΓÇÖs the Mint Chicks, Portland, OregonΓÇÖs Ruban Nielson planned to quit music and take on a day job. For a hobby, he started making psychedelic demos in his basement, using samples. Soon, music took over as a career again, and his fun brand of experimental pop ended up in the hands of Fat Possum Records, who released Unknown Mortal Orchestra's self-titled debut in the early summer of 2011.
