With the Mission out of the picture, Jaime is free to search for her past and recover some fragments of the woman she used to be. Unfortunately, there's another player in the game, and she'll stop at nothing to end Jaime's search once and for all! Are there any clues as to the identity of this mysterious woman, and why she's gunning for the Bionic Woman? All we can say is ... she's not sugar, she's not spice, but she's everything nice. Her name is Katy, and she's Fembot #1.
