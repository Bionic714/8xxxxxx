What's in this version:


Now you can choose what to install between GooglePlay 3.10.10 (original or modified) and the Android Market 2.3.6 (modified or original).
Plus adjusted slightly the actual installation, now sets always in system, but there may be times when there will be enough room in the section systems, then you have to clean up his own, but in this situation the glitches with the market lower.
