,IAoSI,2013-02-08T01:46Z,It is great. Macklemore and Ryan Lewis are amazing.
,IAoSI,2013-02-08T01:47Z,"You also have ""Kings (feat. Buffalo Madonna & Champagne Champagne)"" in the torrent twice."
,GnarlyCharlieOx,2013-05-07T12:02Z,"Why are their multiple copys of a few songs? Like 05, 09 and 10 were on there twice. Is it different remixes or just a fuck up?"
