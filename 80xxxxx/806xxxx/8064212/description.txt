Trevor McDonald goes inside one of America's most notorious maximum security prisons - Indiana State - where he comes face-to-face with 12 condemned men awaiting execution.

Part 1. 
Trevor meets Benjamin Ritchie, who faces the death penalty for killing a policeman. Ritchie talks about the moments before his capture and how he felt on hearing the sentence. John Stephenson, who assassinated three people on the orders of a criminal gang, talks about friendships on death row - and survival. Paul McManus murdered his family, Trevor accompanies him on his daily visit to the prison hospital for his insulin shot. Among the wider prison population, the charismatic Ronald L Sanford committed a double murder when he was just a boy. He was committed to Indiana State at the age of 15, sentenced to 170 years inside. And there is a visit to the prison's 1950s-style barber shop.

In a gripping interview, Baer talks about his life and his crime, while Trevor finds it hard to remain composed, telling him that he can understand why people would want the death sentence for such horrifying acts.
