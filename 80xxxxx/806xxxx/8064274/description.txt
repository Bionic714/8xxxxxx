Agile software development is a group of software development  methods based on iterative and incremental development, where  requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between  self-organizing, cross-functional teams. It promotes adaptive planning,  evolutionary development and delivery, a time-boxed iterative approach,  and encourages rapid and flexible response to change. It is a conceptual  framework that promotes foreseen interactions throughout the  development cycle. The Agile Manifesto introduced the term in 2001.

Scrum is an iterative and incremental Agile software development  method for managing software projects and product or application  development. Scrum has not only reinforced the interest in project  management, but also challenged the conventional ideas about such  management. Scrum focuses on project management institutions where it is  difficult to plan ahead. Mechanisms of empirical process control, where  feedback loops constitute the core management technique are used as  opposed to traditional command-and-control oriented management. It  represents a radically new approach for planning and managing projects,  bringing decision-making authority to the level of operation properties  and certainties.
