,Bowen.55,2013-01-28T09:38Z,"Great movie and the download is nice but the audio just takes away from the whole experience. 

V:8.5
A:5

The audio rating would be a lot higher if there wasnt a buzzing all throughout the movie. Also its off by maybe a half of a second or less but its hardly noticeable."
,Arkaado,2013-01-29T04:39Z,"For those complaining about the unsynched audio, if you're using VLC you can adjust the audio delay by hitting J or K."
,Dugbo1,2013-01-29T19:18Z,Thanks Arkaado
