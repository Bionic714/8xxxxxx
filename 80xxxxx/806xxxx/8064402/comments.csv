will download and post feedback"
,tehz,2013-01-25T20:26Z,"Downloaded and scanned the program, its clean. Cracks seem to be working perfectly, i can stream in 1080p and over 25 fps. Audio is awesome as well.

Thank you!"
,maulerguy,2013-01-25T20:59Z,"Glad to see people are enjoying this already, not even a whole afternoon after I posted it. From now on I'll be sure to post other awesome finds if they don't already have torrents."
,seedbag,2013-01-26T18:47Z,"Not working for me, still got login screen"
,tajammata,2013-01-27T01:49Z,Is the login screen part of the crack?
,Cuhrode,2013-02-01T20:35Z,1080p is working as well. Very nice
,terkv,2013-02-02T14:41Z,"Hi! Worked just fine, thanks for an awesome up to date xsplit! I'm also gonna seed for you and I also have a high bandwith:):)"
,Cuhrode,2013-02-07T20:22Z,Just to let you know--there is a new version. (1.2.1501.2501) and it has some pretty nice fixes so it would be worth uploading if possible.
,alfrgp,2013-02-09T00:49Z,How do I get past the login screen?
,cowboy36,2013-02-09T03:01Z,"you have to make a account in order to use this 
just make a free account"
,alfrgp,2013-02-10T09:26Z,"Making an account and logging in seems to fix it, and you don't get limited by it being free either, at least it seems that way so far. "
,LurkieXX,2013-02-19T16:56Z,"Straight forward. 

1) Run the install .exe
2) Copy Crack to Install Directory.
3) Start program and enjoy.

I do not know if this may cause problems or not but the last option of step 1 (The Install) ask if you wish to Launch Xsplit. I unticked that option and went straight to step 2.

I have tested this via Local Recording and the Watermark was gone. (Which was my reason for seeking a crack version.)

@Xsplit Software Devs - I love your software, however I am unable to afford your subscription cost.


Vouch to Maulerguy for the upload."

The features will still work, but you do have to sign in still."
,swescape,2013-03-04T13:14Z,"has a worm in it, you'll get an invisible ""fake"" mirc icon, thanks to my firewall i didn't get to try out what would happen if it connected, but i bet it's some cheap way to get a huge botnet filled with zombies.

my question is why though?"
,deadretreat,2013-03-07T01:26Z,":::|| WARNING ||:::

yes the app when you launch it keeps trying to connect (peerblock on) to an amazon ec2 cloud, so yea it has a worm in it.  so maulerguy whats up with that and dont say its false because im looking at it"
,deadretreat,2013-03-07T01:53Z,"swescape is right, it keeps connecting to amazon ec2 cloud. has worm in it "
,fl0pa,2013-03-08T18:27Z,"@deadretreat
I´ve installed it and started it. 
How can I remove the worm?"
,suicidechilde,2013-03-31T00:28Z,Thanks for the upload! Works perfectly!
,HunterOSx,2013-06-02T01:25Z,"This was uploaded on my birthday, but no one give a fuck. Also thanks!"
,bayPirate15,2013-06-03T20:14Z,IT IS NOT A WORM. XSPLIT USES AMAZON AWS. THIS TORRENT IS SAFE
