,elponja2001,2013-02-09T20:42Z,"Hi There. Works perfectly but when I've tried to start a new model rhino can't found any template file.

,JNMAAG,2013-02-22T21:43Z,"I cant install rhino because when I start the setup it says that rhinoceros requires the Microsoft. NET 4.0 Full Framework to be installed so I have to visit //rhino3d.com/net4 in order to download and install

,ccaall,2013-03-03T21:24Z,"'For Windows 8 users, run the patch in compatibility mode for Windows 7. Then it should stop crashing (:'

if anyone is confused how to do this, right lick -> properties -> compatibility tab -> check the box and run under windows 7 enjoy!"
,ahn.om.le,2013-03-04T07:39Z,The crack gives 6 sets for the serial but the installer only needs 5.  I tried several combos without any luck.  Anybody figured it out?
,theMeerkat,2013-03-07T21:14Z,Anyone have any concerns about the: Troj/Agent-WFN or TR/Dropper.Gen contained in the crack .exe?
,scrutie,2013-03-08T13:50Z,"Works 100% and easily.

ahn.om.le: 
the first set is already written on the left. Insert the last 5.

theMeerkat: 
No need to worry, just like in most patches/keygens the codes used are similar to codes used by viruses, thus identified as such by anti-virus programms.

eparreno: 
Likewise in your case your anti-virus must have automatically quarantined the file. Search it there and restore it. "
,Rtjk,2013-03-13T10:42Z,Does this Rhino program works for 32 bit computers ? 
,Rtjk,2013-03-13T10:51Z,Does this Rhino program works for x32 ?
,applicationthirst,2013-03-30T23:28Z,the software asked me to verify license to use it properly - does everyone really put your email address to verify license? and when I skip it still does go to the rhino and on the top it said RHinoceros 5.0 (educational) is this correct?
,applicationthirst,2013-03-30T23:38Z,once I successfully downloaded & installed - it asked me to verify license and put my email address and verification from McNeel to locates my hard drive - does everyone doing this part? or should I skip it? didn't it say license to be verify to run the software? thanks
,popik31,2013-04-16T21:28Z,thank you so much!!
,iie,2013-04-17T22:28Z,WATCH OUT this has a trojan in it!
,theMeerkat,2013-04-24T08:07Z,"The trojan only relates to the patch files. Standard alert for patches and keygens etc.
Installed myself after first being concerned. 
just ignore the trojan alert.
All is good. thanks 'scrutie' for the reply.
Serial is found in the crack, which must be opened before installing the .msi
Just follow install instructions. after install, copy the crack file into the Rhino program folder.
Then you won't have licensing issues.
Block program from internet connections of course."
,shous,2013-04-28T19:23Z,"Hi guys,
I successfully installed Rhinoceros but when I want to run the crack it crash every time I hit the patch button.
I tried to change the compatibility to windows 7 and XP(SP3) but still have the same problem.
Is there any way I can patch the files manually?
Thanks"
