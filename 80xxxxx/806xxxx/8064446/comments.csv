The Passengers of the Wind collection was a wonderful surprise :) Hope you'll have more Burgeon to share in the future, namely his Cyann Saga and Twilight Companions collections.

And Les Tours de Bois-Maury by Hermann would also be a great great choice"

There are 2 Companions of the Twilight out, I got the text for a 3rd, but no clue how good the translation is, and i dont like the series, so I havent looked into getting it done."
