actually, you don't speak your own language.  brits didn't invent it.  it was created by german/viking/and several other groups of people before england existed.  later it was only spoken by poor people, and so on and so on.. no need for history lessons.

the fact is, the language was rather harsh, when england came to be, and everything settled, they refined the language, made it clearer, and better basically.

here in america, we made it even more better.  not because we're more awesome [though i personally, am :)].. it just naturally evolved.  we speak it clearer than you all do.  just as you all speak it clearer than the original form of the language.  and somewhere down the line some other group will pick it up and make it better again as i highly doubt we perfected it.  so yea, it's not your language, or ours, it was created from many different groups, before your country or mine even technically existed."

,tai69,2013-01-28T21:48Z,"@jodot159  - I am not sure which third rate American college you received your education at, but you are completely wrong. The English language was developed in England. England & Germany share a common ethnic heritage, which is possibly what has confused you. The English language has other lingual influences, but it was developed in England. Perhaps you are making reference to the fact that modern England became independent from the Roman Empire in the fifth century, or that some history books mistaken state 1066 (the year of the Norman Conquest) the year that England was created. Archeologists have found evidence that England was inhabited 500,000 years ago. 

There is no such thing as a pure language, however Americans have not made English better.  If anything Americans made things more confusing when they started to use nouns as verbs e.g. interview. 

Noah Webster created an American English dictionary primarily for political reasons. After the American revolution he changed the spelling of many words to distinguish American English from British English. Some words were already spelt differently, due the ignorance of many Americans who did not know the proper spellings of word, so wrong spellings became accepted in America."

Well, I'd just say they simplified this language. They dropped i.e. genders and many complex inflections; all the stuff I'm handling in my primary language (not English) all day and am happy with. They improved English in the sense of making it easier to learn and master. Maybe you opine that language evolution is an endless simplification, beginning with silly Stone Age dudes that invented a complex system because they were so totally uneducated and lacking crucial language invention skills. However, others might point out that there is a certain critical point where further simplification of a language is - to put it mildly - not beneficial to anyone. So, how is progress?

Ghetto kids gonna keep innovatin' your freakin' language? Won't stop till shit is kinda perfect. Ain't they?

Movie quality is kinda fine btw. Thank you neon!"
,cohfan123,2013-01-28T22:26Z,"Dear jodot159,

""we made it even more better"" - clearly you don't know how to speak proper english.

And the stupidity you're talking about isn't helping your case at all... the original is always the ""right"" way. Everything that comes after is a slang or derivative, not an ""improvement"".

As far as the movie goes, I didn't download it because it looks like a shitty movie."

I've got two words for you ""evolution baby!"", oh yes that right!. The english language was first used/created/spoken in Britain not America you dumb redneck,Southern Scotland to be precise. Over the years the language just evolved from different civilizations that entered/invaded Britain. There are actually a few different types of english ""Old English"", this derived mainly from Germanic settlers (Anglo- Saxons). You may now say ""Yea! but these guys were not British"" you would be totally wrong they settled there and therefore they were British. Enough about emigration laws. So after old english Britain got invaded by many other settlers and the language was even more influenced (Romance(Latin)/Norse/Norman-French etc etc... until we reached Modern English which is used today. All of this aside we have slang which is mostly only accepted/understood within the regional area the slang is derived from. Sometimes i can't even understand different slang's myself.

@tai69 ""There is no such thing as a pure language"" there is but there are so many different theories to ""language origin"". (Google this i can't be bothered explaining) linguistic researchers also think Proto-indo-europeans language is the ""Pure Language"", every single language spoken today comes from this language. a prehistoric language of Eurasia Europe/Asia.

@jodot159 That's right ""European"" not America your ancestors at this time were most likely still grunting at each other like the apes they were!.

@titusflav 3 words for you my friend ""Google British Empire"" A little history lesson yet again for another American. We didn't lose anything we simply decolonized which means we gave it back. Queen Elizabeth II is still the constitutional monarch of 16 states.
""We came, we saw and we conquered!""

,07_WRX,2013-03-11T04:15Z,"To all the armchair linguists out there-

There's some truth but a lot of you are still wrong.

First, English is a Germanic language. It's a direct descendant of German.

Second, Proto-Indo-European isn't the mother tongue of all modern tongues. It's simply one prehistoric mother tongue out of many. We don't even know what it looks or reads like, but recent archaeological findings in Russia have uncovered a written language that MAY be a direct descendant of PIE.

Third, American English is just as valid. All dialects are valid, and there is no such thing as a ""pure"" language. Don't be prescriptivist. All languages are ""bastardizations"" of whatever came before them, and prescriptivist logic is self-defeating.

Fourth, American English IS closer to Shakespearean-era English than modern British English. It's also more ""accent neutral"" than British English, meaning it has a higher comprehension rate among low-proficiency English speakers/learners.

Fifth, have any of you guys even read Old-English? It's nearly mutually intelligible with Middle-German.

@tai69- Wrong across the board. Your historical pseudo-facts have nothing to do with the emergence of American English as a dialect. England being inhabited half a million years ago has nothing to do with the English language. Also, the word ""English"" comes from ""Angeln"" (where the word Anglo comes from) who were a group of Germanic people that emigrated to the British Isles. It was their isolation from the other Germanophones and exposure to French, Latin, and Spanish that caused the eventual emergence of English. There's a reason why they call English speakers ""Anglophones"". "
