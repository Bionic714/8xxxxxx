,Hucle84,2013-01-27T08:32Z,"@dandalis They released this version to be used on PC specifically for Steam.

It's been beefed up to bring out to 60 fps at I think 1080p or 720p.
Either way, the name says it all in ""Enhanced Edition"""
,druskov,2013-02-16T18:37Z,for one it took me 16 hours to download no one apparently felt like sharing their upload apparently and two you need to either find a patch or never use your aircrafts gun because if you do it insta crashes tried 5 times now same result hit the button for a second ctd... so download at your own risk and if you do don't expect it to be short thing is 7 gigs and i only managed 150kb/s at the most for download rate >.>
