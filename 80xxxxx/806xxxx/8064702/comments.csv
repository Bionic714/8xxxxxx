,master_b415,2013-05-12T23:20Z,"There are English speaking parts in the movie, I misunderstood this torrent to have selectable dual audio. Not so  the foreign audio parts are ""NOT"" encoded with English - The included Subs are Danish. no clue on the foreign content of the movie and really is almost #lost. Quality is just alrite. -  TYVM all the same, cheers"
