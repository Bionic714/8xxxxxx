Here it is at last, the first ISM update in a while. In answer to your questions:



1. No, I don't believe the year 2010 is thus complete. ISM lists 742 sets for that year.


2. Yes, I will post these missing sets if and when they are available.


3. No, I don't have new movies, only what I have already uploaded. I will upload movies after I...


4. Yes, the years 2011 and 2012 are ready to go and coming soon, be patient.


5. That's right, either I zip all the sets individually or I must upload 25-30 different torrents, a lot of work for all of us.


6. I cannot possibly post a preview for each set, guess why.





If you see a set in the wrong year, please tell me.
