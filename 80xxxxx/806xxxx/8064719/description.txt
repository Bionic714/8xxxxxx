Overground collected four highly-acclaimed volumes drawing upon long out of print singles, discarded demos, and forgotten outtakes to tell the story of Britain's early-to mid-'80s anarchist-punk movement. 

Anti-War takes its title from the opening cut by Dirt. The album serves as a wake-up call to everybody who declares the anarchistpunk scene to be little more than a succession of increasingly smudged photocopies of Crass' original manifesto: the 23 bands here highlight some of the most remarkable acts in the arena -- Zounds, Flowers in the Dustbin, Anthrax, Rubella Ballet and the Lost Cherrees among them. 

Anti-State: Anarcho-Punk, Vol. 2 offers up 21 cuts with a coherence that few similarly far-reaching compilations could ever muster. Thematically less focused than the preceding Anti-War, Anti-State is the story of social protest during the first years of Thatcher's Britain. It's an approach that rounds up some surprisingly diverse musical attacks -- Blyth Power's ferocious folk, the Disruptors' almost-stadium rocking riffola, and the early Chumbawamba's polemic-plus-power chords possess a vital variety that will astonish anyone who comes in expecting wall-to-wall Crass covers.

Anti-Society rounds up some of the less remembered but nevertheless crucial lights on the scene. Hagar the Womb, Oi Polloi, and the immortally named Thatcher on Acid are probably the best-known names here, but they are by no means the very best. Excellent contributions from  Icons of Filth, Karma Sutra, and Untermensch have a compulsive power that cannot help but remind listeners just how vital this music was, both to its own time and place and, because its sentiments were so universal (and its enemies so all-pervasive), to the modern world.

Anti-Capitalism is sometimes stunning, occasionally sluggish, but never less than startling slabs of 7" and 12" vinyl, that once again run the gamut of the movement at its peak. In terms of name recognition, everyone's here -- Conflict, who open the show with "Mighty and Superior," Rudimentary Peni ("Teenage Time Killer"), Anathema ("Your Ulster,") and Crass, the daddies of the entire scene, who deliver a previously unavailable version of "What Do You Want." As with the other volumes in this series, Anti-Capitalism is not necessarily the easiest listening material, even for converts. 

Together, they add up to the most complete portrait of the era you could hope for. Crank it up, open all your windows, and give the neighbors a taste of music that really, genuinely means something. They might thank you for it later.
