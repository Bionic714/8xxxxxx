,tpapirate,2013-02-10T20:09Z,"Thanks for the up!  I installed and copied the DLL files as instructed.  When PS opens, it's asking if I want to run the trial version or if I want to license it.  If you choose to license it, it's asking for the serials. I don't see any serials anywhere.  Do I just continue to run it in trial mode? What happens once you get to 30 days?  Does the choice just disappear and it runs fine, or will it stop?

Thanks!"

,vivatpb5776,2013-02-23T21:02Z,"Instead of being an asshole like some of the previous posters, this is what I did to successfully install Photoshop and replaced the .dll files.

- Initiate the installation by clicking set-up.exe under the software folder
- Select trial option
- You will be forced to sign into Adobe.com before completely the installation. I just used some bogus email account from bspamfree.org.
- At this time, you will be prompted to choose what version(s) you want to install. Both the 32-bit and the 64-bit versions are available. I simply chose the 64-bit.
- The installation will begin and will take about 10-15 minutes
- Once complete, DO NOT OPEN PHOTOSHOP.
- I opened two Windows Explorer windows and viewed them side by side. On one side was the .dll folders and on the other was the adobe program file folder.
- Drag the appropriate .dll file into the corresponding adobe program file folder. For me, I only had to copy the 64-bit .dll into the (64-bit) Photoshop and (64-bit) Bridge program file folders. CHOOSE TO OVERWRITE THE EXISTING .DLL FILE.
- As a note, your security program of choice may flag this process as a viral attack. Simply allow the file and proceed.
- At this time, you can now open Photoshop. Once opened, you can verify the installation worked by going to Help. You will notice that Updates is greyed out and you should see the word ""Deactivate..."" greyed out.

All in all, this took about 15-20 minutes. Thank you uploader."

,chaosUnseen,2013-02-26T15:47Z,"windows 8 pro - working, thanks uploader.  Did want to note using the .dll method, i only got regular PS and not extended version.  Ive seen this before on Mac, but i cant remember what makes it revert to standard instead of extended.  any which way thanks"
,Newb787,2013-03-01T08:42Z,"@vivatpb5776, windows doesn't have a stand alone DLL folder. If you're going to post instructions, you need to provide complete and not ambiguous directions #fail"
,hestax,2013-03-03T14:37Z,This is not the extended version...please update your torrent info !!!
,nicdanmas,2013-03-07T01:01Z,You can use this serial number 1330-1686-6718-4590-3584-3102
,Purg25,2013-03-12T21:24Z,Newb787 learn to read the instructions. windows does have a .dll folder but you don't put the files in the windows .dll folder. you put them in the install directory. it's people like you that cause Trolls and other people to flame others for being Stupid. cause you don't Read the instructions you expect everything to be hold your hand type of installations. heaven forbid you and the rest of the people like you should have to learn something and do some actual work for a change.
,zamboto,2013-03-29T00:08Z,"Follow @vivatpb5776's instructions if you're having difficult getting this to work.

As a side note, when attempting to install via the setup included in this torrent, I continually received a ""file not genuine"" or some such nonsense. I just downloaded CS6 from the official Adobe site and installed from there."
,DekaSwap,2013-04-01T01:02Z,"@chaosUnseen
Dude, you've got to start the trial and THEN replace the DLL files. (Also a Win8 user, works perfectly!)"
,TONPumper,2013-04-01T22:02Z,Which version is this?
,shawnbelieu,2013-04-14T04:19Z,im curious if i download this improperly will the serial number be banned? 
,NoNipples,2013-04-18T00:24Z,"Welp that sucked, I installed and went to get the .dll files, but 32 and 64 bit folders are empty... bummer "
