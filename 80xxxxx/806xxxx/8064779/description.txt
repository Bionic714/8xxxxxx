Theres a wealth of data online, but sorting and gathering it by hand can be tedious and time consuming. Rather than click through page after endless page, why not let bots do the work for you?

Michael Schrenk, a highly regarded webbot developer, teaches you how to develop fault-tolerant designs, how best to launch and schedule the work of your bots, and how to create Internet agents that: ΓÇó Send email or SMS notifications to alert you to new information quickly
ΓÇó Search different data sources and combine the results on one page, making the data easier to interpret and analyze
ΓÇó Automate purchases, auction bids, and other online activities to save time
ΓÇó Sample projects for automating tasks like price monitoring and news aggregation will show you how to put the concepts you learn into practice.
