On Sale: January 16, 2013	

This is the second art collection book by the internationally renowned and Emmy Award-winning master artist, FRANK CHO. This book highlights the latest covers, pin-ups, illustrations, paintings and sketches by FRANK CHO, including art from his recent Liberty Meadows project. This book contains the images of women in various states of undress and in full cheesecake glory. Definitely not for the faint of heart and Tea-bag Republicans.
