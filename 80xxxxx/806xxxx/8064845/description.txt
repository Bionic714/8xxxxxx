Book Description
This book is a step-by-step guide and a hands-on co-piloted experience for those trying to make Drupal powered websites work for them, and for their clients. Much more than a ΓÇ£tutorialΓÇ¥, what is needed is a nuts-and-bolts living mentor and guide which really shows the reader how to do the things really required for bringing it all together in a site which works. This will be the only book covering all the difficult components of Drupal: views, panels, themes, content creation, etc. The book will cover:

- How to upgrade your hopelessly outdated and obsolete-software dependent site and bring it into the Drupal mainstream and future
- How to become a great Drupal themer and make ΓÇ£non-DrupalΓÇ¥ looking sites
- How to really customize Drupal for your real needs
- How to start using best practices in Drupal web application development
- How to work like the pro Drupal shops and be ready for big projects ΓÇô and small ones
- Learn by example (code samples, theme samples, videos) at every step
