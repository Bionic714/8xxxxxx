Once upon a time in the kingdom of Enchancia, Sofia became a princess. With her

ropes! To help Sofia along the way are the three headmistresses of Royal Prep
Academy, Fauna, Flora and Merryweather, her royal steward, Baileywick, and a
group of cute woodland creatures led by a wise-talking rabbit, Clover. On her
