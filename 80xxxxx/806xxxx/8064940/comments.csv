Simply run the .exe file?"
,Xenirina,2013-01-27T00:03Z,"How do I change the language?
It installs in some weird one. Anyone know how?"
,maustin,2013-03-23T23:01Z,"Installs in Swedish, lol, and I haven't found any way to change the language yet, but it's not that big of a deal. Installs and runs perfectly; you can get TNod by searching TPB, it's about 1mb, and it found and applied a valid license literally within seconds. So-o-o nice to have a working version of Nod32 again, thanks Nicke for a quality up :)"
