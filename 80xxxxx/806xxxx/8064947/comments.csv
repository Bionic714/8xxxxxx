,mt_phile,2013-01-26T06:57Z,Decent quality but there is a logo throughout.
,TheOnlyest,2013-01-26T19:43Z,"Thank you for this! The quality is excellent V:9 A:8, but there is a large ""Canal+ HD"" watermark through the entire film. "
[T],analogreflections,2013-01-26T20:56Z,"You're welcome, and it's not watermark like in the center of the screen, it's just logo from the TV station and it's in up right corner.
Does that bother you? I haven't even notice it while I was watching.. whatever you watch on TV there is a logo."
,.KRAAG.,2013-02-04T22:02Z,"Thanks for the upload analogrefelections, this is the only 720p copy of this film.

The logo is a very small price to pay."
,aerfos,2013-02-09T00:14Z,"thanks for the upload, this is by far the best quality rip out there. and the watermark is a SMALL logo in the corner, can't believe someone would complain over this.."
