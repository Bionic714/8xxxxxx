Trial just got interesting.  Some cute girl from Diaco's firm bought Campbell drinks, lured him into her car and wound up with his brief case.  On the stand, she pretty much took the fifth and couldn't recall a lot about Wed night.  

Bubba's lawyer, Gardener (the surgeon), who wound up with the briefcase and didn't follow the law on what to do when you encounter opposing counsel's stuff took the fifth and not only couldn't recall Wed night, but if it even existed.

A cop testified someone called the DUI Team and told them where Campbell was drinking, wht he looked like, what he was driving and that he was drunk.  Campbell is screaming set up.  


Fox News 13 Tampa has the story. 


Just because it says "no seeds," doesn't mean there aren't any.
