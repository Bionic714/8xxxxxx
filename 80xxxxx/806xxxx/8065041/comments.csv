,MikeR56,2013-01-31T06:33Z,No Beck all this week? I  don't see any recent uploads of anything for over 6 hours now. 
,TeaPeaBee,2013-01-31T08:13Z,"I could be wrong, but maybe it has something to do with the fact that we're all acting like a bunch of ungrateful leeches lately.

Nobody ever says thank you anymore, and people such as yourself, MikeR56, have been snippy in the past when you didn't get your upload in a timely manner.

My excuse is that my usual account (BarrySoetoro) has been relentlessly dicked with by forces unknown. TPB accounts have always been a bit unreliable, but lately I have had to reset my password every time I logged in, and I grew tired of going to my email and confirming just to have to do it again the next day.

Maybe I'm wrong, but put yourself in his shoes... he uploads faithfully, 5 days a week, and gets nothing but the occasional complaint for it."

You're a brat."
