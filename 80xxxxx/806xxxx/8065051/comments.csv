,m0zArT,2013-02-15T13:38Z,"its stuck at 99.98% for some reason. Tried couple of times with the same result. 
Last 3 files in the torrent (including a txt file) are giving the problem. 

Is it just me or anyone else is also facing the problem as well?"
,Waikiki2008,2013-02-18T04:36Z,"m0zArT , it would appear that hundreds of others, are in the same dilemma. Are you saying that all books are complete except the last two years? If thats true, then most of the torrent is intact. How unfortunate that Anonymous has slipped into a coma."
