Description
ΓÇ£If Rick Deckard had carried an iPhone in the movie ΓÇÿBlade RunnerΓÇÖ, and heΓÇÖd used a camera app, that app would have been BLUX. Not only is it a pretty great iPhone camera replacement app, but it has all the bleeps, bloops, on-screen graphics a futuristic sci-fi replicant could ask for. [Heck], it even has a neat computer voice that offers photographic advice.ΓÇ¥ ΓÇôCharlie Sorrel (Cult of Mac)

ΓÇ£Blux has really come up with a new app that offers just about every feature a photographer could ask for all packed into one single app. Their ability to keep a very intuitive interface while still having a million and one features really shows off the complexity of time they spent on the app.ΓÇ¥ ΓÇôMarcus Nguyen (iFans)
