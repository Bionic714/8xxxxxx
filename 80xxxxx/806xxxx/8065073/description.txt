Gundam Evolve (πé¼πâ│πâÇπâáEVOLVE Gandamu Iborubu?), also known as Mobile Suit Gundam Evolve, is a series of short films set in the different timelines of the Gundam series. Originally there were only five Evolve episodes, produced from 2001 to 2003, Bandai started to create new Evolve episodes in 2004. While the first few episodes took place in the Universal Century, the new clips also show Gundams from the other timelines.

The clips often show alternative scenes, side-stories or omakes for fans. The clips feature a mix of animation media which go from traditional cels to 3-D CG rendering to even cell-shaded 2-D animation. The target is to show the Gundams and other mobile suits in high-quality CGI. Currently 15 episodes have been released in three separate volumes, namely Gundam Evolve ../+ ("Plus"), Gundam Evolve ../╬⌐ ("Omega") and Gundam Evolve ../╬æ ("Alpha"). Each volume consists of 5 episodes.

This contains episode originally ripped by the Solar and Digital Panic groups that I have converted into separate files(where they were 5 episodes in one before.) All credit for original rips should go to them I am just trying to get this individual files more wide spread.
