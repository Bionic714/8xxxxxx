Caravaggio's Secrets

Arts Documentary hosted by Jonathan Kydd, published by BSkyB broadcasted as part of BSkyB Masterpieces series in 2012 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

Caravaggio was extraordinarily secretive about the techniques he used to create his ingenious and revolutionary art. He didn't employ assistants and hardly let anyone into his workshop. Although jealous rivals offered rewards to anyone who could discover his trade secrets, he took them to his grave. Or so everyone thought...

Caravaggio had money troubles and was often hounded by bailiffs. Recently, an inventory was discovered detailing belongings in his Roman studio that were repossessed as payment for back rent. At last, this list offered a fascinating insight into the place where he created masterpieces, including David with the Head of Goliath and The Calling of Saint Matthew, and the tools he used.

In this documentary, experts examine his life and the artistic techniques suggested by the revealing inventory. Could his work have demonstrated a technological rather than a stylistic revolution? Was he a true genius or was he using advanced tools to cut corners? Armed with the list, two groups of art students, from London and Rome, put a collection of controversial theories to the test.
