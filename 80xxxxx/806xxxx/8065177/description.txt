McDROID demo is finally here !

McDROID is this crazy original and addictive fusion of Arcade and RTS like you have never played before all wrapped in cartoony 3D graphics.

You play the farming robot McDROID that can also carry weapons for direct combat. In McDROID giant lasers talk, monster mutate and even your strawberries can turn against you and eat you Shuttle.

If the action is too frantic, put down those Teslas and let then link up and fry the Furry worms. Still too tough, bring up to 3 other friends to play co-op multiplayer. 

Turtle up, head-on fight, it's your choice, just don't let your crop rot away.
