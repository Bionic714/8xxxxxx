The River Fuefuki  is famous for its haunting, colorful tinting and stills during numerous 16th-century battle scenes: A poor family living along the river sacrifices son after son, even a daughter, to the campaigns of the never-seen Lord Takeda -- over the generations, they come to dread the sound of frantic feet crossing the bridge and the sight of flames as yet another battle comes dangerously close to their river. The bitter mothers played by Takamine in both this film and Immortal Love defy warmongers and husbands. In the latter, a woman shouts, "Go ahead, hate me! I've suffered and I can suffer more!" It's not masochism so much as a stubborn pride in how much abuse her decent and pure heart can take.
