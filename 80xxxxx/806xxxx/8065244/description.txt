Cool Cats
By Eric Webb

Quick, compare your favorite musicians to types of food. For example: the Foo Fighters are a steak, so rock-solid are they. Janis Joplin is a bowl of grits, obviously. Bon Iver is a delightful, warm chowder of some sort. Perhaps clam.

Miniature Tigers is Cool Whip.

On the Brooklyn indie pop bandΓÇÖs third album, the smirkingly titled ΓÇ£Mia Pharaoh,ΓÇ¥ the name of the game is light and airy with a flavor that canΓÇÖt be beat. Miniature Tigers is a prime example of the synth-heavy dream pop sound that ΓÇ£all those crazy kidsΓÇ¥ are listening to these days. In fact, you could make a mix tape of ΓÇ£Mia PharaohΓÇ¥ and Neon Indian songs, blast it through some speakers and have yourself a very effective trap for V-neck shirts and girls with bangs. IΓÇÖd get snared.

And before diving into the songs, letΓÇÖs reflect on the album title, because this ΓÇª

ΓÇª this is Shakespeare, man.

The opening salvo, ΓÇ£Sex On the Regular,ΓÇ¥ is brimming with energetic cheesiness, best listened to with a pencil-thin mustache creeping up onto your upper lip. ThereΓÇÖs a little Miike Snow, a little Discovery. Like fellow synthsmiths Chromeo, Miniature Tigers capitalize on a brand of pseudo-parody cool that many let go of two decades ago and repurpose it for a good time. ItΓÇÖs the business model of American Apparel, actually.

And that, in some part, is the point: This is not a new style. In many ways, the faux-80s workout video aesthetic is skateboarding and jazzercizing its way out the door faster than Patrick Bateman running down the stairs with a chainsaw. Of course, itΓÇÖs South By Southwest in Austin right now, so maybe IΓÇÖm projecting.

Tracks like ΓÇ£Female DoctorΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£Easy As All ThatΓÇ¥ are perfectly ΓÇ£on messageΓÇ¥ with the refurbished neon nightscapes that Miniature Tigers deals in, and itΓÇÖs just the right kind of winking sleaziness. ΓÇ£BoomerangΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£Angel BathΓÇ¥ both take a little 1950s time warp in moments. I thought I was listening to a Waffle House jukebox for a second. But that embellishment is just a springboard in both cases: ΓÇ£BoomerangΓÇ¥ blends into the rest of ΓÇ£Mia PharaohΓÇ¥ pretty quickly, while ΓÇ£Angel BathΓÇ¥ turns into a David Lynch movie. There is a spooky, angelic backing track that, joined by a horror movie spoken word breakdown and a feedback distortion effect, is essentially a ΓÇ£Blue VelvetΓÇ¥ tribute song. And how appropriate: LynchΓÇÖs film gives the 1960s a love letter, and Miniature Tigers is making out with the 1980s.

More ethereal tracks like ΓÇ£CleopatraΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£Flower DoorΓÇ¥ are dreamy and smooth, while ΓÇ£Afternoons with David HockneyΓÇ¥ is a personal favorite that sounds like Dan Black at his most contemplative. Tying the whole package together? The atypical ΓÇ£Hologram Girl,ΓÇ¥ an acoustic ballad with faraway sadness that is this close to making the rest of the album look a little cheap. ItΓÇÖs a tailored coat in thrift store full of (albeit fun and charming) windbreakers.

Full disclosure: I am trying so hard to write around using the word ΓÇ£hipsterΓÇ¥ in this review. This writerΓÇÖs internal thesaurus has run out of pages. Miniature Tigers makes music soaked in Pabst Blue Ribbon. Call it indie, call it whatever, but thatΓÇÖs what it is. And it is a fine example of it. Separate yourself from the associations you have about a promotional mix CD from Urban Outfitters, and hear me out.

Maybe there is a dose of irony in ΓÇ£Mia Pharaoh.ΓÇ¥ Maybe itΓÇÖs an unstoppable, all-consuming, nigh insatiable wildfire of irony. I donΓÇÖt care, and no one should. I listen to music because itΓÇÖs good and because itΓÇÖs fun. ΓÇ£Mia PharaohΓÇ¥ is golden in my book
