Re-issue of the LP originally released in 1983 with 6 bonus tracks:

- tracks 15, 16 & 18 are B-sides.

The fourth and last album from the Derry, Ireland band was released in 1983 to a very disinterested public after the pre-release singles saw how they'd abandoned their shuffling, postpunk, eager teen energy for blue-eyed soul. They'd hit the UK top 20 a few times before this with such classics as "My Perfect Cousin," but "The Love Parade" missed the top 40 and the cover of the Isleys' "Got to Have You Back" failed completely. Feargal Sharkey's voice is very strong, and the whole album's quite good, but it remains an unfortunate example of how to alienate your audience.
