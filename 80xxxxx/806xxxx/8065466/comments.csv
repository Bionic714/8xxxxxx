,Bizzwoofer,2013-01-28T20:19Z,"Hey man! You are a rockstar for these uploads so kudos for sure.  Just wanna make a request though - Right now I am looking for the TTC video course called The History of the Bible: The Making of the New Testament Canon (also by Bart D. Ehrman).  So, let me know. It would be of great help.... but regardless of that, thank you again so much because peer to peer is a great cause. Poeple should be free to share with each other what they will without outside influence - REGARDLESS of what it is or where it comes from, and the people who fight and work to keep it alive are brave soldiers of the truth and human dignity to have the spine to actually stand up for our individual liberties (which get so very trampled on by the cowards with the loudest voices) at our collective expense. So my thank you is for more than just your upload, but for a higher moral justice and cause that I believe to be good. It blows my mind how some will go out of there way, just to be bitter bastards, but I guess that is the world now. Thank you."
