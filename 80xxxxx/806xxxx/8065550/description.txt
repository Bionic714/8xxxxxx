Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site :: On the Friday, January 25 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex runs down details on Feinstein's draconian gun legislation rolled out yesterday. He also talks about police arresting smart meter activists on their own private property. 

On today's broadcast, Alex talks with author and journalist Jerome Corsi in-studio. Alex and Mr. Corsi will talk about Obama's second term agenda and Dr. Jim Garrow's claim that Obama is using a "litmus test" to determine who in the military will fire on U.S. citizens. Corsi is the author of numerous books including, America for Sale: Fighting the New World Order, Surviving a Global Depression, and Preserving USA Sovereignty and Where's the Birth Certificate?: The Case that Barack Obama is not Eligible to be President.

Note: As has become usual practice, when one of Alex's partners in his nutrition supplement marketing business is on the show, they are not mentioned in the official show description. Alex's guest for approximately the last hour and a half of the broadcast is phamacist Ben Fuchs. Even Alex calls it "infomercial-ing."
