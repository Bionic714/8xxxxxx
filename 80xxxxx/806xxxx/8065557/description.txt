When someone enters a heterosexual marriage only to come out years later, what happens to the marriage, the spouse and the children? Ricki's joined by a group of fascinating guests, including a Mormon husband (who is openly gay) and his wife (also the mother of their three children). 

In addition, Ricki speaks with a daughter who is still angry with her father for coming out of the closet when she was in college and a woman with two children who left her heterosexual marriage for a lesbian lifestyle. A fascinating group of guests who are emblematic of a situation that is more common than you think.
