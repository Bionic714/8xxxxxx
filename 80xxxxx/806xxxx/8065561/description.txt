Mac gamers rejoice: Origin for Mac will be launching soon, and starting today weΓÇÖre offering you the opportunity to take it for a spin before the official release (UK fans click here) .This open alpha will only be available to a few thousand users in North America and the United Kingdom, so donΓÇÖt waitΓÇödownload your copy of our new Mac client (alpha build) today.  

With Origin for Mac weΓÇÖll be able to offer the same Origin experience and features that define our PC app ΓÇö cloud storage, auto-patching, friends list, and more ΓÇö to Mac users everywhere. WeΓÇÖre very excited about the upcoming launch of Origin for Mac and the opportunity to reach the millions of Mac-based gamers out there.  WeΓÇÖre continuing to build Origin into a gaming service that truly lets you purchase and play anywhere, anytime.  

You may notice that the Origin Store tab is not yet live in this alpha trial; rest assured, the store will be liveΓÇöwith a great catalog of EA and partner titlesΓÇöwhen we formally release the client. Additionally, weΓÇÖre not yet able to provide the same one-click streaming live to Twitch in Origin for Mac (weΓÇÖll be adding this as soon as possible).  

Otherwise, the Mac client feels and behaves exactly like the PC version. Just like PC gamers, you'll be able to add non-Origin games to your library, use the Origin In Game overlay, chat with friends across platforms and games, and can continue your saved progress from any Origin-enabled Mac.  

In order to make sure you can get the most out of this alpha trial, weΓÇÖve added a free copy of PopCapΓÇÖs smash hit puzzle game, Bookworm, to your My Games library. This game is yours to download and keep, on us. We hope you enjoy it.  

Finally, youΓÇÖll notice a Feedback button in your My Games library; itΓÇÖs only there temporarily, but we hope you will use it to share your thoughts with us ΓÇô after all, thatΓÇÖs what alpha access is for! If you have any further questions, check the FAQ here or comment below.

Your participation in this alpha trial is greatly appreciated, and your feedback will help ensure the best possible experience for all Mac gamers when we officially launch. If you have a Mac running OS X 10.6.8 or newer with an Intel Core 2 Duo processor or better, we hope youΓÇÖll download the alpha and start gaming today.
