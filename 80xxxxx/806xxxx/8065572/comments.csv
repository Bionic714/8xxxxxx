The versions known to be complete are Studio Masters and Canadian TV Land.

I compared this against the season 1-3 torrent and found that the seasons 1-3 episodes (from American TV Land) have footage cut outt, as can be seen from the run time.

Comparing against retr0tv shows that most of the season 2 episodes there are low resolution and heavily cut.  The exception is 51-60, which are Canadian TV Land and are complete.  (retr0tv seasons 1 and 3 also seem to be complete.)

The uncut 51 runs a minute longer than the 51 from this torrent.  However, the difference seems to be caused by these being slightly sped up, not by missing footage, so (assuming the others are like 51) this is finally an uncut torrent for season 2."
