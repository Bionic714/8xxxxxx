Wealthy entrepreneur Bruce Wayne and his ward Dick Grayson lead a double life; they are actually the crime fighting duo Batman and Robin. When crime strikes in Gotham city, Police Commissioner Gordon contacts the dynamic duo to handle those master criminals who are too much for the regular police. A secret Batpole in the Wayne mansion leads to the Batcave, the official base of the super heroes.
