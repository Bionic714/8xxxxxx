You'd have to be dumb to think that the American characters speak Hungarian, Czech or Russian... Do you want to hear Oscar-nominated Frank Langella, or some godforsaken East-European third-rate voice actor's impersonation of the character? If you already have a bunch of subtitles, why bother with language streams? 

When you cram all those five audio streams into a DVD5, you get something like 3 GB left for video...  WHY?

Why not remove all the useless languages, and leave in place real valuable extras, like a director's commentary, a making-of documentary, or something that adds more knowledge about the film and its ideas, instead of encouraging laziness from people who can't speak another language, and are too dumb to read subtitles in their obscure native tongue???"
