This softcover edition of a very popular two-volume work presents a thorough first course in analysis, leading from real numbers to such advanced topics as differential forms on manifolds, asymptotic methods, Fourier, Laplace, and Legendre transforms, elliptic functions and distributions. Especially notable in this course is the clearly expressed orientation toward the natural sciences and its informal exploration of the essence and the roots of the basic concepts and theorems of calculus. Clarity of exposition is matched by a wealth of instructive exercises, problems and fresh applications to areas seldom touched on in real analysis books. The first volume constitutes a complete course on one-variable calculus along with the multivariable differential calculus elucidated in an up-to-day, clear manner, with a pleasant geometric flavor.
