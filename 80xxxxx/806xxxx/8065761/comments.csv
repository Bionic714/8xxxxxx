,bmidnight72,2013-01-26T04:51Z,"Is this the first season of ""War of the Damned""?  since there is no season 3!  "
,bmidnight72,2013-01-26T04:53Z,This would be season 4 if you wanted to count all the Spartacus seasons
,kel1235789,2013-01-26T04:58Z,Yes this is the one that aired tonight... It is the third year they have had the show that is why the uploader called it season 3 episode 1... Personally I thought that that was common sense 
,neoXank,2013-01-26T05:02Z,Waiting for seeds..
,breaknight,2013-01-26T05:18Z,@bmidnight72 season 3 just came out tonight
,Dufox,2013-01-26T05:20Z,"spartacus doesn't really go by seasons, every new season has a different name.

the prelude ""season 2"" will confuse the shit out of anyone who searches for Spartacus by seasons.

this is the final season of the show tho."
