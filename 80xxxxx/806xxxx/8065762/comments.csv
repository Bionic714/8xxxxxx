,mattm2047,2013-01-26T05:45Z,Isnt this supposed to be episode 14?
[T],MrUnpopular,2013-01-26T06:14Z,"If you count the 2 specials after the midseason finale, then yes. But as for the actual series, this is the 12th episode."
[V],psspss,2013-01-26T06:25Z,"have to agree with unpop 2 episodes were specials
not normal episodes

tvrage thrown a spanner in the works as usual"
[V],psspss,2013-01-26T06:26Z,"amazes me how a tvripper can beat a scene ripper often by many hours

cheers as usual.. but I have to convert it to xvid and smaller size :)"
[T],MrUnpopular,2013-01-26T06:53Z,"We've beat KILLERS and 2HD by mere minutes before, just to see if we could. The scene doesn't *have* to release instantly, it's their call. They just tend to."
,mark13077,2013-01-26T07:53Z,What is the quality like?
,mattm2047,2013-01-26T08:00Z,My mistake. Thanks for the upload!

,NelfKnight,2013-01-26T12:32Z,out of sync on my lg tv.
,vopal,2013-01-26T13:40Z,Thank you!
[V],psspss,2013-01-26T23:02Z,"yeah unpopular dont encode mp4s that same way as others.. the framerate reported by mediainfo wad variable and came out at 25.986 or something

I suspect its throwing out some tvs.. I didnt change force it in my convert either sadly.. but I did for bering sea

anyhow suggest people download serviio its free media server and should replace windows crap liek media center and it transcode on the fly so should be in sync"
[T],MrUnpopular,2013-01-26T23:35Z,"Dunno, I set it to constant framerate of 23.whateverthenumbersareforntscfilm in Handbrake and yeah it did its thing. Oh well. Killers has a better version."
[V],psspss,2013-01-27T10:35Z,"unpopular check out megui for windows its not bad for a free encoder can set size etc the 1 click
encoder may work better for you
however it dont have a editor but most just use avimuxgui or virtualdub editor

handbrake I guess thats mac?"
[T],MrUnpopular,2013-01-27T18:09Z,Handbrake is Windows and Mac.
,nandos421,2013-01-28T07:46Z,Your quality is shit as always. Seriously it looks like it was recorded with a potato.
,nandos421,2013-01-28T08:17Z,TvTeam has the same episode in HD without cropping at a smaller file size. I don't understand why this one is more popular when it is inferior. 
[T],MrUnpopular,2013-01-28T18:33Z,@nandos421 Because this one was uploaded right  after it aired. The other was uploaded over 12 hours later.
