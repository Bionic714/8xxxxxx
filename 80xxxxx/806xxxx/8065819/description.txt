Battlestar.Galactica.Extras.Grace.Park.Edit.bsg4you

These 3 videos are a fanedit of all of the Grace Park clips from the Battlestar Galactica Blu-Ray box set extras covering all 4 seasons and the movies Razor and The Plan. There are 3 files to account for the different resolutions and aspect ratios. The audio was usually decreased if the clip showed Grace with other people talking, e.g. a cameraman talking technical issues with Grace in the video.

If you like Boomer, Athena, Eights or are simply a Grace Park fan, you'll like this. No more waiting for Grace to pop up while watching the extras! :)

For a detailed list of which clips come from which extras, please see the individual nfo files. Also, the type of clip - interview, raw footage, behind the scenes, etc - is listed in each nfo.
