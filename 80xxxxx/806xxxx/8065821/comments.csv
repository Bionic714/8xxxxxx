,ocurgus,2013-01-30T23:39Z,"SBonesE8, you can't broadcast 1080p over networks yet. It's only 720p/1080i currently so the only time you see 1080p rips are when it's released on bluray and since this season is still on the air, you have to wait. For now, you have to enjoy the same quality everyone else does on the HD channels."
