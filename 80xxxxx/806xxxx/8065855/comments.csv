,Chartsandgrafs,2013-01-26T08:23Z,"I don't understand.  How can the file size be 6.6 GiB with a resolution of only 704x352?  AVI?  

What are the correct specs on this movie?  "
,kakifej2b,2013-01-26T08:35Z,"720p is fake, so probably this too."
,Emmons131,2013-01-26T17:29Z,"Bad rip... 352 is correct, not 1080. No idea why it's so big"
,Awast,2013-01-27T14:06Z,"Do not download, pile of crap!"
,f-rat,2013-01-27T17:30Z,"FAKE BluRay rip, just an upscaled Xvid... 

V = 2
A = 4
M = 8"
,BobRolha,2013-01-31T19:19Z,Do you don't know rip movies? There are real 1080p quality movies with 1Gb that's better quality than this. Afff ....

[V],meech,2013-02-01T15:10Z,"Not sure why there are so many seeders/leechers.  This is horrible quality.  6.61 GB for a blocky mess.  I don't know why people post torrents like this.  What in the world does it accomplish?!  Anyway, the previous comments are right, this is garbage.  Do not download.  If you want a blocky mess, at least save the space and download one of the smaller torrents.  As for me, I will wait until a real HD rip comes out."
