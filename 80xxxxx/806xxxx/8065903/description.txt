Prism (or PRiSM) is a Canadian rock band originally from Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. They were active from 1977 to 1984 and are active again from 1988 to present. The band's sound is a mix of Album-Oriented Rock (AOR) and pop rock. They have released a total of 13 albums to date. Their success has been primarily in Canada where they won the Canadian music industry Juno Award for Group of the Year in 1981. Prism is noteworthy for launching the careers of international record producer Bruce Fairbairn and songwriter Jim Vallance.

Prism's 5th Album, Young and Restless, was released in 1980. This was the first Prism album written without any contributions from Vallance: all songs were written by Mitchell, Harlow or Norton. The album spun off Prism's highest charting single, also called "Young and Restless", which peaked at #14 on the Canadian charts.
