,TRoN_1,2013-01-26T05:41Z,No seeds?
,MikeR56,2013-01-26T05:58Z,Fuck Bill Maher. Liberal piece of shit.
,zbiggie,2013-01-26T06:19Z,"@MikeR56

Don't know why you would say liberal piece of shit. If you are so conservative why are you on this website or for that matter the internet. These two are the two most liberal ideas which can exist. How can you say Fuck Liberal ideals and still be supporting this site. 

No, sir, fuck you."
,fmj77,2013-01-26T06:33Z,"Bill Maher is an idiot leftist liberal who calls himself a ""Libertarian"". Fucking liar!"
,ziggyff,2013-01-26T06:43Z,THANX ..DL WENT LIGHTNING QWIK AFTER INITIAL DELAY...WILL SEED ALL NITE...FINALLY GETTING TO SEE THIS ON A FRIDAY NITE
,jcdugger,2013-01-26T06:46Z,Love me some Bill Maher!
,ziggyff,2013-01-26T06:47Z,MikeR56 and fmj77 are lowlife Repub scum and typical of selfish pricks from that party they offer no downloads as well..I hope the farm animals they do at night give them an exotic sheep VD
,bashmet,2013-01-26T06:47Z,"@fmj77: LOL, you dumb bastard. He hasn't called himself a libertarian since Politically Incorrect. "
,bp1924,2013-01-26T06:47Z,@fmj77 @MikeR56 No one is forcing you to download this... So why do you feel the need to comment?
[T],Skymocker,2013-01-26T07:10Z,I tend to think that people who seek out things they don't like purely for the sake of telling people (who don't care) that they don't like it.  Talk about being the lowest form of life.
,acsmith1972,2013-01-26T07:14Z,"Bashmet: He calls himself a libertarian in almost every episode of Real Time, but it doesn't matter because fmj and mike are idiots and have no idea what left is. Bill's definitely liberal, but closer to the center. Me, I'm more left than that but far away from the fuckin hippies on the far left. "
,North333,2013-01-26T07:25Z,"Good torrent, no complaints on quality. Thanks a lot for getting this up so quickly, it beats the hell out of watching it on Saturday."
,sunnydavis,2013-01-26T08:39Z,"Being a liberal is quite different than being a libertarian.

@MikeR56 despite not very bright, correctly stated that Bill Maher is a liberal.

@fmj77 on the other hand is a retard I mean mentally challenged to not knowing the difference of the two."
,CoBrit,2013-01-26T08:39Z,"Enough of the political commentary. This is the Pirate Bay, not Fox News. I find it interesting that you feel that you have to make such comments to people who don't give a fuck what you believe!"
,dgaijin,2013-01-26T09:46Z,"Fuck, I expect trolls on message boards but what the fuck! God dammit, if you don't want to see shit like this , fine. But don't bring your retarded ass comments just for the hell of it. Don't you tea baggers have something else to do like fucking your sister or your mom?

Thank you bp1924 for the seed. Unfortunately some assholes are trying to shit on it."
,hatepig,2013-01-26T10:03Z,"liberals are almost as bad as conservatives. they're just as ignorant, but at least have slightly good intentions unlike modern republicans. anyone who faithfully buys into the 2 party system is a part of the problem."
,fmj77,2013-01-26T10:08Z,"Ziggyff, how dare you call me a Republican!?"
,JarjarTwink,2013-01-26T10:27Z,Jar Jar abrahams is directing the new star wars movie. we are all doomed. 
,binkmale,2013-01-26T10:28Z,"Thanks, the quality was good enough for talking heads around a desk, and the download size is reasonable.    All the whiners here can switch on Fox News and STFU."
,Ryan_Maiden,2013-01-26T10:59Z,"Thanks for the torrent. Not concerned about the quality, I just like it to be uploaded swiftly. Please keep it up!"
,Halbermunken,2013-01-26T11:06Z,"Wow, cool, the low information voters are here. And as expected their argumentation level is non-existent, it's emotions in the typical anger mode which is the only one available inside their small minds."
,Babygeorge,2013-01-26T11:08Z,I got a crush on Bill Maher and I love this show and bp1924 for uploading it!!!! 
,GeniusAnomaly,2013-01-26T11:31Z,"maybe the audio could be 128kbps next time, please, thanks for the upload."
,iamralph,2013-01-26T12:57Z,"ty for upload, and seconded the audio bitrate next time, sac more video bitrate if you have to "
,iamralph,2013-01-26T12:58Z,"k nvm, cant even play the file"
,iamralph,2013-01-26T13:01Z,nvm my comment above got it working dunno what was up
,moonerman100,2013-01-26T14:55Z,Thank you for sharing! :)
,eros_man_gr,2013-01-26T15:02Z,"It's bizarre how many messages here are about Bill Maher and what they think of him and his political views. If you don't like him, then don't watch him, and above all, stop trolling here on Pirate Bay. Comments are supposed to be about the clips."
,Retrenched,2013-01-26T15:50Z,"Simply stated, Bill Maher RULES!  The goofy, hapless TeaPubs are all beside themselves with guys like Bill (e.g., Jon, Michael, Keith) because they have no ability to grasp the notion of intelligent, informed satire.  All they really have in the way of 'humor' is the pathetic, has-been pair of Miller & Stein... snicker!  And don't even get me started on music (Kid & Ted)... chortle, guffaw!!"
,indigit4l,2013-01-26T18:19Z,"He's liberal?!? Oh my god, thank goodness you guys spoke up! I knew I liked this show so I came here to download it, but after watching it all these years I'm now converting my beliefs because of the commenters! Thank you guys"

watchable but not good, as said in description.  

thx bp1924
"
,timothx,2013-01-26T18:32Z,There are six versions of last week's episode. Why only one for this week? I cannot be the only one waiting for a higher quality video.
,J3rryKo42O,2013-01-26T18:50Z,Thanks for the upload and also for the heads up about the quality!! Much appreciated.
,stegman,2013-01-26T18:51Z,"There will be a scene release, surely.
But they have to wait for a re-run to get the show and rip it, 
since all the groups obviously missed the premiere last night."
,BPeppy1,2013-01-26T19:03Z,Allow me to add my thanks to bp1924 for putting this out so soon after broadcast.  The torrent is  is definitely watchable but the video bit rate is low low so the picture is some what pixelated.  Audio is mono but clear.
,BeagleBandit,2013-01-26T20:02Z,Thanks for the quick up!
,AlienYouCallGod,2013-01-26T20:03Z,Quality is quite poor for this... You could watch it but  I myself will be waiting for a higher quality version.
,timothx,2013-01-26T22:49Z,"@stegman, Last night was not the premiere; that would have been last week's show, on the 18th."
,timothx,2013-01-26T22:50Z,"@AlienYouCallGod, your wait is over: http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8069377/Real.Time.with.Bill.Maher.2013.01.25.HDTV.x264-2HD.[VTV].mp4"
,ikepon,2013-01-26T23:11Z,"Dude!! You should do this every time. I'm gonna wait for one of the nicer ones now that it's saturday anyway, but I can't tell you how many times I wish someone would just do a rush job and get it to my plate before the overtime gets cold."
,stegman,2013-01-26T23:23Z,"@timothx - I know. :) 
This is 2nd show of this season. I didn't mean the season premiere, 
I used the expression premiere in the sense of 'first / live / original broadcast' of this particular show - 1/25/2013."
