,khillik,2013-01-26T15:17Z,"@ lamportyx 
 have you always been this stupid or have you recently gone full retard? its kind of hard to have a higher seeder/leecher ratio when not enough fucking people have downloaded the file. now that you have given it some god damn time its 17351 seeders and 10524 leechers. now feel free to go fuck yourself."
,khillik,2013-01-26T15:19Z,and almost forgot THANK YOU eztv for all your hard work and outstanding uploads.
,BuddyButz,2013-01-26T15:39Z,"THIS IS LABELED INCORRECTLY!!

THIS IS SEASON 4!

S1 blood and sand

S2 gods of the arene (prequal to blood and sand)

S3 Vengeance 

S4 War Of Damned

The Internet is Mislabeling This season because of season 2 starting with the new spartacus because the old guy died"
,marionetti,2013-01-26T16:37Z,Thank you eztv !!! GOOD Work ! I will seed as long as i can ...
,sheik3007,2013-01-26T22:26Z,"@BuddyButz no, your mistaken, the torrent is labelled correctly, because gods of the arena was only a mini-series created only to pass time whilst  Andy Whitfield got better, which he didn't"
,chernye,2013-01-27T03:08Z,"when i saw this i said to myself ""jesus fucking christ"". and i'm an atheist. that's how fucking psyched i am because this is finally here."

,badadaha,2013-01-29T00:56Z,"@BuddyButz sheik3007 is right, Spartacus: God of the Arena is not considered a season of Spartacus. Source: iMDB"

,undertm,2013-02-09T10:32Z,"Hi All

Is this really season 4. I think this is listed incorrectly."
,jala0011,2013-02-23T22:12Z,"Great episode, nice plot so far. Storyline is intelligent and i wouldn't change it even a bit. Quality - A10 V10. I usually watch everything at film.plotar.org	because they always have HD but they don't have tv shows so having TPB for TVshows is great, thnx!"
,Jack_Reacher,2013-02-24T03:07Z,Thanks for all the great things you bring us! eztv for the win!
,vampzcore,2013-03-06T23:55Z,"thanks eztv & seeders!!
