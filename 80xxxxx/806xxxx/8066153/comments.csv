,JGuiRa,2013-01-26T08:38Z,Thank you so much. I just finished downloading it and went through a few pages and it looks amazing! I wanted to ask you if you can upload a PDF of the strategy guide. I've been looking for Guide everywhere and It sold out. I will be seeding this torrent for a while.

I don't have a band saw, and don't want to destroy my only copy of the guide. I'm sure it will come back in stock at Amazon soon, and I highly recommend purchasing it if you have the means - it's an amazing book."

,BerserkLeon,2013-02-07T06:04Z,"How did you generate this? I know not many games have in-game manuals, but even so this seems like a valuable skill."
,sstiles,2013-02-11T20:16Z,"This was generated by extracting the images from the game disc using various tools and scripts. After the images were extracted, they were chopped in half and combined into a PDF and then TOC and hyperlinks were added by hand."
