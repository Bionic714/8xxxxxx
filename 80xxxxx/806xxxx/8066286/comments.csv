,NB1986,2013-03-04T11:16Z,I don't know if this is happening for anyone else but at the end of Chapter 6 when you're supposed to search Lisa's body to get her scarf you can't click on her. I then noticed the only thing I could do was talk to Duve and Bent. Plus if I clicked anywhere on the screen Fae would walk on it regardless of gravity. This is clearly a huge glitch that prevents you from finishing the game. Does anyone know of a fix?

Why do you write this comment on several uploaders page of the same game? You need to specify which download exactly you are referring to because it might happen with one version but not with all."

,Yorkfield,2013-03-07T13:18Z,"Ok, I was looking for isues with this game and found the developer's forum, where people complain about a lot of different glitches. Some of them are fixable:

,NB1986,2013-03-08T02:45Z,Has anyone successfully completed this game using this torrent? 
,NB1986,2013-03-08T07:50Z,"Nevermind I just beat it. I ended up starting all over. This time though I went straight to the body to check for the scarf instead of talking to anyone. I don't know if that makes a difference but it seemed to on my end. Still couldn't save after level 5 though. Strange.

Glitches aside, the game was great! I love it!"
