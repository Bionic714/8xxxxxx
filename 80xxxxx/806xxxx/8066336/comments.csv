dont complain when something is free and shared at someones elses expensive"
[V],psspss,2013-01-26T11:08Z,"theres about 5 cliches through but thats the source had to work with.. some sound dips and video hangs
perhaps its antenna noise but stays in sync"

[V],psspss,2013-01-26T22:47Z,"i forced the framerate on this rip as unpopulars mediainfo etc were reporting it as 25.89 or something

if you stream to devices check out serviio media server its free soft and transcodes , just use the correct profile.. I suggest panasonic veria seems to work on most tvs properly"
