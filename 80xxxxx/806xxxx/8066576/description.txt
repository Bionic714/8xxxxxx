MECHANICAL VIBRATIONS: THEORY AND APPLICATIONS takes an applications-based approach at teaching students to apply previously learned engineering principles while laying a foundation for engineering design. This text provides a brief review of the principles of dynamics so that terminology and notation are consistent and applies these principles to derive mathematical models of dynamic mechanical systems. The methods of application of these principles are consistent with popular Dynamics texts. Numerous pedagogical features have been included in the text in order to aid the student with comprehension and retention. These include the development of three benchmark problems which are revisited in each chapter, creating a coherent chain linking all chapters in the book. Also included are learning outcomes, summaries of key concepts including important equations and formulae, fully solved examples with an emphasis on real world examples, as well as an extensive exercise set including objective-type questions.
