,codenamejag,2013-03-27T18:10Z,"the audio and video quality on this one is great.
one thing i'm not sure how to fix is the subs. this doesn't come with subs...however i understand you can download subs else where...but for some reason the subs just don't sync..."
,codenamejag,2013-03-27T18:16Z,"sorry for the double post.
subs can be found here http://subscene.com/subtitles/the-walking-dead-third-season 
just download the ones which end with ""1080p.WEB-DL.AAC2.0.H.264"""
