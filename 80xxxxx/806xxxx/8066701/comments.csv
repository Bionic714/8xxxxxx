I can't believe the nerve of some people on this site... it's free! You have absolutely no right to complain either say thank you or STFU"

720p counts the black margins. When you rip a film you don't usually process the black margins because it is useless and it reduces the size of the file."

Width:852 mpixels
Height:480 pixels

This is NOT 720p. And the 'black margins' are non-existent in TV shows as the 1280x720 resolution is the normal 16:9 screen rate resolution.

This should be labeled 480p, not 720p."
