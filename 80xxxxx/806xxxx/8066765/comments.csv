,Snowhick,2013-01-26T10:40Z,But my guess is you could use it on a normal machine too. Just make sure you reinstall the battery manager.
,Snowhick,2013-01-26T13:06Z,"Or don't install it if you're not using a laptop, hehe."
,Kayto,2013-01-27T23:04Z,so when i install it it says 'insert the disk labeled: VMware VMSCSI Controller Disk into drive A: Press ENTER when ready' What do i do? 
,Snowhick,2013-01-28T09:27Z,Try pushing F6 when it's labeled.
,Snowhick,2013-01-28T09:27Z,"I mean, while it's setting up in the beginning. The txt scrolling at the bottom."
,Kayto,2013-01-29T00:49Z,"Well now when I try to load the vm itself in VM Ware, I get a message saying 

NTLDR is missing
Press Crtl Alt Del to restart
_

I do what it tells me and I get the same thing again. I did nothing to the machine between the first time a got the message

insert the disk labeled: VMware VMSCSI Controller Disk into drive A: 
Press ENTER when ready

and the time (right now) I get the NTLDR message. 

lol i like the bill gates pic tho xD its hilarious on this page!"
,Kayto,2013-01-29T01:07Z,"i got the installation to work again by removing the vm completely and reinstalling the machine, not the os... and it is so tempermental!! nothing happens when i press F6... I really want to be able to use XP as a vm, and i guess this isn't the one to use... back to the drawing boards..."
,Snowhick,2013-01-29T15:21Z,"Thank you for the replies, i am currently working on a Windows XP 64bit version ;)"
