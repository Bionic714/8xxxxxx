This is for using in a VM(Virtual Machine), i have removed alot of useless stuff with nLite(Thanks for a brilliant program guys!).

Remember to use "Virtual Harddrive" in the VM program of your choosing, or else it will not detect a harddrive during setup.

I did *not* remove the original set-up guide at start(I figured you wanted to do that yourself)

Supports ALL languages.

NO KEY IS INCLUDED(You all know where to find those..(hint, Windows XP key generator))

And i personally use third-party programs for the basic windows functions, so naturally i removed alot of the horrific standard programs that comes with XP.
So naturally, use the program of your choice for different functions

I recommend Uxtheme Multi-Patcher to make XP look better, if you so choose.

I also recommend you update Internet Explorer before you download Firefox/Chrome.

Unfortunately, you need to update XP.

I hope you enjoy this torrent.

I think i will do the same with Windows 7 soon. And i will do a much better job, not just for VM use.

Suggestions is wanted, what can i do to improve my release?


So look out!
