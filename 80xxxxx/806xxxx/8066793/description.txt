Aircom GCSE Electronics - Educational Software


Comprehensive delivery of the course material is achieved through dividing the content into five sections. The student is encouraged to work through each section, rather than rapidly move from one to another, thus maintaining cognitive flow. The text is fully narrated and supported by high quality graphics and 3D animations. Virtually immediate feedback is given by means of regular tests with questions chosen at random from a computer-stored list. Worked solutions are available when required. Mock examinations consist of 6 short papers each of 5 questions. Following computer assessment, model solutions may be viewed. Unlimited attempts at each paper are possible. The Construction Laboratory takes students through a construction project step by step, allowing interactivity in testing the circuit. The working of the circuit is thoroughly explained in a stimulating manner supported by high quality graphics.
