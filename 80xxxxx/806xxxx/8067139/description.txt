"The Prisoner" is a unique piece of television. It addresses issues such as personal 
identity and freedom, democracy, education, scientific progress, art and technology, 
while still remaining an entertaining drama series. Over seventeen episodes we witness 
a war of attrition between the faceless forces behind 'The Village' (a Kafkaesque 
community somewhere between Butlins and Alcatraz) and its most strong willed inmate, 
No. 6. who struggles ceaselessly to assert his individuality while plotting to escape 
from his captors.
