The program can't start because OpenAl32.dll is missing from your computer. try reinstalling the program to fix this problem. 

i have reinstalled it several times and it continues to do this. please help"
,hayenne,2013-01-26T22:36Z,@Baman999 you need to install OpenAL in order to start the game: http://connect.creativelabs.com/openal/Downloads/oalinst.zip
,hayenne,2013-01-26T22:37Z,"*** Guys, you probably made the same mistake I did - you searched for ""Baldur's Gate"" while the most torrents are at ""Baldurs Gate"" - the latest SKIDROW 2012 release is just here: http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7869513/Baldurs_Gate_Enhanced_Edition-SKIDROW_(2012)_ENG_Multi6"
,Baman909,2013-01-26T23:21Z,@hayenne thank you game works great now
,Zakesque,2013-01-30T03:59Z,"Having an issue.  Installed without any trouble, had to download the openal file, and it ran perfectly fine.  Made it through character creation, and as soon as the game starts, I get an error, and it crashes.  Not sure what's going on.  Help?"
,hayenne,2013-02-17T20:53Z,"@Zakesque: sorry mate, not sure what's wrong. Myself, I had an issue right after the game actually starts, the screen went white. I installed the latest drivers (ATI Catalyst in my case) and it was gone. Try updating the video drivers? "
