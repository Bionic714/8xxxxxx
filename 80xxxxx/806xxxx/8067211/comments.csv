,caliboy13,2013-01-27T21:42Z,Actually wasn't bad at all the audio is a bit off but not much and pic looks alot better if u just watch it on comp and not tv... really nice job no background noises. was able to hear and see movie good A/6 V/7... thx uploader u saved me 10 bucks and drivin in freezing rain kudos
,vocalised80,2013-01-28T01:41Z,"Fuck off spamming fucks!!

Scene...... big thnx bro, watchable, tiny bit cropped
A/7.5 is pretty good for a cam no background noise 
and clear, sample is in synch
V/6-7 for a cam but again very very watchable

SEED PEEPS
LEECHERS NEVER PROSPER"
,vocalised80,2013-01-28T02:16Z,"No-one else mentioned it's on a slight slant though.

In the back ground of first scene in RC office
the fire place or mantle is sloping upwards 
making it look as if RC is going uphill to his
counterpart who is actually on the same level
floor hahaha.

Still watchable and gonna watch it but yeh the background is tilted, gonna drop and trip out!!"
,vocalised80,2013-01-28T04:30Z,"Cool, the slant sorts itself out.

at about 1hour 09minutes VLC track synch to minus
300th of a sec to stop synch issues at that point, new A/V 7/7.5"
,santana15,2013-02-05T21:06Z,"people do not go to those sites that they are telling
you can watch movies for free it is a scam
film.ezesc.com and so on all the same site.
they ask you for your credit card and personel
stuff beware."
