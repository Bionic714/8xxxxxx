Luscious, lovely lolita can have anything she wants and that usually means men! Join heras she conquers the family doctor, some local repairmen, her best friend Sissy and finally her favorite Rock Star! Angel West as Lolita fits the bill: she looks underage, and untalented filmmaker Leonard Kirtman as "Leon Gucci" exploits that fact. Despite the big opening disclaimer that the cast is the proper age, this is all about feeding the pederast segment of the adult market. Lolita's misadventures including humping with a Tim Curry lookalike named Jimmy (attention: RH fans); having a lesbian dalliance with best buddy Karen Summer; experimenting with two guys at once, and doing plenty of spying on other folks. Zebedy Colt receives a film editor credit, but none of his interesting if weird antics are present. As far as title roler Angel West, she made a career catering to underage fantasies, even accompanying the later-officially underage Traci Lords in JEAN GENIE, a film which is undoubtedly lost thanks to its illegality.
