,Mr_Ceiling_Cat,2013-01-27T13:09Z,this update fixes a bug where the game would default to low hz each time you start it
,Dunge,2013-01-27T19:59Z,Yeah I though the game was laggy until I realized it was at 23hz. Put it back at 60hz it's much better but it's still jerking a bit.
,tallcabsfall,2013-01-31T02:25Z,Utorrent says this contains files that may harm my computer... I've never seen that before so it has to mean somehting bad.
