And here you go, the first The Extraordinary Adventures of Adele Blanc-Sec books.

The adventures, set in Paris in the years before and after World War I, revolve around the protagonist Ad√®le Blanc-Sec. A cynical heroine, she is initially a novelist of popular fiction, who turns to investigative journalism as her research and subsequent adventures reveal further details of the mystical world of crime. Themes of the occult, corruption, official incompetence, and the dangers of patriotism suffuse the series.
