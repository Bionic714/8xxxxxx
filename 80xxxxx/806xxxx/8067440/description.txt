And here you go, a little gem from DarthScanner and Alice.

Daytona dreams of becoming a race driver and win the Daytona 500. Meanwhile, he must be run on the circuits as seedy and dangerous to repay a debt to his manager, an unscrupulous racketeer. One day, however, Daytona escapes from the clutches of this shark and surveyed the country to meet an old man of passion.

In the prestigious amphitheatre of the Neptune Palace, Burt Styler and Mayor Banks announce the start of the Golden Cup; a unique and prestigious race around the world! At the same time, miles away, two fates are intertwined; that of Daytona, a street-kid with an innate drivers instinct, and that of Kelly Styler, the billionaires heir! Golden Cup is part of the Golden City series.
