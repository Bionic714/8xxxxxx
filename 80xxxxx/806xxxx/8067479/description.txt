And another one from Sosich and Alice

Rudi and Bernd, the heroes of a new trilogy by Marvano, are racing drivers with a love of danger. They had have to be because, in the 30s, seatbelts are an absurd concept, helmets are unheard of, and the huge petrol tanks are highly flammable. Every turn could end in a fatal crash and yet the worst peril is yet to come: in 1933 Hitler will decide to make these hotheads the new heroes of the Nazi regime and the Fuhrer will come to learn that a man can tame machines, but not his fellow men.

Set against the backdrop of HitlerΓÇÖs insidious rise to power in pre-war Germany, Grand Prix tells the true story of the Silver Arrows of Mercedes Benz and Auto Union; the dominant racing teams of the 30s.
