,ps3junkie,2013-01-26T15:59Z,prolly cuz its mkv..... peeps tend to do that and i dont know why.... go 1/2 a season with mp4 and then switch to mkv... mkv's really can only be played on the pc... i normaly just youtube it if they put out an mkv.... i wish everyone would just use mp4. but i say this cuz i use my ps3 and xbox to watch them on...  
,geoweo,2013-01-26T18:44Z,"Um, I watch MKVs streaming through my Xbox all the time. I just go into Windows Media Center and voila...problem solved."

Love this show."
,mseather,2013-01-26T19:10Z,i have a share ratio of 65.. and still climbing.. i feel like are doing hit and runs. bah
,livens01,2013-01-26T20:54Z,"Thankd for the 720 :)

Samsung's AllShare wouldnt stream this one to my TV either. Ive ran 100's of MKV's through it no problem. MKV isnt the problem, its whatever codec was used. But VLC played it perfectly on my PC so no complaints here."
[V],psspss,2013-01-26T22:59Z,try installing Serviio free media server on your pcs and using panasonic veira profile it will transocde it from pc to your tvs fine.. even over wifi and a slow laptop as server like 1.6gjz celeron the new build solves a few issues and gettign better with each new build
,livens01,2013-01-27T19:54Z,"Thanks psspss, I wasn't aware that I could use anything other than Samsung's AllShare program. AllShare is a piece of crap that hasn't been updated since early last year, ill be glad to be rid of it."
[V],psspss,2013-02-02T03:51Z,"allshare you still use. but instead directly via usb key (as samsung is fussy on some formats believe me its better then sony! we have 32inch samsung and plays everything I do anyhow of keydisc and
plays everything else over media servers as long as transcode it)

try serviio and set it to profile panasonic viera it should then transcode everything to the tv

which means it makes the mkv xvids etc in to mpeg before sending it to the tv..

you will need a wireless dongel on tv or wired connection though to see the network servers

it beats using usb key infact.. any old laptop should do fine.. as long at its no less then 1.6ghz

iseal is dual core or higher"
