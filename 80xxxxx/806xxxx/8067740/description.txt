Changes from recent Windows 8 x64 releases:
-Added IE security, but moved to offline install.
Reboot is not needed during setupcomplete.cmd phase.
-Added .NET 2-3.5.1
Offline hotfixes used for netfx3
-Unmodified ei.cfg for extra stability long-term
-Obviously the KMS Pre-Activation stuff

I have refined the trigger for the re-activation since
my PRO VL Perm Re-activation release. This release uses
KMSNano v16 with TriggerKMS v9. If you need to update
KMSNano for any reason, make sure that the scheduled
task "Trigger KMS Activation" also gets updated.

Windows 8 Enterprise is version of Windows with the most
features. It has every app that other Windows 8 versions
have and more. For the exact differences, read a wiki.
