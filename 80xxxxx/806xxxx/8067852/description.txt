If you enjoyed 
FlyTampaΓÇÖs wonderful 
Seattle airport scenery 
on FS9, you can now 
have that experience 
back along with OrbxΓÇÖs 
awesome Pacific 
Northwest region. Both 
are required to use this 
scenery merge. 
This scenery requires some work 
before it can be used. You will 
have to copy and place bgls and 
textures while also turning off 
several Orbx files. Although not 
exhaustive, this is  something 
you should be aware of

This merge (HD version) is designed for users looking to increase 
their immersion at the field. By using our custom photoscenery 
ground, you will see an improvement in scenery while using our 
enchanced photoscenery ground textures. If you wish to switch 
to  the standard version, simply download the installer and follow 
the included instructions.
