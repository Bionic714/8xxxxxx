This is the FULL BROADCAST of Triple j's Hottest 100 of 2012.

This is ripped from the Triple j's website and has been left in exactly the same format as I downloaded it which is 128 kbit/s mp3 in 4 parts.

 I downloaded it from this page http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/hottest100/12/

This is for anyone else who lives overseas and was asleep through most of it due to the time difference.  Also I have done this so anyone else who is interested in listening to to all the interviews and shenanigans is able to even if they can't stream the broadcast.  I can't stream this while driving but I can use my mp3 player.
