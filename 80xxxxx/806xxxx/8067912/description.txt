If you find this you probably are frustrated as all hell with the fact that the stupid company in charge of developing software to allow one to edit the patterns on the M-Audio Venom decided it was done when M-Audio sold out to inMusic.  

Someone created a patch for Max for Ableton Live to fill in the gap of this functionality. They are also charging $5 for it, which is fine, but really... you just spent how much on this synth...
