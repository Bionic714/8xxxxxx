I have downloaded this file, dubble clicked it, so it would be 'registred' (sorry I am Dutch), and when I start up the game again, it is still Russian? Do I have to put it in a special folder? Do I have to change something when I have downloaded this file?"

Double click the file, when asked if you wish to merge it with the registry choose yes(You probably need administrator access)

BTW the set that this is for(Sims 3 Gold 16 in 1) is messed up in more ways than 1. A lot of the files are somewhat corrupted. It works but it is SLOW."

Right clicking on the reg file and choosing merge from the drop down works."
