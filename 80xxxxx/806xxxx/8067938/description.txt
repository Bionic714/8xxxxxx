Brief Synopsis:
Like many fanedits before it, my version aims to cut bad acting, bad dialog and streamline the film. IΓÇÖve also attempted bring the prequels in alignment with the original trilogy by cutting anything that broke continuity. I really want viewers to be able to watch Episodes 1-6, in order, without having key moments in the later films spoiled. Anakin no longer is C3POΓÇÖs creator. In fact, C3PO and R2D2 are no longer major (minor?) characters in the PT. They are now just like any other droid. They do have minor dialog here or there, but they are never referenced by name nor are their roles significant.

Intention:
Like many fanedits before it, my version aims to cut bad acting, bad dialog and streamline the film. IΓÇÖve also attempted bring the prequels in alinement with the original trilogy by cutting anything that broke continuity. I really want viewers to be able to watch Episodes 1 ΓÇô 6, in order, without having key moments in the later films spoiled. Anakin no longer is C3POΓÇÖs creator. In fact, C3PO and R2D2 are no longer major (minor?) characters in the PT. They are now just like any other droid. They do have minor dialog here or there, but they are never referenced by name nor are their roles significant.

Cuts and Additions:
This list is in no way complete as there are a lot of minor tweaks IΓÇÖm not referencing, but it should give you a good sense of changes. IΓÇÖve bold the changes I think are original (though IΓÇÖm no expert and havenΓÇÖt seen many of the SW fanedits out there) so if IΓÇÖm wrong please correct me.

(v.2)
- removed four scenes with the Emperor
- reversed final shot of the film
