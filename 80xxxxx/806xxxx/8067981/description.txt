Brief Synopsis:
Completing the Fall of the Jedi trilogy, Episode 3 continues with the deletion of R2D2 and C-3PO, and removing bad dialog and acting. Even more extreme, the final battle between Yoda and Palpatine has been removed as well as Padme giving birth (and dying).

Intention:
Bring the prequel trilogy inline with the original trilogy, allowing for viewers to watch Ep. 1 - 6 in order without key revelations in the OT spoiled early because of the PT.
