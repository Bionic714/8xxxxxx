Brief Synopsis:
A hybrid cut of Return of the Jedi using the Blu-Ray release and Harmy's Despecialized Edition (in AVCHD).

Intention:
Last year I released a version of Return of the Jedi that was a hybrid of the Special Edition released on 2004 and Harmy's Despecialized Edition. While I did release an AVCHD 720p version all the footage was upconverted from SD.

With the Blu-Ray release and even more tinkering by Lucas I decided to revisit this edit and do a proper HD version. Utilizing the Blu-Ray release as the main source, and Harmy's 720p version of the Despecialized Edition, I am happy to announce the release of Return of the Jedi: Q2 Edition - Remastered.

Cuts and Additions:
I've left the special edition mostly intact, and have only changed the most grievous of alterations to the Blu-Ray release. Anything that is restored from the theatrical cut comes from an upconverted 720p version (which may in-turn been upconverted from SD though, I'm not sure). Because of this, the theatrical footage doesn't look quite as crisp as the BR source.

- restored original Jabba's palace door
- replaced "Jedi Rock" with the original dance number from the theatrical cut
- removed subtitle "I want fifty thousand. No less." C-3PO translates this immediately after, so it felt redundant.
- cut burps from giant toad and Sarlacc pit
- restored all shots of the theatrical beakless Sarlacc pit
- restored Solo's original line "Trust me!" at the Sarlacc pit
- removed Vaders "No. Noooooo!"
- while I left the new galaxy-wide celebration intact, I did cut "We'sa free!" and restored the older Anakin
