,namco-nexgen,2013-01-29T11:41Z,"I forgot to explain how to use this, but it's pretty simple.

Since this is a base scenery, it should be put in Addon Scenery or added as a separate folder at the level above Addon Scenery in the library."
,Capt.Jambo,2013-01-30T05:21Z,"Thanx namco-nexgen. I mainly fly portuguese airspace, this is great. 

Who is the developer of this scenery so I can search it out on the web for some more detailed info.

PLUR"
,namco-nexgen,2013-01-31T20:15Z,Anonymous that's why he let someone else upload it. He's working in the airport details and might also release a coast update with even better blending.
