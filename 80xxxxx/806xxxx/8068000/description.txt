This is a photoreal Portuguese scenery. Covers the whole country and was captured in medium resolution to keep size small and enabling flights with high quality scenery as low as 4000-5000ft. Due to the available sources of terrain imagery, there are some colour differences throughout the country. The north has better quality overall and reflects the Portuguese landscape more faithfully.

Airport addons with higher detail will follow for Lisboa, Cascais and Sintra (LPPT/LPCS/LPST), Porto (LPPR) and Faro (LPFR).

When available, these addons must be above the base pack now released in the library.
