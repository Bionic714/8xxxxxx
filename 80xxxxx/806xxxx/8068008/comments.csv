,paltkoma,2013-01-26T17:37Z,Maybe because higher compression ratios for audio/video takes considerable time to process?
,Nemo89,2013-01-26T19:05Z,Or maybe it's because the higher the resolution (720) the bigger the file... just compare it with EZTV's files.
,eightyth_attempt2register,2013-01-27T05:29Z,"Jackson, when it says PublicHD, or the uploader is DibyaTPB or sceneline, that means the episode is in high resolution.  It's bigger because it's high quality and I prefer it.  eztv and ettv occassionally upload high resolution, but mostly stick with low resolution."
,alveolate,2013-01-27T21:40Z,"why is it that the first post is always some dumb whiner who can't be bothered to try answering their own question instead of appearing like a complete fool?

they could at least sound less offended / self-righteous in asking their noob questions. like srsly."
