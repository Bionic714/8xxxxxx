,cujimmmy,2013-01-27T05:05Z,Which Hansel And Gretel is this YOU LOSERS !!!!!!
,cracksmoker,2013-01-27T05:31Z,"There are 3 Hansel and Gretel movies this year. FOUR if you include the Hansel & Gretel Get Baked.
You give absolutely no indication which this is... No IMDB link... FAIL

For those who dont want to waste a bunch of time figuring it out this is most likely this lame
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2415464/
 and shitty straight to Blu-ray and not the new one in theaters.  Which is probably what most people are looking for and TVTeam seems to be taking advantage of that...  Whatever"
,kyinlvnv,2013-01-27T21:56Z,"Yeah, TvTeam is horrible, they never post any info about the movie and never an IMDB link, just a link to their lame site that you have to sign up for to visit
FAIL"
,xtraB,2013-01-29T05:06Z,"Is NOT Hansel and Gretel - Witch Hunters  2013,,, 
================================

,wyattspoppa,2013-02-01T19:52Z,"TV Team is among the top 5 around, don't listen to these whiny clowns. So they don't post a grip of info about each upload, have you seen the number of items they have posted? If you don't like their work, let's hear about what you've done for us? Otherwise, go find what you want yourself."
,cracksmoker,2013-02-05T00:07Z,"Nobody is asking for a ton of info and I like their work, but it would be nice to know WHAT we are actually downloading don't you think?

If you are going to do something, do it right."
