,Dogjacky,2013-01-26T23:08Z,dlc doesn't seem to work ?
,Vaiz,2013-01-26T23:43Z,"Yeah, for whatever reason I can't change Dante's costume in the game to any of the DLC costumes. Just the normal one and the white haired one you unlock for beating the game. I put all the stuff where the install notes says to put it, anyone else having this issue?"
,Alarba,2013-01-26T23:46Z,"So far i've tried the skins from the DLC, and they are working."
,ParadoxBlack,2013-01-27T05:43Z,I'm not understanding what to do once I download.

1. Copy the folders ""Binaries and DevilGame"" and Cole, to the installation folder of the game.
2. Accept the replacement when it is shown.
3. Still in the game folder from the folder ""Binaries"" then enter the folder ""Win32""
     Search for ""DMC-DevilMayCry.exe"" Create a Shortcut on Desktop.
4. Have fun!"

""Cole"" is ""Paste"" error in translation"

,khalleb,2013-01-31T14:37Z,"Hey guys.. For some reason, my save games disappeared after applying this crack. 
How can I get them back? I used this on the Reloaded version."
,agentx213,2013-02-01T10:16Z,"@khalleb it might be the name in ""rld.ini"" file."
,Requiem0724,2013-02-01T18:14Z,does this include the bloody palace update? 
,chok6663,2013-02-02T03:49Z,What does this DLC include?
,Proteus11,2013-02-08T15:53Z,Hmm; installing this after I played a while made all my savegames disappear. Bummer.

,c0ldpr0xy,2013-02-20T09:52Z,This does NOT include the Blood Palace update. Bloody Palace DLC is being released today for PC so keep an eye.
,zhandyx,2013-03-08T15:28Z,"works great for me, i able to used the 3 costumes for dante, i usually using the last one since that was cool for me,to some guys that did nt get to work simply
go to binaries folder inside dowloaded file
copy the files inside binary file then replace files
copy DLCdanteoriginal from downloaded file inside folder devil game>published>content
after u copied the folder go to your DMC directory file then devil game folder>published>content
then your good to go.
enjoy.i will also keep seeding as long as i can
thnx to the uploader."
