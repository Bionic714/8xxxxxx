Focusing on the timeless themes of jealousy, murder and betrayal, ‘I Against Iâ™ is set over one night and utilises different time lines to reveal a dark and unexpected conclusion to a simple mystery premise. The main protagonists, opposite in character, take a frantic journey into a desolate nocturnal world with the common aim of survival, though once completed, the plot reveals a trap from which escape may be impossible. Taking influence from films like ‘Le Samuraiâ™, ‘Point Break, and new Asian noir, the film is a modern homage to hard boiled cinema with its own original take.
