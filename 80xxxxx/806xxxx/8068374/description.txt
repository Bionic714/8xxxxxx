Album Review:

 Comprised of 18 tracks culled from the singer/composer's first three decades, The Very Best of Enya was pieced together by the artist herself, along with longtime collaborators Nicky and Roma Ryan. Luckily, the trio seems enamored by most of the same songs that the general public is, resulting in one of those rare "greatest-hits" collections that goes deep without depriving the listener of the essentials. With tunes like "Orinoco Flow", "Caribbean Blue", and "Book of Days" in the pot and out of the way, it's easier to appreciate hidden gems like "Cursum Perficio", "Boadicea", "Trains and Winter Rains", and "Anywhere Is". Also notable is the inclusion of "May It Be" and a previously unreleased version of "An√≠ron (I Desire)", both of which originally appeared on the soundtrack for the first chapter of Peter Jackson's beloved Lord of the Rings trilogy.
