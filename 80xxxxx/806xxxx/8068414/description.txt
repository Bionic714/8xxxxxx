Wiki entry:

   Secret Ballot is a comedy/drama with a light hand on the comedy.  It is one of my favorite films simply because it is unpretentious.  The characters are interesting and they show both male and female characters well.  It has original hard subtitles in English.

   I've made the new torrent because it's availability is inconsistent in this format.
