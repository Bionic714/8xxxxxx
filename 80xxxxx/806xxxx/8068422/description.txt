Brief Synopsis:
Who killed Laura Palmer? The mystery unfolds in this re-edited version of the classic television series Twin Peaks.

Intention:
The idea for this fanedit came about while talking with boon in chat one day. The conversation started innocently enough: what films should remain untouchable to faneditors? I mentioned I had great admiration for David Lynch and I couldnΓÇÖt see anyone touching his work. boon challenged me, asking about Twin Peaks, a show that started off strongly but lost its way in season 2? That gave me pause: I am a huge fan of Twin Peaks and have owned several versions of its release, but season two has always been a sore spot for me. After the Laura Palmer mystery was solved the show became much more a soap opera and became less compelling. That is, of course, until the last two episodes.

After that conversation the idea stuck with me (thanks boon), and so I started plotting how I would do a fanedit of one of AmericaΓÇÖs greatest television shows. Because there was so much material to work with, and so many storylines, I felt it needed to focus just on LauraΓÇÖs murder and all other stories need to be reduced or eliminated.

By doing this many characters are either never introduced or have limited screen time. This may anger some fans, but in creating a ΓÇ£feature filmΓÇ¥ (or extended feature film, I suppose) sacrifices had to be made. But thatΓÇÖs why we still have the original source material to go back; to revisit a town like Twin Peaks uncensored, as originally intended by the creators.

Cuts and Additions:
There is no way to list everything that was cut. Simply, if there was a sub-plot that wasnΓÇÖt needed for the Laura Palmer story it was axed. IΓÇÖm sure for the purist this is blasphemy, but I urge those people to use their imagination and pretend ΓÇ£Twin PeaksΓÇ¥ the series never existed. Virtually all scenes with Catherine Martell, Audrey Horne, Shelly Johnson, and Josie Packard have been removed. The scene where the killer is revealed has been tweaked extending the mystery until the end. Some footage from the final ΓÇ£Twin PeaksΓÇ¥ episode has been incorporated.
