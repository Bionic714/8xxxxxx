,b1893757,2013-01-27T15:56Z,Video studders through out the whole movie :(
,Sleppmegin,2013-04-20T01:39Z,"Utterly crap, video was bearable but the sound was muddy and obviously ""dirty"" when certain powerful sound effects where played. Why only such high compression low file size releases are available here at TPB per this date is beyond me. Though I didn't exactly find the movie itself top notch so maybe thats why ppl haven't bothered. If how ever you want to watch it with some decent standard of quality better look elsewhere."
