Nestled between a few burning to death fields of Iowa corn, a dilapidated old farm house and down a dusty gravel road was a barn and the most unlikely place that you could have ever expected to find Counting Crows on this Independence Day. It was the 2nd Barn on the 4th event that we staged in Maquoketa, Iowa, at the now legendary Codfish Hollow barn and a sold out crowd of 600 people braved 100-plus degree temperatures to witness what has to be the most epic concert that one of AmericaΓÇÖs most lasting and appreciated contemporary rock and roll bands has ever played. It lasted three hours ΓÇô with one 5-minute break before an encore ΓÇô after which Duritz asked a crew member what time it was. Upon hearing that it was just after 1 am on July 5th, he collapsed into the country green on the backside of the barn, gleefully saying, ΓÇ£Three hours,ΓÇ¥ with a big smile on his face.
