Time for a little piece of classic horror. A collaboration between the late Uruguay-born Argentine comics artist Alberto Breccia (1919-1993) and the writer Norberto Buscaglia, most of the stories in this scanlated book are adapted from HP Lovecrafts stories by Buscaglia, except for The Festival which was adapted by Breccia himself. In this you'll find Lovecrafts The Festival, The Thing On The Doorstep, The Shadow Over Innsmouth, The Nameless City, The Dunwich Horror, The Call Of Cthulhu, The Color Out Of Space, The Haunter Of The Dark, and The Whisperer In Darkness.

If you have never read any of Lovecrafts works, this book will make a good start. Never forget that only a few of American horror writers can avoid being influenced by Lovecraft and his Cthulhu mythos.
