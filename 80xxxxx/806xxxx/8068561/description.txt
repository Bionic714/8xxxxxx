Tom Byron plays a wealthy man who markets a lethal drug in the form of pills. Once swallowed, a person dies of a heart attack within fifteen minutes. His wife Zara Whites is a carefree individual who isn't content about the short leash her hubby's got her on, and ultimately plans to get out of the marriage by slipping a pill in his drink one night. While on business, and residing in a hotel, Tom ends up cheating on Zara with Patricia Kennedy (playing some sort of floozy). Later, the hotel's bartender Randy West escorts a drunken woman (Devon Shire) back to her room but they end up in the wrong place (disturbing Tom and Patricia). Once West returns Shire to the right room, Randy fucks her.
