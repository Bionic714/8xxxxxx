"Spike finds himself in over his head after convincing Twilight and her friends to let him pet-sit all of their critters in exchange for a few gems when they go to the Crystal Empire to help Princess Cadance welcome the Head of the Equestria Games. In the beginning of the episode, he decides to bake a cake with all the gems he has saved, and then realizes that he has eaten all of them while preparing the batter."
