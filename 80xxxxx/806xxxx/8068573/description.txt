I am sure that it works on the Sony Ericsson Live With Walkman, (my phone)

processor: 1GHz

also you need an SD card

in the game you can change some basic option, (sound intensity, subtitles...)



The only thing you have to do is:

1┬║- download de APK file, (this download);

2┬║- while the game is downloading, grab your Android Phone or Tablet and download 

an app on Play Store called ASTRO, (its free);

3┬║- after you download the game on the computer and the app (astro) on the 

phone/tablet, plug your Android on the computer, open it, and create a folder and 

name it GAMES, then drag/cut/copy the APK file (game) into that folder;

4┬║- close everything, unplug everything, grab your Android again and click on the 

ASTRO app, and then click on Local Storage or SD card and search for the folder 

named GAMES, when you find it, click on it, and inside it will be the game, click 

on the game and then will appear something saying "install", click it;

5┬║- (because is an offline game, you don't need to download anything more 

manually), so after the game is installed, (you can close ASTRO), go to your menu 

and click on the game icon, and when you open it, it will download automatically 

the DATA;

6┬║- (you need internet connection), it may take some time to download the DATA,  

probably half an hour, (depends on your internet capacity), after the DATA is 

downloaded, the game will start... have fun!



After you download the game you can "move it to SD card"          !ENJOY!
