And what do you know, yet another Alice scanlation :)

When we think about Bordeaux, we think of wine or the Tour de France, but the real local speciality is organized crime...

Its 1960 and the underworld is in disarray. The Godfather, Georges Abadi, is having holy visions thanks to an addiction to a powerful hallucinogen supplied by the lovely Lola Bogota. Now Abadi has chosen to devote what remains of his fortune to the good works of the gospel. Much to the dismay of his trusted lieutenants, he intends to spend two million on a chapel in his honour. Lola will do anything to get her hands on that money. The mobsters will do anything to stop her. Blood will flow in Bordeaux, Daddy-O!
