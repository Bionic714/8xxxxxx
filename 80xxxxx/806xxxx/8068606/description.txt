And yet another Alice scanlation.

Life isnt easy for humans on the segregated planet-city of Primor and for Frank Willis, things aint getting any easier. A hard nosed cop with the police tactical intervention team, Willis will have to come to terms with a 15 year old daughter he barely knows. Shelly is the only survivor of a catastrophe that claimed two million human lives and like Frank, she has secrets... Divided by life, united by blood, torn by a secret.
