,cheetah_cheetah2,2013-01-26T23:06Z,"Thank you, works great."
,potvinsuks,2013-01-27T07:28Z,"Im soo tempted to download this but Im an avid REX user.  Its just that the sudden wind and weather shifts in REX even messing with the settings in wxplus mode is getting tiresome.  I've heard Opus has the same issue but it's far lass noticeable.  What are you guys take on it?  Love REX, but may just have to use it for its textures."
[T],_SnakEye,2013-01-27T07:46Z,"@potvinsuks , I am at the same status as you are, I am tempted using it , as I heard wonderful things about Opus, however I love my REX (shame buying another weather program if the differences are minor) and it does a good job for weather apart from the sudden wind and weather shifts which I am not so sure are present in Opus, I don't know if it is REX related, could be a FSX code issue."
,raafuu,2013-01-27T08:09Z,"Im using REX for texture and ASE for weather engine, so ill try this one cos im very intersted how its work. Thx for upload!"
,potvinsuks,2013-01-27T08:47Z,"Yup Im using REX for both.  Im well aware that ASE is a fantastic prog like REX but it has the same issues regarding the ""sudden changes."" I've done a considerable amount of research on this and from what I gather out of the whole thing is that theres smoother transitions in weather generation during flight with Opus.  Some argue that it can achieve this because its not as real in that aspect....Well let us know what you think?  Also I should say that Im talking about weather during ""high and fast"" flying."
,potvinsuks,2013-01-27T08:55Z,"Exactly Snakeye!  It's absurd for me to think about basically not using half of REX's program just for one little minute thing lol.  I love REX more then just about any add-on along with EZ-Dok, which btw was gonna ask how that all works with the motion in the Opus program lol?  Well, maybe REX will eventually come out with a patch to correct this issue, but like you said this may be a coding problem."
,potvinsuks,2013-01-27T11:46Z,"So I decided I had to try it :)...  Picked an area where there were some scattered clouds through the REX WX, and decided to use SBBR Brasilia (which btw is fantastic freeware through http://www.terra-brasilis.org/)  First I loaded REX WX at SBBR and let it load the textures.  Loaded the sim at the airport with the ultralite and clouds were slightly cloudy w alotta haze.  Shut it all down and fired up Opus and to my amazement - Bang, partly clouds slight haze and RAIN!  Couldnt believe it, aside from the weather correctly depicting actual weather, it actually rained which I totally fergot was part of the sim when using REX lol.  Anyway, wish I had more time to test, but its getting late so ill see how it is going thru FL340 @260kts tomm ;).  Thanks again Snakeye!"
,raafuu,2013-01-27T19:55Z,"potvinsuks now i can say, Opus is better then REX and ASE weather engine. Texture from REX, weather from Opus,for ASE is time to uninstal :) thx _SnakEye"
[T],_SnakEye,2013-01-27T22:53Z,"@potvinsuks, thanks for the Update.
keep us posted on more testing you done, I am really interested to hear/compare the two."
,alcluizPT,2013-01-27T23:17Z,Thank you very much _SnakEye!!!!

,dal123,2013-02-08T11:56Z,"Awesome, you're the best, SnakEye Please see if you can upload the latest version please I really appreciate it, much"
,free4last,2013-02-11T02:28Z,Thanks dude..
,tetuke00,2013-02-11T10:11Z,"I tried with FSX and didnt like it: ""light snow condition"" looked on the windshield like ""star wars hyperjump lines"".
First I thought, it has sg. to do with my VCRain*.* files in the Texture directory, but when I switched to AS2012, the snow effect looked just normal as it should be. So I guess, I will stick with AS2012 for the time being."
,potvinsuks,2013-03-17T17:41Z,"Well after using Opus with Rex for a month It pains me to say to ""Believe The Hype!""  Opus has made flying in real time weather a blast!  Never used ASE, but to use REX textures and Opus weather WX is amazing.  It's light years better then REX WX, faster, smoother, more fluid and above all much more realistic.  Having EZ-Dok, I was reluctant in using the LC, but now that I've started to experiment with that and am amazed with it as well, and am planning on uinstalling EZ-Dok.  I used to think that it sux to be only using REX for half of its strength if I went with the Opus Weather but I was wrong as REX can be much more involved.  Now, before I plan a flight I still use REX to view the weather conditions and load up their texture set respective to weather conditions first then proceed to Opus. Also,  I noticed that Track-IR works far better with Opus LC then EZ-Dok.....Snakeye funds are kinda low these days and I believe Opus has come out with a newer beta :-)....perhaps you could work you magic on it bud?  I know your busy, if you can great if not,  no worries.  Thanks for everything!"
[T],_SnakEye,2013-03-17T18:49Z,"yes I agree, I did a huge research with all three REXE (purchased) , Opus and AS2012.
AS was the worst of them all as I hated how they inject cirrus clouds at very low altitude.
couldn't find away of removing this behavior.
also AS2012 was very big hit on my FPS, no idea why.
REX was the second place IMO, the only issue I have with REX WX is incorrect weather for the location.
Opus was the combination of the two (AS/REX).
Very accurate weather and no crappy Cirrus clouds at low altitude.
real clouds for the location and also mist and fog was more realistic then both REX and AS2012.
I ran the test run for 2 weeks testing all three at many locations and the winner is Opus with REX not so far behind if it wasn't for the weather inaccuracy. AS2012 is burnt out as to very unrealistic clouds depiction.  
next month I am going to buy Opus. (new monthly budget)"
,Mr.Vince,2013-04-04T20:56Z,Req. OpusFSX v2.90!
,clintferns,2013-04-14T15:38Z,Req the latest update please...Thanks
,bigpirate(r),2013-05-16T19:20Z,"hey snakeye.
I installed Opus correctly, last night after i downloaded it, it worked 100% and loved it. This morning it opens up and the spy thing pics up commands but it does nothing in the sim, after digging around tonight i found a .txt file that reads ""error"". When i open it, it only says ""Unable to locate license file"". When i delete it, it just pops back when i start Opus. Please help?"
