This book is an ideal introduction to the principles of flight. The book is an excellent text for student pilots, students of aeronautical and aerospace engineering, aircraft engineering apprentices and anyone who is interested in aircraft.

 The book commences with a summary of the relevant aspects of mechanics, and goes on to cover topics such as air and airflow, aerofoils, thrust, level flight, gliding, landing, performance, manoeuvres and stability and control. 
 Important aspects of these topics are illustrated by a description of a trial flight in a light aircraft. The book also deals with flight at transonic and supersonic speeds, and finally orbital flight and spacecraft.
