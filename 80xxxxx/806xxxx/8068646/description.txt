A few important and simple keyboard shortcuts for VLC are:

Double click: Fullscreen
Spacebar: Play/Pause
V key: Enable/Disable/Change Language of Subtitles.
G/H key: Subtitle Delay (-50ms/+50ms each tap)
J/K key: Audio Delay (-50ms/+50ms each tap)

NOTE: English subtitles are on by default; simply tap the V key in VLC Media Player to disable them or delete the Subtitles folder.

NOTE: If you prefer .srt subtitles, you can download them here:(Scroll down, and the download link is on the right)

NOTE: Three samples are included as well as the NFO files.

NOTE: I do not have constant Internet access, so this upload may take a couple days.  Please be patient!

NOTE: I am in the process of uploading all the recent BDRips/DVDRips of popular TV shows that are not on TPB.  Considering I do not have fast upload speeds, nor do I have constant Internet access, AND there are pretty much unlimited DVDRips/BDRips to upload, this will take a super long time.  However, let me know if you have a request, and I will see what I can do.

Enjoy; please rate, comment, and seed!
