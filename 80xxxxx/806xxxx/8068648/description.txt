I recently acquired one of these machine and decided that I didn't want to use HP's recovery partition to re-install the OS, instead, I extracted the contents of the driver (DRV) folder to a USB stick and used them in conjunction with one of the XP SP3 releases from TPB. All appears to be working fine!

These are straight from the recovery partition and have in no way been modified by myself.
