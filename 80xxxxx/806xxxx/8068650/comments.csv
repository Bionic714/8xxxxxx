,jersson,2013-01-26T19:33Z,Looks very interesting. I have  vers 15.0.951 and I will try it on W/7 -64 bit. Thank's
,onixbg,2013-02-02T09:39Z,Some one say if this is legit trial reset or it reset only once like the 3 versions made before. There was working trial reset for older versions 1000-1010 but they patched that after 1010.
,Shah_Jahan,2013-02-09T08:27Z,"@onixbg: I too had the same concern. Since this has been uploaded on 2013-01-26, 45 days have NOT yet passed. It did work (even though I had used a previous trial resetter which worked only once)

I'm NOT sure if it will work again. but try it for atleast yet another 45 days! Hopefully more."

See if it allows you to do a manual defrag. So far the ones that I've tried when you do a manual defrag it says it's starting but it just sits there."
