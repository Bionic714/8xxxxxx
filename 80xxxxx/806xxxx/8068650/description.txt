Diskeeper 2012 Pro performance software includes powerful fragmentation prevention technology that can enormously boost workstations with heavy performance demands to levels of speed and efficiency far beyond previous limits.
 For pre-existing fragmentation and for the small percentage of fragmentation that is not prevented, Pro Premier takes on large hard drives and volume sizes effortlessly with powerful defrag engines designed specifically for big defrag jobs. Diskeeper 2012 Pro Premier will extend the life and increase the efficiency of your systems while greatly increasing workplace productivity.
 
* New! IntelliWrite fragmentation prevention technology. IntelliWrite prevents up to 85% of the fragmentation every system suffers from. It intelligently writes contiguous files to the disk so system resources are not wasted creating fragmentation. The results? A whole new level of system speed and efficiency.
 
* InvisiTasking technology ΓÇöAvailable in Diskeeper 2010 performance software, InvisiTasking provides up-to-the-moment defragmentation without tapping into active system resources. The result: completely invisible yet robust automatic defragmentation that acts in real time to keep your computer running at maximum performance.
 * Real-time defragmentation Handle fragmentation as it occurs, providing maximum speed and performance at all times!
 * Uncompromising file and free space defragmentation Defragment in the most extreme hard drive environments. Diskeeper 2012 eliminates fragmentation even on disks with as little as 1% free space or files split in millions of fragments.
 * "Defragmentation Intelligence" enhancements Diskeeper monitors and analyzes each drive, then chooses a defragmentation strategy specific to the needs of that drive. Every drive is defragmented using the best method possible.
 * I-FAAST 2.0 (Intelligent File Access Acceleration Sequencing Technology) automatically boosts access speeds for the most commonly used files.
 * Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) Compatibility mode Diskeeper works intimately with the automatic backup system already on your PC. VSS compatibility mode means, Diskeeper does not damage your ability to recover lost files and does not take up valuable free space with unnecessary file information.
 * Native 64 bit operating systems support.
 * Boot-Time Mode safely performs Microsoft recommended defragmentation of critical system files.
 * Network Management Support control Diskeeper settings and functionality via Diskeeper Administrator edition or Group Policy.
 
Diskeeper 2012 performance software is essential software for every Windows system. Without it, maximum system speed and efficiency would be unattainable and fragmentation related slows, crashes and freezes would be unavoidable.
