A lurking terror has infected the town of Malborg. Madness and death haunt the luminous Scandinavian nights, and the victims all seem to have one thing in common: their lust for the voluptous Marlene. As he investigates, ace detective Michael Joergendsen must navigate a dangerous course between his official duties and his own growing fixation with the young woman. Is he on the trail of a supernatural killer, or is it the other way around? And the beautiful Marlene - is she the innocent victim of an obsessive stalker, or is she something more sinister?

Marlene is an erotic horror story, and that means not for you, junior! Go surf the Disney sites.
