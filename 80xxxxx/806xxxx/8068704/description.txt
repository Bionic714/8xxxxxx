I was looking for Dragonlance novels, but I realised that there's no complete collection available, so I searched, and here's what I found.
There are approximately 130 novels in it.

It contains some dupes (some books in different formats, where I copuldn't decide, which one looks better). Formats include PDF, TXT, DOC and RTF.
The novels are sorted in a (nearly) chronological structure Pre-Cataclysm, Alt-Cataclysm, 2nd Cataclysm, Anthologies and Misc.

I don't list the titles here (blame my laziness), but if you have time, please do it in a comment. Also, if you know where to find any of the books I didn't include, please let me know. I'll seed to at least a 10 ratio, probably longer. Follow me! Sharing is caring.
