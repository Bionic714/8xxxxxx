,FROSTB1TTENN,2013-01-26T20:56Z,How exactly do I do that? I'm currently seeding with unlimited upload limit.
,ofpirate,2013-01-26T23:18Z,"depends on the torrent client.. if you hold-back the last couple pieces until you have a couple dozen peers 99.8 done, the torrent will have a much better chance to live on its own.. or, seed it indefinitely

at any rate, thx!!"
