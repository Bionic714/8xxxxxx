,beaujoulais,2013-01-27T00:15Z,"Dear Zlatko, I failed answering to great part 450 including the Lenka  videos, based on my request. It's real amazing - 1000 thanks to you my friend! Part 450 gave me new information and aspects of a great pop lady. Lenka comes real close to Björk but stays on her own feet. No copy of Björk - just inspiration. Are you in load of a Björk part - full of nordic underground (?)music? Would be real great.. Tom Beaujoulais"
