,SR2009,2013-01-26T22:14Z,"HORRIBLE COPY 

V-3
A-2"
,EnemyDrone,2013-01-27T00:59Z,Very VERY bad...Are you all this desperate for a fucking FREE movie.....shame....
,cgalloza,2013-01-27T06:12Z,"@Anuradha2
instead of fuckin spammin about a better copy on some other site, why not upload said copy you fuckin assclown!"
,itcooleagles,2013-01-27T06:34Z,"Aye, V - 3 A - 2. 

It's great to finally see a cam of this up, means we're getting closer to the real deal. But I'd recommend waiting a bit longer if you want to enjoy this one. Still, excellent torrent. I'm watching it just to see if the movie is shit (20 minutes in and the characters are shallow as fuck...) No use getting butthurt about the quality being horrible. It's a cam a week after the release of the film. This is what everyone should expect. Jesus. "
,gojira87,2013-01-27T07:00Z,"I mean its a cam and its free, its also more than watchable. For a Cam Id give it V7 and A7..."
,freejax,2013-01-27T08:45Z,"a-5 v-6, You can tweak your player picture settings to make it pretty watchable. Audio is often distorted throughout the movie. Great CAM for the first one out though! Overall watchable"
,al4betcitty,2013-01-27T14:27Z,"what I try to understand is why would you call yourself a ""Pirate"" then get on TPB and broadcast a site to watch an edition of this movie elsewhere. Some r sicker than others. It is what it is and this is the site we do it on. Thank you guys for taking out the time to deliver the GOODS!

,celmario,2013-01-27T18:24Z,why are all these pieces of shit keep spamming their pay to watch scam links for a better copy of this movie?? These morons need to have a knock at their door
,HALL2013,2013-01-27T19:06Z,I watched this on my 52 inch last night and it showed fine. If you're complaining about this and it's the first copy up then you have issues. I turned the brightness up on my TV and my girl & I watched it without issues. 
,char5355,2013-01-28T04:06Z,"I truly don't understand the point to uploading a movie that is not done well. Each time we download a movie that you can't watch, it takes some life from my computer. It's one less good copy I can watch ^_^"
,amonti,2013-01-28T16:35Z,"Well, first - the quality for a CAM is very watchable all the way through, its FREE. But I do have a question, I usually never have a problem using DVD Flick to format and burn to a DVD but with this one even though it says it fits when formatting, when it goes to burn it says there is not enough space on disk, Ive tried several times- also attempting to split movie now and convert back to AVI to put on two DVD's but my thoughts are that all that isn't necessary. Any suggestions please????"
,amonti,2013-01-28T16:38Z,"The quality is fine for a Cam, and for being free, very watchable. Im posting this again because it didnt show up so sorry if it comes up twice eventually but I tried to burn a copy of this to DVD, same as I always do using DVD Flick, the movie says it fits fine when formatting then when it goes to burn it says not enough space on disk, its a blank disk, everything is the same as usual, I am trying to split movie now try 2 DVDs but that cant be necessary, any sugggestions?? Please."
,hudirolf,2013-01-28T20:44Z,"VERY WATCHABLE and the only one out herethat can say the same. THANK YOU, froggie100 for a damn good effort. 
As for some of you offering links for better copies, this is NOT the place to do this. Show some respect and be thankful or PUT UP something better. "
,.Hermit.,2013-01-29T05:54Z,Thanks for the upload but ill wait for a better one to show up
,grimm2,2013-01-30T02:07Z,Aitn nothing dewsperate about watching a bad copy of a movie that you really want to see so shut the hell up dumb ass!!! You one of them niggaz that just like to hear you own dumb ass self talk.. Ha
,pisswhistle,2013-01-31T04:10Z,"Is it just me or are spamlinkers getting worse here?

IMO Movie is low quality for a cam, not a great one.  it is watchable tho, you won't miss anything.  I'm new at rating but I'll say

A 3
V 5

It is not a very good movie, however.

,OSX-User,2013-01-31T08:03Z,"@ char5355
computers are inanimate objects. they do not breathe, or bleed, they have no life whatsoever. just leave an a/v quality and move on already.
you could also consider not downloading to begin with, or getting a new computer with all the money you save by watching pirated movies on the internet instead of seeing them on the big screen or renting them on netflix. RETARD."
,pig_bag,2013-02-04T02:26Z,"I'm normally pretty accepting of poor quality cam copies but this one is a joke. Don't waste your time or bandwidth. The audio and video are okay, but the noise in the theater in fucking unbearable. The uploader or someone nearby spends a huge portion of the movie eating loudly into the microphone and there are one or more kids crying and moaning through the movie too. Look for a better copy, this one's not worth the hassle."
