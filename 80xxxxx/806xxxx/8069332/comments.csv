,ChBukow,2013-01-27T10:55Z,"Hi slicknick, thanks for this. However, you've somehow put LaValle's first run in twice. Any chance of getting a repack?"
,ChBukow,2013-01-27T10:57Z,"Well, actually everything from there on out is just a repeat of riders in the first run, so we're missing the second run completely."
