p.s.  Thank you for everything once again."
,drew1972,2013-01-27T19:14Z,"OK, so I noticed the filename is 10.12.2011.  I looked at the 2010-11 season schedule, and Phoenix and Minnesota played that day.  Coincidence?  I think not.  This torrent is not from this year.  Funny."
[V],Nepotu,2013-01-27T23:09Z,"Sorry guys! My mistake. The game is from 2011. I'll try to up the right game Wild v Red Wings.

I'm really sorry!"
