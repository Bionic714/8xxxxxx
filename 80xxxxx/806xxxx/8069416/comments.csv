,Shoobox,2013-01-29T17:10Z,I appreciate any gog upload but have to ask why is this bigger 9.gb vs the reloaded 7gb? is it because of the ost and video files?
,mwalsher,2013-02-04T20:49Z,"@Shoobox, sort of, but not quite. Just check the file list: http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8069416/Alan_Wake_GOG#filelistContainer"

I'm not sure what your saying by checking the file list, gog drm free version is 7.9gb where as this claim is 9.1gb.

the file list for the torrent doesn't add up to the one from gog

@Shoobox, that’s my point. You asked if the excess size is due to the extras, but the file list clearly shows that not to be the case. The vast majority of the excess comes from the game itself.

Why it’s larger than SKIDROW’s (I assume you are talking about SKIDROW since RELOADED has only released a crack, not the whole game) is beyond me since I can’t check because I don’t currently have the space or bandwidth to download them."
