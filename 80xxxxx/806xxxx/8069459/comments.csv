,akshu0992,2013-01-28T01:53Z,@Halloweenpsycho How to activate it????????????? and does this include any default games??????????????/
,Halloweenpsycho,2013-01-28T04:10Z,"Just incase if your key doesn't want to remove its self.. if you have a key installed currently, and need to change it..Go to desktop and bottom left were start orb normally is when u see start pop up right click, and slsect Command prompt Admin. Copy this command slmgr.vbs -ipk 00000-00000-00000-00000-00000
Ofcourse put the correct key in place of the 00000's and hit enter..should say key installed successfully :) 


it seems the extra add on for windows media center serial has gone bust. So for all those..the initial activation works great..As for the add ons. That is simple. Go to http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/feature-packs
There you can have a free upgrade key emailed to your created email of choice..teehee.. You may need to activate your free upgrade key by phone as something is up with internet activation of this free upgrade key..so to do 
this go to the bottom left where your start orb would normally be, when u see start pop up 
right click it, from the menu select command prompt Admin, and copy this command and paste it into Command Prompt.
SLUI 4
Then press enter, after this a screen will pop up for you allowing you to select your country, simply call the number from your country selection give them the long 9 column numbers and presto you will receive the info to activate your permanent Windows Pro 8 with Wmc :) 
Then I would suggest downloading Advanced token manager and make a back up of your installation, so you wont have to go through the hassle again :) Anyway..As always..Enjoy :)"

,Halloweenpsycho,2013-01-28T08:02Z,"I have confirmed the key i provided to still be good it has just been massively used and all online activation has been disabled for the key but the good news is you can still activate by phone.
Once you install and get ready to activate like normal, Go to bottom right and once start pops up right click and select Command Prompt Admin
Simply Copy this Command and paste it into your command prompt SLUI 4
This will give a window to slect your country and correct phone number for your country..then just follow instructions when u call..After you have completed online activation be sure to download Windows Token Manager 3.5 r3 and be sure you back up this installation, and save the created folder some were you will not lose it. I suggest creating two new folders one saying windows activation backup
and the other WIndows ""Wmc"" Backup
After you have backed up your initial installation follow instructions below to get wmc for your install

As for the add ons. That is simple. Go to http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/feature-packs

,Halloweenpsycho,2013-01-29T06:00Z,"OK to make the copy bootable. I have already made the iso bootable, all you will need to do is to burn the iso image.
1: Download Power iso, you can get full version here    https://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8071057/Power_Iso_5.5___Serials_
2: install use key activate..
3: Open power iso go to top right and select burn
4:Say for instance you put the iso on your desktop, were it says image file in power iso, the little drop down button menu straight across you press button select desktop and select the Iso.
5: Put a Blank disc in your dvd burner, make sure yo have the coreect drive with the blank disc selected.
6: Press the burn button and wait until process is done, and Dvd opens the tray.
7. Now all you need to do is restart pc, you willl need to press F2, Delete, basiclly what ever button it says to enter setup, press it.
8. Select boot options, and be sure to select your Dvd drive with the disc you just burnt as you first boot priority, and your hard drive as second.
9: Press F10 to save configuration, Note: if the F10 does nothing make sure your keyboard doesn't have a button called F-lock if so press it and retry F10 should work now.
10: After the save simply reboot, you will see a screen that says press any button to boot from Dvd, just press enter is fine, it will then load windows 8 install and your on ur way.


Hope this helps

,imkid,2013-02-01T06:48Z,"Guys just to let you all know... THIS STILL DOES WORK!

I did have problems also... but the reason is because the serial I entered to START the installation didnt work so I used some other key... 

If this is what you did too... Then you need to change the product key to once again use the keys that came with download... 

1. To change the product key...

A. Go to Search (by hovering mouse in right corner of screen)
B. search for ""command prompt""
C. type in... ""slui 3"" 
D. you will get pop up window that asks for NEW product key... enter the key that comes with download!
E. It will say ""key has been blocked""... THATS OK! Its only been blocked for online activation!
F. Go back to command prompt and now type... ""slui 4""
G. You will get pop up window, choose your country and call that phone and follow instructions!

I just did this a few minutes ago and worked like a charm!!!! 

Hope this helps... Thanks HalloweenPsycho Awesome up and great support!"

A:#1= Yes you can change the picture it was just put there as default to give a change to the default user pic, as i found it boring and that suited my name :)
A:#2= Yes anything of mine you want to delete, be my guest it will not alter Windows 8 in anyway as Windows was not altered, the only alteration that was made
was to the 64 bit verison of my upload which was the choice to bypass the initial serial to simply install windows, for 32 users i simply forgot to take

,Halloweenpsycho,2013-02-03T11:29Z,"I have noticed on my torrents that people are leaving comments about kms activation. Not that i mind,  i welcome all comments :) but something people should be aware of.
the way a kms works is
KMS Activation Renewal

KMS activations are valid for 180 days—the activation validity interval. To remain activated, KMS client computers must renew their activation by connecting to the KMS host at least once every 180 days. By default, KMS client computers attempt to renew their activation every seven days. If KMS activation fails , the client will retry every two hours. After a client computer’s activation is renewed, the activation validity interval begins again.

I could go into extreme detail of the ups and downs with the kms activation system, but i figure no real reason too..One thing i will say is that with the kms just be aware that you only receive 1 rearm and in most cases none at all, with the method i provided you have 1,000 rearms. Truth is genuine is the best ofcourse. But everyone likes to do it there own way. Now the kms operation could be manipulated to represent a infinit amount of elapse time, but rewriting a kms server can be very strenuous and touchy. But all in all to each there own. :) Just a small heads up on what a kms activation does."

As for the cell, i mean with any phone lan or cell there is a trace that  a call was made..but that doesn't mean anything wrong occurred..wink wink..that's why skype is the suggested method for phone activation :) But honestly..Don't sweat it..As bill gates said his self..If they are pirating software i would prefer it to be ours..you go bill :)"

Is this updateable by windows update?Also Windows files aren't modified or something like that ah?"
,Halloweenpsycho,2013-02-06T13:56Z,"@LTNapst3r
Calm down buddy, i am working on many projects and i am running around from place to place..
Yes windows updates are fine, you can update. Also i have tried for a rest on the serial for regular internet activation so for those installing this give the internet activation  a try before phone.
And no the only modification that was made was the initial install background, Depicting my name in the install background, and also to the user account pic. You can change pic with no problem. Other than that there has been no mods to this Windows 8 pro retail. Enjoy"
,Halloweenpsycho,2013-02-06T14:11Z,"PLEASE NOTE: i have tried for a rest on the serial for regular internet activation so for those installing this give the internet activation  a try first before using phone. Let me know if it is working for internet activation, as i have documented it as working via internet 2/6/2013. But if for some reason it does not go through via internet regular activation just revert back to phone activation and all will be fine..Genuine ofcourse..all updates are fine..so you can update with no worries.:) 
PLEASE NOTE: How ever i did originally provide a extra feature serial for wmc. This is no longer working. you can try activating it by phone with the serial, but no guarantees on the wmc activation. If it does work, it will be by phone activation only.. 
Please also know that i am working on many things atm and if i don't respond to a question quickly, it is because i am very busy on several tasks, be assured i will how ever reply A.S.A.P :) Thanks you all..
PLEASE NOTE: once you have activated your Windows 8 don't forget to Back up your activation for future installs, just incase you may need to do a fresh installation. It will save you a lot of heart ache in the long run, as it is a very very simple process to back up and to restore your activation. Thanks to Josh Cell Software. You can provided download for the program here
http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8084095/Advanced_Tokens_Manager
I suggest making a new folder some were to place your back up in and besure to name it windows 8 back up, and save it to a flash drive or portable hdd..Good luck all..take care:)"
,saidiiu89,2013-02-06T16:18Z,"fixed my issue
the issue was with the serial I was using
I was supposed to use this serial: XKY4K-2NRWR-8F6P2-448RF-CRYQH to install win8 (as u mentioned in your readme file) but instead I was using this: PKQ6T-N8GMC-VXYX4-HWMTH-8HRDP
and thanks.. everything working great here :D"

WHEN I CLICKED ""I ALREADY HAV THE KEY""
IT IS ASKING FOR THE KEY...
WAT SHLD I ENTER???
is it the same activation key which I enteredfor w8 activation??
PKQ6T-N8GMC-VXYX4-HWMTH-8HRDP "
,Halloweenpsycho,2013-02-07T11:39Z,"@myalwyn 
No here is the issue..Microsoft was offering a free wmc upgrade until jan 31st..That promo is over now..SO you would have to purchase the upgrade..But you can either. Try and use the extra features serial i provided with upload, and do it via phone activation..Or..You can find a windows wmc patch. What will happen if you try to just simply enter serial for wmc with out phone will be you will receive a error..and if you get the wmc to go through it will de activate windows until a valid wmc serial is used..Thats were the serial for extra features i provided comes in..you can try by phone to activate the same way you would with normal activation, and it might go through via phone..See the issue is the wmc serial was a one time use. Now if you really  need windows media center which just lets you stream stuff from your pc to lets say your xbox..then by all means give it a shot..But if you don't need that stuff because that's all it does then stay with the normal activation. But like i said you can try via phone, with serial i provided, and if it does work be sure to let us know..now if you do the upgrade and it deactivates windows, don't fret..simply go through the measures to reactivate the normal method 
NOTE: or to make it really simple..you can back up your current activation which is what i would suggest with this tool thanks to josh cell software. which you can download here.
http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8084095/Advanced_Tokens_Manager
Simply download it run it and save the activation. Be sure to save your activation backup folder some were you can find it easily, i also suggest naming the folder Windows 8 pro activation backup. You can also save the backup folder to a flash drive or a portable hdd, so in the future if you need to reinstall for some reason you will have the backup already to go:) But do note that you will still have to enter the serial like you were going to activate..Then hit activate by internet..It will give error..then just run the activation back up and all is good :)"
,190919,2013-02-07T16:52Z,one your picture freaks me out and two this shit sucks. doesn't work. I'll use someone else. I put the serial ask me to restart and I did it again. restart again. I AM IN CIRCLES!

,Halloweenpsycho,2013-02-11T07:52Z,"@All Downloaders..
First before you even download and waste your time, please make sure your pc is compatible with windows 8, that you meet the requirements, with your Motherboard etc..Please note you may also need to Update Bios to correct issues blocking the installation of windows 8 or errors occurred with in the installation process. Before you Update Bios..I can't stress this enough..Besure your system is even capable of running windows 8, as at some points it is slim, but updating your bios with out being at least slightly knowledgeable of the procedures can result in a bricked system and you having to flash your bios to a earlier version..If you have no clue what the above means..then i would suggest sticking with your current operating system.
PLEASE NOTE THAT THE FOLLOWING SERIAL HAS BEEN BLOCKED!!!
PKQ6T-N8GMC-VXYX4-HWMTH-8HRDP
Below you will find a new key provided and a detailed instruction as how to activate.
PLEASE ALSO NOTE: DO NOT..I repeat DO NOT!!!
Talk to a customer service rep.. This is a quicker way to get the serials blocked, and the live customer service will have info on the key the automated system does not.. AGAIN DO NOT TALK TO CUSTOMER SERVICE REP..The keys provided are Genuine, but have exceeded online activation thus phone activation comes into play.. I am sorry for all the caps but this is crucial. Just follow the steps below 1 by 1 use the automated service as instructed. LAST NOTE: you CAN NOT!! use the Windows media center Serial provided in this download any longer, You will need to either find a patch for the WMC or a genuine serial which is out there with a little searching and patients.
The windows media center serial is also referred to as Upgrade features. SO please.. Follow instructions closely and i promise all will go well, if you deviate from instructions all may not go as expected. If you are new to the community please do not hesitate to ask before you do something you do not understand. One of us will be around to help, although it may not be 5 minutes after you ask the question it will get answered. There are some very knowledgeable peeps here. I am currently very busy with other projects, so i will be away for a while as i explain at the bottom of the page. But i will check back periodically and please be assured if i am unable to answer a question you have there are some very good people that will help you out. Also for those that have said this doesn't work, or it's fake etc...Look at all the people that have verified it as working, SO for those that assume it doesn't work..Just ask for help..It works..Trust me...

,Halloweenpsycho,2013-02-16T16:10Z,"for those seeming to have issues activating, i just want to provide information as to the validity of the current posted working key.
Product Key	: CQ7YK-YQNWC-KDJPF-2XB2P-KWXT7
Profile		: NT 6.2
Validity	: Valid
Product ID	: 00178-
Advanced ID	: XXXXX-01781-109-439185-00-
Activation ID	: 9c44-90a865f22e76
Edition Type	: Professional
Description	: Win 8 Professional Retail
Edition ID	: res-v1781
Key Type	: Retail
EULA		: Retail
Crypto ID	: 1781

Pleas note: that some of the information from the above description i have removed for obvious reason :)
Which means this is a retail key that is currently valid and has not been blocked, i don't want to keep providing new serials when i have checked current ones and confirmed them to be valid. As well being confirmed by others to be currently activating as normal.
So for the keys i have that i may later provide the community with once the key shows {Blocked}. I promise i am keeping a close eye on the keys and i will know the moment they are blocked, as i check them every two to three hours.
I hope that you understand why i am reluctant to provide a new serial, as if i provide a new serial when the others are still functioning, we all run the risk of those key's being {Blocked} and i would like to keep this torrent available to the community as long as i possibly can.
I apologize to those having issues, but if you continue to have issues, number 1..The keys i provide will only work with my torrents or a valid retail copy of windows 8 pro, and some Vl Copies. So you may want to use a Kms activator as much as i am not a fan of Kms activation, it will at least allow you to be activated for 180 days. Don't be discouraged how ever. I am working still on a permanent activator for windows 8.. I am close..Until then I suggest using the serials provided. or a kms :( ..
Please keep me current on your successful or non successful activations.. Thanks in advance.. "

instructions will confirm that in my 32 bit and 64 bit windows 8 torrent the activation method provided is still as strong as it has been.
So please for those of you wanting to use this activator please know that this is only a form of trickerie exploiting activation flawess.
The activator will not provide you with a genuine copy of windows 8 as the below instructions will. This activator is only a means to trick your windows
into thinking it is activated. If you follow below instructions you will be genuine. Here are the links to my two windows 8 torrents
with further detailed instructions of means to a genuine activation.
Link: 32 bit=   http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8069459/Windows_8_Pro_Retail_32_bit_%5BPermanent_Activation_Wmc_Included%5D
Link: 64 bit=   http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8061344/Windows_8_Pro_Retail_%5BPermanent__Activation_Wmc_Included%5D
These instructions were provided by IgorekPhD a gents confirmation from my 64 bit torrent..Big thanks :)
Instructions for dummies:

1. Use CQ7YK-YQNWC-KDJPF-2XB2P-KWXT7 to register Windows 8 Pro over the phone. DO NOT do it over internet. You must disable it and choose the phone activation method.

2. Call the UK number with Skype (free phone call) to get the activation numbers.

3. Enable internet and click on activate. Your windows is now fully and officially activated.

4. For Windows Media Center - click on Add Features from Control Panel -> System

5. Use key HQTY6-GPTG3-4YNXW-FFCQC-JB2M3

6. Go to command prompt (hold windows key + R) and type slui 4. That will bring up phone activation screen similar to the one in step 1.

7. Repeat Steps 2 and 3.

8. Congradulations, now you have Windows 8 Pro with WMC

Everything was tested twice yesterday."

First, I'd like to commend Halloweenpsycho for the upload. It worked great.. 

Second, to all patronizers of this torrent just care to follow the steps carefully to get the exxpected results. I got the pro edition with WMC with dimply follwing the instructions and sticking with the serials. There is no shortcut or whatever. Though reading steps and following every line is a bit of a hassle, it was all paid off!.

However, even with the pro edition, I still cant change my account picture and personalize everything.. Halloween, this one im having trouble with.. Tnx bro.."

Huge thanks in advance!"
,mattrix21,2013-02-21T14:23Z,"@Banan84

I installed windows 8 in my netbook using my USB flashdrive. First you have to make it bootable. To do it, you may use the powerISO provided by Halloweenpsycho in the first page of the comments in this tofrrent. Click tools then select make a Bootable USB. Select the ISO file of the Windows8 installer, then start.. You should change the settings of your booting priority to Removable devices before installing the new OS."

,Halloweenpsycho,2013-02-24T03:27Z,"Ok to all those providing support of my torrents i want to thank all of you. I will be taking a short break for a little while as i am writing some new programs, and correcting some more issues in the activator. I am in the process of a pre activated install of windows 8 32 and 64 bit. I am in hopes i will be able to complete it. As i said i work alone so it will take some time..But i wont be totally gone, i will check in from time to time..As there is a lot of people using my torrents that have added  lot of help in the activation process to get all of you up and going..For all of you i thank you very much for this. I am sure that any questions that may arise will be met with some talented people and testimonies that will guide you in the path of a successful activation. Also i want you all to know that i am not trying to throw a wrench or talk bout about kms, as it is a process that can help you activate. But just understand that 1 it will allow you 180 days of activation meaning it isn't permanent, and as for the emulated versions being offered, you need to understand that emulation is and has been a making in the works for many years.. Easy for beginners, just take a check Mame emulation for example, from some real superior professionals in the emulation field. I mean Emulation is not a 100% accurate, as a lot of methods are not. Future updates in windows 8 will be exploiting the emulation process of Kms emulation and making it more difficult as will many efforts to the activation of windows 8. Windows 8 in essence is not that great of a upgrade from windows 7, in which i prefer to windows 8 any day. But i have taken the time to familiarize myself with in order to be able to offer help needed in this new system. But people always like new things, and the latest technology, in which you will find the touch screen to be a step up in technology with windows 8 and that's really about it. Still that doesn't mean that we will just ignore it, as there are a lot of people wanting to use this software. So myself and others will always be working on ways around activation's in the attempt to offer a emulated genuine copy of windows 8 threw Activation flaw's. Except in the torrents i have provided these are genuine and permanent which allow for updates, and full use..So to all of us working to crack the case I say good luck.. I will be working in a effort to help further this software in the piracy community, Thanks for all your support. I will return.. "

If you are experencing these issues and the bios update does nothing for you, then more than likely your pc is not capable of running windows 8.

I've tried the windows 7 usb dvd download tool and rufus, Both are not working.

-while, rufus runs the boot, but before setup I get the error in file boot/bcd

First download Power iso prefferable from

now the iso you got from my torrent, once you have installed the power iso and you have it opened up simply drag the iso into the empty window. Now go to image settings, make check sure you tic the box UDF, now after you do this simply save the iso, by default Power iso will be set to save the file as Daa, so be sure to change that to Iso before you save the file. Now once thats all done you can now use the windows 7 usb tool as it will now recognize the iso as valid. :)"

,Halloweenpsycho,2013-04-01T06:10Z,"@Halloweenftw
well first Love DObby..:) With the reactivation of your back up you won't need to use the phone in anyway. All you need to do is use the original serial you used to activate windows 8. Now you may be asked to enter the last part of the serial, by the Advanced token manager in which you will enter only the last few number after the final dash.-XXXXX this should then go through a couple quick steps and bam re activated..As fir wmc you can use my new all in one activation as a quick fix 
https://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8319779/Windows_8_Personalization_unlocker_and_Activator_All_in_one

I asked because I have some problems with the modules installer process which starts on every bootup and consumes 80% CPU power for 1-2 minutes. I think its failing to complete something.

You can load from windows 7... at least i did that myself! from a windows 7 Ultimate version

the only trade-off is the installation time! it takes about 4hrs in total to complete! thus u have to be very patient with it!

all u need do is mount the iso file on a virtual drive and install directly from there...it gives you an option to upgrade (no need to load installation from reboot)..this option worked for my personal pc

on the other hand, you could burn d iso file to a dvd and also load from from startup or from windows running.

Was the bully mod that removed my trusted status that i earned a long time back. I was even told by staff he is a Bully mod. So he told me a couple months ago that he would think about reinstating my trusted status in a couple months so i pmed him and just asked him about it and i received this nice little reply 
Enough. We do not give skulls to people who hustle for them.

Do not ask me or any other member of staff about this again. 

So i am appealing to the higher ups and asking what the issue is. I am sick and tired of this Shit and being treated like a asshole. I have only tried to help people and provide good uploads, and all of this because i asked one night why i was kicked from chat and Soda replied With a nasty remark to get over myself and move on, and Everybodylies
https://forum.suprbay.org/reputation.php?uid=268627 commented on it and told me to Fuck off son. So a month after this run in with these two. I get some nasty stuff from a VIP member downing my uploads. I asked to have it removed and Everybodylies was the one to reply and said no. That i didn't mind. But for what he said about me before i told him what i thought of him. Next day my Trusted status was gone and a Smiley face from Everybodylies on my new torrent. And it took me a month to find out who removed it. Finally staff told me it was Soda. I pmed and asked him about it nicely. And he fed me the crap i was not trustworthy and he would reconsider reinstating my status in a couple months which i knew was a lie. And now, here i am. I tried to be nice and polite, but screw them. All this was done for spite! I may not have a account after this so if i disappear from tpb look for me at p2pdl.com some damn nice people there. O by the way the links above are too Soda and Everybodylies Reputation, Anyone feel like telling them what you think of them It would be a pleasure.

I will be making a website real soon about all the issues not just with tpb staff but other sites that have the same issues which i know of 3 others. It will be for the entire pirate community to drop by and let us know whats on there minds, there will also be a petition section with direct access to the site Owner creators, games fun crap all around.
