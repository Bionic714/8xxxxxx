This is a "True" Sweet discography for the most part. With Sweet's studio albums, included here are the studio albums from Andy Scott's Sweet, Brian Connolly's Sweet's 1 studio album, and Steve Priest's Sweet's live album from 2009. Also here are a few various compilations such as Sweet's "First Recordings 1968-1971", "Platinum Rare", and 2009's "Action: The Sweet Anthology", possibly the greatest Sweet compilation so far.

For the most part, everything has a CBR of 320, except for 2 albums; 1 being Andy Scott's Sweet's "SweetLife" with a VBR of around 190 Kbps and Steve Priest's Sweet's live album "Live! In America" which has a VBR of around 210 or so, so sorry about the par-average quality for those 2 albums, didn't have them so just picked them up from around the net.

Other than those 2 flaws, everything has a CBR of 320, so enjoy!
