Kessen was a PS2 launch title which garnered praise for its cinematics and score. The game is a real time strategy, depicting the war to unite Japan in the 17th century. Players control armies across wide open battlefields using a bird's-eye view. Special cutscenes allow players to view attacks, while zoom screens allow players to watch the engagement unfold.
