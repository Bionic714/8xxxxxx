This is Puzzle Quest: Challenge of the Warlords with update 1.02 and the expansion Revenge of the Plague Lord. 

I unexpectedly stumbled on this fan port of the expansion -- it was never released for the PC -- on the Steam forums and was really excited as I love the original game and thought others might be excited about this as well. The expansion adds four more classes you can play with, effectively doubling the number of heroes. Here's the link: http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2750283

Installation: 
1. Mount the .cue image in Daemon Tools
2. Unzip & run the patch
3. Unzip the expansion and place only the assets.zip file into your puzzle quest/patches directory and you're good to go.

Enjoy!
