 The De Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter is one of the most versitile aircraft ever designed. Still Canada`s most successful commercial aircraft program with more than 800 built, the Twin Otter remains popular for its rugged construction and useful STOL performance.


The De Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter (aka Twotter) is one of those aircraft that should have been replaced by some new aircraft at least a decade ago. But it`s not. The DHC-6 still flies and in fact the amount of registered is risen at this moment. The main reason for it is the fact it is just as much at home at the poles as it is in the tropics. It is used to maintain routes to airports up to 9000 feet and to ferry between islands. It will fly everywhere using wheels, floats or skis. It`s a legend.

This STOL twin turboprop commuter airliner was in production between 1964 and 1988, with over 800 build it has been the most successful aircraft build in Canada. The model is currently been upgraded to a 400 version by Viking Air who holds the type certificate for the Twin Otter.

The high end model presented by Aerosoft and partly designed by SibWings includes all versions, and advanced avionics set. It is perfectly suited for use on some of our most favorite scenery products such as Lukla X and German Airfields 1. The gauges include two high end Bendix King systems that provide near perfect navigation and communication capabilities. Of course the original panel is also an option. One of the main design goals was to keep the memory and CPU load of this aircraft as low as possible to ensure good framerates. By keeping the number of non essential items in the models low this was achieved. The Twin Otter is only just more demanding then the very basic default aircraft of FSX!
