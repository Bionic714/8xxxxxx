,PikeyBoo,2013-01-27T13:20Z,"Hey _SnakEye First of all thanks for all the amazing downloads, they are much appreciated by The Pirate Bay FSX community.

I have a quick question about one of your older torrents the [FSX] REX Game Studios - REX Essential+ Overdrive ( http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7794294/[FSX]_REX_Game_Studios_-_REX_Essential__Overdrive ) is it possible to do a clean install if you have no previous versions with this download?

Once again thanks and keep up the wonderful torrents!!!"

[T],_SnakEye,2013-01-27T22:57Z,"@PikeyBoo, the torrent you referenced is the Full program, you can either run it as an Upgrade path (not really a path, but it will just overwrite your older version) or just from scratch.
I personally ran it from scratch, i.e. I did not have REX previously Installed on my machine."
