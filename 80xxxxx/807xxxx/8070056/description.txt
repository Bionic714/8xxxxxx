CherryPlayer 1.2.7 has just been released with a single new feature: the ability to view VK videos! This means we just brought in a very, very large archive of high quality videos into CherryPlayer. Make sure that you search our video archive now, it's a completely new experience.

We do recommend everyone to create and use their own accounts withto experience this addition in the best possible way. Due to restrictions from VK movies may otherwise not play on all attempts. CherryPlayer will automatically ask you for this when it is necessary.

CherryPlayer 1.2.7 has been released with the following updates:

1. Added VK Video support.
2. Added clearing VK music titles from symbols like "&", "&gt;" etc.
