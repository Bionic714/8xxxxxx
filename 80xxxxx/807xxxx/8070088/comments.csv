[V],STFmaryville,2013-01-27T15:59Z,"I'm not sure, but you might be thinking of ""Life with Archie"" volume 2 (2010-present). It takes place when the gang is in their mid-20s. You can find the first 25 issues by searching here on TPB; I uploaded some of them and blackcanary uploaded the rest."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-01-27T18:41Z,"It's also possible, although less likely, that you're thinking of this obscure gem from the past:
