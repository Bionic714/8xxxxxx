,Amaroq64,2013-01-27T13:16Z,"Notice how almost every file is exactly 150mb. The files I got from the mirror had only five files that were 150mb, while the rest were smaller. (Roberts was 22.7mb.)

I was initially alarmed when a few checksums between my mirror files and the pirate bay files didn't match. In the cases of these mis-matches, The Pirate Bay's files are 150mb while mine were smaller.

But there is still one file that is not exactly 150mb, and that is Kagan. Kagan is 132mb.

It's possible that there's still a 150mb Kagan out there somewhere. But Kagan is also the last in the order of concatenation, so Kagan could've just been what was left over after 150mb splits. No way to tell which right now."
,LRTS593701,2013-01-27T13:42Z,"I cross-checked Kagan on other working mirrors (the rest were too slow to download fully, I just checked the size) and it's 133M (actually 132.72M) on all working servers, so I guess that's what remained after the 150M splits.

@Amaroq64: I think Kagan.Warhead1 is complete because its content ends with '=', which is a typical end for base64. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64#Padding Once again I'm just guessing; imho it's a shame the Anonymous did not provide checksums nor made a torrent in the first place."

@zrool21, I agree, if this was really done by Anonymous and not our corrupt government, Anonymous did a shitty job at spreading the Warhead. They could of done the same thing they did but post the checksum file or create a torrent like you said. Would of saved us all a lot of headaches and time. lol
Now all we need is the damn key/password to see how good this Warhead really is..."

,ChloeBlue,2013-01-31T23:22Z,"Steelllynx -- I see what you mean.  I guess I thought it was one password for each file.  I haven't downloaded this yet.  I didn't want to bother if I didn't have the correct way to open it.  I copied and pasted those keys from another site, but I cannot find any information about whether anyone out there has actually opened these files.  

Of course, like everyone else, I'd like to know when anonymous plans to release the info if demands are not met.  It's all very interesting to me and I'm actually hoping laws get changed because of this.  Although, I'm very sure the gummint will use this all as an excuse to exert even more control.  ugh.

All these computer geniuses are seriously a force to be reckoned with.

No matter how many times the government or elitist corporations try to screw us, there will always be a hacker, with the right stuff, that will happily screw them right back.  In my view, computers give this generation a very unique leverage against the almighty ""rulers"" of the world.  Leverage that the masses have never existed before in history.  So, as long as the 'gummint' and the bankers and corporations are reliant upon computers, they will always be vulnerable.  And that thought makes me happy.   "
,Nanovirus13,2013-03-19T20:28Z,"There is no nuclear warhead. There's nothing but trash here. The SCOTUS names are just eye candy. You better get in with a good platoon or battalion because when martial law is enacted we probably won't have a stable power grid and the US internet will be locked-down. It's only a matter of time before China or Russia develop/copy the Tesla Peace-Ray. That is the reason the F-22 program was halted, the JSF is in full swing, and the USAF is converting to unmanned aircraft. The only 2 ways to take out a laser defense network are either attrition via air armada or ground/naval armored assault. The lasers cannot effectively penetrate armor, but to what degree is still unknown. Besides everything else, IF there was a nuclear detonation, martial law would immediately go into effect with the militias not staged and communications being locked down. If Anonymous claimed it, then anyone without a badge or BDU would be blind and isolated; easy pickings for any organized force."
