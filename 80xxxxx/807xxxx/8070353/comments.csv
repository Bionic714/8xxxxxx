,zulithe,2013-01-27T05:31Z,Thank you. Can you tell us about your encoding process? Is this the 1080p itunes version re-encoded? Or is jut just ripped out and put in a new container? I'm curious about what level of quality difference there is between this and a pure 1080p itunes file?
,TomasJahlos,2013-01-27T09:55Z,Please 720p MKV? Thanks

[T],loadstone2k12,2013-01-29T17:42Z,"The release Teenage.Mutant.Ninja.Turtles.2012.S01E13.I.Monster.720p.WEB-DL.AAC2.0.H264-iT00NZ (676 MB) is incomplete, missing 2 minutes in the end of the episode, this is why I didn't share.

The reencoded version Teenage.Mutant.Ninja.Turtles.2012.S01E13.I.Monster.480p.WEB-DL.x264-mSD is also incomplete."
