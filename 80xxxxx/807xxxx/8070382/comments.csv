,baiptphy,2013-02-24T16:30Z,"Quality was good - A9 V9, thnx to the uploader! Movie was OK as i expected it to be! Storyline is intelligent and entertaining and acters were OK! I usually watch all the movies at film.kbc44.com because they have HD's but they didn't have this one so im happy to have piratebay :) Thank you once again uploader for this great share!"
,aParadox,2013-03-03T01:32Z,"@beebeerubi  You need to leave mommy and daddy's computer at home, someone might take you serious when you spout that shit, numbnuts. It's a rip of a Bluray, compressed down to 700megs. You do not know what a cam is, you don't know what a dvd is. Get the fuck out of here.

As for the movie, it's fantastic;
A: 9
v:10
Great rip for this size, really good quality."

,Nearsighted_Scrappile,2013-03-29T19:59Z,"The quality of the audio and video is great, but DON'T get the subtitles that zyarc linked to.  It is very poorly translated and has terrible usage and grammar mistakes."
,IAATOBTAS,2013-04-27T03:20Z,I'm having an issue with the video stream on this file not showing up. is this just me?
