,karty,2013-01-27T10:29Z,"This torrent has the hacktivator which will modify your important system files and put you on risk.

THIS WILL NOT ACTIVATE YOUR WINDOWS.

Instead use Heldigard's KMSnano stuff which gives you legitimate KMS activation which lost for 180 days; also survives Windows Updates.

You can get it from here: https://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8070957/KMSNano_v16.1_Offline_Office_and_Windows_KMS_Activator"

,UPXD,2013-01-27T13:56Z,"hello , this is activator working 100% i test this ... 64bit and 32bit ... this is best of activator"
,karty,2013-01-27T14:25Z,"Is this best activator?

Ha ha ha.. Nice joke..

This is one kind of Korean shit, this will never activates Windows.

As of now, THERE ARE NO PERMANENT ACTIVATORS for Windows.

It is better to be in safe side to go with Heldigard's stuff."
,karty,2013-01-27T14:27Z,"Hi Ultraboom,

64 bit Windows works in this iso. You have to boot from this; if you try to load it while Windows running, you will get an error says, insert 64 bit disc."
,karty,2013-01-27T14:29Z,Comment got deleted. Why?????
,anarchist9027,2013-01-27T18:04Z,"This activator is what is known as a ""HACKTIVATOR"" It uses patched files from the Windows 8 Release Preview. I GUARANTEE you use that activator and run sfc -scannow in a command prompt, your shit will be deactivated. Be smart and not an idiot. There is no loader for Windows 8 and there probably never will be."
,EliteG91,2013-02-06T00:14Z,"Just wanted to make a ""follow-up"".

I downloaded and installed the other day. Sadly you need a DL DVD for this, so I used ISOBurn, and made a bootable usb drive (8gb drive).

Well I wiped my drive, formatted, and installed. Flawlessly! 

Well then I ran the activator, and worked fine. But some odd reason, all the Microsoft Store apps would just say ""pending"", wouldn't download. Well after a few reboots and crap, then they downloaded just fine, and still do.

Well my ONLY issue, was that maybe every 30-45 mins, a ""activate Windows"" screen would pop-up, and I had to exit, then go back to where I was. Well, I ran that ""Personlise fix"", even though I could change my settings, well now I have been using it for 2 days, and not an issue at all! Says ""activated"", no annoying pop-ups (Even though it said activated prior to running the ""personalise fix"".

So yes, this works perfectly fine for me now! Gets all the updates, and everything. WMC plays fine as well.

But if you're having that pop-up issue like I did, please run that ""personlise fix"" program that is included, and it will fix you up 100%!

Oh, and btw I installed the x64 Pro 8 w/WMC version."
