After 35 years of rocking the world, pioneers of progressive rock Yes take to the stage in Boston, Massachusetts to share their memories and greatest hits. Songs was recorded in May 2004 at the Tsongas Arena in Boston, during the band's 35th Anniversary Tour. The film kicks off with a view of the stage from out over the middle of the crowd. This stage, which was designed by longtime Yes album cover artist Roger Dean, could make a stone-cold sober person think they were on some kind of acid-trip watching the band play inside of a giant aquarium amid a mass of bright coral reefs and colorful, floating amoebas. Who the hell knows what those things are supposed to be .
