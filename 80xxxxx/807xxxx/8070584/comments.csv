No prob dude.  But I have to point out: when you are fishing, the goal is not to strike the fish on the head with bait.  I'm an atheist so I simply want to hear what he has to say.  My first impression is that it's a book written to keep someone within the church with a valid question to keep them diverted from the complex issues. ...a feel good book, if you will.  I will be pleasantly surprised if it's more than that.  
Why do we pay such authors for their efforts anyway?  The goal of their writings is to influence their readers to find meaning within the author's thinking.  Under that more honest approach, I should be getting a check from Peter Kreeft for $20 dollars for reading this, if it happens that it doesn't provide any provocative ideas regarding the myseries of existence and concsiousness."
,Books4rea,2013-01-27T16:11Z,"Well, i didn't mean to insult anyone by saying ""don't be a parasite and keep seeding"". it's just that i uploaded another torrent some days ago, ""Socrates meets Marx"" and every single person who downloaded just deleted the torrent 2 seconds after they were done."

That's one of the most well reasoned arguments regarding ""persuasion books"" I've read here in a while."
,diawkdfi,2013-01-30T23:47Z,"Thanks again for the upload!  It's important to have an open discourse of all ideas.  Please upload anything similar you have.  These writings are in the nature of advertising and your uploads are actually promoting these authors.  I would never have purchased or read this book otherwise.   
It looks like you picked up a few more seeders this time around."
[T],pharmakate,2013-02-03T01:28Z,"Thanks for the upload -- stuff like this is always appreciated, though this author grates on my nerves.

As a Catholic myself, I'd recommend to any open-minded atheists Does God Exist? by Hans Kung -- even Kreeft recommends him, despite the fact that Kung is in perpetual hot water with the Vatican.

As for Kreeft's own work ... not likely to be found convincing to any unbeliever, unless the unbeliever knows nothing at all about the history of the debates surrounding God's existence."
,antignor,2013-02-07T18:26Z,"Sometimes I 'm interested if there are theological minded people who actually have something interesting to say. It was to be expected, but this book is not one of them. It's a huge pile-up of countless listings (1, 2, 3, ... and a), b), c), ....) of of all named and unnamed logic fallacies know to mankind and already debunked arguments, only intended to brainwash the gullible.

An example of such an argument:
Truths can't contradict each other. There are several kinds of truths: what you know from your heart, what you get from your senses and logic reasoning (the scientific kind of truth).
If you ""know"" from your heart that God exist, then this can't be contradicted by logic and science, so therefor it is hereby logically (scientifically) proved that God exists.

It just goes on and on with this kind of rubbish. If you can see through this kind of ""reasoning"" and the straw man that is set up then this book is not for you because you'll be bored and annoyed and many times it will send you shivers down your spine. If you think there is some kind of truth in the above reasoning then you're a perfect victim for religion, so then I'd highly recommend it to you.

Theology is no philosophy. Theology is no science either. Theology is not worthy of being taught at colleges and universities. In theology it is first assumed that God exists (or whatever doctrine your religion says to be true) and then all kinds of nonsensical ""logic"" is made up to ""prove"" it to be true.

If you're a curious person I advice you to read a book about logic and critical think or view lectures on these topics (there are plenty of this on TPB I suppose), before listening to (or reading) this book. When you've done that you'll only laugh at this."
,kmo_9000,2013-03-15T18:17Z,"@diawkdfi 

I'm curious, you accuse people of faith of hiding in the Church so as to avoid ""real"" problems. Yet you also say that you have no interest in actually listing to what Kreeft has to say, and you say that Theology has no place in modern universities.

It's funny how you say this, yet in my four years undergrad degree there were classes offered about ridiculous things such as ""paranormal activities."" And when I approached the professor asking to write about the existence and nature of angels, he shot be down the moment I mentioned Kreeft's name. Yet it's perfectly acceptable to write an essay about ghosts, vampires and haunting.

I have read many philosophy books, and taken many university level courses in philosophy. The only kind of person what will laugh at Kreeft is the kind of ignorant fool who decided to go into it with a closed mind to begin with.

Why did you take the time to write here anyway if you're an atheist and so sure of your beliefs? Why don't you write your own books if you are so sure of your self? 

You modern atheists are such a unique combination of hubris, pride and arrogance. It's striking every time I see one of your kind try to make an argument. "
