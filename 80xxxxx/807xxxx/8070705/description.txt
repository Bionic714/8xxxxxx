Summary:

It is the summer of 1940, Hitler's army is advancing towards Paris, and millions of French civilians are on the run. Amid the chaos, two British children are being hunted by German agents. British spy Charles Henderson tries to reach them first, but he can only do it with the help of a 12-year-old French orphan. The British secret service is about to discover that kids working undercover will help to win the war. For official purposes, these children do not exist. - Goodreads Summary of The Escape (Henderson's Boys #1)

Note: Really screws around with the historical events of Hitler and World War 2, and is mainly for an older youth audience. An action packed series!
