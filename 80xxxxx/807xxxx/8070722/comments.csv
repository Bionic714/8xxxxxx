,watamouri,2013-01-27T16:40Z,thanks bro :)
,fbsnoww,2013-01-28T12:48Z,"I do appreciate your effort and do not want to sound ungrateful, but I would try to make a suggestion: please do not cut out the time between the rounds - that minute between the rounds is usually when coaches give advice to the fighter, and it can be good to hear them to know what to expect in the next round. Anyway, thanks a lot for the upload, keep up the good job!"
,sonicated909,2013-01-28T17:39Z,@fbsnoww: I assume as this is free on Fox there are commercial breaks between rounds?
,watamouri,2013-01-28T17:50Z,thanks for the upload! :)
,fbsnoww,2013-01-28T20:00Z,"@sonicated909 yes, I guess that's the case. good point sonicated909!"
,KracKils,2013-01-30T05:06Z,That may have been the first time something was settled without flaming in an online comment thread.
[V],SecTPB,2013-01-30T10:07Z,"You can be assured that I do not cut any of the actual show out in any of my rips, ever. This is a national TV station. There are an insane amount of commercials. Believe me, I HATE cutting commercials out of videos so the last thing I'd want to do is make EXTRA cuts. :)"
,Bshroom,2013-02-01T04:12Z,"This is not a documentary about UFOs as one may be led to believe by poorly and hastily reading the description. Just scantily clad and sweaty men with anger issues, engaged in fistycuffs."
[V],SecTPB,2013-02-01T05:46Z,^The hell kind of comment is that? Lol. Weird people.
