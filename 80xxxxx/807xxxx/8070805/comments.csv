Because in this version was done a hidden information removal in Adobe Reader and unfortunately it also removed the hidden text, which deleted quite a few numbers and letters randomly. This is clearly visible in the Table of Content the most, but there are some places throughout the Code.
Would be greatly appreciated!"
