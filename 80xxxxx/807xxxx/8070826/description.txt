Drafts is the quick, easy way to capture and share text. In Drafts, text comes first ΓÇô open the app and get a new, blank draft ΓÇô ready to type. Don't get bogged down in a timeline just to tweet or post to Facebook. Don't tap your way through multiple screens to get down an email or SMS. Don't navigate folders, create files and name them just to jot down a note or create a todo.

In Drafts you can get that text down quickly and decide what to do with it later. Extensive output options let you send text to Twitter, Facebook, App.net, email, SMS, a Calendar event, quickly save it to Dropbox or Evernote ΓÇô or forward it to a growing list of other Apps such as OmniFocus, Things, Fantastical, Byword, Sparrow and more.
