a couple flaws on the original source are fixed with this version (2013-01-06):

- all trackmarkers were moved close to the beginning of the songs
- a couple trackmarkers were added
- the volume on all tracks had been lowered by -1 db (the original files
   were way TOO HOT right to the 0 db-line)
- all fades and repeats between the discs are gone
   (there was a clumsy disc-break between rocking horse and gambler's roll)
- all transitions are seamless now
- a couple nasty dropouts had been fixed
   after 4 seconds into dreams to remember
   in the last 15 seconds of one way out
   in the last 30 seconds of layla
- a minigap between dreams to remember and one way out got eliminated
- for burning CDs the whole show would fit on 2 discs 
- all files got renamed
- all files are tagged now
