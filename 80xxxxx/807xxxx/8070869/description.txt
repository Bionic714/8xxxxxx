Early on in history, it was applications and needs that led to discoveries, rationalizations and laws of science (for example, mechanics, astronomy, and agriculture). A few centuries ago, the situation reversed and science became an intellectual endeavour in itself, quite like arts and humanities, and in turn generated a variety of applications and technologies (steam engine, electrical appliances, transistors, computers). The current situation is again a subtle role reversal, where demands and needs have led to new science (biotechnology, material science, and robotics). In an increasingly literate and technologically aware society, ideas in science need not be opaque even to the poet or the painter. The jargon and the equations, the instruments and implements are technical, but the basis is an idea that can be grasped by anyone. Popularization of science concerns just this-the capturing and interpreting of these ideas in science, and the bringing of "town" and "gown" together. This book on popular science is one such effort.

About the Author
Apart from his professional activities as a biologist, Professor D Balasubramanian has been active in the popularization of science for two decades. Besides his fortnightly column in the national newspaper The Hindu, called "Speaking of Science", he also participates in science programmes on television (UCC TV, Turning Point), radio and on the web. For these efforts, UNESCO, Paris, awarded him the Kalinga Prize for the popularization of science in 1997. He has earlier published Genes and Means, Cats have Nine Lives, and edited The Indian Human Heritage, and The Deccan Heritage.
