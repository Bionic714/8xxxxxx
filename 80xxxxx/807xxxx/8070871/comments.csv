,amarendra_a27,2013-01-31T17:31Z,as if kamal sir will pay you for paying their tickets. He is multiple times richer then you and one flop is not going to afftect him. there used to be a time where this so called artist just used to perform at people's special occassion and now they are so rich that they are protected by so many police that they they will cut your ass off if you try to come near them. and also they are urging government to waive of taxes for them so that they get even more reacher. todays india when 90% people work hard to meet their to ends. these people fly in private chartererd flights. and people put them across thier god idols and worship them WTF?????....... I would rather watch pirated movie and feed poor people for the amount i spend in buying tickets for their movie. I will feel more near to god..

Kamal is best as always"

[V],zyx55e,2013-02-02T09:14Z,"guyz, kamal hasan is almost broke by producing dis film. if it dosent sell he'll hv to sell even his house to repay his debtors. plus the courts hv stayed the rls of dis film too.

the least v can do to help him is not circulate this 1 on the forums/net so dat folks go to the theatre n pay for wotchin it so dat he gets back his investment.

V need to sacrifice dis much for such a talented actor/producer/director"
