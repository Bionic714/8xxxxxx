An intimate, affecting portrait of the life and work of ground-breaking performance artist and music pioneer Genesis Breyer P-Orridge (Throbbing Gristle, Psychic TV) and his other half and collaborator, Lady Jaye, centered around the daring sexual transformations the pair underwent for their ΓÇ£PandrogyneΓÇ¥ project.


Seven years in the making, this intimate, affecting portrait by celebrated filmmaker Marie Losier chronicles the life and work of pioneering musician and performance artist Genesis Breyer P-Orridge - starting with Throbbing Gristle in the 70s to the still very active cult favorite Psychic TV - and how h/er chance encounter with a dominatrix/performance artist in New York called Lady Jaye brought about a singular and enduring artistic collaboration and a brazen partnership that defied all perceptions of love.

Shannon M. Houston of PASTE MAGAZINE describes THE BALLAD OF GENESIS AND LADY JAYE as 'a rave party (the fictional kind that only plays fantastic music).... It is also an EXCEEDINGLY GOOD movie... with its brilliant score, remarkable imagery and explosive, vibrant tone.' The Playlist at indieWIRE gives the film an 'A-': 'ultimately a deeply felt, albeit odd, love storyΓÇª an engrossing depiction of two individuals, who happen to be non-conformists unafraid to go beyond love.' And Neil Mitchell of ELECTRIC SHEEP MAGAZINE writes, 'You'll be hard-pushed to find a more strikingly candid, and unexpectedly moving, portrait of life, love, and creativity of the experimental end of the rock'n'roll spectrum.'
