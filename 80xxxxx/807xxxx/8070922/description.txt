Star.Trek.Enterprise.fanedit.In.A.Mirror.Darkly.Complete.720p.mkv

This is a fanedit of the Star Trek Enterprise episodes s4e18 and s4e19: In a Mirror, Darkly. This two parter has been converted into a single movie to improve the pace of the story telling and help make the viewer forget this is TV. The In a Mirror, Darkly episodes are rated 2nd and 5th best out of Enterprise's 98 episodes by IMDB users and it takes place in an alternate reality - perfect for making them into a single movie! Also, it's a personal favorite for the Mirror episodes and even for all of the Treks.

Final Edit: Handbrake RF=19 1,754,570,463bytes
1h18m25s 1280x720 25fps AVC High@L3.1 2539Kbps, 5.1 48KHz AC3 384Kbps

Changes:
* Removed the breaks for commercials
* Removed most fades after commercial breaks
* Raised the volume 3db with no clipping since the source was very quiet
* Moved the s4e18 opening credits to the very start
* Removed the s4e18 closing credits
* Removed the s4e19 opening credits
* Blacked out the text of "In A Mirror, Darkly, Part II" at 42m12s

Notes:
* There is a small overlay logo in the lower right, it's not very obtrusive like some logos. Nothing can be done for this until the Blu-Ray comes. Tricks to mask logos usually make it more noticeable.
* Big thanks to EvilAlchemist for the 720p 5.1 captures of s4e18 and s4e19.
* The source video looks good but is not the best so please be patient if the 720p quality isn't the greatest. Once the Blu-Ray is available a pristine fanedit can be done.
