,IlluminiX,2013-03-05T05:02Z,"Works amazingly well! I have tested this with Norton 360 [2013] in XP and 7 64bit and hit ""Convert"" in Safe Mode. When the system restarts in Normal mode, I was greeted with 180 more days of coverage! Even though Virustotal seems to indicate it is some sort of malware, I found nothing amiss after using it and it worked as described so my guess it is a false positive like most other trial reset programs. Thank you for the very useful share!   "

,IlluminiX,2013-03-09T13:21Z,"jdurdan17 - You pressed the ""CONVERT"" button when you were in SAFE MODE? If you are definitely in Safe Mode and hit Convert it should give 180 days as I took a 60 day subscription and converted it to 180 day on 3 separate occasions. "
