,chacrE5a,2013-01-27T18:10Z,"Thnx.

Also much appreciated for the AIO of Win7 again, they're great for USB installs.

Any chance of a Win2008/2012 set?  :)"
,dpjackal,2013-01-27T21:03Z,I currently have windows 7.  Anyone know if upgrading will be successful with this?
[V],murphy78,2013-01-27T22:36Z,"mixing install types in an AIO requires extra sources folders and some changing of setup.exe commands. It's not impossible to mix versions, but it would quickly get over 8gb.

As far as which versions to use with win8, the line from the description says it all:
""Windows 8 Pro/Enterprise Default/N/VL""

If you upgrade from windows 7, upgrade to one of the versions listed above. I have integrated those and you can click my name and find different ones."
,bigorna12,2013-01-28T00:43Z,They will be able to do a launcher for permanent kms?
[V],murphy78,2013-01-28T01:47Z,"There's no such thing as permanent kms. That's why you run the ""run trigger.cmd"" to install the task to check days remaining every time you reboot and re-run kmsnano if 30 or less days remain."
