heldigard gives many thanks in his text file.
Read it and you can find out who else are activation champions.

KMSNano is an Offline KMS Activator that emulates a KMS server in the memory of
your computer and sends activation data back and forth attempting to activate
volume versions of Windows and Office. I have personally activated KMSNano without
having my lan drivers even installed on a fresh install of Windows 7.

This is v16.1.  There are other earlier versions that may or may not work currently.
You should always check for the latest version before using.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Activates:
Windows Vista Business/Enterprise Default/N/VL
Windows 7 Pro/Enterprise Default/N/VL
Windows 8 Pro/Enterprise Default/N/VL
Windows Server Std/Data 2008/2008R2/2012
Office/OfficeVL 2010/2013.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Retail-Only Versions of windows that will *NOT* activate are:
Vista Starter/Homebasic/Homepremium/Ultimate - Default/N/E
7 Starter/Homebasic/Homepremium/Ultimate - Default/N/E
8 core/coreN/ProWMC
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Requirements: . NET 4.0 or Windows 8

Instructions:

1. Extract Files to a folder. Ex: C:KMSNano
2. Run "Run Trigger.cmd"
(TriggerKMS will run every boot, and if you have 30 days left or less, it will
re-run the activator)
3. Wait about 45-80secs while the files run in the background.
(It doesn't let you know when it's done, you can check task manager or just wait)
4. Done. Run the Check_Activation_all.cmd to verify your activation status.

For Windows 8, you can get the watermark to go away by auto-hiding the taskbar.

To fix any botched activations from other "hacktivators" or activation problems
in general, you can run admin command prompt command "SFC /SCANNOW"
I very much recommend running that command on older systems with stale system files
that may have a lot of inconsistencies.

Note that Pre-Release versions of Office or Windows will NEVER activate.
Get an actual release if you want to activate. (RTM or Retail)

Why use this program over any other activation method?
-It does not modify any of your system files.
-Because it's not a crack or a hack.
-Because it's the only way to get legit activation without using legit servers.
-Did I mention it activates ALL KMS activation software?

Change Log from v16:
- Fixed activation of Office 2013 in Non Entr/Pro Windows.
- Smart detection of Qemu running for allocation memory error.
- Add TriggerKMS v9.1
