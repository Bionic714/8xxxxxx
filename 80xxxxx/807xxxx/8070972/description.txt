Taken from Urban Dictionary:
Trap music is based on use of the 808 Roland drum machine, pitched and re-sampled hiphop/rap vocals, pipe flutes, gangsta synth leads, and various FX. Similar to rap without the main vocal, Trap music has been gaining lots of attention from major DJΓÇÖs and labels. Although, the style originated many years ago, Trap music has recently been making a new school comeback in many new forms such as ΓÇ£TrapΓÇ¥, ΓÇ£ChirpΓÇ¥, ΓÇ£SeaPunkΓÇ¥, ΓÇ£PsyTrapΓÇ¥, and ΓÇ£TrapStepΓÇ¥. Earliest known examples can be found by artists such as Triple Six Mafia, UGK, Swisha House, and Gucci Mane. Tempos range widely from 135-175bpm which is uncommon for most major genres of electronic dance music (EDM).

In laymenΓÇÖs terms, Trap music would be best described as a recipe;

1/3 hip hop (tempo and song structure similar) ΓÇô however vocals are usually pitched lower or higher 
1/3 dubstep (similar drum arrangements, different builds and drops) 
1/3 dub (Low frequency focus and strong emphasis on repetitiveness throughout a song)
