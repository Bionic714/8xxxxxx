Notes:

Sadly, this is the final episode of Attack of the Show. I'm glad I've been a part of spreading this fantastic show for those who weren't able to see it. Sadly, it's come to an end and it's likely I'll be gone with it. Hopefully something comes out of the new G4. It's been great to see what AOTS has become over these past few years and I wish the best to everyone on AOTS and at G4. You guys gave it one hell of a run.

We're moving on up in the world.
Thanks guys.
