,anon109,2013-04-06T01:19Z,"There is some glitch in some tracks (sound is off for minutes) and there is a serious sound bug in Solar Sailer song, it's really bad.

Do not download it."
,Pr0nogo,2013-04-19T17:19Z,"After a cursory glance, the files seem to be fine, invalidating anon109's report.

The actual soundtrack isn't very good, but the upload was fine."
,spango_joe,2013-04-29T02:07Z,"I agree with anon109

Periods of silence in certain tracks. So far track 7 at around 3:50 and Track 9 at 3:30 and Track 10 at 5:30
