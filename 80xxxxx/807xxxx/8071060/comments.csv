2.Don't start the program 
3.Go to the crack folder and click on patch.
4.If patching is not done, browse to the folder where lumion is installed and click on patch.
5.Enjoy!"

,lalli22,2013-02-06T22:56Z,Is it because it hasn't patched ? How do i know when it has patched ?

,Qavs,2013-04-09T21:01Z,"For people who can't get it work, follow this instruction carefully! 

1.) Install Lumion (No need to disable Internet connection)
2.)DO NOT start Lumion first.
3.)Go to the crack folder, copy it!
4.)NOW THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART! PASTE IT IN THE INSTALLATION DIRECTORIES! 

eg : C:/PROGRAMS FILES/LUMION "
,Qavs,2013-04-09T21:01Z,"
5.)Now patch it.
6.)This step is important too, you can use Windows Firewall to block lumion.exe (inbound and outbound) or any firewall software will do, just block the in/out connection.

7.) VOILAA! Enjoy your Lumion 3.0 :)"
,iceman1759,2013-04-14T16:04Z,"hello guys I downloaded this lumion but when I click on the patch something comes on but I don't see any button that will allow me patch, I even copied it to the installation directory. A tree with some kind of dog shows but no button to crack. please help"

,oislegacy,2013-04-27T15:23Z,seed plz 
,oislegacy,2013-04-27T15:29Z,seed pls im only mising 10% pls and thx
,witttiger93,2013-05-15T05:09Z,"For those still having issues with the patch working, this might solve the issue if you are not seeing a gray ""patch"" button at the lower right of the graphic with the tree and the dog and the cracker info: go into your display settings through Control Panel and set the radio button for screen graphics to ""Smaller-100%"" instead of ""Medium-125% (Default)"" it will prompt you to log off; after logging back on, run patch as administrator and you should now see the ""patch"" button to click on and activate it. Follow all other install instructions as stated above. I think this problem is only Win 7 Ult and Win 8.  Hope this helps. "
,mojtabata2001,2013-05-17T17:36Z,"i just tested it
