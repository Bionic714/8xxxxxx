 This story revolves around a famous poet     
 who meets a woman who is in trouble.         
 In order to treat her, he takes her to       
 Shimla in a big hospital, but soon that      
 woman gets possessed by devil and goes       
 out of control. Now the question remains     
 that what is the relation that poet shares   
 with her which compelled him to go to        
 any extent to save her, why she was          
 possessed by devil and who is the devil.
