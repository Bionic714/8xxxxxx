Butthole Surfers - Discography (1983-2002)

Genre: Acid Punk / Alternative / Experimental

Great name, great band, but great gods they're strange. If the family from Texas Chainsaw Massacre had an 8-track recorder, they would have made music like this. Originally tagged as a punk band, Butthole Surfers evolved into sonic experimentalists, like Velvet Underground but much, much deeper underground to where the boys with the pointy pitchforks play. The early Touch & Go recordings are the strangest. In the '90s, the Surfers inched into the mainstream, eventually releasing a Top 40 record with Electriclarryland (albeit a very strange one).
