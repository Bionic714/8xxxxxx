Release Notes:

Yes, the episode title was suppose to be for episode 8 according to all
online guides, but the official website and facebook page states this
really is a new episode and really is titled Aliens Among Us.

The previous release labeled S01E08 Aliens Among Us turned out to be
episode 10, Alien Evidence. Oops. Oh well. Whatever.

No, there is not an episode 8 or episode 9 available at this time.
