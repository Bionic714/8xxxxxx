,bruiserbruiser,2013-03-22T10:01Z,"Hi sorry I can't seem to get this installed! The readme file says:

1. Open temporary files folder (""DRIVE:Documents and SettingsUser NameLocal SettingsTemp"" in Windows XP or ""DRIVE:UsersUser NameAppDataLocalTemp"" in Windows 7, or press (Win+R) - %TEMP% - Enter).

2. Start installation in normal mode.

3. Select language.

4. Go back to the temporary files folder. Two new folders will have been created. Open the last one (in some cases it is the 1st one), and then subfolder of its folder.

5. There you should find a file ""ascrypt_pro.dll"", Overwrite ""ascrypt_pro.dll"" in that opened folder with file from ""Crack"" folder.

6. Now proceed with installation (Hitting ""NEXT"").

7. Have fun :)

My problem is I can't install it from my temporary file  as instructed.

Any help please! "
