,Mothra67,2013-01-27T19:01Z,"Thanks for that! I should have checked that on wiki.

if you ever find those issues give me a link please!  Another series of Ditko's I would love to have is Mr. A, but I found no scans whatsoever as of yet."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-01-27T19:50Z,"You can grab them all from this:
http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/6477827/

It also has complete runs of Captain Marvel Adventures and Captain Marvel Jr.

I'll be on the lookout for Mr. A"
,dbranson17,2013-01-27T21:58Z,Strange Suspense 75 is mostly empty and one of the three image files in the container is corrupted...
,Mothra67,2013-01-28T00:56Z,"I will take care of it, I didn't know there were corrupted files....."
,Mothra67,2013-01-28T03:26Z,"OK, I got the correct #75 into the torrent, and I recheck every other file and there was no corruption on my end, can I suggest downloading it again?"
,dbranson17,2013-01-28T23:50Z,"Not sure what you're lookin' at...
Strange_Suspense_Stories_075.cbr is a 1.7mb rar container with 3 images, the last of which is corrupted.  Why don't you try checking this issue and up'ing it separately."
,Mothra67,2013-01-29T06:37Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS ANYMORE!  I found the problem, fixed it, and reuploaded the new torrent here:

Sorry about that people, had to fix the issue and work for a living!"
