ΓÇó Background information on the classification of forgings according to the method of manufacture:

ΓÇó Importance of steel production methods in establishing the expected properties:

ΓÇó A critical review of over 60 ASTM forging standards covering applications as diverse as railroad and power generation equipment, pressure vessel components, and a wide range of general industrial equipment

ΓÇó The effect of various types of forging operations relative to soundness and application

ΓÇó Specialized nondestructive testing methods developed for forgings

ΓÇó Economic and quality factors regarding the choice between forgings and other steel product forms

ΓÇó Special considerations in the heat treatment of forgings

ΓÇó Pros and cons of the timing of machining and the effect of test specimen location on the anticipated mechanical properties of the forging

ΓÇó Surface treatments for enhancing forging performance and life

ΓÇó Forging flaws and examples of service problems
