Unable to conceive, Thakurain Lajjo enlists    
the help of her maid, Mahua, and approaches    
a demon named Nevla, who assures her that      
she will indeed give birth but if it's a       
daughter, then she must surrender her to him,  
to which she agrees. Shortly thereafter,       
she gives birth to a daughter, Kamya, but      
refuses to surrender it. Mahua poisons her,    
abducts Kamya, and takes her to Nevla, but     
Thakur Pratap Singh intervenes just in time,   
banishes the former to a coffin in a cavern,   
and rescues his daughter. 18 years later,      
Kamya herself will be compelled to approach    
and resurrect Nevla in order to win the love   
of Kumar - who she is obsessed with - and      
will do anything to make him her's forever.
