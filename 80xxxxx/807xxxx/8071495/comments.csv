,wetworx12,2013-01-27T14:26Z,I don’t “need” my AR15 any more than Rosa Parks “needed” to sit in the front of that bus.
,binkmale,2013-01-27T15:00Z,Rosa Parks did not need to compensate for a small penis.
,wetworx12,2013-01-27T15:28Z,"Civil rights are civil rights, why don't you believe in them?"
,wetworx12,2013-01-27T16:06Z,"Ms. Parks needed to compensate for her skin color.  Seems everyone needs to compensate for something.  

What are you compensating for?"
,Matt45045,2013-01-27T16:11Z,"I believe in gun rights, but you comparing owning a gun to a the civil rights movement is disgusting. It wasn't simply a seat on a bus as it was wanting to be treated as a human being. I doubt you believe in any rights for any minorities, which is sad.  "
,wetworx12,2013-01-27T16:46Z,"LOL, as a Black man, I am rather sensitive to any of my rights being stripped from me. 

But thanks.

What other rights are you willing to give up?"
,lumpdedump12,2013-01-27T16:59Z,"""It wasn't simply a seat on a bus as it was wanting to be treated as a human being.""

It isn't simply owning a gun as it was wanting to protect ourselves from threats domestic and abroad.

Don't pick and choose rights when it is advantageous."
[T],spanikopita,2013-01-27T20:12Z,"Amen, my brothers. While all other Civil Rights are expanded with fury, the 2nd Civil Right is having the life squeezed out of it. It's choking."
,Stanselm,2013-01-27T20:44Z,"The second amendment was specific for the time in which it was written.  Remember we had to amend the Constitution to stop slavery, give women the vote, stop alcohol use, and bring it back.  No one is trying to ban guns, just being a little common sense by getting rid of certain guns and accessories.  Another step would be to make gun training mandatory for first time purchasers.  The NRA is owned by and works for the gun industry.  Nothing they put out can be trusted."
,Stanselm,2013-01-27T20:45Z,i.e.  Nothing the NRA says can be taken seriously
,wetworx12,2013-01-27T21:56Z,"You I presume would prefer to trust the government?

You realize that the 2nd amendment is to protect us FROM government?  Right?

My people have not been treated very well by this government, and we will not have the slave collar put back our necks.  

Trust the government at your own risk."
,Gusar19,2013-01-27T22:42Z,"Government is in hand of those who want to put slave collar (or microchip) on all of us.It is up to brave and proud people of US to protect themselves from that.Ban on some guns will not prevent those who want to abuse  2nd amendment to harm innocent,vulnerable people.
So why bother.Point is first to ban automatic  and after other guns..."
,Kalusa,2013-01-27T22:47Z,"King says ""I own guns"" and believe it's my right to do so.  For you, the common folks, not so much.  More broadly, for those who question why someone needs a weapon --- it's the Bill of Rights.  Not the Bill of Needs. "
,Stanselm,2013-01-27T23:09Z,"The majority of guns are in the hands of uneducated white men.  That's not a group I choose to identify with.  There aren't too many black TEA Partiers.

BTW, in case you think your gun will protect you from an unjust government, their drone trumps your AK47 every time."
,wonderwang,2013-01-28T00:54Z,"Almost ALL the murders committed are committed  by uneducated BLACK men...and the rest by liberals.

Statistics PROVE that's the case...unlike some of the rants some racists have made previously.

After all...ALL the high crime rates are in liberal enclaves populated either by minorities or left wing nancies."
,Stanselm,2013-01-28T02:03Z,"So were the guys in Sandy Hook and Aurora and Columbine and Oklahoma City liberal or black?  I can't remember but you must be right because you have STATISTICS.  Hard to argue with numbers, or a fucking idiot in your case."
,Kalusa,2013-01-28T03:42Z,"The gang bangers in obamatown, otherwise known as Chicago, kill more people in a few  weeks than all of the people you named.  "
,GourmetPrince,2013-01-28T05:42Z,A bunch of government dependent pussies here who think that legislation is there to keep them safe. It's such a god damn shame that these coward imperial imbeciles have infiltrated the American populace. 
,triggerjerk,2013-01-28T10:44Z,"I like to ask of people who fear my guns: What kind of automobile do you drive? 

Because, you see, very few people really NEED an oversized SUV, or a 5.0 liter Mustang, or an imported or domestic fast sports car. But we buy and drive them, knowing that the disparity in weight and speed will kill more of the people driving smaller cars than all the so-called ""assault weapons"" will. 

It's called freedom. If the constitution needs to be amended, then do it, and good luck with that.

Fact is, there are several dozen gun companies that the NRA represents, and something like 4,000,000 dues paying members, dutifully sending in their $20 or $40 or $100 yearly who are their backbone. 

Full disclosure: I had been an NRA member for decades, as a competitive shooter. I let it slide when they wanted me to support Mitt for president. I rejoined the day our president announced his war on guns. "
,RogerMadoff,2013-01-28T17:22Z,Thanks for uploading this so we don't have to give a dollar to a gun-banning fascist organization to read it. Cheers.
,fuck-gun-nuts,2013-01-29T14:17Z,"Simple steps for you demented small-dick gun fetishists:

1.  Get your favorite weppin
2.  Load it up
3.  Lube the barrel, real good like
4.  Insert with a gentle twisting motion
5.  Pull trigger
6.  Enjoy your departure from this civilization that you so desperately hate.
7.  Au revoir, bloody assholes."
,justlildon,2013-03-20T03:33Z,"I'm glad to see many in this community still thinking clearly. The 2nd amendment was not written ""because of the times,"" but because the writers of the US Constitution and Bill of Rights had the wisdom to know that the rights of free people would always be challenged. They knew that free people needed the right to protect their other rights, and that one day it may become necessary to do so. ""Laws that forbid the carrying of arms . . . disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes . . . Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man."" 
--Thomas Jefferson, quoting Cesare Beccaria in On Crimes and Punishment (1764)

Jefferson knew that not only ""gun nuts"" would need to take arms and protect themselves. 
""One loves to possess arms, though they hope never to have occasion for them.""
--Thomas Jefferson to George Washington, 1796. ME 9:341

He is quoted as saying: (but I have not seen primary sources) ""The beauty of the Second Amendment is that it will not be needed until they try to take it."" (Matt Carson, On a Hill They Call Capitol: A Revolution is Coming (Carsons Publishing, 2007), 131.)

All in all I would not give much heed to the writings of Stephen King on guns. However brilliant of a writer he is, he apparently does not understand the importance of the rights of a law abiding citizen to bear arms. 

So go ahead and laugh at all of the so-called ""gun-nuts"" who tenaciously support the 2nd amendment, but remember that these people are  the same people who are also fighting for the other 9 amendments in the Bill of Rights for you and the rest of us.

If the 2nd amendment is free game to repeal, you have to ask yourself: what's next?"
