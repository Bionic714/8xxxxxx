- In the upper right hand corner of the screen, the words ""Filmfix SE"" is imprinted. I confirmed that this is imprinted throughout the entire movie.

- ""314rat272 presenterar (med egen oversattning)"" is embedded within the first few seconds of the movie.

- There are embedded Swedish subs throughout the film.

Additionally, the video quality is subpar for a 720p release. My suggestion is to download another version or wait for the official release date which, I believe, is the 12th of February."

Swesub in the title also means swedish subtitles and the information is in swedish. I think most people understand that this is made for swedish people.
The source is written in the i information.
Please read title and information before you download. "
