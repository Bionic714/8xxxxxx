,bob9001a,2013-01-28T12:16Z,another pitiful effort from the worst encoders out there
,ScottyD7421,2013-01-29T01:23Z,"Many thanks for uploading {C_P}, appreciative as always.

V/8 & A/8

There is no point in addressing @bob9001a and asking why if {C_P}'s quality is always so bad does he keep downloading because @bob9001a is either one of those people whose purpose in life is to rag on people or some production companies toss bag who leaves negative comments to throw people off from downloading. Regardless, the quality of {C_P}'s uploads are pretty decent and i've so far had no problems. 

Cheers"
,bob9001a,2013-01-31T15:18Z,@ Scotty the fucktard loser. Just because your tiny little mind is satisfied with dreck is no reason to attack me you cock-gobbling little pissant. Stop encouraging people to download this incompetent fuck of an encoder's releases. There are MANY superior versions of this episode available and allowing this crap in the pool just muddies the water.
