That was uncalled for, always to soon regarding the subject of rape, regardless of what is worn a disgusting act in any rreal human beings eyes.

Thnx for the up SaM"

Anything that draws attention to India's cultural war on women is fair game. Sorry if you disagree. It's time for the rape, gender-based abortions, unjust imprisonment, bride burning, etc etc to come to an end. Perhaps if Bollywood wasn't so busy blatantly ripping off American movies, it could actually focus on producing films that took a hard look at the situation in a blunt, unapologetic manner.  This sort of garbage here? Yeah, that's not it. "
,tpbse2010,2013-01-28T11:51Z,"@topeak: Big talk about human values for a citizen of a country with a past which includes near extermination of an indigenous race, enslaving millions of people from other continents, starting or igniting most of the conflicts in the last 100 years and a current state of mass unemployment, the highest distortion in income between rich and poor. Don't worry, you wont live long- if the morbid obesity doesn't kill you, a gun-toting deranged person definitely will.  You are on thin ice, don't breathe too hard"

Yes, I realise this is made in India, but my comments re gang rape still stand. If you watched some world news you'd realise that rape of women in India is at epidemic proportions. India is on a par with Muslim countries when it comes to the treatment of women."
