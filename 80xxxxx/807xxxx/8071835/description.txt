And the next part of the Aldebaran series, Antares.


Humanity migrates to a new planet, the secrets of which Kim Keller will have to unravel.

After the failure of the Betelgeuse colonisation mission, Kim is back on Earth, where she is an increasingly popular figure. Meanwhile, advance scouts on planet Antares have witnessed some distressingly strange events. Worried about the future of this new mission, the sponsors of the Antares project call upon Kim to accompany the first colonists, offering legal amnesty for Alexa and Mark in exchange. Its the beginning of a new adventure for the young woman and her friends.
