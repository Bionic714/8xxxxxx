And something wrong in Holland? While seeding 100 people passed. Only 3 Dutchmen. Normally about 40%. Thx"

Think young people regard music like candy or something you can use to irritate their parents and neighbours. Knowing some music history, I understand its something else. Something more constructive Thanks."
,mido_remedie,2013-01-28T15:26Z,"Hi Guys, thanks for the support. Cant complain about the interest. Uploaded more than 100.000 playlists last year. However, besides you my friends, there is hardly anybody to leave a comment (hit and run). Pity. Without some positive feedback also good things will die, eventually."
,mido_remedie,2013-01-28T16:06Z,"About the Dutch Problem, I did not notice and its too much effort to check (locate ip). Maybe there was something on television when the torrent passed the first page or something like that. Happened to me once with Angus and Julia Stone. After re-issuing, it became the most popular torrent (downloaded > 6000). Everything seems to work as it should. I will pay attention."
,one_of_7.500.000.000,2013-01-28T16:31Z,That is a lot. How do you count because trackers tell a different story. Do you have a top ten?
,mido_remedie,2013-01-28T20:32Z,"If a tracker says 40 seeds and 10 downloads, you know enough. I count the unique combination: torrent, first five characters (nnn.nn) old fashion ip-addresses and download client (utorrent). I ignore all new ip's. Each host receives the last 99% fulfillment requests (someone else can do the actual upload). If I count all unique requests my count would be almost three times higher (same requests generated over a range of ip-addresses). So a quite conservative count."
,mido_remedie,2013-01-28T20:55Z,"Oh yes, I forgot, top ten:

Soldier (Angus & Julia Stone)
Sister Moonshine (Supertramp)
Say My Name (Beyoncé)
Un-Thinkable (Alicia Keys)
Hey You (Pink Floyd)
Master Degree (Johnny Guitar Watson)
Easy Lover (Phil Collins)
Dignity (Bob Dylan)
Cherry Pie (Sade)
Bit By Bit (Mother Mother)
Desert Sunrise (Brett Dennen)
Lounge, Chill, Easy Listening
Get Your Share (Fink)
Indie Playlists 1212
Women Of Ireland (Mike Oldfield)"
,one_of_7.500.000.000,2013-01-29T00:53Z,"Nice list. Number of downloads I presume. And Personal? My favorite Indie playlists are: Stay Awake, The Flag and Puppy Love. Still love to play them (publically) every day."
,mido_remedie,2013-01-29T02:29Z,"Difficult question. Nice Pick.

I like to think the last playlists are the best. However this is not true. If I have to choose: The way in (Indie 1203 Jurado, Passenger. Kimbra, the Shins etc) and Shiver (Indie 2011: The National, Bright Eyes, Gotye, Noah, Starsailor, etc, etc) and one that really rocks: Run, Run, Run (Indie Year Summary 2012: all lists are quite good).

But personally I like the Sweetlists (1 to 4) a bit more. Best CD ever: Tubular Bells from Mike Oldfield. Its like a basic course in Music and after 40 years, still omnipresent, especially in Documentaries (these few magic notes).

Favorite Indie artists: Angus and Julia Stone, Fink, Mother Mother, Fun, Of Monsters and Men (I love her)

Favorite Song: Play in Reverse from Lex Land, became a kind of new Yesterday for me and catches the essence of Indie music.

Ok?"
