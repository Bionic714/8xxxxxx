,L4F,2013-02-01T17:44Z,"Program failed to install under Win7 X64

Got the following error message:

""Failed to create directory
C:Documents and SettingsAdministratorDocumentiDVDFabTemp""

Note the misspelled word ""Documenti"". Furthermore, there is no user on my machine named ""Administrator"".

I tried the install in normal mode and in Administrator mode. It failed the same way in both cases. It displays the same error message two times. The install continues on and eventually the OS reports it has stopped working."
