River Monsters: Series 1
Extreme angler, Jeremy Wade, is on the hunt for freshwater fish with a taste for human flesh. This rip-roaring ride through the dark side of nature mixes action and adventure with mysteries, edge of the seat chase and a battle of wills between man and almost supernatural beasts. These killers lurk in the serpentine waterways of the planet, mooching murderously underwater, growing to truly awesome sizes. Like all the best horror movies the images are intense and immediate, the grade is gritty and real, together heightening the drama on screen. With graphics overlaying the live action, Jeremy illustrates to the viewer, using forensic methods, exactly how these river monsters are constructed to kill.


1)  Piranha 
Extreme angler Jeremy Wade investigates the piranha's fearsome reputation. He travels to Brazil to swim in the Amazon with the fish and incites them into a feeding frenzy, before tracking down survivors and eyewitnesses of attacks.

2)  Amazon Flesh Eaters 
A man swallowed whole by a fish. A body eaten alive from within. Another penetrated in a most unnatural fashion, and yet more with multiple stab wounds. Jeremy Wade is in pursuit of these notorious killers to discover the facts -- to determine if their crimes are real and their methods as gruesome as reported.

3)  European Man Eater 
Biologist and extreme angler Jeremy Wade travels to Germany to investigate tales of a beast that has been on the prowl in European waters for the past 700 years. His investigations take him to Spain, where he discovers first-hand that as a consequence of a science experiment gone wrong, the Wels catfish is growing to man-eating proportions and is capable of everything depicted in medieval records.

4)  Alligator Gar 
America boasts a species of fish reputed to have committed a number of violent attacks on humans. The alligator gar is said to be as vicious as a shark and as large as an alligator. Biologist and extreme angler Jeremy Wade heads to Texas on a hunt to uncover the truth about the notorious creature.

5)  Amazon Assassins 
The fossil record shows that the arapaima fish has roamed the waters of the Amazon River since the Jurassic age, and uses its bony tongue to crush prey against the roof of its mouth before swallowing. Biologist and extreme angler Jeremy Wade encountered the species once before and came out second best, so this time he is taking no chances as he investigates every aspect of this huge creature.

6)  Freshwater Shark 
The bull shark can tolerate fresh water, allowing it to travel far up rivers and into close contact with humans. Biologist and extreme angler Jeremy Wade investigates the death of a man and a bloody attack on a racehorse as he tries to establish the truth about the notorious fish.
