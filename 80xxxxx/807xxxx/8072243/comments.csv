,Skullix,2013-01-31T13:55Z,"If you took 2 seconds to just add the torrent to uTorrent, you would see it is in .mkv format."
,sacredkill98,2013-02-02T06:03Z,"well maybe i dont want o start downloading it if its not the format i wanted you dipshit, go put your 2 cents. "
,Skullix,2013-02-04T12:47Z,"Are you stupid? You can just click ONE BUTTON, SEE WHAT FORMAT ITS IN, IF ITS NOT THE ONE YOU WANT, YOU CANCEL THE DOWNLOAD.

TAKES TWO SECONDS OF YOUR TIME LAZY DIPSHIT."
,MikeB1917,2013-02-05T14:22Z,It really isn't a complicated thing.
,Sleepmore,2013-02-08T00:05Z,"It's not so obvious, it took me like a year to understand myself.

On the top left you have Files:
In this case Files: 47

You click 47 and then you see all the files in the torrent.

Less hate more help?"
,ghostWolf,2013-03-01T13:04Z,"Thanks ""sleepmore"" - this was news to me - I have always started the download then then checked the format - this is far better - brilliant - have this always been available ? I think I beat your record in terms of finding out new things here :) * used tpb since start - new record ?"
