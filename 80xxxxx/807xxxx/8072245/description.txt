If you don't know what's happening these will sum it up.  Phil Campbell claims the DUI was a set up and that Bubba's side wound up with his briefcase.

The whole thing is unbelievable.

The Burke show has the Mistrial hearing from Fri afternoon.  It is a must listen to show.  Testimony starts around 22 min and lasts a little while with Burke providing commentary.  

The mistrial clip has the lawyers summary of the motion for a mistrial.  It is off Fox 13 TB and lasts about 15 minutes.

If you have the time, listen to Burke.


Trial resumes tomorrow.  Defense will call Hurricane, Kevin Haslett and others.



Just because it says "no seeds," doesn't mean there aren't any.

My max upload is 50K/sec. Sorry. It's all I've got. Slow torrent is better than no torrent. Please seed. 

I can only seed each upload for a day or or two.  I have too many competing priorities.  Please keep seeding.
