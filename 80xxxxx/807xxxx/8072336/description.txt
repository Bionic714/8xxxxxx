And from Alice, the second The Pacific Air Farce book.

The South Pacific. July 1943. The air war rages over the Soloman Islands taking its grim toll on men and machines. Its sombre business for most, but not all. Whether its raids on Sushi-Land by day or the local nurses by night, the men of number OH-OH squadron (the Vultures) are determined to make the best of it. Not that their best is always any good... stand by for gag bombardment! take cover!
