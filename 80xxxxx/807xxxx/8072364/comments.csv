,Expedio,2013-01-27T18:12Z,Can anyone who finished the download comment? How's the 1080p quality? Is the audio alright? Is this as good as loadstones other uploads? 
,Boh2,2013-01-27T20:55Z,This team always puts out good episodes. Why should this be any different.

Because this http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8071746/Young.Justice.S02E13.The.Fix.720p.WEB-DL.AVC.AAC-iT00NZ has audio messed up, background sounds and etc ok, but when people talk it's coming only from the left."
,maitkarro,2013-01-30T01:00Z,"This also has the audio problem, all character voices come from left sound output."
