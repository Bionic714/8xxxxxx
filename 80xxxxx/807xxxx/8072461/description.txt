It makes use of a lot of unique features

Bot Genesis is a complete robot character for Genesis featuring a sleek futuristic design with retro elements reminiscent of Aikobot. Bot Genesis is also a versatile toolkit for creating all manor of cyborgs with Genesis. It shares the same exterior material groups and UVs (V4 default) as Genesis so you can use any texture made for V4. The low profile design of Bot Genesis means you can add most clothing and hair without poke through and mechanical parts can be loaded individually or as a set.
