,sufiblade,2013-01-28T06:27Z,"Ah I was going to download this off others but I decided to wait a bit more. Fortunately :) Thanks, mind reader"
,SnugglesP13,2013-01-28T09:12Z,"Thanks YIFY I love every one of your torrents, since you are the only one I ever download I figured I would ask if you could do To Rome With Love with the english subtitles for the nonenglish parts and The Perks of Being a Wallflower"
,SacTus,2013-01-28T09:13Z,How in the world does he encode a 720p Blue-ray into 850 Mb while others are reporting in at 4 GB?

,mememini,2013-01-28T21:44Z,@SacTus by sacrificing quality
,Rezna4,2013-01-29T07:33Z,YIFY your Video quality is excellent always but why Audio is too low? Please do something. I am always your supporter. 
,ja_iom_jedi,2013-01-29T12:54Z,"As always YIFY, excellent video quality for the file size but audio is often way too low which spoils the whole experience of an otherwise great encode."
[V],RosaMannen,2013-02-01T15:07Z,Yes totally agree. The audio really really needs to be a little bit better. An extra 50 MB to the filesize would really improve the experience. Thanks a lot for your great work!!
,Shifty_Shellshock,2013-02-02T01:32Z,Yeah I need to boost the volume on the 42 inch tv loads. Talking parts are very low and the loud noises are too loud lol
,Mole18,2013-02-05T08:48Z,"Yify!!
you are the man!
you guys, if the volume is low for you, make a research and you will find that there are many programs that boost the volume for you."
,Mole18,2013-02-05T09:11Z,"VOLUME!!! 
If this is your problem here is a link to a video that shows you how to fix it, sorry that is in Spanish, everybody have a friend that knows Spanish right? Ask for help to them den...
It's working 100% secure and free..
Good look..."
,Mole18,2013-02-05T09:52Z,"SORRY, I forgot!

On youtube look for: 

Normalizar el volumen de videos mp4 (IPOD)

It works only on .mp4 files and it do not need to be for IPOD, just any .mp4

I use this every day..."
,glittergirl97266,2013-02-10T05:32Z,"Half the people say audio is not good, the other half have it listed as a 10. Dafuq is going on here?"
,arif_2016,2013-02-11T19:46Z,"Great quality, A10 V10 - thnx to the uploader! Movie was also good as i expected it to be! Storyline is intelligent and entertaining and acters were OK!

,imsharkbait,2013-02-27T04:06Z,"Good movie, stupid ending...well they all can't be blockbusters.  Quality is superb, thanks mate!"
,enonumus,2013-03-02T07:48Z,"You idiots that comment about the specifics of a movie should be SHOT.  If you want to rate the movie along with the torrent audio/video quality, fine, but don't ruin a movie for everyone else by talking about what you did or didn't like about it.  People look at the comments section of a torrent to see if it's fake or real, what the quality is, and if there are any problems with it.  They don't need some prepubescent prick ruining the movie for them.  If they want to read movie reviews and spoilers, that's what IMDB and a dozen other sites are for."
