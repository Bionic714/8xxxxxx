,ThatOtakuNextDoor,2013-01-28T21:45Z,Is there any viruses?
,7Shardz,2013-01-29T04:03Z,"Looks shady, especially since I've seen 5G here and there.  Confirm?"
,dilinwe,2013-01-29T04:07Z,a couple of virus has found
,niad,2013-01-29T05:30Z,"I don't know what's inside the iso files but inside the 3 rars that are already finished,avira and malwarebytes find nothing,so i continue downloading."
,RiverRaidII,2013-01-29T10:51Z,"No virus detected with AVG 2013 and Malwarebytes.

The iso files contain the game-disks. The game installs without problems
with the instructions given in this torrent. If you find a virus, it's time to upgrade 
to an useful anti-vir program. Have a look on the techsupportalert.com site.

,hopedeny,2013-01-29T19:04Z,i can't believe im saying this yet again. false positives are very very common on virus scans. especially when it comes to cracked .exes. simply looking at the number of seeders alone can help identify a safe download. anyway... when was the last time anyone got a virus from here? been using it for years and only had one that was legitimate.
,dilinwe,2013-01-30T20:28Z,my av is a shit but i dont understand how to change the language to japanese everytime when i run the game?
,RiverRaidII,2013-01-31T16:42Z,"Google for ""japanese locale context menu"", the first hit should get you on the right track. 
There are also useful mods to be found and overall helpful people around."
,Shungbat69,2013-03-15T10:53Z,Is this any better than Sexy Beach 3 or Zero? :D
,sheesh10,2013-03-31T13:06Z,still in japanese..story no translation??
,RiverRaidII,2013-04-04T22:00Z,"You'll find most, if not all, the information you desire on the hongfire forums."
,CandYYen,2013-04-07T23:11Z,"I dont know why, or if anyone else had experienced this, but I cannot download a single KB...."
,CandYYen,2013-04-07T23:14Z,nevermind its working
