but this doesn't last for an hour or so... then the message pops up saying next launcher could not locate your purchase in play store, kindly reinstall. If you, by mistake click on home key.. then your next launcher is gone :( ... used droidwall to block next launcher to connect to internet... still no use... :'("
,hunter_hunted,2013-02-10T07:50Z,I don't know why people post the torrents for Free softwares when we can sonwload from Google Play. I downloaded this shit and it didnt last 3 days. Today i rebooted the phone and message pop-ups that WE CANT FIND UR FOCKING Licence. We all know that we are pirates even pirates have some honor.
