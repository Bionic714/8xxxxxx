  Scottish rock trio Biffy Clyro's 2013 album, Opposites, is the band's sixth studio effort. It follows up the band's hugely successful 2009 Mercury Prize-nominated release Only Revolutions. Originally planned as two separate albums, Opposites is now set to be released as a double album featuring at least 20 cuts. In August, the band posted the song "Stingin' Belle" online as a preview of what to expect from the album. The band also revealed that Band of Horses lead singer Ben Bridwell will also guest on two tracks.
