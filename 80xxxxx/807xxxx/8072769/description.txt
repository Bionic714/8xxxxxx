This is a remodelling of the interior design for the UTOPian CIRCUS PDF.

The orginal file was modelled in word and converted to pdf.

This file was created in InDesign by myself and is the file used for the interior layout for the paperback issue. It looks more presentable, more attractive on the eye and more pleasing to read, i hope.


SO here it is, Utopian Circus - book 2 in the City trilogy.

Coming Soon:

Super CITY torrent pack:
1) A Rising Fall eBook
2) A Rising Fall Musical (mp3 and flac)
