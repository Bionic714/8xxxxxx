Information
------------------------------

For better or for worse: the vows may be the same, but in our increasingly diverse society, popular wedding traditions are far from what you would expect.

Married In Britain provides a portal into the lives of Britain's newest arrivals facing the everyday challenges of establishing a new life in the UK, as they prepare for one of the biggest days of their lives.

We are invited to celebrate a diverse array of customs and cultures as couples embrace their new home while seeking to hold on to familiar traditions. They offer us a fresh look at Britain, sharing their experiences of getting married.
