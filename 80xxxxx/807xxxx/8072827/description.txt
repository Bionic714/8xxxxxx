This is a remodelling of the interior design for the UTOPian CIRCUS PDF.

This is a reworking of the original pdf file applying the formatting from the paperback version of the book.

The orginal file was modelled in word and converted to pdf.

This file was created in InDesign by myself and is the file used for the interior layout for the paperback issue. It looks more presentable, more attractive on the eye and more pleasing to read, i hope.


SO here it is, A Rising Fall - book 1 in the City trilogy.

Also available in PDF format: 
 
- Utopian Circus (book 2) in paperback layout   here:
