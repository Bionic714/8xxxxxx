,fung808,2013-01-28T07:23Z,Hey Extreme do you know where i can find Chasing Mavericks cam or dvdrip i've been trying to look for it but i cant find it.
,ShiroDream,2013-01-28T09:29Z,"So as a XviD is the quality in between a DVDSCR and DVDrip - which is followed by BDRip?

I know Extremezone quality is superb no matter what, but I was just curious on the order of best to last."
,Mr_Heisenberg,2013-01-29T07:11Z,"^lol xvid is just the type of file, it has nothing to do with the quality really. screener < dvd < bdrip < BRrip < Full Blu Ray "

I suck her titties and eat her pussy and passionately kiss her in my dreams every night, but I awaken before I get at her feet :-("
