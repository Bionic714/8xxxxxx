---(NOTES)----

Thanks to the original uploaders for the sources!

We used the ITA source for both audio and video as it offers noticeably better PQ
than the US source and a 24-bit DTS-HD MA as opposed to 16-bit LPCM 5.1 on the US
source with similar quality.

Subtitles from all sources have been synced and muxed together as the ITA source
has only Italian subs.

The chapter titles were taken from the DVD release and appear to fit in exactly.
