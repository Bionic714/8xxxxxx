There is an insidious trap which runs counter to spiritual progress of a person who struggles to live a Christian life.It's so insidious, as few traps of Satan,because it appeals to people who ask to have a clear conscience.

A large number of Western religions,fails today to protect their followers from this trap.And while these people boast of their purity,they are located in the unpleasant position to imitate the bad example of the Pharisee of the parable of the Lord,who,even he although be careful tocomply the Law,he had not learned humility,and he degrade the sinner,but remorseful and vindicated tax collector.
People like this are often refuse the Orthodox Church of our Lord,and cling to totalitarian religious groups,as they misunderstand of the respect of the Church for the free will of the people,and of the forbearance handling of the sinned Christians.

Keep your behavior excellent among the Gentiles, so that in the thing in which they slander you as evildoers, they may because of your good deeds, as they observe them, glorify God in the day of visitation . . . For such is the will of God that by doing right you may silence the ignorance of foolish men. (1 Peter 2:12, 15)

Hypocrites! Hateful! Greedy! The accusations will come. The key is to silence our critics, not by taking a defensive stand, even though that worked for Elijah, but by exhibiting good behavior with which the accusers cannot argue.
