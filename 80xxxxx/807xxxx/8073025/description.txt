J.S. Bach - Brandenburg Concertos (Jean Pierre Rampal, Maurice Andre) 


First, I would not have known of this recording of the Brandenburgs were it not for Dark_Swordsman sharing it with us in 2009. I've listened to this countless times and the more I listen, the more I love it. Again, many thanks to Dark_Swordsman.

I'm very excited to be able to share this copy of the Brandenburg Concertos after looking for a high quality version of it for the last couple years. I purchased my own copy about a year ago and the record seemed to be in great shape. The people at a high-end audio store - I won't say which one - actually let me listen to all four sides of it on their Wilson speakers and I was blown away. A guy who works there offered to rip it to HD 24/96... so here it is, converted to 320kbps mp3. 

I did not remaster or clean it up in any way and you can hear the pops and crackles of true vinyl. I'd say this rip sounds damn good; at the very least I can hear a lot of things in this rip that I don't notice in others.



May it bring you as much pleasure as it brings me ;)



(I'm happy to upload the original HD 24/96 files as well if people want it. )
