:: DESCRIPTION ::
Earthly Powers is a panoramic saga of the 20th century by Anthony Burgess first published in 1980 and begins with the "outrageously provocative" first sentence: "It was the afternoon of my eighty-first birthday, and I was in bed with my catamite when Ali announced that the archbishop had come to see me."
On one level it is a parody of a "blockbuster" novel, with the 81-year-old hero, Kenneth Toomey (allegedly loosely based on British author W. Somerset Maugham), telling the story 
of his life in 82 chapters. It "summed up the literary, social and moral history of the 
century with comic richness as well as encyclopedic knowingness", according to Malcolm Bradbury. In an October 2006 poll in The Observer, it was named joint third for the best work of British and Commonwealth fiction of the last 25 years (along with Ian McEwan's Atonement, Penelope Fitzgerald's The Blue Flower, Kazuo Ishiguro's The Unconsoled, and Salman Rushdie's Midnight's Children).
