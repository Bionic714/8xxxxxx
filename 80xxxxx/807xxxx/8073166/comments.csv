,ectoendomezo,2013-02-04T00:25Z,"Ethan? Really?

I laughed spontaneously...out loud..when the ""Evil Kiddies"" glared into the camera like a bad Halloween Polaroid..literally..ridiculous.

Is it tax write off's? How are these movies getting made?"
,arif_2016,2013-02-11T19:47Z,"Great quality, A10 V10 - thnx to the uploader! Movie was also good as i expected it to be! Storyline is intelligent and entertaining and acters were OK! I usually watch all the movies at film.riotintl.com because they have HD's but they didn't have this one so im happy to have piratebay :) Thnx once again for this great share!"

Audio is just a little low, but good quality. Movie is well worth the download. Another great upload by YIFY. Thanks."
,Skipps,2013-02-13T20:31Z,"Am I really the only one having problems? I dont know why, but it's not showing any files on UTorrent. Im using an alternate proxy, but I've never had trouble pirating with it before. Any suggestions?"
,cold25th,2013-02-15T00:42Z,thats what i like to see some one who uploads it as MP4. i am sooooo sick of that mkv crap!! it hardly plays anywhere! MAN i hate MKV!!!!!
,babydinas,2013-02-16T21:32Z,thanks you can't wait to watch
,Slusho64,2013-02-27T07:26Z,"YIFY is great for a lot of movies, but in this case I would advise against downloading this. Sinister is a dark movie, which makes compression artifacts in this encode very distracting."
