Hi everyone :)


I'm uploading new updated version (January 26th 2013) of my screenplay:


WARHAMMER 40K SPACE MARINES


I fixed some minor/major mistakes in both versions and made opening 
battle scene a little more dramatic.

So far it took me about 16 months to write it, with average of 2-3 hours a day.

Screenplay is in two versions:
- Polish (finished): used for sending to my neighbours and friends.
Pages: 159
- English (still needs some work): translated all by myself.
Pages: 158

Formats:
- .docx (MS Office Word 2007)
- .pdf

Fell free to download it and read it. 
Comments are most welcome. Please tell me what you think :)


If you're uploading this to other torrent sites, please at least paste link leading to this site :) 
or write something like: "It's not my screenplay... I found it on PirateBay blah blah :)"


PS: I already have a story for a sequel (more Eldars) in my head and also opening scene for third and last part (Tyranid's full scale invasion).


Cheers :)
