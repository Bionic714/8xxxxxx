,susipus,2013-01-28T17:23Z,"Is some of the latest generation so lazy that they don't bother to use winrar?
Instant gratification is the new norm?
It's about time they learned to be a little patient and grateful for people uploading quality content.
Thanx alot for this upload sceneline!! :-)"
,tpbpolo,2013-01-28T19:32Z,Works fine when unpacked with Winrar. Cannot be unpacked with 7z (reports broken file). 
,Flatulent,2013-01-28T23:32Z,"After being unrarred, plays fine for me."
,uwabaki,2013-01-29T05:17Z,"naming convention would be better as ""s19e01"" in my opinion as I think this is the convention most series use, and previous series of Top Gear on TPB. "
