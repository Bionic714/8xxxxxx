,dash8captain,2013-01-28T01:15Z,Thanks for the effort but this also has the Xs all around the airport. If anyone gets this to work please post here. And I did check the reg entries and all seemed fine there...awesome scenery but those damn Xs suck wolf pussy man.

,dash8captain,2013-01-28T14:24Z,"Attention ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. The issue with this scenery is not in the registry but with a texture file. I have corrected it and will attempt to upload it titled "" FS9 CYUL Fix"". "
