  Rapper Chief Keef was a hit on Chicago's high-school circuit before mixtapes and viral videos led to a contract with Interscope. Keef first hit with 2011's "Bang," an instant hit with the youth of his hometown's South Side. The mixtapes The Glory Road and Bang were both released that year by Keef's label, Glory Boyz, but at the end of 2011, the rapper was arrested for unlawful use of a weapon. In early 2012, Keef was finishing his sentence of house arrest as his track "I Don't Like" was topping a million views on video-sharing sites. It caught the attention of Kanye West, who completed a remix of the track with Big Sean, Pusha T, and Jadakiss all added to the mix.
