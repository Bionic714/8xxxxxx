,cheesemethod,2013-02-03T10:41Z,"I know someone asked on the other link but is there any chance of the 200-101? So many quality tunes missed the 100 cut this year.
Thanks!"
,wolfsh937,2013-02-04T00:37Z,"Lot of songs in there which are 128kbs converted to 320kbs.
Waste of space!! Stop doing that"

Anyone know where there is the 2nd hottest 100?"
,CWC_Cougar,2013-02-05T05:43Z,wolfsh937 I haven't upsampled any of them. If they are upsampled that's how they were when I found them.
