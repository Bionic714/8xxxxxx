Cyndi loses patience while shooting a PSA for her True Colors Fund on a hot day in the city. Meanwhile, David and Declyn hit the golf course.

 Cyndi makes a promise to David that she'll be home for dinner, but keeping her word proves difficult with a busy day ahead of her that includes recording music, posing for publicity photos and choosing the cover art for her memoir.

A big thank you to all original cappers and posters
