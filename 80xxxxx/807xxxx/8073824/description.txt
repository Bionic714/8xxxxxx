There is a spiritual wall that separates those who are truly serving God and those who are bringing carnality into His church. If God is going to be honored in this generation we must begin to rebuild the testimony of Christ in our lives. You may ask yourself how does this happen? How do I begin to rebuild this wall? The first thing we do is apply the truth of God's Word to every area of our life where we are not in agreement with Him. Secondly, we must remove the rubble in our homes that has blocked the door to the prayer closet. Lastly, call our children by example into the work of God. Suddenly there will be a people arise and begin to build according the ways of God and they will do it all for His honor!

A Guiding Voice In The Storm by Carter Conlon:
December 2, 2012 - We are in a place now where we have arrogantly set our course against the ways of God as a people, as a nation. We have a window of opportunity and it will require the whole church, every denomination. It's time to take everything and put it aside and go back to prayer, go back to the will of God. We have to go back to prayer.

A Message for Those Who Have Little Left to Give by Carter Conlon:
November 25, 2012 - Miracles still happen. Cast your bread upon the water and one day it will come back to you. He takes that which is small and multiplies it. God is going to be an endless source of supply to you.
-----------------------------------------------------------

Ambassadors of The Power of God by Carter Conlon:
January 6, 2013 - "Church" as it has been is simply not going to suffice. You and I are going to have to be ambassadors to the power of God to this generation. Casual seeking cannot be the order of the day. It is a self-sacrificing and sincere seeking of God that will make a difference now. This generation is going to have to have an encounter with the Living Christ!
-----------------------------------------------------------

It's Time to Face the Music by Carter Conlon:
December 30, 2012 - Influence does not come because you go to church, it comes because you have the presence of Christ in your life. We do not bend before that which would dull us down to the point where we have no faith and no spiritual mind. For the sake of Christ in this generation, do what is right!
-----------------------------------------------------------

A Sure Way To An Open Heaven by Carter Conlon:
December 16, 2012 - It can be so easy to lock out the needs of others in situations like we are in today. Be passionate to the idea to go to the marginalized, the addicted, the oppressed, the widows, the orphans of this generation those that have nobody to help them. Let the religious sit in their inn and eat their food and warm themselves by their fire and sleep in their beds, you go where the poor are. We will come back to the house of God, we will have a song and we will have something to glorify God for.

Our Three Lives by Ben Crandall:
December 9, 2012 - Every human being is a sinner. There is nobody that has lived a perfect life. You are deciding now what eternity will be for you. Here [on earth] everything is temporal, everything is passing, everything is fleeting. There [eternity] it is permanent. All of life is to prepare for eternity! Live for Him!

THE SIN OF SELF RIGHTEOUSNESS 1&2:

Self-righteousness is the greatest of all sins, because it's pride... the downfall of the Devil!

JESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.

Born of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.
