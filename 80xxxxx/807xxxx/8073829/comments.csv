I have a lower bit rate version of the Flyswatter demo and it's better than the quality on this torrent.  Starting with the song ""Reebok Commercial"" there are little skips and pops throughout the track.

I downloaded this because my own Blink rips are 128kbps.  I don't have the CDs anymore so I was hoping for better quality from a torrent.

I haven't listened to the other albums yet but I can tell you Flyswatter is bad quality.  If you just want the demo in your collection that's fine, but if you want to listen to it you won't enjoy it."
