From Wikipedia:

In 2001, Oliver Queen is revived in a new series, Green Arrow (vol. 3). The 10-issue story arc "Quiver," written by Kevin Smith and illustrated by Phil Hester and Ande Parks, was named as one of 2003's Best Books for Young Adults by the American Library Association's Young Adult Library Service.

Smith left the title after #15, and Brad Meltzer took over as writer. Meltzer's single Green Arrow storyline (#16-21) would continue into the mini-series Green Lantern: Rebirth, and Meltzer went on to write the mini-series Identity Crisis, which heavily featured Green Arrow as one of the story's main characters.

In 2003 with Green Arrow #26, Judd Winick took over as Green Arrow's writer after leaving another DC book, Green Lantern. Winick made many changes. He gained media recognition for issue #43 in which he revealed a character was HIV-positive, and for #45, in which the same character became the most prominent HIV-positive superhero in an ongoing comic book, a decision for which Winick was interviewed by CNN.

In 2006 Andy Diggle's Green Arrow: Year One presented a new official version of his origin. That year also saw the monthly series jump "One Year Later" after the events of Infinite Crisis.

The Green Arrow (vol. 3) series ended with issue #75 in June 2007, concluding with Oliver Queen proposing to Black Canary.
