,MikeyMetal,2013-01-28T04:43Z,"Thanks for this as always Nepotu. I wouldn't mind finding a 1080i version of this game.

All the best to Rondo and his long road back to recovery. We'll miss him!"
,mentallyours,2013-01-28T05:39Z,"Paul Pierce had a triple-double and hit the game-winning jumper with 30 seconds remaining, helping to snap Boston's six-game losing streak with a 100-98 victory over the Miami Heat in double overtime Sunday. The impressive victory and Ray Allen's return to the TD Garden was overshadowed by the news that the Celtics will be without Rajon Rondo, who tore his right ACL, for the remainder of the season. He suffered the injury Friday night in Atlanta. Pierce (17 points, 13 rebounds, 10 assists) and Kevin Garnett (24 points, 11 rebounds) carried the shorthanded Celtics without their All-Star point guard. LeBron James had a game-high 34 points for the visitors, who had their four-game winning streak snapped"
