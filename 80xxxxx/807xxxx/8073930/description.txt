"The Changing of the Guardian"

After surviving a tornado, Marge and Homer 
seek out guardians for the kids, in case the 
worst should happen. They first turn to 
friends and family, including Homer's 
half-brother, Herb Powell with whom to 
entrust their kids, but when Bart and Lisa 
fall in love with a super-cool couple, Mav 
and Portia, Marge starts to question their 
potential guardians' true motivations.
