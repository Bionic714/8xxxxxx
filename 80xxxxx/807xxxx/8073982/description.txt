"Wide World of Cleveland Show 2012"

The Brown-Tubbs family travels the world in a 
hilarious series of internationally-themed 
segments. First, the Stoolbend-based clan is in 
Italy where Cleveland must choose between Rallo 
and Jr. as his familys successor in this mob-
style parody. Then, in Mexico, Junior insists on 
having a Quinceanera, even though hes a boy. 
Next, in Japan, Cleveland builds a robot to 
attend Juniors eating competition when he cant 
be there himself.

Enjoy :)
