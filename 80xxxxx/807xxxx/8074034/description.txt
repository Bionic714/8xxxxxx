For a scene repeatedly declared dead, rock still declines to lie down and be counted out. Scottish trio Biffy Clyro have been around for over a decade, slowly shifting from abstruse metal-flavoured prog punk to sleek arena anthems. Yet apparently poised for a major commercial breakthrough, they have opted to toss all their eggs in one great big basket, concocting that most unwieldy of old school rock formats, the double album.
Opposites presents two sides, 20 tracks and 78 minutes of loud, proud, in-your-face pop rock. I am not quite sure what the title represents because both sides are so much the same as to be virtually indistinguishable. Biffy donΓÇÖt have the swaggering adventurousness of Muse or the arty pretensions of Coldplay but theyΓÇÖve certainly got something. Every song punches its weight in terms of dynamics, energy and melody, adding up to a sleek anthemic rock positioned between the soft centre of Snow Patrol and the dark heart of Nirvana, with an underpinning of Celtic guitar riffing. ItΓÇÖs extremely effective yet there is something punishingly relentless about being hammered with the same blows over and over again. I am really not sure what Biffy hoped to say to listeners over 20 tracks that couldnΓÇÖt have been said more effectively over 10. But then, IΓÇÖm really not sure what Biffy are trying to say at all.
Vocalist, guitarist and principle songwriter Simon Neil hails from the poetic non-sequitur school of lyrics yet is blessed with the kind of raw yet tender voice that can wring improbable drama out of lines like ΓÇ£Where are you at?/ Is it trumpet or tap?/ Are you glued to the wall by this terrible snap?ΓÇ¥ WhatΓÇÖs that all about? Yet somehow Trumpet or Tap is fantastically compelling, with a lean, syncopated verse peppered with cheeky backing vocals surging up to a fuzzy rock singalong chorus.
The album is chock full of this stuff and it is hard not to admire the bandΓÇÖs ambition and chutzpah. The problem is it doesnΓÇÖt leave you longing for more, or pull you back in to savour a favourite moment. If youΓÇÖre already a Biffy Clyro fan, Opposites might be your idea of a masterpiece. If youΓÇÖre new to Biffy, itΓÇÖll just give you a headache
