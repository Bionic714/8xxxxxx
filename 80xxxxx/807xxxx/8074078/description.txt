Kilting Me Softly
By Eric Webb

Indulge me, briefly. ThereΓÇÖs a method to this self-confessional.

IΓÇÖve been a little down lately. IΓÇÖve moved to a different state and back home again in less than a year. My new job is more difficult than I had imagined it would be; sometimes my hands get numb from stress. I work nights and weekends, so feelings of isolation abound. IΓÇÖm living at home for the first time in four years. IΓÇÖm not as close to God as I would like to be. IΓÇÖm in debt. Largely, luxurious problems to have. Waaah. In this post-grad cloud, youΓÇÖll excuse me if I need some brooding music while I wallow in narcissistic self-pity.

In a lackluster week for new releases, the Twilight Sad fit the bill.

Think The Smiths. Think The Cure. Think Joy Division. This Scottish band is dark and ominous and buoyant and swelling in the tradition of some post-punk greats. ΓÇ£No One Can Ever Know,ΓÇ¥ the bandΓÇÖs third release, lives comfortably in that mournful corner of indie rock that Morrissey haunts.

So, while in a personal funk, with the problems of oneΓÇÖs early twenties seeming significant and great and terrible but being perhaps none of those things at all, the Twilight SadΓÇÖs passionate melancholy strikes a nerve. ΓÇ£No One Can Ever KnowΓÇ¥ is never a dirge, always carried by an undercurrent of gravitas. ItΓÇÖs music for navel-gazing dramatics.

ΓÇ£AlphabetΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£Dead CityΓÇ¥ burst open the album from the beginning, until ΓÇ£SickΓÇ¥ turns the dial back a bit and the album settles into a slower burn of simmering menace, not unlike Silversun Pickups or some more downtempo Muse numbers. The air of danger carries through on ΓÇ£DonΓÇÖt Move,ΓÇ¥ which is the sonic equivalent of a heroin needle, with its nervous, risky uneasiness. ΓÇ£Nil,ΓÇ¥ on the other hand, dispenses with unease and plummets into appropriate sounds of, well, nihilism.

ΓÇ£Another Bed,ΓÇ¥ a tale of a lover gone away, takes ΓÇ£No One Can Ever KnowΓÇ¥ back up into more energetic territory and joins ΓÇ£I Will Possess Your HeartΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£Every Breath You TakeΓÇ¥ on my list of fun-obsessive-profoundly-creepy songs. As singer James Graham intones ΓÇ£IΓÇÖll find youΓÇ¥ over and over again, you might look over your shoulder. Warning: This video is disturbing in a horror movie way. Not for the weak stomached.

The Twilight Sad is not merely a cheap Robert Smith imitation. Aesthetically, ΓÇ£No One Can Ever KnowΓÇ¥ asserts the bandΓÇÖs own flavor as much as it draws on its influences. The Internet is full of references to the Twilight SadΓÇÖs ΓÇ£wall of soundΓÇ¥ quality, and it is true that your ears get a great workout (though I donΓÇÖt think Phil Spector would enjoy them too much). There is no ΓÇ£backingΓÇ¥ instrumentation on this album ΓÇö every sound pulls its weight in a musical onslaught at the foreground, though the liberal use of industrial noise does stand out.

What really makes the Twilight Sad special, however, is GrahamΓÇÖs voice. His Scottish brogue is impenetrable at times, but itΓÇÖs the engine that drives this album. A weaker vocalist would get lost in the dark, jagged alleyways of the albumΓÇÖs songs, but GrahamΓÇÖs aggressive, muscular voice carries the threatening sound deftly. At times, a hint of hardcore lingers in his braying.

There are times in your life when you do not want to lift yourself out of your petty doldrums, when sunny pop-punk grates and youΓÇÖve exhausted your tolerance for synths. I want to feel sad sometimes, so that I can get the sad out and make room for being grateful and content. Every now and then, you need a ΓÇ£No One Can Ever Know.ΓÇ¥
