,IAMH67,2013-01-28T08:05Z,"Restart your Torrent client Lonsman, The seeding was done in an hour after this Torrent was uploaded and in my peers list people were getting upto 1.3MBPS in 2 hours with average speeds being 300-700KBPS. 

This is a 200 MB torrent and it didn't take anytime for me to seed and I haven't stopped seeding since I uploaded it."
,archer77,2013-01-28T12:04Z,"IAMH67 - thanks very much for putting this up, it's great to be able to watch this on the other side of the world. 

Do you know whether this will become available in a larger file size with a higher quality video?

Thanks again."
