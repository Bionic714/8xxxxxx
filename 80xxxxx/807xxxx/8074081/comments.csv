,leander3932,2013-01-28T03:08Z,"dear psspss, is it at all possible to get the new episode of long island medium for season 2? thank you much appreciated."
[V],psspss,2013-01-28T03:27Z,"your mixed up.. read the LIM wiki on it..

season 2 aired years ago.. think you mean season 4 and that according to tlc will air in March 2013

suggest you search here for episodes or sounds like you have merged S01 and S02 naming

i recalled the scene cappers mixed it up last season as well to confuse it all"
,leander3932,2013-01-28T04:24Z,"according to TV guide, the new season , 2 new episodes aired on weds. reconnecting, and theresas upgrade. and they will both air again, on jan 30. then, another new on will air feb. 6 @9pm a blessing and a curse. i guess Tv guide screwed up, they also said there was an episode of ghost hunters called holiday spirits, after the home for the holidays episode, so who knows, but i really appreciate all your hard work psspss, and thank you very much."
[V],psspss,2013-01-28T04:56Z,"they may be preseason specials..

well no one has updated tvrage to state they air-ed?

perhaps as someone in usa like k3n and unpopular who might do them"
[V],psspss,2013-01-28T04:56Z,as=ask
[V],psspss,2013-01-28T04:58Z,wasnt reconnecting s01 ep 6? maybe they are re-airs not new ones too?
[V],psspss,2013-01-28T05:00Z,"also upgrade is s01e05.. re-airs by sounds
maybe they follow it with a special before s04 launch

[V],psspss,2013-01-28T05:03Z,"if you google medium blessing and a curse
your see its s01ep7 LOL

beats me I  would have to check my own listings
but they arent new eposides"
[V],psspss,2013-01-28T05:12Z,"here is my listign dump for Long Island.. I suggest you compare to your collection and if missing might be lucky someone is seeding them on TPB (as demonid is gone)

[V],psspss,2013-01-28T10:22Z,"seems tne is saying this is episode 11 after all and my tv guides are wrong lol whatever not just me
confused with it all.. other uploaders also
anyhow can always rename..

===

i checked the unsealed site directly a few tines they never listed a proper episode guide promo some episodes


Im just going by the tv guides from last year.. I did say they
could be wrong too in the header maybe the 2 missing never aired in fact

i say if alien control airs next it would fit with e9
and maybe the new episodes arent airing for alien files one yet
its amazing why no one can produce proper tv guides from usa

must be cable tvs is hiding them only on their channels
and wont allow it published? "
,Rawzor,2013-01-28T13:39Z,"thanks for this episode, so where is ep9 ? since ep11 is available where are the last 2 episodes? are they available ??  anyhow thanks for sharing! :)"
[V],psspss,2013-01-28T14:25Z,"sigh.. read the header.. this is same as so called ep11 theres some confusion of the naming and titles
and the re-airs have been replaced with new episodes in same time slot so we might not get to see.. there might be 2 episodes missing for this and conspiracy series"
[V],psspss,2013-02-04T04:37Z,"turns out this is E11 after all so rename it..

so episode 12 for the new update guide

edit your info.txt and rename the episodes to match"
