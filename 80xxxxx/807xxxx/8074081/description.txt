Looks like the naming of it is gone crazy again some are calling it episode 11?
tvrage is listing rest of the season starts airing tonight calling it E11 so beats
me. I think I stick with the original tv listings and air times and
hope this is still a RE-AIR/REPEAT of the first 10 episodes and hope the new episodes and names happen..
atleast the into now says the title
of course the original tv listings might of been wrong also.. can always rename them
later

ENJOY and seed if grabbing

In a recent poll, roughly 80% of Americans said that 

our government is hiding information regarding the 

existence of alien life. Then why is so little 

attention paid to reports of visitors from above? What 

does the media, and more importantly the government 

have to gain by keeping this information from us?

Since the Roswell "incident", a grass roots movement 

has sprung up worldwide asking these very questions. 

People are demanding that governments release any 

"secret files" regarding alien occurrences and slowly 

nations have responded. So far, 40 countries have 

opened their alien files to public scrutiny, including 

Canada, France, England and Japan. Even the US, long 

known as the stingiest country in terms of releasing 

sensitive documents, has begun to share its alien case 

files.

Unsealed: Alien Files is a ground-breaking new show 

that shines a light on many of these archived alien 

documents. Each week Unsealed will tackle one 

compelling alien case by opening these previously off-

limits secret files. Based on the newly discovered 

information we will re-examine evidence and follow 

developing leads.

Unsealed will investigate mass UFO sightings, personal 

abductions, government cover-ups and breaking alien 

news from around the world. Thanks to advances in 

technology, the computer age has created a new type of 

conspiracy. We will delve into the "photoshopping" of 

space, the value of Wikileaks, and the role social 

media plays in alien stories. Finally, we will examine 

these newly released documents to see how alien 

visitations may have affected our past, and what 

influence they may have on our future.

The show will feature cutting edge graphics, engaging 

music and a fast, energetic style that will appeal to 

both alien experts and novices alike. Unsealed will 

have believers wanting more and skeptics questioning 

their long held beliefs.

Unsealed: Alien Files ... exposing the biggest secret 

on planet Earth.
