The Hobbit is a 1989 three issue comic book series, published by Eclipse Comics. In preparation for the December 2012 release of The Hobbit movie, this new edition of the full-color graphic novel adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's beloved story includes 6 new pages! First published more than sixty years ago, J. R. R. Tolkien's The Hobbit has become one of the best-loved books of all time. The enchanted prelude to The Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit is the story of Bilbo Baggins, a quiet and contented hobbit whose life is turned upside down when he joins the wizard Gandalf and thirteen dwarves on their quest to reclaim stolen treasure. It is a journey fraught with danger - and in the end it is Bilbo Baggins alone who must face the guardian of this treasure, the most dreaded dragon in all Middle-Earth.
