,Lm602,2013-01-29T05:19Z,"I'm from America (I know, I suck. I agree with you. I hate this place) seeding is how we get busted by our isps :/ I would if it was safe. But regardless, I'm incredibly happy UK TG is back. US TG makes me want to jump off of really tall things. The amount of seeders is over 10k now. I dlded in about 15 mins. So stop crying people. "
,SpoogeP,2013-01-29T11:42Z,"Great Episode, although this version seems to have some encoding glitches."
,SpoogeP,2013-01-29T12:09Z,"The ettv version doesn't have the encoding glitches, get that one.

,jmtdjmtd,2013-01-31T20:33Z,luckily dumb people that think it's better for them not to seed are a minority. on the other hand i wish we could get rid of such parasites. (maybe a new torrent protocol that disallows parasite behavior would be nice)
,JisatsuSuru,2013-02-04T04:44Z,@Lm602 download PeerBlock and seed away
,N00DL35,2013-02-06T03:43Z,"@Lm602
