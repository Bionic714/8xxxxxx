Consumed.Season.1.WS.DSR.XviD-CLDD (2011)


Overwhelmed families drowning in their stuff are challenged to survive for 30 days with only the bare essentials in this extreme home experiment.  With their worldly possessions temporarily gone, they have no choice but to confront their relationships with each other as well as the effect of clutter in their lives.  At the end of the experiment the way they see their material possessions, their homes, and each other is through a different lens. But can families who have fallen prey to the allure of a consumer society and who in turn are consumed by their environment, change?
