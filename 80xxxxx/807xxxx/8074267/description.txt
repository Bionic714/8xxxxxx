Encoded all 26 episodes of The Tenchi Muyo GXP series into high quality MKV h.264 format with both English and Japanese audio, and with all of the Subtitles as well.

Finding this series for download was pretty easy actually, but I didnt find one that looked all that great. There were some pretty decent copies out there though.

You can find Tenchi Muyo OVA in my uploads as well
You can find Tenchi Muyo Ryo Ohki in my uploads as well
You can find Tenchi Universe in my uploads as well
You can find Tenchi In Tokyo in my uploads as well

For playback all you need is the proper codec if you dont already have it. 
Combined Community Codec Pack (which I prefer) or the K-Lite Codec pack should give you all you need and more to play these back.

You should be able to hear audio just fine if you have one of the mentioned codec packs above. If you cannot hear any audio and do not want to install a codec pack for some reason, then you do not have and need the nero aac audio codec. As of today it can be found here.
