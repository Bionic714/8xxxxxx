Thanks!!!"
,eriol1,2013-01-28T16:34Z,"Unless I'm mistaken, this one is the 2013 remastered and uncut version, whereas BOZX torrent is from the 2010 Bluray edition. Accordingly it should be another source.

I'm not sure however, if it's truly different or just a marketing coup."

,PTheus,2013-02-26T21:35Z,"English subs are muxed in the container and this excellent release has english audio, besides the original italian. This is the 2013 remastered edition.
I`ve made some corrections on the english subs:

,JMit,2013-04-04T18:30Z,I think italian audio is a bit out of sync.
