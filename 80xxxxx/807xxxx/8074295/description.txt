"Blood Crieth Unto Heaven"

In a tribute to and send-up of the Pulitzer 
Prize-winning play, August: Osage County, a 
dark secret is revealed about the Smith 
familys past when Francine invites Stans 
incarcerated dad, Jack, to Stans birthday 
party. Also in this spoof, Roger plays Edna, 
a maid who nurses Bullock and Hayleys love 
child. But when Edna falls in love with 
Bullock, it could mean dire consequences for 
the kid.
