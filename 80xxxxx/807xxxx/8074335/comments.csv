[V],psspss,2013-01-28T10:45Z,"again im confused..

this is the goldfathers series renamed by lame ukers

however I see theres 8 episodes so does that mean they UK are airing the extra episodes as usa only air-ed 5..

however I dont see episodes 6-7 of gold diggers

or has uk split episodes or numbering also wrong?

perhaps someone can confirm before downloading"
[V],psspss,2013-01-28T10:49Z,"arr i see its a series called diggers a new series not to be confused with the UK rename of gold diggers

also sounds like american diggers lol 

so whats this series about is it any good?"
[V],psspss,2013-01-28T10:57Z,"is it the same show as this as it was canned cos of complants? the episode 1 names dont match
sounds the same.. so does it mean the new ep1 is really ep3? or just renamed to confuse people

[V],psspss,2013-01-28T11:39Z,"http://www.dsmdc.org/2012/12/national-geographic-diggers-tv-show.html

right sorted the show returned and now looks like
have to rename the first 2 episodes before it was pulled since the naming is screwed again"
,datwerd,2013-02-01T02:09Z,"@psspss its my understanding that the ones aired last year were pilot episodes so S00E01 etc
this years season 1 with 8 episodes so far"
