I'll say that I was happy to hear Arnold was returning to the big screen for starring roles once his Governorship was over. Quality was so-so but there is a HD one at stand.blake7.net which worked great for me. Enjoy this entertaining movie!"

Thanks for this Acesn8s but you're better than this crap."
