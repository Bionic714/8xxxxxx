,batmansun,2013-01-28T14:57Z,"Let me start by saying this is a straight-up good guys vs. bad guys, shoot 'em up action movie. Would you expect anything less from Ahhnold? I'll say that I was happy to hear Arnold was returning to the big screen for starring roles once his Governorship was over. Quality was so-so but there is a HD one at stand.blake7.net which worked great for me. Enjoy this entertaining movie!"
,yob09,2013-01-29T03:20Z,"no other better place to get free movies but here in TPB, hoooray to HeroMaster, BiGKATS & all d gud guys of TPB! tnx 2 all of ur ups.

,some-young-guy,2013-01-30T05:13Z,Batmansun your mother should have swallowed you.  You're a fucking spammer and your link is nothing but a scam.  Buy a shotgun and go reverse skeet shooting.
,yob09,2013-01-31T07:56Z,"finally, completed aftr 2 days of dl (only bcoz of poor internet speed here in Phil.). dis is a decent CAM copy at dis early. for my own quality satisfaction i used VLC player to adjust video & audio and it works for me like a DVDSCR copy, though a very few people blocking d screen (but tolerable, same like watching in cinema, lol). seeding now. thanks HeroMaster & BIGKATS for dis great uploads.

v/a=8/10, m=9

never mind those bitchers & whinners, besides they never contribute here in TPB at all

@some-young-guy, I agree with u hahaha"
