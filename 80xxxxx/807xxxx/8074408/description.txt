Before he became The KLFΓÇÖs money-burning dance-punk art-terror-theorist, the erstwhile visionary behind LiverpoolΓÇÖs Zoo label stepped out as an unabashedly Scottish singer-songwriter with this remarkable LP, created to mark his turning 33-and-a-third. Recorded in five days in a village hall in Galloway, The Man was a surprisingly great sounding LP (not so surprising when you realise his backing band is The Triffids), that found Drummond musing on life, love and rockΓÇÖnΓÇÖroll. Its most famous song is undoubtedly ΓÇ£Julian Cope Is DeadΓÇ¥, which saw him recounting his master plan to make The Teardrop Explodes bigger than The Beatles by killing the singer. Elsewhere, there was cosmic country, folk, Roxy-esque sax, Wall Of Sound pop, and a Robert Burns recital by DrummondΓÇÖs preacher father. ΓÇ£The work of a complete nutter,ΓÇ¥ enthused Creation boss Alan McGee.
