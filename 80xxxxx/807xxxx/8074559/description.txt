On this live Sunday, January 27, 2013 edition, Alex Jones breaks down the hypocrisy of the gun grabbers, who, it has emerged, have exempted themselves from their own assault weapons ban. Dianne Feinstein's proposed legislation savagely undermines the 2nd Amendment rights of law abiding Americans, all while placing the Feds and many law enforcement officials above the law. This is the basic tyranny of kings and despots alike throughout history! And Obama, Biden and others are on record promising not to target firearms ownership, telling us they like to shoot guns yet desperately trying to convince the public to accept new control measures over their lives. 

Meanwhile, Alex peaks behind the curtain, exposing the many questions circling the Sandy Hook school shooting massacre. In a special report, he will examine Why People Think Sandy Hook is A Hoax.
