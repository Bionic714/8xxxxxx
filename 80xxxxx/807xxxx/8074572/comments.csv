,Rico1413,2013-01-28T22:14Z,@SCSA420 do u have tlc 2012 720p ??
,MrFredsTV,2013-01-29T02:58Z,Video 8 Audio IS OUT OF SYNC! so not worth the 136gb of seed i did 
[T],SCSA420,2013-01-29T06:39Z,"I'M GOING TO SAY THIS ONE TIME ONLY SO LISTEN UP THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH IT. IF YOU THINK ITS OUTTA SYNC YOU'RE WRONG BECAUSE IT ISN'T. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS THE FOLLOWING: COPY THE 2 .mp4 FILES TO A USB FLASH DRIVE THEN CONNECT THE FLASH DRIVE TO A LG, SAMSUNG, OR PHILIPS BluRay PLAYER (NOT a Sony player because their CINIVIA INFECTED BluRay players SUCK) AND THE FILES PLAY PERFECTLY OR BURN THE 2 .mp4 FILES TO A DVD +R DL DISC OR 2 DVD -R DISCS AND PUT THEM INTO A LG, Samsung, or Philips BluRay PLAYER AND THEY WILL PLAY FINE. ALL OF MY RELEASES ARE LG, Samsung, or Philips BluRay PLAYER COMPATIBLE. I DO NOT STREAM VIDEOS FROM MY PC TO MY PS3 OR XBOX 360 BECAUSE I PREFER BURNING MY RELEASES ONTO DVD -R DISCS OR PUTTING FILES ON A USB FLASH DRIVE THEN PUTTING THE DVD -R DISCS INTO THE MACHINE AND THEY PLAY FINE WITH NO SYNC ISSUES. THIS IS JUST MY 2 CENTS ON THIS MATTER AND THIS IS WHY I NEVER HAVE PROBLEMS PLAYING BACK THE VIDEOS I UPLOAD HERE."
,khaleelrs,2013-01-29T15:14Z,ty for the torrent. i just finished downloading it. seeding at 1.5mb/s and alredy uploaded over 9 gig

,wrestlingnut2012,2013-01-30T00:49Z,"Hi,
I download your WWE Main Event rips every week and they always work perfect for me so nothing is out of sync. I just wanted to ask which WWE and TNA ppvs do you upload on a regular basis? do you just upload the big 4 WWE ppvs and the big 3 TNA ppvs? because I believe this is the first ppv you uploaded since TNA Bound For Glory. Thanks for your hard work."
[T],SCSA420,2013-01-30T04:31Z,@Sovikos Do the world a favor and just STFU because there is NOTHING wrong with it here on my 3 PC's and 3 BluRay players
,ragsy84,2013-01-31T00:54Z,"SCSA, if you have to use a flash drive with weird TV models, or burn a DVD, your shit is broken.

Let me slow that down for you, since you're apparently retarded.

YOUR. SHIT. IS. BROKEN."
,Sovikos,2013-01-31T18:14Z,"Sorry dude, if more then 1 person says your shit is Out of Sync, then there's a problem!  Look into it!"
[T],SCSA420,2013-01-31T20:03Z,"@ragsy84  just STFU, as far as my 55 inch 240Hz LG 3D LED Smart Tv and 4 BluRay players and 2 custom built Core I7 gaming PC's and a Asus Core I7 laptop I have here is concerned which all play my releases perfectly then I know my equipment is superior to anything your candy ass may have LOSER. Thousands of people have downloaded this show by now and out of all that there are maybe 4 or 5 people whining about it like you are. Guess what moron your equipment is shit just like your opinion is. "
