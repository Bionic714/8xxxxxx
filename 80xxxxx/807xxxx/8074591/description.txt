The Year is 2139. The Planet Earth has changed into a virtually
uninhabitable place called the "Cursed Earth". All of the Earth's
population have crowded into the cities across the planet, now known
as "Mega Cities". The crimes in these "Mega cities" became so violent
and so powerful, that the regular justice system was powerless to contain,
then it collapsed completely. But, a new Justice System came from the ashes,
They were 3 justice systems in 1 (Police, Jury and executioner), they were
called "Judges". In Mega City 1 (formarly, New York), There was a Judge,
named Joseph Dredd, who was the toughest and most stringent Judge in history.
One day, he was charged with murder. He was tried and sentenced to life
in prison because of it. Then, Dredd found out that it was in fact
a person who shares his DNA. Former Judge Rico. Now, Dredd has to find
out what Rico is planning to do, and to discover about his past.
