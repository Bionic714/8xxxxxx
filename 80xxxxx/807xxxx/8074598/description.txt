The Women of SNL features a showcase of the incredibly talented women who have created some of the funniest and most memorable characters on Saturday Night Live throughout its rich history. Beginning with a Real Housewives parody, host Andy Cohen invites some of the women of SNL back to studio 8H for a comically charged reunion show with an honest "Housewives-style" tell-all that lets us know what they've been up to since being featured on Saturday Night Live. Then take a look back at some classic sketches such as Debbie Downer, Mary Katherine Gallagher, The Lawrence Welk Show, Oprah, Bronx Beat, and the Nerds. You'll also enjoy backstage stories and some of your favorite impressions that can only be seen here, including ones from the women who began it all, Gilda Radner, Laraine Newman and Jane Curtin.
