Encoded The Movie Pokemon Heroes and the short that comes with it called Camp Pikachu into MKV h.264 format with English and French Audio and English selectable subtitles.
 
Finding this movie was kinda easy but it was hard finding it with DVD like quality and the quality of others was driving me nuts so I decided to make a higher quality version out of the DVD.
 
For playback all you need is the proper codec if you dont already have it. 
Combined Community Codec Pack (which I prefer) or the K-Lite Codec pack should give you all you need and more to play these back.
 
You should be able to hear audio just fine if you have one of the mentioned codec packs above. If you cannot hear any audio and do not want to install a codec pack for some reason, then you do not have and need the nero aac audio codec. As of today it can be found here.
