Kenya and Phaedra work on their dueling workout videos, but Kenya gets fired up when she hears Phaedra has been stirring up things about her. Cynthia continues to build her agency, adding a kid pageant to her roster while NeNe is learning that it is harder to stay at the top then it is to get there. Porsha gets caught in the crossfire when Kenya goes on a rampage with Phaedra as enemy number one.
