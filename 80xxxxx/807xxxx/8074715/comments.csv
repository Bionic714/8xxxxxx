Santino Marellas won the rumble, and Rock got call from the Walt Disney Company about his upcoming new film ""Fabulous Garden Fairy"" right in the middle of the match, so he had to forfeit and leave immediately. Sucks. Sorry, spoiler alert!"

,Subtracting,2013-01-29T01:56Z,i dont get why people like watching fake fights theres a reason why this shit is on the SCI FI CHANNEL
,obvious2me,2013-01-29T06:47Z,"@danawhite    I refuse to believe there are people dumb enough to dl an entire torrent without viewing the files being downloaded.

@karusuman   Go fuck yourself.

@subtracting   It's just some mildly violent entertainment. Mostly fake and scripted, but still entertaining."

,brewerchch,2013-01-30T05:01Z,"FAKE!
the wrassling not the torrent"
,bigtaterman,2013-01-30T17:38Z,"@ brewerchch, not fake, scripted. I guess you don't watch movies or TV shows either, because those are technically ""fake""too."
,wildy63,2013-01-30T21:35Z,"@djwaffle87 - stop crying...WMP, or VLC player both play .mkv files..."

,Tuckle,2013-02-04T16:39Z,"@Djwaffle87:  You really need to get with the times.  Avi files have been ""old news"" for at least 12 months.  Pretty much all videos are now x264, either as a .mkv file or a .mp4.  The only files still being uploaded as .avi are to cater to those who have not (or are incapable of) upgraded their software in 3 years.  VLC, Windows Media Player and Media Player Classic will run all file formats.  Aside from the fact that the x264 format provides higher quality for a smaller size, there is no reason for .avi files to exist anymore, save for those few who have lived under rocks for the last few years.
