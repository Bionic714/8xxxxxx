[V],psspss,2013-01-28T10:58Z,"is it the same show as this as it was canned cos of complants? the episode 1 names dont match
sounds the same.. so does it mean the new ep1 is really ep3? or just renamed to confuse people
maybe the 2 episode were treated as a pilot now?

[V],psspss,2013-01-28T11:40Z,"http://www.dsmdc.org/2012/12/national-geographic-diggers-tv-show.html

right sorted the show returned and now looks like
have to rename the first 2 episodes before it was pulled since the naming is screwed again

I will see if I can get the new episodes and make xvids as no one is seeding afgs ones and 720ps and stupid :) I will bundle it tomorrow I guess"
