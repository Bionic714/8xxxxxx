This is the latest version of Bebe's outstanding collection of PDFs, etc., of JK Rowling's Harry Potter books. It was originally shared on Demonoid around July 2012.

Since Demonoid has long been offline, I'm not sure if there are any new additions, but I'm sure there have been further corrections. Below is the description for v3 ... previously available @ http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7043343
