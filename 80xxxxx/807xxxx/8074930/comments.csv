Any chance for the 1.3 version?"
,jontis,2013-02-18T13:54Z,How do I use them?

,Spirsd12,2013-03-07T20:01Z,These presets are not working with my pirated version of Lightroom 4.  I've tried installing and re-installing many times but each time it gives me the same error.  They also wiped out all of my previous presets.  Do not download!!!
,statustray,2013-03-09T15:05Z,"Not sure why that is Spirsd12,

They worked perfectly for me with no issues whatsoever.

I followed the instructions at:

http://www.slrlounge.com/the-lr4-preset-system-how-to-install-the-lightroom-4-preset-system

There's no viruses or anything within this set.  My suspicion is that there was some sort of bad download, or a faulty install of the preset itself.

Please have a look at the video link above and that should help."

,Vladra10,2013-03-14T09:47Z,Spirsd12 is right.  These wipe your previous presets and there is likely malware contained in this torrent.  Though I download a lot and it could be from somewhere else as well 
,Se3DeR101,2013-03-14T20:41Z,see my post..it works on me...something wrong with your process Spirsd12.
