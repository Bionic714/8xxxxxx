 If you have watched the T.V. show Serial Experiments Lain than you probly heard the song "Duvet" (the opening song). Well This CD has THREE VERSIONS! Also the cd has two extra songs Two Steps and Little Miss both are great songs but I prefer Duvet. This CD is great to lissen to or a great piece to add to a collection.
