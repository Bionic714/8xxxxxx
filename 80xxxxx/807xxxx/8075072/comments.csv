,brock1384,2013-01-30T01:14Z,"After completing disc1 campaign, it wont continue to disc2 on rgh. Even if you exit out of game and go straight to disc2 it wont start from the end of disc1. I think its cause this has automatic saves."
,brock1384,2013-01-30T01:16Z,Btw this game is truly amazing. Im still gonna buy a retail copy on day 1.
,rishi82in,2013-01-30T17:46Z,"anybody if they can explain me how to play 2 disc games on rgh, i have xex & when converted to god format i have got dvd 1 & DVD 2 with game code"

,samengo,2013-02-04T18:25Z,Is German aviable too?
,beckkeong,2013-02-05T17:37Z,Why does it say that the file is too big ? i used imgburn and clonecd .. both tell me that it overuns by 200 over mb ?
,beckkeong,2013-02-05T17:47Z,how do i burn dead space 3 ? i keep getting a message using img burn that the game over runs .. i try the disk and manage to install it but i keep getting a fail to authorise error
,skymiah,2013-02-05T18:03Z,"You need a DVD burner with BurnerMax Tech. An IHAS Ver.B (NOT-C) Look on Amazon or E-bay. After you get one, it doesn't run in TRUNCATED mode because it reads the discs as 8.03 gigs I believe bigger than normal to write all the information down."
,beckkeong,2013-02-05T18:27Z,so basically this game would be useless to me if i dont have that drive ? how is it possible that i am able to install the disc ? the problem now is that i keep getting a unable to verify disk errror in the game
,beckkeong,2013-02-05T18:31Z,"so basically this game is uselss if i dont have the drive ?  i can install the game to 100 percent
but i keep getting a ""unable to verify disk"" error"
,Revoion,2013-02-05T18:33Z,Works perfect..Thx ;)
,beckkeong,2013-02-05T18:51Z,how u got it to work?
,Iwannaweld,2013-02-05T19:41Z,"The game works fine. 
1.Use verbatim dvd-dl disk
2.Always use a i-Has B Burner (Yes sometimes you can truncate the game but then you will have the unable to verify message because only 97% of the game information was actually burnt to your disc, Because you truncated it. The drive is only $30-$40 just buy it! Ebay is the best cause most already have burnermax software installed.
3.Run through abgx (if all green, then burn at 2.4x)
4. Enjoy the game"
,Rocket_Man_31,2013-02-05T20:14Z,"@Panagiotis_1992,  Yes, DS3 works with 2.0 truncate mode. I'm on the first disk now,but I'm downloading disk 2, too. The game is awsome ;)"
,Rocket_Man_31,2013-02-05T20:29Z,"...and always inject 2.0 topology file before you  burn it. Like I sad, the game is awesome!!!"
,dudelove420,2013-02-06T00:42Z,"Everything passed when ran through abgx, but it was telling me there is no verified rip of  xex crc in the online database."
,dudelove420,2013-02-06T00:45Z,"Oh and people you do not need an Ihas burner anymore. Check and see if your dvd drive is compatible with a program call burnermax payload, all you do is send the signal and it will tell you if yours is compatible. My Sony was compatible, but I already went out and got an Asus drive and flashed it over to ihas 524b. Remember if you want to still get a ihas burner that you can always crossflash a b chip model drive."
,beckkeong,2013-02-06T03:55Z,"I finally managed to get this to work using BurnerMAX payload Tool V0.15 

Find it from here http://www.ixtreme.net/ixtreme-lt-lite-touch-download/33961-c4e%92s-burnermax-payload-tool-v0-15-a.html 

follow noob guide

thank dudelove420

STFU all u idiots who were unhelpful and keep saying you need a new drive to burn this game."
,samljer,2013-02-06T19:27Z,"@beckkeong
u deaf? you cant
to write the whole disk you need iMax
its a hacked firmware for PC Drives
to overburn the new XBOX format disks."
,Smallz94,2013-02-06T20:09Z,"So I downloaded this last week and already  burned it couple days ago and I just realized that just today or yesterday, abgx360 just verified the game and I did the process through that program except it shows the yellow words saying it is not verify yet. CAN I STILL PLAY THE GAME EVEN THOUGH IT IS NOT FULLY VERIFY??? I DONT WANT TO WASTE ANY MORE DISKS!!!!!!!!!!!"
,beckkeong,2013-02-06T21:22Z,"@samljer

thats why ur an idiot cos i did that and it works and im playing the game. The method i posted works. So STFU u stupid cunt

@Smallz94 

it works .. i ran it through the program and verification issues came up also but the game works for me"
,Smallz94,2013-02-07T00:36Z,Thanks pal 
,dudelove420,2013-02-07T07:13Z,@samljer this is the new release for the burnermax firmware. now it is a program that allows you to burn on more drives.
,box_77,2013-02-08T01:29Z,"LT2.0 xbox fat, topo 2.0 injected with xbc and burned with truncate method using imgburn,memorex DL and a normal laptop : 
first i got an error message and xbox didnt even recognise the disk (doesnt even shows the disk cover when in dashboard, first time i got this with a xgd3 game!). i said wtf!! then played 5-10 min with farcry3 (already installed in my hdd,and using the mp3 trick as usual), stopped the game, tried DS3 again, then it worked! 
i turned off xbox, then put DS3 again, disk error. 
so i think we have now a new process to start a xgd3 game, and may be the next new coming games? has any body with LT2.0 could start it without playing another game before??"
,box_77,2013-02-08T01:31Z,"by the way, i was just talking about dvd1. i have not burned dvd2 yet."

,Smallz94,2013-02-10T05:49Z,Make sure you turn off or close everything meaning disconnect Internet and close windows that doesn't interrupts the process of writing disc or burning the game. That happens to me all the time and I end up wasting a disc 
,Smallz94,2013-02-10T19:54Z,Can I play online even though its not fully verified? 
,dudelove420,2013-02-11T03:42Z,here is a good tutorial on how to burn memorex discs (Ritek) to play at 2.4 speed. Or if you want to use burnermax payload and cheap discs make sure you follow the tutorial for switching img settings. It should work but you won't get the 2.4 write speed like the benefits of a ihas offers with mediacodespeededit: http://forums.afterdawn.com/t.cfm/f-152/xgd3_pc_burner_max_memorex_a_cheap_media_tutorial-914320/

I burnt Dead Space 3 Disc 1 using Imgburn and Burnermax and in the first loading screen the ''this disc is unreadable'' error pops out.
What is the right way to burn this?
I used to burn XGD3 games with truncate and they worked.
I tried this one with truncate as well as with burnermax but same thing happens. "
,pulh4,2013-02-28T03:49Z,"IMA TEACH U WHINY BITCHAS HOW TO PLAY XGD3 WITH TRUNCATE METHOD  WITHOUT ANY NEED TO BUY AN  IHAS  BURNER BULLSHIT.
1- USE IMGBURN AND BURN THE DISC AT 2,4X SPEED USING TRUNCATE METHOD AND ALWAYS USE GOOD QUALITY DVDS, VERBATIM RECOMENDED
2- GET AN MP3 FILE INTO UR XBOX, USE A USB STICK OR WATEVER, AND BEFORE LAUNCHING THE GAME PLAY THE FILE USING THE XBOX PLAYER
3- LAUNCH THE GAME , NEXT START THE GAME, NEXT PAUSE THE GAME, NEXT STOP THE MP3  FILE AND FINNALY GO BACK TO THE GAME 
AGAIN.
4- PLAY THE FUKIN GAME TILL UR CONSOLE EXPLODES WITHOUT NO MORE DISC UNRECONAZIBLE ERROR.
IT IS RECOMENDED TO INSTALL THE GAME TO THE HARDDRIVE.
U WELCOME"
,cojumdip,2013-03-28T21:25Z,"Works...fine for me. Burned with Verbatim on my flashed iHAS 124 B. HOWEVER, I beat the game and received NO ACHIEVEMENTS. Is anyone else having this problem?
