Danny Gatton's album Unfinished Business rated #10 of the Top 100 albums of the 80s by Guitar World Magazine. On that album, he uses six different Fender and Gibson guitars and amps of 1963 vintage and earlier. The material is very diverse. Included is the Les Paul tribute "Cherokee," an eerie version of the Jackie Gleason theme "Melancholy Serenade" and an intricate construction around the Santo and Johnny standard "Sleepwalk," this album deserves the accolades it has received.
