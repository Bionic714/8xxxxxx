,candyspaceship,2013-02-04T20:32Z,"do you have any information about season 24? if you have, please share it with me :)"
,zed1234,2013-02-05T01:48Z,"The only stuff that I know is that availability calls have already been made and that the actual invitations are probably being made right now. I follow this forums alnd blogs:

Just to shorten it for you: Speculation is on and it is thought that filming is probably going to start around mid February and broadcasting will occur only after season 28 of the real world. Unfortunatly this means that 2013 is going to be similar to 2011 in terms of the number of challenges, only 1 :("
,candyspaceship,2013-02-06T20:33Z,thank you very much ;))
,candyspaceship,2013-02-06T20:36Z,"it actually says on Wikipedia that RW Portland is going to air in early 2013 so maybe there will be 2 challenges this year (I HOPE SO!!!)

and I actually got information for the show:
""The next challange just started and it's going back to real world vs roads but this time it's real world vs road rules s fresh meat and the cast is. Real world team is Wes, ct, Johnny, Ty, tyrie,landon Emily, Sarah, jenn, Paula Brittney, and aneesa RR team is Derek, Darrel, Abe, Dan, mark,﻿ Adam ,Veronica, Katie, ibis, Rachel , Susie, and Tina (comes back) and fresh meat is Kenny, Evan, ryan , nore, Pete, Brandon, Evelyn, laurel, cara Marie, Camilla , aviv, and diem... It's gonna be good"""
,zed1234,2013-02-07T01:57Z,"Regarding the new RW season starting in early 2013, probably around mid March after Washington Heights ends, doesn't mean two challenges. It probably means two RW seasons because MTV does one season of RW then one of The Challenge and then again RW.

Can you please tell me where have you read or seen that cast information? I would really want to read more about that. That concept is has been much wanted by fans ever since Cutthroat. When you say Derek did you meant Derick Kosinski? 

I'm not trying to diasgree with you but I think that this cast has some errors because, for example, Veronica just had a baby so is difficult for her to be on the next challenge and I think that Ibis and Susie are done with this.

Sorry for the foot long reply ;)"
,zed1234,2013-02-07T02:00Z,"I just found that on youtube. That's where you have seen it right? That info, I believe, is not very reliable unfortunatly. If you start following vevmo.com or http://realitytvforum.ucoz.com/forum/2 you will see why I'm telling you this."
,candyspaceship,2013-02-07T20:47Z,"I just told you because I found that on Youtube and copied that for you :))
I would like for that to happen because I love most of the competitors which names are written there, FRESH MEAT WOULD KILL THOSE 2 TEAMS!"
,zed1234,2013-02-08T00:57Z,"Yes I also think that a Fresh Meat team would beat them all, but don't forget that Road Rules also have a lot of good challengers. 

Have you seen the latest mtv poll? Check it here: http://remotecontrol.mtv.com/2013/02/06/new-challenge-season-cast-vote

Also this makes impossible for the challenge to be already filming."
,candyspaceship,2013-02-09T22:05Z,"I saw that, but I don't really think that they will follow that poll, they already know who's gonna be in the next challenge, I THINK."
,zed1234,2013-02-10T01:46Z,"Yeah I believe that too. Usually these blog things on MTV's website are not the most accurate thing in the world :p

I think that this poll is just to make some noise and brinh some attention to the next Challenge season and also to the next RW season. Have you seen the number of comments? People are really in to it."
,candyspaceship,2013-02-11T11:03Z,"I've seen it, it's actually kinda funny that people really believe that their votes will change something hahaha. And thank you for this torrent, I've finished downloading 2 days ago (I forgot to say that)."
,zed1234,2013-02-11T11:37Z,"Yes that is really amuzing.
That's ok ;) I haven't upload Cutthroat because I've been a little short on free time. I will as soon as I can."
,candyspaceship,2013-02-12T22:22Z,"ok, thanks ;)
And I love seeing that Laurel and CT are leading the poll. I hope for this people to be on the next challenge:
GIRLS: Laurel, KellyAnne, Cara Maria, Evelyn, Sarah
BOYS: CT, Chet, Dustin, Kenny, Wes"
,zed1234,2013-02-13T01:45Z,Yes me too! That would me a great cast. I would also add Evan and Devyn for the absolutly great side comments they say hahaha
,candyspaceship,2013-02-13T12:15Z,"Evan is ok, too, but I like this 5 guys more than him. I I would to add one more, it would probably be him.
I love Devyn, but I was kinda pissed that Brooklyn was 3rd because od her, they would've won if she wasn't on their team :/"
,zed1234,2013-02-14T01:49Z,"I know what you mean. If it wasn't for Devyn Brooklin would probably won. Sarah as become a great competitor, JD was in shape and Chet I feel is underrated player because he can really perform really well."
,candyspaceship,2013-02-15T20:47Z,"I totally agree, I love Chet, he's so cool. But Devyn wasn't really in shape so that's why they lost."
