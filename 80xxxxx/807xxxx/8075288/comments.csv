I ripped this from the HD MP4 download of the YouTube video because it wasn't available on iTunes yet at the time. I'm not sure if the iTunes custom start and stop times are embedded in the metadata, but I have it set to start at 0:11 and end at like 9:26 because the music video has a title and credits in silence surrounding the actual track."
