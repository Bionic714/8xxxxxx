River Monsters: Series 1
Extreme angler, Jeremy Wade, is on the hunt for freshwater fish with a taste for human flesh. This rip-roaring ride through the dark side of nature mixes action and adventure with mysteries, edge of the seat chase and a battle of wills between man and almost supernatural beasts. These killers lurk in the serpentine waterways of the planet, mooching murderously underwater, growing to truly awesome sizes. Like all the best horror movies the images are intense and immediate, the grade is gritty and real, together heightening the drama on screen. With graphics overlaying the live action, Jeremy illustrates to the viewer, using forensic methods, exactly how these river monsters are constructed to kill.




3)  European Man Eater 
Biologist and extreme angler Jeremy Wade travels to Germany to investigate tales of a beast that has been on the prowl in European waters for the past 700 years. His investigations take him to Spain, where he discovers first-hand that as a consequence of a science experiment gone wrong, the Wels catfish is growing to man-eating proportions and is capable of everything depicted in medieval records.
