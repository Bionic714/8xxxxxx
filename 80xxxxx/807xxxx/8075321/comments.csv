,Ashaar,2013-01-28T13:49Z,"Take it easy, mate. Open mind is the salvation and ignorance is bliss, nothing is definite in the this world yet so perfect, take a good hard look around you, Is it an evolution, can evolution be that perfect, nope. Well it's up to ones own opinion, right."
,ZoPunde,2013-01-28T15:15Z,nope
,pusslicker,2013-01-28T16:01Z,"I thought Christians weren't supposed to steal shit. I wonder how Geisler and Brooks feel about your ""contribution"". Who says evolution is perfect? Who created God? That must be one badass god. Between you and the muslim twats on here I have to weed through a bunch of religious spam. "
,pusslicker,2013-01-28T16:02Z,Fucking religious cunts invading the last bastion of intellectual freedom here at the PB.
[T],pharmakate,2013-01-28T17:16Z,"@pusslicker - if you want your intellectual freedom, better stay on the porn pages."
,g4rb4g3,2013-01-28T17:47Z,"@pusslicker Look, just because you don't believe in anything doesn't give you a license to wave your immaturity around like a retard. You're making atheists look bad, let alone yourself. I mean unless you have tourettes syndrome or something and can't help it then I guess it's my job to pray for you. :P"
,bonzofan,2013-01-28T18:56Z,"@ Ashaar.  I agree we should keep an open mind, just not so open that your brain falls out! Evolution may not be perfect (it doesn't need to be, just good enough to survive) but take an objective look around you and neither is the world.
I believe that there are no gods. If I'm wrong, then they are certainly not deserving of our worship.
Oh, and a question your book probably misses out; explain the Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve. (Google it, fellow atheists !) "
,spazz69,2013-01-28T19:09Z,"Wrong question. The right questions are, do any gods exist; and if so, how many; and how can we tell? Deities are just so hard to count accurately. Genesis begins (in Hebrew) with Elohim (gods, plural) not El (god, singular), giving: In the beginning, gods created heavens and earth. So, more than one god was involved -- but how many, and which? Is a puzzlement..."
,Ashaar,2013-01-28T20:14Z,"Actually the better word is creator not God or gods because these words can be misinterpreted because everything needs a creator and when something is created it should be looked after otherwise it will break and our ecosystem has been here for thousands of years but again everybody has the right to decide and best judge of his own opinion, wait, have a open mind nothing is final."
,nedand,2013-01-30T18:12Z,Thanks a lot!
,brianxxx,2013-02-01T16:24Z,"As an atheist...I welcome his freedom of religion. Everything and anything is what TPB is all about. 

And I would hope that Ashaar and others like him will take that message back to their fold and remind them to keep their noses out of my beliefs and freedoms and stop forcing their beliefs down my throat.

I am pro choice. Leave me be. No one is forcing you to get abortions.

I am pro gay marriage. Leave me be. No one is forcing you to be gay or to get married.

I could go on but I think the point is made. 

Freedom for all, judgment by none!"
,Ashaar,2013-02-04T00:04Z,"I agree but the question is, what's the point of, living, life, struggle, survive, love, hate, sacrifice, good and evil, if nothing's to be judged."
,B0b_D0le,2013-03-27T05:25Z,"lol, you guys aren't even aware that most of the religious spamming isn't done by religious people, it's done by trolls who are anti-religion to try to make religious people look bad.

Also, most of the people who posted on this torrent are trolls since they want to argue a topic instead of focusing on it being just another data file.

Oh, BrianXXX, you don't really want to be left alone or else you'd not have told us things about you that are none of our business."
