Ep 9: Hard For Me To Say I'm Sorry
 Reza orchestrates a sitdown with GG to see if she'll be banished from the group forever.
 PREMIERE: Sunday January 27, 9 pm

MJ has a breakdown at lunch with her mother and finally asks her to go to therapy with her. Lilly is shocked when a friend tells her that perhaps Ali won't marry her because her bikini business is not a "respectable" job for a Persian wife. Reza works behind-the-scenes to get everyone to sit down with GG so they can decide once and for all whether to officially "file for divorce" or mend the fences with her.
