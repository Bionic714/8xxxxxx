Hallmark-The Makeover (2013)

Air Date: 27 Jan 2013

Summary: Hannah Higgins (Julia Stiles) is a smart, driven education consultant. She's so driven she runs for Congress to advance the cause of education reform. Hannah's not a likable candidate, though; her elitism turns off Boston voters, big-time.
 
Hannah and her business partner, Colleen Pickering (Camryn Manheim) don't give up easily. Next election, they recruit a candidate ΓÇô beer vendor Elliot Doolittle (David Walton) ΓÇô who definitely is a man-of-the-people. His mother Allie (Frances Fisher) is the definition of "piece of work," as is his sister Allie (Georgia Lyman).
 
Elliot ΓÇô whose thick South Boston accent masks considerable intelligence ΓÇô is the polar opposite of prim-and-proper Hannah.
 
Hannah takes Elliot on as a "project." Pygmalion-like (modern day), if she can just teach him to speak like gentleman, dress like a gentleman, comport himself like a gentleman .. why he might become a gentleman, a gentleman who can run for Congress ΓÇô and win. Elliot and Hannah are about as oil-and-water as two people can be. But as Elliot becomes more "presentable" and Hannah becomes less "proper," could this be a match made in electoral Heaven?
