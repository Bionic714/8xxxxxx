This file should remove those horrible Xs in that awesome scenery of FS9 CYUL by Flytampa.

Just download and install the file into (Addon SceneryFlyTampa-MontrealTexture).

I left out the front part of the Drive i.e "C", "E" etc as everyone is different. 

You should know where your drive resides. I hope this works for you guys so let me know.
