[V],promodsharma,2013-01-28T14:44Z,This torrent also contains PaintTool SAI (English) V 1.10 - Portable (Cracked) - 4.67 MB.
,mizar,2013-01-28T16:25Z,"Looks interesting, thank you!"
[V],promodsharma,2013-01-28T20:55Z,"You are welcome - ""mizar ""  ^_^"
,LunarisDream,2013-02-01T05:23Z,"Nooooooooooooooo this is for CS4 and there are so many differences between CS4 and CS5, which is what I have.

Worst upload ever for getting my hopes up only to download an obsolete product.

/sarcasm

Thanks for the up man. I'm learning new stuff already! Everything's great and virus-free."
[V],promodsharma,2013-02-03T14:16Z,"@'LunarisDream' - Thanks for the feedback. I have mentioned in the description box that this book takes PS CS 4 as the base.What this essentially means is that all the description and explanations in the book are valid for PSCS 6 as far as all the  commands are concerned which are incoporated in PS CS 6 from PS CS 4. Obviously the new commands and features which did not exist in PS CS 4 will obviously not be covered. Anyway, I am sorry for your waste of bandwidth and time."
[V],TorDigger,2013-02-03T15:28Z,"Great stuff, Thanks"
[V],promodsharma,2013-02-03T17:46Z,Hi 'TorDigger ' - ^_^
,melros1,2013-02-04T12:12Z,I agree with LumarisDream. CS6 is available for anyone to download of tpb. I use CS6 which is so far advanced from CS4 this torrent is useless. Get with the scene promodsharma - upload new tutorials if you want to make useful contribution to tpb.
[V],promodsharma,2013-02-04T14:51Z,"@'melros1' and others with similar attitudes - TPB is a forum where an uploader,   uploads torrents which may be useful to a wide spectrum of users. Being with the ""scene"" does not necessarily mean ignoring users who are still using a lower version of a software because they cannot afford the latest machines to run the latest versions of softwares.  Those who fail to read the clear description cannot hold the uploader responsible for their mistakes."
,melros1,2013-02-05T14:12Z,"Quite right. However CS6 supports XP. For anyone wishing to upgrade to CS6 I recommend ""the thingy"" torrent on tpb, and installation instructions are available on youtube. You will love it!!!"
,melros1,2013-02-05T15:04Z,"To continue - if you need help downloading and  installing CS6, respond to this comment for assistance - then you WILL be able to get with the ""SCENE"" and not need this antiquated book."
[V],promodsharma,2013-02-05T18:27Z,@'melros1' - Come on ! Come on ! Be a good brat and stop creating a scene !
,melros1,2013-02-05T23:24Z,"Love to promodsharma - just upload something worthwhile - like say ""Total Training Photoshop CS6 Extended Essentials"" and I'll happily withdraw all comments."
[V],promodsharma,2013-02-06T02:54Z,"@'melros1' - You would have probably heard of Suprabay ? This site has been specially hosted for members like you. There you can rant, cry, complain, moan, scream, smile, boast, laugh, request, threaten, create a scene.... etc. Your requests should be posted there.

https://forum.suprbay.org

by the way 'thethingy' does need a promotional or Introduction comment from you. He is a legend on TPB. His torrent on PS CS6 is self explanatory and does not need a visit to youtube for instructions. 

For all TPB members who are curious about thethingy torrents - visit - 

http://thepiratebay.sx/user/thethingy 

I would love to see you upload, say - Photoshop CS 6 or if it is very tough, some itsy - bitsy 50 kb torrent, perhaps ?"
,melros1,2013-02-06T03:42Z,promodsharma - you have me there I admit. But not contributing at all is a major improvement on the 3 pages of (mostly) outdated rubbish you have uploaded.
,melros1,2013-02-06T04:19Z,"promodsharma. Sorry, I genuinely apologize for my comments, in particular the last one. You are providing a useful service to many people. I have worked with PS since CS2 through to CS6. Regardless of that I can assure you I will take advantage of any torrent you upload in the future which is useful to me. Hopefully we can ""bury the hatchet""???"
[V],promodsharma,2013-02-06T05:08Z,"@'melros1' - ""3 pages of (mostly) outdated rubbish you have uploaded. "" ? 98,586 downloaders who downloaded the  the 3 pages of 'trash' and 'rubbish' and found it useful, did not think so . Or are you wiser ? I upload for the joy of sharing, whether you download it or not is immaterial.
"
,melros1,2013-02-06T13:59Z,Dream on.
[V],promodsharma,2013-02-06T16:52Z,@'melros1' - Scream on.
[V],promodsharma,2013-02-07T04:04Z,"melros1 - I regret making the last comment, please overlook it. I should not have argued with an advanced user of Photoshop (CS2 through CS6) like you. I assure you that in any future upload I will be linking back to this page, in your honor."
[V],promodsharma,2013-02-07T09:46Z,"melros1 - As promised I have given you an honorable mention in my next upload ( and will do so , as an example of comment spammer in my future uploads)

,melros1,2013-02-07T10:33Z,promodsharma  Much appreciated. Hopefully our history will be read in advance to avoid downloaders wasting their time on your torrents.
[V],promodsharma,2013-02-07T14:04Z,melros1 - 450 + Downloaders who have downloaded this torrent ( 75 Seeders as of writing this comment) do justify your rantings.
[V],promodsharma,2013-02-07T14:09Z,melros1 - - 450+ downloaders who downloaded this torrent and 75 seeders (at the time of writing this comment) justify your rantings.
,melros1,2013-02-07T14:56Z,"Hi Promodsharma, After your last comment I thought perhaps I was missing something so I have downloaded your latest offering. Nothing new in it for me. At the time of our initial contact I was looking for new CS6 tutorials for the local grammar school students interested in graphic design who I bring into the office for work experience with PS. Clearly we are never going to see eye to eye, and I can assure you it is not my usual form to be engaged in this type of exchange nor do I desire to continue it. This started as a general comment and has degenerated into stupidity. I have one only other comment on tpb and that is to compliment the uploader on the quality of his torrent. Once again I offer an olive branch - lets call it a day and go our separate ways."
[V],promodsharma,2013-02-07T15:28Z,melros1 - You seem to be suffering from a compulsive desire to download my torrents (perhaps pathological). See a psychologist.
,melros1,2013-02-08T00:14Z,"promodsharma. It is disappointing that you are not prepared to accept my olive branch but prefer to make disparaging remarks of a personal nature. I do not intend to prolong this by responding in kind. I have the impression that we are equally resolute in character, though in the end I'm sure we both have more valuable ways to make use of our time. So I ask once again that we resolve this amicably and just agree to disagree. Your response, if you make one, will not be known to me anyway as I choose to end it here. When I sign off this message I will not reopen this torrent. I hope you will be gracious enough to accept. You have my best wishes for your future projects. "
[V],promodsharma,2013-02-08T02:21Z,melros1 - Truce accepted. Maybe if you PM me at 'suprbay.org' I can help you get some useful content for your students.
,globalpuffer,2013-02-08T07:34Z,"That's comedy.  If I may interject, I would like to point out that at times I have found, ""dated"" tutorials and books to contain valuable information.  Often, especially with complex graphics programs like Photoshop CS6 (which I do use and Autodesk Maya which I also use) new features will replace older methods of using the program, but the older methods are often more powerful ways of using the program because those methods involve interactions with the core architecture, which is still in place, often with the new programming on top.   There are times when a need to do something requires knowledge of these program structures and the new tutorials often leave that information out in favor of the new gadgets.   So hey mr prmodsharma, keep up the good work.  Some of us do get it, and appreciate your efforts."
,globalpuffer,2013-02-08T07:41Z,"For example... although PS has made great efforts to simplify the process and made some handy new tools to help, I sill use the old pen tool to get selections because sometimes, it is the only way to do it.  And how long have we been doing that?  Since the pen tool came out and it's been there as long as I can remember.  I've seen new tuts that don't even mention it when they discuss making selections in favor of tools that seem to work great on the images they pick but like crap on the ones I have to work with."
[V],promodsharma,2013-02-09T04:08Z,"I feel sorry at  the way I behaved towards 'melros1'. But if he was a teacher trying to get material for his students, he should have just asked. 

@'globalpuffer' - I agree with you absolutely. In their effort to make a software 'user friendly' the developers have sometimes done the reverse."
,Poseidon_M_Hernandez,2013-03-22T08:35Z,"melros1: you are a twat, shut the fuck up. promodsharma: thanks for your upload :)"
[V],promodsharma,2013-04-10T23:38Z,@'Poseidon_M_Hernandez' - Thanks for showing the comment spammer his place ^_^
