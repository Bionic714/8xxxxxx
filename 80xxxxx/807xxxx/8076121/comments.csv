[T],penfag,2013-04-08T20:43Z,"I know this is a huge and time-consuming request but is there any chance you have access to and can upload the ""Journal of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry"" (American Chemical Society, 1924-1970)? A user on the SuprBay Forum is having difficulty finding a complete run of the journal and would much appreciate any help you can provide. Please feel free to respond on that thread:
