I have been using this site for years now but I have a question & I guess I figured you would know the answer...I downloaded a RAR file of this show last night & I downloaded IZarc (an extracting/coverting program highly talked about) to see if I could figure out how to convert (or extract) RAR & ZIP. I have wanted to know how to do this for years (I use Calibre to convert any books I use) but I can never seem to get it to work for Videos (Not Calibre but any other converting prog.) So I was hoping you could help me gain a little more knowledge on this subject. I have no issues at all coverting books with Calibre and I have downloaded so many different Video Converting programs and never does it work. 
Thanks again for the upload. May you be blessed for all that you do for others!"
,technomax_1,2013-01-28T21:30Z,from my experience those rar files are usually password locked and cant be converted

Thank you for replying!!"
