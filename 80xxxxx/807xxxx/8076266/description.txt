3.Luftwaffe Secret Projects, Ground Attack & Special Purpose Aircraft
  by Dieter Herwig and Heinz Rode

  DESCRIPTION:
  The two previous volumes in this hugely popular series have covered Fighters 1939-1945 and Strategic Bombers 1935-1945. This new addition takes a close look at a varied range of aircraft types, principally described as ground-attack and special-purpose types, but which includes Kampfzerst√∂rer (multi-purpose combat aircraft), multi-purpose and fast bombers, explosive-carrying aircraft intended to attack other aircraft, air-to-air ramming vehicles, bomb-carrying gliders and towed fighters, and airborne weapons and special devices (rockets, cannons, flame-throwers, etc.) 

As in the first two volumes, the technical descriptions and histories of about 140 aircraft types are brought to life by many specially created full-color artworks, showing the projects, often in unit markings, as they might have appeared if they had come to fruition and/or if the war had continued beyond 1945. This series has proven indispensable for historians and notably for modelers, whose imaginations are fired up by these revelations.
