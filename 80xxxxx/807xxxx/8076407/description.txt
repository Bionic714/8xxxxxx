Learning Blues haphazardly can be very frustratingΓÇöa lick here, a lick thereΓÇöso having a complete system that takes you by the hand from the basic progressions and tools to advanced blues soloing can save you months of dead-end trial and error.

With this course, you'll learn the notes, chords, and form that make up the blues. You'll also build a strong repertoire of ready-to-use riffs (shown in both music and TAB) that can immediately be incorporated into your playing.

You'll hear exactly what to play with each session's "Hearing the Blues" ear training exercises. Explore and demonstrate your new skills with a real band in a variety of musical settings using the Jam-Along CD and DVD.
