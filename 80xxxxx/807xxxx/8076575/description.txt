Description : 

 C4droid is a simple C/C++ IDE + C/C++ compiler for Android with GNU Makefile, SDL and Qt support. C4droid supports devices with ARM processors only (not devices with Intel x86 or MIPS processor).
You can create your own applications on Android phone, and run them (even without Internet access: compiler is offline). This app uses TCC and uClibc (or GCC with Bionic libc with a plugin), so it has full support of ANSI C and ISO C99. C4droid can be used for educational purposes or to practice in C/C++ language.
Some components of C4droid are LGPL-licensed. You can download used source code of TCC and uClibc on their websites (But TCC had been modified by me, so I recommend to email me to get modified source).

To get C++ support you need:
0) Enough internal memory OR root rights.
1) Install GCC plugin (C4droid will ask you to install it).
2) Select G++ compiler in C4droid preferences.
3*) Use iostream, not iostream.h
4*) Add "using namespace std;" to your program (before int main)

To compile Makefile projects, open any file in the same folder with Makefile and long-click "Compile" to configure current directory (C4droid will create .c4droid configuration file when you'll press Ok). After configuring folder, you can press compile button and C4droid will build your project.
Don't forget to enter executable name and select compilation mode (and press ok also, else changes will be discarded)

C4droid supports SDL, NativeActivity and Qt for GUI now, install SDL plugin for C4droid to use it (only GCC/G++ compiler is supported, so you need GCC plugin).
(SDL is detected with #include "SDL.h", NativeActivity is detected with #include "android_native_app_glue.h", Qt is detected with #include "QtGui").
There is an experimental support for Qt using necessitas, but note that it's in alpha stage.
Qt support limitations:
1) Path to Ministro libraries is hardcoded (/data/data/org.kde.necessitas.ministro/files/qt/lib), so email me if it will change.
2) If you're compiling a single-file Qt app, you must add #include "yoursourcefilenamewithcpp.moc" to the end of file. If you're using .pro file for compilation, you don't need to do that.
