,mizar,2013-01-28T22:34Z,I think this is a bit complicated. I want to activate Office 2013 only and I will not break my permanent activation of Windows 8. Description says that I will add the argument /nowin/ to KMSELDI.exe and edit the Manual_Silent.cmd. Right? But how? I need some help with a step by step guide. Thanks.
,mizar,2013-01-29T00:52Z,Thank you for the answer! I followed your guide and everything is fine.
