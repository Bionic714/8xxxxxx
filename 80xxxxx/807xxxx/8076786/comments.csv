Sorry for the error."
[V],thetorrentlord,2013-01-28T23:24Z,Does the source for your files only have some of the televised games? Is that the reason only some games are posted and others are not?  Or are you choosing which ones to upload here? Just curious why only some of the nationally televised games are posted here.
[V],Nepotu,2013-01-29T09:28Z,What sport you're talking about?
[V],thetorrentlord,2013-01-29T15:53Z,I was referring to basketball.

[V],thetorrentlord,2013-01-29T19:38Z,"Thanks,  I was just curious as to why only some of the games were posted here and not all of the televised games."
[V],Nepotu,2013-01-30T01:30Z,"If you see that and have some request, let me know!"
