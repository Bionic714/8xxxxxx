The blessed father Iakovos Tsalikis born on November 5 in 1920 Livisi in Asia Minor.
His childhood years were very difficult, as this area is notoriously dominated by the Turks. When he was two years all Livisianoi ordered to leave the area. Approximately 2000 women, children and old men (since all men were led prisoners to forced-together and the father of the late James, Stavros) brought the sad procession. Frightened eyes, legs stagger, dark heart without hope. The little Jacob was holding in her arms the mother. His brothers, George and Tasoula, was only four years and forty days. Without the slightest financial supplies, since the few things they could get their seized the Turks began a harrowing journey that lasted a week or more. Finally arrived in Itea. Head of the family was now the grandmother of James, Mama Despina. Woman with fiery faith, unfailing patience and capacity. Since it took the shining example and taught to love God and people James. Finally in 1925 carried the Livisianous refugees at a site in northern Evia, in the village Farakla.
At 1924,the tormented family of Elder,finally transferred to North Evia, in the village "Farakla".
Our Elder,said that in the house, three things were dominated:
Love,fasting and charity.Those 3 things was a basic status in the family.Love was diffuse the house.As for charity, no one passed by the house,that does not take care of his mother-grandma Theodora-as we call her.When even some girls were in marriageable age,she helps as long as possible.Charity was always basic in the whole situation,and it is a fact that most of times was secret-nobody knew.This is why the Elder gave emphasis to those 3 things-love,fasting and charity...

Very importance to the spiritual development of the offspring,has the mental state,and,generally the way of living of their ancestors.

"The root is very important" often the Elder said.He was fortunate to feel this root as his first and most important educator,in the life of faith and piety,in the face of his mother,Theodora-that she was embellished with virtues of charity,of continence,of fasting of hardworking,and tidiness.

THAT IS A SMALL SAMPLE OF WHAT DOES REALLY FAITH CREATES.
THERE IS ONLY ONE TRUTH,NOT OTHERS,AND THIS IS THE ANCIENT CHURCH OF GOD,THAT CALLED ORTHODOXY,THE ONE AND ONLY WHICH HAD THE CONNECTION WITH THE APOSTLES,AND THE LORD SINCE 2000 YEARS FROM NOW.

GOD HIMSELF SHOWED US,THROUGH HIS MIRACLES,AS WE SAW IN THE CASE OF THE HUMBLE ELDER,THAT THROUGH  HUMILITY,PEOPLE CAN ACHIEVE THEOSIS.
GOD SHOWED US THE TRUTH EVEN,THROUGH HIS MIRACLES,ABOUT THE REAL FAITH,AS WE CAN SEE THE HOLY LIGHT,THAT IS GIVEN ONLY TO ORTHODOX,FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS.

ALSO,EVERY YEAR,AT THE FEAST OF THE HOLY THEOFANY,THE WATER IN THE JORDAN RIVER TURNING TOWARDS! 
WE ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SALVATION OF OUR SOUL.

SO,CAREFULLY,WE MUST CHOOSE THE UNIQUE AND DIFFICULT ROAD OF THE LORD...
