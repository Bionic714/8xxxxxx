[T],MrUnpopular,2013-01-31T05:07Z,"Hey Raycort, I dunno how often you check comments on your torrents but do you plan to cap Be My Valentine and Who Let The Dogs Out on Hallmark or should I?"
[T],RayCort,2013-02-01T13:02Z,"@MrUnpopular, I have ""Be My Valentine"" written down to cap, but don't have a date on ""Who Let The Dogs Out""."
[T],MrUnpopular,2013-02-01T17:23Z,Thanks for the reply. I'll skip the Valentine one then. According to my TV guide Who Let The Dogs Out is a series on Hallmark - two episodes air today at 1 PM and two more next Friday at 1 PM. I'll grab them.
[T],RayCort,2013-02-01T22:10Z,"@MrUploader, Ok I Appreciate you capping Who Let the Dogs Out. I noticed it is Season 2. Did not know there was a 10 episode Season 1"
[T],MrUnpopular,2013-02-02T07:38Z,"I didn't either, I just happened to catch wind of it being new on Hallmark so I just assumed it was a movie but I was wrong."
