I converted episode two (ΓÇ£SavannahΓÇ¥) of David AttenboroughΓÇÖs ΓÇ£AfricaΓÇ¥ to XviD as best as I could with AVIDemux. I donΓÇÖt know if it is as good as what the professional releasers put out, but I used FTPΓÇÖs MP4 as the source and used all of the highest conversion settings (skipping the ones that give standalones problems). I also tried to resize it to be consistent with the 640x360 resolution of the existing XviD episodes, but the closest I could get was 640x358.

(As a side note, if anyone knows of a guide or something of how to do high-quality, consistently-sized releases like the sceners provide, please let me know because the conversions I make with AVIDemux and AutoGK are never satisfactory.)
