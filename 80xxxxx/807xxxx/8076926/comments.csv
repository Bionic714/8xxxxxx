,japser12,2013-01-28T19:44Z,"So if I am correct, this activator had no need to rerun every 180 days?

Will it also 'survive' future changes from MS on the KMS protocol? "
,r_moor,2013-01-28T21:54Z,"Excerpt from Readme-file : Run ""Run Trigger.cmd"" to install, or just KMSNano.exe for single activation
(TriggerKMS will run every boot, and if you have 30 days left or less, it will
re-run the activator)

,colthars,2013-01-29T01:25Z,great! thanks!!!
[V],murphy78,2013-01-29T01:36Z,"jasper, this generates fairly official kms activation files, so I think it's far more likely that MS would try to put this on their malware list as a hacktool.

If you allow the program through the protection, the number of ways that MS could stop this activation method goes down dramatically.  They could make an anti-piracy KB file like they did for win7 kb971033, but I'm not sure it would stop these guys forever. I mean, they did it with Daz's Windows Loader, and he created a custom encryption so that the kb file couldn't find it.

It's really hard to say at this point what they could or could not do. I think it's likely they will start with the hacktool malware listing. It's not really true... This doesn't hack any system files. But, I could see why someone would want to call it a hacktool as it bypasses activation in a clever way."

Your KMSNano v15.1 to KMSNano v19 activate following Microsoft_Office_2013_ProPlus_VL_(x86_and_x64) in 8 no different PC

My quesion:
 Is these KMSNano may harm to ""Original/gennuine Windows 8 activasion"" during activate, Microsoft Office 2013 ProPlus VL(x86_and_x64) by your KMSNano ?"
[V],murphy78,2013-01-29T10:35Z,"Yes rupankur. It does all the activation commands simultaneously and it does not currently bypass the conversion from retail to volume on already activated retail versions.

You can backup activation with Advanced Tokens Manager before using it and just restore if you ever need to, or perhaps try another kms activation solution.

It runs all of the commands automatically with the kmseldi program, so you cannot exactly pick it apart.

KMS Toolkit might have single office activation options. I don't know.

You're not going to lose much by using kms activation over your purchased retail activation. It literally only runs the program for about 2 minutes a year."
[V],murphy78,2013-01-29T13:19Z,"A guy over in the MDL forum was testing out the retail office 2013 activation. He said it completed successfully but that it takes like 12 minutes for the full process. I guess when it converts from Retail to VL, it installs licenses for every little program in Office. To save yourself the headache, I highly recommend getting a VL version instead of Retail. You are NOT going to be able to activate the Retail unless you purchase it, which only leaves the long conversion process.

Again, check the above link to Arkenstone's stuff as he upped VL versions that work perfectly with this activator.

My total time activating Win 8 Enterprise x64 with Office 2013 ProPlus VL x64 was 42 seconds. That's much better than 12 minutes."
,kaalki,2013-01-29T14:49Z,the wmc key method of permanent activation is still working today I activated 2 pc's with phone activation it is working till 31 jan hurry up 
,and_cac,2013-01-29T16:48Z,"pl_office_professional_plus_2013_x86_x64_dvd_1340079 (retail)  work perfectly with LaNanov11.2 and 15

Activating on activated Win 8 Pro WMC x64 was less than 2 minutes. "
[V],murphy78,2013-01-29T23:29Z,"The log I read that took 12 minutes installed all of the little licenses, so it's possible those older kmsnano that didn't take very long did not do that."
,hardm2001,2013-01-30T09:52Z,"Worked like a charm on W7 Ent
1000 thanks @murphy78 !"
,rupankur,2013-01-30T10:03Z,"@murphy78
There are no problem/harm in ""original Windows activasion"" during the activasion of Microsoft_Office_2013_ProPlus_VL_(x86_and_x64) by KMSNano v19 in 3 nos PC today. "
[V],murphy78,2013-01-30T17:43Z,"If you are saying that it did not harm your legit activation, that's good news."

Before I told him not served, Thanks!
