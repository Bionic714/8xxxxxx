Those who have followed the meteoric rise of DETROIT DIESEL, or read the credits of the seminal debut album ΓÇ£Terre HumaineΓÇ¥, might recall the name of former member Clutch ΓÇô who parted company with the band shortly before the release of that first album. 
If you are one of those who wondered ΓÇ£So whatever happened to that guy?ΓÇ¥ then wonder no longer ΓÇô wonder only at the sheer adrenaline rush unleashed on his new trio NITRONOISEΓÇÖs own first album ΓÇ£Total NihilismΓÇ¥. 

Hailing from Montreal - and about to make their live debut at no less an event than Kinetik 5 in their hometown - for ΓÇ£Total NihilismΓÇ¥ NITRONOISE takes the sound palette of ΓÇ£Terre HumaineΓÇ¥ plus equal parts NACHTMAHR and COMBICHRIST and throws some guitars into the mix for good measure.
 
Rounded out with a hard dance version by STUDIO-X, a rock remix from ALIEN VAMPIRES and a club smasher from NOISUF-X, this is one of the essential new albums and new faces we introduce this Spring! 
NITRONOISE will get under your skin ΓÇô ΓÇ£Just let me in, sweet adrenalineΓÇ¥.
