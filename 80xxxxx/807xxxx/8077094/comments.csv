,ZombieSwitch,2013-01-29T18:25Z,"NOTE: ""A Big Mix of Besides"" is a collection containing most of Nirvana's best quality ""vault"" material, presented as an album for the first time. There are no filler tracks featuring multiple demo versions of songs you already know and love....only one track in this compilation appeared on any release of Nirvana's first four records (Endless, Nameless was not part of the original Nevermind album and the version here is different - better IMHO). A Big Mix of Besides will burn nicely onto two CDs by putting tracks 1-22 on disc one and 23-44 on disc two. The majority (39) of these tracks were taken from a pile of box set and bootleg material collected over the last decade, while five of them were swiped from the Unplugged, since those songs were not original album material. The track titles are as accurate as I can believe, since this band's unofficial songs were often mislabeled. The quality is the best out there for these tracks that I could find. I just figured it was about time fans could find the best of Nirvana's non-album songs in one collection, presented as a double CD. The cover art the files have been tagged with is an actual Kurt Cobain original painting. Please SEED SEED SEED and spread the word - help get these songs to ALL of Nirvana's fans! Enjoy! 

Incidentally, to anybody who grabbed my first attempt at posting ""A Big Mix of Besides"", be aware that the track Cocaine Girl has been confirmed to NOT be a song by Nirvana and Hole. It is by a band called StageFright and can be found on Youtube. Sorry for the mix-up! "
