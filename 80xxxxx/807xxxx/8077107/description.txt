Melancholie Der Engel is widely regarded by most extreme horror film fans as the single most extreme film that has ever been created. This film pushes every boundary that has ever been set before in an extreme film. There are scenes in here that will make even the most hardened horror fan cringe.


This film was created in 2009 by the extreme German horror film director, Marian Dora. This director was behind the famous film Cannibal, which caused massive controvery when it was first released. He has done the same thing again with this film. It is shot in much the same fashion using, light and shadow as not only a part of the scene, but almost as a character in itself.

Contains very extreme,disturbing and sick twisted scenes so if you have a little doubt about seeing this movie ,dont do it,if you think this is just another Serbian film or August Underground Mordum kind of film its not,they are like a disneymovie compared to this so think twice before watching.
