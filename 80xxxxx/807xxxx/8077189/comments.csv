Thanks so much mate!  If you don't mind my asking, if you could give me some idea as to where the source originates from.  The reason I'm curious is that I don't THINK the US release from EchoBridge is uncut like this one (and I doubt that they would do such a great job on it too  : )

I'm thinking that it probably is a European source, but I'm just curious as to where an uncut, full DTS print would originate from.

Appreciate it!!!"
