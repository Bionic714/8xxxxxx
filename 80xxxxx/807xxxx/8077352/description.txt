Stars: Kenny Doughty, Ingvar Eggert Sigurðsson and Mark Womack

Focusing on the timeless themes of jealousy, murder and betrayal, 'I Against I' is set over one night and utilises different time lines to reveal a dark and unexpected conclusion to a simple mystery premise. The main protagonists, opposite in character, take a frantic journey into a desolate nocturnal world with the common aim of survival, though once completed, the plot reveals a trap from which escape may be impossible. Taking influence from films like 'Le Samurai', 'Point Break', and new Asian noir, the film is a modern homage to hard boiled cinema with its own original take.
