This torrent is from the Abraham-Hicks Sharing Community. 
Our intention as a Community is to help one another to get all of the AbrahamΓÇÖs material, particularly the latest. We as a group and as individuals buy it and share it, in any way we can (mainly via Torrents, DropBox, SugarSync, WeTransfer)... 

Remember that the SEEDERS are the backbone of Abraham-Hicks Torrents!
