Donington Live 1983
Walking in the shadow of the Blues
Rough 'n Ready
Ready an Willing
Guilty of Love
Here I go again
Love hunter
Mistreated
Soldier of Fortune
Ain't no love in the heart of the City
Fool for your loving

Guilty of love
The time is right of love
Fool for your loving
Give me all your love
Here I go again
Love ain't no stranger
Give me more time
Still of the night
Slow 'an Easy
Is this love
Now you're gone
The deeper the love

Pride and Joy
Take me for a little while
