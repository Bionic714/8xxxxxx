Hidden Beach Recordings presents: Unwrapped - The Ultimate Box Set

This is a compilation of all of the music that HB had produced over the years plus videos, bonus tracks, 

etc. I hope you enjoy this latest release from RubiksFaQ!

Note - FLAC is a lossless file format that allows for perfect 1:1 audio production and at half the space 

of WAV files. If you are interested, you can convert these files into MP3s later, but for the 

audiophiles out there, this release is for you!
