,DEBRATABOR,2013-01-29T12:18Z,"Thank you, as usual URGR8!
Have you watched Heartbeat? It is old stuff, but nice, in my opinion. Nice Yorkshire there.
Series 12-18 not available though. May be you have access to them ?:-))))"
[T],h2obagger,2013-01-30T17:57Z,"Hi DEBRATABOR,  can't say that I am familiar with the series you mention, may have to take a peek  Sounds like you found a stand in for the off days without EE's anyway.  :-)"
,DEBRATABOR,2013-01-31T13:19Z,"Nothing beats EE:-) I watch quite a lot of English series. Midsomer Murders, Inspector Lewis, not to mention Downton Abbey;-)
And thank you for responding, and for EE! "
