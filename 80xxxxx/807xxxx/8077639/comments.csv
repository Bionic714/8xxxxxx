,smurellee,2013-04-15T11:36Z,"this is working excellent.the fools who are not even able to find the place of the program, opens their mouth wide enough to hold all the c..ks , in the world. some thing which the tuneup meant in design may be missing but , all the functions are working like velvet.do not discourage some genius pirates who toil hard to give us these progs for nothing.if you are dumb you don't have place in this pirates bay. go suck yourself."
