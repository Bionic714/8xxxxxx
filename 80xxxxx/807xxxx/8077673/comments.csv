:) finally something Good"
,R4ge97,2013-01-29T01:22Z,this is awesome!!!!
,7117,2013-01-29T15:47Z,"yeah, after calming down, i take back my greetings.

 a) ''RE-Vision'' plugin does not registering, stays in demo and watermarked.

 b)yes, these are very old plugins for AE and this installers don't work with osx 10.8 ML
etc

this is real stone age plugins bundle :D"
,therealtommyjay,2013-01-30T10:13Z,"@7117 What didn't work for you? I am running 10.8.2 and all the installs worked fine for me, including RE-Vision, which are out of trial mode.. 

Also guys, yes some of these plug-ins are out of date guys, but they are very useful, and most of them haven't been updated since the current release. I tried to get the most up to dave version of the plugins which I use most commonly... All I can say is enjoy & seed"
,7117,2013-01-30T11:06Z,"@therealtommyjay
my story is that  ''RE-Vision'' was my target, but sadly registering didn't work.at end this script gives error -500.
 (nr and name is okay for plugin registr, but after closing installer,shows 'error-500').
my sys is: osx 10.8.2 and AE CS6
..and some plugins installers didn't open even, Factory or was that Knoll stuff, one of theys... 
and all rest plugins i don't know how works, i didn' try, i have already newer  version of them.."
,therealtommyjay,2013-01-31T13:07Z,"@7117 Well, I have the same exact system you described, and from i use denoizer, twixter and smooth kit, all of which work for me... Same with knoll light factory for both photoshop and after effects, can't imagine where the problem can be :-/"
