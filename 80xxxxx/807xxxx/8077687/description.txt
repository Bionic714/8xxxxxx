Ben 10: Omniverse - Season 1 - Episode 19 (WEB-DL - 1080p)
----------------------------------------------------------

Ben may think he has grown up with new alien heroes like Shocksquatch and Bloxx
ready for battle, but this superhero teen is definitely not out on his own. The
Plumbers have recruited a new partner for him - Rook. He's no-nonsense in every
way. Meaning he has yet to understand Ben's uh... "sense of humor". But Rook is
some excellent backup. And Ben is going to need all the help he can get what
with Khyber the Hunter hot on his intergalactic tail.

Produced by Cartoon Network Studios.
