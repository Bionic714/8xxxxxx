,alkx6470,2013-01-31T17:03Z,"YIFY - I want to thank you for devoting more bps to the audio in this download.  I don't know if you guys are doing this regularly now, but the low bitrate you were dedicating to audio in previous releases has kept me away from your rips.

However, there is still one problem with the audio in your releases.  As people have been pointing out for some time, the volume is too low.  I had the audio on this up to the absolute maximum when I watched this movie with external speakers, and it was *barely* adequate.  Fortunately, there was no background noise where I was watching the movie.  If there had been, I probably would not have been able to hear some of the audio because I would not have been able to turn the volume up higher to hear the audio better over the background noise.

So, again, thanks for the better audio quality.  Just please do something about the audio volume in your future releases.

Thanks!!!

I usually watch all the movies at film.remerick.com because they have HD's but they didn't have this one so im happy to have piratebay :) Thnx once again for this great share!"
,nbmatt,2013-02-22T10:13Z,"@alkx6470: Encoding wouldn't affect the volume in such a noticeable way unless, for some reason, whoever was transcoding the file tried to mix down the surround sound track and didn't know what to do (and I doubt that's the case here because it's always been evident YIFY is on the ball). Since the audio track should still be surround you'd need to tell your media player to remix the 5.1 track to stereo."
