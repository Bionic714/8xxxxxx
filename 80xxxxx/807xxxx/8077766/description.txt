After key Band of Horses influence Neil Young experienced his commercial peak with Harvest he famously reflected that it had put him in the middle of the road and that he soon ΓÇ£headed for the ditch.ΓÇ¥ On Mirage Rock - the follow-up to the Ben Bridwell-fronted actΓÇÖs Grammy-nominated, game-changing 2010 release, Infinite Arms - Band of Horses keep a safe distance from the ditch with the help of producer Glyn Johns. As it happens, heΓÇÖs the very man who helped the 1972-1973 period Eagles lineup hone their saccharine, radio-friendly and harmony-laden sound while Young was exploring comparatively rugged and less-traveled terrain. 

  Seemingly enlisted to consolidate the success of the self-produced Infinite Arms, Johns brings a great deal of experience to Mirage Rock. Production-wise, while Infinite Arms was layered and cavernous, Mirage Rock has a heart-on-sleeve immediacy to it, borne out of JohnsΓÇÖ insistence that the band deliver well-rehearsed live takes of much of the material. However, while their third record flowed effortlessly, the ebb of Mirage Rock is, to some extent, compromised by an earnest attempt to showcase the bandΓÇÖs eclecticism. The strong opening trio of tracks -- the pounding, lo -fi indie rock of ΓÇ£Knock Knock,ΓÇ¥ the striking Jayhawks-inspired country pop of ΓÇ£How to Live,ΓÇ¥ and the laid-back, melancholic West Coast haze of ΓÇ£Slow Cruel Hands of TimeΓÇ¥ - are contrasting but inspired choices for the albumΓÇÖs front end. However, the mid-set ΓÇ£Dumpster WorldΓÇ¥ - sonically closer to a pastiche of George MartinΓÇÖs America than the Eagles - has its understated sarcasm crushed by a chugging alt-rock mid-section. 

  Similarly, while BridwellΓÇÖs uptempo and overtly political ΓÇ£FeudΓÇ¥ approximates Graham Nash fronting the Foo Fighters, it sits awkwardly between the bluegrass-tinged ΓÇ£EverythingΓÇÖs Gonna Be UndoneΓÇ¥ and the truly beautiful, strolling Buffalo Springfield nod ΓÇ£Long Vows.ΓÇ¥ All in all, though, itΓÇÖs the pros that outweigh the cons here. BridwellΓÇÖs natural gift for melody is given room to shine throughout and is complemented by some of the finest, most spine-tingling harmonies among the band and their contemporaries. ThereΓÇÖs also a playful sense of humor evident here on tracks such as ΓÇ£A Little Biblical,ΓÇ¥ which can sometimes be lacking in the music of Fleet Foxes, Kings of Leon, and their ilk. 

  In addition, Bridwell shows that he can match Robin Pecknold lyrically on ΓÇ£Slow Cruel Hands of Time,ΓÇ¥ a sincere, heartfelt rumination on growing old that takes in the grandeur of ΓÇ£the skyΓÇªin the yardΓÇ¥ and the minutiae of stumbling across ΓÇ£a big city manΓÇ¥ he used ΓÇ£to rumble withΓÇªback in high school.ΓÇ¥ Overall, though, while Mirage Rock sees Band of Horses further immerse themselves in Americana, more than anything it finds them enraptured by the simple joy of music-making. ΓÇ£Electric MusicΓÇ¥ - a freewheeling slice of Stones/Creedence-inspired rock - encapsulates this premise and finds them ΓÇ£traveling the open roadΓÇ¥ without a ditch in sight.
