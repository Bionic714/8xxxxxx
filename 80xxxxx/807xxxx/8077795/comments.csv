Because you watch it on super wide screen so you don't see the black bars..
These subs are scaled for 16/9 (1920/1080) monitors to show on lower black bar.
If you can't re-scale it in player use the default style for subtitles. Or in Subtitle edit 3.2.8 File/Import subtitle from matroska/save as srt."
