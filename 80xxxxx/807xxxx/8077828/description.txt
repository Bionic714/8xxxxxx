Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site :: On the Monday, January 28 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex runs down the hacked emails indicative of an imminent staged Syrian chemical weapons attack, the likes of which would pave the way for military intervention, but more importantly would constitute a serious war crime. 

Meanwhile in the U.S., no excuse is needed for military intervention, as was apparent in downtown Miami last week where yet another "training exercise" took place boasting Blackhawk helicopters and machine guns firing blank rounds...unbeknownst to civilians. 

Alex also covers CNN host Piers Morgan's concession of defeat to the NRA in the face of Senator Feinstein's flopping gun control bill.
