,Pharmit24,2013-01-29T04:57Z,"Yup, what does this App does?"
,kidlonewolf,2013-01-29T05:16Z,"its so the apps don't check paid key, and get rid of the need to use lucky patcher"
,CashAndPotatoes,2013-01-29T09:13Z,"Some paid apps always checks for verification by Google Play. and if you've downloaded it e.g from here maybe you can use it because Google Play hasn't verified it.
But thanks to ChelpuS he has modded it and removed the verification so the apps always thinks its verified"
,mcena91,2013-01-29T13:35Z,TY HobbitWarez...but i have one question...is this for rooted phones only or all phones?

,steve221,2013-01-30T01:45Z,So does that mean the apps will be able to get updated without having to install a new version? Thanks again for providing a non-douchebag answer like most of the internet. 
,chop007,2013-01-31T20:12Z,Freakin awesome bro. Thank you.
,wire55,2013-02-02T01:59Z,How do i get the apps that cost money in cracked ver. It just says i have to add a card or redeem. Idk what to do help me.
,Toperharrier,2013-02-03T02:08Z,"This DOESNT fake credit card payouts! How the hell would it be supposed to get paid apps from play store by itself?

It ""only"" bypass LVL security so when you download pro apps from WEB with such security they are not refused to verify by market.

It wont let you update such app thru play store either, but youll be able to use them all downloading from any other site without the need to patch everyone of them with luckypatcher."
,wire55,2013-02-05T01:39Z,So it means if i were to download a 3rd party app it would let me use it without buying it like gangstar rio city of saints for example.

,calfilms,2013-03-10T17:02Z,"Before I do this, is there a way to backup and restore the original Google Play? Also, does the modded Google Play prevent Google Play from updating? Or is that a separate process we need to take care of?"
,Davos86,2013-03-22T05:58Z,"Thank You! Black Market plus this moded Google Play store, it's the best combination! thanks for the upload."
