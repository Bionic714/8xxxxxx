Asimov's Guide to the Bible, 2 volumes in 1.

This book was previously posted here in two separate files:
 
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7508282/Asimov_s_Guide_to_the_Bible_(gnv64)

But it's 172 mb. For this torrent the pages of both those books have been reprocessed with ScanTailor and a new pdf created from them. The file size is down to 21 mb and I hope it's more readable. Complete contents have been added to the pdf bookmarks.

About the book:

Since Asimov was not a religious person, this book is more about history than religion. Contains lots of background info on the biblical texts and the facts (or lack thereof) behind them.
