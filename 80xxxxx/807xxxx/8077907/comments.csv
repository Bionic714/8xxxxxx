,sic13,2013-01-29T05:42Z,A/V anyone? Also is this the Russian source?
,silentinquiry,2013-01-29T16:45Z,Most likely russian source with russian title. They were the first to come out with it in br and nobody else has since. its iffy at best. d/l it now and will advise
,silentinquiry,2013-01-29T16:47Z,at least its in avi and not mkv. thats a plus to start with
,silentinquiry,2013-01-29T17:36Z,"Yes, its the russian source with russian titles, etc. good quality movie, a/v are excellent but will wait for an english source with englisg titles."
,acc6804,2013-01-30T00:35Z,@silentinquiry - You'll be waiting a long while. The studio pushed back the US Blu-Ray release until this summer.
,silentinquiry,2013-01-30T18:08Z,Drat.... thanks anyways

,ssx30,2013-04-06T21:30Z,a huge thank you for sharing this film ! I couldnt go and see it in cinemas at time xD (is it true it is a commercial failure ?). Thanks!
