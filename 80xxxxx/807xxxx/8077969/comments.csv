,wizonmeth,2013-02-05T19:22Z,the truckfighters are the greatest band of all time
,uheardmebitch,2013-02-10T13:03Z,oh my i seriously love you. i don't care if you have 7 arms and a head like a potato if you can seed this i'll fly to wherever you are and give fifty headjobs
,uheardmebitch,2013-02-11T07:46Z,"ok so to those who are waiting for a seed, like me, here is the story. the guy is portugese, and wants the movie translated to his language for local release to his friends who love the movie but have no idea what anyone is saying. i have offered to translate if he seeds. lets hope he answers his email :)"
,uheardmebitch,2013-02-12T12:25Z,oh gawd. no response from him. it looks like he's just another flake who doesn't know how to seed his own torrent
,uheardmebitch,2013-02-28T03:52Z,i got a copy coming in the mail. i assure you i know how to seed a torrent. it'll be up and running in a few weeks. 
,uheardmebitch,2013-03-03T11:12Z,"and if ur wondering, NO, this torrent has never been seeded. not even one KB. somebody just wants to advertise their lame blog"
,qotsa328,2013-03-06T16:57Z,"the download links on this guys blog are legit, watching the film right now. even comes with the extras. speed wasn't that bad either averaged 2.1mb/s"
,uheardmebitch,2013-03-12T06:07Z,yeh he just emailed me back. he says he's having trouble with the torrent. it never seems to work. but he's happy for someone else to torrent it. the blog links work. i might wait for my DVD copy now!!! but to everyone else get their fuzz on and go to his blog [just google derochas blog]
