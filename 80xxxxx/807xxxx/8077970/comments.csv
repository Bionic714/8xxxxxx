,BSnapp,2013-01-29T17:29Z,"One of the annuals ties in with Crisis on Infinite Earths.  I tried to send arrowgreen the link from h33t, for this torrent, but it kept saying database error when I attempted to submit it...

Sorry ArrowGreen, I tried..STFMary usually responds in kind, and quickly too"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-01-29T20:03Z,"thanks BSnapp, yeah TPB doesn't let you post certain links, that's what the database error means. i'm glad you said that though, because i had found these on filestube but i should've looked on h33t. it would've saved time."

,KingLoo,2013-02-16T22:27Z,"For anyone curious: these are the same old scans that have been in circulation for ten years or more. Not new rips from the cleaned-up digital publication.

Thank you to all seeders!"
