Conehead Buddha - Rockets [200][192Kbps]


Conehead Buddha has been gracing the east coast with great original music since 1993. Blending various styles from rock, to Latin funk and ska, they have truly defied the boredom arrived from listening to bands whose songs all start to sound the same. When playing live, the band often opens up the songs to spontaneous improvs, giving them much credibility in the jam/groove scene.
