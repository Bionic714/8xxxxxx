I apparently messed up and put the wrong audio in place for season 3 episode 2a (the circus episode) sorry for the confusion the new torrent has the fixed file.

P.S. If you point your torrent app at the directory for the old torrent then it should recheck the files and not force you to re-download everything. just a time saver

Again sorry for the inconvenience and confusion"
