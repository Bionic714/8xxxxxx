"The Marry Prankster"

When the gang pranks Max into thinking he won 
a big lotto jackpot, he vows revenge when 
they least suspect it. Everyone dreads what 
might happen next; Alex decides to cut a deal 
with Max to avoid payback . . . while Max's 
plotting gets in the way of the big event 
Penny's been waiting for, a proposal from 
Pete. Meanwhile, Brad gets a new job as a 
CFO, but Jane is not amused when she learns 
the title is Chief Fun Officer and that Brad 
is working at a kids' gym.
