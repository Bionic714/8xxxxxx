Vincent Anthony Dellaglio aka Vince Guaraldi (1928-1976) is most known for his

"Charlie Brown Christmas" recordings.  His other work is also worth checking out..

like this drumless piano trio he led in 1956.  Call it "West Coast Jazz" if

a pigeonhole is required.



This music is very easy listening but it is still great jazz.
