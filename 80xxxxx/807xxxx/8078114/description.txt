"The Twist in the Plot"

The Jeffersonian team investigates 
the remains of two bodies that were 
found at the same burial plot: one of 
a female cancer patient; the other, 
the cancer patient's "doula," who was 
guiding her through her grieving 
process with the illness. Meanwhile, 
with a spotlight on the case, Brennan 
and Booth start discussing their 
individual choices for after-death 
arrangements. Also, Daisy Wick 
returns for her first case after her 
break-up with Sweets.
