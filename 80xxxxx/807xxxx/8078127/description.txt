The first of three Repairman Jack prequels, revealing the past of one of the most popular characters in contemporary dark fantasy: a self-styled ΓÇ£fix-itΓÇ¥ man who is no stranger to the macabre or the supernatural, hired by victimized people who have no one else to turn to.

 

We join Jack a few months after his arrival in New York City. He doesnΓÇÖt own a gun yet, though heΓÇÖs already connected with Abe. Soon heΓÇÖll meet Julio and the Mikulski brothers. He runs afoul of some Dominicans, winds up at the East Side Marriott the night Meir Kahane is shot, gets on the bad side of some Arabs, starts a hot affair, and disrupts the smuggling of preteen sex slaves. And thatΓÇÖs just Book One.
