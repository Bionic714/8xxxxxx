From nme.com:

"Enigmatic boy-boy duos. Synthesisers. Glacial melancholy. Sweden. The Sound Of Arrows tick as many boxes as your average clothing chain marketing meeting, but nobody outside the ΓÇÿ27 clubΓÇÖ ever died from being obvious. The chafe between blubbing and binary code just works. And so this album is the finest addition to the canon since Hurts ΓÇô and they werenΓÇÖt even Swedish. Better still, ΓÇÿVoyageΓÇÖ is just that in the finest of senses, gliding you through its phases in metallic pastel shades from romantic euphoria (ΓÇÿMagicΓÇÖ), the crush of heartbreak (ΓÇÿHurting All The WayΓÇÖ) through to an epic closer called ΓÇÿThere Is Still HopeΓÇÖ. This is basically what Coldplay were shooting for."
