,katyushko,2013-02-04T12:07Z,"You're awesome, thanks a lot!
Almost all of iSubs links at their website for 75+ episodes are not working now and this batch is a candy"
,shazlin255,2013-02-04T17:12Z,There's something wrong with episode 55. It abruptly stopped 10 minutes or so before the ending. I don't think it's my computer because I tried it both on KMPlayer and GOMPlayer. The file is 1.5GB but in iSubs it's 1.68GB.
,rmvids,2013-02-05T17:25Z,"Complete episodes as of February 3, 2013, 1-131 episodes for $20. Total of 10-11 CDs. Fully subbed. Anyone interested?"
,oah,2013-02-26T06:04Z,"This is amazing, just shows the love for Running man all over the world.
For those wondering, this is a variety show from korea with the spoken language being korean with english subtitles. The subs are fantastic up to ep 100, and decent after (but still good). The quality of this show, and the 720p makes it a fantastic show to watch. Definite download. I have already uploaded 120 gb, so keep seeding with me you guys. THIS TORRENT SHOULD NEVER DIE!"
,joyue,2013-03-04T07:12Z,"Hi @rmvids - I'm interested.  How should we do this?... I'm in Hong Kong though, by the ways.  Thanks!"
,ih8n00bs,2013-03-05T04:03Z,"South Korea has the best variety shows.  I wish the broadcast companies would release DVDs with subtitles so we wouldn't have such a hard time finding theses shows online.  I would LOVE to have all Family Outing season 1 episodes in decent quality.  But alas, it was never meant to be. :(  Running Man, FIGHTING!"
,444mpat444,2013-04-05T05:36Z,Seed Please
,garbyyy,2013-04-06T06:30Z,"Oh man, this is bad 3.3kb/s and I've just started."
,garbyyy,2013-04-14T20:55Z,"Took 1 week and 1 day, but I've finished!
