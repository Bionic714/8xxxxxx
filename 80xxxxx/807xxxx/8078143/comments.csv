,frankfuego,2013-01-30T02:30Z,"Thank you for uploading this.
Showing 71 seeders in my client with 36 peers and between the seeders only 3.8xx full versions of the torrent available (so looks like numerous downloaded parts).
Thanks again."

I wish I had some more bitocoins, but I'm a poorfag who cannot even cover the transaction fee."
