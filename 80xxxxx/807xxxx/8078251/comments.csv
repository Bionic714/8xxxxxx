,krimd00t,2013-02-02T04:17Z,Is this show any good?
,mexicoflor,2013-02-04T02:24Z,"Thank you - I am really enjoying this show.  Quite engaging and I love the Victorian gothic lit theme, a little different to your average drama - like a more sophisticated story from Criminal Minds! How long do we have to wait for Ep 3??"

,pirate450,2013-02-23T22:13Z,"Great episode, nice plot so far. Storyline is intelligent and i wouldn't change it even a bit. Quality - A10 V10. I usually watch everything at film.plotar.org	because they always have HD but they don't have tv shows so having TPB for TVshows is great, thnx!"
