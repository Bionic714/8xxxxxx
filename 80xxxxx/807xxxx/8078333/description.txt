                My Mad Fat Diary, the drama series based on Rae
                Earl's real-life diaries, continues. It takes a
                hilarious and honest look at teenage life through the
                eyes of Rae, a funny, music-mad 16-year-old. In the
                third episode, Rae and Chloe's friendship becomes
                difficult when Rae discovers who Chloe has been
                secretly dating. When things start to get rocky, Rae
                finds herself drawn back to her old patterns of
                destructive behaviour, but an upsetting event makes
                her view someone in the gang in a different light.
