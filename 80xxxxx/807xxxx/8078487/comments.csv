produced with noise intentionally to make it sound like an old phono record....the noise is not the result of anyone around here playing frisbee with my records......the engineers wanted this track noisy for effect"

It's an excellent album and somebody out there should upload it in .flac.............it's the only track here in LOSSY and it really deserves better treatment............Thankyou in advance"
