This upload celebrates "the sound" of the Classic MAHAVISHNU ORCHESTRA LP

BIRDS OF FIRE....at least the disc 2 compilation does.


Jan Hammer and violinist Jerry Goodman were primary contributors to the 

sound of that great album.


Disc 1 is a vinyl rip of the 1979 LP "HAMMER" which had controversial cover

art (included). It's no naughtier than the scene from Stanley Kubrick's movie

THE SHINING where Jack Nicholson uses an axe to break through a door.

On this LP a Hammer is used....very clever.  BANNED?   Why?


Jan Hammer is an accomplished drummer and producer.  He plays synth with the 

articulative nuance of a guitarist.  Perhaps his use of the POWELL PROBE

controller helped him accomplish this. (ROGER POWELL; TODD RUNDGREN'S UTOPIA)



These rips are from CDRW media utilizing a standalone burner and somewhat 

expensive "audiophile" gear.


Given that, a few pops and clicks are simply a part of the package.
