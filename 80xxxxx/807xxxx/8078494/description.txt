Paupers Field (2010)





Shreveport, Louisiana native Dylan LeBlanc spent his formative years surrounded by some of the region's finest musicians (his father, singer/songwriter/guitarist James LeBlanc, is a longtime Muscle Shoals session player). Dylan began writing his own songs at eleven, and by his late teens, had developed a soulful, bluesy voice and guitar style that resonated with the sights and sounds of his musical youth. He released Paupers Field, his smoky, languid Townes Van Zandt- and Fleet Foxes-inspired debut, on Rough Trade in 2010 at the ripe old age of nineteen, followed by the likeminded Cast the Same Old Shadow in 2012.


Dylan LeBlanc's Rough Trade debut aches with the kind world-weary angst and faux-wisdom that serves as the foundation for countless other confessional singer/songwriters. That the Louisiana native is only 20 years old will have some crying foul, but this son of a Muscle Shoals session player has grown up watching his mentors exorcize their demons through music, so why shouldnΓÇÖt he? Paupers Field, a 12-track collection of slow, soulful country-folk, falls somewhere between Nick Drake, Jason Molina, Kelly Joe Phelps and Fleet Foxes. LeBlancΓÇÖs smoky, emotive voice carries with it the reluctant ardor of his southern homeland, and his tales of love, life, loss and death feel real enough, if not duly informed by a lot of late nights nursing a pilfered bottle of bourbon over a stack of Neil Young and Townes Van Zandt records. ItΓÇÖs hard to deny the thick fog of finger-picked, '70s soft rock that hangs over Paupers Field, but standout cuts -- like the weepy ΓÇ£Emma Hartley,ΓÇ¥ ΓÇ£Low,ΓÇ¥ ΓÇ£Death of Outlaw Billy John,ΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£If the Creek DonΓÇÖt Rise,ΓÇ¥ the latter of which features effortless harmony vocals from none other than Emmylou Harris -- show a great deal of promise, especially when this old soul, saddled with the weight of a young manΓÇÖs preconceptions, finds those ideals both met and shattered.
