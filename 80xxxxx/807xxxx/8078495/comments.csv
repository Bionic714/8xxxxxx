[V],psspss,2013-01-29T07:15Z,"bum so many leechers on it again
wtf"
[V],rr-ne,2013-01-29T07:38Z,hey how do i connect my tpb account with kat
[V],psspss,2013-01-29T07:43Z,:O i seed almost 100 percent i see most one 60 percent
[V],psspss,2013-01-29T07:44Z,"kat normally crawl vip accounts but they dont always link it to your name 

best to just submit to kat first then tpb
if you care about it being under your nicks"
[V],psspss,2013-01-29T07:59Z,"you can also ask any they crawl to be added to your nick just email a mod the hash and if they see its your acct on tpb they will add also

alas thats more work.. quicker to add to both manually as said above"
[V],rr-ne,2013-01-29T08:06Z,so i cant connect?
[V],rr-ne,2013-01-29T08:19Z,What is crawl??
,mikeike65,2013-01-29T08:24Z,"Too many seeds sending bad packets. Fuck that. Just search for E22 and there are way better options.

[V],psspss,2013-01-29T08:38Z,"KAT works ok for me... try https instead or
the com site redirect.. read about it at torrentfreak"
,ElleNnor,2013-01-29T08:40Z,please can you upload Meteorite Men Season 2 and 3..Appreciate everything you have done so far XoXo/ Ellen
[V],psspss,2013-01-29T08:40Z,"bad packets is prob antip2p messing with people

running peer block 1,1?

anyhow many seeders have it now.. so leaving you lot to it while i seed out the diggers 

(crawl= spyder = auto search submissions of vips and auto add to their content)"
[V],psspss,2013-01-29T08:43Z,hmm KAT is running slow now though.. but sort of working might be doing more work on it since the botch up days ago
[V],rr-ne,2013-01-29T10:27Z,"hey how do u get your torrents to show up on both tpb and kat

do you upload the .torrent file to both accounts or does it automtically?"
[V],psspss,2013-01-29T11:41Z,"i have already said above.. but to repeat some of it.. I upload the same torrent to kat first then tpb
else kat will crawl and add automatically since they add vips from tpb to their crawler but they dont end up under your name so hence why I do it manually"
[V],rr-ne,2013-01-29T11:52Z,its very hard to understand what you're saying half the time. you put all your words together and i dont even know half the stuff youre saying
[V],psspss,2013-01-30T00:45Z,"yeh I do seem to have a few typos and truncations.. my eyes arent the best at times.. masses of floaters



"
[V],psspss,2013-01-30T00:47Z,Cant get te font big enough without stuffing up the look of the webpages with more scrolling.. ask tpb a few times to increase the comment font or have a option for it.. guess they dont care about old eyes
[V],psspss,2013-01-30T00:48Z,"also I talk geek or tech... i expect most to understand the terms of the web and video editing and torrenting

and I have to break up a comment cos even not i get DB error message meaning its flagged a word and wont let me post!"
[V],psspss,2013-01-30T00:49Z,hmm i see the + and - quality has vanished perhaps they decided it servers no purpose apart from people flaming it wrongly
[V],psspss,2013-02-12T03:34Z,"i missed getting 23-24 for some readon but
aviguy is doing some and others anyhow
