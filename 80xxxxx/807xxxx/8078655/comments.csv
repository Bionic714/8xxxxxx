,dmlinux,2013-01-31T22:16Z,is this real and cracked?
,Schlotz1016,2013-02-01T00:51Z,The ISO is real but this person did not include the key code so you cannot use it without it.  Anyone have any key codes?
,dmlinux,2013-02-01T06:32Z,i think you can still use it but it wont let u do efile or something i just did skip and skip remind me later and lets you update and do your things :)

,shmendrick,2013-02-02T01:50Z,"sorry, disregard my last comment, it is for 2012."

Works great -- of course there's no efile without a key code, but you can still print and mail your return or just use it to double check your own manual preparation."
