Star.Trek.Enterprise.fanedit.Demons.TerraPrime.Movie.720p

This is a fanedit of the Star Trek Enterprise episodes s4e18 Demons and s4e19 Terra Prime. This two parter has been converted into a single movie *AND* the scenes with just Travis Mayweather and his old girfriend/reporter Gannet Brooks have been removed. Deleting these 9 minutes of Travis does 3 things:
1. improves the pacing of the show
2. does not harm the main plot in any way since his romantic sub-plot is meaningless
3. spares the viewer Anthony Montgomery's totally wooden performance and monotonic dialogue

Final Edit: Handbrake RF=19 1,544,327,030bytes
1h12m29s 1280x720 25fps AVC High@L3.1 2400Kbps, 5.1 48KHz AC3 384Kbps

Changes:
* Removed the breaks for commercials
* Removed most fades before and after commercial breaks
* Raised the volume 3db with no clipping since the source was very quiet
* Changed the opening music to the instrumental "Archer's Theme" instead of the original "Faith of the Heart" which has lyrics
* Moved the s4e20 opening credits to the very start
* Removed the s4e20 closing credits
* Removed the s4e21 opening credits
* Removed all of the one on one scenes with Ensign Travis Mayweather (Anthony Montgomery) and Gannet Brooks (Johanna Watts); 9m5s removed comprising 4 scenes from s4e20 and 2 scenes from s4e21. These scenes are not critical to the plot and Montgomery's acting is jarringly bad. Brooks will appear on the ship at 26m12s as Archer and Reed come to Montgomery's quarters to take her into custody. The fanedit flows perfectly without their scenes and this sub-plot.

Notes:
* There is a small overlay logo in the lower right, it's not very obtrusive like some logos. Nothing can be done for this until the Blu-Ray comes. Tricks to mask logos usually make it more noticeable.
* Big thanks to reliant1 for the 720p 5.1 captures of s4e20 and s4e21.
* The source video looks good but it is not the best so please be patient if the 720p quality isn't the greatest. Once the Blu-Ray is available a pristine fanedit can be done.
