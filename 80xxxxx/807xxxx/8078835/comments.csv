This is clearly up-scaled to 720p from DVD. 
(Why would someone rip a DVD and then encode it to a HD format?) The frame rate looks jerky and sometimes feels like it is being shown at 15 frames per second - much like an old flash animation website. Although because of the great lighting and quality in which the film was made, this release is very watchable and enough to watch on a PC or Tablet, but does not look very good on a 32 inch HDTV. Audio is acceptable with very few lost frequencies in the higher ranges. Audio - 8/10 Video - 7/10"
