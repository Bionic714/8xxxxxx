The Moth is a storytelling organization started in NYC and now spread to other cities. It is basically a forum for people to tell short personal stories to a live audience. They have a podcast that puts out some of the better ones. This torrent contains a few dozen I have saved up from when I listened to it in 2009/2010. They are mostly pretty awesome.
