,tyl3rdurd3n,2013-01-29T11:10Z,It's really not the best time to upload a BR rip of movie from '66 named like one that so many a waiting for. Gets one excited for like half a second after seeing this and then it's disappointment lol. 
,arslanistic,2013-01-29T11:48Z,^ i agree...

,longhigy,2013-01-29T12:48Z,"tyl3rdurd3n 

you dont deserve to watch this movie, if you cant even read 1 sentence.. 

thx for the upload!"
,tyl3rdurd3n,2013-01-29T13:57Z,"@longhigy, @neon: I think you didn't understand what I meant. It's pretty clear, of course, that this isn't Django the 2012, Tarantino version. I was only saying that people are more eagerly awaiting the 2012 release and when you see 'Django' in the list of uploaded movie, you get excited and your thoughts immediately go like 'could it be?!' and then you quickly realize, after paying close attention, 'nope, it isn't that what I thought it was.'  It's like you don't like your hopes getting high for nothing but then there isn't anything uploader can do about that..."
[V],neon,2013-01-29T14:32Z,@tyl3rdurd3n ...i thought the same when i saw the 4GB  django 1966 bluray...i too was a little disappointed :(
,tyl3rdurd3n,2013-01-29T14:59Z,"@neon: So now you know.

Anyway, it's a little crazy on our parts too when we're expecting it this early... I mean there isn't even an Amazon release date yet! We should all forget about that for the moment and enjoy this release. :)"
,RBSNLA,2013-01-30T05:26Z,V=10 A=10 Classico!!!Valeu neon!!!

Obviously...this is the classic original...one of Tarantino's faves.
Which is why he asked Franco Nero to do a cameo in ""Unchained""...

Anyone who's seen ""Unchained"" would be looking for this.

THX...neon..."
,h6sj9gnm7b47,2013-02-15T01:56Z,"Thank you for the upload so much neon.  Wonderful A/V=10 also fast upload for real.  If you like the new Tarantino you must see this, and even if you didn't.  Possibly the most inspirational western ever made.  Neon you deserve a lot of credit for this one."
,bluesborn,2013-03-11T02:41Z,Quit your whining you fools.This is the original classic film.Watch it and learn something about film history.Thanks uploader never mind these pedestrians.
,Scientography,2013-04-14T06:29Z,"excellent quality, thanks. First time I've seen an mp4 file with chapters"
,Herr_Doktor,2013-04-16T06:55Z,Just so you know this is exactly what I was looking for! Thank you for the upload!
