Born on October 19, 1991 in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, singer/songwriter Colton Dixon first caught the public's attention on season 11 of American Idol. The guitar-playing, golden-maned Dixon's soaring vocals and upfront spirituality connected with audiences enough to secure a seventh-place finish, and it didn't take long for the charismatic rocker to land a record deal. The resulting A Messenger, his debut for Sparrow Records, was released in 2013."
