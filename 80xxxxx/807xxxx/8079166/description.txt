Classic Star Wars: The Early Adventures (1994)

Publisher: Dark Horse Comics
Publication Date: August 1994 - April 1995
Country: United States
Language: English 

Notes: 
Dark Horse reprint of Russ Manning's newspaper strips that ran between 1979 and 1980. The Dark Horse name for this series is a little confusing, however, as these aren't particularly the "early adventures". Williamson's newspaper series, as well as some issues of the initial Marvel comic book run, easily pre-date not only the creation date of these strips, but also their place in the Star Wars time line.
These adventures are best placed about a year prior to the opening of Episode V. They are clearly distanced from Williamson's newspaper work, which is best seen as occurring closer to the end of Episode IV.

Since this work was completed at such an early stage in the development of the Star Wars universe as a whole, some parts are dubiously canonical in the light of, say, Episode III.
