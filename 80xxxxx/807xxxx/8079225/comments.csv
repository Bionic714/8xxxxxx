,Dazer12,2013-01-29T18:20Z,"Hey RKSTR!  Just wanted to say a big thanks for uploading the new episode of Drag Race!  I can't watch the show in my country unfortunately, so without your upload I wouldn't be able to see it at all.  

Just curious though, why not upload them in HD?  It's pretty much the only show I can't find in high def and I know it airs in HD on Logo (and on their website, iTunes, and Amazon).  

Would this be possible in the future?  I am more than willing to help with seeding, encoding, etc."
,christianovers,2013-01-29T18:36Z,thank u so much!

,sup1990,2013-01-29T19:20Z,thanks rkstr!
[T],FatFreddy638,2013-01-29T21:50Z,"@Dazer12 - with my limited upload speed it took 3 hours to completely upload this file.An HD file would take what? 6 hours? 8 hours? My connection is currently 512kbps which is only 80 KBps maximum.I have looked into a higher upload speed package and they run a few hundred dollars a month. Of course you don't have to download the files that I share with everyone if they are not to your satisfaction.You can get them from iTunes,Logo or Amazon - not being in the US is no hurdle as I'm not."

,samsworld,2013-01-30T21:49Z,"OMG! I DO READ THE TORRENT DESCRIPTION AND SORRY FOR ALL THE CRACKHEADS THAT HAVE BEEN BOTHERING YOU! hahahah

YOU'RE AWESOME! :)"

,nelleburger,2013-02-01T08:32Z,Aww yeah! Thanks a tonne for this! I was worried no one would upload this season so this is a huge relief.
,eliazar94,2013-02-01T23:33Z,"Can I ask how you got an uncensored version? That's pretty amazing, and if the rest of your Drag Race uploads will be uncensored - I'll make sure to download from you!! :)"
,aino83,2013-02-08T07:36Z,"Thank you SO MUCH for this lower res version. My computer simply cannot playback the higher res versions and this is the favorite show in our household. Due to my connection and shitty comp, we cant even watch it on the logo site!

Thanks again for this version, hope to see the rest of the season from you!"
