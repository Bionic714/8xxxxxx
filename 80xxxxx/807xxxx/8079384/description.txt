And here is one of JJs old works, Hombre.

This is heavy on nudity, which is also why I have not used covers for all 5 previews, due to nudity on them.

A post-apocalyptic series, Hombre is set on Earth after the collapse of the technological civilization. The protagonist moves through the scenery as a disillusioned solitary survivor, with lingering traces of humanity despite the widespread debased nature of most people he encounters. He always has a ragged cigarette in the corner of his mouth, and is often accompanied by a young woman who came of age after the collapse and thus is accommodated to the life of a naked savage. Though the plot is compared with that of Jeremiah, Hombre does not share the underlying motif of hope and survival of mankind of the former.
