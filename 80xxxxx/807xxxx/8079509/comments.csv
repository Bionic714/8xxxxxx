How can anyone encode a 3.8gig 1080p movie in such a choppy format??
The quality of the image is great, but it's useless if the motion of the video is choppy!! (and no, it isn't my player or my GPU, its the actual encoding)

To me, this is unwatchable and a waste of bandwidth. Thank you encoder for your efforts but I hope you learned from this experience how NOT to encode in the future! Always always pick smooth motion over image quality especially in a fast action movie like this."
