I would rather wait for a decent copy, but if your desperate to watch this show...."
,q2323,2013-01-29T15:23Z,"why you quit now? its the end of the season. I think this quality is good enough to enjoy the show.. I was always watching your webrips.. and with my compression, it looks a little bit better than your 170mb files.
thanks for your work beechy"
,beechyboy,2013-01-29T16:16Z,"I just found that most people will wait for the quality HD version to be upped. 
Glad to see that you have uploaded the webrip instead of me because it saves on my bandwidth.
Very seldom do you get a ""Thanks"" anyway like the old Demoniod days...
I know the quality is fair BUT still watchable, so THANKS for the upload q2323."
[T],MrUnpopular,2013-01-29T19:02Z,I take what I can get. :P Thanks.
,studentofmonth,2013-01-30T17:43Z,"Truth be told... I live by beechyboy's torrents. I even search his username to find new and interesting downloads. Hats off to him for all that he has done. I will download this torrent from q3434, but only because of beechyboy's recommendation. 

And THAT is the honest truth."
,beechyboy,2013-01-30T23:15Z,"Thanks for the kind words sudentofmonth.
It's not very often I get a nice complaint as good as yours!
I try and upload reality shows I like that are not uploaded right away by large groups like TvTeam.
I can only upload so much because I have a limited bandwidth every month..."
,q2323,2013-01-31T17:31Z,I cant even imagine me having a limited bandwidth. luckily there is no such a thing here in czech republic.
,livens01,2013-02-01T00:04Z,Thanks for the upload. I usually wait until a HDTV or 720 comes out...
,ps3junkie,2013-02-01T00:21Z,dose this one have the audio off like the last one?
,beechyboy,2013-02-02T00:02Z,Seems like you're the only that was having any problems with the last one....
,beechyboy,2013-02-02T00:05Z,You seem to make the same comment about everything uploaded. My guess the problem is on your end.
,xxsupaxx,2013-02-02T05:42Z,thanks for the upload
