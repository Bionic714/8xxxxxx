,Lobuno,2013-01-29T17:33Z,Nice move!!! :D
,hopedeny,2013-01-29T18:45Z,If you have never played the Penumbra series... PLEASE do not start with this one. Play black plague and overture. The predecessors to Amnesia. This entry is an aberration. Just the fact that they brag about featuring Sum 41 on the box should be a warning sign.

what?"
,Daimon117,2013-01-30T17:14Z,@hopedeny You do realise this game has nothing to do with Penumbra at all right?
,RAMEN00DLE5,2013-02-01T09:19Z,"Damn hopedeny, your right! Who the hell actually admits to knowing those douchebags even in the slightest? Actually, last I heard the singer got stabbed to death in Japan because some japanese guy was so mad that they existed, he thought the only way to stop the anger sharks from swimming in his head was to give the puss a one way ticket off this mortal coil. Bushido style!"
,DarkKlown77,2013-02-01T17:23Z,Wanderer! Thanks so much for the upload!  Any chance we'll see The Settlers 2 10th anniversary edition!?
