The initial material is built from all DVD having clips Nightwish. The best video on quality which wasn't recoded on real bitrate but only if necessary it was leveled maximum, that is installation of the encoder is chosen. Available original LPCM is left, AC3 is replaced with the tracks taken from CD. Menu static.
The received result is checked on working capacity on softovy Media Player Classic Home Cinema, written down on a pig by means of ImgBurn and again checked already on a household player.
