And here you go, Game Over 1-4. The first one is scanlated, 2-4 dont have any text, so they should be readable too .)

GAME OVERs main character is a Barbarian, a video game hero. This virtual hero looks tirelessly for an exit without ever succeeding. When he doesnt wander into an endless labyrinth, he tries in vain to save a clumsy princess, or to escape Blorks, monsters more stupid than evil. A real stylistic challenge : all the jokes end with heros death and a big GAME OVER! Its a modern version of Road Runner & Wile E. Coyote.
