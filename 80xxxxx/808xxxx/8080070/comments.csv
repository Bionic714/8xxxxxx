,arif_2016,2013-02-11T20:00Z,"Great quality, A10 V10 - thnx to the uploader! Movie was also good as i expected it to be! Storyline is intelligent and entertaining and acters were OK! I usually watch all the movies at film.riotintl.com because they have HD's but they didn't have this one so im happy to have piratebay :) Thnx once again for this great share!"

,wolverinex01,2013-02-22T10:45Z,"for idiots like arif_2016 who are rating this torrent as high as a10 v10, I would like to point out that they are misleading people...

Quality of this torrent is a7 v7 (at the most)...it looks and sounds exactly like a good cam version, nothing more or less...

I would not suggest downloading from this torrent as it is a shame to watch such a fine movie on substandard quality"
,hkb_2020,2013-02-24T11:30Z,"This arif_2016 has posted the identical comment in at least 4 different places. For this same movie. wtf?

Oh yeah, ty to redbull!"
,qqqqarl,2013-02-27T16:34Z,"GRRR!!! this is NOT a dvdrip.  it's a cam.

for shame."
