I didn't put this collection together, but I came across it a few days ago and it's too good not to share! From the defunct Elseworlds line of DC Comics, here are over two dozen one-shot and mini-series stories featuring the Justice League. (Kingdom Come, arguably the most famous Elseworlds title, isn't included.)

All credit goes to the original scanners, and to whoever collected and organized these. Please seed and share with our friends here at TPB!  --STFmaryville

In Elseworlds, super-heroes are taken from their usual settings and put into strange times and places - some that have existed, and others that can't, couldn't or shouldn't exist. The result is stories that make characters who are as familiar as yesterday seem as fresh as tomorrow.
