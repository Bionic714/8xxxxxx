Hi, guise!
So, I found these two softwares that will help you rooting your Xperia Play. Remember to update your operating system to 2.3.4! If you want to update it, connect your xperia play to your computer and download Sony PC Companion.

In this pack you have:
1.Easy rooting toolkit v.4.0;
2.Flashtool-drivers.

First, you have to install Flashtool drivers and install the drivers of the phone model YOU HAVE. After that, go to definitions/apps/Devolpment/USB DEP (check that option).

Then, see this tutorial&lt;---
IT's the tutorial for rooting your Xperia play.

Enjoy :)
