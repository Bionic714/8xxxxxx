And here you go, the famous Sambre, by Yslaire.
Sadly, the 5th book is not yet scanlated, neither is the sequel, Sambres War.
Nudity on one of the covers, so used inner cover for preview. This book is like a lot of euro books heavy on nudity.


The main storyline is based on the torturous and condemned love affair between Bernard Sambre, a young man from a bourgeois family in France, and Julie, a beautiful vagabond and daughter of a prostitute, who has red eyes, something that incites fear in many a heart. The series follows the couples descent into despair in the midst of the 1848 revolution in France. Bernard and Julie cannot be together, but cannot be apart, end up finding each other and then leaving each other, willingly or not, time and time again. The drawings are reminiscent of all the19th century had to offer: dark, powerful, romantic, decadent and full of doom, with a touch of hope here and there. Bernard and Julie, as well as the many characters that surround them, are beautifully drawn, and its very easy to fall into their world of fire, pain, love and glory. The drawings are amazing, but the words are just as important in setting the scene and the characters.
