Star Trek Armada 2 is a real time strategy game made by Activision in 2001.  The game is a great RTS game.  The only down side to the game was the graphics were not that great.

Fleet Operations Modification for Star Trek Armada 2 is a total modification.  It does NOT need star trek armada 2 to be installed, just needs the disk in the drive.  It updates the graphics to 2011 standards.  It adds the dominion but removes the cardiassians.

INSTALLATION:
Mount the ISO using Daemon Tools Lite (Freeware - Just Google it).
Once Mounted, run the fleet operations setup file.  DO NOT INSTALL ARMADA 2 FROM DISK.

This is compatible with Windows XP/Vista/7/8 (x86 and x64 editions)

This also removes the single player campaigns from the game, but it gives single player instant skirmishes and it updates multiplayer to work with Windows 7 and Windows 8.  To re-clairify, multi-player WORKS.
