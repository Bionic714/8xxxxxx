~An edit of the Silent Hill 2 video game in theatrical form~

---Information---

Run time is approximately 94 minutes and 11 seconds. It is in 16:9 aspect ratio (widescreen) and is in 720p High Definition. It had some encoding and resampling issues from low bitrate and film grain which ended up permanently making the video slightly blurry during movement, so the quality isn't perfect. It has English, Greek, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, and Traditional and Simplified Chinese subtitles.

A lot of the music was changed to refresh the game and to emphasize certain key moments, like that of a film.

---Credits---

All the credit goes to Team Silent and Konami for publishing this game. I would also like to thank specifically Hiroyuki Owaku for the incredible storyline, Masahiro Ito  for the disturbing creatures and design, Takayoshi Sato for the lifelike characters, Akira Yamaoka for bringing the games to life with his memorable music, and the rest of the staff for making it all happen.
