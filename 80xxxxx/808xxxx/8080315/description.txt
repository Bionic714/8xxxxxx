Orbitals concept is a simple one, easily grasped by readers: in the far future, two agents of a multi-species, galactic organization similar to the U.N deal with problems that could have serious repercussions throughout the confederation of worlds. Caleb, a human from Earth, and Mezoke from Sandjarr, are recent recruits and partners.

Complicating their working relationship is the fact that Earth and Sandjarr were at war for many years. While Runberg doesnt make this the focal point of the duos relationship, the pair have a refreshingly mature attitude toward working together, that history does underlie the series and inform their viewpoints.
