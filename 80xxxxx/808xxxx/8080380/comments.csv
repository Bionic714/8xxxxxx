I mean, I see the skull and everything, so I believe it's legit, but a little help here..."

[V],globeplus,2013-01-29T23:08Z,"Hi fellow piratebay users and this is the only possible cam for the moment for this movie in a pratical video type with positive quality to watch , of course that all of us hope better copys as always soon as possible , this is just the general normality for new movies that means cams possibly first then dvdrips or screeners soon as possible after that ... happy movie to all of you and the most important thing about torrent files is to keep a nice sharing spirit wanting from ourselfs give our best to the pleasure of the possible users ... and yes i forget the indication of the cam but no big deal and probably predictable at this moment in time for the presentation of this movie ... see all of you around and happy movie files ."
