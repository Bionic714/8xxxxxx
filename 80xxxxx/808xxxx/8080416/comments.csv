,bahill818,2013-02-07T03:21Z,"Greetings, while I see you have many fans and you provide excellent explanation of audio I still have a question.  I want 5.1 and can either run through xbox 360 or the preferred way of running through my Apple TV (itunes).  Which way would work best/be the easiest to obtain optimum video/audio quality.  Thanks in advance."
[V],dhjudasx,2013-02-10T18:27Z,bahill... from the few users I've talked to.. xbox360 won't playback the 5.1 audio.... however the apple tv will and it works with the subtitles (at least I've been told)
,randomstr,2013-02-22T13:02Z,Thanks a lot man!

,DontEven,2013-03-15T16:38Z,DO NOT dl this torrent. Marvel is monitoring this torrent for copyright infringement. I just received an email from my isp stating that marvel has contacted them with evidence that my ip address is using illegal dvd.....AGAIN DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT!!!
,DontEven,2013-03-15T16:41Z,DO NOT DOWNLOAD. Marvel is monitoring this torrent and trying to bust people for copyright bs.
[V],dhjudasx,2013-03-17T05:48Z,the hell you talking about donteven?
,Dzte,2013-03-17T11:35Z,@DontEven: what the hell is wrong with you.....crazy dumbo stop bitchin around. 
,eroticburps,2013-03-21T01:06Z,"yes DontEven.. you are right.
the guys from Marvel came over to everyones place and gave us some Marvel Comics.
too bad.. nothing for you"
,swallowswing,2013-03-21T13:20Z,Thanks.
,DontEven,2013-03-22T04:14Z,"I could care less what you little bitches do, i just put the word out that marvel is watching this torrent. maybe you retards should do alittle reading to find that movie companies regularly do this. Thought i explained the situation just fine guess it takes a full brain to understand that there monitoring there investment to stop(try) copyright infringement.  When you connect to this torrent they get your ip and then contact your internet and then they email you a warning....get fucked trolls"
,BigHegz,2013-03-22T11:42Z,"@donteven, why dont you go suck on some troll balls and gtfo here. i would love to castrate you and make you eat your own balls, but im afraid you might like the thought of that. In short..go fuck yourself and take your do gooding spread of thought elsewhere, you faggotstick fucktard rooster testicle eating basil eggplant."

[V],dhjudasx,2013-03-26T00:52Z,"they monitor everything they can... all avengers rips likely....

what haven't they monitored and sent notices to whomever they can about it?

No real need to starting a flame war over it though."

,ryouzanpaku,2013-04-09T12:20Z,"@Judas, I have a problem here. I can't watch the avengers. the video is pixelated. Help me please. Itried it in VLC and Windows player. I have downloaded 3 avengers movie, all of them are like that pixelated/crashing? Is the problem in my video card? but when i play other movies it works fine. Help me please"
,bondai,2013-04-11T08:01Z,How long before I get my Marvel letter? I am so excited.
[V],dhjudasx,2013-04-15T17:53Z,"ryouzanpaku

99% of the time if you have tried other 1080p movies and experience the same issue.. it's due to an insufficient pc unable to handle the processing power required to properly decode..

I've a netbook and some older computers that simply cannot deal with 1080p content from yify or mine or others.. requiring them to have only 72p as it's less demanding..

alternatively... if 1080p did work prior... a video driver update could be required... or you have installed video codec packs that are conflicting...

I highly recommend that codec packs are NOT installed... they cause more havoc than needed.... vlc downloaded all by itself should be sufficient..

you could try windows player classic and see if it resolves it."
,sirwill2,2013-04-18T16:37Z,No problems what-so-ever. movie plays in all of my players.  And I converted it to dvd with no problems!!!  Thanks Judas for the upload
,labmurine,2013-04-22T03:09Z,"Great movie and a great copy of the movie. You can't get better video quality.

Audio quality is not the highest bitrate for AAC but it's still AAC audio so I aint complaining. 

A: 10/10
V: 10/10
M: 10/10

Thank You!"
,storm2012,2013-04-28T00:13Z,What are Marvel going to do take us all to court. i'd like to see that. What you need to watch for is a scam/virus that will block your computer stating that someone like CIA MI5 or in my case AFP has been monitoring your useage & that you must pay a fine. Don't pay if this happens to you. Luckily iknew about this already when it happened to me & was able to fix pretty quick.
,johnj1969,2013-04-30T16:35Z,As usual Judas top rip.. I like the amount of work you put into all aspects of your ULs. The info pages with the unicorn are brilliant..Keep it up as long as you can. A10-M10 ;)

Thanks for the comment..

But i'd like to reiterate that different profiles and formats of the AAC standard have very different impacts on audio quality/reproduction and accuracy.

I had spent a fair bit of time and several encoding methods to try and determine the best options at the highest compression to quality ratios with ever attempt to prevent anomalies or loss of quality.

Majority of all the Encoded movies I set that provide 2 channel or 6 channel AAC use AAC/LC which LC refers to LOW Complexity, It's basically simplistic and best suited for 64kbps and under bitrates... definitely not idea for quality Audio and testing has shown that at high bitrates, audio continues to suffer greatly. LC is ideal for low end devices as well as it's very simple to decode requiring no significant resources/cpu time.

However a HE-AAC/LC v2+ (2006/2009) standard (the format I use) is a All round Combination. This format is the most complex, highest demand of all audio formats currently. It needs a fair bit more power to decode accurately. It also allows for backward capability switching to pure LC when the machine it's played on is lacking necessary resouces to properly decode at high quality. But the most ideal thing is that it splits up audio encoding/decoding in a manner that produces the highest level of audio quality/reproduction and accuracy from a source into the smallest bitrate.

My encoding standards use a 2 pass encoding method as well using Loose bitrate settings. While I plug in and show a 192kbps bitrate for the 6 channel audio, it is commonly MUCH higher than that if it has determined that the bitrate is insufficient to reproduce the source accurately enough.

This movie for example has an average bitrate of 224kbps with it peaking quite often at 276kbps. (obviously CLEARLY well over 192kbps). The reproduction level of quality/accuracy is equivalent to DTS/AC3 @ 448-640kbps. Not bad considering a significantly LOWER file size footprint at pretty much identical quality.

An Audiophile would be hard pressed to tell the difference."
,AriEsta,2013-05-04T10:21Z,"I have tried the following to load the subtitles for the Russian part of the movie. I'm using VLC v2.0.6. Any advice?

* Rightclick -> subtitles -> tried track 1, track 2, and manually opening the file
* OSD is set up and active (movie title plays when starting video)
* Googled ""vlc srt subtitles"" and tried various suggestions."

Fast and safe download. Thanks!"
,kst0ne,2013-05-09T09:32Z,my source of 1080p movies. Perfect!
[V],dhjudasx,2013-05-09T19:31Z,"AriEsta

The Russian subtitles (which are only at the start of the film I believe) are not created separately, there should only be 1 subtitle track for this unless you downloaded another from somewhere.. in which case they have to match properly.

Sorry when I do subtitles, it is for the ENTIRE movie. And unless they are already hardcoded, I do not try to hardcode them. There are several places you can get subtitle SRT files from that provide only subtitles for certain dialogue. Subscene.com for one."
,Helneb,2013-05-24T12:40Z,"Hye, I saw you did a great job with bd rip, and please could you have the possibility to put more language and subtitles in your files ? Please.

Thanks "
[V],dhjudasx,2013-05-30T08:55Z,I can't really provide more subtitles because I only know of the English language... so I can't confirm others... it'd be like having a arts teacher trying to correct or confirm a quantum mechanics paper.... things might look right.. doesn't mean it is.
