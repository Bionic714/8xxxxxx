Yeah, people generally won't comment unless there is a problem! SO if it's an old torrent with no comments, then it's means it great. If it were NOT to be good, someone would have cursed!

Just keep the chess books coming and enjoy the silent appreciation :-)

Lot of respect for your work,
Shah Jahan."
