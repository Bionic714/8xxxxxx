DmC: Devil May Cry (c) Capcom

      1 :.......... DISC(S) .. GAME.TYPE ........: Action


Detailing Dante's early years and set against a contemporary backdrop,
DmC Devil May Cry will retain the stylish action, fluid combat and
self-assured protagonist that have defined the iconic series but
inject a more brutal and visceral edge.

The Dante of DmC is a young man who has no respect for authority or
society in general. Dante knows that he is not human, but also that he
is not like the demons that have tormented him throughout his life.
Caught between worlds, he feels like an outcast

He is now discovering and coming to terms with what it means to be the
child of a demon and an angel. This split personality has a real impact
on gameplay with Dante being able to call upon angel and demon abilities
at will, transforming his Rebellion sword on the fly to dramatically
affect both combat and movement
