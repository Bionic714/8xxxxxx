,gamesrfun,2013-01-30T06:38Z,"@TehDoctor That's correct, it's a ""gameplay video"" as stated in the description.  The beta is now closed down, so not even beta participants can play it anymore.

Also keep in mind, in this video the graphics settings are set to approx medium to keep the recording smooth.  It can look better than this."
,Cool7days,2013-02-16T15:13Z,"Thanks, mate!"
,samljer,2013-02-25T00:13Z,"@TehDoktor

DERP!!!!!!

Says right in the description its a video.
Either RTFM or stay in  bed."
,samljer,2013-02-25T00:14Z,"@TehDoktor
Also ""GAMEPLAY""
in the title is a give away.
the few idiots that assume its the full game
deserve the waste time; TPB is getting stupider members by the minute...

,weltall2,2013-02-27T17:06Z,"Thank you so much for this. Its a really nice video and its the first video I actually tried to watch. It is really nice to see that this is not like SimCity societies but actually it is like the other simcities. Not that I did not like SimTown, but it never was as good as SimCity for me."
,jpweb72,2013-03-04T23:45Z,"sorry to post this but did you take the simcity 5 sidkrow and reloaded ofline i cant find it anywhere at it was on 30 minutes ago 

ps i stil downloading it"
,Deeh1901,2013-03-05T18:38Z,Is anyone going to upload the game?
,dextra,2013-03-05T23:05Z,"jpweb72 if they are offline it usually means that they were fake malware.
the fact there are no other simcity torrents around emphasize this assumption.
i suggest you immediately stop downloading those torrents unless you wanna catch some viruses..."
,jpweb72,2013-03-06T02:12Z,yhe you are right i just wanna play the new simcity is my favorite genre of games i hope they post the game tommorow
,TheOuterOne,2013-03-06T15:30Z,That's not actually true. You were allowed to upload videos about SimCity Beta from 1 February 2013
,Kamadas,2013-03-07T05:50Z,"Get games only from skull uploaders. 
Tks for the video."
,Dexric,2013-03-11T22:42Z,COMMENTS APPEAR!
,MasterNoone,2013-03-30T19:24Z,"Could someone with the original game...install the game in a virtual machine, login (with offline mode, because of the timeout) save the machine state with the game opened and logged in and then change password (for your own safety) and share the vm files with us here on tpb? That way we all could play and save the game using the ""save state"" feature on vmware....Please I know it's asking for much but that would give everyone a chance of trying the game....If you can't do it please let this request be heard to someone who does."
