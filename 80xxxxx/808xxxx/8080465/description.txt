EA won't let gameplay videos of the new SimCity beta stay on YouTube for very long, so here it is. This is just a full-length gameplay of the beta (45-minutes), no commentary. I think I played well but it's hard when they only give you an hour per session.

As always, seed and comment on quality for others.

Thanks!
