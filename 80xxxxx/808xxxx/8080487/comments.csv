A video clearly backed by some vaccination / pharma company.

A lot of buildup, showing how easy it is to get virus, but it doesn't deliver on the title ""how to beat them"" other than closing with the last 10 minutes pitching the importance of vaccines.

Offered absolutely no information on actually how to maintain health and build your immune system.

Good viewing if you're a muppet and like injecting mercury."
