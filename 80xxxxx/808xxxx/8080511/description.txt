And here you go, Frezzatos amazing The Keepers of the Mazer. Bunny scanned 1-4 from teh Heavy Metal books, 5-7 is compilations from Heavy Metal magazine.

Fango lives alone on an island, the only survivor, or so he thinks, of a disastrous civil war on Kolony, his only companion a teaching robot. His life will be changed when an old man, Zerit, and his daughter Erha unexpectedly show up on the way to find the Tower, the former base of civilization on the hostile and largely uncharted planet. But Zerit isnt the only one who wants to reach the tower and its technological treasure. Others want to reach it too; after all, the best way to ensure you will be on top in the new civilization is to rebuild it yourself.

During their adventures, Fango, Zerit, and Erha encounter old friends and new foes. But things arent always what they seem, and old secrets may be revealed that will change peoples allegiances. What is Zerits quest really about? Did civilization survive in the Tower? If so, can the scattered survivors find it, overcome old grievances and rebuild civilization? And what is the link between the tower and the Zoks, the huge fishlike native lifeforms that inhabit Kolonys seas?
