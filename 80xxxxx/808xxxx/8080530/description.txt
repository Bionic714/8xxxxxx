Stuart Moxham was a driving force in the critically worshipped lo-fi, low-volume pioneering Welsh cult band Young Marble Giants. When they fell apart in 1980, his next project, The Gist, was widely perceived as a disaster. Indeed, even Moxham himself professes an abiding dislike of Embrace the Herd. ΓÇ£ItΓÇÖs a symbol of my misery and lack of direction at that time. ThereΓÇÖs very few lyrics on it, for example, because I had nothing to say.ΓÇ¥

Even so, tucked away among a sequence of Eno-esque instrumentals resembling spaced-out indicental music for The Magic Roundabout, are a fistful of treasures that could hardly be more ripe for rediscovery.

While mainstream pop taste had descended as far as Renee & Rentao, Kajagoogoo and Duran Duran, The Gist took YMG as a foundation on which to build a new house, offering oblique snapshots of an altogether more intriguing and infinitely more British alternative pop universe, where the mannered folk whimsy of Jake Thackray collided with the intellect of Brian Eno in George ClintonΓÇÖs back garden.
