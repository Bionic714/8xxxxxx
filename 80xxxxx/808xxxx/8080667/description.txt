From Examiner.com:

Titan Comics has announced that they have launched the first comic, digitally, in their tie-in series based on the recently released Capcom title, "DmC: Devil May Cry."

The new "DmC: Devil May Cry" released in stores for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 on Jan. 15, 2013. The series follows a young and angry, more emo, Dante as he comes to terms with what it means to be the child of a demon and an angel. Not to worry though, the game still retains the mix of sword and gunplay that gamers are all familiar with.

"DmC: Devil May Cry ΓÇô The Chronicles of Vergil #1," written by Guillaume Dorison and illustrated by Robin Recht and Patrick Pion, is available now digitally and takes place before the game, revealing the backstory of Dante's twin brother Vergil and Kat. A print version of the comic is expected to be available May 15, 2013 with issue #2 to follow June 19, 2013.
