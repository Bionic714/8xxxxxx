,ClipperCigars,2013-01-30T06:32Z,"Thanks, but no thanks. I'll wait for an actual scene or any other unknown indy or p2p release. 

Dagger should have had the living shit beat out of them and been run out of town years ago and deserves no recognition. 

Dagger is great at bashing the official scene.
Dagger is great at refusing to make proper nfo's.
Dagger is great at releasing games that either don't work at all or work just enough to make you think you can play it only to have it crap out at the end. 

Dagger should kept their 4/1/2008 promise that ""Mana Khemia"" would be their last release. We'd all be better off. "

Thanks for the upload Dagger."
,endo602,2013-02-02T15:26Z,I find it funny how many of you fools come on here and bitch and moan and complain.  Shut the fuck up.  Is it really that hard? You're getting free shit so just be thankful.
