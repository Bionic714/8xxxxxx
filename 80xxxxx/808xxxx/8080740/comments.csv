,tinyuk,2013-01-29T21:09Z,Woop Woop! I am off to download some apps now! Can anyone recommend any decent ones?
,Kimmel,2013-01-29T22:38Z,Can you upload the Mac-version too - or just link to it..?! =)
,luisny12,2013-01-30T00:34Z,"this is fake don't download 
"
,biofan234,2013-01-30T03:21Z,is this shit fake? 
,bambong,2013-01-30T05:30Z,they haven't it yet.
,biofan234,2013-01-30T05:58Z,so for the few that have downloaded this is it legit?
,pryingeyes,2013-01-30T18:27Z,"NO! This is NOT legit! Do you really think that when this is released, you're going to find out about it HERE? Don't be a moron, and don't download this. The software has not been released -- ETA is roughly this coming Sunday.

If you're seeding this, STOP! God knows what it is, and you don't want to find out."
,tinyuk,2013-01-31T18:10Z,"Wankers! How can you even think this would be real you douche bags! kin ell! 
It is a real jailbreak though! for 5.x!!!

LOSERS! 

Buy the apps instead of being so desperate to download them!"
,NineNinjas,2013-02-01T00:53Z,"@tinyuk you are so ignorant if you think that's why everyone jailbreaks.
the main repo for free downloaded ios apps installous has been taken down. "
,pryingeyes,2013-02-01T00:57Z,"Uh, TinyUK, take your sh*t elsewhere. Yes, this is fake -- just as fake as the different version you just uploaded. Mods, this file needs to be deleted, as does the one that the moron TinyIK uploaded a few hours ago. And while you're at it, how about banning him? He more than deserves it."
,TRoN_1,2013-02-02T02:02Z,"Ya, tinydick, get lost."
,NineNinjas,2013-02-04T01:28Z,"@TRoN_1

LMAO!"
,herbert talabis,2013-02-04T08:57Z,"The title is misleading. Though it is real, only ios 5.1.1 is supported not 6.1."
