,ericangel,2013-01-30T04:00Z,NOT TEGAN AND SARA
,bhc1999,2013-01-30T04:48Z,This is definitely Tegan and Sara...love their new stuff....
,l3endik,2013-01-30T09:36Z,"No, I do not include videos in my torrents."
,DMaur94,2013-01-30T19:02Z,"Great album, great quality! thanks!"
,firexninja,2013-01-31T05:48Z,thank you!
[V],politux,2013-01-31T17:07Z,Transcoded lossy 256 kbps m4a to 320 kbps MP3.  Anything sourced from iTunes will not be a true 320 MP3 but a lossy to lossy transcode.  This increases size but not quality.
,l3endik,2013-02-01T08:32Z,"Ok, get lost now."
[V],politux,2013-02-02T02:08Z,I guess the truth hurts. Shame foolish downloaders don't understand.
[V],politux,2013-02-02T02:17Z,"Every time you encode with a lossy encoder, the quality will decrease. There's no way to gain quality back even if you transcode your 128kbps MP3 into a 320kbps MP3 (or any other high-quality compression).
Transcoding between lossy formats is therefore generally not recommended. The sound quality of the result will always be worse than the (lossy) source file. Reasons to use this approach anyway could be:
Lowering the bitrate or changing the format for use in portable players, for which a listener may not care so much about sound quality.
Saving storage space. Raw CD-audio data is about 1411 kbps (605 MB per hour); lossless encoders achieve around 700 kbps (300 MB/h). Lossy encoders such as Vorbis, MPC, and AAC achieve transparency for most people at 150--170 kbps (69 MB/h). For MP3 (with the LAME encoder), transparency is usually achieved around 192 kbps (82 MB/h). For a large music collection, this could make a significant difference in disk space as compared to lossless archiving.
Lossy transcoding has been discussed in a few forum threads:"
[V],HobbitTunez,2013-02-02T02:24Z,"he's right, not true 320kbps CBR. none of your torrents are. all shit itunes rips..

this is 256kbps MP3"
,l3endik,2013-02-03T14:18Z,"Politux; Get a life and stop wasting your time on people who doesn't give two shits about what you have to say.

HobbitTunez; You're just mad because no one wanna download your torrents."
,spellingd,2013-02-18T18:56Z,"256kbps, just don't incorrectly advertise it as 320kbps and nobody will have a problem."
,OrangeX,2013-02-26T12:29Z,"Thanks l3endik great job!

Don't let them get you down either, they don't even list their source. It's could be MP3 to FLAC (eww!)"
,zackaryry,2013-05-03T00:17Z,lol don't be mad cause you listed it wrong
