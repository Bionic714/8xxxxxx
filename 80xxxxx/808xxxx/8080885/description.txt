In the TOWNSCAPE collection, Bilal and Christin give their unique fantasy treatment to three small communities. In THE TOWN THAT DIDNT EXIST, a small town fallen on hard times is revitalized by the unusual vision of an insightful young woman. SHIP OF STONE is the story of a fishing village and a local ghost as they confront a group of unscrupulous property developers. THE CRUISE OF LOST SOULS tells the tale of a mysterious military device and its surprising effects on a remote farming town. Each story presents a timeless tale set in the trappings of the present, with a yearning towards the fables of yesterday.
