 The ladies head to Vegas to find empowerment through pole dancing.
 PREMIERE: Monday January 28, 9 pm

When Kyle's daughter Sophia graduates from sixth grade, Adrienne and Paul make an appearance, still keeping their distance from the rest of the group. Kim is not in attendance, and Kyle won't learn until later that her sister is planning to have a nose job. Brandi and the ladies head for Vegas where Brandi is practicing to host events that empower women -- through pole dancing. But before the women hit the pole, they have a surprisingly eye-opening dinner and learn things they never knew about each other.

****Seriously!! If people cannot wait more than few hours for a TV show to be uploaded then you need to get a life and leave me alone.Some behavior I have experienced in the last few hours makes me want to quit doing this completely.Think about that next time you feel you have to leave random comments all over the place.I'm just as frustrated as you are but nagging me with private messages and comments everywhere is only going to aggravate me.****
