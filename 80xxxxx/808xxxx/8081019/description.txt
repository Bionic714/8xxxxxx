This torrent fills a request for Ahlat.

This torrent contains all 5 issues of the 2010-2011 Marvel miniseries, I Am an Avenger.

It's an anthology title, with rotating heroes including the popular, 12-titles-a-month guys like Wolverine and Spider-Man, and lesser-known characters like Stature, Justice and Firestar, and even Stingray. It also has stories explaining / expanding the abrupt appearances of Nova (in Secret Avengers vol. 1 #1) and Squirrel Girl (in New Avengers vol. 2 #7).

Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning wrote the Nova-Spidey teamup, Greg Rucka wrote a Cap story, and Mike Mayhew turned in gorgeous art for the 24-page Justice-Firestar serial.

From Comic Vine:

This miniseries is a collection of short stories, both serious and funny, focusing on a variety of characters who have been involved with the Avengers at one time or another.

The most interesting read is the story "Closure" that takes place in #2-#4, in which the former couple Firestar and Justice are forced to team up with their younger versions (who are still a couple) in order to stop Loki from ripping apart the timestream.

All credit goes to the original scanners -- in this case it was Minutemen-MinaHarker for issues 2-5 and an unknown hero for issue 1.
