Am I just stupid or is this a bug? :p"
,TheDragonReborn26,2013-01-30T02:04Z,"You're probably not stupid, just making a mistake. I'll let you know how it goes for me after I DL."
,TheDragonReborn26,2013-01-30T02:33Z,"Yeah dude, I don't know what's going wrong for you. Works fine for me.

Run the setup.exe and you're good to go."
,Mikolz,2013-01-30T02:56Z,Will this work over hamachi I wonder?
,Strafe888,2013-01-30T03:29Z,Does it work over Tunngle* is the question. =p
,Acentiger,2013-01-30T06:09Z,"Apparently I just failed miserably... Works now though, so thanks! :>"
,Aredyn,2013-01-30T18:26Z,It has LAN so it should work on Tunngle.
,Hajeil,2013-01-30T23:57Z,Special Edition? This game just came out yesterday. There is no DLC yet. I've looked at the official website and Steam and there is no mention of any DLC being available. Perhaps they got a leak of it? I see the uploader is a trusted uploader so I'm not trying to 5h1t on him personally. But I'm steering away from this file since I see no official talk at all about any type of special edition or DLC. Thank you for your work though.
,SSJASON,2013-01-31T11:19Z,@Hajeil yes there is DLC it was a bonus for preorder. I have it on my Steam account
,crit-mv,2013-01-31T17:49Z,"Hello boys and girls,

My name is Mark and I am one of the developers at Critical Studio.

We thank you for your interest in our game, and hope that, after having a chance to try a pirate version, you decide to buy it.

The game is currently available for $9.99 on Steam and several digital retailers, which is certainly not much.

We'll also keep updating and patching, we'll release a lot of additional content for free. If you are playing a pirated version, you will most likely be missing out in bug fixes and features.

This is also our first game. We are a small team of 11 people from Rio, Brazil, and the success of this game decides our future and our ability to keep making games (and keep making content for Dungeonland).

So, once again, thank you for your interest in our game. We hope you have fun, and we hope you choose to support us by buying a legitimate copy.

//The Critical Studio Crew"
