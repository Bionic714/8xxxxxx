A theme park is a magical place reserved only for children, right? Wrong. DEAD wrong. Dungeonland redefines the idea of having "fun" in a fantasy theme park as it attempts to entrap your heroes and let them line up for their demise. Playing as the Rogue, the Warrior, or the Mage, heroes will adventure in a classic co-op dungeon crawl, with a sinister twist: three players can play as the daring heroes, while a fourth takes on the role of Dungeonland's Game Master, using a pool of traps and monsters to annihilate their unwelcome guests! Featuring hero customization, looting and dozens of items, Dungeonland is an amoral, atypical take on asymmetric gameplay.
