Conehead Buddha has been gracing the east coast with great original music since 1993. Blending various styles from rock, to Latin funk and ska, they have truly defied the boredom arrived from listening to bands whose songs all start to sound the same. When playing live, the band often opens up the songs to spontaneous improvs, giving them much credibility in the jam/groove scene.

Album Description

By far, Conehead Buddha's most ska-like recording, this album was the band's first full length release. Although not a favorite of the band, this has been a strangely popular favorite amoungst the fans. Recorded in 1995 with Dave Cook, and Gary Burke (engineer and producer respectively)the album hit the college radio charts and stayed there for a solid year.
