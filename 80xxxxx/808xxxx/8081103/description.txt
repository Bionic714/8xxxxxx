Timeless. ItΓÇÖs something every artist wants to be, but few earn the distinction. Charlie WilsonΓÇÖs name is on that short list.

From his breakout as a member of the Gap Band (ΓÇ£You Dropped A Bomb On Me,ΓÇ¥ ΓÇ£OutstandingΓÇ¥) in the ΓÇÿ80s to his revered solo recordings (2005ΓÇÖs certified gold Charlie, Last Name Wilson, 2009ΓÇÖs Grammy nominated Uncle Charlie), Wilson has sold millions of albums, inspired a throng of artists who modeled their vocal stylings after his (most notably Aaron Hall and R. Kelly) and cemented his status as a musical icon with accolades from Billboard and BET, among a host of others.

I have always loved the group the GAP BAND and always liked the lead singers voice: Charlie Wilson. Here for 2013 is Charlie Wilson's latest CD called Charlie Wilson, Love Charlie. Hope you all enjoy
