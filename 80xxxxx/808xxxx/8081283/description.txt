Recorded live some time in the 1970's at Tonkraft Radio studios, Sweden.

Extremely rare bootleg, even in Sweden! This is some really good and lengthy psychedelic folk rock stuff. 


Sorry no coverart and info - just that:

Archimedes Arbete and Fritid played in one studio of Tonkraft radio that music and it was recorded on tape after years one from Tonkraft ripped the Tape and started sending it on cd-rs here is a copy of it in 96 kbps AAC (mp4).
