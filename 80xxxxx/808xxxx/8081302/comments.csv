,TaleMunja,2013-01-30T09:50Z,It's a solid quality-not a cam. It's very watchable.
,silentinquiry,2013-01-30T18:17Z,This should be interesting. It's in FLV format....
,silentinquiry,2013-01-30T18:50Z,"He's right, good quality A/V. Trouble is, its a copy of the ""Hive-cm8 Edition"" versionthat has that watermark plastered all over it, front, middle and end, Oh well"
,TaleMunja,2013-01-31T02:12Z,"Hm, not the case on this one. No any watermark all the time during watching. 

 I tested on BS, KM and GOM player but simply best quality&smoothness is on VLC for this type of file."

,itsJLSantos,2013-02-10T09:19Z,I'm looking for only 1 file. This should be perfect.
