Among recent concerns about the use of nonrenewable fuels such as oil and coal, scientists have been trying to discover alternative ways of making energy and electricity available. Sunlight is a free, unlimited resource that hits the Earth with more energy in an hour than the people of the world use in a year. 

 The colorful "How Do Solar Panels Work?" reveals how researchers are working on ways to harness the power of sunlight through solar panels and delves into the science behind these panels.
