A sea without end, from the islands where since always build themselves then disappear from civilizations: Askell. Here, of the boats of thousand kinds furrow the primal ocean, in spite of the monsters which at every moment can emerge from the floods and crush the hulls. Merchants and smugglers unload in each port, of the invaluable cargoes come from the most remote archipelagoes. It is on board a modest vessel theatre that the chance joined together Cybil, the voluptuous erotic dancer. CAD X ian, the mercenary, Brumaire, the launcher of knives, Keresquin the Poet and Tittle foam, for a series of fantastic adventures where the action, the charm and humour are been useful by sumptuous graphics of Jean-Louis Mourier.
