,e_t_d_x,2013-01-31T07:52Z,"I have a question bruss.aka.durka9:
I'm using a previous version of yours, 2.1.1.5 specifically and every time that you update the game i' m just running the updater.Is that right or it's better to download the new torrent every time?
I'm asking that cause your 2.1.1.5 package is more stable by my experience (i had some minor sound problems at some campaigns, just before calling the rescue, at 2.1.18 and crushing problems, every time i finished a campaign in 2.1.1.9!I didn't see anyone else to mention that before, so maybe it's a personal issue, i really don't know...).
Anyway thank you very much for your great work and commitment to the community!!!! :D"

,Lionboy_91,2013-02-05T15:55Z,"Hey Bruss, nice torrent, but I have a problem.
Installed it perfectly and updated, but I can't seem to open the console. Help me please?"
[T],bruss.aka.durka9,2013-02-05T16:42Z,"to Lionboy_91
Impossible. Console enable by default."
,Lionboy_91,2013-02-05T17:16Z,"This command in game chat ("";con_enable 1; bind F8 toggleconsole;) worked to get console up, I tried to play in split screen and the game just shut itself down? Any suggestions on how to play split screen?
Thanks :)"
[T],bruss.aka.durka9,2013-02-05T18:54Z,"to Lionboy_91
What is split screen?"
,Lionboy_91,2013-02-05T21:29Z,"I got it to work after a few hours of tweaking, what I meant with split screen was like this in the link "" http://www.vgblogger.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/25/MotorStorm2-SplitScreen.jpg "", 
2 sides on the same display for each player. 
I am playing L4D2, 2 player offline together with a friend on the same computer with 2 xbox 360 controllers.

Thank you for a very great torrent! Now I will enjoy this finally :D"

[T],bruss.aka.durka9,2013-02-15T05:20Z,"to CrackaBeTrippin
You must use only ""Servers"" in main menu to search multilayer games. 
Top menu only for steam/license player or only for single-player games."
,Brokakoxi,2013-02-16T17:05Z,multiplayer on lan?

Off antivirus --> run updater --> run Name Changer with administrator privileges --> enjoy.

to wheresmydinner
Off antivirus --> run updater --> off steam --> run game with administrator privileges --> enjoy."
,Nutzu3650XL,2013-02-17T20:27Z,"Dude, after I updated it and I click start on the updater it does nothing!
And when I check for the Left_4_Dead_2.exe (Not the left4dead2.exe) It's not there!
The crack is not there! And when I try opening up from the original left4Dead2.exe It says I don't have steam on!
I turned off all antivirus and firewall, ran with all adminstrator privilages but the same thing!
Please help!"
[T],bruss.aka.durka9,2013-02-17T21:55Z,"to Nutzu3650XL
Off antivurus --> reinstall game --> run updater --> run game."
,Nutzu3650XL,2013-02-23T17:33Z,"Okay, reinstalled windows and it works just fine!
But, no servers show up in the browser under the internet tab. I can only play on steam group servers (Around 100) but I wan't to know if you could play on all of them?"
[T],bruss.aka.durka9,2013-02-23T17:59Z,"to Nutzu3650XL
Use custom tab."
,domints,2013-03-03T10:06Z,Will this work using GreenLuma to play with friends like on legit steam?

[T],bruss.aka.durka9,2013-03-11T06:02Z,"to alonso12
You must run game: with admin privileges ""Start Menu > Programs > Strogino CS Portal > Left 4 Dead 2 > Left 4 Dead 2"" link or with admin privileges on desktop ""Left 4 Dead 2"" link."
,alonso12,2013-03-11T06:51Z,how do you do that? i'm the admin of the computer. can you make a video 4 me please ? 
[T],bruss.aka.durka9,2013-03-11T11:51Z,"to alonso12
No video. Search in google: howto run application with admin privileges."
,alonso12,2013-03-11T23:42Z,that doesnt work! I did all eight ways that it told me to do 4  i could run it like a admin. is there a other program that it suppose to run with? or did it install wrong?
