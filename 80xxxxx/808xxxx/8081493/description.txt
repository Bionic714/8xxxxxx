Eurythmics were a British music duo consisting of members Annie Lennox and
David A. Stewart, now disbanded but known to reunite from time to time. Stewart
and Lennox were both previously in the bands The Catch and The Tourists. Their
musical style ranged from new wave and synthpop to pop rock and soft rock.
Eurythmics originally came together in 1980 and disbanded in 1990. They
reunited in 1999 and split again in 2005. The duo released their first album,
In the Garden, in 1981 to little fanfare, but went on to achieve global success
with their second album Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This), released in 1983. The
title track was a worldwide hit, topping the chart in various countries
including the US.
