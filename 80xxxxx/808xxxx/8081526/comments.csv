,mi.tom,2013-01-30T06:09Z,Thanx for imax version bro...Please upload tdkr in imax version too and mission impossible 4 imax version if possible.
[V],dhjudasx,2013-01-30T07:44Z,"TDKR is actually currently priming on the seed... will likely be up on tpb within the next 24 hours

The only thing holding me back is the lackluster seeders.... I've upped nearly 16gb of TDK and i'm the only bloody one still seeding.. which means.. I can't upload anything else until someone takes over.

doing just basic math.. there must be at least 30+ people out there that likely have it entirely.. but no one wants to seed?

If people don't share the load... I won't be able to do this."

[V],dhjudasx,2013-03-12T22:00Z,"It's been reported that SOME media players do not properly seperate the audio tracks resulting in both tracks overlapping/playing at the same time.

The most recent report was a Quicktime user.

There were some tricks to make it work properly... but you might have to try and find another media player that actually follows the MP4 standards and knows how to playback one or the other audio tracks instead of both at the same time."
