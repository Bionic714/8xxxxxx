Once upon a time (in the late 60s) in America, there was a record industry where executives had no idea what was going on, like all other times. What was different about this magical era was that these executives let the creative people at their labels do whatever they wanted. It must have seemed to the cloth-eared money men that any crazy acid tinged far out platter might sell, or might not...who could tell the difference? So, they just let the producers and arrangers and songwriters make whatever kind of mad racket they saw fit, then put it out and see what happens! From this situation came "song cycle", "white light/white heat", "uncle meat", "the marble index", "trout mask replica" (released on the same label and day as this LP) and many other shiny gems of blatant unsellability. There would never be a time again when a major label would be apathetic enough to release records like this on such a wide scale. One of these labels was warner brothers, and of all the wild and wonderful albums released on their various subsidiaries (bizarre/straight/reprise) in the late sixties, "farewell aldebaran" is one of the most wild and wonderful of all.

Picking up from where the Notorious Byrd Brothers had abandoned the psychedelic-folk-rock road for the straight ahead country-rock path, (then) husband and wife team Judy Henske and Jerry Yester took us just a little further into the American folk past and future
