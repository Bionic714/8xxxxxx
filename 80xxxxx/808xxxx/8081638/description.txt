Asked what she had been doing in the 16 years since her previous album, Iris DeMent replied drolly: "I painted the living room a lot of different colours."
The 51-year-old from Arkansas released her last album of original material in 1996 with The Way I Should and she returns in fine style with Sing The Delta. The songs on her new album grow richer and more rewarding the more you hear them.
DeMent comes from a musical family and says she got from her religious parents that "music was something to lean on". The songs about her early childhood in Arkansas - where she would sometimes attend a Pentecostal church seven days a week - are tales of love and pained stories of death and faith questioned. DeMent says that it "scares her what an awesome thing it is to wrote songs and put your heart out there" and that's why she writes so little. But it's something to savour when she does.
Her songwriting has always been complex - Our Town and Easy's Gettin' Harder Every Day from the 1990s are two of the strongest country songs of that decade - and reaches new levels of poignancy on the sorrowful Morning Glory.
