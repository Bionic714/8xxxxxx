A tale of wicked stepmothers and dubious meat pies, Emily PortmanΓÇÖs Stick Stock ΓÇô from her 2010 debut album The Glamoury ΓÇô was a brilliantly dizzy fairytale. Its dark comic genius deservedly bagged a BBC Folk Awards nomination.
On second album Hatchling, Portman spins similar stories. Themes of heady mythology dominate, with doves pecking at breasts, wild wolves at doors and deranged goddesses aplenty.
Eight of these fables are self-penned. Opener Hatchlings is the best. A powerful song rooted in the Greek myth of Leda and the Swan, Portman portrays the new mother of egg-hatched twins with fearful pride. The banjo on the track is quietly unsettling, perfectly matching the songΓÇÖs paradoxical themes of maternal instinct and revulsion.
Also exemplary on this album are three fragmentary interludes of ancient lullaby ΓÇô Hushabye Birdie, Silver Swan and, especially, Black Sheep. All are unaccompanied, and PortmanΓÇÖs pure vocals mesh with two other fine singers, Lucy Farrell and Rachel Newton. Their voices work in an almost primeval way; the witches of Macbeth could hardly sound eerier. The longer traditional, Hollin, also has something of this chant atmosphere, albeit one textured with harp and strings.
Unfortunately, PortmanΓÇÖs traditional interpretations highlight the diminishing returns of her own songs as the album wears on. Themes get repetitive, especially when taken in the context of her first album. The carnivalesque literature of Angela Carter is an acknowledged influence, but while PortmanΓÇÖs lyrics offer similar imagery, they lack CarterΓÇÖs radical bite.
Portman simply comes across as too darn nice. ItΓÇÖs a problem that seeps into her delivery and arrangements, too. The words may tell of ΓÇ£vodka, and wine, and blood in the gutters,ΓÇ¥ but it sounds as if Portman would rather have a cup of tea and an early night.
This is an album, sadly, that shows little growth from her debut. PortmanΓÇÖs concerns are not developed enough for true conceptual unity, nor do they offer a satisfying diversity. WhatΓÇÖs left is a frustrating piece, an album that ΓÇô despite its lyrical claims to the contrary ΓÇô watches the giddy lights of the fairground from a safe distance.
