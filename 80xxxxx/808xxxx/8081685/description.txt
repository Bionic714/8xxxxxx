The continent-spanning city of North Am is a miracle of ingenuity and ambition, a technological paradise where milespires pierce the clouds and robots perform virtually all labor, freeing humankind to pursue leisure and bliss. But in the shadows of the sun-drenched towers, human mobsters use robot-muscle thug-robs to terrorize the citizenry of North Am. Human trafficking, illegal psychoactive substances, violent crime, and corrosive corruption are suddenly epidemic in the glittering utopia, with only the mighty Robot Fighter to stand against them. When a wealthy heiress is kidnapped, Magnus is drawn into the mob's deepest sanctuary, where he faces the fight of his life against the immensely powerful half robot, half man known as Big Guns.
