If you wanna judge those of us who are questioning the official story, then go ahead. It's freedom of speech here in America. If you wanna call us unAmerican for questioning the Government controlled media and the Government then do a little research on American history.  They haven't been trustworthy for a long time. If you wanna troll and post some garbage on here about me or the seeders, get off you lazy ass, walk up the stairs from your mom's basement, walk up to her, ask for some milk, and suck on her tit.
