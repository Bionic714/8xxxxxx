Any chance you can do a basic tutorial without giving away all of your secrets? I am struggling to reproduce your quality with audio and still have it play at all on my PS3. I have a lot of media to convert for my collection...Thank you...."
,pro346pro,2013-01-30T10:16Z,I'm just a novice but I find megui to be really good and you can do audio separately if you like just make sure you install the Nero aac  codec as it has to be installed separately and I get the best results with it.

having used handbrake and format factory and megui and various others... i was never entirely pleased with them at all IMO they are substandard when attempting to do something like this.

Now i mostly entirely use my own custom scripts. Each one is modified to fit the video i'm encoding. No script is entirely identical to that of another one per movie. The only ones that are usually close to if not identical are those for specific movies in which they are all the same essentially.. for example the new batman trilogy almost all of which use the same or similar script.

I highly recommend anyone wanting to attempt to re-create what i'm doing, get staxrip... the more people uploading good quality stuff the better i think, less pressure on me.

I've a template i could upload to something like media fire and link if someone wants to use it as a referrence point for 1080p encodes."
,van714,2013-02-01T01:05Z,Anything you can provide to help and point us in the right direction would be great. I would love to contribute to the quality rips on TPB. Maybe a torrent of some basic instructions and templates to get us started... Thanks dhjudasx....
