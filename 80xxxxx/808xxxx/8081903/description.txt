When we last heard from Tomahawk on 2007ΓÇ▓s Anonymous, the group had set aside some of its more eclectic tactics for an album inspired by Native American imagery and concepts that founding member Duane Denison had encountered while touring with Hank Williams III. Prior to this self-described detour, the band also parted ways with original bassist and former Melvin Kevin Rutmanis. Now, after six years, the veritable supergroup has returned with its fourth release, Oddfellows. And just to be clear, this is not a reunion. If anything, Oddfellows marks a re-launching of Tomahawk, complete with new bassist Trevor Dunn, who more than fills the vacancy left by Rutmanis.
Denison recently described Tomahawk as ΓÇ£what we do when we want to rock out and just go nuts and have funΓÇ¥. Oddfellows is the result of the approach. Recorded at Dan AuerbachΓÇÖs Easy Eye Studios in Nashville with producer Collin Dupuis, Oddfellows picks up where TomahawkΓÇÖs 2003 sophomore album Mit Gas left off. TomahawkΓÇÖs latest effort easily traverses straight up quasi-punk rockers with brooding, haunting melodies akin to Fantomas-lite tempered by latter-day Faith No More. However, DunnΓÇÖs presence introduces a modicum of jazz architecture to the foundation of tracks like ΓÇ£Rise Up Dirty WatersΓÇ¥, and in doing so, doesnΓÇÖt necessarily evolve TomahawkΓÇÖs sound but certainly elevates it some. All throughout Oddfellows DunnΓÇÖs bass provides a warmth not necessarily found on the bandΓÇÖs first couple of releases.
