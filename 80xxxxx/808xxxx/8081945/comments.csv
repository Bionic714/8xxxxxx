Really? The ""seed"" comments starting 4 minutes after upload? Lol."
,nl045837,2013-01-30T04:36Z,why would it be a faker? it came out 15 min after it was over. sounds legit
,Strajow,2013-01-30T04:38Z,"it's real as always, calm down.."

,FearZip,2013-01-30T05:08Z,"This guy doesn't download too much mma if he thinks sectpb uploads fakes. One question though, why 60fps? Do they even emit at that rate? I always wait for the normal release."
,KShelbrock2,2013-01-30T06:32Z,With 155 seeds in the swarm I am only able to connect to 3 of them... People seeding out need to force encryption and allow legacy connections so that everyone can seed from them... especially those of use that want to stay protected.

,Aznagroth2,2013-02-01T19:53Z,"I'm just logging in to say thank you for this episode!  At the same time I would like to thank you for the full season 16!

Some times I wonder if it's right of me to make use of this.  The conclusion I've come to this far is that if this wasn't available on the net like this I would never have watched it.  

Would have been interesting to know your views on this too, but I guess you don't want to say too much on the internet ;)

Keep up the good work and take care!"
