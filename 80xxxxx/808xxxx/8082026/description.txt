Inspector Lynley Mysteries (all)(2001-08 BBC) DVD Rip x264 mp4


based on the books and characters of Elizabeth George

starring Nathaniel Parker and Sharon Small as the aristocrat 

Inspector Lynley and his working-class Sergeant Havers


note: the DVDs came from the BBC release and PBS release versions, depending on what was available from my local library (I could't get the BBC versions for many of the episodes). So one will notice the difference in opening and closing titles, and I have editted out all the PBS stuff (much as I like Diana Rigg, I don't like talking head introductions).


Pilot in 2 parts plus 6 series, 24 episodes in total
depending on the series, episode length varies from 72mins to 89mins
