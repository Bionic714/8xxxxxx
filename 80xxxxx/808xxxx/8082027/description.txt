PLOT :

The future America is an irradiated waste land. On its East Coast,
running from Boston to Washington DC, lies Mega City One - a vast,
violent metropolis where criminals rule the chaotic streets.
The only force of order lies with the urban cops called "Judges"
who possess the combined powers of judge, jury and instant executioner.
Known and feared throughout the city, Dredd is the ultimate Judge,
challenged with ridding the city of its latest scourge - a dangerous
drug epidemic that has users of "Slo-Mo" experiencing reality at
a fraction of its normal speed. During a routine day on the job,
Dredd is assigned to train and evaluate Cassandra Anderson,
a rookie with powerful psychic abilities thanks to a genetic mutation.
A heinous crime calls them to a neighborhood where fellow Judges rarely
dare to venture - a 200 storey vertical slum controlled by prostitute
turned drug lord Ma-Ma and her ruthless clan. When they capture one
of the clan's inner circle, Ma-Ma overtakes the compound's control center
and wages a dirty, vicious war against the Judges that proves she will
stop at nothing to protect her empire. With the body count climbing
and no way out, Dredd and Anderson must confront the odds and engage
in the relentless battle for their survival.
