There is another recent torrent of this but the uploader is having a problem seeding it, so I decided to compile my own torrent and hopefully get this out to people faster.  None of these scans are mine.  MUCH APPRECIATION to all original scanners and uploaders!



Included in this torrent:

Madrox #1-5 "Multiple Choice"

X-Factor 1-50 and 200-249 (it was renumbered to 200 after 50)

The entire "Endangered Species" X-Men crossover event

The entire "Messiah Complex" X-Men crossover event

One shots:
The Quick and the Dead
Layla Miller
Nation X


She Hulk V2 #31 - Which is the 2nd part of a Secret Invasion crossover between X-Factor #33 and #34



All of these comics have been organized and grouped in order of their TRADE PAPERBACKS, with the exception of 17-24, which I have split off to make way for Endangered Species, otherwise they are mostly intact.  The 3 one-shots are inserted roughly with the trade group for when they were publushed chronologically (example, Layla Miller is an epilogue to Messiah Complex)

Hope this helps some folks frustrated with the previous torrent!
