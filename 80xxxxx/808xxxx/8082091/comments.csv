,007rambo007,2013-01-30T07:20Z,thank you! :D
,elveljung,2013-01-30T10:40Z,SUBS ARE NOT IN SYNC. Was the same with episode 3. Kinda irritating for us who watches this over ps3 when we cant disable the subs. Cant you just add them as a optional .sub file?.
,vashsf,2013-01-30T20:30Z,The subs are not hard coded and you can disable/enable them in the Ps3 or in PS media server under the transcode tab. . Take a little time learning your media streaming software before you assume that the problem is with this torrent.
,greenwheel,2013-01-31T00:55Z,I'd rather shit in my father's mouth than to try to watch HD content on a ps3. :-P
,elveljung,2013-02-06T18:33Z,"vashsf : Subs are not in sync in VLC either on my computer. When I said not in sync, I didnt mean only my ps3 but overall. Thought that would be clear since I only said not in sync..."
