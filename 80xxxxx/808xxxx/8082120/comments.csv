He is a unique multi talented musician with the coolest personality ever.
But he is not alone at the top anymore, music-wise that is...
Check out Gautier Serre, aka Igorrr!

“Imag­ine what would be if a church organ­ist goes crazy, learns to growl, mas­ters the wis­dom of work­ing with sound on com­puter, learns to beat drums rhythms in the man­ner of Slip­knot, plays drum machine à la Venet­ian Snares. His favorite musi­cal instru­ments would be Latin gui­tar, he would lis­ten to music of the Mid­dle Ages and his hobby would be to col­lect old records. Have you imag­ined that? Well, Igorrr is some­thing of this kind.” — Dmitry Quarck, soundproector.com
