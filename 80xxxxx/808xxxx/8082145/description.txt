With a unique approach to stylish living, Style Media's new docu-series "Built" follows high-fashion male models whose handy skills extend beyond the runways to remodeling homes. Produced by Endemol USA, "Built" follows a Manhattan home design and construction service staffed exclusively with male models who are also experienced handymen. "Built" debuts Monday, January 28 at 9pm ET/PT with a 10-episode order, following the season five premiere of "Jerseylicious" at 8pm ET/PT on Style. On each new episode of "Built", the five-man crew will tackle a home makeover project by helping their clients with remodeling challenges. A prominent interior designer with Hott and Handy lends her insight and expertise to ensure that the creative expectations are being met. With their different personalities and skill sets, the"Built" team sometimes struggles to find common ground in their work; however, their dizzying good looks bind them together and ensure a handsome ending.
