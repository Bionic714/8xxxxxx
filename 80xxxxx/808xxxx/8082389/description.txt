Metamorphoses (from the Greek ╬╝╬╡╧ä╬▒╬╝╬┐╧ü╧å╧Ä╧â╬╡╬╣╧é, "transformations") is a Latin narrative poem in fifteen books by the Roman poet Ovid, describing the history of the world from its creation to the deification of Julius Caesar within a loose mythico-historical framework. Completed in AD 8, it is recognized as a masterpiece of Golden Age Latin literature. One of the most-read of all classical works during the Middle Ages, the Metamorphoses continues to exert a profound influence on Western culture.
