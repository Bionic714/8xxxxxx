,elto73,2013-02-04T18:58Z,Some of Ching Lius torrents have comments reporting that activation is not working etc and some have reports of trojans and visuses..  ....be careful
[V],bigbluesea,2013-02-05T22:41Z,"@SSSSSmokey & elto73

Your both idiots!!!

There are no viruses you morons.AV sees cracks,keygens,patches etc etc as a threat it's a false/positive.Inform yourselves before you make stupid comments "
,barchismo,2013-02-12T01:21Z,Worked great. Followed the instructions and it worked. No sweat.  Thanks!
,lulusmile,2013-02-27T00:10Z,This torrent has a Trojan - don't download.
,Pac12fan,2013-03-11T07:27Z,"The Instructions say 

1b. RUN ""aam-patch.painter.exe"" and click on ""patch"" button. in ""1.Application manager - Patch painter"" folder.  

I can't find that file anywhere, there's only 1 file in that folder and it's the first file you install.

What am I missing?"
,APAULCOLYPSE,2013-03-27T07:02Z,"I got the same problem. Did you figure it out? 


I ended up skipping that step and just installed illustrator then replaced the patches. 
So far it seems to work after I connect to the internet.  I'm crossing my fingers that it sticks without the patches. 


Oh and I was not able to update. Kept getting an error. "

2. Install ""ApplicationManager6.2_all.exe""

3. Copy ""aam-patch.painter.exe"" to ""C:Program FilesAdobeOOBEPDAppcore"" and RUN patch. 

4. Install ""Illustrator_16_LS16.exe"" as trial

5. turn on internet

6. Open Illustrator CS6 click try 30 days and then click on help->update

7. After successful update, rename ""C:Program FilesAdobeAdobe Illustrator CS6 (64 Bit)Support FilesContentsWindowsamtlib.dll"" to ""amtlib.dll.old (in case u need it later)""

8. Copy ""amtlib.dll"" from ""Cracked dlls"" folder and paste it in installation folder (see step 6)

,TW63684,2013-04-22T19:54Z,"Thank you Ching_Liu, works great like all your others.

TO THE STUPID PEOPLE
Unplug your dam internet, read the dam notepad file were ching_Liu tells you step by step how to install.

It does say (like Ching_Liu tells us) the start up graphics say tryout but it will not expire, and has full functions."
