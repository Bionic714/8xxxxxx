Wealthy, mysterious, beautiful. She is the Huntress. Her range, the world, her quarry, romance. No, not for herself does she seek love, but for those still alone and adrift on the sea of life. Using methods both ancient and modern she tracks down the perfect combinations of men and women and gently weaves them into the fabric of love. Why has she taken on such a thankless task? And why is her destiny to remain alone? Ask her and she will say because she is, The Huntress.
