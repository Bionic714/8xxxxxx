Happy Tag Team Tuesday. This update is the first round of the exciting match that aired *****LIVE******* on January 4th. We have Team Yellow, Cheyenne "The Wrangler" Jewel and Sahara"The Hurrican" Rain and Team Blue, Isamar "La Diabla" Gutierrez and Berretta "The Pistol" James. Berretta and Sahara start out on the mats for their teams. Berretta has a little more experience than Sahara does but Sahara has a little more size on the little Pistol. Blue does a good job watching the clock and making sure they use all their tags. Yellow wasn't as strategic and misses out on a full tag in the first round. 

The pairings could not have been any more perfect. Where one team lacks in experience, they make up for in brut strength. Cheyenne puts Isamar in a brutal head scissor and finger blasts her. Isamar lays on top of Sahara and even though Sahara has a bridge strong enough to push a 200 lb gorilla off of her, she is unable to push against Isamar's will.
