In the near future, humanity has disappeared, leaving behind a large megalopolis devoid of natural life. From the destruction awakes ROSA, a robot part of the KERNEL project, mankind's last attempt to restore the earth's ecosystem using recovered samples of long-extinct plant species. Wandering among the ruins of the lifeless city, Rosa will soon discover that she is not the only part of Kernel that has awakened.

Uploaders Notes:
   This short film reminded me of what Ghost In The Shell would be like in a Mad Max type setting. It is deeply cyberpunk and has a few deep meanings to the story. One of the top short animated sci-fi films I've seen in a long time.  I highly recommend this to any Sci-Fi Buff, also a good in-between filler for a movie playlist. I'll be uploading more sci-fi and Horror Animated Short Films. This has no speaking in it so anyone can watch it and get what is going on. It does have english signs and beginning type however but nothing to important. Enjoy and seed.
