If you're not content with ordinary chairs and tables, shelves and cabinets, and especially if you enjoy rescuing flea-market finds and giving them a face-lift, you'll enjoy the wonderfully offbeat projects in Painted Wooden Furniture. Folk-art motifs, florals, nature themes, neoclassical designs, and trompe l'oeil effects adorn a variety of wooden pieces, all clearly presented with step-by-step directions and color photos. There's even a charming circus-tent bookcase and a chair painted to look like fake fur. Most of the technique are fairly simple, and the results are delightful.
An instruction manual on transforming ready-to-build items into individual works of art. It also advises on giving new life to second-hand pieces. Special templates show large-scale "deconstructed" designs so that the reader can copy the templates. Each project is broken up into simple stages, and different effects and design variations are featured on a range of furniture, including different styles of chairs, tables, frames, dressers and cabinets. The manual covers how to apply scumble glazing, decorative metal leafing, dry brushing, antique waxing and distressing.
