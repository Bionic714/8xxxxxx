,andymc17,2013-01-31T02:11Z,"The film gives the impression that the Gangster Squad were responsible for Mickey Cohen's arrest. In reality, Cohen was arrested in 1950 for the more mundane crime of tax evasion. He was also not sent to Alcatraz until 1961, over a decade after the film's time frame."

,at7000,2013-02-27T01:12Z,"  Keep this camera shit out of the High-Res area. it is not High Res, it is LOW RES B.S. garbage.  Burning junk to a 4 GIG, Blu-Ray rip size, does not improve the crap resolution, low quality audio and camera shake. "
