,nunuorig,2013-02-15T10:04Z,I need premier as well.  Premier has purposes like rental properties and other investments like stocks and bonds.  I didn't see anything with rentals in the Personal & Business version.
,psycho34,2013-02-21T10:35Z,Did all updates worked fine '') Thank you!
,simplymuh,2013-02-21T23:45Z,if you're looking for another vsrsion of TurboTax then put a space in it when searching. Search Turbo Tax. Also the updates do work.
,helldemonfiend,2013-03-15T01:21Z,Thanks 
,nobruusa,2013-03-28T21:41Z,"Worked like a charm, thank you so much.  Does this give me the State file free?  If not, anyone know how I can get it free."
,Saki33,2013-04-08T16:19Z,"Only way to file state free is print it and mail it in, at least in my state that's how it works. Federal efile is free, but state efile is not free."
,Saki33,2013-04-09T21:24Z,"It appears this program does not include calculating state tax unless you pay $44.95. No thank you very much. I will use OLT. I'm over the allowable for a free service, but costs just $15 for state and federal. That includes efiling of both federal and state and electronic payment of federal. I have to go to my state web site to pay by electronic check. I could just mail it in, but e-check only costs $1 and saves me the bother of writing a check and mailing."
