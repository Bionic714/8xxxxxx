After you download your selected games , put them on a USB stick (FAT32) and then put it in your PS3 console ... go to (Install Package Files) and install your game and it will show directly on the XMB screen ... you don't have to select it using multiMAN ... In short words ... Yes , just install the PKG file :)"
