,omegaviper,2013-01-30T20:13Z,is a 3.55 patch required for this?
,oakwind1,2013-01-30T20:22Z,"There was another torrent I can't find now:

Ni no Kuni Wrath of the White Witch [BestRepack.net]

Do you know if it was a fake? I'm still downloading it but it has slowed down alot, I'm guessing because it was deleted here."
,oakwind1,2013-01-30T20:24Z,Actualy this is the same one. nevermind.
,fedeuy,2013-01-31T01:35Z,"2 seeders?, whoa this is going to take sometime...
Thanks thenoobish!"
,Grandmaster5,2013-01-31T11:54Z,Can I just install this or do I need reactPSN?
,Vrashnahk,2013-01-31T15:28Z,"The DUPLEX torrent had me crashing every so often, it wasn't fun. Anyone tested this copy yet and verified its reliability?

Thanks for another great upload, thenoobish!"
,ioio32l,2013-02-01T00:42Z,"This version works perfectly! Also, the Duplex version works on 5400 RPM external USB drive, no special settings needed in multiman besides External are necessary.

Recommend this version though so you can go straight to the game without having to open multiman first."
,kraasian,2013-02-01T03:21Z,How do I get the game onto my ps3
,kraasian,2013-02-01T03:24Z,Do you need multiman for this?
,Vrashnahk,2013-02-01T08:37Z,ioio32l - External? How do you do that?
,omegaviper,2013-02-01T10:00Z,@Vrashnahk you can play ps3 backups yet you don't know how to put a ps3 game on an external hdd and play it?  google it go look in forums this is common info around the web.
,Vrashnahk,2013-02-01T10:43Z,"Aight, finished the DL and seeding now. Ran the game, haven't crashed yet, 5 hours into the game. Awesome!"
,Nickyjeff,2013-02-01T22:32Z,"Guys, I need some help here, do i have to join all 5 or just install according to their numbers?"

,zlaja_fkr,2013-02-06T14:47Z,"is there a chance we could get a 3.55 fix for this version, thanks"
,magpupu2,2013-02-07T02:07Z,"i am having issues with the wizard's companion not working. after i selected it, it will just show me white screen and then go back to the main menu."
,acucar11,2013-02-08T19:24Z,Is this EU or US version?
,narutonz,2013-02-09T08:59Z,there's a newer version. It includes the DLCs as well. Just saying.
,Halgdp,2013-02-14T15:44Z,"OK, I'm really confused.
I downloaded both this and the last one to try them. I got the files downloaded but I have no idea of how to use them since they're PKG files.
I just feel like I've downloaded files for several hours to achive nothing..."
,The1stRule,2013-02-22T04:11Z,"First time I am downloading a game for PS3. 
Can anyone tell me how/link a tutorial on how to:

a) Install CFW
b) Run Games via HDD
c) Use a ""3.55 Fix"" (Whatever that is) 

Thanks if you can help! "
,noobzero,2013-02-22T17:39Z,"@The1stRule 

no need for 3.55. Instead google Rogero 4.31 and multiman 4.18.00. Install both and your ps3 is good to play this game. I upgraded from 3.55 to Rogero 4.31 and all my previous games like MGS, RES, FF are playing well. In fact even none played I wouldn't have cared because Ni No Kuni is such a great game that it makes you forget other ps3 games.

This is the best downloadable version of Nu Ni Kuni. It plays without any freezing. Big thanks to thenoobish."
,The1stRule,2013-02-22T23:08Z,"@noobzero, 
Thanks for that, but I have found that my PS3 is to new (3000 I think) and has custom firmware 4.31 so I can't downgade or install CFW :( Waste of 17Gb! Hahaha"
,noobzero,2013-02-23T03:34Z,"@The1stRule 

Sad news you can't play this awesome game. Very very sad indeed. I hope you miraculously find a way to flash your PS3 back to 3.55! :)"
,323526,2013-02-25T04:28Z,"Help, the game was working fine until i get to fairyland and talk to the two fairies in order to start the next dungeon, but i get stuck at the loading screen.... I'm on rogero 4.30"
,765407069,2013-02-27T22:45Z,@323526 The same was happening to me. Try changing the audio language to english and then loading the saved game. It worked for me.
,Ant1p0l0,2013-03-02T06:37Z,"For issues with the Wizard's Companion not working, here's a fix from Kameo@PS3ISO:

 Hi everyone, i was tired of the Wizard's Companion bug since i jumped from Duplex to the PSN version.
 So i've found that to fix this bug, you just have to use this trick every time you run the game.
 Just grab your favorite Manager (Iris Manager or MultiMan) > run it > exit as soon as possible > run Ni No Kuni PSN version.
 That's it, you can now enjoy the game with no issues... no need to install odd packages, updates or whatever.

Hope this helps."

,Halgdp,2013-03-02T09:35Z,Is there a version for computer?
,omegaviper,2013-03-07T02:10Z,@The1stRule if it has custom firmware 4.31 then you already have cfw custom firmware... do you mean you just have default firmware version 4.31?
,ncexxx,2013-04-18T03:36Z,"thx thenoobish, it's work on my ps3, and it's really a good game.. cheers :)"
