,jakenator,2013-01-31T04:15Z,Has anyone confirmed this working on an NTSC version of Black Ops 2?
,1l3l_00cl,2013-01-31T05:23Z,As far as i know this is only for Jtag and RGH...and i dont think it would matter if its PAL/NTSC if u got jtag/rgh

,1l3l_00cl,2013-02-01T04:55Z,"try this site 

http://www.xbuc.net/?searchString=COD+black+ops+II

im assuming u already know how to unlock the dlc's through ""xm360"""
,1l3l_00cl,2013-02-01T06:59Z,"Im not sure which title update came with this torrent i know its title update 6 which is the latest....when i 1st placed these maps and unlocked em they didnt show up cuz i thought i had the latest TU but i didnt replaced my current TU with the 1 that came with this torrent and saw them all....

make sure the TU corresponds with the game version....ull see different versions of TU on that link i gave in above comment...

Like i have a region free version of COD Black Ops II and im guessing TU is region free/pal

try other TU 6 on that website im sure 1 will work!"
,imyourfather,2013-02-01T13:17Z,"yeh can unlock thru xm360,will try your link for other tu's,thanks man nice to see people helping each other instead of grab and run.."
,mateus182,2013-02-01T20:17Z,"não estou conseguindo jogar em modo zumbi com essa DLC, aparece ""****2 script error(s)"" a não entra...alguem pode me ajudar ?

i can't play with that DLC in mode zumbies, the menssage ""****2 script error(s)"" , HELP !!!"
,hpowner,2013-02-01T22:37Z,Do i need a jtag for this? Plz someone reply!
,1l3l_00cl,2013-02-01T22:58Z,"^to the above comment....i think i already stated that the ZOMBIES MAP DIE RISE isnt working right now cuz its giving a ""script error"" it wont work offline though it works if u go online....theres some sort of bug that wont allow u to play it as the scene cuts off...though the rest of the multiplayer maps and turned mode works fine...

Activision support is already looking into it...just wait for a new TU

,dino_cudi,2013-02-05T01:19Z,i tried downloading it but then it shows up on my 360 corrupt file
,dino_cudi,2013-02-05T01:25Z,can anyone post a vid of how to do it please
,1l3l_00cl,2013-02-05T04:33Z,trust me its not corrupt...u should ask urself whether u have a JTAG/RGH console...then go from there...
,masksacrafice,2013-02-06T03:14Z,"My game just cant find the DLC. Got nuketown 2025 working for awhile and tu6 (region free, which is my games region), used xm360 and tried plenty of title updates, but the game just cant find it. Anyone else?"
,1l3l_00cl,2013-02-06T04:33Z,xm360 should be able to find the DLC regardless of the title update....if u have the wrong title update however...then u wont see the maps in the game even if their unlocked....
,hardcorecouple69,2013-02-06T09:49Z,mine came up wrong region however once i used my usb stick and prepared it on the xbox in system/storage then went back to pc and used USBXTAFGUI_v44 then open usb drive and create content/0000000000000000 then placed the downloaded folder in there then back to xbox system/storage then click move to hd it all worked fine then.
,masksacrafice,2013-02-06T21:21Z,"1l3l_00cl, sorry I shouldve been more clear, xm360 can see it and it shows that its unlocked, but the game just cant find it, after trying different region tu's."
,1l3l_00cl,2013-02-07T04:07Z,If uve got PAL and ur game version is region free then the TU that came with this download should work and maps should show....if its NTSC then i believe its different ill have to try em to know which 1 it is...ill check it tomorrow.
,1l3l_00cl,2013-02-08T01:10Z,"My Console Version: PAL
COD Black Ops II Version: Region Free
--Game's Title ID: 415608C3
--Game's Media ID: 05C7492A

Title Update (TU) that worked for me for Revolution DLC: NUMBER 2 (which is region fee and notice how the media ID for the TU6 file matches with the game file)


ALL THE TU6 that ive tried: (this is in acending order from OLD to NEW - theres 9 of em refer to below link ull understand)
http://www.xbuc.net/?searchString=COD+black+ops+II

1) TU6 - Region Code: PAL - Media ID: 2216717A - Title ID: 415608C3 (this is the same for all title updates) - Date 27. Jan 13 04:14 - Size 32.39 MB

Error that i got on title screen when i used this TU and launched the game: ""The content you are trying to load is from an incorrect region. Please check that you have the correct downloadable contact"" 

(this error pops up twice 1 after the other since its wrong for both Nuketown DLC and Resolution DLC thats why you cannot see any DLC maps zombies nor multiplyer not even Nuke Town 2025 Multiplayer/Zombies

After the error if u press ""Ok"" and go to either Multiplayer or Zombies Mode it will reappear again!!!)

2) TU6 - Region Code: Region Free - Media ID: 05C7492A - Title ID: 415608C3 - Date 27. Jan 13 11:19 - Size 31.99 MB

THIS 1 WORKED FOR ME. I CAN SEE ALL THE RESOLUTION DLC MULTIPLAYER MAPS AND ARE ALL WORKING - NUKETOWN 2025 MULTIPLAYER MAP CAN ALSO BE SEEN

TURNED MODE IN ZOMBIES WORKS - HOWEVER DIE RISE ZOMBIES DOES NOT WORK DUE TO A SCRIPT ERROR AS I MENTIONED ALREADY ITS DUE TO A BUG WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO BE FIXED BY ACTIVITION - JUST WAIT FOR A NEW TU (HOPEFULLY 7)"

,1l3l_00cl,2013-02-08T01:14Z,"****CONCLUSIONS****

*It doesnt matter whether your console version is PAL/NTSC as long as its JTAG/RGH cuz i think i read it somewhere that on a JTAG or RGH console u can play all versions of a game whether thats PAL NTSC or Region free.

**If the game version is Region free then the DLC version (whether thats PAL/NTSC/Region Free) is irrelevant - WHAT MATTERS IS THAT THE TITLE UPDATE'S ""MEDIA ID"" SHOULD CORRESPOND WITH THE MEDIA ID OF THE GAME VERSION

***If the game version is NTSC/PAL then im guessing the Title Update's Media ID should correspond with the Media ID of the Game and that should make it work!.........in this case i think the version of the DLC doesnt matter BUT it may....like game version and dlc should be of the same version like for ex. if the game version is PAL DLC version should also be PAL but i havent tried this so i dont know. "
,1l3l_00cl,2013-02-08T01:19Z,"I hope this is enough spoon feeding (for those who understand - no offense) it took me 1 hr and 30 mins - dont hate...appreciate!

Ill try to write basic stuff about JTAG that i learned from youtube videos and from xbox360iso like how to unlock & add dlcs and how to downloaded games on ur JTAG - I dont know much about RGH but i think function is the same (correct me if im wrong)"
,gt207,2013-02-13T21:46Z,I downloaded and put on a flash drive.. now what?
,hardcorecouple69,2013-03-02T03:33Z,i tried every title update and it didnt work then i redownloaded the whole game again to get the regoin free version and i kept getting error does not match the region but in the end i got it to work by doing this  i used my usb stick and prepared it on the xbox in system/storage memory unit and then took it back to pc and used USBXTAFGUI_v44 then open usb drive and create content/0000000000000000 then placed the downloaded folder in there then went back to xbox system/storage then click move to hd it all worked fine then. SO ANYONE HAVING THE REGOIN PROBLEM SHOULD TRY FOLLOWING MY INSTRUCTIONS TO THE LETTER OR IF YOU CANT UNDERSTAND WHAT I AM TELLING YOU THEN DO YOUR GOOGLE RESEARCH I SPENT QUITE SOME TIME TO GET IT TO WORK!!!!
,1l3l_00cl,2013-03-08T12:25Z,title update 7 is out so it doesnt matter now it should work for every1 even the zombie map  works fine
,VainCape,2013-03-08T17:37Z,I put the dlc into the Black ops 2 folder in my xbox and placed the correct TU 6 in the Cache folder of my hdd1. Still get the message about the dlc being of the incorrect region!! ;O
,TheRiddlebox,2013-03-25T10:59Z,I just love how nobody does this for Ps3.
