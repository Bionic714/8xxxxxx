Chivalry: Medieval Warfare - it is said to the developers, the medieval "military" (original "combat" - the word game "battle"), first-person game. In the local imaginary world Agate Knights (Agathian Knights) are fighting against the Masonic Order (Mason Order) for control of the country Agatha (Agatha). And, surprisingly for such games, the local world discharged enough, it has its heroes and its traitors, and, of course, reasons to fight - this time in their role as advocates of civil war. Despite the fantastic story, the gameplay is quite serzen and seeks to reproduce in detail the battle between armor-clad knights. In fact, we have no FPS machines, but with swords and bows.
