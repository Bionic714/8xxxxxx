,krackhd,2013-01-31T05:12Z,"It's one of the knock-off films from The Asylum...not Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters that is in theaters. They often release a cheap-ass movie right around the time the major studios have a big release, e.g. Transmorphers not Transformers.

Check the IMDB link posted and you'll see it's a different movie. Uploader got it correct."
