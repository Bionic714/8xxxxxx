Information
------------------------------

Scotty travels to the North Sea coast of England to ancient Bamburgh Castle, where the body of a young man with a crushed skull has been unearthed. The body dates to the 7th century A.D., a violent time when the Christian king, Oswald, fought pagans for control of the country. Was this young man a monk, killed in the countryside while spreading Christianity? Or was he an aristocrat and warrior who died defending the castle? And if he was a warrior, was he pagan or Christian?
