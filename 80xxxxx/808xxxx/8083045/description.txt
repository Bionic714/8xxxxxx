I just found this on the internet and wanted to share. I wonder why they put it on a paid website, where you have to pay to download things (like rapidgator, whatever) instead of putting in a torrent website. Anyway, it features the fights Raul Amaya vs Jose Gomes and Brent Weedman vs Marius Zaromskis. This is my second torrent, sorry if i screwed something up.
