,MusicalMonkey,2013-02-01T01:24Z,"@huegart

i believe this is hardsubbed since it's not a dvd rip, but from a cam.

btw, i revise my rating and give the video a 7. since it's pretty good for a cam. audio is still poo."

,TtToker,2013-02-05T11:02Z,"@angelpunem, don't direct comments to spammers, you'll just confuse people when the comments are deleted. and now the names of these scammers will always be in the comments because you had to cry to a spammer that will never read any comments on this site. (I know angelpunem probably won't read this but I'm hoping if I remind people to stop bitching at spammers and just complain to the top dogs in the forums then eventually people that come in late to read comments don't have to read responses to comments that don't exist...

make your words count guys, if you have to say fuck 12 times just to express your (unnecessary) anger then you don't belong on the internet and you shouldn't be watching movies, pick up a book or something, I mean holy crap guys, sheesh. Thanks for the upload and thanks all for your comments!

Regardless of subject matter, he asserts, anyone that uses the word 'fuck' or expresses discernible anger is either a) stupid, or b) ""not blessed"" with a large penis (the obvious intended inference being that TtToker must be so calm and profanity-free because of his large, manly penis). 

Yeah, TtToker... It's everyone ELSE that's stupid. It's everyone ELSE whose actions are dictated by an unhealthy penis obsession. Thank goodness you could explain it all to us plebes in such an articulate, mellifluous fashion. How fortunate we are to receive the largesse of your personality disorder-free observations. Oh happy day. 

As for the clucking about your mental inferiors being silly for responding to spammers whose comments may be deleted, well... Aren't you just the cleverest little fellow? From the weary tone infused in the wording of your admonition, it must be terribly tiring for you to have to offer such benevolent instruction to your lessers. Noblesse oblige, eh? Deigning to share such thoroughly obvious observations... Golly, man... You really are the swellest.

[You know the smarmy little jackass is still checking these comments every day ('Well alright then... Let's see who's thinking about my big penis TODAY...)]
