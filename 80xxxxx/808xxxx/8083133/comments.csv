[V],STFmaryville,2013-01-31T20:44Z,"it won't be long until this book is cancelled. i feel that people are tired of marvel alternate realities, especially when it's the focus of a title with poor art. which is too bad, b/c this had potential!"
[T],GIANNIS511,2013-02-02T00:30Z,"I agree with you that the Dark Avengers series will soon be cancelled. It really saddens me that the (originally named) Thunderbolts won't continue, but it was only natural after the way the writer's used them. The team didn't really bond with the Marvel Universe after the Dark reign, although it would (and should in my opinion) have a greater role in the Marvel Universe. "
