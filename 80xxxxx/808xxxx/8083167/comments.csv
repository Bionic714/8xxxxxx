i am amazed by the demand for this one. TPB at this moment tracks over 1,000 seeders and another 150 leechers for this issue."
[T],MrDowntown,2013-01-30T22:59Z,"On a related note, i uploaded the Complete TV series of Spectacular Spider-Man:

Could use some seeding help ;)"

Thanks for your UL for your other post as well.

Not reading this drivel until they bring Parker back.  What a stupid way to end the other series."
[T],GIANNIS511,2013-01-31T00:20Z,"@STFmaryville: Thanks for your support and your kind words!I believe the reason for having so many seeders in Superior Spider-Man is that people stopped buying it due to the death of Peter Parker.
@GMTN: I totally agree that they should not have let Peter die and reactions like yours (not reading the comic) are justified. Although when (and I believe it will be very soon judging on today's ending ) Marvel understand their mistake, you will probably have to read the whole series from the beginning to know what is going on.

,carsten.666,2013-01-31T02:09Z,I am sure PP is not dead. It is a comic. I read my first spider-man back in 1976. PP is not dead. From a danish fanboy. Super THANX to the uploaders!

,bgg1175,2013-02-19T02:58Z,Dan Slott is a fat stupid bastard who cant write a goddamn comic. He needs to just jackoff and leave the writing to others!
