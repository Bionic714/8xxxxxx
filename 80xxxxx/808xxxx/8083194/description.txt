This is a full episode of Jerry's late 1960s NBC sketch-comedy series, which
for 2 full years failed to become the success that his ex-partner 
Dean Martin pulled off for 9 seasons on the same network. Clearly Dean's show
had a much larger budget which included better writers.

I only have a couple of episodes, not including the Sonny & Cher episode 
that I acquired on VHS some 24 years ago. Although the video quality 
is decent, this and the other one (a second generation copy) has Spanish subtitles. The guy who uploaded this to You Tube must have gotten it off 
a Spanish TV station..
