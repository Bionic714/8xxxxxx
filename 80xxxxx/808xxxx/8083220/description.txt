Plot:
Light Yagami is an intelligent young adult who resents all things evil. He also wishes to end crime in the world and create a utopia in which he reigns supreme. His life undergoes a drastic change when he discovers the Death Note, a notebook that contains five written instructions:

-The human whose name is written in this notebook shall die.
-This notebook will not take effect unless the writer has the subject's face in their mind when writing his/her name. Therefore, people sharing the same name will not be affected.
-If the cause of death is written within 40 seconds of writing the person's name, it will happen.
-If the cause of death is not specified, the person will simply die of a heart attack.
-After writing the cause of death, the details of the death should be written in the next 6 minutes and 40 second
