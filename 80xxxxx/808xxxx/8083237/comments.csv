Thank you as always.  Just curious as to why the files are so big the last few months.  It use to be around 18 - 20 mb but now they are all in the 40 mb range.   Even the extra covers don't take up that much space ?"

beyond that, i don't know and i don't care. if the file's too big, buy a paper copy."
