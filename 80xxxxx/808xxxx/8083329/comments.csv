,OvOvO,2013-01-31T12:37Z,"whats wrong with TPB SaM ? i cant see any new videos, comments anything...since the cache server 00 appeared everything stays still .. :S"
,ZoolooCH,2013-02-04T23:01Z,"Just to clarify: 

It's not HD, so ""HDTS"" is uncalled for.
There is only one audio track.
Maybe the source was 720p as stated but this was encoded in WVGA or something. 
Thanks anyway. 谢谢！  "

,Yeshua11,2013-03-17T02:48Z,"Damn this movie looks so good.  The video/sound quality is pretty poor on this copy though.  Being a visual film, make it hard to watch. I am just going to have to wait for a better up. Thanks anyways mate!"
