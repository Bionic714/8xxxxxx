,Bughyee,2013-01-30T20:05Z,Is this working with the Limited Edition 1.8? I know that I have to instal 1.9 and 2.0...
[V],Gh0stNet,2013-01-30T20:21Z,Difference b/w limited and normal version is the dlc so yes this is working with it
,hakim462000,2013-01-31T08:18Z,"Hi Gh0stNet. I have sleeping dogs 1.7, can i use your patch directly to 1.9 -> 2.0 -> 2.1, I don't want to dl that huge 1.8 again :("
,THANGDL,2013-01-31T16:13Z,"Thanks Gh0stNet for this update! i've found some things are better of SDv1.9 and 2.0 than old version SDv1.8 (driving car, Shaolin Showdown and many interesting DLC..). Good luck!"
,Devillord2009,2013-01-31T16:22Z,"Doesn't work for me, it just doesnt want to start up, is there a solution?"
,_purple_,2013-02-01T13:44Z,Will this work if 2.0 installation is already cracked? I wouldn't want to fuck up the game and make it unplayable again.
,THANGDL,2013-02-02T12:19Z,"All version SDv1.9, SDv2.0 and SDv2.1 work perfectly. I've alway do these steps:
- Install Sleeping.Dogs-SKIDROW (must be)
- Install Sleeping.Dogs.v1.8.Update-SKIDROW (must be).
- Update Sleeping Dogs v1.9.Update.incl.All.DLC's-P2P. Copy all files and past to folder where the game is installed, then run Patch.v1.8_to_v1.9.bat. no need to crack.
- Udate Sleeping Dogs.Update v.2.0..Incl.All.DLC's-P2P. Do the same way as above step.
- update Sleeping Dogs.Update v.2.1..Incl.All.DLC's-P2P Do the same way as above step. Now, copy all files of crack and paste to where the game is installed. Do  another way it doesn't work."
,_purple_,2013-02-03T00:21Z,"@ THANGDL:
That's why the question is, what do you do if you already have and older already cracked version. Will the updater work properly or will it only modify some of the files and the result will be an unplayable game?"
,THANGDL,2013-02-03T11:43Z,"@puple! 
When i had SDv1.8, or 1.9.. i just did as Gh0sNet's instruction, (when the game was cracked). When  running SD_update_xxxx.bat it will modify some files to fix all for running as new version. When i do something wrong, i reinstall Sleeping.Dogs.v1.8.Update-SKIDROW only. Then i do everything again. That mean these updates are modify ones, on need to uninstall."
,THANGDL,2013-02-03T11:49Z,That mean these updates are modifications. No need to uninstall.
,kaozgamer,2013-02-05T03:23Z,"this works! thanks :)

btw i installed skidrow->1.8update->1.9update->2.0update->this

remember to extract the files into the game directly then run the bat file"
,BozaPirat,2013-02-05T16:24Z,"Guys i've tried all things u wrote here,but i can only play basic skidrow version(i think it's 1.3). Versions after that is totally unplayable for me...1.8,1.9,2.0,2.1..... And i followed instructions,installed to game folder,didn't crack,i only cracked with 2.1....I did everything several times and still nothing.... Any ideas how to make it work?"
,Ziero_1986,2013-02-06T19:51Z,"Stupid question guys, but does these DLC's work with the Steam version, or not?  Thanks in advance."
,NationalistuND,2013-02-08T20:17Z,"i click the .exe...i window appear,i see the logo,and then White screen error!"
,THANGDL,2013-02-10T14:16Z,Happy New Year! awaiting a new version coming soon.
,adrenilator,2013-02-11T15:26Z,"If you have Windows Vista and up and are having problems with any of the update installs, read my comment on the 1.9 update torrent...

,dubai1991,2013-02-20T21:10Z,this increases stutter rather than reducing it while driving....!!!
,Balakutak,2013-02-22T03:01Z,"confirmed for not working... tried all the steps. it works before this patch, but now it won't launch. now i cant' play it at all. it generates something like ""hkship.exe.4880.steamstart"" everytime i launch it. solution please"
,BozaPirat,2013-02-22T15:17Z,"I solved all my problems... All i needed is a STEAM!!! Now it works perfect,but problems like aiming and steering are still there..."
,KevinPaul06,2013-03-15T16:17Z,"I can't extract the update? both 2.0 and 2.1. The WinRar says ""Unknown Method and Operation Failed"""
,joebob998,2013-04-08T23:06Z,"Same issue as Kevin, on both the 2.0 and 2.1 updates. the .7z files won't open with 7zip or winrar, both say the compression method is unknown. 
I've tried redownloading them just in case it was an error, but no dice. 

Any advice on what extractor I should be using? I thought .7z was 7zip specific, but apparently I'm mistaken"
,giovani1992,2013-05-06T22:45Z,hello wanted to know  the DLCs that has up to this update
