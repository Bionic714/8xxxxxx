Source was jerky as hell due to variable bitrate sorted it out as good as 
i could but still can slightly see it.....Gave it constant bitrate and offset 
audio to sync it up better than whats out anyway .

Subs either take it as it is or wait for higher quality release

Tagged as it is but unsure of HDRiP in all honesty
