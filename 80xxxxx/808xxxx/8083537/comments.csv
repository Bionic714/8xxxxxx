Logged in-->""Windows may not be genuine.""
10 minutes later I found out this is the program to fix it.
Within 5 minutes, I found it here on TPB, downloaded it, installed it, the program ran, computer rebooted and I'm activated.

Doesn't get much easier than that, folks."

,PleaseDontBanMe,2013-05-17T01:17Z,"Hi DeGun,

After installing the most recent updates from microsoft on windows 7 64-bit which were release on 5/15/2013 this loader is no longer working. When I try running this loader is says status:modified-uninstall other cracks. I followed the directions and tried running WAT fix and restarted. After restart, I tried running the loader and I installed and restarted. The counterfeit error message came back at the desktop. I then tried running remove WAT 2.2 which took away the desktop message and pop-up saying it was counterfeited and that's where I'm at. Could this be due to M$ finding a fix for Windows Loader in the most recent updates? Maybe windows loaders needs an updated version? Thanks"

,zeleni92,2013-05-27T23:35Z,"If after restart, you don't get any errors but it still isn't validated, go online to Microsofts genuine page, download the genuine checker they tell you to, and it's gonna pass it perfectly and you're done."
