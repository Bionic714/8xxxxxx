 Singapore-based Dr. Siddhant Arya recruits     
 a superhumanly powerful Indian-born man named  
 Rohit Mehra, who was given special powers by   
 a blue-skinned alien named Jadoo, to build a   
 computer that can forecast the future, which   
 results in an accident that kills Rohit. When  
 this news reaches Rohit's mother, Sonia, in    
 India, she passes this on to Rohit's wife,     
 Nisha, who has just given birth to a son named 
 Krishna. However, Nisha, unable to handle this 
 devastating news, passes away, leaving Krishna 
 to be brought up by Sonia. When Krishna is     
 enrolled in school, she notices that he has    
 the same intellectual and physical powers that 
 his father possessed, so in order to shield him
 from any harm, she moves to a secluded and remo
 area in a mountainous region of the country,   
 where he grows up. Years later, Krishna has    
 matured, has acquired the same special powers
