My name is Mark and I am one of the developers at Critical Studio.

We thank you for your interest in our game, and hope that, after having a chance to try a pirate version, you decide to buy it.

The game is currently available for $9.99 on Steam and several digital retailers, which is certainly not much.

We'll also keep updating and patching, we'll release a lot of additional content for free. If you are playing a pirated version, you will most likely be missing out in bug fixes and features.

This is also our first game. We are a small team of 11 people from Rio, Brazil, and the success of this game decides our future and our ability to keep making games (and keep making content for Dungeonland).

So, once again, thank you for your interest in our game. We hope you have fun, and we hope you choose to support us by buying a legitimate copy.

//The Critical Studio Crew"

But as you say pirates do support developers who truly deserve it. There are a number of games that needs to be pirated however, usually this is a sort of protest from our side. Don't buy Dead Space 3 btw, it's terrible action schlock with micro transaction and a bad PC port. HORRAY!"
