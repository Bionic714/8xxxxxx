This is a repack and re-code of the following torrent:
 
https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4506690/The_End_of_Suburbia__Oil_Depletion_And_The_Collapse_Of_The_Ameri

All credits goes to the original supplier.




I've recoded it in x264, and output it to .mkv file format, making it easier acessible than an .iso. Plays just fine in VLC.

video: 720 x 474, 29.97 fps
audio: aac 48 kHz

Includes 3 audio tracks, including authors commentary.





Prepare for an uncertain future folks, your cars and the economy you take for granted to deliver your stuff for you, won't run on prayers once the oil is too expensive to pay for.
