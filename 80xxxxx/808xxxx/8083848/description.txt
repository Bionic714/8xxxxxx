Gentleman

Wordsmithery is a word game where you use letters to make words
You can make any word! As long as it's in English. And not a proper
noun. Or a word not in the list of valid words. Don't worry, it's a
very big list

For each word you make you get points. The value of a word is the
sum of the value of all the letters in the word multiplied by the
number of letters - in layman's terms, the longer the better
