I had a hard time getting these all for my own collection, I figured I would put them together in one easy to get to place for others.. they are not the best quality as a few of them at the least have a bit of OCR issues. They are not my files and if I ever find better quality versions of the books I will update the files here.


the files included are all the books currently in the Valdemar/Velgarth universe by Mercedes Lackey in epub format.

there is also a .txt included with a chronological order of the books if you are interested in reading them in chronological order instead of publish date order

this is my first UL on here so if I did something wrong please let me know so I can fix it.
