,metalyger,2013-01-31T02:05Z,Any notes about what this update does? Is it really necessary?
,SiN-R,2013-01-31T02:58Z,"@MaxMousepb
generally, its because P2P doesnt make patcher, instead uploading patched files..
its pretty small update if you bought the game"

,s1raz1,2013-02-03T01:40Z,"Update is worthless the bat file included has the wrong path, so if u dont know how to edit a bat file ur game will be with no texture and lighting.
DONT DOWNLOAD IT, i made it work and it doesnt improve anything. 
The actual update reduce load times on fast PC and gameplay balance, like the demon dodge got nerfed bad."
,hamza2772,2013-03-11T09:39Z,"i've already downloaded the vergil downfall and patched it correctly in the dmc folder
the deal is when i select vergil downfall the game freezes & after a second or 2 it says dmc(devil may cry) has stopped working
