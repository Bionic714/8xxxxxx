Psychic medium Concetta Bertoldi knows how it is: Heaven is perfection. Life on Earth is the tough part.

It's here we need to meet challenges, learn lessons, and grow spiritually even as we cope with our sense of "aloneness" and "not enough-ness" or the loss of a loved one. Through all of this our guardian angels, those who have crossed to the Other SideΓÇöor "the dead guys," as Concetta calls themΓÇöoffer us loving, behind-the-scenes assistance.

In Inside the Other Side, Concetta explains the importance of the agreements we make with God before being born into a new physical life. She gives advice on dealing with life's difficult issues: from relationships to a lack of abundance, from illness and aging to coping with loss. Concetta's wise, witty, and uplifting assistance will help you get more in touch with the Other Side so that you can call on your own angels whenever they are needed the most.
