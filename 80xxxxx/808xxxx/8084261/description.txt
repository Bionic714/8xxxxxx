An essential, full-color guide to successful home management.

Everyone needs to have a plan to manage his or her home. With Clean Sweep, anyone can turn a house or apartment into a streamlined and stress-free sanctuary of comfort. It demystifies household management by telling you how to declutter every room, deter dust mites, decode detergent tables, dehumidify your bathrooms and bedrooms, and devise storage solutions. 

At the same time, you will learn about the "clever house," where you can save water and energy, cut down your household bills, and minimize your use of chemicals. Clean Sweep teaches you, room by room, how to cut down on clutter and keep it under control. 200 color photographs
