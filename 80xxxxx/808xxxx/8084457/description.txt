Portal for PC and Mac with saved shares and multiple platform compatibility.  Works perfectly on both PC and Mac, while allowing you to access your saves from each device.  Installation instructions are included in a readme within the .zip file.

Plug-and-play compatible, allowing users to play the game off of a USB drive, essentially allowing you to bring Portal with you, to be played on any computer, wherever you go.
