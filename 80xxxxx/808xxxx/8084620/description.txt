 Prevent or reverse repetitive stress injuries
 Cure carpal tunnel syndrome
 End chronic wrist, shoulder, and neck pain
 Ease eyestrain
 Avoid surgery, drugs, and wrist braces


Using a computer should challenge your mind, not your body.

As computers become a larger part of our daily lives both at work and at home, complaints of painful wrists, sore shoulders, stiff necks, and blurry vision associated with computer use continue to soar.

But the good news is that this chronic pain can easily be prevented or cured without surgery or drugs--or expensive "ergonomic" equipment. There's no need to move your monitor, wear wrist braces, or sit in a specially designed chair.

Instead, Pete Egoscue, using the techniques and principles developed at his renowned clinic, shows you how to keep pointing and clicking for hours--pain free.

You'll learn how to:

 Avoid or treat common but debilitating repetitive stress injuries, including carpal tunnel syndrome
 Recognize and remedy problems in posture and movement before they cause pain
 Do easy-to-perform exercises at your desk to eliminate chronic hand, wrist, shoulder, back, and neck pain
 Quickly and easily correct damaging patterns of motion
 And much more
