It appears that this movie includes an introduction and a wrap up by Joe Cross himself. Additionally, some of the listed specs are incorrect. The movie is actually 101 minutes long, not 97 minutes. The audio and video qualities are excellent. I would keep this version of other versions simply because of the added length. Thank you uploader."
