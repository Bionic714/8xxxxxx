 Notes: You thought the devils favourite group were dead and buried? HELL NO!

 (READNFO) Video has hardcoded subs throughout, normally we'd try
 and crop them or do something with them but this time there was
 really no point. As always we placed out nice smooth blur filter over the
 hardcoded logo at the top right of the screen. Frame rate is still a tad jerky,
 won't really bother you when you start getting into the film and it's still
 better than anything else that is out, oh and yes this is fully in sync.
