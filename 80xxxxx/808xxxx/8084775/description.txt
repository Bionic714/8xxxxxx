Secrets of the Guitar Fretboard Revealed (or, 125 Ways to Play "Louie Louie" in C

 You just know there's a system to the Fretboard that ties together all the positions and scales.
But what is it?

 That system is called "CAGED," and it means you only have to learn 5 of each chord type instead of 11. Once you know CAGED, you'll be able to play a simple 3-chord song like Louie Louie in 125 different ways.

 Guitar freaks in California's Redwood Empire passed around this secret fretboard formula for a generation. Now, for the first time, it has been published, by one of their own.

 There are only 5 major chord types, each played in a different position on the neck and in a different way. Same with minor, and every other chord. Learn this theory unique to the Guitar fretboard, and much more.

 Secrets of the Guitar Fretboard Revealed shows the 10 most popular chords in each of the 5 positions.

 Scales, exercises, explanations, and more.

Uses:
 play a simple C-F-G progression 125 different ways
