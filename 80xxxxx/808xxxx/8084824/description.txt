The quest to find the Eye of the World draws nearer to an end!

The group finally makes their way into the cursed northern land known as The Blight - a place fouled by evil in all possible ways - as they continue on their way to the Eye! Also, we discover more about the Warder Lan's mysterious past, and how it ties to the fall of Malkier, a country now consumed by the Blight!

All this and a little heartbreak too - all in the latest issue of Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time: The Eye of the World!
