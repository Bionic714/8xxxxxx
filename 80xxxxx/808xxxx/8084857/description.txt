Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site :: On the Wednesday, January 30 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex runs down the increased state of paranoia being perpetuated nationwide through public school drills and the incrimination of innocent school children for playing with toy guns. On today's show, Alex welcomes Nobel Peace Prize nominee Dr. Jim Garrow to break down his information regarding the Army's new ΓÇ£litmus testΓÇ¥ for military leaders. 

Tomorrow, Alex invites constitutional lawyer Bruce Fein to give his expert analysis on whether an Obama impeachment is feasible, and also to give his take on the gutting of our Second Amendment and Constitution.
