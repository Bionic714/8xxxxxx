ATTENTION:
We have released iLoader 2. It is greatly improved with many additional features including brand new UI, background uploading, upload to fan page and much more... If you are running iOS firmware 4.0 or greater, we recommend that you buy iLoader 2 instead of iLoader 1 because all new features will ONLY be added to iLoader 2. We will only maintain and fix bugs in iLoader 1.
