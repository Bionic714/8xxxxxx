Drugs Inc

Drugs: A multi-billion-dollar industry that fuels crime and violence like no other substance on the planet. Turning cartel leaders into billionaires, the illegal drug industry also provides vital income to hundreds of thousands of poor workers across the globe. While some users sacrifice their lives to an addiction they can't escape, others find drugs to be their only saving grace from physical or emotional pain almost impossible to overcome. Where should the lines be drawn in this lucrative industry?
Ecstasy
Known by users as the ultimate "love drug," ecstasy's euphoric high comes with major lows: Ravers have died from it and organized crime gangs will kill for it. In California, students "dial-a-deal" - ordering the drug over the phone and having it delivered directly to their door. A simple transaction like this turned deadly for a 23-year-old dealer who delivered a deadly dose and now faces 20 years in prison. Ecstasy is a synthetic drug that is chemically similar to the stimulant methamphetamine and the hallucinogen mescaline. Taken orally in tablet or capsule form, MDMA effects brain cells' utilization of serotonin, a chemical transmitter that plays an important role in regulating mood, aggression, sexual activity, sleep and sensitivity to pain. MDMA has a similar chemical structure to serotonin, and when it enters brain cells, it causes an excessive release of that chemical. As a result, users experience feelings of increased energy, euphoria, emotional warmth, and distortions in time, perception, and tactile experience
