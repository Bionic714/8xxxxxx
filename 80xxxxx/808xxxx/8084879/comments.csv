 THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!!!!!

Your uploads are hands down my favorite on this site.  Every release pack is epic.  Thank you so much!  I still make sure to support the artists and writers and buy these comics after I'm done reading.  I like to keep up with the stories digitally, and have the physical copy for collecting purposes.  You've made it incredibly easy to keep up with all my favorite titles.  Seriously, thank you.  It's very much appreciated.  Thank you to the original scanners as well.  Epic work!"
,ahab01,2013-01-31T07:22Z,Agreed! Love this guy!
,Neon_Jackal,2013-01-31T10:32Z,Didn't you include X-men Legacy 05 last week? I'm so confused.
[V],STFmaryville,2013-01-31T14:52Z,"i can see why x-treme x-men #9 is left out, since i think it's not marvel universe, but punisher nightmare #5 and punisher war zone #4 should be included.

in any event, thanks dadrkhomr."
