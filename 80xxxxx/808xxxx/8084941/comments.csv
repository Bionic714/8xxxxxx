Character: James (lead)

Co-Star(s): RAY WINSTONE, LESLEY MANVILLE, LUKE EVANS, JODIE WHITTAKER

Plot: Described as a ‘contemporary film noir’ and a ‘road movie,’ the plot centers around a Alzheimer’s victim (Ray Winstone) and his son (Jim Sturgess).  The son breaks his father out of a hospital and the two are on the run throughout most of the film.  

Jim explained:  “I play a character called James who basically goes to find his father who is in hospital with Alzheimer’s. He takes him away from the hospital that he’s being kept in and the story begins.  It’s a real road movie – these two characters re-connecting and getting to know each other. It’s a two hander and you just really go along with these two characters and you really get involved with what they are going to discover about each other.  It’s very different, in a good way. The character (James) is incredibly flawed – he’s not a hero by any standards. It’s always really exciting and really great when one of the main characters can be so flawed and un-heroic. He’s really in a lot of trouble.   I hope the audience go along with him. You side with him because he goes through so much and I think you want him to succeed - it’s really exciting.”"
