Starter Wives Confidential gives viewers a glimpse into the fascinating and complicated lives of celebrity exes.

Josie Harris (ex-fianc√© of Floyd Mayweather Jr.), Liza Morales (ex-girlfriend of professional basketball player Lamar Odom), Tashera Simmons (separated from hip hop legend DMX), Monica Joseph-Taylor (separated from DJ Funkmaster Flex), Zakia Baum (ex-girlfriend of rapper Maino), and Cheryl Caruso (ex-wife of accused mobster Phil "Philly" Caruso) spent years in the shadows of their exes -- supporting them emotionally and sometimes even financially as they rose to fame. The "starter wives" raised the children, kept the homes and stood by their men through it all.

 But in the end, these relationships soured. The women were left to start over and figure out how to get along with their famous exes well enough to raise children together. Josie, Liza, Tashera, Monica, Zakia and Cheryl are moving on and creating new lives that will afford them (and their children) the security, success and happiness they know they deserve.
