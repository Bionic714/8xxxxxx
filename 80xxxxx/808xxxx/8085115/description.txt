Heaven & Hell (1993)





Ostensibly, you wouldn't imagine South Wales' croaky-voiced crooner and a voluminous Texan called Meat would have much reason to share an album. Common to both of them though, is the songwriting genius of Jim Steinman--a man whose aptitude for hysterically overwrought melodrama knows no parallel this side of Andrew Lloyd-Webber. Bonnie's "Holding Out For A Hero" is about as close as we get here to the kind of pop song that might go unnoticed in a crowd. The same, of course, can't be said for "Total Eclipse Of The Heart" which manages to make feeling a bit horny sound as gigantically ominous as the Cuban Missile Crisis. Perhaps inevitably, it's Meat who steals the show: "Bat Out Of Hell and "I'll Do Anything For Love" are tattooed on the folk psyche. It is, however, a delight to be reacquainted with "Dead Ringer For Love", the scintillating mini-opera which, lest we forget, introduced Cher to a whole new generation of salivating adolescents.
