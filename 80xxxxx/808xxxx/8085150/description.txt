In the mid-1980s, Eric ClaptonΓÇÖs career was not in robust health. A recovering alcoholic, facing the commercial disappointment of ΓÇÖ83ΓÇÖs Money And Cigarettes, Clapton embarked on a brief detour into soundtrack work with US composer Michael Kamen. Their first outing together was this atmospheric six-track score for the BBCΓÇÖs landmark conspiracy drama, and was different from anything else in ClaptonΓÇÖs canon: ditching the blues, the master guitarist built low, mournful guitar motifs around KamenΓÇÖs chugging semi-industrial score. First issued on vinyl, cassette and ΓÇô unusually for 1985 ΓÇô CD
