,Sagar009,2013-01-31T22:19Z,Is this full game or just update
,Ryuuseiz,2013-02-02T13:14Z,i got nothing... after install.. the game Crash  after choosing Misson
,DustyK1D,2013-02-02T14:57Z,"Game worked fine, but the dlc of golden weapons and bone weapons crash the game
please fix it :)"
,omega_jss,2013-02-03T00:22Z,"does this one come with the pre-order bonuses like ""item finder""?"
,Ryuuseiz,2013-02-03T00:44Z,"yah, i got the same problem... Bone and Gold DLC crash the game..
any help???"
,omega_jss,2013-02-03T06:27Z,"is it only the WEAPON SKINS causing the game to crash?

considering that the COSTUMES are working properly, i guess it's worth the download instead of getting the reloaded's(8,33gb)+1.1 update(4,15gb)"
,DustyK1D,2013-02-03T20:18Z,"Dante Skins, Item Finder , Super Dante , and 20% More Orbs works just fine, the only thing is bugged is the golden and bone weapons skins.
And in some movies of the game, dante's voice doesn't work, but of the others characters works fine"
,omega_jss,2013-02-04T02:00Z,thanks dustyk1d. but u confirm that all these dlcs come are included in this repack? or u had to download'em elsewhere (or bought'em)?
,DustyK1D,2013-02-04T02:49Z,"i didn't buy nothing, it is all in the repack.
hard to belive they put all this in 5.19GB
But yeah, for me is working and i just downloaded the repack nothing more."
,Ryuuseiz,2013-02-07T11:56Z,so the Weapon Pack is the reason why the game Crash all the time ???
,omega_jss,2013-02-09T00:49Z,ive beat it 100%. the only problem SO FAR is the weapon pack dlc. the rest (costumes and perks) are okay. no videos intro or credits ripped. IT'S THE FULL GAME AND IT'S ALREADY UPDATED TO 1.1! i'm still trying to find a solution to the weapons crash.
