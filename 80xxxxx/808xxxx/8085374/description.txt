"As Time Goes By"

Sam and Dean are stunned when a man who 
claims to be Henry Winchester, their 
grandfather, suddenly appears in their hotel 
room demanding to know where he can find 
John Winchester. Henry has time-traveled to 
stop a demon named Abbadon and was looking 
for Johns help. Through Henry, Sam and Dean 
learn more about their father and the 
Winchester blood line, and they realize how
inbred they really are.
