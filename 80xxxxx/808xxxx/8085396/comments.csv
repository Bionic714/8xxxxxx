,wrestlingnut2012,2013-02-01T06:02Z,Thanks. your Royal Rumble rip was amazing. I managed to download and seed at 1.5mb/s and it was amazing quality. will you be uploading TNA Lockdown and WWE WrestleMania when they're on. if so you'll become my #1 source for all the big Pay-Per-View events. Thanks for all your hard work.
