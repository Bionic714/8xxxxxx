I have a problem with your eset ssV6: I dled and installed fine but after using purefix v.2.03, and having updated, its telling me i'm not fully protected. The reason-a non functional web access protection! Is there a way out? One more thing, the check-box for ticking the option is GREYED out. Waiting for your response, please."
