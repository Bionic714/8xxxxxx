This 1983 US release ( also released in 1984 UK & JP) was a tribute to Alex Chilton, the Velvet Underground, Neil Young, and other songwriters who influenced many of the so-called "Paisley Underground" bands from the West Coast in the early '80s. Rainy Day is a one-time collaboration of members of the Bangles, Dream Syndicate, Rain Parade, the Three O'Clock, and Opal.

The Bangles' Susanna Hoffs turns in her most stunning vocal performances ever on Bob Dylan's "I'll Keep It with Mine" and The Velvets' "I'll Be Your Mirror," while Opal's Kendra Smith is haunting on Chilton's "Holocaust" and Young's "Flying on the Ground Is Wrong." Throughout this project, the mood is often somber, well-suited to a rainy day. Most of the selections are sparsely arranged acoustic settings, making this an album of sublime beauty
