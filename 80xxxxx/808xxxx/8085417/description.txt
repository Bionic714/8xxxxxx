KMSNano is an Offline KMS Activator that emulates a KMS server in the memory of
your computer and sends activation data back and forth attempting to activate
volume versions of Windows and Office. I have personally activated KMSNano without
having my lan drivers even installed on a fresh install of Windows 7.

There are other earlier versions that may or may not work currently.
You should always check for the latest version before using.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Activates:
Windows Vista Business/Enterprise Default/N/VL
Windows 7 Pro/Enterprise Default/N/VL
Windows 8 Pro/Enterprise Default/N/VL
Windows Server Std/Data 2008/2008R2/2012
Office/OfficeVL 2010/2013.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Retail-Only Versions of windows that will *NOT* activate are:
Vista Starter/Homebasic/Homepremium/Ultimate - Default/N/E
7 Starter/Homebasic/Homepremium/Ultimate - Default/N/E
8 core/coreN/ProWMC
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Requirements: . NET 4.0 or Windows 8

Instructions:

1. Extract Files to a folder. Ex: C:KMSNano
2. Run "Run Trigger.cmd" to install, or just KMSNano.exe for single activation
(TriggerKMS will run every boot, and if you have 30 days left or less, it will
re-run the activator)
3. Wait about 45-80secs while the files run in the background.
(It takes MUCH longer for Retail Office 2013 conversion - Up to 15 mins at most.
It doesn't let you know when it's done, you can check task manager or just wait)
4. Done. Run the Check_Activation_All.cmd to verify your activation status.

For Windows 8, you can get the watermark to go away by auto-hiding the taskbar.

To fix any botched activations from other "hacktivators" or activation problems
in general, you can run admin command prompt command "SFC /SCANNOW"
I very much recommend running that command on older systems with stale system files
that may have a lot of inconsistencies.

Note that Pre-Release versions of Office or Windows will NEVER activate.
Get an actual release if you want to activate. (RTM or Retail)

Why use this program over any other activation method?
-It does not modify any of your system files.
-Because it's not a crack or a hack.
-Because it's the only way to get legit activation without using legit servers.
-Did I mention it activates ALL KMS activation software?

Change Log from v19:
- Complete support for Office2013 in W7.
(I've seen some of the conversion from retail to volume logs. Damn impressive)
(It should only need to convert retail versions the once)

Included is Documentation v11_By DrCoolZic.pdf
Please read this first if you have any problems.
DeleteTempELDI.exe just removes kmsnano temp directory if you had to taskkill

(Big Salute to heldigard and all the peeps who contributed to this project)
