DionΓÇÖs ΓÇÖ75 excursion with Phil Spector, Born To Be With You is often lauded as his masterpiece. But Wonder Where IΓÇÖm Bound, a US-only LP comprised mostly of outtakes released to cash in with 1968 hit, ΓÇ£Abraham, Martin & JohnΓÇ¥, is long due reappraisal, too. This was largely recorded in 1964/5, and buried among the expected doo-wop material were some good surprises, including the fiery garage blues of Willie DixonΓÇÖs ΓÇ£The Seventh SonΓÇ¥, and a haunting take on the title track, written by Tom Paxton, which featured a pre-Highway 61 Al Kooper on keys. DionΓÇÖs version of ΓÇ£ItΓÇÖs All Over Now, Baby BlueΓÇ¥ is astonishing ΓÇô West Coast folk-rock with added NY grime, it manages to recall The Velvet Underground at their most melodic. But Dion got there first!
