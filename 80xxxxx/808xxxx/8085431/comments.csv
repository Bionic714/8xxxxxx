,3mj4y0h,2013-01-31T06:59Z,"Can you please stop with these ""remasters""? Just get the vinyl rip if you want something better than CD quality.

I applaud your effort somewhat, but really I don't think it's possible to artificially improve the quality of a digital 16bit/44khz copy all the way to a 24bit/96khz version.

I know this has been beaten like a dead horse, but it's really polluting the music pool. Somewhere along the line this will be mislabeled as vinyl or even further compressed -- which would be screwing things up even more."
,anyabasz,2013-01-31T10:58Z,"I would like to ask the same as 3mj4y0h and many others did before me: please stop these useless, pointless ""remasters"" and don't pollute the Flac subfolder with these junks. As a sound engineer I am 100% sure about that up-sampling and re-dithering will add nothing else, but some overload and distortion to the original material. Very similar to the process, when someone once grabbed a lot of CD to windowsmediaplayer, and processed with the SRS wow and some crappy EQ, then wrote back to CD, a d finally claimed to me, that he ""improved""!!! the qualityof the original recordings...He was around 20. Your efforts are simple time wasting and generates unnecessary internet traffic. Belive me, if someting was dithered to 16bit, and processed/recorded at 44.1k, it's impossible to make it containing more detail! So please, STOP doing this!   "
,beavis39,2013-01-31T12:20Z,"Clearly neither of you have listened to this. You wouldn't be saying what you are if you had. I really care not for the opinions of people who haven't even bothered to listen.

I can't and won't stop these, I have too many followers who actually bothered to listen and now reap the benefits. It would be unfair to all of them. I can't stop due to 2 people who never listened who have a problem."
,3mj4y0h,2013-02-14T08:07Z,"I have listened to all of your rips. I am an avid Tool fan and I am anxious to listen to any release out there that promises improved quality.

All I got from your ""remasters"" was fake fill. Bottom line, you are attempting to create sound that did not exist in the original recording. This is FAKE.

You are inserting fake data bits. I don't care how accurate or awesome the technology is that you use. I don't care if space aliens predict these bits so well that it almost works.

Bottom line -- Danny Cary, Adam Jones, Justin Chancellor and Maynard did not produce these fake bits. They are artificially manifested with your software.

Unless you are remastering from the SOURCE or ripping from a VINYL rip, this is crap.

Of course you have fans. These people have no clue what they are listening to. This is the fucking internet. There are fans of Goat Anal Sex, does that mean it's good?

You are polluting the authentic Tool lossless pool with your shit. Do you honestly thing you mastered the CD without the source better than professional audio engineers? Why didn't Tool just hire you instead?

Get the vinyl, or somehow find the source. Until then you are fake as fuck."
,beavis39,2013-02-15T03:46Z,"I don't believe you have actually listened. You can't even get you facts straight. You say in the first comment ""I don't think it's possible to artificially improve the quality of a digital 16bit/44khz copy all the way to a 24bit/96khz version"" when in fact this was sourced from a 20-bit/44.1kHz HDCD rip.

Why in this year of 2013 Tool has not gotten off their asses to release true 24-bit/96kHz versions just baffles me. Of course they would sound better if they were sourced from the originals. Until then these are the next best thing.

If you think poppy, crackly, surface noise infested vinyl rips sound better, especially with a band like Tool that has so many quiet parts, then more power to you.

I will NOT be stopping these. One more Tool to go then on to my next project."
,3mj4y0h,2013-02-15T08:18Z,"I have definitely listened. It sounds like fake BS.

Sorry I was off by a few bits, I think you are missing my point. You cannot make bits out of nothing. They are fake.

Vinyl does sound better. Vinyl is the closest thing you can get to source audio. I don't mind the pops/clicks, and there are tools to reduce them anyways.

Are you telling me that PBTHAL's hi-rez vinyl rips don't sound better than this pitchy fake crap? Are you 15 years old? 

If vinyl does not sound better, then why don't we see a ton of audio engineers ""remastering"" CDs like you? Do you think you are special in some way? God's gift to remastering? Able to conjure magical bits of guitar texture out of your ass?

Clearly there is no changing your stubborn mind. Keep polluting the music pool with your BS.

Also, you don't have ""too many"" followers. Your remasters average 5 seeds/leach which is pathetic (thankfully) considering the entire human race uses Pirate Bay. Most of the comments are negative and the ones that aren't are probably people that can't tell the difference between 128kpbs and flac.

Have you tried uploading these to a real music torrent site like what.cd? I doubt they would permit this BS.


BTW - nice hardware list. HP laptop... Your sound card is bottom of the line (even worse than a stock mobo sound card). It maxes out at 16 bits IIRC. 

I bet you use BEATS BY DRE as your headphones too. Sick bro.

Peace."
,beavis39,2013-02-15T12:41Z,"If you indeed did listen then you can give me tracks and times in which it sounded worse. You are just rehashing your first comment. Comments like these always come from folks who never listen. No specifics are ever given, just a general 'this can't sound better' response.

Soundcard only used as a listening device. Recording done w/Wavelab's internal engine. My card cannot do 64-bit float/384kHz. If you had any clue what you were talking about then you would have drawn this conclusion.

The only PBthal rip I have heard is AEnima and no, I did not think it sounded better. Despite all his attempts to clean things up I can still hear alot of background noise, especially on quiet parts. BTW all those clean up tools have an overall adverse effect on sound quality.

If it were only me hearing this then I would agree this might be bs. However I have wowed too many people, friends I have here at home. I played them the 64/384 versions and they can't believe what they are hearing.

Keep on bashing me, I don't care. People often fear what they don't understand. Don't feel bad, you are not alone. If you want to stay closed minded then this is not my problem. You are the one who sounds 15, going into all my torrents to ""warn"" people who can make up their own minds. Like you are somehow an authority on this..."
,hoarybat,2013-04-19T15:22Z,"Beavis39, I hear Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs is hiring. You should apply. With your method, they would no longer have to track down the original masters. You would increase the companies efficiency 10 fold. 

Also, I was wondering if you could take my 8-bit-8-kHz audio files and upsample them to 24-bit/96kHz for me? I really need the original Mario Brothers theme as DVD-Audio, and I have tons of hard drive space to burn.

Also, you should google ""Placebo effect."" Or talk to an audio engineer. This may help."
