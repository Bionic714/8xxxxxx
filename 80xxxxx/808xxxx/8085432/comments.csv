Hello. I just stumbled across your torrents by mistake and i was pleasantly surprised. Though they are relatively ""few""- 9pages, most of them are priceless gems.... The Black Panther and Green Arrow collections are my favorites.....



Please i wish to request for Diabolik Comics in English. I am a huge fan of Danger Diabolik 1968. I have also been looking for Nick Carter:Killmaster and The Baroness e-books. They must be very rare because i have searched everywhere. THANKS for your sacrifice and patience in replying virtually every comment."
