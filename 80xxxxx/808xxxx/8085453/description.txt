Loosely translated from the German Wiki: "Fred Banana Combo was a German new wave/punk band from the early 1980's. Founded in 1978 in the vicinity of the Düsseldorf scene center Ratinger Hof, they went with a unique mix of original and pop covers with English lyrics. Disbanded in the mid 1980's, the group is considered one of the most important proponents of the early punk and wave in Germany."

Personal observations: This was the band's debut album and it hints at where they were heading in the years ahead. It's much more "rock and roll" than you'd expect from most bands labeled "new wave". All of the short tracks on this album are highly listenable, with unexpected interpretations on Lennon/McCartney favorites "She Loves You" and "Yesterday" among the other covers. They really shine on their original songs, though. "Boxer Dog" and "Thursday", for example, give you a taste of the layered vocal style of Meyer and Tolman. It's a 17-song party that I'm sure will get your feet tappin'.
