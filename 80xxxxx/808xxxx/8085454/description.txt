Digital Tutors - Modeling Sci-Fi Weapons for Games in 3ds Max

In this series of step by step tutorials we learn how to model a sci-fi weapon using hard surface modeling techniques. To begin, we will learn the importance of creating silhouettes and how to take constructive criticism in order to make it a stronger design. After that, we'll begin blocking out the basic shapes of our weapon. Once the block out model is finished, we'll use a simple render to create a paint over in Photoshop to get a better idea of the details we want out of our high poly model. Then we'll jump into modeling the high resolution model and the game resolution model. Then we'll wrap up the course by laying out the UV's, baking our normal and ambient occlusion maps and applying those maps back to the game model.
