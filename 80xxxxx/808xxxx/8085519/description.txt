Argo.2012.DVDRip.XviD-COCAIN = missing.subs.for.foreign.parts
 Our good pals from COCAIN were kind enough to pre a SUBPACK
 shortly after their XVID pre. Thanks. But they did not include
 a sub/idx for the foreign segments with their XVID pre as
 required by TXD2K9. If you add their segments from the
 SUBPACK to each CD, their release is oversize. So here is
 our proper!
 
As an added bonus, you get to enjoy higher bitrate audio from
 our Bluray source!
 
We have included two sub/idx sets, one which contains the English
 subs for only for the foreign language segments, and one marked
 all which contains subtitles for all tracks available on our
 Bluray source
