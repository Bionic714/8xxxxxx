Encoded the 3 Tenchi Muyo movies into high quality MKV video format with English and Japanese Audio and English subtitles as well.

I personally dont know how hard these are to find because I never looked for once, but I can still promise these are probly the best quality ones you will find.

Like the The TV series? I encoded it as well and it can be found in my uploads

Now you can enjoy these movies in an amazing quality, I think they turned out great and looks very good.
For playback all you need is the proper codec if you dont already have it. 
Combined Community Codec Pack (which I prefer) or the K-Lite Codec pack should give you all you need and more to play these back.

You should be able to hear audio just fine if you have one of the mentioned codec packs above. If you cannot hear any audio and do not want to install a codec pack for some reason, then you do not have and need the nero aac audio codec. As of today it can be found here.
