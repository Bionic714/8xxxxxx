"Pilot"

The Americans is a period drama about the complex 
marriage of two KGB spies posing as Americans in 
suburban Washington D.C. shortly after Ronald 
Reagan is elected President. The arranged marriage 
of Philip and Elizabeth Jennings grows more 
passionate and genuine by the day, but is 
constantly tested by the escalation of the Cold 
War. Tensions heighten upon the arrival of a new 
neighbor, Stan Beeman, an FBI agent.
