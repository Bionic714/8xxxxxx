If not do you know of a simple way to convert to srt or should I just wait for one to pop up? Sorry to bother, just wondering. Thanks again."
[V],Acesn8s,2013-01-31T07:32Z,"@ mpenn20 subtitle workshop can convert .sub files into srt in a few minutes mate. this movie has at least 7 languages :P once your done converting them u can join them together with it, then open virtualdub and join the cd's together in 2 minutes mate this is easy peasy to join 2 CDS to 1 avi file read here http://www.afterdawn.com/guides/archive/virtualdub_join_avi.cfm hope this helps :)"

lol I'm just gonna have to wait for someone to upload an .srt.  I'm probably just being dumb but there appears to be a .sub for part b (Subs/argo.2012.proper.bdrip.xvid-sparks-b.sub) but not one for part a? I have no clue, but like I said, probably just me being an idiot.
But anyways, thanks for the upload, much appreciated."

Actors rocked, really really good acting! Quality was great! At site aole.ciroblazevic.com there is Django and Hobbit in HD already, great stuff! Thnx once again for this fantastic movie!"
,ChoGGi,2013-02-17T01:07Z,"@Acesn8s you can't use subtitle workshop on image based subtitles, it only supports text subs (you'd need something with ocr support to convert)

@mpenn20 you can use avidemux or SubRip to convert idx/sub to srt"
