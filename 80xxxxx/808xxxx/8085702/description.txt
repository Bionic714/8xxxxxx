What is HWMonitor

 HWMonitor is a hardware monitoring program that reads PC systems main health sensors : voltages, temperatures, fans speed.
The program handles the most common sensor chips, like ITE┬« IT87 series, most Winbond┬« ICs, and others. In addition, it can read modern CPUs on-die core thermal sensors, as well has hard drives temperature via S.M.A.R.T, and video card GPU temperature.

What is HWMonitor PRO

CPUID HWMonitor Pro is our extended version of the hardware monitoring program HWMonitor. In comparison to its classic counterpart, HWMonitor Pro adds the following features : 

Remote Monitoring
 Watch the sensors of one or several distant PCs through a simple TCP/IP connection. 

Graph Generator
 Save monitoring data and generate logging graphs as bitmap files. 

Improved Interface
 Sensors in system tray, editable sensors labels ΓÇª 

PWM Control
 Fan PWM control (for ESA compliant devices).
