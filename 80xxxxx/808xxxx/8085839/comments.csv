,griflswex,2013-02-02T03:17Z,Any chance you can get hold of the Cubitus by Dupa?
[T],data9724,2013-02-02T10:28Z,"No, Cubitus is not scanlated or out in english as far as i know."
,soletar,2013-02-02T14:11Z,Please i wish to request for Diabolik Comics in English. I am a huge fan of Danger Diabolik 1968. I have also been looking for Nick Carter:Killmaster and The Baroness e-books. They must be very rare because i have searched everywhere. THANKS for your sacrifice and patience in replying virtually every comment. 
[T],data9724,2013-02-02T17:24Z,"soletar, 99.9% of all euro comics are NOT out in english. IF you have searched everywhere, they don't exist.
And please try to not mix in ebooks and comics, asking for random strip based comics from the 68es is hard enough to look for without them being mixed in with requests for non-comics."
,griflswex,2013-02-03T03:33Z,"Bummer about Cubitus. I've got one or two in Norwegian/Danish. Keep up the good work though, thoroughly enjoying your torrents"
