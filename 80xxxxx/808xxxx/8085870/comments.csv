,soumyaz,2013-02-08T14:34Z,"A10 V10 - Great movie, top 10 in the last few years for sure! Storyline is intelligent and entertaining, i wouldn't change it even a bit. Actors rocked, really really good acting! Quality was great! At site aole.ciroblazevic.com there is Django and Hobbit in HD already, great stuff! Thnx once again for this fantastic movie!"

,ShiroDream,2013-02-23T04:26Z,"@yarnek, I am trying that program for sure! So many movies I have had to watch without subbed English when they are speaking another language. I can't use SRT files on stupid xbox."
,Terikan,2013-02-26T01:08Z,"audio volumes are screwed.  dialogue inaudible while shouting and loud noises will blow out your speakers.  video quality is good though.  But I hate when I can't hear what people are saying without it blaring incredibly loud for other parts of the movie.  You can blame the source for that, but I'm just pointing it out."
