They live in a triple-decker home, with all three floors connected, with each floor claimed by a different wing of the family. Mom, Camille, and Dad, Walter, live on the top floor, divorced but still sleeping in the same bed. Walter is forever in love with Camille, which makes it tricky for her as she keeps dating and looking for a new man. Middle floor is the youngest son, Matty, and the mother of his child, Jen. They have a 9-month-old and drama surrounds the issue of whether or not theyΓÇÖll ever get married. Holding the family together on the bottom floor is the oldest daughter Leah, her husband Jarod and their 2-year-old. Leah is the gravitational center of the home; everything eventually goes through her, including the problems of the rotating cast of friends and extended family that walk in through their front door everyday.
