,mtantawy,2013-02-01T21:54Z,"i always wonder how can YIFY releases be that small?
i mean, can anyone explain the HUGE difference in size? and how does that affect quality? if it does"
,pansack,2013-02-02T05:04Z,"YIFY only has 2ch audio output, if you don't have home theater, you can just download YIFY's torrent"
,8ax_,2013-02-02T14:11Z,You'd notice YIFY torrents have horrid quality if you used a higher quality screen.
,DrTeeZee,2013-02-04T07:22Z,"""You'd notice YIFY torrents have horrid quality if you used a higher quality screen. ""

I don't know how you define horrid.  I have a very nice 46"" 1080p LG TV and sitting about 10' away, Yify's 1080p torrents look just as good as BR to me."
,thereisnoother,2013-02-04T23:19Z,"Yes, I have a 58"" Panasonic Plasma and YiFi's torrents look excellent to me as well. Only the sound on his files is a little low and of course in 2ch rather than 5.1, but with Dolby Digital encoding to 5.1 it still sounds quite good. I go to Bozx if I must have 5.1, because his files are also high quality but with native 5.1. I personally don't think the sound adds that much to the file size ..I think it is simply different compression methods used. "
,demzer1,2013-02-05T18:52Z,"YIFY's torrents were great for me when I was watching on my 22 inch HD monitor.  When I went to a 32 inch HD TV screen, the compression artifacts were very evident.  So I am patient and wait for larger files like BOZX's to download now. 

I just never understand the pointless, endless arguing and bitching over compression.  There are so many different providers out there, just find what you want and shut up."
,soumyaz,2013-02-08T14:32Z,"A10 V10 - Great movie, top 10 in the last few years for sure! Storyline is intelligent and entertaining, i wouldn't change it even a bit. Actors rocked, really really good acting! Quality was great! At site aole.ciroblazevic.com there is Django and Hobbit in HD already, great stuff! Thnx once again for this fantastic movie!"
,kaithekilla,2013-02-08T20:05Z,"whaat.. are you kidding me? :) Yifys torrent is nothing compared to the real blu ray's , i have a 55 samsung plasma and a 40 led samsung, and yes there has been maybe three out of twenty movies from yify iv watched that has had very good picture quality, but the rest has had bad picture quality. and ofc, yifys audio is terrible, ment for small people who cant afford a decent sound system. "
,kashaf,2013-02-11T17:31Z,"hey guys i wanna ask something, i have 27 in' LED 1080p HD but when i watch any movie of 1080p or we can say BOZX my picture quality is not that clear as there should be in any 1080p movie.... "
,kashaf,2013-02-11T17:49Z,i mean i can see the pixels i hope anybody out there help me... thnx 
,EddieDingle,2013-02-20T16:57Z,Anyone know if there are foreign language scenes in this that should have hard coded subtitles? Are they? I saw a complaint about it on another torrent.  Seems like a common problem.
,xM-Ax,2013-02-25T00:38Z,can someone tell me if its 5.1 ???
,scrubs1818,2013-03-01T21:05Z,so are the non english speaking parts hard coded or do you have to put the subtitles in manually? i've come across this issue and can't seem to figure out how to get the .srf into the movie. i also use nero to burn it (converting it to dvd first) Any help would be awesome
