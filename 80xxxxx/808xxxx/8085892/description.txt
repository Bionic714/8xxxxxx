Please read:
I'm not uploading the patched executables any more as my account got flagged for posting 'infected' content, MFA shows up as having a suspicious infection on virustotal lol. So deal with it - I'm more than happy to help resolve any problems with the patcher! Please post in the comments below if you have any trouble. :)
----------------

Mono for Android 4.4.55 Executable Patcher (4.4.55.104956787)

Website: http://xamarin.com/monoforandroid
Protection: Packed .NET Executable with license verification.

INSTRUCTIONS

1. Download & Install MFA 4.4.55 from the Official Website.
2. Run Patcher.
3. Click Patch.

--
Prerequisites & Notes:
- The patcher requires .NET Framework 4.0 or higher. :) (http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17718)
- The patcher will only work with version 4.4.55.104956787
- The required assemblies and patch data are packed into the patcher. (There was a problem with the name of the namespace in my last upload, my bad - fixed now)
- If you get any errors, please let me know in the comments.
- If the patcher says "Patching failed, target executable does not match expected MD5." then delete mandroid.exe from "C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\Novell\" (no (x86) if you are using a 32-bit system) then run the installer again and repair the installation.


ENJOY!

If you like the software, buy it!

Cracked with love from New Zealand.

I've left the patcher unpacked, unobfuscated & unconfused so you reversers can reverse it and see that there's nothing dodgy. :)
