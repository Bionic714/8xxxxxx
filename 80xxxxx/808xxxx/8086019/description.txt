 Detailing Dante's early years and set against a contemporary backdrop,
   DmC Devil May Cry will retain the stylish action, fluid combat and
   self-assured protagonist that have defined the iconic series but
   inject a more brutal and visceral edge.

   The Dante of DmC is a young man who has no respect for authority or
   society in general. Dante knows that he is not human, but also that he
   is not like the demons that have tormented him throughout his life.
   Caught between worlds, he feels like an outcast.
