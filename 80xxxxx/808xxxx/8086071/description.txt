Gary Lineker introduces highlights of Arsenal against Liverpool, Manchester United playing host to Southampton, Reading v Chelsea, Tottenham's visit to Norwich, Everton facing West Brom, and West Ham's short trip to Fulham. Arsene Wenger's Arsenal are battling hard to convince critics - and their own fans - that they can finish in the top four while under forward-thinking Welsh manager Brendan Rodgers, Liverpool look to be making genuine progress - and might be an outside bet for Champions League qualification themselves. Meanwhile, Manchester United have swatted aside most teams with the aid of lethal forward Robin van Persie. Promoted club Southampton have shone at times, but will need a miserly defence to stop the expected attacking onslaught. There are also highlights from Tuesday's four Premier League matches, which include QPR against Manchester City.

The studio experts are Alan Hansen and Alan Shearer.
