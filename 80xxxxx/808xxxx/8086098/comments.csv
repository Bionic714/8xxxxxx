please don't NEVER put in your uploaded app registering info in description in this site, they will be block or blacklisted this data."
,luis26x,2013-01-31T17:04Z,"sorry Forgiveness does not spend more, I do not think that I will upload, more apps"
,bjornagainswede,2013-01-31T17:18Z,"Stilll playing games with us I see.... Thankfully I have all these apps...

Maybe someday you'll seed even one of them to 100%"
,luis26x,2013-01-31T18:46Z,"I do not play with anyone, I'm new to the torrential, just upload what I call my friends, so that they can download, sorry I have problems uploading mind. Not that the seeds are very weak and downloads are slow or are detained. Thank you."
,bjornagainswede,2013-01-31T19:32Z,"1) Upload a torrent
2) Stop All other torrents other that those you want to seed
3) seed it until the seed to peer ration in your Client (uTorrent, Transmission etc) is at LEAST 1.25 (17% is a joke... nobody gets the files so what is the purpose of uploading?)
4)Do not post serial numbers, registration info etc  in the torrent descriptions!

your Camtasia torrent was a total joke... 3 days later I deleted the torrent still at 17% and got it from youtube... where no doubt you got it. I will need to wait 30 days to find out if it works (I could resent my system clock... say 60 days in the future... but no point!)

It is NOT the first time you have stopped seeding a torrent at 17%... what is the problem?"
