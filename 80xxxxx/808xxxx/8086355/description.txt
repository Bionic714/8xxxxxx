Your Roadmap to Physical GloryΓÇöOne Step At a TimeΓÇª
In Paul WadeΓÇÖs Convict Conditioning system, no matter what kind of movement youΓÇÖre working on, you focus on a chain of ten progressive exercises. When you master one exercise, you move on to the next, and so on. Because the later exercises build on the earlier ones, they are sometimes called the "ten steps". When you reach the tenth exercise, you will be just about as strong as itΓÇÖs possible for a human being to be in that movement. For this reason, the tenth exercise in any chain is called the "Master Step". How this all works will be crystal clear if youΓÇÖve picked up a copy of the Convict Conditioning bodyweight book.

Why no self-respecting man will forego his pushups
Pushups are a critical part of any bodyweight training routine. HereΓÇÖs why:

ΓÇó The pushup is the best exercise there is for building strength and size in the pectoralsΓÇöone of the real "workhorse" muscle groups of the torso.

ΓÇó  The anterior deltoid, a major shoulder muscle, is connected to the pectoral and gets a hell of a workout from pushups as it transmits the force from the chest to the arms.  

ΓÇó  Pushups also build big, strong triceps along the back of the arms. If you want big arms, you need to work your triceps, because itΓÇÖs the biggest muscle of the armΓÇöat least a third bigger than the biceps.  

ΓÇó  Numerous other muscles have to work hard isometrically to lock you into position as you do your pushups. These muscles include the lats, the abs, the hips and the legs.  

ΓÇó  Pushups also build functional strength. The muscles you use for throwing, pushing, and striking are pretty much the exact same muscles you are building when you work hard on your pushups. Unless you have great pushing strength in the torso, shoulders, triceps and elbows, you canΓÇÖt be considered "strong".

Are you failing to become monstrously strong from pushups because of these mistakes?
Most athletes fail to become monstrously strong at pushup movements, because they only know two or three types of pushup; maybe classic pushups, kneeling pushups, and pushups with the feet up on something. Just having three exercises in your toolbox isnΓÇÖt enough to allow you to maximize your potential. Paul Wade shows you ten different types of pushup, all given in order of difficulty. In fact, many of these steps contain further "hidden steps" within themΓÇöto keep you getting stronger for a lifetime.

In the strength game, fools rush in where angels fear to tread
The wise old Chinese man shouted to his rickshaw driver: "Slow down, young man, IΓÇÖm in a hurry!" If ever a warning needed to be shouted to our nation of compulsive strength-addicts, this would be it. You see them everywhere: the halt, the lame, the jacked-up, the torn, the pain-riddenΓÇöthe former glory-seekers who have been reduced to sad husks of their former selves by rushing helter-skelter into heavy lifting without having first built a firm foundation.

Paul Wade reveals the ten key points of perfect pushup form. The aspects of proper form apply to all your pushups, and theyΓÇÖll not only unlock the muscle and power-building potential of each rep you do, but theyΓÇÖll also keep you as safe as you can be. Bodyweight training is all about improving strength and health, not building up a list of injuries or aches and pains. They are so fundamental, we call them the Ten Commandments of good pushup form.

Obey the Ten Commandments, follow the brilliantly laid out progressions religiously and you simply CANNOT fail to get stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and strongerΓÇösurely, safely and for as long as you liveΓÇª
