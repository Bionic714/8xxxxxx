After trying repeatedly to find DVD rips of Breaking Bad that didn't strip out the subtitles of the Spanish dialogue that appears in some episodes, I finally just put them back in myself.  The episodes contained in this torrent:

207 - Negro Y Azul
301 - No Mas
303 - I.F.T.
306 - Sunset
307 - One Minute
308 - I See You

Sorry Season 4 isn't included. Haven't gotten around to it yet.
