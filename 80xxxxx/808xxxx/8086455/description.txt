Decompilation is the process of transforming a binary executableΓÇöthat is, a compiled programΓÇöinto a higher level symbolic language that is easier for humans to understand. Usually this means turning a program executable into source code in a language like C. Most systems for decompiling can't directly convert programs into 100% source code. Instead, they usually provide an "almost there" kind of intermediate representation. Many reverse compilers are actually disassemblers that provide a dump of the machine code that makes a program work.
