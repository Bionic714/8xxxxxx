,Newtrogic,2013-02-01T03:33Z,Wow this game has no copy protection. It looks like it can be played online right after being installed. 
,maebe,2013-02-01T03:56Z,Confirmed to work. Thank you thenoobish!
,RAMEN00DLE5,2013-02-01T04:20Z,"I CANT recommend this game enough! It is one of the most addictive, interesting, and most importantly unique games I have played in a LONG time! It's the same way I felt the first time I played FLT, another of these ""Indie plus"" type of games that I crave over the likes of games like Far Cry 3 and DMC. GET THIS NOW SOMEHOW ANYHOW but start here with thenoobish's upload. Though I can't remember if I got it from him, any other time I used on of hus ups, I was satisfied. Props noobish! "
,Dewarton,2013-02-01T09:07Z,English - French - German - Polish are the available languages.
,zbiggie,2013-02-01T10:04Z,Great download. Works perfectly except for one song. It stops and starts for no reason. Everything else works well. 
,Bozzanac22,2013-02-01T12:21Z,"what is this """" ANONYMOUS DOWNLOAD """""
,Whomei,2013-02-01T20:36Z,"Hello I've been having a problem with the game and it crashing.  Every time I get to a combat situation and I will get the the load screen then when it sounds like it's about to play it crashes.  I recently burned our my power supply on my nice computer and now I am on a cheap laptop for the time.  The game on low quality seems to run fine without FPS issues .  The download seems to be great besides that , please respond if you got a solution or idea to help. Also if you are getting the same problem. Thankyou!"
,Whomei,2013-02-01T20:38Z,"Not sure if it is this laptop or the actual download , but i'm suprised if its the download due to all the great responses and the issue I have you cant play the game right without."
,nickclone,2013-02-02T04:13Z,"Played the demo and loved it, I can't wait to play this!"
,Dimmis80,2013-02-02T10:56Z,Thanks man awesome upload and it looks like a great game.;-))And a big thanks goes to FLT.Congrats for this release..
,MrBEST,2013-02-02T11:34Z,"BORING AS HELL. I have finished the ""Campain"" in 5h and it is as complicated as farmorama or some other shit like that. I have seen broswerer games with more economic depth than this. And the combat is broken to all hell. You get frequent misses with a 89% chance to hit and frequent hits with a 12 or 17% chance to hit the % are busted or just are there for show. Also the endless game is 2h max you by then have bought everything out and are just there amassing cash since it has no opponents and no goal it is just boring.
Also this is not a Indie game as someone said its made by kalypso and seeing how you jizz all over this game they are propobly older than you are."
,knet_nanawa,2013-02-02T12:17Z,Hey guys I just wanted to ask if any of you know the fix for the crash before the combat mode. It works just fine during the strategic phase of the game then when I go to combat it crashes right after it loads. I barely hear the music then it immediately crash. Anyone know how to fix this?
,JawDroppinDroopBallz,2013-02-03T20:43Z,"Works just fine, but it's soooooooo boring."
,Bytedragon,2013-02-04T13:58Z,Anyone else having graphics trouble? I got weird stripes all over the screen. Even if I turn all the graphics features off. 
,Dalon,2013-02-04T17:32Z,"Good torrent, but terrible game, i feel sorry for people who paid 49.99€ for this crap"
,Bobthemanh3h,2013-02-04T21:22Z,"Anyone else experiencing freeze after approximately 5 minutes of playing? and looks as a great game btw.. to all the people who says it sucks, go play some FPS, this is a strategy/simulation game, l2read game genre really"
,Talkor,2013-02-04T22:40Z,"Fairlight did no work other than putting the installer pointlessly in an ISO file. This is a GOG release, they never have DRM. I recommend everyone find a normal GOG copy because this is just ridiculous."
,ajrodelo,2013-02-14T09:12Z,crashes when i start combat for the first time
,KapNkRUK,2013-02-14T11:47Z,"thenoobish....I dont know if you will see this but I am a huge fan of your uploads and have sent an assload of people your way but now I have a special request...can you upload,

,larryrube,2013-02-26T02:10Z,"Hey thenoobish, do you have an xbox360 version of this? I can only find the DAGGER releases and I have terrible luck with their stuff. Thanks."
,larryrube,2013-02-26T02:54Z,Oh. Now I see that YOU uploaded one of the Dagger ones. That's different. Nevermind. :)
