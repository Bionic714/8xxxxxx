Game information:
=================

"omerta" - A rule or code that prohibits speaking or divulging information
about the activities of a criminal organization.
Bug-eyed Bettys are making a racket with "lips that touch wine, won't kiss
mine" and not minding their own beeswax. The fuzz are busy closing down the
local juice joints and pouring perfectly good spirits down the drain. All
this fuss about liquor sure can drive a man to drink. It isn't easy to wet
one's whistle but there some bootleggers who are always happy to provide as
long as you got the scratch.

Omerta: City of Gangsters puts you into the boots of a fresh-from-the-boat
immigrant with dreams of the big life. Work your way up the criminal
hierarchy of 1920's Atlantic City, starting with small jobs, recruiting new
gang members and expanding your empire by taking territory from other
mobsters. Establish your own crime syndicate and become the de facto ruler
of Atlantic City!
