,AsifAkheir,2013-02-01T11:17Z,"@ levin123

Stereo only. YIFY likes small files and most movies don't really need Surround sound - it takes up too many megabites. For the occasional movie that is really crying out for 6 channels or 5.1 sound, there are many others out there. Off the top of my head I can suggest Ganool or anoXmous. Their files are somewhat larger, yet, still manageable."

,mac_book,2013-02-23T05:42Z,... i could be wrong.
,hotrodhearse,2013-02-23T16:46Z,"@BobRolha...  A movie sold off the shelf as ""720p"" has a maximum resolution of 1280x720, (standard 16:9 format). Many movies however, are not actually presented in 16:9 format. Directors commonly release their movies in 1.85:1 (1280x688 onscreen) or even 2.39:1 (1280x536 onscreen) formats.  To keep the height at 720p, they would need to expand the width past the maximum limit of 1280, but since this is impossible...  the result is a picture that's cropped vertically to recreate the height/width ratio the original director wanted to show. 

Don't blame the person who ripped the copy, it's ripped at the exact resolution of the disc sold off the shelf. Blame the hollywood director who insists on cropping pixels off to make the picture ""wider"" rather than fill the screen. 

And next time, have a clue what you're talking about before spouting off BS about someone who worked hard to give you something of value for free. Shut your trap and stop looking a gift horse in the mouth. 

Thank you YIFY!  Awesome job as usual, and much appreciated."
,sorsxrc35,2013-02-24T06:53Z," Ben Affleck is such an important director. His movies ben afflected my whole generation.

,tflagger997,2013-04-15T21:27Z,"hotrodhearse - You are wrong.  BobRolha was correct and obviously paid attention to the label for this movie.  It is called ""Argo 720p"" not ""Argo 528p"" or ""Argo Aspect Ratio 2.42"".

The # before the p indicates the number of lines of horizontal pixels.  Feel free to Google it.

The teams and mods (yes even mods on TPB are doing it) have to stop this practice of allowing anyone to slap 720p/1080p on files that are not of that quality.  The movie came out with an Aspect Ratio of 2.4 @1080p on BR.  

To be a TRUE 720p release this should have been encoded at ~1730x720, and the 1080p should have been 2600x1080 not x800 like most did (though a few encoded at full 1080p).

People have to start labeling their stuff properly.  I suggest just using OAR (Original Aspect Ratio) and letting people choose the bitrate and file size that is right for them.  They cannot post to HD though as 720p is the minimum for that category, and anything less than ????x720 is not 720p or higher.

I am NOT saying I want every file to be gigantic, I just want to know that when I pick a 720p/1080p that I am actually getting it.  I hate DLing a large file that *claims* to be 1080p and it is only 800p which is a heck of a lot closer to 720 than 1080.

After all that - Thanky YIFY, I just wanted a 700MB version and yours are always excellent for the size!"
,tiz2,2013-04-27T19:38Z,"A: 5 v: 5, Not really hd, too low bit rate"
,ajkulok,2013-05-01T21:54Z,"Thank u YIFI for the great COMPACT SIZE download, and yes, IT IS HD...

And for all of u talking sh*t about YIFI's torrents, WTF DO U EXPECT FROM TORRENTS WITH THIS SIZE? If u want better HD quality, download (1080p) bigger files, they r easy to find, this was created to be viewed on a lap top or a pc and it's great for its purpose, if u wanna watch it on your 72"" TV, don't bother downloading"
,ohhwell,2013-05-05T17:45Z,"@tflagger997: hotrodhearse is completely correct. 720p is used as a classification these days. Since no one shoots movies in 4;3 anymore, the smart thing for the industry to have done was go off of the horizontal resolution. In that case, we would be calling these 1280p or 1920p and no one would be complaining about the vertical resolution out of ignorance.

Why on eath anyone would resize a movie to such an odd size as 2600x1080 is beyond me.

Also, to me, YIFY is killing the HD movie category. These are bitrate starved and although encoded very well, still don't resolve enough information to be classified as HD. These are for mobile devices and there should be a category called Mobile HD or something like that. Those of us that go to HD Movies are looking for a bitrate of at least 2-3Mbps and 5.1 sound. Unfortunately, the popularity in general of the YIFY releases mean that I have to go to page 2 or 3 of the results to start finding true HD quality.

I appreciate what YIFY does with low bitrate but Pirate Bay really needs a new category for this stuff. IT looks like shit on a decent size TV."
