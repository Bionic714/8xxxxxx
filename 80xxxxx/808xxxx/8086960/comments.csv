My first comment after YEARS

Translated instructions:
- Install the program, do not start. We recommend leaving the default installation path.

- Run the Keygen (Sony.Products.Multikeygen.v2.1.Keygen.and.Patch.Only.READ.NFO-DI), after installing the program.

  (Remember in Vista / Seven run as administrator, you can also disable UAC, start -> Control Panel -> User Accounts and Family Safety -> User Accounts -> Turn on or off User Account Control, and uncheck the box ""Use user Account Control (UAC) to help protect your computer"")


- Select the product, in this case ""Vegas Pro 12.0 (64 bit) Series"" (version 12 only works in 64 bit).


- Press the ""Patch"" and locate the program path, then asked to select the plugins folder. Wait ends patched. Do not close the Keygen.
   (Program folder -> C:  Program Files  Sony  Vegas Pro 12.0 )
