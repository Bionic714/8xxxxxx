Synopsis:
On November 4, 1979, while the Iranian revolution was at its peak, some militants stormed the U.S. embassy in Tehran and took Americans fifty-two prisoners. However, in the midst of the chaos, six of them manage to escape and find refuge with the Canadian ambassador. Knowing that it is only a matter of time and are most likely to be killed, a CIA specialist in special operations named Tony Mendez (Affleck) concocts a risky plan to get them out of the country safely. A plan so incredible that just might do well in a movie.

Production notes:
- Based on an article by Joshua Bearman and published by 'Wired Magazine' about a hostage crisis in Tehran, called 'How the CIA Used a Fake Sci-Fi Flick to Rescue Americans from Tehran "(How the CIA used a movie false science fiction to rescue Americans from Tehran).
- Based on true events, Argo tells a secret operation, life or death, to rescue six Americans in the middle of the hostage crisis in Iran. The truth remained hidden from the public for decades.
