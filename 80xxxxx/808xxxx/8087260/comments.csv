[T],SgtRlee,2013-02-01T03:42Z,"Awesome :) thanks for posting this and the previous episode TaagMan, i really appreciate it! 

(and thanks again bombajowy for the previous ones you posted, looks like we will all get to enjoy this soon to be complete season)

*ruankao, did you even read the last episode comments or description? They were downloaded from Usenet, so why complain about it to this poster WHO is going out of their way to SHARE this tough to get show with all of us fans here."
,TaagMan,2013-02-01T10:03Z,"No worries SgtRlee... there's always some retard complaining and yelling seeeed, seeeeeeeed. I don't care... they can just go pull their underlip over their head and swallow for all I care..."
