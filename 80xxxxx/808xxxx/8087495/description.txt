This engineering textbook will provide a focused treatment on the study of how structures behave and perform when under stress loading, including plastic deformation and buckling.
All advanced engineering students studying engineering mechanics, structural analysis and design, fatigue and failure, and other related subjects need to have this knowledge, and this book will provide it in a thorough and coherent fashion.
* An understandable introduction to the theory of structural stability, useful for a wide variety of engineering disciplines, including mechanical, civil and aerospace engineering
* Covers both static and dynamic loads, for both conservative and nonconservative systems
* Emphasizes elastic behavior under loads, including vertical buckling, torsional buckling and nonlinear affects of structural system buckling and stability
* Case examples to illustrate real-world applications of Stability Theory
