I like this movie it is not a usual flick very different but nice:)"
,doritoman,2013-01-31T18:27Z,"The AVC on this one is amazing, i liked having 2 channel audio - as most devices dont support ac-3 or 6 channels, but media coder can convert it to 2 channel audio so im fine with it :)"
,mattshep18,2013-02-01T00:24Z,Is this audio protected so you can't play it on PS3? Anybody?
,doritoman,2013-02-01T01:41Z,"the audio is not protected, but getting it to play on your ps3 will be a challenge, if you want to know how just google it, there are a lot of guides. :)"
,Thizzy88,2013-02-01T14:21Z,"I have requested this a movie a couple times. Awesome!! Thank you. One question, will this play on the Xbox 360? I noticed you don't have the, ""This rip plays very well with PSP and XBOX"" message you always put on your uploads."
,Thizzy88,2013-02-02T03:58Z,"It does in fact play well on the Xbox 360. My only issue is with the audio. It only plays out of one speaker on my sound bar. Not sure if it is the Xbox, the sound bar, or the new way the audio has been encoded. I have no issue with the old 2 channel. Anyways I think this rip is fantastic beside the audio."
,pro346pro,2013-02-02T05:25Z,Just my opinion stick with aac audio its much more more effecient 
,fahim08,2013-02-27T14:14Z,"Thnx to the uploader! Movie was OK as i expected it to be! Storyline is intelligent and entertaining and acters were OK! I usually watch all the movies at film.raeshashop.com because they have HD's but they didn't have this one so im happy to have piratebay :) Good torrent quality - A9 V9,"
