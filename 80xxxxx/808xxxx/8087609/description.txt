Please note that this is the 64bit version.  This version will install onto your Windows computer.  Please do not install this version if you are running the 32bit version of windows and not 64bit; it will not work and you will only waste your own time.


Instructions:

Before installing Jaws 14

Firstly, disconnect from the internet.  I am not going to say why.  Just do it.

Install the file J14.0.1037-64bit.exe

You need to temporarily disable UAC before patching on Vista or seven.

You should also find the jfw.exe and jhook.dll files in the crack-64bit folder which will enable you to crack JAWS.

If you haven't cracked any JAWS version before, just simply paste the two files referenced above to JAWS' program files directory.

To find this, go to Start --&gt; All Programs/Programs --&gt; JAWS 14.0 --&gt; Explore JAWS --&gt; Explore Program Files 

Good luck and remember to share with other visually impaired persons.
