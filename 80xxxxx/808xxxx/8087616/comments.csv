This joker should be blacklisted!

Seeds torrent to 17% max
Rarely posts the correct description or version number
posts registration and serial information in the torrent description
Uploads files that are nowhere even c lose to the actual size of the applications!

Luis , go spend some time at the swimming pool or the beach... a lot of time....forever even. Check out the girls (or boys) but please leave torrents alone.... Not your thing dude!"

,bjornagainswede,2013-02-01T00:11Z,"Luis... you are trying to convert everything to dmg... See the comment I made on your new screenflow torrent!

If you are using an application like dropdmg or similar your settings are messed up... DMG should make file sizes smaller not 2x as large!

If you are using Disk Utility you do not know what you are doing... look for a tutorial!"
