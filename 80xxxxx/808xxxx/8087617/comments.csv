,JustRacey,2013-02-01T04:22Z,@Drone- download the FREE VLC player and then you won't have to worry about what format the file is in! Yesh! Or get one of the suggested free converters or buy the AVS whole package of makers and converters cheaply

Can't find em anywhere & Addicted says they came out Jan 20/27...if you could find & up them, I(& many others I'm sure) would be forever grateful :) Finally start to get hooked on this show & they cancel it & now can't find last 2 Ep's that will hopefully explain everything!
