&gt;&gt;Abstract:

Barcelona, for one exhilarating night is the World Capital of Shared Culture. Artists and performers from all areas of Spanish and international culture take part in a ΓÇ£GalaΓÇ¥ with all kind of surprises, pooling their efforts to demand a stop to culture being treated as merchandise by royalty management organisations and cultural industry lobbies. Artists say ΓÇ£Not in my nameΓÇ¥ to the commercialisation of culture, ΓÇ£Not in my nameΓÇ¥ to limiting the potential of digital media and to criminalization of the Internet. Civil society demands the ΓÇÿlost profitsΓÇÖ of all the knowledge that is being withheld and stolen from public use in the name of private profits and asks for a free development of new sustainable models for creation and distribution of culture.
