How Hard Can It Be?
After ten years of building wacky inventions, engineer Vin Marshall teams up with two of his oldest friends; mechanical engineer Paul Carson and inventor Eric Gocke, to build some of the zaniest engineering feats ever attempted. Tackling everything from robo subs to homemade rockets, the daring trio stop at nothing to break records, push boundaries and capture imaginations with their mind-bending inventions. Look out for attempts at record-breaking feats that have never been attempted before. For instance, the boffins take on the impossible task of making an entire house fly with a giant cluster of helium balloons just like in the Pixar film 'Up'. Will the team successfully recreate one of the most magical moments in film history, or will they be left deflated?
