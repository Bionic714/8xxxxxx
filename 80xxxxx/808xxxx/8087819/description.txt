The Cleveland Show - Season 4 - Episode 8 (WEB-DL - 1080p)
----------------------------------------------------------

Cleveland Brown (Mike Henry) and his family and friends are back for more
shenanigans in the upcoming fourth season of The Cleveland Show! This season,
Cleveland discovers a conspiracy behind hip-hop music; pursues his dream of
becoming a Major League Baseball scout; and befriends the family's new physician,
Dr. Fist (recurring guest voice Bryan Cranston). Also, Donna takes her run for
local office way too seriously, and Cleveland Jr. takes Rallo under his wing
after a lice outbreak at school forces him to chop off his beloved 'fro.

Produced by Fuzzy Door Productions and 20th Century Fox Television.

The Brown-Tubbs family travels the world in a hilarious series of
internationally-themed segments. First, the Stoolbend-based clan
is in Italy where Cleveland must choose between Rallo and Jr. as
his family's successor in this mob-style parody. Then, in Mexico,
Junior insists on having a Quinceanera, even though he's a boy.
Next, in Japan, Cleveland builds a robot to attend Junior's eating
competition when he can't be there himself.
