You may, if you can, either want to edit the torrent or edit the description to give them the updated translation.  You have v3, but there's a final version now.  Just a suggestion."

Btw, I have my computer set to japanese locale (i.e. not using AppLocale)"

Had no problem here, just mounted and installed.
Setup was unreadable (letters were mostly squares), cause i didn't changed my settings, but is pretty obvious which buttons are used to install.
Copy the patcher to the game's directory, run it, and that's it.
Running pretty well here, didn't even needed to change any Windows region setting."
,JayVeeDee,2013-03-07T01:25Z,"Thanks, works great... Until I try to move it from where it was installed in the first place -.- I installed it in the ""programs"" folder ofc. But then I wanted to move the folder to another destination and so I did, after that when I tried to play the game, the launcher wouldn't launch the game. I read that this problem is known in the ""readme"" file, the solution was to download some new launchers, which I tried and both didn't work..
Is this only because I moved it, or is this something else? Because if this is because I only moved the folder, then it's really lame -.-"
