,colt450011,2013-02-01T04:19Z,"thanks man, been looking forward to this one."
,PSYCHO602,2013-02-03T12:19Z,This album rocks however I already knew that! Please do not download this album unless you plan on buying. Kevin Mann is cool dude and deserves every penny he makes. Believe it or not Lynch ain't a rich dude and he does the music outta passion not for the money however how can he support his family and afford to smoke a few blunts and drink a few beers between album releases. The people who leaked this album stole this album out of the distribution center that Strange music paid for. Underground artists work hard to supply you with decent music and show major love when they meet a fan. Rob the mainstream they sell everything and rob anyone and everyone to get rich. Just something to think about.

Tell me you honestly think Tech N9ne or anyone signed to the Strange Music record label gives two shits.... Seriously, you must not know what they're about. They don't care if people download their album ""illegaly."" In fact, I believe Tech himself has openly told people to download his music because it ain't about the fame, it's about the word, the knowledge, and the message he raps about. I can't quote him, but I am positive he said something along those lines... TRANSLATION:Stop your bitchin ninja."

Studio recording costs thousands of dollars and producing hard copies of this album, distributing them, writing the songs, and other record label stuff costs thousands of dollars for people.

the point isn't ""art should be free"" or ""But tehc n9ne sed!!11!!"" it's that somebody put a great deal of time and effort and shit into something, and regardless of whether or not they demand it,you should respect their sacrifices and throw them a couple bucks if you really like the album. Sure most people would rather be heard than paid but why not give them both and be a decent human being?

Being nice makes the world go around and $10 bucks is a plate of fast food. Don't be a douche :)"
