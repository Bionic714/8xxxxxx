 Erwin Brecher, "Surprising Science Puzzles"
English | 2006 | ISBN-10: 8122202179 | PDF | 96 pages | 5 MB

A collection of puzzles drawn from unusual situations that occur in science and nature. How can a battleship float in a few hundred gallons of water? Why does a bird cage weigh the same whether the bird is flying or perching? These puzzles are an infuriating blend of the obvious and the elusive.
