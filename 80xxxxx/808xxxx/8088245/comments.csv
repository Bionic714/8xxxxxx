,Farzin67,2013-02-12T07:40Z,"R2 is only in x64.
No SP1 included! so think twice before downloading this!!"
[H],[KROSIS],2013-02-14T01:16Z,"For the comment about only x64, there were both x86 and x64 discs in the package, both labeled R2.  But you are correct in that it does not contain SP1. :("
[H],[KROSIS],2013-02-15T09:39Z,"Correction: This IS NOT R2, the earlier comment is correct.  I checked the discs/package today and it is NOT R2.  Will be getting and ULing R2 tomorrow.  Sorry guys. :("
