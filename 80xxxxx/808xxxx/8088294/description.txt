Action based FPS game, with many ways to kill people...really many, so many that it is just too fun!

Games interface language is russian, but the game it self i mean by audio and subtitles are english. I have not figured how to fix the interface language to english, but if someone figures it out, please share. BTW this is an Unoffiacial Cider Port.

Works perfectly, so enjoy.
