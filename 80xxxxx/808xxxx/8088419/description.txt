'Spring Security 3.1' is an incremental guide that will teach you how to protect your application from malicious users. You will learn how to cleanly integrate Spring Security into your application using the latest technologies and frameworks with the help of detailed examples.
This book is centred around a security audit of an insecure application and then modifying the sample to resolve the issues found in the audit.
The book starts by integrating a variety of authentication mechanisms. It then demonstrates how to properly restrict access to your application. It concludes with tips on integrating with some of the more popular web frameworks. An example of how Spring Security defends against session fixation, moves into concurrency control, and how you can utilize session management for administrative functions is also included.
"Spring Security 3.1" will ensure that integrating with Spring Security is seamless from start to finish.
