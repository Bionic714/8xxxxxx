,god0fwar,2013-01-31T21:57Z,This looks like a real one not the fake that came out a little while ago.
,Sonicfan244,2013-01-31T22:13Z,@god0fwar Yes it is the real one. :3
,cuki147,2013-01-31T23:14Z,Anyone else noticed they removed the vote up and down feature on torrents? why?! O_O 
,aky08,2013-02-01T16:39Z,"Mr.Stifmeister

Great Upload."
,sgleon,2013-02-01T16:46Z,"the game installs fine, but i can't see the track or the cars. so it is an invisible car on an invisible track.
anyone knows how to fix?"
,JohnPaoki,2013-02-01T23:27Z,"1. Anyone find config files to change resolution to 1080p?

2. How can I play this with cordless Logitech Rumblepad 2 gamepad? 

3. Will XBox 360 gamepad work?"
,dcastrou,2013-02-02T03:59Z,@JohnPaoki you need to run first launcher.exe on your installation directory to select resolution and yes the xbox controller works 
,sonicfan2,2013-02-02T05:41Z,does this work with a ps3 controller too because a ps3 controller has the same properties as a computer gamepad does
,bud4hugs,2013-02-02T12:15Z,I only wonder... will I be able to play this through LAN on Tunngle Network?
,Sansname,2013-02-02T15:38Z,"Works great. 

Xbox 360 controller works perfectly. As for PS3 controllers, I can't confirm if they work or not as I'm using a 360 controller although I've had success using PS3 controllers with games in the  past using the MotionInJoy drivers. They have an emulation feature that tricks games into thinking you have a 360 controller plugged and everything usually works flawlessly."
,Marcus101RR,2013-02-02T22:04Z,"This game needs a CRACK FIX, this game crashes way to often with ""Has Stopped Responding Error""."
,dogoserf,2013-02-04T09:58Z,"Works great thanks!  Only problem is I can't save game, have to restart profile everytime, any idea why?"
,Sus_K,2013-02-05T04:57Z,Yeah.. how the hell can you save and make a profile...? 
,Basnagus,2013-02-06T02:10Z,Game works fine with PS3 controller using MotioninJoy DS3 tool . Played with 2 controllers split screen in 1080 . Win 7 64 . Run as admin. I find this game really hard especially the drifting.
,Marcus101RR,2013-02-06T23:49Z,Save Game Location please? i need to backup my saves before i wipe.
,mab5ter,2013-02-08T20:33Z,does anyone know of a multiplayer crack for tungle?
,Rooseph,2013-02-10T03:34Z,"Those wishing to download, It says at the start, because steam is offline...no saves or replays will be available or something.

Who knows a solution to said problem?"
,frncsjmnz,2013-02-11T00:34Z,"same problems as sgleon, and i have updated my display drivers"
,Xoncom,2013-02-16T22:17Z,"Symantec is saying that the crack is a virus? My guess is that it is a false positive, any confirmation of this?"
,alday316,2013-02-23T07:48Z,"Visit this website and follow instructions to fix the ""not saving"" problem ->

,KumaL,2013-02-26T18:26Z,"I have problem!!!! 

When start the launcher, mouse arrow always goes to upper left corner, can´t change the settings. Tried mouse out the port or other joypad – problem stays the same

How can fix this? "
,hell911,2013-03-19T09:07Z,"i can't see the tracks and characters/cars.

my computer meets the requirements.

how to fix this??

and my drivers are all updated. "
,hell911,2013-03-21T02:48Z,"alright , got to know WHY the tracks and other textures are missing.

because the Video Card doesnt support INTZ. search for this in google and find out.

they released a guide for this for Steam users, but we, we need to wait."

,.anarchy,2013-03-26T01:20Z,Tomorrow we will start playing this over at ECHOcore GAMING! youtube*dot*com/echocoregaming ! :) JOIN US
,eraser007,2013-03-27T23:48Z,Game works on Win7-64bit. Thank you.
,EatSox,2013-05-13T16:01Z,"- Launcher.exe in game folder can change the resolution and other things. Run as admin if can't open.

- Using Launcher.exe can also find the detailed control settings, and can edit them.
BTW the basic controls are:
Direction keys for directions;
WSAD to Flip (when flying);
E fire weapon.
Shift to run;
Space drift;

- If the the machine auto shut down after playing this game for awhile, like what I occurred, it might because of CPU overheating. Using Core Temp or Speccy can check out current CPU temperature. Core Temp or Intell or Google can tell the highest allowed temperature of a CPU. (May shown as Junction Temperature, Tj. Max, or TJUNCTION.)

- To lower the CPU temperature when playing this game, I found turning off V-Sync will making a noticeable difference on my machine. Launcher.exe have this option. (Graphics, Define, V-Sync Off.)

- Update for this game is here: (No other updates needed to install this. Metal Sonic & Outrun DLC included.) https://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8349818/Sonic.and.All.Stars.Racing.Transformed.Update.2-RELOADED

- Okay, my bitching is over. Nice game, really fun."
