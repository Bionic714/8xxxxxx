Before going home they drop in at rave party nearby. Mike is a police detective who has been working on a case called The Hounds for a long time. In the morning the friends meet up however Martin is late due to a hangover. After a 2 hours walk they choose a clearing and put up the tents. Dave trips over a human limb protruding from the ground. They unearth a buried corpse which has a bag wrapped around its head. In the meantime Mike is shadowing the man with the scar. From that moment a bloody series of events will change their life forever. How are these parallel stories connected? And what terrible discovery will Sarah make? Nothing is quite as it appears.
