,Ponsh,2013-02-02T02:07Z,2 gb is pretty hefty. I personal think you coluld get away with compressing it/lowering the quality as it's only a highlights package and not 'life of pi' for example (where prestine quality is absolutely essential). I appreciate the upload nevertheless and I am downloading it anyway. Much love
