****** Weston - Discography (1995-2009) [MP3@192-320] ******


  Named after guitarist Dave Weston's parents (for allowing the band to rehearse in their basement), the self-deprecating punk band Weston formed in 1990. Like few bands before them, Weston tapped into the emotions of teen-angst, surviving high school and first crushes and turned those into some of the catchiest songs ever written. After the release of Got Beat Up, the bassist/singer Chuck Saltern left the band and future releases were more Pixies-esque and less Descendents-like then the early releases. At one point, it looked like Weston was going to be huge; there wrote better songs than Blink-182 and were a hundred times more fun. But conflicts within the band drove Weston to an early grave. If Greg ever writes the Go-kart book he has promised us, the chapters on Weston will be one of the most interesting
