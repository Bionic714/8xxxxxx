Notes :

Decided to give this one a go
Took the original Hive CM8 release [Thanks]
First off we changed the framerate to a standard form to try and eliminate the stutter
video was nice as is, (apart from the stutter) but did our own thing and tweaked hue, gamma, saturation, brightness, contrast and sharpend up a bit
The audio was stripped and completly reworked creating Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE 6 channels in sound forge then mixed down in vegas
all in all the video has a lot less stutter (although minimally still present) and the audio now has a nice beef to it
We left the CM8 Hive Edition water mark at the begining in, out of respect for bringing the source :bow:
sample included.
