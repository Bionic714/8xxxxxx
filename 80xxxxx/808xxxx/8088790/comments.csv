,Gistix,2013-02-01T06:17Z,"No, It says ""Before installing the client Steam, the game should already be registered on the account"" it means, you gotta buy the game, its like, if you won't make pre purchase, you can download it here, then when you can, you purchase and install it, get it?"

,sawnik,2013-02-07T16:13Z,"The game works and it was easy to install but there are some MAJOR graphics problems for me. The Selection screen keeps blinking and the HUDS vibrate. And there is no water and every time I fly in the game, my game gets smudgef by particles on  the screen making it hard to play. I DESPERATLEY NEED HELP ON THIS. Anyone?"
