,matrix_hacker_neo,2013-02-01T03:56Z,"Graphics updated a bit, a little bit sharper.  Various bug fixes (it crashes less than the first edition).  NO HOT COFFEE MOD."
,matrix_hacker_neo,2013-02-01T04:28Z,"Oh, and the game has a version of DEP (Data Execution Prevention) built in, so most trainers and no cd cracks won't work with this version.  But if you just mount the ISO image anytime you want to play the game, then you will be fine"
,Arcrammer,2013-02-03T00:07Z,Will it work with Windows 8? I'll be finding out the hard way...

@matrix_hacker_neo:

It is great to know us that u have posted an exact original untouched copy of GTA SAN ANDREAS DVD disk. Man are u sure this game is a second edition because in this game's read me in the installation it still says v1.0. I have both the games now one is older v1.0 from someone and one is this yours copy. You never posted the crack in the folder of this torrent. If there is no crack then how to play your game. I get an error no cd found. "
