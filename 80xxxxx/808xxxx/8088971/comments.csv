,Bikkit,2013-02-01T04:49Z,"Thanks for the GSL uploads. 

grr3434 proleague is uploaded to youtube. search for esportstv and you should find it. Unless it's unavailable in your country which would be sad."
,SC2Superbibi,2013-02-01T11:17Z,Thanks for the upload. Proleague is available in english or only in Korean ?
,SoniStreet,2013-02-01T12:13Z,I will not be uploading SK Planet's Proleague. They are available in Korean on YouTube.
