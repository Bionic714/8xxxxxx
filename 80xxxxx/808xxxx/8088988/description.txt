Antonis, a 25 year old Russian immigrant, lives and works at a gas station in Larisa, a small town north of Athens. Ambitious and eager to climb the social ladder, he is also romantically involved with his boss's daughter, Natasa, who he plans to marries.
The story begins with Adonis returning to Athens to introduce his bride to be to his mother Rina (55) and brother Lefteris (20), a schizophrenic. Adonis's visit unravels family dynamics and deep-running problems that haunt all of them: Lefteris yearns his brother's love while living through a part long gone, Adonis tries to overcome his guilt over Lefteris and deals with the consequences of rejecting his roots and Rina unwillingly suffocates Adonis over shadowing Lefteris.
