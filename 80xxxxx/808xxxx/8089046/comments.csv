,G1Convoy,2013-02-02T08:20Z,I am having trouble with this Game for some reason the chracters or the Tracks wont appear what can I do to fix it 
,dothackjhe,2013-02-05T08:36Z,"@G1Convoy Try updating your computer's video card driver and / or necessary files. Otherwise, your computer can't process the game at all (i.e. outdated hardware)."
,daveyt88,2013-02-05T21:41Z,I can't use crack for this game because of stupid malware!
,atf_Mart,2013-02-07T20:24Z,wtf says it haves malware! steam_api.dll obfuscator.xz DONT DOWNLOAD!
,blizzard_beast,2013-02-08T00:26Z,"Thanks extremezone ! Great torrent , and you made it very simple and easy to instal it.

To all you NOOBS complaining about 'malware' and 'viruses' when installing the game : simply DISABLE whatever anti-virus you are using (AVG in my case) 

Once you do that everything is copacetic.I've installed the game and IGNORED the virus b/s warnings and everything went smoothly. 

Why don't you people TRY other options or Google for answers instead of leaving whinny and ungrateful comments?

The game works 100%.

If it didn't I would not be here writing all the praises.

Great game by the way.Brings me back to my childhood days!

Thanks again extremezone !!! "
,blizzard_beast,2013-02-08T00:35Z,"And to people like JohnPaoki : 

You are the prime example of (some) ungrateful,stupid and annoying people here at TPB ,who are getting shit for free yet they want the world to stop and help them figure everything out. 

I quote you :

1. Anyone find config files to change resolution to 1080p?

2. How can I play this with cordless Logitech Rumblepad 2 gamepad?

3. Will XBox 360 gamepad work? 

1.Yes

2.I don't fuckin' know.Plug the bitch in and try it!

3.Read number 2 

Fucking do some legwork you lazy ass! 

What else can we help you with??? Want us to make you an omelet and go buy you a winning lottery ticket while we're at it???

Some people ,I swear ... "
,CommonsCarnival,2013-02-12T02:22Z,It's a fun game to try out but remember that you wont be able to save your progress. This hurts all the more because my version seems to crash periodically for some reason.
,Fluoresance,2013-02-12T03:56Z,"I've looked everywhere.. and I see it on a lot of these different torrents... but it seems no one has done any work to maybe find a way to get the game to save..

If I could save.. would make the game so much better.. "
,assem_h,2013-02-15T13:45Z,anyone knows where can i get the music played while installing the game? I want to download it
,assem_h,2013-02-15T13:48Z,i want the music played while installing. anyone can help ?

,_Rick_pogi,2013-02-19T13:56Z,thanx extremezone your the best :)
,notloc24-7,2013-02-26T06:05Z,"@extremezone     hey im not sure if im doing something wrong, but im wondering if your able to save with this torrent?? All your torrents work flawlessly including this one (except for saving) and im very grateful. keep up the awesome work"
,chiruscan,2013-02-26T08:19Z,I downloaded this and updated my video drivers and it showed the tracks and characters the first few times i played then after that they disappeared.
,hell911,2013-03-19T08:56Z,"i can't see the tracks and characters/cars.

my computer meets the requirements.

how to fix this?? 

and my drivers are all updated."
,hell911,2013-03-21T02:49Z,"alright , got to know WHY the tracks and other textures are missing.

because the Video Card doesnt support INTZ. search for this in google and find out.

they released a guide for this for Steam users, but we, we need to wait."
