,figkikeron,2013-02-01T14:25Z,the game warns me that i can't save without having STEAM client installed? isn't there any other way to make the game save my progress? 
,JohnPaoki,2013-02-01T23:28Z,"1. Anyone find config files to change resolution to 1080p?

2. How can I play this with cordless Logitech Rumblepad 2 gamepad? 

3. Will XBox 360 gamepad work?"
,dcastrou,2013-02-02T03:59Z,@JohnPaoki you need to run first launcher.exe on your installation directory to select resolution and yes the xbox controller works 
,DoctorWatson,2013-02-03T11:07Z,"This file is an .exe and not an .iso, is there any confirmation that it is safe to launch?"
,pedoncho,2013-02-03T14:49Z,"""the program can't start because steam_api.ll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem""

......dude......is THAT hard to test the stupid game ONE FUCKING TIME?"
,pedoncho,2013-02-03T15:00Z,"Had to put the steam_api.dll into the game folder....but you cant save....tried playing, my usb game pad didtn even works......tried changing controls...it says you configure it FROM STEAM...
