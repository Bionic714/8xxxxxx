,TheLathe,2013-02-02T09:31Z,"This is REALLY weird.  The page here shows 3 seeders; my client (UTorrent) shows about 70 seeders but with none of them seeding.  It shows about 200 peers total, but NONE of the seeders that are supposed to be there are in fact actually showing as seeding [they are all inside the '()']

I'm at 80% and it is just sitting there...

Any ideas why this is?  When I look at the detailed info for the torrent, it shows ALL of the URLs 'INVALID'

Weird huh...?"
,TheLathe,2013-02-02T09:36Z,"That's okay...

I found a Russian / English torrent on BITSNOOP that is about 13 Gigs; I'm getting that one...

Thanks though!!!

But, if you CAN figure out what the hell is happening with this one, it would be nice to know."

Hmmmm. I'm showing one seed too (which is mine) which is weird seeing as how after I posted it had up to 7. Maybe a lot of hit and runs? I'll let it seed for a few days though, and hopefully it'll gain more seeds!"
