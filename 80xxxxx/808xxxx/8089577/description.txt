From the Infowars web site :: On this Thursday, January 31 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks about war clouds gathering over the Middle East following an Israeli attack inside Syria. He also talks about more than 1,000 Green Berets re-asserting their oath to support and defend the Constitution by protecting the second amendment rights of American citizens as the federal government continues its effort to deprive Americans of firearms.
