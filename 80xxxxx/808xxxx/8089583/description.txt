Here are 37 excellent Sherlock Holmes old time radio dramas from
1959 to 1969, all individual MP3's, good to excellent quality.

Features Hobbs and Shelley.

These are not audio books but actual dramatizations, all episodes
are from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's original stories.

Total running time over 16 hours, about 26 minutes per show.

Also uploading separately, 15 Sherlock Holmes old time radio
dramas featuring Geilgud and Richardson from 1955.  I can not
decide which sets are better, the Geilguds or the Hobbs.  Both
though are the best Sherlock I have heard and better than any
Sherlock movies I have seen.  The only thing better is reading
the original stories.  Enjoy.
