An astonishing double-album documentation of a great band at the peak of its powers, Sleeper fatures a complete and previously unreleased concert recording of Jarrett's 'European Quartet', otherwise known as 'Belonging', at Tokyo's Nakano Sun Plaza in April 1979. The pieces played, all composed by Jarrett, are "Personal Mountains", "Innocence", "So Tender", "Oasis", "Chant of the Soil", "Prism" and "New Dance". Exceptional improvisational exchanges, dynamic episodes of surging energy, and lyrical passages of wild beauty abound. The interplay between Jarrett and Garbarek is uncanny and the Danielsson/Christensen rhythm team swings wildly and delightfully. After more than three decades in ECM archive, this "Sleeper", newly mixed in Oslo, now awakes in all its glory.

The double album Sleeper contains a previously unreleased live concert by Keith Jarrett's European quartet from the '70s, recorded at Tokyo's Nakano Sun Plaza on April 16, 1979. Together with saxophonist Jan Garbarek, bassist Palle Danielsson, and drummer Jon Christensen, Jarrett performs seven of his own compositions: "Personal Mountains," "Innocence," "So Tender," "Oasis," "Chant of the Soil," "Prism," and "New Dance" -- the latter song being the shortest here at seven minutes, while "Oasis" clocks in at over 28 minutes! As a companion piece to the live albums Nude Ants and Personal Mountains (both recorded the same year, even though the latter album was only released in 1989), Sleeper offers another noteworthy document of the creative interplay between these four musicians.
