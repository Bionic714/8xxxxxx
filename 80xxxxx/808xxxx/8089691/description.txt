WriteItNow407f Complete

I have tried with o2ugla's torrent ttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8050859/WriteItNow__4.0.7f___Serial for some time and, like everyone else, remained stuck at 99.8%! Then I read the list more carefully - I tried jackjake's suggestion (although I knew that it would not work as Torrents just don't work that way!) and sure enough it did NOT work!

Then I noticed the last entry by o2ugla, with the registration details so I decided to download the latest file from Ravensheadsservices (http://www.ravensheadservices.com/download.php) and then used the registration details from o2ugla and it WORKED for me!

Better act fast as the details may get blocked. I have included the Windows download (for W7, W8, XP and Vista) and the registration details supplied by o2ugla - in the txt file.

My thanks to o2ugla for the original Torrent and to jackjake for giving me the idea.

Cheers ... digimike50
