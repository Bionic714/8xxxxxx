"A View to a Kill"

When Rebekah turns down Klaus' plea to stop Kol and 
protect Jeremy, Klaus turns to Stefan for help. 
After an angry confrontation with her father, Mayor 
Hopkins, over his unconventional approach to ending 
the violence in Mystic Falls, Bonnie has a 
frightening run-in with Kol, followed by an 
unexpected visitor. Klaus complicates the already 
tense feelings between Stefan and Damon by 
revealing a bit of Stefan's personal life, then 
surprises Damon by asking for personal advice. 
Elena tells Stefan about her dangerous plan for 
Jeremy, leaving Stefan in a difficult spot. When 
the high school's 1980s Decade Dance is cancelled 
by Mayor Hopkins, Stefan finds a charming way to 
make it up to a disappointed Rebekah.
