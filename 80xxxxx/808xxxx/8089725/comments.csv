I usually watch all the movies at film.hdkalitesi.com because they have HD's but they didn't have this one so im happy to have piratebay :) Thnx once again for this great share!"

Gosh... So glad you decided to share this important announcement with the world tororo. I think i speak for everyone when i say that your personal satisfaction is the most important consideration.
