Your Minecraft 0.5.0 worked fine, so I'm not sure what's up with this one."
,Fruitcaked,2013-02-01T16:28Z,"People are writing on playstore about crashing when writing signs, so its the game itself. This upload is fine. Personally i can write signs without any problem on my Note n7000. "

,Cydran,2013-02-01T22:10Z,"@Fruitcaked: ah, okay. It's good to hear that the compatibility didn't just randomly change, because my Samsung Galaxy Note is fairly new, and is up-to-date. Thank you for the info. :)"
