What seems to be the problem? Does it run and close, does it not recognize command, errors? I need some info to troubleshoot and see what the problem may be."
,haydenhayden011,2013-02-02T04:57Z,I can't figure out how to get the installer to work.
,C41337,2013-02-02T11:07Z,"Well it starts up the installer normally, I then waited ten minutes and it wasn't installed yet, so I checked the details bar and it said cannot find xaos.jar"
,AppRipper,2013-02-02T14:45Z,"@C41337

Right-click on the .app, Click ""Show Package Contents"", Contents > Resources, Then verify that ""twnz.zip"" is located there, if it is delete the file ""delete_me_to_reinstall.txt"" then start the application up and it should re-install the unnecessary files."
