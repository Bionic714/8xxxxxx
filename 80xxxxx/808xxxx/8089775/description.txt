Towns brings a fresh new take on the citybuilding/management genre by introducing many RPG features.
 
Drawing inspiration from games such as Diablo, Dungeon Keeper and Dwarf Fortress, the game has you managing a settlement on top of an active dungeon. Instead of playing the hero who delves deep into the dungeon, how about playing the town that houses and caters to the hero's needs?
 
Both the RPG and strategic aspects will be fleshed out over a series of sprawling dungeons.
 
Craft unique weapons, obtain randomized loot and build a settlement capable of holding back the forces that come up from the depths!

This is a totally new idea thought up by me because of my shitty bandwidth. Instead of uploading all the required files with the torrent I created an installer that downloads and installs the game for you! I hope mac fans enjoy their chance to trial this game! The devs are awesome so if you like the game please buy it!

The file is only around 500KB nice and easy for both of us!

PLEASE SEED! YOU WILL GET CAKE!

BTW leave a comment of what you think, if something breaks I'll reup but I'll never know if you don't tell me!
