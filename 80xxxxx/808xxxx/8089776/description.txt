"Junior Salesman"

Dwight is tasked with hiring a part-time 
salesman to be Jim's substitute, so he rounds 
up a supergroup of his cronies, including his 
oddball beet-farmer cousin, Mose; Pam is left 
wondering who her new deskmate will be; Erin 
seeks her birth parents with help from Pete.

Evolve... or die.

Enjoy :)
