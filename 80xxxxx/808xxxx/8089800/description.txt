Um, I've never made a torrent before so please don't hate me if I did something wrong?

I had wanted to watch Motor City after hearing some people talk about it but I couldn't find a torrent that had the whole series. After a while I finally got fed up and just downloaded each individual episodes from various torrents and websites and figured I would post a torrent with them all together?
They were also all out of ode and some of them were labeled wrong so it was vary confusing. I just relabeled them according the the episode number and guide I read from wikipedia so hopefully they're all correct.

So thanks to the people who gave me the individual episodes as I couldn't have gotten them without them.

The files vary from .avi,.mkv, and .mp4.
They're all decent quality I think, I haven't actually watched them yet I just skimmed them to check if they were okay. They're definitely watchable in my opinion. So I hope you guys like the torrent... ;^;

Enjoy
