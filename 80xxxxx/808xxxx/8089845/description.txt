Not for the faint-hearted listener, this 1970 soundtrack album to a medical documentary entitled "The Body" was created by avant-garde composer Ron Geesin & Pink Floyd bassist/singer/composer Roger Waters (Geesin & Waters would work together again on Pink Floyd's "Atom Heart Mother," but "Music From The Body" was their first joint project). The album is pretty wild stuff to say the least, with lots of experimental sounds, instrumentation, vocals and effects. The wonderfully goofy opening cut, "Our Song," with it's rhythmic sound collage of clapping, belching, farting and baby noises (accompanied by ragtime piano, no less!), pretty much prepares you for what will follow. But in between Geesin's far-out pieces (other highlights include the vocal experiments of "More Than Seven Dwarfs...", the spooky "Body Transport," and the fun "Mrs. Throat Goes Walking"), Roger Waters drops in to play some very nice, simple acoustic numbers, like "Sea Shell And Stone," "Chain Of Life," and "Breathe" (a very different song from the "Breathe" that appeared later on Floyd's classic "Dark Side Of The Moon," although it shares the same opening lyric: "Breathe in the air"). Finally, the rest of Pink Floyd themselves---David Gilmour, Nick Mason and Richard Wright---join Waters at the album's end for the uplifting finale, "Give Birth To A Smile." "Music From The Body" is definitely not an album to play at a party, but if you're a diehard fan of early Pink Floyd, then I think you'll enjoy this weird, wonderful record from Ron Geesin & Roger Waters.
