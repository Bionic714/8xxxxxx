"a big, beautifully dreamy sound with mainly just two guitars, delays, vocals and percussion, conjuring droning landscapes and beautiful harmonies not dissimilar to The Beach Boys. For me, this album reminds me of so many things, all of them good, portraying a blissful ambience.." - Wayne Stronell, cyclicdefrost.com
