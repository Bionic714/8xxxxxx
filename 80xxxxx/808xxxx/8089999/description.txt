Jesse Thomas is the perfect example of a giant musical fireball in a small package. Her raspy, distressed vocals and straight-forward lyrics make for a big emotional sound on every song she releases.

ItΓÇÖs been two years since Jesse released her debut EP, Hazel, and exactly one year since Starbucks featured her song, ΓÇ£You I WantΓÇ¥, as their free download artist of the week. This month, Jesse is releasing her debut LP, War Dancer. The ever-catchy ΓÇ£You I WantΓÇ¥ is on the album along with 10 previously unreleased tracks. Overall, the record is beautifully produced to showcase the emotional complexity yet honest simplicity of JesseΓÇÖs writing. Tracks like ΓÇ£Song For YouΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£FireΓÇ¥ feel so close that itΓÇÖs like JesseΓÇÖs singing in your living room.

There are also some faster tracks like ΓÇ£Back to FightingΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£Already MineΓÇ¥ that make it hard to stop tapping your foot with the music.

The verdict: War Dancer is a strong debut from Jesse ThomasΓÇªand itΓÇÖs worth adding to your music library!
