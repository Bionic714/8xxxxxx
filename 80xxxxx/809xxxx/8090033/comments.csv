,pitpirate,2013-02-05T13:20Z,Hello Everyone.In my opinion recaps its not so bad.I am a big fan of G.A. and i cant wait for new episodes.They did a lot of stuff and work and They decide to show again in a nutshell this creepy haunted places (maybe someone else doing this recaps dont know for sure) .But yes i agreed this is annoying because i have all episoeds in here and if i want i go back and watch again.Greetings :) Pirate Bay You Are The Best :)
