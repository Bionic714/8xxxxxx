,peckar,2013-02-01T09:57Z,please can the seeds stay connected. This is a sharing site.  Share.
,peckar,2013-02-01T10:46Z,stuck on 46 percent you selfish fucks.  If i can find all 68 of you useless selfish pricks I would ban all of you.  Why should people share things with people who don't?
,ProtoFate,2013-02-01T12:49Z,"It took me about 5 minutes to get to 56%, and I've been stuck there for over an hour! I'm getting really fed up with seeding EVERYTHING I download, only to have no one do the same!"
,KiLLeR_SiX,2013-02-01T12:50Z,"Been stuck on 56.3% for what it seems like forever. I'm seeding this with my seedbox, and I already uploaded 15GB, so, please be nice, and seed!"
,Scandalen,2013-02-01T13:19Z,Seed you fucking donkey fuckers!!!
,Scandalen,2013-02-01T13:22Z,szdtew5ty
,KiLLeR_SiX,2013-02-01T13:23Z,"Well, judging by the fact that all of us are stuck at a certain percent after downloading with 8mbps until about 50%, I guess the conclusion is to give up on public trackers, folks.

Even though I prefer SCSA420's releases over Ebi's or DigitalDelBoy's, it always takes too much to get it from here.

I'll delete the torrent now, and wait until it gets uploaded to a private tracker, that way it's much easier to download.

Thank you!"
,okbymyself,2013-02-01T14:21Z,"No one will talk shit on StoneCold420 or his uploads. He promotes wrestling and is a true fan and is the ONLY person who uploads TNA impact every single fucking week!! 

You will appreciate him and say thank you.

The reason it is taking so long this week is because the number of seeders is WAY UP from usual. This is due to the fact that TNA is getting very good and starting to attract a larger audience. It means they are doing a good job!

Thanks SCSA420"
,okbymyself,2013-02-01T14:22Z,*leechers
,KiLLeR_SiX,2013-02-01T15:33Z,"I'm not talking shit on him, I've been following his releases ever since he was VinceMcMahon316, and I'm a big fan.

(Now SCSA420) Releases every iMPACT in 720p with 60fps, but it always takes hours to leech.

As I said earlier, for iMPACT, I always download the AVCHD-SC-SDH version from private trackers, and that is because there are no leechers and hit and runners, or if there are, they certainly get banned within a couple of days."
,rustedhalo,2013-02-01T22:36Z,"Any chance for a lower res avi that will actually play smoothly on VLC? This is great for those who burn to DVD, but I find that a waste. Yes, I watch on my computer, if I owned a TV I'd watch the show when it aired."
,ProtoFate,2013-02-01T23:53Z,"No one was talking shit about him. I love his releases. I (we) was talking shit about the bastards who download but don't seed! I FINALLY finished downloading this at 11:00am ish, and I've been seeding all day since. 8 people downloaded 90+% from me since then. If everyone would at LEAST seed for at least 1hr after they download, we wouldn't have this problem."
[T],SCSA420,2013-02-02T00:28Z,The reason it took me longer to upload this show is because 1 of my 2 broadband connections is currently down and my ISP is still working on fixing it. I only had 1 connection to upload with so I have to make do with what I got here. I apologize for the uploading speed problem but its kind of beyond my control here since its the ISP's responsibility to fix it. Thanks again for your support wrestling fans.
,HvyMetal,2013-02-02T02:29Z,"Thank you very much for your torrents, Are the best!!"
,fuckyou579,2013-02-02T14:34Z,"Let me talk some shit about stone asshole. One third of his torrents are fucked up, he does not seed a third and in the final third he begs for donations. Now, you rump rangers are entitled to hold a faggot convention with him but, please, do not do it in public."
