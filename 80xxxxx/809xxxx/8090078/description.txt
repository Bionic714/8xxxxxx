"Pilot"

Renowned neurosurgeon Dr. Jason Cole 
(Steven Pasquale) has it all - including a 
dark secret. Every night at 8:25pm, 
Jason's body is overtaken by a dangerous 
alternate personality who goes by the name 
"Ian Price" (also Steven Pasquale). For 
years, Jason has been able to restrain Ian 
with the help of an intense pharmaceutical 
cocktail - that is, until today. Now Ian 
is free and hell-bent on seeking revenge, 
which could jeopardize Jason's life, 
career, and budding romance with Dr. Lena 
Solis (Alana De La Garza).

Kept the Next On since it bleeds into/runs
over the credits.

Evolve... or die.

Enjoy :)
