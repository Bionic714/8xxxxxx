I get it. ItΓÇÖs summer. ItΓÇÖs hot. You have too much time on your hands, or you want to feel like you do. Your calves have taken sweet flight from their pants prisons. YouΓÇÖve considered accepting popsicles instead of money as payment for goods and services rendered (cream-filled, of course ΓÇö youΓÇÖre not a fool).

You probably want a summer soundtrack or something donΓÇÖt you? Something to pipe through the olΓÇÖ earholes and pretend you know the words to whilst in the car? OK. Fine. You jackals.

Be smart: Go spend your next popsicle-check on Walk the MoonΓÇÖs self-titled album.

In a fit of coincidence (or predestination, for all you Calvinists), I heard lead single ΓÇ£Anna SunΓÇ¥ on the radio the night before this album dropped and ShazamΓÇÖd it. Then I watched the music video. Then I added it to my ΓÇ£JamsΓÇ¥ playlist. Then I wept openly, for in the deepest chasm of my eΓÇÖer pining heart, I knew that civilization had achieved its zenith: an album I could listen to while I jog and not have to skip any tracks.

So. I guess itΓÇÖs a pretty good, then.
