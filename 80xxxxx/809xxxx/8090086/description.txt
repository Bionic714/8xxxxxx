Withered Hand is not, alas, a Jeremy Beadle tribute band. It is, however, the nom de plume of Edinburgh alt.folk messiah Dan Willson ΓÇô and for said dude we should give thanks.

Willson is a curious pop disciple: a deadpan bard eternally vexed by the doctrines of God, the inconsequence of life, and the transparent nature of modern swimwear. Good News, his gorgeous debut album, delivers a compendium of warped-rock sermons that variously reference Seventh-day Adventism (ΓÇÿCornflakeΓÇÖ); lyrical post-rationalisation (ΓÇÿFor the MaudlinΓÇÖ); and knocking one out on your paramourΓÇÖs couch (ΓÇÿReligious SongsΓÇÖ, his signature anthem).

Despite his dedication to a DIY cause thatΓÇÖs seen Withered Hand galvanise EdinburghΓÇÖs live terrain and perform with Jeffrey Lewis and Calvin Johnson, WillsonΓÇÖs quavering vocals and acoustic eulogies elicit heavy-hitters Bright Eyes (on woebegone porch-swing opener ΓÇÿProvidenceΓÇÖ) ΓÇô and even Neil Young at times.

Fans will recognise much of Good News: previous Withered Hand singles feature, but theyΓÇÖre (needlessly) tweaked by producer Kramer (Low, Daniel Johnston). Hence deficit aria ΓÇÿNo CigarettesΓÇÖ surrenders some of its vulnerability, while a refinement of ΓÇÿReligious SongsΓÇÖ misplaces the hymnΓÇÖs initial scrabbly desperation.

This is a minor quibble. WillsonΓÇÖs sing-a-long afflictions and satirical narratives are marvellous. ΓÇÿLord... wonΓÇÖt you listen to me, your unfaithful servantΓÇÖs filthy fucking languageΓÇÖ, he importunes on ΓÇÿLove in the Time of EcstasyΓÇÖ, a sonorous ΓÇÿso-whatΓÇÖ to the hereafter.

ΓÇÿIn the greater scheme of things, I am nothingΓÇÖ, he later claims ΓÇô which just goes to show that, despite being splendid, Withered Hand is not always right.
