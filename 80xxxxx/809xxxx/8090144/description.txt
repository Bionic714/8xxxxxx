There's no arguing the superb (and diverse) mix of talent in this band, but the execution is something less than inspiring, particularly on the second album, Spirit of a Woman. Both albums are easy to listen to and display excellent writing, playing, and singing. Just the same, there's a shortage of real fire behind it, and I find my attention wandering well before it's over. If I would point out a particular flaw, I'd say the somewhat overblown arrangements may have been the wrong ingredient for an otherwise perfect recipe. Some songs, in my opinion, could have been stripped of their glossy orchestration to reveal much more personal and satisfying portraits. Too much layering suggests a lack of confidence in their material. To the contrary, they're great songs swimming in superfluous production.
