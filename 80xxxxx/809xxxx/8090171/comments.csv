I hope you don't mind my asking, but just a technical question if that is okay.  I notice that most of your 1080 posts generally take up about 6.5 Gigs on a DL DVD; because I burn them and then watch them on my OPPO player (generally I keep them). 

I was REALLY curious, the way you encode them, do you feel that it is just a waste to utilize the remaining 1.5-2 gigs or so of a DL disc making the movie file say closer to 8 Gigs?  Is it that with your encoder settings and I'm assuming multi-passes, is that just the size it comes out?  Would it really matter picture quality wise to use the entire disc or do most of you here simply just watch the files directly and disc size just isn't a consideration?

Some posters here do a lot of 7.95 Gig uploads; I was just wondering why the difference?  Obviously, their settings are deliberately set to fill a DL disc, yours clearly are not.  Do you personally feel that at 6.5 gigs the Blu-ray film looks the best it's gonna look say when watched on a 50"" plasma?  Do you feel yourself that there would be any real difference between the 2 methods?

Again absolutely NO criticism meant at all, I am just curious about what your opinion is technically.

Thanks man!  Sure do appreciate it!!!

Cheers!"
