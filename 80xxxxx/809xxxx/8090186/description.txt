Aside from being an indie author and poet, I also produce various forms of electronic music under different project names. These can be anything from soft and ambient to hard-hitting dance beats and dubstep. 

Featured here is some of the work I've done (mainly dubstep) under the moniker "Kronos One". 

Enjoy! =)
