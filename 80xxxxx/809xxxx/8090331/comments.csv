Don't know why LOL went to sleep for about 22 hours and let me be the only small (less than 720p) offering here. According to TSI, 10,000 downloads in the time before LOL's.
.
But curiously, it's now almost 20,000 which means word must have spread.
And now, almost at the week mark - there are near a thousand seeds supporting it.
This was made from the MKV (as LOL's MP4 was nowhere to be found).
So, downloading AND encoding from MKV takes longer than MP4,
But the better source must say something here,
So we'll see if I've developed a following or am a flash in the pan.

The other two?
There was the night Louie went missing
And actaully three weeks running I beat most with HomeLand.
.
heady stuff, being first.
But in the long run - I think consistency will attract the more permanent viewer.
Current regular big numbers are for ""Once Upon A Time"", ""Bones"" and ""Arrow"".
.
Of course, there are my ""projects"" (MINIseason - Dexter, Burn Notice & Cats).
And then XIII was an eye opening experience.
House of Cards had it hairy moments, but seems quite popular.
