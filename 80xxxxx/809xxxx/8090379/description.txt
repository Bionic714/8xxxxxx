Tools used:
gimagex for image capture
dism for image mount on Info Folder and Activation setupcomplete
oscdimg for ISO mastering
Added Info folder to installs to make more work for credit thieves.

This release differs greatly in my integration method because
it uses sysprep and audit mode instead of just mounting the install.wim
and using dism to integrate kb msu files.

This is the main method that OEM manufacturers use to install
Drivers and other programs before sysprepping and letting you log on
and set up your user info. The Sysprep /generalize option removes all
user info and runs a disk cleanup before shutting down the system.
You then capture the image by booting into a different install on a
different partition.

I downloaded all Security and KB file updates from Microsoft Update for
Windows 8 and Office 2013. There were roughly 1000megs of updates for x64
and roughly 700megs for x86 version. The footprint is larger because of
backup files and compression differences between wim files and update files.

I did not download any device drivers or other optional software.
The only program that I added to Windows, besides the activator, is Office.
