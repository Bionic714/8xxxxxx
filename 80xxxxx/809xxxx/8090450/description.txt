Minecraft Server Archive (January 2013)
This is everything up to Minecraft 1.4.7 & Snapshot 13w05a


This is not totally complete, as there are a few missing versions, but this is the collection that I was able to get from Minecraft Version Changer, and official downloads.

I have seen many torrents that have archives of the clients, but not the servers.

Feel free to use these in any way you see fit.

I find them useful for maps made with a certain version of minecraft when expanding them with Minecraft Land Generator, and obviously  when playing older versions.


Note:  Servers like 1.2.1 and 1.2.5 will make the same map when using the same seed.  The last number just denotes bugfixes.  However, major revisions (the middle number) change how the map is created.  So, use the same (or closest) server to make sure you map doesnt get mismatched chunks when exploring or generating new chunks.
