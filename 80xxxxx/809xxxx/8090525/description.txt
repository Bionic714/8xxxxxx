About This App:

Updated:
December 28, 2012

Current Version:
4.6.2

Requires Android:
1.6 and up

Category:
Tools

Description:

 The one and only rotation control app that can REALLY LOCK your screen in ANY orientation and also FORCE the automatic orientation to override app specific settings. 

The "Forced Auto" mode for example is very handy on tablets where some apps force portrait mode while you are holding the screen "upside down". It also allows using the launchers of for example the HTC (One X/One S) Sense 4, Samsung Galaxy S3 Touchwiz and Google Nexus 7 in landscape mode.

This 7-day trial version allows you to fully evaluate the app before having to buy it.
