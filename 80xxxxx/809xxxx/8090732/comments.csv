,tonarpos,2013-02-01T15:08Z,"Hey shipmates, please help me answer these two Questions. 1, Can this uploader really be trusted ? even though he has a pink skull i am very cautious after checking the fairly small amount of torrents he/she/they have uploaded and reading some of the commemts(not all positive). 2, Is this software any good ? i have read mixed reviews, some say good, some say bad, downloading drivers that you don't need for example. Soulking77 this is not a personal attack on you but i was caught out when i downloaded some of T.F.Ks crapware and he also ""HAD"" a pink skull, they seem to be handing them out like sweets to kids !!"
,psycho34,2013-02-01T19:15Z,"@tonarpos my advice is always have a back up HDD (clone it) and have no fear =)
btw thanks uploader soulking77 yarrgh!!!"
,tonarpos,2013-02-01T20:53Z,"psycho34, with a name like that i'd be surprised if you feared anything or anyone !! thanks for your reply."
,decoy027,2013-02-02T02:37Z,"This version is broken and potentially dangerous to use, well for me at least, it wont even start without showing many errors in the scripts and once it does load up, not all of it is running or there to be used.

was this even tested? or is this the testing grounds?"

-------------------------------
What? are you kidding me?..folks don't listen to these fear mongers I'm beginning to suspect that tonarpos & decoy027 are
spies & saboteurs..worked fine for me updated 4 drivers with no problems to report
windows 7 64bit amd 4core 4gb ram HP computer"
,decoy027,2013-02-02T23:53Z,"The previous error has caused another one:D 

I used an earlier version which I KNOW works and the same errors are coming up, I cleaned the registry the other day, that's probably what's causing the fault...

Psycho34... I'm just saying what I come across you douche."
,tonarpos,2013-02-03T02:12Z,"psycho34, questioning an upload/uploader does not make you a spy or saboteur. I suppose you download anything and everything just because it's free. I ""REALLY"" hope you don't catch any nasty viruses but with an IQ of just 34 i think it's inevitable."

,enigmaelectronica,2013-02-04T08:31Z,"So then why this version is the 12.12???
