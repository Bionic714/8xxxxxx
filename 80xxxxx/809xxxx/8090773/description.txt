Review
~~~~~~

by Stef

"Songs Of Early Autumn" is possibly the best adapted for this season of the
year, and it was recorded at an improvised meeting in the not yet heated (and
therefore chilly) home of Joe Morris, who plays bass on this album. Gonz치lez
and him are joined by this other bass-player turned tenor saxophonist Timo
Shanko, and with Luther Gray on drums. Morris and Gonz치lez had played before on
"No Photograph Available" and apparently the collaboration was worth a
follow-up. Three of the eight tracks are compositions by Gonz치lez, all the
other pieces are group improvisations in the real free (bop) tradition. The
album starts highly rhythmic, uptempo with steady bass vamps and drum lines,
and both horn players get all the space they need to enjoy us with their skills
(and I laughed out loud because it is such fun at moments). But the album is
balanced, with slower, more moody pieces, allowing the horn players to show
another perspective, and I must say that Shanko outdoes himself, reaching the
improvisational emotional power of Gonz치lez, howling, screeching, wailing,
going deep, deep, deep, and making this again a great album.
