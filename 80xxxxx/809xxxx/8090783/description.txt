The seventh season has been expanded to a one hour format. In the first half, Scott takes couples to look at 3 houses up for sale that have income property potential. 3D computer generated renditions show the reno possibilities of each house. Once a house has been chosen, the second half follows the formula of the past seasons, with the renovation of the income suite and the reveal.
