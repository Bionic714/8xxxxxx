The Da Vinci Code: The True Story
The True Story looks at the real lives and true stories behind Hollywood blockbusters and this episode looks at Ron Howard's controversial box office hit The Da Vinci Code.
The film adaptation of the best-selling novel by Dan Brown sees Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) caught up in a two thousand year old battle between a mysterious secret society and the Orthodox Church to suppress the greatest secret in history: The true nature and final resting place of the Holy Grail. The Da Vinci Code follows Langdon's attempt to solve a series of puzzles and codes left behind by great renaissance artist Leonardo Da Vinci. Hidden in one of his greatest masterpieces are clues to the true nature of the Holy Grail - clues Langdon must decipher to lead him to the shocking truth. The film enthralled and enraged audiences in equal measure due its assertion that Jesus had a sexual relationship with Mary Magdalene, leading Catholics to call for a boycott on the film altogether. The film's creator however, stood by his research and claims that 99% of the film was true. So what is the truth? Brand new historical evidence and investigations show how the film's plot was based on real organizations and events.

We investigate the resting place of the Holy Grail, the ancient carved Rosslyn Chapel in Scotland where analysis reveals that it does contain cryptic messages and hidden chambers.
