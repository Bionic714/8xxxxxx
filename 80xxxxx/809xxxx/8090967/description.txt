Album Info:

CAPITAL PUNISHMENT was nominated for a 1999 Grammy for Best Rap Album. Prepare to be punished. Loud Records presents the newest MC mastermind, Big Pun. The latest spin-off from the Bronx-born Terror Squad (first introduced by Fat Joe), Pun's quick-tongued delivery and witty lyrics have earned him a highly anticipated debut album, CAPITAL PUNISHMENT. Punisher blew up the spot with the street anthem "I'm Not A Player," the remix of which featured R&B singer JOE and helped gain commercial success for the Puerto Rican rapper. Both versions are featured on CAPITAL PUNISHMENT, in addition to other evidence of the artist's diversity. In addition to Big Pun's skills, the album contains some of the hottest upcoming talent in hip-hop, with MCs like Noreaga and the Wu-Tang's Rebel INS appearing as guests. Engineers include: Ken "Duro" Ifil, Adam Kudzin, Soundboy. Producers include: Ju-Ju, Rockwilder, Showbiz, Big Punisher, RZA. Personnel: Big Punisher, Fat Joe, Wyclef, Busta Rhymes, Black Thought, Noreaga, Miss Jones, JOE, Triple Seis, Armageddon, Cuban Link, Prospect, Dead Prez, Prodigy, Inspektah Deck (rap vocals); Funkmaster Flex (spoken vocals); Roc Raida (scratches). Producers include: Ju-Ju, Rockwilder, Knobody, Mike Zulu, Domingo.
