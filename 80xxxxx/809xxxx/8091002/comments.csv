,dandalis,2013-02-01T14:05Z,45 GB holy fuck man !
,LubosD,2013-02-01T14:43Z,"Umm, is there some sort of 1080p rip? This is way too big..."
,joggo85,2013-02-01T14:51Z,"Yeah, it's the whole Bluray disc ;)

and that one is 45gb"
,Startle,2013-02-01T22:20Z,Thank you very much!
,TheLathe,2013-02-01T22:51Z,"LOVELY!

Thank you Mr. BOZX!!!"
,dickiepooh,2013-02-02T05:59Z,"First, Thank you BOZX for this and all of you great uploads!!  This is the first time that I have DL'd a full BD file.  Subsequently, I have been reading and I am not sure I will be able to play it.  I have VLC 2.0.4 (I don't like all the crap they are including with their recent releases) and Splash Pro 1.13.1.0, but it doesn't look like they will work.  Any suggestions anyone...or am I SOL!!!  Sometimes, you just have to live and learn.

Thanks again for all of your great work!!!"
,black_skull530i,2013-02-02T10:29Z,"I am downloading an entire BluRay for the first time. I appreciate all of you guys' work.
Thanks a lot, friend! :)"
,black_skull530i,2013-02-02T10:38Z,"@dickiepooh  The best player for that is PowerDVD. So my method is, Download and install ImgBurn, Daemon Tools. First, open ImgBurn and select ""Create Iso from folder"". Now just create an iso. Then open the iso file using daemon tools. Now, PowerDVD will detect a BluRay disc and will play it with everything.
Hope it helps. Good Luck."
,dickiepooh,2013-02-02T11:15Z,@black_skull530i - Thank you for your quick response.  I just found your solution...but was still looking.  I will try it when the DL completes.  Thanks again for you help!!
,dickiepooh,2013-02-02T11:17Z,@black_skull530i - Thank you for your quick response.  I just found your solution elsewhere...but was still looking.  I will try it when the DL completes.  Thanks again for you help!!
,dududus,2013-02-02T12:33Z,"thanks.. but why not just release as ISO file?

really takes ages to convert!"
,dickiepooh,2013-02-02T16:50Z,"@BOZX...perfect quality!!!

@black_skull530i - Thanks for all your help.  On my system PowerDVD 11 didn't play the ISO unless I accessed the specific file from the ""video"" tab. I am able to access the proper files directly from the DL without a virtual drive via the ""video"" tab and they play perfectly...including all of the extras.

@dududus - it took less than 20 min. to convert to an ISO via ImgBurn.  DL'ing an ISO file would require something like .rar files, and I personally would not DL a .rar movie...most of them are fakes.

Thanks again BOZX."
,dududus,2013-02-02T18:33Z,"dickie, with md5 checksums theres no need for rar files, i have downloaded 30gb torrent mkvs with no probs.. but you are right, what difference does 20mins make for such an awesome release! 

i used virtual clone drive (freeware from slysoft) to mount.. powerdvd plays it perfectly.. and i can access the individual files from the mounted disc if i want to use vlc

thanks for up boxz, you rock!"
,ericdaoust41,2013-02-03T19:02Z,I have downloaded the full disc image and wrote it on a BD disc like I do with my own backups. But the disc doesn't start and my BD reader turns off... Help?
,ericdaoust41,2013-02-03T19:02Z,It was written on a BD-DL 50gb disc. 
,ericdaoust41,2013-02-03T19:04Z,"I wrote everything on a BD-DL disc, like I do with my own films, but it makes my BD player turns off?"
,ericdaoust41,2013-02-03T19:10Z,"I have downloaded the content, wrote it on a BD-DL disc, but it makes my BD player turns off... Any idea?"
,Ponyoo,2013-02-06T07:07Z,Absolutely gorgeous. Cheers @BOZX = God Bless
,dickiepooh,2013-02-07T02:15Z,@si3...why to you post fake sites???  Go crawl back under the rock you came from.  Effing idiot!!!
,iandyxx,2013-02-09T11:04Z,"when i play it in powerdvd 12, it says, you are playing copyrighted material,
what do i do ? "
,thebiglimbeezy,2013-02-09T21:18Z,"down speed at consistent 3.5MB/s  ... appreciate the seeds, thank you!"
,btk031,2013-02-10T19:16Z,I play this with powerDVD and it doeasnt play it in 16:9. Is this problem with me or it isnt 16:9????
,brbear,2013-02-10T20:58Z,"@btk031

The film is a 2.37:1 aspect ratio, so no, it's not a 16x9 movie"
,3PeatWillCome,2013-02-13T23:56Z,"I just want to download the Spanish Audio, is there any way to do that to make the file smaller so I don't have to download all of the other Audios?"
,crewez,2013-02-15T01:27Z,I have DL many full BD but I could not get this one to play past seven seconds of the opening 20th Century intro. Sounds like some got this to play I don't know what the problem is but I think maybe the download was corrupted somehow. thx anyway to the UL.
,FleetGT,2013-02-18T22:13Z,"Wow! Thx alot!! Perfect quality! 
I use MPC-HC in combination with Shark007 codecs and the bluray runs smooth! And ofcourse you need a graphics card that can run big files like this one. I have Intel(R) HD Graphics 3000."
,white-hot,2013-02-21T03:06Z,"Sweet! Thanks to BOZX and others uploading the full BD of movies! Only way to go if you want to watch it on a big TV and not an iPad.

To all you winers who say too big, why are you even looking at this torrent? Go get the 100MB rip for your iPad and STFU. Not all of us want to look at VHS or worse quality video."
,amorosa,2013-02-28T08:15Z,"@dickiepooh@black_skull530i......please help i download imgburn already,then please let me know if the whole movie folder i will choose or the BDMV folder only then the stream......please help,have a good day....."

,amorosa,2013-03-03T06:13Z,"@lionboy_91.....can u help me please,dont know how to play this one....can u teach me...thank u"
,Lionboy_91,2013-03-03T19:44Z,"Usually I open VLC > Media - Open Disc- BluRay (No disc menus) - Browse folder/iso location and then play

But it doesn't work very good with this one, my video and audio is lagging through the whole movie"
,amorosa,2013-03-04T06:26Z,"@lionboy_91........thanks for ur reply...i have some bluray too,i download splash player pro to play my bluray file...for me its good....but lionboy,u know how to play bluray files because my files is lots of m2ts files...good day to you"
,amorosa,2013-03-04T06:29Z,"@lionboy......i mean i want to watch,continuously..thanks"
,Lionboy_91,2013-03-04T19:01Z,"I don't know sorry :( It doesn't seem to work with VLC with this blu ray movie, all others I've tried I have done it the way I told you the other day."
,t.i.j.,2013-03-05T17:39Z,"Thnx to the uploader! Movie was OK as i expected it to be! Storyline is intelligent and entertaining and acters were OK! I usually watch all the movies at film.greyfade.net because they have HD's but they didn't have this one so im happy to have piratebay :) Good torrent quality - A9 V9,"
,DrChiron,2013-05-06T10:24Z,This is an MGM / Columbia release. No one should be seeing a 20th Century Fox logo!
