,sunny_bhai,2013-02-01T15:31Z,"thanks is not a word for you....
actuallly no words......."
,hashtagnwo,2013-02-01T18:12Z,izitox your adding subtitles but imdb says films in english why would we need them ? is it for deaf people ?
,Darker666,2013-02-01T21:07Z,"@hashtagnwo:
There are people who can speak English but they sometimes need hint when they didn't hear well.
People like me."
[V],meech,2013-02-02T04:36Z,"I like subtitles so I can keep the audio down at night while my son sleeps and make sure I don't miss anything since the subtitles are there.  Plus my bro-in-law is from Spain.  He speaks english quite well, but he likes the subtitles so he doesn't miss anything if they talk fast, or with a strong accent.

Nevertheless, it seems the link to subs is unnecessary if the torrent description is correct.

Audio.......:	English DTS 1510 kbps
Subtitles...:	English"
,zakonii,2013-02-02T10:40Z,Thank you very much BOZX :)
,BRloloys,2013-02-02T13:40Z,finally finish download..almost 20gb seeds...thanks a lot...
,HKCannibal,2013-02-02T15:38Z,"@hashtagnwo

Not all people who download films have English as a native language, the subtitle is used as a support for a better understanding of what is being said."
,boknah,2013-02-02T19:24Z,thanks bozx you rock
,S.C.I.,2013-02-02T20:01Z,Someone seed please.

,adulgunawansyah,2013-02-03T05:51Z,You are F*cking Damn Good Uploader
,.Leto.,2013-02-03T12:11Z,I watched it yesterday but I don't get why everyone is so excited about this movie. A lot of parts were quite boring. It's still a good movie obviously but Casino Royale was much much better than this.
,Tastyballs,2013-02-03T12:47Z,"Touted as one of the finest bond film, but turns out so underwhelming that i couldn't care less when M died. No intrigue, no suspense, no gadgets. And the bond girl? Gimme a break.."
,Bshroom,2013-02-03T15:23Z,"Spoiler: M is actually Bonds real mother. Then she dies after throwing the Queen down an airshaft.

,Ajkan,2013-02-03T20:57Z,"@Bshroom , Oh boy ... I nearly piss my self ..

BOZX thanks again , Ferris ""BOZX"" Bueller ... You're my Hero ..."
,spiritofwrath,2013-02-04T03:39Z,Why can't i use the slider bar to fast forward teh movie using vlc?

if you want a much better picture quality. "
,dejvster,2013-02-06T13:53Z,"Hello BOZX, just want to say thank you for an excellent job on all your films. I just have on question, this is absoluterly no complaint but i feel like the PublicHD films are a bit more grainy/blurry than other HDrips out there. Is this due to high bitrate/lower res or just a effect that you like to have on your rips?"
,levy67,2013-02-07T21:03Z,no A/V ?????
,lizardomanson,2013-02-10T15:11Z,"Not everyone can understand english by just hearing, plus sometimes if it's english from england, well..it sounds just like gibberish (i dont know this movie because haven't seen it yet)."
,cwernert,2013-02-13T09:56Z,What a boss :) thanks so much man
,.Leto.,2013-02-17T06:35Z,"you shouldn't download this, this rip is much better:

,slmndow,2013-02-18T22:02Z,thanks!
,marxone12,2013-02-27T05:47Z,"why did you put the English subtitles? who wished could've subsequently put the English sub.
and how can I now put the subtitles and you normally watch a movie???
unbelievable"
,yogdagon,2013-03-29T19:05Z,"V-10, A-10, M-7, thanx.
I seed for 2 months."
,AquariaTX,2013-03-31T08:58Z,"@hashtagnwo:

The subtitles are there for people like me, who have auditory processing disorder. It makes me unable to process what people say, no matter how many times someone repeats it to me.

I also have some deafness from working around heavy machinery for a long time.

Don't assume that everyone has 100% hearing like you do, cupcake."
,rock53,2013-04-24T19:42Z,"Nice movie!
