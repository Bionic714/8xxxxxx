,Dunge,2013-02-01T14:40Z,1280x536? How is that 720p?
,phase700b,2013-02-01T15:26Z,"1280x720 fills a 16:9 screen. Not all movies fill a 16:9 screen. This one is 2.35:1. On a 16:9 screen there will be black bars top and bottom. These black bars are not included in the encoding process to save space. Any file that is 1280 horizontal is 720 resolution. Same for 1080. If it's 1920 across it's 1080 resolution. This is a newbie question that doesn't get answered very often. It's Friday, I'm in a good mood ;)"
