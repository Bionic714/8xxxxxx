I fixed an incorrect index name.
If you downloaded the first version just use the second index for the pre-activated one, or re-download.

I tested the hell out of the release, but it was a last minute name change that I screwed up. I apologize."
,maxsuser,2013-02-02T00:12Z,"Hi Murphy78, thanks a lot for all your hard work, a lot of us appreciate and treasure your releases.

However, just confirming with this one, once installed, it will activate by itself, correct? And also it will keep checking if activation is needed by itself automatically, do we need to set anything in the task scheduler ourself or will it be automatically configured?
TIA"
[V],murphy78,2013-02-02T01:34Z,Only if you use the KMS-Activated index. I left the other one in there for people who like to use a different method to activate their kms.
,maxsuser,2013-02-02T02:45Z,"KMS-Activated index, what's that? I'm still downloading but just want to clarify before hand, thanks."
[V],murphy78,2013-02-02T07:12Z,"It's the index that is KMS-Activated.
The other one is not activated."
