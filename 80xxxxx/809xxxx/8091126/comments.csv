,Vizard7,2013-02-01T13:48Z,Thanks men! I was waiting for 1080p =D
,roherin,2013-02-01T13:49Z,"Hello YIFY. I love the quality of your releases. I only wish that you would specify the audiocodec in the torrent spec. I have troubles playing AAC coded audio and prefer AC3 or DTS releases. 
Anyhow.. Love your work. Cheers..!!"
,sigurredrose,2013-02-01T14:09Z,thank you for the upload YIFY. can you upload the damned united? pleaseeee i really need the movie
,firexninja,2013-02-01T19:02Z,thank you!
,krazykhan,2013-02-02T04:29Z,OH YEAH! YIFY YOU ARE THE MAN
,nginx,2013-02-02T05:17Z,"YIFY my man please up the bitrate a little. This is 1080p we are talking about. As soon as any fast moving scenes start, there's pixelation all over the place. I think a minimum of 2000kbps is fairly standard for small size 1080p these days but this encode is way below that."
,hotslized,2013-02-02T10:23Z,"thanks yify! and again...just whisper what you like, i'l give it to you openly.lol."
,black_skull530i,2013-02-02T10:47Z,I appreciate your work YIFY. Thanks Man!
,mook300,2013-02-02T17:19Z,I'm pretty sure there are problems with this... it was removed from yifys site..... that is why there are pixel problems.. I could be wrong but I dont think so
,handren61,2013-02-02T20:06Z,"This has been removed from Yify website, the quality is not perfect. quite blured and some pixles are missing. Waiting for the better quality Yify. Love your releases. Thanks"
,NDNPwn,2013-02-02T23:30Z,Am I the only one getting just a Green screen and just audio? I tried it on both of my computers and is still the same. I use VLC player of that makes a differnce. 
,mook300,2013-02-03T00:01Z,@NDNPwn  No you are not 
,Grobant,2013-02-03T02:22Z,Also getting a green screen with audio.
,diamentowytron,2013-02-03T02:41Z,"its weird, i cant run the video. no vision, no audio. "
,sharkcutter,2013-02-03T16:26Z,Sadly this is bad. Just too compressed. Nice try to get a 1080p at 1.65 gb but the result is so pixelated it hardly plays on VLC and not at all on my WD player. This one is NG. V:1 A:1 Thanks anyway   
,geru,2013-02-03T20:31Z,"Perfect rip, A/V 10/10. Very good movie also, suspenseful right from the get go."
,Attagen,2013-02-04T08:18Z,"I can't open this file on my TV (Samsung UE55ES7000) but normally its play mp4 with no problems, it must be something wrong with this file"
,dpwhitey7,2013-02-04T09:30Z,File is corrupt. Won't play in VLC or import to iTunes.  The 720p version is perfect though.  Thanks for all the rips YIFY I love you!
,mojoblk,2013-02-04T16:49Z,"Problem with this file!!!                        

Its Blue Ray not BrRip???"
,roos2029,2013-02-04T17:40Z,Unfortunately I have had a lot of problems with this file to. It won't play on my WD media player & it even shuts down my Samsung LCD TV. I have had to turn my TV off at the power point to reset it. First bad one I have DL off you YIFY. All your other files have been brilliant. Are you going to redo this?
,tofumunch,2013-02-04T23:38Z,"was wondering what all the fuzz was about, thx!"
,rg1997,2013-02-05T06:38Z,"I couldn't get this to work either, but the 720p version worked great. It's probably a problem on my end."
,ram95,2013-02-05T07:41Z,It's not working on my player. First time that happen from all my download of YIFY's. Please re-encode again. TY
,sabrips,2013-02-06T16:19Z,I cant play this on my LG Tv or laptop. Weird. I've never had any problems with YIFY's torrents they're the best.
,ram95,2013-02-07T07:28Z,"It has no problem playing on my PC using VLC media player but I want to watch it on my big screen TV and HD player, so what I did was to re-encode it using Any Video Converter and it's now playing. Thanks for the rip YIFY. =)"
,haider_salaar,2013-02-07T10:35Z,"That's a shocker. There is some issue with the file definitely. It has been removed from YIFY website too. This has happened only this once and Team YIFY are excellent by far. I hope they solve this up.
I love YIFY'w work. So no complaints. It happens some time. Just wait for another copy which i hope YIFY will upload soon in 1080."
,happynick,2013-02-08T00:15Z,it does not work....just a green screen with sound
,soumyaz,2013-02-08T14:31Z,"A10 V10 - Great movie, top 10 in the last few years for sure! Storyline is intelligent and entertaining, i wouldn't change it even a bit. Actors rocked, really really good acting! Quality was great! At site aole.ciroblazevic.com there is Django and Hobbit in HD already, great stuff! Thnx once again for this fantastic movie!"
[T],cclloyd,2013-02-10T02:06Z,This copy acts weird for me.  My TV couldn't play it and I couldn't add it to iTunes..
,joeboxers,2013-02-11T02:16Z,THANK YOU!!!! finally some postings in MP4!! MKV's SUCK!!! Join the rebellion to stop MKV's!!!
,rajanuk,2013-02-11T14:53Z,can any one tell me what audio? 5.1 or 2 chnls?
,Jwrbloom,2013-02-11T19:27Z,"YIFY, the video is pixelated, which is very different from your other files.  Is anyone else having the same problem?  

Thanks."
,Jwrbloom,2013-02-11T19:29Z,"Responding to some of the other comments:  
I had the same issue of a blank screen with just audio before I converted it via Wondershare for Mac.  It's still very pixelated, as per my above comment.  "
,Hamodee,2013-02-14T17:29Z,"cool ,, A/9 V/9 ..

,Punisher2U,2013-02-15T06:16Z,"I never have any complaints on YIFY's work, but don't bother downloading this one. There is no Video, just audio. Try a different version of his work."
,ZombiesNBaconFlavorBrains,2013-02-17T19:04Z,Thank you YIFY! It works for me.
,sylvianre,2013-02-23T04:29Z, No hard coded subs for nonenglish parts. This release is useless.
,kalimo87,2013-02-26T01:08Z,"awesome upload as always, thanks! when can we expect 'silver linings playbook'?"
,markgri,2013-02-26T14:49Z,This copy does not work for everyone. It did not work on my tv.
,wildkard0000,2013-02-27T10:14Z,"okay, this is a Hi10p encode. Get something else if you plan to play this on something that doesn't support cutting edge software decoding."
,thepirateperez,2013-03-07T16:34Z,Whats happend yifi? This is not good!
,thepirateperez,2013-03-07T21:14Z,Perfect....!
,bibowns,2013-03-15T09:16Z,probably shouldn't be especially surprised tpb users can't 10bit properly.
