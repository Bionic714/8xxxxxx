,awsh,2013-02-03T00:59Z,"I love these songs, but can you please upload these at a higher quality? It's very static-y and is just at a low quality. Guess I should just buy the actual album."
,phanable,2013-02-03T03:53Z,"Many Thanks, i will be seeding as much as i can. "
,Tjhooker7,2013-02-03T19:47Z,"Very Good. Songs are great quality.
Some sound a bit Canned, But I think that's the way it's supposed to be. "
,snakeboy69,2013-02-04T15:27Z,"I honestly didn't expect to find this here.  Thank you sir, much appreciated!"
,WildPete,2013-06-03T08:52Z,"Everything checks out, quality is pretty sweet though i could be better, irrelevant though since I can enjoy the music anyway.

Thanks for uploading!"
