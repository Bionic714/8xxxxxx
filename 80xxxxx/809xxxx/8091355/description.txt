For my x64 version of Windows 8 (Not 100% sure if because of x64) the keymaker in the "Stardock Start8.v1.1 Windows 8 Incl Keyfilemaker and PatchEMBRAC" torrent by "TorDigger" doesn't seem to work and returns me an error "can't open file =(".

I searched around and managed to find the same patch used in the old version torrent that worked for me, "Stardock.Start8.v.1.11.BETA.2-sHaRe" by "SecTPB", but updated for v1.1 instead of v1.1b2.

So here it is, the installer and the "stardock.start8-patch.painter.exe" patcher.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
    1) Install v1.1 (using "start8-setup.exe" or otherwise)
    2) Close the activation window
    3) Open task manager and end this "Start8" on the "Services" tab
    4) End everything else related to Start8 AND "explorer.exe" on the "Details" tab
    5) Run "Patchstardock.start8-patch.painter" and patch everything.
    6) Either restart your computer OR restart the Start8 service and re-run "explorer.exe"

Enjoy!
