Jacques Couderc and Gilbert Servien play two madcaps (Napoleon and his faithful soldier) who escape from the madhouse. Their first encounter is with a lady who demands too much from her chauffeur. They drive away with the lady and are followed by the police who meet a young woman who complains of being raped by a satyr (Carmélo Pétix). He is seen busy with Françoise Maillot, dressed as Little-Red-Riding-Hood, but soon replaced by a lovely young brunette and later the now-chauffeur-less lady.
