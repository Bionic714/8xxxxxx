It took a while to get going at my max. upload speed of 280 kbs. Changed my port to same as the peer showing best download speed. Will surely take several days to complete."
,1EdgyGuy,2013-02-08T02:42Z,What Charles Bronson movie is it that he pokes the eyeballs out of an indian ? 
,cgculpepper,2013-02-11T01:12Z,"I don't expect everyone to seed to a 1:1 ratio , especially when upload capabilities are throttled to 10% of download speeds. But this is ridiculous as I've watched the seeders bail. From 25 to 1 in only 1.week. All 6 trackers list me as the only seed. 
I've just recently had my connection suspended for going excessively over my bandwidth limit (uploaded 1.5 terabytes) in the last 100 days. 
I know I'm not uploading junk."
,crazyrico,2013-02-13T05:48Z,The only Bronson that matters are the Death Wish series and that one in the Great Depression when he's the fighting hobo. That's why nobody wants to seed.
