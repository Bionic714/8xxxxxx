,masooo,2013-02-01T16:29Z,screenshots quality is not good enough :((
,NarwhalsareBANANAS,2013-02-01T21:39Z,Seed people!
,ustink,2013-02-02T15:18Z,"@masooo
Don't be a moron, it's not a frame capture...it's a screen capture.  The blurring is normal and no indication of quality."
,Qwik2,2013-02-02T17:18Z,are the subs hardcoded?
,hogzy,2013-02-03T00:27Z,Stuck at 60% PLEASE SEED!!!!
,Feelmaster,2013-02-03T12:57Z,Is it just me or is the sound kind off crackly?
,letisa,2013-02-04T17:43Z,"Video bitrate could definitely be bigger for the file size. Downloading anyway, thanks"
,bordo84,2013-02-05T14:39Z,noo it couldn´t be - look at the length
,letisa,2013-02-05T16:50Z,"Oops, it's true, it couldn't be bigger because of the length, my bad. I've finished downloading this and it looks great on my TV"
,schinnak,2013-02-07T06:23Z,"One of the best prints available out there for this movie. No buffering when streaming and  no Cinavia scrap. Picture quality is amazing and so is the sound quality. Its perfect!

A - 10
V - 10"
,bandwagon,2013-02-07T12:23Z,For a torrent with above 2000 seeders this is very slow! I have tried the same torrent from publichd and the result was the same. Does anyone has the same problem?

,kashaf,2013-02-12T18:28Z,"hey guys i wanna ask something, i have 27 in' LED 1080p HD but when i watch any movie of 1080p or we can say BOZX my picture quality is not that clear as there should be in any 1080p movie.... i mean i can see the pixels i hope anybody out there help me... thnx"
,letisa,2013-02-12T19:34Z,"@kashaf: Is the 27"" you're talking about a monitor or a TV? If it's a monitor, to see true HD you need to have it connected to your PC with an HDMI or DVI cable. If not, it's not gonna look good. Now if you're watching it directly on a TV it should be naturally HD"
,gbailey,2013-02-22T12:21Z,"This is the sort of file size you should be looking at if you want great quality 1080p HD movies with surround sound.  Tiny little 2-4GB versions really suffer in high action scenes which Skyfall has a lot of.

With this version, the picture quality looks almost identical to the Blu-ray, even on 1080p screens of 32"" and above connected by HDMI cable.  Saves me doing a time-consuming encode of my disc, so thanks to the uploader!"
,thepirateperez,2013-02-28T15:52Z,Thanks...! Excelent quality...!
,sync390,2013-02-28T20:43Z,Movie is in MKV format.  Don't bother downloading if you're gonna use your PS3.
,JSlatchLP,2013-03-01T21:44Z,My advice would just be not to have a PS3.
,Ajvar89,2013-03-11T18:42Z,"Thnx to the uploader! Movie was OK as i expected it to be! I usually watch all the movies at film.maswagg.com because they have HD's but they didn't have this one so im happy to have piratebay :) Good torrent quality - A9 V9,"
,KShelbrock2,2013-04-15T06:11Z,Too all of you people that insist on watching these on a PS3 (why you dont hook your computer to your tv or set a up PC just as a media center I dont know) but do you not know how to convert media files? Never heard of Freemake??
,JonAndRoid,2013-05-01T04:34Z,"Great movie, great upload, worth the 9.83gb's...ill seed for a while...the clarity is amazing, total blue-ray quality"
