This is the story of Lord Shiva and Goddess  
Shakti. It is an elaborated narration of     
Shiv and Shakti's separation and union,      
their journeys together, and how that        
affected and shaped the world. The story     
presently narrates how Goddess Shakti's      
human incarnation Sati, grand daughter of    
Lord Brahma and daughter of Prajapati Daksha 
(a staunch devotee of Lord Vishnu) and Queen 
Prasuti is reunited with Shiva after Shakti  
was separated from him for the benefit of the
universe. The show is presumed to follow with
Sati's reincarnation as Goddess Parvati,     
daughter of mountain-king Himalaya and Queen 
Maina and younger sibling of Prince Mainak   
and Goddess Ganga. The show will then portray
