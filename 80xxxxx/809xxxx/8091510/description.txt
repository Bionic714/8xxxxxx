  In Edna & Harvey: Harvey's  New  Eyes,  players  return  to  the  world  of
  adventure game hit Edna & Harvey: The Breakout. Be prepared  to  meet  many
  old friends and discover many new hand-made cartoon locations, realized  in
  full HD glory!

  Lilli, a young girl at a convent school, is the main character  of  Edna  &
  Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes. Seemingly the best-behaved little  girl  in  the
  world, she executes all her chores in a  diligent  manner,  no  matter  how
  unfair they may be. Her innocent, imperturbable way  of  carrying  out  the
  orders of others has something both tragic and eerie about  it.  Any  angry
  thoughts, any childlike disobedience is buried  deep  beneath  a  seemingly
  impenetrable surface of sweetness. But how long will  these  feelings  stay
  hidden? And where do the friendly little gnomes come from that  paint  over
  everything unpleasant in Lilli's vicinity with a pleasant pink  color?  Are
  they real or just a product of her subconscious.
