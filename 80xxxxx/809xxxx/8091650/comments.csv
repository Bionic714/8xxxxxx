,sevakarma,2013-02-01T19:27Z,"the download was fast, but, I can't see anything!!! the video is blank on latest vlc!!! what gives?"
[V],varuttee,2013-02-01T22:25Z,Whats ur VLC  version?
,sevakarma,2013-02-02T10:19Z,"VLC 1.1.13 ""Luggage"".

I also have movie player with all the codecs installed and even that reports unknown H264 codec.

Strange, eh?

I ended up downloading the bigger version of this movie.

Thnks anyway."
[V],Vitamin_X,2013-02-02T12:09Z,"Theres absolutely nothing strange at all, Just update your VLC to latest version 2.0.5, that should resolve the problem."
