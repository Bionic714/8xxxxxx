,jackflash,2013-02-01T23:55Z,Looks like a great upload - good balance of quality and size.  Thanks also for all the extras!
,Laudinei,2013-02-02T01:15Z,"its not  1280x720!!!

,flashos,2013-02-02T06:32Z,Thank you our king BOZX !!!
,.Leto.,2013-02-02T14:48Z,"I've only downloaded this for the 2 audio commentary tracks. For the movie itself I'm waiting for 3Li 's release, which should be the best one as usual. Quality here is already really good though. Thanks."
,pr0xZen,2013-02-02T23:46Z,"Movie is filmed in wide spectre - picture ratio 2.35:1 . This is very much standard with big scale movies, and has been for quite some time. If you wanted 1280x720 - black bars on top of bottom would have to be added (wich is pointless) - or part of the actual image would have to be cut away at the sides.

This is the movie industrys choice of standard - not ours. You get all there is to be had."
,pruizw,2013-02-05T21:31Z,"@Laudinei do a google search for ""Aspect Ratio"" so that you may understand why it's 528 instead of 720. You'd need black bars on top and bottom. Which would make the movie heavier.

Uploader: Thank you for commentaries! =)"
,.Leto.,2013-02-06T12:07Z,"So I just downloaded the 3Li release:
http://pirateproxy.net/torrent/8104428/Skyfall_2012_BluRay_720p_DTS_x264-3Li
and like I thought it's far superior to this one. I played both MKV simultaneously fullscreen to compare picture quality, there really is a huge difference. So much more definition with 3Li, all details are clearly visible. This PublicHD release almost seems blurry in comparison, it's like day and night. You can see that most encoders, like the one who did this, really do a poor job.
Unless you really want the commentary tracks there absolutely no reason to download this. If you don't believe me do what I did, download them both and compare them directly.
This movie deserves the best and it's 3Li's release :)"
,.Leto.,2013-02-06T15:07Z,"Actually there's a sample in 3Li's release (unlike this one...)
http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8104428/Skyfall_2012_BluRay_720p_DTS_x264-3Li
so you don't even need to download the full movie if you want to compare them.
It might sound like I'm advertising for 3Li but believe me considering the huge difference in quality between the 2 rips it would be extremely stupid to keep this one."
,Ajvar89,2013-03-11T18:59Z,"Thnx to the uploader! Movie was OK as i expected it to be! I usually watch all the movies at film.maswagg.com because they have HD's but they didn't have this one so im happy to have piratebay :) Good torrent quality - A9 V9,"
