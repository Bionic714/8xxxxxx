,Fritz.,2013-02-01T23:18Z,"Whats up with TPB now supporting pop up advertisements for malware?

Think its time to move on over to kat.com "
,wizzard4all,2013-02-02T00:23Z,"@Fritz - go plug your crap site somewhere else. KAT sucks compared to TPB, and your BS crap about TPB ""supporting"" pop-ups doesn't wash either. "
,Polymathj,2013-02-02T02:54Z,"They totally have malware pop-ups.  Even on the iPad, I get these stupid porn, dating, and currently ""the ex girlfriends.  

IPTorrents and other private ones are where you want to be but nothing beats TPB for the latest and greatest... with spam."
,wizzhop,2013-02-02T04:55Z,There's a difference between malware and spam kids.
,Zashiking,2013-02-02T06:35Z,TPB's worth the crap pop-ups. So its ok.
,mpenn20,2013-02-02T06:42Z,"Awesome upload juggs. V9A9. Watermark pops up like twice throughout the entire movie, so no biggy there.  
No cinavia on this either, but I'm pretty sure I've never seen a screener with cinavia anyways.
Cool movie too. Nice homage to arcade games, old and new. Thanks juggs"
,mpenn20,2013-02-02T06:44Z,"and to those complaining about the ads...if you have firefox, just use the adblock add-on and you never have to see any ads anywhere."
,shane3900,2013-02-02T06:47Z,"finally one that the last 5 minutes are not stuffed.
9/10 quality. thanx uploader and seeders."
,kevinb15,2013-02-02T07:59Z,People leave dumb comments all the time....just rate the movie or thank the supplier and move on
,beauuu.,2013-02-02T08:27Z,@Polymathj why don't you just get google chrome and ad blocker like the rest of us then you don't have to see any ad on any site so you will be able to enjoy yourself without getting worried about which site is better due to lack of ads.
,mikeike65,2013-02-02T12:00Z,"@mrholmes your name is most commonly associated with a porn star. One who conjures up images of cocks, lots of cocks. In fact he did quite a bit of gay porn. Also he died from aids, which he got from gay porn. 

And yet you mention the word fag several times. Just come out already and accept your own sexuality. Its painfully obvious to every one.  "
,Gimpman83,2013-02-02T12:53Z,"OR... Use the ABP ad on for Firefox and you will wonder what all these whiners are talking about when they say PB has ads and pop ups.  Same with youtube and other sites, I couldn't imagine browsing with out it."

,dubblue4,2013-02-02T14:04Z,thanks
,Syrianen,2013-02-02T14:18Z,I just registred so i could say this if you're tired of the pop ups that are popping up like porn and ex girlfriends russian bridemates you should install a pop up blocker or atleast Ad-block from google chrome's store its great it even removes the softporn on the sides of the piratebay.

it's simple use firefox and add ons. I got 2 pop up blockers and 3 ad blockers. I also got the regular brower pop up blocker. "
,Jugg141,2013-02-02T16:40Z,"AdBlock Plus 2.2.2 is the add onn im currently using, removes all ads and pop ups"
,HimeKi,2013-02-02T17:42Z,"Hey, IDIOTS!  Could you comment on the QUALITY OF THIS TORRENT instead of some shit that should be discussed some place where it could actually make a difference? 
"
,ZoolooCH,2013-02-02T17:42Z,"If you want to browse safely on TPB use NoScript and do not allow scripts from thepiratebay.sx. Yes, the website is infested with malware and people trying to send you to malicious websites with their hidden links. Live with it."

,skulldragon,2013-02-03T00:54Z,"More ""some shit that should be discussed some place where it could actually make a difference"":

Instead of AdBlock Plus, get AdBlock Edge:
This fork will provide the same features as Adblock Plus 2.X and higher but without ""acceptable ads"" feature."

Wreck-It Ralph is a really good film they only thing that bugged me was that the video wasn't HD. None the less best quality available now. The movie was nostalgic but had a modern twist to it. If you can I recommend seeing it on the big screen.

Thanks juggs99 and to the ripper.   "

They did a great job on the effects. 
I also think they did pretty well with ""Glitch,"" effects and character wise.
Awesome characters, and an overall great storyline. 
I don't think they could have done better choosing the voices either. Sarah Sliverman was a great touch. 
Overall, a very good movie. "
