I downloaded these as mkv files and they didn't play right on my Xbox using media player server so I re-encoded and stripped directors commentary. I figured most kids wouldn't care about that stuff. Hope you enjoy em. leave a comment and let me know what you think. Sorry guys I messed up the audio on one of the episodes and fixed it this is the re-fixed fixed files in a new torrent u should be able to point it at the same directory and not have to re-down everything.
