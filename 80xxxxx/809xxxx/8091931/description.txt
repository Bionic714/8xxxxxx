In Holland we would say: I laid my egg. I want to close with 31 Indie tracks I could not include in one of the last playlists (bit older) but quality wise, they should have been (and you should have heard at least once).

So, a kind of farewell. Making a point, closing the Old, to be able to start something new.

Enjoy... and maybe some day.
