it needs 4.31 version 
any help !!"
,evilbot,2013-02-01T22:25Z,"It works for everything above 4.21.  If there's a problem, it most likely lies with you.  Check to be sure your game is the same version as the one being patched.  And if you want help, be specific.  Give us the game title, firmware you're using, errors you receive, steps you've taken to troubleshoot the situation."

,SMALLJIM,2013-02-02T08:24Z,"HI evilbot Would you be interested in being on a private tracker uploader of games?

Greetings"
,evilbot,2013-02-02T10:15Z,"Hi SMALLJIM, yes, I would be very interested in that. I used to be on Demonoid under a different name before ""The Fall"" and had a ratio of above 16:1 with over 3 TB uploaded. Please tell me more. I set up an email address (at gmail) you can write to: evilbotdoesps3
I'm sure you know what to do with the address to make it work ;-) Thank you!"
,evilbot,2013-02-02T10:19Z,"Hi SMALLJIM :-)  Yes, I would be very interested in that.  I've sort of been surfing through the ether looking for a place to call home after Demonoid went down.  I was on there under a different name before ""The Fall"" with a ratio of over 16:1 and over 3 TB uploaded.  Please tell me more.  I've set up a gmail dot com address you can write to:  evilbotdoesps3
I'm sure you know what to do to make that address whole.  Thank you!"
,evilbot,2013-02-02T10:28Z,"@Damjan664:  You download a PSN game, install the .pkg file in XMB or Multiman, then you use the crack to make it work on the new firmwares.  I have no idea what would happen if you went online.  You'd probably get a ban hammer in the face unless you were taking precautions like using Multiman stealth and F*ckPSN, et cetera.  Until we're able to dual boot or the PS3 gets blown wide open, there are no guarantees.  I'm using a jailbroken PS3 that is not connected to anything but electricity.  My other PS3 is on official firmware and connected to the internet.  I use it for games that I buy in the shop and on PSN."
,SMALLJIM,2013-02-02T10:57Z,"ok evilbot i contact with you for gmail ;)

thanks!"
,safir11,2013-02-02T11:29Z,is this work like reactPSN ?
,evilbot,2013-02-02T17:33Z,"I have never used reactPSN so I'm assuming the answer to that is no.  If you find a crack that isn't working, let me know.  Sometimes they can be funky.  Trine 2 is an example."
,Chavezsr,2013-02-03T21:54Z,@evilbot!:) how can I convert all my psn games to play on the newer firmware???? I looked all over google and I have found no methods:( could you please let me know how to do it? I'm not asking you to do it? I want to learn!:)
