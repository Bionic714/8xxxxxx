,x_PseudoAnonymous,2013-05-04T17:51Z,"Fucking excellent work! I am watching the Mental Math one, and downloading a few more of your torrents as I write this. A small suggestion (and a humble one at that) is including subtitles in future releases. I would then be led to use a significantly higher amount of profanity to show my appreciation. Adieu!"
