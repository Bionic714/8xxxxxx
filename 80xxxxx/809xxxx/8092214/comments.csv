,TheLathe,2013-02-02T06:00Z,"This is a great film!  Appreciate your effort  : )

The only thing is, that your other torrent 'TEQUILA SUNRISE' (I left a detailed comment on it) would just not frigg'n PLAY on my OPPO once I burned it.  I just finished having to re-encode the whole thing to see if that would help, so I'm kinda leary of trying this one.

As I asked on the other post, is there anything you do when you encode your movies that would cause my OPPO blu-ray player to just completely freeze up?

Any suggestions or thoughts would be great.

Thanks!"
[T],analogreflections,2013-02-02T11:08Z,"I am sorry, but I play movies only on computer, don't have that player you've mentioned to test them. Could it be the .mkv format?"
,phase700b,2013-02-02T15:43Z,"@TheLathe, I only use a computer for playback also, but I suggest running the file through MKVToolNix before you burn it to disc. http://www.bunkus.org/videotools/mkvtoolnix/downloads.html  Sometimes just running this tool on a file can straighten out a slight glitch that can make a difference. It's free and very useful if you work with MKV's.  "
,TheLathe,2013-02-03T03:03Z,"@OP & Phase700b

Thanks for your replies guys; I appreciate it.  No, it is not just the MKV format since I've burned and played hundreds from here.  I do know that there are some limitations to what my OPPO can play such as a higher level (anything higher than 4.1) or sometimes too many reference frames or DEFINITELY Header Stripping.  And YES, just as you say Phase700b I do indeed usually run it through MKVMerge, etc. if a file has any of these things.  I've even used MKVClean which is a CMD line function, but none of these helped 'TEQUILA SUNRISE' so I re-encoded it using MKVUncrop setting it at L4.1 with 3 ref frames which took about 4 hours and now it's perfect!

I was jut a bit leery about trying another one from you (no offense of course  : )  Maybe I can burn a little snippet to a regular DVD-r and see if it plays first with this one (DAMN good film; I HOPE so! : )

Thanks!"
,TheLathe,2013-02-03T03:12Z,"BTW, for such a CLASSIC as this film and to have a nice rare HD print of it, I don't mind at all re-encoding ones like this if I have too  : )

Sure appreciate you posting really great rare films like this!!!"
,TheLathe,2013-02-03T03:46Z,"Actually, this time with this movie it played just fine   Looks frigg'n AWESOME, BTW!  How nice to have an HD print of this classic film.  Beautiful job!!!

I guess it was just some odd anomaly with 'TEQUILA SUNRISE'; I'll put you on my 'GOOD' uploader list.

: )

Cheers mate!"
[T],analogreflections,2013-02-04T00:20Z,"I'm glad to hear that other torrents are fine. I could reencode ""Tequila Sunrise"" if needed, but if the problem only shows on that specific device, perhaps it's easier you do it yourself in Handbrake or something. "
,TheLathe,2013-02-05T08:01Z,"No, not necessary, thanks mate!

I already did it with UncropMKV and it came out just fine  : )"
,heliogab,2013-05-31T04:35Z,Thanks a lot Mr analogreflections.
