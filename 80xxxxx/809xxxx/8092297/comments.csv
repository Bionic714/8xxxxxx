,msnowden,2013-02-01T21:00Z,"i love you publicHD, and i have tons of your movies, but you gotta figure out a better compression because 15gigs is just way too big for a movie :("
,msnowden,2013-02-01T21:02Z,"a followup thought, can you make your torrents have separate subtitle files so we can skip downloading them if we don't need them :D ?"
,Cyph3r19,2013-02-01T22:42Z,"@msnowden, the filesize is perfect for a 1080p release. The problem is your ISP needs to give you faster speeds or you need a bigger harddrive :).

Granted i live in a 3rd world country but i try to grab the remux (20GB-48GB full ISOs) sometimes because they worth it.

If you want smaller, grab the BRRip or similar releases.

Bigger filesizes are for people who understand QUALITY OVER QUANTITY (howdy to QoQ) :-P"
,Cyph3r19,2013-02-01T22:43Z,"Whoops, can't edit here. Subtitles can be found via google or subscene.org. No need to provide them seperately as they are spread relatively fast.

Thanks to BOZX for the share."

Dude, if you have ANY experience here at all, you will bloody KNOW that Mr. BOZX puts out the whole Blu-ray (about 40+ Gigs) in one torrent, the Blu-ray remux (this torrent) and if you will just bloody WAIT a little, he then puts out both the 1080 and 720 torrents that usually fit on DVD DL and DVD-r respectively.

So, PLEASE DON'T ASK for smaller posts because you WILL frigg'n get them!!!

GEEZ...!"
,west188,2013-02-02T00:01Z,"nice, thanks! (perfect file size :)"

FUCK YOU CHEAP BASTARD"
,TheLathe,2013-02-02T06:08Z,"Well, that too...

(heh heh heh...)"
,psychoacer,2013-02-02T20:26Z,If you want the movie to be more compressed then get one that is more compressed. Their is so many different releeases of this and every movie that you should be able to find one that suits you. This is for those of us who want the least amount of compression and to look the most like Blu Ray. Yify has a heavily compressed version if you want a 2 gig 1080p movie with 480p quality. Also there is a 9 gig version if you want to lose some but not a lot of detail. It includes the same main track but no commentary. So I think we would all prefer Bozx to release what he wants so we all have choices.

Thanks again."
,gjones88,2013-02-03T03:04Z,"@msnowden,

You are incredibly fucking stupid."
,DarkKV,2013-02-03T11:40Z,Thanks man
,marc_lucas,2013-02-03T16:13Z,"When you guys have stopped bitching at each other how about you COMMENT ON THE MOVIE QUALITY if you wanna chat GO FIND A CHAT ROOM!
Is it the real deal, i.e is it a pukka 1080p Bluray!?"
,FlankerB1,2013-02-03T21:17Z,"@TheLathe

This torrent isn't a remux. A remux of this movie takes about 27 GB of space. This is a high quality rip. "
,FlankerB1,2013-02-03T21:20Z,PS: I agree that bozx uploads great encodes. And this is one of them.
,dhumich,2013-02-04T08:09Z,people who want quality should not crap about gigs...Blueray rip always huge...if its a small file..then you are compromising on something....so stop bitching and only download if you want a better quality....great upload BOZX... 
,bordo84,2013-02-05T01:57Z,"it´s not such a great encode guys at the end of the movie when the house is burning there are some really visible errors in image when volumetric light is tore apart and too low bitrate i was a little disappointed because the rest of the movie is brilliantly ripped....

and to those fuckers who want less size i say just the opposite this movie could be ripped at least at 18 mbps bitrate and it would be perfect bluray.. 12,8 mbps is too little especially for the movie without grain and noise like this one.... it was usual back then now there are either remuxes or just low 9 mbps rips and no quality rip too sad.."
,bordo84,2013-02-05T14:50Z,or at least 15 mbps considering full bluray has 22 average...either way i still trust publichd.. ´cause there are also groups which can´t make a good rip even at 20 mbps average bitrate
,iHaunteR,2013-02-06T18:08Z,A 14.4 gb 1920x800. Good job bro. 
,xxDominatorxx2,2013-02-12T17:04Z,seed please !!
,misda,2013-02-13T21:07Z,"This is a great file 10/10. Also, a question: I DL these movies and play them through my external HD plugging it in the BR player. All 3TB's play extremely well, except this movie. Why would this movie play on my computer but not through my HD, BR player and TV set up? I don't want to find another torrent because of the excellent quality of this one."
,MoRggUeS,2013-02-14T05:27Z,"@misda, I had the same problem you did, couln't play it from my external HD via USB using my BR, it even frozes my BR every time i wan't to play it, had to do hard shut down for that, I've played thousands of movies this way, and this particularly one is the first that turned this way, something went wrong with this fucking file"
,tflagger997,2013-02-15T00:16Z,Too bad you guys cannot notice that it is 800p.  Get his 27GB version for real 1080p.
,shloch,2013-02-18T18:33Z,somebody knows what is the movie format?
,Tankocity,2013-02-22T23:18Z,"A: 10
V: 10

English spoken.  No Hardcoded subs.

Sounds great, looks great.  Awesome up!"
,kiwij,2013-02-23T12:48Z,"Thanks for the upload, I love that you release multiple versions, this is the best version for me as I don't have HD audio and I don't mind a small amount of video compression to save space."
,Ajvar89,2013-03-11T18:46Z,"Thnx to the uploader! Movie was OK as i expected it to be! I usually watch all the movies at film.maswagg.com because they have HD's but they didn't have this one so im happy to have piratebay :) Good torrent quality - A9 V9,"
