Post #635 has links to a fix file that you can use.  Put the files and folders in /dev_hdd0/game/BLES01269 and it will work."

I did everything that the guide said, with the only difference being that my FF XIII-2 is in an external HDD, so I used the external HDD folder instead.

But when I try to start the game: error 80010017. 


I know this may sound like laziness, but I'm completely dumb when it comes to these things and always rely in tutorials.

Also, if I don't get these DLC here, I'll probably only catch a glimpse of them on YouTube. ><

So, preety, preety please? 6.6'"
