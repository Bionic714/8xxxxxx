This is all the latest update and all the DLC that exists for Final Fantasy XIII-2.  Only works for the EUR version.  That means it does NOT WORK FOR USA, JAP, KOR, ETC VERSIONS!  Will work for firmwares 3.40 and up.  Instructions on how to install included in text file.

I've got a lot of PS3 stuff, can get my hands on most anything and enjoy trading and seeding with around 1.2 Mbytes/sec, but I've no idea what to do with myself now that Demonoid is toast so I'll be uploading here.
