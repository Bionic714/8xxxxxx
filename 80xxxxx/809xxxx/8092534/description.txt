My dinner with jimi is a movie that tells the story of how the band The Turtles first traveled to England in 1967 to meet other musicians such as The Beatles, but not before some drug-crazed funny army dodging by two of the band members.

hey i think the movie is awesome and i noticed it wasn't here so.
