Straight out of Memphis, Tn. comes the powerful sound of 714. Todd Poole (vocals/guitar), Matt Dees (bass), Jimmy Fulp (drums), and Chris Turnbow (guitar) make up a quartet of pure energy. With the release of their self-titled CD, the band exploded onto the local music scene playing every live show they could to build a following. After shooting two videos for the CD the band started getting some local and national radio play. "American Tragic "is the second release from 714. This time around the guys decided to record and produce the CD themselves. The result - 14 unforgettable tracks filled with raw power and emotion. The title track is already getting radio play, as is the second single "Beautiful Tonite." With a live show that blows the roof off, 714 is one band you don't want to miss!

Todd Poole, the singer, was the singer in Roxy Blue and he was also the original drummer in Saliva.
