Storyline
A young woman's struggle to overcome life's economic restrictions in order to meet her true will. She is twenty-three and lives with her mother, a compromise she can no longer stand. Despite her meager economic means, only enough to survive the first two months, she moves out and rents a 45m2 apartment of her own. During these two months of freedom, she explores her true self and approaches a more poetic and liberal culture, for her, a new way of life that slowly unfolds as she rummages through the belongings that the former renter, a guy her age, has left in the apartment.
