,sunsetrider,2013-02-02T09:48Z,"@soletar The fuck you talking about? He's not homo as far as i know, or are you jealous of him banging chicks?"
,coolguy555,2013-02-02T11:56Z,Awesome quality as always...
,AxOpLiX,2013-02-02T13:02Z,"Thanks a ton, YIFY!"
,soletar,2013-02-02T13:30Z,"@sunset rider...this is what i saw on IMDB


""I first started hearing rumours about him being a homosexual, visiting gay bars and photographed kissing men just after Casino Royale...Then he confessed to being uncomfortable in sex scenes ( how many have you seen in his 3 Bond films)?

He also dressed in drag in a commercial advocating non-violence against women and acted as a queer on Saturday Night Live, Javier Bardem made homosexual innuendoes in Skyfall...

So , YES. Daniel Craig is a faggot!. And YES, i envy him his job but not his sexuality


Is he the first gay 007? Or just an unusually ""homophilic"" Bond?

Time would tell, my bet is he is gay..... Am not homophobic,just curious about all the coincidences"
,soletar,2013-02-02T13:36Z,And YES i envy his his job...but i don't envy him being a faggot
,fuckyou143,2013-02-02T14:52Z,SHITTY AUDIO BITRATE.. LOL..

,sk5835,2013-02-02T19:45Z,"Great copy, thanks a million! 

BTW, Daniel Craig was married, had a daughter, got divorced, dated a woman for 7 years, dumped her, dated another woman for 6 years, then dumped her and married Rachel Weisz. So, this gay talk is retarded."

,soletar,2013-02-02T22:23Z,"@sk5835....check the meaning of ""keeping up appearances"" in the dictionary. Then check ""retarded"", if you see your photograph there, do not be surprised. MORON"
,.ACTiVE.,2013-02-02T23:20Z,Who the fuck cares if he's gay or not.
,punx_roxer,2013-02-03T04:59Z,Yes!!!! Thank you YIFY!!! You Rock!!!

,tywebb661e,2013-02-10T09:25Z,"Why would Craig have to ""keep up appearances""?
