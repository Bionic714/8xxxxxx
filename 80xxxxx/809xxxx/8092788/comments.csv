,skoumoun,2013-02-01T23:14Z,"Though you could have included subs, they take essentially no space !"
,sugarpuffextreme,2013-02-01T23:25Z,"Yeah I know subs take no space but I remux bluray isos for my own collection and I got OCD when it comes to unnecessary things inside the mkv container.

I dont use subtitles expect english which in that case I download elsewhere because blurays english subs are usually for hearing impaired and they suck bigtime lol, they put subtitle on car sounds and bird sounds and stuff like that."
