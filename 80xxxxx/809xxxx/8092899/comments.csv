,Reaper1218,2013-02-06T03:01Z,"thanks, and one more request. Can you do the twilight movies?"
,eroticburps,2013-02-06T10:48Z,"hi dhjudasx.. i hope that you are still working your way out on Terminator 2: Judgment Day [1991].. can't wait to seet it. Would you also consider encoding the ""Uncut"" versions of Predator [1987] and Predator 2 [1990] in your kinda way. Thank You.."
,mi.tom,2013-02-07T15:38Z,"Bro some arnold classics please...predator,true lies,total recall."
,PikaB,2013-02-07T21:30Z,"Thks for all your job dhjudasx!
Would-it be a hard job to you to add some more sub? If you could do it, it'll be awesome ;)"
,brait42,2013-02-08T03:48Z,"Judas... man... is there some way we can donate money for you? Seriously, your rips are awesome!

Other rippers claim their rips have the same quality a 20GB file have but that's bullshit. Now, your files... man, I've encoded lots of videos before and I have no idea how you get this size without any major quality loss. No weird stuff in action scenes, no excessive blocks in still shots... seriously, I have no idea on how you do this, but I like it and I think you should accept some donations from us"
,stativarius,2013-02-08T06:17Z,"Where did you go?

Come back to us!"
[V],dhjudasx,2013-02-08T07:18Z,"i'm still here don't worry....

I've just been a wee bit busy with genereal life things..

plus it's hard to keep up on everything. I would say on average it was working out to about 2-4 hours worth of my own time personally that was being consumed in managing encoding and uploading.... (obviously excluding time I didn't have to be at the machine... such as seeding and letting the computer do the encoding itself)

Sometimes one needs a little bit of a break."
,pro346pro,2013-02-08T12:59Z,Take a well deserved break! Its not like you get paid for this haha!
