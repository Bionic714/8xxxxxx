Compliant with Xbox360/PS3/iPads/Mobile Devices/etc. devices that require the primary Audio stream to be AAC Stereo (many do not accept/work with AAC 5.1 format). Audio Stream 2 available to those that also wish to experience great 5.1 sound that goes right alongside great picture quality.

For those experiencing LOW VOLUME issues, try to playback the 2nd Audio stream in stereo mode, this should improve audio quality and increase the volume substantially.

If you wish to experience 5.1 audio on the original PS3 or Newer PS3, Just select the audio options and ensure the 5.1 stream/track is selected.

PC Users will have to use something like VLC that allows you to choose the 2nd Audio stream/track, Depending on your configuration, vlc should automatically enable 5.1 playback after the track change, but double check by selecting AUDIO ~ Audio Device ~ 5.1

Judas's Note:

Those that are noticing that there is "minimal" black bars on either side of the image is the way the bluray appears. It is not an encoding error. I choose to keep them in so that there isn't a "resize" stretching errors the involves splitting of pixels to fit the screen (this causes blur and other issues when there is a pixel shift always occuring... it's like being just a hair out of focus on the camera... not horrible but comparing side by side would be very noticeable if it's not 1:1 ratio)

I've also had people ask me why i occasionally have that "slight" hair size bar above or below, why not crop it 100% perfect? The reason is that breaking away from the 16 pixel block height results in a disadvantage in the encoding process. The moment you break the 16 pixel height tile/block it actually results in slight decrease in accuracy for the compression used. It's the difference in a 1920x800 that has a 50 block count (800/16=50) vs 1920x798 which is 49.875 block count. Things just "fit" and work out better overall.
