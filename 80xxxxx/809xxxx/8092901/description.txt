Scotland Investigates: Scotched Earth
Whisky is a global success story. Sold in over two hundred countries, the business is worth more than four billion pounds every year. Ten thousand people owe their living to it. Douglas Fraser set out to discover how whisky became so successful: as a part of our culture, as a symbol of our national identity, and as a vital part of our economy. He asks whether Scotland is getting enough back from whisky, and hears how we could cash in more on this amazing business success.
