Your Roadmap to Physical GloryΓÇöOne Step At a TimeΓÇª
In Paul WadeΓÇÖs Convict Conditioning system, no matter what kind of movement youΓÇÖre working on, you focus on a chain of ten progressive exercises. When you master one exercise, you move on to the next, and so on. Because the later exercises build on the earlier ones, they are sometimes called the "ten steps". When you reach the tenth exercise, you will be just about as strong as itΓÇÖs possible for a human being to be in that movement. For this reason, the tenth exercise in any chain is called the "Master Step". How this all works will be crystal clear if youΓÇÖve picked up a copy of the Convict Conditioning bodyweight book. 
Why you need a steel-whip spine
If you go into any gym, youΓÇÖll see lots of guys working hard to train their biceps, their pecs, their lats and so on. But perhaps the most neglected muscles in modern strength training are the muscles of the backΓÇöin particular the deep layer of muscles that run up and along the spine. These are the spinal erectors.
The spinal column and hips are an essential feature of any body that needs to be strong or athletic. This area is like the universal joint on a motor vehicle. All the pressure of running, punching, lifting and tackling goes straight through the spineΓÇöso if you want a body thatΓÇÖs explosive, powerful and as injury-proofed as possible, the best way to get it isnΓÇÖt through working your "beach muscles" like your biceps or pecs. The best way to toughen up your entire body is by toughening up your spinal column.
Previous generations of prison athletes understood the role that the back and spine muscles play in overall toughness. In a way, prison athletes, certainly before the seventies, were lucky when it came to spinal training; they didnΓÇÖt have access to the kind of distractions that athletes on the outside had. WeΓÇÖre talking about Nautilus back training machines, Cybex machines, hyperextension units or cable machines. Back in the day, convicts didnΓÇÖt even have weights to train their backs withΓÇöno deadlifts, good mornings or cleans.
If prisoners wanted to build powerful back muscles, they had to access the more ancient, traditional methods, using bodyweight alone. Luckily for them, the very finest back training techniques are bodyweight exercisesΓÇövariations of the bridge family of techniques.
About Convict Conditioning-style bridging
Bridging is an excellent, ancient approach to building a strong, supple spineΓÇöand if you do it properly itΓÇÖs very safe. A lot of weightlifting for the back involves bending forwards with a heavy weight, and this can cause the discs to pop out, or make muscles rupture or split when the spine is stretched forwards under great pressure. Bridging is different; it involves arching the back. This "locks" the vertebrae into place, prevents subluxation and actually heals old back injuries rather than generating new ones. Prison bridges are different from most approaches because instead of just holding the bridge position, or moving to different positions, the athlete repeats the technique over and over, going up and down and back againΓÇöjust like you would if you were doing pushups, for example. This approach not only increases flexibility, stamina and tendon strength all at the same time, it also goes a long way towards building muscle.
ItΓÇÖs pretty cool to have twin pythons of solid beef running up your spine. And prison-style bridges are also a fantastic workout for the shoulders, arms and legs. 

Bodyweight mastery is a lot like high-level martial arts. ItΓÇÖs more about principles than individual techniques. Want a REALLY powerful spine, with dense tendons and thick muscles? Then study and absorb these principles, and youΓÇÖll be on your way to a steel-whip spine in no time. Powerful, healthy spinal erectors that are trained to arch well, are worth their weight in gold to any strength athlete.
