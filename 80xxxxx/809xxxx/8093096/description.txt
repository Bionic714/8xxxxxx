"DE-PROGRAMMED," Part Three: "The Life and Death of Jason Wynn" - Conclusion
Since his sudden awakening from a mysterious coma in the pages of SPAWN 185, Jim Downing, the world's newest Hellspawn, has been searching for his past. At every turn answers were given in the form of more questions, but his time spent looking back has come to an end.

As Jason Wynn weaves his final tale, the great manipulator will set Spawn up for something they both long for - freeing Jim of the burden of his human past, and unwittingly paving the way for a threat far greater than any imagined.

Thanks goes to HALO and theProletariat for this release.
