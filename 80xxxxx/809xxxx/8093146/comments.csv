Predictable, that.  

RANT ON
Lately, Apple has been making many Apple applications refuse to run on older versions of the Mac OS, and older versions of the Mac OS won't run the latest versions of many of Apple's applications.    Links to any news articles about this trend? (I am talking about rather recent versions of both, not ancient history.) 

ANNOYANCE: I try to run versions of iPhoto and iTunes and iMovie, IIRC that came with iLife 2011 and they won't run.  Must update.  I was able to run iLife 2009 apps on Mountain Lion until recently.    They MUST be updated with the updaters. (The updaters are freely available for download from Apple, at least - and only run if they find the old version)....

ANNOYANCE: Only the very latest version of iTunes will update an iOS device with the latest iOS. The others spit out marginally useful messages saying the problem might be one of a dozen things, one of which is that you need to update all your apps...

But RIZZO220, you can download Mountain Lion itself from this site...   You really want to stay with Snow Leopard?  Even ancient Macs can be made to run Lion and ML.  Me, I paid the $20 for ML, and was happy to... initially!  BUT, all this required updating to the latest versions of everything has pissed me off.   I'm wondering if it's this way for technical reasons for for other more nefarious reasons, and would bet it's mainly the latter."

Hey, folks!  Feedback, please, friends!  Success? Failure? Details?  Sharing is caring!  I want to hear from humans using this.
