This here is Version 13 (444) of Disk Utility found running on a iMac or Mac Mini configured for Fusion Drive running Mac OS X 10.8.2 Mountain Lion

Other Macs running Mac OS X 10.8.2 Mountain Lion come with version 13 (426) of Disk Utility.app

Whether the differences are helpful to those wanting full Fusion Drive features including intelligent data migration is not clear, but some say it is helpful.

(You can ignore the 'hfsCompression' - it doesn't mean anything; the file here is not hfsCompressed; it couldn't be, as hfsCompression can't exist in a torrent.)

Feedback welcome.  

See, e.g. Fusion drive on older Macs? YES!
