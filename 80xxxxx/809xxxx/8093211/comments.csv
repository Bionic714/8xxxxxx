,zyzykwy,2013-02-05T18:10Z,This file is over 4 gigs.  Zip files over 4 gigs often give difficulty in opening.  My system says this is a corrupted or part of a spanned archive zip file.  It won't open with any archive program I have so I just wasted 2 days and 4.5 gigs of DL bandwidth getting a zip file that doesn't work.
