The second album from The Burns Unit member Kim Edgar raises the bar from where her acclaimed debut album left off, mixing delicate folk rock melodies with KimΓÇÖs uniquely Scottish and poignant lyrics. EdgarΓÇÖs harmonious piano playing and a voice full of emotion help bring to life heavy issues ranging from child neglect to mortality. Intense and thought provoking whilst being an enjoyable listen, The Ornate Lie is another success in the career of Edgar, surely public acclaim must follow soon. Tracks ΓÇÿNot for SharingΓÇÖ, ΓÇÿFragileΓÇÖ and the powerfully emotional yet warm ΓÇÿThe Steamy NoteΓÇÖ cannot be ignored.
