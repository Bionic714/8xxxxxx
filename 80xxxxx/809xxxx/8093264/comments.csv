,georgesteel32,2013-02-03T13:44Z,i cant find english subtitles anywhere.anyone?
,stalkersrage,2013-02-03T15:03Z,"It's only called The Haunting in Connecticut 2 so that they can make it part of the franchise. The story is set in Georgia, and has nothing to do with the first film...Which is a good thing, since The Haunting in CT was one of the worst movies to come out in the last 10 years. Absolutely unwatchable. Thankfully, this couldn't possibly be worse."
,dubblue4,2013-02-03T15:28Z,thanks
,lion33436,2013-02-03T20:25Z,another stupid movie for black people to be entertained. smh!!!! its fake get over it !! and watch a film with some substance.

,DrMD,2013-02-04T20:15Z,"A/V=9 But the movie is 1 hr too long, filled with all kinds of bullshit that takes forever to end. It took me 2 days just to get through it without FF the whole damn thing. I'd pause it or stop it and return to watch it in pieces. WARNING don't waste your download or the time to watch."
,JamieleeEchelon,2013-02-04T20:27Z,"1st off wtf does this movie have to do with black people? u racist fuckin moron..dont come n comment on a movie that ur sayin is ""shitty"" bc even if it is, WTF r u doing here then?! u must have no life to comment on a movie that u supposedly arent even downloadin..losers.."

,ust2,2013-02-09T00:33Z," ""Enjoj""

 lol they could atleast learn to speak english if they're going to try to dupe us into clicking those spam links.

 Is anyone even really stupid enough to goto them? I honestly can't figure out why they even bother trying when they are so obvious."
,Pdid,2013-02-09T02:12Z,"@ganjubi Why don't you comment on the movie, bitch?"
,tiffani7772003,2013-02-09T06:49Z,ok so i thought u were suppose to comment on the movie and move on i hate checking to see if its good or not cause i have to read what some ppl put in the comments...grow up.
,browndog75,2013-02-13T01:56Z,Why do people ask for english subtitles for a movie spoken in english I don't get it. Is there a subset of ESL folk that can read better then hear? Not making a joke I'm truly curious.
,klxl,2013-02-14T12:21Z,this is an awesome movie :)

,MrILLY23,2013-02-25T20:55Z,"To all those whom are historically illiterate... It's 100% possible for ghost from Georgia to be ""haunting"" people in Connecticut... Remember the ""Underground Railroad""? It runs all the way up the East Coast and yes into CONNECTICUT... Some of you need to restart life in the 1st grade... Oh and thanks for the upload!"
