,evolved72,2013-02-21T02:03Z,"I CANNOT BELIEVE…

I seriously cannot believe that AFTER ALL THIS TIME there are still people involved in the torrent world who don't seem to have a clue that virtually ALL keygens look suspicious to antivirus/antimalware software. People, like @BestNick4sure but he is by no means the only one, GET A FRIGGIN' CLUE; unless this is the very first time you download a piece of cracked software there is NO EXCUSE for being this dense. Did it ever occur to you noobs that the OP won't post unless he's verified it and is 100% sure it's good? And it also doesn't occur to you that a worldwide reputable site like TPB won't allow bullshitters to just put up any dumb fucking piece of claptrap SW they feel like? AND THIS ONE IS A VERIFIED TORRENT ON TOP OF IT. This isn't your local let the bullshit roll forum, kiddies… GET A CLUE, LEARN, EVOLVE for fuck's sake!

Big exhale. I'm done.

Humm. Torrent is excellent, proceed as always, disabling internet, antivirus, etc, until done. My thanks to ChingLiu, helluva nice one dude, I'm lookin' forward to this after about 3 yrs of X3!"

 Part 1: Installing PSPX5 Itself
====================

1. SEVER YOUR INTERNET CONNECTION — VERY IMPORTANT OR IT WON'T WORK!

2. Start in the ""Setup"" folder:
   - launch ""setup.exe""
   - accept license agreement
   - select language(s)

3. Next screen:
   - uncheck ""Google Toolbar""
   - click ""Install Now""... takes a couple of minutes
   - click ""Finish""

Will do a brief initialization and primary installation is complete – PSPX5 is installed on your system but still has a 30-day evaluation time limit for the time being.


==============================
 Part 2: Disabling the 30-Day Evaluation Limit
==============================

1. Launch the program and, on the screen that opens:
   - click ""Continue""
   - select ""Register later"" which is the bottom choice
   - click ""Continue""

2. PSPX5 itself will open and ask about file formats:
   - choose
   - close the program

3. Next screen:
   - message up top saying you have 30 days left to evaluate
   - other message bottom left saying ""Already purchased""
   - click ""Already purchased""

4. Leave this screen as is for now, and, back in the install folders:
   - enter the ""Keygen - CORE"" folder
   - run ""Keygen.exe""

   NOTE: Some antivirus/antimalware programs will immediately flag the Keygen and quarantine it; this is normal and is a false positive and is common with keygens; you need to either tell these programs to ignore the Keygen or temporarily disable them altogether; eg. Malwarebytes Anti-Malware needs to be temporarily disabled altogether as it will quarantine the Keygen over and over every time you run it as there is no way to tell it to permanently ignore the Keygen as far as I know.

   - In Keygen app select ""Corel PaintShop Pro X5"" in ""Programs"" field
   - click ""Serial"" at the bottom to generate a serial no.
   - copy the serial no. to the clipboard

5. Back to the PSPX5 screen you had left aside:
   - paste the serial# where indicated AT THE TOP
   - select ""Phone Corel"" (internet connection should still be closed!)
   - an installation code will be generated
   - just leave it on your screen, you can't copy this one to clipboard

6. Back to the Keygen window for the last time:
   - locate the ""Installation Code"" field
   - delete the words ""Enter Your Installation Code here!""
   - turn on [Caps Lock] to make things easier
   - manually type in the 20-char installation code without the hyphens
   - click the ""Activation"" button at the bottom
   - an activation code has been generated in ""Activation Code"" field
   - copy this activation code to the clipboard

7. Back to PSPX5 for the last time:
   - paste the activation code where indicated 
   - click ""Continue""
   - if all went well you will see the following message...

""Thank you, your purchase is now complete""

     ...and it means the 30-day evaluation limit has been disabled and PSPX5 with SP1 (service pack one... for service pack 2 see Part 3) has been permanently installed on your system.

8. One thing remains:
   - launch PSPX5... this time there will be a ""Corel Guide"" window
   - click the gears icon top-right corner
   - select ""Message preferences""
   - uncheck both boxes and click ""OK""
   - close ""Corel Guide"" window
   - close PSPX5


======================
 Part 3: Updating PSPX5 with SP2
======================

Back in the install folders:
- go to the ""Update"" folder
- run ""PSPX5_SP2.exe"" file
- accept the license terms and click ""Update""
- takes about 3 minutes and half that time is spent at the 49% mark;
   this is normal, your system is NOT stuck!
- when done click ""Finish""


Close the Keygen if still open
Turn [Caps Lock] off if still on
Restore your internet connection if still severed
Smile & fire up a fatty
Puff, puff, pass :)

,poolballboy,2013-02-22T10:53Z,"Hi Guys. For some reason I am ot getting the Keygen file inside the download folder. All I am getting are a .NFO and a .DIZ file. both open as notepad pages. 

Any suggestions please?"
,sistems2,2013-02-25T21:47Z,"@poolballboy
some antivirus quarantine ""potential treats"" automatically and some see keygens as potential treats. you have 3 options

1. open your antivirus and find the ""quarantine"" files, look for the keygen and restore it to its original place

2. turn antivirus off, go to torrent client (utorrent, bittorrent or what ever you are using) right-click on the torrent where you are missing keygen and force re-check, it will check missing files and download them

3. if the first 2 didn't work try turning you antivirus off and re-download the whole thing again"
,canidae_33,2013-03-06T10:20Z,"is it safe?

short answer: ""probably""
Run MalwareBytes after installation to be safe.

,Heyystacyy,2013-04-20T22:17Z,"@Nothingfail, I pulled down my firewall and anti-virus software, as well as disabling my wifi while installing this. Try that.

Awesome upload, works perfectly. After losing my activation code for X3 I was pretty bummed(seeing as I'd actually purchased it)especially with Corel Customer Support being no help because X3 is an ""older version"" $80 bucks down the drain; but now I'm stoked to have X5- at no charge. Thanks uploader.
I followed evolved72's directions carefully and it worked very smoothly, thank you for those btw. "
