Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site :: Alex covers liberal media calls to boycott gun manufacturers on this Friday, February 1 edition of the Alex Jones Show. He also covers a DHS raid on a legal gun collector in New Mexico and the continuing and escalating assault on the Second Amendment by the feds. He talks with Pastor Steven Anderson in-studio today. Mr. Anderson was viciously tasered and assaulted by Border Patrol agents a couple years back for protesting at a Constitution free-zone checkpoint. 

Alex also talks with Rosa Koire, a forensic commercial real estate appraiser specializing in eminent domain valuation who opposes the draconian Agenda 21 plan for humanity. Koire is the author of Behind The Green Mask: U.N. Agenda 21.
