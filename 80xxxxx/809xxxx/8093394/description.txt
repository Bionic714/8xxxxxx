Complete soundtrack to Deus Ex Invisible War, ripped from the PC version, and mixed by myself for loops and fadeouts. This is the same version that's been kicking around on the internet as 'ripped by fishonthecarpet' - that's me.

I did not include the NG Resonance tracks by the KidneyThieves (Taxicab Messiah, S+M, Feathers, Layers, Trickster). They are available on KidneyThieves' album Trickstereprocess. Buy it. http://kidneythieves.com/home/
