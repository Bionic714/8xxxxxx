Unhitched: The Trial of Christopher Hitchens [pdf]
by Richard Seymour


Blistering and timely interrogation of the politics and motives of an infamous ex-leftist.


Irascible and forthright, Christopher Hitchens stood out as a man determined to do just that. In his younger years, a career-minded socialist, he emerged from the smoke of 9/11 a neoconservative ΓÇ£Marxist,ΓÇ¥ an advocate of AmericaΓÇÖs invasion of Iraq filled with passionate intensity. Throughout his life, he played the role of universal gadfly, whose commitment to the truth transcended the party line as well as received wisdom. But how much of this was imposture? In this highly critical study, Richard Seymour casts a cold eye over the career of the ΓÇ£HitchΓÇ¥ to uncover an intellectual trajectory determined by expediency and a fetish for power.

As an orator and writer, Hitchens offered something unique and highly marketable. But for all his professed individualism, he remains a recognizable historical typeΓÇöthe apostate leftist. Unhitched presents a rewarding and entertaining case study, one that is also a cautionary tale for our times.
