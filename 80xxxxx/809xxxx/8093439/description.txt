In this post we will see another problem book in mathematics titled Problems in Elementary Mathematics by V. Lidsky,  L. Ovsyannikov, A. Tuliakov and M. Shabunin.


This book is written by a group of Soviet mathematicians under the guidance of Professor Victor Lidsky D.Sc. (Phys. & Maths). It includes advanced problems in elementary mathematics with hints and solutions.

In each section - algebra, geometry and trigonometry - the problems are arranged in the order of increasing difficulty. There are 658 problems in all.

The text can be used in mathematical schools and school mathematical societies.

This book was translated from the Russian by V. Vosolov and was first published by Mir Publishers in 1973.

A note on the quality of the book: When the book was picked up from the net, it needed cleaning. We did the cleaning (somewhat), OCR and bookmarking.
