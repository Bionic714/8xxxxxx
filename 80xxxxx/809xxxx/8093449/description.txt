This is the most guitar led album dp ever recorded with Blackmore and Gillan in the band together, panned unjustly by the critics but produced immaculately and is the source of some of the finest tracks since the reformation - most notably Anya, Time To Kill and the title track, although A Twist in the Tale and the superbly paced Solitaire also shine. This is an album which has (for popular music) the rare quality of treating dynamic range as a part of the music, as a consequence it is at its best at a high volume on a reasonable stereo. 
The musicianship is more laid back than was fashionable in heavy rock at the time it was released, but is sharp and not over fussed, technically Anya is the high point of the album, showing the band's true potential.
