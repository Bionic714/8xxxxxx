As if no time has passed between past and present, that warm sonic breeze from Gothenburg (juxtaposed to its chilly real-life temps) has picked up again with the coming of Sweet Sensation and The Embassy's first collection of new material in eight years. Sweet Sensation is due on February 26, 2013 via Lindson & Håkansson's newly minted label, aptly named International. This new album finds The Embassy looking back while looking to a future not so far away, still brimming with ideas and living up to their reputation as Sweden’s prime pop professors.
