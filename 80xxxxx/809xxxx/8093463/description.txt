"Based on a True Story"

Upon learning that Cash is having difficulty 
writing a one-act play for an English project, 
Reba tells him to look to his own life and 
write what he knows. But Reba's advice comes 
back to haunt her when Cash writes a play that 
contains a lot of similarities to Reba and 
Bobby's marital woes. Meanwhile, Lillie Mae 
decides to embrace her artistic self when 
Geoffrey gets her into his improv class.
