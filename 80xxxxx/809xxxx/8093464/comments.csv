Thanks YIFY! Quality encode as usual. Not sure why some are bitching about audio. You are downloading a small size rip, of course there will be some compromises. There are full 10GB rips out there for the likes of you."
,nginx,2013-02-03T04:21Z,"Btw just to put doubts to rest, there's nothing wrong with audio and you won't notice any real difference if you have 2 channel systems. Only those with 5.1 channel or higher will be able to distinguish the lower quality from the original."

,HKCannibal,2013-02-04T02:47Z,"Really good movie.
I really like YIFY releases, I always download the 1080p to watch on my TV, sound system with somewhat simple.
But if you have a home theater device, or any nother type of equipment specific sound, I recommend searching for files containing DTS, to take advantage of the full capacity of their equipment. Without naming names of other groups, but a simple search you can find these files, try adapting the video quality to where it is executed, thus dispensing come here and complain about the file."
,wasimdon,2013-02-04T15:43Z,YIFY YOU ARE SOURCE OF PROVIDING GR8 FKIN THINGS UR UPLOADS ARE BEST SMALL AND 1080P ARE OF AMAZING QUALITY.................

,chrisgan,2013-02-04T20:06Z,Do you know a program for convertering a movie with a subtitle? I don't want to change the codification of the movie. 
,vampi11,2013-02-05T03:42Z,you guys rock!!
,patiodude,2013-02-05T04:05Z,"I finished the DL, ULd for all of you wonderful crew, and watched through the whole movie.

V - 10
A - 10
M - 10 

The audio is crystal clear, even on my weaksauce 40W desktop set. The video is simply awesome, although the compression causes some color information loss (banded sky gradient), although this is only noticeable if you're *really* looking for stuff like that.
The movie itself is awesome aswell, although I probably don't need to tell you that. Judi Dench's performance was remarkable, and Javier Bardem makes a fantastic bond villain (eccentricity and all). Daniel Craig, it goes without saying, was also excellent in this movie.

Just a side note, while this movie is 1920px wide (which is the norm for 1080p movies), it's letterboxed by the studio, which brings the res down to 800x1920."
,Malik9516,2013-02-05T07:15Z,"Hey YIFY. Congrats !!! You scored 3/3. After Dark knight returns and the flight, this is the third movie which is truncated. YIFY its about time you start uploading complete movies"

,Shadow416,2013-02-05T21:20Z,"YIFY has excellent torrents when it comes to picture quality, but audio is where it lacks, however to get around that. Use a headset (i use sony pulse headsets) and its mint. "

,gunnerfun,2013-02-08T22:34Z,"Hey, I'm not familiar with types of encoding. But I've always wondered why there are 1080p versions like this that are so relatively small compared to other versions that are 720p while being sized at 6-7 GB.

Anyone care to enlighten me on the difference?"
,ThePoet1408,2013-02-09T06:23Z,"@gunnerfun
I'm not the greatest with this kind of thing, but I think it's got something to do with the audio quality.
Also, it's not *full* 1080p, it's only 1920x800.  Granted, I don't think the resolution is the answer.
I never question YIFY.  Been a loyal follower for a while now.
YIFY, for me, is the equivalent of what SKULPTURA is (was?) for games.
Boy do I miss Skulptura."

,superpaperdude,2013-02-12T10:56Z,downloading now.  YIFY is always good. and sharkdog...you DO realize that you can turn off subtitles? or just delete the .srt file after you download? YIFY does not hardcode his subs.
