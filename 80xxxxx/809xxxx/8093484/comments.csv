,mmosakuji,2013-02-05T23:30Z,"A/V: who cares. Couldn't watch more than 5 minutes of this shit movie. I mean, thanx for the UL I guess, but really, it was a waste of your time :)"
,theleapfrog,2013-02-08T03:36Z,"after looking at the comments, i'm not downloading this lulz"
,OmegaScene,2013-02-20T03:12Z,"The movie was kind of slow and boring, with some cheap scares. Slightly interesting, enough to keep you watching. You might like it, you might not.

Actors weren't bad but there was a lot of boring ""arty"" shots that brought the whole movie down.
Thanks for the UL."

Thank you all."

I usually watch all the movies at film.greyfade.net because they have HD's but they didn't have this one so im happy to have piratebay :) Good torrent quality - A9 V9,"
