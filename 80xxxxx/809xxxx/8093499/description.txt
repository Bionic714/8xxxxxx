It appears that when Coheed and Cambria's Amory Wars saga was completed back in 2007, it didn't quite end. Or did it? First there was The Year of the Black Rainbow in 2010, an album reported to be a "prequel" to the Amory Wars recordings. Now, songwriter, guitarist, and vocalist Claudio Sanchez offers The Afterman: Ascension, the first part of a double album whose main character is someone named Cyrus Amory. Make of the name association what you will. Like every C&C recording, this one is detailed to the gills, musically, lyrically, sonically, and, of course, in product design. There are also some returns to the fold here. Co-producers Michael Birnbaum and Chris Bittner helmed the band's first three records, and drummer Josh Eppard, who played with the band from 2000-2006, is back.
