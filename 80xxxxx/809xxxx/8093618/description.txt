This review is not going to be objective. It is an exercise for me to justify my feelings that Silver Jews are the most wonderful band ever. ThatΓÇÖs right, I put a full stop. Ha. The man behind Silver Jews is David Berman, a man so mind-blowingly articulate, that half the time it is impossible to comprehend what heΓÇÖs saying. He is a lyrical genius. But what about the music, you fool?

ΓÇ£IΓÇÖd been lonely since she found ChristΓÇ¥

If youΓÇÖve ever read anything about the Joos, youΓÇÖll have seen a consistent name-drop; Pavement. Steven Malkmus is on this album. This album sounds like Pavement. When they were really good. Pavement combined with David Berman. Lush. Berman is a beautiful singer, but at the same time, heΓÇÖs the antithesis of his mate Will Oldham. He sings so passionately off-key, he invents a whole new key - the right key. All music that is not made in the key of Silver Jews is wrong. Simple as that.

ΓÇ£No one should have two lives, now you know my middle names are wrong and rightΓÇ¥

ΓÇÿAmerican WaterΓÇÖ opens with ΓÇÿRandom RulesΓÇÖ, a song about adultery. ItΓÇÖs sad, funny and confusing, just like all the other songs on this album. Did I mention that Berman is a lyrical genius? The next track, ΓÇÿSmith and Jones ForeverΓÇÖ is unrelenting, with BermanΓÇÖs vocals gratingly deep. In both senses of the word.

ΓÇ£Are you honest when no oneΓÇÖs looking?ΓÇ¥

By the third track, Berman already seems to be apologetic for his harsh music. ΓÇÿNight SocietyΓÇÖ is an instrumental. BermanΓÇÖs voice is nowhere to be seen, but itΓÇÖs still brilliant. Steve Malkmus is sharing the vocal duties now. MalkmusΓÇÖ melodic sweetness and BermanΓÇÖs forty-a-day tones, thatΓÇÖll never work. It does. Damn, this album is good.

ΓÇ£I love your amethyst eyes, your protestant thighsΓÇ¥

What does amethyst mean? Who cares. ΓÇÿBlue ArrangementsΓÇÖ, like so many of Silver JewsΓÇÖ songs, is fiercely self-conscious as a piece of music. It doesnΓÇÖt pretend to be a pearl of wisdom, just a song in an album full of wonderful songs. ItΓÇÖs not all abstract nonsense. ΓÇÿHonk If YouΓÇÖre Lonely TonightΓÇÖ is a straight up country and western song. I hate country and western music. I love this song. Each track is a highlight; everything bad about this record just makes it better; the spindly guitars, the directionless lyrics, the hollow harmonies.

ΓÇ£Why canΓÇÖt monsters get along with other monsters?ΓÇ¥

David Berman, you are a genius. Silver Jews rule my world. My world is beautiful. Come join me.
