Better late than never, I'm pleased to say that the debut release from Owl Service side project The Trysting Tree is now finally ready for release. I've been working on this music on and off for almost 2 years, it was among the first things we scheduled for release on Midwich via Southern but so many other strong releases have come along since that it ended up on the backburner and we kind of just forgot about it. I returned to the music recently having not played it for some time and I really enjoyed it; it sounded far more fully formed than I'd remembered, and so with just a slight brush up, here it is. 15 largely improvised tracks inspired by the short ghost stories of early 20th century author WF Harvey, 5 of which feature vocals from Laura Hulse. Handmade CD, limited to 100 numbered copies packaged in a jewel case with heavy paper and vellum inserts.
