Choosing the right producer can make or break a record. Take The CribsΓÇÖ scrapped sessions with David Richards for ΓÇÿIn The Belly Of The Brazen BullΓÇÖ, or Foals remixing ΓÇÿAntidotesΓÇÖ because Dave Sitek ΓÇ£made it sound like it was recorded in the Grand CanyonΓÇ¥. Both LPs were brilliant, but took a while to get there. The ΓÇÿbestΓÇÖ producers, see, arenΓÇÖt always the right ones.

But when you make the right decision, magic can happen. Such is the case with ΓÇÿMirage RockΓÇÖ. Choosing Glyn Johns (a man who has previously twiddled knobs for The Beatles, The Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin) could potentially have been a terrible idea, born from a need to say, ΓÇ£Yes Glyn, hop on board, you legend youΓÇ¥ ΓÇô because how could you say no? Turns out bringing his old-school rockΓÇÖnΓÇÖroll expertise into the southern-fried fold makes for a perfect match.

Enveloped in harmonies and My Morning Jacket-isms, BOH have always been a niche proposition ΓÇô capable of drawing devoted crowds, but a little too hicksville to fully pull the masses. On ΓÇÿMirage RockΓÇÖ, however, Ben Bridwell and co have been jump-started with a new swagger. The title track ΓÇô at once dreamy but, yΓÇÖknow, rocking ΓÇô encapsulates it perfectly. ΓÇÿKnockΓÇÖ opens at full pelt, BridwellΓÇÖs warm tones gaining clout alongside rollicking guitars and one of the bandΓÇÖs most fully upbeat tracks to date. The pop-ridden ΓÇÿA Little BiblicalΓÇÖ, meanwhile, is like a countryfied Beach Boys, while the sun-drenched ΓÇÿElectric MusicΓÇÖ makes for a modern take on the EaglesΓÇÖ ΓÇÿTake It EasyΓÇÖ.

There are still enough highlights within its more classic Band Of Horses moments (the ridiculously Neil Young-y ΓÇÿDumpster WorldΓÇÖ, or ΓÇÿSlow Cruel Hands Of TimeΓÇÖ and its plaintive, perfect vocals) to ensure thereΓÇÖs no risk of the band doing a Kings Of Leon. But ΓÇÿMirage RockΓÇÖ could and should be the LP that at least bumps them a good few places higher up next yearΓÇÖs festival bills.
