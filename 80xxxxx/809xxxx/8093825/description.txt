Description :

Allows anyone with Grand Theft Auto Vice City for android to enter cheats into the game. Opens up the keyboard in game and displays a list of cheats available. No need for a physical keyboard anymore, everyone can cheat.

Please read the troubleshooting or contact me before posting a 1* review. Half these comment are covered in the troubleshooting. Especially the people with the Galaxy Note, troubleshooting clearly tells you to download a specific keyboard if the cheats donΓÇÖt do anything.
