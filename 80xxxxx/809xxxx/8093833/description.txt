Well, I had heard a few RAC remixes before, and then I was intrigued by the RAC remix of Rescue Song on the Celeste and Jesse Forever Soundtrack.

I got frustrated because I could not find a collection of RAC remixes together. So I made one. I downloaded a bunch of RAC remixes I found around the net. I cant be given credit for ripping, but I hope you enjoy the capability of getting a bunch of the songs in one spot!

The songs included in this torrent are:

Foster the people - houdini
Pheonix - armistice
Fun. - walking the dog
Gigamesh - when you're dancing 
holy Ghost! - Static on the wire
Katie Herzig - free my mind
Lana Del Rey - Blue Jeans
Sunday Girl - Love U more
The Temper Trap - Sweet Disposition
Thomas Tantrum - Sleep
Tokyo Police Club - Wait up (boots of Danger)
Two Door Cinema - Something Good Can Work
The Gossip - Heavy Cross
Mr. Little Jeans - Rescue song

If any of these songs aren't *actually* RAC Remixes, dont give me hell, I just did what i could. 

Enjoy and seed!
