,Proteus11,2013-02-02T08:59Z,"Some interesting stuff in here, definitely... but a magnet link, so I can´t pick and choose... and a 14,79 Gb torrent?

Is there any way around this that I just haven´t found?"
,Ahlat,2013-02-02T09:41Z,"Proteus11 if you use bittorrent you will have to wait a bit for it to load and then it would be available for you to choose what you want. I'm sure you can do the same on utorrent, though I'm not sure. Also once it's started downloading you can always unselect the ones you don't want."
,tedsclai,2013-02-02T10:24Z,"Yes you can do that with uTorrent. Once it loads metadata you can go to the bottom and right-click on files and select the ones you do not want to download. Awesome torrent STFmaryville. I have a question, have you or anyone read The Judas Coin from DC Comics? Wondering if it's worth buying or not."
,Proteus11,2013-02-02T14:15Z,"Ahlat, tedsclai - thank you very much for the tip! I´ll just start to pick and choose from this beauty."
,Hamster-X,2013-02-02T15:08Z,Amazing as always!!!! Thanks a million!

darthmung, Hamster-X you're welcome.

Thanks for the tech support, guys. LOL. Just for the record, TPB automatically converts to ""magnet only"" once there are enough seeders.

tedsclai, I haven't read Judas Coin but I read the reviews on Amazon. It sounds like a good GN if you're the kind of reader who likes an old Sgt. Rock or Jonah Hex comic ... the negative reviewers mostly whine ""there's not enough Batman in this."" The fact that Simonson, at age 65 (now 66) wrote, pencilled, inked, colored and lettered a GN about gladiators, vikings, pirates, cowboys, super-heroes, and sci-fi, should be enough to make **true fans of the art of comic books** proud that there's still opportunity at DC for him to do what he loves. Now I'll step down off my soapbox and just say, when I have an extra $20 I'll buy it."
,Doc_T,2013-02-02T17:36Z,This is an excellent upload.  Thank you!
,bushman617,2013-02-09T00:36Z,"Proteus11, you can also use http://magnet2torrent.me/ to convert the magnet link to a torrent file."

[V],STFmaryville,2013-02-18T14:49Z,you're welcome Doc_T and 00sweeney
,muckymucks,2013-03-07T03:32Z,"You guys can pick and choose with a magnet link. I use utorrent. When I click a magnet link I wait for the meta data to load. It might take a minute, maybe a little more, but it does load with all the files. Then you can pick and choose what you want."
,BatDingler,2013-03-10T18:57Z,thanks dude
