Try the smartest lock screen for Android !

LockerPro allows you to check your notifications without unlocking your device. 

LockerPro monitors notifications coming from any app on your device, and displays them as banners on your lock screen. You can easily swipe them away by swiping them to the left, or launch the notification by swiping to the right.

When your device is unlocked LockerPro provides banner notifications in the top of your screen even when running fullscreen apps so that you don't miss them.

LockerPro also provides a shortcut panel and music playback control. Simply swipe the clock to the right to access the shortcut panel, and to the left to access music playback control.

Contact picture, custom ringtone, quick reply for SMS, direct callback for missed calls, various clock styles, and many other features are available.
