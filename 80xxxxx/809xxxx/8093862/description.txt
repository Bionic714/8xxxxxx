   ABBA: Bang a Boomerang tells the inside story of Australia's
 colossal 70s crush on the Swedish supergroup ABBA and 
 their music, and how this unequalled and enduring fan-worship
 changed them and us forever.ABC's innovative music
 program Countdown and its host Molly Meldrum were
 instrumental in bringing ABBA to a burgeoning mid-70s
 television audience looking for something different. It was 
 due to Countdown that Mamma Mia was released as a single,
 first in Australia and then the world, and the ABBA phenomenon
 was born. Viewers were going into record shops wanting to 
 buy the single. Molly rang RCA records asking about the 
 release of Mamma Mia and was told there were no plans to
 do so."We then played it again in defiance and they had no
 option but to release it... it was lucky, it went to number one,"
 Meldrum said.ABBA: Bang a Boomerang digs deep into 
 heartfelt memories, cardboard cartons of memorabilia, 
 face-to-face encounters, local pop icon recounts, lavish 
 personal and public ABBA museums and Australia's rich 
 media archives to relive a moment of collective national 
 'craziness', when we did literally go ABBA mad. The result
 is a warm, bright, captivating engagement with ABBA's 
 time Down Under that will remind us all of the band's 
 impact and how our open-hearted embrace of all things 
 ABBA would eventually define us. One in three Australian
 households owned an ABBA record - from Prime 
 Minister Fraser to eight year olds around the nation, 
 we were hooked even if some of us didn't want to admit
 it back then and we didn't realise the crush would be 
 for keeps.
