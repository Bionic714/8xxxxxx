the least v can do to help him is not circulate this 1 on the forums/net so dat folks go to the theatre n pay for wotchin it so dat he gets back his investment.

V need to sacrifice dis much for such a talented actor/producer/director"

,johnpaulmathew,2013-02-03T10:27Z,I really wanted to watch this movie at cinema and support Kamal but unfortunately its banned in UAE. But I really want to see this movie. What to do? Anyway I am not downloading this and really hope it will get released here very soon.
