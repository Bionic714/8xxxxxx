,Buxaroo,2013-02-02T06:53Z,Why just the overtime segment?
,North333,2013-02-02T07:08Z,"@ Buxaroo
My assumption is that OP has some screen-capture program and records Overtime as it airs online, uploading directly afterwords. (HBO has a tendency to go down on Friday nights right after Real Time airs, so this is useful)"
,Hellglory,2013-02-02T07:50Z,"Why the fuck does it take SO damn long to release the main show? Its fucking does 7pst/10east it tends to come up at muthafuckin 2am! Meanwhile the daily show is up 3 minutes after its over.  Ya Bill is on HBO but fuck, I'm about to order HBO again just so I can watch this one fucking show!"
,Hellglory,2013-02-02T07:59Z,Its fucking *done* I meant

Calm the fuck down, you angry little shit."
,abacus23,2013-02-02T08:19Z,"Real Time used to come out right after it aired.. But the scene rippers seem to go to bed early on friday nights now...  Or wait to upload it when they get home from the bar.

In the meantime, there will be 4 torrents OVERTIME uploaded  :("
,clockworkgirl21,2013-02-02T08:32Z,"I know it's irritating to have to wait, but be patient. We're getting it for free, after all."
,Hellglory,2013-02-02T08:49Z,"Kiss my ass you piece of shit, Heynow"
,jcdugger,2013-02-02T09:11Z,The wait for the main show is longer than John Holmes's dick!
,cmhenslin,2013-02-02T09:17Z,"Jeez Hellglory, stop being such a whiney little bitch and order HBO if you're so fucking impatient.  "
,Lonsman,2013-02-03T06:02Z,"Thanks for providing this, Anonymous!
Too bad there are a few idiots that don't appreciate the effort. Most of us do!!
Thanks again, mate!!"
,unison152,2013-02-05T04:26Z,"Some people are just whiny little bitches. Waahhh I  had to wait a little longer to watch the show.... First world problems huh. You're fucking pathetic.

Anyway, thanks for the work put into making this torrent available guys! Keep up the good work!"
