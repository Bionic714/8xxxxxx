Storyline: A story about a man who can't seem to do anything but win at the tables in Vegas. This, of course, brings hustlers out of the woodwork intent on using him for financial gain. One of them is the man's brother who, incidentally, is trying to find who it was that killed their father, while still another is a woman who has schemes of her own. Couple all of this with drug kingpins and general thugs and you have a comedy with a fresh twist on surviving in Vegas.
