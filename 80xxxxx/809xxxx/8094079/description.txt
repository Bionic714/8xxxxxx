 On the verge of retiring as Commissioner     
 of Police, Prakash Rathod, gets a            
 telephone call from a male who informs       
 him that he has placed several bombs         
 all over Mumbai, and unless and until        
 he arranges the release of four terrorists,  
 with Al Qaeda and Lashkar links, namely      
 Ibhrahim Khan, Ikhlaque Khan, Mohammad       
 Zaheer, and Khursheed Lala. This male        
 then warns Prakash that if his demands       
 are not carried out, the bombs will          
 explode, and one of them has been placed     
 right opposite the Commissioner's Colaba     
 office. It will be now up to Prakash and     
 the state's Chief Minister to either         
 adhere to this male's demands or face        
 the death of tens of thousands innocent      
 civilians.
