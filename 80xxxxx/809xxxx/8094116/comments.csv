,Arbiter89,2013-02-02T17:07Z,Does this version have a screamer during the first level like the other pirated versions?
,Mahoraba3,2013-02-02T17:21Z,"I'm running Window 64 Bit and I had no problem what so ever running this, I did however make sure to nab the crack that is not in this download that HeroMaster has made mention of in a previous comment, I'll re-link in case you did not get it and are having problems.

https://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=141999

Whatever the problem is that is causing it to crash after the Unreal logo, isn't due to Window 64 Bit, one user says that simply updating is drivers fixed it for him, could be as simple as that."
,Mahoraba3,2013-02-02T17:24Z,"@Arbiter89, Thus far I have not heard any ""Screamer"" but this is the only pirated version i've found so I'm unsure of what you mean by Screamer, if its some one screaming in the first level, no that's not in this one."

Everybody, please refer to the 1st set of comments if you are facing any issues. Might need to use some very basic lateral thinking to figure it out. :)"

Theres no screamers either"
,moeburn1,2013-02-04T00:59Z,"I'm sad, and not suprised, that this game is on the pirate bay.  If there's anyone here who can afford it, this is one of those rare games that you should pay for.  

If anything, at least try it first to see if you'll like it (you will) and then donate the author whatever change you can spare (he takes donations).  It's just that good."

I have win64 btw... so sorry to bother, but im just stuck here, someone help? :("
,PidgeonGrape,2013-02-04T04:59Z,"I have the crack that was posted in a comment.

,moeburn1,2013-02-04T14:15Z,"@autastic; it's the door labelled ""exit"" on one of the four walls in the main menu.

@pidgeongrape that error is usually the result of your DirectX not being up to date, try updating directx from microsoft's end-user runtime installer."

,moeburn1,2013-02-04T14:48Z,@Rikeus the time limit was only present in the screener version of the game given to reviewers; perhaps that is what the crack is for?
,moeburn1,2013-02-04T14:51Z,"everyone who is saying they fixed the crash did so with nvidia drivers... but I'm using an ATI card! (HD 5770), with the newest 13.1 drivers!"
,moeburn1,2013-02-04T15:03Z,"okay I got it working, apparently those are drivers for nvidia PhysX and work just fine on an AMD card.

@Rikeus, ignore the time limit.  You can keep playing the game when it runs out.  Nobody's quite sure what it is there for, but it is definitely not the same ""game-ending"" time limit that was there in the screener version."
,autastic,2013-02-04T19:39Z,"""Live by your own clock, not someone else's."""
,autastic,2013-02-04T19:42Z,"Addressing comments about this game from earlier, I don't think a single bit of the game is broken due to piracy. No screamers, I've been able to solve the puzzles, the advice panels work and everything.

And run as admin if you have it in a place where it's necessary, otherwise game will not save."

Why is the install file a .vdf file?
What opens a .vdf?

I can't even extract this game because my computer doesn't recognize the filetype of the install program. It's a Valve Data File, I get it, but still don't know how to open one.

Log: === Critical error: ===
Fatal error!

It is said that game shall be saved automatically, but it did not for me."
