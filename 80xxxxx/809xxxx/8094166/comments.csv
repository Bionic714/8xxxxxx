,macharla,2013-05-30T03:45Z,IDM is asking to update to newer version. Can I update are keep satisfied with what I got?
,macharla,2013-05-31T13:57Z,It should not be upgraded... And This works perfectly well. Now I can even download a movie from youtube without any worry of connection breaking and have to start from the beginning. IDM takes care like utorrent. It starts from where it left. And the speed acceleration is fantastic. Once again thanks.
