The need to analyse a linear network is a recurring requirement in computer-aided network analysis. Not only are the majority of the network problems to be solved linear problems, but non-linear resistive and dynamic networks are usually solved by the analysis of a sequence of 'linearised' networks. The analysis of such networks can commonly be viewed as a two-stage process: equation formulation and linear solution. This book discusses an attractive formulation procedure that will not only change the solution strategy, but also the view of matrix reduction techniques.
