,56453ryt,2013-02-03T00:23Z,"This movie so much reminds me of my own personal experience growing up with my Grandfather who was a survivor of the bataan death march during WWII.

War can be hell for those that go through it and back then society didn't have a mechanism to cope with the survivors who were battle scarred during the war they survived.

Today at least returning military vetrans can become police officers and inflict their rage on a civilian population which most often have lower IQ's than the general population.

Whenever I hear of a LEO beating up a housewife or unemployed idiot I at least know Grandpa didn't have this outlet available to him.

[T],crwildman,2013-02-03T01:14Z,"Its a Drama. 

Great quality tho, A/V 9

This is a tough movie to sit through.
If you like waiting and waiting for the story line to pick up, then it not, this is for you.   I do not recommend this if you are into any kind of action or adventure films, you will be disappointing.  (But what could one expect from a Drama, except a bunch of boring Drama).  To each his own.  

Thanks for the upload scene4all."

,tomyogando,2013-02-03T01:50Z,"AWESOME! THANKS!    Now somebody should post SPANISH SUBTITLES, I know they're out there.  I already got english subtitles and they work perfectly.

Also, I hear the extras of this movie are pretty good, can you post them as a separate torrent?  There are a ton of deleted scenes and a behind the scenes featurette too.   

I hope I'm not asking for too much. Thanks in advance."

,RexRexroth,2013-02-03T11:43Z,"After ""There Will Be Blood,"" I was really looking forward to this, but it's just a huge, overblown, self-righteous steaming pile of horseshit.  It just wallows in its own self-importance.

Forget linear plot - there is none (not that that is essential). It's just badly written and goes on far, far too long, and the egregiously overrated tub of lard known as Philip Seymour Hoffman totally drags is it down by never letting us, for one second, forget that he is ACTING.  Joachim Phoenix is great, but spends huge swaths of time just looking confused.  And that's it: basically a two character film that could stand to be an hour shorter. By the way, the A/V quality is superb, especially if you have a good 5.1 audio system.

And to ""1batty boy,"" I have to ask why you feel to post numerous times that the film is long and boring - which it is - ""UNLESS you are gay?""  What the fuck does that have to do with anything?  I happy to be gay and I hated every second if it (""Argo"" and ""Moonrise Kingdom"" were my favorite films this year).  Maybe you have some issues you need to work out..  Until you get out of therapy, maybe you should keep from posting your hate speech on this board."
,salazam1,2013-02-03T11:47Z,this movie looks pretentious and stupid. I trust you guys more than the fags on imdb. Is it what I think it is or is it actually worth watching?

,56453ryt,2013-02-04T05:33Z,"I didn't mean to offend you officer tverlaine. I have a wife and family i must provide for and although tinted windows is a serious offense by arresting me you only burden my children with thousands in unnecessary debt removed from a household in which we are trying our best but it is difficult becase I could never understand my teachers very well. It unfair to fund your own highway robbery department and take from my children what I've yet been able to provide for tem.

Perfect solution, my Grandpa was treated as an outcast due to WWII, today with the laws in effect he could have been a hero."
,56453ryt,2013-02-04T05:40Z,"Remember this when you meet Officer Dirt-shield, Ask a simple question so he can inflect serious injury, bogus criminal charges, and financial damages and know you're helping a demented vet overcome so much. A US vet does not have to become a migrant farm worker anymore, just let him subject you to a beating and a few years in jail.

,eXindigo,2013-02-07T00:10Z,"t/his movie is fantastic. I give it a 4/4. J. Phoenix dies a great character role against a somewhat wooden cast. The similarities to L. Ron Hubbard are unmistakable. Little known is that he studied under Korzbibsky along with Robert Heinlein and S.I. HIAKAWA and a bunch of other luminaries. So many references to points in Hubbard's life that if  unintended would be highly suspicious.
