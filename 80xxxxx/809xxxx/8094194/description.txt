Notes: Movie is 138 minutes long. Went with 2 gigs, which allowed for relatively
high bitrate, as well as untouched audio(aside from tweaking delay). The Blu Ray
is in possession as well, but it was giving me shit, so I thought I'd get this
out, and work on it, if nobody else has their hands on it yet. Enjoy this for
now, or don't.
