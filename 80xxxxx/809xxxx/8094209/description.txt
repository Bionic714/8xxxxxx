A collection of simple-to-make aerial classics: 37 in all, with to easy-to-follow directions and close-up step-by-step photographs and plans. Choose from the lighter-than-air L'Entreprenant balloon, the F-100 Supersabre, the Wright Flyer from the dawn of flight, the Sopwith Camel or Fokker Triplane from World War 1, the German Stuka Dive-bomber, P-38 Lightning or classic B-17 Flying Fortress from World War 2 - and a whole host of others.
This is a great starting point for those of us who want more detail but can't find plans to even get started. And if you are the type of person who likes to take the model one step further than the plans this is the book for you. Or if you are happy with a simple non-micro detail unit this is again the right book and the models are nice displayable models. Remember this is not a kit and so you need to come up with your own decals, wheels and other finishing items.
