"Effigy" resumes right where it left off--with Batman none too pleased over the uninvited Batcave appearance of Detective John Johns. But John--aka the Martian Manhunter--is the only one who can help the Dark Knight solve the mystery of the killer roaming under Gotham. The two heroes are going to have to join forces to take down the deadly White Martian.
