,hollisb,2013-02-02T10:02Z,"Holy shit, you're on a roll, HeroMaster. Thank you!"
,Friendlyx,2013-02-02T13:37Z,Thank you so much!
,demmydemon,2013-02-02T18:49Z,"Not working for me, but the crash seems to be somewhere in XNA, placing the blame squarely on my system and not the torrent/crack.

At least that's my current theory.

Anyone else getting the ""Start Retrovirus.exe, nothing happens"" problem?  I discovered it's actually compiling a crash report where I found the XNA-related issues I'm currently poking at.

If anyone else has similar issues, perhaps we can figure it out?  If this is fixed in the patch I just might buy this blindly rather than downloading first to try out...  Looks so cool!"
,demmydemon,2013-02-02T20:01Z,"Fixed it, but not sure what did it:
- Changed display device
- Updated .NetFX
- Disabled error reporting

(Ordered from most to least likely to be the fix)"

NO PROBLEMS ON INSTALL OR PLAY.

The default display device was set to my secondary monitor ... be sure to run RetrovirusLauncher.exe and set your display to your primary.

If you are running Windows 7 (32 or 64) you do not need to manually install XMA framework as it is inclusive to the OS.

If you are running an earlier version of windows, you need to download and install this:

again - once doing that you should make sure your settings are properly configured.

Good Luck!"

,Sabre_of_Pain,2013-02-21T00:04Z,"Installed microsoft XNA 4.0 and the game started working, it's included with the game in the folder C:Program Files (x86)SteamsteamappscommonRetrovirusRedistributables"
