Thank you @gatasalvaje for sharing this in FLAC!"

It's so cool to get the Japanese versions of all of these releases in FLAC, since you can't get most of these bonus tracks here in the US. The artwork is cool too, and the fact that you included both the standard and tour edition of MTM is awesome. Thanks for this"
