Little console app that I wrote in C# to lookup damage/resistance of pokémon/type.
Original (disgusting) code is included and free to edit under CC.
All stats and names of pokémon are taken from bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net

Commands:

help - shows help
types - lists all types
pokemon - lists all pokémon
clear - clears console
"type" - shows damage stats for particular type
"type"/"type" - shows damage stats for particular primary and secondary type
"pokémon name" - shows damage stats for its type-s. All variations are listed eg. Rotom
* - modifier, insert after type/name (eg. bulbsaur*) to show weaknesses
