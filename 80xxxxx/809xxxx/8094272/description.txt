Prager 20130201  3 Open Lines

Prager H3: Dennis and Allen open the hour with a honey update, a dialogue about their honey adventure in Ecuador
 a few weeks ago...
Then, open lines. Issues raised include: should you raise your child with the same rules you raise your pets;
 should women be in combat.


Prager 20130201  2 Happiness Hour: Everybody Has Pain

Prager H2: Dennis returns to one of his foundational happiness themes. Forty-five minutes after the hour a man 
 thanks Dennis for stopping him from taking his life. It happened years ago. And now, near the end of his life,
 he wants to acknowledge the debt.


Prager 20130201  1 Hagel Hearings

Prager H1: The media admits that Defense Department nominee Chuck Hagel didnΓÇÖt have a good day yesterday 
 at his Senate Confirmation hearings. But was it a ''bad day'' or is Hagel is poorly qualified for the job?
 Or, to put it another way, why did the President nominate him?
