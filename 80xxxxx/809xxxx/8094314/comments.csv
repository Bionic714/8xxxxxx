Don't want to rain on your parade or say anything untoward about your guy, but his whole ""you can't catch cold by being cold"" only makes sense in the most superficial context. While technically true within narrow bounds, it is a reckless statement in the extreme.

There is a serious causal link between being cold and cathing cold - and you have to seriously mislead the discussion just to merely appear to make his point.

The human body runs on a finite amount of energy and allocating some resources while husbanding the rest is essential to avoid catching cold. We live in a veritable soup of germs and nasty virii. Continually invading fungi and microbes are a constant battle from the day you are conceived until the day you finally succumb to the neverending onslaught. of invading parasites. Every bit of energy you can preserve to fight the invaders back from invading the tiniest cracks in your skin is not just the less colds you will catch,but will also reduce the severity of each instance of inevitable illness you WILL incur.

I got the distinct impression that Stossel would have you dancing naked in the snow oblivious to the energy needs your body has to fight the cold that will now successfully attack if you divert too much of your body's energy from necessary perimeter defense to just maintaining your body's core temperature. The more energy it takes to keep you warm is that much less energy to keep up the fight against infection by cold germs.

Jes' Sayin' - you CAN catch cold from being cold. your mother was right and Stossel is dangerously wrong.

Now this may be an unfair personal observation, but Stossel has always struck me as being the poor man's 'Geraldo Rivera', of whom I really only respect his early anti-nuthouse crousade. He was correct in saying ""let's get these poor unfortunates out from behind locked asylum walls - but he never took ""step two"" and went chasing empty vaults for the fame instead.

The only people that can make this country better are people such as Gary Johnson, Ralph Nader, Ross Perot and Ron Paul or Rand Paul, maybe even Jesse Ventura in 2016. If you are the type of person that thinks you catch a cold by being cold then no amount of evidence I give you that will change your mind. I hope you are atheist, cause that will be a good starting point."
,S.Knight,2013-03-02T08:32Z,"Some evidence suggests that being subjected to cold winter weather (PROLONGED) may result in greater susceptibility to viral infection. This might happen due to changes in the respiratory system and or decreased immune response… Also, a few viruses that cause common colds are seasonal; and may in fact be more widespread during wither months. 
But, the main point is this. The state of being cold does not cause one to become infected with a cold-causing virus. And, the evidence for cold-induced immunosuppression is debated and thin. 
Your explanation regarding “energy” seemed non-scientific. The body’s energy is glucose by way of ATP and other like molecules GTP, etcetera. The biochemical process diverted to maintaining body temperature and general homoeostasis are not going to effectively reduce ones immune system causing some awaiting previously contacted virus to “attack” and succeed. 
So I would ultimately reverse you original statement by saying that the idea that being cold will make you catch “only makes sense in the most superficial context. While technically true within narrow bounds, it is a reckless statement in the extreme.”
It is far less likely that temperature would be the greater impacting cause for one catching a cold, but rather the increased contact with cold-causing viruses."
