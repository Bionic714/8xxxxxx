,chelios141,2013-02-03T04:01Z,digimike50: My friend there is no file with registration instructions.
,digimike50,2013-02-03T12:13Z,"chelios141 : Um, I'm confused, because my friend, there is. If you click on ''Files : 2'' (on the 2) up at the top you get this: writeitnow407f.exe	32.57 MiB
WriteItNow! 4.0.7f Complete.txt	956 B
Thereby describing the two files - the .txt files containing the registration details. As always, I downloaded the torrent (to check) and the content is fine. If you are still having problems, go to the original Torrent (details above) where o2ugla spells out the details. HTH. Cheers ..."
,chelios141,2013-02-04T01:42Z,Ok buddy sorry I'm just getting old I found it. Thanks a lot.

,Hatterasman,2013-03-05T06:27Z,"There is indeed a text file with this torrent, however, as the other person wrote, there are no registration keys in the text file. The keys from o2ugla do not work! The torrent is worthless without working keys."
,balanshade,2013-04-23T04:06Z,"It is true there is no key in the txt file but you can find it here:

Look for the last comment by o2gulo, he wrote it there.

Now, I tried the key in a computer with no internet connection and it failed every time, but when I copied the key directly from the page in a computer with internet connection it worked like magic.

So my best guess is that you require to be connected in order to complete the unlocking process. Maybe the software creators have a database with the number of times a key has been used, you know for piracy issues."
