Dream Girl has a vision of Validus attacking the Legion of Super-Heroes and it comes true. The Legionnaires realize that, even though Tharok (Validus' controller) is incarcerated and under sedation, his electronic brain still functions to control Validus. Invisible Kid realizes that is the case and goes to destroy the electronic brain that is controlling Validus, but not before Validus kills him. The Legion find small solace in the fact that Invisible Kid is now with the woman he loves, Myla, a dead spirit.
