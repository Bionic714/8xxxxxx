,.Leto.,2013-02-03T12:47Z,"There's a framerate problem, picture is really jerky. And it's not my player, I tried with all of them. It's not just this source, I tried another one and it's jerky as well. And I've downloaded an episode #2, jerky again."
,.Leto.,2013-02-03T18:28Z,really strange that no one else seems to be complaining about tha problem...

That's because of the method those rips are made: they are not downloaded, but captured from video player (it's easier).

There are tons of exact reasons of why they are jerky, but for me it looks like Flash's problem. Ever noticed how Flash-based video players are starting lagging after downloading (pre-caching) the whole video and eat up your CPU, causing ""lags"", or even full freezes?"
,.Leto.,2013-02-04T11:20Z,"@ nutbask: Thanks for the explanation, I thought there was something wrong with my computer."
,zapeterset,2013-02-05T01:11Z,"Low Quality Video.
Lots of artifacts, laggy...

I hope sombody will get a PROPER vesion soon if that is possible.

Thanks to the uploader anyway, I guess it´s good enough for a lot of people! :)"
,ZombieLionelHutz,2013-02-06T08:34Z,"I got the 30 day Netflix trial to check this show out and there's macroblocking and screen tearing on HD... I'm sure they appear in the rip as well (haven't downloaded this).

Just thought I'd clear that up"
,Hancock79,2013-03-07T05:50Z,"yea I hate streaming shit on Netflix, webrips as well.  Show sounded too good for me to wait around for possible DVD or bluray though."
