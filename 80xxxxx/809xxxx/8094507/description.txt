[size=4][color=orange]In Rich Dad Poor Dad, Robert Kiyosaki goes back to his childhood in Hawaii to explain his philosophy on wealth creation and being successful. The book is written in a very conversational manner and most of the snippets are based on the authorΓÇÖs budding years and his experiences regarding money management.[/color][/size] 

[size=4][color=tomato]There were two main influences in Robert KiyosakiΓÇÖs life. The first was his real father, an educator who worked hard for a fixed income all his life. HeΓÇÖs the ΓÇÿPoor DadΓÇÖ. The Rich Dad is his biological fatherΓÇÖs best friend. A real estate tycoon, he is portrayed as highly successful and assumes the tag of being the ΓÇÿRich DadΓÇÖ.[/color][/size]

[size=4][color=turquoise]In the book, the author claims that his rich dad amassed wealth because he looked at income as a way to develop more wealth-creating assets. This attitude, the author states time and again, is the primary difference between the rich and the poor. His biological father on the other hand, spent his income on buying consumer goods that would give him and his family satisfaction. Kiyosaki singles this out as the reason why his ΓÇÿPoor DadΓÇÖ was never financially independent or secure.[/color][/size]

[size=4][color=violet]Does hardwork really matter?

Or is wealth just the by-product of making the right financial decisions?

Robert Kiyosaki throws light on the above questions through a series of six easy to learn lessons. He constantly provides real life instances so that readers can relate to his lessons on buying income generating assets. Kiyosaki has written this book in collaboration with Sharon Lechter.

Rich Dad Poor Dad was number one on The New York Times paperback ΓÇÿadviceΓÇÖ chart. It remained on this list for almost 100 weeks. Robert Kiyosaki wrote several other books after the success of Rich Dad Poor Dad and even released Rich Dad CDs.[/color][/size]
