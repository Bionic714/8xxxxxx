Desertico is the new album by Paolo Fresu Devil Quartet (Paolo Fresu trumpet, flugelhorn, multi effects; Bebo Ferra electric and acoustic guitars; Paolino Dalla Porta contrabass; Stefano Bagnoli drums).
Together they create an album destined to last. Work full of emotions, sweat and soul; Devil Quartet pushes its music in the vast desert of today sounds, without distinction of genres, with strength and a subtle poetry that permeates the entire album. Don't miss them live.
