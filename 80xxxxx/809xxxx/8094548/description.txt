I have scoured the net deeply through many blogs, sites and torrents to collect these. A nearly complete collection of Rock N Roll Comics. This is as good as it gets right now, but as new scans appear, this torrent will be updated! As you can see below, we are only missing 15 issues to make a complete run of 65. This torrent includes the recently scanned "New Kids On The Block" issue. Any help completing this hard to find run is super appreciated. R.I.P. Todd Loren, publisher of Rock N Roll Comics!
