Rachael Ray and Guy Fieri meet the eight celebrity contestants as they prepare to pick their teams. The competition begins as both teams must cook a prix fixe tasting menu at a Los Angeles dinner theater, as well as perform a three minute skit for one hundred theater goers, including Rachael and Guy, and special guest judges, including writers from Entertainment Weekly. The judges and dinner guests will vote on the dishes, leaving the bottom two celebrities to compete in a sudden death challenge. At the end of the day, one celebrity is eliminated from the competition.
