A-9
V-9
M- not worthy of a rating, there isn't a number small enough.  I'd rather watch The Crow 2, or Even Cowgirls Get the Blues for the rest of my life than ever try to sit through this garbage one more time."
,STARcruze,2013-02-03T20:27Z,hey can u upload triggers tv show plz
,hazardose,2013-02-03T21:02Z,"English subtitles: http://subscene.com/subtitles/the-master/english/684168

Comment: the text comes ~1 sec sooner than expected, so you may add +1 sec to the starting time of all lines of text (for example with a subtitle editor software)

Enjoy a gr8 performance by Joaquin Phoenix! :)"
,hxxq,2013-02-04T15:32Z,"@Minty_Winty: Well i have some nice movie suggestions for u.. how about u watch these movies that have short juicy donkey balls.

Due to advancement of camera technology, lot of film makers who wanna be a director film B- Movies, i mean they are like YOU ! They dont have enough money so they start with medicore script, cheap effects & create a horror movie.. which ultimately ends up on dvd. or in TPB...

FUCK U.. ! this is a Paul Thomas Anderson movie.. nothing wrong in this film.. i seen all his films... 

u better do a harcore sexy B-Movie, u can buy a high end HD cam, an apple computer.. couple whores u can get on street.. good luck
