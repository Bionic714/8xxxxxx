Yasmine "The Lightening Bolt" Loven is on a good Winning Streak. She had a really impressive match against Sara Jay earlier in this season and she wants to see if Lightening can strike twice to get her a back to back win. Mistress Kara is the rookie who's been mopping the floor with high ranking rookies and vets alike. She's been impressive and shows us why she's known as "The Queen". Yasmine Loven gets no lov'in from the Queen however. Mistress Kara is relentless on the mats and dominates her fellow welterweight with easy and grace.
