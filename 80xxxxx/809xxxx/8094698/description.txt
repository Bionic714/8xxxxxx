A New York Times Bestseller
Foreword by Stephen J. Dubner, coauthor of Freakonomics

When first-year graduate student Sudhir Venkatesh walked into an abandoned building 

in one of ChicagoΓÇÖs most notorious housing projects, he hoped to find a few people 

willing to take a multiple-choice survey on urban poverty--and impress his professors 

with his boldness. He never imagined that as a result of this assignment he would 

befriend a gang leader named JT and spend the better part of a decade embedded inside 

the projects under JTΓÇÖs protection. From a privileged position of unprecedented 

access, Venkatesh observed JT and the rest of his gang as they operated their crack-

selling business, made peace with their neighbors, evaded the law, and rose up or 

fell within the ranks of the gangΓÇÖs complex hierarchical structure. Examining the 

morally ambiguous, highly intricate, and often corrupt struggle to survive in an 

urban war zone, Gang Leader for a Day also tells the story of the complicated 

friendship that develops between Venkatesh and JT--two young and ambitious men a 

universe apart.
