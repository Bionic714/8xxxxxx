Drugs Inc: Designer Drugs
Drugs: A multi-billion-dollar industry that fuels crime and violence like no other substance on the planet. Turning cartel leaders into billionaires, the illegal drug industry also provides vital income to hundreds of thousands of poor workers across the globe. While some users sacrifice their lives to an addiction they can't escape, others find drugs to be their only saving grace from physical or emotional pain almost impossible to overcome. Where should the lines be drawn in this lucrative industry?
Designer drugs are the new battleground in the global war on narcotics. For a few dollars, users can access dozens of compounds that mimic cocaine, ecstasy or marijuana. Sold as Bath Salts or Spice, these drugs are entirely legal.
