Custom firmware kit for PS3.  http://www.tortuga-cove.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=127&t=4336

Included:
* Rogero CFW 4.30 v2.05
* Rogero CFW 3.55 v3.7A
* Rogero downgrader (4.25 to 3.55)
Use this if you want to go from 4.30 back to 3.55. Even though it says it's for 4.21, it does work for Rogero 4.30.
* toggle_qa
Only for 3.55 CFW. Install and run this ONLKY a console that hasn't previously had toggle_qa run on it. It helps if you want to downgrade later.
* Condor Updater 3.1
Makes it easier to get in to Recovery Mode.
