  It so happens that the moment they meet    
  their life takes an unusual turn.          
  As they walk towards their first class in  
  college, they are on their way to share    
  their lives with each other for the next   
  three years. Vani generates a calmness     
  and control in Akaash that he never had and
  Akaash gives Vani a streak of rebellion    
  she could never think of possessing within 
  herself. And then it happens, for no reason
  except for the fact that they complete each
  other, they fall in love. In three years,  
  Akaash & Vani become companions not only in
  the important things of life but also in th
  irrational parts of each other's life.
