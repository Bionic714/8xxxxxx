Milli Vanilli - The US Remix Album All Or Nothing (1990)


Milli Vanilli was a pop and dance project created by Frank Farian 
in Munich, Germany, in 1988. The group was formed with Fab Morvan 
and Rob Pilatus. The group's debut album Girl You Know It's True 
achieved international success and earned them a Grammy Award for 
Best New Artist on February 21, 1990.[1] Milli Vanilli became one 
of the most popular pop acts in the late 1980s and early 1990s. 
However, their success turned to infamy when their Grammy was 
revoked after it was revealed by Chuck Philips of the LA Times 
that the lead vocals on the record were not the actual voices of 
Morvan and Pilatus.
