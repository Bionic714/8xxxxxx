,mosticktheglowstick,2013-02-06T13:39Z,please seed thanks. nice :)
,osriccc,2013-02-09T18:37Z,What's the source? Direct Blu-ray? Why is episode 4 a RERIP... does the quality have any difference when compared to the other 9 episodes? Please comment files and quality who downloaded.
,mike953100,2013-02-09T19:51Z,Source is of course BluRay.  Episode 4 is a ReRip because the original rip of Episode 4 probably had some audio/video issues.  There is no difference in quality.
,Theblacks,2013-02-18T07:23Z,"The print is flawless A-9 V-9, all episodes are playing perfect, thx BOXZ. Download is pretty slow due to less seeds, I'll seed for a week at full speed. Hope everyone shares the love.

@osriccc .. There is no issue with episode 4. All 10 episodes have the same quality. Cheers"
,osriccc,2013-02-19T05:01Z,"Okay, then downloading and seeding for you. I'll comment myself once I watched the whole thing."
,snorsic,2013-02-27T20:46Z,Last file is way too big and the foriegn speaking parts are not hard subs. This cannot be true Blu ray. Sure you can turn on the subs but it is a bit annoying. Quality is ok. Disappointed with Boxz for the first time. I have the series with the hard coded foriegn subs and it's great. Sorry Boxz but this is my honest review after downloading such a big file and it didn't live up to it's description!
,snorsic,2013-02-27T20:55Z,Last episode is way too big. Foriegn speaking parts not hard coded subs. I have this with the hard coded subs...I was disappointed with that for such a big file. This is not Blu ray. However quality is good except the last episode. Very disapionted with Boxz for the first time.
,osriccc,2013-03-07T19:00Z,"snorsic, asking for hardsubs on any video is like asking for a fly in your soup or a foreign dick inside of your gf."

,leo_her1978,2013-04-18T06:12Z,Gracias por el aporte... yo los descargo para agragarle el audio latino y me quedan con dual audio.
