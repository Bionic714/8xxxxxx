Criticism of the Western Civilization - Collection 27 (Cults and New Religions):

The disarray of Christianity in the West has created a fertile ground for the growth of large number of cults and new religions. Some of these cults were violent and deadly to their followers or to others. The PeopleΓÇÖs Temple, for example, ordered 918 of its followers to commit suicide in Jonestown; the number included 276 children. 

The Branch Davidians sect had a confrontation with the FBI that resulted in the death of 85 of its members including its leader, David Koresh, along with 28 children. The Charles Manson (Manson Family) cult committed a series of gruesome murders and torture of its victims.
