It was the third straight victory for the Celtics (23-23), all coming without Rajon Rondo who will miss the season with a torn ACL. Stifling defense and balanced scoring was the formula again for Boston's success against the Magic (14-32), as Jeff Green led all scorers with 17 points off the bench. Six Celtics players finished in double figures overall. J.J. Redick had a team-high 15 points for Orlando. The shorthanded Magic have now dropped eight consecutive games"

,jmbsc,2013-02-03T14:32Z,"Dear Nepotu,
Long time no speak - hope you are very well... Still not back on the web but i do keep an eye on your amazing work - you're the number one obviously... Once i will get my internet back on line, i do hope that the idiots giving away the summary and the results from the game will vanish and disappear.... They are just a bunch of imbeciles.... and definitely they don't like sports.... just here to annoy us....
Nepotu, you keep well and take care of yourself..."
