Is it similar to the way some movies are on iTunes or OnDemand before or during its theatrical run here in the US?"

,vivatpb5776,2013-04-28T12:57Z,"I concur with what furyanno and mpenn20 stated. In addition, the video quality is piss poor. It appears as though the color is faded worse than old denim jeans. Also, there is a watermark in the upper right hand corner of the movie. This lasts throughout the movie.

For those that care, here is the mediainfo. Note, this is a 2-channel release:
