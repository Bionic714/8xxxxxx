,seevee1969,2013-02-02T22:21Z,Audio out of synch
[T],SCSA420,2013-02-03T01:05Z,Nothing is wrong with the damn sound here. The sound is in DOLBY DIGITAL AC3 5.1 SURROUND SOUND not AAC 2 channel stereo like I was doing them in Episodes 01-14. Last weeks Episode 15 and this weeks episode 16 are AC3 5.1 surround audio not 2.0 stereo so they may not work on Xbox 360 but the AC3 5.1 audio is better quality then AAC 2.0.  If you want this episode with 2 channel stereo audio the 1080p version has Dual Audio tracks both AC3 5.1 and AAC 2.0 audio
