,rockpile,2013-02-10T22:54Z,This is NOT the Beatles.  Doesn't even really sound that much like them.  Don't be fooled.  This is some new band trying to get you to download their stuff by lying about it.
,johnny-castle,2013-02-11T03:03Z,"Please read the description before making assumptions.  These are Beatles tracks performed by a Beatles tribute band.  The original 2-track recordings are of incredibly low quality and they're nearly impossible to find.  These songs are re-created from the originals.  Again, read the description for more detailed information.  The tracks were all written by Lennon/McCartney except track 3 which was written by George Harrison.  If you need more information you can read up on them at www.beatlesbible.com

Of course, any real Beatles fan would know all of this already."
