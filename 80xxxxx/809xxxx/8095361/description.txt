Good things flow from a strong core: a long lean torso, a healthy back, a positive flow of energy that benefits every aspect of your life. Now, one of the yoga worldΓÇÖs top female teachers shows you an enlightened way to a powerful core. Unlike repetitive conventional abs work, ShivaΓÇÖs fluid yoga-based approach awakens your creativity and inner fire, building strength and grace in the same way that surfing, rock climbing, or dancing doesΓÇöwhile youΓÇÖre enjoying yourself, not counting the minutes until itΓÇÖs over. The program includes three flowing segments, which can be done all at once or individually.

Filmed at White Sands National Park, the program was directed by James Wvinner and shot in HD by HollywoodΓÇÖs Sion Michel (Memoirs of a Geisha). Beautiful, effective, inspiring. ItΓÇÖs an abs workout youΓÇÖll look forward to doing again and again.
