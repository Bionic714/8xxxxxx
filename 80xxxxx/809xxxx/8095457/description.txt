PLOT: Frankenweenie is a 2012 3D stop motion fantasy family film directed by Tim Burton.[4] It is a remake of Burton's 1984 short film of the same name and is a parody of and a homage to the 1931 film Frankenstein based on Mary Shelley's book of the same name.
Like both those films, Frankenweenie is in black and white. It is also the fourth stop-motion film produced by Burton and the first of those four that isn't a musical. In the film, a boy named Victor loses his dog, named Sparky, and uses the power of science to resurrecthim.

After unexpectedly losing his beloved dog Sparky, young Victor hanesses the power of science to bring his best friend back to life - with just a few minor adjustments. He tries to hide his home-sewn creation, but when Sparky gets out, Victor's fellow students, teachers and the entire town learn that getting a new "leash on life" can be monstrous. Complete with electrifying bonus features, Frankenweenie is alive with enchanting fun for the whole family.
