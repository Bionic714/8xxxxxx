,lyell86,2013-02-08T01:58Z,Hi i have downloaded this torrent and used split4g and it will not work for me in multiman. I have the latest multiman.
,rishi82in,2013-02-09T04:02Z,"@lyell use ps3 slitter, i used it working fine for me"
,lyell86,2013-02-10T01:47Z,Are you on rogero 4.30 as well
,lyell86,2013-02-10T01:56Z,when i used ps3 splitter on it. It got to 99% install in multiman then said operation failed or cancelled. then splt4g freezes at 50%. How did you rip this thenoobish?
,lyell86,2013-02-10T01:59Z,hi when i use ps3splitter when installing to hdd cache is say operation failed or cancelled at 99%. Split4G makes it to 50% then stalls
,elto73,2013-02-10T19:38Z,"you can use filezilla or similar application to FTP transfer files above the 4Gb limit between a PC and the hard disk in your PS3.  With multiman you can enable your FTP and then transfer the data over your home network to the PS3.  Go to settings to discover your PS3's IP address.  FAT32 hard dives do not accept files above 4Gb.  This method works well every time although you need to know where you are going to move the data to.  Usually this is to the ...games... folder on you PS3 internal drive.  Hope this helps .  Otherwise you could try using an NTFS formatted external drive (windows only) and change to NTFS mode in your multiman settings, havent tried that way as I alwasy use FTP instead."
,lyell86,2013-02-14T00:48Z,Filezilla won't transfer the file it gets all the way to 85% then goes back to 40% what is it doing? I am about fed up with trying to get this game to work I really would like to play it though.
,lyell86,2013-02-14T02:28Z,The NTFS driver in multiman does not pick up my flash that i formatted to NTFS then copied game to.
,lyell86,2013-02-14T21:10Z,I figured it out thanks elto73 i used a 20gb xbox 360 drive formatted to ntfs it picked up in multiman and i tranferred the sly4.psarc to internal along with 3.55 fix. don't know why my filezilla keep a never ending loop hole transferring sly4.psarc though.
,lyell86,2013-02-14T21:17Z,thanks elto73 used your advice used a ntfs drive to tranfer sly4.psarc to internal.
,fulanus,2013-02-17T03:33Z,"hi and thanks to the uploader!
 I have last multiman and rogero 4.31. My system info shows 4.31, but this game says that I'm on 4.30 firmware. Is  Anybody else with the same problem ?
I used Ps3 splitter. Copied to the fat 32 drive,  and multiman  fixed the big file on  the internal.
I think I did all right. Anybody help?
My rogero is not the last, but the one  that was issued beore the last.
Thanks in advance."
,x3angel,2013-03-03T21:06Z,*Important* this game has 4GB+ files -if you have the space on your internal HDD fine - if not FTP game into your internal hd00/GAME folder then use Multiman to transfer it to your external HDD - Multiman will automatically split the 4GB file so that it can be played externally. Then you can delete the internal version of the Game. Play the game with a games disc inside using BD Mirror enabled/With Disc & test Permissions & it'll work
,Penkonio,2013-03-30T16:36Z,"I need help!

,Penkonio,2013-03-31T09:30Z,"@thenoobish Can I ask you something?

Should I update the firmware and will that mess my other games on my PS3 because I don't know is that firmware compatible with my MultiMan !?
