Ah Boys to Men (simplified Chinese: 新兵正传; traditional Chinese: 新兵正傳; pinyin: xīnbīng zhèngzhuàn) is a 2012–2013 Singaporean two-part comedy film produced and directed by Jack Neo, written by Neo and Link Sng and starring Wang Wei Liang, Tosh Zhang, Noah Yap, Joshua Tan and Maxi Lim. It revolves around a group of army recruits in National Service in Singapore.[3] The film consists of two cinematic parts, the first commercially released on November 8, 2012, and the second on February 1, 2013. In conjunction with the Ministry of Defence's 2012 NS45 campaign, From Fathers to Sons,[4] it is meant to commemorate the 45th anniversary of Singapore's National Service.[5] Ah Boys to Men is the first local film to be released in two parts and the first to film in Pulau Tekong.
Part one's box office revenue alone made it the highest-grossing Singaporean film of all time.
