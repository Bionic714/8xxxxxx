,beano311,2013-02-06T08:08Z,"Thanks for this. I purchased the Deluxe edition of The Afterman, which came out last year and included digital downloads of both albums, a copy of the Afterman: Ascension CD and a blank disc to burn the Afterman: Descension to when it was released. Of course, the ""high quality"" digital download they give you of the Afterman: Descension is a 320kbps MP3... wtf is up with that? They don't even give me a lossless copy with my $70 purchase."
