,toupoutou,2013-04-04T22:06Z,awesome ! thank you sooo much :)
,Theata,2013-04-23T04:30Z,"Its my Pleasure, I will upload the remaining episodes once they have finished airing :)"
,memnerd,2013-04-27T17:46Z,when will you have the rest of season 7?
,Theata,2013-05-07T14:27Z,"As soon as they finish Airing on the BBC, 1 day after to be exact. The Final episode airs May 18 2013 (Episode 14, The Name of the Doctor) that will conclude Season 7 and I will have a new Torrent posted on that day providing I remember!

There will also be the 50th anniversary special airing on the 23rd of November but I will leave that for everyone to pirate for themselves as 1 ep does not warrant a whole new upload and it is far too long to wait just to include it in a Season 7 Torrent.

If you want any other complete series/seasons of a TV series feel free to send me a request at:
theata_requests@hotmail.com

If you abuse that email account I will close it and will not take any request, all information sent is confidential and will not be shared and I will try my best to fill your requests."
,Theata,2013-05-19T04:12Z,"Season 7 is over! I have uploaded a new torrent that contains all of the episodes (apart from the Christmas special) here: http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8488273/

they are all in 720p and will be seeded ASAP"
