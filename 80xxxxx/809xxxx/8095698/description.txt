Sisterhood of Dune is a 2012 novel by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson. It is a sequel to their Legends of Dune trilogy, and as such is a prequel to the 1965 science fiction novel Dune, by Frank Herbert.

The book is set eighty years after the Battle of Corrin, in which robotic forces were destroyed by the human military supporting the Butlerian Jihad. 

It is the first in a trilogy that aims to describe the foundation of several schools that figure prominently in the later Dune novels.
