,Toforto2,2013-02-04T20:31Z,Hey IQ i was wondering.Are you gonna be uploading the ENTIRE season 16 coming up in 720p ? If so i love you! If not i still love you for uploading this episode in high quality :D Its hard to come by stuff like this.Please reply.
,BoltSim,2013-02-09T16:43Z,"I literally just made an account to say this, so I hope that is an indication of how awesome this is for me. 

It's hard to find proper HD uploads of this so I really hope you continue to do this with this series. :) Whether or not you decide to, thank you for this."
[T],iqeiqe,2013-02-09T21:09Z,"Thanks for the interest, but my capture equipment kinda failed me on today's episode so I figure I'll just stop encoding this instead of releasing sporadically. 


Also, Aquafox of Cartoon-World is releasing his 720p version of this series on their torrent tracker, so you can go ahead and check those out."
,BoltSim,2013-02-10T00:49Z,"Tracking equipment fails, NOO. Well, looking at Cartoon World's uploads.. I can't quite put my finger on it, but the quality of your upload just seems considerably superior, and worth the larger size.

I appreciate your effort though, sorry the equipment gave you a bit of trouble."
