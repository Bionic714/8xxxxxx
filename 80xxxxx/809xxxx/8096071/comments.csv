DO NOT REGISTER!  Seems pretty self-explanatory
DO NOT INSTALL DIRECT X 8.1 UNLESS you are running windows 2000 SP2 or earlier.
DO NOT INSTALL GAMESPY ARCADE!  This will just invalidate the CD Key and the game has been removed from their online servers due to age.  Also, if you register, they will track you and you can get busted for piracy.  Tech Support hasn't been offered in almost 5 years, so there is no reason to register.  And the 1.01 version 534_b patch will bring the game to the latest unofficial patch.  There is a 534_c patch but its largely unstable and it just adds a federation battleship.  The mod does that too."
,matrix_hacker_neo,2013-02-02T22:20Z,"I have noticed when playing with the mod, sometimes, the script files for the mission(s) or the poly-count is not compatible with the game.  In that case the game will crash to the desktop.  There is no way around this, just restart the game when this happens"
,KeeperUsiel,2013-02-03T14:55Z,"How about seeding some time this decade? I am apparently the only seeder left on your torrent and I am stuck at 44.84%

How about taking the laptop out of the fucking closet and leaving it running while you're oh so incredibly busy at work?"
,matrix_hacker_neo,2013-02-03T22:06Z,"With 28 seeders in one day, it should go pretty fast now.  It was only 6 1/2 hours that it was not seeding."
,matrix_hacker_neo,2013-02-05T06:37Z,only 6 seeds left?  uTorrent reports 13 seeds.  There once was 67 seeds.  If no one wants this or if people stop seeding this then I will just pull the torrent off of my computer.  No sense in stressing my expensive laptop just to seed something that no one wants.
,KeeperUsiel,2013-02-06T02:37Z,"Give it a fucking rest, junior. Seeds ebb and flow. Also, if the hard drive spinning and the NIC passing data packets is ""stressing"" your laptop, it isn't expensive. It's a piece of shit. In fact, I would dare say that ""expensive"" is idiosyncratically subjective in your use of the word. 

If you want to pull your torrent, shut the fuck up and do it already. I'll just re-up it and the TPB community won't have to listen to you whine like a bitch."
,matrix_hacker_neo,2013-02-06T05:52Z,"KeeperUsiel
Its the constant reading of several files that stresses the hard drive.  Maybe if you knew how seeding a file actually works in retrospect to the hard drive you would see that seeding all the time (I.E. 24 hours a day) puts 240,000 reads to the file per day.  This can greatly stress a hard drive that is only designated to handle 30 million reads of 20,000 files.  which is what ALL hard drives made within the last 10 years is rated to."
,matrix_hacker_neo,2013-02-06T05:53Z,"Oh and by the way, a hard drive failing because it was stressed due to seeding several torrents is not covered by the alienware warranty dated may 2012."
,KeeperUsiel,2013-02-06T12:33Z,"If you think that's any sort of a significant amount of platter, head and spindle travel for a drive, you're an idiot. The MTBF is measured in to the upper band of hundreds of millions of operations, not a handful of millions. For enterprise drives, that number goes up in to the hundreds of billions. Sorry, but your excuse doesn't wash in the slightest. AND if you're next going to claim that it's an SSD, why are you doing RWR operations on it? Why wouldn't you show at least a modicum of skill and set up a virtual drive in RAM and simply stream the data out of it? Because, obviously, you do not know how.

As I said, quit your bitching and either seed the fucking thing or pull it down and I will re-up the torrent and let it run until the sun burns out.

Also, you bought an ""Alienware""...which is now absolutely nothing more than a rebranded Dell. So I will give you the point that it's ""expensive""...but it was also an incredibly stupid purchase when more could have been had from a better vendor for far less money.

In conclusion: stop fucking whining and seed your own torrent regularly or pull it down and shut the fuck up."
