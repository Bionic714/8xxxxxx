Joan d'Arc rages through Heaven's Gate as she discovers Mary Magdalene is being held captive in Hell. Furious with the situation, she pledges to return Mary to her rightful place at Jesus' side. One angel is consumed by the passion of Joan's speech and her desire to see loved ones reunited. Cupid steps forward and joins the quest, but are two angels enough to fight through Hell and back again?
