For some reason the subtitles don't work. I opened it up in mkvmerge and the subtitle files are there - they just don't show up on the screen. Anybody else have the same problem?"

Probably because you watch it on super wide screen so you don't see the black bars..
These subs are scaled for 16/9 (1920/1080) monitors to show on lower black bar.
If you got the VobSub_2.23 I suggest to uninstall it, I have a feeling that's the cause.
If you can't re-scale it in player use the default style for subtitles. Or in Subtitle edit 3.2.8 File/Import subtitle from matroska/save as srt. 
Next time give more info what player you use etc.
Use MPC (klite + ac3 filter + CoreAVC Professional & CUDA + surcode external filter for dts...). It's a pain in the arse to make a perfect configuration but it's worth it. I play everything via hdmi (10 M long cable) to Hi-Fi receiver.
Thanks for the feedback."

I have k-lite installed and I tried both MPC and VLC media player. So, except for subtitles, this is 10."
[V],HighCode,2013-02-06T02:43Z,"l-lite is too sophisticated with it's tons of codecs. 
Try MPC from CCCP ( http://www.cccp-project.net/download.php?type=cccp ), it  will show the subs nicely  http://i.imgbox.com/abvslgeG.jpg"

Sorry I didn't mention that I'm using VLC to play the file and displaying it through hdmi cable on a 39 inch TV. As far as I know VLC automatically updates its codecs, so I shouldn't be missing one. I am using the default scale, but nothing shows up on the lower black bar. No idea what the VobSub_2.23 is. I'm guessing it's a codec that I shouldn't have?

I have solved my specific problem by downloading subtitles from here:
http://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/3294570/youth-without-youth-en

and resyncing them (adv -20sec) here:

Thanks for you response even though most of it is over my head."
,AsifAkheir,2013-02-08T09:18Z,"I watched more carefully and I noticed occasionally there are little black bars and dots at the bottom of the image. I think they may be the very tops of the subtitles - the problem may be black lettering on the black background of the lower black bar. If the color of the letters can be changed then it might solve everything.
Just trying to help. English subs are OK, but I love the idea of multilingual subs."
