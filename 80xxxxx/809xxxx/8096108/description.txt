Description

Backgammon Deluxe is an excellent version of one of the oldest two player dice board games. Players win by removing all of their pieces from the board. Although luck is involved and factors into the outcome, strategy plays a more important role in the long run. Play against the computer or with a friend.

3 levels of AI gameplay (easy, medium and hard) lets you keep having fun as you improve your game.
