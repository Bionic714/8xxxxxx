,desiemmett,2013-02-07T20:24Z,"Despite the douchieness of a password, this actually works.
Don't install the 9.0.4 as the [k] states it's for
9.0.3
The first time I put in 9.0.4- didn't work.
Re-installed as described above and it works fine.
With that said, here is a link to a review of PT 9 and it discusses some of the instability inherent in the program.

, here need min. PT 9.0.5, but no pacth/crack ...like the new 10HD.
Protools work ONLY on snowleopard to the 9.0.3

We are unlucky,m because nobody have release any new patch for MAC...(only for win , with PT HD 10.x)

,togril,2013-02-11T00:14Z,"Thanks uploader. 
@avinv: Yes the password is correct =  rules. Maybe it's the silly password dropdown in unrarx. use something else. I unzipped it with that password.

Just to confirm what will keep coming up:

WILL NOT WORK ON 10.8.2! YOU NEED PT9.0.5 AT LEAST.

Shame really, I was using the windows 10 patch on PC and didn't really run into any problems. which shows it can be done."
