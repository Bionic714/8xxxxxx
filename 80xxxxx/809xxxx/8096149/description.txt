ARCHIE #640

The good news is Veronica's favorite music group Tickled Blue is coming to Riverdale and playing a show for her birthday! The bad news is, Tickled Blue is coming to Riverdale and Archie gave Veronica a jacket with fake signatures from the band! Now it's a race against the clock for Archie to get a replacement jacket with authentic autographs before she wears it to the show and the jacket is exposed as a fraud! Can Archie track down the musicians before the candles are blown out? See for yourself in "Full Muddle Jacket!"

That story, plus Mr. Lodge offends a famous artist in "A Hanging Offense" and Moose has trouble defending his teammates from getting tackled when he's too busy defending Midge against Reggie in "Date n' Tackle!"
