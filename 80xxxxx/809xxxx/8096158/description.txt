HOLA FELLOW PB MEMBERS THIS PACK CONTAINS ALL OF THE RINGTONES NOTIFICATION THAT I HAVE PUT OUT. ALL WILL WORK FOR THE IPHONE HOWEVER ITUNES WILL ONLY LET YOU ADD FILE THAT ARE 1 TO 30 SECONDS LONG. SO NOT EVERY SINGLE ONE WILL BE ABLE TO BE ADDED TO ITUNES. FUTURE PACKS WILL USABLE FOR ANDROID AND APPLE AND I WILL DO MY BEST TO KEEP EVERYTHING 30 SECONDS AND UNDER FOR THE IPHONE.


ENJOY AND PLEASE SEED WHEN DONE DOWNLOADING!!!!!



*NOTE* TO add to Itunes just open I tunes. Go to the tones/ringtones section and drag and drop the files in there. Then plug in your phone and sync. If you're having any issues there are youtube videos to help out.
