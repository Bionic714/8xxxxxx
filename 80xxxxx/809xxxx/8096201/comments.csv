Second, Video is of great quality as is the sound, unfortunately the video stutters in and out making this a bad concert for me. As much as I sacrificed to obtain this concert I will delete, and look for another one.  "

I want to apologize to the uploader for my first comment.  And will rate the video a 10, and Audio a 9.  There are lots of extras on this also.  Including some Ronnie James Dio.  Thanks again"
