,LordHelel,2013-02-10T11:20Z,is a disc required to play this?
,inflamm_reboot,2013-02-12T08:28Z," Most CFW is either linked to some type of malware; and the files that aren't are attached to some fucking surveys that require you to spend money... or they just don't give you the password. Someone has a folder on their desktop containing all the necessary tools to make this happen. Are people getting their doors kicked down? WTF... Why isn't anyone posting anything REAL? I can't find the shit ANYWHERE. My antivirus allows me to click on anything and remain immune... I have literally tried every site, forum, and torrent... All are fails. Which means I haven't tried ALL sites... But no one here will be able to point me in the right direction because we are all on the same boat. Can someone please share a REAL 3.55 custom firmware... My system is running OFW 3.55. Rogero, and all of the other jailbreak providers have stripped the sites. Its like no one will touch the stuff anymore because of the legal situations. I feel like I missed the window, when the software was everywhere..."
