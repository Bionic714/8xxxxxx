"Windjammer: The Voyage of the Christian Radich," filmed in Cinemiracle but exhibited in Cinerama from 1958 to 1964, is basically a travelogue about a  17,500 mile voyage from Norway to the Caribbean and up the coast of the US undertaken by several dozen Norwegian teenagers sent to sea to become men. If that sounds corny, it is, a bit, but it's hard not to be swept up film's high spirits. All the original elements of the three-strip photography are long gone or beyond repair and this 2012 release was created from a 35mm copy (with all three Cinerama panels) in a Norwegian film museum. The visual and sound have been restored as much as possible, and the film has been mastered in "Smile-box" to simulate what it looked like in Cinerama. While it sometimes comes across now as "Glee at Sea," it's still enjoyable.
