But screens looks good!"
,GSEPPY420,2013-02-03T02:21Z,Good Looks MATINE. People who complain about free stuff should be shot. Keep up the good work. Your one of my trusted uploaders I always check for files.
,some-young-guy,2013-02-03T05:17Z,"HaloReD and MATINE, you guys fucking rock!  For a first release of a cam the quality is excellent, (at least according to the sample).

A-9 Mild noise from cammer shifting positions and what not.

V-7.5-7.8  Comparable to an early 80s VHS.  Right side of screen appears to be mildly cropped, but not that noticeable.  Colors look great, lights not to bright or dark.

Overall quality is excellent and I doubt there will be any better releases.  SEED YOU BITCHES!!!!"

,some-young-guy,2013-02-03T18:23Z,"adsycher, your mother is a fake.  Your dad is either the milkman or the mailman.  it is still i the air which of the 2 made it up the stairs first.  Get a life you fucking spammer.  Your link is garbage here.  We all know better.  Nobody will pay a fucking dime so it looks like your half breed children will starve to death, and good for them as they will not have to live a long fucked up life with a loser for a parent.  You are a mistake and a complete waste of oxygen.  Purchase a shotgun and go reverse skeet shooting cock sucker!"

,mcravin,2013-02-04T14:48Z,thanks been waiting on this one
,DctrEvil,2013-02-05T03:02Z,"A: 3 (Noise from cam-holder moving and loud sounds from film craps out the cam's mic every few minutes)
V:3 (@some-young-guy you're on crack if you think this is VHS quality. I saw Reel-To-Reel in gradeschool that was higher definition than this)
M: Don't know, had to stop because of crap quality

This is a witch hunting movie, so the low-def quality looses 80% of the viewing pleasure durring the film's night scenes (which is the majority of the film). There are many 5-10 second portions cut out periodically, causing you to miss a few action sequences. Also, the right side of the screen is so cropped that some entire scenes are ruined.
This isn't the WORST cam I've ever seen, but it is unwatchable.

Please stop praising everybody who uploads just because they took the time to do it. Encouraging shit uploads like this hurts this community more than leeching does."

they made a comment to be ready for complaining cause they know it sucks. dont be a bitch, just be honest. dont act like your shit dont stink"
,Fritz.,2013-02-07T16:34Z,"people who say don't complain about free shit are so stupid.

if you downloaded a movie and it was nothing but static you would complain. just because it was free would not change the fact that it was garbage.

people need to stop being sensitive little girls"
,woaafm03,2013-02-08T07:45Z,"a-8
V- 5....there was a lot of backround noise and it seems that theres 3-4 minutes missing here and there throughout the movie. Still, it's free and it was a good movie that I didn't have to wait to see so thanks!
Any chance you might have Warm Bodies?"
,turtlelaviada,2013-02-08T09:41Z,"the movie has some missing footage.. it just jumps a little bit, like during an action scene, one second theyre talking then it flashs to them in the middle of a fight... but its still watchable.. its a decent enough movie i like that they made hansel and gretel use a lot of bad language (thought it was funny) and gretel is SMOKIN HOT!!!!! a/8 v/6 m/7"

,steve221,2013-02-11T06:41Z,"Nothing is free. just because you didn't pay for this movie doesn't mean it's free, you still have to pay for your internet to download it. Unless you walked to the public library, and downloaded and watched it their, all while not paying taxes ever, then this movie is free. "
,MiscFoxes,2013-02-12T08:47Z,"Video : 6 (about 1/6 of the image is cropped off on the right side, it becomes glaringly obvious several times when someone is speaking from the removed area. Grainy otherwise)

Audio : 6 (fairly clear, slightly tinny in places. Only a bit of rough noise now and then.)

Still watchable and enjoyable."
