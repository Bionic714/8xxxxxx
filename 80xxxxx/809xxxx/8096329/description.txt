The first six volumes covering 1945-1950 were released in 2008. Right away, the word was out. This series is definitive, fabulously packaged, and faultlessly remastered! - Jack Clement, who produced Johnny Cash, Roy Orbison, Waylon Jennings, Don Williams, and many others, said, 'this is the best country series of all time. No doubt. No question.'

Now the story continues from 1951 until 1955. Every CD is generously full. Every booklet is extensive and chocked full of rare photos and illustrations, as well as complete stories behind the songs! - In addition to the hits, the series contains rarities that went on to influence country music.and all music.in the years ahead.
