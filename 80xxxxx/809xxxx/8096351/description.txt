Story & Art by Fred Perry

Master Ecko of the Shadow Elves invites Gina back his inner sanctuary, but is called away for an urgent meeting, leaving Gina is alone in her future self's laboratory. Too tempted to resist, Gina begins snooping, until she comes upon a jolly, red, candy-like button that inexplicably reads "Don't touch this, Gina." She touches it.
