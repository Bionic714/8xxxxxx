Bear FamilyΓÇÖs Dim Lights, Thick Smoke and Hillbilly Music series is one of the great treasures of hardcore honky tonk music recorded during the golden years of country & western. In the middle of the '50s, honky tonk was beginning to shift and change shapes, and this volume illustrates that fact beautifully. This entire series has proved itself invaluable as documentary evidence of the evolution of country music, and this volume adds to that argument. (allmusic.com)
