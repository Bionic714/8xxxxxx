The music is mainly hits from 1955. But it also includes rare songs that are of historic interest. All songs are perfect digitally restored. The sound is so good that you may think that these recordings was recorded just yesterday. George Jones great hit Why baby why, is released here for the first time in an long uncut version. Buy it and enjoy the great music and read about it in the great good looking cd sleeve.A super good release.
