,Mothra67,2013-02-03T01:16Z,"I will have to go thru all my files to double check, but I do think I have some MR. A.  Mainly the TPB that Fantagraphics did of Mr. A but again I have to check!"
,earth2too,2013-02-04T04:29Z,"Mothra, you're killing it with this stuff! Thanks so much."
,Mothra67,2013-02-13T09:26Z,"Thank you all for loving this stuff!

BTW I will no longer be seeding this, my share ratio hit 10, and I have limited bandwidth, so please keep it going!

PS: keep a look out for my torrents of complete runs of the original golden age plastic man, Doll Man and Kid eternity coming very very soon!"
