These twenty-two tracks of classic southern gospel music present much variety from the Smithsonian Folkways vaults. Dating primarily from the late 1950s and early 1960s, these songs are country or bluegrass gospel as performed and listened to by white family groups. The earliest recorded offering is Wondrous Love, recorded in 1951 by The Old Harp Singers of Eastern Tennessee. The latest recording dates to a 1993 special meeting of the Indian Bottom Assn. of Old Regular Baptists singing I'm Going to a City. Extensive liner notes (25 pages total) provide an introduction to the music, the 19th Century roots of the music, publishing companies, quartets, pentecostalism, modern southern gospel, song notes, and suggestions for further listening and reading.
