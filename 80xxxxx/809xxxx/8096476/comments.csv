,maxijonson,2013-03-14T02:33Z,second time I tried to play it asked for a CD
,maxijonson,2013-03-14T02:37Z,"found the solution:

DO NOT delete the download keep it somewhere because the dmg that contains Simcity 4 Deluxe and Aspyr Game Agent make's the game run so keep it like in your documents but DO NOT DELETE SIMCITY 4 RUSH HOUR.DMG OR YOU ARE FUCKED AND NEED TO DOWNLOAD IT BACK or find a way to simulate the CD....
hope that helps"
,maxijonson,2013-03-14T03:06Z,"I've made a script for Applescript editor (that all of you have) so you can run it easily so do as I say:

1. Put the files from the Simcity 4 Rush Hour.dmg in the applications folder (because my script executes on the applications folder).

2. Open Applescript Editor

3. copy this in it:
 tell application ""Finder""
	activate
	make new Finder window to folder ""downloads"" of home
end tell
tell application ""Finder""
	activate
	set target of Finder window 1 to folder ""SimCity_4_Rush_Hour"" of folder ""Applications"" of startup disk
	open document file ""SimCity 4 Rush Hour.dmg"" of folder ""SimCity_4_Rush_Hour"" of folder ""Applications"" of startup disk
	delay 5
	set target of Finder window 1 to folder ""SimCity 4 Deluxe"" of folder ""Applications"" of startup disk
	open application file ""SimCity 4 Rush Hour.app"" of folder ""SimCity 4 Deluxe"" of folder ""Applications"" of startup disk
end tell

4. test it if it works

5. if the test works, save as an application wherever you want.

Done! you can now simply make the application run by clicking the application you just made"
