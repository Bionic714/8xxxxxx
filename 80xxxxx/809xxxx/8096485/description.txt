The origins of the UK Columbia Records label date, almost incredibly, as far back as the beginnings of the recorded sound itself. In 1880 Alexander Graham Bell co-founded the Volta Graphophone Company, which was succeeded by the American Graphophone Company. In 1888 this company became the Columbia Phonograph Company, which sold Edison phonographs and cylinders.
In the early years of the twentieth century the famous Magic Notes logo (a pair of semiquavers) was introduced, and this was used by the UK company when it was sold off by its US parent in 1922 and became the Columbia Graphophone Company. In 1931 the UK label merged with Gramophone Company (which owned HMV) to become Electrical and Musical Industries (EMI), although the Columbia Records brand name and logo were retained and used until the early Seventies (they have since been purchased by Sony).

This 2-CD set consists of 50 songs, truly gems from the Columbia Vault, from 1954 to 1961. The artists are quite varied, ranging from Sir Cliff Richard, the Shadows, Helen Shapiro, Acker Bilk (from UK) to Paul Anka, Jimmie Rodgers, Chordettes, Bobby Rydell, Chubby Checker and Linda Scott (US), just to name a few. The sound is very well recorded and in fantastic stereo too. (amazon.ca)
