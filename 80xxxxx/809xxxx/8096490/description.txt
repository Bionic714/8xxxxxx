A number of blues artists exerted a huge influence on the development of modern popular music, but the single most influential one was undoubtedly Muddy Waters. From 1948 until 1955, he pioneered and guided the way in style, substance, and sound, eloquently defining the aggressive, swaggering, Delta-rooted blues music of the era. His inspired and fundamental music continues to reverberate as forcefully through the music of today as it did more than 50 years ago. This release features some of his most inspired tracks.
