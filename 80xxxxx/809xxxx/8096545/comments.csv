,out-half,2013-02-03T04:37Z,where do you get high quality like this?(as in video quality) and could you please upload the Ireland v Wales match? 
[T],rugbybill,2013-02-03T11:51Z,@out-half: a low constant rate factor combined with slower and more rigorous encoding algorithm. Just a shame the BBC broadcast quality has reduced over time.

,EdoSensei,2013-02-04T08:15Z,"Awesome upload!! Thanks. 720p AND MP4 meaning I can play directly through a console to TV.

Please do all the 6 Nations games if possible (Especially England's games), please."
