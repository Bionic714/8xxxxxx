Live action as England and Scotland begin their Six Nations campaigns by contesting the Calcutta Cup at Twickenham. England are looking for a fourth consecutive Test victory over the Auld Enemy, having won last season's Murrayfield encounter 13-6, courtesy of a Charlie Hodgson try. And they begin the Six Nations among the favourites to take this year's title following their memorable win against world champions New Zealand in November. For Scotland the game marks the beginning of a new era after the departure of former head coach Andy Robinson, as his interim replacement Scott Johnson takes charge for the first time. 
Andrew Cotter and Brian Moore are in the commentary box.
