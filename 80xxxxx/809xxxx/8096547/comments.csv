seeings how this is new, i'll definately be seeding beyond my usual 2.0 ratio. Hope y'all enjoy it as much as i do."

,dvdriprocketmail,2013-05-19T18:59Z,Thank you.  My 3 year old daughter and 1 year old son love Power Rangers.  I immediately noticed that the acting on this is way better than the acting in Power Rangers Samurai and Power Rangers Super Samurai.
