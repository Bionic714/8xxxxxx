[T],Hard2Find2,2013-02-03T23:15Z,"I did not catch that, they refer to ""S02E12 Last Shiner Standing"" as the season finale and IMDB, Wiki or Discovery has nothing. I guess it's possible, they had a special at the end of season 1 (included)."
[T],Hard2Find2,2013-02-07T15:23Z,The 1st in a 2 part special aired last night. It is just a roundtable disussion with the cast. I will most likely add the 2 episodes at a later date.
