Application info/review:
Overview:
Revo Uninstaller Pro is a great program for removing unwanted applications from your computer. 
This powerful program also makes sure that after the program is removed, that it takes its leftover 
files with it. It scans your computer for any junk that the program might have left behind. 
But not only is it an uninstaller, but a full featured utility application also. 
It contains features such as: Junk Files Cleaner, Autorun Manager, MS Office Cleaner, 
Windows Cleaner, Evidence Remover, and Unrecoverable Delete. These features are in addition 
to its powerful uninstaller and force uninstall features.

Review:
Revo Uninstaller Pro is one of the best uninstallers out there. 
I have tried many programs such as Clean Unistaller, Ashampoo Uninstall, and many more, 
but I have to say that Revo Uninstaller Pro is one of the best. What caught my attention was 
the unique features it contains. It has many cleaning functionality including the 
Advanced scanning for leftovers features. When you uninstall a program from your computer, 
the software still leaves behind its program files folders and junk in your computer that 
can take up valuble space you might need. Revo Uninstaller Pro removes any leftovers of 
applications with ease. Select your program you want to uninstall, and watch the program do its magic.

Revo Uninstaller Pro creates backups of removed registry keys, values, files and folders. 
It takes other precautions such as: creating system restore point before each uninstall, 
full Registry backup before each uninstall, and full registry backup once each day - 
if Revo Uninstaller Pro is started.

After The unistall is finished, the program will continue to the Junk Files Cleaner feature by 
scanning the registry and program files to remove any leftovers from the application. 
 
Revo Uninstaller Pro also has a very useful utility called Autorun Manager. 
It control what applications begin at the startup of your PC. 
Many applications that run when your PC boots up can slow the computers startup time. 
Quicken your PC and control what runs when Windows boots up. I have always had a probrem with 
my slow boot up time but this program significantly reduced the time by only allowing only what 
is necessary for the computer to startup at boot. 

Other features include the Browser Cleaner, capable erasing web site history of web browsers 
including Firefox, Internet Explorer, Netscape and Opera. The Browsers Cleaner you can also delete 
temporary internet files which include all the images youΓÇÖve viewed, all the online videos youΓÇÖve 
watched and all the web pages youΓÇÖve visited. By deleting temporary files you can free up valuble 
space on your hard drive.

Other Notable Features of Revo Uninstaller Pro Include:
Hunter Mode
Windows Tools
MS Office Cleaner
Windows Cleaner
Evidence Remover
Unrecoverable Delete

All in All: Revo Uninstaller Pro ranks one of the best in all other competitor brands of uninstaller 
software. It has other utility function that allow it to not only be a uninstaller but also a 
maintenance suite. Delete unwanted data, clean browser history/traces, and fully uninstall programs 
are only some of the feature this great program has to offer. The only complaint about the software 
is the amount of time it takes to scan your computer. For a complete unistallation of just one program, 
it almost took 25 minutes. Not many people have the patience to wait that hefty time. 
Nonetheless, the program's functionality is great along with its computer utility options. 
I rate Revo Uninstaller Pro 5 stars out of 5.
