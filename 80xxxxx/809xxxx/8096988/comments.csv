,CheddarCheeseFlavor,2013-02-10T22:04Z,"This being actually 128 kbps is not nearly as annoying as the fact that people claim their music to be ""320 kbps"" while it's actually not. 134 MB??? You've gotta be kidding me. I have the proper 320 kbps version of this album right here and it's 107 MB... This is what this looks like in Adobe Audition http://imageshack.us/a/img825/8563/mbv2.jpg, and this is what my copy looks like http://imageshack.us/a/img341/2656/mbv1.jpg. Be a serious music listener and you'll hate this kind of fake music so much.... 764 seeders.... Christ."
