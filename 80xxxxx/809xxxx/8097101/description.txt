Iron Chef S1E01 from October 26, 2012. This is the first episode of the new Iron Chef Series from Japan. This is the RAW Japanese broadcast, no English available. I didn't capture this, credit goes out to whoever did. Just trying to spread the new series to the community.  There are more episodes, if you want to see more episodes uploaded support it, comment, whatever! Also if anyone knows where to find episodes of the orignal series in raw Japanese, even if you just have old VHS tapes ( i can rip it and share it with the community), im always looking, drop me a line, toledo47@gmail.com
