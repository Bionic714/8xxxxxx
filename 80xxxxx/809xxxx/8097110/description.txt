SPORT: Six Nations Rugby Union - Wales v Ireland.
On: BBC 1 HD   
Date: Saturday 2nd February 2013 
KO Time: 13:30 

live coverage from Cardiff's Millennium Stadium as Wales begin the defence of their Six Nations crown. The Welsh opened the 2012 campaign with victory over Declan Kidney's side in Dublin, before going on to complete their third Grand Slam in seven years. But since then they have endured a torrid time, losing their Test series in Australia 3-0, before suffering four defeats in the Autumn Internationals series, including a surprise loss to Samoa. Ireland will be looking to build on the promise they showed last time out, with a 46-24 victory over Argentina in November.
