Today I saw you had uploaded an episode of Chelsea Lately from 1/28/2013. Granted it's not that old but if you don't post it on the day it airs or maybe 2 AT MOST days after that, the people who want it will get it from someone else. We don't need uploaders like you flooding piratebay with dumbass shows like this or also the million torrents in a row you upload of shit that's already on here. It's so annoying to go through recent torrents on piratebay and there are a 1000 things uploaded one after the other all by you and it stuff that's already on this website from other uploaders. WE DON'T NEED YOU FLOODING THIS WEBSITE WITH YOUR TRASH! I used to enjoy you being on this site because you usually post stuff promptly but now I'm just so sick and tired of seeing all this useless crap you upload. STOP BEING SO GOD DAMN ANNOYING ON THIS WEBSITE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
