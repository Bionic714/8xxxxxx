2008 reissue of this lost classic from the British Invasion favorites. Originally issued in 1981, this is another fine collection of Power Pop, Jangle Pop and straight ahead melodic Rock from a band that may have been past their commercial prime, but they were definitely ahead of their game, creatively and musically. Having maintained their original mid-'60s emphasis on excellent harmonies and crisply played guitars but also having absorbed lessons from such '70s pub-rockers as Brinsley Schwarz and roots-rock expert Dave Edmunds.
