Gary Lineker introduces the best of the action from the Premier League.

Sir Alex Ferguson take his Manchester United side to west London for a meeting with Fulham as they continue their pursuit of a 20th league title.

Tony Pulis's Stoke travel to Arsenal, where they had lost all four previous Premier League encounters against Arsene Wenger's men.

Meanwhile, Newcastle host Chelsea, who boosted their squad with the signing of former St James' Park favourite, Demba Ba, in January.

Elsewhere, Everton take on Aston Villa, QPR face Norwich, Reading host Sunderland, Swansea travel to West Ham and Wigan meet Southampton."
