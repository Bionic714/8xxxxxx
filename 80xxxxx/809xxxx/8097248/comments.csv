The above claims about passwords are complete nonsense.

Both .avi files (Part1 and Part2) work fine on VLC and Gnome Mplayer.  But more importantly, they work fine, too, from the USB jack of my DVD player.

A9V8.  Fight: check it yourself and see.  No spoilers here.

Fast-forwarded to check talking bits and the AV synch is very good too.

Thanks again from all of us whose equipment doesn't support .mkv, & a few other recently popular ones."
