,hopedeny,2013-02-03T13:26Z,thankyou! the audio is always screwed up for me on the sir paul torrents.
,.Leto.,2013-02-03T14:39Z,"Picture quality is always much better with Secludedly anyway, I stopped dowloading sir paul/kyr releases a long time ago.
Thanks."
[V],SecTPB,2013-02-03T14:41Z,"Yeah, no offense to whoever is behind that SirPaul nick, but I couldn't stand those releases, so I had to take it upon myself to give quality."
,didier_drogba,2013-02-03T15:45Z,Sir. Paul not working for me. Trying this one now... please seed... I will give comments on quality afterwards
,Knan4051,2013-02-03T20:40Z,Gotta agree with you guys. Sirpaul used to be twice as bad when he/they used XviD with 25 FPS and often out of sync. RUDOS was the absolute best at 480p but Sec is holding it down now
,darrellblair1946,2013-02-04T05:36Z,"Thanks , Good Quality 10 out of 10"
,d1ers,2013-02-05T13:43Z,"A:10

,mck1070,2013-02-05T16:46Z,"agree with Leto, stop wasting ur time with sirpaul, its really fuck up no being able to find the frigging password after you finish downloading, really fuck up, 

sir paul stop with this password thing, if you are going to share, just do it right or go somewhere else"
