A mysterious photograph with no plausible explanation. An aborted
nuclear launch half a world away. And the continuing appearance of
mysterious men in black.


Release Notes:

The synapsis matches that of what TVrage has listed for E10 Alien
Evidence, but we're not going to go by TVrage for this series as
it doesn't match what more official Unsealed sources report.

There has been some confusion about a previous release and we will
try to clear it up for some of you. What was first released as
Unsealed Alien Files S01E08 Aliens Among Us should be renamed to
"Unsealed Alien Files S01E08 Top 10 Alien Plots".

Unsealed Alien Files S01E08 Top 10 Alien Plots is not what some
claim to be Unsealed Alien Files S01E10 Alien Evidence. There is
no S01E10 available at this time.

Episodes 09 and 10 are still missing from both series as we have
been getting the re-airs and those stopped airing to make way for
these new episodes.
