,Random_Ninja,2013-02-03T11:35Z,is this PW protected like that sir paul crap?
,kjhgviyvoiyoi,2013-02-03T17:14Z,7h - 0.8%. Hehe. This is slow. Feels like we are very few who seed when we leech. To bad UFC doesn't have any easyer way for us to get it. I would pay for it.

,PCdoc7,2013-02-19T14:27Z,"Why the .ts file extension ?
A lot of people have not come across that before - I have heard you can just rename it to mpg but if so, why not upload this as an mpg file ?   My problem is that it does NOT playback Audio with my PS3 using PS3 media server.  So although psyched to watch this - I ended up downloading the MP4 version at 1/4th the bandwidth.  I probably should have tried the renaming trick to see if audio would play."
,L33chmaster,2013-02-22T15:08Z,"The BEST release so far. Totally worth it. Thank you.

For ALL THE PEOPLE who are uncomfortable with the size can checkout other versions of the uploads, there is just no need for yapping about it. 

9GiB is absolutely alright. I would love it if you keep this quality of video for all the forth coming UFC Events please.
Regards."
