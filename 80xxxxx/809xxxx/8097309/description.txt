                        "Contact! Naruto vs. Itachi"

Synopsis:
    As the travel slowly towards and unknown destination, Nagato and Itachi wonder who they were going to be forced to fight. Sensing a nostalgic presence only to be greeted by Naruto who is accompanied by Killer B. Their reunion conversation, however, is cut short when Kabuto ΓÇö thrilled by the prospect of capturing the Eight and Nine-Tails ΓÇö commanded Itachi to attack. Slicing through the enormous fireball launched at them using Samehada, B later has to apologise to the sentient blade who did not appreciate being used to absorb hot flames. Moving-in, Itachi clashes with Naruto while they converse about Sasuke. Revealing to Itachi that he knew the truth behind the Uchiha Clan Massacre, a shocked Itachi questions how far this news had spread and upon hearing that only a few people knew, requested that it stay that way. Though puzzled, Nagato was forced to attack and the battle between the four shinobi ensue. Retreating atop Nagato's Giant Drill-Beaked Bird, Itachi activates his Mangeky┼ì Sharingan causing one of his crows to emerged from a shocked Naruto's mouth. Casting Amaterasu, Itachi incinerates Nagato's summons as well as Nagato himself, telling the Rinnegan-wielder that his plan had worked. It is revealed that the crow had Shisui Uchiha's Mangeky┼ì Sharingan implanted in its eye socket and the eye was rigged to react to Itachi's eyes and cast Kotoamatsukami: which had the order "protect Konoha". Now freed from Kabuto's control, Itachi explains that this was the power he had given to Naruto and had intended for it to be used on his brother. During this explanation, however, Nagato's corpse was able to regenerate and Kabuto, excited by the prospect of acquiring Shisui's DNA, had Nagato attack once again. Hidden in his Giant Snake-Tailed Chameleon, Nagato surprises the group launching a large-scaled Shinra Tensei before targeting B who throttles him in Version 2 only to have Nagato absorb his chakra, restoring him to his youthful-looking self. With this, Nagato captures Naruto and prepares to remove his soul.
