AutoCAD MEP Draw, designs and documents installations of buildings through AutoCAD software designed for the specific needs of designers and mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP). AutoCAD MEP Autodesk software dedicated to engineers, professionals in the field of mechanical engineering, electrical and plumbing (MEP) and specific plant design (water, electricity, heating and air conditioning), for climate engineering and documentation .

The software includes tools developed specifically for the plant design that promote efficiency and controls for the automation of design activities that improve the accuracy of projects. Also, the sharing of projects between architects, structural engineers and other designers, thanks to DWG format, allows for better coordination of design information.

AutoCAD MEP software helps to minimize errors prior to construction, providing greater coordination and sharing. With AutoCAD MEP, the production of drawings is automated, saving time and giving space for the creation of systems.

Regardless of whether you are working on an architectural project led by an architect or in collaboration with professionals from other disciplines, such as civil and structural engineers can work in a familiar environment while deploying new systems and documentation tools according to their needs.

Here are some of the main features:
Environment Au toCAD family
Workspaces based on industry-specific
Specific tools for schematic design
Representation of the drawings
Annotation smart objects
Perfect coordination of sections and elevations
Schedules automatic and always up to date
Integrated management of drawings
Advanced options for displaying projects
Multidisciplinary coordination
