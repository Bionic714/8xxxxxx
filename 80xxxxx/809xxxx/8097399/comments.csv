,slackbrian,2013-02-05T03:22Z,"Just out of curiosity, is there some issue with the latest episode of Green Lantern: The Animated Series?  It seems like no one has it, aside from the low-quality CP rip.  Young Justice obviously has quite a few torrents available, but it just seems odd that there are basically none for the show it's paired with on CN."
