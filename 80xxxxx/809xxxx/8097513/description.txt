This book is based upon a laboratory course developed at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem and contains a number of experimental procedures dealing with the chemistry of natural products. The material covered is quite broad in that it describes both the secondary plant products such as pigments, alkaloids, and terpenoids which are dear to the organic chemist's heart and the primary products such as the lipids, carbohydrates, and proteins which are more frequently dealt with in biochemistry. The organization is along biogenetic lines: first, the acetogenins, then the nitrogeneous compounds followed by carbohydrates and isoprenoids. The book would appear to be unique. The only similar texts available are the laboratory manuals used in pharmacognosy.  

Each section of the book is preceded by a brief and concise description of the general chemistry of the type of compounds being considered. 
These are especially well done and, taken together, provide an excellent introduction to natural product chemistry.
