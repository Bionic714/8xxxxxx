,rosstitute,2013-02-07T16:29Z,Finally someone has this rip right! Hard-coded subs for non-English speaking parts. No getting up to turn them on/off as required like every other upload. Well done! A10 V10 Subs 10.
,ectoendomezo,2013-02-24T21:48Z,"There Really is an absolutely Critical..Necessary Difference amongst torrent UL'ers;

The 'ARTIST' UL'ers like KiNGDOMET in many cases actually stand Alone in their Conquering of the ..'The'..Mortal...Fatal...Flaw in Torrents:

Hardcoded Subs for NON-English Peaking Portions.

Argo..

Premium Rush..

Many more films these days contain absolutely Critical ..PLOT...critical..moments in..Farsi..or Mandarin (as per the examples above) and to release a file that has ""subs"" but actually means ""you have to turn on/off English Subs"" is..well..not ""real"". Its..frankly..""fake"".

So to KiNGDOMET and the Literally like 1 other I can think of who TAKE THE TIME to do the PRO thing and share files with HC'd Subs as the move was MEANT to be seen..THANK YOU!

Truly..Thank you.

If not for you..these films would be literally..Pointless as 'torrents'.

So thanks from the heart.

You are the Torrent Artists.
