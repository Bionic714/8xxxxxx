 Theme Graphite Next Launcher
I am pleased to present you the new theme for the Next Launcher
Great HD quality icons.
Replace everything application icons
Background icons superimposed on the outside of the icons, thus creating the effect of glare on the icon
*** Important tips:
After purchase, be sure to click to open a theme (theme is ask yourself reinstall click Yes, install), or theme does not appear in the list of themes. This is necessary due to the new defense Android 4.1.
1. Make sure that the latest version V1.15 of Next Launcher has been installed! (Look for the "Next Launcher" into Google Play to download)
2. Apply the theme: menu-&gt; Indicidual-&gt; Installed Themes-&gt; Choose Graphite theme.
