,millu27,2013-02-03T18:53Z,"Many thanks esharoth! Games works 100%.
Do you plan uploading more GOG Mac games? Thanks!"
[V],esharoth,2013-02-03T20:35Z,"Not really planning to, as I don't actually own a MAC. I uploaded this one by request.

There's this torrent with 33 other MAC games from GOG, though:

thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7862085/[MAC]_Ultimate_GOG_Collection_(33_games)"
,millu27,2013-02-03T21:16Z,"Many thanks for your reply esharoth. I already spotted that torrent, but Mac GOG games are pretty elusive. I own a few, but do you know by chance if more Mac GOG games a part from these 33 are available somewhere else? Thanks again!"
,_RADIUS_,2013-02-05T19:00Z,Just a request for you or anyone you know... I would LOVE to find a Mac copy (wineskin or whatever) copy of Sanitarium. Loved that game. Thanks for this upload too!
[V],esharoth,2013-02-05T19:44Z,"I think it would be better to post the request for that on the forums, so more people would see it."
,Guyface_McBrush,2013-02-15T19:05Z,"esharoth, thank you SO much for this.

_RADIUS_, unbelievable! I actually *own* that game, AND have it for wineskin. let me see if i can manage to make a torrent for you."
,FastForwarder,2013-04-11T17:54Z,"I get a error trying to run this game. Is there a update or a chance for a re-up? 

After I select Alpha or Alien it bombs with a terran.exe encountered a problem."
[V],esharoth,2013-05-02T15:12Z,"There have been no updates released for the MAC version, sorry."
