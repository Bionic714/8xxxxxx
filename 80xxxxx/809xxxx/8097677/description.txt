Two farmers' daughters in Burma are spearheading protests against a Chinese-backed copper mine that is said to be causing pollution and damage to crops. Lucy Ash investigates.

They are trailed by plainclothes police officers and called ΓÇ£cowsΓÇ¥ by government officials. They spent four nights in prison until a public outcry prompted their release. The copper mine is run by the powerful Myanmar military and its partner, a subsidiary of a Chinese arms manufacturer.

Aye Net and Thwe Thwe Win, the daughters of farmers whose education stopped at primary school, have rocketed to national prominence in Myanmar for their defiance of a copper mining project run by the powerful Myanmar military and its partner, a subsidiary of a Chinese arms manufacturer.
