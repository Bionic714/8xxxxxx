as usual good job complex!

|	Follow the storyline of the entire action manga epic in Fist of
|	the North Star: Ken's Rage 2.

|	The destructive power of the techniques of Hokuto Shinken and
| 	Nanto Seiken meet the intense action of the Warriors series to
|	produce a thrilling experience for fans of both series.

|	In addition to the signature moves of the first title, new actions |
|	such as 'sprint' and 'dodge' have been added to the move sets.

|	A new Legend mode offers a re-imagined version of the Raoh
|	storyline and also covers the Celestial Emperor and Land of
|	Shura sagas.

|	This faithful adaptation ensures that this mode can be enjoyed
|	by both fans of the manga and new comers to Kenshiro's
|	post-apocalyptic world.

|	Different characters will be controlled for each episode while
|	'boss' encounters will feature entire famous scenes from the
|	manga, recreated in intricate detail.

|	A second mode called Dream Mode introduces newly-written,
|	original storylines to the Fist of the North Star universe while
|	bridging the gaps between parts of the main story, often focusing  |
|	on some of the series' minor characters. And for those wishing to  |
|	battle with friends, Co-Op and Versus modes puts gamers together
|	online in the wasteland.
