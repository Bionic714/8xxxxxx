From the front cover-
BILL PAXTON in.........
"In war as well as life, the difference between truth and deception is
 what a man allows himself to believe."

Based on the explosive true story.

"More powerful than 'Apocalypse Now' "- New York Post

From the Back Cover-
Vietnam was a devastating war. From the Communist North to the U.S. supported
South, it saw one nation brutally torn apart, and at the heart of it, one man.
Lt. Colonel John Paul Vann (Bill Paxton- Titanic, Twister, Apollo 13) is one of
the first U.S. senior military advisors sent to Vietnam. Vann is as complex as
the war itself- a husband and father who takes lovers as casually as he takes 
control of every situation.....except one. In Vietnam, Vann finds himself fighting 
a war he cannot win alongside a corrupt and demoralized South Vietnamese Army. 
But what leads a man to expose the truth and sacrifice his career? To fly from 
a loving home to a war-torn battlefield. To turn from a soldier of strategy to 
a general of ruthless bombing campaigns which can only destroy what they cannot 
defeat.
A man- a time- a nation of change. What they share together and what tears them 
apart is A BRIGHT SHINING LIE.
