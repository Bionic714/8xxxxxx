avast! Internet Security provides complete antivirus, anti-spyware, antispam, and firewall protection, complemented by avast! SafeZone???ΓÇ₧?? and new hybrid cloud technologies, for best protection against viruses, spyware, and other types of malware in 2012.

Shop and bank online without worry
SafeZone creates a private and isolated virtual window on your desktop for safely making your sensitive financial transactions when shopping or banking online.

Surf and socialize without annoyance
Sandbox lets you surf the web and run programs virtually (outside your PC), and Web, IM, and P2P shields ensure your safety on social networksTwitter, etc.), IM chats (Skype, ICQ, etc.), or file-sharing sites.

Benefit from real-time protection
Hybrid cloud technology streams your virus database updates to your PC in real-time, so your avast! software has all virus definitions as soon as they are known to our Virus Lab.

Know what's coming before you click
Our cloud-based FileRep feature keeps reputation data on countless files, using select criteria (such as prevalence and emergence) for determining risks - so we can warn you of a file's reputation beforehand.

Keep your ID yours and yours alone
Your built-in silent firewall blocks hackers and other unauthorized entry attempts to steal sensitive personal data from your PC. Phishing attacks are prevented via built-in anti-spam.

See your avast! history
Your AVAST Account portal is your personal directory for all your avast! related data. Each month, we also prepare for you a Security Report that shows an overview of the most significant details (e.g. number of infected sites blocked).

Get help from a ???╨é??Geek' in your network
Our new Remote Assistance lets you initiate remote support from a family member or friend who agrees to help. Initiated by you, it routes through AVAST's servers, bypasses firewalls, and can be terminated by you at any time.
