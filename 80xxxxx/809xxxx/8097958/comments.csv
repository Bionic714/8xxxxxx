the least v can do to help him is not circulate this 1 on the forums/net so dat folks go to the theatre n pay for wotchin it so dat he gets back his investment.

V need to sacrifice dis much for such a talented actor/producer/director .

SaM bro M sure u'll understand n appreciate the facts."

So sick of these Curry Sniffer's movies taking up space."
