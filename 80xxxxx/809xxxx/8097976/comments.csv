,residentsalim,2013-02-04T08:12Z,U GUYS SUCK INSTEAD OF POSTING MEDAL OF HONOUR AND ACE COMBAT U R POSTING A RUBBISH GAME LIKE THIS!!!
,VegitoDBZ,2013-02-04T23:14Z,"I would say thanks for the release, except this shit doesn't work. You get black screen and nothing else."
,VegitoDBZ,2013-02-05T00:35Z,"It works, sorry about previous comment, but you have to unpack it manually, and then unpack it. Through installer, something fucks up and game doesn't work"
[V],PirateBoy,2013-02-05T04:57Z,"@ residentsalim

We didnt upload Ace Combat game here in TPB coz tpb was down at that time upgrading software. May be we will upload it some time in the future if we have time. If you want, you can get it through direct download links from our site. Else, you can wait.

Regarding Medal of Honor, instead of bitching about MOH, try to read the comments once in a while in the previous releases here in tpb. We have told you countless times that we wont be doing games like MOH, Max Payne 3, Rage, La Noire, Amazing Spiderman and others. If you want them, there are many repacks available on the net for you to grab anyone you want coz its completely useless reminding us something which we wont do. Now, if you want a reason why we are not doing them, go n read the comments n the previous releases"
