,Dirtfrog399,2013-02-03T21:17Z,"Had a problem with my VLC player running the file. Picture was having hickups and difficult to watch. Might be a codec problem with my vlc. 
Downloaded GOM Media Player (free) and it plays it perfect. 
Awesome quality Slick!"

,Rikster2,2013-02-04T03:50Z,"OH MY GOD 60FPS!! I've been waiting for this for so long it's soo smooooth! I love you man! It was well needed, 30fps was just not enough it was way too blurry for the fast paced action. Can I make one suggestion though? It seems many users computers are too slow to be able to play it which is why some of you are getting stuttery playback, so I think you should upload 2 torrents. 1 at 30fps and one at 60fps, just like when you used to upload 480p and 720p. Keep it up man!"
,sanga77,2013-02-04T04:43Z,"Hi 
if you could up load two versions like last year it would be much appreciated.. on top of the appreciation we have for you now.

1 at 30fps and one at 60fps, just like when you used to upload 480p and 720p."

,atip93,2013-02-04T15:51Z,Thanks from Hungary! 
,SC162,2013-02-04T17:11Z,"I wasnt convinced it was going to be 60fps, due to the file size being the same size per length of video as the 30fps files. So i dont know how you did it but its dead set amazing. Just playing through a ps3 on a 60 inch led, there is no hint of any jitters, its crystal clear and soooo smooth. 
So good that i would re-download the first 4 rounds again in it lol.
I had alot of trouble lately with my tv, where it would have random pixels around riders, whole riders would simply dissapear and flicker (this is on dvd's, not so much on downloaded stuff) and it all came back to setting the tv's picture settings up properly. Its night and day difference. So maybe some you can try that for a starting point?
This stuff slick has put up is better quality than any dvd i have bought, so i for one am gratefull and happy for what we are getting. 
I have always noticed the cbs stuff doesnt look as good for some reason though. 
So while i am not exactly sure why or how this weeks looks sooo good, please keep it coming like this. 
Btw, my shitty internet is only running at 220-250 kbps at the moment, and its taking me 12+ hrs to download these most weeks now, but its worth it- before someone comes back with the file size complaint again lol"

,nickd1212,2013-02-05T01:29Z,"I had a problem playing this as well.  I usually use VLC player, but I guess it struggles with mkv formats as it would play this mkv with a slight amt of chop...and I tried it with GOM media player...it was even worse!  I found another that worked for me finally...PotPlayer..lol.  And thank you slicknick..I just really appreciate you putting all the AMA Supercross and Motocross televized races on here..it's kewl as hell..i'll donate something soon. =)"
