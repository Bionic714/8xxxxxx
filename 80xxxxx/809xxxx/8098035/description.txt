W.A. Mozart, the original Wunderkind, player and tireless socialite of the classical period, made himself a star on the musical scene of 18th century Europe, thanks to his enormous output of the most divinely elegant tunes ever written. Tragically, the fame and acclaim would prove too much for the young genius, and he died in poverty and exhaustion just 35 years old.
