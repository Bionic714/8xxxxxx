thanks for all your hard work!"
,runcdfirst,2013-02-04T22:31Z,@krill123 Perhaps someone else could do a monthly collection? Im on a laptop with limited space so i only keep about 10 days of c2c. And my initial upload isnt really suitable for larger uploads. However i have been thinking about making monthly packs of somewhere in time and c2c classics if there is a desire for it..?
