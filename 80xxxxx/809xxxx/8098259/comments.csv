,Halloweenpsycho,2013-02-09T09:35Z,"Please Note: To those downloading this series collection i have uploaded 167g near twice the series length. If you download this, please continue seeding this to the community for at least a couple of weeks so that others may compete there downloads, the speeds will drastically increase, and sharing this upload will keep it alive for future downloaders..Thanks a million in advance.

,sdrakulic,2013-02-09T23:57Z,So you take requests? Because I'd love to have this in iTunes/MP4/M4V format!
,jorgehsb2,2013-02-10T03:46Z,"Hey @Halloweenpsycho thanks for the new torrent, it's a shame, I was about finishing the old one, and uploaded about 80gb by now.
Let me ask, how did you down sized this one? the quality looks like the same."
,Halloweenpsycho,2013-02-10T11:27Z,"@sdrakulic
Yes i do..and let me know the quality you are looking to receive via sound as in 5.1 or stereo..:)"
,Halloweenpsycho,2013-02-10T11:29Z,"@jorgehsb2
Sorry bout the other..but i really needed to take care of the issues with improper coded videos in the set so the set would be complete :) as for the shrinking in size and keeping the quality..trade secrete..lol:) glad your happy with it .. "
,sdrakulic,2013-02-10T14:36Z,"@Halloweenpsycho

I'm not to familiar with sound quality terminology. All I know is I would like the best quality possible. If that's not to much to ask.

Want me to give you my email so we can stay in touch? They aren't any type of messaging features on this site, are there? "
,sdrakulic,2013-02-10T14:47Z,I wrote a comment but it's not showing up...
,Halloweenpsycho,2013-02-11T02:58Z,"@sdrakulic
Ok np..just let me know what you intend to watch it on? ipod, book tablet..home theater,pc ect.. Best way to stay in touch via Tpb..Is through comments.. i will always check comments and get back asap. :)"
,sdrakulic,2013-02-11T05:21Z,"Okay. Most likely on my iPad and home theater through apple tv streaming.

So it would have to be iTunes compatible. So a m4v (preferred) or mp4 file.

I've found some torrents, but the quality is terrible. I'd like top notch 720p/1080p (preferred) quality.

Let me know if you could do that, I would be FOREVER grateful.
This is my all time favorite show and I would like to watch it again!"
,Halloweenpsycho,2013-02-11T12:33Z,"@sdrakulic 
i will start encoding them for ya now.. Since i am in the mist of working on other stuff i can let it encode in the background.."
,Halloweenpsycho,2013-02-11T12:50Z,Ok got them encoding @ 737fps..so shouldn't take to long for all seasons.. Once there done i will upload them and post link here for ya as soon as there done..:)
,sdrakulic,2013-02-11T19:22Z,"@Halloweenpsycho
That's great! Thank you so much. I'm very excited."
,sdrakulic,2013-02-12T03:42Z,"Maybe email me when it's done?

tro@ sanda . us?"
,Halloweenpsycho,2013-02-13T19:15Z,"@sdrakulic
I apologize, i ran into some issues. had them all done, then power went out..corrupted them all..So let me do this..I just uploaded a wonderful software that you can use yourself to convert them to the format you are needing.. Here is the link
http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8139559/Dvdfab_8.2.2.7_%5BPortable%5D

Just download it, and run it..you don't need to install i took care of all that, it is portable, so all you have to do is run it.. and then you can select the extension you desire, and it is very quick with conversion as well :) Any way..Hope that helps..ENjoy.."
,Halloweenpsycho,2013-02-13T22:34Z,"so far uped 379gigs..
It would be a great help if those that finish the download could at least seed back for a week or so. It would be greatly appreciated as it would drastically help the community to download at a much faster pace. I realize it is a large file, even though i down sized it by 30 gigs. But to those who are a fan of the smallville series and want a high quality print of all seasons, it is well worth the wait. Anyway, if those that download this and finish could help out by seeding a little for others, it would be greatly appreciated. I hope you all enjoy 10yrs worth of smallville.. :)   "

,fibreop,2013-06-02T08:50Z,"Great TV series, was a shame it ended how it did.  It could have went longer but you know... every TV series must come to an end.  Hopefully Coronation Street follows lol, because its bad! Anywho, A/V: 6/7
Taking a while to download because of bad seeders but will definitely seed after downloading. "
,Halloweenpsycho,2013-06-02T11:57Z,I couldn't agree more..lol..But i am hoping the man of steel will be as good. And thanks for seeding :) Take care.
