the least v can do to help him is not circulate this 1 on the forums/net so dat folks go to the theatre n pay for wotchin it so dat he gets back his investment.

V need to sacrifice dis much for such a talented actor/producer/director "

,nelofa29,2013-02-03T17:22Z,"@zyx55e dont be a emotional dumb ass , all movies recover their money even before they are released. They can stoop at any level to make you watch movie at inflated ticket rates. Go get a life...  "
,kindrudekid,2013-02-03T20:04Z,"@nelofa29 So fucking true!!!
its the distributors who are at loss! hell forget the distributors, they recover money like any STOCK exchange firms as they are dealing in many movies, the only loss they possibly can get is post release sales of DVD's etc, the biggest losers are Exhibitors like PVR and FAME  and even they have strategies to recover it, biggest which everyone knows: Steep prices of food inside! thats why the Hit and FLOX are always accompanied by BOX office sales!!! the ones that may pitch public interest! ever wonder why the broadcast or production companies never own a cinema? this is why! its same in hollywood too!"

,howdyk,2013-02-03T20:47Z,"I also saw on an India news channel that the Indian govt was not going to allow this ""blockbuster"" to be shown in the 500+ Indian theaters because of the threat of extremist Muslims threatening it's release.
If the director can't get it shown in India, I think he had bigger worries than a couple hundred free copies."
