When the beautiful Evie (Hannah Harper) fell in love with kamikaze firefighter Greg, she knew that there could come a time when he might not make it home. Forever running into fires without thinking. His luck was bound to run out soon. Not even his headstrong friend Chris, a heroic firefighter in his own right, could keep him from trying to kill himself. But when Greg selflessly runs into a fire to aid a downed comrade, Evie loses the only man she ever loved. Now Evie must rely on friends and the ghost of a love past to heal old wounds and allow herself to see the man that can bring passion back into her life again. Ablaze is the story of a love so strong it transcends the boundaries of life and death. A story of heroism, friendship and timeless, all-consuming passion. It's the story of believing that it's okay to want your heart to feel love, even if it means letting go of the past.
