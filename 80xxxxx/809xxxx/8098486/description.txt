SYPNOSIS:
May is the month dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary, mother of Christ. In Infanta, Quezon, locals turn each of the 31 days of May into a charming honor not only to celebrate good harvest in their agricultural setting, but also to pay tribute to t

he virginal virtues of the Mayohan. Every month of May, a padasal or series of novenas commences to mark the beginning of Mayohan. This will culminate in a Pasayaw or Tapusan in everyÂ purok of eachÂ barangay. Amidst the festivities, a 15-year old young outsider becomes the focal point in the preparation that the Pasayaw entails. As this grieving young man comes of age and deals with the recent loss of both parents, his attention shifts to Lilibeth, a 19-year old provincial lass, the elected presidenta of the pasayaw’s pamunuan, who, herself gets lost in the hoopla and hullabaloo that transpire before May ends.
