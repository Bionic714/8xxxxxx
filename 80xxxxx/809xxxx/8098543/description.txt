Book Description
50 Powerful, Easy-to-Use Rules for Supporting Hypergrowth in Any Environment

Scalability Rules is the easy-to-use scalability primer and reference for every architect, developer, web professional, and manager. Authors Martin L. Abbott and Michael T. Fisher have helped scale more than 200 hypergrowth Internet sites through their consulting practice. Now, drawing on their unsurpassed experience, they present 50 clear, proven scalability rulesΓÇôand practical guidance for applying them.

Abbott and Fisher transform scalability from a ΓÇ£black artΓÇ¥ to a set of realistic, technology-agnostic best practices for supporting hypergrowth in nearly any environment, including both frontend and backend systems.

For architects, they offer powerful new insights for creating and evaluating designs. For developers, they share specific techniques for handling everything from databases to state. For managers, they provide invaluable help in goal-setting, decision-making, and interacting with technical teams. Whatever your role, youΓÇÖll find practical risk/benefit guidance for setting prioritiesΓÇôand getting maximum ΓÇ£bang for the buck.ΓÇ¥

- Simplifying architectures and avoiding ΓÇ£over-engineeringΓÇ¥
- Scaling via cloning, replication, separating functionality, and splitting data sets
- Scaling out, not up
- Getting more out of databases without compromising scalability
- Avoiding unnecessary redirects and redundant double-checking
- Using caches and content delivery networks more aggressively, without introducing unacceptable complexity
- Designing for fault tolerance, graceful failure, and easy rollback
- Striving for statelessness when you can; efficiently handling state when you must
- Effectively utilizing asynchronous communication
- Learning quickly from mistakes, and much more

ΓÇ£Once again, Abbott and Fisher provide a book that IΓÇÖll be giving to our engineers. ItΓÇÖs an essential read for anyone dealing with scaling an online business.ΓÇ¥

ΓÇ£In The Art of Scalability, the AKF team taught us that scale is not just a technology challenge. Scale is obtained only through a combination of people, process, and technology. With Scalability Rules, Martin Abbott and Michael Fisher fill our scalability toolbox with easily implemented and time-tested rules that once applied will enable massive scale.ΓÇ¥

ΓÇ£An insightful, practical guide to designing and building scalable systems. A must-read for both product-building and operations teams, this book offers concise and crisp insights gained from years of practical experience of AKF principals. With the complexity of modern systems, scalability considerations should be an integral part of the architecture and implementation process. Scaling systems for hypergrowth requires an agile, iterative approach that is closely aligned with product features; this book shows you how.ΓÇ¥
