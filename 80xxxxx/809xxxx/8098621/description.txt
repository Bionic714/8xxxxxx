Summary:

The Wheel of Time turns and Ages come and go, leaving memories that become legend. Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth returns again. In the Third Age, an Age of Prophecy, the World and Time themselves hang in the balance. What was, what will be, and what is, may yet fall under the Shadow. - Goodreads Summary of The Eye of the World (Wheel of Time #1)

Note: This sequel is great and is recommended towards fantasy lovers, but is good for everyone! Plus, the book cover for A Memory of Light, book 14, is fan made (by me) using the real artwork made by the series artist and the basic cover design for all the other books. Put together using Adobe Photoshop CS6 Extended.
