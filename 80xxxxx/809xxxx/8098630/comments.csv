,Danuchiha99,2013-02-03T17:53Z,How's this version different from BOXZ's?
,bijwang,2013-02-03T18:12Z,^ Good question
,tflagger997,2013-02-15T00:09Z,Well for starters it is DTS 5.1 not 2.0.  It also claims to be a higher bitrate.  Of course BOTH are only 800p not 1080p.  So far only the 27GB version is true 1080p.
,tflagger997,2013-02-15T00:24Z,"It is not, but since Bozx is duping other's here on TPB (check the posted date and time), turn about is fair play.  Spectre07 was first with this version."
