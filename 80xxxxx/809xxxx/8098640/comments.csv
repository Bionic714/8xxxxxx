,faodgadfaewo,2013-02-10T20:50Z,"320 kbps? This??? Try opening this in Adobe Audition then compare it with a true 320 kbps, for god's sake. Either you have no clue what a true 320 kbps looks like, or you're just trying to dupe everyone. Quality of songs in this torrent is equal to 128 kbps at best, not to mention they actually have larger sizes than their proper 320 kbps versions. It's amazing how many seeders this torrent has..."
,puta_carai,2013-02-12T00:56Z,"@faodgadfaewo - I have bought this 320kbps album from MBV official site. Quality is EXACTLY SAME from all others torrents except I changed a 2MB art cover inside mp3 for a half sized and volume was normalized with NO loss of original quality. So, if you say it's 128kbps, better you write to My Bloody Valentine producers... "

lmao..... After deleting your torrent I downloaded a DIFFERENT torrent which also claims to be 320 kbps, and that one IS actually better than yours. That's why I knew the quality could be better than this. I wouldn't claim to be expert at music stuff, but I've been a serious music listener for years, and believe me, I wouldn't say something is bad if I can't verify that a better version of it exists. Anyway, in the end I deleted the second torrent as well, before downloading a FLAC version of the album then converted it to get my own 320 version. Like I said, try to grab a true 320 kbps and with Adobe Audition you'll see the difference between it and your upload.
With all that said, I'm aware that this is a free download of a new, popular album, and the right thing to do would be to buy it; besides, many casual listeners don't really care that much about what they listen to. Well ignorance is bliss. So this issue is not worth arguing over any further."
,puta_carai,2013-02-13T00:59Z,"@faodgadfaewo - As I said, I bought this MP3 directly from MBV website. Maybe it's not 320kbps (as they say in download page), maybe this another torrent you found was ripped from CD version... I don't know and it's not so important to me... Anyway, thanks for explanation."
