Installation Instruction

1. Extract Files to a folder. Ex: C:KMSNano, and Run KMSnano.exe with Admin Rights.

2. Run "Run Trigger.cmd" to install, or just KMSNano.exe for single activation
(TriggerKMS will run every boot, and if you have 30 days left or less, it will
re-run the activator)

3. Wait about 45-80secs while the files run in the background.
(It takes MUCH longer for Retail Office 2013 conversion - Up to 15 mins at most.
It doesn't let you know when it's done, you can check task manager or just wait)

4. Done. Run the Check_Activation_All.cmd to verify your activation status


                                 or

For Permanent activation follow this instruction

2. Go to the permanent folder and run the script: RunTrigger.cmd

3. Every 5 months it will automatic reactivate

In case you dont want activate one product use the arguments: /noWin, /no2010 and /no2013 arguments to KMSELDI.exe
and edit the Manual_Silent.cmd
