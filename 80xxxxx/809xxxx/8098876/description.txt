Drugs Inc
Drugs: A multi-billion-dollar industry that fuels crime and violence like no other substance on the planet. Turning cartel leaders into billionaires, the illegal drug industry also provides vital income to hundreds of thousands of poor workers across the globe. While some users sacrifice their lives to an addiction they can't escape, others find drugs to be their only saving grace from physical or emotional pain almost impossible to overcome. Where should the lines be drawn in this lucrative industry?
Pill Nation
Opiate pain pills are the drug of choice for the 21st century. Known as Hillbilly Heroin, they can be found in every town and city across the United States. From the poorest trailer home to the most expensive mansion, painkillers are tearing apart the fabric of American society. More people are addicted to these pills than to cocaine, heroin and crystal meth combined, and they're second only to traffic accidents as the leading cause of accidental death.
