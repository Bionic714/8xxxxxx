this is another of the Horror anthology comics from the golden age.  

2 things make this book noteworthy though:

1: many stories and art doen by Comics legends Joe Kubert and Wally Wood

2: #12 is the FIRST comic adaptation of Stoker's Dracula!


Please seed and enjoy

PS: The file is missing #13, otherwise this would be the complete run.  If anyone finds it let me know please!!!
