As for the Movie all I can say is that I am speechless. 

Truly the best 1 hour 60 minute cinematic experience of my life. Here I was thinking that the original was good, this is beyond good..this is the future of film making and the pinnacle of hollywood from which every single movie made after this day will be compared with. 

I cannot believe that a human brain is behind this truly astonishing piece of film making. The deep plot, the incredibly talented cast and to top it off that ending which really makes you rethink your entire life and everything you have ever stood for. 

Best movie for 2013 by far, just such a shame it is released so close to the Oscar and wont be nominated because it would have won in every single category except for ""best comedy"" because this is too good for it.

Highly recommend it. "
