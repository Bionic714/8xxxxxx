I enjoyed this particular track list so much that I decided to actually make it into a compilation album, and as requested, I am making it available. All files are 320kbps sourced from flac excepting the Ristorante Mixtape track because no high quality sources seem to exist for that album, so that one file is 192kbps. Enjoy~
