You have previously uploaded Hot Shots by Trooper and it contains four out of the five songs I like from them. It is missing ""3 dressed up as a 9"" from the Flying Colors album (also on The Best Of Trooper). If you can fill this request then thank you very much. Either way your uploads are great and it's a crying shame you can't download from iTunes in this kind of quality."
,SooperX77,2013-02-04T06:23Z,"In regards to my previous comment, 3 dressed up as a 9 is also on the bonus track edition of Hot Shots. Sorry for hi-jacking the comments for this torrent. "

Thanks for your kind comments"
,SooperX77,2013-02-05T04:29Z,Thanks! I'm looking forward to the upload.
