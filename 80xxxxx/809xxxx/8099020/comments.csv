[V],zyx55e,2013-02-04T07:14Z,"guyz, kamal hasan is almost broke by producing dis film. if it dosent sell he'll hv to sell even his house to repay his debtors. plus the courts hv stayed the rls of dis film too.

the least v can do to help him is not circulate this 1 on the forums/net so dat folks go to the theatre n pay for wotchin it so dat he gets back his investment.

V need to sacrifice dis much for such a talented actor/producer/director "
