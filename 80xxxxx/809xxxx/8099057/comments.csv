,miryag,2013-02-04T01:41Z,Audio/vid quality?
,DwnloadMe,2013-02-04T05:33Z,V7 A10 because of subtitles and fixed footage cheers
,freeegatee,2013-02-04T12:14Z,Thank you very much.
,vatel88,2013-02-04T18:38Z,Not understanding this fix footage thing because ITS NOT! the last of the movie is one frozen frame with audio playing underneath AKA NOT FIXED! AKA NOT WORTH DOWNLOADING! DO NOT DOWNLOAD IF YOU WANT TO SEE THE END OF THE MOVIE AND NOT JUST HEAR IT.
,poncie757,2013-02-04T18:50Z,"i saw this movie in the theater last night and let me tell you this movie is horrible.. the effects of the ""mama"" look like their straight out of 1998 and the end makes completly no sense what so ever ..thank for the effort as a always but save yourself time people ..i screamed GAY in the theater when it was over and got an applause lol"
,DwnloadMe,2013-02-04T19:56Z,"@ Vatel what you smoking. The footage isn't frozen, full video is there. Put the crack pipe down lol"
,mpenn20,2013-02-05T03:47Z,"V7A9. Thanks HeroMaster, good upload. There's no cinavia either.
The part where it was frozen on the original release was replaced with video from the cam copy that's floating around.  You can tell because the blurred watermark that's there throughout the movie disappears during that time plus the picture quality isn't as good and parts of the picture are cut.  Still good, thanks."
,mpenn20,2013-02-05T03:48Z,"lol which is what you meant when you said you fixed it with the matine 720p..whoops, my bad. definitely worth the download"

,EnemyDrone,2013-02-08T16:55Z,@poncie Movie is good ..if you would of screamed out gay in my theater I would of punched you!!! you must of seen it in a theater full of kids. Who claps because a moron screams out his sexuality?? as far as quality I would pass it is very choppy  like the Hobbit release. 
,vikingman11,2013-02-08T17:06Z,"A9/V8. Video has a slight jerkiness to it and hard subs, but very good resolution."
,Rickyfix,2013-02-09T04:00Z,"fliki567, AllDeer, Grimlix  to these mother fucker don't do not trust the pages that they say are a scam. Thanks for the movie."

,CRUICE_,2013-02-10T03:10Z,"Excellent COPY! they fixed the gap wher the screen is black by replacing it with part of a cam copy but that is only for a couple of minutes. The rest of the movie very good quality for a webrip. There are Asian subtitles throughout but you learn to ignore them.

Audio 7/10
Visual (majority) 8/10
Visual(minority) 5/10

This is watchable and it's a great movie. Don't be fooled.

Visual"
,goddamnbatman,2013-02-11T01:27Z,picture and audio freezes every few seconds.  is this happening to anyone else?
,strizbiz,2013-02-12T06:38Z,"thx for the ul, frame rate a little choppy, kinda got used to it after a while...  didnt really care so much for the ending of this one."
,Miki71,2013-02-12T17:53Z,"Boring movie!
If you want a good horror look Sinister!!!

"
,Sarom,2013-02-14T01:33Z,"A good fix but you lowered the quality a lot!
I found better to do myself the same edition you did."
,zeepman73,2013-02-14T05:17Z,"@amitmmmm
Yeah I want to give my credit card number to some bullshit site to ""verify"" me...fuck off"
,DrMD,2013-02-14T19:38Z,"A=8, V=7 Movie=8, It's not always very clear/sharp visually, video stutters occasionally and there are hard Japanese subs but a pretty good horror story.I'd look for more from 	Guillermo del Toro. http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0868219/"
,Hydraes,2013-02-17T19:37Z,thx you sir!
,vanilla38,2013-02-18T05:57Z,come on PPL almost 5000 Seeders and A/V ?
,.Hermit.,2013-02-18T22:54Z,Good movie. very watchable 
,RubenIH,2013-02-19T05:57Z,"This movie was garbage, i dont recommend it at all"
,quantump8,2013-02-21T06:01Z,"I don't normally comment. I have been here, on the bay, for a while. I can honestly say that this copy is sub par. While I appreciate the up and the work that goes into it, I just don't think it's worth it. I can handle cams, web rips, ect. But this pos is one of the worst copies I have ever seen. Video quality is ok but it stutters throughout the whole movie. And about the audio. I agree with others saying that the quality is about as good as a cam. I got about 30mins into it and had to turn it off. Like I said, I really appreciate the up by Hero and the hard work that goes into everything, it's just not worth it this time. "
,quantump8,2013-02-21T06:04Z,"Oh and
V: 4 for the skipping
A: 6 for the subs and bad quality"
,deanw0,2013-02-21T18:09Z,"rather wait for a decent dvdrip.
I don't reccomend this quality at all"
,uheardmebitch,2013-02-23T09:14Z,v-5 a-7 m= bad copy of the grudge. just watch the japanese original
,Kimmyme,2013-02-26T05:10Z,A lot of people saying this movie is horrible. I am a huge Horror fan and I thought it was pretty good! The ending sucked but most horror movies kinda do have a sucky ending which separates the Great horror flicks to the worth watching once horror flicks! Don't mind these people..Watch and and have your own opinion. You may want to wait for a DVD rip though because the dark scenes are the creepiest and you can't see them very well That is all :) Happy pirating!!
,xxjaretxx,2013-02-27T10:27Z,"Thanks abunch Man! Ive been around for years on TPB this is the first comment i have ever left. I am going to post this comment or one similar on all of the popular shows and movies I get. The MAIN REASON FOR MY POST IS I WANT TO TELL/REMIND EVERYONE THAT THE ""COPYRIGHT ALERT SYSTEM"" was launched yesterday. Most of the major isp's are involved, AT&T, TIME WARNER, VERIZON, and CABLEVISION, along with many others. SO GET BEHIND A VPN if you don't want your ISP dropping you for copyright infringement. Supposedly u get around 5 warnings then they drop you.  Just a friendly heads up to all you Pirates! here is a link to a news article about it, pretty basic column. :: http://news.yahoo.com/pirates-beware-industry-isps-launch-copyright-alert-system-000744092.html PROXY VPN or ""Borrow"" Wi-fi from the neighbors for your downloadingl I had a VPN in the past but it made my downloads drop DRASTICALLY so I currently looking for the best VPN or other option where I can maintain a decent speed. I appreciate the work you put into uploading, and the sourcing that goes into it. You seriously rock man, Keep up the Great work!"
,looneyk,2013-02-28T13:39Z,"id rather watch the chittiest cam @25 fps than any webrip that is ALWAYS jumpy and about 5fps and jumpy
