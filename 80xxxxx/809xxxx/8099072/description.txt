An eight-part series on the Roman Empire from the founding of the city through the Republic to the decline of the empire and the rise of Christianity.  The empire and its rulers are overly romanticized and no mention at all is made of the Jewish revolts.  You'll see some exciting scenes of gladiatorial combat but not enough coverage is given to its more barbaric aspects like Jews and Christians (who at the time considered themselves Jews) being thrown to lions for popular entertainment.  If you come to the series knowing something about the real Roman Empire, you will both learn and be entertained.  Not bad for a documentary.
