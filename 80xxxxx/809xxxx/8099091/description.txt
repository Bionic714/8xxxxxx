ISBN: 1591844835 | 2012 | EPUB

To Steve Jobs, Simplicity was a religion. It was also a weapon.

Simplicity isnΓÇÖt just a design principle at AppleΓÇöitΓÇÖs a value that permeates every level of the organization. The obsession with Simplicity is what separates Apple from other technology companies. ItΓÇÖs what helped Apple recover from near death in 1997 to become the most valuable company on Earth in 2011.

Thanks to Steve JobsΓÇÖs uncompromising ways, you can see Simplicity in everything Apple does: the way itΓÇÖs structured, the way it innovates, and the way it speaks to its customers.

ItΓÇÖs by crushing the forces of Complexity that the company remains on its stellar trajectory.
