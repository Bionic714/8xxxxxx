,tsro,2013-02-04T21:21Z,"Hey SoniStreet, thanks a lot for uploading these, I was super excited to see them here. One thing that I noticed was the 3rd game of each set is only ~0:18 to ~0:50 seconds long, usually only showing the GSL intro. I hope you don't take this as a complaint, I just figured I'd let you know in case you weren't aware, and I'm naturally curious to know what's up with the 3rd games on all the groups. Thanks again, though."
,tsro,2013-02-04T21:57Z,"Scratch that last comment, I see my error now. The only time the third game is only ~18 seconds long is when the score is 2-0 and a third game isn't required. Seems obvious now, my mistake.

I'm guessing you did that so that playlists would play more seemlessly?"
,SoniStreet,2013-02-04T22:51Z,"It's so that they stay spoiler-free. Have this scenario as an example:

You open the 1st folder and you see 3 files, you watch the game and INnoVation wins a game against a Stephano, now it's 1-0. If there were only 2 files you would know INnoVation won 2-0, but since there are 3 files you are not 100% sure and Stephano might come back with 2-1.

This is the same reason the winner and looser brackets don't have names on the folders, so you won't know who won and who lost in the 1st rounds.

Of course if you slide your eyes a bit and check out the file size you will still know if it's a placeholder or not. But if you are hardcore about spoiler free content then this is a handy feature."
,tsro,2013-02-04T23:10Z,"You really thought of everything, brilliant. I can't thank you enough."
,SoniStreet,2013-02-04T23:35Z,"I do not rip or pack this ones my self :) I was merely explaining the reasoning behind it, and you are welcome."
,trilllo,2013-02-05T06:57Z,Thank you very much sir.  All the uploads are greatly appreciated!
