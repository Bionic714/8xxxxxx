              "Save the Children! The Crew Start to Fight"

Summary:
     Nami's group who escaped the prison cell end up in the Biscuits Room, where they find giant children. The children play with Chopper and Franky for a moment, but are scared when the samurai head asks if they have seen a boy named Momonosuke. The hazmat suit soldiers arrive and attempt to capture Nami's group, and the pirates run away. Meanwhile, Usopp makes a banana boat so Luffy's group can get across from the fire side of Punk Hazard to the snow side of the island. The centaur who Luffy beat earlier sees them, and tells his boss that the Straw Hats are heading to the snow part of Punk Hazard. Back to the mysterious facility, Nami's group decide to stay and save the children, and defeat the hazmat suit soldiers. Meanwhile, on the frozen side of the island Brook is building snowmen and is suddenly attacked by the samurai's torso just after his snowmen are complete.
