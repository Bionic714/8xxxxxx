,light_down,2013-02-03T20:27Z,"Hi HeroMaster. My AV tells me the executable is infected with Ciffrax (or smth. similar). I know your torrents are clean, and theta never made my AV freak out before, so can you confirm the file is clean?"
[V],HeroMaster,2013-02-03T20:36Z,"@light_down I tested it and it was clean as a fiddle, I always say disable your antivirus and block firewall, after that enjoy playing :)"
,light_down,2013-02-03T20:45Z,showing comments.
,light_down,2013-02-03T20:46Z,"Ok, thank you very much."
,arn420,2013-02-03T22:46Z,"This proteus.exe infected with malware. @light_down you were right about that,even Kaspersky detected it.I don't believe Hero.So I run those exe files in linux with wine.Fuck those people who made that exe file,they can zipped or rar it but they do it intentionally.We can't blame theta because he/they made only crack which is clean."
,sati777,2013-02-03T23:38Z,"fuckin idiots, ofc your av says its virus because the industry don't want you to crack the game"
,NotAnAltA,2013-02-04T00:42Z,"The torrent downloaded fine, but when I opened up the game, I could hear familiar proteus music, but nothing came out visually. It was just a black screen. Help?"
,7Rafe7,2013-02-04T00:47Z,"the Proteus.exe is the installer/crack. After it installs the game you can just use the shortcut from your start menu.

If you get alerts or warnings from your AV its either doing that because this file isn't used very much on the web and unknown or because it's a crack.

Btw if you like the game go buy it on their site it's only $10.00 USD"
,ijam_j,2013-02-04T00:49Z,"theta release(installer) is always flagged as virus. so far, i cant find traces of harmfull process. nevertheless, i would recommend to install using sandboxie and then copy the installed app to your common games directory. the games are clean. its the installer."
,hollisb,2013-02-04T04:21Z,The game works fine on Windows 7 64bit - no problems what-so-ever. Great game btw. Big ups.
[M],slih,2013-02-04T11:54Z,Checked. Installer is clean.
,athina1008,2013-02-04T12:09Z,Thanks Hero!!!
,nozo123,2013-02-04T18:02Z,"This ""game"" thing is wierd"
,vinivitesmw456,2013-02-08T00:02Z,Amazing game. Messes up with the vague art of gaming and I loved that. Really inspiration to my gaming and game development career. I'll surely buy it later!
,dalmasca,2013-03-02T13:21Z,"my norton 2010 didn't detect as virus. usually it's bit picky, but not with this one.

anyway, the game is good but too short, only 4 season and my eyes closed again. 
perhaps because I walked rush without enjoying scenery, lol."
,josepheb2,2013-03-05T19:36Z,"i'm running windows 8 64 bit when i try to run nothing happens when i run !!!Mreader.exe i it starts up with the music the scrolling credits and a bouncing ball that's it..also the install steps say ""unrar"" but there's no rar file. i really have no idea what the Mreader is or how to use it....so what am i doing wrong?"
,josepheb2,2013-03-05T19:37Z,"""edit"" when i try to run Proteus.exe noting happens"
,josepheb2,2013-03-05T20:12Z,got it! i sear bitdefender was made by nazis 
,247amt,2013-05-15T07:06Z,This is pretty nice. It's sort of like an Atari version of Nature Treks. I might buy it. 
,Im4Hero,2013-06-02T03:06Z,It's starting on 1366x778. My screen can't suport that... What a shame... Can we start the game with a lower resolution?
,Im4Hero,2013-06-02T03:49Z,Well... Don't answer my question. I have brought the game.
