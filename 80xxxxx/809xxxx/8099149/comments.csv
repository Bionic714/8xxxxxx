I was hoping you could help me!! 

What program do u use to convert videos to PS3. I've been wanting to send my bro some movies/tv shows & he only has a PS3 to watch videos (no dvd player). 

I really appreciate your time & expertise with this."
,NuBatman,2013-02-06T00:59Z,"What I currently use is meGUI. And the best place to find how to compress is YouTube. The current build is pretty good. Not sure on where I downloaded it, but it does do it's job. I also use Freemake, but the quality is not the greatest."
,NordicF1,2013-02-06T17:47Z,"Try this program

,NordicF1,2013-02-06T17:48Z,Just install and use the key to register. The program has its own PS3 converter.

,mediumspiny,2013-02-20T18:39Z,I've watched the first two episodes and in both the sound stops about 1 minute before the end. Very annoying.

Not bad, I'll seed until 6/1 .

,NuBatman,2013-04-13T01:41Z,"Forgot to mention that I have been back up for the last 2 weeks. Limited my upload speed to 200k. If people need it faster, just let me know."
