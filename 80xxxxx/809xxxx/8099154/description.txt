17 Wii games in less than 8 gigabytes worth of space! These are all full games ripped from wii disks and converted into the .wbfs format. These games will run on a real wii or in the dolphin emulator. These are quality games, don't let the small size fool you. Here is a good mix of action, adventure, puzzle, racing, shooting, platform, sports and party type games, so there is something for everyone here. Many of these games support 2 to 4 players. So if you want the most amount of fun for your 8gig flash drive or sd card, or if you are just looking to bulk up your existing collection without sucking up all your bandwidth, then download this torrent and get ready to play. There is no need to use a special game manager or archive software either, all the converting is already done for you. Just drop the contents of the 8gb Wii folder into your wbfs folder on the root of your usb or sd, fire up your backup loader of choice and start playing. That or leave them where you saved them and play them in the dolphin emulator. None of these games require special controllers or attachments other than the wiimote and sometimes the nunchuk.
