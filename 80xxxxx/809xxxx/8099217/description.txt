FUBAR DeskFiller 2013
---------------------

A new version of this annoying little application!

This application will flood the users desktop with hundreds and hundreds of small and useless files.

Whenever any user logs into Windows, this application will run.
It will create a random amount of files; between 32 and 600. And then it will force a logout of Windows.

Windows will effectively become useless, and all users will be prevented from logging into the system.
Furthermore, the desktop will have so many files, that Windows will stop responding - preventing the user from deleting the files.


As always, there is a way to remove the application:

1. Boot up in Safe-Mode.

2. Open the Registry Editor (regedit.exe).

3. Browse to this key:
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Run

4. Delete the value named "FUBAR DeskFiller 2013".


Although this application can be quite easily removed, the user will have plenty of "fun" trying to clean up the desktop...
