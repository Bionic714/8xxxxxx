There is no screen text showing the locations, so the subs try to show that text AND what is being said at the same time, resulting in confusion and words disappearing before you get a chance to read them.  I'm sure in theaters, the text was there, so I guess we'll have to wait for one that shows this information and is not part of the subs files."
