The film focusses on the life of Vinayan (Manoj K. Jayan), a teenager who has got a male physique but female emotions which leads to ridicule, shame and snide remarks from his siblings and others. The film brings out the rituals, customs, angst and preferences of transgender people. The title of the film alludes to the half male and half female Hindu god Ardhanarishvara. Also starring in the film are Maniyanpilla Raju, Thilakan, Sukumari and Saikumar. It was one of the last films featuring Thilakan who died weeks before the release of the film.

The film opened to mixed critical reviews but the performance by Manoj K. Jayan as a eunuch gained unanimous appreciation. It is widely considered as one of the finest performances by the actor.
