A really great game. Beautiful-looking and very entertaining.
I went through it with gusto on the Windoze version of it until almost 3/4, when the owner of the PC laptop that I had borrowed reclaimed her machine and with it the last unplayed quarter of King's Bounty.
My Game-Blueballs thank you vastly for this chance at finding resolution.

,CHibizoid,2013-03-06T15:08Z,"THE GOOD PART: (^_^)
Everything worked perfectly, the download and the installation. And indeed it is a native Mac version, but I'm having a problem with the graphics.
THE BAD PART: (Y_Y)
Everything looks perfect except all the creatures (friends and foes alike) are invisible. You can see their armours and various accoutrements floating in the air, but no living character is visible.
I tried playing about with the graphic options, including switching resolution to all settings, but to no avail.

Any ideas?

My sys-specs are:
OS: 10.8.2 Mountain Lion
iMac 21.5-inch, Late 2012
Processor: 2.7 GHz Intel Core i5
Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GT 640M 512 MB

Thanks for any help and still thanks loads for the upload!"
