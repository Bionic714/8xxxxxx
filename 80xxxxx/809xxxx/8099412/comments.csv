,froogAL,2013-02-09T00:54Z,"Taste in both movies and music provides constant confusion for me.  I've heard albums which initially disappointed and later became favorites.  I avoid listening to music which sounds really awful because I'm afraid I might start to like it.  Familiarity is a factor.  Movies are even more inscrutable..I pretty much ignore all movie recommendations and trust my own instincts instead.  TO THE POINT:

This album is not as great IMO (new IMO) as my comment indicates....call it Schizo-taste  

TRUST YOUR OWN EYES AND EARS!  Don't let anyone tell you what you're supposed to like"
