This highly harmonious sextet album is available from other torrent sites but the

27 year old Chet Baker and 31 year old Art Pepper are in such good form together here

that their work warrants greater availability.


Oftentimes musicians do their best work at a young age and arguably these 2 along

with tenorist Richie Kamuca have done that here.  The reed harmony is super-tight


West Coast at it's best....liner commentary included
