Brazil has outdated technology and my upload bandwidth is limited to 140kps at the most. So if you can, help your fellow enthusiasts and give them a lending hand as they scale this mount.
Valeu !!!!"

There are a lot of people seeding at the moment so lets keep this momentum and help each other out. My laptop runs through the night seeding.
