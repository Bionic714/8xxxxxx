Jeff and Jeannie live in a high-rise apartment building in the inner city. They've chased their careers and lived on take-out food, keeping almost no food in their apartment.

That is...until Jeannie reads a news article about storing food for emergencies. One thing leads to another and she starts learning how to cook, and her husband buys some precious metals, a campstove and fuel, and other supplies.

When Jeff and Jeannie discovered prepping they didn't realize how little time was left. Will the preps they were able to make in the short time they had keep them alive when an EMP, followed by nukes, hits the city? Will they live long enough to escape the city?

Based on a real-life couple, friends of the author, who found their way into preparedness from the same background of not having food in the house or knowing how to cook. Many find it hard to believe that not only are there people who don't know how to cook, but some don't even keep those handy frozen meals in their homes, or any other foods. It's estimated that most people are just a few meals away from starvation if supplies disappear. Please don't be one of them!
