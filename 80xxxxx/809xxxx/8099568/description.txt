During my 17 birthday, I came closer to the Lord.  On April 28th I came to Him and said, "Lord, I feel so bad, I know that I'm a sinner," and I told Him how I felt.  "Lord, forgive me.  I want You to write my name in the Book of Life and to accept me as Your child."  I repented and gave back my life to the Lord.  I said, "Lord, I want You to change me, to make a difference in me." I cried with all my heart, asking the Lord to change me.  But, as time passed by I felt no change.  The only difference was that I began to attend church, to read the Bible and to pray.  That was the only change in my life.
