"Always Know What To Say" is for anyone who wants a straight to the point explanation of conversation skills fundamentals. I point out key distinctions you can apply right away to go from being tongue tied and unsure of what to say to having fun meeting people and getting to know them better. If you read AND apply what I cover in the book you`ll make steady progress and become much more at ease talking to people.

This book is not for you if you already have very good conversation skills and are comfortable meeting new people and letting your personality shine. You need to go elsewhere if you are looking for "secrets" and advanced strategies to achieve conversation skills mastery. You`ll regard this book as common sense.

And finally, this book is not for you if you read self help books and disregard the training because you`ve read something similar before and never apply what you learn. You`ll tell yourself you knew it all already.

You`ll gain a lot from "Always Know What To Say" if you treat it as a set of principles and strategies you get to play with in the real world. This is not light entertainment, its practical training that`s designed for you to use in your day to day life. If you do you`ll enjoy the happiness and warmth that comes from connecting with the important people in your life whether that be in your family and community or at work.
