I dug jazz for 2 decades before I even heard of the super talented Shirley

Horn.  It's a special group that can deliver expressive vocals and tasty

piano accompaniment at the same time.  Diana Krall, Ray Charles and not that many 

others are on the short list.  Certainly many pop artists do this but their

piano playing is generally less sophisticated both rhythmically and harmonically.


Guitar bass is used here.  It allows unusually long sustain.  Horn is a master

of musical silence.


Guest musicians include Miles Davis, Wynton Marsalis, Branford Marsalis and 

Toots Thielemans.  Their participation attests to Shirley Horn's status

in the jazz music world.
