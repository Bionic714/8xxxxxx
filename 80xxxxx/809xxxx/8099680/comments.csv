It was the fourth straight win for the Celtics since Rajon Rondo suffered a torn ACL, with all of the wins coming at the TD Garden. Pierce scored 15 of his team-high 22 points for the hosts in the second half, as the Celtics held off a furious comeback from the shorthanded Clippers, who were without Chris Paul (knee) for the seventh straight games. Eric Bledsoe had a game-high 23 points and 10 assists in the setback. It was the Clippers' second straight loss overall"
