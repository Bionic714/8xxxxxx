Originally released in 2011 in a massive, expensively package deluxe release in celebration of Alice Cooper's induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, Old School is a four disc CD set consisting of a wealth of very rare recordings of the original incarnation of the group (before the name Alice Cooper became synonymous with the band's lead singer Vincent Furnier), never before heard demo tracks, vintage radio promos, live performances, recording sessions, interviews and an entire Killer era live album.

Although this is the 2012 scaled down, price reduced issue of the original box set (completely lacking the original set's DVD and physical goodies), it's still very much a pretty cool companion piece to AC's first box set "The Life and Crimes of Alice Cooper", released back in 1999.

All four discs were ripped in EAC and encoded in FLAC from the original CDs. Also included is a high quality scan of the set's cover.

This set is a real treat towards die hard Alice Cooper fans and listeners of good ol' Classic Rock in general who are curious to hear an in-depth evolution of one of the genre's more underrated heroes.
