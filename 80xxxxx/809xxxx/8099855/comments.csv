Great, I love having to convert every show to a different codec because FoV is the only release group to use a format the WDTV Media Player doesn't recognise. Looks like Handbrake is going to get a workout this season."

,goodprick,2013-02-08T01:45Z,"evilgOd: My WDTV plays mp4 no problem, you must have an old version, maybe an update would cure it.. Thanks eztv"
,ihud,2013-02-10T00:08Z,Awesome!! Thanks eztv 
,evilg0d,2013-02-10T04:50Z,"goodprick: It has never had an issue with any media including multiple sources of mp4 other than FoV releases. I can find no reason for it. When I run their files through Handbrake keeping them as normal mp4s they work fine.
Thanks for the update suggestion though. Last month's firmware update fixed it."
