Here is the ENGLISH (UK English, to be precise) service manual for the Toyota Corolla. I couldn't find the specific model years covered, but it looks like it covers pretty much everything up to 2002. If somebody has more accurate model years that are covered by this manual, please comment below. From the first page of the manual;
