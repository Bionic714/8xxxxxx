Here is an installer I made for KMSnano v19.1
It lets you choose directory and will automatically install the trigger
and monitor activation. It displays some basic info for people during
install.

File: KMSNano_v19.1-Installer.exe
Size: 30.1MB
CRC32: 99A8141E
MD5: 1E8C360E337F3317D043FEF43A75407A
SHA-1: 0F393DE561D5F762DD438DFD6A897DD26AA53557

What it does is extract KMSnano v19.1 to a directory that you specify.
Then it runs a modified RunTrigger.cmd that installs the
TriggerKMS to monitor activation every boot. Since TriggerKMS install
also runs the activator if necessary, it will monitor activation
programs and let you know when they've stopped running and where
your installed files are. I know it's redundant to show where you
installed the files after you just selected a destination, but this is
meant to help people who don't understand very much.

When you run this installer, it will install the TriggerKMS scheduled
task into the task scheduler to check every boot if your activation
needs re-activating for Windows or Office.

It runs the same KMSnano.exe from the normal release. I didn't modify
any file except the RunTrigger.cmd

Note that I did not write any of the activation coding.
