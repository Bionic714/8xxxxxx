For his new album, Tomorrowland, Ryan Bingham ditched his label and his band. HeΓÇÖs also ditched the hard-worn sensitivity of ΓÇ£The Weary Kind,ΓÇ¥ his breakthrough Oscar-winning song penned for Crazy Heart. This time around, Bingham, like some kind of commercial for the authenticity-craving Americana fanbase, embraces a louder, more aggressive sound that leans more towards rock than country.
Tomorrowland, the first record Bingham recorded on his own label and has had full creative control of, finds the Texas songwriter shedding his country-leaning sound and arrangements while holding onto his well worn country tropes and themes. This may be due to the absence of The Dead Horses, his longtime backing band, but the results of this new direction can be off-putting. ΓÇ£Guess WhoΓÇÖs KnockingΓÇ¥ is more Kid Rock than Kris Kristofferson and sounds like country cock-rock, as Bingham sings in the songΓÇÖs supposed payoff, ΓÇ£itΓÇÖs me motherfucker, IΓÇÖm knocking at the doorΓÇ¥ over and over.

Mostly, though, Tomorrowland doesnΓÇÖt grate as much as it excludes. If Bingham now feels free to shed the genre limitations and expectations of Americana-leaning alt-country, heΓÇÖs also lost his many of his songwriting hooks along the way. ΓÇ£Hallelujah,ΓÇ¥ from 2010ΓÇ▓s Junky Star, was a song sung by a distanced dead man, a man staring down at life wondering why heΓÇÖs never felt more alive. ItΓÇÖs the type of song most songwriters would give anything to write. The songs here, the stories and sounds, donΓÇÖt reach out and grab in the way that BinghamΓÇÖs best songs hook the listener at first listen. If being Lost Highway RecordsΓÇÖ hard-traveling, rough-singing outlaw country poster boy was a bit much for Bingham, heΓÇÖs thrown away the parts that image so appealing and so damn convincing, while holding on to many of its tired cliches.

Bingham is pissed and preaching, yelling about money and hard times. These are well-worn themes for Bingham, one of the few country songwriters insistent on foregrounding class and economics throughout his career, so they donΓÇÖt sound as forced as they would from nearly any other songwriter. Still, ΓÇ£Rising of The GhettoΓÇ¥ is a bit hard to take, like a call to arms without a clear audience.

Several other songs are nice, standard fare for Bingham. ΓÇ£Flower BombΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£Never Far BehindΓÇ¥ would fit in nicely on Junky Star, but a few hard-to-take missteps, and a too-long running length of 62 minutes all amount to being BinghamΓÇÖs weakest album to date. Bingham sings that heΓÇÖs ΓÇ£forever traveling this road IΓÇÖm on,ΓÇ¥ but on Tomorrowland itΓÇÖs unclear why we should still travel with him.
