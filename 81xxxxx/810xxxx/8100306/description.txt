"Seven Pines," the highlight from young acoustic guitarist Daniel Bachman's debut LP, opens quietly as he winds through his licks with the slow sort of reverie suited for an early fall afternoon. But this is a tune of steady escalation, where the sounds pile upon each other in deliberate phases. The process creates a strangely meditative tension, causing the listener to wait anxiously for the next elaborate gesture but allowing time to revel in the quality and crispness of Bachman's playing, too. But Bachman knows that any good resolution requires a denouement: After the strings reach their most feverish whir, Bachman eases off again, settling into the same drift that set up the plot in the first place. Thanks to a geographical kinship, Bachman-- a Virginia native who wrote his debut record in Philadelphia-- will likely soon tire of comparisons to Jack Rose, the late guitarist who also called both of those places home. Given the strength of this audacious piece, however, he's starting to earn them.
