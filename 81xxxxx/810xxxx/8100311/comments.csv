,IamBMW,2013-02-04T04:01Z,THANK YOU!!!!!! Love this show!
,beechyboy,2013-02-04T04:24Z,"This show took a lot of effort for me to get.
The quality is amazing for a webrip.
It's as good a any HDTV show.

Enjoy...."
,q2323,2013-02-04T12:43Z,Thank you very much. I loved American Digger :)
,Majty,2013-02-04T14:40Z,"I hope he has stopped his ""BOOOOM BABY!"". Thats the most annying thing about the previous series anyways. Thanks for sharing! :)"
,beechyboy,2013-02-04T18:27Z,"Nope....
Rick still says ""BOOOOM.... Baby !!! when he finds big items or when he blows up stuff.
It's pretty much the same as American Diggers except Rick has his wife and two boys working instead of the two hired workers. "
,studentofmonth,2013-02-08T13:31Z,"Thanks again BeechyBoy! I was surprised to see this torrent, since it seemed like it was unavailable. You found it and graciously uploaded it! Great!

PS, after each episode last season I kept promised myself I would never watch it again. But here I am... Something addictive about this trainwreck of a show (no offense to those whose nerves are not grated by it)."
,q2323,2013-02-08T14:46Z,studentofmonth: I am addicted to these stupid fake reality shows just like you. cant wait for new episode :D
,dravid5,2013-02-09T05:27Z,"very nice,thank you...will wait for more form you :P"
,beechyboy,2013-02-10T17:02Z,"Feb. 10 - Episode #3 just uploaded.

Enjoy!"
,MyDigger,2013-03-25T15:56Z,Does anyone know if there is a good torrent for all of Season 1? I just found this show a few weeks ago and would love to have them all. Getting them one by one has turned into a major task.
,MyDigger,2013-03-25T15:57Z,I also wanted to say THANK YOU to beechboy! If you have all of those episodes and will make a Season 1 torrent I will help you seed.
