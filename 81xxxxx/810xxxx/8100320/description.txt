Here is the entire hardbass videostreams

Some parts in the videos are laggy because the
stream wasnt always stable, and when noisecontrollers
played some dubstep the stream got some "technical problems"

And the parts with Headhunterz was cutted out by B2S, bacause he played new tracks
"only for hardbass"

I recorded everything in 720P, but that wasnt always stable

But i recorded the whole 7 hours of hardbass including

Gunz4Hire Live

B-freqz   Live

Headhunterz Live

Noisecontrollers Live (some parts of it)


The only thing i didnt recorded was the Warm Up by Dj LUNA


ENJOY AND PLEASE SEED
