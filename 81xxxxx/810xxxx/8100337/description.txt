'The Dreaming Fields', Matraca BergΓÇÖs last album, was awash with wry themes such as the one in ΓÇÿYour HusbandΓÇÖs Cheating On Us.ΓÇÖ Berg is a woman who finds common ground in the experiences of so many other females from all walks of life, as well as a dedication to her Tennessee roots. But she also dips intrepidly into solemn waters as the mother/narrator in ΓÇÿSouth of Heaven', a song about the horrors of battle. 

By 22 she had already garnered a Grammy nomination and achieved a #1 hit. Now she has returned to the studio with 'LoveΓÇÖs Truck Stop'. The sensitive singer songwriter tells simple, but relatable stories with instrumentation that never overrides the message.

The first song, ΓÇÿLoveΓÇÖs Truck StopΓÇÖ, brings out her brightest vocals. BergΓÇÖs style shuffles between a cavalier Rickie Lee Jones and a winsome Trisha Yearwood. ΓÇÿHer Name is Mary,ΓÇÖ ΓÇ£with maraschino cherry-colored hair/Has the scripture tattooed on her chest/The one that her grandma loved best,ΓÇ¥ shows off her innate wit.

You can hear the plaintive black hills in the strum and tearful vocals of ΓÇÿBlack RibbonsΓÇÖ.

The allegorical ΓÇÿFoolish FlowerΓÇÖ speaks to the torment endured by out-of-place souls. ΓÇÿWeΓÇÖre Already GoneΓÇÖ is a tender ballad about bidding farewell: ΓÇ£ WinterΓÇÖs been hanging around too long.ΓÇ¥

The surprisingly bluesy ΓÇÿI Buried Your Love AliveΓÇÖ is understated, but a far cry from the other mostly Americana styled tracks. The austere finger picking of ΓÇÿMagdaleneΓÇÖ accompanies a quizzical sentiment. ΓÇÿMy Heart Will Never Break This Way AgainΓÇÖ is heartbreaking, yet amazingly hopeful. 

The heaving blues harp of ΓÇÿSad Magnolia,ΓÇÖ with its stunning lyrics of ΓÇ£Wish you were mine/Underneath the moon of CarolineΓÇªΓÇ¥, convey a dreamy spirit, and even when Berg tackles the proverbial travelling song she stamps out a highly charged show on her mournful rendition of ΓÇÿWaiting on a Slow TrainΓÇÖ. 

The closer 'Fistful of Roses' is the one piano-driven cut. With lyrics like ΓÇ£Fistful of roses/Handful of thorns/Chiseled in stone/The day you were bornΓÇ¥, Berg solidifies any notion that sheΓÇÖs a natural born storyteller.
