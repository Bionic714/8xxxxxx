,Benson,2013-02-07T18:37Z,Thank you very much! This is the best upload I  have seen so far. Best Regards
,cetme308,2013-02-12T01:47Z,If I come across those I'll be sure to include them...
,Gusar19,2013-02-13T04:29Z,thanks great collection
,Dorkko59,2013-02-20T17:29Z,No one can seriously doubt the benefits to humanity resulting from the widespread dissemintation of health and medical information.  Power to you brother.   Those who bought the books before (libraries and physicians) will continue to do so.  I can imagine the great joy seeing such a collection brings to the heart of physicians working in third-world countries.
,The_TeX,2013-02-22T22:20Z,You wouldn't happen to have a the 33rd ed of Washington manual would you?
,3echo0,2013-02-23T13:58Z,Thx a lot!

,anitiachick,2013-03-03T23:48Z,"You are a Saint !!!  Thanks - nice, broad coverage of topics, including specialties, dentistry, research. I will seed from my seedbox as long as possible, but can everyone else please seed for a long while, too? My utorrent seedbox is in Europe, but ftp downloading from there to south america takes forever, and I need to clear space."

,xlivingaliex7,2013-03-13T01:45Z,"cetme308, 

might be an irrational question, but do you have a list of all the books as part of the 300 gigs that you uploaded? Are any of these review books for 3rd year medical school, like pretest, case files, blue prints? 

Thanks!! "
,Dorkko59,2013-03-15T01:18Z,"xlivingaliex7,  I'm too dumb for med school but my guess is if its not in the National Library of Medicine you won't find it here. :)  Seriously, I seen some stuff scattered throughout.  Not much percentage wise but maybe it adds up to a lot.  Try Part 15 first.   "
,cetme308,2013-03-15T23:56Z,"Wow, I never expected this to be so popular!  As I said in a comment on a different part, I posted these to get them to a doctor friend halfway around the world...   

I'm not a doc, so I haven't looked too closely at the content and I wouldn't know what 3rd year med student would need.

I'm still in the process of acquiring these e-books so I don't have a complete listing yet.  The parts a more or less alphabetical with the A's in part one and now part 19 is in the P's, so that will roughly help you correlate e-book title to part #."
,dimofo,2013-03-26T20:36Z,"why didn't you just upload as one big torrent? let everyone choose the files they want.

meh...it's all good bro cheers"
,merj,2013-04-09T07:14Z,Is there a list of books for each torrent? Greatly appreciate your efforts!
,cetme308,2013-04-19T01:37Z,"The final part has been uploaded (26)...  Enjoy!

I don't have the time or desire to make a list of all the files - it's not that hard to open the torrents and look at the file list...

I didn't upload as one torrent for 2 reasons.  
-I started uploading before I had acquired all the files.
-My upload speed is not the fastest and I figured the smaller parts would be more manageable and I could get some healthy/complete torrents going sooner.

Seems to be working ok - after I completed seeding a torrent, there were generally 15-30 seeders to keep it going.  This one is 2 months old and going strong...

If someone wants to merge them all into one big torrent, feel free.  If I get really bored I may do it, but not likely - for some reason my seeding speed has been very inconsistent the last week or 2 and I don't know why yet..."
,LightRebellion,2013-04-21T08:20Z,"My connection is very slow (around 100kbps), otherwise I would download them all and do this myself, but I would love to see this all separated into the individual sections of medicine they represent and re-uploaded. :)"
,cetme308,2013-04-22T09:27Z,"If I get bored, that might be a project for the future..."
