[V],psspss,2013-02-04T11:22Z,"of course it never prove if a bigger power was behind the shooting or brainwashing or hired killer
or aided etc so there will always be a conspiracy there but the new docu from Dec 2012 did prove it was one shooter (i thought) new details new footage and angles and witnesses and the traffic light and tree changes"
,bubbanuggzz,2013-02-05T07:26Z,"thanx man.I haven't watched it yet but when it comes to JFK they keep trying to de-bunk it but no matter how good a shooter is he can't shoot form three differant angles at one time.the first after death report from the med was three entry wounds,two from the right & one from the left.the one on the left clearly coming from a lower angle than the two on the right.wether it was the mob,the Russians or the US government their was two shooters as far as I'm conserned"
[V],psspss,2013-02-05T08:49Z,"all angels are clearly revealed in the new docu
again watch the lost bullet

i used to believe shame as everyone until I saw that
now i believe the initial findings

and one shooter is possible"
[V],psspss,2013-02-05T08:50Z,opps same not shame :)
