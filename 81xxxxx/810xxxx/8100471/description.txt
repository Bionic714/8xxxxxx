I wonderk, is it really a TV show?&gt;

For XVID AVI with MP3 audio, I'd give NetFlix a solid:
V=8
A=8
.
They call 'em chapters - I call 'em too lazy to think of episode titles.
.
A NetFlicks Original Series at exactly 30fps.
And such an odd aspect ratio (after removing letterboxing).
Halfway betwixt and between. Too short for regular widescreen.
Only half wide enough for vista-pana-anna-morph.
What's not to love? Just show me the bandwagon and I'm jumping on!
