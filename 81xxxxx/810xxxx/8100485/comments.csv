Colin Murray introduces highlights from the day's Premier League matches. Roberto Mancini's Manchester City host Brendan Rodgers' Liverpool, with the Reds looking for a better performance than they managed on their previous two Premier League visits to the Etihad, which both resulted in 3-0 defeats.

In the day's other game, Spurs travel to West Bromwich Albion, with boss Andre Villas Boas harbouring unhappy memories of his last Premier League trip to the Hawthorns; it proved to be his final game in charge of Chelsea.

There is also a chance to see all of the goals from Saturday's games."
