,XPurple,2013-02-05T01:02Z,"Thank you so much for uploading this, I had been waiting for so long, One of my favorite movies of the year. I plan to seed to ~x10"
,bandwagon,2013-02-05T04:33Z,"Are there really 1041 seeders? This torrent is slow as hell! 

Thanks to BOZX for the wonderful upload, anyway!"
,Magnus314,2013-02-07T12:08Z,"The subtitle  that dududus links to, what is it with the download there?
The sub download is a program file.

Seems very suspicious that you have to download a program just for subtitles.
I mean, its the old trick of spreading viruses.

I see it is at opensutitles.org, which sounds like something legit (open and all). Why the h-ll do they choose to have the subtitles in programfiles?
Do they install something like a toolbar, ads or the like along with the subtitles?
Can't see not other reason otherwise not to do what the other subtitle sites do. Just give you  the .srt or .sub files (which really are just fancy text files)."
,Mr_brewer,2013-02-07T20:24Z,"Magnus314: I think you clicked the wrong thing. If you just click the ""The Master 1CD (2012) English srt subtitles"" title that comes up when you click dududus link there's a popup-window and then you just wait and the download will start automatically. It's a .zip file, no .exe."
,sumanml07,2013-02-09T05:26Z,is this the cut version?? Because original movie length is 144 min. whereas this is only 137min.
,sumon.tori,2013-02-13T13:17Z,"Great quality, A10 V9 - thnx to the uploader! Movie was OK as i expected it to be! Storyline is intelligent and entertaining and acters were OK! I usually watch all the movies at film.hdkalitesi.com because they have HD's but they didn't have this one so im happy to have piratebay :) Thnx once again for this great share!"
,slmndow,2013-02-18T22:08Z,thanks!

,barton101,2013-04-06T06:47Z,"Next time, please at least include English subtitles for the hearing impaired. They are also good for people who don't have English as their first language. Many people who have trouble understanding English that they hear can understand it when they see it too. Subtitles take up hardly any extra space and they make for more seeders because the torrent is useful to more people."
,yogdagon,2013-04-26T15:48Z,"V-10, A-10, M-6, thanx.
I seed for three (3) months."
