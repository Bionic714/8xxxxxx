,fadePP,2013-02-04T23:51Z,1) The audio is awful. 2) The framerate is wrong (30fps vs 29.97fps).
,JoDon,2013-02-05T01:33Z,The sound is totally fucked up. Don't download this.
,otimig,2013-02-05T02:48Z,"Framerate stuttering and low quality audio.
Sound is too bass-heavy. Sounds a bit like recorded in a ecoing room.
Video stutters noticeably at times."
,happy1776,2013-02-05T08:16Z,"do not download, audio is 3/10"
,Kooblukhan,2013-02-05T11:23Z,"Good to see im not the only one who gets netflix with stuttery film and shit shadow detail.  Sound is also as described above on this one.

Why the fuck doesnt netflix let you download this in actual good quality?"
,bon-bongo,2013-02-05T12:48Z,"Fucked up video - jerking because of wrong framerate. Some frames just doubled.

Fucked up audio - no high tones, everything fuzzy.

Such great series and so shameful quality on this release. Somehow EP3 release's quality much worse than EP1 & EP2 from same release group NTb.

Sure, Netflix riping is novelty, but very soon it will become mainstream. In may Arrested Development on Netflix will kick-off. Amazon Prime ready to launch some great series. WEBrip groups must step-up their game. Future almost hear."
