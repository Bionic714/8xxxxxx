Kinda difficult to do when the file is nearly 1gb... Most online malware scanners can only scan up to like 50mbs."

for those that are having troubles navigating in russian,you can change language with launcher.exe in your main game folder,then on the left side you have 4 boxes you can tick,tick the one with the longest name ,it starts with capital A
then to start the game in english click the left box on the right. voila,english! :) "
