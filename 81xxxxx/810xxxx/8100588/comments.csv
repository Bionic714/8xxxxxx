Either that or NetFlix has hooked the video addicts but good and now the other shoe drops.

personally, I wait for the whole thing before I watch any of it - but being a voluntary shut-in, it's an easy decision to make.

Gonna watch Elementary now. More eps up until (and hopefully beyond) #7 coming soon.

Noticed some time later that I'd completely forgot to start it up again. maybe it's living in a fantasy land of my own choosing, or maybe it's all these drugs. Dunno. Sorry, Slipping and sliding from one universe to the next and I lose track.

after having to wait for the British to post Lilyhammer I was surprised this was up so fast "
