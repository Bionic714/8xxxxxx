Can't wait for the 540p version!"
,xKromatics,2013-02-04T09:05Z,"Awesome! Thanks, Nepotu. Now is this 30 or 60 FPS? Thanks to anyone who can confirm that."
,Vulk098,2013-02-04T09:49Z,Thanks for uploading this. I notice the running time is pretty long. Does this include the commercials?
[V],Nepotu,2013-02-04T10:00Z,"Thank you, to all my good friends, for your words. I'm happy to make you happy.
I don't know if it will be a 540p version.
It's a 30 fps version, but because of show length (4h and 25min) it has this size.
You're all welcome!"
[V],Nepotu,2013-02-04T10:09Z,"BTW. Even if the season is over, stay tuned for some old superbowls and for the Top 10 episodes! Cheers to all of you, friends!"
[V],Nepotu,2013-02-04T10:15Z,"This version includes commercials, halftime report, halftime show (Beyonce) and postgame awards."
,xKromatics,2013-02-04T10:26Z,"Great, thanks for letting us know. Hope everyone enjoys the game! =)"
,SASMareSRB,2013-02-04T15:51Z,"Nepotu, can you give us some screenshots, just to check the quality?
And, thank you so much for this, I thought I won't be able to watch the game at all!"
[V],Nepotu,2013-02-04T15:56Z,"LZedd, you, moron, go fuck yourself. We won't know about your shitty existence, useless shit!"
[V],Nepotu,2013-02-04T16:00Z,"You, guyz, always with doubts, unfaithfuls. Look at this screenshots: http://s14.directupload.net/images/130204/52ce7h3h.png or http://s7.directupload.net/images/130204/watejzws.png"

,Therrito,2013-02-04T19:00Z,"@Nepotu: Great upload.
Thanks a million.

@LZedd: Nobody wants your dumbass spoilers.
Go troll someplace else."
[V],Nepotu,2013-02-04T20:32Z,"Thank you all, my friends to your support! You're all welcome!

@dmcman1989: Nu ai gresit limba. :) Mersi. Merita urmarite si celelalte superbowl-uri (cateva le-am up deja, si vor mai fi in curand)

I'll up in a few days other SB games."
,Tolan29,2013-02-04T20:53Z,"Thanks Nepotu! I was lucky enough to be at the game. It was amazing. So much to take in, I'm looking forward to watching it again after I download this! Lzedd, go batt off and have a cry you little bitch."
[V],Nepotu,2013-02-05T01:39Z,You're welcome bro! I'm happy that you were there. Lucky man!
,LiKomE,2013-02-05T14:29Z,"It has almost everything, thanks Nepotu.
But why no pregame?"
,Roger_Rogers,2013-02-05T14:43Z,"Using VLC Media Player, the video freezes every few seconds. Using DivX Plus Player, the sound just repeats itself, which makes it unwatchable. What media player would you recommend for this video?"
[V],Nepotu,2013-02-06T13:30Z,"Have no pregame. The ripper's call.
Roger, I use BS Player and works fine. Maybe your video card is the problem. I don't know."
,Roger_Rogers,2013-02-07T07:36Z,"Thanks a ton, Nepotu."
,ismylive,2013-02-09T09:11Z,audio goes on and off all thru the game :/
,Carl0s..,2013-02-10T09:59Z,"Thanks a lot from Spain Nepotu. we all at home love this game we discovered thanks to you and other people like you.
