I was look for a copy of this the other day and it took hours of digging around on the internet to find this, so I figured I would upload this and make it easier on everyone else. :) Oh! I also added some various back story stuff too, Like the song that is used for boarding on Rico's ship & the RL history of Heinlein and the man the ship is named after.

From Wikipedia:

Starship Troopers is a military science fiction novel by Robert A. Heinlein, first published (in abridged form) as a serial in The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction (October, November 1959, as "Starship Soldier") and published hardcover in December 1959.

The first-person narrative is about a young soldier from the Philippines named Juan "Johnnie" Rico and his exploits in the Mobile Infantry, a futuristic military service branch equipped with powered armor. Rico's military career progresses from recruit to non-commissioned officer and finally to officer against the backdrop of an interstellar war between mankind and an arachnoid species known as "the Bugs". Rico and the other characters discuss moral and philosophical aspects of suffrage, civic virtue, juvenile delinquency, capital punishment, and war.
