[V],Nepotu,2013-02-04T10:05Z,"You're all welcome, guyz!

I specified in description that includes the pregame and halftime shows.

The difference is the source. I don't know yet more. I haven't watch it yet."
[V],Nepotu,2013-02-04T10:19Z,"The other version includes commercials, halftime report, halftime show (Beyonce) and postgame awards.
This version, I think, has no commercials."
