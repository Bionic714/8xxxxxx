,aibrean1978,2013-02-07T03:39Z,Thanks for being one of the only ones on here that is NOT x264! find it impossible to convert (on mac) to ipod classic and have to do a massive hunt every week for the NON 264 version. THANKS!

Has anyone had any issues playing this file? From start to finish the picture freezes but the audio keeps going. All my other episodes which are all ettv are fine it's just this one. Would appreciate if someone else commented on this.

Cheers"
