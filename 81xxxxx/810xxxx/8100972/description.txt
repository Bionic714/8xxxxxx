If you've heard them at all, it's most likely because one of their songs was sampled by rapper Obie Trice for the HBO show Entourage. The Detroit band's only record, 1970's The Gospel According to Zeus, is a mixed bag of obtuse awesomeness: The record sounds like what would have happened if Jack White had liked Deep Purple and Their Satanic Majesties Request more than Led Zeppelin and Nashville Skyline, which isn't necessarily a positive thing. This is organ-heavy, psychedelic premetal. But what strikes me as unprecedented is the relative lack of information that exists about this band. Power of Zeus certainly doesn't warrant canonization, but they should be at least as famous as . . . somebody.
