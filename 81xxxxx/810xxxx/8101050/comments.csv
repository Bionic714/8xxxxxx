,sivksc,2013-02-04T10:52Z,LZedd: Why would anyone downloading this want to know the score? Thanks a lot. 
,clawedthecat,2013-02-04T11:47Z,"LZedd - I was really looking forward to this game, the match started 0700 perth time, I have managed to avoid all media all day, I have just gotten home started the download then I find your comment. I hope there's a movie that you've been pissing yourself to see, only to have someone spoil it for you while you're in the line waiting to get a ticket.

Fuck you, you know what scratch that.

Fuck your retarded parents for breeding in the first place, odds are that if they're that retarded that they bred you, they're brother and sister."
,pio2102,2013-02-04T12:33Z,"It would have been much better if Colin Kaepernick had not done what he did(Yeah Niners Fan). But anyway it was an excellent game.  [SPOILER ALERT]A 109 yds TD?? WTF!!

@ SCSA420 i'm your fan Thank you i'll seed 2x1"
,extracube,2013-02-04T12:53Z,"@LZedd, keep in mind that many of us downloading this are way on the other side of the world and were asleep during the game and/or didn't have live access to it.  Or do you want to be an asshole?"

,zoli32,2013-02-04T17:12Z,any chance  of putting  up old sports events like  caanada grey cup  or world seriers   from thispast seasons
,JarjarTwink,2013-02-04T17:15Z,thanx nepotu. This one stuck at 22%. =(
,xyko62,2013-02-04T22:22Z,Lousy torrent. Nobody seems to have the whole file! Lost more than 5 hours of perfectly good bandwidth and only got to 20%. :(
[T],SCSA420,2013-02-04T23:44Z,IF you don't like it then don't download it. I told you people above that it would take time for me to upload this as only 1 of my 2 broadband connections is working right now. Sorry for the delay but its the best I can do uploading it. I shouldn't have uploaded this then I wouldn't have to listen to all you downloaders bitching about the slower speed. :(
,Tombix,2013-02-04T23:48Z,Seed Please! ^^
,AdBuyingWhore,2013-02-05T06:02Z,"Its been 16 hours and it has only uploaded about 70%, I figure it will be uploaded at about 2013-02-05 12:00 GMT and no one will have it all until then unless SCSA420 gets their 2nd line up or has a friend with a sneaker net.

If you are one of the few with the entire file, you can speed up everyone if you only seed the sites with faster peers or high ratios.  The fast connections that were early leachers are way above their normal cutoff points as a few servers have 70% of the files with share ratios of 25 and one has 100."
[T],SCSA420,2013-02-05T13:10Z,PLENTY of seeds now it hit 100% finished uploading 30 minutes ago KEEP SEEDING PEOPLE. Thanks and enjoy the game!!!
,sivksc,2013-02-05T19:00Z,"Good quality! Thank you for the great torrent!
It did take a while, but we were warned - so can't complain. "
,Tankerbot,2013-02-05T19:10Z,"WHY DID YOU REMOVE THE 34 MINUTES OF POWER OUTAGE COVERAGE?!!

Serously, I am in the process of creating a parody skit video and need a part that is in that part. BUT YOU F***KING EDITED IT OUT."
[T],SCSA420,2013-02-06T09:43Z,I took out most of the power failure footage because it was commercials and talking and this release would have been over 7 GB then besides NFL football fans want to see action not a bunch of players standing around waiting for the lights to come back on.  :D
,ismylive,2013-02-09T10:29Z,"are the comercial ads inclued in this torrent?
