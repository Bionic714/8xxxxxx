As the singer of 90ΓÇÖs Hawaii skatepunk natives/LA rock band Chokebore, Troy Von Balthazar has been hiding out in France for some time; far away from the obscurity of Southern California.

A Chokebore reunion in France (and parts of mainland Europe) and several solo albums later, Troy still sounds the same as ever; maybe a bit more focused.

Growing up, Chokebore was probably THE band that got me through my ΓÇ£sadcore ΓÇ£ teenage years. I even learned some of these songs on guitar when I was dreaming of rockstardom in my suburban bedroom.

Lucky enough, to see them play half a dozen times on the west coast with the likes of Unwound and the Butthole Surfers, IΓÇÖve always had a soft spot from this band ever since having my mind blown witnessing Troy doing backflips whilst playing guitar, and opening for Nirvana back in 1994 in Seattle Washington.

Chokebore (ΓÇ£the strangest band on AmrepΓÇ¥) never reached the popularity in the States as they did in Europe. Enjoying mainstream popularity particularly in France, most of the band now makes Europe their permanent home; sometimes awaking from their slumber to play and record.

Troy seems to be the one most prolific: ΓÇ£...is with demonΓÇ¥ might stand as his strongest solo album to date. Released on clear vinyl (and cd) on Vicious Circle out of France; (and to sound cliche) this record feels a bit more mature and fresh sounding. The demon is alive and well in Troy Von Balthazar.
