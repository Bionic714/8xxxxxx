Vision Valley is The Vines' 3rd album. There are no contributions made to the record by bassist Patrick Matthews due to his involvement with the band Youth Group, and the band's video podcast proves this.

In the United States, the album debuting at #136 on the Billboard charts, selling 7,839 units. By week 2, the album completely slid off the Billboard 200.

The album received mixed reviews from many critics. However there were mostly positive reviews from the United Kingdom in particular, with music publications such as Q and NME giving the album 4/5 stars and 7/10 respectively, and some even claiming it was of greater quality than their explosive debut Highly Evolved. Q had Vision Valley at #69 in their Albums of 2006 Poll, dubbing the songs 'superior grunge anthems'.

Both "Anysound" and "Spaceship" appeared in season 3 of The O.C in episodes 21 and 24 respectively.
