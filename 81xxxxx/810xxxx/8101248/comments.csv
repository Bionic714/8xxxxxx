Try rebooting or taskkilling kmsnano qemu and kmseldi

petrus7, you can extract kmsnano.exe to a directory and run kmseldi.exe /qemu
Just make a shortcut to kmseldi.exe and add the /qemu line.
Then when it warms up the virtual machine after like a minute, press the big ""EL"" button. It's the same as kms extracted except kms extracted just has a program to hide that.

Lets not give him too hard a time guys, not everyone can tell when an uploader is a total douchebag like T.F.K"
,alvester,2013-02-04T17:51Z,Offtopic: Murphy can u tell me where can I get the download link of Office Home and Student 2013. I don't want the additional features of Office ProPlus. Thanks. PS: I know I can I can customize the ProPlus setup but some of the customization features are overwhelming for me.

So its just like Windows 8 core edition that can't be activated. Thanks for the heads up. I'd be better off with Office ProPlus then."
