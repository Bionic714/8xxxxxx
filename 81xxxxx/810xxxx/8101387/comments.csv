,Kotrr,2013-02-04T22:54Z,"Hey guys. I can actually confirm so far that this torrent DOES work.
I experienced the Syntax error and changed the name of the folder to ""Dead Space 3 - Limited"" (I assume it can be changed to anything) and it worked just fine. The installer is in a odd language but everything seems to be working. I just started up the game, auto save seems to be working, got my plasma cutter from DS2, I will let you guys know if I have any further issues."
,lestnet,2013-02-05T04:04Z,"its working 100% fine And Legit Torrent. For syntex error, Just rename the folder to ""Dead Space 3 - Limited"" and install. Everything should work fine."

,Wallyworldfan12,2013-02-05T07:57Z,"O yeah, I wish all games were easy as hell to crack such as this 1."
,melvox,2013-02-06T04:02Z,"Just curious as I don't know how to, I can't see the First Contact thing that came with the Limited Edition. Where can I access these things?"
