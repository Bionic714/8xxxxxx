Randy Spears gives the comedy performance of his career as a wacko German scientist out of the Sid Caesar school of German accents who has invented a lipstick that's also an aphrodisiac. Before you say, "Oh no, another aphrodisiac plot!" I ask you to try it. You'll like it. Screenwriter Gerard Damiano has turned in a script that will make you laugh no matter how many times you view the tape. And the girls -- most of the time in lacy underthings -- are nothing short of great. Rachel Ryan, one of those ladies who gets better looking every year, is at the height of her attractiveness and sex appeal here. She's also no slouch delivering a comedy line, either. In the raving beauty department there is redhead Veronica Doll who is so good looking it should be illegal. Hot, funny and sexy -- a fine combination.
