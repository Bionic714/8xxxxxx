I'm near the end of the game ( for the 6th time or so, over the span of my 25 years in life. ) and am fearing that I won't have the ability to play Monkey Island 2 with the SE Edition Speech Files. Might I be so blunt to ask you (Since I don't have the possibility to compile it...) if you'd be so kind to make a Monkey Island 2 Talkie Version torrent ?

Thank you, in advance."

A million thanx! Now I can go pester Largo, dump the rat in the soup, frame miss Kapsize, nail Stan into his own sold coffins and enjoy parts of my childhood again.

All I can really say is : "" I'm rubber and you are glue """
