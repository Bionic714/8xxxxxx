GENERAL INFO:

This is a talkie version of The Secret of the Monkey Island 
(Monkey Island 1) with original VGA graphics. Speech and sound 
effects are from the Special Edition, which does not allow to 
use the original graphics AND speech at the same time. 
Hence this torrent. You need ScummVM 1.5.0 to run this game.

The sound is compressed in lossy ogg format to get reasonable 
quality and small file size. If you'd like to have a VGA talkie
version with FLAC, you need to download and install the Special 
Edition PC version (there are many torrents available) and use 
this patching tool on it: 

gratissaugen dot de / ultimatetalkies / monkey1 dot html

(There are good instructions on how to do it in readme.txt) 


STEPS TO TAKE:

1. Install ScummVM 1.5.0 (Windows version included) if you don't 
already have it

NOTE: If you want to play the game on another system/device than 
Windows PC, visit http://scummvm.org/downloads/ to find the right 
ScummVM release to install

2. Extract MI1_ULtimate_Talkie_Edition.zip anywhere you want

3. Add the extracted folder in ScummVM. Add the included music 
subfolder you prefer as an Extra Path in ScummVM options for 
the game.

4. You're all set. Just start the game in ScummVM.

Enjoy!
