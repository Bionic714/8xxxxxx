[T],RayCort,2013-02-04T19:08Z,"@bing52. Sorry that I don't want to upload older movies because of leechers and I end up having to reupload them everytime which wastes my monthly allotment of bandwidth, so, I told her I no longer want to do requets of older movies I have"
,coolglex,2013-02-04T20:07Z,"Hi i looking for a Lifetime movie call "" What Color is Love? ""  please help me ......"
[T],RayCort,2013-02-04T20:15Z,@coolglex. Sorry I don't have that movie. Maybe Mr. Uploader has it as he caps Lifetime movies for people. You can PM him on Pirate BayForum. 
,troydevin,2013-02-05T10:44Z,Please SEED!!!
,coolglex,2013-02-05T17:43Z,thx Raycort  for that info.............
,Erik_O,2013-02-06T20:01Z,"Stuck at 34,6% for days, please seed!"
,Drew4201,2013-02-07T00:52Z,"RayCort there is a problem with this torrent.  I am not sure what is happening, but I am stuck at 34%.  Please help. "
,lequory,2013-02-07T06:22Z,I'd like to know whats going on with this torrent also. I'm stuck at 34.9% also. It must be an internet problem or a capping situation???
[T],MrUnpopular,2013-02-07T07:45Z,"There is not a problem with the torrent. It's just lacking in seeders (people with the full file)

It also has nothing to do with capping. Capping = recording. RayCort recorded/capped and converted/encoded it, I'm guessing to XviD, then packed it into a torrent for The Pirate Bay and seeded it. Like I said, it's just not well seeders. (seeders = 100% of the file, leechers only have a part of the file and not the full thing yet)"
,Drew4201,2013-02-07T12:47Z,"MrUnpopular I think something is wrong and it has nothing to do with seeders.  I have been trying to download this torrent for four days.  Maybe there is a tracker problem.  I understand the concept of seeders, but no one will ever be able to get the entire movie because something is wrong."
[T],RayCort,2013-02-07T13:20Z,"Another torrent upload that had 15 seeders when i removed it from my torrent client and here we are again with leechers who grab and run and refuse to seed, thereby other complaining about my torrents. I mentioned I am not part of a team, but an individual that has a monthly band width allocation.  "
[T],RayCort,2013-02-07T17:34Z,"I ReUploaded it and renamed it ""Lifetime-Betty and Coretta [2013] - ReSeed"". 

Last time I will do this!!!"
,SCOUTDOG,2013-02-07T18:59Z,"Also stuck on 35%. Will go for the re-seed, thank you."
,Velvet71,2013-02-09T20:15Z,"A=9
v=9
M=9
Thank you for uploading. It took a while (3 days) to download because of the lack of seeders but I've been seeding ever since! Hope it helps."
