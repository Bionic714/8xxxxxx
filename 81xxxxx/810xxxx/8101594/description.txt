there is no password or protection. You are free to view, convert, or extract the images as You please. i would use a Print to JPG tool as Fansadox comics often use floating text layers for easy translating.

i can open all of them from my tablet or from a laptop.

if you have trouble opening any of the files in this torrent let me know here and i will ask to have them fixed!

i will be posting a newer collection with links here soon.
if there is enough demand i will be made available on request.

thank you Sir
