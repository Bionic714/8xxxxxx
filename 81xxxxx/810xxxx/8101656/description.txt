 "I produced a lot of the tracks in the old school way, how I used to work in the nineties," he says. "I played a lot of the basslines and pads by hand... I recorded a 10 minute take and later would edit out the highlights. On each track I tried to focus on two to three machines." What I Do will be the German producer's first album in more than four years, after 2008's In Other Words. It will see release on his own label, Pooledmusic. Guest appearances come from Dominique Keegan and Gus Gus collaborator HÃ¶gni Egilsson.
