Actors rocked, really really good acting! Quality was great! At site aole.ciroblazevic.com there is Django and Hobbit in HD already, great stuff! Thnx once again for this fantastic movie!"
,Pewpewlazers,2013-02-10T08:05Z,The video quality is good but I think this file is missing the foreign language subtitles that were in the theatrical release. Also the GUI of a screen capture program comes up 3/4 of the way through for about 2 seconds. 
,funnyname,2013-02-20T23:58Z,"V:10 ( A: I only use stereo boxes) Thank you ! Great up !
@Pewpewlazers: in this up there is a folder with 3 different english subtitles for different needs (hearing impairment for example). Just copy the one you need from that folder to the movie file. It will be then recognized by your mediaplayer and show the subtitles."
,funnyname,2013-02-21T00:04Z,"to add: . ... and you have to rename the subtitles file to ""Argo[2012]BRRip 720p H264-ETRG.srt"""
