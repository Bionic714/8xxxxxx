Plays worse too, tried to punch a monster several times and it didnt react, just kept hitting me.
I do hope this is somehow an alpha version or something, cuz i like dead space :( this is shit..."

,chomskyMF,2013-02-04T21:41Z,"@internexus

well actually im using another version, ""revenant"" if i remember well. but since its also an eng/ru repack, i assume it works the same way... thing is, I did what you adviced in fact the installer is already set to english. what I cant do is set the game to a given language within the registry. it was the same method for dead space 2 and it was working fine, but here, even when set to en_US, it stays in my native language, not even russian"
,sonic30,2013-02-04T21:57Z,The thirst thing I did was changing the installer to english with the drop down box. Didn't helped at all. Also let it stay at RU didn't help. Tried to change the Registry to en_US but still no change. 
,Tab10s,2013-02-04T22:33Z,jus installed game ran fine untill audio it was in english cuz i changed it not retarted but anyways cant get over like 10 fps once the actual game starts and i know my computer meets the not only the min specs but the max so yah i think ima jus buy the game this time

,bandrizzle,2013-02-05T00:36Z,"ok so im having an odd problem with this game. i installed it and everything (first time didnt see the english option) went threw it all, did the dx and all that. finished up, completed, now there is about 5 gigs of free space missing and there is no install folder for the game. tryin to reinstall now, hoping that fixes it, but still missing a good chunk of my remaining freespace. looked for it with ccleaner and all those fun programs. still nothing, if anyone has any answers please let me know."
,kingcover,2013-02-05T01:14Z,"Thanks Hero, this works a treat as expected.
Just simply run the setup (as admin if you need to) and choose English language from the drop down menu on the right side of the dialogue box (if you need to) and let it install.  Now just run the desktop shortcut and all should be well.  Video framerates are horrible in some cases, but the game runs great on very high when you're controlling your character, very smooth gameplay.  As for the game itself, not sure how I feel about it yet, at least the graphics are nice."
,bandrizzle,2013-02-05T02:01Z,"ok got it all working swimmingly, but i lost 2 gigs somewhere along the line, dunno what happened to it XD but this game is amazing, runs way better than i expected, and looks great as well.  lovin it, big thank you to Hero, made my month :)"

,athina1008,2013-02-05T04:36Z,"Audio problem FIXED, English vocals now works.
For all the people which you cant change the language or not vocals you just need to go to...

In Widows control panel/region and language/formats/

and then choose the contry what you want, in this case English (EEUU), worked for me. Then run the game!!!!!"
,Tab10s,2013-02-05T05:07Z,mines in english i uninstalled and am reinstalling see if it fixes the fps i turned v sync off and everything i know its not my computer because the game started out on the default setting which was high i even turned it down to low and all the effects off and still couldnt get normal frames but i was compressing a file so maybe that was it
,odaic,2013-02-05T05:18Z,"@athina1008
Worked perfectly, ty.
For this game forget to search any ini or setup file in users, or change registry entries like locale...
The only thing that worked for me was the one suggested by athina.
Whichever the language you are using on your windows, the game will take its language from the ""format"" tab in region options. Chose UK or US and your game will run in English."
,odaic,2013-02-05T05:24Z,"you can also try that:

There is the solution:
In windows 7 go to 
C:users/your username/appdata/local/ea games/dead space 3
Open the file system.txt and modify those 2 lines
Window.Height =
and
Window.Width =

Exemple if your res is 1920x1080
Window.Height = 1080
Window.Width = 1920

Then save and close then start the game back up.
Theres also a FOV setting in there and a couple other settings one could want to modify.

,5870x2,2013-02-08T08:47Z,"Hi. I thought i would give you my ""possible"" work around for those who are experiencing problems from the very start trying to install this game and the game play settings itself etc.
I found the installer program to be very troublesome but managed to work it out.
1. Use the set up exe and the first small screen will appear asking you what language etc, use English if preferred and then the IE tab.
2. You should see after a brief delay a small splash screen with a dead space 3 title etc. This is where it was a bit confusing as there is no items to click on etc. Press the ""ENTER"" key on your keyboard this should bring you to another small splash screen which will have the destination folder and some other info etc. The default path is C drive with the installer but in my case there was not enough room left on C drive which was hi-lightened in red and i wanted to install to another Drive anyway, this was another problem with the installer how to change the directory Path as it did not respond to mouse commands etc. To get around this i used the DOWN ARROW [press twice] cursor key on the keyboard to change the install path but nothing appeared to hi light etc so i used the backspace key to see if this would clear the destination path and this cleared the default C drive directory and then allowed me to type in another drive in my case K:Dead Space 3
3. If you have been successful to this point and have gone to either the default directory or another drive press ""Enter"" on your keyboard and it will go into another small splash screen telling you that it has Passed: X amount of time. Unpack game files. Time remaining etc. plus a progress bar and the game installs itself and it took some time to do this as well so be prepared for a long install.
4. In my case once the game had installed i ran it but then i had the same problem that i had with Dead space 1 & 2 that the screen was not centered and it was impossible to get into the settings menu etc. if this is the same for you go into where the game is installed and find the Joypad_example.txt rename this file to Joypad.txt if you do not have a xbox controller and don't intend to use one then this file can interfere with standard keyboard operation. Also if you use a Logitech G13 keypad then do not enable the joystick in the settings menu as this caused my game to to display erratically as well so be warned as this is a subject all on its own to rectify. 
5. I played about 15% of the game and had numerous crashes and freezing screens and a BSOD this was using the pre-installed crack in the game. tried to lower settings etc but this was futile so after some deliberation i decided to install the crack from Reloaded and then started the game again.
Immediately the game started it was perfect! except I could not load a saved game as it informed me that the save was corrupt. So i started a new game and reset all my graphic settings to the max and what a difference the game is when it is running properly [unfortunately i cant say the same about MOHW ] With all the eye candy turned on and audio etc its great and restarting a new game with a new crack has also added things in the game play that seemed to be omitted from the original crack etc and i am about half way through the game and not one hiccup.
Thanks to the person/people responsible for the repack etc but on my system it was not functioning properly so rather than downloading Reloaded's full game i just ran their crack.
Good luck to those who suffer!
PS. Mine is a gaming rig but i still get problems as much as the next person. All of this info is in regards to Win 7 64 bit Ultimate.

1) Check to see if you have Jumi Controller or any ""Jumi"" software installed.

2) Uninstall Jumi, check to see if DS3 is working.

3) If its still not working try checking your drivers to see if Jumi.sys is still there, it'll look something like C:WindowsSystem32driversJumi.sys  Then rename it to whatever you like.

4) Restart your computer

Hope this helps!"
