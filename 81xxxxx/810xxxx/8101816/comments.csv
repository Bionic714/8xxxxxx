When I attempt to run it, I get ""Sorry, this application cannot run under a Virtual Machine.""

Running Windows 8, specs are low but besides the point. Tried all typical compatibility setups.

Works fine and lag free with max graph settings under XP with AMD 6950 2GB. Wait wut? That's right, I'm STILL using XP! Ahhhahahaaa!

You should use Google to get to know, how to unlock limited edition things. There are ""unlocking save files"" for this. You even need one for this game.
But, you won't get the items immediately on game start - you still need to play some time.

@sick635
""and the patch"" - there is NO patch released for this game yet. But it sure does need one.
If you are talking about the cracked content, then it has nothing to do with it. It's just your GPU which needs upgrading or replacing. Have you tried upgrading GPU drivers yet?"
