About the Game:

Dead Space 3 is a third-person shooter survival-horror video game, developed by Visceral Games. It is the sequel to Dead Space 2 and the third main entry of the Dead Space series.
Primarily set on a frozen planet called Tau Volantis, the game will follow protagonists Isaac Clarke and John Carver as they attempt to end the Necromorph threat.
In Dead Space 3, Isaac and newcomer Sergeant John Carver can roll and take cover to avoid attacks. 
Dead Space 3 pits player character Isaac Clarke against the Necromorphs, human corpses reanimated by the signal of a Marker.
The Resource Integration Gear (RIG) suit also returns, using holographic displays projected from the players' suit and weapons to display health and ammo count, respectively. 
In vacuum areas a timer will appear on the player's right shoulder, indicating how much oxygen that character has left before they suffocate.
Aside from returning Necromorphs, Dead Space 3 features a large cast of reanimated enemies. 
One example is the Waster, whose attacks change depending on how it is dismembered; while another is the Nexus, an insect-like giant that can crush or swallow people whole.
Other obstacles in Dead Space 3 include a new human enemy, Unitologist soldiers; and environmental hazards like falling machinery and a giant mining drill......
