Act 1 is Tarja's first ever solo live video product in her rock/metal outfit - probably her most spectacular release ever. The main content was filmed and recorded on two show nights March 2012 in Rosario, Argentina, at the Teatro El CÃrculo, a beautiful and breathtaking theatre setting.
With its elaborate tracklisting, Act 1 provides the full-fledged bill of fare to any Tarja fan. The tracklisting consists of Tarja's greatest solo tracks, some Nightwish classics like Nemo , or the cover versions Over The Hills And Far Away (Gary Moore) and Phantom Of The Opera (Andrew Lloyd Webber). The Blu-Ray also includes the song Tired Of Being Alone , which Tarja wrote with Schiller - or to make it short: a unique blend of music selection.Треклист:
