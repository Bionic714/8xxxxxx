,tsoutsouras,2013-02-05T19:52Z,I istalled the update and the game does not start at all...
,UglyDucklingxyz,2013-02-06T08:03Z,Just started a new game with the patch installed and it works. Thanks BAT team. Much appreciated!
,tsoutsouras,2013-02-06T15:23Z,"UglyDucklingxyz  can you please tell me what is the version of the game that you inastalled because mine is this

,UglyDucklingxyz,2013-02-06T23:59Z,"I believe that's the one I used too. Have you tried a fresh install?

However, something very strange is going on. The hero isn't gaining any experience. My soothsayer character gained no experience whatsoever. Tried another new game with a viking hero - this one gained a little experience and then none after that. Makes me wonder if this is merely an accidental bug...


Note: I'm not talking about the valkyrie amulet, it's normal for it not to get any experience until the first valkyrie is encountered. "
,tsoutsouras,2013-02-07T15:40Z,"UglyDucklingxyz . Thanks a lot for your answer. I did a clean install and then i applied the patch, but nothing happened. The game does not start at all, maybe it needs some king of crack."
,UglyDucklingxyz,2013-02-08T01:20Z,"I did a clean install as well and used this update and the no-experience seems to be gone. Perhaps the previous patch (from this site as well) or a mod might have been interfering. Will report if I spot anything suspicious. 

Hope your problem gets solved though. "
,tsoutsouras,2013-02-14T14:51Z,"Ok. Finaly some good news. I removed the save files folder and I did a clean istallation. Then i applied this patch. The game works and its build upgrades to 6250. Then i created a new game and made a new save. Then I copied my old saves in the saves folder (only the saves not the game.ini file), and they worked.
It seems that the old save folder created some problem and the game did n't start, at least thats what i think. I hope all these are helpful."
,tsoutsouras,2013-02-14T14:57Z,Ok finaly some good news. I think the problem was created by the game.ini file that is in the saves folder. I removed the saves file and then did a clean installation. Then i applied this patch. I run the game and it works. It updades the build to 6250. I created a new game and a new save. The i copied the old saves (only the save files not the old game.ini file) to the addon folder. They work too. That's it. I hope it was helpful
