,tflagger997,2013-02-15T00:18Z,Also too bad that this is just Bozx's version re-spammed.
,tyl3rdurd3n,2013-02-15T07:56Z,"The video aspect ratio here is 2.35:1, like in the rest. This only doesn't have the black bars cropped off (they are there) so that makes it 1920x1080. On the other 1920x800 rips, the black bars are cropped off, but they are 1080p rips as well. No part of the image is missing in either of the 1080p 'version'. The only difference is that a Remux isn't compressed - Audio/video's the same as on the source (BD-50) disc hence the file size.

And this isn't BOZX's version 're-spammed'."
