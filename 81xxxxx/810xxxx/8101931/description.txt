  The heroic-fantasy hack 'n' slash game R.A.W.: Realms of Ancient 
  War takes you on a continent ravaged by a war that raged ten 
  years earlier. The four Kingdoms of Men, Elves and Dwarves lay 
  in ruins, preyed on by raiders and looters. In this chaos, a 
  new, unknown threat is looming... To discover its true nature, 
  the kingdoms sent detachments to investigate, a dangerous 
  mission from which no one returned. But what about you? You, who 
  were in the wrong place at the wrong time... 

  Take control of a powerful Warrior, a dark Sorcerer or a Rogue 
  master of stealth, and plunge into a grand quest full of action! 
  The world of R.A.W. leads you, alone or in 2-player co-op, 
  through many levels as rich as varied in every corner of the 
  continent. Along your quest, the experience gained through the 
  violent battles you will fight and the weapons and magic items 
  you will loot on the lifeless bodies of your opponents will 
  allow you to develop the power of your chosen character. You 
  will learn new powers and spells ever more devastating, some of 
  which, when mastered, will allow you to inflict tremendous 
  damage and eradicate several dozens of enemies at once... as 
  they will often rally in hordes to fight you!
