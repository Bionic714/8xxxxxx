You have posted a couple comments on my vinyl uploads asking for more information.  Let me just say without being rude that TPB is a public tracker.  I upload the music.  If you want a site that forces people to post specific info this isn't the right place.  Please just appreciate what is offered without asking for exactly the info you want or need.  No one is under obligation to upload the way you want or give the info you want.  "
