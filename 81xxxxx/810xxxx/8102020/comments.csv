You sir a dumbfuck, go to a hole and die in it."
,drop_dead99,2013-02-07T02:33Z,"BitDefender detected a virus too :|

Gen:Heur.Crifi.2

Not sure why it would find something like that in the game install executable."

Maybe because it's cracked game hmm? Most of time antivirus will detect crack as a virus."
,drop_dead99,2013-02-10T22:49Z,"If the game is already cracked, there is no reason for it to be picked up by the scanner.

It's one huge exe file, so if the crack is somehow contained within (why would they do that?) then there's no way to tell if it's a false positive or not. I'd rather just stay safe.

Anyway, my antivirus never identified cracks as malicious before, so why start now?"
,opilarium,2013-02-14T16:38Z,Doesn't save. Shit.
,opilarium,2013-02-14T16:43Z,To save a game you have to run it as an administrator. Genius. 
,bno112300,2013-03-27T10:01Z,"That's because it saves to a .bin inside of program files.

You could modify it to run portable to get around this, or use a debugger to alter the save location."
