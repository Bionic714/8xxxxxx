Today is World Cancer Day, the epidemic of the XXI century.
Appreciated words of support, I have a lot of fear and helplessness.
If all goes well I will be happy to continue sharing torrents with you.

Dentro de un par de semanas tengo que ingresar en el hospital para que me extirpen un trozo de hígado, porque tengo un tumor. Es una buena noticia, ya que en un principio parecía que la única solución era un transplante.
Hoy es el día mundial del cancer, la epidemia del siglo XXI.
Se agradecen palabras de apoyo, tengo mucho miedo e impotencia.
Si todo sale bien estaré encantado de seguir compartiendo torrents con vosotros."

Care just about your survival. Prepare to change and be changed. No limits, baby. No comfort zones any more. Be prepared to be rocked. It will pass. We love you. You are loved. You care about other people. You have divine grace because you care about our lives together.  Tell us how it goes. Respect...jack from Wisconsin US."
