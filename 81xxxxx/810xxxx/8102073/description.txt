Worlds Toughest Fixes: Series Two
World's Toughest Fixes goes inside some of the most daunting repair jobs imaginable. Each episode follows host Sean Riley as he pushes himself to the limit while working with some of the world's top riggers. A professional rigger with a passion for adventure, Riley isn't afraid to strap on a hazmat suit or attach himself to a live high-voltage power line to get the job done. He's seen more than his fair share of perilous situations, but on each job he has to show the crew he knows his stuff. Whether dangling from ropes hundreds of feet in the air or diving close to a construction vessel's propellers, Riley's mechanical know-how takes viewers inside the marvels of large-scale industry.


1)  Satellite Launch 
Riley heads into the remote jungle to help a team of rocket scientists and engineers launch a new two-ton satellite with a price tag of more than $1 million into orbit

2)  Giant Wind Turbine 
Riley travels to Portsmouth, R.I., where residents are setting up a 115-ton wind turbine that will provide years of clean energy. The constant blowing wind will fuel the rubine, but how do you raise giant blades in the midst of these unpredictable winds?

3)  50 Ton Rudder 
Riley joins a team of industrial divers on the Caribbean island of Curacao to salvage and repair the 50-ton rudder of a ship carrying $3 million worth of iron ore.

4)  Solar Power Plant 
Riley joins a crew lifting a 50 ton boiler 160 feet up a tower and suspending it above 24,000 mirrors - completing America's first large scale solar power tower.

5)  Columbia River Dam 
The John Day Dam near Portland, Oregon is a huge producer of electricity and shipping portal. If blocked, traffic on the entire Columbia River comes to a screeching halt. With billions of dollars on the line, join Sean Riley on this challenging fix.

6)  Atom Smasher 
Sean faces one of his most spectacular fixes to date as he repairs a giant magnet at the Large Hadron Collider with success paving the way for scientific breakthrough, while failure means a potential catastrophe.

7)  Rocky Mountain Rigging 
Riley's headed to the Wild West to rebuild one of the first ski lifts in the country. Building just outside of rugged Yellowstone presents additional challenges and even requires a special helicopter to crane the materials into place.

8)  Extreme Bridges 
Riley crosses the pond to scale three iconic bridges in the U.K. The famed Tower Bridge in London is being restored. In Scotland, he'll construct scaffolding at the top of the Forth Bridge, a vertigo-inducing 367 feet over the water!

9)  Fixing Vegas 
Riley travels to Las Vegas to solve a real showstopper of a problem - one of the world's largest, most technologically advanced stages is broken. Still in Sin City, Riley repairs the world's largest video screen and cannons in the Bellagio fountain.

10)  Extreme Heights 
Riley is going to new heights fix a thrill ride on the tallest building in Vegas. Then he'll dangle 500 feet over the Hoover Dam to retrieve trash. Upriver from Niagara Falls, he'll hang over an unstable, overgrown cliff to eliminate loose rocks.

11)  Cruise Ship Overhaul 
An 856-foot-long luxury ship is taking on water, Riley and his team need to work around the clock, because in just two weeks more than 2,000 paid guests arrive for the vacation of a lifetime! Reputations and a boatload of money are on the line.
