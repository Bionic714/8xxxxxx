,bonzofan,2013-02-07T01:19Z,"@zakimar5. You seem very fond of the word ""ignorant"". Having read the bible, the koran, the bhagavad gita, the Tibetan and Egyptian books of the dead and numerous books on the Philosophy(Lit:""love of wisdom"") of religion,however, I value my honest atheism. It's not that I didn't look for ""god"", it's that I found no evidence(Lit:""that which is seen"") for it. Truth and knowledge? There are better places to look than the rantings of a 7th century warlord."
