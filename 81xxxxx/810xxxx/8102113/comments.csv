,beowoulfe,2013-02-04T20:19Z,"I have been reading your quran in ""revealed"" order. You have to be incredibly stupid or insane to buy into what mohammed proclaimed. His own people saw through his sham and proclaimed him possessed.  I'm inclined to believe."

And why anyone should believe you’re so called pieceful teaching .we see daily on TV and new who you really are.

No matter how many bomb you explode or kill innocent or rape or deceit you always do your best to declare you religion pieceful :-))))

,wonderwang,2013-02-05T00:33Z,To be a Muslim is to give up any free will you once had to be told how to do absolutely everything in your life.

Funny how muslims are, anyone that criticizes their religion is stupid and beneath contempt, if u are lucky(and they can't get your address) they will ignore you, if not, here comes some moron fanatic who think your head is his ticket to the whorehouse in the sky(check how paradise is described for muslims) where he will screw 7 virgins and drink wine and stay drunk for eternity!

Never any logical reasoning as to why it is ok that Quaran gives Muhammad green light to screw anything and anyone he fancies(Holy book indeed), or why it is ok for him to marry a nine year old whose father was already deeply committed to him(so the reason of a political marriage is just pure BS)

So you want to be a muslim?? Simple, stop thinking, start following and accepting crap you are told without question"
,bonzofan,2013-02-07T01:04Z,"@qraanTV. No, I read the koran. And England has an increasing problem with Islamic paedophile rings. They think it's ok because they are emulating Mohammed. And how else are we supposed to interpret "" kill the unbeliever wherever you find him""? The koran also makes it clear that lying to non-muslims is allowed,as they are only offered conversion, ""dhimmitude"" or death. Or would you be happy to agree that these child rapists and murderers are, in fact, NOT muslims? Hard to see how you could, as they are the ones that are actually living as the koran tells them to. Where exactly does ""true valour"" come into it?"

,bonzofan,2013-02-08T20:48Z,"Turns out it's not just ""unbelievers"". A friend of mine is an Ahmedi muslim. His family moved to the UK to escape persecution and death threats in Pakistan, and he now has to travel 40 miles to go to a mosque to avoid persecution and death threats from other muslims  in our  home town. So much for a muslim ""brotherhood"" (jamaat?)"
