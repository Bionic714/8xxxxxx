,shock7867,2013-05-25T01:03Z,"Ok, its a great and perfect download EXCEPT The Price We Pay is a duplicate of Can't Let Go. So this torrent has the song Can't Let Go, and the next song is listed as The Price We Pay, but is just a mislabeled version of Can't Let Go that I just heard right before it.

Aside from that, great download. Its annoying that both versions of this album on Piratebay have the same Price We Pay/Can't Let Go problem, which leads me to believe there is a similarity between these two or its the same uploader in some way. Too coincidental that they both share this problem. "
