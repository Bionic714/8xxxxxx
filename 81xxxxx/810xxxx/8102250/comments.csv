[T],moebanzor,2013-02-04T23:35Z,"The aspect ratio is incorrect on these files. If you watched it on netflix, you can see the aspect ratio is actually about 2:1, not 16:9. You can tell, because the picture appears stretched vertically.

However this is easy to correct, just set your video player to player to play it at the 2:1 aspect ratio, for example in mplayer pass the option -aspect 2:1

The video and is of good quality, resolution of 720x404, so on the upper end of the SD side, and It's especially good considering the file size. 

The framerate gets pretty choppy at certain parts, but I guess that's the nature of the screen recording process that was most likely used to capture the source video. I wouldn't say it's unwatchable, but it get's distracting. Sometimes the framerate is fine, and at other times (high action scenes, for example) it gets choppy.

That being said, this is probably one of the best rips we'll get until a DVD or BluRay comes out. I'm still hoping a version will come out that doesn't have the framerate issues, but I'm not holding my breath."

If you simply want to watch the show, the video quality is good enough. However, if you are a collector, I would recommend downloading another version."
,vivatpb5776,2013-02-06T12:13Z,"After watching the fourth episode (downloaded original three prior to downloading this .torrent), I still believe the video is stretched but I do not believe this ruins the overall viewing experience. The original .mkv files are 848*480. These episodes (in .mp4 format) are 720*404. As moebanzor referenced, better quality may not be available until a BRRip is uploaded."
,lontrus,2013-02-10T14:18Z,"i have everything stretched if i watch cause of the stupidity of the world ...

there was time when all screens were 4:3 and then they give us widescreen 16:9 and all the things you can watch on them have these black lines in lower and top of the screen .. lose the point to have widescreen if you still cant see all the picture in the screen... and that movie effect is retarded to cause your tv set have black edges and you probably will watch movies in the dark to so whats the point of the black edges on the screen ??? then they make a 21:9 wide screen and make more movies that are even more wider so next thing is 10m wide and 1m high screen where you need to watch if from 50m distance so you can make out what's on the screen"
,redvoler,2013-03-31T19:39Z,"Aspect ratio is annoyingly incorrect.  I understand this is from the original source, and no offence meant to the U/Ler.

However, now the series is being broadcast on Sky Atlantic, there are better D/Ls available - search ""House of Cards EZTV"".  "
