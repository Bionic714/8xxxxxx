River Monsters: Series 2
River Monsters Series 2 sees the return of host, biologist and extreme angler Jeremy Wade catching more extraordinary and supersized fish and investigating further freshwater mysteries and debunking weirder underwater myths. Jeremy will travel the globe and risk life and limb on his journey to uncover the truth about the dark secrets of our planet's rivers.
This 7-part series features mysterious predators with the potential to kill include the Giant Snakehead, Goliath Tigerfish, Stingray, Congo Catfish, Nile Perch, Sturgeon and the Zambezi Shark.


1)  Demon Fish 
Jeremy Wade journeys to the infamous Congo River in Central Africa in search of the Goliath Tiger Fish--quite possibly the world's most ferocious river fish. This supernatural monster predator pushes Jeremy to his physical and mental limit. It requires all of his skills and the help of a local witch doctor to catch one.

2)  Death Ray 
Jeremy Wade heads to The Mekong River in Thailand in search of one of the worlds largest and most terrifying river fish--the Giant Freshwater Stingray. Armed with a venomous ten-inch barb on the end of its whip like tail, this mysterious 700-pound River Monster is in a class of its own--and does not give up its secrets to Wade without a fight.

3)  Killer Snakehead 
Angler Jeremy Wade sets his sights on an aggressive Far Eastern predator that's now invading America's backyards. Accused of homicide, and said to breathe air and crawl on land, the Snakehead is a monster that sounds more like a gangster than a fish. Does its bite match the hype?

4)  Congo Killer 
Jeremy Wade travels to one of the few rivers left on earth that will still test a fisherman. The Congo, a river steeped in legends, and soaked in violence. One spirit in particular is said to lure fishermen from their boats to their death. Jeremy discovers that the truth is every bit as frightening as the myth.

5)  Alaskan Horror 
Deep in the Alaskan wilderness, people on two bottomless lakes have been vanishing without trace for thousands of years. Extreme angler, Jeremy Wade, searches for the lethal lake monster of native legend that's dragging them into the icy depths.

6)  Rift Valley Killer 
Jeremy Wade is on a quest to Africa's Rift Valley, the cradle of mankind, to explore the roots of fishing and the monsters these first fishermen faced. It's a dangerous place, but at its heart is a worthy prize, Africa's largest fresh water fish - the Nile Perch.

7)**** Hidden Predator **** 
Bull sharks are the most aggressive and unpredictable of all the sharks and thought to be responsible for more attacks on people than any other. Last year the biggest bull shark ever recorded was caught in a river in South Africa.
Jeremy Wade travels to this river to see if last year's catch was a one off or if there are more monsters out there, and discover if the presence of this known man-eater is a human tragedy just waiting to happen.
