Pianist and contemporary jazz icon Ramsey Lewis revisits his classic 1974 electric jazz-funk album Sun Goddess for 2011's Ramsey, Taking Another Look. Featuring a newly minted lineup of his '70s electric band, Taking Another Look features keyboardist Mike Logan, guitarist Henry Johnson, bassist Joshua Ramos, and drummer Charles Heath, all of whom reveal a knack for the funky, soulful jazz Lewis is reinvestigating here. Included are reworkings such classic '70s tracks as "Tambura," "Love Song," and "Jungle Strut." These are dance-oriented jazz-funk cuts with an organic, groove-oriented vibe that stick closely to the original '70s conception. In fact, the original version of Lewis' hit "Sun Goddess" is included and rounds out the album nicely. Which isn't to say that this is solely a retro-leaning venture. On the contrary, as with the rest of the album, tracks such as the dramatic, midtempo funk number "To Know Her" and the lush ballad "Sharing Her Journey" are expertly produced contemporary jazz numbers.
