KMSNano is an Offline KMS Activator that emulates a KMS server in the memory of
your computer and sends activation data back and forth attempting to activate
volume versions of Windows and Office. I have personally activated KMSNano without
having my lan drivers even installed on a fresh install of Windows 7.

There are other earlier versions that may or may not work currently.
You should always check for the latest version before using.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Activates:
Windows Vista Business/Enterprise Default/N/VL
Windows 7 Pro/Enterprise Default/N/VL
Windows 8 Pro/Enterprise Default/N/VL
Windows Server Std/Data 2008/2008R2/2012
Office/OfficeVL 2010/2013.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Retail-Only Versions of windows that will *NOT* activate are:
Vista Starter/Homebasic/Homepremium/Ultimate - Default/N/E
7 Starter/Homebasic/Homepremium/Ultimate - Default/N/E
8 core/coreN/ProWMC
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Requirements: . NET 4.0 or Windows 8

Instructions:

1. Extract Files to a folder. Ex: C:KMSNano
2. Run "Run Trigger.cmd" to install, or just KMSNano.exe for single activation
(TriggerKMS will run every boot, and if you have 30 days left or less, it will
re-run the activator)
3. Wait about 60secs while the files run in the background.
(It takes MUCH longer for Retail to VL Office 2013 conversion - Up to 12 mins at most.
It now plays music while activating so you know when it's done)
4. Done. Run the Check_Activation_All.cmd or All_Info.cmd to verify your activation.

For Windows 8, you can get the watermark to go away by auto-hiding the taskbar.

To fix any botched activations from other "hacktivators" or activation problems
in general, you can run admin command prompt command "SFC /SCANNOW"
I very much recommend running that command on older systems with stale system files
that may have a lot of inconsistencies.

Note that Pre-Release versions of Office or Windows will NEVER activate.
Get an actual release if you want to activate. (RTM or Retail)

Why use this program over any other activation method?
-It does not modify any of your system files.
-Because it's not a crack or a hack.
-Because it's the only way to get legit activation without using legit servers.
-Did I mention it activates ALL KMS activation software?

Change Log from v20:
- Fixed bug with permanent activated windows.
- Improved detection of Retail version.
- Add UpDown8 v1.3.exe for Evaluation Trial Windows 8 Enterprise.
(Inside kmsnano.exe - Extract using 7z or winrar to use)

Included is LaNano Documentation v1.2 by DrCoolZic.pdf
Please read this first if you have any problems.
DeleteTempELDI.exe just removes kmsnano temp directory if you had to taskkill
