Here is an installer I made for KMSnano v20.1
It lets you choose directory and will automatically install the trigger
and monitor activation. It displays some basic info for people during
install.

File: KMSNano_v20.1-Installer.exe
Size: 30.5MB
CRC32: D8878009
MD5: 840A80F6FA5FDA7B95AF9432D862817F
SHA-1: F9A8F1A7A6C0125F3E4061EBA2FDD075E0505271

What it does is extract KMSnano to a directory that you specify.
Then it runs Install.cmd that installs the TriggerKMS to monitor
activation every boot. Since TriggerKMS install also runs the activator
if necessary, this script will monitor activation programs and let you
know when they've stopped running and where your installed files are. I
know it's redundant to show where you installed the files after you
just selected a destination, but this is meant to help people who don't
understand very much.

I included an Uninstall-KMSnano.cmd with this one that will, as
predicted, uninstall both the trigger, and kmsnano folder.

It runs the same KMSnano.exe from the normal release.

Read KMSnano v20.1 info from my KMSnano v20.1 torrent at:

Note that I did not write any of the activation coding.

heldigard made KMSnano.
he gives thanks to many boards and people in his readme file.
Read it and you can find out who else are activation champions.

Screens are nearly identical to my v20 on my end, so I'ma just
repost the links to the images here. I just removed the version
number from the title on the command screen for future use.

You can upload this wherever you want, just don't be a douche like
ThumperDC and remove file versions and credits and try to get people
to visit your website to make money.

I don't make any money doing this, and I never will.
