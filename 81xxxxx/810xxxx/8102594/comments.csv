[V],wushdishmeen,2013-02-06T21:17Z,"Sorry about the setlist NFO on the 64k version.  I was in a rush on this particular day and so I forgot to hit Save on the NFO file before I started seeding.  If I saved the changed it would of messed up the torrent so I just let it go.

You can copy & paste the set list from the torrent description and fix it if you archive it along with the shows like I do.

Thanks for the support. "
