,melowdi,2013-02-05T15:36Z,"@arkentsone

appreciate it, no luck though

recieved is at 3.72 by now, still seeding

seems issue is here somewhere, not with the torrent"
,melowdi,2013-02-05T15:42Z,"@ Arkenstone

I could try and filter the trackers?

udp://tracker.openbittorrent.com:80
udp://tracker.publicbt.com:80
udp://tracker.istole.it:6969
udp://tracker.ccc.de:80

these seem ok right?"
,melowdi,2013-02-06T01:37Z,"@ Arkenstone

thank you

it was actually the iso that wouldn't finish, just now it did though, total of 3.74 recieved, but when i check the size in explorer i get the ca 3.37 i'm supposed to.

no idea what happened, weird stuff dude

will hash check before use :o)"
,Val777,2013-02-06T13:05Z,"Is this Windows 8 pro x64 VL??? 

Thanks."
,Val777,2013-02-06T20:38Z,"But what it is abour retail and VL versions, i read that KMSnano activator can not activate retail version? So this is the VL right?"
,Val777,2013-02-06T21:00Z,"So I already have Windows 8 pro x64 (link below) and if I understand this correctly if I enter the VL key during instalation it will activate using KMSnano, right? It does not depend on the install media, the licence (VL or retial) depend on the key you entered during instalation and can be changed in change product key option in windows, right?"

[V],murphy78,2013-02-19T10:36Z,"Quote from Daz, the guy who made Windows Loader, the most successful activation hacktool in history:

""I've seen a few developers that clearly don't have a clue what they're creating as they'll call their hacktivator a ""loader"". A loader is a type of boot loader, something that's run before Windows. So the only reason I can see them calling their software a loader is for it to try to get more attention due to the success of Windows Loader.

There won't ever be a loader for Windows 8. Heck, there won't even be a permanent activator for Windows 8. There is, however, MS Toolkit which is the cleanest method, and it's almost permanent if you run it as a service.""

Don't believe in permanent activators friends... they don't work. Just type ""SLMGR /DLV"" in command prompt and you'll find out exactly how permanent it is."

,Kairu92,2013-03-29T04:27Z,"For anyone complaining about how this is not a Windows 8 Pro ISO: It is. It's also the Home edition. It's based on the key you enter. I tested this with the in-place upgrade. When you enter in a Home key, the license shows info for Windows 8. I hit Back, put in the Pro key. It shows license information for Windows 8 Pro. This is to avoid any confusion in the future. It's like the AIO installs for Windows 7 that have all editions. Simple registry changes, told apart by each serial key. Same content. There's some nice Pro keys that work on the list. Try them. You'll get the proper result.
