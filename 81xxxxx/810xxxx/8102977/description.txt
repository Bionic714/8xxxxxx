There are currently no permanent activators for Windows 8.
Do NOT use the fake K.J. or P_v28 hacktivators as these are NOT safe. 
These will not pass online validation and fail with Windows Updates.

What to use: KMS (Key Management Service) to activate for 180 days
(6 months) at a time. At the end of 180 days you can re-activate as
many times as you like, this is near perfect permanent activation.

KMSnano v20.1 developed by Heldigard from MDL forums is included.
