Worlds Toughest Fixes: Series Two
World's Toughest Fixes goes inside some of the most daunting repair jobs imaginable. Each episode follows host Sean Riley as he pushes himself to the limit while working with some of the world's top riggers. A professional rigger with a passion for adventure, Riley isn't afraid to strap on a hazmat suit or attach himself to a live high-voltage power line to get the job done. He's seen more than his fair share of perilous situations, but on each job he has to show the crew he knows his stuff. Whether dangling from ropes hundreds of feet in the air or diving close to a construction vessel's propellers, Riley's mechanical know-how takes viewers inside the marvels of large-scale industry.
