,simbamax,2013-02-05T07:32Z,"Sadly each time I try to download something of yours it reads- error: oPEN FAILS,FILE NOT FOUND.
Anyone know what this means and why? I have no problems downloading from anyone else. :-("
,east215,2013-02-05T11:54Z,Thanks!
,simbamax,2013-02-05T19:55Z,"Please anyone can advise me why I am unable to watch these EE downloads from h20bagger? Am I doing something wrong? 
Thanks!"
[T],h2obagger,2013-02-05T23:44Z,"We feel your pain simbamax but since reports of issues are very few I feel quite safe in saying the answer to your question is ""Yes"". 
Knowing nothing of your setup or software there really isn't much I can offer in the way of help but by the message you mention it would seem that the file you are trying to open was not fully downloaded successfully.  As to why I don't have a clue.  I expect you will find better help @ the support pages of whatever apps you are using to download and / or view the files and ...as always google is your friend."
,simbamax,2013-02-06T08:54Z,Thanks so much for the reply H20..I am really baffled as Ive downloaded off here for years and never had this message..It happens every time.I'm gana give it another try and see.I really appreciate you doing EE for us fans and would love to watch yours instead of waiting for the omnibus.. :-)
[T],h2obagger,2013-02-08T00:36Z,"simbamax The EE Omnibus episodes I found appeared to be using different codecs, could be that your player doesn't like some formats.  Might be time to try out a different media player, others have mentioned VLC as a fine option.  It's open source & multi-platform so should run on just about whatever setup you have.
