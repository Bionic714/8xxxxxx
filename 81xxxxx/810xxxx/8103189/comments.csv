,tensigh2,2013-02-05T11:07Z,"Thanks! Just out of curiosity, why do you include Rush's commercials? I don't mean the parodies (those ROCK), I mean Rush's commercials for flowers, tax services, etc. I don't care if it's Rush's voice, it's just a scripted commercial. Not complaining, just asking...."
[V],CAPTAIN7SS,2013-02-05T19:51Z,"....rush's commercials are part of the program sent to the stations...most of the time they are very tightly placed behind the show and there is almost never any room to cut it out without hearing the cut and you get a hiccup in the sound..there is seldom any dead space like with local commercials..i can fade it out and that is very tedious...plus he does well with those commercials...to take out all the commercials takes me about 1.5 hours....lately, if i leave in the commercials that are midway thru each 1/2 hour...1/4 after....1/4 till....which are the floating breaks..and can be anywhere....i can get it done in about 40 minutes...i cut out the last break...the bottom break...leave in the one minute news update...and the top of the hour news break...that make it about 45 minutes for each piece...to get it all out makes it about 39 minutes...and takes almost another hour...to get it to where i can't hear the cut with a fade i and fade out....this show ends at 3pm and is 2 hours later than the national broadcast and the program engineer [?] has been excellent in not stepping on the show because he's got 2 hours to map it out before they put it on the air...they fill in the gaps with music...i could upload this this in 10 minutes if i left it alone...left it as is with all the commercials...instead of 1.5 to 2 hours later with all the editing...i'm not sure if it is worth it...this broadcast with commercials and all, is more accurate than most stations...almost never do they delete rush with an overrun...koa radio is a huge station in colorado and has a news presence , that news update is good to keep if you are listening months later ...so....would you like the show fast..uncut..or 2 hours later with most commercials gone ?...either way is still better than the podcast because the podcast seems stuffed in a vacuum with no ads and no music "
,tensigh2,2013-02-06T00:30Z,"That's cool. I was just curious.

When I cut out commercials, I used Audacity and it only takes about 20 minutes. If you load your mp3 file into Audacity, amplify them and then you can see a pattern when the commercials start. The commercials last anywhere from 3 - 5 minutes, so all you have to do is find the starting point (which is pretty easy since Rush always ends his segments with that sound), highlight the segment for about 3-5 minutes, listen and adjust. Then hit delete and it's gone. 

I also started recording when the commercial breaks take place, which helps in predicting them. But once that's done, you just reexport the file as an mp3. 

Like I said, doing this, it takes about 15-20 minutes to accurately cut out all commercials."
[V],CAPTAIN7SS,2013-02-06T02:03Z,"audacity is far too slow and bulky...takes way too long to load it and way too long to export it as a mp3....uses lame...the best thing about audacity is you can expand it down to the finest split in sound...export it as wav and then convert it....i listened to what you uploaded in the past....rush shows and whatever you were using then was giving you harsh breaks and obvious hiccups...the cut was very obvious...in order to avoid that you've got to do a little fade right at that break point so its invisible....and when you miss it you do it again , test it again, and again....takes a lot of time...there are 4 breaks and 4 returns....each needing a fade to cover the cut-off and cut-in sound....i'll practice with audacity some more to see what you mean"
,tensigh2,2013-02-06T12:57Z,"My goal was simple: never have to hit fast forward. It didn't really matter to me if the transition was smooth or not. It's not music, it's just a mono radio broadcast, and one I won't listen to more than once, so quality doesn't really matter.

I haven't really heard the fades on yours at every break, just occasionally. Either way, I'm grateful for your uploads.

As far as Audacity, it might load slow but it also lets you save templates for the id3 tags. When I download your files I have to add the tags or else they get lost in my iPhone/pod. Audacity is slow when it loads and exports (that's mostly LAME that slows it down), but it does let you cut out the commercials. You can also do fades as well.

Either way, thanks for being so consistent in loading these. Since the wrong guy won the election I don't listen that much anymore, but it's nice to see these high quality files available."
[V],CAPTAIN7SS,2013-02-06T23:56Z,"...the fades you hear are about 5 seconds down then up again with the middle cut out....the ones you don't hear are at the beginning of most of the segments that are only about 1/10 of a second and go from `minus 48 decibels up to where it was...or zero....the hard edge is gone and it sounds like it was supposed to be there...and smooth...then ...sometimes the ending edge of a segment has to be done too...very time comsuming...because you have to test it...listen...then undo it....do it again..test it again...etc...and then sometimes, on my usual player it's silent but on windows media player you can hear it....so you start again....somedays all the breaks are there and it's easy....some stations are just terrible...a lot of stations just skip that last one minute bit at the end , just before the news...just run the commercials right up to the news...and they do the same at the bottom of the hour...come back late and he's already talking...and you don't hear the intro or the topic...there is nothing you can do with that except go to a late night broadcast to get that segment..
audacity's timer is too complicated and too easy to make an error...if your computer shuts off with audacity still running and recording i haven't learned how to recover those recorded aud files held in the software...i follow the help files and get nothing....
..i deliberately put no tags into the mp3's...that way people can do whatever they want with it...never had an i-pod...don't have an i-phone...so i don't know the problem you are having...but i've never had an mp3 player either..oh well..i've been playing around with audacity version 2.0.2 this afternoon...can't find the settings tab....records great but no way to set the mp3 levels??...it's not in preferences...they keep making it more difficult to use with each version..anyway any hints on audacity will be appreciated"
[V],CAPTAIN7SS,2013-02-07T00:01Z,...it seems some people jump on this within seconds of when i upload it...how??..are the doing some rss feed thing on this site??...it's as if they get notified immediately...do you know what they are using??
,tensigh2,2013-02-07T01:30Z,"I've never had Audacity shut off while I encode, so I'm not sure what your problem is there. It takes about 5-10 minutes to encode an hour long MP3 of Rush (again, they're not high fidelity tracks, they're mono at maybe 32 Khz). 

Like I said, my goal was ""never hit the FF button"". I usually listen to Rush on either my Android or iPhone while I commute. I'm in Tokyo so trains get really crowded and having to hit FF isn't always easy. So I can live with cuts that are slightly abrupt if it means never having to hit the FF button.

It sounds like you're doing some pretty cool stuff with your editor. I always cut out the commercials by visually looking at the tracks. I wanted to write a plug in to analyze the audio but never got around to it (cool thing about Audacity - it's open source)

Of course, the drawback of open source software is that they often don't have good documentation as you mentioned. But like I said, < 15 minutes I had all commercials cut, so that worked fine for a track I'd only listen to once.

I don't think anyone's using an RSS reader - I think they're just anxious to hear your tracks! It's Rush, after all! 

Again, thanks for uploading these. I don't listen much anymore, but it's great for those of us who can't actively listen to Rush live (he's on live from 2 - 5 AM here in Tokyo!)"
