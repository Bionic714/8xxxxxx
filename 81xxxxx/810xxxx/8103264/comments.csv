This one is truly special, do yourself a favor and get it. 
Probably THE show of the whole 2012 tour.

Remaining two, equally impressive Georgia shows, can be found here:
18th The Tabernacle, Atlanta - http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8103818/
19th Cox Capitol Theatre, Macon - http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8104102

One more thing that should be mentioned - there's no overlap between shows.
3 nights, 3 completely different setlists, not a single song was played twice."
