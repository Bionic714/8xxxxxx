Gov't Mule
2012-10-17
Georgia Theatre, 
Athens, GA 


Leading up to the release of The Georgia Bootleg Box, the recently released six disc set that takes fans back to a three night run across Georgia in 1996, GovΓÇÖt Mule celebrated with similar run, with one being held at the same venue, as it was way back when.
That one was this night at the historic Georgia Theatre that, though recently restored and quite a bit nicer than it was in ΓÇÖ96, still holds that certain degree of special that can only be felt, not explained. 
(The other two stops were at AtlantaΓÇÖs Tabernacle, as opposed to the Roxy in ΓÇÖ96, and MaconΓÇÖs Cox Capitol Theatre, as opposed to Elizabeth Reed Music Hall in ΓÇÖ96.)
