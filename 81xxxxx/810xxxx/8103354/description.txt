The album was originally released as vinyl in 1962 so we decided to use
REISSUE tag.

This is a nice all-around set by the 1962 Duke Ellington Orchestra. Whether
it be the lightweight but fun "Taffy Twist," "I'm Gonna Go Fishin'" (the
theme from Anatomy of a Murder) or the many songs revived from decades
earlier (such as "What Am I Here For?," "Black and Tan Fantasy" and "Jump
for Joy"), this CD is filled with consistently swinging music.
