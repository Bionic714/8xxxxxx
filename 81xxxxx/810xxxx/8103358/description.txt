This disc was created mainly for oral bottoms to play while preparing and servicing their top partner. For each section of music, a specific sexual activity is recommended.

1) Disrobing one another (Parcels)
2) Silence - 30 seconds
3) Openness and touching (Mahler Alleghetto) - Nice to do with seated on the floor facing one another, gentle fingertip caresses, light kisses, stroking hair, easy-going nipple play that arouses both, heightens sensuality and creates erections.
4) Oral bottom put partner of back and begins gentle oral work on partner's penis and nutsack (Song of Our Ancestors)
5. Licking his cock and perineum (Spirits)
6. Oral work on perinem and below, rimming and licking his anus (Satyricon drums and flute)
7. Lubing the finger and exploring his rectum, with gentle prostate massage. 
8. Transition - 30 seconds of silence
9. Return to oral intercourse and sucking his cock to orgasm (Helicopters)
10. Afterglow as he recovers from his orgasm and you cuddle
11. Silence - 60 seconds 

(Music can be turned off here or continued to
12. Afterwards - Continued cuddling or preparing for parting or sleep. 

The entire cycle lasts about 55 minutes. I guess you could start over, or start again and let HIM do YOU!
