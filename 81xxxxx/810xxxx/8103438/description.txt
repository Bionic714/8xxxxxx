After fighting in a war, the young knight Maximo returns home to find his kingdom in shambles. Not only is the countryside filled with the undead, but the four wise Sorceresses have been imprisoned throughout the Kingdom; and to make matters worse, his girlfriend, Princess Sophia, has been forced to marry the scoundrel Achille. Now it's up to you to help Maximo rescue the Sorceresses, stop the marriage, and restore good to the kingdom. These tasks won't be easy, but you'll have Maximo's sword and shield and the power of the gods on your side.
