[T],ajaxen94,2013-02-05T16:10Z,"@neeliesu thank you for your consistant comments one of the few who actually do thank me, hope you have enjoyed Mrs Brown, sad that it has to end for now"
,ralphjg,2013-02-05T17:33Z,I am new to this but I am also a fan of MBB. I just want to say thank you in advance. 
,neeliesu,2013-02-06T08:30Z,"@ajaxen94, A 'thank you' is a small price to pay for all the effort you put in for people you don't even know, I truly appreciate what you do! Considering how many people download what you share, I'm always surprised at the lack of comments.   I've just read that since winning the award for best sitcom at the National TV Awards Brendon O'Carroll plans to do a series 4 :)"
[T],ajaxen94,2013-02-06T11:22Z,"@neeliesu, well you're right we will be having a new series next year,the reason i think you don't see many comments now is that people are having to use proxies to download, because there isp is blocking the sight and you can't comment or upload with proxies,that is also my problem but i get around that by using a VPN and there are plenty of free ones to be had if people know what to look for"
