,zach1217,2013-02-05T05:17Z,"I agree this show makes me sad and angry at the same time it is such a shame what people do to animals no matter what breed they are I can tell you though I have 2 bulls and I see the looks I get when people find out I have them along with my 2 boys let me tell you right now,they play with the boys like the are kids themselves, and when I need to go away for meetings I can board the plane knowing they are safe because those dogs would never allow any harm to come to my family"
