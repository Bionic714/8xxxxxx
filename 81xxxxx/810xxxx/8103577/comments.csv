,keeganzo,2013-02-05T04:39Z,You mean in the search bar?? That would be due to how they have programmed the search bar - probably not to accept any characters...only letters & numbers
[T],mr2wingz,2013-02-05T04:48Z,"thanks keeganzo you may be right about that I dont see anyone else using them,I will just have to do the same."
