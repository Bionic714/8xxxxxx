An explosive drama set in the early 1930s, following a black jazz
band in London at a time of extraordinary change.

Music journalist Stanley Mitchell befriends The Louis Lester Band
and helps its rise to fame from playing in a basement jazz club to
the illustrious Imperial Hotel. At first, the band is treated with
hostility by the hotel's elderly audience, most of whom have never
heard jazz music nor seen black musicians before. However
one table of young aristocrats love their new music and invite them
to play at a garden party.
