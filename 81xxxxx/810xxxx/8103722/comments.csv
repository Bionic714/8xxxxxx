,ThaWulf96,2013-02-19T00:45Z,"I plan on uling all monstercat releases this year, unfortunately they just release ep's so far :/"
,yomamaisonfier,2013-02-20T23:35Z,"Seems to be the only Monstercat Best of 2012 on TPB, very good audio.
Only problem I have is how the Album Mix is split into two parts for some reason... The actual one is in one part, and it's very incontinent having two, plus if you try to stick the two together there's about a 2 second gap between the songs. Other than that, great torrent.
Will seed until I see I have done enough (I usually go about 1:10 :) )"
,ThaWulf96,2013-02-21T00:37Z,"I actually noticed that :[
I got it from bandcamp like all their releases so idk what happened to the file."
