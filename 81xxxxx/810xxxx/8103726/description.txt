Developed by Reppo, the PRR Baldwin Centipede is in Pennsylvania Railroad black livery. As well as a highly detailed cab interior, the locomotive also features a fully-detailed engine start-up and realistic engine scripting. Also included are a PRR baggage car and PRR dining car, the latter with a finely detailed passenger view. 

The Horseshoe Curve (available separately) is required to play the included scenarios.
