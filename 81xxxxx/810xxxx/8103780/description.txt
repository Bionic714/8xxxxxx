"Recoil"

While investigating the murder of a young 
woman, Castle and Beckett find evidence 
that links her death with Senator William 
H. Bracken (guest star Jack Coleman 
returns), the man responsible for Beckett's 
mother's murder. Determined to finally 
bring Bracken to justice, Beckett soon 
realizes that things are far more 
complicated than they seem.
