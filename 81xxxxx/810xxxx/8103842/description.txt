"Fright Night"

When Carrie is invited to a Halloween party in the 
city by Larissa, she decides to invite Walt to go 
with her to keep her company. It doesnt take long 
before the night goes awry and Carrie is forced to 
babysit Larissa, who has clearly taken too many 
drugs. Walt finds himself in an uncomfortable 
position after a party guest gets a little too 
close for comfort. Elsewhere, Maggie convinces 
Mouse to go with her to Sebastians Halloween 
party at the diner to help keep tabs on him. After 
Doritts attempt to sneak out of the house is 
thwarted, she discovers hanging out with her 
father isnt so bad.
