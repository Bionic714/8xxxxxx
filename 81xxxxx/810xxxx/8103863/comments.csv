,Blades11c,2013-02-06T01:37Z,"Your my own personal Jesus Christ Yify. One question I have is, if you ever look at these comments, are you trying to awaken the masses with the movies you upload? And if the answer is yes, do you have any wise words for those who have recently woken up?"

@Blades11c: not to speak for YIFY, but as an awake person myself, the best advice is to never react. Pause, consider, and act. If you react you are being manipulated by other forces, whatever force triggered the reaction, etc.
The key to staying awake during the growing and shrinking of the awareness field of mankind, is to be vibrationally transparent enough to go with the flow, without allowing emotion to drag you away from wherever you are centered at/in the moment.
Emotion= Energy in Motion
Hence, if you are experiencing emotion, you are moving away from center, and away from whatever your initial goal was.
Not to disparage emotion. It just shouldn't be able to seize control of your rational, waking mind.
That control is real discipline, and it is ""upriver"" of physical discipline. Master that, and the rest follows.
But expect to have to master every emotion on the road to that control.
Lots of paths, but only one road."
