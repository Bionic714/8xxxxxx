,tflagger997,2013-02-26T21:16Z,"iolllo - What are you smoking and where did you get it?!?

This is a total POS (bombed at both box office and rentals), but it is so bad it can be funny.  

But to claim it has a good story is just silly.  You seem to just be advertising the other site, but at least you were polite (if silly) about it. ;)

Thanks YIFY!  It may be bad, but I am bored..."

,Thanzim,2013-03-17T00:58Z,"Thanks to the uploader! Movie was OK as i expected it to be! I usually watch all the movies at film.handitrade.com because they have HD's but they didn't have this one so im happy to have piratebay :) Good torrent quality - A9 V9,"
