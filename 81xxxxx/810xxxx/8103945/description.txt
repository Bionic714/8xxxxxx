"Fright Night"

When Carrie is invited to a Halloween party in the
city by Larissa, she decides to invite Walt to go
with her to keep her company. It doesn t take long
before the night goes awry and Carrie is forced to
babysit Larissa, who has clearly taken too many
drugs. Walt finds himself in an uncomfortable
position after a party guest gets a little too
close for comfort. Elsewhere, Maggie convinces
Mouse to go with her to Sebastian s Halloween
party at the diner to help keep tabs on him. After
Doritt s attempt to sneak out of the house is
thwarted, she discovers hanging out with her
father isn t so bad
