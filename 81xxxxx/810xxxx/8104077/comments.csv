Daredevil science geek Greg Foot is prepared to attempt anything to find answers to some of life's weirder frequently-asked questions. In the first episode of this irreverent, stunt-filled series, Greg suffers to find out what humans taste of, heads to Reading Festival to work out whether the human race could actually shift the planet by jumping at exactly the same time, and finds out whether a bellyflop could kill you.
