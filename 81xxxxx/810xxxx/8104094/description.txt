ReleaseNotes:

When Alice in Chains released their self-titled album in 1995, it showed the band
moving in a different direction from the one they'd explored previously. Jerry
Cantrell was singing lead on more tracks than ever before, Layne Staley's vocals were heavily layered (double-tracked), and the grunge sound they'd had turned into a more sludge-metal type sound. Staley died 7 years after the release of that album and it appeared for a while that Alice in Chains had died with him. I worship Layne Staley, but I realize he was not solely responsible for creating the Alice in Chains sound; but, he did leave a large void when he passed away. Since Alice in Chains announced they were recording a new album with new vocalist/guitarist William DuVall, the question running through people's minds has been "Can they do it without Layne?" Well, after steadily listening to this album since it leaked, I can tell you, in all honesty, that they can.

"Black Gives Way to Blue" picks up pretty much where that last album left off. This is not "Dirt Pt. II," but Alice in Chains for 2009 and even with Staley gone, the album still retains the recognizable Alice in Chains sound. There are moments where you can not only feel Staley's presence, you can almost hear his voice. While William DuVall is technically Layne Staley's replacement, Jerry Cantrell handles a large majority of lead vocal duties...But make no mistake, this is not a Jerry Cantrell solo album. This is very much an Alice in Chains album. When DuVall and Cantrell harmonize together in the way Staley and Cantrell did so many years ago, it's pretty clear that Alice in Chains is back.
