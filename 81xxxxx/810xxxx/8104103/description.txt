Glasgow quartet Kassidy return with their follow-up to 'Hope St.' with more of their 70s-throwback folk rock. On their second album, 'One Man Army', they aim for a sweetly emollient guitar sound and layer it with something distinctive, too. "Driven by Fools" here in original demo form, is essentially Barrie O'Neill's baritone and a disconsolate piano riff, but there's a bleakness to his voice that takes the song to a haunting place, which is certainly reminiscent of Fleet Foxes. "Get By" piles on Kings of Leon-ish raucousness, but the chorus is carried by four-part harmonies that emphasize how good their voices are together. "Maybe I'll Find" with it's warm, acappella chorus ΓÇô "Maybe I'll find that I need you more than you'll ever need me" ΓÇô may or may not be addressed to O'Neill's girlfriend, Lana Del Rey; either way, it's worth a listen.
'One Man Army' is packed with soaring indie-pop songs, and the band, who took inspiration for their name from the classic 1969 movie 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid', produce a bold and strong record!
