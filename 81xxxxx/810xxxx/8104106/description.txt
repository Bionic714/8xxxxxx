"Pilot"

Trauma Chief Jorge Villanueva treats what 
appears to be an attempted suicide by car only 
to discover that the crash victim suffered a 
life-threatening brain aneurysm. Renowned 
neurosurgeon Dr. Ty Wilson is shaken by the 
case of 11-year-old Quinn McDaniels, whose 
soccer injury reveals a much graver problem. 
Workaholic Dr. Sydney Napur solves a case that 
had the rest of the hospital staff stumped. 
Meanwhile, Dr. Sung Park performs high-tech 
deep brain stimulation on a patient with 
uncontrollable hand tremors.
