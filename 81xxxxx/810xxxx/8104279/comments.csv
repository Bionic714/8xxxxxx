Thanks!"
,baybeh,2013-02-10T05:29Z,"quality, anyone? and how many episodes are these?"
,yu4657,2013-02-14T19:48Z,"This is episodes 1-13 (complete Season 1), WEBRips, 720p, H.264, AAC 2.0"
,toxicdav3,2013-02-15T08:44Z,"Screen capture is not in sync with the playback framerate which shows extended jitters. S01E06 has a brief moment when the Windows 7 taskbar shows. The encoder is using wireless to stream which can explain some skips.

Video quality is watchable, audio quality is poor. Wait for the HDTV or Bluray rips."
