,alkx6470,2013-02-10T11:23Z,"Audio and video quality are very good, although the audio bit rate could be a bit higher.

There is a ""StyLishSaLH"" watermark in the lower right of the screen for the first three minutes of the movie.  I don't understand the need for the watermark, and it definitely makes me less likely to download and seed StyLishSaLH releases in the future.

Also -- and very importantly -- the rip has a flaw which means when it's played with VLC Player (and perhaps other players as well), you can't manually jump past the 1:39:35 mark.  After that point in the movie, you can never jump beyond the point where you are.

I also experienced a segment near the end of the movie with about 3-5 seconds of video and audio distortion.  This not only is a disappointing flaw in the rip, it also throws off synchronization with the subtitles from that point on."
