,DSfreakazoid,2013-03-02T01:18Z,will it work with 6.1.2
,brtndr,2013-03-03T14:38Z,Does not work for 6.1.2. This is version 1.0 and you need 1.5. 
,haunterd,2013-03-24T00:53Z,brtndr your comment is ignorant.  It does work for ios 6-6.1.2  hence its creation.  Go home
,loremnon,2013-03-29T00:00Z,iOS 6.1.3 just came out... sigh... there needs to be a new jailbreak soon... Or maybe I will wait a little bit?
