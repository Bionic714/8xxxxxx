Main issue is the auto deletion of the setup file, make sure to do the usually add to exclusions the folders being used (which may include Local/Temp)... the MAIN issue is it's not NOD32 that's deleting the setup file or the TNOD.exe file it's your other anti-spyware.

Malwarebytes is detecting it as a trojan, in order to fix this first restore the file and then scan the file, it will popup and you can then right-click on the file and then click "Add to Ignore List".

Do this on other programs to because it's not ESET NOD32 (otherwise disable everything in NOD32 until restart and then install and add to exclusions on all programs).

Been running ESET NOD32 Smart Security for over 5 years now and it's still too expensive lol ;).
