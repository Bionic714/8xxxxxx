,klearlycanadian,2013-02-07T05:07Z,Get out of here this version is true multithreaded. 10 hrs of movies converted and burned in under 30 min awesome.  Gives freemake a run for its money.    Highly Recommended and follow the guide in the NFO file. yes windows firewall can add block rules under advanced settings
,skillzorz,2013-02-09T02:42Z,New with this version: CUDA support so that your nVidia graphics card can be used to crunch numbers and speed up the conversion process.
,ghostrx,2013-02-21T23:33Z,Please release 5.0.0.43 Ching_Liu!
,stratos80,2013-02-23T22:13Z,"The application works just fine. But when it is closed acrodist.exe (Acrobat) goes ape shit and trashes hdd. WTF ?! This happens with unpatched exe too.

v3 didn't do this, but it fails to render some mp4 files."
