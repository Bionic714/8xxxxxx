Now I don't have to do all that annoying sfx stuff.
*sits back and drinks a cold one*"
,EliteG91,2013-02-05T07:40Z,"Hey man, love this. Thanks so much. One thing, I downloaded the Win 8 Pro w/ WMC. Will it ever be possible to ""activate"" that version of W8 with this program? I used the KJ Activator, and works fine, but I sure love KMSnano alot more. :)"
[V],murphy78,2013-02-05T08:22Z,"Oh man bro... you have no idea how bad you f***ed up your computer with that KJ hacktivator.

run an admin cmd prompt ""slmgr /dlv"" to see the real activation status."
,Jer88,2013-02-05T10:21Z,"keep getting an error on the check program, keeps saying ""Error: Product activation failed"".

I'm on Windows 7 Enterprise, build 7601. (Still have the 'Windows is not genuine' thingy on my bottom right of desktop.)"
[V],murphy78,2013-02-05T10:43Z,"jer88, thanks for that info. does any other offline kms activator work for you? I just activated a 7 sp1 enterprise today using 19.1... can you see if that works for you?"
[V],murphy78,2013-02-05T10:46Z,"I'm prolly going to get some sleep, but you can try running a ""SFC /SCANNOW"" or resort to a ""SLMGR /REARM"" if that doesn't work. Then retry activator.

You can also extract the kmsnano.exe to a subdirectory with 7z or winrar and try running manual.cmd

When the virtual machine has been up for like a minute, click the little EL activation button.

Good luck."
,alvester,2013-02-05T12:04Z,"I'm facing a weird issue after running this activator. Every time I run it, the option in Folder Options to show and hide the hidden files and folders goes blank. In order to fix it I have to restart the windows. I'm not implying that there's a virus in it but this kind of behaviour is done by a virus. Well its not a major issue and neither it harms the windows but its an issue none the less. Maybe its a bug. Can you confirm it murphy?"
,Sonic_27,2013-02-05T16:58Z,THANKS murphy78
,Adam1438,2013-02-05T17:20Z,"Hey can i use this to activate Office 2010 ProPlus VL x86 on Win7 ultimate sp1 OEM x64?

Thanks!"
,Bbmania,2013-02-05T20:23Z,"Does it work with W8 Enterprise 9200?
Thank you"
[V],murphy78,2013-02-05T23:27Z,"alvester I did notice that there are some unintented things going on in this release. I think that it is not supposed to go in the normal program folders on an x64 but the x86 one. That might be the cause of the problem.

You guys can just use the previous versions, this is just a install release, it does not fix problems.

Feel free to uninstall and use a different one. I've tested the uninstall and it correctly removes all files and trigger task"
[V],murphy78,2013-02-05T23:28Z,"adam there are better solutions that are more refined for office 2010. Technically it should work, but it's more geared for win8 and office 2013"
,Adam1438,2013-02-06T00:49Z,"Thankyou for the reply!
""more refined for office 2010"">is MS Toolkit by CODYQX4 one of them???"
[V],murphy78,2013-02-06T04:30Z,"The newer ones are the only ones I really know about, sorry adam"
,alvester,2013-02-06T10:10Z,BTW I personally think that we don't really need a installer version but thats just my opinion.
