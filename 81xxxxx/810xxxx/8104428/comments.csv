,cantech,2013-02-16T11:45Z,"I use a decent projector at 1600 X 1200 to an 8 x 5 throw with surround sound upper midfi equipment and the quality of this picture is stellar both sound and Picture/Audio wise it is what it is. 10 out of 10 on both counts for a 720p. Rip
Thanks 3Li I will be following your offerings"
