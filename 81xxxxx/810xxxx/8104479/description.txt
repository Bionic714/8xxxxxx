Selim, the glum owner of an Istanbul men's clothing store. Business is continually bad, his one employee is pestering him for a raise, his family is barely getting by on his meager profits and everyone else seems to have money except him. Until one fateful evening when Selim gets into a taxi containing a briefcase accidentally left behind by the vehicle's previous passenger. The briefcase is overstuffed with stacks of American $100 bills. Selim stops the taxi and gets out with the briefcase to locate its owner, but the man is nowhere to be found. Shortly after, Selim learns the man was a bank clerk who stole the cash (totaling $450,000) from his place of employment.
