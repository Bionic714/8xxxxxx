,csgsdad,2013-03-13T22:05Z,I have tons of codecs including FLAC codecs on my system (Windows XP) but these won't play. Any recommendations on which codec will work?
,twisterjh,2013-04-08T15:32Z,it play's fine on my Windows 7 64-Bit with Foobar2000. what player are you using? Foobar supports FLAC native. I have a bunch more Pink Floyd's on vinyl that I'd love to record but I no longer have a turntable (gonna buy a Music-Hall MMF 5.1 soon) I also need a HQ USB Audio Interface but they all appear to be cheap crap on amazon. I can only use the Line-in on my MBP because on my windows PC's the line-in is friggen mono even though it says stereo...
