I'll edit the description for now but this is the iso file for "The Last Story" videogame on the Wii, the PAL version. However, the English audio has been removed and has been switched with Japanese audio instead. So essentially, Japanese Audio/Eng Sub. For those that want to enjoy the game in a different way.

For those who start leeching, I generally keep my upload up at all times, however, as I do livestreaming and other things, I keep it down at a bare minimum of 50kb/s. However, when I go to sleep, it always goes to max (about 2.5mb). So don't give up on leeching/seeding!

I hope everyone enjoys this as much as I did!
