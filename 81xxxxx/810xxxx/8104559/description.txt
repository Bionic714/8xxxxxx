This torrent contains the Japanese ISO of The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords+, AKA Zeruda no Densetsu: Yottsu no Tsurugi Purasu, which is the Japanese version of The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures for the Nintendo Gamecube.

The Japanese version is unique because it contains an extra game, Navi Trackers, that was scrapped in other regions. Read all about the game here: http://zelda.wikia.com/wiki/Navi_Trackers

I'm mirroring up here because it's really tough to find on the net, only existing in about one spot. Confirmed working on the Dolphin emulator, though it should also work on Japanese and/or modded systems. Just open shine-g4sj.rar with your favorite unrar utility to get the ISO.

Please help me seed this rare game! ;)
