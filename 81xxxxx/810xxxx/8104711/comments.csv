,felandi,2013-02-06T13:22Z,"Everything works superbly, no language issues or install. Crack is included in the setup process without having to copy and paste anything. It runs without origin. However, there is no limited edition content in the safe."
,frankfontaine77,2013-02-07T06:05Z,"Works perfectly whe installed.
If you get errors installing directX, just go to C:windows/sysWOW64/directx enable the view of hidden items and then you'll see a folder named websetup. Erase all of its contents and restart the installation. This should do it.
Thank you!"
,Klamrian,2013-02-07T10:31Z,"Sorry if this is a silly question but is this some kind of rip?

The reloaded edition is 11 GB, this is less than 5 - and supposedly has more content.

I know that languages etc. can account for significant size differences , but not this much.

Can anybody explain - 
- does this have more content?
- if so then why is it so small?"
,Klamrian,2013-02-07T22:36Z,"Please ignore the spam which the stupid fuck tamogdjeje has been spreading all over the place, and go back to the last real post, which is the one I submitted.

I would really like a helpful answer to my question."
,Klamrian,2013-02-07T22:37Z,"... and tamogdjeje has been deleted and hopefylly banned, which is why the post I complained about is no longer there ...."
,WayneJ,2013-02-09T17:21Z,Its because the compress the video which lowers the size by a lot.Just like Blackbox releases.Hope that helps
,Klamrian,2013-02-10T12:20Z,"Thanks Wayne, this is what I suspected."
