,tnyp,2013-02-06T22:39Z,"@pjones452 - This movie was released in Russia in August of 2012.  It's one of the rare cases where the US doesn't get first theatrical release for a movie.  By the time this hits theaters in the US (March 15, 2013) this BluRay will have been long since released in Europe."
