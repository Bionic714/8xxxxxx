[T],theburningbush,2013-02-05T10:12Z,"the *instant* I posted the 1st message, it started coming down...thanks, TvTeam!"
,skillzorz,2013-02-05T10:56Z,No one has the last fraction of a percent of the .avi. Can someone just seed it for a little bit so I can continue it?
,zippospam,2013-02-05T11:04Z,stuck at 99.6 mmmmmmm halp?
,BoonesFerry,2013-02-05T11:16Z,"yes stuck at 99.7%

,forgono,2013-02-05T11:23Z,"Yeah, has anyone got this whole torrent and watched any of it?? I've been stuck at 99.7% for a while and that usually means it's a file full of bs."

,JarjarTwink,2013-02-05T13:10Z,"this is the last time i donwload your shit TVteam, you fucking spam the pirate bay with stuff that never has seeds anyway "
,js99912,2013-02-05T13:47Z,"This is a FAKE file, it is not a MEDIA file at all.  I appreciate your up, but for the first time this skull-user uploaded FAKE!!"
,js99912,2013-02-05T13:48Z,"this one is fake, working one here http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8104755/The.Colbert.Report.2013.02.04.720p.HDTV.x264-ORENJI"
,gunbravo,2013-02-05T13:53Z,"Fuck you TVTeam and your crappy torrenting.com shit site.
If you're not gonna seed your torrent, why post it?
I guess it's your new strategy to give partial files so people will be forced to go to your site and download it there.
What a douche bag. Long live VTV, EZTV, and the rest. They don't keep posting the same shit over and over and what they do post is seeded well.
I'll wait for VTV to upload todays eppesode and never again will seed your crap. "
,JooPe666,2013-02-05T14:42Z,"WTF TvT? Did your account get hacked, or did someone feed you after midnight and you turned into trolls?"
,gunbravo,2013-02-05T16:48Z,"You can get the real thing from VTV
http://pirateproxy.net/torrent/8105923/The.Colbert.Report.2013.02.04.Justice.Sonia.Sotomayor.HDTV.x264-
Fuck u TVTeam and your bogus number of seeders"
,daillvibe,2013-02-05T16:52Z,"Never seen a ""VIP"" up that was bullshit before?

Review of skull status maybe required..."
[T],theburningbush,2013-02-05T18:03Z,"Yes, I got stuck at 99.7% like everyone else and went elsewhere. 

I can't delete my ""thanks, TvTeam"" comment, so I retract it here."
