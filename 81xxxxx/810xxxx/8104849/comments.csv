,Revoion,2013-02-06T13:13Z,Not a very good movie..
,missworld,2013-02-06T13:53Z,"A/9/V/8

I don't think anyone is bothered Revoion, if you think it's a good movie or not. 

Give your rating on A/V and head on over to IMDB and let them know you ""feelings"" there. "

,antiseed,2013-02-07T06:31Z,"Looks like your typical trashy low-budget action movie with almost no character development or plot twists. The kind of movie you would only watch late at night or after a long days work when you just want to lay back and watch some mindless killing.

Thanks! This is exactly what I was looking for :)"
