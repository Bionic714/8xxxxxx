Alphonse Mouzon's "Morning Sun" may be one of the first Smooth Jazz recordings - recorded in 1981 with pretty much the same band as on Mouzon's "By All Means" album may be one of the defining Smooth Jazz albums, just at the time when Smooth Jazz was born.

Songs like "Lullaby for Little Alphonse", "Morning Sun" and "When Linda Smiles" are Smooth Jazz classics in their own right.

But "Morning Sun" is not only a pure Smooth Jazz recording. It also has Disco and Funk tracks on it like "I'm glad you're here", which was released as a well doing single, and the funky "If Tomorrow Comes" with the great Herbie Hancock and Freddie Hubbard.

Alphonse's drumming is funky on all tracks and on "Just Because of you" Alphonse is going crazy with his leader at that time, Herbie Hancock ( on Fender Rhodes).

Check out the release on Tenaciousrecords with two great bonus tracks off the masterpiece "By All Means".

"Space Invaders" may be one of the greatest and freakiest drum solos of it's time.

Lay back and enjoy early Smooth Jazz with a whole lot of Disco and Funk and check out the featured artists on this recording alongside Alphonse on drums, keys and vocals you get:

Herbie Hancock, Lee Ritenour,Michael Brecker, Freddie Hubbard,Hubert Laws, Paul Jackson, Jr., Nathan East,Scott Edwards, Seawind Horns and The Waters Sisters!!!!
