That is obvious from a low number of (non-existent actually) seeders and a large number of leechers, Never waste your time with anything by an anonymous ""seeder"" since it either doesn't work or it is password-protected spam.

It is way past time that Pirate Bay stops allowing anonymous seeders to post their crap."
