,MEGodObeyOrDIEeee,2013-02-06T13:38Z,"Too bad that always these scenegroups seem to have an urge to screw with the save files and location of save files? I started to play the game with the 3dm crack, and of course as USUAL my save files will not work with reloaded crack. So I got two options, continue on with the 3dm crack, which seems to have some bugs, for an example the doors with the blue lock have a annoying buzzing sound coming from the all the time, that is not normal as it didnt happen on the 360? Or start over again, for the third time (first 3 chapters on 360, then now 2-3 chapters on 3dm crack, and now reloaded), but atleast with reloaded if there are dlc/patches, they usually crack those too to keep the game up to date? Although DS game very seldom have had any patches released post release? I could be wrong, but that is my view. So please guys (sceners/crackers), cant you just make youre cracks use the same save files....!!??"

Well, you must be new at this cause these guys have been doing crappy releases since for ever. All they do is release something with a crack that works with half ops and MAKE you d/l another from where they get ad money and so on. But i guess that you like worshiping losers cause u r one. Listen i've said it b4 and i'll say it one last time.

 Just because something seems to be free doesn't mean that it is and doesn't mean that it can be a crappy release because of it.

Reloaded is an older and much more Reliable group. Take my word for it (I've been around longer than you obviously).

Running in admin mode.

@turntable83: I'm running the game with dual GTX 690 4Gig cards (SLI), have the highest settings and SSAO enabled. Just because people ain't buying a game, doesn't mean that they don't have good hardware. So, have fun with your pathetic little xbox..

So you spent 2000USD in JUST video cards just to play video games. And only have marginally better graphics than the system it was ported from. And you have to continuously do software maintenance on it. 

I'm willing to bet within a year or two your overpriced cards will be replaced by a single card that is cheaper and faster. 

Guess what? I bought my Xbox years ago, and plays any game that comes out for it no problem. I can play this same game you are playing. Or should I say you are playing the same game I am, because you are playing a port off my console. I even have plenty exclusives you can never play. Sure, you have RTS I can't play, but who plays that boring ass genre? ENJOY! "

,thelouis961,2013-02-10T03:26Z,"This is my first comment here, but I had so much trouble figuring this out and want to help you guys if I can. For all those will issues involving Dead Space 3 crashing on startup to a black screen, here's what worked for me. 

1) Check to see if you have Jumi Controller or any ""Jumi"" software installed.

2) Uninstall Jumi, check to see if DS3 is working.

3) If its still not working try checking your drivers to see if Jumi.sys is still there, it'll look something like C:WindowsSystem32driversJumi.sys  Then rename it to whatever you like.

4) Restart your computer

Hope this helps!"
,TheSaintOfLA,2013-02-10T04:06Z,"@bforbov Encrypting your connection CAN lead to a decrease in speeds. While your ISP will not be able to detect (or atleast make it very difficult to do so) your torrenting speeds, the trade-off is that the only users you can send and receive data from are ones that ALSO have encryption turned on. Simply put, it's a no-win situation, you're either throttled by your ISP or throttled by the amount of users who have encryption turned on. My advice? Get a new ISP that doesn't give a shit what you do with your internet, as long as you pay for it."

,ChillyCrossFoot,2013-02-11T10:18Z,"Another Piece of Shyte Port...Love these game developers...And this is why you don't get my money. I tested this game with Precision X, AIDA, and GPU Z. CPU Usage is LOW but the GPU hovers around 60 percent range. The game runs at 30fps if you use VSYNC in the game. It is advisable to leave VSYNC on in the game. It is a PORT. 30 fps is not bad on a Big Screen. Infact I force all my games to run at 30fps. However, when you are at the BENCH, and doing Weapons Crafting/Buying/Selling items, In Chapter 10, the game Crashes. The GPU was running 73 Degrees Celcius, around 90% load. Only during Crafting and Menus the GPU usage goes Crazy. Why? BAD PROGRAMMING. That's as simple as that. In the game, it is fine, but as soon as you go to the Upgrade Bench, you are SCREWED. Video Card Crashes, Blank Screen of Death. Using latest Nvidia drivers on Win7 x64. Thank you Uploaders, now I don't have to buy this POS due to all the bugs. I own both Deadspace 1 and 2. They BOTH have these same issues. A big F U to EA Games and Visceral. BIG HUGE F U to Developers, Beta Testers, and Publishers. You can learn a thing or two from VALVE. This is why well over a decade later, I still enjoy VALVE based Half Life games. Keep porting shyte to PCs you Aholes, We will simply keep NOT paying. 
Spoiler *This game sucks compared to DS1 and 2 if you are mature enough, you will not like it.
Verdict: Don't buy. Wait for Stability Patches. If they will fix Menus and Bench GPU load issues, I might spend $40 on this POS."
,ChillyCrossFoot,2013-02-11T10:29Z,"BLACK SCREEN / BLANK SCREEN Issues. To everyone with these issues. The reason it's doing that is because this game tries to emulate the Processor it was made for on your video card. SO when you start up and get to the Menus, the actual Intel/AMD CPU is doing Nothing while the GPU is on Full Load. It does not matter if you have a 9800 or a 6 series card. Even SLI people are having these issues. You can use GPUZ and EVGA Precision X to see exactly what is going on. So when you are at a Menu, whether MAIN MENU or Crafting Bench, the Game starts running S.hit code going at 30fps, Over loading the GPU because its in Emulation mode. This drives your GPU Bat S1Hit crazy and the game Crashes. I feel sorry for anyone who goes out and spends Hundreds or maybe thousands of Dollars on PC Gaming. It will not matter how this game will perform. Its a PORT. They took code that's made for Xbox and PS3 and threw it in the Oven, and out came this baked P.iece of Shyte.
Good luck to you all until there is a patch. This game was over hyped. It's made for children with short attention spans."

To everyone who is intelligent, you would know that a Video Card does not do the SAME TYPE of Calculations that a CPU does. But this game Fails to employ the use of CPU *Math related Operations* and instead Bogs down the Video card with them. This confuses your PC with a ""Who's Doing What?"" and when you get Procedure call errors, your PC simply HANGS, You get a black Screen, Your Video Card Fan goes Ape S.hit out of control, because your PC has crashed, the Thermal Sensor in your GPU thinks the Temp can only be rising so it shuts off your PC and Blasts the Fan to Full. You just experienced a Crash due to Failed Mathematics students Programming your Game. 
So Again I ask. Why oh why is the game using MORE System resources when you are only in MENUS, but Calms down when you are actually Playing the game? Did Steve Ballmer and Donald Trump program this game? I call Schinanigans..this game is Last Press Milk The Cow Release. BTW, First Generation PS3 Owners are having the same issues."

Start the game in Windowed Mode. Have GPU-Z running, Windows Task Manager Running, and EVGA Precision X or MSI Afterburner, whichever you like. You can even use Nvidia Inspector. I use Precision X. Move the Slider to limit the Game FPS to 30. Click ""FRAME RATE TARGET"" Enable. Hit Apply. Drag the Application near to your Task bar so when you run the game Windowed, you can see it is working. 
Go into your Nvidia Control Panel. Select SINGLE DISPLAY PERFORMANCE MODE in Advanced 3D Settings. Don't touch anything else.
Select PhysX and choose CPU (This maybe is not necessary but I got past my crash this way).

Use Xbox Controller Manager to TURN OFF your Xbox Controller or Disconnect your Game Pad. Under Controls > Controller > XinputDevice should say OFF. (This is only temporary)

If your game is running windowed, Go to Graphic Quality, Select CUSTOM RENDER SETTINGS. 
In here, Turn Off SSAO (This is Useless because this game is a Port and it will drive your Video Card wild) SSAO is Ambient Occlusion and no game company has got it right besides Crytek.
Set Post Processing to OFF. This is the amount of frames that get Processed by your Video Card once Windows Direct X is done with it. Direct X is basically a translator between your Video Card and Windows Applications. You want It to pass to your GPU once the CPU has already done its thing.
ANTI ALIASING should be OFF. If you are playing in your NATIVE Screen Resolution, Anti Aliasing has no noticeable benefit.
ANISOTROPIC - You can also turn this off, since this game is a Port, its PRE Decided how it will look. Adding Perfume to Shyte isn't gonna make it smell much better.

Now you should be running the game without Confusing your CPU and GPU on Who is to do what. It should be running at 30 FPS. Make sure your VSYNC is ON and Don't mess with VSync in NVIDIA settings, leave it alone.

Turn on your Gamepad or Controller, Restart the Game, and Switch to Full Screen. Adjust Brightness, Enjoy.

Now you should be able to go through Crafting Bench and Menus etc without your system going BatS!h!it crazy. 

Again a big F U to EA. Thanks for trying to make DeadSpace into Call of Duty and Gears of War and FAILING Miserably at it. Ofcourse if you are 18 and your Mommy paid for it, you'll come in here and defend it. My instructions are to get the game running. This game isn't worth $60. $20 is more like it.
Enjoy everyone."

,ChillyCrossFoot,2013-02-11T23:30Z,"@blackcatcodon13 = Troll. You don't need high powered graphics cards for Ported games. A 9600GT will run circles around what these games are actually programmed to run on. They are not optimized. Period. I wrote instructions for people having problems. 
There is a Glitch in the game where it Freezes from time to time. It's whats called a Microstutter. Glitch in the game itself.

An Optimal gaming Environment in Windows 7 should have no more than 45 Processes running, 3/4 of your RAM should be Free, even though this game is only using around 400MB of RAM and goes upto 450MB of Video RAM. Make sure your Disks are defragmented as well. 

There is no solution for Microstutters as of yet. But my Solution above should get the game running for most of you with Semi-old PC hardware."
,ChillyCrossFoot,2013-02-11T23:36Z,"One more Important thing for people with newest Nvidia Drivers. Disable PowerMizer in the Registry. In your Registry, there's a Video folder with 0000, in there are lots of settings. Create new DWORD or QWORD (32 bit or 64bit depending on your OS) 
PowerMizerEnable = 0
PerfLevelSrc = 2222
Google it. 
This will make your video card to stay in normal mode rather than powering down which can cause nvidia cards to do very weird stuff. Nvidia drivers lately are very low quality stuff but offer enough incentive to upgrade. I suggest you Upgrade, but disable Power saving features in the Registry and also your Power Options in Windows (Video card only)
Good luck."

Disabling those along with msi afterburner stopped all the hanging/crashing. Sad part is when I look at the engine control center for my card the game max's out my activity and fan speed to 100%, temps sit about 70c with air cooled. I'm guessing with overclocking something about the game freaks out?

So pro-tip, try disabling your overclocking on your cpu/gfx and see if the game stays stable."

a leecher is someone who is downloading and uploading (you can only upload what you have downloaded). these are also called peers

a leacher is something that only takes and doesnt give. (people who limit upload). these are called ass holes.

a seeder only gives after he is done taking, these are called rare.

And what I do with my money is my problem, if you are a hard working person, don't you want to spend your cash on something? 

Or do you still sit there with your 486 in the basement of your parents house taking meth all day long and imagening that your f*cking xbox is better than a PC??

It's not. And neither are you. You are a pathetic little boy, with no respect for others. And you came here to do what? Download this game, or complain when your system couldn't run it?

Let's show how little you actually know about what an XBOX is: It has a CPU, GPU, memory, a BIOS, an harddrive (sometimes) an an optical drive. Hmm.. Isn't that what any computer these days have?

And so what if there comes a new graphics card after a year or two? I'll buy it.

i dont use it myself because i hate private servers so i cant say if it works with this game or not tho.

Installed on Win 8 x64 with no problems and played through the whole game with no problems.  Some people reported not being able to kill the spider thing with harpoons on chapter 13 and fixed it by lowering the resolution but I did not have any such problem.
Thank you HeroMaster!"
,Magicdito304,2013-02-27T22:38Z,"In cracked shooting games, including Far Cry 3 and Dead Space, I get some sort of image delay during cut scenes and mouse delay during gameplay.

I've got a pretty good gaming PC, the video card is a Radeon 5450 HD with atualizated drivers and the game is on low quality and yet I get those delays things. Can anyone help?"
,melanieisdemented,2013-02-28T12:01Z,"Yeah i'm having problems with the falling truck in chapter 9. Can't get through it. Have tried everything. My life is ruined. Any suggestions?
Thanks a million for the upload in any case, insanely great game, im off searching for the soundtrack now."

,aoxo,2013-03-01T16:57Z,"To people who spam about seeding and leechers...really just stfu.  Torrents DO have mechanisms to punish leechers and it's probably the reason most of you are crying about speed.  If you aren't uploading enough you get choked.  Also, the term leecher might not be the best way to describe a ""peer"".  You can DL from a peer or a seed, the only difference is one had all the data and the other only parts (useful parts).

To the guy that hates ports and EA but loves to spam comments.  I've called a waaambulance, help is on it's way...in the meantime..take this tissue.

Oh and also, game crashes as soon as I try to set my resolution to 1920x1080.  Latest nvidia driver 314.07.  2nd crashy release from reloaded I've tried this week.  Not that I'm blaming them for trying to give me free stuff."
,aoxo,2013-03-01T17:09Z,"P.S.  Co-op sounds alot like multiplayer to me.  Since when to cracked games work well with multiplayer?  Game goes online and the gig is up, they can tell you aren't running a legit copy."

,Magestrix,2013-03-02T01:28Z,"@aoxo Hey, I just finished the game. I'm using 310.90. Try an older driver, or just revert all settings in control panel for nVidia to default.
And yeah, most people don't get it - if you have a 1:1 ratio the downloads are rather fast.

When you are trying to climb the truck, HOLD ""W"" and TAP ""E"". I had same issue at first.
I was hoping for a better ending, but damn this was a fun game! Going to play Game+ now or whatever it was called.."

,Seedicle,2013-03-10T00:52Z,Im having a problem in chapter 13 when you fight that big monster for a 3 time. When I get it with the harpoons and then go over to the machine and it tells me to keep mashing F but im sitting here mashing it hella fast and somehow he just gets out of the harpoon... Is this suppose to happen or something. Not sure if it is the torrent or what because when I played crysis 3 the end boss was unbeatable until a crack fix came out.. Help please :)
,Seedicle,2013-03-10T01:18Z,Ok I figured out how to beat the boss on chapter 13 if you are haveing the bug problem and cant kill him with the harpoons. Alot of other people are having the problem and they tried this and it workedd for them. Go to your game settings and turn everything off and put your resolution all the way down also. This worked for me on the second try I had to restart at the check point after changing that stuff and then it was all good. 
,kundak88,2013-03-13T01:15Z,"Works fine, thank you buddy for the game, just Awakened to post ,if you can......"

,jigar7,2013-04-04T07:51Z,"Hello everyone, Could anyone tell me if it is possible to crack a retail Limited Edition DS3 Copy?
I have installed the game via the Origin activation on my account.
I recently gave the game to my friend so that he doesnt have to download the 12GB repack. He tried to install it, but it keeps asking him for Origin Activation before installation (which obviously isnt possible as the game is linked to my account). And I can't even crack the game without installing it. Any workarounds? Or will I have to get the reloaded/Kaos torrent?"
,Duh9911,2013-04-04T18:05Z,I installed it and then it tells me I have to install Origin... I install Origin and then to play it I need an Activation key WICH I DON'T KNOW!!!
