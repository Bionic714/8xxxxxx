Dead Space 3 brings Isaac Clarke and merciless solider, John Carver, on a
journey across space to discover the source of the Necromorph outbreak.
Crash-landed on the frozen planet of Tau Volantis, the pair must comb the
harsh environment for raw materials and scavenged parts. Isaac will then
put his engineering skills to the ultimate test to create and customize
weapons and survival tools. The ice planet holds the key to ending the
Necromorph plague forever, but first the team must overcome avalanches,
treacherous ice-climbs and the violent wilderness. Facing deadlier evolved
enemies and the brutal elements, the unlikely pair must work together to
save mankind from the impending apocalypse.
