Even the sky isn't the limit when Lt. Jackie "Eagle" McKenzie and Lt. Doug "Zapper" Curtis square off at the prestigious first team fighter school. Their aerial stunts heat up the heavens, but on the ground, everything Zapper does rubs Jackie the wrong way... like when he gets caught watching her rub herself the right way, or devouring a piece of "Candy". After a plenty of nose dives, Jackie finally realize what a Hot Gun Zapper really is, and in for a touch down that'll leave skid marks on your landing strip!
