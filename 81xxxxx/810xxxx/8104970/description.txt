For XVID AVI with MP3 audio, I'd give NetFlix a solid:
V=8
A=8
.
Something of a little social experiment.
If you connect to one file at a time, you get one at a time.
If you connect to the last six all at once, you'll get them all at once.
But six times later than you would have gotten the first.
Unles, of course, you are the only responsible one, which means you get one
As everyone else gets six. Then, of course, the next five should come pretty quick
Me, I already got my copy and plan to start watching.
Is it any good?
Oh, the smaller file size is due to frame rate - 25/30 the size (1/6 smaller).
