The real stories come from the back seat. Set against the backdrop of the Los Angeles night, "Drive" tells the story of a car ride that changed Savanna Samson's life. She got into the car to escape an unhappy relationship, and while riding through the city she strikes up a conversation with her driver who gives her an unusual look at life. 
Savanna is so moved by that night that she becomes a driver herself. And we meet another side of Savanna. Life looks a lot different from the front seat. When you get in and she asks "where to?" Be prepared to get the ride of a lifetime.
