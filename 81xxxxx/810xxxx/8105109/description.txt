Ep 12: Kim Nose Best

Monday February 4, 9:00 pm

In Las Vegas, Brandi entices all the women (except Adrienne, who stayed back in LA) to try pole dancing, with varied success. Upon learning Kim is about to go under the knife for her nose job, the women wonder if going under anesthesia and taking pain killers is wise for a woman just out of rehab. The final dinner in Vegas starts pleasantly, but the moment Adrienne's name is mentioned, it devolves into a feud in which new issues are raised, and old wounds are opened.
