,borrowedwifi,2013-02-11T17:28Z,"Just tried it, Win7-64 test box.

Program came up fine, acted like it was working, even gave a ""success"" notification after the conversion and an option to open the folder in which the converted file was saved. But no file. Not even a placeholder. Tried several ""installs."" Tried multiple output folders in addition to the default folder. Nope. NFG"
,Sailor420,2013-02-13T02:56Z,"same as borrowedwifi, running Win 7 Ultimate x64 SP1

I've been on puters since the early 80's (DOS, VAX, UNIX, etc) ... not a n00b .... 

THX for the try .... I will try your 8.3 up and see if it has better results."

,chayan,2013-02-27T00:42Z,Will this work on windows 8?
,Halloweenpsycho,2013-02-28T13:02Z,"i am unsure.. did not test with 8, i will test later this evening and let ya know :)"
,danwat1234,2013-04-25T19:14Z,"Works fine on windows 8 64-bit. But, you can't change the priority of the conversion within the software, I have to use task manger to change CPU priority. No biggie

Thanks"
