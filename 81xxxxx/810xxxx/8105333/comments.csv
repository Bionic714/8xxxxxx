[T],pharmakate,2013-02-05T13:05Z,The torrent evidently consists of writings advocating Eastern Orthodoxy -- I'm guessing proselytism is the uploader's intention. 
,aekarajonny,2013-02-05T20:26Z,"proselytism ? by how do you support this? because people hasn't any idea for what the Ancient Church is?there,in the west that you live,you propably have lost the meanings of the Holy Scriptures. 
you dare to compare the Ancient Christianity,with cults that raised like mushrooms 1850 years after the Crucifixion! 
PEOPLE BECAME ''CATHOLIC'' BECAUSE THEY NEVER HAVE MET ORTHODOXY...  SCHISMA IS A  (GREEK WORD).AT 809 FIRST,FRANKS PUT FILIOQUE,AND CHANCE THE SYMBOL OF FAITH.THEN,1054 BECAME TOTALLY SCHISMA,AND THE WESTERN TOOK ANOTHER WAY FROM THE ANCIENT CHURCH. ''CATHOLIC'' IS THE ORTHODOX CHURCH,-THE ONE,HOLY,CATHOLIC AND APOSTOLIC CHURCH. THE PAPISTS USE THIS GREEK WORD FALSE.  THEN,BECAME PROTESTANTISM,AND 22000 HERESIES-ALL FROM THE WEST . WHAT A PITTY!

Christrian﻿ Orthodoxy is the true faith that is why we survived for over 2000 years from so many enemies; turks, the venetians, the huns. Our faith is powerful through the works. One of our saints Kosmas aitolos prophesied over 250 years ago how the world would be today. And he wrote it in a book. To name a few of his prophesies; television, internet, wars in the balkans. Look him up. Who knows you might learn a thing or two.

GOD HIMSELF SHOWED US,THROUGH HIS MIRACLES,AS WE SAW IN THE CASE OF THE HUMBLE ELDER,THAT THROUGH  HUMILITY,PEOPLE CAN ACHIEVE THEOSIS.
GOD SHOWED US THE TRUTH EVEN,THROUGH HIS MIRACLES,ABOUT THE REAL FAITH,AS WE CAN SEE THE HOLY LIGHT,THAT IS GIVEN ONLY TO ORTHODOX,FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS.

ALSO,EVERY YEAR,AT THE FEAST OF THE HOLY THEOFANY,THE WATER IN THE JORDAN RIVER TURNING TOWARDS! 
WE ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SALVATION OF OUR SOUL."

,shamanist,2013-02-05T20:44Z,"@aekarajonny... you have a right to present your view. But keep in mind that Jesus was a good observant Jew who probably didn't plan on starting a new sect or cult himself. Indeed, I have amazed how little Christians of all flavors know about Jesus even with the info right in front of them. The biggest problem with Jesus is that another Jew, Saul (Paul) came along and told us what we should think about him... And when you add things like the Book of Revelation, which BARELY made it into the canon, this mess just gets messier..."

,aekarajonny,2013-02-07T09:32Z,"What other historical evidence and even pagans exist outside of the Bible that talk about Jesus of Nazareth?
Several stories have we heard about the supposedly non-existent personality of Jesus Christ. Many historical figures have far fewer resources (eg Alexander, Socrates, etc.) and yet is outside challenge!


WHAT ARE THE SOURCES TO OUR indicate the existence OF CHRIST AS HISTORICAL PERSON OTHER THAN THE BIBLE? (Summary)
- Cornelius Tacitus Roman historian who lived during the latter part of the first century AD
- Suetonius, Tacitus modern history, great Roman historian.
- Pliny the two are modern precedents.
- Josephus the Jew.
- Talmud, the sacred book of the Jews.
- Archaeological finds.
- Finding of the True Cross.
- The Syrian history.


LET'S SEE DETAILS So what say THESE SOURCES
Number of views exist, and many books have been released about the person of Jesus from the 19th century until today. The number of books have been written about Christ estimated to be over 2000. But doubts about the historical existence of Jesus came from intellectuals after the 17 century. AD! Random? If Jesus did not really exist as a historical personality, then what happened and remembered some after 17 centuries? Certainly some deliberately questioned the existence of the historical Jesus to deceive the ignorant.


1) First source: Cornelius Tacitus.
Historian who lived during the latter part of the first century AD The historian, he wrote: ""Christy (as in Latin"" Christ "", from which came the name Christian), suffered the death penalty during the reign of Tiberius by one of our committees, Pontius Pilate."" -The Complete Works of Tacitus (New York, 1942), «The Annales», Book 15, § 44. Additionally mentions specific punishments Nero submitted their ""Christian"" who adds as were numerous. From the testimony of Tacitus one can distinguish the following basic elements:


a) given a specific time and place of action ""for Tiberius king and governor of Judea Pontius Pilate."" b) certify the existence of Jesus Christ and speaks of his death as a ""villain"" by Pilate. c) He talks about Jesus with simplicity without showing that denies His existence. Tacitus is totally opposed to Christianity. Does not deny that he was the Christ, nor that Christianity spread despite persecution. If the incumbent had the slightest doubt about the existence of the will he wrote in his work? Certainly will somehow noted that of the doubt ... So no doubt at all about the existence of Jesus.

"
,aekarajonny,2013-02-07T09:33Z,"2) Second source: Suetonius, a contemporary of Tacitus, great Roman historian.
In his work captures the life of the Emperor Claudius, talks about the expulsion of Jews from Rome in 53 AD on the grounds that ""the instigation of Christ causing trouble."" The testimony of Souetoniou the decree of Claudius crosses the ""Acts of the Apostles"" which states that the Apostle Paul comes to Corinth met Aquila and Priscilla Jews who lived in Rome and had been expelled from there ""through the diatetachenai Claudius chorizesthai all who Jews of Rome ""(Acts m, 2). Ie ""Claudius had ordered to remove the Jews from Rome."" The Christians were already known in Rome of Nero and the new faith (in Suetonius superstition). He also referred to the specific punishments submitted Nero the Christians of the time. So if it were not for Christ as a person, then who was it that Christ ""inciting trouble""?
3) Third source: Pliny is both modern precedents.
His words are of great value and testimony dating back to 111 AD, ie very close to the time when Jesus lived. The emperor Trajan sent Pliny in Bithynia in Asia Minor as legatus Caesaris. So he wrote a letter to Trajan: ""The miasma of superstition Christians extends not only in cities but also in fields and villages."" Additional states (Letter X, 96): ""The Christians are accustomed to a regular meeting day before sunrise, and hymns refer to Christ, as if talking to God."" The regular day it was and Sunday. Then personally interrogated many Christians and gathered a lot of information about life and faith. He wanted to protect his pagan religion and therefore contacted the Emperor to prevent spread of the new religion. Pliny has suspicions that this is a myth? There seems to even the suspicion that Christ is a mythical person. If he had the slightest suspicion certainly would argue that Christians believe in a myth. Pliny speaks of'' Christ'' and not a'' Christ''. Annoyed because he praised as'' God''."

4) 4th source: Josephus, the Jew.
Born in 37 AD Jerusalem. Pharisee himself was closely connected with the families of Annas and Caiaphas high priests (this shows that in no case was ready to move favorably for Christ). In his work'' Jewish archeology'' he wrote in Greek, reads: ""The high priest Ananias seat conference judges and produce in him the brother of Jesus Christ legomenon (James his name) and Tina partners as paranomisanton accusation handed poiisamenos lefthisomenous (so stoned). "" At another point in Jewish archeology and specifically in the XVIII 3.3 writes:


""Gignetai not abstain during the time of Jesus, wise man, if this man speak ce financing. RV gar paradoxes projects poet, teacher of human pleasure-receiving talithi. And many do not and Greek epigageto, Christ was, and he shall be the first indication that men, even within us, crosses epitetimikotos Pilate, quite a epafsanto are the first agapisantes him, for he appeared to them! Day again having a third aspect of the divine prophets alive nevertheless tech and other jumped on this wonderful eirikoton. ""


According to the above passage, Josephus testifies that at the time of the reign of Pilate showed Jesus was wise man if he can say the man! And why say something like that? Because ""man"" is, as he says historian oddly works, taught people the truth and attracted many Jews and Gentiles. Even informs us about how killing of Jesus on the cross. Finally, we are witness to the resurrection of the Lord 3 days after the burial. This is the most important historical testimony, which must not be forgotten that he was a Jew and therefore had no reason to support the historicity of Jesus on the contrary. Really, why not one Pharisee completely ignored Jesus? Did Christianity had spread to the extent that it was now impossible for anyone to keep quiet historic events?"
,aekarajonny,2013-02-07T09:35Z,"5) 4 source: Talmud, the sacred book of the Jews.
The Talmud consists of the books of the Mishnah and the Gemara. The Mishnah (the oral law) is the tradition of the elders. The Gemara is the Rabbis comment on that contained in the Mishnah. The sacred books of the Jews speak with certainty about the existence of Jesus Christ. Not naturally admit his divinity, but admit no doubt of its existence. Naturally, they try to discredit him. So'' written in the evening of Passover they hanged Jesus of Nazareth.'' They insist that Jesus indeed was the fruit prostitution did not treatments based on magic. According to Jewish Professor J. Klausner, in his book'' Jesus of Nazareth'': ""Jesus of Nazareth was a traitor of Israel, who had magic, scorned the grounds of wisdom, led the people into error and said that he did not come to break the Mosaic law but to complete it. Hanged on the eve of Easter as a heretic and deceiver of the people. The students did the same works in his name. ""


OTHER EVIDENCE ON THE EXISTENCE OF CHRIST.
- There is archaeological evidence for His existence? Although the public activity of Jesus lasted only 3 years and as is natural in such a short time is difficult to establish archaeological material, yet there is little evidence of the historicity of. In 1945 E.L. Sukenik (Hebrew University professor) discovered in an excavation that was later named as the ""oldest document of Christianity."" So discovered near Jerusalem two tombs which contained an engraved inscription. The first inscription contained a prayer to Jesus for help, and the second was an entreaty addressed again and called Jesus the resurrection from the dead. The last inscription is perhaps the B presence. How close to the time when Jesus lived? According to scientists, these inscriptions have been carved around 50 AD That is ancient, just 15 years after the death of Jesus and reveal one of the effects brought by Christ, and on the other that could not be led astray even people who lived so near historically. Additionally scrolls of sturgeon (this collection of Greek papyri which were written by 140 AD) proves the historicity of Jesus. More specifically, some of them say words of Jesus remind us too much of John's Gospel.
- Finally, the discovery of the True Cross is indisputable proof of the existence of our Lord. It is known that in order to stop the big wave of the Christians Hadrian built on the Calvary Temple of Venus. However St Helen 326m.Ch. demolished the temple and began to work on finding the True Cross. Finally found the three crosses and to understand what was the cross Jesus bore all three in a dying sick wife. Once the dying touched the Cross stood upright perfectly healthy. Since then, he was named Holy Cross is a relic of humanity and item not only proves the existence of Jesus and His divinity.
- Even in Syrian history, Sarapis wrote (after AD 73) that ""the Jews from the country katastrafentes those persecuted zosin in the diaspora, the wise king has not died thanks to the new laws gave. Because of the conviction of the wise king was removed from the Jews the kingdom. "" The only ""wise king"" that katedikasti prior to 73 AD, was Jesus Christ."

,aekarajonny,2013-02-07T09:38Z,"CONCLUSION
From all the above it is obvious that in none of the cases can not stand the idea seriously that, supposedly, Jesus of Nazareth was not as a historical person. Instead, they are staged attacks against Christ designed to confuse and mislead those who can most, focus to challenge the arguments with nonexistent person of Christ Jesus. Now let's say the last argument as an option. How can a non-existent person, according to them, to divide the history of the world in the middle? Having now after his presence on earth history was split into before and after Christ? Foolish not to accept the division of history and not to accept that was the person who broke up?"
,aekarajonny,2013-02-09T17:17Z,"Σmarts of the  atheists stops at cemetery...
THIS is only an opinion of a created being... Soon (we all) will learn if does Jesus exists or not..."
,aekarajonny,2013-03-06T18:59Z,"Several times we read on the internet or in books and articles ""educated"" scientists that Jesus Christ actually existed, but was created Judaic religious groups or compositions derived from national myths and various other unhistorical speculation. At one level professors serious expert on early Christian year can not ignore the most important unique historical personality of Jesus of Nazareth, which separated the calendars of the world in the years before and after Christ. Neither teaching nor the miracles of Jesus, or the resurrection has something similar to the general religious Jewish history or philosophy of the national world, to claim someone that supposedly came from a similar composition.

And of course we can not talk about myths in the age of the emperors Augustus and Tiberius! The times of the New Testament (NT) is enlightened and philosophical, not mythical. After all, Jews and Christians were not gullible and naive, but people toil and smart breadwinner. The compositions myths on palaiodiathikika or national guidance patterns did not belong to Christian mentality. Proof is that the Church rejected the so-called ""apocryphal gospels"" which was a few dozen, why alter the original image of Christ and introduced myths about the life and teaching. And lasted only four Gospels, which periesozan the original image and mission of the Messiah on earth. When also be made to prevent the supposed legend in emerging church, after the Gospel of Mark was written about 35 years after the fact of the resurrection of Jesus, the letters of Paul after only 20 years (which quite clearly stated in the resurrection of the Lord) and conversion to Christianity took place 2-5 years after the death of Christ? Perhaps even the apostles and disciples of Jesus did not offer everything for the name and with the same martyred their lives for him and his teachings ? really offer their blood for Christ, according to what they saw and experienced themselves, not because they heard and learned about Him from the second and third lips: ""I saw up close and hands to touch. When life appeared we saw with our own eyes. So we submit our testimony and we talk about eternal life (the God-man Jesus) who was with the Father, but was revealed to us. What we have seen and heard we announce the ..... and what your writing to be complete your joy ""(I Jn 1.1 to 4). That knew firsthand what it was like children in a family knows better than anyone what their father and do not need to ask their neighbors and even strangers fellow worse for him. The Jews and the early Christians were not so naive and mythomaneis guys, but smart and realistic fishermen, merchants, (tricky in the beginning and remorseful later) fees etc., who felt the need to find (and found) for themselves the facts about the resurrection, to get caught with their hands the marks of the nails in the body of the risen Jesus (St. Thomas), ran after the empty tomb, they (Peter and John initially), non-believers headphones and only notices the resurrection of myrrhbearers.

Simple and everyday anglers as were the apostles, or down to earth everyday publicans as before Matthew had no conditions or unbridled imagination, as mentioned above, to build personality such greatness as Christ, whom also believe God on earth thought was blasphemous for a Jew to make and adopt it in his life. Have not had a job to do and the apostles were looking for high philosophical and mythological searches, searched for solar deities, and saw visions and allegorical visions? Instead, as shown by the remarkable teaching and behavior were not dreamers or neurological tweaked, but well versed in practical problems whose daily needs and Christ was a physician and healer. Could such a myth, completely different from the environment of the scribes and Pharisees to succeed in their territories; And rouse people who knew firsthand what happened to give their lives for a lie, not to fear torture, imprisonment, exile and death, as the first Christians? course not!

All this, and how religious rationalists were the Jews, it seems "
,aekarajonny,2013-03-06T19:00Z,"Jesus also appears in the Gospels as amazing personality, attitude religious anarchy would say towards the establishment of his time, the unintegrated katadynasteftikous types of political and religious power, and speaks with authority and fulfill his face in the Law of Moses and the prophecies. Such a person does not create out of nothing, but it is generally accepted that certainly existed. It seems to be staving unique power to exceed on the benevolence of the barriers Saturday, consider their fellow brothers and sisters, not just by nature relative, to be seen by everyone in awe and admiration of dividing the mission Jews, to treat a woman who touches him, be in conflict with the Pharisees and the teachers. Sometimes, not bound to do wonders for the show, accusing him his student (Peter) that is 'Satan' (after not thinking according to the will of God), ask the students to bear His cross themselves and not be ashamed of Him. Be belted apron and wash the feet of the apostles, to consider the children first the kingdom of heaven be inflicted with parables against false teaching and symferontologikis the chief priests and elders, believing himself Lord and Messiah, and finally willing to discuss and syntroei with prostitutes and sinners. Unique personality Jesus, who alone as a man if you see outdoes its time. So I can not be fake face.

The apostles could have invented such miraculous tales once were aimed at Jews who were knowledgeable of all, Jerusalem diadramatizomenon, facts about Jesus? They would not have their compatriots and religious authorities stopped very start preaching their presenting evidence of truly accrued; Can orthoses stature in the audience who believes in silly? Saying apostles artificial narratives would spread the message of Christianity throughout the world and in all periods? were so foolish To the listeners, and through the same eyes watched their fellow miraculous signs, in order to be convinced without using any critical ability? have nothing easterlies myths, full of monsters, gods and passionate wars between the gods, one God and loving New Testament, dying to redeem man? Symbolic Greek myths and legends can be compared with the unparalleled, practical limits to the right reason and emotion, and yet so simple described (no flare and apologies heroes) message of truth, love and life of Jesus? Clearly and unequivocally no! The expert and scholar of philology, professor of medieval and Renaissance literature at the University of Cambridge, CS LEWIS, and author of ""Chronicles of Narnia"", states: ""All my life I read poetry, novels, legends and myths. I know how it is. I know that none of them is like the Gospel of John ""("" I Proof 'ed' The Word ', 2005, pp. 39-41).

If there was a historical figure of Jesus, could not capture the magnificent teachings of Christianity, small groups of ordinary people, with loans and compositions national heroes or beliefs Religion. And how stupid would have been the first Christian community to accept any fantastic concoction as true? Moropisteftoi Or how should believers were the first to worship someone who died betraying their trust? How could extend a religion who hated national, Jews and Romans and yet managed to win the whole world, if he had the authority and was not based on a strong personality like Jesus and his immediate disciples? How Christianity prevailed through so much pain, suffering, tears and murder ? was so petty Paul, who abandoned his career and suffered so many thanks for a ghost, who had never seen nor heard? would leave their belongings pupils Him, dragged it to court, it will overwhelm so much, will whipped and killed a legend and a guess? Will seemed so zealous in spreading the Gospel, and to forward such courage so small threats? But an objective look if you throw someone in the gospel narratives will find that not only are unaffected, natural, contain no emotional surges, not iroopoioun Christ, not to praise him and oraiologies verbosity and do not want to excite, yet not blame nor Judas, nor the cross of Christ.
