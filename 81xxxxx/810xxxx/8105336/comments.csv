,Avoakrabian,2013-02-05T19:57Z,"Brownsugar13, i know your torrents are well known for their 5.1 surround sound with a small size, but can i suggest you to make your Future uploads with a higher bitrate of audio ?! its ok if the size gets bigger a little like 1-2GB"
[T],Brownsugar13,2013-02-05T21:29Z,"Higher than 384??

i made it before with 448 and some one told me thats to high so i don´t know which i must choose again ? ?

note the info HASH CODE  should be,
83FF5DD3BC3371230A676A2BE1B17CFCFB1764FD,i made this torrent 2days ago"
,Avoakrabian,2013-02-06T03:56Z,"I am simply aiming in much higher quality in Audio.
Cause, correct me if im wrong, higher bitrate does mean higher 5.1 surround quality right ?
Also because some Audio (and only audio) quality of your uploads are not that good, they have like those parasite sounds in them,which refers to a low audio quality. The worst one i remember is The Dark knight Rises."
,pro346pro,2013-02-06T05:21Z,Aac is a more effecient codec 320k 5.1 aac sounds great but brown sugar rips have excellent sound quality! What are you complaint about people!
,Mr_Heisenberg,2013-02-06T06:09Z,"I don't know why someone would complain about higher audio like 448 kbs but i feel like your torrents are perfect as is. If you want to do 448 audio feel free, im downloading from you regardless. Thanks for your work!

A/V 10 "
,doritoman,2013-02-06T07:42Z,"current audio is of no concern to me, i recode the audio to 2 channels. it sounds just fine to me. but the VIDEO bitrate should definitely be higher. this torrent had excellent video bit rate. 2000+ video bitrate is a MUST for 1080p rips :)"
,pro346pro,2013-02-06T11:24Z,Just keep doing what you do now don't change anything!
,NothingButKush,2013-02-06T20:12Z,"Seed please, there are 0 seeders right now and the torrent is a few days old. Brown sugar peers never seed for some reason, thanks for your work BS, your torrents are the best."
,MsPeachy,2013-02-07T12:10Z,Thank you! Keep 'em comin'.
,MsPeachy,2013-02-07T17:11Z,Please seed
,bungunners,2013-03-06T23:18Z,"@Avoakrabian ..Who the fuck do you think you are?  You think you're the only one getting these movies ""its ok if the size gets bigger a little like 1-2GB ""   I don't think it would be ok if the files were 1-2GB bigger, and I am happy just the way they are.  I certainly don't make requests to people who already spend massive amounts of time doing what they do.  Just be grateful for what is given to you, and if you want a bigger file, get the raw blue ray rips or something.   Brownsugar,  I do appreciate exactly what you are already doing.  Thank you."
