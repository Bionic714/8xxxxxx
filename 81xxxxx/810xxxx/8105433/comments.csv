,dylan_bigdaddy,2013-02-06T11:04Z,^ did you follow the cracking instructions?
,DuarteM,2013-02-06T18:21Z,"It isn't working for me and yes, I did follow the instructions"
,alphah,2013-02-06T21:04Z,the free app i downloaded was wallpapers but it still didnt work :(
,AndWhy,2013-02-06T23:23Z,"Yeah followed the instructions, although it should be noted that the app provided doesn't have a ""CodeResources"" to replace. But it's just an alias anyway, was hoping that wouldn't matter. And that may not be at all, 'cause regardless, this doesn't work."
,dylan_bigdaddy,2013-02-07T07:07Z,right. sorry guys im new to this. i have removed this torrent and i'll learn how to crack them properly for you. sorry for taking you all around the bend
,AndWhy,2013-02-08T04:51Z,"No worries, I really appreciate the effort and I've been waiting for an update to this app for a long time. Keep us posted!"
,dylan_bigdaddy,2013-02-09T14:45Z,I will. in the mean time this is an outdated version but if you don't need it to sync across devices it should work. http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8088250/iStudiez_Pro_1_0_9_Mac_Os_X-[CRACKED]
,AndWhy,2013-02-10T02:52Z,"Yeah I saw that one, unfortunately the biggest thing I'm looking for is the feature to sync across multiple devices. Let's hope someone figures it out soon!"
