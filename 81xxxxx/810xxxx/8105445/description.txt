Detective Murdoch finds that the man behind a flying machine that crashes in Toronto is none other than his old nemesis, James Pendrick. He learns that Pendrick is hoping to win a $1 million prize for the first controlled flight. A body is found in the rubble of the crash but someone is clearly out to steal his invention. Murdoch also has to deal with Ottawa-based spymaster Terence Meyers who says it's all a national security matter. Meanwhile, Julia returns from Vienna intent on practicing psychiatry. She's also hoping to have her marriage to D'Arcy annulled.
