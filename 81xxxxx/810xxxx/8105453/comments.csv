,enyamert,2013-02-06T03:20Z,Hell yeah! Thanks for getting these back up on the road. I've been checking everyday since xmas for these new mixes. As I'm in Oz it's sometimes difficult to listen first thing Saturday morning... so PLEASE keep them coming regularly. Do you also have the 21-12-2012  and 28-12-2012 mixes? Thanks heaps!!

I'm after Essential Selection 'Full Year' packs pre 2007, there are quite a few torrent here on TBP but sadly many are dead with no 'seeders', hence I'm reaching out to those of you that can reseed or upload again, again the years I'm missing are everything before and including 2006, even though the show start in 1991, the earliest year I've seen posted as a torrent was 1994, a big THANK YOU in advance ... keep dancing!!!!!"
