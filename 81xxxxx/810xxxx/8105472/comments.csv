,led_zeppelin_2009,2013-02-06T01:30Z,"Thanks @ EXTREMEZONE for your superb services over the years. KUDOS.
However I found the control in DS3 not flexible similar to Part 1&2. The graphics has been slightly improved with more quicker & smarter species. Although the game is fascinates & mesmerizes every one but something tells me it is perhaps time that EA is loosing the touch of retaining the original gameplay, perhaps they tried to implement or offer a little something different to its customers and as a result I strongly doubt is the next part will be as prominent and popular as the 1&2.
I have enjoyed DMC a lot, stunning game, supreme graphics, outstanding story & most importantly runs smooth in a mediocre graphics card. Have a nice day every one. Keep up the good work and God bless you Mister Extremezone."

,MarQu1s,2013-02-06T20:03Z,"Anyone complaining about slow speeds needs to start using DDL instead of torrents, especially for newly released games such as this one because:

1) there's always too many leechers hence the awful speeds

and 2) tons of DDL links have just been posted which means there's guaranteed to be working links out there that are easy to find

So if you're sick and tired of downloading at less than 100 kB/s and want to max out your connection like I do at 3.5 MB/s, all you need are these three things:

-rpnet (may look too good to be true, but I can assure you it isn't)

-IDM

-filestube

BTW, I am in no way affiliated with any of the above, I just want to help those who are unaware that there are way better alternatives out there.

...thank me later, and thank you ez for being one of the best contributors on here."

1) Check to see if you have Jumi Controller or any ""Jumi"" software installed.

2) Uninstall Jumi, check to see if DS3 is working.

3) If its still not working try checking your drivers to see if Jumi.sys is still there, it'll look something like C:WindowsSystem32driversJumi.sys  Then rename it to whatever you like.

4) Restart your computer

Hope this helps!"

Thanks Extremezone, great game, great gameplay, great uploader.
El Idioma del juego (hablado) esta en español (España) lo cual para muchos no es viable, los Subtitulos estan en español, lo que no se, es si el juego se puede colokar con audio en ingles y los subtitulos en español. Si alguien sabe por favor avisar. Gracias."

 Its not the torrent, its your operating system/configs or your virus protection/firewall or your not following instructions correctly.  If you have problems with the torrent go to youtube and type "" how to download and crack game torrents"". You will find several how to videos with step by step instructions. If your still having problems slow down and follow the directions closely.
 If your still having some kind of error messages or problems start reading at the second paragraph of this comment. I hope this helps anyone with problems. Peace to all!! and please support the software companies that provide these games. Thanks again EZ"
