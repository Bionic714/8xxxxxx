,Machine4578,2013-02-05T15:33Z,ALI213_V2 saves work fine with the RELOADED cack
,DMZino,2013-02-05T16:06Z,Game is crashing at startup.. any ideas?
,MLO89,2013-02-05T23:55Z,Works perfectly
,MEGodObeyOrDIEeee,2013-02-06T13:44Z,"Yeah 3dm save files wont work with reloaded release, as usual!!! Fucking retarted that they cant crack these games where the save files work from release to release? How fuckng hard can it be to use the same save system, and why do they always need to fucking change where the save files go? Is it somekind of EGO, that they have to decide where the save files go, they just cant leave the save files in the original place the retail version saves??? I mean skidrow have their saves in appdata local skidrow, relaoded have begun with the same, but in programdata RLD! folder? I mean cmon, just leave it as is, and make them work together in the future. This is tiresome!!"

,shakanx,2013-02-08T14:36Z,is it just me that get the problem that when i start the game its just black screen ?
,lurch840,2013-02-08T15:35Z,"Okay I'm a newbie when it comes to torrents.  My save files won't actually help.  Any suggestions on what I should do?  I installed using seyter's cracked repack, tried also with skidrows and reloaded.  I can't get saves to work on any."
,xcrimsonprophecyx,2013-02-10T03:46Z,"I think this is the crack I got that had the game working (saves and all) until I reached chapter 9's boss section and the aim (mouse 2) got stuck in the actuated postion. If this is the crack I got then it only works for about half the game. If you're aiming down your sights you can't do anything but shoot, really...because that's what it's for.

Unfortunately I don't know which one I got because I delted the files to save space after installation.

If you're getting a black screen then your crack is bad...or not installed properly. Perhaps your hardware is just rejecting the execution."
,IsThatD,2013-02-10T09:05Z,HOW DO I INSTALL!?
,Azemboz,2013-02-16T11:15Z,"MEGodObeyOrDIEeee I think you're fucking retarded for even talking shit about the people who crack your free games for you, since you're too stupid to do it yourself"
,Cuddles13,2013-03-20T22:55Z,"Works like a charm for bugged 13 lvl and that ant boss - but DO NOT FORGET to put out saving files somewhere while you will give deadspace3 crack to your DS 3 folder - then put those save files back - if you wont do it, your saved files will appear as damaged!!"
