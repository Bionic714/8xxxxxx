DVDFab is all you need to backup DVDs. DVDFab Platinum 3 is brand new, is completely rewritten, is based on 5 years of DVD 

copy software development. DVDFab is simply the easiest way to copy a DVD movie. Just insert the movie and a blank DVD then 

press Start. Your entire movie - including menus, trailers and special features - is copied to a single DVD with just one 

click, and everything happens automatically. Backup your entire DVD - including menus, trailers, and special features - 

onto one or multiple discs.

System Requirements:

 - 10 GB of Free Hard Disk Space

Why Qt?
 1. We can have some advanced UI effects like skins and animations in future versions.
 2. We have moved an important step to the Mac version.
