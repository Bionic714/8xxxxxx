For XVID AVI with MP3 audio, I'd give NetFlix a solid:
V=8
A=8
.
So, what do you do when your computer chrashes and 7 times it starts
and won't present a task bar?
Yep, I tried it an 8th time and it worked. Who said doing the same thing
and explecting a different result was a definition of crazy?
