╨ö╨╛╨┐. ╨╕╨╜╤ä╨╛╤Ç╨╝╨░╤å╨╕╤Å: A symphonic progressive band out of Brazil. The group plays piano, synthesizer for lyrical developments, violin, classical guitar & viola, bass & drums. Additional musicians add oboe, flute. The music is symphonic prog centered around Elisa Wiermann on keyboards and Claudio Dantas on drums. Highly recommended to fans of the Italian classical prog style.
Some of the music is similiar to Hungarian band SOLARIS where the flute is added. Those who like the Hungarian band "AFTER CRYING" might well be interested in this release as it is quite classical at times. A splendid music, as good as SAGRADO or EZRA WINSTON. "Velha Gravura" is the #1 Brazilian prog masterpiece.
