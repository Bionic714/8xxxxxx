Here is a show I had heard about before and did not really care to watch watch.   Was bored and started watching.  Could not stop.  Hope others enjoy the show just as much as me.  This show is for more then the Canucks.  Have a French(France) friend who is enjoying it too.  ( So decided to gather the first three seasons together.  The fourth season is currently airing.
