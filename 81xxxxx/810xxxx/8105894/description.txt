This not the very newest version but you may enjoy this new one also anyway...
Working like a charm however this is not a ChVL cracked version but it should work aswell.
how to proceed :
Install dvdfab offline first...
reboot only if needed...
In any case,run the program at least one time and uncheck case saying : check automaticaly new update. (still offline indeed)
Afterwards then replace your exe but the one provided in DVDFab 9 folder.
That's all,you are ready now to go and run with full retail version.
Beware : untested on x64 so please,report if ok right here.
Ty for understanding.

Enjoy and seed,please.
best regards
