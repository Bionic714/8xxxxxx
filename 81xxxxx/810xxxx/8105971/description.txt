Brother Voodoo is the greatest Marvel Comics hero, ever. No further description necessary!

This fills a request by arrowgreen426. Enjoy 'em!

This is by no means every appearance of BV. Rather, I've tried to combine his first 8 comics appearances (well, 2 were black & white comic magazines) with his other solo stories (MSH #1 and the Doctor Voodoo series) and the funny Fred Hembeck stuff.
*Be sure to read the inside back cover of Fred Sells Marvel!
**More BV appearances were in my torrent collections of New Avengers and Black Panther! A lot more. Bendis loves the guy.

This torrent contains:

STRANGE TALES 169-173 (1973-1974) - BV's solo series that was cancelled, but wrapped up in ...
TALES OF THE ZOMBIE 006 (1974) - black and white Marvel mag
MARVEL TEAM-UP 024 (1974) - not even guest-starring a Spidey story will save BV ...
TALES OF THE ZOMBIE 010 (1975) - ... but BV gets one more solo story

FRED HEMBECK DESTROYS THE MARVEL UNIVERSE (1989) - not a BV appearance, just a bonus
