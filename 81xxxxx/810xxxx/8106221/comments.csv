,turtlex,2013-02-05T20:12Z,"Great, great stuff.  These are the comics that turned me into a life-long Ditko fan.  I knew his work on Amazing Spider-man, which was very good, but he really out did himself on Doctor Strange.  It was the first time another dimension looked actually different.  Very creative stuff!

I already have all of these (in paper form too!) but thanks for the upload.  "

,Mothra67,2013-02-06T07:34Z,Just Dr Strange
