her mental balance and goes into coma when       
she sees her younger sister Poornima(Rekha)      
as a widow on her wedding night. Sharda is       
admitted to a mental hospital and her son is     
looked after Poornima. Time passes by and        
the son now grown up as the handsome Sagar       
(Raj Kiran) considers Poornima as his mother.    
In fact, Sharda's husband Balraj(Shashi Kapoor)  
has married Poornima and they have a son         
together. Suddenly one day, Sharda wakes up      
from coma and escapes from the hospital.         
Doctor (Iftekhar) reaches home first and         
tells everyone that Sharda should get the        
house exactly like she had left 20 years back.   
Poornima not only changes the curtains and decor 
of the house but also dresses herself as widow...
What happens when Sharda starts her life as      
Balraj's wife again forms the remaining storyline
