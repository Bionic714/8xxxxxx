What’s not shown in movie about Muhammad

(26.714), (29.87)
* eleven wives [SB1:5:268] and state of affairs in ayesha’s marriage (SB 1:6:298, 7:62:60:88), Zainab (Qur'an 33:37), Captive Juwairiya (SB 3:46:13:717), Safiya (SB:2:14:5:68, 4:52:74:143)

Contradications
# The Movie 00:51:11 -> Where are Muhammad's miracles….? | Quran 30:50. And they say: ""….""The signs are only with Allah, and I am only a plain warner."" | Quran 54:1 1. …….. to show them a miracle, .. he showed them the splitting of the moon)
# The Movie 00:20:07-> but people changed it, turned it, forgot it | 02:26:39 -> ……their testament must be respected …for their books ..came from god

Summarizing
The Movie 00:26:08 -> But it is wrong..The Gods that let such things be are no Gods
Religions is the determination to stay ignorant in the face of all facts as Ignorance is bliss.
