Together is set in one of the communes that sprang up around Stockholm 
in the 1970s. Loosely led by the sweet-natured Göran, who will do 
anything to avoid a conflict, the group spend their time arguing about 
left-wing politics and other questions such as whether doing the dishes 
is bourgeois. The commune's dynamics are significantly shaken when 
Göran's sister leaves her violent husband Rolf and moves in, bringing 
her two children Eva and Stefan.
