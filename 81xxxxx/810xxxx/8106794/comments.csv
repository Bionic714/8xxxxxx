,usedleechlife,2013-03-17T03:55Z,"Like the guy above, I also made an account just to comment (especially since it's your first upload). I just found out about this band a few hours ago, so I'm glad there's a torrent for it. This is the only one here, so much thanks. A list of the albums included in the torrent description would be good in the future though.

Also, the split with La Dispute in here is something I didn't even know existed, so I love you.

For anyone else who might download, great quality overall, all songs have relevant tags and album art, organized into folders by album and date, contains two studio albums, 4 split EPs with other bands, their demo EP, and some live performance stuff.

10/10 upload, would bang"

Thanks for the nice comment and I appreciate the advice as well. I'll make sure to include a list next time. Thanks again and enjoy the music, good sir."
