The NFL is all i really watch around the august-february time. And you made it possible for alot of us to be able to download HD games without worrying about our ratio.

Thats what i have to do on my tyt account
Ratio, ratio, ratio...

thank you. hope to see you again next season!!

Take care bro."
[V],Nepotu,2013-02-06T00:29Z,"Thank you very much, my dear friend, for your nice words! I've done only what I could to help people to be happy for a little while.
Take care, bro, and I hope to hear from you again soon."

For people like myself who enjoy the NFL but cant get it any other way, this is nirvana, so thanks again and may you keep up the wonderful work... even if my favorite Broncos were usually the last to be uploaded :)"

So it's great to be able to grab as much as possible out here. THANK YOU, hope you'll be back next season!"

I use these on my video editor for a specific NFL team, their new coaches, and some specific position players.  It is great to get be able edit starting from the onset of the play and not have to wade through all of the commercials and pre-snap shifting and get to the real game execution.  If you could let me know now if you ""are"" or ""are not"" going to be able to do week03 it would be a great help to me.  Again thank you for everything. You and your team do a great job."
