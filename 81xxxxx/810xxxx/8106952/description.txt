Plot Synopsis
Tum is a Buddhist monk for 27 years. When his sister is killed in a terrorist explosion on a train in the south of Thailand,
he decided to disrobe in order to look after his niece. Once in the city, Tum has to learn a new life.
Living above his sister's hair salon, he is confronted with a new world he knows nothing about, i.e. cell phones, drinking,
sex, love, trousers with zip, to ride a bicycle, to work. This movie raises Buddhist vs Muslim themes.
