[V],Mr.Stifmeister,2013-02-05T20:45Z,"@NixeaKip and pelius40:
Cant you read the description above??
It clearly says "" We've included the required updated data in this pack for your convenience""
Thats why this is 2GB.

Enjoy everyone! :)"
,Alilyia777,2013-02-05T20:46Z,"@NecroFile
If I actually own the game, will I still need to use the crack?
I think no, cos I played Dawnguard ""free edition"" with Steam with bought Skyrim. It`s just like another plug-in."
,wipper_tja,2013-02-05T20:49Z,Please someone tell me if i can install this if i own skyrim on steam. Please help!!
,Kyushi,2013-02-05T20:58Z,"It works, just went to solstiem myself thank you! :3"
,hydre57,2013-02-05T21:00Z,"Is this english only or multi?
Thx btw."
,bobbythejobby,2013-02-05T21:01Z,This is very suspicious at 2GB the XBOX verified torrent is only 600MB :    http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7886729/Skyrim_Dlc_Dragonborn_Xbox_360
,89One98,2013-02-05T21:04Z,Thanks for Upload ^^ but its 902Seeds/1902Peers so i`ll download it tomorrow...
,89One98,2013-02-05T21:07Z,Why would two VIP uploaders betray you?^^
,Kalaran,2013-02-05T21:15Z,"Guys, the torrent is fake, is a 2gb virus that burns the whole pc cause y'all says so because the torrent upload time was too soon. Derp.

@bobbythejobby

Are you seriously comparing capacity of files between consoles and PCs?
"
,NixeaKip,2013-02-05T21:16Z,"@Mr.Stifmeister
No update has been over 1 gb so far."
,89One98,2013-02-05T21:18Z,... Dragonborn=1.26GB Updates=rest...Download it and report back...
[V],Mr.Stifmeister,2013-02-05T21:19Z,"@kakren2: You should count ALL the updates from reloaded, not the latest one... then you get around 1GB.
Stop spamming about that now thanks and enjoy this DLC :)"
[V],Mr.Stifmeister,2013-02-05T21:22Z,"@kakren2: Take it or leave it, no one is forcing you to download this... so stop behaving like a kid and just accept this awesome DLC."
,NixeaKip,2013-02-05T21:24Z,"@Mr.Stifmeister
And why do we have 3 torrents of the same size that are supposed to be the Dragonborn DLC uploaded at nearly the same time? Can't you even recognize how suspicious it is?"
,NixeaKip,2013-02-05T21:27Z,"@kakren2
Your point is even better, it makes no sense that ALL updates are included, as you just need the last one (they are exactly the same files)."
,89One98,2013-02-05T21:33Z,Well there are 700 Seeders and noone said smth...STOP PLOTTING EVIL PLANS!
,narc780,2013-02-05T21:36Z,"Yea, personally Im going to plunk down the $20 or $16 from other sources for it. This seems a little too shady for a standard release."
,fear553,2013-02-05T21:36Z,thank you for this upload stifmeister and @kakren2 i suggest you so some appreciation to stifmeister for uploading this instead of being such a big wining baby
[V],Mr.Stifmeister,2013-02-05T21:38Z,"@fear553: Thank you and happy you like this :)
Yea people should just ignore those immature guys... there is a reason why i got a green skull and they dont.

Anyway, last comment from me, ENJOY :D"
,loserman7,2013-02-05T21:39Z,How are there no seeders? How can anyone download without at least 1` seeder?
,hydre57,2013-02-05T21:40Z,"There is 569 seeders, the website just isn't updated."
,NixeaKip,2013-02-05T21:41Z,"The last ""sinister"" torrent was removed and now a new one is back up."
,NixeaKip,2013-02-05T21:43Z,"Also, there's a big difference between being an ungrateful whinny and pointing out obviously suspicious stuff. Neither of you have made any counter arguments against us so far, except insulting us. Who are the immature ones in here?"
,mark617,2013-02-05T21:44Z,What's with the permissions for the steam.api.dll? My AV keeps kicking this back and requesting deletion. Can I simply play without copying over the cracked files via the razor1911 install?
,narc780,2013-02-05T21:47Z,"And if everything is on the up and up with this release, big thanks to the uploader and thanks to RELOADED for their hard work. I just can't wait anymore :p"
,chrisca,2013-02-05T21:48Z,":DDDDDD So hilarious u guys. Trying spamming and trolling so damn hard. It's really amusing rofl.
If you check the hash you will see 1000+ seeds and all major trackers distributing this DLC. AND VIP members. They prove their liability so many times, what you had prove? Stupidity is in fact unbeatable.

Downloading + seeding. Great Job as always Stiffy ;)"
,NixeaKip,2013-02-05T21:50Z,"@chrisca
Again, you fail to explain how is this NOT suspicious. I don't care about the reputation of the uploader, there's another one with a cute green skull with a file of exactly the same size (a size that makes no sense at all). And you guys can't even recognize how shady this is. "
,hydre57,2013-02-05T21:51Z,"On the skidrow website: dragonborn is only 1.13Gb with ""the required updated data""...
Why this difference of size?"
,skidajbro,2013-02-05T21:51Z,"Come on guys,seed please!"
,SlipVayne,2013-02-05T21:54Z,"You guys complaining about the size didn't do your research... Dragonborn is a much larger update to Skyrim compared to Dawnguard and Hearthfire. There are plenty of new items, new crafting materials, new features, and a whole new continent to explore... STFU and be happy that someone is even willing to provide this to you ungrateful bastards FREE OF CHARGE."
,JoaoPauloBR,2013-02-05T21:54Z,SEED YOU FUCKS!
,89One98,2013-02-05T21:55Z,"@hydre57 well you are right but ill try it anyway and thank Mr.Stifmeister for his upload, if it works ^^"
,SlipVayne,2013-02-05T21:55Z,Be patient and wait your turn.
,NixeaKip,2013-02-05T21:56Z,"@SlipVayne
You've got to be the first one that actually explains why is this so big with arguments that make sense. It's not about being ungrateful (will you cut it off already?), but rather about being concerned over the safety of your pc. We asked several times why is this so large, and the answers made no sense. It's only natural that we were suspicious about it."
,CJ2311,2013-02-05T21:58Z,"Thank you kindly for this upload, have been waiting a long time to play this DLC :D"
,mark617,2013-02-05T21:59Z,"Well, the file steam.api.dll gave me issues. I simply downloaded and reinstalled the relaoded update 11 from here and it worked fine. DLC is fine, can travel to the island etc. Don't expect you to believe me since I don't have any torrents, but whatever. Thank you for the torrent Stif. Appreciate it "
,wipper_tja,2013-02-05T21:59Z,can i play this if i own skyrim on steam??!?!
,SlipVayne,2013-02-05T22:00Z,The one on the skidrow website is a packaged RAR and this is a standalone ISO. Maybe that's your difference.
,hydre57,2013-02-05T22:01Z,"@SlipVayne It sounds good, thx!"
,06158,2013-02-05T22:03Z,"Dammit, this isn't working for me (I'm just sitting around, waiting to be attacked by cultists in whiterun - but they never appear). Any tips? Should I reinstall?"
,SlipVayne,2013-02-05T22:03Z,"Island, continent, landmass, who gives a shit? It's not in Skyrim, and it's not small."
,fatalerror248,2013-02-05T22:03Z,Thank you kind sir. You have my seed.
,SlipVayne,2013-02-05T22:05Z,"Ohhhhhh shit guys, watch it. It's the geography nazi."
,Dranuul,2013-02-05T22:06Z,"for those who fear of the size, if you read the game developers descriptions and reports, Dragonborn isn't actually considered a DLC but rather an expansion... so it's bound to take up more space..."
,SlipVayne,2013-02-05T22:07Z,@Dranuul I couldn't have said it better myself.
,Arrancar88,2013-02-05T22:08Z,"900 seed and I am downloading at 2.0KB/s, seems like I will finish in 15 weeks, can't wait..."
,hydre57,2013-02-05T22:09Z,Does anyone know about the language? Multi or english only?
,icebeing,2013-02-05T22:13Z,How would I extract the ESM and BSA or whatever from the file without the installer? I'm using a mac so I can't really run .exe. Thx for the help.
,SlipVayne,2013-02-05T22:14Z,"""Tamriel is the continent where the events of all The Elder Scrolls games take place.""

Taken right from the Elder Scrolls wiki."
,chrisca,2013-02-05T22:16Z,SlipVayne don't bite bro. They just trolling ;)
,SlipVayne,2013-02-05T22:17Z,"And also for Nirn: ""The planet contains a notably large CONTINENT Tamriel, which is where all of the Elder Scrolls games take place. With another similarly large CONTINENT to the east named Akavir. The land masses are separated by the Padomaic Ocean, a massive saline body of water."
,InterfectorDEI,2013-02-05T22:18Z,@ Kaken2 Tamriel is a continent on Mundus as is Akaviir. www.uesp.net 
,SlipVayne,2013-02-05T22:21Z,There is also a frozen continent north of Tamriel known as Atmora and the island-continent known as Ptandonea far southwest.
,06158,2013-02-05T22:23Z,"Not that anyone was going to answer me anyway, but I figured it out (the installer created a new Skyrim folder inside my skyrim folder - weird), and the addon works fine. You may now return to the geography lesson."
,SlipVayne,2013-02-05T22:25Z,Thanks for letting us know. If anyone actually had the complete thing yet maybe we would have answered. Still stuck at 9% here...
,Arrancar88,2013-02-05T22:27Z,I am stuck at 0.3% for 1 hour
,devils.reject77,2013-02-05T22:27Z,"@mark617
Did the same :D and does work, thanks I thought I wasn't going to be able to play"
,NumbedChaos,2013-02-05T22:30Z,"I trust Stifmeister, of course. But, I have two questions : Why is this an ISO ? And Is it 2Gigs because it contains Dawnguard plus Hearthfire ?"
,chrisca,2013-02-05T22:39Z,"@NumbedChaos Dawnguard+Hearthfires=1,26 GB (bsa+esm). So no. Dragonborn is way much bigger to fit in the remaining 0.74 GB, and there's also the update. It's an iso not a high compressed rar, that's why the size."
,spikeabercrombie,2013-02-05T22:41Z,"everyone stfu lol who cares if its a continent or not, how about you post something useful like--
1. Does this work?
2. Is this compatible with SKSE and SkyUI+other mods
3. Any known bugs?
4. Graphics/texture/artifact/crash issues?
come on people, its software, not geography class"
,spikeabercrombie,2013-02-05T22:48Z,"also, i apologize for my low upload speed :( i live in the middle of nowhere and only get 3.5mbps down and 768K upload so...sorry if i can only push ~50Kb/s"

,spikeabercrombie,2013-02-05T23:00Z,"seriously though, does anyone that uses SKSE and SkyUI including other mods and 
have installed this DLC had any probs? dont feel like breaking my skyrim until SKSE releases another update"
,SlipVayne,2013-02-05T23:02Z,"@spikeabercrombie
Make a copy of your current skyrim directory... if anything craps up you can just revert back to the copy you made."
,SlipVayne,2013-02-05T23:04Z,From almost 1k seeders down to 632... and ofcourse the leechers doubled in size. Fucking assholes.

,cubedj21,2013-02-05T23:30Z,"for all those are asking about compatibility with SKSE...

,spikeabercrombie,2013-02-05T23:30Z,"@kakren2 no problem :D was just making sure it worked with SKSE 1.6.whatever the newest version is, after the download finishes i will test it with SkyUI for any SkyUI users here, thanks again kakren2 ^^"
,cubedj21,2013-02-05T23:32Z,ok... confirmed... :)) SKSE 1.06.06 works fine..
,spikeabercrombie,2013-02-05T23:32Z,@cubedj21 yes i have seen people on forums talking about 1.8 was for dragonborn and skse should already be compatible but always good to test and confirm lol never know what random mod might cause a crash

,jhorton14,2013-02-06T00:02Z,Thanks for another great torrent! I was wondering if since dragonborn is just going to be 2 esps and a BSA if I could just install it without using the crack because I own Skyrim through Steam. Thanks.
,cubedj21,2013-02-06T00:03Z,"2InterfectorDEI: ah... those latest games from skidrow are not what it used to be before, and almost all their new cracks are not working in Win8... but difference 0.9gb can't be because of cracked exe.. maybe some localization files, cause Dragonborn should be localized in 5 languages (even audio).."

That's because you are not the Dragonborn anymore after starting the expansion... you must go back to the graybeards and suck their dicks like a true Dovahkiin to show your worth.

Do not fail this task, Dragonborn."
,NecroFile,2013-02-06T16:19Z,"If you have a legit copy of the game on Steam, do not install it over the actual installation of the game.

Simple as fuck and works."

,kakren,2013-02-06T20:28Z,"Alright, for those of you who are having problems with steam popping up everytime you try to start the launcher/game you must first download the newest update for skyrim. get it here: https://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7785192/The.Elder.Scrolls.V.Skyrim.Update.11-RELOADED
this will fix your problem 100% i've already helped alot of people with this same issue. also if your having problem getting the dlc to work, try disabling your antivirus first, and then try again. in addition the dlc begins in whiterun for those of you who don't know, just enter the city via the front gate and (if the dlc is activated) you should see ahead of you, a man wearing a complete set of ebony armor, he is called the ebony warrior. if you can't see him then more then likely your dlc is not activated and/or you have not installed it in the right place..."
,kakren,2013-02-06T20:45Z,"also for those of you whose dlc isn't even showing up in your launcher's mod list (i'm talking about the data option on your launcher's menu once it is open) here is a trick you can try, in your appdata folder (located at C:Usersyour user nameAppData) double click on the ""Local"" folder
in there you should find a folder labled ""Skyrim""
double click that. inside you should find 1 to 2 files. one will be named ""plugins.ini"" or ""plugins.txt"" and you may have one named ""DLClist.txt"" now what you wanna do is opened up ""plugins.txt"" or ""plugins.ini"" (whichever one you have) and, if not already there, add ""Dragonborn.Esm"" without the quotations to the list. make sure to add it as the 3rd or 4th in the list. after thats done, do the same to ""DLClist.txt"" that should add dragonborn to your mod list and should now be activated."
,kakren,2013-02-06T20:48Z,"this is the full location for the files to edit:
C:UsersyourusernameAppDataLocalSkyrim"
,kakren,2013-02-06T21:05Z,"the site is taking out the slashes after the comment is posted so let's try this again with spaces: C: Users yourusername AppData Local Skyrim 
there! also for those of you who can't find your appdata folder, that's because it's hidden by defualt, to unhide it do the following: click on the start menu, (it's the orb with the windows logo located at the far bottom left of your desktop's screen.) now in the seach box, type ""search""
then click the option ""change search options for files and folders"" doing so will bring up a window/box named ""folder options"" click on the ""view"" tab, and under the heading ""advanced settings"" you'll see the option ""show hidden files,folders,and drives"" make sure that option is ticked. now your appdata folder can be seen, but your not done yet, to make it unhidden, you have to go back to your appdata folder is located, right click it and choose the option ""properties"" you will then get another pop up box, now under the heading ""attributes"" (which is on the general tab)
you should see the option ""hidden"" make sure that's unticked. there now you're done!"
,ArrTee,2013-02-06T21:20Z,"Stifmeister, first off, thanks for the UP, much appreciated!

Question for the guys here.. I have the SIMON version of Skyrim installled (VANILLA), should I DL all the updates (from TPB), then install the expansion? Or does the latest patch/crack bring the game up to date? I ask because I've tried making dragonborn work for the last two huors and nothing.. waiting outside of whiterun..:  Thanks again guys, and to the Stifmeister!"

,Berry2012,2013-02-07T00:21Z,"First of all, I wanted to say that you, kakren, are a truly awesome person. 
Second: 
I already have thought of that mod and installed it. But I have a theory about what could cause the problem: I have a new save fom the nexus installed, because my old one got corrupted, and I believe that this save could cause the problems as it is just imported. I noticed that anything I do with the cultists, for example killin them per console and taking their notes, even then it freezes the game."
,kakren,2013-02-07T00:27Z,"berry, now that you remind me you are correct, that is indeed the problem, your imported save file is incompatible with dragonborn. i have had similar
problems with my saves, but not with dragonborn,
somehow or another sometimes saves get corrupted and will cuase your game to crash 5 minutes. this has happened to me, i had to go back and load an earlier save, and that solved the problem, so i suggest you do the same. if you don't have an earlier save i could see about giving you one one mine..."
,Berry2012,2013-02-07T00:37Z,"Yeah, that worked now. It just has some lag spikes but I guess that's just all the mods I packed on to this. Still fearing that it might crash but I'll guess it will be fine. Thanks for the help!"

,Jebus-Kreist,2013-02-07T01:27Z,"So uh yeah, tested game first without dragonborn,  but with dawngaurd and it works fine, install dragonborn with crack/etc and it gets up to continue/load/new startup loading into world and crashes to desktop without any error messages. Would this have anything to do with the ""steam_api.dll"" not functioning properly? Because through trial and error skyrim doesn't start with the one provided and even has errors and AVG flipping shit about even selecting the file. Starts with the one from dawngaurd, hence making it up the the first loading screen into the world with the dawngaurd steam_api.dll.

I've read up to see if its just a generic problem with the update and it SOUNDS like it is an issue with RAM requirements being far too low for the game to run properly. That doesn't even make sense with the latter explanation of the problem."
,Berry2012,2013-02-07T01:30Z,"@jameslane
Your version is up-to-date thus you do not need to download a new patch, just install this and the copy the crack and you'll be fine."
,Jebus-Kreist,2013-02-07T01:44Z,More trial and error testing just happened. It turns out the game runs perfectly fine without dragonborn being selected on the startup menu(AKA not being run/used). But running dragonborn causes it to crash about 1/3 the way through loading screen after selecting load/new/continue.

Have you tried to install this mod here already?:

Those of you who're scared of the Steam_api.dll file thing, here's what I did:

First off, I unplugged my LAN cable, disabled my anti virus for 10 minutes and started the game. No problems, it ran smoothly. I saved and quit.

Then I tried again with anti virus on. Got the warning and the error, and the game didn't start.

Then I downloaded this torrent: http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7785192/The.Elder.Scrolls.V.Skyrim.Update.11-RELOADED
And I used the steam_api.dll file from it instead of the one included in this torrent. Nothing registered on my anti virus, and the game ran smoothly.

So there you go. Happy adventuring."

,Jebus-Kreist,2013-02-07T16:41Z,"@VitorCz It did the same to me at first, then I realized that the installer it comes with DOESN'T automatically do the crack, you manually have to do it yourself. On that note it is better if you do not use the crack that's provided because it contains a pretty obvious virus. Just go and (manually) install the skyrim update 11(torrented from PB) and it will work fine, though My game crashed at first, installed an unofficial patch for dragonborn, then the save file I had was incompatible... hugely disappointing but unavoidable."
,Berry2012,2013-02-07T17:11Z,"@ Jebus-Kreist
As I also had a problem with a save, the only way is to try earlier stages of the save to a point where it is not corrupted.
You could if all of that does not work download a save from the Skyrimnexus, there are more than enough which are fully or partially complete with the game."

,kakren,2013-02-07T23:14Z,"so, assuming you have installed the new unofficial dragonborn patch from nexusmods, it would seem it is a bug that they have not yet fixed in the current version, however they do update the patch on a regular basis, so check back from time to time. in the mean time you can try, downloading and installing the newest update from here, update 11, if you haven't aleady, then try loading an earlier save and trying again, your save may be corrupt, also try disabling all other mods you may have, except official ones from bethesda, (dawnguard and heathfire) and then try again."

It really sounds like your Dragonborn is not being loaded. A way to fix this is by changing your mod order. In this case Dragonborn.esm would go underneath Skyrim.esm / Dawnguard (if installed) I prefer using NMM for issues as such. Give it a try and let's cross our fingers it's working! "

,sublime1996,2013-02-22T21:25Z,"I found a fix (that worked for me) to get the Dragonborn file to show up in the Data Files list.  

When installing the crack, direct it to an alternate directory from your normal Skyrim directory and then copy over the Dragonborn.bsa and Dragonborn.esm files over to the Data folder of your Skyrim directory.

For example, I have Skyrim installed on my D: partition.  During the Dragonborn install, I changed the drive letter and directed it to install to my C: partition.  Once the install completed, I went into the location on the C: drive, copied/cut the 2 files, and pasted them into my normal Skyrim directory on the D: drive.  After doing this, I found the Dragonborn file listed in the Data Files and successfully (and finally) got Dragonborn to work.

I'm sure it'll work the same if you just create another folder just for the install as opposed to doing it on a completely separate partition, this is just what I did myself.

Also, look for Chuckfist's comment (page 13) for the loading order of the Data Files and edit the .ini file if your Data Files option is grayed out.

Hope this helps!"
,JigSaw118,2013-02-23T10:03Z,"Hey guys. You are maybe able to help me :(

So months ago I've downloaded Skyrim (Razor 1911) and also installed a german patch. Everything worked fine until I had downloaded the DLCs. When the first one, Dawnguard + Update 10, was installed I wasen't able anymore to reach the main menu after I pressed play. It just kicks me back to the destkop when the Bethesda logo appears. There is also no crash report or something like that.
So I tried to install Heathfire as well as Dragonborn + Update 11 but it doesn't solved the problem. 
I've already tried the following solutions:
1. Editing the ""SkyrimPrefs.ini"" as suggested (also in administration mode) 
2. change the audio settings as suggested

None of them worked. Are there any other solutions? :(
I would realy appreciate your help."
,sublime1996,2013-02-23T19:27Z,"@JigSaw118

Do you have a patch installed for an expansion that you don't have?  For example, do you have the unofficial patch installed for Dawnguard without having the Dawnguard expansion itself?  If so, disable any patches for expansions you don't have.  That  same thing happened to me and that is what worked in my situation.

Or try downloading the unofficial patches for the DLCs you do have (if you haven't already.)  Also, look for Chuckfist's comment regarding the load order for the DLCs and patches.  It could cause a problem if the system isn't loading things in the order it likes."

,nuneral,2013-02-25T09:48Z,"HOW I GOT IT TO WORK:
- installed add-on to separate folder
- copied all files to the skyrim folder
- re-copied the reloaded 11 patch to skyrim folder
- You need to add that line in SkyrimPrefs.ini located in My document/MyGames/Skyrim or something quite close for any windows os.

Look for the line:
[Launcher]
bShowAllResolutions=0
uLastAspectRatio=2

And add it like this:
[Launcher]
bShowAllResolutions=0
uLastAspectRatio=2
bEnableFileSelection=1

don't alter bshowallresolutions or ulastaspectfileselection values if they are different for you just add ""bEnableFileSelection=1""

- click skyrim launcher
- click data files
- enable the DLC
- play

tips to get questline: go to white run, go inside a building then come back out and you will probably get attacked by the people that start the Dragonborn questline. if not run around whiterun for a while going in and out of buildings. they'll come if you actually activated the dlc.

I've googled it and there's nothing useful besides a bunch of people complaining about the same deal.

,sublime1996,2013-02-28T02:30Z,"@chloelp

IMO, easiest way may be to download a free program called Virtual Clone Drive.  After that, all .iso and similar files are associated with that program so all you'll have to do is double-click on the image (.iso) file and it will automatically mount it for you so you can install the game.

,Son_Of_Northern_Darkness,2013-03-06T06:06Z,"Thank you Mr.Stifmeister and RELOADED ! 
Easy , uncomplicated and hassle-free instalation process. I'm still on Vista and had no problem installing and running this DLC! 
You made this Skyrim fan very happy!
I think I speak for most (should be ALL) people when I say , we really really appreciate people such as yourself , who share and make torrents such as this one so easy to use.Not to mention free.
Although don't get me wrong, just like with ME3  and ME2 , Mirror's Edge , Oblivion , Driver San Francisco , Skyrim and a TON MORE , I always end up buying the original game.

The talented people and programmers who put their blood and sweat into creating super cool and immerse worlds for us to get lost in , deserve the highest praises not to mention a paycheck!

So I support them not just with words but with my wallet.

Also to everyone out there who enjoys downloading games , movies , music - you name it.
Seed please! We're all in this together! You know how much you hate it when the DL speed is slow or if only a few people are seeding a torrent you so desperately want? Well seed than please !
My rule of thumb is seed at least the size of the torrent file you originally downloaded.
Although I usually seed a lot more , depending on how many people are seeding.The less seeders , the longer I seed.
So all in all ,I usually end up seeding at least a 5:1 ratio.You should do the same! 

Enjoy this awesome DLC Dragonborns !!! "
,SirReaper,2013-03-06T19:49Z,Why windows defender keeps saying that the steam_api.dll has a virus or something ?
,Son_Of_Northern_Darkness,2013-03-07T23:23Z,"@ SirReaper : 
Who cares what Windows Defender says? I can vouch this torrent has no viruses as I and countless have installed and tested the game.
Besides , almost all cracked games will show up as some kind of a virus when scanned with your anti-virus software.And that's because cracked files are in a sense viruses (Google it if you need a more detailed explanation)
So to sum it up - no the game does not have a virus , regardless of what Windows Defender says or doesn't say.Just instal the game and enjoy it as it's an awesome awesome game."
,segamon,2013-03-09T18:58Z,you got to just love the installers music. thanks guys.

,Styrone,2013-03-11T15:19Z,"Hi, please help me. I'm not sure where to copy DLC, i have different folder in my normal Skyrim game folder, where the DLC is. I start it normally, but i am not sure if it works with or without the DLC. Thanks"
,gaziki,2013-03-12T12:09Z,"WARNING!
DLC DOESNT WORK ! ! !

After instalation complete you cant select any DLC at data files so at game you have no expansion. Its some kind of fake torrent.

Beware!"
,RavenousRaven,2013-03-15T04:28Z,Can you use dlc if you have the paid version of skyrim?
,RavenousRaven,2013-03-15T04:37Z,nevermind :)
,RavenousRaven,2013-03-15T04:52Z,so you have to block steam in your firewall if you have the retail version of skyrim?
,Dankaru81,2013-03-20T06:41Z,"@NixeaKip

This might be beating a dead horse at this point but...

They have no reason to counter argue anything you are saying. Obviously you dont DL much from here or you would know who the uploader is. And YES his rep does matter. It says that he's not going to scam you or infect your system. Pretty much every game I have from TPB comes from Mr. Stifmeister and I have exactly 0 virus' or ill things to say about him. You fail."
,Dankaru81,2013-03-20T06:50Z,"And OMFG do ppl just download things and not read the f**king comments!? 
@Gaziki ""WARNING!

THI"
,Kyashii,2013-03-20T14:26Z,@RavenousRaven You don't need to block steam via firewall- pirated DLC should work fine with a retail copy.
,RavenousRaven,2013-03-21T01:22Z,"@Kyashii

Thanks. I will take your word for it."
,RavenousRaven,2013-03-24T22:37Z,Ok Well I have the retail version of Skyrim and I installed this DLC. But I did not use the crack because I dont know if I should because of my legit copy of Skyrim. When I got to Data Files I do not see the DLC files that I should enable. In my prefs.ini file I have it set to where I can have file selection already. Anyone know what to do?
,Eversman6,2013-03-27T07:03Z,Follow the instructions and it will work perfectly fine. Great upload and DLC.
[T],Realuploads,2013-03-28T10:12Z,"It works


- You need to add that line in SkyrimPrefs.ini located in My document/MyGames/Skyrim

Look for the line:
[Launcher]
bShowAllResolutions=0
uLastAspectRatio=2

And add it like this:
[Launcher]
bShowAllResolutions=0
uLastAspectRatio=2
bEnableFileSelection=1

,mo.sk21,2013-03-31T12:49Z,"hello, everybody can someone help me in the installation it stops a message appears that says ``the source file is corupted`` in dragonborn bsa"
,rihard321,2013-04-01T12:38Z,do I have to install it in the same directory as skyrim or in a separate one?
,herlefors,2013-04-14T21:01Z,"Okey so i get a problem after installing this and I did follow the instructions, my game crash after i get to the main menu and then selects continue, the loading screen appears and then it just shuts down, help!!"
,sacramentwolf,2013-04-15T10:06Z,"Installed great. Problem! When i get to the point where i first mount a dragon, it flies away, leaving me in a sitting position hovering in the air, while it leaves me behind. Anyone know of a fix?"
,Hyrcyne,2013-04-18T03:21Z,"Skyrim works im having trouble like a lot of people with the unable to check data files problem. however my Skyrimprefs.ini does have the bEnableFileSelection=1 line there. 
Anyone got a another common problem it might be? or wanna explain the Nexus mod manager work around a bit?"
,loneger,2013-04-20T02:23Z,"Yeah for me I had to install the 11 update, found here http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7785192/The.Elder.Scrolls.V.Skyrim.Update.11-RELOADED, I copied the files from that to the folder where i had installed dragonborn then copied all that to my skyrim folder in program files, then it popped up in my dlc checkbox place"
,darkdescent666,2013-04-20T18:46Z,Thanks !!
,Nuhlie,2013-05-05T13:51Z,"There is another ""SystemPref.ini"" in My GamesSkyrim. Make sure u add the line under [Launcher] in there too."
,Nuhlie,2013-05-05T13:59Z,"That's /Users/Name/My Documents/My Games

or just My Games in My Documents"
,papayrus,2013-05-20T23:33Z,Does this include hearthfire and dawnguard or is that completely different?
,leski666,2013-05-23T19:08Z,including polish version or only eng?
,blizzard_67,2013-05-26T17:21Z,"Works like a charm.For those guys that can't get it to work just downlad the update 12,and do as Realuploads indicates and you will be fine.Thx again    you guys are the best "
