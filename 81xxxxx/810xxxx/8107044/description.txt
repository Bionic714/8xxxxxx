ItΓÇÖs one of the first lessons you learn in poker, and you usually learn it the hard way: Play poker with a liar, and you can lose your money, your house and even your heart. And in a town where justice is a game, blind Matt Murdock is about to learn that lesson all too well. Welcome to the cycle of violence, Daredevil. It was here before you were born into this dirty city, and itΓÇÖll be here after youΓÇÖre six feet under. And in the Great Depression ΓÇö which has Manhattan and HellΓÇÖs Kitchen in its grip ΓÇö youΓÇÖve got your part to play in it. And that part means going through the Kingpin!
