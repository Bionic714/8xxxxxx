,meteo1234567,2013-02-05T20:41Z,tks A LOT MEN!!!    need more seeders.... where r u?
,JOHN007C,2013-02-05T20:43Z,will this work on a Legit Steam Version?
,89One98,2013-02-05T20:48Z,Was the 1.23GB version that somebody uploaded and then deleted fake? And could you upload Crack Only?
,WrathgarWarlord,2013-02-05T20:49Z,Is this legit? 
,Malvon,2013-02-05T20:56Z,thank you! thank you! thank you! :o i knew someone would get it up soon but not this soon!
,WrathgarWarlord,2013-02-05T21:02Z,So is this one the same as the other one that was uploaded a while before?
,jhorton14,2013-02-05T21:08Z,Downloading. Waiting for others to start seeding.
,narc780,2013-02-05T21:14Z,"This SHOULD work on a legit steam copy, only thing that as of Feb 5, the game wasn't patched and dragonborn is supposed to come with a patch."
,Bajker90,2013-02-05T21:15Z,"@89One98
yes that was fake, it was damn survey and messes up your game, anyway SEED!!!"
,NixeaKip,2013-02-05T21:22Z,"Again, another suspiciously large file. Not gonna bother getting it, I'd rather wait for something that makes sense and doesn't smell like a trap."
,narc780,2013-02-05T21:28Z,"Also it's going to take a little while before there's a lot of seeders, this isn't exactly a small file and I'm topping out at about 50 kb/s. Most seeders aren't able to upload much more than 1MB/s so with thousands going at it right now, it's getting cut up pretty heavy."
,Serenifly,2013-02-05T21:31Z,Do I also need the 1.8 patch for this? I haven't updated yet because those fixes were pretty minor
,89One98,2013-02-05T21:50Z,"@kakren2 well fuck xD ill delete it then, update and download a new one :x"
,Berserk.,2013-02-05T21:52Z,SEED PLS!
,NixeaKip,2013-02-05T21:59Z,"If you want to test things out in a safe way, don't get the update in here but rather from somewhere else (1.8) and try loading the esm and bsa archives that should come with it. If they don't work, well, you get the idea."
,seraph11b,2013-02-05T22:25Z,6 Seeders.... cmon really. stream as you play people. Heromaster thanks for the upload.
,Nniikk,2013-02-06T02:13Z,"thank you 
You are my hero"
,theshop,2013-02-06T02:29Z,Will this DLC update the game to update 11 if installed on fresh install of Skyrim?
,ocnblitz,2013-02-06T06:04Z,Seeding with my 165/65 connection. Hurry up and play this awesome game guys!
,Grizzy2,2013-02-06T08:49Z,im having trouble my skyrim goes straight to steam from launcher after dl can i get some assistance please?
,ottoskjold,2013-02-06T13:12Z,"my skyrim just open steam and nothing else, have copyed the crack, please help me"
,NoCaRe,2013-02-06T16:19Z,It doesn't show up it in the launcher data files ?
,GObonzo,2013-02-06T18:54Z,works great
,Michelbfr,2013-02-06T19:41Z,"I can't get it to work... Downloaded, installed and cracked, but nothing appears at the Skyrim Launcher (data files)."
,xiomora,2013-02-07T04:23Z,"for those who are having issues with installation, please read this carefully...

You must use Winrar to extract the setup/data files. i recommend extracting these in a new folder. now, right click the iso, use your winrar options tab to extract its files to the new folder, in which case you should get a regular setup exe with a nice 'R' icon. click on that setup, and it will install the bsa and esm files altogether for you, the work is pretty much done for you. Hero did great job with this one, and again brother, i shall thank you."
,mvaleth,2013-02-08T22:59Z,"HOW TEST if dlc is working? There`s a requisite lvl to acess the dragonborn dlc content?

I installed and it appears marked in datafiles, as Dawnguard, but I dont know how to acess the new content in game, it appears the same for me."
,asrivak,2013-02-17T00:43Z,"Why is my download stuck at 99%? 
This is the second time I treid to download this, I tried a different torrent o the same name and apparently there was a trojan? Even when I tried to ignore it and install the crack, it wouldn't work and would now only connects to steam... "
,gjuro,2013-02-22T14:24Z,"i have installed the game as said in instructions  (right folder), copied crack and everything but when i start the game, i can't see any changes. it's still the same old skyrim, as if i never installed this addon. please help."
,Hokunamotata,2013-02-24T01:18Z,"I've done everything, up to the point where I copy the files from the ""Crack"" folder into my Skyrim folder, but for some reason it wont let me copy the ""steam_api.dll"" file over. Something about needing to get permission from everyone? I've spent about 2 hours searching online, I tried sharing the folder/putting the level ad Administrative, but nothing seems to work. PLEASE HELP!!!!!!!"
