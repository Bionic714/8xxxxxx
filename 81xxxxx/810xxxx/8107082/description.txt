This is the eBook by Sarah Wilcox called Get Ride of Herpes.

***********************************************************

In mid 2011 after months of tweaking and trialing without an outbreak I decided to publish  the method online as a full and easy to follow protocol, it's true there were already snippets of the herpes remedy scattered here and there but nothing that offered the whole story & a full, concise & easy to follow treatment method, which is what most of us need. 

Since publishing,  the response I received was simply  staggering & very inspiring.  This method was more than just a lucky fluke which just happened to work for me, No.. This herpes remedy actually worked & helped most of the people who applied and followed the instructions. 

I've received countless comments like the one's below:

 

Haven't had an outbreak since using your info

"Herpes has plagued me on and off for over 5 years. Thought I had tried every way to get rid of herpes until I read your book. I can't say if this will cure my herpes for sure but I haven't had an outbreak since using your info, coincidence?, not sure yet I'll keep you informed".
Thank You, Becca (Customer Comments)
