Synopsis:
When former undercover agent Tom Steele (Seagal) and his partner Manning (Austin) are assigned to dismantle a former prison, should oversee the arrival of two mysterious female prisoners. Before long, an elite force of mercenaries assault the prison in search of new arrivals. While the true identity of the women are revealed, Steele realizes he's caught in the middle of something much bigger than I had imagined.
