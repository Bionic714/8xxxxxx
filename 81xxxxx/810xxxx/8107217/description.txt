Album review of Electric Kazoo's contemporary folk/folktronic album: written by Andy Gesner president of Hip Video in New Jersey Hip Video

"There is nothing quite like Electric Kazoo: their sonic signature is a bold one, and their arrangement decisions are both imaginative and expressive. The songs on "Into the Great White Open," their confident new folk album, feature deftly-woven acoustic and electric guitar patterns, brilliant trumpet, rich viola, rubbery accordion, ghostly sitar, and a booming string bass. Percussion, too, is invariably creative: skittering snare augmented with occasional machine beats, congas, bongos and even the occasional knee slap. 

Electric Kazoo's melodies can lead listeners down strange and fascinating detours. In short, the spell cast by Electric Kazoo's music is a subtle one -- but it's a potent one, too.	

The album features philosophical lyrics -- speculating about the mysteries of life and death -- the bands literary turn has drawn comparisons to other formidably-intelligent songwriters, including Colin Meloy of the Decemberists, Emily Haines of Metric, Neil Finn of Crowded House, and Jonathan Meiburg of Shearwater."
