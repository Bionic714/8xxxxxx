There is nothing quite like Good Question: their sonic signature is a bold one, and their arrangement decisions are both imaginative and expressive. The songs on Safety Shackles, their confident new album, feature deftly-woven acoustic and electric guitar patterns, woodwinds, rich cello, rubbery didgeridoo, ghostly banjo, and twinkly celeste and glockenspiel. Percussion, too, is invariably creative: skittering snare augmented with occasional machine beats, bells, and even the occasional timpani.

"Take A Moment", the album's kick-off cut, is quintessentially Good Question: a gently infectious melody, an elliptical, engrossing acoustic guitar riff, atmospheric high strings and gorgeous cello, strong vocal harmonies, and Goebel's customary philosophical lyrics. He's a deep thinker -- one comfortable speculating about the mysteries of life and death -- and the singer's literary turn has drawn comparisons to other formidably-intelligent songwriters, including Colin Meloy of the Decemberists, Emily Haines of Metric, Neil Finn of Crowded House, and Jonathan Meiburg of Shearwater.
