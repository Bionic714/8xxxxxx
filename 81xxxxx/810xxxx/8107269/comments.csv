[V],TorrentTracts,2013-02-20T16:35Z,"TheFlyingTiger, with all due respect, if you're looking for a high bit rate recording, and if sound quality really means that much to you, I would hope you'd purchase the original disc to support the Artist and their families."
[V],TorrentTracts,2013-02-20T16:37Z,"Roro1979, are you referring to William Murphy's new 2013 ""God Chaser"" release?  If so, it's included in my latest (5th) bundle.  As for Tasha Cobbs, nothing has come my way yet for 2013."
[V],TorrentTracts,2013-02-20T16:38Z,"Clvnst, did you ever manage to get your problems resolved with this torrent?  I don't know what the issue was, but it sometimes helps to simply start over, saving the torrent in another directory on your computer."
