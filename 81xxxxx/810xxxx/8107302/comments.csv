,kewrabbish,2013-02-16T15:41Z,"This torrent does not work! When you done applying and installing the new patch you can't ever run skyrim again, how many times you uninstalling it, you cant run it. cuz it says unable to find ""ini"" file.
Thank me."

,dieskrad,2013-03-10T02:01Z,"Check that your Skyrim is on version 1.81.151.0.7 (or simply update 11), @kewrabbish."
,RavenousRaven,2013-03-15T04:25Z,Can you use this if you have the paid version of skyrim?
