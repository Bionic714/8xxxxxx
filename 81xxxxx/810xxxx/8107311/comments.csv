,chop007,2013-02-06T20:32Z,"This is a very powerful system tuning app. Make sure you take your time with setting it up and make sure you tell it what to do, don't let it go off first time in automatic cleaning mode. Otherwise this app is freakin awesome and will certainly improve your system."

,ironymon,2013-02-11T07:30Z,"From my past experience this is by far the best all in one, some others have better internet boosters that tweak some settings from windows default or do something a bit better but this is the best, especially the virus scanner that gets shit others don't, that was in 2009, this software can also break your windows if used improperly."

,chop007,2013-03-21T20:18Z,"Dropped this to use Tuneup, man, I wish Sytem Mechanic was still crackable but Tuneup's program disabler is unique and very helpfull because every software designer just keeps their shit running on your pc even when it's services are not needed. Man I miss System Mechanic."
