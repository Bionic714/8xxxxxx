I don't understand your problem? It's not only the folders its a .rar archive. Full size on my PC is about 1,1GB. I tested it of course and worked very well on my iPad :)"
,V1RotateV2,2013-02-07T21:51Z,"@airbusflyer

Didn't know it was compressed. Thanks a lot =)"
,V1RotateV2,2013-02-07T21:52Z,"For those who are not able to make it work directly, such me:

I've been able to make run 1303 FULLY, VFR-enabled, under IOS 6.1 and app v2.0, using Diskaid v5.45!

- Erase JEPP FD application and download it from APPLE store.
- Open it once, without having updated anything.
- Close it completely (with X)
- Copy only TermCharts from 1303.
- Erase 'Enroute' Charts folder (whatever you find in Documents)
- Copy 'Enroute' Charts folder from 1213.
- Copy OVER PREVIOUS FOLDER, Enroute Charts from 1303.
- If you want to enable VFR Terminal Charts, create your own airportlist.bin file (need jepp.exe application and JeppView for Windows)
- Overwrite the older airportlist.bin with newer one in TermCharts
- Copy FROM ""C:ProgramData/Jeppesen/Common/TerminalCharts"" TO your IPAD folder ""JeppFD/Documents/data/TermCharts""
theese files: vfrcharts.bin, vfrchrts.dbf, vfrntms.dbf and vfrntms.dbt.

* Note 1: vfrcharts.bin must be writen in LOWERCASE letters, NOT IN CAPITALS.
* Note 2: Google to find jepp.exe application and it's manual.

Voila! FULL JeppFD ;-) "
,rdz777,2013-02-09T14:32Z,I think I know how to use google to search but I'm not lucky to find jeep.exe. Any ideas where to look :)

,alienstrikes,2013-02-13T21:19Z,"Thanks a lot airbusflyer. Just a question, I have followed your instructions and charts appears in JeppFD (perfect!) but in enroute section I cannot see any information (airways, VORs, etc), only the map. Any ideas?. Regards."

,B737CL,2013-02-16T10:26Z,"Hello Everyone!!! Its like a week that im trying to run it on the Ipad with the 6.0.1.... I did manage to run all airport and so but no ENROUTE charts at all!

I started from a wrong torrent which was the 1216 than 1218 than 1220....

I finally saw this 1303!!! 

I would like you guys to answer to this question please....

Any of you can put the right order to follow please so we can make a MASTER!! Because is getting very hard to follow the steps specially to those like me that fell and are a bit bad in using MAC or PC!!

Please Please HELP HELP HELP ...---... thanks"
,jeromepp,2013-02-16T17:11Z,"Hi everyone,
I think there is a problem. I reinstalled everything from 1213 as mentionned by V1RotateV2, but I can't get the Enroute part. I even tried to load 1213 only!
Does somone succeded (I run Ios 6.1 (10B141)
Best"
,jeromepp,2013-02-16T22:05Z,"So finally I got it.
In the last versions (1302,1303,1304) it misses 4 files:
* Enroute/db_a/store/appedoc_store_1.lock
* Enroute/db_a/store/appenr_store_1.lock
* Enroute/db_b/store/appedoc_store_1.lock
* Enroute/db_b/store/appenr_store_1.lock
They were not in my 1213 version, but it was in my 1301.
Just be sure you have these 4 files, and it works like a charm!
Thanks"
,B737CL,2013-02-17T06:44Z,"jeromepp....Please kindly can you provide a torrent for those file....
