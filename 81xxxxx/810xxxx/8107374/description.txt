IDW Publishing and DC Comics are proud to present the greatest tale of the 23rd century! Or is that the 31st century? As you'll see here, it's both. Eisner-nominated writer Chris Roberson and Star Trek and Legionnaires veteran artist Jeffrey Moy partner up to bring you the most bizarre partnership of any century! In this first issue, a group of Legionnaires end up lost in the 23rd century, but it's a universe that isn't familiar to either the Legion or the crew of the USS Enterprise!
