Now it's a singled file with no type!"
,mrstark94,2013-02-06T02:49Z,"@nomoreAVI Sorry about that. Someone edited the torrent and my computer was unable to read it after, so it was stuck at 54.4%. I tried doing a Re-check to see if Bit Torrent read the files but it did not and so I downloaded Utorrent to do it but it didn't work either. So I created another torrent file using Utorrent instead of BitTorrent and it reads it now! I'm currently trying to keep my laptop and desktop running simultaneously to make sure the entire file gets delivered. It's been a real pain in the ass for me, but I'm trying. Once again, someone else ruined the torrent! Not me. I made the mistake of not creating it with the proper properties to keep it's order. "
