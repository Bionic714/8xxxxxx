Richard III The King in the Car Park
When a skeleton was reported found under a Leicester council car park in September 2012, the news broke around the world. Could it be the remains, lost for 500 years, of England's most infamous king? In a world exclusive, Channel 4 has the full inside story of the hunt for Richard III. The discovery of the body and the battery of scientific tests to establish its identity have been carried out in complete secrecy, with no footage of them seen by anyone but the investigating team. But this programme - made by the only team allowed to follow the scientists - tells every step, twist and turn of the story. It unveils a brand new facial reconstruction made from the skull and - in scenes shot just hours before broadcast - reveals the results of the final tests that confirm or deny the body's identity.
