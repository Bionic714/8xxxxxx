   Story:
       In this Frenco-Italian gangster parody,a shop keeper on his way to 
       an Italian holiday suffers a crash which totals his car. 
       The culprit can only compensate his ruined trip
       by driving an American friends car from Napels to Bordeaux,
       but as it happens to be filled with such contraband as stolen money,
       jewelry and drugs, the involuntary and unwitting companions in crime
       soon attract all but recreational attention from the "milieu".
