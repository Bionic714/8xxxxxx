Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site :: On the Tuesday, February 5 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex runs down his encounter with anti-Second Amendment advocate and CNN host Piers Morgan last night in Katy, Texas, and talks with Jeremy Alcede, the owner of Tactical Firearms. Morgan aired his show live from Tactical Firearms where he attempted to portray himself as a reasonable critic of firearms and took heat from rocker Ted Nugent. 

Alex also talks about a memo released by the Justice Department claiming it is legal to kill Americans with drones.

Note: as is now standard practice, when Alex has a guest on the show who is a partner in his Youngevity supplement marketing sites [infowarsteam.com and infowarshealth.com], that guest is not mentioned in the official show description. Today during most of hour 2 and the first segment of hour 3, Alex's guest is naturopath Dr. Peter Glidden [http://youngevity.com/company/about-scientific/].
