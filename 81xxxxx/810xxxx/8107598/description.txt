This series is based on a story of Turkish author Vedat Turkali. 
The series is a very touching story of an eye- catching, beautiful girl, Fatmagul, who has no family 
but his too-naive older brother. 
Unfortunately, the story starts when Fatmagul gets raped by 4 men. 3 of these men are spoilt rich kids
and the other is a local boy, Kerim. 
The law, stupidly enough, forgives the act of rape if one of the rapers marries with the victim. 
So, the rich kids get rid of their crime by persuading Kerim to marry Fatmagul. 
After the two marry, the trio walks free and leave the town. 
Kerim gets frustrated, because he is the one who's left with a wife he does not want. 
He beats Fatmag√ºl, who miscarries a baby because of this. 
But Fatmagul has nowhere to go, no one to trust, and she has no option but accept and love her husband. 
This was the story of how two people, desperate in their own ways, bound together and start 
loving each other, a story built on despair and hopelessness.
