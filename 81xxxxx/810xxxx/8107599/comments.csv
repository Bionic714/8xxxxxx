,agenthack,2013-02-16T05:16Z,"i just finished dowloading dvd 4.. but when i played it,the dvd menu says #3 back and 6 pack... hmmm im confused...on the book > it is pictured #4 back and 6 pack...is the book wrong?"
,wevy,2013-02-16T05:24Z,it is number 4 i may of miss labeled the iso by mistake sorry bout that
,wevy,2013-02-16T05:28Z,the dvds are all there just possibly miss labeled the iso number on a few but all the dvds are there i just checked now
,wevy,2013-02-16T05:49Z,its a miss print i just played the original and it said 3 as well but its actually 4 it shows it as 4 in the dvd holder they came in but the printing on the dvd is 3 as well as the dvd menu
,agenthack,2013-02-16T07:13Z,cool..thanks..i really appreciate this...keep up the good work.. ;-)
,wevy,2013-02-16T07:34Z,no problem im still seeding it at this moment enjoy the asylum 2 i know i am :)
,agenthack,2013-02-17T05:30Z,"wevy - i just finished downloading power legs disc 3.... on the dvd menu it says ""3"" power legs / ab shredder.. which is correct..but shaun t is holding a dumble on the dvd menu instead of having a band on his ankle. > http://paulgfarmer.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/003-300x261.jpg 

i dont know if its me or the iso's... as i mentioned earlier..disc 4 back & 6 pack > the dvd menu of  disc 4 iso have the dvd 3 power legs menu...is it really like that? or my download is corrupted?"
,agenthack,2013-02-17T05:40Z,"im downloading #2 iso now...i hope the dvd menu is right..the dvd menu of ths iso #3 have the menu of iso #2..i think iso's 2,3 and 4 menus are mixed up... i got your torrent file in kat i wonder if that is the same with this one...

the hash info are different though.."
,wevy,2013-02-17T07:42Z,"that is correct i checked the original and it has him holding a dumbbell on #3 disc 4 is suppose to be back and six pack thats what it shows on the dvd booklet but when i just played 3-4 they both have the number 3 on them and back and 6 pack has the picture of power legs and ab shredder on the dvd menu and upper elite has the dvd menu picture of back and six pack. it is 2-4 where the dvd menu pics are not what there suppose to be 2 has the picture of back and 6 pack, power legs has the picture of upper elite  and uper elite has the pic of back and six pack sorry for the confusion bout it your files are not corrupt dont worry it was beachbodys doing on this and i ordered it from team beachbody"
,agenthack,2013-02-17T12:08Z,"oh ok... got it... i dont know why beachbody did that... that is pretty confusing...i thought it has something to do with doing the iso's...but it is really like that. did some research on utube..upper elite dvd 2 with the dvd menu of dvd 4 (according to the book) lol... anyways, we cant do anything about it..that is how they did it..but i just dont understand why..lol... thank you really for this! two thumbs up for this great UL..."
,wevy,2013-02-18T00:31Z,you are welcome anytime i wanted to spread the love 
,wevy,2013-02-18T01:06Z,hope you enjoy the program :)
,wevy,2013-02-20T23:17Z,i tweeted carl daikeler and beachbody sent me the correct version of discs 2-4 where the menu pictures match up correct @agenthack 
,agenthack,2013-02-24T08:01Z,"nice! will you be uploading the correct iso's? please upload if you have time..that would be great...thanks!
"
,agenthack,2013-02-24T08:06Z,"i wonder why they have wrong dvd menus... that's crazy..i thought i downloaded dvd 3 twice...lol...but anyways, thats good that you'll have a replacement for dvd's 2-4...cant wait for the UL..thanks wevy!"
,wevy,2013-02-25T03:49Z,ill defineatly upload the new ones
,agenthack,2013-02-25T09:56Z,nice! can you please upload them individualy? thanks ;-)
,wevy,2013-02-25T22:46Z,uploaded them individually may take a while to seed though
,agenthack,2013-02-26T03:22Z,cool! DL'ng them now... thanks for this and thanks for seeding...
,wevy,2013-02-26T04:20Z,No problem anytime :)
,agenthack,2013-02-26T13:58Z,i was wondering if you gonna change the 2-4 iso on this torrent...is that possible?i was trying to dl 2 3 4 individualy and im just getting 6kb dl speed..and there is only 1 seeder..with this torrent its much faster and there are 19 seeders..which is good...but im not sure if 2 3 4 iso still have the same dvd menus..
,wevy,2013-02-26T15:51Z,"I been seeding the three all at once so that could be why its slow give it that im the only seeder at the moment, and I don't think its possible to change the torrent after uploading it and 2-4 the ones I uploaded individually are the ones with the right dvd menus plz be patient"
,wevy,2013-02-26T15:56Z,that is the draw back of me uploading them individually is that it slows down the upload speed for all three im averaging 40kbs upload compared to if I uploaded them all in one file at 200kbs
,wevy,2013-02-26T16:17Z,If I would of uploaded them as a whole you still could of downloaded them individually by the priority settings and setting the two not to download n once the one your downloading is done you could of clicked on one of the others that's not done and in the priority setting click on download and you could download them individually like that from a whole set of isos hope this helps :)
,agenthack,2013-02-26T18:32Z,"sounds good to me.. why i didnt think of that.. lol...if that makes dl'ng faster then i go for that...uploading 2-4 in 1 torrent...and then i'll just dl them individualy...thats actualy what i did in dl'ng this torrent...anyway,whatever you think is good...thank you..two thumbs up.."
,wevy,2013-02-26T19:48Z,Ill re upload them as one torrent to speed up downloading for you
,agenthack,2013-02-27T02:26Z,"great! i appreciate it ;-)

i'll DL them now...tnx"
,wevy,2013-02-27T02:35Z,yup no prob im trying to super seed it so I can get the seeds up since im the only seeder at the moment
,JunkyardJord,2013-03-07T02:41Z,"absolutely amazing torrent, thanks!

will seed for a long time!"
,wevy,2013-03-07T22:55Z,no problem
,L33chmaster,2013-05-09T08:24Z,"so, is this the DVD RIP version or original full version? though almost 20 GB sounds pretty legit but the earlier versions are of 50GB so this is just to confirm. Also another request. can you please upload the full copy of Bodybeast. The one that is shared here is only 9GB DVD rip."
