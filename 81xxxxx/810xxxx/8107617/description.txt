                              Product Description
=============================================================================

13 years after its release, "Communication" still lingers in our minds. And that's exactly why its been given an upgrade. Gathering four gifted producers, each giving "Communication" its new feel and sound, is the Communication Part 3 remix pack.
 From the razorsharp, techy trance vibe of John Askew to the electrifying and housy Tomas Heredia version. If you're looking for big-room with a mind-blowing break, try the Faruk Sabanci remix, and last but not least, there's the uplifting and orchestral touch of James Dymond. Four new versions to blow you away. Again!
