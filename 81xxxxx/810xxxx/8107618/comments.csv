Thanks for the BOTW - beautiful sound on this rip.

Hey, I couldn't help notice that the waveforms in
AA3 look exactly the same as the torrent I got
in 2009:  BOTW - Classic Records 180g (Quiex SV-P) / Columbia KCS 9914."

Kind of makes you wonder why you're uploading anything in the first place.

Thanks for your comment."
,oldiesguy,2013-02-19T05:12Z,"Hi Politux,

I think it's great that you guys are uploading vinyl - I love it.

But unless you state otherwise, there could be an implication 
that you are doing the ripping too. It's ok if you got the rips 
from somewhere else, I would just be a little more definitive.  

I didn't mean to sound complaining. I did say it was a
beautiful rip, 180g etc. In fact, I've left hundreds and
hundreds of positive comments on TPB and the Demon,
including a few of your rips, Politux.

You know the hi-res vinyl guys - they want to know the
equipment, the vinyl dead wax, the groove count, etc. So
if you have that info, and the original ripper, I would 
just include it in the description too.  If you don't know
who ripped it, just say you snagged it from another
site.

[V],politux,2013-02-19T15:10Z,"Fair enough mate, you've got some good points.  And I know people who are into vinyl care about the details and rip info.  Generally when I share things I don't like to reveal where it came from. 

I'm not claiming everything I upload is a personal rip.  However, the things I upload are not available on TPB and I want to share with as wide an audience as possible.

Unless otherwise stated just assume the source is the web.  The reason I get frustrated sometimes is that I'm spending a lot of time uploading and it feels like a slap in the face when people who are getting free stuff and have never uploaded anything complain.  

I'm not speaking about you, oldiesguy, because you're right you did compliment the quality of the rip and that's appreciated.  Either way enjoy the tunes. :)"
