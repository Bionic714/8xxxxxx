,stegman,2013-02-06T04:39Z,"You're most welcome.

Funny you picked this particular torrent (10/27) to say - ""keep 'em coming"", lol.
Ithaca was a final show I planned to upload. 
I covered what I thought were the best and most important moments of 2012 tour, 
from what I have - 24 concerts in total.

So unless someone comes up with a request of some particular date, (that I happen to have)
I think it's time for me to say: ""T-t-t-that's All, Folks!"""
,mdavis75,2013-02-08T23:49Z,"Thank you for the ups!! These mule shows have been like little rays of sunshine in the middle of deep winter cold. If you've got the time and the motivation, putting up the rest of what you've got would not go unappreciated! Either way, a great big thank you headed out in your direction!"
[V],smbdownload,2013-02-09T04:26Z,I'll second that request - if you find the time - thanks again for sharing brother ~ peace
,stegman,2013-02-10T01:49Z,"Alright, let's keep on going then.

I'll upload last 3 Fall shows they did 
before New Years concerts (Three Kings)
and then I'll start chronologically upping Summer and Fall shows from 2012 tour."
