""All ads have been removed"" translates into nothing less than issues are now incomplete. While some look at ads in printed media the same as commercials in video media, they are not the same and should be left intact for the sake completeness. If for no other reason than to retain full page counts so people aren't left wondering what is missing when they notice that page such-n-such isn't there. "

scene groups have been ripping out ads forever.

the only comics i like the ads in are vintage comics because they had charm, they where part of the book so-to-speak.  also, who counts ads in page counts anyway????  that's like counting the opening trailers in the run-time of a movie, or commercials in the run-time of a television show.

i'd understand if these where physical books, but if you want ads left in digital comics have fun trudging through the selections available for c2c scans."
