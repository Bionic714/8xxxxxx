The Peddlers were labeled - somewhat unfairly - as a middle of the road outfit, possibly because Roy Phillips Blues-drenched voice and the trio's line-up came off with a sophisticated jazz edge. Also their 1968 CBS album Three In A Cell was for many years a charity shop staple, suggesting that its popularity at the time had been followed by exile into the world of the unfashionable. But it was Suite London which showcased a style of atmospherics on the slow tracks that saw their version of Alan Lerner's "On A Clear Day" being sampled by freak funk outfit and London club pioneers Sandals for their 1992 single "Nothing". However it was the strange combination of The Peddlers with The London Philharmonic Orchestra, recorded as their final album with the band's original line-up, that was the true find.
