I still would recommend people to buy the courses that they find important. For example I bought the chemistry courses because I really needed them and so I take part in ensuring that we can continue getting these great tutors.

Still I don't actually have need for most of these courses but I download them just to have the collection and cause they're interesting to watch.

Still thanks for upload!"

Thanks for sharing! If possible, can you fix #23; content is Section 23- Chebyshev’s Theorem_2.FLV (duplicate of 22) and should be Sect 23: Quartiles of Data.
Thanks!"
