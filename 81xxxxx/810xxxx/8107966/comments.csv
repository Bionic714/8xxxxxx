,Soegunau,2013-02-10T20:32Z,"gabilcardoso, if you can just post the links to the podcasts moonstar can probably just rip them from vimeo.
You need to seed from the start on the torrents, I downloaded it pretty early, but since you were not seeding in the beginning no one else could download them."
,themismatch,2013-02-12T08:20Z,"Soegunau, I think they're on SoundCloud and set to private.

Week 40 is up: pastebin(.)com/uKG4HGpS"
,Demonsniperhd,2013-02-12T23:12Z,themismatch  Thank you for posting all these links and moonstar14 thank you for uploading to TPB. But I have one question how do you get these pastebin links?  
,themismatch,2013-02-13T04:50Z,"Demonsniperhd, I have access to a Project Go account. 

Here's how I do it: pastebin(.)com/tM26kPfA"
,zanbasse,2013-02-27T21:52Z,@themismatch can you try to do a similar thing for podcasts? Try copying and pasting the entire source-code of the page that contains the podcasts in a pastebin. It would be much appreciated.
,zanbasse,2013-02-27T21:55Z,"@themismatch can you try doing a similar thing for the podcasts? Try searching for ""soundcloud"" instead of ""vimeo"" on a page that contains podcasts, if nothing pops up, try copying and pasting the source-code of the page with podcasts in a pastebin. It would be much appreciated."
