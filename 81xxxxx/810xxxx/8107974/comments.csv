In A/B'ing this with the 1998 JVC/XRCD release of the record I discovered that the the JVC version of the two takes of ""But Not For Me"" mixed up.  While both records show take 2 as track 5 and take 1 as track 7, the JVC has take 1 first. Take 1 is the slower version.

While the XRCD is cleaner and brighter, I think I like this vinyl version better with the cymbals a little more subdued.  It's very nice, thanks."
