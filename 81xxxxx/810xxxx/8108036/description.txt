Like jeggings for men and the upcoming reboot of ΓÇ£ALF,ΓÇ¥ gallows-humored, apocalypse-minded Canadian singer-songwriters are, apparently, an idea whose time has come.

Self-described ΓÇ£dissident countryΓÇ¥ singer Corb Lund has been nibbling at the margins of success since his 1995 debut; his seventh and latest studio disc, ΓÇ£Cabin Fever,ΓÇ¥ feels like a breakthrough at last. Written Bon Iver-style in a backwoods cabin outside of Edmonton, Canada, and recorded live-to-tape with his band, the HurtinΓÇÖ Albertans, ΓÇ£Cabin FeverΓÇ¥ is a doozy ΓÇö a soft-hearted, ice-pick-eyed album that toggles between old-school honky-tonk and rambling, misfit folk.

Opening track ΓÇ£GettinΓÇÖ Down on the MountainΓÇ¥ offers a guide to survival when the petrol runs out (ΓÇ£I think I see a rip in the social fabricΓÇë/ Brother, can you pass the ammo?ΓÇ¥) and makes a case for Lund as the spiritual offspring of Molly Ivins and Hayes Carll.

The latter shows up in human form on ΓÇ£Bible on the Dash,ΓÇ¥ about a touring band that relies on a purloined copy of the Good Book to get out of speeding tickets (ΓÇ£My foot is heavy with redemptionΓÇ¥) and worse.

Lund is a revelation, laconic and scary smart, with a devilΓÇÖs eye for details. ΓÇ£Cabin FeverΓÇ¥ flags only occasionally. Even the pulpy ΓÇ£The Gothest Girl I CanΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£Priceless Antique Pistol Shoots Startled OwnerΓÇ¥ (ΓÇ£Despite my injuries good sirΓÇë/ I cannot lieΓÇë/ It remains an elegant and stylish way to dieΓÇ¥), with its Olympic-caliber yodeling, canΓÇÖt live up to the promise of their titles.
