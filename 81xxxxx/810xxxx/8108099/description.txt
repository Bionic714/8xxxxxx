NOTE: I suggest downloading VLC Media Player to watch this release.  You can download it here:

A few important and simple keyboard shortcuts for VLC are:

Double click: Fullscreen
Spacebar: Play/Pause
V key: Enable/Disable/Change Subtitles.
G/H key: Subtitle Delay (-50ms/+50ms per tap)
J/K key: Audio Delay (-50ms/+50ms per tap

NOTE: CLUE for some reason includes NO SUBTITLES with their releases which is riduculous, especially with there being non-English parts.  So, I used Subtitle Edit to extract the Subtitles from the 720p BluRay DEMAND release.  I then renamed them so they would be on by default and in sync with the CLUE release.

NOTE: Subtitles are on by default for each episode.  Episodes 1, 2, 4, 5, and 10 contain Dothraki, and therefore English Subtitles for DOTHRAKI are on by Default.  If you wish to have English Subtitles for EVERYTHING for these episodes, simply tap the V key once.  In Episodes 3, 6, 7, 8, and 9, English Subtitles for EVERYTHING are on by default.  If you would like no subtitles on in these episodes, simply tap the V key once.

NOTE: Three samples are included for your viewing pleasure.

NOTE: I do not have constant Internet access, so this upload may take a few days.  Please be patient!
