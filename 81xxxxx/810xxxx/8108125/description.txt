-Betty.Whites.2nd.Annual.90th.Birthday-A.Tribute.to.Americas.Golden.Girl.720p.HDTV.x264-BAJSKORV
2013.02.05

Reality CRF used... though would have been nice to be able to usea better CRF since it 
compresses so well. Oh well, stupid rules. 

Seven-time Emmy Award winner Betty White will be celebrating her 91st birthday in style as 
a star-studded line up of special guests pays tribute to one of the world's most beloved 
entertainers. Blake Shelton, Bill Cosby, Whoopi Goldberg, Sean Hayes, Rico Rodriguez, Lily 
Tomlin and Sarah Silverman will honor America's comedy sweetheart, along with Bill 
Clinton, the 42nd President of the United States. Also on hand to deliver birthday wishes 
will be Vicki Lawrence --reprising her popular title role from "Mama's Family" -- Katie 
Couric and White's "Hot in Cleveland" co-stars "Valerie Bertinelli, Jane Leeves and Wendie 
Malick, as well as Zachary Levi, Larry King and Kate Flannery. The evening will include 
special performances including Shelton singing a tailor-made musical number for the 
birthday girl, as well as comedy and clips that perfectly capture the irreverent tone, 
spirit and comedic flair that are the hallmark of White's extraordinary career.
