,johnboss,2013-02-06T19:59Z,"@steaz55

What kind of loser bothers to search for a torrent of a show he thinks sucks and then even cares enough to comment on it. The Joke is on you douchebag."

,biggerisbetter34,2013-02-07T05:13Z,"@johnboss

Actually, I saw this show once and steaz55 reminded me why I haven't downloaded it since. Thanks. It does suck. All the characters are annoying. I hope there is a break-in and they are murdered. No. Raped and then murdered. But just the men. That would be wrong otherwise."
,thebeav111,2013-02-07T11:32Z,"@johnboss meh, I could see me searching top seeded TV shows, seeing one I hate, being drunk or something, and clicking on it to troll...  lol

@biggerisbetter LOL"
,SarahBaby,2013-02-10T23:58Z,"lol well i agree with johnboss, why would you people go on a torrent of a show they dont like and have the effort to comment on it, haha why click on something you dont like, i dont click on shit i dont like i keep scrolling down like a normal person "

,pksource,2013-02-23T22:19Z,"Great episode, nice plot so far. Storyline is intelligent and i wouldn't change it even a bit. Quality - A10 V10. I usually watch everything at film.plotar.org	because they always have HD but they don't have tv shows so having TPB for TVshows is great, thnx!"
