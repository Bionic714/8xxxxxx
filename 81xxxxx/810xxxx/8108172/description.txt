"Take Me Home, Country Roads"

George is given the responsibility of 
watching Tansy's (guest star Mircea Monroe) 
most prized possession, her dog, but panics 
when the dog goes missing. Wade starts to 
feel frustrated by the lack of alone time 
with Zoe, especially when she is focused more 
on not losing her good status in the town to 
a new doctor, Jonah (guest star Travis Van 
Winkle), who also happens to be Brick's 
nephew. Brick is ready to let the town know 
about his relationship with Shelby (guest 
star Laura Bell Bundy), but Lemon and 
Magnolia (guest star Claudia Lee) are doing 
everything they can to get rid of her. 
Meanwhile, Lavon wants to take a chance on a 
new relationship, but first has to clear the 
air with one person.
