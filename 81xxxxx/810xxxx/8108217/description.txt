Spiro are an engaging, experimental acoustic band from Bristol who defy categorisation. They play violin, mandolin, accordion, guitar and cello, make use of traditional English melodies in many of their intricate compositions, but are definitely not a conventional folk band. The traditional influences are "enmeshed" (one of their favourite words) into an elaborate, atmospheric or quietly stirring rhythmic style that makes use of the repeated phrases and patterns of systems music ΓÇô though they never stay on one riff for long. There is no improvisation and no solo work; each piece has been meticulously worked out in advance, with melodies and riffs juggled between the different instruments. On tracks such as the opening Yellow Noise, it sounds as if there are more than four musicians at work, but the album was recorded live, with no overdubs. Spiro are that rarity: true English originals.
