,Hey-you,2013-03-15T08:49Z,"Tried replacing skins i downloaded for the players. Tried replacing the gun skins too. What made me fed up is some sort of ""game-user"" or ""game-admin"" block me from changing skins. Can't use cheats too. Umad?"

???"
,Hey-you,2013-03-17T10:38Z,"Nice game dude. The problems are:
when I tried to change the skins of the player models, i got consistency error ""Server is enforcing file consistency for modelsplayer........""
The same goes to weapon skins. I tried to type the command ""sv consistency 0"" as told by some gamers on the internet but nothing happen. Many of the commands like ""restart"" ""sv cheat 1"" are unusable in the console. Have any idea?"
[T],bruss.aka.durka9,2013-03-17T15:56Z,"to Hey-you
On server and client (botch) type in console: sv_pure 0"

Run updater."
,wop_wop,2013-04-17T19:39Z,"Playing this for few weeks, worked perfectly, and when i udated this today, it didnt launch saying ""ProcName value not found on commandline or in rev.ini. Please edit the file"" what the hell do i do now?"
[T],bruss.aka.durka9,2013-04-17T22:16Z,"to wop_wop

If you are updating from previous CS:S version, you must add to rev.ini (placed in game dir) strings:

[Loader]
ProcName = hl2.exe -steam -game cstrike -appid 240 -novid

And replace this string:

SteamDll = ./bin/Steam/Steam.dll

To this:

SteamDll = ./Steam/Steam.dll

Then off antivirus and run updater. Enjoy.
Or you can download new generation: http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8380094"
,kelvin_andrade,2013-04-27T18:54Z,"Hey man, thanks for the torrent, it's ALMOST perfect, except for one thing:

I can't get to install any skins I downloaded. When I open the game it's just the original/default skins, and in console it's written:

ForceModelBounds no longer supported.  (*skin file name*)

ForceSimpleMaterial no longer supported.  (*skin file name*)

I installed weapons, hands, CT & T skins."
[T],bruss.aka.durka9,2013-04-28T06:14Z,"to kelvin_andrade
You must read: /cstrike/custom/readme.txt"
