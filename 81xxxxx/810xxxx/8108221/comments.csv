Thanks! That's the whole idea I had in mind. 7-zip using the correct settings beats RAR and ZIP to shreds. With a much smaller filesize, you save time and bandwidth."

,WDoubleYouW,2013-02-06T23:31Z,"@ramonic @ramonic @ramonic
I didn't stutter when I chose my username, so you probably don't need to stutter your comments ;)

When you first are going to Solstheim, you'll be on a boat and sail into harbor, where you'll dock. Screen will turn black, and you'll reappear on the ship, and then you'll be able to move. Just wait, and you should be fine. At any rate, this is Bugthesda we're talking about, so if there is a bug, simply reload your previous autosave and try again."

,Blackblack20,2013-02-07T02:03Z,"@ramonic,
I didn't try this yet, but got fix from the other site that you have to try persuade Gjalund to take you to Solstheim again and if it doesn't work, try it again, or use ""unofficial dragonborn patch"". Some mods are also known can cause conflict.

@bernikjk
Try to re-arrange your data list if you have other mods installed. Make sure dlcs (dg, db, hf) are the first (2nd if you have optional hd dlc) in load order."
,misconceptionoftime,2013-02-07T02:26Z,"
For years I've looked for that one torrent that would be so good that it would make me register to write a comment defending it. 
I have dealt with so many skyrim issues in the past few months, and even worse I'm a mac user.
So it was a lot of wrapping/porting and using VMware fusion, blah blah blah it was a nightmare!

Finally, all I can say to all of you that are having problems is this :

(MAC USERS)

1.Back up your saves and your Skyrim folder, and do a fresh install of a Skyrim Dawnguard Wrapper found here http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7527231/Elder_Scrolls_V_-_Skyrim_Dawnguard_(by_lasteno).dmg

2. Download the skyrim 1.8 update for PC, the latest razor skyrim torrent for PC, VMWare Fusion 5, and windows XP.

3. Install VMware, Windows XP, and inside your small virtual machine install the razor pc skyrim, and then open up the 1.8 update 

4. You can go ahead and install Nexus Mod Manager, install the mods you like, and use BOSS to arrange them properly. Then..

5. Go to view under VMware in your taskbar (mac), use Unity, and drag and drop your skyrim data folder from your VM to your Dawnguard folder that you freshly installed on your hard drive. 

6. Now your Skyrim wrapper is fully updated and modded, fresh, and ready to play. Just drag and drop the Dragonborn esm and bsa files, and you're good to go. But I recommend step 7.

7. Download the Skyrim Unofficial Patch, Dawnguard Unofficial Patch, and recently last night the Dragonborn Unofficial patch was added to the skyrim nexus. I have seen a huge boost of stability to my game, everything works fine, no crashes, and best of all I'm exploring Morrowind :) 


PC users

I hate that life is so easy for you guys on this topic but oh well.

1. Fresh install of Skyrim
2. Update to 1.8
3. Fresh mods
4. Dragonborn update
5. Play

,lemonncurry,2013-02-08T15:24Z,"@misconceptionoftime: I’m a mac user too, so I’m trying to make it work according to your steps. I backed up my whole Skyrim folder, but I don’t know how to transfer my saved progress into this new Dawnguard wrapper? I currently have the Cider wrapper and I don’t know where the saved games are."

,myyyk,2013-02-19T05:44Z,would this work perfectly if i only installed the dawnguard dlc that you've uploaded? or do i need to install other updates or versions? thanks in advance :D
,WDoubleYouW,2013-02-19T06:38Z,"@myyyk
Dawnguard requires Skyrim updated to version 1.6.90.0.6 (update 9) or later.

Hearthfire requires Skyrim updated to version 1.7.7.0.6 (update 10) or later.

Dragonborn requires Skyrim updated to version 1.8.151.0.7 (update 11) or later.

Each DLC is independent of each other."
,DrestMcLelan,2013-02-21T08:11Z,Awsome man love the fact that you didnt put any other unneeded crap in it. i didn't have to do a fresh install of skyrim or reactivate any mods it worked amazingly love this game created an account just so i can comment. Thank you so for for this it has made my night.
,DrestMcLelan,2013-02-21T08:13Z,I love this. Created an account to tell you awsome work and no unneeded crap gotta love it
,slick1190,2013-02-23T07:36Z,"I also created a pirate bay account to thank you for simple files and a simple explanation/details pane, other ones are definitely a pain! THANK U SO MUCH! =)

The.Elder.Scrolls.V.Skyrim. Dragonborn.Addon.DLC-RELOADED came with a virus popup (which people say are safe) but still provided me with a tesv.exe error 0xc0000022 upon loading skyrim from a desktop shortcut, as well as skse desktop shortcut, as well as sbw (simple borderless window) desktop shortcut.

Same error for all.

This saved me sooooo much hassle i had to start over and over with a vanilla (clean) skyrim install to get skyrim to work again , though i didnt try to just de-activate or uninstall dragonborn stuff, which i should have tried first, thanks a thousand times! =)

Oh and for a plus you talk to your commentors.... wow completely blown away. hello =) im putting you in my favorites. btw do you use mods? im in the process of learning and got alot of free time been reading up on things (about 300 pages) in the past 4 days or so, need to find some fellow modders and see what mods they got working together, if you reply to this i will get back to it within a day or 2"
,WDoubleYouW,2013-02-23T13:19Z,"@slick1190
Glad you like. I too am a little suspicious of the new steam dll in the RELOADED release. Seems odd that we should downgrade to a crack that is labeled a virus when we already have a crack working that isn't labeled a virus.

,jtech314,2013-02-23T20:20Z,"Hey double, I followed all the steps and got my client to 1.8, dropped both of files into my data folder but still no second boat in Windhelm harbor. I'm not sure how I check it in the launcher because the skse tool I used to update just launches the game. Any suggestions?"
,WDoubleYouW,2013-02-23T21:16Z,"@jtech314
I use skse too. In your main Skyrim directory you have SkyrimLauncher.exe. That is the launcher. Double-Click it, goto Data, and check Dragonborn.esm in the Launcher. That's it.

Also, you must have completed your first visit to the Greybeards before the cultists attack you."
,__ZOOM__,2013-02-25T17:58Z,"Hi,

I have just copied both files to data folder but i can still not see them in ""Data Files"". I can see my old Dawnguard.esm but not the new Dragonborn.esm.

Im on Skyrim version 1.8.151.0.7 and playing at level 55

What to do?"
,WDoubleYouW,2013-02-25T18:25Z,"I've never had that problem, but try this:

1. Go to users(your user account)AppDataLocalSkyrim

,weltall2,2013-02-28T09:16Z,"Thank you very much for this Double. It works like a charm. Up to this point where I read the comments on here I was wondering why DLC would work for me even without installers and without me choosing them from the launcher. I just realized that I have been activating through the Nexus Mod Manager that I use, all along. 

I suggest to all the people that have problems and even the ones that do not, to visit the Dkyrim nexus mods and download the manager from there. For the ones that do not care for mods, I suggest at least downloading the unofficial patches that are found on the site."

I saw a similar bug where he gets the dragon soul, but can't heal to max because of massive damage taken, so he stays in the same condition, which could be avoided by holding the damage input a bit, but this doesn't work with me , since he can't absorb any dragon souls at all.

,tylerchase7,2013-03-24T11:28Z,"Hey I have a problem.
When I start Skyrim, I cannot select the Data Files option, it's grayed out.
Any information on how to fix it?"
,WDoubleYouW,2013-03-26T03:14Z,"@tylerchase7

Go to your Documents folder. Enter the directory called ""My Games."" Then go into Skyrim. Now open the SkyrimPrefs.ini file with a text editor (e.g. Notepad). Press CTRL+F and search for [Launcher]. It will probably say something like this, albeit it might not have a launcher section at all:

[Launcher]
bShowAllResolutions=1
uLastAspectRatio=3

Add a new line to it which says:
bEnableFileSelection=1

It should now something like this:
[Launcher]
bEnableFileSelection=1
bShowAllResolutions=1
uLastAspectRatio=3

Save it. Reload the Skyrim Launcher and you should now be able to select the DLCs you want."
,darkdays135,2013-03-31T20:28Z,"@WDoubleYouW

I have the same problem with the Data Files on the skyrim launcher being grayed out and i did what you said on comment page 3 and i still can't use the Data Files on the launcher. know what to do?"
,WDoubleYouW,2013-04-01T06:28Z,"There are three things that control the Data files:

1. Two text files in %userappdata%/local/skyrim

2. The install path set in HKLM/Software/Bethesda Softworks/Skyrim (in WOW6432Node in 64-bit computers)

3. The bEnableFileSelection=1 line in Documents/My Games/Skyrim/skyrimprefs.ini

Most common problem is that #3 isn't correct. Please verify that bEnableFileSelection=1 is in the [Launcher] section of the ini file before trying anything else.

Next most common problem generally occurs when the user has installed Skyrim several times to different locations without the registry keys relating to these installations being removed. Please verify that the install path set in HKLM/Software/Bethesda Softworks/Skyrim (in WOW6432Node in 64-bit computers) is set to your current Skyrim installation and delete any duplicates pointing elsewhere.

The two text files in appdata/local/skyrim control what mods/dlc are loaded into the game. Edit them to make sure both include the line ""Dragonborn.esm"" in them if all else fails."
