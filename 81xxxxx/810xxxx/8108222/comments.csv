,salil_1337,2013-02-07T03:56Z,Got a Phenom II X2 550 BE here with VMWare Workstation 9. And what about the cpu has been disabled by the guest operating system bug ? I got that on all of the images i downloaded. Have been keeping a track of the souldevteam blog. Thanks for the upload.

==================
Android for VMware:
AndroidOS VMware Image
Android 4.0.1 ICS Virtual Machine
LiveAndroid v0.3 "
,salil_1337,2013-02-08T16:47Z,"Instructions - 

1) Install VMWare Workstation
2) Unrar the torrent contents
3) In the extracted folder go to 
VMware Unlocker - Mac OS X GuestVMware 8.x SeriesVMware Workstation Unlocker - Windows
double click the 'install' bat file
4) Restart computer, go to BIOS and enable AMD Secure Virtual Machine from Advanced Menu under CPU
5) Reboot
6) double click the amd_kernel file and type 'y' to backup your NVRAM
7) double click the vmx file.
8) In the VMWare workstation, right click on the vmachine loaded and remove Floppy drive, and under Display, check accelerate 3D graphics. Press OK
9) Start the vmachine

Bugs - it works fine for 5 mins then hangs. But this is the first one that at least boots

NOTE : If you do not install the amd_kernel before booting the vmachine, it will give you the ""Guest operating system has disabled the CPU"" error."

,jayyfo,2013-02-21T16:39Z,has anyone been able to successfully get Final Cut Pro to work with this? I can get the virtual machine to work on my AMD Athlon(tm) II X2 260 processor but when running FCP it says FCP closed unexpectedly without even opening.
,Iamfox,2013-03-21T09:25Z,I have a machine with Intel Processor (Core i5) .  Would it work with it too?
,dooms316316,2013-03-28T05:24Z,I cant get it to unzip....winrar keeps not opening it:/
