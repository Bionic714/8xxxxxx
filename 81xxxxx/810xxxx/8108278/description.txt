ReleaseNotes:

Favorite topics on this collection of Weird Al classics include food and medical
problems. Superstar Michael Jackson gets sent up twice: "Bad" is transformed into
"Fat" and "Beat It" becomes "Eat It," a hit in its own right. Robert Palmer's
"Addicted to Love" is turned into a paean to potatoes, "Addicted to Spuds." And Los
Lobos' version of the durable "La Bamba" is reconfigured into "Lasagna." Madonna's
"Like a Virgin" becomes a song about a different kind of beginner on "Like a Surgeon,"while James Brown's "Living in America" is parodied on "Living with a Hernia." If you want to take a funhouse mirror trip back to the 1980s, Greatest Hits is a good way to do it. Produced by rock & roll veteran Rick Derringer, who rocked out with Johnny and Edgar Winter and produced Meatloaf and Kiss. --Fred Cisterna
