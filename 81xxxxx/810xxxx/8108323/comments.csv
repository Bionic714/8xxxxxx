Pay attention to the torrent description
""Encoded date                             : UTC 2012-11-26 00:37:31"" !

The upload date was not set, but your request made the things to move .... and ... here we are !

Enjoy!

P.S. Any promise for your second ""wish""... But who knows !"

Another excellent quality Blu-ray rip

Hope you can find some time to do one of your versions of the Remastered Terminator 1984

,mrmuvis,2013-02-07T00:38Z,"My bad..didn't check the encode date..as i mentioned i would really appreciate if u could upload The Insider (1999)..it has just released on blu-ray..
And if u could upload:
