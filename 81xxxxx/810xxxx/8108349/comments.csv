,NoMoreAVI,2013-02-06T06:10Z,I'd rather see compilations organized by author over title.
,ineffed,2013-02-06T06:31Z,"Do you have any Zenna Henderson?  Aside from The Anything Box, I haven't been able to find anything online, and the novels are all out of print.  Thanks!"
,whadjasai,2013-02-06T14:43Z,"Thanks for the collection and I would like to see more but I agree with NoMoreAVI.
Could you at least add the author to the file name?"
,HeartsQuilt,2013-02-06T18:40Z,"List the books whatever way your heart desires. I appreciate the work you've gone through.  My sister is looking for zombie and apocalyptic themes.  Also, Philip Jose Farmer, Roger Zelazny, Eric Frank Russell"

Eric Frank Russel would be nice.
But any way you want to post  these is fine."
