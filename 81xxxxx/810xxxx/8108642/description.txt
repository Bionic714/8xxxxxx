Storyline:
When the president of Russia suddenly dies, a man whose politics are virtually unknown succeeds him.
The change in political leaders sparks paranoia among American CIA officials, so CIA director Bill Cabot recruits a young analyst to supply insight and advice on the situation.
Then the unthinkable happens: a nuclear bomb explodes in a U.S. city, and America is quick to blame the Russians
