[V],murphy78,2013-02-06T10:32Z,"I personally don't care for the shortcuts, but I like having a set way of installing and uninstalling.

In my opinion, once you're set up you don't have to worry about re-activating anyway, so there's no point in putting shortcut links.

I'd like to see this go the direction that Daz did in his windows loader where you install it and then never see it again, but I didn't make it so I'll take what I can get :P"
