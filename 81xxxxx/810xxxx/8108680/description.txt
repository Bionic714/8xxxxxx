KMSNano is an Offline KMS Activator that emulates a KMS server in the memory of
your computer and sends activation data back and forth attempting to activate
volume versions of Windows and Office. I have personally activated KMSNano without
having my lan drivers even installed on a fresh install of Windows 7.

There are other earlier versions that may or may not work currently.
You should always check for the latest version before using.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Activates:
Windows Vista Business/Enterprise Default/N/VL
Windows 7 Pro/Enterprise Default/N/VL
Windows 8 Pro/Enterprise Default/N/VL
Windows Server Std/Data 2008/2008R2/2012
Office/OfficeVL 2010/2013.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------Please read this non-KMS Windows versions list-------
Retail-Only Versions of windows that will **NOT** activate are:
Vista Starter/Homebasic/Homepremium/Ultimate - Default/N/E
7 Starter/Homebasic/Homepremium/Ultimate - Default/N/E
8 core/coreN/ProWMC
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Requirements: . NET 4.0 or Windows 8

Instructions:

1. Extract the zip file or open it in file explorer.
2. Run KMSnano_setup.exe It will install to a folder, add shortcuts and trigger install
(TriggerKMS will run every boot, and if you have 30 days left or less, it will
re-run the activator. If you install it while unactivated it will run activator)
3. Wait about 45-60secs for an initial activation if you aren't activated
(It takes MUCH longer for Retail to VL Office 2013 conversion - Up to 12 mins at most.
4. Done. Run the Check link on start menu to verify your activation.

For Windows 8, it can take a minute or two of doing system things for the
watermark to go away. You don't need to reboot.

To fix any botched activations from other horrible Korean activators,
you can run admin command "SFC /SCANNOW" as a first resort, "SLMGR /REARM"
as a second resort, and a backup restore from your windows dvd as a 3rd option.
In windows 8 you can search for "refresh" and look for the links under settings.
All of those fixes you use at your own risk. Do a google search if you don't
know what they do.

Note that Pre-Release versions of Office or Windows will NEVER activate.
You can try the UpDown8 v1.3.exe tool if you have a version that is
unsupported like enterprise trial version, but you use at your own risk.
(Inside kmsnano.exe - Extract using 7z or winrar to use)

Why use this program over any other activation method?
-It does not modify any of your system files.
-Because it's not a crack or a hack.
-Because it's the only way to get legit activation without using legit servers.
-Did I mention it activates ALL KMS activation software?

Change Log from v21:
- Fixed known bugs.
(I've spotted one if you run the prog twice in a row. It doesn't allow it
to unload or recharge correctly. Give it some time before re-running)

(murphy's)Recommendations:

- Disable Smart Screen filter for Windows 8 (MS isn't going to want this prog)
- Disable Automatic Updates and pre-screen any installed updates.
- Allow KMSnano.exe and any other KMSnano related files in Antivirus.

Included is KMSnano Documentation v13.1.pdf
Please read this first if you have any problems.
There is a link to a log.cmd which just opens kmsnano.log from the
temp directory. You may want this if you need to relay some info
on the MDL boards about an unsupported language or something.

(Big Salute to heldigard and all the peeps who contributed to this project)
Over the Rainbow is gone and the program currently has an applause track
that is broken. So no sound on this one.
Enjoy Pirates,
