Ma'sh'Allah ! [By Allah's Will] 1st International Debate between an Evangelical Christian and a Muslim student of the Qur'an was held in Sydney, Australia on the 7th of July, 2012, Saturday at the Bellevue Auditorium. 
Al Hamdulillah ! [ All Praises For Allah Alone] The Debate was a Great Success of the Truth of Qur'an as the God's Word being established being represented by Br. Imran, President, IREF, Hyderabad, India while Br. Imran academically disproved the Bible to be the Word of God.
Subhaan Allah ! [ All Glory Befits Allah Alone ] Reverend Samuel Green of Tasmania, Australia could not prove Bible to be the Word of God and his efforts to disprove Qur'an as Allah's Word went in vain as he was no match to argue with reason, logic, scientific understanding and most importantly with evidences to the arguments put forward by the Muslim representative of Islam i.e. Br. Imran of IREF, Hyderabad, India.
