Popular music and the charts have created questions needing urgent answers ever since Lita Roza asked 'How Much Is That Doggie In The Window?' in 1953, and there is no relief in sight. It seems that people like being asked questions and even more, they like knowing the answers.
Our books, British Hit Singles, British Hit Albums and Hits of the 80s to name but three, have been used for so long as the source of answers to all these questions, that we thought it was about time we asked a few of our own. So here they are, all 2602 of them.
If you want to cheat, arm yourselves with our other publications and you will be able to find out many of the answers. However, there will still be plenty of questions which no amount of reference books will help you with, and others you won't believe even when you look up the answers.
