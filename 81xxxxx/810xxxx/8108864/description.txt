Every unique photograph begins with an original point of view
The first book in a brand-new photographic seriesΓÇöshot mostly by amateursΓÇöabout seeing the world from a brand-new perspective!
Amateurs, by definition, work for love aloneΓÇöso what subject could be more fitting for the first entry in a brand-new series focusing on the art of the amateur photographer than that potent symbol of love: the heart?  Through their snapshot-hungry eyes, these photographers glimpse hearts everywhere: in graffiti scrawled on an alleyway wall, in paper cut by a child, and in natureΓÇÖs worn stones scattered on a forest floor. All thatΓÇÖs necessary is to open our eyesΓÇªwhich is what this collection inspires us to do.
