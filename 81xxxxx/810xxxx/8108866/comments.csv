,narutoslayer,2013-03-25T06:22Z,"Did not personally download this but, I had a friend that was switching from windows 7 enterprise to ultimate... and i had him download this... worked on the first try. he deleted the loader v2.2 and then unzipped the win7 folder and double clicked the setup.  I had him use Team Viewer with me. the performance on installing graphic drivers and audio drivers and doing some defragments and his game performance was just normal/great so... this torrent is rated 10/10 :D"
,Dabboyonly,2013-05-16T18:11Z,"i get an installation failure at the end of the setup.. if i boot from the hard disk it gives me an error saying that bootmgr is missing.
does anybody else have the same problem?"
