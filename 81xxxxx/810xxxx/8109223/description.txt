The ICE 3 for Train Simulator is a highly-accurate recreation of the Class 406 ICE 3M high speed train in DB livery, complete with a fantastic passenger view which enables lucky passengers to see into the driverΓÇÖs cab and through the windscreen during their journey. Realistic operating features include PZB90 cab signalling system, AFB speed control and SIFA driver vigilance system. ICE 3 also includes scenarios for the Cologne-Dusseldorf route.

Cologne-Dusseldorf available separately.
