Hi,

This upload is a result of a crash course uploading. Recently a friend of mine stopped. Enjoyed (and relayed on) his compilations (Dutch Treat) the last 20 months. Got lazy myself. So I felt this should continue. So I volunteered.

Listening to the multiple Indie Rock lists, it did not take me long to understand why. 80% is - with respect - shit. Interested listeners deserve better. And even more important it keeps new (older) listeners from getting interested and learn to enjoy some new sounds (the next 40 years).

Indie is no Punk (against), Indie has history (Sixties) and history tells a story (together). So I will try to be that arrogant to select only the best tracks (Sound wise and Content wise, taste wise?) for my guests.

The best way to start (and the best way to learn things) was making a first Upload under my own name (~@~). I have chosen for six Dutch Treat compilations that helped me to enjoy the Music of today. And a bit of a thank you of course.

Enjoy sharing.... Nice and load, and play along with Porcupine Tree, Fink, Mother Mother and others.
