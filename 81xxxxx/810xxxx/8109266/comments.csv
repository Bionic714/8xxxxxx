,smithm578,2013-02-06T15:31Z,"the video is a little stretched and fuzzy, but this is definitely watchable -- what do you people expect from a webrip that is 90mb?  Scene hasn't released anything yet so as a tosh.0 fan THANK YOU for sharing!!!!!!"

Strange, but here we are late Feb 06, 2013 and there are no scene releases of Tosh.0 S05E01 aired on Feb 05, 2013.  

Is there some boycott of Tosh?
Did some fruity show like DWTS preempt it?
Did the premiere actually not air, due to some disaster, whether natural or political?  
WHAT GIVES?

Regardless, ShoReleases is the only game in town at this time, so kudos to you.  "
