DropDMG... Disk images pack entire folders or disks into a single compressed file, either for transport across the Internet or simply for backup. They are Apple's preferred format for distributing Mac software. Disk images are also the only archive format whose contents you can directly access in the Finder.

DropDMG is the easiest way to create Mac OS X disk images, as well as cross-platform archives. Just drag and drop a folder or file and you're done. Or, you can drag an existing disk image or archive onto DropDMG to convert it to any of the other supported formats or to burn it to CD or DVD.

DropDMG supports advanced options such as encrypted and segmented disk images, WYSIWYG layout with background pictures and custom volume icons, and rich-text license agreements in multiple languages. There are many time-saving features, and it can also be automated via AppleScript, the command-line, and Automator.

What's New:

* Fixed a bug where DropDMG sometimes didnΓÇÖt create large enough
  disk images for files that were stored using HFS+ compression (e.g.
  applications from the Mac App Store).

* Fixed a bug where the log showed the source folderΓÇÖs allocated size
  rather than its logical size.

* Fixed a bug creating a disk image with a layout that had text but no 
  background picture.

* Fixed a bug that could cause DropDMG to create a device image with a
  dirty HFS+ journal. If the disk image was read-only, it would not be 
  possible to mount the disk image. If you have such a disk image, you 
  can fix it by converting it to a read-write format. The journal will then be 
  replayed and saved in a clean state.

* Fixed a bug where DropDMG could hang when using the contextual 
  menu in the log.

* Added instructions for burning a disc with a Custom volume icon.

* Updated the Italian localization.

System Requirements:

Intel or PPC Mac 

OS version: Mac OS X.5.8 or above
