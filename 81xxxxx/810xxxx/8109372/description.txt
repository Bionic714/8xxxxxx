CD debut of one of the least known and most underrated folk-progressive albums from Britain!
Fronted by noted folk guitarist Andy Roberts (ex-Liverpool Scene) and organist Bob Sargeant (ex-Junco Partners) the band released this eponymous album in January 1971 on B&C label ΓÇô home of Atomic Rooster, Steeleye Span, Ginhouse and Hannibal.
This quite varied, nicely arranged and very often simply stunning album contained plenty of interesting folk (or even country rock) ideas mixed with classic, progressive sounds ΓÇô with changing moods, atmospheric instrumental piano/organ/mellotron passages, fine guitar leads and very complex and slightly jazzy rhythm section.
