Reason being is more than 50% of the time I DL a zip or rar is corrupted and will not open. This way people can choose what to and not DL by sections. I spent hours DL a 40gb files only to have it corrupted and was ONLY able to see and use 1.6gb out of all of it! If I hadn't beat the horse already- and they 40gb was in 10 sections even if part of a single ISO. Winrar would tell em which section is bad and one could re-download it again. Well if its bad and any part of it (From data streams over the net not your fault) it will be next to worthless. TY for sharing either way.
