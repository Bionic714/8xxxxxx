A dramatization of the 1980 joint CIA-Canadian secret operation to extract six 
fugitive American diplomatic personnel out of revolutionary Iran.

In 1979, the American embassy in Iran was invaded by Iranian revolutionaries and 
several Americans are taken hostage. However, six manage to escape to the official 
residence of the Canadian Ambassador and the CIA is eventually ordered to get 
them out of the country. With few options, exfiltration expert Tony Mendez devises 
a daring plan: to create a phony Canadian film project looking to shoot in Iran 
and smuggle the Americans out as its production crew. With the help of some 
trusted Hollywood contacts, Mendez creates the ruse and proceeds to Iran as its 
associate producer. However, time is running out with the Iranian security forces 
closing in on the truth while both his charges and the White House have grave 
doubts about the operation themselves.
