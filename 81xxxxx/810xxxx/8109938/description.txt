Storyline This is a 'found-footage' movie from Canada about five young friends who go on a trip to a cabin back in 2011, but on the way (while filming it) they head off the beaten track to a place called Crowsnest where they have heard that you can buy beer for half price! They get the beer but at the same time they receive a warning to head back where they came from or they will die. But they don't take the warning too seriously and keep driving in to the forest.
