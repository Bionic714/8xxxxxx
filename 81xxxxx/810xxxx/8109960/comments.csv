The subtitles, which take up about a third of the screen, are on there throughout the whole fucking movie. I wish I could transport my body through this internet cable so that I could go to your place, tagore2,  and deliver a swift kick to your nuts, if you have any, you stupid cunt."

    Is like to order one icecream then complain cause is cold."

I always check to see if subs are hard coded.
The fact that there's only one file in this up should scream, ""HARD CODED SUBS""."
