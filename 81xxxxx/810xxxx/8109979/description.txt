WiFi Explorer enables you to quickly identify channel conflicts, overlapping and other factors (e.g. configuration issues) that may be affecting the connectivity and/or performance of your wireless network in homes, offices and other sites.

Find open, ad-hoc and even rogue access points. WiFi Explorer detects 802.11a/b/g/n wireless networks and supports 2.4 and 5 GHz channel bands, as well as 20 and 40 MHz channels.

Get an insight into the network details: name (SSID), MAC address (BSSID), device manufacturer, signal strength (RSSI), noise, channel, band, security configuration, supported data rates and much more.

Monitor signal strength of each network over time and export metrics (average, maximum signal strength, etc.) and network details to CSV file format.

Great exclusive features:

* Easy-to-use, intuitive user interface.

* Graphical visualization of the wifi environment to help you 
  identify channel conflicts and overlapping that may be affecting 
  the performance of your wireless network.
 
* Detects and correctly identifies 40 MHz channels, and 
  indicates if secondary channel is above (ch, +1) or below (ch, 
  -1) the primary channel.

* Provides signal quality ratings based on Signal-to-Noise 
  (SNR) measurements.

* Detects various security options, including Wi-Fi Protected 
  Setup (WPS)-enabled access points and supported encryption 
  algorithms.

* Detects supported data rates for 802.11a/b/g/n networks.

* Displays signal strength as percentage or dBm


WiFi Explorer offers the same great features in both Snow Leopard and Lion operating systems.

What's New:

Fixes problems introduced after changes made in the previous version, in particular:

* Application crashing in Snow Leopard.

* Incorrect raw/avg/max/min signal strength and noise 
  estimations for associated networks.

System Requirements:

Intel Mac, OS X.6 or better
Processor type(s) & speed: Intel CPU
