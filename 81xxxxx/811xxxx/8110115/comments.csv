READ WHAT IT SAYS In ""2 Cor 4/4"": ""King James Bible""

In whom the ""God of this world"" hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.
{Remember God cast Satan out of Heaven because Satan wanted to be as powerful as GOD.}

John 12:31. Now is the judgment of this world; now the ""Ruler of this world"" will be cast out.
So the great dragon was cast out, that serpent of old, called the Devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world; he was cast to the earth, and his angels were cast out with him. Revelation 12:9

Jesus calls Satan the ""Ruler of this World"". Satan offered Jesus the Kingdom of the Earth in
Luke 4:6. ""And the Devil said to him ""Jesus"",“All this authority I will give You, and their glory; for this ""WORLD"" has been delivered to me, and I give it to whomever I wish.

Job 1:6-12. Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan also came among them, And the Lord said to Satan,“From where do you come?” So Satan answered the Lord and said,“From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking back and forth on it.”

Also I would like to add: Satanic worshipers chant, and pray in their Satanic Mass's, that their Lord ""Satan"" is the ""Lord of this world"". http://us.geocities.com/occult_library/satani...

Just sayin! :) "
