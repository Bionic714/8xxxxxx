We start round 2 with Berretta and Cheyenne on the mats to start. As soon as the whistle blows, Berretta runs to her corner to get a tag. Cheyenne is so big, strong and intimidating that Berretta doesn't even think she can take her with Isamar's help. She pulls a tag and run which is illegal on our mats. Once you tag, you must stay in with your partner for 45 seconds until the ref calls you out. We restart with Both Team Blue Members on the mats with Cheyenne in the middle. Isamar is able to secure a brutal head lock which puts Cheyenne in enough agony that the ref has to call a time out. Energy is heated and shits about to get REAL!!!!!
