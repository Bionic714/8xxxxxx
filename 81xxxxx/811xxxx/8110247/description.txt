After a somewhat lackluster sophomore release, This Perfect Day rebounded with the critically successful (albeit commercially slow) Don't Smile. While it was only released in the band's native Sweden, there's a ton to love here, especially for fans. Opening with the fuzzed-out, over the top "Flamingo," a song dripping with smooth vocal harmonies and a crashing guitar solo, the band barely relents throughout. The guitars are turned up to the max on every track, completely washing the ten-song cycle in distortion and feedback. The effect is tremendous, as quick comparisons could easily be made to other excellent discs like Oasis' Definitely Maybe, Matthew Sweet's 100% Fun, and Silver Sun's self-titled debut. Album highlights also include the sizzling single "It's a Shame" and the summery title track.
