Award winning director Brad Armstrong parodies the coming of age classic. Joel (Kris Slater) and Lana (Kirsten Price) continue the story where the original left off. Joel has graduated and is away attending university, so Lana and a few of her sexy friends (Alektra Blue, Asa Akira, and Misty Stone) come for a little visit. When Joels new preppy, frat-boy, friends meet Lana and the girls the excitement begins. Like it or not Joel is back in business. Their tutoring sessions are a huge hit on campus even the Dean (Randy Spears) decides to join in the fun. Everything is running smooth until Guido shows up to spoil the party. But this time Joel is ready for him, and has a little payback waiting. So watch and learn, cause these girls are gonna school you. Get ready for the education of a lifetime.
