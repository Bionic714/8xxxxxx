Once of central importance to left historians and activists alike, the concept of the ΓÇ£bourgeois revolutionΓÇ¥ has recently come in for sustained criticism from both Marxists and conservatives. In this comprehensive rejoinder, Neil Davidson seeks to answer the question, How revolutionary were the bourgeois revolutions? by systematically examining the approach taken by a wide range of thinkers to explain their causes, outcomes, and content across the historical period from the sixteenth-century Reformation to twentieth-century decolonization. Through far-reaching research and comprehensive analysis, Davidson demonstrates that there is much at stakeΓÇöfar from being a stale issue for the history books, understanding these struggles of the past can offer insightful lessons for todayΓÇÖs radicals.
