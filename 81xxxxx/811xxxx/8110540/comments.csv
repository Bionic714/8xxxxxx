[V],STFmaryville,2013-02-06T21:26Z,"910px, wait for the Novus release if you don't like it"
,dbranson17,2013-02-07T01:39Z,"not a like or dislike, I'm astounded at the size and wasn't sure if it was a mistake or files were missing..."
,dbranson17,2013-02-07T01:40Z,"or if I should ask about the brand new, AWESOME CODEC you were using!"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-02-07T02:59Z,sincerely the Re-em scanner from Novus does every star trek issue. these pages are unusually small at 910px wide (although 2 or 3 years ago that was the norm).
