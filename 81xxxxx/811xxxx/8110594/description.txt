I re-encoded these for my own use and have decided to share them

I used Nero Recode 12 2 pass AVC all highest settings 2250kbps for the video
stream copy for the audio

The quality of the dvd's isnt that great in the first place
but as far as im concernet these are as good as the dvd
and are 10x better than the current scene release
