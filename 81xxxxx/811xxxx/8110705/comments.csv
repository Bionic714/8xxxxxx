,oneslider,2013-02-07T07:48Z,"A correction from me, it's not a dmg file, I did make one but realized that a zip file of the contents of the dmg was slightly smaller.
I have included all of the ""Hidden"" files from the dmg, just in case you'd like to create a dmg yourself. there is a ""hidden"" install folder."

,wharfrat22,2013-02-07T21:03Z,It unzips fine. You just have to try another .zip app.  I DO have a question though...What am I putting in a DMG? Help! I tried just installing and nothing happened.  Do I put all the files inside the zip into a DMG? thanks! 
,jeffmcpwn,2013-02-07T22:09Z,i tried it with 2 different programs. one said that the file was corrupt and the other said i did not the the permission. i am just going to use the other torrent the password was given and it is a rar. good job man! made me waste time and broadband!

Why I suppose is a fake?
1) not instructions...  I undesrand IF is only to click and install...but just for unzip NOT WORK any standar software in MAC.    why not say with WITCH zip program UNZIP the torrent??
Yeah...you are super MASTER user of mac , and you know every thing...but you don't think this is a thing to say ???  before say FUCK ecc...think well and say sometinhg about.

2) later MANY experiments...finaly I have unzip the files...but, You can't rin the installer, because not work...     ""MOUNT"".... why ?!?  HOW ?!?
no instructions , non steps...nothing of nothing.

3) anothers experiments and I mounted the files (ALL ,also the invisibles) on a dmg image , but also not working...installer just do nothing.

4) IF you try to make a installation alone with the APPS internals the dir...you became every where....THIS VERSION OF PT IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH YOUR OSX.  

5) every where I read and I know , unfortunbatly, for MAC, there is only a old working PATCH version of PT...9.01 or 02  , but still working ONLY with snow leopard OSX.
FOR lion and Mlion , begin working from 9.0.5 to the last 10  , BUT no patch/crakck for every of this.

is true this or is only a ""FUCK"" thinkin of me?

so, meaby another one, like explain step by step , the solution , and show this in not a fuck release/torrent.... I'm here for say excuseme, no problem.

Seriously.  I've screen captured every single post you've made thus far on this particular upload and have forwarded everything over to the Moderators / Administrators on The Pirate Bay Forum.

oneslider posted the most basic instructions possible ... and if YOU ""are"" familiar with a Mac using any OS X version, you would already know how to unpack / unzip a file.  Hell, someone even suggested *TO* you to use The Unarchiver ... but you even moaned, bitched, and complained about that, too.

So please ... tell us ... why should *ANYONE* take you seriously???  You've bitched, whined, moaned, complained, and even insulted others for their efforts ... and you STILL have the unmitigated gall and audacity to **DEMAND** that we help you with this.

Dude ... REALLY???  How fucking old are you anyway???  What ... you wanna be led by the hand through every fucking step.  NOt a fucking soul here owes you a goddamned thing, man.  Get that through your thick fucking skull.  You don't come on here, throwing baseless accusations around, and then throw a bitch fit and temper tantrum just because you've been called out for the stupidity and ignorance you've so obviously shown.  Dude, you started this shit with that juvenile, wanna-be bad-ass attitude of yours ... and guess what?  I'm going to finish it.

I'm petitioning now - as I type this - to have your account revoked and your I.P. Address banned permanently.  YOu've shown ZERO respect to oneslider and have continued this back and forth with me whenI wasn't even actually speaking to fucking start with ... YOU were the one who decided to play billy-bob bad-ass and throw all that Latin machismo bullshit around and try to intimidate people into helping your pussy ass.

So, guess what, sunshine?  FUCK YOU.  I've been around here a lot longer than you have, sweet-cheeks.  You wanna lock horns with me? COME ON.  

Now, I suggest you sit down, have a Coke and a smile, and seriously shut the fuck up if I were you.  This upload / torrent works as advertised.  It is not fake.  It is legitimate and it runs PERFECTLY on Mountain Lion.  If you're too fucking stupid to figure it out, then that's on you, you silly sonofafuckingbitch ... you were given the most basic information on how to set it up.

Now, fuck off.  BE SILENT.  If you want help ... then you ask.  And you ask POLITELY ... you don't fucking ""demand"" shit."
,jimizanei,2013-02-11T10:17Z,"ah,ah,ah,ah...you have read only little bit WHAT KIND OF WORDS you write to me ?!? any you begin to say every body here , don't understand how unzip and install this FAKE relese....
SO stick of IDIOT , write to the administrator yes , but found also the thime to come out of the monitor, and say somthing to me on face... little coward!!!

for the another people here...DON'T loose time with this fake torrent because NEVER and NEVER can work with MOUNTAIN LION 10.8.2 !!! nevere...
There is no PROTOOLS crack/patch...
forget it!

If you like PROtools on mac , YOU NEED , SNOW LEOPARD , and work till 9.0.3 (there's a last patch)

this is all , but IF any one like lose time and try, is free..

PRO TOOLS from 9.0.5 begine to be compatible and working also with LION and ML 10.8.2 , but no patch , no crack for MAC.

Before 9.0.5 ONLY on snow leopard , work...but  til 9.0.3  (the last patch x mac) 

so , pro tools 9.0.4  HAVE NO PATCH...also for snow leopard users.

what version is this ? really crazy...  no body have a working version of PT on MOUNTAIN LION...because begine to work only from 9.0.5 , but NO PATCH....
and here we must belive (WITHOUT ANY HELP) this 9.0.4 work on MOUTAIN LION...

every body know the last patch work only on 9.0.3...and ofcourse only on snow leopard.


BUT NOW...
we have a great genius, who knows' just say tons of offenses, which has begun to tell her long before I posting it here, anyone who said he does not understand how to install this release.
So I'm wondering where there is a seriousness' here, as calls, ADM., and IP, after that HE wrote here only very serious offenses by criminal complaint.

but since HE says that I am a fool, and that ALL other works ... well there 'no that would like to congratulate the friend here, genius ... that in addition to continually offend said WELL how to work in MOUNTAIN LION 10.8.2? already 'cause no one and' managed in the world ... HE IS! ... if it is not 'a genius this guy ....

the solution can not be solved by telling nothing or offending continuous with vulgarity. Shows without vulgarity 'that you claim ... that you would honor, not everything else

forget me, think for the anothers...
no solutions? no istructions? no really helps?
ok...is a FAKE torrent!  STOP!"

What else can I say. This has to do with the update. This particular version DOES NOT WORK with Lion. Simple as that.

Now when I had this installed on Snow Leopard it worked perfectly fine. I have not updated to Mountain Lion just because Lion works perfectly find for me everyday needs. "

FUCK YOU *AND* THE BITCH WHO SPAWNED YOU.  I don't owe you a GODDAMNED thing, slick ... so kiss my goddamned ass and move the fuck on if you don't like it.  No one's compelling you to read a goddamned thing I say, so what the fuck is it to you???  

Dumb-ass piece of shit. "

Respect to anyone that takes the time to help.
I'm running 10.6.8 and thus far have unpacked the zip file. used tinker to see all files, created a dmg using canvas. copied the folder which had all files onto the dmg. deleted zip file. mounted and installed.

Pro tools is asking me for iLok authorization. Any help is greatly appreciated!"
,itzSMOKE,2013-03-08T09:10Z,"im running mountain lion .. cant get it to work .. i followed the steps stated above , but still didnt work for me .. will anyone be kind enough to help? lol"
,itzSMOKE,2013-03-09T08:41Z,"figured out how to install it .. but like Cachorro said , it doesnt work with OS X 10.8+ .. i was hoping that  he was wrong .. lol .. oh well "
,Mynightmare82,2013-03-12T15:41Z,"Yeah the guy that likes to cry on here that it actually works won't help you, He will just bad mouth you and say IT WORKS, IT WORKS, But yet it doesn't work, that's the reality of it. I think he's on some drugs with all of those fits he's having on here. Just move on and find one that works for ML and for Lion. This should work perfectly fine on SL I had this running on there a while back. I'm done with this. "
,WinnerTakesAll,2013-04-05T23:53Z,"It Does Work, I Just installed it on two different Macs. It does ask for Authorization though, with no iLok what's the point?"
