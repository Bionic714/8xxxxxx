[V],HeroMaster,2013-02-06T19:44Z,Ok Guys Last go at Dead Space 3 this includes Limited Edition plus DLC Exclusive RePack in demand and very hot go get it now!
,zikkie323,2013-02-06T19:51Z,Can u play Multipayer/co-op somehow on the cracked versions of dead space 3 pr this version of the game ??
,davideassis,2013-02-06T20:03Z,"Can you tell me if this release will work with future Updates, DLCs and Content Packs correctly?"
,Koca114,2013-02-06T21:16Z,Can someone tell me if there is a way to play co-op? Simple no would do it
,anarion32,2013-02-06T21:31Z,how can i change the language?
,s1raz1,2013-02-06T22:00Z,"Thx HeroMaster, ill give it a go, ur other repack worked fine, didnt have bonus items tho, beggars cant be choosers :P
@David
To play future DLC u need the 10gb+ releases, since ull need the original .exe file to update/install DLCs, and all repakcs come cracked already.
@guyaboveme
The installer should let u choose between russian and English, also game takes into account ur windows language to set ingame language, i think u can change ur regional windows language on control panel. (I have a english WIN7, for me everything comes by default on english)"
,davideassis,2013-02-06T22:10Z,"This release really comes with Limited Edition content (Witness Suit, First Contact Suit, Evangelizer Weapon, Negotiator Weapon, Tesla Enervator,  EG-900 SMG and Dead Space 1)?

Because the game only warns me, at the main menu, about the Bonus Content. The L.E. armor and weapons will be avaible later, in benches and stuff?"
,davideassis,2013-02-06T22:17Z,"@s1raz1

Even DLCs and UPDATES released by RELOAD, THETA, SKiDROW and other groups?"
,davideassis,2013-02-06T22:48Z,"@s1raz1

Even updates and DLCs released by other groups, like RELOADED? It's the same crack, right? So should be the same as the 10GB releases, right?"
,kobby2k12,2013-02-07T00:32Z,I have tried the reloaded and skidrow deadspace 3 torrents but none of them have the unlocked two suits and two guns from the DLCs...These torrents are labeled as limited edition Deadspace 3 but are missing the DLC pack from it.  I am currently on Chapter 5 and have only unlocked the plasma gun and N7 suit due to mass effect 3 save and deadspace 2 save.. Is it confirmed that the limited editions suits and guns show up in the torrent? Thank you and have a great day..
,JohnCartel,2013-02-07T01:08Z,WORKS .. PLUS 2 DLC !
,kingdude1412,2013-02-07T02:18Z,I got a weird glitch where all of my rig (hp and stasis) the models for stasis and kinesis item pick ups and interactions have disappeared... an help will be appreciated!
,kingdude1412,2013-02-07T04:04Z,"found a fix, just save exit and restart the game"
,omgzelda,2013-02-07T04:20Z,"None of these ""Limited Editions"" have  the bonus items, such bullshit. False advertisement. "
,s1raz1,2013-02-07T04:30Z,"@David
Yea, any of the torrents u see here on TPB 10+GB will be able to receive Updates + DLC should they are released. 
The cracks from different  groups sometimes change the save path on some games but other than that i dont recall  a issue."
,kickassmusicman,2013-02-07T05:54Z,Game works great with windows 8 with two 6970s in crossfire .. But the game is capped at 30 FPS does anybody know how to make it run at 60 fps ..
,Machine4578,2013-02-07T06:15Z,"LOL!!!! this DOES NOT include any L.E. content like HeroMaster says!! if you actually had read the description it says(which i read before wasting my bandwidth)

Bonus Content DLC:

Plasma cutter grinder lithosphere.
Costume N7.

that anyone can get just by having DS2 and ME3 saves!!

next time HeroMaster read your own damn description first before posting a stupid comment like you did!

as of now no one with a cracked version can access any L.E. content unless you BUY the game.. "
,kobby2k12,2013-02-07T06:33Z,"@kickassmusicman 

disable vsync in the game...

and if you have an nvidia card like myself..go to the nvidia control panel...find the deadspace 3 exe and enable vsync through the nvidia control panel settings...I have a 2 year old laptop with Geforce 550M and I am getting 40-50fps with high settings..good luck bro...

p.s.  I'm really disappointed that the two limited editions custumes and guns are not available in any of these uploaded deadspace torrents..the deadline is the 12th to get the limited edition from origin, I might be forced to bite lol"
[V],HeroMaster,2013-02-07T09:06Z,"Ok well people we found out that there is no DLC unlock in this version so we have to wait for a DLC Unlocker, sorry from our side!"
,Riebis,2013-02-07T12:20Z,co-op is working? have enyone tried?
,HELLBOY741,2013-02-07T17:18Z,Hey everything went fine bt the game is crashing on start up after a black screen. Any one have any solutions ?? im not using any joysticks. Thanks
,Sushant20,2013-02-07T18:10Z,"You rock HeroMaster!!!
Game works perfectly no problem at all :)"
,marcin205,2013-02-07T20:51Z,hi can someone just upload bonus content?
,Koca114,2013-02-07T21:17Z,"@HeroMaster Hey mate, game works really well. I was wondering if you could upload a torrent of multiplayer crack or something, I really want to play this with my brother. I would appreciate it."
,ldbracho,2013-02-07T22:28Z,"Im having trouble installing it in windows 8 pro. the setup  launches but it get stuck after chossing the language and pressing ok. It only shows the picture but doesnt get to the options, any thoughts???"
,kobby2k12,2013-02-09T05:16Z,"for all of us that want the DLCs like the witness suit...there is a roadblock..it seems that DLCs are somehow related to saves...I could be wrong..but the following link is of an OP that found a legal save with 12 dlcs unlocked..it doesn't work with the current cracks available :(

,nickx23,2013-02-10T05:42Z,"I've downloaded it, works fine. In adittion it's in spanish (my language) but it has no voices, nor subtitles when someone is speaking.
I think the problem is that the voices in spanish were ripped out, and the game doesn't use english voices.... any idea how to do that?"
,MrLoqueandoxD,2013-02-10T16:06Z,"Thank you dude! Works fine,and having no problem at all"
,MrLoqueandoxD,2013-02-10T17:16Z,"Well hello again,I was playing the part that is called terra nova tram or something like that, I passed that part and continue passing the game,I wanted to stop playing a little while so I save and quit,then when I open the game and put load most recent checkpoint it loads the terra nova tram! help?"
,s1raz1,2013-02-10T19:08Z,"the save system is weird on the first chapters, if u cleared a chunk of the game, u  might have unlocked checkpoints, look on chapter selection, if not, u just gonna have to redo and play till screen says saving."
,MrLoqueandoxD,2013-02-10T22:25Z,Thanks man! I was thinking about doing it that way
,ferrera14,2013-02-11T01:40Z,seeeeeeed
,riverfront12,2013-02-12T04:14Z,The installer is russian. Any ideas on ho to play in english? Or at least how to turn it into english.
,mirth010,2013-02-12T19:11Z,"when i click on the setup icon, I'm not given the option to select the language, it's just Russian. I'm using windows 7 and my language region is sat to united states...can anyone help?....please!"
,MrLoqueandoxD,2013-02-13T03:11Z,"Im having something like a glitch I dont know in the part that you have to kill the monster with some harpoons, well I drag the monster to the laser and they shot but the monster is able to escape! Any idea?"
,s1raz1,2013-02-13T05:35Z,"put ur graphics to low(b4 u lure spider to hook lasers), i had the same issue in that part, i lower them and was able to pass that quicktime event, just keep in mind the spider will move really fast at lower graphics. 
That was the only issue  i got on that game all the other events were  fine."

,pink50,2013-02-19T18:12Z,"im not sure if this was a torrent problem but when i downloaded this game my download speed showed 1.5 mgb/s when my own download speed is only 700 kb/s..a bit strange i thought...then when i started the game install my internet connection permenately disconnected,then my cpu started to red line in my cpu meter,then programs started shutting down..i thought this must be a virus so i enabled system recovery restore point..and nothing happened,viruses usually disable the recovery process...i most of my programs including norton stopped working..i had to reformat my hard drive and reinstall everthing..now all is well"
