,chanciusmaximus,2013-02-07T06:09Z,Any way to get you to upload these files smaller or under 1000?  Having a hell of a time shrinking them down to read on my tablet and to save for later.  
[V],STFmaryville,2013-02-07T16:54Z,"chanciusmaximus, theProletariat-Novus will probably release #3 at 1440px in a couple of days. i doubt you'll find a smaller version."
,MFB2749,2013-02-08T21:32Z,"Many thanks... and Petere is NOT dead; he's stuck within his own body, under Ock's control... and the rest of Peter is in that tiny octobot. 

Ami the only perosn wondering: When that ex-gf of his sees him sign his name and the signature's different, how long will it take Tony Stark to hotwire that at-large bot and bring Petey back? Hopefully in time for a better artist."
