,hkirin1,2013-03-13T23:24Z,"first thanks for the upload and to the team for the rip. i agree with flyingwire. audio is 448 kb/s (6 ch) CBR and that's the reason of the size. video, 577 kb/s 0.110 bits/pixel. i would be happier with good video quality and good audio quality, and not extremely good audio and bad video. it's still watchable though."
