,Boston1,2013-02-22T02:46Z,"Movies consist of audio and video. As much as I enjoy the picture being good, the audio truly enhances the movie. For the life of me I can not understand why anyone would take the time to rip a movie down to 2 channels. Unless you're watching on a hand held device or have no sound system, what is the point of taking away the original sound format 5.1? Hard drive space is way too cheap these days to save a couple hundred megs. Too bad!  "
