,SOPASUX,2013-02-09T21:33Z,This episode is old and has been very well torrented already. Do we really need another one that only gets in the way with newer episodes being searched?
,rlywndr,2013-02-10T09:24Z,"Thank you.

@sopasux: the first version had a corrupted audio stream and therefore the two tracks, 5.1 and stereo were dumped and the TV-rip stereo audio track was spliced in.  If you are building a collection with quality standards, such as everything is 720p with 5.1 audio, having one episode that is only in stereo just doesn't fit with the rest.

I for one really appreciate this updated/fixed/proper version being posted, both by the poster, and whoever cares enough to put it into the iTunes store.  If you think it is a total waste of time, you wasted your time commenting about it if it doesn't matter to you."
