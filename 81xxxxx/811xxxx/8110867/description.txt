Synopsis:
'Frankenweenie' is an endearing tale about a boy and his dog, a work of creative genius Tim Burton. After the sudden disappearance of his beloved dog Sparky, little Victor uses the power of science to bring his best friend back to life, albeit with a few minor adjustments. Victor tries to hide his creation 'home', but when Sparky manages to get out, the Victor's classmates, teachers and the entire city will realize that creating a new life can become a monstrous experiment.

Production notes:
- Based on the eponymous short film Burton shot himself in 1984.
- Animated frame by frame technique (stop-motion), Frankenweenie will be filmed in black and white and then be rendered in 3D, which will elevate the classic style of animation to a whole new experience.
