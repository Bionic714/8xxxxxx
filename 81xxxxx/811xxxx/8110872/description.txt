Synopsis:
My name is Oliver Tate. I suppose it may seem pedantic but sometimes a camera would follow every step I like a documentary of an influential thinker who fight and ends up losing horribly. I tried smoking a pipe, flipping coins, and listen to songs of heartbreak in French but none of it worked, until Jordana crossed my life.

Oliver Tate is a quirky 15-year-old has two objectives: to lose his virginity before his next birthday, and prevent his mother left his father to go with an old high school sweetheart.
