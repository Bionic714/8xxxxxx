This is a "modified" version of Auto Repair For Dummies I downloaded from this site.

The original .pdf was a scan and there for had no characters you could search for.  If you wanted any reference to "timing belt" you would have to find it in the index and scroll to the page it was on.

Now you can put "timing belt" in the search and find every instance of it.

Just a slight tweak but I find it very useful.

Big props for the original uploader who scanned the whole book and made it available.
