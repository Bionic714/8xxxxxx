,matt_ruru,2013-02-08T19:36Z,"It's good to see people still upload 800mb films at 720p, against the mainstream shitty idea to upload huge files for the same quality! Thank you guy! And thanks izitox for the subs ;)"
,Leonidas123,2013-02-09T16:56Z,"matt_ruru, yes very few people make 700MB files @ 720p. Don't know why they want everyone to waste so much bandwidth. Uploaders should learn how to use codecs efficiently."
,Leonidas123,2013-02-09T16:57Z,"BTW neon, Thanks for the upload."
,rayzoredge,2013-02-10T03:57Z,thnx
,gomakc36,2013-04-05T19:03Z,"Thanks to the uploader! Movie was OK as i expected it to be! I usually watch all the movies at film.inisolo.com because they have HD's but they didn't have this one so im happy to have piratebay :) Good torrent quality - A9 V9,"
,NoMoreAVI,2013-04-09T18:30Z,"Good movie, best 720p encode.

They're coming to take me away ho ho he he ha ha
To the happy home with trees and flowers and chirping birds and basket weavers who sit and smile and twiddle their thumbs and toes
They're coming to take me away ha ha... "
