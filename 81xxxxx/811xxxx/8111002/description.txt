                              Product Description
=============================================================================

Dreaming In Key comprises eleven tracks that float between the space of electronica and techno, taking in a hint of breaks and including glorious harmonies, which you rarely hear in modern dance music. The tracks are colourful and dreamy in their own way, and work perfectly as dance floor anthems or headphone classics.
