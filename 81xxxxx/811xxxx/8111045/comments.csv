Ciao!"
,argoman,2013-02-09T15:09Z,"Thanks for the upload sXoPs!

Any idea why Pro HDR & Big Lens crash on opening? Is it because they are waiting for an update?

I've found the same problem with every download i've tried, not just this one."
,sXoPs,2013-02-10T20:35Z,@argoman: They are working fine on all jailbroken iphones. The problem maybe a incompatible tweak installed via cydia or a problem during jailbreaking session. Check if appsync is compatible with iOS version on ur idevice.
