I might would agree with you if we had a little more info as to what this is. An imdb link or short description would be nice rather than only the advertising of another tracker which does nothing to explain what this torrent is all about. "

How lazy do you have to be that you can't just go to imdb or rottentomatoes and find out for yourself? 

I prefer knowing more technical details about a torrent, but since this is TvTeam (a trusted uploader) I know I can expect pretty good quality. "
,TheTooleMan,2013-02-07T16:36Z,If you've had your head buried in the sand you probably don't know what this is about; visit the HBO web site and find out. Thanks for posting it for the rest of us.
