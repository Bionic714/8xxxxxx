,pecolos,2013-02-09T23:45Z,Hey there is no voice acting and crashed after the guy of the code kills suicide does somebody else have this problem? 
,Tsunamic,2013-02-10T20:23Z,Guys Kaos is as legit and as compressed as possible with a simple installer with just a few options a dummy could do it. I'd rather go Kaos then anyone the install is a lil slower but it is a super compressed file so if you don't have a perfect internet speed kaos is the way to go.!
,Muffinut,2013-02-11T05:20Z,"Why the hell do I have unlimited ammo? Other than that, it's perfect. Worked earlier in the game - after a few chapters, my guns reload even with no ammunition in inventory."
,Muffinut,2013-02-11T05:21Z,Must be because of the weapon crafting arena - saving in there then playing outside of it causes your weapons to never use ammo.

,Viperr101,2013-02-17T07:16Z,"Game worked fine up till around chapter 4. Now any time I try to move past that point, my driver crashes, game freezes, and my desktop gets all pixelated and I have to restart my computer to fix it. Anyone else have this problem?"
,lilfuze96,2013-02-17T09:45Z,"Can you rip the sims 3 and Saints row the third? KaOs is the only shit i trust, so i wont download any of the other ones, get back to me man, thanks much appreciated "
,crossebby,2013-02-18T18:53Z,"KAOS is fucking awesome, I am at 9th chapter. Everything is excellent the rip is installed the game in 1 hour. Thanks a ton to Ur team, outstanding all the time.

W7 x32, Xeon 2.33Ghz, 260GTX, Nvidia driver 8.17.13 WDDM 1.1, 1600x900 resolution, no problems with game so far.

The game is gud with superb graphics not up to the expectation but its very gud worth the time defiantly in my basket.

Thanks to KAOS and I will seed for long time. Pirate-bay rules................... "
,crossebby,2013-02-18T19:00Z,"If U having problems with the rip then its probably its Ur rig , don't blame the rip, KAOS is at their best. 

First make sure 20GB free space and run the ""Install"" exe. Most people mess-up their computer by not installing good antivirus+internet security, cheap antivirus software make shit in Ur computer creating lot of issues. Go for Norton Internet security 2013. And go clean Ur pc ass junk with Tuneup utilities and make ur pc smooth.

Install the latest updates from MS and NVIDIA then U won't get into this messy starting troubles. ANd don't install ton of FREE software's.

Gud luck."
,crossebby,2013-02-19T17:05Z,"I finished the game in ""impossible"", The game is worth buying. I will seed. KAOS hurrawwwwwwwwwww"
,messatsux,2013-02-20T13:14Z,"I failed the install like 10 times.  Didn't sit by the terminal window to see I was ""out of memory"" because it clears all messages when the install fails.  Switched over to NTFS disk and installed fine.  Couldn't do it on FAT32 even with ~40 GB free."
,sujeet26,2013-02-27T21:24Z,"Thank you for the rip ,gansuk ."
,sajid1988,2013-02-28T04:27Z,this rip works perfect!
[T],gansuk,2013-03-01T01:57Z,"@messatsux

fat32 has a max file size limit of 4gb only and the archive grows as its unpacking so u would be getting errors because of that

and i beleve ntfs has a max file size limit of 16tb i cant see anyone reaching that in 1 file tho maybe in 100+ years lol"
,nik_d,2013-03-04T19:00Z,"@gansuk
Thanks for the up. Works great on win7 x86. 

Got the gun and suit by the ds2 and me3 saves.

I have a question- Is it possible to get the other bonus items (limited edition) in this release?"
,Prime111,2013-04-12T06:07Z,"Well it works perfectly so far. Installed fine. It took  20mins to extract the rar files & to install the game. Runs smoothly on 1024x768(widescreen) resolution.
My PC Specs
Intel Core i3-2120
4GB DDR3 1333 Mhz RAM
Intel MOBO DH61HO Classic
Intel HD Graphics 2000(Integrated Processor Graphics)

I'll comment again if or when i complete the game. Thanks KaOs, gansuk & Seeders:)"
,Prime111,2013-04-18T12:26Z,"Just finished the game & all optional missions in Solo mode. NO CRASHES, NO FREEZES, NO ERRORS. WORKS PERFECTLY 100%. Awsome game ! Amazing visuals ! But a little dissapointing when it comes to the horror aspect. This game is more like an action shooter than a survivol horror video game. But all in all 100% worth the download. Thanks again to KaOs, gansuk & the seeders. Keep it up guys:)"
