,HEzooL,2013-02-13T18:23Z,"Okay, so what's the source, and quality of this release?! Talk about lacking description.. Geez!"
,HEzooL,2013-02-15T21:27Z,"Awesome movie! Obviously same source as for example Django Unchained 2012 DVDSCR X264 AAC-P2P, which is now at the top 100 list. The only downside was the ""FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION"" text, but it just came occasionally, so it didn't bother me too much. Good audio, and okay picture quality. It actually seems authentic, since it's a movie with the pre civil war timeline, so for a high def only person like me it was actually more than satisfactory anyway."
