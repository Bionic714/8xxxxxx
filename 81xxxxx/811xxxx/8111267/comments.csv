[V],STFmaryville,2013-02-06T23:35Z,"that's true. however, THIS IS the comic released by JK-Empire today and marked 2013. i know 'cause i also downloaded the same from the minutemen board.

i'm sure they'll release today's issue once they're aware of their mistake."
,reneshakil,2013-02-07T06:07Z,what can i say rather than sorry! i didn't check before upload. sorry.
[V],STFmaryville,2013-02-07T11:59Z,"they released the correct issue: http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8111609/Guarding_The_Globe_006_%28F%29_%282013%29

speaking for myself, on new comics day, i don't check the issue because there's a hurry to get so many new comics out.

thanks for your efforts reneshakil."
