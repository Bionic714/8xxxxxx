synopsis (EN)	Experience the thrill of flight combat using the motion sensitive feature of the Playstation3 controller. Whether it's a steep attacking dive or tight dog- fighting turn, the aircraft will intuitively respond to hand movements and you'll feel more like a real fighter pilot than ever before. From the Battle of Britain, through the dramatic air combat of Pearl Harbor, and all the way back to Europe, your pilot skills will create WWII history. Dominate the skies of Western Europe and the Pacific and bring your squadron of Blazing Angels back alive. Authentic WWII atmosphere. Fly low over Germany's industrial terrain for a bombing raid, strafe the islands of the Pacific, or emerge from the cloud cover over London and engage the enemy. The environment is so real you'll feel like you're the pilot in a famous WWII movie Planes are easy to handle and fun to fly. No need to attend the Air Force Academy to pilot these planes; players can jump right into air combat action without extensive tutorials.
