Runtime 30 minutes

" From the Piney Woods School in the Mississippi Delta to the Apollo Theater in Harlem, New York City, this toe-tapping music film tells the story of the swinging, multi-racial all-women jazz band of the 1940s. A 16 piece band with a strong brass section, heavy percussion, and a deep rhythmic sense, the Sweethearts were not just a novelty but featured many of the best female musicians of the day.  Starring Anna Mae Winburn, Ernestine ΓÇ£TinyΓÇ¥ Davis, Vi Burnside, Roz Cron, Evelyn McGee Stone, Helen Jones, Helen Saine, and Pauline Brady, of whom drummer Panama Francis says, ΓÇ£She played drums like a man!ΓÇ¥

Runtime 28 minutes


"  Profiling legendary jazz trumpeter Tiny Davis and her partner of over 40 years, drummer-pianist Ruby Lucas, Tiny & Ruby: Hell DivinΓÇÖ Women weaves together rare jazz recordings, live performances, vintage photographs, and narrative poetry by Cheryl Clarke.

TinyΓÇÖs contribution to jazz history is documented in an informal, intimate style in which the 78-year-old demonstrates that her chops and humor are both quite intact.

Produced and directed by Greta Schiller and Andrea Weiss. Produced in association with Channel 4 (UK)."



Title Three

Maxine Sullivan: Love To Be In Love (1988)
Runtime 47 minutes

"  Maxine Sullivan: Love to Be In Love is a lyrical film portrait of the once famous, and now, largely forgotten jazz vocalist Maxine Sullivan. Sullivan won fame in the 1930s with swing renditions of traditional songs like ΓÇ£Loch LomondΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£Annie Laurie.ΓÇ¥

By the late 1930s she became one of the foremost women in jazz.  A black, female vocalist in America, she inspired young musicians like Ella Fitzgerald. Film footage, vintage photographs, reminiscences by other jazz luminaries, as well as SullivanΓÇÖs wonderfully seductive music are used to tell her story and document her place in jazz history.  Featuring interviews with pianist Marian McPartland of NPRΓÇÖs Piano Jazz and tenor saxophonist Scott Hamilton (Blue Note Records)."
