It would be nice someone torrents it."
,surinen,2013-02-07T02:37Z,"yes, as someone said above: texture pack was released yesterday from Bethesda; can someone upload all official texture packs ? t should be around 7 gb vanilla + dawnguard + dragonborn and hearthfire if I'm correct. o mighty RELOADED help us in this dark hour !"
,surinen,2013-02-07T04:00Z,"when I said yesterday I meant central european time - it is still ""today"" for usa citizens ( and I think, presume that reloaded is from US, well doesnt matter )

what is important: these textures are very much needed, without them dragonborn is fairly poor looking"
