     The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim *Install fix* (c) Bethesda Softworks

      02/2013 :..... RELEASE.DATE .. PROTECTION .......: Steam
            - :.......... DISC(S) .. GAME.TYPE ........: RPG


Some users reported problems with the main Skyrim game not detecting our
latest release, the Dragonborn addon.

This can happen if the main game is not installed/configured correctly.
For instance by game files being moved, bad or missing launcher config, etc.

This small utility should fix that. Use it if you have a clean or broken
install that can't detect data packs in the launcher menu.

To use, run it in admin mode, select where you have the main Skyrim game
installed, and click Save.


1. Unrar.
2. Run the program in admin mode and select where you have installed Skyrim.
3. Play the game, which can now load DLCs.
4. Support the software developers. If you like this game, BUY IT!
