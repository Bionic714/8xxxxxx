Thanks! Just out of curiosity, why do you include Rush's commercials? I don't mean the parodies (those ROCK), I mean Rush's commercials for flowers, tax services, etc. I don't care if it's Rush's voice, it's just a scripted commercial. Not complaining, just asking....

....rush's commercials are part of the program sent to the stations...most of the time they are very tightly placed behind the show and there is almost never any room to cut it out without hearing the cut and you get a hiccup in the sound..there is seldom any dead space like with local commercials..i can fade it out and that is very tedious...plus he does well with those commercials...to take out all the commercials takes me about 1.5 hours....lately, if i leave in the commercials that are midway thru each 1/2 hour...1/4 after....1/4 till....which are the floating breaks..and can be anywhere....i can get it done in about 40 minutes...i cut out the last break...the bottom break...leave in the one minute news update...and the top of the hour news break...that make it about 45 minutes for each piece...to get it all out makes it about 39 minutes...and takes almost another hour...to get it to where i can't hear the cut with a fade in and fade out....this show ends at 3pm mountain time and is 2 hours later than the national broadcast and the program engineer [?] has been excellent in not stepping on the show because he's got 2 hours to map it out before they put it on the air...he then fills in the gaps with music...i could upload this this in 10 minutes if i left it alone...left it as is with all the commercials...instead of 1.5 to 2 hours later with all the editing...i'm not sure if it is worth it...this broadcast with commercials and all, is more accurate than most stations...almost never do they delete rush with an overrun...koa radio is a huge station in colorado and has a news presence , that news update is good to keep if you are listening months later ...so....would you like the show fast..uncut..or 2 hours later with most commercials gone ?...either way is still better than the podcast because the podcast seems stuffed in a vacuum with no ads and no music ...today i am just going to fade it in and out and not try to silently remove the commercials..
