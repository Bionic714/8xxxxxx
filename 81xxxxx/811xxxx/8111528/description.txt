Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site :: On the Wednesday, February 6 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex runs down the police state's continued expansion evidenced in more unconstitutional checkpoints being set up by the Florida Highway Patrol and the revelation that drones can and will target American citizens. 

On today's show, Alex welcomes journalist and editor of PrisonPlanet.com Paul Joseph Watson to discuss the nature of reality as top research has shown it may be a giant computer simulation. 

We'll also welcome Jennifer Stahl, one of the ladies arrested for denying smart meter installers access to her property. 

Alex will also give his take on the Piers Morgan - Ted Nugent exchange and cover other major news items.
