[V],STFmaryville,2013-02-08T03:09Z,"DC has just announced this:

""Fury Of The Firestorm, ""Ravagers,"" ""Savage Hawkman,"" ""Deathstroke,"" ""Sword Of Sorcery"" and ""Team 7"" are being cancelled."
,jns102,2013-02-08T04:21Z,"They can't cancel Team 7 and Sword of Sorcery, they just started and deathstroke was getting better with Justin jordan"
,MatsuMatt,2013-02-08T20:12Z,"Dear mirrormaster82,

I was wondering if i could ask you for a request? I't would make me so happy if this were possible.

I would love it if you could upload all 15 of the Battle Royale graphic novels in either cbr or cbz files...

There is a pdf torrent of it here on the bay, but its been compiled in one huge mess which i dont like.

Ideally it'd be awesome to see it split into the 15 books, all reading right to left (as intended)

I actually already own 13 of the books in physical form but the last few seem to be avoiding me, if you could upload the full set in the format mentioned above i would be really grateful...
Keep up the great work, you're my number 1 stop for comics :)"
,whoresman1,2013-02-08T23:26Z,Thanks man!

[V],STFmaryville,2013-02-09T01:10Z,"my favorite part of that bullshit interview is when Bob Harras says:

""The thing is, we want everyone who works for DC to be as happy as possible, to feel the creative process is as enjoyable as possible. If there are communication problems with talent, we will always work on it to improve our messaging, but on the whole, I think sometimes there are going to be disagreements. Sometimes there are going to be agreements -- it's all part of the editorial process.""

Being a fucking asshole to your freelancers is not an editorial process, lmao."
,seb14,2013-02-09T04:58Z,you are the best uploader ever
,jns102,2013-02-09T18:59Z,"STFmaryville, what kills me is that Bobbi chase says he cancelling team 7, deathstroke, and sorcery so that Justin Jordan can focus on superboy and christy marx on birds of prey when they have Geoff Johns on several justice league books, aquaman, and green lanter, Scott synder on batman, talon, and an unnamed superman project, and jeff lemire on justice league dark, animal man and green arrow."
,comrsrch,2013-02-09T19:39Z,"I'm a researcher who would like to chat with comic book preservationists about scanner tags. Can anyone suggest the best way to approach people without angering either the scanners or the torrent community? Is there an IRC channel I should find? I'm just trying to find one or two safe, entry points that won't anger the community. Thanks in advance for any help you can provide. "
[V],STFmaryville,2013-02-09T21:21Z,"jns102, i know! it's an obvious lie. i did like the interviewer calling them out on cancelling a monthly (i, vampire) which had debuted a trade paperback at #4 on the new york times best sellers ...

oh and just for the record, bobbie chase is a chick. i kinda like her because she edited g.i. joe when i started reading comics, and when she edited she-hulk, bobbie stood up to john byrne and he quit. lol"
,trickster74,2013-02-10T22:35Z,Mirrormaster- I notice you're a fairly prolific uploader. I'm looking for Bill Willingham's old Pantheon books. Any chance you might have it?
,nomad1980,2013-02-10T22:52Z,Anyone have Non Humans 2?
,Azex88,2013-02-13T20:37Z,Anyone know when new 52 week 76 pack will be up?
