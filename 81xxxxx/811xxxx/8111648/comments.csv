Didn't really mind that the sound got a little bit out of sync, just fix the audio delay in VLC... you're all so greedy."
[V],GunningHawk90,2013-02-07T08:44Z,"Yup, 4100ms or 4.1 seconds does the job.

Thanks Kaozgamer and VTV :)"

,dodo_dudut,2013-02-23T21:34Z,"Great episode, nice plot so far. Storyline is intelligent and i wouldn't change it even a bit. Quality - A10 V10. I usually watch everything at film.plotar.org	because they always have HD but they don't have tv shows so having TPB for TVshows is great, thnx!"
