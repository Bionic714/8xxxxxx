Out of prison and finally back on Earth, Sela looks to return to some semblance of the life she lived before her exile. Intent on finding her daughter, Sela is sidetracked by an old friend who shows her that the Earth needs her and her special gifts more than ever. In a return to the format of the early issues of GFT, Sela teaches another Highborn a lesson by telling a new version of the classic fairy tale "The Seal Skin."
