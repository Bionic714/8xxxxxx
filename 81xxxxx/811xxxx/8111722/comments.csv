,chauntay01,2013-02-08T01:33Z,This isnt a avi file. So does anyone know how to convert this file if possible?
,upyerbut,2013-02-08T11:14Z,"Hey chauntay01, here's a better idea than asking for help in the comments section, brace yourself ..... its called a search engine most commonly known as google. Just type in ""convert to .avi"" its not fuckin brain surgery to search for things you don't know how to do that's how the majority of people learn you muppet :0)"
