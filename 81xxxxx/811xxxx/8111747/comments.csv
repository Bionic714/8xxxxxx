You can save a lot of bandwidth by not deleting the other torrent's data. Only delete that torrent. Then start this one. After it has pulled in the magnet link info stop it. Generally at this point the torrent client will see the old data in the folder of the same name and check it and then use it as a start. In my old uTorrent it didn't seem to be doing that, so I stopped it and right clicked and choose Force Re-Check. It checked the data and found the few missing spots. I started it up and it completed in a few minutes."

Regarding CD1 of Mann Alive, this is the note at avaxhome:

""CD1: Attention! Here's a manufacturing error. Disc 1 is not presented inside the box, but Disc 2 has included twice! Unfortunately. Maybe sometimes it will be fixed."""
