,torviscantor,2013-03-16T01:23Z,I have found a possible SRT file for the english speaking. I will post link if it ends up working; I do not want to make the mistake of posting a useless file-link.
,torviscantor,2013-03-16T01:26Z,I may have found a possible SRT file for the english speaking viewers. I will post a link if it successfully works; no need to waste another persons time.

,Darker666,2013-04-14T15:15Z,May this be a change on the remote side or some mistake on @torviscantor's side the subtitle in the link is Greek! Not english as @torviscantor states.
