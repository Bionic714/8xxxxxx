NOTES:

S01E08 is already available as WS.DSR, but this cap is encoded at the best quality possible, at 1080p.  This file has been tested and plays perfect. If it doesn't work for you, then your equipment cannot play 1080p.


VERY SPECIAL thanks to Reb for the file. 

And a special F**K OFF to users like 'CyndiLauperNow' who continue to take the files and claim them as his/her own work.  I am all for sharing, but give credit where credit is due.  Reb made this file, not you.

Share this file anywhere you want. But please don't rename it.
