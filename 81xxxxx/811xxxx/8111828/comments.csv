Do they have a contest going against Boundless?  ;-)"
[V],RubrumPopulus,2013-02-07T03:34Z,"Haha. You're not kidding lol.  I go into my LCS each week, and they keep their higher priced variants ($40-$175) in a case up front.  Each week they got more and more Marvel NOW variants.  They can't get rid of them fast enough.  6 months ago that case had like 5 issues in there. Now it's got variants piled ontop of variants LOL  Most being Marvel"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-02-07T04:55Z,"sometimes i see companies hold back a MUCH BETTER cover as a variant. i uploaded grimm fairy tales 82 a few hours ago. the inside front cover shows variants and there's a limited Billy Tucci (Shi, Heroes for Hire) cover that was better than the 2 ""regular"" covers COMBINED.  [shakes head]"
