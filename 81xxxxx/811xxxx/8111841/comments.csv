,HKCannibal,2013-02-07T05:04Z,Thanks ettv!
,Karasuman,2013-02-07T12:06Z,"Thanks.

nazgull, I assume you are retarded. Uploader had nothing to do with that inaccurate sync. Eztv, vtv, ettv, they all got it from the same source, in this case - LOL. But so what if LOL made a mistake, 99 percent of their work is excellent."

Someone took the time to record this, edit it, convert it and then upload it etc all so the likes of you and I can get it and enjoy all for the rock bottom price of seeding it atleast once. Maybe next time you can show a little more gratitude and respect by saying something on the lines of "" Many thanks for the upload but I would like to draw your attention to.... OK."
