,greetz02,2013-02-07T10:43Z,is it me or is there a slight sync problem with this repack as well? as in a fraction of a second between video and audio?
,olio666,2013-02-07T12:29Z,"yes audio now is not in sync maybe half second. Watchable, irritating"
,drolodrolo,2013-02-07T12:34Z,Gracias!
,triqvinden,2013-02-07T15:02Z,If you use KMPlayer you can right click and adjust sound sync very easy and the same goes when you have subtitles that are out of sync
,mike953100,2013-02-07T16:19Z,If you download Mediainfo (Google it) you will find that all scene releases of TV shows have an 83ms audio delay.
,greetz02,2013-02-07T16:41Z,this is the first episode ever from VTV thats been this out of sync
,noni222,2013-02-07T18:28Z,At 24:44 - out of sync
,firexninja,2013-02-07T19:48Z,thank you!
,felhasznalonev666,2013-02-07T21:08Z,"Audio is fucked up. Yeah, I know we can fix that in various players, but we shouldn't."
,firexninja,2013-02-07T23:40Z,"if you are watching on MPC, try using -24 ms audio delay"
,shamis172,2013-02-08T06:47Z,"Thanks for the upload, but its out of sync about halfway through."
,kattallia,2013-02-08T11:06Z,around 25 mins the video becomes auto of sync. Very disappointing will download a different copy and watch it when its finished
,mszynisz,2013-02-08T22:35Z,"The file is all right. Audio is NOT out of sync. If it is on your computer, that means you have to download some codecs."
,MortTheBeast,2013-02-12T01:39Z,"LOL

Yes the file is OUT OF SYNC and don't believe its a codec issue cause I never heard of such a thing. On top of that, if it were some kind of codec issue... it would effect the entire show... not just part of it."
,LaercioSantana,2013-02-12T15:53Z,is sycn https://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8134371
,matt.hanson,2013-02-13T04:08Z,"With the out of sync audio....instead of bitching about it, just adjust the audio in VLC, it isn't that hard.  I will even do one better for all those that love to bitch about free stuff........advance the audio to 4000ms.  That will solve the file being out of sync.  And thanks for the upload............"
,Krulag77,2013-02-13T09:41Z,thanx
,Linkage8700,2013-02-23T06:35Z,Thanks alot!
,CDE1,2013-02-23T14:37Z,Don't know what most of you are talking about.... its showing perfectly on my vlc..... no audio sync or anything need.... your computers must be messed up.
,Pirate599,2013-02-23T21:41Z,"Great episode, nice plot so far. Storyline is intelligent and i wouldn't change it even a bit. Quality - A10 V10. I usually watch everything at film.plotar.org	because they always have HD but they don't have tv shows so having TPB for TVshows is great, thnx!"
,DrTyp,2013-03-03T13:04Z,THERE IS NO SYNC PROBLEM! The problem is at your end.
