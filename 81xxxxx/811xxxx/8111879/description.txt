Some english is spoken in the movie


The crew of a Danish cargo ship is hijacked by Somali pirates who proceed to engage in escalating negotiations with authorities in Copenhagen. 



Remember to seed so others can get the same enjoyment of the movie that you've got.
Keep in mind I can not give full speed to all, so if you're one of the lucky ones, help seed.

And remember, because I upload in winRAR files, it does not mean that it is "VIRUS".
