ΓÇ£Eyes on the prize/reboot the mission/I lost my sight but not the visionΓÇ¥ sings the ClashΓÇÖs Mick Jones on the chorus of the WallflowersΓÇÖ debut single from the bandΓÇÖs first album in five years. But even though Dylan Jr. released two largely acoustic sets under his own name since, this continuation (letΓÇÖs not label it a comeback) reunites the singer/songwriter with co-founder/keyboardist Rami Jaffee and long time bassist Greg Richling for another go-round of lyrically challenging, tightly produced and played roots rock and roll.

The younger Dylan has admitted that the solo troubadour thing was only a career side road and being the frontman of a touring band remains his first love. Judging from these impressive results, he has picked up where he left off five years ago with an album that fits seamlessly into the WallflowersΓÇÖ existing five disc catalog. Despite the recent promotional blitz, a change of label from Interscope to Columbia and a not particularly indicative single that sounds like a pretty good Clash B-side, little has altered in the WallflowersΓÇÖ basic sonic template. JaffeeΓÇÖs contributions remain mostly buried in the mix, making this a Dylan project in all but its name, although the extended layoff has provided a refreshed energy in the crisp soul undertones to songs such as the jaunty ΓÇ£ItΓÇÖs a Dream,ΓÇ¥ the funky, nearly danceable ΓÇ£Misfits and Lovers,ΓÇ¥ the frisky Motown vibe of ΓÇ£Have Mercy on Him NowΓÇ¥ and the anthemic, Springsteen inspired ΓÇ£Love is a Country.ΓÇ¥ J. DylanΓÇÖs grainy croon remains instantly recognizable. Whether there is anything here that will capture the radio waves like 1996ΓÇÖs classic Bringing Down the Horse ΓÇô- home of the WallflowersΓÇÖ three biggest hits that are still played on whatever rock stations are leftΓÇôremains to be seen. But DylanΓÇÖs talent for matching, smart plentiful (arguably too much so) words to chiming melodies supported by a solid, unpretentious rock band and sung with conviction has returned.

Unlike other backing outfits like the E Street Band or PettyΓÇÖs Heartbreakers, the largely faceless Wallflowers donΓÇÖt have an identifiable sound. Guitarist Stuart Mathis gets few chances to strut whatever stuff he might have in DylanΓÇÖs tightly constructed songs, only two of which break the four minute mark. Dylan remains the star of the show, spitting out sharp, somewhat obtuse lyrics that push rockers like the opening ΓÇ£Hospital for SinnersΓÇ¥ and the following ΓÇ£Misfits and Lovers,ΓÇ¥ the latter a zippy track with a singalong chorus and a rhythm that borrows from ΓÇ£This is Radio ClashΓÇ¥ΓÇÖs insistent backbeat.

Haters might cry ΓÇ£retroΓÇ¥ but there are no false notes here. Like his dad, DylanΓÇÖs earthy style never tried to jump on any trend or bandwagon. It makes this new material reminiscent of everything that has come before. More atmospheric elements like the story song of ΓÇ£Constellation BluesΓÇ¥ benefit from producer Jay JoyceΓÇÖs hands off style that keeps DylanΓÇÖs lyrics clear and upfront while the band lays down a throbbing undercurrent complete with mournful slide guitar. It mirrors the songΓÇÖs downbeat account of a small town soldier who questions his no-future life, told from the viewpoint of its disheartened protagonist. The demonic lyrics of ΓÇ£DevilΓÇÖs WaltzΓÇ¥ are reflected in its ominous swamp beat, guitarist MathisΓÇÖ distorted solo and DylanΓÇÖs leather tough singing. JaffeeΓÇÖs keyboards, that have previously played a minor part in the albumΓÇÖs sonics, lead the closing ΓÇ£One Set of Wings,ΓÇ¥ urged on by new drummer Jack IronsΓÇÖ (ex-Red Hot Chili Peppers) forceful attack.
