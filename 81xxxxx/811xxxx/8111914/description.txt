"Betrayal"

Cyrus Vanch, a nefarious criminal, is 
recently released from prison and intends to 
re-secure his position as leader of the 
underworld. His first step is to take down 
his biggest opponent in the city - Arrow. 
Meanwhile, Oliver shows Moira his father's 
notebook and questions her about the names 
on the list. Thea is miserable as she starts 
her internship with Laurel at the legal aid 
office and Detective Lance makes a deadly 
mistake that puts Laurel in the crosshairs 
of Vanch.
