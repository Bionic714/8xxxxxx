KMSNano is an Offline KMS Activator that emulates a KMS server in the memory of
your computer and sends activation data back and forth attempting to activate
volume versions of Windows and Office. I have personally activated KMSNano without
having my lan drivers even installed on a fresh install of Windows 7.

There are other earlier versions that may or may not work currently.
You should always check for the latest version before using.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Activates:
Windows Vista Business/Enterprise Default/N/VL
Windows 7 Pro/Enterprise Default/N/VL
Windows 8 Pro/Enterprise Default/N/VL
Windows Server Std/Data 2008/2008R2/2012
Office/OfficeVL 2010/2013.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------Please read this non-KMS Windows versions list-------
Retail-Only Versions of windows that will **NOT** activate are:
Vista Starter/Homebasic/Homepremium/Ultimate - Default/N/E
7 Starter/Homebasic/Homepremium/Ultimate - Default/N/E
8 core/coreN/ProWMC
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Requirements: . NET 4.0 or Windows 8

Instructions:

1. Extract the zip file or open it in file explorer.
2. Run KMSnano_setup.exe It will install to a folder, add shortcuts,
and trigger install. This checks activation when you log on and will
Run the Activator if 30 days or left are less on activation
3. Wait about 45-60secs for an initial activation if you aren't activated
(It takes longer for Retail to VL Office 2013 conversion)
4. Done. Run the Check link on start menu to verify your activation.

For Windows 8, it can take a minute or two of doing system things for the
watermark to go away. You don't need to reboot. Activators that require
a reboot are hacks and you should immediately run a "SFC /SCANNOW" if
you have used one. (SFC is the System File Checker) Esp. KJ Hacktivator

Note that Pre-Release versions of Office or Windows will NEVER activate.
You can try the UpDown8 v1.3.exe tool if you have a version that is
unsupported like enterprise trial version, but you use at your own risk.
(Inside kmsnano.exe - Extract using 7z or winrar to use)

Why use this program over any other activation method?
-It does not modify any of your system files.
-Because it's not a crack or a hack.
-Because it's the only way to get legit activation without using legit servers.
-Did I mention it activates ALL KMS activation software?

Change Log:
- Fixed autocharged.
- Fixed minor bugs with O2010.
- Faster.

All is Done (for now).

Recommendations:

- Disable SmartScreen.
- Disable microsoft security updates.
- Make exceptions to KMSnano.exe and %temp%KMSnano in Antivirus.

Included is KMSnano Documentation v13.1.pdf
Please read this first if you have any problems.
There is a link to a log.cmd which just opens kmsnano.log from the
temp directory. You may want this if you need to relay some info
on the MDL boards about an unsupported language or something.

(Big Salute to heldigard and all the peeps who contributed to this project)
Over the Rainbow is gone and the program currently has an applause track when
the activator finishes. You can extract to a subdirectory and edit
manual_silent.cmd and remove the /music line. Then copy triggerkms.exe to
that subdirectory and run "TriggerKMS 31 manual_silent.cmd /install /battery"
to set up the activator to re-trigger without the applause if you don't like
scaring the hell out of yourself in 5 months.
