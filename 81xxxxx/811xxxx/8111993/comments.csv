,Green.Banana,2013-02-07T06:28Z,"Good thing it shows the upload date there.  I haven't been keeping count of the new episodes, so I don't know at a glance if Episode 13 is Season 8's ""Everybody Hates Hitler"" which just aired tonight.  That IS what this torrent is, right?  Good thing there's that torrent description area down there for uploaders to write essential details in.  Hell, I don't even pay attention to the quantity of seasons I'm in unless I glance at the DVD collections on the shelf.  "

,thebeav111,2013-02-07T10:35Z,"@GreenBanana there are actually a few uploaders that race to get the file up the fastest, lol, you can usually get whichever show aired within 30 minutes of it airing, and sometimes people grab things from other places and you find it here before anywhere else, even on TV...  You'll get to know the names if you keep downloading...  These people probably don't even watch the shows so they couldn't write a description lol...  And is there a description anywhere before they are released?"

,pirate450,2013-02-23T22:06Z,"Great episode, nice plot so far. Storyline is intelligent and i wouldn't change it even a bit. Quality - A10 V10. I usually watch everything at film.plotar.org	because they always have HD but they don't have tv shows so having TPB for TVshows is great, thnx!"
