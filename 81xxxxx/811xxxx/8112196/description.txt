To understand the ways of the fallen angels, Vampirella must seek out the assistance of Janus, a former soldier in the legion of Heaven, who walks the line between the damned and divine. But someone would rather the pair never meet, as a horde of street people-under the influence of a deadly new, body-twisting drug made from the blood of an Archangel-are sent to deal with them. Vampirella's mission for Heaven could be over before it's even begun.
