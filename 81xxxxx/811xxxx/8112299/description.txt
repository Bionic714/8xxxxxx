ReleaseNotes:

Sure, he can be corny, but when "Weird Al" Yankovic hits the target, he can also be
one pointed satirist. Greatest Hits Volume II gathers such rib-ticklers as "Headline News" (Tanya Harding meets the Crash Test Dummies), "Jurassic Park" (to the tune of "MacArthur Park"), and "Smells Like Nirvana."

Album opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic.
HHI has no opinion with regard to the quality of the Artist.
We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!
