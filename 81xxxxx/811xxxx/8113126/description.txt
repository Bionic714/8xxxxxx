2013 debut album from the Dutch multi-instrumentalist and producer. The 12 tracks that make up Cabinet Of Curiosities deftly explore the loss of innocence in a far more accomplished and mature way than you would expect from a 24 yr old, fulfilling the promises made by his first two singles. His melodic palette colors music with a more UK-sensibility, where minor chords and plush harmonies brush up against strings, mellotrons, harpsichords and an occasional squeezebox. The overall feel is more Zombies than Left Banke and more Nirvana and Billy Nicholls than Beach Boys and Van Dyke Parks.
