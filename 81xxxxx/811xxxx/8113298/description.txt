A "silent" issue in homage to the classic G.I. JOE #21. But this time it's Storm Shadow in ninja action. He's survived the massacre of the Arashikage clan and is seeking payback. But he needs to visit the Hard Master before he heads out on the road to vengeance and, possibly, his own destruction. It's swords and shadows as an era comes to an end.
