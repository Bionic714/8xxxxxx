,greebomc,2013-02-11T22:39Z,"Love 2000ad. I used to read this all the time when I lived in the UK, it's been a harder to find over here so I gave up. (local comic shop is 15 miles away and closed whenever I get a day off). This is awesome, a huge thanks."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-02-12T03:15Z,really glad you all enjoy it. will try to ensure that it's posted whenever Nahga or other scanners release it.
,Kick-bak_AU,2013-02-25T07:43Z,Thanks for these. Used to read them back in the early 80's
