Even as the tide of battle turns there is tragedy in Red Seas: Fire Across The Deep by Ian Edginton and Steve Yeowell, the bridges are down but that doesn't stop Bill putting the peddle to the metal in Savage: Rise Like Lions by Pat Mills and Patrick Goddard, clockwork zombies meet the computer age in Ampney Crucis: The Entropy Tango by Ian Edginton and Simon Davis, and it's out of the frying pan and into the fire for Johnny Alpha in Strontium Dog: Mutant Spring.
