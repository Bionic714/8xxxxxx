Bigby Wolf takes center stage in what might be the most action-packed FABLES story to date. Bigby embarks on a quest through the American Heartland to find a new location for Fabletown. In his wanderings, Bigby stumbles across a small town named Story City, that, amazingly enough, seems to be populated by werewolves. Who are they and where did they come from? They aren't Fables, but they sure aren't normal mundys. They seem to already know and revere Bigby, but at the same time they've captured and caged him ΓÇô but why? Unravelling the many mysteries of Story City may cost Bigby more than his life.
