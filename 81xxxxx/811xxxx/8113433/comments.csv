We got S01E07: Give the Guy a Hand (aka Im Namen der Ehre).
Thanks, mate."
,BigDanna,2013-02-08T07:57Z,"I'm so lost.  I want to watch the whole season but I see the episode order varies depending on who aired it.  Wiki has a chart (see info below) but can anyone who's seen them all comment on which is best or if it matters much what order we watch them? 

“Confusingly… all have or plan to air the series in a different episode order...

French order:
1 The General's Daughter
2 Trojan Horsepower
3 Harvest
4 Dead Drop
5 Sharks
6 12 Hours
7 City of Love
8 Switch
9 Hot Ice
10 Give the Guy a Hand
11 Cherchez La Femme
12 Payback

Canadian order: 3 1 4 5 8 11 9 10 6 7 12 2
German order:  1 7 2 4 6 12 9 3 8 11 10 5

It is unclear at this point what the ""proper"", intended order for the episodes is… Based on the chronology of events, the Canadian release most likely carries the correct order of episodes.”"
,BigDanna,2013-02-08T08:20Z,"And yes, thank you for ""Give a Guy a Hand"".  Appears this is the ONLY torrent that is actually complete with ALL 12 episodes, no matter what the order..."

2) by Lcouchjr at 2013-01-15 05:02 CET: 
01 Trojan Horsepower
02 Payback
03 The General's Daughter
04 Harvest
05 Dead Drop
06 Hot Ice
07 Give The Guy A Hand
08 Sharks
09 City of Love
10 Switch
11 12 Hours
12 Cherchez La Femme

Lcouchjr's is complete with all 12 episodes.
I don't know which one is more suitable."
,zero1zero,2013-02-11T12:10Z,"The Canadian releases have extra scenes that are not in the German releases. For example, in the Canadian airing of ""The General's Daughter"", there are scenes involving that Interpol(?) female agent who is tracking Frank Martin. The German version does not have these scenes at all. 

The Canadian versions also show more graphic violent scenes that were cut out of the German versions. Ex. in ""The General's Daughter"" Frank stabs a guy through the neck with a wooden stick. Canadian version shows a closeup. German version it is cut out. So it seems like the Canadian releases are better and are airing in the correct order."
,taxentaxen,2013-02-12T12:35Z,"I just noticed Lcouchjr's order is the same as Canadian TV order. Closely compared it with Maxpayne33's list, the differences are:

01 Trojan
++++++++++
02 General
03 Harvest
04 Dead Drop
++++++++++
05 Sharks
++++++++++
06 12 Hours
++++++++++
07 City of Love
08 Switch
++++++++++
09 Hot Ice
++++++++++
10 Payback
++++++++++
11 Cherchez

?? Give The Guy A Hand

A group of episodes separated with ++++++++++ has no difference.
We just need to check if there is any inconsistency between two episodes separated by ++++++++++ in Maxpayne33. If there is, Maxpayne33's order is wrong in that point. That does not necessarily means Canadian TV order is correct, though."
,AlfredHugecock,2013-02-24T19:08Z,there is a place waiting in heaven for the uploader.  this show is ridiculously cliche yet mindlessly awesome at the same time.
