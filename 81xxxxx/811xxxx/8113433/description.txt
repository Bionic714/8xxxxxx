 For anyone not familiar with this series, it is based on
   The Transporter movie franchise.  This series was co-produced by
   serveral networks from France, Germany, Canada, and USA. This series
   began airing on RTL in Germany on 11 October 2012, on M6 in France on
   6 December 2012, and on HBO Canada in Canada on 4 January 2013.  It
   is scheduled to air in the USA on HBO/Cinemax during Summer 2013.
   
   This is an English language series.  German and French dubbed audio
   tracks were produced later for German and French audiences.
   
   The aired episode order varies between Germany, France, and Canada.
   Although these releases were encoded from the BluRays released in
   Germany, we have chosen to follow the air order of the Canadian
   broadcasts.  2HD has already pred broadcast rips of the first 6
   episodes which aired in Canada, so it makes sense to follow this
   sequence to be consistent for those looking to watch this show.
   
   For reference, here is the episode order.  Titles are listed with
   their English titles first, and the German titles in parentheses.
   
   S01E01: Trojan Horsepower       (aka Tod dem Fortschritt!)
   S01E02: Payback                 (aka Vergeltung!)
   S01E03: The General's Daughter  (aka Eine Neue Mission!)
   S01E04: Harvest                 (aka Vaterliebe)
   S01E05: Dead Drop               (aka Plan B)
   S01E06: Hot Ice                 (aka Blutdiamanten)
   S01E07: Give the Guy a Hand     (aka Im Namen der Ehre)
   S01E08: Sharks                  (aka Gro√°e Haie und Kleine Fische)
   S01E09: City of Love            (aka Die Letzten Stunden von Paris)
   S01E10: Switch                  (aka Echt Falsch)
   S01E11: 12 Hours                (aka Wettlauf Gegen die Zeit)
   S01E12: Cherchez La Femme       (same title in German)
   
   As an additional note, since these releases are from the German BluRay,
   the episode titles shown briefly in the video are their German titles.
   All other text we can see (e.g. intro, credits) are in English.
