Soundtrack to the 2008 film by Wim Wenders. Wenders wrote the screenplay to measure for the lead singer of Die Toten Hosen: Campino plays the highly successful photographer Finn, whose life goes off the rails and who ends up coming face to face with Death (personified by Dennis Hopper) before finally encountering love. The film is also an homage to music with a special guest appearance by Lou Reed and with songs that were in part written specially for this film, including Nick Cave (with Grinderman), Portishead, Iron & Wine, Calexico, Jason Collett, Beth Gibbons, Beirut,  Thom, Get Well Soon and Monta.
