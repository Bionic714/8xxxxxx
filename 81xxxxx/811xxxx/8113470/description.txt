 Country Duppy, an outrageous comedy rich in Caribbean folklore.

The action begins when Mammie MacIntosh, rumoured to be a powerful obeah-woman, dies in her small, rural village in the district of Bamboo Belly, Jamaica. As the neighbours gather in anticipation of the free food and drinks to be served after the funeral, strange things start to happen.

When MammieΓÇÖs coffin refuses to be pulled up the hill to the grave, funeral attendees are forced to enlist the help of a cow. But with the weight of the coffin surpassing the animalΓÇÖs strength, the coffin is dropped, causing it to break open and MammieΓÇÖs duppy to escape.

For unknown reasons, the ghost flees and takes over the property belonging to Miss Beatrice, the village dressmaker and self-professed non-believer in ΓÇ£duppy storiesΓÇ¥. The presence of the unwanted guest forces Miss Beatrice to call on the local obeah-man, Bredda Zacky, to control the situation.

More humorous than it is scary, this Jamaican ghost story, written by skilled playwright, Aston Cooke, is an experience worth having.
