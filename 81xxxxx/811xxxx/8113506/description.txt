Twenty years after her landmark
Watermark album, Enya's seventh
studio disc, 'And Winter Came' continues a phenomenally
successful career that has included more than 70 million
albums sold worldwide. 'And Winter Came' is an enchanting
evocation of the changing landscape of winter as well as the
festive cheer of the holidays. One of the most successful
female artists of all-time, and second only to U2 as the
biggest selling Irish artist in history, Enya brings her
beguiling and ethereal music to bear on the darkest and yet
most hopeful season with 'And Winter Came'
