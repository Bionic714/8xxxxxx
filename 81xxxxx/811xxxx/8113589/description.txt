Group 2 - Cousins

Sam and Chris banter like brothers, but despite growing up not far from each other, it's only in the past few years these cousins have got to know one another.

Sam, 26 and Chris, 24 grew up in bayside Melbourne and really only saw each other at Christmas or at the occasional family function.

It was only after Sam came back from living in Europe a coupleΓÇ¿ of years ago that he looked up his cousin Chris, who is studying exercise, movement and sports marketing, works in a gym part-time and is a committed and accomplished triathlete.

"I got back from overseas and had lost five kilos. I'd been into the gym but wasn't over there, I'd done a year of drinking and smoking, and thought I had to cut the smoking. Chris was into cycling so I thought maybe I'd get into that, we started hanging out and that's when we reconnected," explains Sam.

It was only Christmas 2011 that they discovered their shared loveΓÇ¿ of cooking. "Chris brought some dessert, a meringue kind of thing," says Sam, who works in AFL merchandising. "We started talking about it. I said I liked cooking and now we cook for the family. We get them together for lunch."

Sam says, "I'm more your savoury person. I like doing meats; I like Asian food. I'm pretty good with a knife and I like making pasta."

Chris likes to do desserts. "I'm pretty good with pastry. I always made scones for our great grandmother and it went from there. ΓÇ¿I always used to help cook desserts for my mum and dad's dinner parties and I loved it because everyone always loves dessert.ΓÇ¿ The glory at the end!"

Together in the kitchen their personalities shine through. "In general life I consider myself more relaxed than Sam," says Chris. "In the kitchen Sam is 100 miles an hour and I'm the complete opposite, I'm ΓÇÿYeah, it'll be right.'"
Chris, who is currently single, has other talents: he is a singer, plays guitar and keyboards and is recording a demo.

Sam, also single, is often out and about in his St Kilda neighbourhood, determined to make the most of life.

"I had a couple of mates who were really young when they nearly died from cancer and it changed me, "ΓÇ¿he says. "I realised you had to take your opportunities."
