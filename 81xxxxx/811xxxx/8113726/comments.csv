,Ahlat,2013-02-07T15:07Z,Is this a new digital scan? I have the one from the large Grant Morrison file on TPB. I haven't read it yet and was just wondering if this is of superior quality.
,k_fahrer,2013-02-07T15:11Z,thank you!
[V],STFmaryville,2013-02-07T15:12Z,This is the same set Ahlat.
,Hamster-X,2013-02-07T15:18Z,"No, this isn't a new digital scan. I don't have the other one you mentioned, but I'd say it's likely the same one. Hope this helps."
,Ahlat,2013-02-07T15:59Z,"Oh okay thanks, I have the other one downloaded so I won't get this one. Though thanks for the upoad anyways."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-02-07T16:17Z,"if anyone's intereted he's referring to http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7264798/ from last year. a morrison megapack if ever there was one. it's a bit misleading though -- it includes audio and video files, and he didn't write all those 52 and doom patrol issues."

,Hamster-X,2013-02-07T19:58Z,"Yeah, I was kinda surprised this wasn't uploaded (which it is)... just me and my noob searching skills sometimes lol"
