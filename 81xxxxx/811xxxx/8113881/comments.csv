,Tegra3,2013-02-07T15:50Z,"Thank you, Please the PC Version. Hey thenoobish do you work alone is in a group meaning a scene?"
,Smallz94,2013-02-07T15:52Z,Yes!!!
[V],thenoobish,2013-02-07T16:07Z,Tegra: I'm not quite sure what you meant. I work alone. I have no connections to the scene. I'm only posting scene material. :-)
,cyberdude83,2013-02-07T16:28Z,PC  VERSION ...PLEASE......PLEASE ......PLEASE
,DJohnnyBoy,2013-02-07T16:59Z,hey can some one please let me know how to put this on the xbox please??
,djnforce9,2013-02-07T17:18Z,"I could get this but I'll wait for the PC version. It'll look far superior and being an FPS, mouse+keyboard control is more for me.

Still though, kind of neat that the potential to play this is already available before release. Much like Halo 4 which I played through a month before it was in stores."
,lakers2012,2013-02-07T17:26Z,"Hey Johnnyboy your console has to be modified either by jtag/rgh or softmodded using Iextreme drive flashing in order to get the game on your console. If you are wanting it done, i have the perfect person for the job. PM me and i will let you know "

,Smallz94,2013-02-08T20:34Z,Yea it kinds of mess up with the voices and the weapon firing but hey i still like it. Quick question ... i just burned this last night. Do i have to burn it again when it comes out on Tuesday so i can play online? I mean of course when abgx360 will verify on Tuesday so ppl can play online safety but what happens i dont burn again and just play my no safety online playing disc. I did this before before and nothing happen to me. I dont want to waste my verbatim discs.

,turntable83,2013-02-09T03:56Z,"Stupid elitist PC gamers. Talk shit about consoles then come crying to the xbox section when they want a game. 

Fuckers remind me of some kids with honda cars trying to make them go faster with a spoiler and loud muffler. Grow up and get something made to play games (console). Quit dicking around making ATI or Nvidia or Asus rich, suckers. All you do is buy their powerful cards to use brute force to play purposely non-optimized games. Of course all that matters to you derps is a couple extra pixels.

Well, when the scene finally releases for PC, you turds can enjoy the console's leftovers (port). "

I don't have nothing against PC, just the stupid expensive elitist hobby of playing games on it. 

Yeah, this game was made on PC, but kind of silly that the PC gets the console port! That's cause developers support REAL gamers first. Not silly boys with overexpensive rigs. 

Anyways, you PC gamers keep howling for your shitty port to hit the scene, like jackals taking off with the scraps. "
,sp4wners,2013-02-09T21:07Z,"turntable83

On a side note after reading the comments about the wasabi, I was looking into getting one of those until the guy installing it for me told me about all the problems they were having with it.  So, I went with the Xk3y and it's worked perfectly for me."

,mikedongs,2013-02-24T07:05Z,"Turntable83: The people who spend insane amounts of money on the best PC hardware available for playing games are complete morons.

You don't have to waste money like that to have a good gaming PC, though. I bought a Geforce 9800GT about 3 years ago, a little over $100. I am still using it, and playing the latest games smoothly. Some of them I need to run at 1280x720 instead of 1920x1080 if it gets a little choppy, but it still looks better than a 360 or a PS3 at 1920x1080.

The console releases have toned down graphics so the games can still run smoothly on hardware from like 2005. PC releases have superior controls too, especially in FPS or this person shooter games.

I've got Hitman Absolution on PC, i rented the 360 version from a Redbox just to compare. It was terrible. Console controllers just don't let you get even remotely as accurate as keyboard and mouse. That's why console ports have heavy aim assist to make it playable.

Consoles can be more convenient, and they do the job but be realistic. You sound as bad as the elitist PC fanboys that you're talking shit about."
