Is the quality of this one any good?"
,q2323,2013-02-07T17:57Z,"not the best resolution, but quality and framerate is good. definitely watchable.
video is not deinterlaced so I recommend VLC for on-the-fly deinterlacing"
,beechyboy,2013-02-07T22:32Z,"What's the bps & resolution?

Thanks for the upload q2323"
,beechyboy,2013-02-07T22:45Z,"To answer my own question, after download it I see it is 608 X 352 with 29fps and 1100 bit rate. Good specs.
I see what you mean about needing de-interlacing.
Decent enough to watch since you never seem to find this show in HD anywhere. "
