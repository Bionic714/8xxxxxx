It has been just over 16 years since The Darkness -- a character that debuted in Witchblade #10 -- became a monthly series from Top Cow Productions and Image Comics, featuring the all-star creative team of writer Garth Ennis and artists Marc Silvestri and Batt. Their work on the opening storyline "Coming of Age" set the tone for the title.

This torrent and two others update the collection from the October 2011 torrent "The Darkness (Complete)," posted here on TPB by my friend GunningHawk90, and originally by the uploader Rickradchak.

All credit must go to the original scanners!

This torrent contains various crossovers, miniseries, one-shots, and extras. I already posted a torrent with the core monthly series, #001-110.

There are over 80 comics here, including:

THE DARKNESS #0 (same as WITCHBLADE #10)
THE DARKNESS #1/2
ANGELUS 6-issue miniseries
BATMAN AND THE DARKNESS
THE DARKNESS - PITT 3-issue miniseries
THE DARKNESS - WOLVERINE
MONSTER WAR 4-issue miniseries
TALES OF THE DARKNESS 4-issue miniseries and #1/2 issue
THE DARKNESS - FOUR HORSEMEN 4-issue miniseries
THE DARKNESS AND HULK
THE DARKNESS - SUPERMAN 2-issue miniseries
THE DARKNESS volume 2 PRELUDE and #0 issue
appearances in the TOMB RAIDER and WITCHBLADE titles
...and a lot more!

In one last follow-up torrent (coming soon), I will post the 24 released issues of the ARTIFACTS ongoing series that I've compiled from GunningHawk90's torrent and others.

I've done my best to compile and organize this, but it has honestly given me a huge headache.
