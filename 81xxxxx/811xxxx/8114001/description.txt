Angels & Airwaves are a San Diego alternative-rock band formed in 2005 by Tom DeLonge (from blink-182) and his friend David Kennedy (from Box Car Racer). The rest of the forming lineup included Ryan Sinn (The Distillers) and Atom Willard (Rocket from the Crypt/The Offspring). Ryan Sinn was asked to leave in 2007 and his replacement, Matt Wachter (30 Seconds to Mars), completed what was the definitive lineup of Angels & Airwaves. Atom Willard amicably left the band after the recording of their 4th album "LOVE part II" to explore other musical ventures, his replacement is Ilan Rubin (from Nine Inch Nails), which completes the current lineup.
