NOTE: I suggest downloading VLC Media Player to watch this release.  You can download it here:

A few important and simple keyboard shortcuts for VLC are:

Double click: Fullscreen
Spacebar: Play/Pause
V key: Enable/Disable/Change Subtitles.
G/H key: Subtitle Delay (-50ms/+50ms per tap)
J/K key: Audio Delay (-50ms/+50ms per tap

NOTE: English Subtitles are on by default for each episode.  To turn them off, simply tap the V key in VLC or delete the Subtitles folder.

NOTE: I normally encode 6-channel AAC @ 384Kbps, but due to the nature of this show, I instead chose a slightly lower bitrate (320Kbps) to save a bit of space.

NOTE: Two samples are included for your viewing pleasure.

NOTE: I do not have constant Internet access, so this upload may take a few days.  Please be patient!

NOTE: If enough people request it, I would be willing to upload the original BluRay rips done by DEMAND (~14.5GB).
