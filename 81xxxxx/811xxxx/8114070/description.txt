Since there was only one other copy of this on TPB, (and from the sounds of the comments it was spanned across many files). I decided since I have a DVD of this, that I would rip it for anyone that is interested in seeing it.

High quality (the DVD quality isn't even that impressive) H.264, Stereo AAC, clean rip.

Enjoy. I know I did when I saw it for the first time recently.
