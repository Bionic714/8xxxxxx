Jaksta for Mac is easy to use: just open Jaksta, then play the video, music or audio youΓÇÖd like to capture. You will find that your media is recorded up to ten times faster than playback speed, since Jaksta is grabbing files directly from the web site where they are hosted. This downloading technique means that the quality of the recorded files are perfect copies of the original.
