A rogue dragon - a Whispering Death - shows up in Berk, tearing up the village.
He's on a mission - to find Toothless and settle a score. Despite Hiccup's
efforts to help, Toothless insists on facing the dragon alone. But unlike
their past battle, Toothless's inability to fly may prove to be his undoing.
