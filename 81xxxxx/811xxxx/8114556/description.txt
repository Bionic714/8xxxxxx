"The Amazing Wood-Gas Stove", the first volume in the 'A Simple DIY Project' series walks you step by step through the construction of a small inexpensive, or even free, wood-gas gasifier type camping stove. Built from materials you either probably have already on-hand, or can easily locate for nothing, you learn how to both make and use this truly amazing stove design.

The units described in this book are modified downdraft coaxial gasifier stoves. You will learn how it compares to other camping type stoves in side by side comparisons, theory of operation, how to build a wood-gas stove, uses for a gasifier stove, and accessories you can make for the unit after you have built one.

Though originally designed for outdoors use including hiking, camping, hunting, fishing, and wilderness survival, discover the stove which is perfect for major emergency use as well. Fuel is free, and the stove can be built for free using recycled materials. "The Amazing Wood-Gas Stove" is for anyone willing to tinker with a love of the outdoors, or wanting to prepare for emergencies.
