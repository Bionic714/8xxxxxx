Synopsis:
Georges Duroy (Robert Pattinson), a handsome and unscrupulous, comes to Paris from Algeria, where he spent two years with the army mobilized. His great good looks and charm soon begin to open doors. When you become aware of their possibilities, aspirations grow and rise rushes so as dizzying as his moral attitude degrades. The seduction plot and elevated it to the place you have decided is proper: the highest levels of Paris. Bel Ami (as will be dubbed by successive lovers) is an emblematic work of one of the most important writers of the nineteenth century: the story of a character who relegates to the background moral principles for accommodating manners. A story in which loyalty clashes with ambition.

Production notes:
- Based on a story by Guy de Maupassant.
