Synopsis:
Marnie (Tippi Hedren), a young child stigmatized by some events that happened to her mother, has become an unrepentant kleptomaniac and liar.
Mark (Sean Connery), a young and wealthy entrepreneur, discovering and forcing her to end up marrying him, protecting his crimes and trying to replenish their mental problems.

The encounter between a penetrating psychological plot and a purely criminal (although the two go hand in hand and is the result of the other) is significantly developed by the English teacher, but did not reach the height of his best works, mainly due to imbalance between the rates needed to deploy each case and insufficient thrust of the script in several of its channels.

His prolific use of narrative detail and wisdom make "Marnie" negligible film, which again yield intense moments in the different aspects (suspense and romance) that characterize the work of the British author, again helped with chores technical by Bernard Herrmann magnificent (music) and Robert Burks (photography), and based on an insightful psychoanalytic study of the central character, a beautiful thief, frigid and hostile in his sexuality in his androgyny.
