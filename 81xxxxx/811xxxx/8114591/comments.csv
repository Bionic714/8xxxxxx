You know it's true. Otherwise you wouldn't have watched it. You were intrigued and then you hated the idea because you knew it was true, and you wished it weren't so.

You'll learn, don't worry. It's difficult to digest in the beginning, but I went from being a socialist to being something between an anarcho-capitalist and a minarchist (and no downloading is perfectly compatible with those ideas). It took me a couple of years before I stopped rejecting these ideas and embraced them. It made me a much happier person and made me realise why so many communists/socialists/left-wingers are such jerks that pretend to care about ""Africans"" and the lower classes when in reality they do jack-shit about the problems, and only talk the talk without walking the walk.

They can't be bothered, but sure, they'll take other people's money and use that to help ""the needy"" and themselves, of course. Some call it redistribution of wealth while others call it by its proper name: theft and the politics of envy.

It's why you are pissed off at that guy who is taller and looks better than you and who has three perfect children. It's why you hate that guy who is more intelligent and makes a killing. You are not interested in helping the poor -- you want to help yourself by putting others down.

These people (the needy, the poor, the disadvantaged call them what you like) don't need money and benefits thrown in their faces. They need real solutions. They need education and they need someone to take their hand and guide them in life until they learn how to catch a fish by themselves instead of receiving it from someone else without working.


This film is not very well-made, true, but if you look at its budget you'll know why.

It has nothing to do with propaganda. It's based on a book as you know. Of course you believe that anything that is contrary to your core beliefs is propaganda, so that isn't saying much.

The book contains many fine ideas and logical arguments. The book is maybe not pure gold, but it's close and it touches on a lot of subjects that we know are true deep down in our hearts when we use the rational parts of our brains to think.

The first time I read the book I wanted to hate it because I couldn't believe or didn't want to believe that the world or humans were like that. I read it again and started to realise that my friends, my family and strangers that I met were exactly like the book described them.

I could go on, but you need to discover these things for yourself."

This is not about Democrats or Republicans. Both voters are equally retarded.

Here is an example of how stupid Obama-voters can be:

(Search YouTube for Obama is a Keynesian)

Conservatism and Libertarianism (and also Objectivism) are not compatible. Many of the core beliefs of Republicans are deeply rooted in Conservatism.

Both Democrats and Republicans are for state coercion and limiting freedom. The opposite of Objectivism and Libertarianism.

So no -- this is not party specific ""propaganda"" as you'd like to label it.

The Republicans, as a whole, do not wish to reduce taxes to 0%. They do not wish abortions to be legal. They do not wish to abolish the welfare state. They do not wish to abolish public schooling and substitute it with a better system --- privately-owned schools.

It's no secret that students from privately-owned schools fare better, and it's not ONLY because the schools receive better ""source material"" (children).

Both Republicans and Democrats wish to go to war. It's like choosing between between Scylla and Charybdis. Or between the plague and cholera..."
,GObonzo,2013-02-09T15:20Z,"you're all lost. anyone who comes to the surface of the american government is nothing but a pawn of that government and just another face they hope will stem the tide of the people's disbelief in that government. as the years have gone by we have become to lazy to even give a damn what's going on either way so they're wasting their time in the long run. we could become a dictatorship and no one would care as long as they had their cable, their iphones, and their carbcalorie loaded snacks."
,HugoBossUnzipped,2013-02-09T16:10Z,@AgaPadar Sounds more like a conservative trying to shift responsibility for conservative failures once again onto Liberals. ayn rand is a conservative god and like reagan a complete and utter failure.

,AlexLibman,2013-02-13T22:21Z,"Thank you very much.

A movie version of Atlas Shrugged is an enjoyable but inherently silly idea.  You cannot turn a philosophical novel of this depth into a film, and especially not on so tiny a budget.

Everyone - READ THE BOOK!  You may want to start with Ayn Rand's non-fiction books, and then work your way up to the novels, in order."
,jamsim1967,2013-02-14T00:33Z,Do not mistake Republicans for Conservatives. Real conservatives do not trust either party.

,dredre27,2013-02-25T03:50Z,"Fountainhead (1949) is here btw:

http://thepiratebay.sx/search/Fountainhead/0/7/0

Atlas Shrugged is a book that must be READ. The movies suck. There is too much taking place within the book for a movie to ever capture. 

The other problem is the book was written during a time when nearly everyone felt they had a right to earn millions of dollars without regard or consequence to others. 

Now that society has experienced the pain of the ""1%,"" the mentality promoted in Atlas Shrugged is distastefu. Maybe even vulgar by today's standards. 

Big mistake to try and keep to the flavor of the book. Should have altered the story to match current views -- we do not become saddened to hear some silver spooned leecher has been blocked from amassing millions or billions of dollars. The point of the book is missed by not altering the story for current times and viewpoints.

Read the friggin boook instead. Or listen to the audiobooks. They are here too."
,dredre27,2013-02-25T03:54Z,Oh. Thank you extremezone for providing this rip. No disrespect meant to you in my previous remarks. My comments apply to the folks who created the movie without looking ahead at the impact of trying to remain true to Rand's now dated philosophies.

,mikey-sweden,2013-03-11T17:29Z,"@Bendico you're rambling just as Rands characters do. I used to ramble like you. I've read and seen both Atlas Shrugged and the Fountainhead. 

If you skip all the politics and consider the philosophy behind, it is promoting a sad and lonely existence where detachment from other people is celebrated. People are a collective animal and we like to feel attachment to other people."
,Jack_Reacher,2013-04-07T05:25Z,"kudos Bendico!   You hit it out of the park with your comments!

Obama voters and intelligence is a major oxymoron.  Oh well, at least the unemployed, (thanks to Obama), can at least watch some free movies."
