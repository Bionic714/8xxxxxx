,Dr.D.,2013-02-08T20:55Z,"So if I have the old HD texture DLC, I have to uncheck that and just install this new one?"
,Machine4578,2013-02-08T22:52Z,"@Dr.D.

if you had the old HD texture pack just copy over the old one with these new ones.. and thats it.. just double check to make sure they are checked off in the DATA section in the Launcher before starting game.."
