,surinen,2013-02-07T19:46Z,thank you very much for making our virtual lives HD ! without you it would not be possible
,Mafu11,2013-02-07T21:50Z,"Mr. Stifmeister, you're like a god. Thanks for everything."
,Lobuno,2013-02-08T01:41Z,"Wow, that was fast!!!! Thank you very much sir."
,surinen,2013-02-08T02:43Z,"but I wonder, does it contain all textures from the previous Bethesda's testures update ? in the descrip[tion there is about all of them being updated but I wonder if those ""all"" are those left behind untouched in previous release ( I did not try it because I was not even aware that Bethesda released it in august/september ) or literally all?"
,CapnBin,2013-02-08T03:05Z,"Thanks Mr.Stif! i have the previous texture pack, would you recommend me to uninstall that pack and replace with this updated pack? thanks!"
,darmar79,2013-02-08T10:48Z,"Right,do I need to uninstall the previous text. pack or?
Thanks uploader! ;)"
,NonyxGel,2013-02-08T11:16Z,Just copy the files to the game folder? That's it? How do I know if Skyrim is using these textures? Do I have to check a box or toggle a setting or something? The game looks exactly the same to me. Surely there must be some kind of indication somewhere as to which texture pack is being used. Does anyone have any suggestions?
,NonyxGel,2013-02-08T11:38Z,"Well, I copied the files in this torrent to my ""The Elder Scrolls V SkyrimData"" folder. Then I ran the launcher, clicked on ""DATA FILES"" and saw that these files were added to the list and a check was in the box next to them. So I ran the game but I swear I still can't tell if these textures are being used or not. Everything looks as it did before. I'm sure I'm just durping this all up."
,darmar79,2013-02-08T12:41Z,@NonyxGel - check/uncheck the textures in data files and try to see the difference?
,GObonzo,2013-02-08T17:37Z,if u already had the 1st HD update you will not notice much different around normal skyrim. in Dawnguard exclusive areas you will and i imagine the same with DragonbornHearthfire areas.
,OmniNegro,2013-02-09T01:31Z,"The original textures did not look bad, and these were based on the originals. If you want every texture to look different, this is not for you.

It takes a practiced eye to notice how the left corner of a particular block looks different. Or how the grass texture now has less grain to it. Do not beat yourself up if you are unable to see the difference."
,WDoubleYouW,2013-02-09T16:09Z,"Also, make sure you load this AFTER Dawnguard/Hearthfire/Dragonborn in your load order."
,vagos54,2013-02-23T18:32Z,Guys how i can install that? I tried just putting the files in DATA does not work
,vagos54,2013-02-23T22:01Z,"I got it because it does not work ... the problem is that the information on how to place the textures is incomplete ...
1. need this program http://fallout3.nexusmods.com/mods/34
2. before doing anything should install java to the latest version and restart the pc http://www.java.com/en/download/
3. restart after removing the FO3 Archive Utility (FO3 Archive Utility-34.rar) and run the FO3Archive.jar says in that box on ""File"" seeking the files. bsa and open
4. Then in the option that says ""Action"" extract everything to a separate folder before passing them to where you installed the game originally
5. Repeat step 4 with the 3. bsa contained in the texture pack folder.

Then from there my question now is where to put those textures if DATA or directly apply to the game .... I'll be trying to do the following"
