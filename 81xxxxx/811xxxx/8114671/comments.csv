,anon_349,2013-02-08T16:50Z,"I've been using rachels collection for at least 3 years now if not almost 4 if I recall correctly.

I'm finding it hard to believe that it is about to all end :C
Don't get me wrong, I have nothing but the utmost respect and gratitude for all your hard work throughout these years by providing all of us these absolute 'best online collection' available on the net imho.

I hope you never age personally and remain at your best health forever. But realistically, I do understand that your health and other personal concerns are the priority here and wish you nothing but the very best here and hopefully until the far future.

I buy on and off on the official TS3 site but like all real life person, there are times where funds are in the low end which therefor I must resort to a more 'budget friendly' alternatives such as yours and truly ofc.

Nevertheless, the fact that you have always delivered to countless ppl again and again and even with that recent demonoid scare which you have managed to pull through have always made me realized how dedicated and truly amazing you are.

So with that in mind, I hope this is not farewell but a mere temporary 'c u l8r' when all is well on your end :D

All the best Rach' and as always ofc, A HUGE Thank you for everything "

What the hell is going on?"
,PathoNoma,2013-02-08T23:45Z,"I've been trying to download just a part of this torrent, and it seems to work, but all the files are invalid, as if they're not complete or not put together correctly. I've tried Vuze, Bitlord, and uTorrent, all with the same result.

I check off the boxes for the files that I want (for this torrent, I just checked off Greenhouse, Lucky Simoleon, and Sims 3 Store (Premium Content) Fixes ). 

When the torrent is done, and the status is ""Seeding"" I exit out of the torrent program and find that all the zip files that I just downloaded are not working/corrupt/whatever. 

Am I missing something obvious here? Anyone have the same result?"
,PathoNoma,2013-02-08T23:46Z,"I should add that downloading the small ReadMe text files are fine, however. Just the zip files so far."
,Cassabass,2013-02-09T02:10Z,Everything worked when I used WinZIP instead! Thanks! 
,PathoNoma,2013-02-09T03:22Z,"7zip worked for me too, thanks emilio!"

,SEshogun,2013-03-03T01:55Z,SEED PEOPLE!!!
,rrawk,2013-03-04T04:42Z,Will this cause any issues with a legit copy of the game or when the game connects to home servers?
,Corleone-Hacker,2013-03-05T10:08Z,"The sims 3 university life was released today :D
please update the store pack xD"
,pallas795,2013-03-14T05:57Z,"I'm wondering if the mega merged packs contain the ""world"" files... that would be bad. Does anyone know?

Also, thanks so much for thus rachelstoolbox! Awesome of you to do this."
,TheMedic7,2013-03-27T18:27Z,"This torrent is being tracked, got a DCMA from my VPN. Heads up"
