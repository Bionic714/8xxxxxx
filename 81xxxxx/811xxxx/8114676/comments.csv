,Gabri77,2013-02-07T22:42Z,Thanks a lot!
,nhughes5,2013-02-08T01:14Z,A10/V10  Excellent HD rip especially in such a small package. Thank you ripper/uploader. Keep up the good work!
,Darkunited,2013-02-08T08:24Z,"A/V 10, movie 1. I don't usually rate movies but this one is not worth any ones time. If you do not believe me i challenge you. Watch this movie, come back and post that you watched it and liked it.  I appreciate the upload but i can't see anyone with a rational thought process watch this movie and actually consider it even mildly entertaining. "
,bigghands,2013-02-08T20:32Z,"I know this title sounds like it could be good and I am sure it has excellently been ripped and has awesome sound and video, but.......Rotten Tomatoes gives this a .5 out of 10      Yeah you read that right, not a 5 but a .5     That is half of a 1  Just sayin b4 you wasted valuable time watching.  Cheers !"
,ScarletteSpider,2013-02-12T10:43Z,number of seeders is a lie. i've been waiting for an active seeder for this movie for over a month and the number of active seeders for this is zero!
,ScarletteSpider,2013-02-12T20:00Z,SOMEBODY SEED PLZ!!!!
,bragazar1710,2013-02-14T10:36Z,thanks!
,FureeTutawk,2013-02-17T06:00Z,"Rotten Tomatoes is not the end all be all of movie quality. They base their scores (the people) on the y generation's need for NOW NOW NOW and action and blood and gore and giant names. This is based, very accurately, on a historic set of novels from a controversial political writer of more than half a century ago..and a woman no less. Many political minds hate her for what she wrote and what she had obviously accurately predicted. There is a new interest in her work. Don't watch it for lighthearted escapism. There is no escape."

You posted 5 days after this torrent was posted saying: ""number of seeders is a lie. i've been waiting for an active seeder for this movie for over a month and the number of active seeders for this is zero!""

That is clearly a lie!"

The movie itself is a big crap."
