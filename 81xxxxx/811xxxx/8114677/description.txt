Quick & important facts about trainer:

* Run Civilization and start a new game before launching trainer
* Activate pointers before you begin using it
* When all pointers are fetched, a success note is played.
* When trainer is launched and waiting for you to go into
  civilization, if you don't go into civ, it will shut down
  after 10 seconds automatically or press ESC to cancel.
* User input cannot exceed 20 million, error note plays if above
* If using city-culture cheat, remember to sell Amphitheater
  or else trainer will hang until you do.
* When using city modifier, remember to buy a science building
  or else trainer will hang until you do.
* Tab'ing to the desktop forces trainer to shut down (security)
* When starting trainer, you'll hear fast midi notes until you go
  back into civilization, a success note is played when you do
* Trainer will shut down if olly, cheatengine, windbg, tsearch
  or similar tools run in the background. (security)
* Api hook protection, debug protection and data obfuscation
* If trainer shuts down unexpectedly, you should know why
Firaxis works continually to invalidate trainers. :)

What happened to the 'Healing' cheat in my old trainer?

I hated that cheat, if it wasn't enough to cheat almost everything in the game
cheating with the health adds more insanity to the game. I seriously think the
healing cheat isn't necessary, will only ruin the game and I hate it to the guts.
I will never include that cheat again in any of my future trainers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Example of using the movement cheat?

1. Press and hold the ALT key.
2. Type a numeric value using the leftmost side keypad.
3. Press ALT + F1 to activate movement cheat with this value.
or press F1 if ALT key is already down at the moment.
4. Click a unit to apply it.

Done. The procedure is the same with all other cheats.
