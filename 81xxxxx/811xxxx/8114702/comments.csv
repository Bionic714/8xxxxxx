,dr_rock,2013-02-09T09:15Z,"The screen grabs look like they are straight out of the webisodes, can anyone confirm if this is the just the webisodes put together into a single movie?"
,Gumbercules79,2013-02-09T12:16Z,Hmm. Downloading in 2.0kb/s.. What gives?
,PetaFlux,2013-02-09T16:42Z,"Jag hade lite svårt att identifiera mig med den 12-åriga huvurollsinnehavaren. 
Med tanke på era kommentarer så blir det nog inte ett problem för er övriga."
,espirates,2013-02-09T20:41Z,"I don't get it, one movie is 4.35 GiB ? WTF I was thinking it would be more.  They only made one cheesy episode ?  I want my hour back lol"
,mycholula,2013-02-09T22:51Z,"Skip it, it's a MKV file. Will get it from someone who's smart enough to not use a format that limit's it's audience."
,Swedenmac,2013-02-09T23:07Z,Thanks alot! I love this serie!

,Norlige,2013-02-10T00:17Z,I can confirm that this is just a movie that has been put together using all the webisodes. nothing new in this that is not in the 10 episodes
,wanted77,2013-02-10T07:28Z,Thanks! 
,Shamrox,2013-02-10T12:34Z,"WTF is with ""Frack"" instead of ""Fuck""!?! Sounds totally stupid. "

,SBonesE8,2013-02-11T00:28Z,actually the frack is acceptable as their a different race.if not ittd be gay
,SmokinKush,2013-02-12T01:04Z,"mycholula -- if u don't know how to use an mkv... get the fuck off here and stop bitching about shit u get for free.  seriously so sick of you faggots bitching about every little thing.

THANK YOU BOZX"
,electrond,2013-02-12T21:20Z,without doubt one of the most lame movies ever (unless your a extreme-hard-core BSG fan) 
,piizda,2013-02-14T07:30Z,"Yeah total shit, and movie is under gaming glow effect, that makes you see no real picture all movie long."
,PGHammer21B,2013-03-25T13:20Z,"MKV is limiting how?  VLC can play MKVs on any OS it supports (which is Windows, Linux, or OS X), and PressPlay can play MKVs on WindowsRT."
,yogdagon,2013-04-26T16:04Z,"V-9, A-7, M-6, thanx.
(Maybe my pc was just problematic, as I read much better critics, so don't pay much attention to mine.)
I seed for three (3) months."
