Dood I would give my left nut to be able to download this but 46.6 GIB is way out of my league, especially in my country with crap data speeds. Thanks anyway and if you know anyone who will trade this for a left ball/nut/testy, please let me know, I would gladly saw it off."
,lightningpgtt,2013-02-08T00:13Z,"The discs are wrapped separately so you can download only the parts you need if didn't want the entire fileset.  That said, while it includes Volkswagen and Audi, I couldn't locate the Seat and Skoda discs.

To be fair, I forgot to mention that this is not my original torrent; I simply could not find the recent dual version on TPB."
,Heavyasscarbut30TDI,2013-02-21T10:24Z,"I realize this torrent is fairly new. And I should point out I torrent casually and I don't really know the workings of the torrent system.
But I've been stuck on 43,2% for 4 days now and I've uploaded four times as much as I've downloaded, so I'm guessing ~43% is as much as we can reach. Shouldn't this torrent have at least 1 seed for it to function?
Anyway, you can get the desired discs from eBay for a few Euro; and it's the newer 4.0 version, too. I have no doubt it's as easy to get them if you're from any other part of the world.

Should we keep on seeding? Or should we buy the discs and upload them (I'll only buy the Audi version, though)?"
,DocPanic,2013-03-14T12:03Z,im stuck @92.5%. only 3.48GiB to go... took me 4 days. seeded 212GiB so far. wheres masterseeder???
,lightningpgtt,2013-03-16T22:55Z,"Sorry, folks.  A HDD failure made the torrent unavailable for a while.  I've recovered, but at a reduced seeding rate.  Cheers. "
,Heavyasscarbut30TDI,2013-03-17T15:10Z,"No worries, there's plenty of seeders now. I'll help by seeding this torrent for a long while.
Thanks!"
,DocPanic,2013-03-17T15:50Z,yeah. finally. thx to the masterseeder... will be uploading the file for at least one more week...
,skroggitz,2013-03-17T21:24Z,"Thanks, OP!"
,DocPanic,2013-03-18T16:35Z,"is there a 32/64bit version?!? setup.exe tells me, i got the wrong bit..."
,Heavyasscarbut30TDI,2013-03-18T21:35Z,"3.90 and 3.91 don't work in 64-bit Windows 7. Not sure about other version of Windows. You need to run the setup in XP mode or some form of virtual machine.

It's a good thing you reminded me, I'd probably be seeding this for months before I'd try installing the thing and realising it needs some effort put into it. For anyone else not willing to be bothered with, what probably is, a minimal amount of work to set this up, just search Elsawin 4.0 on eBay.

I'll be seeding to at least a 5.0 ratio as a thanks."
,limp19,2013-03-19T11:42Z,please seeeed
,limp19,2013-03-20T14:31Z,does anyone know how to instal this?
,note2self,2013-05-10T19:26Z,"Thanks, this was bloody awesome! I've been getting the run around from audi repair centres for a while, because of a problem their shitty 2.0l engine probably was designed to fail at. Now I can finally fix it myself. P.S. Keep seeding, you twats."
