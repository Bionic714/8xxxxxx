Duration : 2mn 53s
Bit rate mode : Constant
Bit rate : 320 Kbps
Channel(s) : 2 channels

This is a contradiction in terms, Joint Stereo is not 2 separate channels, nether is Stereo, the only true 2 channel MP3 is Dual Channel which has 2 independant tracks. Joint Stereo is the very worst encoding for sound quality with the track spread over both channels and lacking in high frequencies.
A shame to use this form a degredation if the origin was lossless."
