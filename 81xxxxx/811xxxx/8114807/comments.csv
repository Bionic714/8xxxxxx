,kolopiratebay,2013-02-08T01:49Z,Freaking useless junk without the product key.Thanks for nothing guy.
,brianxxx,2013-02-08T04:01Z,"Easy dude! Relax! Darn nice of Krosis to up it. Makes it available to others, lets those interested be able to work on a crack, etc. "
,euklid81,2013-02-11T02:06Z,"License no.:	1063-0575-1585-222
Product no.:	833-891"
,aljj1,2013-02-11T02:08Z,"Need help; first time user; attempted to download this program; continue to receive an error regarding ""QBVSS"" file and unable to continue.  Any help would be appreciated."
,PGVZYL,2013-02-13T13:53Z,So did anyone try the license number that euklid81 provided? Does it run now?
,44pro,2013-02-14T10:07Z,I confirm that that serial and product ID provided by euklid81 functions perfectly. Thanks uploader!
,krdu,2013-02-15T01:46Z,"aljj1 - One of the drivers supplied by Intuit is seen by SOME Windows 8 installations as unsigned.  If you put Windows 8 in test mode before you install, it will install fine.  If you don't know what test mode is, Google it."
,chicake,2013-02-16T09:11Z,"Although euklid81 has provided a workable set of licence and product nos., do we know if it passes registration without a crack? It won't be of any use if there is a 30-day limit before it must be registered."
,chicake,2013-02-16T11:35Z,I've installed and tested. Program runs fine but is useless as an ongoing thing without a registration crack. I really don't know why non-cracked applications are uploaded. Any cracks yet?
,mablar,2013-02-18T10:26Z,i'm looking for the premier 2013 edition uk codes please help guys
[H],[KROSIS],2013-02-18T19:52Z,"chicake : Because those who actually paid for it and have an authentic serial might find this very useful.  Also, I had not seen it elsewhere, so if it was not available to someone capable of making a crack, now it is. :)"
,mablar,2013-02-19T11:23Z,STILL LOOKING MY FRIENDS FOR THE CODES (UK QUICKBOOKS PREMIER 2013) I'M DESPERATE PLEASE HELP
,migo1,2013-02-19T11:34Z,PLSE SOME ONE CAN POST A SOFTWARE CALLED WINFEED 
,digitalhoarder,2013-02-21T16:38Z,Thanks KROSIS  Like you said I have a paid copy and this was easier thank contacting intuit to download a copy becasue I never registered online.  Now I can put this on a second computer
,Sharrin1,2013-02-26T02:03Z,I REALLY need a KEY that has info for registration as well....  Anyone?
,legit115,2013-02-26T02:27Z,"I appreciate your uploading this ISO.  I am an IT consultant running a legitimate business in the US.  I service small businesses and more times than not an application has to be re-installed and the business owner has no idea where the original media is located.  I don't even ask any more for the most part.  Although all of the QuickBooks products are available in their entirety at: http://support.quickbooks.intuit.com/support/articles/INF12417 , having access to un-cracked original disc ISOs has been invaluable.  On a side note, if you run a business or support a business, financial software is the last place that you want to have illegitimate software.  Although everything that I've gotten from the Bay has been free of malware (afaik), I couldn't imagine a worse situation than a customer's sensitive financial data being copied out a back-door.  Thank you uploaders."

,mrtggbroker,2013-03-01T06:39Z,Thanks so much Krosis!! the reg worked perfect. validation code needed to register and we are good to go!!
,boggi202,2013-03-01T17:19Z,has anyone called and gotten the validation code without a problem?
,rk93,2013-03-01T18:20Z,Can someone please help. First time user. I downloaded the torrent but I don't know how to proceed from there on to launch and use the software. Can someone please explain and/or contact me?
,GPeachy100,2013-03-09T03:05Z,It asks for a validation code do you have this?
,tinjuaneza,2013-03-11T11:32Z,"@euklid81 
THANKS for the numbers!"
,kita82,2013-03-12T16:16Z,worked great for me!!!! thx for the download hun!!
,MaximusGA,2013-03-12T18:15Z,"Posting ANYTHING on a torrent site is not a ""legitimate"" business practice. And posting a copyrighted product CD is 100% a violation of copyright. So whether you own it or not, making a copy -- even if Intuit provides the same for free on their site -- violates the law. So do not try to pretend you are doing your clients a favor. If you were sincere, you would have simply given them the URL to the URL download link."
,rdewitt,2013-03-12T20:55Z,Thanks euklid81!!! License and Product worked perfectly.
,crooked_b,2013-03-22T00:48Z,"can not get it to install when mounted using virtual clone drive it gets stuck a 1/4 of the way on ""installing files"" any suggestions on a solution or another copy of pro 2013?"
,crooked_b,2013-03-22T00:51Z,will not install when mounted gets stuck on installing files....any suggestion or another source for pro 2013?
,oifwolf,2013-04-14T03:16Z,"never used this program.
probably never will.
but yes copy right is a mother!
they can throw the book at a kid for downloading a song from the internet using a program like Napster. then they will defiantly throw the book at you for downloading this, Autocad, or the Adobe Master Collection. "
,rdewitt,2013-04-18T01:21Z,"The license and key work, but soon expire. So whatever you set up is lost unless you register the software. Bottom line, license and key are worthless."
,lancelight,2013-04-23T00:02Z,"MaximusGA is correct.  The original uploader is retarded for thinking he's doing anyone a favor.  Posting a torrent of a freely available (and copyrighted) is just as illegal as posting a cracked version.  So whats the point?  Crack it or dont waste anyone's time here.  If someone needed it for cracking, they would download it from intuit.  Why are we surrounded by so many idiots these days that dont know what the difference between CopyLEFT and CopyRIGHT are?  WTF?  Seriously?"
[H],[KROSIS],2013-05-02T06:00Z,"I never said anything about copyanythingatall.  But feel free to continue your pointless rant. :)  My you must be quite bored.  And yes, clearly the fact that anyone at all bothers to seed it shows how pointless it is.  Far more pointless than your contributions."
,gold_magistrate,2013-06-01T17:13Z,I can't install Quickbooks! I keep getting error 1402!
