For XVID AVI with MP3 audio, current consensus suggests:
V=9
A=9

SVU joins the ranks of Mentalist, Following and Deception as being WEB-DL only by me.
Guess what happened while I wuz sleepin'?
Every week, in the same place (about a minute after open credits), pixelation errors.
So, I finally gave up - since nobody was posting WEB-DL versions,
Why look for errors you're going to find and then not have ANY correction options?
But then, starting with this (still could use 1409), every week since a WEB-DL appears.
So, I catch up and resume:
.
