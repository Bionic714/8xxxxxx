For XVID AVI with MP3 audio, current consensus suggests:
V=9
A=9

SVU joins the ranks of Mentalist, Following and Deception as being WEB-DL only by me.
LOL / DIM so consistently damaged (7 of 9) this show that it wasn't worth screening.
Remember - if pixelation is causing streaming to crash - this is the one for you.
