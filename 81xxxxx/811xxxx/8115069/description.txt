Shauna Grant is stunning as the virginal youngster who finds true lust behind closed cabin doors, and Joanna Storm and Kimberly Carson are really quite beautiful themselves. Angela (Shauna Grant) is a new arrival. Longtime resident Carla (Tara Aire) is jealous of boyfriend, J.D. (Herschel Savage) who works at the camp. J.D. take a shine to Angela, so Carla has it in for her. Tammy (Joanna Storm) and Susie (Danielle) have the hots for counselor Greg (Paul Thomas). Fellow counselor Marcie (Janey Robbins) comforts Greg. Veronica (Kimberly Carson) takes virginal Angela to a biker bar and then gets in the middle of a bar fight.
