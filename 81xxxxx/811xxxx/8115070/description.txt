On Sinking, The Aloof emulated the heights and sublime depths of Massive Attack. Moving elegantly through a bromide of dub, reverb and irradiated swathes of strings and keyboards, creamy-sweet vocalist Ricky Barrow sings downbeat songs wallowing in sleaze and self loathing. "One Night Stand" is a sordid lament on the part of a serial stud at his inability to care for women; "Stuck On The Shelf"'s chorus of "Come on over here and have some fun" sounds about as healthy as that of a loiterer in a dirty mac outside a school playground; while "Abuse" is a chronicle of body-poisoning bad habits. Yet all of this negativity is couched in some of the most uplifting and expansive dance rhythms of the 1990s. --David Stubbs
