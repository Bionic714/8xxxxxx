,BoonesFerry,2013-02-10T07:22Z,Thank you EVOLVE and sceneline.
,Interpol5,2013-02-11T05:38Z,"stuck at 84.9% the entire day; be kind and seed, will return the favor"
,J3rryKo42O,2013-02-11T05:48Z,"can someone please seed this? 
84.9% complete and zero download speed "
,BoonesFerry,2013-02-11T07:59Z,"Hmm. Also stuck and there are ZERO seeders.
Either sceneline is unaware they are no longer seeding or they intentionlly stopped. Sad :(  
Guess we'll all have to settle for the xvid with lower resolution. "
,jh2713,2013-02-11T14:57Z,I am also stuck at 1.8 GB. 
,jh2713,2013-02-11T15:01Z,"But really, I would like to comment on the fact, that the pope resigns, only days, after this film/investigation is released. 
Coincidence? "
,spunkster,2013-02-11T20:14Z,"jh2713, I noticed that too! 
I don't think that's a coincidence. It was really reaching a critical mass, only a matter of time before the hammer came down on him. 

Still I'm furious that the pope has not once accepted a fucking speck of blame in all this, and not one member of the clergy has so much as been arrested! They should all be sent to death camps and raped daily for their despicable behavior. 

The one bright spot in all of this is that they dug their own grave. Atheism was already in an upswell and now will reach critical mass following these scandals. The church is falling apart, so the pope should be proud he helped with that."
,mxr77,2013-02-12T01:26Z,"Up to 86.2% now... there seem to be a lot of would-be seeders waiting at that mark, so if sceneline would kindly seed just a bit longer, the torrent should be able to take off on its own. Cheers!"
,jh2713,2013-02-12T15:09Z,"Well, it would be much appreciated, if sceneline were to seed again. 

As for the controversy: Here, in Germany, noone even seems to have heard about the film. Also the facts reveiled aren't being discussed. Quite contrary to the image of the pope from the film, the newspapers are rather sympathetic to the guy. Of course you can't blame him, for decades of crimes on part of the church. But it was certainly him staying the course of this pathetic institution. "
