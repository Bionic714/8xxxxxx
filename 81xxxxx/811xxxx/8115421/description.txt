Cyrus Vanch, a nefarious criminal, is 
recently released from prison and 
intends to re-secure his position as 
leader of the underworld. His first 
step is to take down his biggest 
opponent in the city - Arrow. 
Meanwhile, Oliver shows Moira his 
father's notebook and questions her 
about the names on the list. Thea is 
miserable as she starts her 
internship with Laurel at the legal 
aid office and Detective Lance makes 
a deadly mistake that puts Laurel in 
the crosshairs of Vanch.
