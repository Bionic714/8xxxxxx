"The Smile"

While other kids begin receiving college 
acceptance letters and Axl still hasn't, 
Frankie and Mike begin to worry that their 
son's chances for a sports scholarship 
have passed him by. Meanwhile, Sue is 
determined to prove that smiling is 
contagious as a hypothesis for a school 
science project, and a relentless Brick 
begins pestering his parents for an iPad.

Evolve... or die.

Enjoy :)
