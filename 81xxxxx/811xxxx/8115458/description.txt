"A Slight at the Opera"

Cameron is putting on the school production 
of "Phantom of the Opera," but when their 
star falls ill, Manny pulls all the stops to 
land the lead -- even if that means going 
against Luke. Meanwhile, Jay teaches Phil to 
golf and they wind up in a golf-off with 
Pepper and Mitch; Gloria takes Alex along on 
errands which include a visit to a psychic; 
and Claire's adventures in babysitting Joe 
and Lily become a comedy of errors.

18/Slower+
Evolve... or die.

Enjoy :)
