"Everybody Hates Hitler"

Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean (Jensen 
Ackles) investigate the death of Rabbi Bass, 
who spontaneously combusted. The case 
becomes ever more confusing when they learn 
that the Rabbi was researching Nazi 
Necromancers. Sam and Dean are attacked by a 
Golem who turns out to belong to the Rabbi's 
grandson, Aaron. The key to the case lies 
with the Golem but Aaron doesn't know how to 
control him, which leaves everyone in danger. 
Sam starts menstrating, so Dean has to come 
in the back door.
