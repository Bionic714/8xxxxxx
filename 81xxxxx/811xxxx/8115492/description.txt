"I've Been Down That Road Before"

Rayna begins to settle into the tour when she 
discovers that Deacon has joined Juliette's 
band on the road, and she can't help but think 
that maybe the time has come to make some hard 
decisions. But will a heart to heart with 
Deacon help ease the sting of the revelation? 
Meanwhile Juliette is tired of her bubble gum 
pop success and is interested in exposing who 
she really is, though her team is convinced 
that will damage her commercial success. And 
Scarlett is counting pennies to keep her head 
above water -- until Gunnar makes her an offer
she can't refuse.

18/Slower+
Evolve... or die.

Enjoy :)
