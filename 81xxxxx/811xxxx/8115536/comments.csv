I fixed the subtitles and added further relevant translation. They are now in SRT format, idiomatic English, and reflect the Latin-Portuguese cultural supremacist bias rather than the bootlegged Anglo-American racist bias. Not that one is better than the other, it's just that I'm opposed to sucking up to the American audience. Let them make the effort to understand.
