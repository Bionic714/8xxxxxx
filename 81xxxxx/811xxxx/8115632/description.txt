This play was inspired by a journey the author made to Antarctica in 2007.

Recently widowed Jill Foster embarks on an Antarctic cruise with her sister Liz and the ashes of her late husband, who had worked in Antarctica in the 1970s. It was a place her husband had loved and she is determined to scatter his ashes there, but finds that the task is more difficult than she thought, on more than one level. An interesting piece of writing.
