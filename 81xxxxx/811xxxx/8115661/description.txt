Fish has spent six years in jail. Six years alone.
Six years keeping his mouth shut about the robbery,
about the other men involved. The night he is
released, the four men he protected with silence
celebrate his freedom with a congratulatory dinner.
The meal is a lavish array of sushi, served off the
naked body of a beautiful young woman. The sushi
girl seems catatonic, trained to ignore everything
in the room, even if things become dangerous. Sure
enough, the four unwieldy thieves can't help but
open old wounds in an attempt to find their
missing loot.
