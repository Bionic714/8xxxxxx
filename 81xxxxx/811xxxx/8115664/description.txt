When skeptical tabloid reporter Harlan James (Chase Carter)
is given the assignment of investigating a string of
encounters involving Bigfoot portrayed by D.T. Carney,
Dead Things, he sets out on an extraordinary adventure.
After talking to a few witnesses, Harlan soon learns that
Bigfoot isn't a scary monster but rather a beer-drinking,
panty-stealing party animal! But Harlan isn't the only one
trying to track down the world's most elusive creature.
He'll have to compete with Chester Scroggins (Ron Blackwell,
Showboys), a hillbilly hell-bent on revenge, as well as a
group of rival hunters looking to claim a bounty. With the
aid of a local sheriff (David Novak, Super Shark) and a
beautiful television reporter (Nicole Parsneau), Harlan sets
out to get to the heart of the story before it's too late.
Skewering everything from tabloid trash to small-town intrigue,
Bigfoot's Wild Weekend is a crazy off-the-wall comedy filled
with beer, babes (in-and out-of their bikinis), and Bigfoot!
