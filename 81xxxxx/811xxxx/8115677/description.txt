A courier for a local crime lord must deliver
a mysterious package while being chased by a
horde of unusual gangsters.
All Tommy Wick has to do is deliver a "Package"
to a rival crime lord, nicknamed 'The German'.
It seems like a routine job, until another gang
tries to hijack the precious cargo and Tommy has
to fight every inch of the way to deliver it
safely. The problem is, the "Package" isn't what
Tommy was led to believe, and now he's in even
deeper than he ever thought possible.
