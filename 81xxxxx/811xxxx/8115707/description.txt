"History 101"

The Study Group returns from summer break 
ready to tackle their fourth year of 
Community College. Jeff is particularly 
focused on graduating and is just a few 
credits away. When there is a mix-up with 
a history class registration, Dean Pelton 
institutes an elaborate physical 
competition for class space. Meanwhile, 
Britta helps Abed deal with the anxiety 
he is experiencing over the thought of 
the study group graduating and breaking 
up.

Evolve... or die.

Enjoy :)
