,BRFin,2013-02-08T05:05Z,"As there are currently 19,000 people interacting with this torrent, I felt I needed to say something.

This show's future is uncertain after this season. The season finale is being written in such a fashion that it could function as the series finale, or lead to another season. This will likely hinge on its ratings.

If you love this show as much as I do, please consider tuning in for it on NBC on Thursdays. If they realize how large the fanbase is for the show, maybe they will keep it on the air.

Thanks for reading!"
,HACKworld,2013-02-08T05:44Z,"iBRfan, you are right when you say that the future is uncertain considering the way the last episode is being written, but if you look carefully, all of the previous seasons last episode has also been written as a cliffhanger ending for the series. With the appreciation people have for this show, I hope it continues for a further season or two."
,Malakai971,2013-02-08T05:54Z,"If you missed it, at least watch it on Hulu, Netflix, their website, etc."
,xmagusxmagus,2013-02-08T06:04Z,Gonna have to agree with BRFin. Please support this show in anyway you can if you want it to stay on the air.
,k1037,2013-02-08T07:29Z,"BRFin, watching it on TV really only matters if you have a Nielsen box. Otherwise, they have no idea if you are watching it or not.

Watching it on the web may make a small difference, but networks seem to give far less consideration to those stats as their ad revenue is considerably lower."
,coolaks,2013-02-08T07:58Z,"The show is not on TV in the country I live in.. :(

This is a show that makes me very happy.. I hope NBC doesn't kill it, like it killed 30 Rock.."
,JarjarTwink,2013-02-08T09:25Z,"after the first few episodes of this i saw i thought ""damn this show is too smart for network tv,they's gonna cancel it"" =(

,dylp,2013-02-08T10:21Z,"Unfortunately this show is not available in my country yet so i have resorted to pirating it. but i will be watching it when it comes out here, buying the dvds and trying to support the show however i can. so for those in the US please try to watch it on tv, hulu or netflix if you can to keep this awesome show going. community has one of the greatest fan-bases ever, we just need to show nbc how many people care about this show.

,xhizors,2013-02-08T10:31Z,"No Dan Harmon so I'm pirating this. No commercials baby! It's like I'm watching for free, NBC!"
,Kattekvinnen,2013-02-08T11:20Z,"If this show gets cancelled again I blame YOU Americans! Don't let me down! Don't download the show, watch it on tv! I would if I could!"
,BRFin,2013-02-08T12:18Z,"No one is saying don't download it... just try to watch it when it's on as well. (If it is available in your country.)

I mean, who would want to watch an episode of it just one time?"
,BeachBeachBum,2013-02-08T14:58Z,Yea please let's keep the beautiful show on the air. SUPPORT SUPPORT SUPPORT!
,firexninja,2013-02-08T20:25Z,thank you!
,m3nt4t,2013-02-08T22:27Z,"If I was in the US I'd watch it on TV when it first airs. In my country this show is being shown on cable on Fox channel (yeah, I know it's on NBC in the US). But they're showing re-runs of the previous 3 seasons, so I need to download this latest season here on TPB or risk getting streets behind from my other Community-loving friends.

To support this show I've bought all 3 seasons on DVD direct from the US no less, and had it shipped here.

Nielsen ratings really are irrelevant in this day & age, which explains why pure excrement like Two&AHalfMen can reach 9 seasons and boring, unimaginative shows like TheBigBangTheory can get all the comedy awards (I used to like that show but its writing just pales in comparison to Community, no contest). TBBT just reinforces common stereotypes about geeks and panders to the lowest common denominator."
,mydriasis420,2013-02-09T13:32Z,"Please support this show and watch it if you have the ability! It's a great show struggling for ratings, and I'm only downloading because I can't watch it in my country (for atleast half a year or something atleast) :)"
,stijr,2013-02-09T19:19Z,way to go!!!
,stijr,2013-02-09T19:19Z,fans in india Love you!
,brianthomas161,2013-02-09T19:34Z,"See, to me TPB seeds numbers are as good a system as any to see how popular a show is. If people are willing to d-load it then theyre probably likely to buy dvds mechendise, etc etc. Just look at shows like Dexter and Walking dead. 20000 seeds for a show usually means its doing well. i know the network doesnt look at seeds for ratings, but maybe they should"
,akmranderson,2013-02-10T01:56Z,WOOHOO!!! Community is finally back!!! Please any God like beings above let this season be as good as the others. Thanks EZ
,Joscpe,2013-02-10T03:21Z,"I already watched this on premiere night, just downloading again so I may watch it over again. Although, I didn't think this was quite on par with last seasons, it is only the season opener. Let's hope the new writer can keep up."
,Xorakka,2013-02-11T06:20Z,"So glad it is finally back.

Fuck Nielsen Ratings. Look how old and out of touch the TV networks are. GET WITH THE FUCKING TIMES!"
