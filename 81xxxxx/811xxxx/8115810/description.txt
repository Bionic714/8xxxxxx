Re-skinned and upgraded from an earlier Class 101 pack, the Class 101 for Train Simulator 2013 is available in Strathclyde Passenger Transport (SPT) black and orange livery, the first such time the distinctive livery has appeared on any Train Simulator model. Features include manual gear change control, fully detailed cab and control panel, in-cab lighting and an upgrade to TSX standard features. Also included are a number of exciting scenarios for the West Coast Main Line. 

The West Coast Main Line, available separately, is required to play the included scenarios.
