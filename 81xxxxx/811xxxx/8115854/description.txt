Into the Wild

Shane leads an expedition to a desolate island off
the coast of Nova Scotia, where he believes the
secret of the cure lies hidden. On the trek to the
island's interior, Rebekah and Elena continue their
bitter rivalry, Stefan does his best to keep the
peace, and Damon accuses Shane of leading them into
a trap. Bonnie and Jeremy try to figure out the
message of the Hunter's mark, while Shane reveals
more of the legend of Silas and the witch Qetsiyah,
along with his own personal history. Back in Mystic
Falls, Tyler confronts Klaus, and Caroline is
caught up in the violence that follows.
