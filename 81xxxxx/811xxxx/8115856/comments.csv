,J-RedtheRed,2013-02-08T04:43Z,what is this? is it legit
,Hades322,2013-02-08T04:45Z,"It's the new episode set to air Monday, I assure you it's legit, only thing is that is has a disclaimer across the bottom portion of the vid. Other than that, great quality."
,triquetr1,2013-02-08T19:23Z,"1) Not the full episode to begin with
2) Poorly made virus 
3) Waste of my time and energy when other sites have the real full episode"
,Hades322,2013-02-08T20:34Z,"@triquetr1 Okay then:

1) Any sensible Adventure Time fan knows that the episodes are technically only 11 minutes long, Cartoon Network just pushes two together for their 30 minute block. THIS IS THE FULL EPISODE.
2) If you believe this is a virus, you probably shouldn't even be on TPB.
3) I would love to find a website that has this hosted in a 720x400 resolution like this file is."
