,Skyseed,2013-02-08T23:58Z,Ugh this show stinks since Michael left.  Can't watch any more!
,Zeagle,2013-02-09T00:45Z,"just wait, here comes that fat slob roseanne"
,teabag87,2013-02-09T04:18Z,Michael was predictable and annoying.  This show has been its best since he left. 
,powbiffbang,2013-02-09T21:46Z,"I agree that its horrible now. Introducing the camera crew was the final straw for me, but I've watched every episode and have to see it through to the end."
,Apparition_,2013-02-11T20:38Z,Too much drama. It drives me crazy that they introduced the random sound guy and created this intimate backstory out of nowhere.
,sikm,2013-02-12T10:12Z,wow the office is jumping the shark!! just finish this already 
,bocclown,2013-03-02T14:48Z,totally agree with apparition and powbiffbang about the camera crew. wtf? can't half tell they are out of ideas. But I've had way too many laughs to stay mad.
