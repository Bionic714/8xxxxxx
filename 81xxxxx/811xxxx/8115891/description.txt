************************************************************

Soporific seems to only support or use eMule/eD2k
Well i went through the trouble of relearning how to use emule after all these years to download this release and get it to the torrent realm.
I've used Winborg 2010 release in the past and liked it alot for its customizing straight out of the gate.
You get the xp you want plus many features you never knew, customizable right from install.
I'm also downloading the Builder edition which i'll upload soon.
eMule is so slow, i cant understand why people might think its good.
I never got above 50kbs over the week or so it took to get this iso.
Most of the time it was 5kbs-15kbs lol.

Anyway

If you boot with this DVD and start one of the setup routines, this will clean install a corporate edition of Windows XP Pro SP3 updated to April 2012.
