"Don't Answer the Phone"

Jason, furious over Ians out of control 
spending, cuts off his cash flow only to 
wake up at the wheel of a "borrowed" 
sports car with a trunk full of money and 
an angry drug dealer in his rearview 
mirror. Meanwhile, Jason and Lena have a 
falling out over Jasons questionable 
conduct, which prompts Ian to make a 
dangerous after-hours visit to Lena. Dr. 
Kenneth Jordan is also growing suspicious 
of Jasons odd behavior, and demands 
answers from Jasons confidante, Dr. 
Ruben Marcado. And Olivia fears her sons 
new imaginary friend is not so imaginary 
after all.
