"Don't Answer the Phone"

Jason, furious over Ian s out of control
spending, cuts off his cash flow only to
wake up at the wheel of a "borrowed"
sports car with a trunk full of money and
an angry drug dealer in his rearview
mirror. Meanwhile, Jason and Lena have a
falling out over Jason s questionable
conduct, which prompts Ian to make a
dangerous after-hours visit to Lena. Dr
Kenneth Jordan is also growing suspicious
of Jason s odd behavior, and demands
answers from Jason s confidante, Dr
Ruben Marcado. And Olivia fears her son s
new imaginary friend is not so imaginary
after all
