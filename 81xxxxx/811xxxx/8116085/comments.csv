,mrmagoo25,2013-02-08T20:01Z,"The crack that is included, is it the x86?"
,forless22,2013-02-08T21:18Z,"x32 is 86 if a software is 64,then it will say 64.if not then it is 32(86)"
,Bean-Bandit,2013-02-11T17:37Z,Any idea if this works? All the others don't and you can't manually defrag either.
,wjrigas,2013-02-19T10:31Z,"Ladies and gentlemen, finally a working crack.  Shit is legit..."
,psikofunkster,2013-02-22T22:26Z,"Another trial, waste of time installing it."
,kidvilla,2013-02-27T08:51Z,"no, doing a fresh install in Windows Vista and Windows 7 (both 32 bit) appears to work, but 4 days later, you get the ""trialware days left: 28"" popup reminding you that this is a time-limited trial. The replacement program included doesn't appear to be fully patched as the software still identifies as on trial mode."
,TWEETY2455,2013-03-08T16:47Z,crap up not worth up
,fuctyou,2013-03-15T23:27Z,This worked great for me. XP pro x64 and Win7 x64. Thank you for the upload. 
,dahaka47,2013-03-20T04:36Z,"Bullshit. Installed, cracked (and in ""About"" program shows as cracked) and still got a trial nag in about 3 days after install. Don't bother downloading this."
,SoyJomb9,2013-03-20T07:41Z,I had the same results as dahaka47. 
,alex0008,2013-03-25T16:01Z,"When trial runs out, it won't run manual defrag anymore (just sits at 0%).
I don't know if auto defrag is working, i'm just going to try and reinstall my old, working version."
