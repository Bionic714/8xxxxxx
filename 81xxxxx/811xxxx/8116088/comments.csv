Just went through explaining elsewhere why Elementary looks good for this size.
.
And this is animation, which can stand a much lower bit rate than real life.

Sorry you were disappointed, many are not.

>>> mp4 > avi these days

New to this neck of the woods, I see. If you've a mind to,
check out my mission statement just below the description for:

The.Daily.Show.2012.12.12.Cory.Booker.PROPER.XVID-AVIGUY.avi

There's TS, MKV and MP4 to choose from.
For flipping burgers, MP4 is generally quick, easy and reliable.

But if we must really talk quality - 70mm still can't be beat for upscaling to 70' screens.
Anything less is just gradations to suit one's needs.
As soon as people stop downloading my stuff, I'll quit uploading them.

LOL took 24 hours off for last week's Scandal and 20,000 happy downloads later,
Not one complaint. And nearly a thousand of them are continuing to seed it.
I value their ""vote with their bandwidth"" more than you'll ever know.
Comments are for kibbitzing (and error reporting), up/down loading is the only measure.

It's not like you're sourcing any XVID / AVI (I checked).
There's a fundamental difference between those who do and those who noodge.
At least Damorte is on the playing field. (I checked - I always do).

But every time this happens I issue the same challenge:

Show me up by doing it better. Show me who's who and what's what.
Make me slink away with my tail between my legs compared to your offerings.
Thought not .. pity ... I could use the vacation.

,Taurich,2013-02-08T11:07Z,"I appreciate what you're trying to do with a minirip like this, but for the love of god why are you using that xvid crap?

I can get a 480p rip in x264 for only 0mb more..."
,Taurich,2013-02-08T11:07Z,"30mb, sorry typo"
[V],MP4SUX,2013-02-09T00:50Z,"First, I like a discussion very much - thank you for participating.
.
Well, if you look at the comments for my ""Scandal.US.S02E13"" MINI,
I hope you understand that I'm filling a very important niche.
There are people with CPU un-intensive equipment who just want
something easy to stream to their cozy TV in the bedroom.
..
People perfectly happy with what's been great for years ...
have had the proverbial rug pulled out from beneath them.
.
But I think you may be suffering at least a minor misaprehension.
Quality is 70mm film or even 35mm film (spent a decade as a projectionist).
What works for some doesn't work for others. Very few like MKV,
even less TS. MP4 shows great promise for doing wide ranging things.
Take a look at a command line utility called ""atomicparsley"" (SourceForge).
The plethora of switches and especially objects that can apply to MP4 ...
.
But the sad truth is that by-and-large most of it is X264 / ACC / AC3
that would do quite nicely in the old familiar AVI container.
Yes, x264 is the vangaard of encoding at the moment, but I hear x265 is ...
.
The problem is that superior compression comes at the price of CPU load.
Both recording and playback. LOL / DIM's inability to manage it well
enough to avoid the ""Gross Pixelation"" trap negates most of what they tout.
If it won't play or stream or (my peeve) just looks dam ugly ...
Well, a wrecked Ferrari is no match for a VW Beetle.
.
There are those who just need to dive deeper and live the life extreme.
But the vast majority spend their money on things of true value and
just want to sit and watch something just good enough to match their taste.
.
Or, as I put it in my mission statement - people really only talk about
gourmet - but that's what comes out of their mouth - what goes in is
fast food, cheap and greasy and tasty in a very comfortable way.
.
""The Scene"" left a whole community lost for the simple way that worked.
I'm just trying to make it work a little bit longer. And unlike them, I
thrive on feedback of all temperatures.
.
I like Green Lantern in 272p on my 32"" 1080p monitor 20"" from my face.

,Taurich,2013-02-09T02:55Z,"ahhhhhh yeh OK I understand now :)

So target viewers for these rips are things like older smartphones, and people using the built-in decoder on their TV or set top box I guess?
In fact I have had friends using those report problems with x264 stuff I've given them.

That's quite a niche you're filling there, good job.

and yeh, I'm up for discussion while I wait for the 1080p WEBDL rip for this ep haha"
