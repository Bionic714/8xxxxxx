,pir8s007,2013-02-11T05:14Z,"no response from uploader. remove the torrent from my client, because uploader is not responding & seeding it... it is waste of bandwidth "
,pandy90,2013-02-14T16:58Z,"I have been looking for this all day and was relieved to have found it until I realised you're not seeding! Idiot! I have contacted dell who are sending out a Windows 8 disk for me. I will receive it tomorrow, then I will upload the ISO and I will seed for everyone to download. I will post link on here when available!"

,pandy90,2013-02-17T02:10Z,"Success. Go here to download this ISO with seeders...
