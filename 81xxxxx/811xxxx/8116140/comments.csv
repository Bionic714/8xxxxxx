Think about this fellow's incredible performances. Used to see him around Beverly Hills, always looked on the verge of upset."

,FrancoHarris,2013-02-10T20:36Z,"Sounds really good, thanks for the nice share! 
I usually don't like audiobooks where the author is also the narrator, EXCEPT when the author is a celebrated actor such as Michael Caine. Looking forward to this one."
