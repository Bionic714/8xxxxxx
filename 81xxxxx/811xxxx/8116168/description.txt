Undercover Rabbis are a three-piece heavy rock band influenced by post-rock and doom. 

Some quotes from reviews for the album "Empires":

ΓÇ£Looking for a throwback, doom riding band that prays at the dark altar of Black Sabbath? Clifton, NJ primarily instrumental trio Undercover Rabbis have got you covered with their latest effort Empires, which could easily serve as the soundtrack to the coming of The Four Horsemen.ΓÇ¥

ΓÇ£ItΓÇÖs the kind of thing youΓÇÖll find yourself coming back to over and over and appreciating more each time.ΓÇ¥

ΓÇ£Undercover Rabbis are one of those bands that donΓÇÖt fit into a specific genre, instead opting to go down their own route and leave everyone guessing as to how theyΓÇÖre going to follow it. The album on offer here isnΓÇÖt one which follows any convention or copies any band, instead presenting a sound which will confound, surprise, and leave you wondering whatΓÇÖs coming next. IΓÇÖll be interested in keeping an eye on these guys to see what comes next, I think itΓÇÖs going to be an interesting ride! ΓÇ¥
