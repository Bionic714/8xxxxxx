In this wall-framing video, Larry Haun and his brother Joe build the exterior and interior walls of a basic 1,600-sq. ft. house. Starting from the completed floor deck, they take you step by step through the entire process, showing you practical ways to organize tasks, streamline procedures and handle tools and materials efficiently.
