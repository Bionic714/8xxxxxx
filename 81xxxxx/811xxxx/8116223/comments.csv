Also with those who think XVID is great and why improve on great?
And maybe those who have better uses for their funds than the next new toy.

If you have a moment, I'd really like to get some feedback from you.
Flying by the seat of my pants here, I only know I'm on track because
people keep downloading my stuff.

What sort of equipment do you watch this with?

Really can't think of specific questions, but

Thank you for participating,
