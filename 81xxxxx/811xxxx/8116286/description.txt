Prager 20130207  3 Boy Scouts and Gays

Prager H3: If you had a son in the Scouts and his Scoutmaster was openly gay would you be comfortable
 sending your son and his troop on the overnight with that Scoutmaster?
 If so, would you be okay with sending your daughter and her troop on an overnight with a male Scoutmaster?


Prager 20130207  2 Paul Krugman and Death Panels

Prager H2: In an unguarded moment, Paul Krugman admits that Sarah Palin is right. ObamaCare will only work if
 we raise middle class taxes and create death panels.. 
 Chris Rock thinks the President is our national Mommy and Daddy. 
 Would he say that if the President was a Republican?.. 
 The Left accuses Republicans of taking food from the mouths of babies, but the Left takes fathers
 from babies with their welfare policies..


Prager 20130207  1 The Victim Mentality

Prager H1: In Los Angeles a former LAPD officer has murdered the daughter and fiancé of
 the man who fired him.
 The murderer has a victim mentality. Victims can always rationalize their actions,
 no matter how heinous
 Is there such a thing as domestic overreach? Can we have too many laws?
 The Democrats don’t think so
 Dennis talks to Max Boot, Senior Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.
