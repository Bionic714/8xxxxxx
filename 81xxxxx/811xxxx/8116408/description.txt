After many days of travel, you've reached the forest town of Grove. On the outskirts of town, and once inside the fiery dungeon gates, you'll find fame, adventure and fortune. Get tips from townspeople and acquire power with unique weaponry and magic spells. Your invincible pet defends you against monsters that lurk within dark, dangerous corridors. Determine your FATE with unlimited replay and countless levels in this superb dungeon-crawling RPG!

Release Notes:
To install, simply extract anywhere. To play, run the Fate application.

To customize your resolution, open config.dat in a text editor and edit SCREENWIDTH:800 SCREENHEIGHT:600 to equal your monitor's supported resolution.
Don't worry, as Fate can run on almost any custom resolution. (Got a 1920x1080 screen? Use it!)

I have included the xmod_setup.exe for those who wish to apply the xmod (best mod ever for Fate).
Simply run it, select the Fate install directory, and choose what features you want to install.

Besides the normal Fate.exe, I have included a backup of the original, uncracked version saved as Fate.exe.bak.
I have also included a backup of the crack, should you accidentally delete it, saved as Fate.exe.crk
