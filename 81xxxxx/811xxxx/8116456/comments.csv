,turtlex,2013-02-08T13:25Z,I read a manga from your previous torrent just yesterday and that started me thinking about the rest of your collection.  Thanks for the upload!  It's much appreciated.

If someone sees any problem with any of the comics, please tell me."

[T],LukeSky3,2013-02-09T06:56Z,I think almost all of them are scans from the original and then translated to en.
