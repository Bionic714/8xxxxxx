When John Lennon walked on to the set of the Ed Sullivan show in 1964 his first words were ΓÇ£Is this the stage that Buddy Holly played on?ΓÇ¥ When Bob Dylan accepted a Grammy in 1998 he stated, ΓÇ£And I just want to say that when I was sixteen or seventeen years old, I went to see Buddy Holly play at Duluth National Guard Armory and I was three feet away from him...and he looked at me. And I just have some sort of feeling that he was - I don't know how or why - but I know he was with us all the time we were making this record in some kind of way.ΓÇ¥ The conclusion of this is simple; Buddy Holly is in no uncertain terms a musical legend. As an artist he is a primary influence behind The Beatles, Bob Dylan, The Beach Boys and The Rolling Stones, even if his music were near unlistenable his name would be cemented in musical history for that alone. 

As with any artist of this stature there is a certain mystique that surrounds their music and honest opinions (most notably negative ones) are hard to come by. Just look at The Beatles, how can anyone say the Beatles made bad music, when they are The Beatles; the biggest, most significant and most successful musical act of all time? Thankfully such moral dilemmas are of no issue here because in addition to being massively musical significant Holly was also a hugely talented and innovative musician in his own right, and that is an often understated aspect of his legacy.
