Acidic jazz? Folk-step? Speed metal? Ever since the shock turn of the last album's lead single 'Spanish Sahara' - the most WTF moment since Kid A (not least in Oxford) and a contender for this century's best video starring an animal carcass - trying to work out what a new Foals record will sound like is now one of music's mightiest puzzles. Just as group chief Yannis Philippakis told DS the other week, "You can peg a band quite quickly, usually." Not his, though.

And 'Inhaler', the first single from Holy Fire, we didn't see coming; hard-boiled cuffs and greasy, pushy guitars trigger the heaviest Foals have ever sounded. Yannis may be squealing for some personal space ("I lost the beat, I cannot breathe, don't follow me"), but when their noise is this frantic, his claustrophobia is comforting in its familiarity. 'My Number', however, is so gloriously catchy, you could almost forgive trolling will.i.am and repeatedly warning: "This is the future of disco. Dope?"
