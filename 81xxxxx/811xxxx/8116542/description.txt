"The creation of this album was the logical continuation of my work in Can's last years of active existence. It took me about 2 years to work this album out (1977-1979). I had an exiting time finding out how the different worlds of film or radio could meet in a piece of music as if they would have belonged together from the very beginning. And it was also a pleasure to play all instruments myself if only possible. I wished that music would become a perfect carrier to an imaginable new and visionary world and it should become a pleasure to the human ear to follow the music on this trip".
Recorded at Inner Space Studio.
Mixed at Conny's Studio.
