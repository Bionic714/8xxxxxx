A couple things about this show:

1. This is split into two sets. The first 5 songs are Daniel solo, then he takes a break and after that (starting with track 8) he is with a band (Sleeping In The Aviary).
2. I started taping the opening band (Sleeping In The Aviary), but they were just so God awful I stopped about 3 songs in and deleted it, sorry if there are fans out there, but it just wasn't my thing.
