This one has all the trappings of an impromptu performance. After meeting
British heavyweights bassist John Edwards and drummer Mark Sanders in the
spring of 2002, Norwegian saxophonist Frode Gjerstad called them in advance of
a trip to London that summer, and they decided to record a set in London's
Welsh Chapel, with which they used Gjerstad's recording gear that he brought
with him. The session clicks on almost every level for a variety of
reasons. The saxophonist is clearly inspired by his rhythm section (who
wouldn't be?), as they prod him to near-Elysian heights. Whether exploring the
altissimo range on "The Welsh Chapel, Pt. 3" or just pounding away ferociously
there and on every track, Gjerstad soars with the swiftness of an eagle
readying to strike its prey. While a full hour of crushing pebbles sometimes
makes for difficult listening, impressive solos by both Edwards and Sanders
offer some respite, and Gjerstad's quieter sonorities on clarinet lessen the
bite, though not the artistic value. By the time of this recording, Gjerstad
had fully demonstrated his connection to the take-no-prisoners approach of,
say, a Peter Br√∂tzmann (with whom Gjerstad has recorded with usually
outstanding results), but often the key to success lies in the vagaries of the
moment and the compatibility of the sidemen. Here is an example of Gjerstad at
his finest, blowing hard and firm, but connecting in mysterious ways with his
hosts. For those wanting to be introduced to this exciting player, this album
may be the place to start.
