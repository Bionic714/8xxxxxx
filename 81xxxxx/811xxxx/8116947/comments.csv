,greebomc,2013-04-14T00:54Z,"Each Country obviously does it's own commentary to the contest. At some point, however, Terry Wogan the commentator for the UK broadcast became quite jaded toward all the politics and favoritism inherent in the contest. Ever since his commentaries have been hilarious to listen to. Caustic, sarcastic, tongue-in-cheek comments made by him can half make you believe he's drinking a whisky and talking to you personally. 
Thanks for the upload."
