Not long for the 2013 finals in Malmo Sweden so we take a very lighthearted, cheeky look at the Worlds longest running and most popular international Song Contest.   Every year it racks up more views than the Superbowl, yet few in North America have even heard about it.

I attended the 2010 Event in Dusseldorf and what fun we had with the AuldStadt turned into a giant European Party.  This song contest has even shaped the political future of the continent and one day the UK may even win it again????
