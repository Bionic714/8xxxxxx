Skytturnar.White.Whales.1987.DVDRip.XviD-TiG


Two whale hunters try to adjust to the city life once the whaling season is over. Unfortunately, the duo is like fish on dry land and during a night on the town, the duo lands in a heap of trouble after they are thrown out of one establishment after another. As events escalate the two men break into a weapons shop and arm themselves with rifles for a confrontation with the police.

A whale-boat is making its final whaling tour of the season. It pursues and catches a whale, and then proceeds home. The men working on the boat have to find themselves different employment now that the season is over. Among the crew are two friends, Grímur and Bubbi. They are well- seasoned and experienced seamen of the kind that never puts down roots anywhere. Grímur is not the kind of man to allow much to set him off balance. When he arrives on land he heads directly for the capital where he intends to make a new start and get himself involved in the night life. With him is his faithful and rather troll-like companion, Bubbi. The film then mainly concerns itself with their efforts to make some kind of contact with what is going on in Reykjavik. Most of these attempts are pathetic: the two men are like fish on dry land. They land in all kinds of trouble, and are thrown out of one place after another. At the end of the film they break into a sports shop and arm themselves with rifles. As the police gather and surround them, they finally succeed in making their presence in the world felt. However, the turn of events is now completely out of control.
