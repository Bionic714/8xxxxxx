Web Form Builder provides awesome, easy-to-use Web forms, straight outta' the box.

Web forms are necessary, but they can definitely be perplexing. They're a chore to code and hard to design--and then there's all that tough back-end stuff! That's why Web Form Builder does the dirty work for you: Just drag elements into place to see your form come to life.

There's no need to configure anything, since form results are displayed automatically in a slick overview (we call it the S-Drive Dashboard). Plus, you can embed forms anywhere--including your shop, blog, forum or website--without uploading any scripts.

DREAM IT UP--DRAG IT IN

The form you've been dreaming of can be whipped up in seconds. Registration forms, order forms, surveys, invitations, applications, contact requests, subscriptions--tackle the unlimited possibilities as often as you want. Drag input fields and other form elements where you want them, then adjust text, labels, and options to your liking. Voila, your new Web form has been born!

System Requirements:  Intel Mac OS X.6 or better
