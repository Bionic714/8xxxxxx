,niceedee,2013-02-09T04:40Z,Thank you for all your movies!
,hobittual,2013-02-09T08:44Z,"What a crap film. It is like so many other films, a precocious American brat and his long suffering, ""funny guy"" partner, with a whole bunch of sweaty m/f ""Space Marine"" types, at a busy ""Space port"" scenario. Where this utter wanker of a leading man, seizes the opportunity to turn hero and ends up snogging the obvious love interest who paid him scant attention from the off and who proved to be surprisingly capable in the middle bit.
What should have happened is that when, early on, space wanker tells his spaceport supervisor that 
""I didn't get top marks at 'the Academy' (There's always an Academy in these spacey yawns) to drive a bus""
the supervisor should have battered space wanker with his crutch and the film should have carried on with space wanker working in the canteen, with nothing remarkable happening to him, ever.
Hollywood does it again.....

Thanks Uppy."
,topeak,2013-02-09T10:06Z,"It's not a film, Hobittual, you arrogant dumbass, it's a backdoor pilot for a series that was never picked up. It was filmed in Canada as well. 

It's one thing to be a complete dumbass, but quite another to be a complete dumbass publicly. Well done. "
,spankdaddy,2013-02-09T17:54Z,"my god hbbitual your just a mouth, not only was your dribble done in a clueless manner it was done so all of us could laugh at you. ummmm what i will say is you looked like a fool thank you takes the shine away from me LOL "
,MailerDaemon0,2013-02-09T19:22Z,"Wow... Thaks for thr up but this is a SLOW assed torrent.. Slowest one seen arund here in a while actually.

Hope its worth the wait... I oved the BSG reboot from a few years back and am curious about this ""prequel"""
,segadora,2013-02-09T22:37Z,"@spankdaddy You clueless leeching cad. 
Mirror check yourself. The proper grammar of
the derogative word that you will never
comprehend is ""drivel"", not ""dribble"". 
[Dribble is something you dumbfucks do wit a basaball.] 
I really get a kick out of useless dipshits. Yes,
well done to you sir... Some advice; Do get a
reimbursement for your hooked on phonetics
course and go to school.

Good review hobittual.
You hit the nail on the head. I knew there was a
reason that this didn't get picked up by a network.

Thanks for the up Juggs"

,seednope,2013-02-10T01:35Z,"sirrahleoj, I certainly hope English is not your first language, because your grasp of it seems tenuous at best.   Please go study up and leave the threads which utilize this language alone until you get things properly sorted. 

I watched this movie drunk last night and don't remember much. I think it might be gay male porn.

,Devastation101,2013-02-10T02:15Z,after telling him off you put basaball?  Lmao.  Thanks for the up juggs
,phorqued,2013-02-10T02:30Z,"segadora- All I can do is LOL. You were right on the ""drivel"" but so totally off on the ""dribble."" If I were to try to dribble a baseball... well, lets say it most likely would not go so well for me or the baseball. Try a basketball. 

Other than that nonsense I am downloading now to watch it. I suspect this will be a one off though. "
,Vince82,2013-02-10T02:36Z,Frack!!  Why there is so much Fracking people Fracking complaining.  I think the quality is not too fracking bad and same for the fracking movie.  You guys are just fracked up.  I'm getting the frack out of here.
,Amerika72,2013-02-10T04:56Z,"@pjatgv 

Vince82 says frack becaue that's what they fracking say in BSG, proving you're not even a fracking fan, so why bother dumb fuck, and for all the fucking stupid tobacco smoking brits or english twits, suck a dick, your army can't even beat a bunch of farmers. Your country is about to be taken over.........and you will be a slave soon.........enjoy your freedom."

If either of you snot dribbling tools had any
experience or even noticed that I put 
[bas-a-ball] in brackets for a reason called 
sarcastic ridicule of spankdaddy's incorrect 
phonetic usage of the word ""dribble"" when he
should have written ""drivel"" (Which by the way
his retort also didn't even look legible with the 
lack of his understanding of the simplest 
usage of words like; you, you're, your, ect.) 
after he tried to slam hobittual's spot on review 
of this lame assed queer boy flick you wouldn't 
seem so naive.

Ask any black kid on the street what they call
the basketball in his hand that he stole and 99% 
of them will say its a ""basaball!"" of course thanks 
to their hooked on phonetics courses... None of 
this would have to have been pointed out to you 
if either of you were actually bright enough to 
make an actual argument or have and wordly experience!

My advice; Get out of the tool shed and go around 
the block a few times. LOL








My original statement stands.
I really get a kick out fucking with mature 3rd graders
LOL"

A true Battleship movie that is full of excitment and good effects. Recommend it to anyone who likes a bit of SciFi. Pity if never made it as a weekly show. "
,caribou24,2013-02-13T04:19Z,"This movie was a slow download. Suspect it should of been in TV section. If you put Battlestar into the search option comes up with more versions with a lot more seeders.
It also comes up with 10 episodes but the full movie is actually a compilation of the 10 episodes. More info at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica:_Blood_%26_Chrome"
,DOAP,2013-02-13T22:22Z,To bad they r not finishing the show i enjoyed it very much.. tnx for the up
,WoundedWolfgirl,2013-03-01T05:32Z,Thanks! Love BSG and its various spinoffs. Wish they would have picked this up as a series. Although they probably then would have pulled a Caprica and canceled it after a few episodes.
