,dbranson17,2013-02-15T04:26Z,"What is this garbage? - this isn't 480p!
Who the h@ll posts 4:3 video anymore?!"
,Cy4n1d3,2013-02-15T10:19Z,"Let's see here...
This video's resolution is 640x480.
Seems pretty 480p to me.

Also recommend you put up a 720p version yourself if you're that fucking offended over a free SD episode."

@dbranson17, people who don’t have 72"" HD and digital cable. If you’re so rich and have all the latest stuff, then as Cy4n1d3 said, you upload a high-res HD copy.

If you only want to watch it, then this is good enough. If you want to archive it forever, then you should wait for the DVD and buy it."
,dbranson17,2013-02-18T19:04Z,"480p IS NOT a cut down, 4:3 frame... whoever this is butchered the episode for no reason other than stupidity and/or laziness.  ""Rich and latest"" - dumbass..."
,Cy4n1d3,2013-02-24T01:28Z,"????????
What in the fuck do you think 480p is then?"
,mofo5,2013-03-08T14:27Z,thanx
