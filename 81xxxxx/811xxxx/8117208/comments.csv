It supports abstinence-only sexual education, non-LGBT adoption, corporal punishment, creationism, school prayer, and strong gender roles."" ????

If so: pretty scary/manipulative  stuff here!

Focus on the Family is far from the worst out there.  The real challenge is developing a moral code for society free from religious prejudices that can actually challenge what the church has actively controlled for thousands of years."
