Weather Toys: Building and Hacking Your Own 1-Wire Weather Station (ExtremeTech)


Do more than TALK about the weather

Maybe you can't change it, but you can measure it. And once you build your weather station, the sky's the limit. You can share updates on your own weather Web site. Create a smart sprinkler for a lot less than that fancy system on TV. Free up your PC with a stand-alone weather station. Protect against lightning strikes with a surge suppressor. Take your weather station with you. Finding out which way the wind is blowing can be a lot of fun.
