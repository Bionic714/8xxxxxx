One of our wisest and most clear-eyed economic thinkers offers a masterful narrative of the crisis and its lessons

Many fine books on the financial crisis were first drafts of historyΓÇöbooks written to fill the need for immediate understanding. Alan S. Blinder, esteemed Princeton professor, Wall Street Journal columnist, and former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, held off, taking the time to understand the crisis and to think his way through to a truly comprehensive and coherent narrative of how the worst economic crisis in postwar American history happened, what the government did to fight it, and what we can do from hereΓÇömired as we still are in its wreckage.

With bracing clarity, Blinder shows us how the U.S. financial system, which had grown far too complex for its own goodΓÇöand too unregulated for the public goodΓÇöexperienced a perfect storm beginning in 2007. Things started unraveling when the much-chronicled housing bubble burst, but the ensuing implosion of what Blinder calls the ΓÇ£bond bubbleΓÇ¥ was larger and more devastating. Some people think of the financial industry as a sideshow with little relevance to the real economyΓÇöwhere the jobs, factories, and shops are. But finance is more like the circulatory system of the economic body: if the blood stops flowing, the body goes into cardiac arrest. When AmericaΓÇÖs financial structure crumbled, the damage proved to be not only deep, but wide. It took the crisis for the world to discover, to its horror, just how truly interconnectedΓÇöand fragileΓÇöthe global financial system is. Some observers argue that large global forces were the major culprits of the crisis. Blinder disagrees, arguing that the problem started in the U.S. and was pushed abroad, as complex, opaque, and overrated investment products were exported to a hungry world, which was nearly poisoned by them.

The second part of the story explains how American and international government intervention kept us from a total meltdown. Many of the U.S. governmentΓÇÖs actions, particularly the FedΓÇÖs, were previously unimaginable. And to an amazingΓÇöand certainly misunderstoodΓÇöextent, they worked. The worst did not happen. Blinder offers clear-eyed answers to the questions still before us, even if some of the choices ahead are as divisive as they are unavoidable. After the Music Stopped is an essential history that we cannot afford to forget, because one thing history teaches is that it will happen again.
