Storyline

Rebecca is set to spend her first Spring Break home from college with her old high school cheer-leading friends. As luck would have it, the group of six sexy girls have been granted the usage of a rental property in the Florida coastal town of Manatee Creek. However, they are soon to find that their vacation may be anything but... Just down the road, in Daytona Beach; "Crazy Girls Unlimited" - a company famous for it's drunken topless DVD releases - had been throwing a event for their latest video series. However, the shoot ended early when a killer, complete with medieval weaponry, showed up to end the festivities. Unaware of what has transpired at the "Crazy Girls" party, Rebecca and her friends decide to throw a Spring Break Free-For-All -- But the girls get more than they bargained for when one-by-one the party-goers disappear. It seems an uninvited stranger has been literally cutting through the guest list - straight from the party in Daytona
