She played bluegrass. He played punkΓÇª.

When Grace Shultz and Tony White met they began
experimenting with an unlikely blend of genres. 
By mixing punk, folk, bluegrass and texas swing, 
they created something new. A blend of music for 
those searching for whatΓÇÖs beyond the norm. 
ΓÇ£PunkgrassΓÇ¥ was born.

Honing their newfound brand of music on the sidewalks 
of downtown Nashville, Grace and Tony had no idea where 
their music might lead them. But Determined to be heard 
by a bigger audience, the duo began booking local shows 
across Tennessee and the surrounding areas. 

2011 also found the two busy in the studio. 
Working with Stephen D Jones and Lloyd Aur Norman, 
at Villain Place in Nashville, Grace and Tony emerged with
their first seven song EP. ΓÇ£Inside a 7 Track MindΓÇ¥ has 
taken songs of murder, addiction, lost love, and shame, 
wrapping them with a happy twist.

Since the albumΓÇÖs release, new doors have opened for 
Grace and Tony that they never thought possible. 
Already elling several hundred copies of their album and
headlining the Historic Crockett Theater in Tennessee,
the future looks exciting for these two, and they cannot 
wait to share it with all of you.

This winter will see the release
of their new album ΓÇ£NovemberΓÇ¥ 

Keep an eye out for new videos 
and songs in the coming months.

Thanks for stopping by!
