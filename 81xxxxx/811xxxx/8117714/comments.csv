,korgpaboy,2013-02-08T14:32Z,Is this works on Os x 10.8.2? Is there crack/patch any guide how to?
,Wilk1994,2013-02-08T14:44Z,"It works perfectly on OS X 10.6.8. On OS X 10.8.2 it should be run. In the package are guide, update to 9.03 and crack."
,wharfrat22,2013-02-09T22:09Z,Help please. When installing the 9.03 update it not only fails but deletes the previous 9.0 installation. The Digidesign folder is still in apps but the actual Pro Tools app gets deleted. Is it because I skipped the 9.01 & .02 updates? Would really appreciate some help. Thank you much. 
,wharfrat22,2013-02-09T22:31Z,Okay I got it to install but I'm guessing it doesn't work on mountain lion (10.8.2). If someone knows something i don't please let me know...thanks again.
,KingNick7,2013-02-09T22:32Z,"Hi I just finished downloading and installing exactly the way you instructed in the ""How To Install.txt"". Everything installed perfectly, but My Pro Tools App will not open. When I click it on my Dock it jumps up once and that's it...WON'T OPEN. Could it be because I don't have any hardware hooked up? I did some research and from what I know you don't need anything hooked up to run Pro Tools 9. 

I AM IN DESPERATE NEED OF ASSISTANCE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. "
,KingNick7,2013-02-09T22:34Z,"And by the way i'm working on:

MacBook 

Mac OS X Version 10.6.8"
,KingNick7,2013-02-09T22:39Z,"I Have A MackBook OS X Version 10.6.8

Everything installed PERFECTLY, BUT IT WON'T OPEN. Could it be because of me not having any hardware hooked up? From what I KNOW you DON'T need all of that for PRO TOOLS 9. 

HELP ME!!! Thanks"
,brad0131,2013-02-10T00:45Z,How did you get it to install successfully wharfrat22?
,druggie,2013-02-10T18:01Z,"this does NOT work with MAc OSX 10.8.2. If you update the software then it asks for the usb dongle to authorize its use.

If there is a crack for 10.8.2 or any solutions then please post."
,wharfrat22,2013-02-10T19:38Z,"brad, It installed but wouldn't open...I was under the impression that 9.03 would work on ML...nope. Have to wait for an .06 crack, put back on PT8, or of course buy it.  To broke for the latter.  "
,werdna,2013-02-12T22:37Z,"Working fine on Mac OS 10.6.8. All my plugins still work just fine. Using no hardware. Runs smooth, no glitches so far. Have not tested this yet on Mac OS Mountain Lion. Will do that ASAP and will post the results. Thank you."
,KingNick7,2013-02-12T23:16Z,ok i reinstalled it opens but ask for an ilok authorization......??????? I thought this was the crack version
,cin_drumz,2013-02-20T00:43Z,"@KingNick7 ,
You need to make sure you install the dmg w the [k] this will overwrite the authorization.

Thanks uploader. Works great on my macbook pro and im running on osx 10.6.8"
,djsnugg,2013-03-01T22:46Z,can someone please make a cracked version  that will work on lion osx 10.8.2
,nxtleo,2013-03-14T14:38Z,anyone know why i keep failure when i try to install the 9.0.3 update??? my mac is running on OS X 10.8.2
,pipco_2,2013-03-24T23:36Z,"This and all pro tools 9 incarnations on this site will only run on osx-10.6.8, with update to 9.0.3.

ProTools will only run on osx-lion or ML with PT 9.0.5 and up, and these PT9,s are only k'ed to 9.0.3, so don't waste your time unless you have snow leopard installed."
,leo406,2013-03-29T17:53Z,A mi me funcionó bien en un mac pro...

,Wskarxxx,2013-04-12T21:32Z,"Basic installation file works fine, updater fail to install and it removes some files from the the previous installation. [K] does not help to correct it.
Any suggestions? "
,jc_217,2013-05-04T08:55Z,I am also having the problem where when i try to open up pro tools...it bounces up like its going to open....but it won't open?..any suggestions?? i am running on 10.6.8
,jc_217,2013-05-04T08:56Z,i did everything as stated on the instructions
,vedpappan,2013-05-08T16:39Z,"Kingnick7 and Jc_217, perhaps u made the same mistake as me? I went straight to the 9.0.3 (K) after the first installer. But when I uninstalled and installed with all three, first the 9.0, then the 9.0.3, and then the 9.0.3(K) file, it worked..."
,forgotenone187,2013-05-23T20:30Z,i got it to open but it asks for the iLok
