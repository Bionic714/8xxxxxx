Arkenstone over at:
http://thepiratebay.sx/user/Arkenstone
has been upping these when they come out also.
I am going to be busy the next few days prepping stuff for patch day, if I lag behind on the releases again, you should definitely check out Arkenstone's stuff. He has been helping me keep an eye on this stuff in the past when I get busy and he has a good attention to quality and detail. Good uploader in my book. I got my provl office versions from him and they work flawlessly with these kmsnano activators..."
[V],murphy78,2013-02-08T14:42Z,"If something is not quite right with the description, please forgive me. I have spent all day slamming my head against Windows Vista doing dual-boot sysprepping and forgetting that you can't run install programs from different directories if they have uninstalls...

my brain is a bit fried atm, so I apologize if the description has an error in a step or something.

,w4r3zh4ck,2013-02-08T16:12Z,I once tried sysprep and it didn't work. Wasted 5 hours of my day -.-
[V],murphy78,2013-02-08T21:11Z,Yah it's pretty picky on what you can and can't install depending on the uninstallers and such
,Sonic_27,2013-02-08T22:04Z,Once again.....Thanks murphy78 =)
