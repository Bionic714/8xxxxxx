KMSNano is an Offline KMS Activator that emulates a KMS server in the memory of
your computer and sends activation data back and forth attempting to activate
volume versions of Windows and Office. I have personally activated KMSNano without
having my lan drivers even installed on a fresh install of Windows 7.

There are other earlier versions that may or may not work currently.
You should always check for the latest version before using.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Activates:
Windows Vista Business/Enterprise Default/N/VL
Windows 7 Pro/Enterprise Default/N/VL
Windows 8 Pro/Enterprise Default/N/VL
Windows Server Std/Data 2008/2008R2/2012
Office/OfficeVL 2010/2013.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------Please read this non-KMS Windows versions list-------
Retail-Only Versions of windows that will **NOT** activate are:
Vista Starter/Homebasic/Homepremium/Ultimate - Default/N/E
7 Starter/Homebasic/Homepremium/Ultimate - Default/N/E
8 core/coreN/ProWMC
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Requirements: . NET 4.0 or Windows 8

Instructions:

1. Extract the zip file to a directory.
2. Run KMSnano_setup.exe It will install to a folder, add shortcuts,
and trigger install. This checks activation when you log on and will
Run the Activator if 30 days or left are less on activation
3. Copy the password from the readme file to the installer to install.
4. Wait about 45-60secs for an initial activation if you aren't activated
(It takes longer for Retail to VL Office 2013 conversion)
5. Done. Run the Check link on start menu to verify your activation.

For Windows 8, it can take a minute or two of doing system things for the
watermark to go away. You don't need to reboot. Activators that require
a reboot are hacks and you should immediately run a "SFC /SCANNOW" if
you have used one. (SFC is the System File Checker) Esp. KJ Hacktivator

Note that Pre-Release versions of Office or Windows will NEVER activate.
You can try the UpDown8 v1.3.exe tool if you have a version that is
unsupported like enterprise trial version, but you use at your own risk.
(Inside kmsnano.exe - Extract using 7z or winrar to use)

Why use this program over any other activation method?
-It does not modify any of your system files.
-Because it's not a crack or a hack.
-Because it's the only way to get legit activation without using legit servers.
-Did I mention it activates ALL KMS activation software?

Change Log:
- Setup Encrypted (because there is fakes KMSnano in the net)
- Runs unzipped.
- Possible work with Vista and XP (beta)

All is Done (for now).

Recommendations:

- Disable SmartScreen.
- Disable microsoft security updates.
- Make exceptions to %programfiles%KMSnano in Antivirus.

Included is KMSnano Documentation v13.1.pdf Please read this first if you have
any problems. Currently "Silent.cmd" replaces functionality of "kmsnano.exe"
When you run the activator by installing or running "silent.cmd" you will
generate "kmsnano.log" in your install folder. You may want this if you need
to relay some info on the MDL boards about an unsupported language or something.

Over the Rainbow is gone and the program currently has an applause track when
the activator finishes. You can edit Silent.cmd and remove the /music line.
The next time the activator runs with the /music line missing it will not play
the applause.

(Big Salute to heldigard and all the peeps who contributed to this project)
