Sushi Girl 2012 BRRip 720p x264 AAC - PRiSTiNE [P2PDL]
				
Genre: Action | Crime | Thriller
Fish has spent six years in jail. Six years alone. Six years keeping 
his mouth shut about the robbery, about the other men involved. 
The night he is released, the four men he protected with silence 
celebrate his freedom with a congratulatory dinner. 
The meal is a lavish array of sushi, served off the naked body 
of a beautiful young woman. The sushi girl seems catatonic, trained to 
ignore everything in the room, even if things become dangerous. 
Sure enough, the four unwieldy thieves can't help but open old 
wounds in an attempt to find their missing loot.
Director: Kern Saxton
