,Nimh,2013-02-08T17:39Z,"How do you upvote Mr Wingz? 

He provides daily Judge Judy fix because i'm at work and don't have recorder. 

Appreciate it, while some consider it trashy daytime TV, i really like ole' Judith, she was a great public servant when she works with the family courts and actually cared about the people and criticized shitty bureaucracy. 

If you didnt upload , impossible to find.
