We need your help! The major torrent groups don't seem to think this show deserves priority (or its just new and on tbs so no one knows about it) so we need a private citizen who can upload this show for us every thursday night.  I mean come on, this is an awesome show about nerds, gamers, and hackers, it was made to be here on the bay!!

Anyway, anyone who could help out would receive tons of love from all of us nerds out here. Thanks"
