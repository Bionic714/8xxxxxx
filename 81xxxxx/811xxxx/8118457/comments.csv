,2bpirating,2013-02-08T17:06Z,"Followed the making of this documentary since the very first announcement on KickStarter.
Even before seeing this documentary, I already like to thank you Simon, and anyone who contributed for making the complex story of internet ""piracy"" more accessible to the less geeky people. More people need to know what has happened and what is still happening on the internet.

I will seed this forever."

Simon thank you for making this movie, I really enjoied it and liked it. Rises a lot of questions and all I can say is that, if 20-25 milion ppl use it on a daily basis and this figure is rising everyday, than something needs to change otherwise all those ppl are supposed 2 b criminals...Really think they need to understand the ppl who use internet and stop trying to censure internet like dictators. Internet is FREE and should b available to everyone , its basic human right! They cant tell us what we can and can not download or watch...
Cant believe what those american soldiers did on that video, they killed an inocent walker with a missile from a rocket pod OMG!!! They should hang from a tree for that, those motherfuckers!!!
Wish you all the best in your further career Simon Close "
