,Vic1987,2013-02-08T19:49Z,"Great Video, People need to be aware as most already are that the world will soon be ran by corporations who want nothing more than to own every city and control food, medicine, supply & demand and most importantly; information.

Greedy scumbags don't want you to be educated!, They rather watch us suffer in vain like uneducated caged animals who can't fight back.

But you know what? The determination shown by tpb users and founders everday shows the world that we are not only stronger in ""numbers"" but in a sense that we are so universal from all around the world, We are therefore unstoppable.

Actors get paid more than athletes, and keep in mind athletes actually suffer injuries.

My point is, its a money game as most of you already know. Sharing is caring, Seed like the wind bullseye!

,Haze7,2013-02-09T00:44Z,I think that this movie is a bad idea.......because this will influence more people to pirate movies which could eventually throw off the balance of the number of movies sold and pirated.

If your subtitles are SRT format (or even IDX/SUB, though that'll take a little more work), and you can watch DivX/Xvid AVIs on your player, you can use AVIAddXSubs to mux the subtitles into the AVIs. You'll still be able to switch the subtitle display on and off with your remote. "

I'll be honest, I don't have the kind of knowledge and expertise the founding fathers and sustainers of TBP have, but I promise every tool I DO have (word of mouth, knowledge of several languages, general annoyingness, ect ;)) at my disposal to do what I can for TBP and ""piracy."" I'm primarily a comic book nerd, a fan of caped-crusaders and superheroes, and truly, to me, you all are the modern-day equivalent of all my favorite Golden Age heroes. You are the true Robin Hoods and progressive activists of our era, and I stand behind you one million %. I'm sure you got a million haters hating everyday, so I hope you always keep in mind the greatest heroes of history were often the ones most persecuted in their time. 

In summary, you. are. truly. heroes.

In any case, I just wanted to comment on something that maybe someone else noticed too: when Fredrik marries his wife in Cambodia/Laos, the officer asks for money to be payed and they talk about 200.000 BAHT and 400.000 BAHT in case they divorce...those figures translate into €5 and €10, a very far cry from the $12.000 stated in the subtitles...somebody should check that out :-)"

I know he asked for a pardon, but he didn't run, hide and do drugs like gottfrid and he's not a racist prick like fredrik.  pretty comical when fredrik said something on the boat like ""yeah, i'll do the prison time, but i'd rather not..."" then you find out he got a reduced sentence from the original year he received and still fled the country and is wanted by interpol.  like i said, love tpb, but don't run like a bunch of cowards.

Dere må sikte høyre enn dere gjør. Etter å ha sett filmen sitter jeg igjen med en følelse av at dere ikke forstår hvor viktige dere er. Dere forstår ikke hvor viktige dere er. Dere forstår ikke hvor viktige dere er.

Forsøk å forestille dere en verden uten åndsverklover og patenter. Alle fordeler dette vil gi krever en terabyte å nevne.

Det usunne system vi har i dag presser frem et ønske i industri om å ligge langt lenger forut for sin tid enn hva som er sunt for å bruke utviklingskroner på en mest mulig effektiv måte. Det er et visst krav om å få patent og i frykt for å komme under dette krav så siktes det høyt. Dette etterlater seg store huller av innsikt. Hvis utviklingen derimot går sakte frem og ingen tillates å gjøre store byks med beskyttelse fra bandittsat så vil vi på sikt få en fremtid som raskere byr på nyvinninger. Dette er det vesentlige argument imot patenter som åpenbart virker i mot sin hensikt hvis formål er nyvinninger.

Hva angår film og musikk så kan nøyaktig samme argumentasjon benyttes. Idag produses filmer til en milliard dollar kroner stykket med et spinkelt budskap nettopp fordi åndsverklover eksisterer. Uten disse lover ville ikke slike sinnsvake filmprosjekter påbegynnes. Vi ville heller få enkle filmer med et stort budskap. Således fungerer også åndsverklover i mot sin hensikt hvis formål er å få sunne og gode filmer. 

Vær så snill å se å skaffe dere et politisk ståsted der hvor dere åpenbart hører hjemme, ytterst til høyre. Dere ønsker utvikling, men ikke statsbeskyttelse for tull og fanteri. Dere trenger å ta et fast standpunkt politisk for å komme videre med hva som er viktig i denne sak."

TPB's politiske budskap tilhører ikke nødvendigvis på høyresiden. Liberale holdninger til drakoniske opphavsrettslover er tradisjonelt noe som har blitt frontet av dem ytterst til venstre.

The so called 'Good Guys' do not have organization or resources. And when they do, they also turn into the 'Bad Guy'. This is a never ending cycle and a nature of humanity. Yes there are scumbags out there. TPB shows that you don't really need Unity between seeders. We don't have to agree on anything at all, so as long as we do 1 thing which is called Pass it Forward. This is the essence of success for all of man kind. Give freely and it will come around. Only problem is, 1 small group just takes it, and gives nothing back. They will eventually be booted out of Evolution, but not any time soon. It's an evolutionary process which we all know takes A LONG LONG Time, but rest assured, we are all going to act like nature wants us to. That will never change, not about Humanity, nor about any other Living species. So you see, some people are Organized in their goal and it takes a few of them to control MANY who are not organized. But Like I said, if the 90 percent all act out whats in their nature (To go against the 10 percent) this tangle will always be present. Humanity depends on this cycle even though it is truly an embarrassment to our existence. "

,nikoboomboom,2013-02-18T19:05Z,"bah, so you guys are all going to jail?? this really sucks - the movie made me depressed... it wasn't unexpected, knowing that the powerful always win, but i really hoped that you'd somehow make it out clean.. i think we are all doomed - all the regular people.. we'll never win anything anymore - anything. soon the world will be like a big U.S. - just elusioned robots with no choice but to follow orders and prettend they're loving it.. 
..
thanks to you though we still enjoy (with a risk) bits of freedom, but prolly not for long... and it's our own fault - closing our eyes to all kind of injustice has long ago become the first rule to survive, evem though this way we're surviving just a slavery..
..
i am glad you still exist. i know that when it comes to jail you are really on your own, and the support we try to give you won't help you much, but at least know that you have it. i just wish we could do more.
..
thank you!
..

ps: just one question - why popups?? :"

,saddamlevine,2013-02-20T03:58Z,was looking forward to this....but it's disappointing....more like a compilation of shakily filmed reality show segments than a well thought out documentary
,avalon27,2013-02-20T11:16Z,long live the Pirate Bay !!!
,Ufoeke,2013-02-20T18:03Z,Yay! 1TB upload and still rising :) Happy seeding folks!
,Grajjie,2013-02-23T00:09Z,"Great movie. TPB will never back down from political corruption. 

P.S - I kept trying to wipe my screen when the text came up with the smudges of dirt LOL."
,SparedParts,2013-02-24T21:40Z,"wow!  I couldn't finish the movie...  after I heard that guy say we don't support TPB, we do it because it's easy and free... what bullshit.

How can somebody really make a difference and help TPB...??? (serious question)

well, back to the movie I go... good shit just in the first 15 minutes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,barkolino,2013-02-26T16:03Z,whats the imdb rating?
,trancephorm,2013-03-02T20:18Z,"I'm generally dissapointed by the lack of moral and ethic questions not placed by defendents... No wonder: Fredrik obviously don't really understand a thing about wrongness of copyright. Gottfrid is not much better than him, and only Peter is worth something, but I still do think he could defend himself much much better.

They just didn't defend them very well, that's my impression, not that I think the verdict would be different, but they just didn't do all they can. They really need to understand my ""4-points against copyrights""... wink.gif

1) Nobody has a moral right to forbid you to push any virtual on-screen buttons, whatever you do by that. Or surf wherever you like...
2) Nobody can proove 1 copy is equal to 1 sale. Or less, or more... Nobody can quantify that, there's no relation between.
3) When you copy something - you multiply it, you don't steal anything from anyone because he still has it.
4) Digial goods are new and very special kind of goods - As much as the facility of copying is crippling in the sense of economy, in the same time it helps real quality products to spread more easily on the web, making them better product for (digital) sales... What we have here is actually natural quality selection of digital goods."

,buddda,2013-04-05T00:06Z,Amazing film. Thank you for such an interesting look at something that is great than what I thought it to be.
,yogdagon,2013-04-26T16:00Z,"Saying just ""thank you"" (meaning all of you, guys) is too little. Keep on the excellent work, the fight, be free. We owe too much to you, and I personally owe too much to anyone who is contributing to this great worldwide effort of sharing and giving for free to lots of us. Thank you all very very very much.

A citizen and fellow from a Country in so many problems, Greece. I salute you."
[T],stevekasian,2013-04-28T12:16Z,"Wow. Now that I've seen what complete douchebags each of TPB founders are (save for Sunde) by watching this interesting movie, I will never bother to read another single word they have to type about anything.

Thanks Simon Kolse! Great film!"
