You are and will always be my heroes. You've gone through so much shit from the outside copyrighted world, it's amazing you still stand tall. I can't express how grateful we, leechers and seeders are, for the work you three have done.
FOREVER PIRATEBAY

-----

Ni tre är och förblir mina hjältar! Ni har ju fan fått genomlida ett rent helvete, bara för att ni har stått pall när Hollywood har försökt kväva er med falsk fakta. Jag vet inte hur jag ska uttrycka min tacksamhet, eller hur tacksamma varenda användare är här på the Pirate Bay, leechers som seeders, för att ni har gjort detta.
Tack så mycket.

----------

Sincere thanks to the home team, the filmmakers, the uploader, and all involved - including all seeders and leechers. Thank you, TPB, for holding the line against all odds. 

It's inspiring to see people standing up for what's right and righteous, despite an ongoing personal toll, an egregiously ignorant public, and a wealthy class engaged in a perpetual war with the people of the world.

Thank you from the bottom of my heart. Endless respect and eternal solidarity.

Will seed until i'm freakin' dead."
,JamsBand,2013-02-09T03:24Z,"much self gratification disguised as appreciation going on in the comment section here and the other 2 highly seeded torrents for this movie... and so I will join in as well. 
After all these years its still the top visited site on mine and all of us here as to computer use of the internet. About time a movie was made about it.. and a good one at that.
Long live TPB

You are appreciated even if the ungrateful shit-talking little bitches that could never have the courage to open their mouth on the street make it seem otherwise. Just remember that TPB will always remain kings and they will always remain cowards.

As for the cowards, shut your mouths, have some respect, show some recognition for what's been done, and show just a small amount of decency for once in you pitiful meaningless lives. "

Download Official VLC Player here:

If you still have problems (which I doubt you will)  Then you can also download k-lite codex package to install Every Codec, so that you can be sure to play everything in the world on your computer.

,teh_firestart3r,2013-02-11T20:27Z,"Hello guys! 

Can anybody ""hardcode"" english subtitles in the movie without having to use the .srt file? 

Thanks!"
,rewar001,2013-02-11T20:47Z,Audio would not play in bsplayer/wmp it's using the wrong codec? Downloaded VLC only to find out it's not english LOfuckingL...hey but the audio works now :P. Codec is mpga which seems popular enough I'm just wondering why it wont work. Anyway disregard my last post. Nice file please seed!

,MaGicbush,2013-02-12T16:11Z,"I wanted to watch this, but I will have to pass as it's not in English. If a copy with English voice-overs or an English version is released I will watch it then. Thanks though(reading subtitles throughout a whole movie instead of watching it seems pointless to me)!"
