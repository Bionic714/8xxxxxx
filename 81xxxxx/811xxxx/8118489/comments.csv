,draastik,2013-03-01T01:30Z,"I don't know what it is, but the Background audio sounds amazing. The Characters audio is mute. I cannot hear one person speak and I don't know what it is.."
,dauntless10101,2013-04-01T02:26Z,"You are probably trying to output to 5.1 but you only have 2.0 speakers.  You are hearing simply the left and right channel.  Typically the voices always come out of the center channel, which is why you don't hear them lol.  Switch your media player to playback to stereo."
,arslanistic,2013-04-07T17:03Z,should i get this one or the 14 GB one?

,Archon12,2013-04-28T06:08Z,"mike953100, you have my sincere appreciation. Just watched the first episode and the quality is flawless--both audio and video. I'm also a fan of the mp4 format over mkv, since I don't have to convert with mkv2vob in order to play it on my ps3. Now I just need to find a way to merge or hard-code the Dothraki subs to the mp4...anybody have any tips on that?"
