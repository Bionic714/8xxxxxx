NOTE: I suggest downloading VLC Media Player to watch this release.  You can download it here:

A few important and simple keyboard shortcuts for VLC are:

Double click: Fullscreen
Spacebar: Play/Pause
V key: Enable/Disable/Change Subtitles.
G/H key: Subtitle Delay (-50ms/+50ms per tap)
J/K key: Audio Delay (-50ms/+50ms per tap

NOTE: Subtitles are on by default for each Episode.  Episodes 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 all have DOTHRAKI, and therefore Subtitles for Dothraki are on by default.  If you would like Subtitles for EVERYTHING (including both English and Dothraki), simply tap the V key once.  In Episodes 1, 4, and 5, there is no DOTHRAKI, and therefore Subtitles for EVERYTHING are on by default.  If you would like no Subtitles in these three Episodes, simply tap the V key once.

NOTE: Two samples are included for your viewing pleasure.

NOTE: I do not have constant Internet access, so this upload may be SLOW, and it may take a few days.  Please be patient!
