Freddie Mercury was one of the most charismatic, compex and fascinating characters in British rock music. The story of Queen is a well known one but this new film focuses on Freddie Mercury and the solo projects he worked on outside of Queen. Using extensive archive footage of interviews with Freddie Mercury, concerts, video shoots and personal material, much of it previosly unseen, alongwith newinterviews with friends and colleagues, a portrait emerges of a man who was very different to his falmboyant onstage public persona. Freddie Mercury touched the lives of millions through his career both with Queen and as a solo performer and this new programme will delight and inform his legions of fans.
