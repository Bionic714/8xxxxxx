,haunterd,2013-02-09T02:14Z,Finally its out. 
,extracube,2013-02-09T02:56Z,"@asusions

sure.  some people, like me, prefer to get their soft or vids by torrent even when it's on free sites."
,kanakana,2013-02-09T05:02Z,"like phase700b wrote, it's already on here, in multiple resolutions, uploaded by the guy who actually MADE the film."
,NzKiwi,2013-02-09T07:45Z,"@kanakana - But the subs aren't hardcoded like the youtube vids, and are not in MP4.  The MKV versions are not Xbox friendly."
,wild_dragon,2013-02-09T07:53Z,"If this is the Original uploads, with ENGLISH SUBS, will seed, looking for the easy way for subs hard copied into the film, would love to see the documentery of how they are fighting and winning the sharing war. this site is absolutely amazing! will continue to seed after confirmation of this download that it has hard copied subs, avi format, and watchable quality"

,kanakana,2013-02-09T09:11Z,"@NzKiwi Well I guess you're right. This is probably important to people who absolutely need hardcoded subs and have xboxes and dont want to take a few extra minutes out of their lives to convert a file in handbrake or something.

The beauty of the internet is choice."
