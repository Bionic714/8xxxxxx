Synopsis
Abducted by some less than savoury characters, Daniel Jackson and Vala Mal Doran are caught up in the investigation of a strange object in space. What does it do, who created it and why does it seem so familiar?

As they discover more about the object, Daniel and Vala realise that theyΓÇÖre taking on an enormously technologically advanced threat bent on rewriting the very foundations of the universe. Can they stop the disaster thatΓÇÖs about to occur, or is life as they know it about to change forever?
