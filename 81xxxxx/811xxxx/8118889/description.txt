In the Heart of the Sea brings to new life the incredible story of the wreck of the whaleship EssexΓÇöan event as mythic in its own century as the Titanic disaster in ours, and the inspiration for the climax of Moby-Dick. In a harrowing page-turner, Nathaniel Philbrick restores this epic story to its rightful place in American history.
