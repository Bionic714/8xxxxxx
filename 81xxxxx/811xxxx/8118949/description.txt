Barbaric Sport: A Global Plague
by Marc Perelman

Globalized sport as savage spectacle and ΓÇÿopium of the peopleΓÇÖ


Marc Perelman pulls no punches in this succinct and searing broadside, assailing the ΓÇÿrecent form of barbarismΓÇÖ that is the global sporting event. Forget the Olympics and consider, under PerelmanΓÇÖs guidance, the ledger of inequities maintained by such supposedly harmless games.

They have provided a smokescreen for the forcible removal of ΓÇÿundesirablesΓÇÖ; aided governments in the pursuit of racist agendas; affirmed the hypocrisy of drug-testing in an industry where doping is more an imperative than an aberration; and developed the pornographic hybrid that Perelman dubs ΓÇÿspornΓÇÖ, a further twist in our corrupt obsession with the body.

Drawing examples from the modern history of the international sporting event, Perelman argues that todayΓÇÖs colosseums, upheld as examples of ΓÇÿhealthΓÇÖ, have become the steamroller for a decadent age fixated on competition, fame and elitism.
