,phase700b,2013-02-08T19:49Z,Thanks for this. My DVD of this one is non anamorphic and looks pretty bad. Looking forward to this!
,TheLathe,2013-02-09T06:43Z,"YES!  Same here; I remember the original DVD not being all that hot and also LONG OOP!

Another BITCH'N choice mate!  Damn good film, and it's nice to see Sean Young again when she actually was hotttt (although, not QUITE as hot as in 'BLADERUNNER'  : )

Thanks again!!!"
