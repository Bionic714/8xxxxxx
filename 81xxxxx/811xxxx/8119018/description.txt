Description:

The CAFR Swindle - The Biggest Game In Town:
There is massive fraud on the public by the institutions we thought we could trust.  Virtually every public entity is involved in hoarding and diverting public resources from public service to insider crony benefit and misuse.  Learn what the CAFR is (actual accounting practices) as compared to the more common erroneous 'Budget' used by Governemnts to falsely portray spending capital, assets, liabilities and resources.  Budgets mean little else than expectations for spending while the CAFR is the TRUE worth and/or ownership of a corporation or government.
