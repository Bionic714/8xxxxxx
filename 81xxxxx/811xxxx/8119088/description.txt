 For Vishnu (Prabhudheva), widely regarded      
 as India's best dancer, dance is more than a   
 passion - it's the reason he lives! So when    
 he finds himself thrown out from the swish     
 dance academy he himself set up, by his        
 manipulative business partner, it feels like   
 the oxygen has been sucked out from the        
 air he breathes. Heart-broken, Vishnu decides  
 to give up dance and leave Mumbai forever.     
 However the night before his departure he      
 witnesses a most amazing sight - a group       
 of dancers preparing for the upcoming Ganpati  
 Dance Battle - an annual festival that pits    
 Mumbai's best dance groups against each other.
