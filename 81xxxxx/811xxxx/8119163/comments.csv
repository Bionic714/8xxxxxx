,DoriSai,2013-03-26T00:07Z,"Question, iirc the regular Ultimate Edition download does NOT many of the exclusive and promotional items such as the Guildmaster's Belt, The Lucky Stone, the collector's edition stuff, pre-order stuff...  Does this download include all of those as well?  Or will I have to get them elsewhere?"

Ill seed when im done downloading but it isnt my connection thats the problem. I momentarily stopped the torrent and tried downloading from depositfiles and had 140 kb/s the whole time till that download was done and it was a 400 mb file. so whats with this torrent?"
,snake42069,2013-03-29T13:14Z,"Nvm. i just noticed that i was only downloading the first install file. Once i enabled the other 2, speeds picked up.
