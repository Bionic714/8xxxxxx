About the Game:

Dragon Age: Origins is a third-person single-player role-playing video game developed by BioWare's Edmonton studio and published by Electronic Arts.
The game is set in Ferelden, one of several countries that makes up the mythical continent of Thedas. 
Every few hundred years, the darkspawn swarm the surface world in a movement known as a Blight. 
Beginning with the first Blight, Thedas relied on the legendary order of warriors known as the Grey Wardens to drive the darkspawn back. 
You are a Grey Warden, one of the last of this legendary order of guardians. 
With the return of mankind's ancient foe and the kingdom engulfed in civil war, you have been chosen by fate to unite the shattered lands and slay the archdemon once and for all. 
Explore a stunning world, make complex moral choices, and engage in bone-crushing combat against massive and terrifying creatures.
Dragon Age: Origins - Awakening Expansion Pack
The story of the Grey Wardens continues as you are named their commander. Fight new enemies, learn new skills and spells, and explore an all-new area of the world, Amaranthine....
