Thank You!

I for one really..truly appreciate films like this one. 

They're incredibly difficult to find as torrents and even more so at the 2+ gig file size.

There are several more..not that I'm requesting or anything..just making the point..and while on the subject..this is the REALITY of the BOOK BURNERS who destroyed 'demonoid'. For again..the REALITY was not 'legality'..but rather..'The Destruction Of A LIBRARY of RARE and even IMPOSSIBLE to obtain films"".

Anyway..here's hoping someone will add to the historical preservation at 2G:

""The Missouri Breaks""

""Rolling Thunder""

""Electra Glide In Blue""

And many more.

But thanks..seriously..for this one."

,nairobi19,2013-03-17T20:19Z,I have this on DVD ... but it's such a great film I'll download it anyway and probably never watch it.
