DESCRIPTION

    Dear Internets! 							      
                                                                            
  My name is Simon and I am the director/producer of the film TPB AFK:      
  The Pirate Bay Away From Keyboard. After 5 years of hard work, it's a     
  great pleasure to finally upload a torrent about this great website       
  onto the site itself. In a way, I guess TPB AFK has finally come home.    
  This is not just a film about the founders of TPB, but also a film        
  about all of you who use the site. Please convert this film into all      
  possible formats and share it as much as you can!          		      

                                                                            
                                                                            
  Thank you!
