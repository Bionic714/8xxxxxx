So this story would be like reading a N Korean story about a US citizen escaping to the freedom in N Korea, wouldn't it? Or a jew escaping a nazicamp?"

I recommend watching the Vice documentaries on North Korea and by contrast also watch the report from ""Russia Today"". Admittedly, not everything is fine and dandy in NK but what country is?

What is apparent however is how much the ""choosen people"" of the west/occident hate NK and that really shines through in the Vice documentaries."

,RaXha,2013-04-05T22:16Z,"kjhgviyvoiyoi - This book is about the only known person who was born in a north korean workers camp who has escaped and survived to tell the tale. 

Like you say it could be compared to a book written by a jew who has survived a nazi concentration camp during WWII."
