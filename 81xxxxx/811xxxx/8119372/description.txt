Originally, Artifacts was set to be a 13-issue crossover series involving all the popular Top Cow characters in a universe-changing event. After the arc's conclusion, the series continued as an ongoing title with Ron Marz and Stjepan Sejic as the creative team, fresh off their long run on Witchblade.
