Introducing Transistor Revolution for Kontakt Player!

Is it possible to accurately recreate the sound of a vintage analogue drum machine in a software plugin? nearly 2 years ago we started out on a journey to find out...

After gravitating towards the most influential drum machines ever created (namely the TR-808 and TR-909) we soon discovered the extreme depth of focus needed to faithfully capture the tone, immediacy and groove of the original instruments.

2 years on, after a lot of research and development (and 22,000 samples later) we arrived at what we believe to be the most accurate emulation of these classic drum machines ever created... Transistor Revolution, our virtual analogue drum machine inspired by the classic TR-808 and TR-909 electronic drum machines of the 1980ΓÇÖs.

Why 22,000 samples you might ask? To give an example of the detail involved in the sampling of each instrument, the Revolution 909 Bass Drum alone uses 9318 unique sounds to faithfully recreate the 909 Bass Drum sound. Each of the 4 knobs on the Revolution 909 Bass Drum control panel scans smoothly through each and every sample in real-time... Additionally to emulate the subtle differences in sound inherent of analogue equipment we recorded 7 variations of each drum sound which cycle randomly each time a key on the keyboard is played.
