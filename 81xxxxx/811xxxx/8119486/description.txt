Getting Yourself Ready for the Rapture:
How to prepare yourself for the Lord's Return. What is needed, and what will happen.  Through visions, prophecies, visitations and signs, Jesus has given many warnings to the world that there was little time left. But few listen and get ready.

Many churches are not getting their congregations ready for the rapture. The topics of the rapture, End Times and the tribulation, were seldom covered in their sermons. And many of the church members knew very little about the subject.  It is not the easy to be raptured. Like Queen Esther preparation, it took serious time and dedication to prepare her for the wedding.

The Great Tribulation will be a time of persecution. As Jesus said, Then you will be handed over to be persecuted and put to death. And you will be hated by all nations because of Me.  Those people not Raptured will unfortunately go through the great tribulation!  The Great Tribulation will be a time of persecution. As Jesus said, Then you will be handed over to be persecuted and put to death. And you will be hated by all nations because of Me.  It will be a time of falling away. As Jesus said, Because of the increase in wickedness the love of most, will grow cold.

GIANT HUMAN SKELETONS - Hidden Truths:
There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.
- Genesis 6:4

Many mysteries of the Earth's past have been intentionally hidden from public view.  Among them some are listed as follows:
The Days of Noah
Giants in Scripture
Book of Enoch ΓÇô new translation
Book of Enoch
Epic of Gilgamesh
Ancient & Lost Civilizations
Gilgamesh Tomb Found!
Gog
Floods Stories from Around the World
The Book of Giants
Ancient Egyptian Treasures in Grand Canyon
The Karankawa
Lost City of the Grand Canyon

If it weren't for the Holy Bible, most of these which have surfaced over time would be completely discounted.  Now with modern technologies, any findings or able to be documented before they are covered up and hidden from view.  This video provides evidences for some.  So as in "the days of Noah" shall return, we need to prepare for what the future brings.

Many Shall Be Offended - Benjamin Baruch - OmegaMan Radio:
November 6th, 2012...
And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?
And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you.
For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.
And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.
For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.
All these are the beginning of sorrows.
Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.
And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another.
And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.
And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.
But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved. Matthew.24:3-13

11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove (expose) them.
