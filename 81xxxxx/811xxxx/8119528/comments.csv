,Naralli15,2013-05-18T00:56Z,"Great quality, thanks so much! I played this with VLC and had no issues. I did notice that there was some residual pixels when scenes would go from light to dark. It happened maybe two or three times but I thought I'd just mention it. Also there are two audio files; the second one is much better than the first.

A: 10

,johnj1969,2013-05-21T02:02Z,"@Naralli15 How do you know its not your PJ or TV settings that are showing pixels? There are settings to diminish pixelated screens you know...Also the 1st audio setting is a 2ch stereo ST & the 2nd is multi-ch 5.1 audio,yeah... Please dont even think about saying anything bad on dhjudasx uploads. They are probably allround best on here if you dont mind average 2gb DL."
