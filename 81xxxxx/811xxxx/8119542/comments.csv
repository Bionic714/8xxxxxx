,atomicICE,2013-03-16T17:47Z,"dhjudasx, I downloaded all 4 of your POTC downloads and the quality is stunning. The download was fast, and everything works perfectly except I had a problem with echo. I downloaded it to my mac, but when I play it, it's almost like there are two files put together. When I fast-forward, the sound splits and the echo gets more audible. Is there any reason why this is happening? How can I fix it? Thanks!"

You are likely using Quicktime... quicktime is apparently notorious for horrible audio track support..

I've been told some elaborate means for a solution.. but the most effective way to solve it is use a player that understands dual audio track solutions.

VLC for Mac or any other more common universal player that doesn't break things.

Frankly I've never had good luck with apples quicktime... Unless there is a way to manually enforce only a single audio track that i'm unaware of."
