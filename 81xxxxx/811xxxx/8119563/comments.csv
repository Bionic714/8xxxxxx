,Th3Ch1mp,2013-03-25T07:12Z,"Most of the movies I pull from you playback with an echo in the audio, do you know what I have to do to fix that? I'm using a Mac, if that matters. And I'm not really techno savvi so in plain English would be awesome :)
Thanks again mate, good stuff.."
,Th3Ch1mp,2013-03-25T07:15Z,"Got it - playback using VLC corrects it. Should have read your advice first...
Cheers bro"
[V],dhjudasx,2013-03-27T16:53Z,"sorry Th3Ch1mp i hadn't seen your comment until just now...

glad you got it sorted out.

quicktime is pretty terrible .. it doesn't seem to understand that mp4's can have more than one audio track and APPEARS to try to play BOTH of them at the same time which obviously sounds terrible.

I generally recommend that ANYONE that experiences any kind of video or audio issues... to attempt to use another player.... it's surprising how many will just not do the job right."
