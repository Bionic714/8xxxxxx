Album Info

Get Rich or Die Tryin' is the debut studio album of American rapper 50 Cent, released February 6, 2003, on Aftermath Entertainment under a joint venture with Shady Records and distribution by Interscope Records. Its initially planned release was pushed seven days ahead due to heavy bootlegging and Internet leakage. The album featured production from Dr. Dre and Eminem, among others and featured guest appearances from Eminem and then-newcomers Young Buck, Lloyd Banks and Tony Yayo.

The album debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart, selling 872,000 copies in its first week. It spawned four singles, including the number 1-hits "In da Club" and "21 Questions", and the international single "P.I.M.P.". By December 2003, Get Rich or Die Tryin' had sold six million copies in the United States and was certified sextuple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. As of January 2011, it has sold eight million copies in the US, making it the fourth best-selling hip hop album in the US. Upon its release, the album received positive reviews from most music critics and was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rap Album, losing to OutKast's Speakerboxxx/The Love Below at the 46th Grammy Awards.
