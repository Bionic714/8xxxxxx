Compliant with Xbox360/PS3/iPads/Mobile Devices/etc. devices that require the primary Audio stream to be AAC Stereo (many do not accept/work with AAC 5.1 format). Audio Stream 2 available to those that also wish to experience great 5.1 sound that goes right alongside great picture quality.

For those experiencing LOW VOLUME issues, try to playback the 2nd Audio stream in stereo mode, this should improve audio quality and increase the volume substantially.

If you wish to experience 5.1 audio on the original PS3 or Newer PS3, Just select the audio options and ensure the 5.1 stream/track is selected.

PC Users will have to use something like VLC that allows you to choose the 2nd Audio stream/track, Depending on your configuration, vlc should automatically enable 5.1 playback after the track change, but double check by selecting AUDIO ~ Audio Device ~ 5.1

Judas's Note:

Just for clarification, I've seen SEVERAL torrents and uploads for this movie that claim to be the "director's Cut" version only for it to be the theatrical version.

What many do not realize is that the theatrical version is approximately a full minute longer... "well that's weird... why would a DC be shorter than the theatrical, that would mean there is significantly LESS in the film...."

Well, there are LESS scenes in which drag out for a long period of time... Instead additional scenes are added in place of those. It's arguable which version is preferred, some prefer one over the other... some say that both are equally as great... some would have just preferred it if they made the DC cut without REMOVING any of the scenes and just added in making the movie about 10 minutes longer.

In either case.... this is indeed IN FACT the DC cut and NOT the theatrical. Unlike many of the Claimed to be DC cut torrents that are in fact the theatrical.
