,zakimar5,2013-03-06T01:06Z,"It took me 50 minutes for the entire file, with 7 seeders and 720 leechers!

Thanks."
,zakimar5,2013-03-06T01:26Z,"Set Episode 10 on low priority, until there are a lot more seeders, and you are at 98% or so.

The problem is that some of the seeders are cutting out as soon as they are done - a-holes!

Now there are 4 seeders and 668 leechers."
