The Perc Meets The Hidden Gentleman - Seven Years on the peak (1990)

Often classified as "Krautrock" this is really something else.

Their music is somehow psychedelic but even reminds of Bauhaus, Joy Division or in some moments of Toy Dolls............

Whatsoever it is a great piece of good music.
