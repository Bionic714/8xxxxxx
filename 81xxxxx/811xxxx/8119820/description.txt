Nikki, Jack and Leo struggle to identify the human remains with only sections
of skeleton found and basic forensic facilities, but believe Dan Lambert must
have been captured by the Taliban, executed and buried.

Whilst Leo grows closer to charity worker Fawzia, Nikki and Jack find and
assemble the skull fragments and make an unnerving discovery that challenges
their theory of what happened to Dan Lambert.

However, when an imprisoned Taliban fighter is found dead in the compound,
the team suspect he was murdered, and suspicions grow about Sean Nugent and
his men's treatment of prisoners. No longer able to trust anyone, the
increasingly isolated team doggedly piece together the circumstances
surrounding Dan Lambert's disappearance, but the shocking truth triggers a
chain of events which leaves everyone's lives in danger.
