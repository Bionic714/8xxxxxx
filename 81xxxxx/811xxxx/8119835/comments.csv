,BlasphemousMusic,2013-02-09T01:40Z,I have terrible upload (not to mention DL speed) so I would highly encourage people to see for as long as possible to ensure everyone can get it.  thx to crimson for the release and enjoy!
,mikeike65,2013-02-09T03:40Z,It dont even air until 02/09/2013. Just because you originate a torrtent in chingland does not make it cool. Everyone knows UTC+ times. You are a FAKE! 
,BlasphemousMusic,2013-02-09T04:06Z,"sigh...here I was actually tryin to be cool and share with others what I got from my private site...

This episode isn't fake, its the episode that was shown on thursday.  Ask the leechers when they watch it if its real or not!

And chingland, really?  I didn't know living close to sturgis south dakota was chingland."
,BlasphemousMusic,2013-02-09T04:20Z,"these episodes were labeled wrong from crimson, not me.  This is the most current episode, thursdsay Jackyl night.  if you'd actually take the time and look instead of calling people out, you'd see the is the next in order and I left the title as is for people to know which one it is.  

And please seed! Im seeing people take it and run."
