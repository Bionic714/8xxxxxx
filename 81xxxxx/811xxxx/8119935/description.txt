Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site :: On the Friday, February 8 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex covers a move by California Democrats to force residents in the state to submit to government confiscation of their semi-automatic firearms. He also runs down what the confirmation of John Brennan as CIA boss means for the drone war and the seemingly endless expansion of the police state. Alex talks about the possibility of the Bilderberg confab being held once again in America, and the cop killer on the loose in California.
