5-0 Lyrics:
I was just eleven buying music off of Amadou/
41 shots for a wallet that was Amadou/
And since no Judge sent them to hell/
That's prolly the same reason 50 hit Sean Bell/
I ain't talking Curtis yo I'm talking bout the P.D./
(Yup) The same people that's supposed to protect me/
But instead they filling people with
led/
If you a good cop what goes thru your head/
Every time you see the news and somebody got shot/
Or somebody got abused by a crooked cop/
I don't know if we should just put them in a cell/
Or leave them how the Russians left Denzel/
All I know we cant afford a Kelly Thomas/
Justice shouldn't b a dream it should b a promise/
And forget about the Bad Cops doing bids/
Do you really want the good being feared by the kids?/

Should the kids get frightened/
Every time they hear a siren/
Lights flashing like lighting/
Listening to Spike do the right thing/
(Repeat)

Is it Serve and Protect or grab them by the neck?/
I ain't saying fuck them but I will not neglect/
All the wrong that's making good cops look bad/
The calls that ended with a mom all sad/
Is it fair how they left Graham dead in is home?/
Should we use a taser till a mouth gets foam?/
If you was killing a clones then I prolly wouldn't care/
But I'm sure Lt Loggins kids don't got a spare/
What they doing to the people's plain wrong/
And in 30 vs One Sgt Thomas wasn't wrong/
Doesnt every badge come with Pride and Glory/
Is everything inside the reports just a story?/
I ain't tryna remake Sound of the Police/
It sucks cuz I know they ain't all apart of the beast/
But the body count is mounting and the lies is too/
So now that I spoke up Police it's on you/

Should the kids get frightened/
Every time they hear a siren/
Lights flashing like lighting/
Listening to Spike do the right thing/
(Repeat)
