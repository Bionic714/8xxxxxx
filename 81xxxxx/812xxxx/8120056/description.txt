"Adventures in Babysitting"

In order to keep her from losing her deal with 
the record label, Reba agrees to collaborate 
with superstar bad girl singer Shauna, who 
demands to move into Reba's home for awhile in 
order to get to know her better. But her bad 
habits start to rub off on the kids when she 
asks Cash to buy her some alcohol and 
encourages June to stop being so dependable. 
Meanwhile, Lillie Mae begins to think that 
Reba doesn't miss her when she moves into 
Kim's house for a few days after agreeing to 
housesit for her.
