,thejester39,2013-02-09T03:54Z,"For the record my upload speed is not the best, so at first it may take a bit to download. But as long as you guys are being cool about it, and helping to seed, at least at first, download speeds will increase. So I ask you to kindly seed once you've download. Even if just for a day or two. Thanks!"
,Vanellyna,2013-02-09T13:43Z,Thanx! ...COOL!
,PapaPitts,2013-02-09T18:42Z,is there anyone seeding this still because I don't see a single person at 100% on my peers....
,Dzony_B,2013-02-09T20:39Z,I'l try to download soon and i'l seed for 2-3 days...  Join me fellow pirates and lets do this :D  (hope it works.)
,Savhos,2013-02-10T21:21Z,Seeders finally! 
,iizftdubs,2013-02-11T02:36Z,Someone Seed!!!
,iizftdubs,2013-02-11T02:39Z,Ill seed if others will seed.
,iizftdubs,2013-02-11T02:55Z,Can someone please seed? Because this is looking like a dead torrent.
,MrMCDemo,2013-02-11T03:10Z,well im at 10.51/11.51 if i get this last gig in from the single seeder from like an hour ago I'd seed for you guys
,joshuaj713,2013-02-11T03:33Z,I have gotten 91% downloaded and now it looks as though I will never get the last 9%.
,nhki,2013-02-11T03:42Z,"only 9% more, someone seed pls..."
,MrMCDemo,2013-02-11T05:55Z,I will be seeding soon (30mins) if my current speed keeps up
,thejester39,2013-02-11T06:55Z,"I'm trying my best to seed, but this torrent got hit pretty hard. Unfortunately I cant find a way to get utorrent to use my full upload speed potential either. But I'm trying to seed it. If it ends up dying, I'll try to reupload it again. Sorry guys."
,MrMCDemo,2013-02-11T08:20Z,im .31gb away from seeding so i'll give you a hand if it ever decides to start DLing from the 1/3 seeds again
,MrMCDemo,2013-02-11T08:57Z,*sigh* 200mb shall take me 2 days now -_- dling at .7kib/s when i can dl at 3mb/s usually... i could probably upload for a 1.3 ratio before finishing my DL at this rate XD
,thejester39,2013-02-11T09:22Z,"Anyone have any suggestions? I'm more than willing to let someone else upload it. I just have to figure out how to get it to them. My upload won't go as fast as it should, and I've tried just about everything. If anyone has any suggestions, let me know. I'd love for everyone to be able to enjoy it."
,MrMCDemo,2013-02-11T09:39Z,"ehh jus needs some time, its a new upload so from a new source so your not going to get the usual seeder potential of say a person with 20+ uploads but once the ball gets rolling it'll roll like all other torrents"
,MrMCDemo,2013-02-11T09:46Z,"oh and a suggestion you may wish to do if you already have not, port forwarding utorrents outbound port if you have one"
,joshuaj713,2013-02-11T09:54Z,We got seeders!
,MrMCDemo,2013-02-11T09:57Z,well i finally acquired it fully so i'll seed for at least a few ratios
,MrMCDemo,2013-02-11T11:19Z,"see jester from 1 seeder to 171, told you the ball would start rolling XD"
,thejester39,2013-02-11T12:06Z,"Hey great, thanks guys!! It definitely did get rolling. I wonder if enough people gave up on it, that it was able to finally balance out. Enjoy everyone. I'm playing right now. So addicting! lol"
,krispycandyflipper,2013-02-11T16:23Z,Hey. TY! I had to sign in to give kudos. My Skyrim is so heavily modded. I have been trying work arounds to update my version as it was one of the first Skyrim torrents I downloaded. It worked perfect with all of my mods over 250 of them. Just could never do the DLC's or use any of the good updates offered. Even though I could get all steam stuff with it just could never do updates or dlc's. Thanks for a fresh UPDATED START! Kudo's ;D 
,babygotback,2013-02-11T21:08Z,"130 seeders and 0 comments if this version works... So, anyone who downloaded 100% can confirm its fine?"
,Dzony_B,2013-02-11T21:54Z,Still seeding... i hope you guys are downloading and seedeng too.
,xOaKx,2013-02-11T21:58Z,This torrent have all previously updates ( 1 to 11)?
,axcv12,2013-02-12T01:59Z,i install it throught the razor installer and it says simpack can't create file... atimgpud.dll is the file... can someone help?
,nhki,2013-02-12T02:47Z,"it worked well, no virus..."
,RandyPeterson,2013-02-12T07:35Z,Will this work for Mac?  I'm not overly educated in this realm of things.
,thejester39,2013-02-12T13:50Z,"Glad its useful for you krispy! You reason, is the EXACT I reason I put this together. I am a mod freak. So it's nice to start from scratch if need be. Thanks for the kudos!

Thanks for seeding Dzony! I am still seeding as well.

xOakX It includes a folder with Update 11. Which is all updates from 1 to 11. So yes it does. Enjoy!

axcv12 I'm not sure what the problem would be there. Does it cancel installation, or is that file just missing? Because if you Google it, you may be able to find it somewhere. Give me a bit more info, so I can try to help you.
"
,thejester39,2013-02-12T13:51Z,"Randy Peterson, I'm afraid I can't answer that question for you. I am quite unfamiliar with Macs. Sorry. Perhaps someone with knowledge could answer it."
,RandyPeterson,2013-02-12T17:52Z,"The short answer to my above question is:

NO, apparently Bethesda did not release a Mac version of Skyrim... even on their official site.  Looks like I'll have to knock the dust off the PC.

Thanks for the download though, I'll let ya know how it goes on the PC side."
,RandyPeterson,2013-02-12T18:03Z,"NOTE:  Sorry to keep commenting back to back, but I've done a little research and you can apparently download a ported version of Skyrim, or run it with a Windows partisan.

All of that jazz is too much work for me, so I'm still DLing to my PC... Bethesda not releasing officially for Mac is among the dumbest shit I've ever heard.  However, ES: Online will be released for Mac; so there's that to look forward to.

Thanks again"
,thejester39,2013-02-12T19:28Z,"Sorry to hear they didnt make it for the Mac. I'd imagine it wouldnt even be worth playing the port version though. Cant be the same. I love this game. I have been playing non-stop. I've also been downloading a lot of mods. I came across this ""mod"" called HiAlgo and its amazing. It allows me to run my game on pretty high settings with pretty much no lag. I was super impressed. So now I'm going mod crazy! lol Anyway, enjoy!"
,thejester39,2013-02-12T23:28Z,I'm guessing everything is going well for everyone. Because typically only the people with a problem leave a comment. Hope everyone is enjoying!
,RandyPeterson,2013-02-13T06:40Z,"excellent, I'm finishing the Dragonborn questline along with a few others on Xbox right now... then moving onto the PC platform to mod a little myself, so keep us posted please Jester"
,ddrocking,2013-02-14T00:02Z,"Hi, I just got done installing everything included and I had an existing skyrim install. I installed the one I downloaded and had a save game already ready, and when I went to the spot where the cave is for dawnguard, there is nothing there (as if there is no DLC). I uninstalled the old copy and tried again and still nothing. I even tried making a new character and there was still no cave. I also tried playing dragonborn and wasn't able to figure out how to start playing dragonborn. I doubt hearthfire works. I followed the instructions exactly, and nothing. Thanks for any help :P"
,RandyPeterson,2013-02-14T04:19Z,"Did you get the quest to start Dawnguard?  I know on console you have to hear a guard talking about it, or visit the Vigil of Stendar's burnt down HQ to get the cave to spawn.  Also to access Soltheim you'll need to battle two Cultist somewhere randomly in the world and grab a note off one of them, this enables the Dragonborn questline to initiate."

Why the fuck did you zip it all into one file :("
,ddrocking,2013-02-15T05:53Z,I did not get any quest to start dawnguard. I've talked to many guards in different holds and no one says anything about the vampires. I'm currently level 29. I went to the Beacon of Stendarr and they had nothing to say neither.

,thejester39,2013-02-17T06:33Z,"FOR ALL THOSE NOT HAVING THE DLC SHOW UP IN GAME, PLEASE FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN BY KONA_GUY. YOU MUST DO THIS OR THE FILES WILL NOT SHOW UP. THEY MUST BE ACTIVATED VIA LAUNCHER OR A MOD MANAGER. Thank you Kona_Guy for your help.

harbinger92 You're welcome! I did so for one, because I am not apt at downloading torrents. So it just seemed to make it easier for me. But what is wrong with doing so? Its not that long of a wait for WinRAR to unzip it. And you can pick out certain files, if you only need select ones. Is there some other issue I am not aware of? Hope you enjoy it regardless!

dan_1234567skyrim911  I can assure you this 100% virus free. Quite like myself! lol

dankman3000  I am not sure what the issue could be. Do you have any mods installed? Perhaps one is causing an issue. I havent had any reports of your issue, so it must be an isolated one. Process of elimination I always found to be the best way to resolve conflicts. Good luck!

Hope you're all enjoying this!! If I can make a recommendation to anyone who uses mods. If you have Hearthfire, download a mod called Tundra Defense. Also download a mod called Home Construction and Decoration. Top it off with a mod called Lakeview Flats. Not if you buy Lakeview Manor, you can use Tundra and HCD to build your very own city, while your estate sits at the top of the hill. I have been doing this and the fun is unending. Check them out!! Have fun guys!"

I have a question though.. I have the Razor1911's base installer so I don't really need to download the base installer from this torrent do i ? My internet is very slow so 5.5 GB takes days to download... hence I wld appreciate your feedback ASAP.

,thejester39,2013-02-18T08:32Z,"People, you have to make sure you activate the DLCs in the launcher. The instructions are on the first page of the comment section. Its really quite simple.

As for the one zip, sorry. I dont do uploads much and thats just how it turned out. This torrent was just intended for those who want to be caught up to date with all Skyrim stuff. There are plenty of torrents of the single files. Meaning torrents of just the DLCs, or the base game. Maybe I will reupload a different one with the files separate. Or someone else is more than welcome to do so, using this torrent.  "

,Ashenfall,2013-02-21T17:47Z,"@Kona_guy

I used 7zip, but it seems that, even though the installer crashed, it installed just fine. A little odd, honestly. Either way, the only issue I had after that was not having a good enough graphics card to play the game, on that computer.

But, now I'm on my other one, so all is well. The game runs perfectly, the DLC is working, and I think it's incredibly badass when my character just stares a dragon in the face while getting roared at.

All is right with the world."
,pyanni,2013-02-21T19:01Z,"I just registered to comment here, what nobody seems to be saying to help us who didn't get the dlc working, is that there are 2 fucking skyrimprefs.ini files, both with different settings and the one that needs changed is in mydocumentsmygamesskyrim. 
The one in the data folder where skyrim is installed(where most people would look) already has that line that needed added and doesn't seem to matter for this problem."
,ddrocking,2013-02-21T19:30Z,"@pyanni Thanks so much, this worked. When you start your launcher, select ""Data Files"" and select the mods you want. Remember to do what pyanni said and put the Skyrimprefs.ini from your Skyrim install folder (theres a folder inside called ""Skyrim"") and put it into ""Documents > My Games > Skyrim and then the Data Files option should begin to work."
,mandarp,2013-02-22T10:27Z,I think this update is better than downloading everything seperately. Don't make seperate files now jester. I have seen that HD texture pack seperately is 4.5 GB something and the other DLC's come to 6 GB so... your update is better.
,Kona_Guy,2013-02-22T18:33Z,Alittle advice from an old man..... Make a folder on your desktop and install to that folder. It makes it easier to work with.

It appears as a separate icon on my desktop that, when clicked on, does nothing. I was just wondering if this is the way it is supposed to be, or if I installed it incorrectly. I am currently working on the Horn of Jurgen Windcaller quest, and from what I've been told, the Dragonborn DLC does not come into play until after that quest.

,kmiree16,2013-03-08T15:14Z,"I installed everything and have the option to enable the DLCs. My problem is that when I click ""Play"" the game just opens up to a black screen like it's trying to load but nothing comes up. After about 20 seconds of nothing it just closes. Is anyone else having this problem?"

,ryson123,2013-03-08T22:32Z,"still cant figure it out, i mounted the skyrim.iso, and then im wondering where to go to install the game. What i have been doing is going to the folder titled setup with a steam icon, and then clicking install, but then it asks for a code, what do i do??? Or am i suppose to install it from a different folder???"

Once again srry for all these comments!"
,mcdubble,2013-03-09T02:25Z,well im downloading at 100kb/s. this is quite slow
,Instinction,2013-03-10T00:39Z,Ok so I've downloaded the whole thing and mounted using daemon lite. The problem I'm running into is that when I try to move the dlc's over to the virtual drive it says it needs some odd amount more gb's to copy it to the drive. Can somebody help me? I really want to play this. Thanks in advance.
,Instinction,2013-03-10T00:54Z,"Also when I install it gives me a ""Program might not have installed correctly"" message and options to say it did or to reinstall using recommended settings."
,thejester39,2013-03-11T02:51Z,"Ok guys, I've been gone for a bit, and there are just WAY too many questions for me to answer them all. All I can say, is that this works 100% if properly installed, and assuming your computer doesnt have limitations. (Please make sure your comp can handle the game in the first place) All answers are in the comments section if you dig a bit. If you have trouble running the game cause of your graphics card, I suggest NOT installing the HD Texture Pack. In fact, I dont use it anymore, and just downloaded HD Texture mods as I feel the game runs smoother that way now. All in all, its as simple as downloading this torrent, mounting in Daemon tools, installing, and playing. The DLC packs need to be Enabled to play. (Search Google for ""Skyrim Data Files greyed out"" if your Date Files section of the Skyrim launcher is greyed out for you) I have even had a chance to test SOME of the DLC and everything seems to be in order. I wish I could help everyone, but all computers are different, and I am not technician. I hope everyone is able to play and enjoy it. I've already put a lot of hours into it myself. (Mods have kept my interesting for sure) Thanks so much for downloading. Enjoy!!

( I noticed someone mentioned something about shadows. They can be altered via the Skyrim.ini and SkyrimPref.ini files in your My Documents folder. I suggest searching online. The shorter you set shadow distance, the better they look up close. While I have found a nice compromise for shadows, sadly, Bethesda really half-assed the shadows, and not too much can be done to improve them)"
,welp11,2013-03-11T04:17Z,"I wanted to say thanks again Jester, I've put in around 40hours so far and had zero problems. Even after installing around 30 mods and tweaking the hell out of my shadows/settings I have had no crashes whatsoever.

For people having problems just keep troubleshooting because everything works fine. Make sure to read the comments about the data tab being greyed out, uninstall steam and once you get it all going check out nexusmods."
,ryson123,2013-03-12T02:16Z,hey so im trying to run SKSE and when i do it says i need to update skyrim what should i do???

,Kaethi,2013-03-18T00:25Z,Please seed guys !
,cybertunz,2013-03-18T01:52Z,"thejester39,
hope you can clarify something regarding installation instructions... both .iso files (steps 2 and 3c) when mounted in Daemon tools and 'Explored' show crack folders - step 2 Skyrim.iso shows crack folder named ""Razor 911"" and step 3c Dragonborn.iso shows folder named ""Crack"".
Nothing in your installation instructions says anything about using these cracks, so the question is SHOULD THESE CRACKS BE APPLIED (i.e., copied/overwritten into installation directory) AFTER EACH OF THEIR CORRESPONDING INSTALLATION STEPS?
These seem like very important missing steps if overlooked, so please advise!
Thanks for the torrent..."
,quehouse2,2013-03-19T08:33Z,"Thanks thejester39, great uploads it works perfectly!
@cybertunz If you follow steps 1 through 5 exactly everything will install properly. Follow the instructions and you shouldn't have a problem. "
,quehouse2,2013-03-19T08:51Z,"Also don't forget to edit the skyrim ini file to add this ""bEnableFileSelection=1""under [LAUNCHER]"
,gupta5207,2013-03-19T16:35Z,i really need help i have downloaded it and exported the files then mounted them with the suggested rogram but i cant open or play skyrim at all it comes up with an error everytime i try to download it please help

,Breaksense,2013-03-19T21:36Z,"Why all archived, whyyyy?"
,thejester39,2013-03-22T04:10Z,"Hey folks. I appreciate the many thanks I've received!! Hope you all are enjoying this! 

To answer the question about the cracks, the reason why I dont mention them is because they arent needed UNLESS you dont want to install the Update 11. That folder contains the cracked file. Also, there are newer updates now than Update 11 which can be downloaded here on Pirate Bay. If you download that alongside this torrent, just follow the instructions on the new updates torrent. It contains the crack. Cracks are not needed for each DLC unless you dont plan on being up-to-date with the game.

Have fun!"
,thejester39,2013-03-23T08:24Z,"Hey Guys. Since so many people cried about it taking maybe 5 minutes to pull something from the zip folder, I figured I'd upload this torrent unzipped. Check it out here:

,tarzanscousin,2013-03-23T19:46Z,"Works great and easy to install, thanks a lot!. No problems patching it with update 12 either. I needed to add ""bEnableFileSelection=1"" to my config file under launcher but soon as I did that, the DLC fire up and all was good."
,d0vh,2013-03-24T05:40Z,"game worked fine, thank you!
i'm not sure if the DLCs and HD textures are working tho, is there a way to check it?"
,Billyfro,2013-03-28T07:06Z,"So I scrolled through comments hoping someone had the same issue as me, I saw similar, but not the same. Basically, heres what went down, i followed the instructions to a tee, everything is working cool. i finish up and open the launcher. it pulls up and scans my system for video setting, cool cool, and click play, it goes away and acts like its gonna load for a sec, but nope. after about a half hour of doing other things i reset the computer due to being slow. upon getting on again and trying to pull up the skyrim launcher it no longer goes to the menu at all, it just pretends to load for a sec and gives up. i didnt mean to type up the paragraph, but if anyone could help me out in any way it would be appreciated."
