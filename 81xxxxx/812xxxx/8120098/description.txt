The long awaited upload to Pirate Bay is finally here; ladies and gentlemen I give you-- PANZER FRONT AUSF.B, for the PS2!

I scoured the net looking for this title and came up short, so I decided to take the matter into my own hands and upload it myself.

Panzer Front Ausf.B is the PS2 sequel to the critically acclaimed Panzer Front and Panzer Front Bis, for the psx. The game realistically depicts tank warfare in North Africa during World War 2. Players may choose any of the belligerents for each mission. In depth planning is key to defeating the enemy-- no John Rambos here.

This is a really rare game because it was only released in EU and Japan. It's an even RARER torrent, so please seed.

This is an iso file. Works good on pc emulator. Should be burnable.

Please comment if their is a problem. I shall aid you as best I can.

Enjoy and good luck, the deserts of North Africa are an unforgiving place.
