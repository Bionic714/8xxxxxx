,Ep1cSauce,2013-02-10T08:07Z,Is it possible to use only the DLCs so I can install onto my steam version of Skyrim?
,grateful2tpb,2013-02-10T08:30Z,"The game works but I don't think I'm able to get the DLCs to work.

I followed the instructions but I don't think the installer fix is working. I'm running it with admin rights but sometimes it tells me that the registry entries were modified successfully but sometimes it gives me errors like this:

System.IO.DirectoryNotFoundException: Could not find a part of the parth 'C;Users\AppData/Local/Skyrim'.
at System.IO.__Error.WinIOError(Int32 errorCode, String maybeFullPath) at System.IO.Directory.Delete(String fullPath, String userPath, Boolean recursive)
at Elder ScrollsVSkyrimInstallerFix.frmMain.AppendLauncherVariables()

The Datafiles option is grayed out in SkyrimLauncher so I don't think any of the DLC load.


I did change the default name of the folder that contains all the Skyrim files when I put it in Program Files. Do you think this is why the DLCs are broken?"
,DIYDeath,2013-02-10T08:52Z,"@ grateful

I have a similar problem, I got further along with the solution though.

Got the game to run without DLC, had the same Install Fix errors you're running into.

The data files being greyed out is fixable by going in document/my games/skyrim and editing the skyrimpref file there.

add the line
bEnableFileSelection=1
under the {launcher} section.

This version also seems to be unable to run with nexusmodmanager because the torrent is disorganized and not in a ""installed"" state.
It's missing the ""data"" folder and instead has files loose in the main folder.

If anyone else has info to help get this torrent working properly I'm all ears but so far this one's a bit of a flop."
,DIYDeath,2013-02-10T08:57Z,"Also get the

""
 System.IO.DirectoryNotFoundException: Could not find a part of the parth 'C;UsersAppData/Local/Skyrim'.
 at System.IO.__Error.WinIOError(Int32 errorCode, String maybeFullPath) at System.IO.Directory.Delete(String fullPath, String userPath, Boolean recursive)
 at Elder ScrollsVSkyrimInstallerFix.frmMain.AppendLauncherVariables()""

error. Google greyed out data files for skyrim to find out how to fix that problem.

Nexusmodmanager also doesn't seem to work with this since there's no data folder where the .esm files are supposed to be located (instead of thrown willy-nilly in the main folder).

This torrent is a great idea but wasn't done right. I'd much rather install each of these myself and have a to-do list 30 steps long then screw around with this."
,kvntvan,2013-02-10T09:21Z,"Torrent works fine. Just extract the file to your desktop first before running the Install Fixer as admin. Then move it into your Program Files.

I'm having an issue though where I constantly crash 1-3 minutes into playing. It might just be me though. I've tried a few things that haven't worked including reinstalling and turning off some of the DLCs and downloading the unofficial patch mods. "
,DIYDeath,2013-02-10T09:49Z,"Finally got this pain in the $%^ torrent to work, lol.

Let's rewrite those instructions so they apply to everyone.

How to install:
1. Unzip into your Program Files folder (even for 64bit users, it must be your program files folder. It CANNOT be anywhere else-including your 86x program files- or the Installer Fixer won't work)
2. Run DirectX 11 setup and VCRedist setup from inside their respective folders.
3. Run Reloaded's install fix as administrator (Thanks RELOADED! This cuts out a lot of otherwise intense manual work!)
4. Run the SkyrimLauncher, under Data files, check the DLCs you want to use.
5. Play Game!

Another side note which is needed, when I unzipped this winzip removed all the paths and just threw the files into one folder. If your winzip is a baddie too then you need to manually make each path folder and unzip the files into their proper pathing.

I'll update the comments if I get mods working with this version.
GJ to the uploader, it's a good torrent and ty for the effort. :)"
,WDoubleYouW,2013-02-10T13:44Z,"Guys, this is all quite simple.

@Ep1cSauce
Yes, you may simply copy the DLC files from this torrent and place them inside your Steam installation.

@grateful2tpb
Of course if you rename the the folder you're going to experience problems. Why? How do you think the install fix identifies the game? By the name! The path has to be correct for it to work!

@DIYDeath
Can't believe you hurt yourself so badly with such simple instructions! The reason it was a pain was becuz you didn't know basic things. Next time extract it correctly first! It is not a mess, and indeed is very well organized. And it does work with Nexus mod manager as well. And it's not broken. The install fix only works if you tell it where you have installed the game!

Steps to get someone like you to understand how to install:
1. Get 7-zip. Or WinRAR. Heck, get both.
2. Extract somewhere. Preferably your desktop as you'll probably lose it otherwise.
3. Right-click and cut the ENTIRE folder from your desktop into your Program Files directory, and since you're a little kid, you are NOT allowed to install it anywhere else!
4. Inside the folder you just moved into your Program Files folder is another folder entitled DirectX. Double-click to enter that folder.
5. Scroll down, down, down until you find the dxsetup and install it. Follow the onscreen instructions!
6. Go back and find the VCRedist folder. No, it isn't related to outdated VCRs that used to play VHS videos. It's a Visual C++ runtime required to play the game. Install it if it hasn't been installed previously (it will say to repair it if it's already been installed).
7. Go back and find the Install Fix folder. Enter. Right-click and run as Administrator. Make sure the path is correct and that you haven't improvised your own steps into the equation that could ruin everything, like renaming all files in the directory youmomishot.avi. Apply.
8. Now lying in The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim directory is a program called SkyrimLauncher. Launch it. It should detect video card settings and apply a guess as to the best quality settings to apply. Now go into the Data section. If the Data section is greyed out, you messed something up, so go back and repeat steps 1 through 7 until you get it right. Select the DLCs you want to use.
9. Play Game

@kvntvan
The install fix only half works if you apply it while Skyrim is on your desktop and you then move it. Run it again for where you haved moved it to. As for the crashes, it may be something to do with your video card, or it may be something else. Try running it on low settings to see if that helps. The thing is, this game is so large it's almost impossible for me to be able to tell you why it's crashing, as there are so many possible reasons."
,grateful2tpb,2013-02-10T21:32Z,"WDoubleYouW, I followed your detailed instructions step by step but Data Files is still grayed out. 

I'm using Windows 8, so perhaps that's the issue? Have you tested this release on Windows 8?"
,WDoubleYouW,2013-02-10T22:08Z,"@grateful2tpb
I test all my torrents on Windows 7 and 8 at a minimum, and it worked on both without a hitch. 

Tell you what, I'll walk you through manually. You say you got the game working, just the Data files is greyed out. If this is the case, you should probably only need to do a little edit to an ini file.

Go to your Documents folder. Enter the directory called ""My Games."" Then go into Skyrim. Now open the SkyrimPrefs.ini file with a text editor (e.g. Notepad). Press CTRL+F and search for [Launcher]. It will probably say something like this:

[Launcher]
bShowAllResolutions=1
uLastAspectRatio=3

Add a new line to it which says:
bEnableFileSelection=1

It should now something like this:
[Launcher]
bEnableFileSelection=1
bShowAllResolutions=1
uLastAspectRatio=3

Save it. Reload the Skyrim Launcher and you should now be able to select the DLCs you want."
,grateful2tpb,2013-02-10T23:34Z,"WDoubleYouW, that worked! But didn't it install that way automatically?

After I installed SKSE and SkyUI, that line disappeared and Data Files was greyed out again. I had to re-insert those lines. 

I set SkyUI and the 3 DLCs to load. I do not know if the DLCs have loaded in game, but I have been able to set it in Data Files.

One issue I've noticed is that Skyrim introduces one half-second lag when I move my mouse in in-game menus. Is that Skyrim or SkyUI's fault? It's annoying to use the menus. I don't think its because my computer is too slow.

But thanks WDoubleYouW for excellent customer service. ;) You've gone the extra mile."
,kvntvan,2013-02-11T00:07Z,"I'm sure the crashing is something wrong with my own system and not the torrent itself, follow the instructions above and it should work fine for most. 

If anyone else gets it working and experiences random CTD's 1-3 minutes into playing, do tell."
,WDoubleYouW,2013-02-11T06:03Z,"@grateful2tpb
The mouse issue is a well-known problem that is generally fixed by a SkyrimPrefs.ini tweak.

Open the SkyrimPrefs.ini (the same file we edited earlier), and search for bMouseAcceleration (located under [Controls]). Set it equal to 0. Save."
,BFausto,2013-02-11T13:40Z,"Hi WDoubleYouW. Your walkthrough was very concise. But when I run the install fix as admnistrator, it tells me that I'm not running it as admnistrator. I am sure I am running it, since I am admnistrator, and I right click it, and press ""run as admnistrator"". So, is there someway you can help me, or it's just my computer who is a enourmous jerk? -.-"
,WDoubleYouW,2013-02-11T14:33Z,"@BFausto

If you mean this message: ""This tool require to be run in administrator mode, if you already have run it in admin mode or have admin rights then click OK!"" It always says that. It's simply a safeguard against those nutballs who don't follow instructions."
,BFausto,2013-02-11T15:02Z,"Yes, it says that, I press OK, because I do know I'm on administrator, then I press Save, and it gives me an error, saying that it can't copy the ini file, and that I should do it as an administrator. Which makes me go ""-.- thanks for the tip, computer."""
,BFausto,2013-02-11T15:16Z,"I click OK when it says that, but then it gives me an error, saying it couldn't copy the .ini file, and that I should run the fix as administrator. Since I am already running it as administrator, I don't know what else can be done."
,BFausto,2013-02-11T15:16Z,"Sorry for the double post, I couldn't see the first one -.-"
,WDoubleYouW,2013-02-11T17:28Z,"@BFausto
That's odd. Can you open up SkyrimLauncher at all? If you can, is Data files greyed out? If it isn't, you probably are fine. If it is, follow the instructions I gave in my comment to grateful2tpb at 2013-02-10 22:08 CET. If the launcher gives you an error about not being able to find the ini file, do the following:

1. Run TESV. Let it load up and then quit.
2. Run SkyrimLauncher. It shouldn't error this time. 
3. It may say Install at the top. If it does, click it. It will turn to Play if it's already finished that.
4. If Data files is greyed out, add bEnableFileSelection=1 to the [Launcher] section as I described in a previous comment.
5. Once that's all working, load the SkyrimLauncher, click Data, and select the DLCs you want to use.
6. You should be good to go. Play."

And thanks again for the help."
,WDoubleYouW,2013-02-11T18:50Z,"@babygotback
Skyrim's system requirements don't necessarily require v11 of DirectX. Just make sure you have DirectX v9.0c for XP and you should be fine by skipping the v11 installation. I haven't tested this on XP, but you should be okay. You will receive errors about missing dll files related to directX if it doesn't work, but it should work."

,WDoubleYouW,2013-02-16T00:03Z,"@JaboiNuck
The version 1.3.22.0 you're seeing is the SkyrimLauncher version number, not Skyrim's. You need to go to properties - details of TESV.exe to find out the real version number, which is 1.8.151.0.7.

If you're not getting the DLCs, try this troubleshooting procedure:

Go to your Documents folder. Enter the directory called ""My Games."" Then go into Skyrim. Now open the SkyrimPrefs.ini file with a text editor (e.g. Notepad). Press CTRL+F and search for [Launcher]. It will probably say something like this:

[Launcher]
bShowAllResolutions=1
uLastAspectRatio=3

Add a new line to it which says:
bEnableFileSelection=1

,WDoubleYouW,2013-02-16T17:31Z,"@Marasz
To use the DLCs with Steam, you don't need this torrent, as this is the entire game, although you could rip them out of the Data folder. You should use:
https://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8108221 for Dragonborn
https://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7499137 for Dawnguard
https://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7699805 for Hearthfire
https://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8114627 for High Resolution Texture Pack

Take the BSA/ESM/ESP files and insert them in Skyrim's Data Directory and activate them in the SkyrimLauncher.

I'm not sure what you mean by trophies/friends and all, since this is a single player game.

@thexreaper
You must have done something wrong, probably in the extraction process or the download process. Force-recheck of the torrent and make sure you have the entire file. Then extract with 7-zip or WinRAR. Red question marks in-game are a sign of data corruption which are best fixed with a reinstall."

,WDoubleYouW,2013-02-16T21:14Z,"@thexreaper
If the VCRedist and Install Fix said that they were damaged, it is likely that they weren't the only items affected. Therefore, I'd advise a redownload.

It's normal for the VCRedist to be already installed, since it is require by a lot of programs. It's simply included for those who just might not have it installed. Same thing for DirectX.

The install fix needs to know where you extracted Skyrim. Make sure you have it on the folder that TESV is in. You can have it in any directory if you do this."

At first Skyrim worked just fine, but everything that from the DLCs isnt working... Well it is, but in the form of a giant red question mark.

If i download the Dlcs and add them it wont make any problems? Because i had all the Dlcs before i just wanted to redownload everything because all the mods i used make Skyrim really slow, and now its really fast.

The problem is not the install fix. The install fix almost always throws that little pop-up from Windows asking if it was installed correctly. Don't worry about it.

,WDoubleYouW,2013-02-22T18:39Z,"@PlagueMachine
There are several possibilities. Try this:

1. Run TESV as administrator
2. Load game and change the keys you want
3. Make sure you see the little note that says ""Saving"" after you press ESC
4. Save you game
5. Quit and relaunch to see if the controls are as you set them. If they are, you're all set."
,Gloodizzle,2013-02-23T09:45Z,"Hey Double.. you are fucking awesome bro. The amount of effort you put into helping people is legit and I appreciate the fuck out of you. I myself am having a small issue. Finished dling this torrent, ran the directx install, tried to run the install fix, ran into same issues a few others had, went into docs >my games >skyrimpref and added that code to the txt file.. that allowed me to run the launcher no problem and data was not greyed out, HOWEVER.. when I go into data I see no available DLC. I see the DLC files in my data directory in my skyrim folder, but like I said, no DLC appears to be showing in the data tab through the games launcher. Wat do brother!?"
,WDoubleYouW,2013-02-23T12:48Z,"@Gloodizzle
I've never had that problem, but try this:

1. Go to users(your user account)AppDataLocalSkyrim
2. There should be three text files in there:
DLCList.txt
loadorder.txt
plugins.txt
3. Make sure all three have this in it:
Dawnguard.esm
Dragonborn.esm
Hearthfires.esm"
,Konda1,2013-02-23T13:56Z,"I have the same problem as Gloodizzle.

I see no DLC in the data files."
,Konda1,2013-02-23T14:20Z,"Okay , I went to AppDataLocalSkyrim but I only found two text files :

DLClist
plugins

There was no third text file.

And what do you mean by : Make sure all three have this in it:
Dawnguard.esm
Dragonborn.esm
Hearthfires.esm 

You cannot insert those files into text files.
"
,Konda1,2013-02-23T14:53Z,"Ahh nevermind , I fixed by running install fix as an admin.

I completely forgot about that.

But I appreciate the help you are giving to the others. Most uploaders dont give a shit..."
,WDoubleYouW,2013-02-23T15:16Z,"@Konda1
LOL. You don't stick those files inside the text file! ROFL. You add a line of text that says that. Literally a text file with three lines:
Dawnguard.esm
Dragonborn.esm
Hearthfires.esm"
,gjuro,2013-02-23T19:05Z,"First of thanks WDoubleYouW for the upload and all the effort your putting in this. You should be awarded some skulls next to your name. I hope you can help me with my problem. I've done everything you said (hopefully)correctly. I can see all of dlcs under data files and they are checked. But when I run the game, nothing happens. The same old skyrim appears. I can't see any changes, like if i had never installed dlcs. Please help :)"
,gjuro,2013-02-23T19:08Z,"*you're 
sorry for the spam. i just couldn't stand that irritating typo :)"
,DatrixTSW,2013-02-23T23:33Z,Could this work for steam or Do I have to do something else for that.
,WDoubleYouW,2013-02-24T07:12Z,"@gjuro
What level character are you? Most of the DLCs don't activate until you get a certain level. As far as I'm aware, if they're checked, they're there.

Dawnguard activates at level 10
Dragonborn activates after your first visit to the Greybeards is completed and you're in town (usually)."
,WDoubleYouW,2013-02-24T07:16Z,"@DatrixTSW
You don't need this for Steam, as this is the full game with the DLCs bundled all together in one package. Of course you could simply rip the DLCs out of this package and insert them into your Steam installation, but that's a lot of hassle. Get the DLCs here:
https://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8154169 for Dawnguard
https://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8151165 for Hearthfire
https://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8108221 for Dragonborn"
,omgzelda,2013-02-25T03:21Z,"Installed, works perfectly! Takes a bit of patience to install it correctly but once you figure it out, its a great choice! Much love"
,Volkh666,2013-02-25T15:01Z,Thanks for the torrent. Installed and works great however I can`t activate high resolution texture pack in the launcher. All DLCs are listed except high res pack. What should I do?
,WDoubleYouW,2013-02-25T15:28Z,"@Volkh666
I didn't include the High Resolution texture pack in this torrent, as it would have increased the size by 4 gb. If you want the High Resolution texture pack...
1. Download it https://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8114627
2. Copy it into the Data directory
3. Activate it in the launcher."
,kylepc,2013-03-05T15:49Z,"The DLC's show up in my launcher but when i launch skyrim to play, it closes right after the bethesda logo :/ help please."
,kylepc,2013-03-05T16:11Z,"also, i don't use any mods. "
,kylepc,2013-03-05T16:44Z,"its a clean install btw, no mods."

,Wywy83,2013-03-08T14:29Z,"No wait scratch that, there ain't any textures when I try playing the game !"
,WDoubleYouW,2013-03-08T14:41Z,"@Wywy83
It sounds like your graphics card isn't compatible. Please visit systemrequirements dot com to see what hardware you need to upgrade."
,Wywy83,2013-03-08T16:54Z,"@WDoubleYouW
Nope, fully compatible, already installed the game a few months ago but deleted it because I had too much games on my drives. Anyway problem was coming from the download, somehow when I unzipped it the textures didn't came out properly. Seems fixed now. Computer magic you may say !"
,mcdubble,2013-03-09T02:28Z,i cant run the directxsetup. it says the file directory is corrupted. what did i do wrong?
,WDoubleYouW,2013-03-09T04:55Z,"@mcdubble
Try skipping this step, as you most likely have DirectX already installed and it is only included in case you don't."
,Runner17,2013-03-10T21:09Z,"I downloaded this (thanks) and i cant access my data files and i have the enable file selection line in the prefs, so do i have to get to a certain point in the game where i can use the data files or something?"
,WDoubleYouW,2013-03-11T03:59Z,"@Runner17
Didn't you run the Install Fix successfully? No, you don't need to get a certain length in the game to activate Data files. There's a number of troubleshooting advice for these types of issues in the comments here,  so your problem is probably covered if you read some of them."
,Joxn,2013-03-11T06:19Z,"Hello, I'm having trouble with the  Install fix step. Whenever I try to open it, or even run it as administer.  A couple windows pop-up telling me that I'm not running it in administer even though I am?"
,WDoubleYouW,2013-03-11T12:45Z,"@Joxn
Did you try reading the pop-up? The pop-up always comes up just to remind you that if you're not doing it right, it will not work."
,Joxn,2013-03-11T13:49Z,"The first pop-up is basically just asking, and confirming that it's being opened with administrator.
The second one is
 ""Failed to copy the source INI file (C:Programfiles/Skyrim/The Elders Scrolls V Skyrim/ Skyrim/SkyrimPrefs.ini) destination INI file (C:Users/Gamer/Documents/My Games/Skyrim/SkyrimPrefs.ini). Make sure you have administrator rights when running this program! "" 
Even though I've tried right-click ""Run as administrator"" And when in to the properties giving even un-administrator user ""Full access"" and tried opening normal, neither worked.
The game works, I started it, but I closed it out during the intro talking scene once you start a new game because the Save section when pressing escape was grayed out. Also because of the installation fix thing none of the DLC are available to be checked."
,WDoubleYouW,2013-03-11T18:17Z,"When you're still in the first intro dialogue scene, you won't be able to save until after the first Autosave, since it's still in the intro ""movie."" After that, you'll be able to save.

To fix the problem where you can't select DLCs...

Go to your Documents folder. Enter the directory called ""My Games."" Then go into Skyrim. Now open the SkyrimPrefs.ini file with a text editor (e.g. Notepad). Press CTRL+F and search for [Launcher]. It will probably say something like this:

[Launcher]
bShowAllResolutions=1
uLastAspectRatio=3

Add a new line to it which says:
bEnableFileSelection=1

It should now something like this:
[Launcher]
bEnableFileSelection=1
bShowAllResolutions=1
uLastAspectRatio=3

Save it. Reload the Skyrim Launcher and you should now be able to select the DLCs you want."
,Runner17,2013-03-11T23:06Z,sorry again to comment haha but i tried doing the install fix and i had the same problem as Joxn but then when i run as admin i get a 3rd message that says Register entries successfully generated but launcher variables could not be set
,Joxn,2013-03-12T01:01Z,"I also get the third pop-up but didn't think that one mattered to mention. I just tried to look for the .ini file under, it wasn't there. The only .ini file was under The Elder Scrolls V folder. After changing it though it didn't help the problem I've been having with the Install fix program not working. 
When I press the Skyrim Launcher now a pop-up appears and say's that the "".ini file is missing please re-install Skyrim"" But still let's the game start.
Well it use to let me click the data file tab on the launcher before this, but whenever I would there would just be an empty window. None of the DLC were even there to be clicked or not."
,Joxn,2013-03-12T01:08Z,Just a quick added question. How will it effect the game if I'm not able to use the Install fix program?
,WDoubleYouW,2013-03-12T05:56Z,"Is there no ini files in the Documents --> My Games --> Skyrim folder? If so...

1. Right-click TESV.exe and run as administrator
2. Exit and check to see if the ini files have been generated
3. If they haven't, try copying the Skyrim_default.ini in the main directory to the Documents --> My Games --> Skyrim folder and renaming it Skyrim.ini. Then copy the SkyrimPrefs.ini that you found in the Skyrim subdirectory and paste it at the same place.
4. Load the game up once and exit
5. Check to see if you now can select in Data files.

If you cannot activate the DLCs in the Data section, you will not be able to play them."
,Joxn,2013-03-12T06:33Z,"I'm sorry, I'm pretty bad with explaining this. Maybe this will help clear things slightly -> http://i.imgur.com/ZURln4E.jpg"
,Joxn,2013-03-12T06:39Z,"I just retried the steps you said a third time, the DLC are available. I'm hoping that they will stay this way even if I after I close out the game.
I'm sorry for the trouble, thank you for being so helpful."
,Sh4d0w183,2013-03-12T09:26Z,It works PERFECT. Thx m8 xD
,Runner17,2013-03-14T00:57Z,"I fixed it i had to go to the skyrim prefs in documents, my games, skyrim i just went to where i extracted the files well thanks this is a great download!"
,scaar88,2013-03-14T20:45Z,"Hi guys, i just found how to fix the prob. after take 2 hour and i found the mistake that i make."
,scaar88,2013-03-14T20:49Z,"1. After extract the file, we can see the path for folder like C:Program FilesThe Elder Scrolls V SkyrimThe Elder Scrolls V Skyrim. just make it to C:Program FilesThe Elder Scrolls V Skyrim.

2. Open up your Windows® Regedit.
Find this folder : HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SOFTWARE/Bethesda Softworks/Skyrim
Extra step: If that doesn't exist create it. Also create a new string value and rename it into ""Installed Path"".
Make sure you set the string value by your skyrim installation directory.    
example: C:Program FilesThe Elder Scrolls V Skyrim

x64 bit users need to make that string in

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREWow6432NodeBethesda SoftworksSkyrim


make sure the path is like the 1st one. i just make it to C:Program FilesThe Elder Scrolls V Skyrim

3. run skyrim installer fix again.and then start SkyrimLauncher.exe, wait a second, if it still doesnt appear, then click ""Play"" button.

im sure it will solve your problem."
,RavenousRaven,2013-03-15T04:27Z,Can you use dlc if you have the paid version of skyrim?

i have one quick question though, when i played skyrim cracked before it worked smooth for me in windowed mode, but now for some odd reason every 10 minutes or so into the game it starts to freeze and slow down like an fps drop, any ideas what might be causing it?
i have all settings on minimum and use windowed mode. thanks in advance  "

,penele,2013-03-24T17:26Z,"To everyone having trouble, make sure that before you run the installer fix the directory is the same that you have put your The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim folder in. 

For example if your Skyrim folder is in Program Files (x86)/The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim, make the directory in the installer fix is the same.

When I first tried it, I was having the same error as you all, then I realized I had put the Skyrim folder into the (x86) version of Program Files and the Installer Fix had just the standard Program Files as a directory. I moved the SKyrim folder to the Program Files directory and it worked perfectly."
