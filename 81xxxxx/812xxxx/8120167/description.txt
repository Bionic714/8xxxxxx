This is Borderlands 2 standalone version 1.3.1.

	All additional content and options are available (all tested):
- Mechromancer Pack: available when you choose a character class.
- Creature Slaughter Dome: enter at the far east of "Wildlife Exploitation Preserve".
- Captain Scarlett and her Pirate's Booty: Fast Travel to "Oasis".
- Mr. Torgue's Campaign of Carnage: Fast Travel to "Badass Crater of Badassitude".
- Sir Hammerlock's Big Game Hunt: Fast Travel to "Hunter's Grotto".
- All appearance customizations are available, including all 15 Madness, Supremacy and Domination packs.
- From the Premiere Club Pack: characters get the Vault Hunter's Relic and Gearbox GunPack. Plus, you get 255 Golden Key instead of a measly single one!
- From the Collector's Edition Pack: Contraband Sky Grenade.


	Other changes (all tested):
- When opening the loot chest in Sanctuary, you don't loose a Golden Key (but you still need one). Yeah, you can loot that golden chest as often as you want.
- English, French, German, Italian and Spanish localizations are included.
- Standalone version: no Steam connection required.


Limitations:
- As this is a standalone version, all functions requiring Steam can't (and won't) work, so: no internet game, no Shift Codes... Don't lament, go buy the game. However, LAN multiplayer games do work (tested between two Macs).
- LAN games version restrictions still apply: don't mix versions of Borderlands 2, be it PC or Mac.
