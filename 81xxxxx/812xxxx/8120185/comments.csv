[V],psspss,2013-02-09T06:02Z,"ta looks like scene is 12 hours away again :)
seesm to alternate

so why did you add alaska again in the naming

they dropped it 2 seasons ago"
,xxsupaxx,2013-02-09T06:34Z,thanks for the quick work
[T],MrUnpopular,2013-02-09T06:56Z,"I added Alaska again because that's what the scene and even BALLISTIC (P2P) has done. I realised that even when a show changes its name, whatever the name originally was, they still keep it in the release title.

For the scene they have topsites that are archive sites (home to tons of old releases) and in order to keep everything organised you'd see something like:

Gold.Rush.Alaska.S01E01.HDTV.XviD-MOMENTUM
Gold.Rush.Alaska.S01E02.HDTV.XviD-MOMENTUM
Gold.Rush.Alaska.S01E03.HDTV.XviD-MOMENTUM

etc. Removing Gold Rush ruins the organisation and everything so it's just best to keep it intact.

Either way it doesn't change anything, the episode is the same."
[T],MrUnpopular,2013-02-09T07:19Z,"For those looking for The Dirt/Pay Dirt

missing both airings of it. I do have last week's though but I'm debating uploading it since BALLISTIC did an upload of it. It's just not on TPB I believe. Hopefully BALLISTIC uploads it again for this week. If not, TrollHD usually puts them on Usenet within a week or two, I'll just grab it then if so."
