,Mutegrill,2013-03-01T14:23Z,"That's a really stupid comment junoon! No one has ever questioned your torrents, you are well aware that tpb mods warned you multiple times about you having been uploading movies into the ""Other"" category to bypass the block on uploading URL-files into the Movies category.

But now it seems you come to your sences, actually uploading into the correct category WITHOUT URL-files. That's GREAT man, I applaude you for that, because you ARE needed :-) And look; the number of seeders has increased, probably due to your posting in the correct  category (where most people, as  I, search within that category)."
