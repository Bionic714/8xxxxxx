Reunion is a live album by heavy metal band Black Sabbath.

Original vocalist Ozzy Osbourne was fired from Black Sabbath in 1979. Following a couple of one-off reunions in 1985 and 1992, the original Sabbath line-up of Ozzy Osbourne, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler and Bill Ward reformed, playing sporadic dates until Dio replaced Ozzy a second time, reforming the Heaven and Hell lineup to tour following the release of the compilation album The Dio Years.

This 2-CD live album was put together from the first two shows after the reunion, at the Birmingham NEC. Along with live versions of tracks such as "Paranoid", "N.I.B.", "Black Sabbath" and "Iron Man", it also features two new studio tracks - "Selling My Soul" and "Psycho Man". This was the only new material to have been officially released by Black Sabbath post-reunion until three new tracks appeared on the post-Ozzy compilation Black Sabbath: The Dio Years in 2007. The two new tracks on Reunion were also released on a single CD in the USA.

Black Sabbath received their only Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance, for the live recording of "Iron Man" from this album. 

It was released as a digipak and in a standard 2CD jewel-case.

Though the band was considered a legend by this time, this was the first "official" live album featuring Osbourne on vocals. 1980's Live at Last was not approved for release by the band until 2002.
