Handel's Messiah.  This is universally considered the best version of The Messiah that has ever been put to video.  It is also Extremely rare and out of print, so I am sharing my copy. I am uploading the entire DVD folder so you should be able to create a DVD using any good DVD copy program.  I used DVDFab7 to create it. Enjoy.
