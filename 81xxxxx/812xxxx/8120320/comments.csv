,internetboxer,2013-02-09T11:56Z,"You messed up there is episode missing , there is no episode where Ashley and Tyler hoop up , and Tyler meets Katie parents... I think this is ep 12..."
,Jessd138,2013-02-09T17:15Z,"internetboxer - You're right, this is episode 12. The episode labelled as 12 is the special unseen moments. We're missing episode 11."
,jchen9999,2013-02-09T23:47Z,please upload mp4 file instead of video file
,Jessd138,2013-02-10T05:17Z,jchen - why? get a player that works like vlc.
,nic198419,2013-02-10T18:24Z,Can we get the proper episodes please? Missing episode 11....come on guys
,Biwy2,2013-02-11T04:00Z,Is it uncensored?
,nic198419,2013-02-14T01:19Z,It actually is 11 and 12 i cheked myself. Tyler meeting Katies parents and him hooking up with Ashley does happen. In the begiinig it shows previosly on and shows that so i thought it was messed up but MTV messed up
,yoashmo,2013-02-17T02:08Z,"@ nic198419 - im pretty sure youre wrong. in this ep 11 tyler has already met katies mom and hooked up with ashley. this is only him getting caught in his lies after all that happened. 
clearly, about 10-15 min in katie talks about him just having met her mom, but that isnt shown in this ep. bc this is ep 12 not 11."
