Description (From GoG.com) : 
As a provincial governor charged with spreading the glory of Rome your mission is clear ΓÇô build cities, foster trade and industry, make money. How you accomplish this is up to you. Gain wealth and power, make a career out of pleasing the emperor, battle barbarians and repel invaders, or concentrate on building the next Eternal City. Fail and you'll end up as lunch for the lions. Prove your strength of mind and spirit and you just might be crowned Caesar!

To help you achieve that goal you can ask your advisors for their insight or ask the people about their thoughts. You can also build temples and create festivals to please the gods and receive rewards or aid in return. You can choose between peaceful and military assignments to prove in various ways that you deserve the title of Caesar!
