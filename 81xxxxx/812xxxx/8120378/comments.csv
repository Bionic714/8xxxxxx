,LazarusL,2013-02-09T06:14Z,"I tried your download last week and thought the video quality was perfectly adequate for a talk show. I appreciate your fine work, and your awesome speed."
,drader,2013-02-09T06:25Z,"Thanks for this and appreciate the speed more than any slightly lesser quality-hell, I'm watching on an ipad so it's all good.  Thanks"
,KushielD,2013-02-09T06:30Z,Thanks sooo much. I hate waiting and really no need for better quality. I just want to see the show!
,Ray186,2013-02-09T06:34Z,Thanks a lot.
,ikepon,2013-02-09T06:42Z,Big up!
,North333,2013-02-09T06:50Z,"Downloading now....40 minutes from airing is damn good upload time, bp1924! Thanks for getting this up so fast, it beats waiting to watch Saturday morning, quality be damned!"
,jcdugger,2013-02-09T06:52Z,"You're the dog!  Thank u soooo much!  PS - Do you take requests?!?  If so, how about a little Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel?  Can't find it on TPB but I miss it sooooo much!  Thanks!!  :)"
,jcdugger,2013-02-09T06:59Z,"How come when I post a comment (I can immediately see the comment posted), then leave the page, then come back to the page...and it's gone?!  Refreshing the page doesn't do dick.  I have to come back like the next day to see if anybody replied to my posts!  Gay as hell!"
,JarjarTwink,2013-02-09T07:00Z,thank you so much. =) 
,dethtek,2013-02-09T07:06Z,"fantastic, please keep up the good work kind person:)"
,Ryan_Maiden,2013-02-09T07:07Z,"Thank you so much, I really appreciate this. I hope you can continue this every week. I've never understood why Real Time seems to be the only show that takes forever to get uploaded."
,clay1111,2013-02-09T07:48Z,"Thanks man. It's a talk show, so quality is not an issue; speed is. You rock!"
,iamralph,2013-02-09T07:50Z,"Thanks a ton, and thanks for increasing the audio bitrate as well!    For a show like this that is mostly talking, this is perfect for me!  Thanks again"
,padenj420,2013-02-09T08:43Z,"Thank you very much. I can overlook the quality, especially for such a great episode. Besides, I can still get the HD copy tomorrow. :)"
,padenj420,2013-02-09T08:45Z,"Oh, and please keep it up. I really appreciate you getting it posted so early. Now, if HBO could work on getting Overtime posted within a day or so, we'll be set. :P"
[V],MP4SUX,2013-02-09T08:48Z,"jcdugger:

Let's see, TPB must be nearing a decade online now, if I've counted my toes right.
That means this is all running on 2003 software and it ALWAYS takes at least
fifteen minutes for it to appear. And there are two ""tunnels"" is as good a word as
any. I post a file, click on the ""MP4SUX"" link to see it at the top of the list of my
shows and it's simply not there. But hit the ""back"" button and the page re-appears.
But click on my link and again it's not there. Some processes here are instant and
some just take much longer.

So, sorry I missed the posting of the full show by hours, but I've been wrestling with
the live OT feed for the first time. I can't believe there isn't a decent FLV cutter.
Live streams don't demux / remux in sync very well. So, for a measly seven minutes
(thankfully AFTER someone posted the show), I've toiled hours and the result is AVI
of almost the same quality as the feed. And just as I was finishing up - HBO made
the canned version (much easier to simply container-change from FLV to MP4). So,
I post both in a high quality form, comments be dammed (yes, I misspell it on porpoise).

MINIs coming in a bit, for continuity's sake, if nothing else.

And having a very bad LOL pixelation evening on top of it all - I hate wasting time
screening something highly desireable that I wouldn't show to a dog. And two eps at that.

Sigh. Hopefully the WEB-DLs of ""Touch"" will show sooner than later.

AVIGUY

And don't forget the most important thing - this kind, wonderful ""bp1924"" is not only
a hero to us all, it's sure to put a crimp in the lazy arrogance that has come to
personify ""The Scene"" release groups of late. 2HD does good work, but without
competition ... well, your Saterday morning comment says it all. A week ago LOL
took a day off and I had an amazing response at having the only sub-720p entry
for Scandal 212 (10,000 in a day - yipes! - there are still near a thousand seeds
for it).

There's really only one thing to do with a monopoly - do what they did 150 years ago.
Call it a trust so we can become ""trust busters"". When they fall down, someone
ALWAYS steps up to take their place. Can't fall soon enough, if you ask me. Don't
need a fabled ""top site"", just the will to do my little bit. hoping it catches on - I
truly need the competition. Which, by the by puts bp1924 in a class far above me.
I am but a lowly re-encoder - bp1924 is a new and true source. Hip-hip-hooray.

I do miss the anonymous person who made those great tiny MKV versions with the
OGG audio, though. Their 3am postings still beat 2HD by a mile."
[T],theburningbush,2013-02-09T08:51Z,"I add my thanks to everyone else's, for the timeliness of your UL.

I always prefer to watch news-related shows as ""news,"" not ""olds!"""
,kwicker1,2013-02-09T09:34Z,"Quality looks like ass. Come on bro, rip it smarter."
,bp1924,2013-02-09T09:55Z,kwicker1 you might want to read the description of the torrent you are downloading before saying dumb things like that. I clearly said the video is not good quality... It is an analog feed so the original video looks just as bad but just as a larger file size.
,ScarletteSpider,2013-02-10T20:42Z,i read thru the comments and don't understand any of the geek speak as to why it takes longer for the overtime minis to be posted. But any effort on that front to get them uploaded same day or even same time of the program would be deeply appreciated. The HBO streaming for these is a machine crashing bandwidth whore. TY for your hard work and speedy uploads and generous bandwidth speeds for us downloaders. You are a  shining new star in the pirate universe and giving the big guns some competition to shake them out of their lazy slow complacency is epic awesomesauce. Keep up the excellent work.
