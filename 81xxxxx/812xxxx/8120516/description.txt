Bad news on the "Touch" front.
As with so many, LOL has pixelated the crap out of it.
Well, more than I (or presumably streaming devices) can take.
So, everyone's gonna get a nice pixelation-free WEB-DL soon (finger's crossed).
If you're wondering - Spartacus blissfully comes from 2HD,
Whom I'd trust to the ends of the earth - never seen a mistake.
Always cleans up after ASAP (and sometimes LOL, but not tonight).
Don't know why "The Scene" doesn't consider pixelation a nuke-able offence.
