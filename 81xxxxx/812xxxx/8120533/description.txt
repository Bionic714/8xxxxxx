Celebrating his 80th birthday this year (2005), B.B. KING is universally hailed as the reigning king of the blues, and a legend in his own time. He is without doubt the most influential electric blues guitar player of our time, having had a formidable impact on the development of both modern blues and rock & roll music. Disc One of BLUES D?AZUR features a concert by B.B. KING and his Orchestra, recorded in January 1983, at the Palais the Festivals in Cannes, France. Disc two, contains no less than 22 vintage recordings of the 50s, from the beginning of the artist?s career, notably his very first hit THREE O?CLOCK BLUES.
