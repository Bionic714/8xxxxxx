,Aandaa,2013-02-09T07:56Z,"SOUND OF REHAB is a musical trance of the film Rehab blended with interrelated visuals and altogether it forms a different form by itself.

HOWRAH SEALDAH TRIP is a specific coinage of words that reminds us the violent laps while rolling the 'substance' through aluminium foil. SILAJIT, the self-maker, overlaps a stretch articulating the coinage in different soundscapes and in between speaks of his understanding of music in a disagreeably agreeable language.

DEATH OF THE NIGHT is ventured by ANANYA and she takes us to a mysterious obscurity through her solitary, and, melancholic sing song. 
PAROMA, on the other hand, in SOUND OF VOID chants the hymn of the material world letting us realize that loss, in any kind, is always from within.  "
