Initially, the Thirty Years War was precipitated in 1618 by religious 
conflicts between Protestants and Catholics in the Holy Roman Empire. 
But the conflict soon spread beyond religion to encompass the internal 
politics and balance of power within the Empire, and then later to the 
other European powers. By the end, it became simply a dynastic struggle 
between Bourbon France and Habsburg Spain. And almost all of it was 
fought out in Germany. After 30 years of conflict, entire regions of 
Germany and Bohemia were depopulated and destroyed by marching armies, 
fire, famine, and disease. It bankrupted most of the participants while 
leaving thousands of German villages, towns, and even cities in smoldering 
ruin.

Because of the political and geographical complexity of the early 17th 
century, an understanding of The Thirty Years War can be difficult to 
grasp in the beginning. Listeners will be rewarded by patience. As an 
aid to comprehension, we recommend the online Wikipedia article "The 
Thirty Years War" for maps and overviews of the geography, principle 
leaders, and major battles.
