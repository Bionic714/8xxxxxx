Count Basie usually brings to mind a legendary rhythm section, Lester Young, Buck Clayton, and such singers as Jimmy Rushing and Billie Holiday. But after World War II, long after his most famous orchestra dissolved, Basie put together another that is among the finest big bands in the history of jazz. Count Basie: Atomic Swing provides all the evidence the most doubtful listener could demand. This is classic jazz.

Capitol Records and Roulette Jazz provide an excellent selection of Basie recordings from 1957 to 1962. The 20-bit Super Bit Mapping sound quality allows the listener to hear in detail what is rarely heard on older, big band recordings. In short, the sections are comprised of individual horn/reed players each with distinct personalities who combine synergistically. The distinct voices can be parsed or you can step back for the larger picture. The same level of sound detail comes forward in the rhythm section: this is a dynamic almost three dimensional recording.
