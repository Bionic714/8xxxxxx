Nursery Management second edition is an introduction to setting up and running profitable and efficient nursery businesses covering production, wholesale and retail nurseries at various scales of operation.
The book discusses all the practical aspects of nursery management from site selection, production systems, and plant propagation through to materials and equipment. Conventional as well as non-chemical biological control measures for pests, weeds and disease control are included.

Management issues for production nurseries, wholesalers and retail nurseries are treated separately for each operation and cover products and services, budgeting, production management, work scheduling and staffing.

The chapter on marketing looks at the major changes that have taken place in the nursery industry, particularly the roles that landscapers, garden centres and hardware stores now play in retailing. It covers market research, promotions, distribution and consumer laws and shows the operator how to define the scope of their operation to fit their resources and how to sell their product for maximum return.
