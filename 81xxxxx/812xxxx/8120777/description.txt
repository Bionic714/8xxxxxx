100 Thematic Word Search Puzzles is a reproducible book of, as the title suggests, 100 word search puzzles. Word search puzzles are the ones where you are given a list of words. You are also given a grid with letters on it. You must search the grid to find all the words from the list. The words camouflaged on the grid go in various directions: left to right, right to left, up and down, and diagonally in any direction. Each puzzle is based on a theme. Each puzzle has at least 40 words to be found. After all the words have been found, the puzzle has not been completed entirely. As a bonus, the remaining or extra letters on the grid can be arranged, in the order they are found on the grid, to make a sentence relevant to the topic. There is a complete Answer Key. Puzzles from 100 Thematic Word Search Puzzles can be used alone or with other thematically linked materials
