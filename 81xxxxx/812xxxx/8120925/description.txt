About the author:

Dr. Bell's adventure in forensic chemistry began a long time
ago in a galaxy far to  the west of West Virginia. She began
with  a BS  with  a  double major  in  chemistry and  police
science(criminal justice)at Northern Arizona University. She
then ventured to the University  of New Haven in Connecticut
and obtained an  MS in forensic science .  After working for
the New Mexico State Police  for several years, she ventured
north to  Los Alamos  National Laboratory  where she  was an
environmental analytical chemist. She returned to university
at the  ripe old  age of  29 at New  Mexico State  where she
obtained  her  PhD  in  chemistry  working  under  Dr.  Gary
Eiceman. Incidentally,  three of  the four  research schools
she has been  affiliated with have colors of  blue and gold,
as was her junior high school.  This could be fate, it could
be destiny, or it could be coincidence.

Suzanne's love of writing began  about the time when she was
at NMSU, where the pressures  of the doctoral program forced
her to  seek an outlet. She  is the author of  much mediocre
and unpublished fiction and the joy  she found in the act of
writing led her to test the non-fiction and textbook waters.
Currently, she  has two projects underway  in various stages
of completion in addition to the books seen here.
