For XVID AVI with MP3 audio, I encode the live feed at hopefully:
V=9
A=9
.
Was completely unprepared for this. I look and the world seems full of FLV cutters
But they all LIE! encodes it withing FLV with XVID MP3 at twice the original size.
But, for a first try, I think I did pretty good. And what luck - HAD to be XVID / AVI.
Simply cannot find the tools to do it within the MP4 realm.
Best ways is right ways, I reckon'.

Up next the weekly full quality MP4 canned HBO feed, followed a bit later with the MINIs.
