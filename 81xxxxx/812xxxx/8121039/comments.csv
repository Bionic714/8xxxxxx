SWF Opener is a great software to play SWF files on your Computer

You have saved a Flash movie (SWF file) to your hard drive. What’s next? How are you going to play it?

Actually, you can play it with Internet Explorer, but if your Internet Explorer starts slowly or you just don’t want to bother yourself with “file association configuration”, then use SWF Opener – swf files player!
