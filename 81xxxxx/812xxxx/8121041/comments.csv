Oh, I get it - MP4 SUX and I post an MP4,
Therefore I SUX by betraying my core beliefs. Cute.

But first, you gotta say it with an ""X"", so it ends with a hiss like from a scarey snake.
I'm sorry, your demeanonor just does't sing ""confrontation"" like it should.

Went and had a look see and frankly, I AM IMPRESSED. Not a large collecion,
but it puts most of my detractors to shame. Nice tight 700MB AVI files (XVID?).
I would have foregone the subtitles just to have single file torrents,
but each to their own preferences.
.
I am frankly surprised, what with your ""yo momma"" attitude,
I was half expecting you to be offering your fare via the new MP4 / x264 / AAC craze.
.
Two old-school AVI guys putting forth our favorites in nice compact,
almost minimalist sized files. You, sir decidedly do NOT SUX.
Not even a little bit.
.
Good to know yau by your work.

AVIGUY

For the record, these MP4 files I post came in FLV form
and I just did a quick container change.
Was a time I would have gone one step further
and made them AVI / x264 / MP3.
But I finally came to the conclusion that I was going an extra step
just to make it LESS appealing to folks. So, I bit the bullet,
swallowed the Irony and did the right thing. And people seem to respond.

Go figure .."
