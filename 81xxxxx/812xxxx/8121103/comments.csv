Because that was what the ancient scene people did back when they transmitted files via smoke signals. Sceneline is just maintaining tradition, even tough the technical reasons for using RAR-files are not really there any more. It even hurts seeding by people unpacking and then deleting their rars to save space = Broken seed. 

People are lazy bastards, might just work with it, not against it.

 Just shut up and enjoy your free file... You wont change his ways. There have been far greater bitchers about this than you, and they all failed."
