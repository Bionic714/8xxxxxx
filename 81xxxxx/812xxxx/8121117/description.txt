The Police live on their last world tour on Sep.17th 83 in Augsburg, Germany as headliner of an open air festival. It was a rainy, unfriendly day when Tears For Fears, Joan Jett and others had no real chance to move the crowd everyone trying to hide from the rain. But, in await for The Police to appear, maybe a quarter before 8pm clouds got lighter and even a sort of red sunset had to be seen. Following then a spectacular concert of the group not hiding their tensions even on stage. It's evidence that Sting humiliates the poor Andy Summers several times, until the guitar player eventually came over to Sting in order to hit him.

This is for afficionados, not for HiFi-Listeners. Recorded on Sony TCS 300, distributed on MC. Burn without 2sec pause to maintain continuity.

Remastered by TDBM. Enjoy!
