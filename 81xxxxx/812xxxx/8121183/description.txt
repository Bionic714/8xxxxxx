Album Info

Pimpalation is the second solo album by Pimp C released on July 11, 2006. "I'm Free," featuring a sample of Free Fallin' by Tom Petty, is the first single from the album. Rolling Stone voted the single one of the year's best, placing it at #80 on its Top 100 list. Additional singles "Knockin' Doorz Down" and "Pourin' Up" also saw release.

This CD is the follow-up and the soundtrack for the DVD that took you inside the life of Pimp C, as he gets his life back together after his release from prison on 12/30/05. The Pimpalation DVD showed Pimp C celebrating his release and in the studio working on music with a host of stars including Scarface, Lil' Flip, Young Jeezy, Z-Ro, Webbie, and Bun B. Lil' Flip and Young Jeezy, didn't appear on the album though. Pimp C only has one solo song on the album and the rest are collaborations. Bun B appears on two songs, "Pourin Up" and "Rock 4 Rock". The two songs could considered new material by UGK. Classic dirty south star Willie D raps in "Rock 4 Rock", but is not credited. Smoke D appeared in the brutal song "I Don't Fuck Wit U."

The album was certified Gold on March 8, 2007. Disc 2 off the album is a chopped and screwed version mixed by Michael 5000 Watts. In 2009, this album was named number 24 on houstonpress.com' list of the 25 best Houston Hip Hop Albums
