BBC Radio 1 Essential Mix from 09.02.2013

Mat Zo makes his Essential Mix debut with a seventy track spectacular. He says of the experience:

"I started making music when I was eight. And I started DJing when I was a teenager after a special music class. DJ Pied Piper came in and taught us all how to mix and from that moment i was hooked! All the music in the (essential) mix is stuff that has inspired me or stuff that is hardwired into my brain from listening to it so much! There are also new tracks that give me hope in the music industry. I started laying down tracks and seeing where the mix would go and it was a really experimental process in a lot of ways. I chose tracks that wouldn't necessarily would go together in a club set, but would work as something you would listen to on a day-to-day basis". Mat Zo, February 2013.
