Available From: Oct 09, 2012 ,This is an epic series of tiny proportions. From family quarrels, to love affairs, to life threatening situations - these fuzzy cute animals rarely have a dull moment!

Standing tall at only one foot high, the meerkat is a small member of the mongoose family that thrives in one of the driest places on Earth -- the Kalahari Desert. On the surface, the meerkats seem like adorable creatures, but do their cute facades mask their true colors? These highly social creatures are precocious and tough enough to send a cape cobra slinking into a hole.
All shot in 3D and at meerkat eye level this series catches the pure essence of the Kalahari and what it's actually like being inside the gang.
Additionally the filming of the Gosa Gang is being broadcast LIVE on the Internet 24 hours per day, allowing viewers, when not watching the 3D documentary, to keep up to date with all the drama.

This series has been selected at the worlds' largest 3D film festival and was part of 3DFF's family and kids screenings in August 2012. The series is distributed and represented by 3D Content Hub trailor is on youtube"
