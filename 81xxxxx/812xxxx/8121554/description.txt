   Seeing reflections of Mumbai under the red  
   light, Talaash is a tale of love lost,      
   fatal attraction and above all the quest    
   to solve a perfect crime. Suspense at its   
   core, Talaash explores Mumbai's underbelly  
   like never before.                          
   Aamir Khan plays an investigation officer,  
   who receives a phone call early in the      
   morning informing him about death and an    
   accident and how everything starts to unfold
   from there. What looks like a simple car    
   accident investigation turns into a haunting
   mystery as further investigations show many 
   anomalies were stringed to the death        
   of the victim.
