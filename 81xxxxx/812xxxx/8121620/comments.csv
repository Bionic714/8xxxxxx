Amigos este es el último torrent que subo, he decidido no gastar más tiempo en un trabajo que no me aporta nada, ni siquiera un mínimo agradecimiento por parte de The Piratebay y muy pocos por vuestra parte. Ser buenos."
,veronease,2013-02-09T22:56Z,"Thanks for the upload, I am sure many other's appreciate your hard work.  I am just too lazy to comment but I'll say thanks in the future! "
,brian_15,2013-02-10T03:01Z,"Thank You So Much! I Know its alot of hard work to keep adding great quality torrents and keeping them alive, and i thank you for all you have done!

Many Thanks To @geloso"

Thank you!"
,3dUbhEAd3,2013-02-14T08:18Z,"Pretty devastating to hear you wont be continuing your work but I do appreciate all the time you have put into it even if I have only gave minimal thanks and if I could I would beg you to keep adding torrents but its you decision and piratebay will look lonely without you mate, thanks for everything! Have a good one!"
,summer1967love,2013-02-28T15:44Z,"Geloso, I'm sorry you feel so underappreciated for all the mass elation you've spread around the Bay and beyond. Getting good shit for nothing breeds its own contempt. If you're not feeling well also, by all means, drop the small stuff. My sister told me long ago (cuz I'm 50 years old) ""send all the letters you want, but don't expect replies."" That means don't expect my desires expressed thru communication to be reciprocated. Express yourself because you want to, not because you want a response. We're all selfish bastards, but end of the day, we're richer because you have a superb record collection. Peace."

,Meisterwerke,2013-03-06T01:55Z,"Esperas recibir palmaditas y demas? no, es triste que aun aportando cosas haya pocos que agradezcan el trabajo. Pasa en muchas situaciones... en este caso seguramente muchos lo agradezcan pero no comentaran por vagancia.

Salu2 y que te vaya bien ;)"
[T],geloso,2013-03-07T19:12Z,"No me importa demasiado que la gente me agradezca los torrents que subo, lo que verdaderamente me molesta es que ningun administrador de The piratebay me asigne una calavera de color, despues de haberla pedido varias veces, cuando hay usuarios que la tienen despues de haber subido unos pocos torrents. Yo lo unico que he conseguido es la amenaza de eliminar mi cuenta y mis torrents.

I do not care too much that I thank the people who upload torrents, what really bothers me is that no director of The piratebay I assign a color skull, after having asked several times, when there are users who have after rising few torrents. All I've done is remove the threat of my own and my torrents."
,EACOMPANY,2013-03-30T23:36Z,Entonces geloso no vas a subir mas nada? :/ Que mal!
