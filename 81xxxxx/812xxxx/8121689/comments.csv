[V],seagaia,2013-02-09T18:45Z,"Hi, I'm Sean! I'm one of the two guys who made Anodyne. It's neat that Anodyne's here and I'm glad that means more people can play it, though of course we'd love it if you bought the game! 

We're tryin' to get Greenlit on Steam so we'd really appreciate it if you and your friends gave us an upvote over at http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=92921739 . 

Most importantly let us know what you think of the game and if you like it or if it fills you with a burning rage! - we're on Twitter at @seagaia2 and @jonathankittaka  .

And lastly, here are some Desura codes for Anodyne. You can redeem them at https://secure.desura.com/cart/gifts/activate . Please only use one so others can try Anodyne too!

,BigTwano,2013-02-10T10:26Z,"Don't worry Sean, you got an upvote from me.
It's cool that you tolerate your game being on the bay, not everybody is thinking like you do, it's great  I think. "
,mechagodzilla1,2013-02-11T07:19Z,"Hi Sean,

I was on the fence about buying the game, but you have definitely gotten me on board now. Thanks!"
,m80thebrawler,2013-02-17T18:17Z,is this the demo or the full version?
