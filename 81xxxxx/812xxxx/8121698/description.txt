Information: Programming hotshot Chevy One mans the oscillators in this bass bonanza packed with 46 beefy bass patches for Massive and FM8 and 100 audio loops built for cutting-edge bass-heavy and hybrid electro genres.

S2S always has one foot on the dancefloor to ensure cutting edge releases - and Complextro Bass & Patches is testament to that philosophy.

As the lines between electro house, breaks, dubstep and D&B becomes ever more blurred producers are breaking rules and mashing tools to create hybrid hits such as Wolfgang Gartner's "Undertaker" and Mord Fustang's "Lick The Rainbow".

Characterised by basslines which meld together upto 8 gnarly, futuristic bass tones within one two-bar loop, Complextro Bass & Patches is your ultimate studio weapon.

Fire up one of the 101 ready-rolled 24-bit Wav loops and get instant map-cap complextro bass action or fire up the 46 patches for Native Instruments' Massive and FM8 to create and record your own custom bassline bruisers.

All loops are tempo-synced at 128bpm - making them perfect for all genres where bass really counts: breaks, electro house, dubstep, electro bassline and beyond.
