[T],GaryBradbury2012,2013-02-24T22:14Z,"I'll have to try and get it for you later mate. I am waiting for TOWIE and gonna try to do a WEBRIP of it and post it first. I don't think people would be seeding the ""Let's Dance for Comic Relief"" episode before TOWIE is available."
[T],GaryBradbury2012,2013-02-25T00:39Z,"Hey guys, I am calling it a day with uploading files. My health is not 100% and there are other people already uploading TOWIE. Hopefully they can continue to do so for future episodes as well as MIC. Thanks for all of your support and nice comments over the past couple of years XXXXXXXX"
