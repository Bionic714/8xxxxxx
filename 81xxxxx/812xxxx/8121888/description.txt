TPB AFK: The Pirate Bay Away From Keyboard
Two years in the making, TPB AFK is a documentary about three computer addicts who revolutionized the world of media distribution with their hobby homepage. How did Tiamo, a beer crazy hardware fanatic, Brokep a tree hugging eco activist and Anakata, a paranoid cyber libertarian, get the White House to threaten the Swedish government with trade sanctions? TPB AFK explores what Hollywood's most hated pirates go through on a personal level. This campaign starts exactly one month before the Court of Appeal hearings start in The Pirate Bay trial in Stockholm, Sweden. In 2009 the founders of The Pirate Bay were convicted to 1 year in jail and to pay damages of around 4 million dollars for having 'assisted in making copyrighted content available'. The precedent in the Pirate Bay case will have consequences for the future of the internet. 
Dear Internets! My name is Simon and I am the director/producer of the film, After 5 years of hard work, it's a 
great pleasure to finally upload a torrent about this great website . In a way, I guess TPB AFK has finally come home. This is not just a film about the founders of TPB, but also a film about all of you who use the site. Please convert this film into all possible formats and share it as much as you can! 
Thank you! 							 Your peer, 							 Simon Klose
