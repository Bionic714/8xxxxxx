,michaelrwatson,2013-02-09T20:36Z,"AWFUL movie. Just absolutely awful. Did i mention fuckin awful..? Btw, this is an American space *shuttle* that crashes (intact somehow) outside L.A. and the fake-looking spider (not plural) wreaks a bit of havoc on *one* building in LA. TOTALLY LAME. 

This makes ""Kingdom of the Spiders"" look like a masterpiece."
