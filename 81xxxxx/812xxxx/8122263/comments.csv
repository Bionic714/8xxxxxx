,Maher90,2013-02-09T14:52Z,WAIT..i don't get it..is this an Expansion to Cities XL 2012 or a complete new game? i don't have time to just redownload same game for new stuff! so please someone clarify
[V],HeroMaster,2013-02-09T14:55Z,"@Maher90 It is Completed a New game, Enjoy and help in Seeding!"
,kirtasheks,2013-02-09T15:11Z,"Its a new game, it combines elements of cities XL 2011/2012, but it doesnt have much new content"
,Speedgrapher,2013-02-09T15:41Z,Hope this tides me over until SimCity comes out :D
,rocksbury,2013-02-09T18:07Z,"top notch, low seeders but still getting 1.0Mbps 
I guess il have to live with this as all indications are showing the DRM on simcity will be the tightest yet.
Which doesnt make sense if i was selling a game i wouldnt care if people payed or not simply getting the product into peoples hands is the best marketing."
,Beowolf282,2013-02-09T19:32Z,"When i try opening up the desktop shortcut (windows 8 Btw) it opens up steam and it says i have to buy the game? maybe i don't have the no DVD file in the right place, can anyone help me on this?"

,Saitekman,2013-02-13T04:45Z,"@nupoort699 

Please show your ignorance more. This does work, if you knew anything about how torrents / cracks work you will know that you will get false positives. HeroMaster is a VIP for a reason dipshit."
,Zebra667,2013-02-13T12:07Z,"nupoort699, you are a fucking idiot fool of the HIGHEST order! Go back to playing with the fucking kiddie consoles, because that's all your feeble intelligence will obviously allow! Almost 100% of the time you get a 'trojan' hit and it says 'GenericX.X', it means it's a FALSE POSITIVE! God, if you don't know how to fucking do this shit right, then SHUT THE FUCK UP! We all learned the hard way, no one taught us by holding our hands. YOU need to learn to not spread BULLSHIT panic by claiming viruses when you have no FUCKING IDEA what you're talking about in the first place! The torrent is absolutely FINE and Hero is a stand-up uploader and FAR more respectable than you're noob ass..."
,Zebra667,2013-02-13T12:10Z,"God, when people like nupoort699 do that shit, I just want to grab them and shake the STUPID out of them SO bad! ARGH!"
,Shiivic,2013-02-14T14:46Z,"When I try to install it, I get a message saying ""Runtime error (at-1:0): Cannot Import WIZARDFORM."" and some russian name on top of the message. 

I've  got no idea of what it is other than that. I've tried various things (for example installing/unistalling certain drivers) to see if I could solve it but without success. 

I'd be very happy if anyone shared the solution. I will however try to figure it out and put the solution here in case it occurs for someone else."
,GrecoISU,2013-02-17T15:25Z,"Follow the instructions, works great! Thanks!"
,onlymorais,2013-02-19T02:48Z,"Game works just fine... :-)
Thanks to the uploader... "

Also, I don't believe a new crack is needed for the patches as I extracted the files from the patches and the only exe file is an updated uninstall exe. That and the game.exe is 23MB's and the patches being less than 1MB in size..."
