[V],STFmaryville,2013-02-09T21:13Z,"you're welcome, everyone.

Nightwing1945, i haven't seen those scanned yet -- the latest i can find are caligula #2 and dan #8 -- but i'll keep my eyes open, and i'm sure one of us will post 'em."

I have a request.  Have you seen ""Atomic Robo: Flying She-Devils of the Pacific"" #5 of 5 anywhere?  
Thanks!"
,Nightwing1945,2013-02-11T15:37Z,"Thanks STF, I'll be looking forward to any future scans of those two books, if you ever run across them.

One other request, if possible:  I can't seem to find Brilliant #2 anywhere.  If you happen to have it, I would love an up (re-up?).  Thanks again."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-02-11T20:15Z,"you're both welcome. Nikoli1129, coincidentally, i lived for 25 years in a house numbered 1129! Nikoli1129: http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7901801/ (that one was easy) Nightwing1945: http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/6964371/ (that one wasn't too hard)
