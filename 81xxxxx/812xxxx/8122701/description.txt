Boy, what a tough night. Spent an hour unable to figure ot what I was doing wrong that
the 51 min show was demuxing to only 41 minutes. Rebooted my computer and gave up.
Decided to get the MKV instead and just as it was almost downloaded - saw the MP4
RePack. Well, now you get to sample the other encoding method for this. 640x360 is a
little bigger than 624x352. I think the MP4 sources look a little softer, maybe a hard
edge is just right for this show.
