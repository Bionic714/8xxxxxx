Set in the Clarence Street Clinic, a health centre of Dublin, the Irish drama The Clinic aired on rt√© from 2003 to 2009. This is the first series, with 8 episodes in total.
This is a rip from my own DVD ; for some reason, episodes 7 and 8 are joined, I hope it's ok for everyone. (note : there are no subtitles on the DVD)

Main cast includes : Aisling O'Sullivan, David Wilmot, Lorraine Pilkington, Gary Lydon, Dominic Mafham, Amy Huberman, Norma Sheahan, Gertrude Montgomery, Rachel Pilkington, Chris O'Dowd, Sam Corry, and Geraldine Plunkett.
