,Freem1979,2013-02-09T23:07Z,Wanted to get in contact with you SCSA420 but looks like you can't from here so guess that my loss. Wanted to try and talk a little with you about you rips. You do great work but for some reason all you rips always go out of sync when streaming (and a little warning if you havnt noticed you have a little looser called DX re-encoding your rips and claming them as his own)
