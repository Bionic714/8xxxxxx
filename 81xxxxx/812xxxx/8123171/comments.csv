,PseudoPositive,2013-02-09T22:30Z,"TvTeam seems to be a bot uploader, so little, if any info will be given for each of his torrents, & TvTeam won't be answering our questions; just copy & paste the title to google it, takes just a few seconds.

 I hate when I hit the link and Tvteam Appears. I immediately get the download elsewhere."
