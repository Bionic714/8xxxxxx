@bing52, I've never seen TvTeam answer any questions due to his high upload volumes, & that the TvTeam uploads are automated using a bot program, so you would have more luck getting an answer from a tree; ask another green skull movie uploader for your requets you might get lucky, just FYI."

I hate when I hit the link and Tvteam Appears."
