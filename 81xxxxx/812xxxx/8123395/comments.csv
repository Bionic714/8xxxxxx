,surfanimal69,2013-02-11T18:40Z,Hi Bozx. Thanks for all the years of your effort. Really I've been downloading since 2005 and can't thank you and all the other pirates for sailing such a fantastic journey. I would like to ask you a quick question or 2. First how do I get the original person who has the download aware that I got stuck at say 95% and that I would really like them to put it back so I can finish downloading it. I have dozens of those just sitting there going nowhere. Hahaha actually that is the only important question I have. :-) Thanks for your help.The one I want to finish the most is smallville 82gb stuck at 90.5% and another called dokumentarer 137.29gb stuck at 18.6% (which I can't seem too find on Pirate Bay anymore ) Thanks again :-)

,icydick,2013-02-14T00:04Z,where's English subtitle?
,cool_guy_77,2013-02-14T04:55Z,"Boring movie.

complete waste of bandwidth. :-("
,Misiekki,2013-02-14T21:29Z,is this subtitles hard coded or not ? :-)
,56453ryt,2013-02-18T15:12Z,"This movie is emotionally rich and life affirming.

One of the best films of the year.

Meg Ryan still looks great."
,jackflash,2013-02-19T01:42Z,"Thanks man, you're the best!"

This is the first movie with humans that made me cry apart from Senna. What an excellent movie, if this movie does not touch you then you have no soul."

,sylvianre,2013-02-23T23:10Z,"Movie has Swedish and Thai parts but no subtitles. Not sure why none of these groups add hardcoded subtitles. It makes downloading rips a waste of time. Full DVDs and DVd Screeners always have the hardcoded subs.

Poor release from another lazy group. "
,AdamP88,2013-02-24T01:35Z,"@56453ryt: Meg Ryan isn't in this movie, what are you talking about?

@sylvianre: Hardcoded subtitles are an abomination that duplicates the work for release groups (having to encode multiple copies of every movie) and gives us heaps of torrents for every movie, which will make downloading slower since you will have less seeders/peers per torrent. So stop being so lazy yourself and just download a subtitle file in your preferred language (which will only be a few kilobytes), you whining retard."
,keithhall,2013-02-24T23:36Z,"IMDB states this has multiple languages...

Are there eng subs for the non-eng-parts only (hardcoded or otherwise)?

Hunting down non-eng-only subtitles is next to impossible and not to sound ungrateful but missing the foreign language dialogue is incredibly irritating.  You're missing out on (sometimes important) parts of the movie."
,Ayni.,2013-03-05T04:09Z,"Thanks.
Great quality!"

,4seed2u,2013-05-03T19:51Z,I like 3LI release very much. This one has no subtitles for foreign parts so its waste of time. Quality is not bad.
