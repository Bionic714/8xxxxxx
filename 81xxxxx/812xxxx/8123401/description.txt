Philippe has surrounded himself with talented artists from different backgrounds and different cultures. His music comes to life, the sweet and sour cocktail breaks the boundaries of language and becomes a universal message of brotherhood.

The language used by SLD is designed by Philippe and inspired by various world languages (Arabic, English, French, Hebrew, Spanish, Portuguese, Basque, Hindi etc ...). The grammar is simplified and the aesthetics of the sentences is privileged.
