MKV Container
Direct stream copy of 720p H.264 video stream and AAC audio stream
The FLAC audio from the (slightly modified) lossless download was muxed in and while syncronized as precisely as possible, the original AAC version does play very slightly faster.
The FLAC audio stream length is longer than the video and AAC audio.



Notes:


Collection includes music from the original Portal.
Tagging was researched and given deep thought, but may not conform to any standard, common or otherwise.
ReplayGain values are omitted.
While the inclusion of Larry Stephens' "Offering" was attempted, no lossless source is readily available. While it may be available on AudioSparx along with an unlimited distribution license for $479.80, it is available in lossy formats at iTunes, Amazon and CD Baby. My guess is that there may be a few copies of the "Offering" CD album floating around at CD exchanges in the Colorado area.
