Listening to the newest release by Fredericton, NB based indie rockers Age of Daze, you canΓÇÖt help but wonder how the hell they managed to pack eight - thatΓÇÖs right 8 - killer singles onto one album?! I mean letΓÇÖs be honest, now.a.daze youΓÇÖre lucky if you download a cd with two singles on it ΓÇô but 8? No way! And yet, here it is... 

Hollywood Ending, released in the summer of 2008, is made up of eight skilfully-crafted, unadulterated rock songs, ranging the gamut from passionate ballad to kickass guitar anthem. And yes, the results are in... 10 out of 10 blind listening sessions have concluded ...thereΓÇÖs no @!* way this band is staying indie... In fact, they donΓÇÖt sound indie at all!!

But the one thing that really makes your head spin about this album is the talent behind it, and the focus of the band members. With dig deep, passionate vocals, the power of three rockinΓÇÖ guitars, heavy bass and the craziest @%! drummer relentlessly thrashing his skins (not to mention the sweat flying around on stage) - theyΓÇÖre the real deal. TheyΓÇÖre stoked and theyΓÇÖre in it to win it. Says lead vocalist Tim Morrison, ΓÇ£you gotta go big or go homeΓÇ¥ ΓÇô full stop....and from the sound of things... they ainΓÇÖt goinΓÇÖ home anytime soon!
