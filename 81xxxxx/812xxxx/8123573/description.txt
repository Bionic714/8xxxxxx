Acid Test was a Canadian group fronted by singer and bassist Lucy Di Santo and signed to Sire Records. They were certainly leftfield in terms of pop music. Their music incorporated everything from techno to industrial to house to alt-rock, and of course pure pop runs through it. There is an undeniable groove throughout the album. Such a hodge-podge of styles was certainly not guaranteed to make Acid Test pop stars, but they did manage to get their tracks on a couple soundtracks, and they had considerable hype in the US, which was a huge feat for a Canadian band at the time, especially one fronted by a woman. The hype didn't amount to much, unfortunately, and they broke up. Lucy has since fronted other bands like LEI and Innerstate, so her talent has not been wasted. And the sound that Acid Test created would become more finely honed and widely popular a couple years later thanks to Garbage and the many groups that cloned them.
