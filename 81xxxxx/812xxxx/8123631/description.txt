During the latter days of the power metal revival, there were some Johnny-come-lately types that began filtering their way out of North America, sporting a sound a good bit different from what Europe was. This naturally excludes the likes of Kamelot and Steel Prophet who had roots going back to earlier than 2001 when it suddenly became cool to have a retro sound again. Among the better representatives of this group was a ragtag outfit out of Vancouver called 3 Inches Of Blood, sporting a sound that could be likened to a cryptic mixture of Manowar, King Diamond, and even a latent bit of frosty melodeath meets power metal sound popularized by Children Of Bodom.
