NOTE: I suggest downloading VLC Media Player to watch this release.  You can download it here:
	  
http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html

A few important and simple keyboard shortcuts for VLC are:

Double click: Fullscreen
Spacebar: Play/Pause
V key: Enable/Disable/Change Language of Subtitles.
G/H key: Subtitle Delay (-50ms/+50ms each tap)
J/K key: Audio Delay (-50ms/+50ms each tap)

NOTE: SPANISH subtitles are on by default; simply tap the V key THREE (3) times in VLC Media Player to change them to ENGLISH.  If you would like no subtitles at all, delete the Subtitles folder or Right Click, Subtitle, Disable in VLC.

NOTE: Two samples are included as well as the 6 NFO files.

NOTE: I do not have constant Internet access, so this upload may take a few days.  Please be patient!

NOTE: I am in the process of uploading all the recent BDRips/DVDRips of popular TV shows that are not on TPB.  Considering I do not have fast upload speeds, nor do I have constant Internet access, AND there are pretty much unlimited DVDRips/BDRips to upload, this will take a super long time.  However, let me know if you have a request, and I will see what I can do.

Enjoy; please rate, comment, and seed!
