,kooligan62,2013-02-10T02:57Z,"@ 7117, quit complaining ass-nine!The spoken language is english, just little symbols at the bottom of the screen (hardcoded chinese subs)... I jumped through it real fast, not watching the entire movie, but from what I see...A:7, V:8 Thanks to the UP!!!!"
,Hanna55,2013-02-10T04:02Z,Thanks HUGS
,HE-HAW,2013-02-14T00:47Z,dont know why people complain its not like there asked to pay for the download...!...
,melmelthesailor,2013-02-14T08:50Z,So it stays frozen during a very important scene where a bunch of crazy shit goes down. Like right at the climax. from 1:25-1:30. REAL piss off. i kinda just ignored the chinese subs...
,rhyrhyrhy2012,2013-02-23T06:09Z,"screen froze wtf? anyway the ending left over more answers than solutions, it destroyed the movie it could have been better imho"
,rhyrhyrhy2012,2013-02-23T06:10Z,i meant the ending left more questions than answers sorry about that
,SelfPotato,2013-03-10T15:10Z,"Ah great, so what the fuck happens between 1:25-1:30? The video was poor and audio ok."
