Teorex Inpaint 5.0


Magically Remove Elements From Your Photos!

Inpaint will magically fill the selected area with intelligently-generated
textures pulled from the surrounding image data.



How It Works

Inpaint photo restoration software reconstructs the selected image area from
the pixels near the area boundary. Remove undesirable objects from your images,
such as logos, watermarks, power lines, people, text or any other undesired
artefacts.  There's no need to manually go through messing around with your
old clone tool any more! Now you can use Inpaint to easily remove all those
unexpected objects that end up spoiling an otherwise really great photograph.
