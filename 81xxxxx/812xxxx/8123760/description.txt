WhatΓÇÖs a band to do when their debut album becomes a more-or-less instant classic, the defining rock album held up by critics under the banner "The New Thing"? In the case of The Dream Syndicate, after touring extensively, they underwent a lineup change and went back into the studio in 1984 for a far more extended stay than for The Days of Wine and Roses, which they recorded in just three days. Bassist Kendra Smith had departed, to be replaced by Al Green sideman Dave Provost, but the biggest change was the selection of producer Sandy Pearlman, best known for his work with Blue Oyster Cult.

By all accounts, Pearlman was an intensely tough taskmaster, and the band was in the studio seven days a week, twelve-plus hours each day, playing and perfecting the new songs that leader/singer Steve Wynn had written after finishing the tour. Of the eight songs on Medicine Show, six were written by Wynn, one by lead guitarist Karl Precoda, and the lengthy jam "John Coltrane Studio Blues" is credited to the full quartet.

ItΓÇÖs remarkable that, given the length of time spent honing and recording, the album didnΓÇÖt have all of the rough edges sanded down ΓÇö itΓÇÖs still a rough-and-tumble experience, with a more aggressive tone than their debut. Wine and Roses has plenty of sharp points on it, but has an overall hazy quality thatΓÇÖs absent here. WynnΓÇÖs quoted as saying that he tried to adopt a "fearless" attitude for Medicine Show, and the straightforward, often angry tone conveys that going-for-it feeling.
