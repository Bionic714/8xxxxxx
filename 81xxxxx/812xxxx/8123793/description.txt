Though it has almost no visibility in today's commercial media world, the new folk scene continues to flourish with many outstanding singer-songwriters plying their trade. It's almost an overabundance of first-rate folkies with good original songs and an appealing performing style. So it takes something special to stand out. More often than not, fans will discover an artist through live their performances, rather than any media exposure outside of some eclectic public radio stations.
Antje Duvekot is a native of Heidelburg, Germany. Her family fell apart when she was 13, separated from her father and brother. She ended up in Delaware, a teenaged girl thrust into a new culture, not speaking English at first, and separated from the things she grew up with. It's an experience that has colored a number of her songs over the years. She attended the University of Delaware and lived in New York for a short time, and then Vermont before settling in the Boston area where she is currently based. She cites some of the classic folk artists as key influences, such as Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, Paul Simon and Leonard Cohen.

Ms. Duvekot soon began to attract attention from a number of significant artists, including Seamus Egan of the band Solas, who produced her debut album Big Dream Boulevard. Her second release, issued in 2009, The Near Demise of the High Wire Dancer was produced by another significant figure on the contemporary folk scene, Richard Shindell, who also did the same duties on the new recording New Siberia.
