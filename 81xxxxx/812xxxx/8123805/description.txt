This is what Simon Klose  director/producer of the film TPB AFK says about this torrent the documentary.......
    							     
   Dear Internets!                                                                         
   My name is Simon and I am the director/producer of the film TPB AFK:  
   The  Away From Keyboard. After 5 years of hard work, it's a
   great pleasure to finally upload a torrent about this great website 
   onto the site itself. In a way, I guess TPB AFK has finally come home. 
   This is not just a film about the founders of TPB, but also a film 
   about all of you who use the site. Please convert this film into all 
   possible formats and share it as much as you can!          		   
                                                                             
   English subtitles are embedded into the movie.         		      
   I've also made two folders with .srt and .sub subtitles.                  
   Feel free to translate them into whatever language you know!              
   Will there be a hindi, japanese, swahili or a 1337 sp33k subtitle?        
                                                                             
    Thank you!         							      
                                                                            
   your peer,
