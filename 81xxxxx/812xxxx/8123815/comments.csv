,bordo84,2013-02-11T19:02Z,am i the only one who sees tearing in the beginning of the movie? the rest is fine
,kashaf,2013-02-12T02:55Z,"hey guys i wanna ask something, i have 27 in' LED 1080p HD but when i watch any movie of 1080p or we can say BOZX my picture quality is not that clear as there should be in any 1080p movie.... i mean i can see the pixels i hope anybody out there help me... thnx "
,bordo84,2013-02-12T11:17Z,really bad rip in the beginning of the movie is 160 000 kbps bitrate that causes tearing in image for like 10 seconds and then there are some spots where is only 6 kbps bitrate...when you play either on pc or bluray that spot with 160 000 kbps will not play without tearing simply because of such a high bitrate...same error was with rip of Prometheus back then
