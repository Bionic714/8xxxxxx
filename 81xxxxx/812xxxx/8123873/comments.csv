,bob7magic,2013-02-10T18:04Z,This is a fantastic album. You can clearly hear the influence of A Guy Called Gerald on the songs. It's no surprise that Richard James was influenced by it. I suspect that A Guy Called Gerald left the band because the others wanted to go in a more pop musical direction. It all worked out since he created some awesome tracks in his solo work. And it let the rest of 808 State make albums like ex:el (still one of my favorite albums by them).
