This is the first release by 808 State, and has much more of an "acid house" vibe to it than their later albums - it is among my favorite acid house albums, and is also a favorite of Aphex Twin - he cites it as one of his influences, which is why he grabbed up the rights to reissue under his Rephlex label. If you love minimal acid house and the TB-303. grab this album!
