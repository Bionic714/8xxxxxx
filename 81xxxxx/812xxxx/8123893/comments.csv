,bobert-bobert,2013-02-17T03:43Z,"Are you people fucking illiterate??  Who the hell complains about having to read subtitles?

""Oh it's too much work, sitting here on my ass watching a movie, and having to READ WORDS. Ohhhhhhhh whine bitch complain etc....""

STFU.  Seriously.   You lazy pieces of human refuse. 

Thanks condrs369, for sharing the film with us!"
,tpboss,2013-02-19T04:03Z,A little shady that the uploader won't show what the text looks like in his screenshots. Not downloading till a more reliable rip comes out.
,ryballs,2013-02-20T13:51Z,"Some parts are english and some are even french but mostly chinese. Great movie for the stunts chan does even at his age.. Not so much for the storyline. Good video and audio quality.

PS: Stop whinging."

,clonedfetus777,2013-02-21T10:28Z,"wow this is some racist shit, but more than anything its just plan ass stupid

,canopener,2013-02-23T18:36Z,"Jackie Chan is a douchebag.

The US citizens make him rich and he goes around china talking garbage about our country, our citizens, and our way of life. Yeah, china is so much better... (rolls eyes) He should move to china.

F&%k him and his traitard ugly flat face. No jackie chan movies ever again.
