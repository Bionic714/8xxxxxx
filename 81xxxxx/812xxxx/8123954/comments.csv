,Azex88,2013-02-09T23:09Z,oh look Greg 'bland' Land. what a peice of shit artist. was thinking of jumping on iron man but thanks to land i wont even steal this book.
,wawsxxwa,2013-02-10T04:10Z,"based on this comic he seems to be pretty decent. why don't you like him, azex? "
,Azex88,2013-02-10T21:35Z,"@wawsxxwa All of his faces and poses look exactly the same. its like he photoshops photos of real people and just uses a filter to make them look drawn. Look at any of his uncanny x-men, ultimate line, or phoenix endsong/warsong work. its all the same. its all bland. I want something unique and special like Bachelo or Ramos"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-02-11T01:33Z,"man i agree totally that land isn't a top talent. and it's well documented that he cribs off photographs, which is pathetic.

but to play a little devil's advocate, gillen and land have gotten out 6 issues in 14 weeks ... and icv2 says the first 4 each sold 50k+ ...

honestly if greg land's producing 7-8 pages per week, i think this job's probably his for as long as he wants. marvel wants product (new trades) out there in time for the next movie in may."
,degu2012,2013-03-06T18:35Z,as long as it isn't rob liefeld then i really don't care who the artist is.
