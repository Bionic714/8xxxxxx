A note on the volume number.  The Invincible Iron Man (1-33, 500-527) (2008-2012) is sometimes listed as Iron Man v5, so depending on the the source you are using, this could be Iron Man v5 or v6.  Comixology calls the Marvel NOW! series v5 which is a continuation from The Invincible Iron Man.

Tony Stark. In Space. In a bar. With ladies. What could go wrong? But is Tony guilty of a crime he's not even aware of? A shocking start to an all-new, all-different direction for IRON MAN.

Thanks goes to Re-em for this release.
