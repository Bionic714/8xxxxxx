,davis423,2013-02-12T08:29Z,"I watched a few episodes and have to thank you for your upload. Video and audio are both 10's and look awesome on my big screen led tv. 

Its great having this now I can finish the rest of the anime in English, I have watched it in Japanese but the English VA is so good and done well enough it is totally worth watching twice to check both out."
,fLIckmeplease,2013-02-19T20:08Z,"The quality of this torrent is amazing, but don't expect it to ever work on a PS3, even after changing the container format.   If you want these rips to work on a PS3, you have to actually recode every single one of them, which sucks. The best I have been able to get out of these (on a PS3) without a recode is sound but no video.  

It seems some codecs don't like these files either, as some players will play the video, while some will not (same PC).  

TL;DR - The quality is great, but the format isn't very compatible with players. "
,moaradin,2013-02-21T05:02Z,I recommend using VLC.
,Avitus27,2013-02-22T00:55Z,"@fLIckmeplease: Most people stream to PS3 with PS3 Media Server

As for the torrent, I'm downloading now. I can't wait to see it again >w"
,smokey8,2013-02-26T09:31Z,Great upload. great quality video and audio. Not sure what some people are saying about it not working. Just open with VLC and it works beautifully. 
,narukami4,2013-03-01T06:06Z,"Hey guys, I was hoping that I could get some assistance from torrent veterans. I just made my first torrent at http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8205662/Persona_Music_2012_Live_on_Mayonaka_TV_(concert_album).
For some reason, when I search for it, it doesn't show up unless I search under ""Audio: other."" Do you guys have any tips for me?"
,coqkilla,2013-03-05T03:35Z,"Umm I simply used Handbrake to convert the files to mp4 and it worked FLAWLESSLY on my PS3. So don't listen to comments that say otherwise.

Thank you so much for this torrent, moaradin! Brilliant. "
