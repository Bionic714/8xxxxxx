SPORT: Six Nations Rugby Union - Scotland v Italy
On: BBC 1 HD 
Date: Saturday 9th February 2013 
KO Time: 14:30 

Coverage from Edinburgh, where Scotland host Italy in the second weekend of the 2013 Six Nations. In recent years, these two teams have battled it out to avoid the dreaded wooden spoon, given to the team that finishes last in the tournament. Murrayfield is the only away ground where Italy have enjoyed a Six Nations victory, so no doubt they will be looking to draw on that famous 37-17 victory six years ago. But having lost four of their last six matches against the Azzurri in the Six Nations, Scotland will be determined not to suffer another upset on home soil. Match commentary comes from Alastair Eykyn and Lawrence Dallaglio.
