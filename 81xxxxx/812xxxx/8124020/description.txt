RE-RIP Notes:                                                   
                                                                
Yes Your Memory Is Correct, We Have Released This Game Before.  
Its One Of Those Games We Keep Comeing Back To When Were Bored  
As We Like It That Much. We Added Our New Compression Methods   
And Made The Rip 1/2 The Size Of Our Previos One. Enjoy :)      
                                                                
                                                                
Notes:                                                          
                                                                
We Recommend Installing To A Short Path (Like The Install.exe   
Default) As Long Path Names Can Cause Missing Files On Certain  
Games During Rebuild.                                           
Unless You Changed It The Default Extraction Folder Install.exe 
Creates Is C:/Games/                                            
This Is Were You Can Find The Games exe.                        
If Install/Rebuild Seems To Freeze Leave It Alone.              
Install/Rebuild Is Normally Very Time/Space Consuming.          
(So Ensure You Have Pleanty Of Space And Patience)
