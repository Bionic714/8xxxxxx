,BlaTaN,2013-02-10T00:39Z,"after all these years,  u would think shows could be uploaded uncropped, and half decent quality instead of shit .avi files with a lack of care when ripping.

Sure C_P, you're good at getting these out a.s.a.p but sometimes it isnt worth watching decent animation when the quality of the rip is under par ....  why on earth we have 1080p /720 p cartoons AIRED LIKE THAT, but then ripped into shit.  "
,TNBG,2013-02-10T01:41Z,Oh stuff it you ungrateful little shit.  Why don't upload them yourself then?
,Majty,2013-02-10T02:09Z,I grew up with VHS so I dont find anything wrong with the quality at all?

Along with Young Justice, this show has been cancelled so pricks like you wont have anything to complain about in a couple of weeks."
