You know itΓÇÖs not a particularly strong time for Southern rock when its most famous current purveyor is a former rapper from Detroit. Kid Rock longs to be the genreΓÇÖs flag-bearer, but when he flies the stars and bars, itΓÇÖs with an incredibly heavy-handed sense of pandering. Rock sampled ΓÇ£Sweet Home AlabamaΓÇ¥ for his 2008 hit ΓÇ£All Summer Long.ΓÇ¥

Blackberry Smoke is a band that can reclaim Southern rock for the South. The Georgia quintet is the right mixture of long hair, short fuse, gritty realism and country charm, with songs that split the difference between rollicking boogie and introspective balladry. The bandΓÇÖs third album, ΓÇ£The Whippoorwill,ΓÇ¥ contains enough signifiers to let listeners know this is a down-home Dixie affair but easily escapes self-parody.

Opening track ΓÇ£Six Ways to SundayΓÇ¥ announces itself with what sounds like a not-so-lost Skynyrd guitar lick and, along with ΓÇ£Everybody Knows SheΓÇÖs Mine,ΓÇ¥ is an ode to pleasures below the personal Mason-Dixon line. ΓÇ£She gets me higher than a Georgia pine. .ΓÇë.ΓÇë. She got my name tattooed where the sun donΓÇÖt shine,ΓÇ¥ frontman Charlie Starr offers on the latter. The hard-chugging ΓÇ£Leave a ScarΓÇ¥ flirts with good-old-boy cliche (ΓÇ£Told me about the good Lord and when to use a gunΓÇë/ Made me very proud of where it is that I come fromΓÇ¥), but well-placed organ blasts and banjo plucks on top of the double-guitar attack keep up the momentum.

ItΓÇÖs StarrΓÇÖs small-town portraits that offer the most poignant and effective moments. ΓÇ£One Horse TownΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£AinΓÇÖt Much Left of MeΓÇ¥ feature protagonists coming to terms with the decisions theyΓÇÖve made (ΓÇ£IΓÇÖm an old married man at the age of 23ΓÇë/ Got two little boys on the baseball teamΓÇ¥) without any tidy solutions or happy endings. ItΓÇÖs a reflection of reality that resonates.
