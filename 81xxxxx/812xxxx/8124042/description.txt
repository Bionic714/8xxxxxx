The southern United States have their own culture, mythology and traditions. It is manifestly a different place than the rest of the continental USA. Murry is completely immersed in the Southern aesthetic (even William Faulkner himself makes a posthumous guest appearance), the ghost of Mark Linkous haunts the songs and the Mississippi flows through them.
When you get so entrenched in the mythology you lose sight of reference points and it can become difficult for an audience not steeped in the same tradition to follow. ‘Little Coloured Balloons’ makes the same error as Josh Pearson’s last record; it asks us to follow it blindly for nine minutes without offering a reward for doing so.
