- Release Notes ------------------------------------------------------------- -

  Like many passionate songsters before him, Jerod McBrayer listened to
  Jimmy Eat WorldΓÇÖs Bleed American and it changed his life. His heart pounded,
  his veins pumped what felt like strawberry syrup, and his body felt like he
  was in one of those dreams where you try to run but your legs move like
  marshmallows. He loved it and wanted to create it.
