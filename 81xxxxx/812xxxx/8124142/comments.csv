For you guys or gals who are downloading this please take the time to seed back after download.  "

Does anyone know if there's anything in this film that we haven't already seen in SW TCW?"
,DeborahADoe,2013-02-11T01:53Z,"Amazon describes it as a ""full length Director's Cut."" And one of the reviewers said, ""The episodes don't play in the same order they aired. In fact, this is very much an edited directors cut with portions of some episodes played out of order. ... It frames the entire four episodes around the search for Maul. ... There isn't any new material so much as I could tell, but the editing is different enough to make worth watching at least once if you're a fan of the show."""
