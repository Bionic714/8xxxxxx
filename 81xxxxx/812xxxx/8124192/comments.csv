,Synthesist,2013-02-10T11:08Z,#2 appears to be missing a page after page (count) 11.
,Jebeker,2013-02-10T21:46Z,"Issue #2 does, indeed, seem to be missing at least one page there but, unfortunately I no longer have a paper copy of that book and I checked it with the original scan by OTK via Cybertronium and that's all there is. 

Maybe if someone else has the missing page or pages they could post a link?"
