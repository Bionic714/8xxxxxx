KMSNano is an Offline KMS Activator that emulates a KMS server in the memory of
your computer and sends activation data back and forth attempting to activate
volume versions of Windows and Office. I have personally activated KMSNano without
having my lan drivers even installed on a fresh install of Windows 7.

There are other earlier versions that may or may not work currently.
You should always check for the latest version before using.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Activates:
Windows Vista Business/Enterprise Default/N/VL
Windows 7 Pro/Enterprise Default/N/VL
Windows 8 Pro/Enterprise Default/N/VL
Windows Server Std/Data 2008/2008R2/2012
Office/OfficeVL 2010/2013.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------Please read this non-KMS Windows versions list-------
Retail-Only Versions of windows that will **NOT** activate are:
Vista Starter/Homebasic/Homepremium/Ultimate - Default/N/E
7 Starter/Homebasic/Homepremium/Ultimate - Default/N/E
8 core/coreN/ProWMC
----------Again, those versions will NEVER activate with KMS---
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Requirements: . NET 4.0 or Windows 8

Instructions:

1. Extract the rar file to a directory.
2. Run KMSnano.exe It will install to a folder, add shortcuts,
and trigger install. This checks activation when you log on and will
Run the Activator if 30 days or left are less on activation
3. Wait about 45-60secs for an initial activation if you aren't activated
(It takes longer for Retail to VL Office 2013 conversion)
(You will hear sound on the first install if it runs activator)
4. Done. Run the "Check KMSnano" link on start menu to verify your activation.

For Windows 8, it can take a minute or two of doing system things for the
watermark to go away. You don't need to reboot. Activators that require
a reboot are hacks and you should immediately run a "SFC /SCANNOW" if
you have used one. (SFC is the System File Checker) Esp. KJ Hacktivator
You CAN reboot if you want to, it's just not necessary for activation.

Note that Pre-Release versions of Office or Windows will NEVER activate.
You can try the UpDown8 v1.3.exe tool if you have a version that is
unsupported like enterprise trial version, but you use at your own risk.
(Download it somewhere else, Installing a legit volume version is recommended)

Why use this program over any other activation method?
-It does not modify any of your system files.
-Because it's not a crack or a hack.
-Because it's the only way to get legit activation without using legit servers.
-Did I mention it activates ALL KMS activation software?

Change Log:
- Setup Better Encrypted.
- Sound effects (thanks to masterblaster666)

All is Done (for now).

heldigard's note: Important!: You dont need download it, use it, shared it,
publish it,  picture it, sing it, even see it; proceed only in your own super
secure  risk.
(murphy78's note: He means use/share it at your own risk, don't be a douche)

Recommendations:

- Disable SmartScreen.
- Disable microsoft security updates.
- Make exceptions to c:_program files_KMSnano in Antivirus.
(murphy-says: Either allow kmsnano files through antivirus protection,
or disable defender and anti-virus updates until (if possible) obfuscation
protection of the file)

Included is KMSnano Documentation v15-US.pdf Please read this first if you have
any problems. Currently "Silent.cmd" replaces functionality of old "kmsnano.exe"
When you run the activator by installing or running "silent.cmd" you will
generate "kmsnano.log" in your Kmsnano folder. You may want this if you need
to relay some info on the MDL boards about an unsupported language or something.

heldigard added a supersilent.cmd that the runtrigger.cmd will install
This is a shortcut for after you install. Go into the program fileskmsnano
and run the runtrigger.cmd to change to the version with no sound effects.
supersilent.cmd is the same as silent.cmd except that it won't play sound effects

If you bug anyone at MDL, bug me before heldigard please. He has enough on his
plate. I, or many others in the setup and charge thread can help you just fine.

(Big Salute to heldigard and all the peeps who contributed to this project)
Personal comment to heldigard: Nice damn job on the installer oneclick!
