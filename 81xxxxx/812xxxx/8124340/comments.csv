,Sandix800,2013-02-19T13:30Z,"Yeah that option is also available dude. You can make your copy of Norton product as a retail edition that sets its trial period to 90 days. In order to do that,open up your norton security product and just turn off the norton tamper protection in the settings and then close norton and then in start run dialog box type ""msconfig"" and hit enter to open msconfig and go to boot option in it and check safe boot option and close msconfig.Now restart computer and when computer starts double click open your NTR_2013 trial reset and then click Convert/Reset option that's it,your Norton product will be converted into a retail version with 90 days of evaluation period and when you restart your computer again in normal mode,just don't forget to turn on the Norton Tamper Setting  on again. Enjoy!!"
