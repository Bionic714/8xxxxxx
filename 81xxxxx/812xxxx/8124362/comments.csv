""E:DownloadsWindows Picture and Fax Viewer for Windows 7.7z: CRC failed in Readme.txt. The file is corrupt"""
,kodan50,2013-04-06T03:44Z,"Yay! This worked beautifully! I am not sure why Microsoft choose not to use this, but I agree: If it ain't broken, don't fix it!

@El__Jefe
Update (or use) 7-Zip before extracting the files.
Check the archive password you entered.
Redownload the torrent and the archive. Repeat."

,Deryl33,2013-05-19T16:06Z,"@ El_Jef: The CRC error usually occurs when the password is typed incorrectly

@ kodan50 & bktheman: glad you like it

@ suiCider: I password protect all my stuff; it's a force of habit i guess. Still gonna do it tho..."
