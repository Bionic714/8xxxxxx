Hi all

If you were as pissed off as i was about Microsoft removing the Windows Picture and Fax Viewer and replacing it with that Windows Photo Viewer kak, then this is for you.

Anyway, enough of my ranting, here's the important part.

I will make one for Windows Vista soon and post the link in the comments.

it is zipped by 7-Zip format so download it if you haven't already got it.(don't ask for a link, remember, Google is your friend)

All credit goes to Dr Anonymous for discovering this.
