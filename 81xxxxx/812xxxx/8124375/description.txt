Hi all

If you were as pissed off as i was about Microsoft removing the Windows Picture and Fax Viewer and replacing it with that Windows Photo Viewer kak, then this is for you.

Personally I HATE Windows Photo Viewer and replacing Windows Picture and Fax Viewer was uncalled for. If its NOT broken, DON'T fix it.

Anyway, enough of my ranting, here's the important part.


************** THIS ONLY WORKS FOR WINDOWS VISTA!!!!! (all versions) ****************

For Windows 7 go to:

it is zipped by 7-Zip format so download it if you haven't already got it.(don't ask for a link, remember, Google is your friend)

Read the Readme file for the instructions. Its pretty straightforward but if you have any questions, you can ask them in the comments below. 

All credit goes to Dr Anonymous for discovering this.

Thank You's would be appreciated
