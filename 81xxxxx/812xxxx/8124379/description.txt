Broken X Disk Manager Professional

Broken X Disk Manager is a Shareware disk catalog for managing and archiving disks of any kind (CDs, DVDs, floppies, Zip disks, USB sticks, network shares, ΓÇª) under Microsoft Windows XP/2003/Vista/7/8, incl. x64 Editions. It's fully Unicode capable. The content of cataloged disks is saved to compact database files, which can also be stored on network shares. The program uses its own optimized database engine. No other programs or software modules are required. 

To get a better overview over your disk catalog, you can sort the disks into folders and you can assign user-defined categories to items. To search for files, the program offers search options like date, size etc. And you can restrict the search to specific categories. Of course, the search function does support wildcards as well. Broken X Disk Manager can automatically generate a description for some file types. For instance for MP3, WMA and OGG files. The artist and title names of Audio CDs can be queried over the Internet from the freedb CD database, or be read from the CD Text information of the CD. The program can catalog the Audio CDs stored in cdplayer.ini without inserting the discs.

Beside the description, you can also set so-called "Extra Information" for each and every item in your disk catalog. These Extra Information include data like Author, Source, Location, Title or Comment. You can even define up to 32 own Extra Information types to manage your files the way you want it. You can of course search in the Extra Information, too.

Broken X Disk Manager supports 7-ZIP, ACE, ARJ, CAB, JAR, RAR, TAR and ZIP archives, it can read the packed directory structure and search in it, too. Archive files can be viewed like folders. You can create user-definable listings of items in the database which can you then print or export to XML, text and CSV files. This applies as well to search results.
