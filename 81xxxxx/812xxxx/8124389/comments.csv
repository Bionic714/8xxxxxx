If the scene choose to use .rar between themselves... than thats fine. The pros of using rar are negible on public trackers. Im going as far as to say .rar on public sites encourage people to stop seeding after they have grabbed the file.
.rar was better when people had crappy conections and files got corrupt because of it. People today have improved their connection since the 54k era and shouldnt have any problem with a 700mb file."
