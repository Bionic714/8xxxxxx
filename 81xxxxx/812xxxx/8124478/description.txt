December 15, 1999 - New York, NY - nine inch nails have announced that their
first-ever concert television special will air exclusively on MTV on Tuesday,
December 21st at 11:00pm (ET/PT). The 30-minute television event will provide
fans with the first televised peek at the band's sold-out, critically lauded
European "Fragility" tour.

In reviewing nine inch nails' London show, Melody Maker stated, "Pretty great
machine...there's no one who uses the word fuck quite like Trent Reznor...
Reznor is a law unto himself...Reznor has the mystique of a dark angel, a 
presence that permeates every awe-filled onlooker." In Milan, La Republica 
stated, "hard, intense, visionary music...nine inch nails have literally driven
to collective exaltation the people gathered at The Alcatraz in Milan...it was
the hardest and most fascinating rock show of the year."

The footage for the special has been culled from shows in Barcelona, Milan,
Munich, Vienna, Berlin, Copenhagen, Paris, Dusseldorf, Tilburg and London, 
and was shot by both fans - picked randomly from the crowd - and 
professional cameramen.

The MTV special was a way to document the first of I hope many legs of
the 'fragility' tour. The size of venues, the choice of music, the scale
and approach to production of those shows will most likely not be reproduced
EVER with the exception of possibly Japan. I was pleasantly surprised at 
the reaction and felt the need to somehow fill everybody else in 
on what happened. 

Technical notes: all the video was filmed by friends and fans on 
consumer level DV. The audio was mixed in a studio, but not 'fixed' or 
re-recorded as is so often so. 

What you see is close to what it was - close but not the same.

The Channel V footage aired on March 4th & 5th, 2000 and were filmed at 
the Big Day Out in Sydney, Australia. "We know that some of the sets didn't go
for as long as y'all would have liked, but I'm afraid our hands were tied in 
that instance. Some bands simply said 'No' to allowing us to 
film certain songs"

This release is available as a DVD image with uncompressed audio, deinterlaced
MP4 files for each concert, 320kbps MP3s of each of the tracks, and two FLAC
files of the audio, completely unprocessed, as ripped from the BetacamSP tapes.
There is no HD version of this footage, as it was shot on consumer-grade
digital video cameras.
