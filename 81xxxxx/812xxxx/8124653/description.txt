Robert Stigwood presents Times Square,1980, starring Tim Curry, Trini Alvarado and Robin Johnson, with lots of songs by various groups. Also, checkout the soundtrack of  Times Square, on thepiratebay .se   in Flac (That's Fully Lossless Audio Codec.) I got the movie in 9 files, including VIDEO_TS,4.3gigs... and converted it to an .avi file, 879mb. 

I had a very small bit part in the movie, written in part by my friend and Arica cohort, Jacob Brackman. I was quite stoned at the time, but not on pot. Hey, it was a long time ago!
