,lordvo1demort12,2013-02-10T09:25Z,saw the movie .. its a brilliant film but a little slow .. also the acting is outstanding by everyone . one of the most under-rated movies loved it 9.6/10

,sumanml07,2013-02-12T15:21Z,"this version is of only 137 mins. whereas in the info it is mentioned 144mins.  THE UNCUT version is of 144mins., so it seems dat this is the CUT version"

,susulock,2013-02-20T15:53Z,Runtime is 2:17:30 NOT 144 MINS as YIFY says.
,susulock,2013-02-20T15:59Z,"It is possible that this upload is missing certain sections of the movie.

I DID NOT SEE THIS SCENE IN YIFY'S VERSION OF THE MOVIE.

JUST TYPE ""The Master - Was There A Fight? "" on youtube and watch the video by ""AlRosePromotions"""
