The above link is either a legit virus that will ransack your PC or you have to pay to view the movie that you can get off this page for free.  I encourage you to spread the word by locating any other links similar in nature to this and warn other here on The Pirate Bay to not click them.  moderators will likely remove the above post when they see it, but they are overwhelmed so we must exercise a little understanding."

,oldcarman,2013-02-11T02:12Z,"Poor cam, audio and video about a 5   looks like a half decent movie though.    I watched about a half and couldn't watch any more....."
,Aboo17,2013-02-11T03:44Z,does anybody know how to get the covers
,stitche5,2013-02-11T04:10Z,"so bullet to the head is already on here but can any one explain to me why a year old movie ""the guilt trip"" is no where to be found????"
,stitche5,2013-02-11T04:12Z,"where is ""the guilt trip"" that movie has been out for a year and no one has it???????"
,some-young-guy,2013-02-11T23:43Z,"@ Stitche5, that is exactly the case, The Guilt Trip is not on this (or any other) site  If paying the $11 to go see it is out of the question, perhaps contacting the Better Business Bureau and explain to them your lack of satisfaction with availability of titles on The Pirate Bay and they will explain what is the next step of recourse you may have."

,Pdid,2013-02-12T00:03Z,"The Guilt Trip was released 12-19-12, no where near a year old. And it looks shitty. And Barbara Streisand is in it. "
,mulukku1,2013-02-13T15:28Z,A bullet in the head is propably better than watching this.
,alf_hooker,2013-02-13T21:58Z,"thanks uploader for your effort, but this is shite and unwatchable in my opinion, do yourselves a favour and wait for a better copy"
