of the 70s""?

The CD did not come out in large numbers until 1985.  I was a full time DJ in the 1970's and by the end of 1979 not one single person owned a CD player as they had not been developed by then.   I think you intended to say by the end of the 80's."
,rigmar_radio,2013-02-10T09:01Z,"Even by the end of the 1980's DJ's may of dropped Albums for CD formats but the Single still had its place as CD Singles did not really take off until the mid 1990's, so there you go.

,rigmar_radio,2013-02-10T09:07Z,"I was born in 1949.  What really annoys me about modern TV is the amount of wrong information broadcast about an era I grew up in and remember very well.  IF TV do History, the least they could do is get there facts correct.   I never missed the Album, there bulk and ease of which they could be warped in the heat of a Disco Van, or destroyed by a spring loaded dance floor or heavy DJ cue session.

I never missed the miss cue, or the magnetic cartridge feedback or needle foldover in the middle of a show or the scratches and other nasties which was record playback then.   Long live digital music."

There weren't many CD's available, my first one was Pat Metheny ""Off Ramp""
It's nice to have crackle and pop free music."
