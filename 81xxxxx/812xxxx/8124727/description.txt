Between the mid 1960s and the late 1970s, the long-playing record and the
albums that graced its grooves changed popular music for ever. For the
first time, musicians could escape the confines of the three-minute pop
single and express themselves as never before across the expanded artistic
canvas of the album. The LP allowed popular music become an art form - from
the glorious artwork adorning gatefold sleeves, to the ideas and concepts
that bound the songs together, to the unforgettable music itself.

Built on stratospheric sales of albums, these were the years when the
music industry exploded to become bigger than Hollywood. From pop to rock,
from country to soul, from jazz to punk, all of music embraced what
'the album' could offer. But with the collapse of vinyl sales at the end
of the 70s and the arrival of new technologies and formats, the golden era
of the album couldn't last forever.

With contributions from Roger Taylor, Ray Manzarek, Noel Gallagher, Guy
Garvey, Nile Rodgers, Grace Slick, Mike Oldfield, Slash and a host of
others, this is the story of When Albums Ruled the World
