Visualize to understand scientific data
Avizo is a versatile and flexible application framework providing powerful 3D visualization capabilities that help you more efficiently understand the meaning of scientific data.
For researchers and scientists, Avizo delivers advanced visualization techniques that allow you to gain detailed insight into your 3D data.
Import and explore
Import 2D / 3D images and 3D data seamlessly, including time series.
Instantly visualize volumes, reconstruct 3D geometries.
Display single or multiple datasets in a single or multiple viewer windows, and navigate freely around or through these objects.
Manipulate and simulate
Simple and efficient 3D image manipulation is possible through a variety of digital filters, editors, and data processing modules.
Integrate complex calculus using Matlab┬« software from The Mathworks, Inc. by means of the Calculus Matlab module. Connect to your Matlab server from your Avizo session and execute Matlab computations directly on your Avizo data. Import and export Matlab matrices to and from Avizo, and export Avizo surfaces to Matlab surfaces.
Present and communicate
Create high-quality presentations, animations, automated scripts.
Generate mono/stereo movies to display on VR systems.
Use 2D/3D export capabilities to share your project.
