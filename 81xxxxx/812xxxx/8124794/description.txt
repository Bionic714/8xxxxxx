Each pack has 75 chaps(p3 151-218 for obvious reasons)
Extra pack - Covers and "cool/funny/whatever" pics from the manga and some pics i've found, so dont look at it unless you have read the entire manga or wants to see the fanart and the covers(do as you please, im not a cop)

Chapters were saved as i was reading the Manga, so there's a remote "possiblity" of missing pages in the chap, although i've checked it.
Average lenght is 17~19 pages per chapter.
If Possible acquire the original work of Wakaki Tamiki
