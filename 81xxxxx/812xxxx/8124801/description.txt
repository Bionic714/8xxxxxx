Take a trip back, before Dragon Age, Mass Effect, and SW:ToR to check out BioWare's first publication from 1996, Shattered Steel. Call it a MechWarrior clone, but some people like myself find this game in a league of it's own. I'm uploading this because it was a childhood favorite, and I could never find a torrent for it anywhere else. So my purchase from GoG.com is yours to enjoy as well :)
