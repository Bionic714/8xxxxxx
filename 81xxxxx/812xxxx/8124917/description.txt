Amanda returns as David Lapham unleashes a punishing tale of misery at the hands of the giddily maniacal menace joined by stunning new artist Miguel Garrido! Fan favorite Crossed Psychopath survivor Amanda lost more than her hand when she escaped from Lorre...she lost her sanity. But she's found that it takes a lunatic to survive in a Crossed world. Artist Garrido delivers a vision of grueling horror that will shake you to the core as he and Lapham kick-off the four issue story "Livers."
