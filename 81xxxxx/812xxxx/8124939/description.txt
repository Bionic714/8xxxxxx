Zombies Tales Primrose Court -3 novels

Also included is a few novels by David Bachman , 5 to be exact; The Darkest Colors Trilogy, Belladona, and Little Miss Mute. These are novels tough to add to a genre seeing it is in space and have vampires and guts and gore. So I class them as Horror-Sci-Fi, enjoy.
Here is a pack that has it all; Boogeymen,Werewolves,Vampires,Sasquatches,Demons,Zombies,Ghouls,Clowns and tons of other things that go bump in the night.......and day. 64 books for your reading pleasure, some are short stories and some are epic big books that will take a few days to finish. These are all from 2008 to 2012. Seed and enjoy this horror pack from zombiRG!
