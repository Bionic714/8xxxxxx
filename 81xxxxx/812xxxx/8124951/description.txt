On: BBC 1 HD
Date: Saturday 9th February 2013 
KO Time: 17:00

Live coverage from Paris, where France are hosting Wales. This clash promises to be one of the highlights of this year's Championship, with last year's Grand Slam winners Wales taking on this year's pre-tournament favourites France. Les Bleus had an excellent autumn campaign but are renowned for their inconsistency, while Wales have had 12 months to forget since their triumph last year. Andrew Cotter and Jonathan Davies are in the commentary box.
