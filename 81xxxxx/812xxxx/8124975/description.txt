Amanda survives by keeping the uninfected at a distance even when they are within reach of intimacy. Now she's fallen in with three truly insane survivors and has to ride the wave of lunacy to escape. But as her own crushing personal demons come crashing down, the temptation to indulge in the crazy becomes more tempting than another day in the Crossed world outside. These madmen aren't hiders or scavengers...they are the livers.
