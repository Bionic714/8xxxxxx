

Ordinary people with extraordinary talents attempt to break their way into the world famous record book! 
A daring mother shatters light tubes with her body in a trampoline fueled leap of faith, a man puts his forehead to the test hammering nails, a human garbage compacter swallows candles still aflame,
 and a man risks life and limb in a head on collision course with speeding cars. Hosted by Dan Cortese.
