,t2BeDLaM,2013-02-11T15:35Z,"hey just curious, but 10.4 is out there and these are so large so nt sure if you new the newer versions were out there or not. They goto 2011
I got mine from demonoid when they were up. Actually I made alldata 10.4 portable and have it so you can install it all on a hard drive and run it all from there without going through the install process and running the crack.
 Search on here for alldata portable..."
