[T],rjordan21,2013-02-10T16:08Z,^^^ my pleasure.  You should upload the vinyl Pyromania!  I prefer them before their huge success though.... before they were on the radio non-stop but that's just MY opinion..... ;)

Some things John:

dBpoweramp, among other things, is a program to create files in a folder on your hard drive. You can rip a CD into individual files in a folder.  Preferably in FLAC format!  This is the folder you use to create a torrent file to upload.  To create that torrent file you need a program to do it.  You must have one now to download music here.  I use Bit Torrent.  There is an icon in Bit Torrent that creates a torrent file with any folder on your hard drive.  Whatever you're using I'm guessing that your program will too.  Once you create the torrent file and save it on your hard drive you can upload here.  It is very easy....

I learned alot from the forum that supports The Pirate Bay, Superbay.  You can easily register there and start reading.  It can get complicated quickly but there are a ton of great people there willing to help.  I use to mess around on the forums but Life is pulling me in too many directions now!.... but I'll always be happy to answer a question (if I can) just ask it here in the comments.

Oh yea, don't be too concerned about bit length and sampling rate. (16bit 44.1khz vs 24bit 96khz).  Yes, there is a difference but to hear it most people need some really good gear and know HOW to listen to discern the difference.  For me, nothing has the ability to communicate what makes music truly special than vinyl, regardless of the sample rate!

Now.... what to record....have fun man.

No offense, and it's not you, but I'd rather not put up an email....

Just upload that CD right here on TPB!!!!

Good music should be shared!!!!"
