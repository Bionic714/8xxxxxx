[V],TheExecutive,2013-02-10T16:03Z,"They've had some bad hosts in recent years,
but they don't get any worse than Justin Bieber!"
,dbranson17,2013-02-10T18:26Z,It could be worse... Adam Levine could have co-hosted and then the two of them did sketches together...
[V],TheExecutive,2013-02-10T19:18Z,"The writing wasn't so hot last night either, but as far as hosts go, next week's SNL will be great with Christophe Waltz !  A true actor adept in either comedy or drama ( see the last two Tarentino films).

How about Carrie Brownstein from ""Portlandia"" for the season finale?  She and Fred Armisen work so well together."
