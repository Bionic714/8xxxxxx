Thanks for the upload nonetheless."
,thundershnozel,2013-02-18T06:50Z,"@not.me, I have windows 8 pro x64, and I have successfully patched the program. It took me about 4 trials of installing and uninstalling the program, but I've finally done it. Here is the REALLLY detailed set of installation instructions:

1. Uninstall any previous installation of Stardock Start8. Don't forget to delete the ""C:Program Files (x86)Stardock"" and the (hidden) ""C:ProgramDataStardock"" folders. Also run ccleaner to correct the registry.

2. Run the ""Stardock Start8 v1.11.exe"" file and follow the on-screen instructions to install ""Stardock Start8 v1.11""

3. When the installation process is finished, click on ""Finish""

4. Click on ""Try Start8"" in the ""Welcome to Start8"" window and then close the ""Stardock Start8 Configuration"" window

5. Right-click on the buttom left corner of the screen and then click on ""Control Panel"" -----> ""System and Security 

   -----> ""Administrative Tools"" -----> ""Services""

6. In the ""Services"" window, find the ""Stardock Start8"" item and double-click on it. Click on the ""Startup type:""

   drop-down menu and choose ""Disabled"". Finally, click on ""Stop"" -----> ""Apply"" -----> ""OK""

7. Close all open windows and restart your PC

8. Copy the ""Stardock Start8 Patch.exe"" file to the ""C:Program Files (x86)StardockStart8"" folder

9. Right-click on the ""Stardock Start8 Patch.exe"" file, located in the ""C:Program Files (x86)StardockStart8"" 

   folder, choose ""Run as administrator"", uncheck the ""BACKUP"" box, and click on the ""Patch"" button. When the 

   ""Stardock Start8 Patch"" program indicates that it has successfully patched the ""Stardock Start8 v1.11"" software,

   click on ""EXIT"". You can now safely delete the ""Stardock Start8 Patch.exe"" file from the 

   ""C:Program Files (x86)StardockStart8"" folder

10. Right-click on the buttom left corner of the screen and then click on ""Control Panel"" -----> ""System and Security 

   -----> ""Administrative Tools"" -----> ""Services""

11. In the ""Services"" window, find the ""Stardock Start8"" item and double-click on it. Click on the ""Startup type:""

   drop-down menu and choose ""Automatic"". Finally, click on ""Apply"" -----> ""OK""

12. Close all open windows and restart your PC

,vdshah,2013-03-03T14:32Z,Working Perfectly also in my x64 architecture Thanks

I would recommend cracking the start8 program in a VM install of win8 then copy the cracked files over. "
,wilco1000,2013-03-20T22:46Z,"@thundershnoze, works great but point 17. I found after, ""Close all open windows and restart your PC""
you may find a blank screen, if so go to the right and allow slide screen to open and restart from there.
When it restarts Works Great many thanks!"
