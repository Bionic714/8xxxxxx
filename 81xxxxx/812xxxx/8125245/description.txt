Ocean Colour Scene. The critics hate them and nobody seems to know why. When people dismiss this band, theyΓÇÖll say that itΓÇÖs because they rely on the past too much and theyΓÇÖre stuck in the ΓÇÖ60s. Meanwhile artists like Miles Kane and Jake Bugg turn to retro rock for their inspiration and are praised for it. 

But donΓÇÖt worry, youΓÇÖre not about to read another ignorant review from a clueless critic. YouΓÇÖre not about to read the biased words of a massive superfan either, but having heard a lot of their music, there are songs of theirs that I like and songs that I donΓÇÖt. I understand enough about OCS to give a fair overview of their latest album.

Like most people, I discovered them in 1996 with ΓÇÿMoseley ShoalsΓÇÖ, an album I still regard as one of the best of the decade. The 1997 follow up ΓÇÿMarchinΓÇÖ AlreadyΓÇÖ was another fine record, and boasted more classic singles. Afterwards came 1999ΓÇ▓s ΓÇÿOne From The ModernΓÇÖ, but with the Britpop boom over, the band seemed rather out of step with things. The albums that followed certainly werenΓÇÖt as strong, although each one of them had their moments. In fact if you were to take the three best songs from each of the LPs they made in between 2001 and 2010, youΓÇÖd have enough to compile a very strong collection of tracks. Maybe following those hit albums was hard, and perhaps theyΓÇÖve been trying a bit too hard or overthinking things at times. After the original four piece lost a member in 2005, they recruited two more instead, forming the line up that wrote and recorded the last two records. For the recording of this album they return as the core three piece.
