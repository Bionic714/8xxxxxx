One of the most important artists in the history and development of the Blues, James played the electric Blues similar to that of Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf, but differentiated by a more aggressive sound produced by his anguished vocals and a slashing bottleneck guitar. With his slide guitar, his sharp voice and thumbing bass line, Elmore personified the essence of Chicago Blues in the heydays of Blues Music in the 1950s. There are 21 tracks on this compilation including a bonus cut of the original 1951 studio version of his enduring blues classic 'Dust My Boom'. (sanity.com.au)
