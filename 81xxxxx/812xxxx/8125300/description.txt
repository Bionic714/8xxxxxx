Germany's Bear Family Records doesn't do anything half-assed, and the dozen or so volumes in the label's Blowing the Fuse series are generous, fascinating and full of half-forgotten gems. This volume is no exception, as 1949 was the year that launched John Lee Hooker's Boogie Chillen into the world as well as Stick McGhee's immortal Drinkin' Wine, Spo-Dee-O-Dee, just two of the enduring sides to be found here. Anyone who still needs proof that the world was rockin' long before rock & roll officially hit, look no further. (allmusic.com)
