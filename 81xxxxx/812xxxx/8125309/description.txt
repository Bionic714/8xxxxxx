Sweet Soul Music: 1963 album was released Aug 05, 2008 on the Bear Family (Germany) label. 1963 saw the release of a wealth of singles that would come to define the sound of `60s soul. Garnett Mimms' slow burning Cry Baby, laid the groundwork for countless gospel-inflected deep soul ballads, while Martha Reeves and the Vandellas' driving Heat Wave, was one of Motown's most notable early triumphs.
