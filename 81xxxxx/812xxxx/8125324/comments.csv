,Bzbstxi,2013-02-23T17:04Z,"Hi there. I'd like to chip in so that the person who made the subtitles for this version can get an English lesson.
I prefer to use subtitles when watching most movies, either in Swedish or English, since I suffer from impaired hearing which makes it difficult for me at times to make out the dialogue when there's a lot of other noise in the background. (Score, effects, etc. that are too loud)
But even I can hear/see the rather large discrepancies between the dialogue and the subtitles here.
A/V-wise the quality is ok for the filesize.
But if you want/need the subtitles, look for them elsewhere or download a different release alltogether. "

I partly disagree with your statement. Granted, the subtitles are not in sync with the dialogue but the difference is literally less than a sec.

For those that care, I did a quick check it appears that only the introduction is in written Spanish.  The entire dialogue appears to be in English. Again, I only did a quick check. So you have two options:

- download this version, edit the .srt file to only contain the introduction, and then mux the .srt file into the video file using MKVMerge.
- download another .torrent. I downloaded this one:

http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8147154/The.Impossible.2012.720p.BRRiP.XViD.AC3-LEGi0N#filelistContainer

It has the foreign language written introduction as well. So you might have to port the .srt file from this .torrent into the other .torrent."
,vivatpb5776,2013-04-07T16:47Z,"To follow-up, the first three lines of the .srt are the written introduction. I confirmed that the subtitles appear .2 secs earlier than the foreign language written introduction. If you want to be anal, it's actually closer to .25 seconds."
