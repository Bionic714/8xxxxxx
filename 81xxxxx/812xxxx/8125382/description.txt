All of the released Ponycraft maps, released voluntarily by the Ponycraft staff.

From the download page:

"You are free to extract your buildings from those maps, and to play around with them on your private, closed server, but please don't use entire maps on public servers. Countless people have been building on these maps and it might very well be that some would not want their buildings on another server. Thank you."
