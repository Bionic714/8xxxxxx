,afroevan,2013-02-10T10:44Z,"Thanks heaps!!! I created an account just to say how graetful I am. For months now it's been hard to watch Young Justice and Green Lantern in Australia, they don't air here, and you see reviews, but like last week there was no upload for 3 days or so for Green Lantern.
Your toon torrents are all quality, and you have my appreciation. Let's hope CN pull their head out and renew them both :)"
,ImmaDLStf,2013-02-10T11:26Z,This is definitely the last season. CN cancelled the series.
