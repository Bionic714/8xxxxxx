An epic history of a doomed civilization and a lost empire. The devastating 
struggle to the death between the Carthaginians and the Romans was one 
of the defining dramas of the ancient world. In an epic series of land 
and sea battles, both sides came close to victory before the Carthaginians 
finally succumbed and their capital city, history, and culture were 
almost utterly erased.

Drawing on a wealth of new archaeological research, Richard Miles vividly 
brings to life this lost empire-from its origins among the Phoenician 
settlements of Lebanon to its apotheosis as the greatest seapower in 
the Mediterranean. And at the heart of the history of Carthage lies 
the extraordinary figure of Hannibal-the scourge of Rome and one of 
the greatest military leaders, but a man who also unwittingly led his 
people to catastrophe. The first full-scale history of Carthage in decades, 
Carthage Must Be Destroyed reintroduces modern listeners to the larger-than-lif-
e historical players and the ancient glory of this almost forgotten 
civilization.
