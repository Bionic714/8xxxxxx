The fate of the world balances on the edge of Red Sonja's blade! Will Sonja, Vampirella, Dracula and the rest of their allies be able to destroy Kulan Gath forever, or will his Army of Darkness triumph? Sonja and Vampirella will never be the same, as crossover kings Ron Marz and Walter Geovani reveal one last surprise. Is this the end ... or just the beginning?
