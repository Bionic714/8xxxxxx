For XVID AVI with MP3 audio, current consensus suggests:
V=9
A=9
.
This replaces all previous "Scene" releases with "Gross Pixelation Errors" @ 05:38

...(DIM is short for DIMENSION, the 720p partner in damaged encodes with LOL).
Can LOL really keep up these massive amounts of damaged files past the year mark?
There are blissful signs of a crack in the idiot facade.
LOL spaced Scandal.US.S02E12 for 22 hours.I got 10,000 downloads in 24 hours.
LOL is hardly needed at this point.
LOL damaged "The.Following.S01E01" within the first thirty seconds of the show.
LOL seems to have waited past the five minute mark to damage the first of two last night.
LOL / DIM until recently a perfectly matched pair - damage in one identical to the other.
But two things have changed that. 2HD has a couple of times paired with DIM - no LOL.
And now I've seen a LOL encode nuked (repack by 2HD), but DIM's apparently was fine.
I've toned down my "evile ways" (management was right to bring me up short).
LOL is the problem and I was very unfair to uploaders who did no wrong.
It's like punching the mailman in the nose because you're pissed at the government.
You feel real good about striking out - but blinded by the fact that it's the wrong person.
With "Touch.S02E01" damaged, it hardly made sense to even look at "Touch.S02E02".
