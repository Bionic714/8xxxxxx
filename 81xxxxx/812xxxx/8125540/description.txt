With the intention to save another innocent soul, he accidentally kills a man. Dora is the only witness to the crime. She is a poor cleaning woman who leads a breathless life. The struggle to survive has made her unfair. The righteous Sotiris and the unrighteous Dora like each other. But love, honesty and justice arenΓÇÖt easy to combine.
