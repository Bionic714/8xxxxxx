Jet Planes of the Third Reich: The Secret Projects, Vol. 1
by Manfred Griehl

DESCRIPTION:
This book is the first of two volumes covering the fascinating German jet and rocket powered aircraft projects that were designed, developed, but not flown before the end of WW II. It is a look into the future, since many of the projects were adopted and adapted to the postwar needs of the victorious Allies. This volume covers German day fighters and interceptors plus multi-engined heavy day fighters known to the Germans as Zerstorers. This book also explores the background and conditions that facilitated the creation of so many diverse designs.
