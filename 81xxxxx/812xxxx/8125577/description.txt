Gianni AmelioΓÇÖs new film explores the cultural divide between West and East through the character of Vincenzo, an Italian engineer who finds himself on a startling, life-changing voyage. ΓÇ£The Dismissal,ΓÇ¥ the best-selling novel that inspired The Missing Star, is a story with many dimensions. In AmelioΓÇÖs sensitive hands, it is a moving tale about an obsessive desire to right a wrong. But VincenzoΓÇÖs near-messianic voyage is as complex as the man and the culture from which he has come.
The Missing Star is also a road movie, tracing a trip from Italy to China and, once in China, across and through its vast landscape.
