,roadhazrd6803,2013-02-11T05:04Z,why am i dling this why not upload the whole thing?
,halohorns,2013-02-11T05:04Z,"err0001, thanks for this. But this kinda screws people who use RSS for downloading because it downloads this teaser and thinks it got the whole episode. So then it won't download the full episode later. Is there something you can put in the title that RSS feeds can key off to ignore this for auto downloading? Maybe ""teaser"" or ""sample"" or something?"
