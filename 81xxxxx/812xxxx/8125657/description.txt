The Walking Dead - 2 more minutes of S03E09 (The Suicide King)

This clip shows about 2 more minutes of the next episode of The Walking Dead.  

Clearly this part of the episode follows substantial developments after the events of the first 2 minute clip. It might be the tail end of the episode. It may suggest certain things, but it isn't clear. Whether you consider this a spoiler and whether you decide to watch or not is up to you. Don't say I didn't warn you.

This clip aired during a marathon of The Walking Dead on AMC HD in Canada on Feb 9, 2013.
