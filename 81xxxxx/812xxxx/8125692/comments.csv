If this link and the others are not available then search for the latest elmalvado release."
,elmalvado,2013-02-17T11:53Z,"Thanks guys, I'll include these files in my February release."
,davedavid,2013-02-18T03:37Z,@elmalvado Is there any chance of including the 'lite' versions of the core books for the next release? They are a free download option on the site if anyone has them.
,davedavid,2013-02-18T04:02Z,"Also, does anyone have the Trade Routes: Expanded Caravan Rules sourcebook? Its third party material."
,esc1111,2013-02-25T01:52Z,"hey el, can you remove the watermarks on some so the files i sent you, before posting them?

,elmalvado,2013-03-01T20:50Z,"Here comes Animal Archive: http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8208149

@esc1111 - I'm just resharing these files from other sources. I can't remove watermarks.

@SirHat - Enjoy!

@davedavid - I'm afraid that removing watermarks from lite versions of core books is too time consuming. High priority is for new releases & other books that aren't currently available."
,elmalvado,2013-03-01T20:51Z,@cyric0376 - I was looking for these files too but noone has liberated them yet.
,Kiba_M,2013-04-08T15:52Z,Is there any chance you'll have the last couple Season 3 scenarios in the next update? Or Season 4? I can't seem to find them anywhere...
