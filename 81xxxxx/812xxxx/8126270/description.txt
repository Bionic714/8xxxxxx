Like the Aldous Huxley book The Doors of Perception that this album title gives a nod to, I was hoping that The Magic Door was going to open realms that IΓÇÖd never even imagined. But the fact of the matter is that The Magic Door is, for the most part, something that the members of the ΓÇ£HallucinationΓÇêNationΓÇ¥ (a monker for Robinson fans) have all seen before.

ItΓÇÖs not really too surprising, though, as The Magic Door has been billed all along as the ΓÇ£companionΓÇ¥ album to Big MoonΓÇêRitual, which was released in June. Both albums were recorded over two monstrous sessions earlier this year at Sunset Sound in Los Angeles with producer Thom Monahan. So the songs have been kicking around for a while, and theyΓÇÖve all been played frequently on the road. But all of that ΓÇÿpoor-whoa-is-meΓÇÖ lamenting about no new material aside, the album is in fact a superb companion to Big MoonΓÇêRitual.
