With the music industry desperately in need of a substantial shot in the arm, allow me to introduce you to, Ariana Gillis. She is a 21-year-old singer songwriter from Vineland, Ontario, who recently launched her second CD Forget Me Not.

Gillis possesses a unique voice that can best be described as fearless ΓÇô an ΓÇ£originalΓÇ¥ musical talent in an ocean of bland and blander. She is a self-professed voracious reader with the innate ability to write songs that matter, her subjects ranging from personal despair, to creatures with healing powers, to celebrating freedom and mourning the state of the world we live in. 

There have been the comparisons of her to the likes of Bob Dylan and Tom Waits, her sound is indeed rife with a traditional folk and rock beat that seems to suit her perfectly.

After listening to Forget Me Not, Bernie Taupin (Elton JohnΓÇÖs lyricist) had this to say: ΓÇ£IΓÇÖm staggered by how good she is. There is not much that impresses me these days, but after hearing her available tracks I can honestly say sheΓÇÖs the single most exciting thing IΓÇÖve heard in a very long time.ΓÇ¥
