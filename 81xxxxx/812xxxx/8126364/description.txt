Though itΓÇÖs somewhat surprising Thurston Moore and Beck didnΓÇÖt work together prior to Demolished Thoughts, their collaboration lives up to its promise, delivering an album of psychedelic chamber folk that is the perfect meeting of both artistsΓÇÖ mellow sides. At times, Beck the producer feels like a junior version of his longtime collaborator Nigel Godrich -- and indeed, Beck brings some of the expansive intricacy of works like Sea Change to this set -- but here heΓÇÖs truly accomplished, embellishing MooreΓÇÖs songs with special effects that really are special. ΓÇ£IlluminineΓÇ¥'s rippling harps and sparkling electronics conjure a vast, dusky twilight filled with fireflies, while the strings and layers of other sounds on ΓÇ£Blood Never LiesΓÇ¥ float along like pieces of dandelion fluff. These filigrees add a beauty that doesnΓÇÖt get in the way of MooreΓÇÖs strumming and melodies, whether theyΓÇÖre angular or flowing, or both, as is the case with ΓÇ£Mina LoyΓÇ¥'s descending drones. Beck also adds a trippy depth to Demolished Thoughts that is often breathtaking, particularly on ΓÇ£Circulation,ΓÇ¥ a tone poem about vinyl that grows from atonal acoustic riffing into a sound-world of sawing, strafing strings, and on ΓÇ£In the Silver Rain with a Paper KeyΓÇ¥'s meditative shimmer. This approach is a big change from MooreΓÇÖs previous solo effort, the much more down-to-earth Trees Outside the Academy, which felt like a more distinct entity from Moore's work with Sonic Youth. In some ways, Demolished Thoughts' size and polish rivals anything heΓÇÖs done with them, and itΓÇÖs hard not to hear echoes of the band on several of these songs. ΓÇ£BenedictionΓÇ¥ opens the album with the kind of pastoral ruminations Moore has been dabbling in since Washing Machine, albeit given an extra glow thanks to the hypnotic layers of percussion, keyboards, and strings woven throughout. Meanwhile, ΓÇ£Orchard StreetΓÇ¥'s stream-of-consciousness evocation of New York feels like itΓÇÖs just down the block from Murray St. Of course, itΓÇÖs hardly bad or surprising that MooreΓÇÖs work resembles itself, especially not when the results are this compelling.
