Lifetime-Twist of Faith [2013]

Air Date: 9 Feb 2013

Summary: A single mother (Toni Braxton) and her gospel community help a man (David Julian Hirsh) whose wife and three children were murdered. In Twist of Faith, the fictional, cross-cultural, music infused love story tells the tale of Jacob Fisher (Hirsh), an Orthodox Jewish Cantor and amateur songwriter from Brooklyn, New York, who witnesses the senseless murder of his wife and three children.  Catatonic, Jacob walks out on his Jewish mourning ritual, leaving behind his Jewish garments, wallet and keys.  Abandoning his identity, he wanders aimlessly, hoping somehow to understand his tragedy.  Fortuitously, he lands in Brent, Alabama (population 2,500), where he is embraced by Nina (Braxton), a single mother and the lead singer of a small gospel choir, her Uncle Moe (Williamson) and their gospel community who help him re-examine his life. While music brings Nina and Jacob together, they try to make sense of his past and their possible future.
