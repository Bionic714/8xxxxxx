[V],thenoobish,2013-02-10T17:53Z,But it looks like its doing fine?
[V],Mr.Stifmeister,2013-02-10T18:13Z,"Ah well, let it stay then :P
Enjoy for those who want this :)"
,bigwee,2013-02-10T18:57Z,"Been waiting for this freaking game for ages. Nobody uploaded it yet and now finally I found it, big props. Is Capitalism 2 a requirement?"
[V],Mr.Stifmeister,2013-02-10T19:14Z,@bigwee: You dont need Capitalism 2 to play this. Just install this one and paste the crack in game install folder and you are ready to go :)
,bigwee,2013-02-10T20:46Z,"Yeah did it and got it working and all. Experienced some weird bug though with all the money going haywire all over for some reason. Didn't have inflation turned on either, so no bug with that."
,rocksbury,2013-02-11T04:47Z,"so is this a legit expansion or is it made by a mod community.
Either way its incredible, we need more games like this."
,iancrz,2013-02-12T22:39Z,could you upload a new version? cuz this 2.0.2 version is too bugged! after 40 minutes playing the game keeps freezing for 3s constantly
,hatepig,2013-02-17T01:16Z,yeah the freezing problem makes it unplayable
,iancrz,2013-03-03T15:44Z,"ok, I've found a solution for the lag problem

1) When the lag starts, save your game and quit to windows.
2)Start cap lab again (If you get an error message, just ignore it)
3) If you get this error message, the game will freeze when you load your save
4) If this happens, just quit again
5) Start the game, load your save and now its back to normal

Do this every time the lag occurs, this is the only I've found to keep it playable"
,MadRevolver,2013-03-05T17:00Z,thank you for the upload Mr.Stif! Also thanks iancrz for taking some time to offer solution! The universe will reward you guys:)
,thaghost1,2013-03-20T20:37Z,"Fuck yeah! Been waiting for some sort of update to Cap 2 for a long long time, But I never figured it would be a new game. Serious respects, Stiffy."
,6g94,2013-03-27T22:50Z,"Apparently, that isn't lag. It's the games Always Online DRM.

Is there a crack for that? Is it possible to crack Always Online?"
