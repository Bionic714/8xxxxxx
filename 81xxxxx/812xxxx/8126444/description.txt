8 lossless recordings of Dvorak Symphony no. 9 From the New World. Flac/Ape in separate tracks, log, scans, score. Added New York Times 1893 original article about the premiere, and Leonard Bernstein's detailed analysis of the Symphony for a "Music Appreciation Record" issued in 1956 by the Book-of-the-Month Club, a major cultural force in mid-century America. He used both piano and recorded orchestral excerpts to illustrate his beautiful, memorable talk about how it was truly multinational in its foundations. Enjoy!
