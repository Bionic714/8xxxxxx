Stop uploading them, ask people to seed more,
the only one that is seeding is me, every BluRay i uploaded 2 till 4 TB and people keeps running after the download."

Secondly, I understand your issue.

I still haven't begun downloading the set because I was afraid that not all the set would be uploaded.

Thanks for your uploads, and hope that the rest of the set will be uploaded in the near future."
