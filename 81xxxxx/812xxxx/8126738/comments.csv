,Croweyes1121,2013-02-16T20:17Z,"Any chance of a 2D version of the 3D remaster?  The 2D version has inferior video quality, but I don't have a 3D television.  So I'd love a rip of just the ""left eye"" stream of this!  Thanks!"
,DuckyNDS,2013-02-20T00:05Z,Thank you for the upload but is there any possibility of getting an under-3gb version of this? The only thing I have to play this on is my PS3 and it doesn't like large files.
