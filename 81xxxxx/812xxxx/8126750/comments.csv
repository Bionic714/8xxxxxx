,barockeva,2013-02-10T21:47Z,"Watchable, but the video keeps going in and out of focus.

,Zanteater,2013-02-11T02:56Z,"Yeah, @barockeva, cams usually do that."
,c0ldpr0xy,2013-02-11T04:03Z,"Are you guys fucking kidding? First, we got faggy vampires with sparkling dusts and shit.

Now same thing happening to zombies. Zombie romance film? Bullshit.

This is the new Twilight."
,salazam1,2013-02-11T05:07Z,"c0ldpr0xy calm the fuck down, did you watch it? It might be decent. That said, hollywood tends to corrupt anything and everything it touches. It's nothing new and shouldn't surprise you."
,swine666,2013-02-11T13:59Z,I don't want to ruin the experience by watching this move on camera! Who knows how long we'll have to wait for a dvdrip :(
,floss666,2013-02-11T14:45Z,"@zanteater, not when you lock focus you dumbass. only cheap-ass cams can't do that."
,majorun,2013-02-12T00:47Z,Not worth downloading.... jumpy camera all along and out of focus...
,majorun,2013-02-12T00:51Z,"Not worth downloading

,srnm123,2013-02-12T02:39Z,people blazed on trainwreck could operate a camera better than this chick did
,Elfcap,2013-02-12T07:19Z,Chill out ppl. This is a COMEDY. New Twilight? Wtf. Did you even see the trailer?

,barabusignasius,2013-02-13T06:22Z,To whoever made this...thank you but don't use autofocus on the camera.  What could have been an excellent cam is constantly adjusting and refocusing...ruins it.  I'd rather it be consistently out of focus than adjusting all the time
,fendamn123,2013-02-13T13:12Z,"Watched this movie in theaters and it was not as good as expected more of a funny Romantic zombie on human action... 

for a ca A-6 V-6 M-4"
,BalisongBrad,2013-02-15T01:45Z,"haven't d/l this copy, but I did watch the movie in the theatres. It was decent, the beginning was a little boring, but it got pretty interesting after a few minutes. Well worth watching, and I'd say this is a watchable copy based on the uploader and the previous comments. And you can watch it in really crappy virus infected definition at FUCK YOU SPAMMERS dot EATaDick! :)  j/k"

,sphynx9,2013-02-17T06:12Z,"THANK YOU FOR TRYING..........
UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS NOT WORTH DOWNLOADING. 

WAIT FOR A BETTER COPY. 

CAM GOES IN & OUT OF FOCUS TOO MUCH. 

AUDIO ECHOS A LOT. 

THANKS AGAIN FOR TRYING THOUGH. "
,cowfucker,2013-02-17T09:06Z,"Thanks for the reviews.
And @gjones88 you are a cunt for the spoiler, but a funny one."
,K1bbler,2013-02-17T10:17Z,I highly doubt anyone who actually make cams posts directly to TPB. 99% of torrents here are ripped and re-encoded from other sources. So abusing the uploader for poor quality just makes you stupid.
,xnightmarexweaverx,2013-02-17T11:19Z,good video but i wish it was in focus in the whole movie but its really good 
,whisper2dogs,2013-02-17T22:11Z,@@gjones88 You stupid bitch!! don't you know better than to spoil it for everyone else? No I guess not. And spammers eat shit and die!! 
,JoaoPauloBR,2013-02-18T19:11Z,Thanks! Seems like a nice movie :)

,locky_things,2013-02-23T23:56Z,"wow, for five thousand seeders you guys sure seem to hate this torrent. yeah, this is a bit not good, but you don't need to be so rude. clam down people"
,swine666,2013-02-24T21:40Z,"We want this movie in DVDrip and we want it NOW! Why doesn't somebody grow a pair and just break into a damn cinema and just steal the DVD from the machine! 

We want one of those dudes that go ""here, hold my beer"" and come back with the movie!"

,fazioh318,2013-02-26T03:26Z,This Cam Verson would have been great if someone didn't screw up with the auto focusing on their camera..blurry as shit
,salazam1,2013-03-01T23:51Z,c0ldpr0xy you were right. Movie was shit. Couldn't even finish it.
,Tim29j,2013-03-05T05:24Z,"A/4 V/3

This is one of those films you start watching and you are like ha! I am SO Glad I didnt watch this in the cinema.... and by the end you are like ah no! I wish I watched this in the cinema.  Its a nice film, a horror romantic comedy, that a guy can still enjoy but you can take a chick to it she will love it.

The cam is in and out of focus the whole movie, the audio has plenty of 'crowd noises' coughing, couple of people getting up and laughter (I dont mind the laughter for some reason lol) anyway, I was expecting to hate the film, just d/l it because I like zombie stuff and had a whole house to tidy... by the end I was wished I had either waited for a HD version or just gone to the bloody cinema.

As always thank you so much to the uploader- I am sure a ton of people will like it less than me and be pumped they got to see it here.  

THANK YOU JUGGS YOU SWEETIE!"
,jagwiz69,2013-03-13T05:44Z,"Hey 'boxmak', where is the alien spacecraft you are broadcasting from, parked next to a McDonalds? Seriously bro, forget the movies, you should be downloading rosetta stone because you are the stereotypical outsourced call center habib that makes me go ape shit when your job is to help me with a problem with....oh pretty much anything I pay for on a monthly basis...except the irony is that you are there to help me, yet no matter how many fucking ways i try to describe my problem, I'm ultimately transferred to the only american in the call center (your boss).....which begs the question.  HOW IS THIS CHEAPER AND MORE EFFICIENT FOR YOU CORPORATE ""SCHOLARS""???? WHY DON'T YOU JUST TONGUE PUNCH MY FART BOX INSTEAD?  "

Video: 5/10

I am really broke at the moment so decided to download it instead of wasting all my money on the ridiculously expensive cinemas($17.50 for a student?! COME ON!!). Anyway so I got impatient and watched it. 

The entire fight scene was blurry as shit and I could barely make out the faces in the scene as well as many other times. 

It's not the uploaders fault - I knew what I was getting into. I usually just wait for a DVDRIP but I was bored and it was the holidays so yeah. 

Luckily I loved this movie, had the right amount of action, adventure, horror - not into that but its exciting ;), thriller and romance. Romance, romance, romance!!! "
,wwextreme,2013-04-14T12:57Z,"gjones88 - you really should be shot in the fucking head you stupid cunt.. how fucking dare you put a spoiler on such a new movie.. you just sit there and hope someone doesnt find a way to find you, because i sure as fuck would lay you out and kick you in the head multiple times..!!!! piss off out to your garden and plant a brain..!!!!"
,dCrackShot,2013-05-08T00:22Z,"To those of you who deem it necessary to exercise the abilities you may think you have regarding movie criticism, I say, Fuck You. 

I'm sure I don't just speak for myself when I say that I don't give a shit what your opinion about the movie is. If I want to know what people think about the movie itself I am sure as shit not going to try and find reviews from any torrent websites.

That being said, I encourage you, however, to enlighten me on the resolution and quality of the torrent along with any details of suspicions you may have regarding the honesty of the torrent.

If I'm not mistaken I'd say that's what the comment section of this website is for in the first place."
