,imagic5,2013-02-10T19:51Z,"@ vavavroom
I am watching right now: 
Audio is just fine, for a CAM.
But the video is completely blurry; this guy doesn't know how to operate a camera.

When it's not blurry it's fine.
But overall: 
A:7 V:4

,wild_dragon,2013-02-11T06:44Z,"after viewing,  good cam, goes blurry every few minuites but still watchable, Im not here to bash on these paticular uploads cuz it takes guts to pay for a movie, record, then upload so others can view free of charge. so my rating update is A/10 (based on a 5.1 surround sound system plus PS3) V/4 based on watchable but blurry every few minutes. (PUT YOUR BEER GOGGLES ON LOL)"

,Calamakuya,2013-02-12T22:36Z,@ adsychet... You can do the world a big favor by cutting your tongue and sticking it up your ass... or stopping spamming here with your fucking spamming sites.  Whatever happens first.
,Calamakuya,2013-02-12T22:51Z,"Nice upload, thanks.

Regarding the movie itself, with all the possible open mind I could muster, I still find it hard to put any logic in a woman falling in love with a dead man, regardless that there are any kind of people on this earth...  Ohh well, the show must go on."
,Jack_b8,2013-02-18T02:23Z,"For a CAM...
A- 8
V- 5
M- 5

The video deserves a bad rating because it is constantly out of focus -- maybe 20-25% of the film is, in fact, out of focus.  Sometimes it doesn't matter, sometimes it does, but it's always amazingly annoying.

That said, I sincerely appreciate the attempt."
,silverstee1,2013-02-20T04:46Z,tahert2 why you try to scam people with crappy site that requires you to register and input credit card number and still doesn't show you video xD
,TooFlowPT,2013-02-22T00:10Z,is this 1080p?
,xanat0s,2013-03-15T18:56Z,"@imagic5 it's not the dunce behind the camera, it's the camera itself.. shit hardware from walmart no doubt that has no lock-focus feature"
,h903999,2013-03-31T05:04Z,"Plese try my just finished, home transcribed English Subtitles for this movie. 58 Kb in SRT file. It was hard as hell to make because there is no good audios out there. Anywho, English Subtitles avail at: h * * p : / / g o o ( .) g l / ON4V3 "
