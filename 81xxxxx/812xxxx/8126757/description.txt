Notes: The main reason for the readnfo is because the HDCAM has a focus issue threw
the movie, isnt all that bad but noticeable. Next time we will make sure focus is
set and lock. We did all kinds of filters to make it look nice without over darking
with black to make good screenshots. Adjusted video lighting for best overall
picture and for the audio it isnt all to bad... we just clean it up some. SO ENJOY!
