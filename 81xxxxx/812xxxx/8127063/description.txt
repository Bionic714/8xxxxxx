The only thing worse than Earth having an inter-dimensional stargate that led to the Zombies vs Robots catastrophe are Martians using one of their own to lead a sneak attack on Earth. But what will happen when zombies get a scent of those big, exposed Martian brains...? Zombie-Robot-Martian chaos from the co-creator of ZvR, Chris Ryall, and TMNT artist Andy Kuhn!
