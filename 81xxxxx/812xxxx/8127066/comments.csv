They stopped putting out new episodes for a little bit then started back again and now it seems like they stopped again. Is there a season 2 coming soon or have they just stopped season 1 again? Please get back to me ASAP  I have all 19 episodes so far

,Sojuuk,2013-02-16T05:46Z,It hasn't had any more episodes ordered by Disney and is most likely canceled(not renewed).
,gothambats2009,2013-03-08T03:57Z,I love this series so much!!! I hope it keeps going!!
,w00tbie,2013-04-11T02:45Z,i love it too :'( fucking show cancellers. but what TV series about resisting the established order ever *doesn't* get cancelled? (maybe star wars verse excepted). i'm amazed disney actually let 19 of these seeds get into all those little formative minds. 
,w00tbie,2013-04-11T02:56Z,and thanks uploader. i've got the singles but will d/l this and seed just because. 
,zfrank,2013-05-23T21:52Z,"Sadly, an underrated show that did what the two film before couldn't: deliver a compelling story with interesting and believable character. The fact that I, a 33 year old, found it exciting when it's clear that it was intended mainly for kids is a proof of it's brilliance. Maybe Tron should have animated all along.

I hope that it could be resurrected, but it doesn't look like the show made a big following that would demand its return."
