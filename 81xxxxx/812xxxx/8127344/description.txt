The Guild is an American comedy web series created and written by Felicia Day, who also stars as Cyd Sherman (aka Codex). 

The show revolves around the lives of a gamers' online guild, The Knights of Good, who play countless hours of a fantasy MMORPG video game entitled The Game. The story focuses on Codex, the guild's Priestess, who attempts to lead a normal life after one of her guild-mates, the warlock Zaboo (Sandeep Parikh), shows up on her doorstep.

Joss Whedon credits The Guild as one of the inspirations for Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog, which also starred Felicia Day.
