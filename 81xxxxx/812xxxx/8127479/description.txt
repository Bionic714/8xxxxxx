* Plot :

In New Orleans, hitman Jimmy Bobo (Sylvester Stallone) and his partner Louis Blanchard (Jon Seda) eliminate a corrupt policeman, Hank Greely (Holt McCallany), although Bobo leaves Lola (Weronika Rosati), a prostitute, alive. Later, at a bar, Blanchard is murdered by Keegan (Jason Momoa), who then attempts to kill Bobo, but fails and escapes. Bobo swears to avenge Blanchard's death.
Detective Taylor Kwon (Sung Kang) arrives in New Orleans to investigate Greely's death and meets Lieutenant Lebreton (Dane Rhodes), who informs him Lola confirmed Greely was assassinated. Kwon goes to the morgue, and, after seeing Blanchard's body and finding out who he is, he deduces that Blanchard and Bobo killed Greely. Meanwhile, Keegan meets with his employer, Robert Morel (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), and Morel's lawyer Marcus Baptiste (Christian Slater). Baptiste reveals that Greely tried to blackmail Morel, and provided local mobster Baby Jack (Douglas M. Griffin) with a file detailing Morel's illegal operations. Keegan later kills Baby Jack and his men and retrieves the file.
