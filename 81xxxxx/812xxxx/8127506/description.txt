Description

Reiji wants two things in life: a black belt in karate and Misa, the girl of his dreams. Luckily, Misa's big brother is the captain of the university karate club and is ready to strike a deal: Reiji can join the club if he tutors Misa in linear algebra.

Follow along in The Manga Guide to Linear Algebra as Reiji takes Misa from the absolute basics of this tricky subject through mind-bending operations like performing linear transformations, calculating determinants, and finding eigenvectors and eigenvalues. With memorable examples like miniature golf games and karate tournaments, Reiji transforms abstract concepts into something concrete, understandable, and even fun.

As you follow Misa through her linear algebra crash course, you'll learn about:

- Basic vector and matrix operations such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication
- Linear dependence, independence, and bases
- Using Gaussian elimination to calculate inverse matrices
- Subspaces, dimension, and linear span
- Practical applications of linear algebra in fields like computer graphics, cryptography, and engineering

But Misa's brother may get more than he bargained for as sparks start to fly between student and tutor. Will Reiji end up with the girlΓÇöor just a pummeling from her oversized brother? Real math, real romance, and real action come together like never before in The Manga Guide to Linear Algebra.
