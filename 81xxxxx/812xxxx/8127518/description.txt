When I rented "With love, Annette", I knew I was in for a treat but after the viewing was through I was left with a sinking feeling in me. It's not that the movie is bad; it's superb. It's just that seeing how great X-rated films were back in the 70s, how terrific the stars and how naturally looking and classy the women, drives an old porn lover such as myself to resignation. "With love, Annette" is a compilation of Annette Haven scenes, introduced by a very clean-cut, sober and composed Jamie Gillis. I could not believe that this was the old thug, dressed as he was in a suit and being clean shaven.
