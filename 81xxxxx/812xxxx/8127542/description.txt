All the Greatest Hits songs Principally recorded at United Sound Systems and Sound Room East, Detroit, Michigan. This 17-track compilation contains three certifiable R&B classics: the funk anthem "More Bounce To The Ounce," the trendsetting "Computer Love," and one of the finest singles of the '80s, Roger Troutman's solo smash "I Want To Be Your Man." The last is an achingly soulful and slow groove accented with the best use of the Vocoder (a device that changes the pitch of a voice without altering its tempo) in pop music history. All the Greatest Hits CD music contains a single disc with 17 songs.
