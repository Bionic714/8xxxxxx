,sightlessone,2013-02-27T08:36Z,"p.yotov,

Ghosted sucessfully on a 160 GB HDD (Looks like default Dell d630 80 GB HDD is too small BTW for anyone wondering...).

So thanks for that, however when I double clicked on Xentry I get access denied... it needs authorization... How do I crack it? Is it something to do with carprokey?? if you can give me a step by step on how I can activate the Xentry?? Thank you for your help!"
,etens001,2013-02-27T21:52Z,"Hello! Thank you for this upload. However old .gho-files (Norton 2003) are a bit hard to handle with new hardware. Instead of getting a Dell D630 I am trying to configure the whole image to a .vmdk-file instead, for use in a virtual pc environment (VMWARE). If and when I succeed I will upload the file here, if ok with you p.yotov?"
,p.yotov,2013-03-01T18:26Z,"sightlessone  :
download xentry/das/wis key generators and just generate key for your pc, different pc different HARDWARE KEY :)

etens001 
it is ok, if you cant make  i will make virtual and upload it if you want"
,crashoften,2013-03-02T22:39Z,It would be awesome if this could be released as either a vmware or windows virtual server disk image.
,crashoften,2013-03-02T22:42Z,It would be awesome if this could be released as either a VMWare of Microsoft Virtual Server image.
,p.yotov,2013-03-03T09:36Z,stay tuned :)
