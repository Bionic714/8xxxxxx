Album Info

Shyne is the self-titled debut album by rapper Shyne with Sean "P. Diddy" Combs' Bad Boy Records and was released on September 26, 2000. Shyne had been hyped prior to the album's release as similar in style and delivery to the deceased Notorious B.I.G.. Shyne had also drawn unfavorable media attention for being convicted in June 2000 for his involvement in a nightclub shooting; Shyne was incarcerated at the time of this album's release. The album peaked #5 on the Billboard Top 200. It sold very well, eventually achieving Platinum status. It contained fewer guest artists than most Bad Boy releases. The singles from the album, "Bad Boyz," "Bonnie & Shyne" (which both feature Barrington Levy), and "That's Gangsta," were only moderate hits.
