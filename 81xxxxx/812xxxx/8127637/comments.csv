,TheLathe,2013-02-11T04:35Z,"BTW, I'm just curious since I'm sort of new at this...  The file size is quite small, although I notice that a lot of HDTV rips her are usually around 2-3 Gigs.  Is there ANY improvement at all do you think if you used a larger file size, maybe up to a single layer DVD?

Just wondering what your thoughts were on this?

Thanks again mate!!!"
[T],nomad_runner,2013-02-11T20:04Z,"Lathe, I try to keep the file as small as possible because most people like smaller than larger files, for bandwidth, HD space etc. I hope my rips still look pretty good? With HDTV, it's hard to get perfect quality because some movies are shown with different aspect ratios and HD quality (1080i,p 720p, etc.). Some rips will definitely look better than others depending on the source. It also makes a difference what you are watching them on, HD TV (LCD, Plasma) monitor, or a HD Projector. I test all my movies on my Plasma and 92"" projection screen through a Yamaha surround receiver. By far they look better on my HD TV and projector then my ASUS 23"" monitor which always seems to diffuse blacks really poorly. I hope this helps. Thanks for commenting, I wish more would to let me know how my rips look to them!"
