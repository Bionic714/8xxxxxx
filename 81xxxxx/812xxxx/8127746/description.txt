For XVID AVI with MP3 audio, the twanging assures me:
V=9
A=9
.
No, didn't forget about all of you Nikita fans - just being extra careful.
I can't believe LOL pixelated the 1st ep of Following in the first 30 seconds.
I can't believe LOL pixelated the first of a dual "Touch" night, delaying me.
And I especially cannot fathom how LOL pixelated their first "Arrow" ep.
So, I could have taken a chance like i did with "Community", but this show's
imprtant to get right, can't leave it to chancee - so I previewed it first.
.
Well, that was the thinking - but before I could finish previewing it, this WEB-DL
came along and I much prefer them - quality I can trust.
.
Forgive me?
