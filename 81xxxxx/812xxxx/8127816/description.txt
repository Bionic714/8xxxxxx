Music from and Inspired by the Motion Picture 8 Mile is the official soundtrack to the 2002 semi-autobiographical movie 8 Mile, starring American rapper Eminem. The album was released under Shady Records, and spawned the hit single "Lose Yourself". It also spawned a follow up soundtrack, More Music from 8 Mile, consisting of songs that appear in 8 Mile, that were released as singles during the film's time setting of 1995. One of the songs was performed by Tupac Shakur, who would be the subject of a documentary with a soundtrack produced by Eminem, who also produced a posthumous album by Tupac. The album also features four songs by the Wu-Tang Clan and its members, and two songs by Mobb Deep, who eventually signed to G-Unit Records, headed by Shady Records artist 50 Cent. Both albums were also made available in censored versions, removing most of the strong profanity and violent content.
