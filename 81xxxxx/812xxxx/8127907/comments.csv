,TheArtificer,2013-02-12T05:35Z,Russian... Figured out that during the install you can change that to English in the drop down list. 
,Baiculescu21,2013-02-13T23:00Z,"Guys, all you need to do is, when installer opens, click next next (or.. whorever) till you reach the options part. You will see there voice language, audio language or smthing like that and in left part of each one, you'll have a little cross(...) click it and it will open lang's. Switch to english and you're done. Sry 4 my English ^^"
