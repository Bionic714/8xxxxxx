,silent555,2013-02-10T23:27Z,"CBRs and CBZs are just renamed RAR or ZIP files, respectively.  You're merely compressing a collection of jpgs into a RAR or ZIP file using something like WinRAR and then renaming the file extension from .rar to .cbr or .zip to .cbz.  PDF files for comics seems to be extremely uncommon, by the way.  Following the process above to make the CBR or CBZ files would be preferable, as there are numerous programs for reading CBR/CBZ files much more suited for comics than a PDF reader.  Hope this helps!"

I did just that and it worked fine, next upload of a comic will definitely be an improvement, smaller file size too if I can help it without losing too much of the quality. This was the maiden voyage, the ride should smooth out over time. Thank you again for taking the time out to comment!"
