While the punk rock rebellion carries certain connotations in the western countries that spawned it the ideals of the movement carry a little more heft when transplanted into other regions. Such as, for example, 1983 Czechoslovakia - a country still under Communist rule, six years away from the Velvet Revolution. Put into that context ... well, the punk ideals both mean a little bit more and come with a little more risk attached.

The main plot line takes place in Prague in 1983, amidst the Communist-imposed "normalization", a suffocating atmosphere dominated by the secret police. The story is about a few eighteen-year-olds' revolt against authority, social norms and adult duties and responsibility, about the search for one's own models and values. The main protagonists' escape from their humdrum lives is to provoke through the punk band they form. As the band members' ideas and opinions become increasingly extreme, they clash with the status quo and people's apathy but above all with each other. Although the story is based on personal experiences from the early 1980s, it could have taken place at any time and anywhere, and is more than likely to be taking place somewhere right now.
