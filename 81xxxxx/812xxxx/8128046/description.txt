MISSING PERSONS Spring Session M (Linn LP12 vinyl) 

ripped to FLAC with dBpoweramp using my equipment:

Linn LP12 turntable, Linn Ittok LV II tonearm, Linn K18 cartridge, Linn LK1 preamp, Cardas Quadlink 5C RCA cable, Pioneer PDR 609 cd recorder, Verbatim Vibe Music CDR.

This original vinyl, even with the pops, kills the cd.  

Thanks to vintage vinyl for inspiring me to take the time and set the levels. Terry Bozios amazing frenetic playing is outstanding.  There is a reason he played with Frank Zappa!
