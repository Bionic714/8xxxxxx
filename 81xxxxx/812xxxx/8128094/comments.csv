,bluecar5556,2013-02-15T06:41Z,I have ATT Galaxy 3 and neutron 1.86.2 and neutron 1.86.2 NEON works for a few songs then crashes.  followed instructions exactly and uninstalled everything then tried again to no avail.  Root injected with 4.1.1 w/ odin.
[T],vctrt,2013-02-16T06:57Z,"My instructions are how to patch and keep Neutron activated. Nowhere I wrote how to troubleshoot playback issues... 
Try searching the forums on neutronmp.com for a solution. Maybe some of your files are causing it to crash?
I've been using Neutron since v1.49 and for a few weeks 1.68.2 neon but never had any crashes..."
