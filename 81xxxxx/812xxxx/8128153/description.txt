Arthur (aka Wart) is a young boy who aspires to be a knights squire. On a hunting trip he falls in on Merlin, a powerful but amnesiac wizard who has plans for Wart beyond mere squiredom. He starts by trying to give Wart an 
education (whatever that is), believing that once one has an education, one can go anywhere. Needless to say, it doesnt quite work out that way.
