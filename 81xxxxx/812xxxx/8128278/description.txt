This movie was released most probable by HDCLUB(I don't see it in their site).
But it's say on google. Anyway thanks to original uploader.
Video from iTunes probable and audio from DVD.
This movie was uploaded because many users requested Rush Hour 2.
And at this time not exist a bluray of this movie.
When will be available, I make a bluray rip of this movie. Enjoy it!
