,Tuckle,2013-02-11T03:54Z,"Can't believe people are STILL asking for xvid versions.  There is NO advantage to xvid, it is a larger file at lesser quality, and these days pretty much any media player - VLC, Windows Media, MPC - will have no issues playing them.  The only reason I can think is that you want a .avi file so it will play on the ps3/xbox.  In that case, download your own converter and switch the file back to .avi"
,STONEDSTONER,2013-02-11T04:07Z,"^ dickhead you just answered your own question , its so my computer illiterate friends can watch on there xbox/ps3 ,also ALOT of people like to plug usb straight into the HDTV that generally only support xvid

Also Xbox does play most X264 it would even play this as its 2 channel sound, but its hit and miss alot of the time with this format so its just safer and easier to stick with Xvid

The difference in video quality is so small, X264 does look slightly better tho"
,johannesstander83,2013-02-14T21:33Z,Hey Thanks for the Top Gear but I am one of those guys that would like you to convert it for me to AVI also please because I can't play the mp4 on my tv from my harddrive it does not work
