In the 2000s and 2010s, Calexico developed a nifty sideline as one of the most frequently played bands in space, with their songs soundtracking missions by the Space Shuttles Discovery and Endeavour. However, given how synonymous their sounds are with their southwestern roots, it was even more surprising that they'd dedicate an album to New Orleans than have their earthy sounds beamed through the stars. Yet Algiers, which saw the band relocate to the Big Easy to truly absorb the city's rich musical history, is another graceful, seemingly effortless chapter in Calexico's history. 

On songs such as the eerie single Para, the brass that echoed mariachi traditions on the band's previous albums now conjures visions of New Orleans funerals, and the album as a whole is a beautiful tribute to the city as well as Calexico's ability to pay homage to different sounds while sounding unmistakably like themselves.
