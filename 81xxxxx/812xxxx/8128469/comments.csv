Also, just noticed you were an OSU fan. My father was a huge OSU fan and I became a bit of one as well through him even though I only lived in Ohio for a brief time when really young. My aunt still lives there and follows a bunch of Ohio sports, mostly Cleveland teams. Not sure if she is also an OSU fan though. Probably so.

Anyhow, thanks for the great material. Just came across it recently."
