Original Canadian recordings from one of the most under-appreciated British bands of the 1980s. When they landed their US recording contract, the company had them re-record for release on their label -- including the ubiquitous hit, WALKING ON SUNSHINE. For those who like that song but never heard the rest of their material, this album will be certain to give a whole new appreciation of the band.

Included is a PDF of booklet which provides good history of their evolution.
