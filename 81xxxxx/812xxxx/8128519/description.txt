Pylon were a rocky little dance band from Athens G-A, comprising - get this - a singer, a guitarist, a bassist and a drummer. They sounded like no one else, except maybe Gang of Four a little, and none of them, so far as is known, ever played in another band. Since their great Hits compilation now sells for triple its original price, this reissue of their 1980 debut is manna - especially because it leads with the definitive "Cool"/"Dub" single foolishly omitted from said debut and adds a dandy EP. Where are the songs, some naive young people will cavil, thus permitting the beat-wise hipsters at DFA to riposte, "What the fuck you think these are?" Plectrists Randy Bewley and Michael Lachowski's simple lines display untoward rhythm and melody, respectively. Curtis Crowe bangs away so obdurately it's hard to understand why he didn't become rich. Vanessa Briscoe Hay barks and brays whatever incantatory phrases seem called for. Timeless. Cool.
