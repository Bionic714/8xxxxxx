Mary Margaret O'Hara may be remembered as a comet who crossed Canada's musical horizon, glowed brightly for a short time, then passed on into oblivion, never to return. She only recorded one album, a four-song EP, and an extremely limited-edition film soundtrack, but they were original enough to send music writers scrambling to their thesauri to find the words to describe her unique voice and style. "O'Hara's voice weds the lilting twang of Patsy Cline to a near-operatic range," music critic Johnny Ray Huston wrote in the San Francisco Bay Guardian. "Her original, scat(tered) style doesn't just turn words into objects, it turns them into the possessions of an obsessive: neurotically she picks them up, rubs them, rips them, tosses them away, then picks them up again and tries to piece them back together ... Her voice ... is riddled with unpredictable stutters and hiccups, it struggles through fractured sentences and sentiments."

Upon its release in Canada and England in 1988, O'Hara's first (and only true) album Miss America received rave reviews from both countries in the music press. Britain's Melody Maker called her a genius, while New Musical Express compared her debut to Patti Smith's Horses and Van Morrison's Astral Weeks. Chris Dafoe of the Globe and Mail wrote, "What emerges after a few listens is an eccentric but engaging record full of strange quirks and out-of-kilter song structures."
