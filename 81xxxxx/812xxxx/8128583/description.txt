SPORT: Six Nations Rugby Union - Ireland v England
On: BBC 1 HD   
Date: Sunday 10th February 2013 
KO Time: 15:00

Live coverage from Dublin, where Ireland are taking on England. It is ten years since England have won a Six Nations match in Dublin - that was the resounding 42-6 victory which clinched the Grand Slam in a year in which they went on to win the World Cup. Another win today would be a boost to head coach Stuart Lancaster's belief that his side are going in the right direction. But Ireland are determined to avenge last year's 30-9 defeat at Twickenham, when their forwards were steam-rollered by England's dominant pack. Match commentary comes from Eddie Butler and Brian Moore.
