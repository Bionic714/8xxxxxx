Since there were some episodes with little or no comedy even during
the first 5 years, The Colgate Comedy Hour was renamed "Colgate Variety Hour"
before its 6th and final season in 1955, which was a partial year 
-- cancelled by NBC after the Christmas show. Several of those summer episodes
were hosted by film actor Charlton Heston, Jack Webb, etc and 
the comedy shows by Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy (none of which I've seen).

This 6th Season opener is an entertaining season opener with Dean & Jerry doing a game show parody that in one way won't be dated because of the huge prize
offered : $64 million (!!) , a parody of "The $64,000 Question" .
