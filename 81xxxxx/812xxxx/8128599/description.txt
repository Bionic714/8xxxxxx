He was born in Lima, Peru and raised in Harlem, New York.[2] Most of his lyrics focus on controversial issues in global politics.

Immortal Technique has voiced a desire to retain control over his production,[3] and has stated in his music that record companies, not artists themselves, profit the most from mass production and marketing of music.
