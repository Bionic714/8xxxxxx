COI (Classic on Intel), Emulator, zero-install Sheepshaver, pre-configured/just run


Mac OS9 environment for Intel macs (10.4 through 10.6.8 tested, should work with 10.7/8 but untested right now).

for running your old games (like the "A-10" warthog flight sim posted recently.

runs fine on my 8-core macpro (10.6.8 most of the time)
(this is a repack of my "Chubby Bunny" 4.0.1 COI (Classic on Intel) that is now in a smaller 7z rather than the original zip. 

The emulator is essentially "sheepshaver" but does not need configuration, and can be run from anywhere. Blank disks that automount in os9 are provided to put your old os9 apps.
