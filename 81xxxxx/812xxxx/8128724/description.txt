Broadway Bill (1934)

I'm re-uploading this, as I think I downloaded it from here before, but it seems to have disappeared...:^)

Medium quality, looks like it's been cropped slightly top and bottom, pretty good picture.

Director: Frank Capra

Starring:
- Warner Baxter
- Myrna Loy
- Walter Connolly

This was later remade in 1950 as Riding High, starring Bing Crosby, with Highland Dale as the horse, aka Fury in the 1950s Western of the same name.
