Review from the attendee who provided this show:

Once in a lifetime! Pre-Mule set, those in attendance at Red Rocks tonight were treated to 
an unbelievable set of acoustic music from Gregg Allman and Warren Haynes. ┬ôRare┬ö does not 
aptly describe this night, nor does brilliant, moving, soulful; or any other adjective one 
can conjure. Midnight Rider was the first dish served and was followed by Come & Go Blues. 
Old Before My Time and Come On In To My Kitchen both raised the hair on the back of my neck 
as well as many others' too. Beautiful in its simplicity and stirring in its power, this set 
is truly one of the highlights of both Messrs. Haynes' and Allman's career.
