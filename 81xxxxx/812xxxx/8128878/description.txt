You have to do itΓÇª you might as well enjoy it
 No one likes a pushy, smarmy salesman ΓÇô no one wants to be that guy ... but most of us need to sell to some extent. How else can we get any business? We all have to do it now, whether we're lawyers, accountants or start-ups. But don't despair ΓÇô there's no need to go on some cringey sales training day. 
 How to be Great at the Stuff You Hate shows you how to develop all the skills you need to sell yourself, your business and your ideas. So ditch the dread, forget the fear and start enjoying yourself! Selling isn't something you 'do' to people, it's not some dark art practised by pushy and manipulative people ΓÇô it's a process, it's a relationship ... it's fun! All you need to do is cut the crap, be yourself and win some business.

 How to be Great at the Stuff You Hate shows you how to:

 Pull together a target list ΓÇô who do you want to approach and do business with?
 Connect with those people ΓÇô writing letters/emails
 Master meeting and networking ΓÇô conquering small talk!
 Follow up once youΓÇÖve chatted to someoneAsk for what you want
