Greatest Hits (2013)




As a story, JewelΓÇÖs origin is impossible to beat: on her way up, the singer/songwriter lived in a van on the West Coast, struggling to find an entrance to a career as a professional musician. This hardscrabble tale, only enhanced by her Alaskan upbringing, stood in direct contrast to the sweet, gentle hits ΓÇ£Who Will Save Your Soul,ΓÇ¥ ΓÇ£You Were Meant for Me,ΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£Foolish GamesΓÇ¥ from her 1995 debut Pieces of You, songs that never suggested a tough background. Nevertheless, Jewel's sensitive side and blue-collar beginnings served her well over the years: once her books of poetry started to fade and her pop makeover fizzled, she was able to capitalize on her back-story and refashion herself as a modern country singer.
