,Bzbstxi,2013-02-23T16:58Z,"Hi there. I'd like to chip in so that the person who made the subtitles for this version can get an English lesson.
I prefer to use subtitles when watching most movies, either in Swedish or English, since I suffer from impaired hearing and which makes it difficult for me at times to make out the dialogue when there's a lot of other noise in the background. (Score, effects, etc. that are too loud)
But even I can see/hear the rather large discrepancies between the dialogue and the subtitles here.
A/V-wise the quality is ok for the filesize.
But if you want/need the subtitles, look for them elsewhere or download a different release alltogether."
