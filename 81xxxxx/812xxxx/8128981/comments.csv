,Treutiger,2013-02-11T18:42Z,I had catastrophic syncing issues. The video lagged 10-15 s after the audio.
,el_presidente_djc,2013-02-21T21:32Z,@Treutiger - then change your catastrophic setup you muppet. What a ridiculous comment. EZTV is the standard by which all uploads are MEASURED. No-one has done more for the PB and torrent community. What an asinine comment. Cringeworthy. At the risk of repeating myself . . . MUPPET! And dare I add . . . Muppet? Umm have U heard of VLC maybe? Or are you running Windows 98 and using IE3 with Media Player 5?
