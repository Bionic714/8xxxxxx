,Durrani,2013-02-11T06:22Z,I read that the show got cancelled and this will be the last season. Im not disappointed as I believe this show should have ended in Season 3.

,supersage,2013-02-18T17:43Z,"Don't listen to initiateve. This is episode 5x02 of the UK series, not the US series. At least know what the fuck you're talking about before making an accusation like that."
