[T],MrUnpopular,2013-02-11T04:13Z,"Jeeze you're quick.

Outta curiosity do you seed this from your home or do you somehow upload 4 GB to a seedbox within 12 minutes?"
,xKromatics,2013-02-11T04:16Z,"Wow, you got this up quick. Thanks! I'll be seeding this for a while."
,mr_maps,2013-02-11T04:17Z,much appreciated!
,kevinmuff,2013-02-11T04:18Z,Is this one real?

,chutch1122,2013-02-11T04:22Z,Will seed on my seedbox

,madmuscles,2013-02-11T04:31Z,thanks
,Fleoaky,2013-02-11T04:32Z,"IT IS AND AD!!!!!!!!
DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!!"
,zombeeees,2013-02-11T04:34Z,why is this 4 and a half gigs and 1080i?
[V],SecTPB,2013-02-11T04:36Z,"@Skymocker
No problem."
,mpnb,2013-02-11T04:36Z,thanks
[V],SecTPB,2013-02-11T04:36Z,"@MrUnpopular
It's a home connection. 5MB/s."
,Puma__84,2013-02-11T04:37Z,Is this fake?
[T],MrUnpopular,2013-02-11T04:41Z,"Damn I wish I had 5 mb, I get 600 kb/s upload @ home. No wonder you can afford to seed this out quickly.

@everyone It's not fake, and it's 1080i for those who want the real experience, not encoded scene sd/720p x264 releases."
,Slickteddy,2013-02-11T04:44Z,Is it me or there is no seed yet?
,chrisbog,2013-02-11T04:45Z,Downloading now. Will be seeding from my server when finished.
,poijhbn,2013-02-11T04:47Z,"These aren't fake, but the video quality is awful. I guess the audio makes up most of the size."
,hayate197,2013-02-11T04:48Z,lol
,stropheum,2013-02-11T04:51Z,Downloading now. What's the deal with the file size though?
,Triton8719,2013-02-11T05:08Z,"5 MB/s...now if only the DL speed matched your UL speed...been downloading this for the past hour and haven't broke 400 kb/s, but Skyfall is at 1.2 MB/s DL -.- This better be legit..."
,CapPanda,2013-02-11T05:09Z,SecTPB is a VIP user; you cannot become a VIP if you put up fake torrents.  Ergo I know this is legit even without dling it.
,Triton8719,2013-02-11T05:11Z,"5 MB/s...now only if the DL came even close to your UL speed. Been at this for over an hour now and haven't broke 400 kb/s...currently at 255 kb/s, when Skyfall is at 1.2 MB/s DL speed -.- Either its a fake or fucking no one is seeding. "
,Triton8719,2013-02-11T05:13Z,"@ CapPanda...I've seen VIPs UL shit before, not saying Sky is, just saying...it happens."
,KGBMICHEL,2013-02-11T05:13Z,Is REAL! But is in .TS you have to get the codec. Windows media player runs.
[T],MrUnpopular,2013-02-11T05:15Z,"Seeders: 343
Leechers: 1759

that's why your download is slow, be patient."
,Triton8719,2013-02-11T05:16Z,"@CapPanda...VIP honestly doesn't mean too much. I've seen VIPs UL either complete shit or fakes. Not saying Skymocker is or does, I'm just saying. And ffs, will people please seed -.-"
,Duffman59000,2013-02-11T05:18Z,as soon as i get a download of this i will upload for a while. im running 65 Mbps up
,theshape31,2013-02-11T05:22Z,"Thank you so much for sharing!

And just so everyone knows, these releases are legit.  This person uploads this exact quality quite often, and is very trustworthy.

Enjoy!"
[V],SecTPB,2013-02-11T05:23Z,"@MrUnpopular
Believe it or not, this is cheaper than my old ISP.
My old ISP gave me 4MB/s down, 190kbps up. $40 cheaper now with all this extra stuff(TV, Phone, blah). Now I have 10.5MB/s down, 5MB/s up, and about 200 more TV channels. I have zero idea why I didn't upgrade years ago. I'm only paying $163 a month for 1000 TV channels, digital phone, and this internet, opposed to the $200 before. "
[V],SecTPB,2013-02-11T05:38Z,The seed to leech ratio is actually much more than TPB says it is. TPB lies: http://pictat.com/i/2013/2/11/41943untitled1.jpg
[T],MrUnpopular,2013-02-11T05:58Z,"Dang, that's quite the steal. I'm jealous haha.

TPB stats are usually updated every little while as I'm sure you know so it probably just updated when there was the almost 2k leechers but your client (uTorrent I'm guessing) keeps updating more often than TPB.

Anyway thanks for the 1080 upload."
,Triton8719,2013-02-11T06:10Z,"Sad faced panda =( There's one low quality torrent with like 20k seeds 40k+ leeches and I'm getting a 500+ kb/s DL on it, this has dropped to under 200. Unfortunatly the other one will be done first...I'll keep DLing this though and seed it while I'm at work tomorrow to keep the HQ stuff rolling. I was hoping to see the HQ tonight thought. The last seed count I saw on this was around 150 ='/ Slackers!"
,Rj13,2013-02-11T06:27Z,"What's the file? MP4, AVI, what?"
,Duffman59000,2013-02-11T06:54Z,is there any guide or pointers where i can get fast upload speeds? firewall config ect... i have a huge connection (150/65) but never seem to seed more than 2MBps (16Mbps)
,ironymon,2013-02-11T07:08Z,"Whatever youre paying, they are ripping you off big time. Satellite tv 5000 hq channels are basically free, you just have to buy a satellite and all that crap, internet 10mb down 2mb up to offsea 200mb down 50mb up inside and all that for, less than $20, so u pay 200 i pay 20 and we get the same services, europe isnt ripping people off."
,ironymon,2013-02-11T07:33Z,"Oh, if u happen to live in usa, usa has a big ass dept to everyone, so it's normal if u pay 10 times more than what people in euro pay."
,Wacklyn,2013-02-11T15:54Z,Video keeps skipping. Shit download. Don't bother. 
[V],SecTPB,2013-02-11T17:13Z,Don't worry about Wacklyn's comment. They're obviously having an issue with their computer and are upset. Just remember to enable Deinterlacing in your players and use IVTC(Film) if available. Using yadif isn't bad either.
,Permaclok,2013-02-12T06:56Z,"@Duffman59000

What BitTorrent software do you use ? You can set your uploading speed to its limit in the options, and bear in mind that s 65megaBITS per second in a P2P environment would offer a transfer speed of a maximum of roughly 8 megaBYTES per second. Even if they are both Mbps, it is not the same thing at all."
,MustafaHH,2013-02-12T09:51Z,@SecTPB can you list the series you are going to release beside TWD?
[V],SecTPB,2013-02-13T04:15Z,"@MustafaHH
It's whatever I feel like capping. But definite caps are Dexter, The Walking Dead, True Blood, Game of Thrones and American Horror Story. Those are my main shows that aren't MMA-related."
,Leopardi,2013-02-14T19:14Z,There is a problem with these releases... no subtitles are compatible with them. So basically I downloaded 4GB's worth of junk.
[V],SecTPB,2013-02-15T02:26Z,"@Leopardi
So, it's junk because there's no subtitle file with it? Really? I heard of stupid crap, but that takes the cake. Haha. Learn to use subtitles."
,Knan4051,2013-04-17T00:53Z,Correct me if I'm wrong but I thought 1080p was superior to 1080i
