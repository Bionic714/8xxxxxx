Idiot, if everyone who d/l this were to seed at 50 Kb, that's a far better ratio than most torrents see.

People, upload whatever you can.  The wonderful thing about torrents is it isn't a point to point connection, that your client can aggregate 100 different seeders easily which at 50 Kb per,  would be 5 MBps, you'd have the whole thing in 1.2 minutes.

The WORST thing is to discourage people."

,HKCannibal,2013-02-11T06:42Z,"There is a certain amount of individuals that shames us the real users of p2p, people who come with the mentality of hosting servers, where they think it is only clicking a few buttons, and awaiting your download, without doing anything in return.
As stated above, regardless of your speed, be it 50k, 500k, 5000k uplolad of no matter, what should be valued and prioritized, is that everyone does their contribution to maintain the operation of the entire network, because if not there is this, there is no torrent, and we will again rely on third party services to our downloads."

Tell me, Mr. MickThomps, you getting paid for this idiotic and misleading message? If so, do the morons paying you believe this kind of lame, braindead, tactic will dissuade us from downloading? 

THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO PASSWORD.

Makes it all more enjoyable knowing there are brainless fossils like yourself watching us share all your copyrighted shit, getting all riled up, thinking you can stop the internet development, file sharing, the free culture movement with some lame bashing and a pitful attempt at counterpropaganda.
