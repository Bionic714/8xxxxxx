Companies will not provide their employers with healthcare and take the $2000 fine for each employee that averages over 30 hours. People won't take the health care because no longer is an individual disqualified for a preexisting condition. When a person does need coverage, he or she will just sign up for health care that day and receive coverage. Furthermore, insurance companies will no longer get their claim money because The Accountable Care Organizations (ACO's) causes doctors and hospitals to receive the money. Thee insurance company becomes merely a shell transferring the collected premium from insured to the ACO. Also, overages will become more standardized. It's likely that private health care companies will go out of business and merge together, and eventually the government and hospitals will replace these companies. Thus creating one health care coverage.
