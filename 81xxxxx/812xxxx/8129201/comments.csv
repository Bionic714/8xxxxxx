,tastyfreeze,2013-02-11T04:48Z,Thank You
,bobert-bobert,2013-02-11T04:51Z,Dibya to the rescue!  Thanks man!
,stropheum,2013-02-11T04:52Z,"Can this be confirmed real? Downloading atm, will report back soon"
,flynhox,2013-02-11T04:54Z,is this real ?
,Extinct89,2013-02-11T04:58Z,THANKSSSS
,stropheum,2013-02-11T05:14Z,Any deal on the validity of this?
,spanish_ruler,2013-02-11T05:17Z,DL now at 100 kb/s :( hope we can build this one faster soon :( we need more seeders 
,injectr,2013-02-11T05:38Z,"This is Dibya, of course if fucken real.  You dont belong here if you have to ask if this is real.  "
,budskee,2013-02-11T05:45Z,Thanks man. I appreciate all you uploaders do. Especially how quickly you do it. A 720p video less than 2 gigs in size 12 minutes after the episode airs? That's freaking astonishing man. On behalf of all the people who download this but don't have accounts to express their thanks.  Thank you.
,PAuLo96,2013-02-11T05:56Z,Awesome! Thanks :D
,Knan4051,2013-02-11T06:25Z,Yeah when was the last time you downloaded a fake torrent from a green skull no less. 
,belrazor,2013-02-11T07:02Z,"Actually, these 2 have green skulls & are fake/password spam:
fake: http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8129192/The_Walking_Dead_S03E09_HDTV_x264-2HD
fake: http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8129162/The.Walking.Dead.S03E09.HDTV.x264-2HD"
,belrazor,2013-02-11T07:04Z,I guess we'll remember to wait for ETTV/EZTV torrents all the rest are the sux.
,belrazor,2013-02-11T07:06Z,"Really? Another crap torrent? Twice the size, half the quality..."
,spanish_ruler,2013-02-11T07:21Z,THX A LOT DIBYA THIS TURNED OUT TO BE A GREAT TORRENT AND VERY VERY WATCHABLE :) THX ALOT UR A SAVIOR :) 
,belrazor,2013-02-11T07:22Z,"EVOLVE just posted another torrent tagged w/ EZTV, hopefully it is not fake like this one & the prev UL. But, it probably a copy of ETTV's, so just get it from them."
,budskee,2013-02-11T08:12Z,"belrazor, 

This is not a fake torrent. I don't know what your motivations are by you calling it a fake, and won't speculate as to what they might be. but it's real, and high quality. belrazor, you've just lost all credibility as a commenter. "
,tipsyxla,2013-02-11T08:55Z,I do trust this Dibya fellow...belrazor sounds a lil suspicious
,Whuutz,2013-02-11T13:17Z,"when do you think he will release the 1080p download? usually they booth come out the same day, but this waiting is killing me :S"
,Memejobim,2013-02-11T16:54Z,Someone send the password?
,lucaslks,2013-02-11T19:29Z,".RAR password protected. There's a link to get the password, but it doesn't work.
So, why the hell did you put a password when there's a lot of others torrents out there without password? That's just stupid man."
,conswella,2013-02-11T21:05Z,"As this is downloading, i am looking at the file contents of the torrent, and it is an MKV file, not some cancer .rar file, so this might work. i will not be bothered to confirm whether it does or not."
,pp_losabe,2013-02-11T21:07Z,fake
,TheBestGamer,2013-02-11T23:19Z,need more seeders........ it takes so long .....
,trblewalkn,2013-02-17T05:24Z,Will you alsobe uploading the Black & White versions of season 1 that AMC started airing last Thursday? The first 2 episodes were even creepier than before
