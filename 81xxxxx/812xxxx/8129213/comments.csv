Duration: 1 hour

Colin Murray introduces highlights from the day's two Premier League fixtures, along with all the goals from Saturday's eight matches.

Everton caused a stir when they beat Manchester United 1-0 in their opening match of the season, and David Moyes's side have gone on to show that the victory was no fluke. But that was on their home turf - how will they fare at Old Trafford?

Aston Villa suffered a 1-0 defeat in their season opener away at West Ham, who they now face again. Things have not got much easier for the West Midlands side, although they could take hope from the fact that they did the double over the Hammers last season, thanks to Gabriel Agbonlahor's injury-time winner at Upton Park."
