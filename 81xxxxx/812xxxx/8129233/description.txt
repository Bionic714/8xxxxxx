Sara Pezzini moved to Chicago to escape her failures and to leave her demons behind her in New York. Her new life in the Windy City has been far more difficult and far stranger than she ever expected. Until now, her past has stayed buried. But when Rapture bearer Tom Judge and Darkness bearer Jackie Estacado come a knocking, Sara risks the discovery that her new life in Chi-town may not have been a decision that she made for herself.
