,vocalised80,2013-02-11T11:50Z,"After all this time the above is true peeps.

In and out of focus every time something moves...

which is a lot in a zombie movie, I've watched a lot.

I am waiting for another copy, first time i've said this.

A/4 V/4-5 for a cam "
,vocalised80,2013-02-11T12:12Z,"Apparently IPASuperior is over laying new English
Audio to an Italian Cam which should not have the
same auto focus problems.

I look forward to this, as I'm aware this should be
tomorrow night, cheers IPASuperior, everyone should wait for this as this one is annoying."
,IPASuperior,2013-02-11T15:00Z,"You want the English audio over the italian cam? 

Ok. But let me warn you: the filmed kept moving in the beginning. Lol. 

I'll get on it around 5pm MST though. :P"
