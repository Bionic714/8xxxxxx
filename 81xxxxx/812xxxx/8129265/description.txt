As a founding member of FRIGHTWIG back in the halcyon days of punk rock clangor, and a member of THE MUDWIMIN, Mama Mia d'Bruzzi (aka Mia Simmans/Mia Levin) was a major bi-coastal force blazing the trail for every riot-grrrl rocker you ever heard of. Her new solo effort THE IMPERATIVE showcases a nicely matured but still energetic style that rocks expertly between hard and sweet without falling prey to the usual tough-girl singer-songwriter clich√©s.

Maybe it's because she's no little girl. Mama d'Bruzzi is all woman and has nothing to prove to you; she's already proven it with a solid career as a pioneer of ovaries-to-the-wall hard rocking. If you're a fan of the riot-grrrl aesthetic then you're in her debt already even if you've never heard her sing or play a note.

Lyrically, d'Bruzzi is genuine as hell. She sings immediacies ripped straight from real life in a rich, pure, contralto with masterful inflection, layered on top of ass-kicking guitar-driven arrangements with the kind of tasteful restraint only the very seasoned can deliver. It's a rugged and tender ride; every sentiment sounds real, and every note sounds necessary.

You're gonna like this album.
