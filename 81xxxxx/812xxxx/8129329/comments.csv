,belrazor,2013-02-11T07:20Z,"Although I already got the real torrent from the original ULer (ETTV/ExtraTorrent), I hope that this one replaces the original fake torrent you guys (EVOLVE) ULed earlier..."
,DoodleBop,2013-02-11T07:41Z,"Nice job retard .. 2 hours for nothing. File is corrupted, don't download this. After 2 seconds it just freez, tested in many players (WMP, VLC, MPC, etc..)."

Boring episode!"
,Richaod,2013-02-11T14:07Z,"For some reason I got a RAR file too, with a link that forces you to take a spammy survey to get the password... Something's fishy - make sure you're not getting a RAR before you download"
,trixrabbit13,2013-02-11T14:07Z,@jhonje123-- i think the password is jhonje123 is a dumb bitch
,steaz55,2013-02-11T14:44Z,"It's a freaking MKV file:

Look at 'Files' on top."
,Hancock79,2013-02-11T14:54Z,"DoodleBop is the most obnoxious person on this site, always can't get something to work or bragging about his PC.  shut the fuck up already."

,marcusk95,2013-02-11T15:13Z,"Guys, this is a legit MKV file, either you did something wrong or you got another torrent and just think it was this that you downloaded. (Since there's one with an identical name but from another uploader that is fake)

This one is real. EZTV is well known."
,waldorfx,2013-02-11T15:14Z,English subtitles here: http://www.correctsubs.com/The.Walking.Dead.S03E09.720p.HDTV.x264-EVOLVE.srt
,Twiddler_13,2013-02-11T15:33Z,It's a .MKV file unless you clicked on the wrong thing like a moron.
,killerh77,2013-02-11T15:39Z,Password?? Please!!!
,volberfloripa,2013-02-11T16:23Z,"Faz mais de 2 horas que baixei essa merda de torrent e não conseguí baixar nem 0,1% ainda,
lixo de torrent mesmo, não vale a perda de tempo de entrar nessa merda de site e ainda ter que ficar bloqueando um popup por click e ter o avast bloqueando vírus e malware que essa bosta de site tenta instalar nos nossos micros.
Viva o B*I*T*S*O*U*P*.*O*R*G,
Não tem vírus, popup e ainda baixa tudo na velocidade máxima da conexão."
,since1871,2013-02-11T17:01Z,Thanks
,devilsylar,2013-02-11T18:14Z,"Instead of SAYING shit like ""OHH GREAT TORRENT, OHHH WORKS FINE"" why dont you guys shut the hell up and give us the DAMN password for this SHITTY file ? IT'S A PASSWORDED .RAR, DON'T DOWNLOAD IT !!!!"
,devilsylar,2013-02-11T18:15Z,"DONT DOWNLOAD IT, .RAR PASSWORD ARCHIVE"
,TaylorBA,2013-02-11T18:35Z,"Perfectly fine, it's a MKV not rar and doesn't have a password.

Only thing is I'm not sure why it is 1.8GB for 720p vid."
,bluepen,2013-02-11T18:39Z,"I saw the comments about rar password issues, so I clicked on the ""Files"" up above - nah, it's an mkv, no prob > downloaded. And I'm essentially a n00b re most computer issues. I do know how to read and google, though."
,FagnerEvans,2013-02-11T18:44Z,What's the password ?
,castielq,2013-02-11T18:58Z,Thanks eztv !
,CampyCamper,2013-02-11T19:13Z,"great torrent.

@TaylorBA because it's not complete garbage quality like lots of the stuff that gets uploaded to TPB by people who don't know what they're doing."
,chaser469,2013-02-11T19:19Z,"Some asshole uploaded a torrent by the exact same title and rar'd with a pass. This is EZTV and you can download with confidence. 

Thank you EZTV!"
,railgun1,2013-02-11T19:22Z,"Excellent quality single MKV file, thanks!"
,krikri3,2013-02-11T19:30Z,thank god for TPB
,HungryPirate667,2013-02-11T19:36Z,"Those that accidentally downloaded a "".rar"", 2 words: Chrome + Ad-blocker.
Click on the number next to ""Files"" (at the top) to see what file this is... a mkv."
,Mercury8215,2013-02-11T20:34Z,This IS a real mkv video file.  But it should be noted that passworded rar files are fakes.  Don't waste your time looking for a password.  Just download a different torrent.
,krikri3,2013-02-11T21:26Z,only retards download movies contained in a .RAR file
,ChristineA,2013-02-11T22:05Z,"I don't think I'd ever say this, but it won't download.. Please seed!"
,yousefak,2013-02-11T22:30Z,The torrent is uploaded by eztv... He has a skull next to his name... you'd have to be a downie to think that this is fake
,waldorfx,2013-02-11T22:59Z,English subtitles here : http://www.correctsubs.com/The.Walking.Dead.S03E09.720p.HDTV.x264-EVOLVE.srt
,richkla,2013-02-11T23:14Z,"agreed with yousefak. 
but it's not only eztv has a green skull beside 'his' name > 'he' will have it for next 15, 30, 50... yrs. 
These kids today don't even have a clue who ez is & what rep. 'he' has. their comments say enough about them and also their knowledge of usin tpb web site. 
NEWBIES ; 
1 CLICK ON THE NUMBER OF FILES IN THE INFO & IT WILL SHOW U WHAT THIS (& EVERY OTHER) TORRENT CONSISTS OF
THNX eztv"
,77Monk77,2013-02-12T01:20Z,"retards need to stop commenting stupid shit. Its EZTV, download 100% with confidence. "
,edudoiu,2013-02-12T02:38Z,"QUAL É A SENHA? 
WHAT IS THE PASSWORD?"
,Shanzig007,2013-02-12T02:43Z,"The Download is fast and the file is just fine! Dont listen to those DWEEBS saying its a passworded rar.  If you look at the files, it will show the file name. NO RAR. Thanks for the upload."
,nemesis832,2013-02-12T02:52Z,FAKE! NOT download.
,___k,2013-02-12T02:59Z,"Those users who find that they've got a RAR: this is *not* the same torrent.

Hash for this version:

You aren't imagining, just check the file list as several others have recommended. :D"
,LenintheGreat,2013-02-12T03:06Z,"Its an mkv, I dont know why people are whining about a password..."
,bruno5379,2013-02-12T04:31Z,I call BS. Uploader claim this to be HD 720p but his shit dont look any better than the standart definition 400mb torrent.
,Wolfcock,2013-02-12T10:22Z,"This upload is legit, no .rar's or anything bullcrap.

A: 8.5
V: 8.5

Thanks to the uploader, this torrent is real, people."
,SlashBlack,2013-02-12T12:06Z,"file works fine, these dumbasses just don't know how to play a video."
,Damien74,2013-02-12T14:17Z,"eztv never shared a fake or password protected file. Atleast I never came across one in the past 2+ years. There was a passworded release from another user that some seem to confuse with this. 
There are also people on here that tries to give the trusted users a bad reputation to get people to download their releases instead. 
eztv is one of the top 3 uploaders on PB, without a doubt and has been for a LONG time."
,weezarc,2013-02-12T17:27Z,"I too first downloaded the password prompting RAR file Sunday night which apparently was wrong so downloaded this version yesterday which is legit.  My problem is that the audio is much more quiet than usual (feel like this has happened in the past before also), anyone else notice this?"
,jaywars,2013-02-12T18:47Z,oh yes! thanks a lot! walkers back!

,krikri3,2013-02-13T14:23Z,"I refuse to believe people are that stupid.. password in a .mkv file? virus in a video file?

I'm sure these are RIAA/MPAA bastards. I'd butcher them all after butchering their families"
,silas420,2013-02-15T21:26Z,"I have no intention of jumping through hoops to play a file. I will no longer download torrents from you EZTV, and I hope others will follow."
,Wiseguydude,2013-02-18T09:14Z,OMG I just downloaded this file in record time. I opened up utorrent and started browsing reddit. After about 10 minutes i went to check how much is left and I was already seeding it.
,Lennartboyy,2013-03-12T17:05Z,Thx! Great upload (as always)
