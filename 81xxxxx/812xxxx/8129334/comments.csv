,belrazor,2013-02-11T07:16Z,The original file DL from this link is not the same one ULed earlier. Guess they had to wait for ETTV to UL a real torrent for them to copy.
,kattallia,2013-02-11T07:41Z,I have just started downloading but i will either confirm of deny this password rubbish. If this is a lie you guys need to find a better past time
,Serpentinex,2013-02-11T08:28Z,"Confirmed no password, don't know why anyone would think VTV put a password on a torrent."
,iamchrislechat,2013-02-11T10:42Z,"it's a single mp4 file
can't be passworded
in other words go fuck yourself spammers"
,IzayaOrihara,2013-02-11T11:27Z,"This doesn't ask for a password. It's an Mp4 file, not archived. The uploader is VIP, there are over 40,000 people on this torrent at the time of this post. 

If it was truly password protected and fake, it wouldn't attract so many people. "
[V],rajabmm,2013-02-11T12:20Z,i have no idea why commenting like that...this is another beautiful upload from VTV...thax alot for sharing :)
,ajca320,2013-02-11T13:36Z,NO password. I trust VTV uploads.
,kattallia,2013-02-11T13:58Z,I really dont get why people are trying to tarnish VTV's name. I have checked the download and it works perfectly as usual
[T],YahSoft,2013-02-11T14:47Z,"VTV, the best, ever!"
,ajkclay,2013-02-11T14:53Z,"It works fine, no password, don't believe the bull."

,Shanzig007,2013-02-12T02:44Z,"The Download is fast and the file is just fine! Dont listen to those DWEEBS saying its a passworded rar.  If you look at the files, it will show the file name. NO RAR. Thanks for the upload."
,brohken,2013-02-12T13:19Z,"no pass needed, stupid spammers/shills for media companies/stupid windows users with infected computers

VTV rocks!"
,Dr_Science,2013-02-12T19:29Z,"Russel09, I couldn't disagree more. This was a horribly boring episode that simply echoes themes that numerous previous episodes laid out.

SPOILER ALERT!!!!

Ok I get it, people are scared, hungry and feral. nothing happened in this episode. Woodbury is still in shambles with no advancement towards retaliation. Rick's group is still falling apart with the new baby.  Glen and Maggie aren't talking? that makes no sense. Tyrese and his group were talking about joining up the whole episode just to be told to ""get out"".  oh and a whole new thing happened...rick saw lori...oh wait that happened already with the whole phone thing.

just a tired episode of light build up for the next installment.  the only real thing of note is merle and daryl running off together.  and that is lame for the flow of the show."
[H],shirepirate,2013-03-23T02:31Z,"there is no password on this torrent. do not comment on a torrent saying something bad about it unless you are SURE it is the torrent you downloaded, this goes for ANYONE."
