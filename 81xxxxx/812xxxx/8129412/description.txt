Audible Rip

 The Voice from the Edge: Pretty Maggie Moneyeyes (Library Edition) [Unabridged] [Audio CD] 

For the third time, down that multi-colored rabbit hole to the unpredictable, singular, frequently disturbing Ellison Wonderland of the writer the New York Times summed up thus: 'Harlan Ellison has the spellbinding quality of a great nonstop talker with a cultural warehouse for a mind.' And this third expedition comes not a moment too soon. . . at exactly the moment a brilliant new film documentary, Dreams with Sharp Teeth, a film of the life and work of Harlan Ellison is beginning it s premieres across America.
Here, in eleven stories, a true memoir, five brand-new commentaries, and a linked horror story of Jack the Ripper by Ellison s great friend, the late Robert Bloch, the mesmerizing audio performance by the Author provides full measure of reason why Ellison has won Listen Up, Audio, and a shelf full of other awards including investiture as one of the few Grand Masters of the literature of the fantastic. This one is the best yet.
