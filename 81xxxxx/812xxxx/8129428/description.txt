├änglag├Ñrd, pronounced 'Engla-gord', frequently written with the accents wrong, or just missing. Strictly speaking, they shouldn't even file under 'A'; in Swedish they file at the end of the alphabet, but I think that may be taking authenticity a tad too far. Anyway, in the progressive world, ├änglag├Ñrd are a complete phenomenon; a band who, in the '90s, refused to acknowledge that anything had changed since, say, 1974, and who, instead of sounding curiously dated, sounded more vibrant than every Marillion-wannabee neo-prog outfit put together and stuffed into a very small space (not a bad idea, as it happens). What's more, they pretty much invented a whole new approach to progressive rock; the 'linear' technique. Write a section, play it a couple of times, change to another section, change again... Occasionally hark back to a previous part just to remind yourself that you are in the same song, but never stay on one part long enough for boredom to intervene. Many progressive fans hate them, or simply don't understand them; others found them the best thing they'd heard in fifteen years or more. (..)

Hybris is the sort of album that not only takes many plays to properly appreciate, but gives a little more away each time you play it. After literally hundreds of spins, I can still hear parts I hadn't heard before; this has to be a finite procedure, but it hasn't stopped yet... About the only downside of the album are the vocals; rather weak, falsetto-led passages coming in at odd moments, though to be fair, only three of the album's four songs have any vocal passages, and they're few and far between.
