The demon Wutung returns to Earth in a new body. He falls for the mortal Hsiao-yen who determines to redeem him with her love. But Heaven deems the liaison forbidden and two fairies are dispatched down to Earth. They kill Hsiao-yen and reincarnate her soul in the body of the just born child Fang Yu-yin. Angered, Wutung, in conjunction with a female demon, unleashes his lusts and wreaks havoc everywhere. The village of Yeng Fueh strikes a bargain with him, offering him a virgin each month to satiate his appetites. But then the grown Yu-yin is chosen as one of the virgin brides. However the mortal Shan-ken, who desires her, rescues her back, but in doing so affects a mortal blow on Wutung. As Wutung recuperates, he sends his female partner into the village to abduct Yu-yin and bring her back to be his bride.
