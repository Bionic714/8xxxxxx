Jay and Frank are buddies who have always worked and flown by their own rules, but when they agree to fly two Cessna crop dusters from San Fransisco, California to New Zeeland, Jay's wife, who has just announce that she is expecting their first baby, has one message for her husband: It's time to grow up! But the job offers a big pay-off that Jay just can't turn down, so off they go on the island-hopping oddessey from San Fransisco to Hawaii to Pago Pago to Norfolk Island to New Zeeland. But when Frank's plane crashes on take-off from Pago Pago, Jay is forced to solo from there. When night falls and sleep overtakes him, he wakes to find himself hopelessly lost somewhere over the vast Pacific. When he radios in a Mayday it's a race against time, fuel, and oncoming darkness for Captain Gordon Vette, the pilot aboard Auckland Flight 308, a commercial jet and the only other aircraft in the region, to find the little plane and rescue Jay.
