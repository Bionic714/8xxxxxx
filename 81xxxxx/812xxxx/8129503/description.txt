
The Complete 'Court of Owls' and 'Night of the Owls' Batman Cross Over Event
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

This is the first time I've put a torrent together. I saw that there was no decent attempt at completely covering both 'Court of Owls' and 'Night of the Owls' out there, so here it is.

I didn't scan any of these myself, just rearranged a bunch of scans from a bunch of sources. All credit goes to the original scanners whose individual efforts I've left on each file [Except One Unknown]. As is always the case, if you like what you read, go out and support the comic book industry by buying it!

All of this is extensively in the 'Read Me' files with the pack but what the heck...

Included Files:
``````````````` 
~ All-Star Western #09 - #12
~ Batgirl #09
~ Batman #01 - #12 + #00
~ Batman & Robin #09
~ Batman Annual #01
~ Batman: The Dark Knight #09
~ Batwing #09
~ Birds of Prey #09
~ Catwoman #09
~ Detective Comics #09
~ Justice League #08
~ Nightwing #01 - #09
~ Red Hood & The Outlaws #09


The Reading Order:
``````````````````
First there's 'Court of Owls' which is a prelude to the cross over event 'Night of the Owls'. Night of the Owls is tricky in that it splits the story up in hours, so the more adventurous amongst you might want to read the event in complete chronological order by jumping between books. If that is something you fancy, or if that sounds like too much hassle, whatever, I've included two Reading Orders. A simple one with the books in a "close as possible" line up, and a more complex one that jumps between books, following the action in time chronological order.

The files for 'Night of the Owls' are sorted as listed in the Simple reading order, you'll have to do the issue jumping, if you choose to do so, yourself. I have tried to make it as easy as possible for you without cutting up the book's files.

Any errors or suggested improvements in the reading order(s)? Let me know in the comments.

Lastly, I've also thrown in Batman #12 and the Batman #00 zero issue so that anyone planning on reading this and then going straight into the 'Death of the Family' cross over afterwards can do just that. :)

Lastly, part two :/ ... Keep seeding it please folks. Let's get this thing some momentum so that more people can enjoy this kick ass story!

Lastly III, eeesh... I'm putting together a Before Watchmen pack that arranges all of the books in order of both release (and therefore back-up story) order, and in individual character title order at the same time. As soon as the eventual last book is released I'll get that finished and posted too. Enjoy.
