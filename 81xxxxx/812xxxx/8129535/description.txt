'Owls' is LUIK's beautiful dark debut album. Full of whispering slowcore where leafs permanently seem to fall of trees, cars always have a flat tire and a lift-off seems impossible. The band around Lukas Dikker presents a mix of softly picked guitars, pressing bass and whistling vocals with a touch of melancholy, moody vibes. 

The band has been praised in the underground, and now released an album that can match the likes of Beach House, Julian Lynch, Low or Sparklehorse.
