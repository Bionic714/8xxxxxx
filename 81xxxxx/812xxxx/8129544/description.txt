Originally released in 1974, "It'll Shine When It Shines" is the band's second recording on the A&M label. Highly unlike their first self-titled album, no fancy studio in England or anywhere was used during the recording of this title. Instead, the sessions took place in an old pre-Cevil War farmhouse near Aldrich, Missouri. With the production skills of Glyn Johns and David Anderle and a mobile recording truck parked outside the farmhouse, the band was able to put together one of their most revered albums. From that session also came the group's highest charted song "Jackie Blue", which reached number three on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975. Many of their best songs came from this album, and with its release the band further achieved their recognition in popular music.

All tracks have been Digitally Re-mastered from the "Original Master Tapes".
