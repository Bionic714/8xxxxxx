,encho1989,2013-02-11T15:00Z,fuckin commercial music the real music is rock trance like three days grace metallica tiesto fuck you
,vatel88,2013-02-11T18:06Z,"@Encho Yea The Black Keys are so commercial...oh wait noT! took 5 albums before they had 1 single that the industry would play on the radio. Now people are keen to that style music again and digging it. Commercial success for an artist doesn't make them suddenly terrible that's indie hipster kid mentality which is so 10 years ago (sadly admit i was one of those kids 10 years ago). Also the artists you named off are all very commercial as they've all seen success from radio air time and didnt have to do much self promoting in their early days. Mumford and Sons did shit tons of low/no pay gigs around the UK for years before they could get an American record label to pay attention to them. Metallica got really lucky in their early days and were promoted by other people with money and signed to a label incredibly fast. Three days grace i would post grunge no where near the trance rock you think they are. And Tiesto, come on bro? seriously That's like saying ""Go listen to some Oakenfold that shit is so NOW!"" Tiesto's time has come and past.

For anyone who cares, ill be reuploading this exact same copy of the Grammy's but with just the musical performances no bullshit awards. Because honestly who gives a shit who the rich pat on the back and give awards to.

Music is an art form which is very subjective just because your personal taste do not appreciate a certain style of music or artist does make that genre or artist terrible solely based upon your opinion. "
,encho1989,2013-02-12T12:22Z,well Vatel you are right but still this music is so the same and the winners are always poplike singers 
,Adriesk,2013-02-12T21:01Z,Thank you for this upload ! I watched the entire Grammy Awards on CBSHD and I wanted to take a look back at the spectacular performances that night. Hats off to those Artists who performed.
