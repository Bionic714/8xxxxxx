Minitab is a statistical software with more experience under his belt. Instead of using text commands, Minitab prefer a completely visual style of analysis.
The number of tests and graphs Minitab offers you is remarkable. Besides the traditional descriptive statistics and multivariate analysis, Minitab offers a menu of quality tools for time series and another one dedicated to the power and sample size.
Each test is run on the data in a spreadsheet easy to edit, and the parameters are defined through dialog boxes. All the results you get will be available in the project window, in which you can integrate into a single report using ReportPad.
Minitab is a statistical software more intuitive and powerful. However, compared with SPSS or JMP, suffers from a more outdated and the lack of a powerful syntax editor.
