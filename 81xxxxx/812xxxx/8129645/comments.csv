i watched itl and all good for me and in sync

oddily not many connecting for it.. guess they dont want xvids any more?

shame I stop sharing"
[V],psspss,2013-02-11T10:25Z,"opps wrong torrent meant for walking dead lol

still why so many leechers and non sharers on this show

so few want it as well .. maybe I give up sharing this series?"

[V],psspss,2013-02-12T23:45Z,"becareful they embed hidden codes in the header so they know who bought them online now days

you always best to re-encode them atleast before sharing..

also can remove copyright tags with mkvmerge 

but also sometimes they put hidden text with dark written and dark backgrounds as well.. they do that on movies how they capture some camrippers

join torrerntfreak and read all the shit happening each day so can be imformed"

[V],psspss,2013-02-12T23:53Z,"I would call itunes more webrips then hdtv as it wasnt air-ed on tv 

but i would call them HQwebrips for High Quality
"
[V],rr-ne,2013-02-12T23:56Z,"i removed the DRM

converted them to h.264 mp4

all safe"
[V],rr-ne,2013-02-13T00:17Z,"comment--

just to read the comments cause i have to wait a while for them to show up"
[V],psspss,2013-02-13T00:59Z,"ok hope you right... I know xvid is lesser quality but cos it alters pixels like 4 from mp4 down to 1
it changes any chance of hidden codes on the credits etc

youtube rips also put in google in the header
easy to remove with the right tools
but at least its free no money trail :)

I suspect crims etc have pawn stars and will release today or capture a repeat air... best to wait 2-3 days before doing expensive routes

hey we would all buy if could.. and if it cost like $5 a season not per episode.. but thats the oldies for ya.. havent a clue what the people want in modern times"
