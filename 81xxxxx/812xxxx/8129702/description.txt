Well now this is a treat. One of 2012's biggest underground rock albums – this year's Uncle Acid and the Deadbeats, perhaps? – is the work of a deliberately enigmatic commune/collective who have supposedly built themselves some kind of snowbound psychedelic Shangri-La in a tiny village in Sweden's far north. Korpilombolo – so we are to believe – has a mysterious, long-established tradition of voodoo worship, and local priests have been serenading the townsfolk with various strains of far-out, pan-global incantations for generations; Goat are merely the current vessel for this time-honoured mystical practice, don't you know. Whatever the truth of all that, World Music sounds incredible – a pitch-perfect mix of Black Sabbath, Can, Fela Kuti, Funkadelic and the northern-lights psych of countrymen such as Pärson Sound or Träd Gräs och Stenar. It's overflowing with ingenious riffing, intoxicating chants and almighty freakouts, all with an exceptional dynamic bite and poppy concision that make it utterly accessible and head-spinningly great fun throughout. Beautifully realised, immaculately recorded, and one of the year's loveliest vinyl artefacts to boot
