"Tiny"

Kidnapped and brought to Storybrooke by Cora
the Giant unleashes his vengeance on the town
when a case of mistaken identity leads him to
try and settle an old score with David; Mr
Gold, accompanied by Emma and Henry, attempts to
depart Storybrooke hoping to keep his memory
intact when he crosses the town line -- and
heads to the airport in search of his son Bae;
and Greg questions Belle as to what she saw on
the night of his car accident. Meanwhile, in the
fairytale land that was and against his
brothers wishes, Anton, the Giant, climbs down
the beanstalk and attempts to befriend some
humans whose intentions may not be so noble
