This is a remake of Frank Capra's "Broadway Bill" from 1934. They even reused some of the scenes from the 1934 version, no big deal. Much better IMO, I like Bing's crooning....:^)

The horse's name is "Highland Dale", he's more well known as "Fury" in the 1950's Western of the same name. Also played a bit role in Oklahoma.

This is also one of three movies that Oliver Hardy acted in without his partner Stan Laurel during the 25 year period they made comedies together.
