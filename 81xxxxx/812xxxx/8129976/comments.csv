,evan747,2013-03-08T21:18Z,Yes any chance of 1303? Would greatly appreciate it! :D
,ovracvr,2013-03-09T06:20Z,I'm guessing AIRAC data packeges are getting harder to retrive these days
,jerdoxx,2013-03-14T02:08Z,"if you guys want you go guy it you douche bags, check my YT channel jerdoflight and learn "
,ovracvr,2013-03-29T20:08Z,AIRAC 1303 GOT DELETED :P
,evan747,2013-04-04T23:34Z,AIRAC 1304 would be awesome if you can get it! :D
,airbusflyer,2013-04-09T12:30Z,"Any idea why we still have no 1304? Normally it took only a few days...
Hope there are not any problems..."
,airbusflyer,2013-04-09T12:33Z,"PS: I heard they are now using a new system @Navigraph which will better save the data and try to track the buyer/uploader with a special ID etc.
But I still hope we can get a RIP or something else."
,tcas76,2013-04-09T16:26Z,"I've read as well that the files are now watermarked so that the user can be identified. 

So I guess that will be the end of the cyles here, unfortunately."
,airbusflyer,2013-04-09T20:37Z,"On the other hand I had a chat with someone and he told me following:
He gave the installer to a friend for testing how it worked. So the installer was working like it should. So the only thing could be the watermark if it comes to public.

But a RIP should be still an option as there shouldn't be a watermark!!"
,tcas76,2013-04-09T20:59Z,So let's hope for the best ;-)
,anymore2,2013-04-10T12:37Z,"I let AIRAC 1304 for you: 
"
,anymore2,2013-04-10T12:38Z,"There's link: u.ploaded.net/file/g0uhe5ds
