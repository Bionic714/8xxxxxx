DEADAPP MAGIC ACQUISITION PROUDLY PRESENTS

=================================================================

"THE" Jay Sankey Torrent. [SCROLL DOWN PAST INTRO TO SEE INDEX]

There are allot of simple effects here, but some require some serious sleight of hand rehearsal.

There is an overwhelming amount of material here.

Which is why i will introduce my highlights of this collection;

"magic vol 21" is perfect for anyone unfamiliar with Sankeys work, this DVD contains allot of Sankeys best stuff. (ISO file requires "DVD mounting software")

"best magic with ordinary objects", "no card tricks", "wrap it up", and "100 dollar miracles" are great DVDs for those interested in "non-card" magic.

"skutt sessions" and "sanders sessions" include co-hosts, they add strong effects which compare with Sankeys style nicely.

"the very best of jay sankey" within these three volumes is Sankeys best material performed in front of a live audience, and it gives you an idea of how he really performs.

"magic & comedy" discusses some comedic performance aspects, and "create your own magic" is three volumes on creativity.

check out "22 blows to the head" and "boris pocus - extremely mental" for some of the strongest mental effects Sankey has released.
