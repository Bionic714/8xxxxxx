Dr. Prober (Ron Jeremy) is a bonerfied member of the A.M.A. (Amorous Medical Association). Fire - hot nurse Lisa De Leeuw can certainly testify to that! But their carnal office shenanigans lead to the horniest mix - up ever when the good doctor accidentally diagnoses tantalizing Tisa (Nicole Black) as having only six months to live. After a hot girl-girl comforting session with her sensuous roomate Mai Lin, Tisa decides to spend her last days writing a book on hookers by becoming one herself. What a way to go! Her hands on research includes: luscious Lulu La Puta (Danielle), Cowboy Gus (Herschel Savage), a wild bachelor party orgy, and lots, lots more! Tisa's investigation is so thorough (to put it mildly!) that her subsequent book is a bawdy best-seller. But then Dr. Prober discovers his mistake! Oh well, no hard feelings... or maybe there are!!! Tisa willingly joins the doctor and Lisa for some stimulating therapy that's sure to inspire the first chapter to her saucy sequel.
