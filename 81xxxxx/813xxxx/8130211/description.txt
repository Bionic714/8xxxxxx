Culture Documentary hosted by Martin Sheen, published by IMAX in 1997 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

From the tumultuous crowds at the annual lndependence Day celebration in Mexico City, the audience is transported back three millennia to the ancient Olmec, Toltec, Zapotec, Totanac, Aztec and Maya civilizations - the roots of Mexican culture. The abrupt, violent contact with Spanish conquerors in the early 16th century, dramatized in the overpowering images of Diego Rivera and other Mexican muralists, gives way to the fusion of cultures and the birth of a new society. Weaving together powerful visual testimonies of the past with current celebrations of age-old traditions, Mexico's history and culture come marvelously alive, shaping and reshaping the nation's path as it moves into the 21st century.
