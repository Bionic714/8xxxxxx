Book Description
Web advertising is changing. What was once a predominantly Flash-based medium is making the switch to HTML5, with the benefit of a plug-in free environment giving a larger audience for ads, and better integration with the page they are featured on. We live in a time where marketers, designers, and developers are confused as to what they can and canΓÇÖt do on different devices, browsers, and operating systems. What better way to finally make sense of it all, than by stepping through the entire campaign process on your own terms?

HTML5 Advertising will educate you on the whole digital advertising process from start to finish, and help you take advantage of new HTML5 features such as canvas, CSS3 animations, DOM events, audio and video, and offline storage. YouΓÇÖll also learn how to get around discrepancies in browser support with JavaScript and polyfills.
