,surfanimal69,2013-02-11T18:37Z,Hi Bozx. Thanks for all the years of your effort. Really I've been downloading since 2005 and can't thank you and all the other pirates for sailing such a fantastic journey. I would like to ask you a quick question or 2. First how do I get the original person who has the download aware that I got stuck at say 95% and that I would really like them to put it back so I can finish downloading it. I have dozens of those just sitting there going nowhere. Hahaha actually that is the only important question I have. :-) Thanks for your help.The one I want to finish the most is smallville 82gb stuck at 90.5% and another called dokumentarer 137.29gb stuck at 18.6% (which I can't seem too find on Pirate Bay anymore ) Thanks again :-)
