Following a nearly-aborted album in 2011 (Freak Flag, which I reviewed in LV issue #103) Greg Brown was quoted as saying, ΓÇ£I enjoyed it; even though it was a bitchΓÇöwhat with the lightning, mixing problems, etc.,ΓÇ¥ he admitted, ΓÇ£it got me interested in recording again, and I hope to put out a few more low- key, small pressingsΓÇª smaller and smaller is my goal.ΓÇ¥

Just over a year later, Brown fulfills that de- sire by recording and self-releasing Hymns to

What is LeftΓÇöan album stripped to the bare essentialsΓÇöno drums or bass. The album continues the winning formula of Brown on acoustic guitar and signature gravelly baritone (except for the surprising falsetto in ΓÇ£Beshams

BokarieΓÇ¥), and long- time sideman and producer Bo Ramsey providing his trade- mark atmospheric guitar tones. Helping

fill out the sound are Bob Black on banjo, Al Murphy on fiddle and longtime friend Dave Moore on button accordion. Brown taps in his family as well, with daughters Constie and Pieta and wife Iris DeMent all contributing vocals.

Brown takes the opportunity to present his version of ΓÇ£Brand New AngelΓÇ¥ which he wrote for Jeff Bridges to sing in Crazy Heart. I get a self-conscious chuckle out of his ode to weight gain ΓÇ£Fatboy Blues.ΓÇ¥ (My pants keep getting tighter, but itΓÇÖs not because IΓÇÖm aroused / I canΓÇÖt fish out my lighter or loose change / now, I guess IΓÇÖll get a fanny packΓÇö if they come in size 52.)

ΓÇ£All of Those ThingsΓÇ¥ has taken the place of ΓÇ£In The Dark With YouΓÇ¥ as my favorite Greg Brown song. Its uncomplicated, circular lyric of contrastsΓÇöIΓÇÖm a poet, IΓÇÖm mute / IΓÇÖm ugly, IΓÇÖm cute / IΓÇÖm rich, destitute and IΓÇÖm all of those things with my babyΓÇöand melody delivered with passion and reflection makes this one of the standout tracks.

Greg BrownΓÇÖs ability to return to the creative well for 25 albums is impressive, but Hymns to What is Left is quickly becoming my favorite. ItΓÇÖs an observational quilt, a patchwork of wry wisdom with frayed edges, melancholy, but laced with acerbic wit and occasional joy. The perfect wrap for the coming colder months.
