You have got to see it to believe it!
What an eye opener!

This shows no seeds but, is wrong

I downloaded it myself! On 2 different computers!"

It IS an eye opener. There are several torrents out there for it, but i never found one that had ALL of the 36 parts. So that's why I did this one, so people could get the complete set in one place.

My internet speed here is absolutely terrible in this day and age, so I apologize for how long it takes to get the download complete. Hopefully you are seeding now too, so that should speed things up :)"
