Inspired by songwriters Ben Folds and Rufus Wainwright, Elton returns to his songwriting roots with longtime collaborator Bernie Taupin. In terms of style Songs from the West Coast has little in common with past masterpieces like Tumbleweed Connection. Where Songs works best is recaptures the "spirit" of those early albums. John has come full circle and returned to the "singer/songwriter" era that brought him his earliest success.

The album is far from flawless but there are many jewels to be found on the road to the west coast. Lyrically Bernie Taupin returns to one of his favorite topics the American West. This time, though, Taupin focuses on the contemporary "wild west" that surrounds him. He focuses on both real life topics Matthew Shepard's murder in American Triangle and his own loss of faith in humanity This Train Don't Stop There Anymore. While some of the selections are lyrically obtuse, that doesn't dilute the power of the best songs.

Songs is a rare example of a third act in the music field. At this stage in John's career one could expect him to continue to churn out formulaic songs in the same vein as his late 80's early 90's work. Songs provides us with a snapshot of a performer that is interested in returning to what he's done best in the past create narrative songs that say something about who we were, who we are and where were going.
