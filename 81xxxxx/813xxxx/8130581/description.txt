Robot Chicken - Season 6 - Episode 19 (WEB-DL - 1080p)
------------------------------------------------------

Robot Chicken is back for its Sixth Season of hilariously insane, wackadoodle,
totally off the wall stop-motion animation! This season's 20 brand spankin' new
episodes will flash images across your retinas and flood your brains with an
overabundance of mind-melting pop culture spoofery that will most likely cause
your head to explode and leave a stain on the couch that will never come out (sorry Mom)!

Produced by Stoopid Monkey, Stoopid Buddy Stoodios, Sony Pictures and Williams Street.

The writers have the Humping Robot attack the U.S. Navy in Battlehump;
We show what an intervention would look like for M.A.D. Cat;
Our minds imagine how The Thundercats learn about estrus.
