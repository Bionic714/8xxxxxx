[T],[D],2013-05-12T11:18Z,"10bit is a bit more efficient encoding method, in short.
For this movie, this size is the minimum for quality. Not all movies are compressible the same. The 4.3 gb scene encode of this movie looks unwatchable (to me). 
It all depends on how much you care about video quality. Lots of people can't see a difference between yffy encodes (those reaaaaly small ones) and original bluray."
