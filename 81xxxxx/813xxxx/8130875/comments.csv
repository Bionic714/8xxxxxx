,soviet001,2013-03-15T10:03Z,"manminhas, sorry I didn't listen to your heads up :( Figured maybe your card couldn't handle the video (this was before I realized the ul was only 4.5 gig) haha.

He's right Atlas, strange coming from someone like you, with many many movies under your belt (alas, no ""VIP"" or ""Trusted"" sign yet). But hey, don't sweat it too much, it apparently happened with a bunch of people trying to rip this from the disk...

""But The Hunger Games disc reports many (perhaps 15-20) Main Title, 16 Chapter files, with at least three different running times (2:23, 2:24, 2:25), making it impossible to determine which is the ""right"" file to rip.""

In a forum where the following poster refers the OP to the following for more information and why something like *this* can also happen.

------------

Bottom line: don't download. 

Video, beginning at 3.5 mins cuts to a short scene and then returns to the movie, but not where it last left off (video timer keeps running) and goes on to do this intermittently for the rest of the movie (interrupting with sudden 30-60+ second clips from a different part of the movie.

Good audio tho Atlas, I guess -- I'm using mkvmerge to splice your DTS track into a different stereo rip I have (anoXmous / Zen_Budd, who is like YIFY but better quality for same small file size)"

,soviet001,2013-03-15T10:14Z,"ugh sorry just registered recently, I saw other's double-triple posting, but figured they were idiots who couldn't wait for the thing to load. In my case, I just assumed some character limit was reached or something...sorry...just noticed the ""Comments:"" count, top right :)

my apologies.. "
,soviet001,2013-03-15T10:18Z,"And this didn't happen to me last post, is this something that just happens on and off (the 'hidden' posting/your comments not showing up or with a delay, even if it's your first comment of the day)? It was instantaneous with the first comment I ever posted a few days back...so just wondering, if someone could explain it to me..."
,soviet001,2013-03-15T11:13Z,"God it was  pretty stupid of me to mux your DTS track with another (stereo) rip -- forgot that the crazy skips/""jump cuts"" (lol, I thought it was part of the movie at first!) are in the audio too, obviously..! Oh well, at least I finished dl'ing another in the process."
