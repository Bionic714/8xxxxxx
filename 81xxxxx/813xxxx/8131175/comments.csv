,Tiger_Zip,2013-03-24T23:15Z,Can anyone type if the game works?
,egar33,2013-04-01T17:16Z,"I can confirme that YES this works! But if you want to play you have to open the ""ck2.exe"" file on the installed paste, not the ""ck2game.exe"" one, because for some reason if you open through ""ck2game.exe"" you will get a runtime error window after the loading screen. So just open with the ""ck2.exe"".

BUT if you want to play with mods, like Game of Thrones, you obviusly have to open the game through the ""ck2game.exe"" in order to choose the mod to play, and you should uncheck all the DLC's on the right. I don't know which DLC might cause the runtime error, so for a simple solution just uncheck all of them; if you want to play with the DLC and not with mods just open the game through the ""ck2.exe"" :)"
,dimzki,2013-04-11T21:21Z,does it include the old gods expansion ?

,Ay0me,2013-05-18T17:53Z,"Work like charm, but one week ago idk why suddenly game dont recognize DLC, even if they are ""checked"" in launcher. Anyone know solution ? "
,Aprokind,2013-05-24T21:34Z,we wait for the Old Gods- this will be the most awesome DLC
,k3tj0w,2013-05-28T18:48Z,"How use The Old GOds without old gods ? :DDDDD

copy for example 2 files : dlc023.zip and dlc023. change name to dlc024.zip and dlc024. Open dlc024 with notepad+. Change the name from Songs of presperus or wahtever to ""The Old Gods"". Next change ""archive = ""dlc/dlc023.zip""
to ""archive = ""dlc/dlc024.zip""

DONE ! "
,myOne,2013-05-28T22:55Z,"@k3tj0w: As crazy as it sounds it totally fucking works. The newest 1.10 patch is probably necessary, but at first glance this seems to work perfectly fine."
,jrhindo,2013-05-28T23:41Z,some1 need to upload v1.100 with The Old Gods!
,RezMar,2013-05-29T12:08Z,te
,k3tj0w,2013-05-29T14:17Z,"yep it works, but we need someone who upload the new versions of portraits and sunset invasion dlc. And ofc propper the old gods ang old gods songs, unit packs, na portraits "
,faraday0,2013-05-29T23:14Z,"i got old gods working using k3tj0w method on v1.10 with DLC activator. so what i'm missing out when playing old gods this way are units, portraits and songs and that's it?"
