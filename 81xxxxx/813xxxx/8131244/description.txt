ΓÇ£An Oral History of Islam in PittsburghΓÇ¥ is an examination of IslamΓÇÖs evolution in the city of Pittsburgh, beginning with migrant ex-slaves in the post Civil War era, to the twentieth century, when indigenous Muslims began collecting pieces of Islam to form their own communities. The film looks at pseudo-Islamic movements such as the Moorish Science Temple and the Nation of Islam, in addition to off-shoots of traditional Islam such as the Ahmadiyah movement, which were all part of Islam's evolution in the city's indigenous Muslim population.

Time is spent to examine the contributions of Dr. Yousef Khan, a man largely responsible for migrating members of Pittsburgh's Moorish Science Temple to a more traditional Islam. Additionally, the film looks at the Nation of Islam's relationship in Pittsburgh, including frequent visits by Malcolm X, and the nation's evolution toward a more traditional Islam.

Finally, the film moves to the 70s and early 80s, when immigrant Muslims began to intermingle with indigenous Muslims and form their own communities. Also, time is spent to look at Muslims' current situation in Pittsburgh and search for solutions to improve the Muslim community.
