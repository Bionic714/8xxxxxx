I already asked it many times : Can you upload TSS A330 GE HD & PW HD, TSS A340 CFM or Engine Sound Creations A340 CFM and finaly TSS B747 GE. Please share with us if it's possible. ;)"
,anymore2,2013-02-14T21:53Z,"Hi,

_SnakEye where is the El Hierro?

I've saw that in your account...

Could you re-upload?"
[T],_SnakEye,2013-02-15T15:01Z,"I had to remove the torrent , due to some comments in the torrent that could have risked the continuing of FSX uploads here in TPB.
the same is true with Frankfurt-Hahn, I removed that torrent as well as there was an Aerosoft guy Snooping around asking strange questions about how I cracked the Sceneries.
he uses the name of ""fly4fun""...
don't have any contact with that guy!!! he is an impostor.. he is an AEROSOFT guy!!! watch of him, he can get you into trouble!!!"
,anymore2,2013-02-16T00:02Z,Go out Aerosoft guy!!!
,DarkstarG,2013-02-16T00:37Z,"Thanks for this Snakeye!

Btw. Aerosoft has removed the ASE_Data protection from their newest sceneries, Saarbruecken, Hahn, Fairbanks...
Any chance of reupload, as this new ASE_Data made some real mess: it would freeze up FSX on boot, of couple of seconds only. When deactivated (ASE_Data), problem was gone."
[T],_SnakEye,2013-02-16T14:54Z,"from what version it was removed?
I still seeing I need the activation for it to work (or place the crack I created)."
,DarkstarG,2013-02-16T23:42Z,"Sorry, my bad, not Fairbanks.

I have alot of addons that I would like to share, lots of rare stuff and updates etc. I keep getting banned and have to make a new email and login from 3g on my phone. Can you contact me and help me out with finding a vpn or proxy etc so i can help contribute to the community too? Thanks. My email is torrential368@gmail.com"
