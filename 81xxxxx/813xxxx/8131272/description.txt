On Stage is a double live album originally released by Rainbow in 1977. It was recorded live over several German and Japanese dates in late 1976 during the Rising world tour.

The deluxe edition was released on November 13th, 2012 in Europe. The second disc was originally planned to contain tracks from Osaka, Japan (December 9th, 1976). However, when the tapes from the archive were finally mixed and delivered for the project, the recordings were actually from the evening show in Tokyo, December 16th, 1976, minus "Stargazer" and "Still I'm Sad" as those particular reels could not be located. Therefore, "Sixteenth Century Greensleeves" is the same as the version on the first disc. The "Blues" section of "Man on the Silver Mountain" is also identical to that on the first disc.
