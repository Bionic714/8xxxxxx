title (EN) Cabela's Dangerous Hunts 2013

synopsis (EN) In Cabela's Dangerous Hunts 2013, you're not just tracking one of 

the most ferocious beasts in the wild, you're also hunting for redemption and 

revenge! Cabela's adds an extra edge with a storyline from one of the writers of 

Fringe. After losing their father to the claws of a grizzly bear, two brothers 

reunite for a hunt ten years later, putting their past in the crosshairs and their 

own lives on the line. Track predators that move in coordinated packs, use social 

hierarchies, and ambush you with behavior driven by a smarter and deadlier AI 

engine. Things get really hairy in the new split-screen co-op Maneater Mode, where

increasingly threatening animals come at you in waves.
