Stopping is difficult. Received some pressure after my last announcement. Some asked for Madonna. However it is hard to honor an artist with some sound tracks, for whom ears seem less important than eyes (and other body parts).

So I altered my playlist a bit to avoid some Kylie Minogue effects and select only the tracks I think you hear a lot of Madonna herself. The result is a more than two hour playlist that is not MadonnaΓÇÖs greatest Hits number 673 but certainly the best sounding playlist with Madonna sounds.

Selecting a the title track was kind of hard. Who is Madonna? Material Girl? A Masterpiece or just a Lucky Star. I got stuck with asking myself.

Enjoy..
