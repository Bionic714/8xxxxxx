,phase700b,2013-02-12T03:20Z,Thanks for this one. Would you happen to have it in a higher resolution?
,TheOnlyest,2013-02-12T18:10Z,"^ 2nd that, if you ripped this from HDTV, could you possibly upload in at least 720p? And you should remove this one from the ""Highres - Movies"" category. Great rip though!"
[T],nomad_runner,2013-02-12T22:54Z,"I'm working on a 720p version. Should be upped in a day or two. Also working on another version of ""Blown Away"" that's 1080i (my earlier one was also only 704x400). Be patient. Thanks for the input."
,phase700b,2013-02-13T03:12Z,Thanks nomad_runner. I think it's great that you're uploading these movies that so many of us like that are unlikely to ever be released on Blu-ray. Great job!
