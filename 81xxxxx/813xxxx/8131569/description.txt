Blatantly, brutally honest, Out Of Your Mouth frontman Jason Darr is a rarity in the see-no-evil, speak-no-evil Canadian music scene. As vehement and unapologetic as their creator, the songs on the Calgary bandΓÇÖs Vikrecordings/BMG Canada Inc. May 18th debut, Draghdad are an intense build of hard rock, industrial reinforcement, stand-out lyrics, and big, catchy, killer choruses.
