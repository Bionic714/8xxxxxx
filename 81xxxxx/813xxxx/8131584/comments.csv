BTW if you are playing on a laptop like I am and you are getting under 30FPS with low settings go into your DocumentsBFBC2 folder and change the line in the Settings.ini that says ""DxVersion=auto"" to say ""DxVersion=9"" or ""DxVersion=10"". IDK if it is just my laptop or if this game was just not optimized for DX11 or what but I got lower FPS in this than I do in BF3. After the change I get 60+ fps with medium/high settings. Odd."
