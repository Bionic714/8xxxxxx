Well, here is the final version of the torrent. Mostly just some small quality things and minor updates/additions/fixes/etc.

The missing Usagi song and a demo are added, and their EP is now at 320.

Both of the comp songs are included now (Shinya Kousoku is really good).

I can't remember all the other stuff I did, but that's about it. Pretty sure it's mostly scans and such anyway.

But wow, I really had a lot of fun doing this despite it being a pain in the ass sometimes. If anything else pops up (Usagi's old demos, the '05-'06 DVD, any new Mariko stuff, etc.) I'll upload that separately. For now, though, this is as complete as it'll get.

Enjoy, and PLEASE SEED!
