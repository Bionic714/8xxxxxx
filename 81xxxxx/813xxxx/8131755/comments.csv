[H],shirepirate,2013-02-11T21:59Z,thanks for the update. i'll play it and if it's any good i'll buy it. love these style classic RPGs if they have a gripping storyline. Adobe AIR only though? any plans to change that?
,dg2443,2013-02-11T22:13Z,Thank you for this game man. I'm glad that you reuploaded this game and am looking forward to playing it
,thecornholio66,2013-02-11T22:21Z,You're awesome! 
,ABadName,2013-02-11T22:27Z,Awesome! Just read the article here. http://torrentfreak.com/indie-game-devs-delight-pirate-bay-and-reddit-with-disappearing-torrent-130211/ Along with the Reddit posts. Will buy the game for you once it's greenlit on steam. Will vote on it right now aswell.
,micrors4,2013-02-11T22:57Z,"Gonna try it and if I like it I will definitely buy it, I also have a pretty good internet connection so I will be seeding this as long as I can"
,micrors4,2013-02-11T22:58Z,Also gave you a thumbs up on steam
,PapaxSmuf,2013-02-11T23:44Z,Voted yes on steam and will buy it if I like it after 30 min or so of playing it now =)
,threat_of_censure,2013-02-11T23:47Z,"big props sean, for using this to your advantage.  a LOT of people are now going to get to see your work that might have otherwise never heard of it, and we BUY games we like and support developers who aren't douchebags!  will seed to support, vote you in on steam and catch you on twitter.  peace, and thanks for sharing your creation!"
[H],Eppo,2013-02-12T04:14Z,"Thank you, if it gets on steam I'll grab a copy :)"
[V],seagaia,2013-02-12T06:05Z,"sean here - thanks guys, yes, definitely let me know what you think of the game. hoping we can get onto steam.

shirepirate - a port away from air is unlikely just due to my lack of time and technical skill, though I have a standalone SWF available from desura for those that can't install air (i need to update it from 1.503 -> most recent tho). might throw that up here if i get time."
,Dr_SquidLove,2013-02-12T07:13Z,"Sean, I want to say that it's admirable that you have chose to harness the power of TPB rather than condemn it. As you can see, with the right attitude, TPB can be used as a means to inflame the popularity of your product. 
In terms of the game, this looks absolutely incredible. I'm infatuated with the style and feel. I'm going to try it out with this torrent but If I enjoy it (which I'm sure I will), you and your friend will be receiving my money. I've already told several people about your game and they're all looking into buying it as well. 
From one artist to another, much respect. Thank you for releasing this awesome product into the gaming world and doing it with a great attitude and community spirit. "
[M],Hero,2013-02-12T16:59Z,"We apologize for nuking the previous torrent uploaded by Frewyrn. It was a mistake on our side. The ban on his account has been lifted and the torrent will be restored soon.

Thanks to seagaia for embracing piracy  :)

The crew liked the game, so there might be some ""news"" in the coming days... ;)"
,TPBGurl,2013-02-12T19:26Z,"Coming here via Torrent Freak, (my morning email of news)

Welcome to The Pirate Bay Seagaia! :)) Also looking forward to seeing the game on Steam, about to DL and try it out. Thank you so much for giving us a chance and sharing with us. It is greatly appreciated!"
,Tonhum,2013-02-12T19:47Z,"Downloading. Already voted on Steam Greenlight, hope it gets onto Steam!"
,logic41,2013-02-14T09:12Z,"I've been using TPB for a few years now, but have never considered leaving a comment till this one. Just wanted to give my support for the leap your taking here, using Torrent to display your product to a wider audience. I look forward seeing it Greenlit, and after trying the game, I can say I would be happy to buy it."
,anonnie,2013-02-14T20:33Z,"seagaia: have you seen haxe and nme? the former is an actionscript-like language, and the latter is a framework. together they're designed to be an opensource flash/air platform replacement.

the platform libraries are under permissive BSD/MIT style licenses.

i know you may not have time to learn something new, but it's always good to be able to 'own' your work 100%.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haxe
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NME_%28framework%29

adobe air for linux was discontinued awhile back. haxe/nme are a pretty sane migration path for people who want the same type of environment. oh, and it runs on like, everything. including mobile platforms."
[V],seagaia,2013-02-14T21:40Z,"Thanks for the support, guys. Yes, there will be some...""news"" tomorrow :) .. including a way for those who cannot pay the full price to get the game for cheaper if you'd like to pay.  

anonnie : Yup I've looked at HAXE briefly. I'm considering moving as soon as I flesh out a prototype or two which I'll probably still do in AS3, for speed's sake.

 There's a HAXE port of Flixel so I might use that! I just need to do some research and hack it out a bit, but learning HAXE probably won't take too long since it's pretty similar to AS3 I think."
[V],seagaia,2013-02-14T23:04Z,"Kind of a random question, figured this is a good place to ask. Is there any way of making rough guesstimates based on # of seeders over time at how many people have downloaded the game? Jon and I were randomly curious. "
[M],Hero,2013-02-14T23:56Z,"seagaia: TPB used to have a downloads counter long time ago. The feature was later removed because it's inaccurate (remember TPB doesn't operate a tracker anymore) and it could be used by anti-piracy groups to calculate ""damages"".

Related discussion here > https://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=105711

Also, the current seeders/leechers count on the site is rarely accurate. For proper stats, check your torrent client."
,banzekin,2013-02-15T12:15Z,Thank you!! awesome game
,Mr_Ceiling_Cat,2013-02-15T13:09Z,voted up on greenlight
,damirnik,2013-02-15T13:13Z,"this is so cool , ty guys!"
,bluwave1,2013-02-15T13:51Z,I bought the game and the soundtrack and I voted Yes on the Greenlight page. Good luck. : )
,takyirklosov,2013-02-15T13:56Z,Favorited and followed on Steam. I also gave it two thumbs way up. 
,gamerhan,2013-02-15T14:16Z,I'm sure this would be popular if you could port this to the android or iOS and expand to the mobile platform. This way it will be even easier to market and bring in some cash. I'm sure alot of guys wants this on their mobiles
,deathalf,2013-02-15T14:50Z,i just voted for this game only because is on tpb if only have a credit card gladly i will buy
,Mark9870,2013-02-15T14:58Z,"kinda reminds me of Aveyond Rhen's quest. Though it looks like it, i cant vote yes on steam because i need privileges. I wish i could help by voting."
,gdonanthony,2013-02-15T16:26Z,hhmmm i viewed the video at the sight... it seems ok.. similar to dragon warrior 3 but sad to say dragon warrior 3 is more awesome than this ... if u can just have the idea of dragon warrior 3 and put more some life into it or something that can make it unique.... 
,pooterpon,2013-02-15T17:06Z,Another retro throwback indie game. Original.
[V],seagaia,2013-02-15T17:35Z,"We have a bitcoin address now because I was told that makes it easier for people to donate : 12P99mfAGuA9dnRhNTNLjTj9sCNTSxVUkQ

I have it working on Android thanks to AIR and that means iOS is probably straightforward. Just need to get aorund to releasing it."
,hmsonjo,2013-02-15T17:51Z,Awesome game!!!

,MonkeyMindUSB,2013-02-15T19:33Z,"Forgive my ignorance, but since I didn't see it stated, on what operating systems can this game  run?"
,JohnnySasaki,2013-02-15T20:09Z,It should run on any current-day operating system.
,noekk,2013-02-15T20:39Z,Why are you so desperate to get on Steam? There are other ways to sell your game.
,rikipy,2013-02-15T20:54Z,"hey seagaia, You Cant Post the Soundtrack in other site where accepts other payment form, paypal dont have Paraguay :( i like the soundtrack from the game "
,paprboy,2013-02-15T21:08Z,Wow about 1500 seeders and 1000 peers still downloading... i guess i can congratulate you guys. This is massive!
,doctor beef,2013-02-15T21:15Z,"@noekk high five for wining the biggest douche award on TBP today! Im sure he knows this. The one thing U dont seem to understand is that this is one of the most popular sites on the internet, witch by the way his game is front paged. He got instant visibility ,plus respect from the pirate & game crowd! I dl'd ,bought & voted up on greenlight! Seagaia knows u cant stop us pirates ,but if u scratch our back we will scratch yours!"
[V],seagaia,2013-02-15T21:31Z,"I guess we're desperate to get onto Steam because the other mediums don't sell as well. Steam pretty much tramples all of the competition! 

As for the issue with Bandcamp, I'm working with Josh of the Humble Bundle to get a Humble Store  game+soundtrack version available soon."
,itslinty,2013-02-15T22:02Z,sweet game! voted on greenlight.
,althure,2013-02-15T22:26Z,"Thanks for being awesome guys these are the games I buy, like FTL and Space Pirates and Zombies. Both I pirate play for 5 min realize it's awesome and go buy it. If your game is awesome too I'll buy it :)."

,miroki89,2013-02-15T22:29Z,Looks like just A Link to the Past.
,leondreux,2013-02-15T22:31Z,I voted for your game on Steam.  Are there any plans for you to upload the Mac version of your game onto TPB for testing?  I can't play Windows games on my Mac (obviously).  Thanks!
,7mmSniper,2013-02-15T22:37Z,Looks intriguing. Gave it the ole thumbs up!
,Krono45,2013-02-15T22:51Z,"Downloaded extremely fast and worked perfectly, great music, sound effects, story and action. For fans of the original Legend of Zelda games. Thanks seagaia!"
,stheo_gr,2013-02-15T23:03Z,awesome game...reminds me zelda...good job guyz!
,rikipy,2013-02-15T23:09Z,@leondreux the game need adobe air for play.
,rikipy,2013-02-15T23:10Z,"Other suggestion for wait, add other lang in the future."
[V],seagaia,2013-02-15T23:18Z,"yeah whether you can play is contingent on having AIR 2.6 or not. mac and windows run this consistently, linux is iffy (there's a standalone swf on desura if yuo have a key or copy there)"
,besul,2013-02-15T23:36Z,"Short words: Not playing this. Didn't like it. BUT, this is a step, and an important one.

Hopefully someday we will have lots of educated people here and then we can make TPB work as a test site and deliverer. An author would upload his own book for free and link a PayPal account to it. If anyone reads and likes, donating 4-5 US$ would probably equal the amount of money that the author would get with the sell of a 20-25 US$ paper version, so both would end up winning. 

TPB can kill the industry in many ways, both positive (making artists richer, making developers famous and making coders well-paid) and negative ways (exterminating Hollywood, even though that wouldn't be a big deal); with educated and well-informed people, selfless people, this is one of the bricks to building heaven.

P.S.: Even that I didn't like the game, your initiative is really interesting and important IMMTHO, congratulations to the developers, anyway."
,Pascal6662,2013-02-15T23:46Z,"If you get the error ""The application could not be installed because the installer file is damaged. Try obtaining a new installer file from the application author."" try copying the installer to your local drive and running it from there.  It doesn't seem to like running from a network drive."
[V],seagaia,2013-02-15T23:58Z,"Yeah, thanks. No worries if you didn't like it, not everyone's cup of tea. I think it will be interesting to see how distribution will be changing 

The number of people playing (or at least having downloaded) really is astounding (thousands!) , plus the copies people purchased. Hoping some other games will follow suite. "
,DammDoggs,2013-02-16T00:48Z,"Good job guys. Downloading now and will purchase if I like it. 

What a simple concept... It used to be, that you had to buy these digital works (Whether that be music, games, movies, etc.), and if you didn't like them... well tough, you were stuck with them. Nice to see that trend making a 180 finally... hopefully others will start to follow suit. Good on you guys for releasing in this manner. "
,River-Rat,2013-02-16T00:55Z,I GONNA TRY THIS....LOOKS A LOT LIKE AN OLD ZELDA GAME TY VERY MUCH 
,micrors4,2013-02-16T01:31Z,"I bought the game even though I already downloaded the torrent, but I thought it was worth a donation anyways because of how awesome the creators are of it and I hope it helps to get us to a time when all media will be shared the same way."
,zer0punk,2013-02-16T01:40Z,"this looks great!

you should look into indie game bundle it is donation based orginization It would help you get the word out and make a few more bucks

I am curious though what you used to make it i currently am reading up on documentation to get a game going and couldn't find any good 2D game engines."
,shadowthrasher,2013-02-16T02:08Z,"This is ballsy, I have to say. Not a lot of devs would take a risk like this. But, if you think about it, it's a pretty sterling guarantee of quality on the part of the creators. I can't think of a more confident way of saying ""this game is worth your money"", than offering that the consumer play it before paying for it. And your investment is still sound, because you're supporting future titles. So, if I like what you're doing, I'll certainly pitch in to support you!"

,Nobletorrentz,2013-02-16T03:07Z,"I cant say i appreciated the beginning but its a pretty good game, and judging by ingenuity this game is probably minuscule to what you have the ability to  accomplish.

,besul,2013-02-16T03:44Z,"seagaia; - Thanks for the answer.

Very entertaining if you have nothing to do.
Would be a very interesting game on Android or iOS platforms."

Savengaard : Excellent! thanks."
,sr_tpb,2013-02-16T05:29Z,"To be honest, I'm not too inclined to keep what feels like a re-packaged Zelda title from the SNES days. I'd even go so far as to question how much of the design was lifted from Link to the Past, because there was this nagging sense of deja vu from the moment I got to the outside area of the first dungeon that I just couldn't really let go of.

I appreciate that it seems to run very smoothly, but in terms of originality there's nothing positive I can add. Sorry."
[V],seagaia,2013-02-16T05:58Z,You should consider playing for a few more hours before you pass an absolute judgment!
,Sagara_Shinji,2013-02-16T07:17Z,"The game is fine. I'll seed until a ratio of 1.000.
Like it says in the README file: if game doesn't start and it pops an error sign, then just uninstall and reinstall, it should be okay with this (at least it worked with me).
It's a good skill game."

,Amasu,2013-02-16T19:24Z,"I REALLY do have much MUCH more respect for companies that release their game THEMSELVES on sites like this, not to see how many people are ""ripping them off,"" but to let people without the capability to purchase either right away or without the funds to enjoy and/or test it out. I myself being a full time college student, trying to find a job, many medical and family bills barely have any money to my name, so I will DEFINITELY give this game a try, and when I get sufficient funds, help you all out and purchase a full copy, thats what I try my best to do with all games I torrent and end up loving.

I'm about to start playing but regardless as to whether I enjoy the game or not (I'm almost positive that I will), I'm going to purchase your game or donate some money. It's so nice to see people who want to create games for the right reasons, instead of just trying  to make a ton of money. 

I understand this game must have taken a lot of hard work, so requesting money is perfectly reasonable. I have absolutely no problem giving money to forward-thinking people like yourselves. "

I would totally buy it as homebrew or even as a title on the PSN for my Vita!! I made a pirate bay account just to give you guys this shout out :) Thank you so much for all your hard work and time you've spent on this game! I do have to ask, what did you use to make this game? Did you make your own game engine to build it or is there a set of tools you used to get this finished with?

[V],seagaia,2013-02-16T21:15Z,"thanks everyone - i'm curious to see what people think of the atmosphere and how well we managed to convey our ideas through it and the gameplay.

Death_Of_Chaos : Thanks for letting me know! A port like that isn't in the works right now, I don't know what it would entail - we use the Flixel AS3 engine and FlashDevelop, I wrote the music using the REAPER DAW, jon used photoshop cs5 and graphicsgale free to do graphics.

But, if someone wanted to try porting it, when we get a really stable build out maybe I might release the source (though it's a nightmare mess..)

On an unrelated note, does someone have a guess as to how many downloads there might be from the torrents? Just like a ballpark estimate, I know there aren't perfect ways to calculate these things.

I don't know if it is a bug or i'm just dumb, but i'm stucked after killer the skeleton boss (in the stage that reminds a haunted house, with blue cubes that you must activate/desactivate). I kill the boss, but them i don't have means to get out of the house. The main entrance (where the portal to the QG is) have 2 lines of blue cubes. Between them, there is a switch, but you only can reach it  when you are entering in the house, since you stay in the place where the second line of cubes rise and use the switch. When you are exiting, the second line of cubes block you way to reach the switch. If you get inside the house e use another switch, you will be blocked in the first line of cubes.

Sorry for my bad english. I hope someone can help me. By the way, great game. Congratulations Sean and Jonathan. "

Also, even though I'm not far, I'm liking it so far. Pretty graphics, good music, entertaining dialogue. 
Probably gonna end up buying the soundtrack, but I don't know if I'm going to like the game enough to buy it. Upvoted on Steam, though."

,lutexv,2013-02-17T16:05Z,@jimzii: Those Red Gems above the portals indicates that you already cleaned the area. That is... you picked up all cards and keys.
,lutexv,2013-02-17T16:27Z,"I guess that now i got a real one. I want to report a bug. After killing Briar, after he gave a ""good bye"" to Young, he go to north. When i saw that, i started to follow him, and when I realized that was a giant sea, and that I was drowning, i head back. But then  when i was back at the place we first meet him (the crossover of rivers), Briar was back to life and started his speech again (the one that he gives before the battle). When he finished it, I was teleported back at the sea, and the had buttons stoped to work and the screen started to shake. I tried 'ESC', 'Enter', 'X', 'C'. Nothing worked. I was able to close just with ""Alt+F4'."
,chanciusmaximus,2013-02-17T17:13Z,"I'm stuck at the first temple in the room with one button in top left corner and a red blob stuck behind a wall in the top right corner.  I would assume to push the masked guy onto the button to open the gate in the upper middle, but no dice.  What do I have to do to open that gate?"
,AnEasyBakedOven,2013-02-17T17:21Z,"This game is fucking awesome. Just played it for about 2 hours. I will be buying it when I get some money! Great job guys, please keep making games. If you need a tester for Android I will be here!"
[V],seagaia,2013-02-17T17:53Z,"hey yeah if you can test for android email me at anodynegame@gmail.com

As for game help, until someone writes a FAQ, there seems to be a small community at gamefaqs: http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/703139-anodyne"
,jimziii,2013-02-17T17:53Z,"Lutexv thnx i figured it was the cards

I got a small bug too but only a very small one
After defeating the squid boss thats in the last cave in the mysterious underworld that is down the sea vortex.. When i defeated him the health fly or whatever it is just flew past me and out of the screen.. I could still hear it buzzing.. But it was easily fixed by just walking one screen down then up again"
[V],seagaia,2013-02-17T17:59Z," the call for android testing also applies for anyone who might be interested in iOS, assuming I can get that working."
,Usumari,2013-02-17T20:54Z,Why the hell did you find it necessary to make a fucking incredibly hard level in the cliffs other than that its a cool game
,Usumari,2013-02-17T20:56Z,The one with the rollers in the first cave
,Zachdragon10,2013-02-17T21:04Z,This is probably the best way to advertise ever.
,angelmtz8a,2013-02-17T21:28Z,@seagaia I wanna test it on ios i got and ipod touch 5g! 
[V],seagaia,2013-02-17T21:40Z,"sorry it's a challenge thing for an extra upgrade, didn't want it to be too easy. "
,chanciusmaximus,2013-02-17T21:52Z,"Anyone help?  Still stuck at first temple.  Can't open gate with one button/lever in top left corner.  Has two dust clouds, one masked guy and one blob up in right corner behind wall.  Been through all the other rooms and nothing.  Pushed masked guy onto button and nothing happened.  Did that AND killed blob nothing.  "
,powerbase,2013-02-18T00:00Z,"Guys, installing this in Linux is a PAIN IN THE ASS!  That's why I wrote this guide a few minutes ago. :)  http://www.thepowerbase.com/2013/02/how-to-install-anodyne-in-ubuntu-12-04-and-12-10/"
,Molusco,2013-02-18T02:36Z,"Just to let you know, im not downloading/installing Adobe Air just for this.
Wanna know what i think of the game? Gimme binaries. 53MiB + 17MiB for and ""old school"" game? You are seriously missing something. Programming skills."
[V],seagaia,2013-02-18T05:32Z,Most of that is the soundtrack. You are also being a jerk. I'm waiting for Desura to approve the standalone SWF version. 
,ExBoom,2013-02-18T12:14Z,"Please edit the Wiki I started for the game
http://anodyne.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page"
,verdep,2013-02-18T17:47Z,Thanks for sharing; Any chance this gets ported to iOS soon?
[V],seagaia,2013-02-19T02:20Z,"for the curious, I did a little post-mortem on the pirate bay promo: http://seagaia.wordpress.com/2013/02/18/anodyne-pirate-bay-promo-post-mortem/

We're also doing a /r/IAMA at 5PM  CST (-06:00) tomorrow (tuesday)!"
,Atomsk1,2013-02-19T02:35Z,"I think its really cool for developers to promote and release their games on TPB, and to take risks with non-standard pricing schemes, and that they should be applauded and rewarded for doing so, but unfortunately this game just isnt worth the effort IMO. Its pretty boring and lifeless, nothing more than aimlessly exploring mostly empty screens, poorly-designed dungeons, and fighting a handful of bland enemies over and over. The game itself feels very unpolished, almost like a beta of a better game. No decent gameplay innovations, no real gameplay at all. The would be a decent little time waster on Newgrounds or Kongregate or whatever, but it doesnt really deserve to be its own standalone thing or to cost money."
,Atomsk1,2013-02-19T02:38Z,"Also there are some really frustrating bugs. The arrow speed pads work so inconsistently its fucking ridiculous. I cant even tell you how many times i died in that one room where you have to run and jump diagonally across a huge pit. Anyone whose played it knows exactly which room im talking about. And in the area near the end, on the left, opposite the snow area with the little snowmen, i ended up walking though a wall that caused my entire game to glitch out with scrambled tiles moving everywhere, even in the menu. Eventually i walked out into a mostly black space, hoping it was some intentional part of the game but i never found anything."
,Addishuns,2013-02-19T03:55Z,So how do i go about installing this? hoping to play this soon :)
,Jason310M,2013-02-19T08:01Z,"Shitty, buggy game. Don't waste your time."
[V],seagaia,2013-02-19T08:39Z,Addishuns - you can download Adobe AIR get.adobe.com/air and when that's installed double-clicking on the AIR file should install the game.
,lfc3333,2013-02-19T15:34Z,@Jason310M Why don't you make a game and we'll see how buggy and shitty your game maybe.
,Bubaman,2013-02-20T00:35Z,"I don't always buy a game online, but when I did, I bought yours.
Seriusly guys, I made a PayPal account to buy some plane tickets, but never used it. Then I saw your promo, your game, and I was like: ""Wah! This is The legend of the final fantasy that triggers the fire emblem of gaia! or stuff like that. oh! And the main hero is using a broom!"" Then checked my PayPal account  and I had $1.50. So i totally bought your game. I wish I had more money to give to you, but I wish this little contribution help you guys get to the top and make games that people can enjoy, whit good jokes and retro stuff. 
Thanks for the good game, keep on your dream.
Highly recommended game!"
,interpreter_x,2013-02-22T16:46Z,"Hey guys, I just wanted to thank you for making Anodyne free to play, it was a great and unique game. I think it's well worth playing and I've let my friends know that they should give it a try to, especially since it's free, that being said, I'm happy to say that I paid you the $9 you asked for and that it was well worth it.

Thanks again guys."
[V],seagaia,2013-02-22T20:29Z,":) thanks guys. I am attempting to get the iOS and android versions in order...will have to play through them entirely first...and then we are doing a kongregate version. and bug fixes. still not sure about controller support yet...working on it :P 

48th on greenlight ( http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=92921739 ) by the way. thanks all :) next greenlight date is feb 26th! how nervewracking.

,stheo_gr,2013-02-24T17:24Z,very nice game.well done m8
,GeneralTso92,2013-02-24T19:35Z,"@Jason310M

Great criticism. That is real helpful."
[V],seagaia,2013-02-26T19:55Z,"so, we got greenlit. expect us on steam soon. thank you so, so much if you voted, or talked about the game - this stuff isn't possible without help from other people. ah! 

-sean "
,badadaha,2013-03-02T12:03Z,@seagaia Would you guys be willing to post some sort of walkthrough or atleast simple advice giving guide for us? I'm a programmer that like to get more into game programming. Not very good at graphics but would just like to know how you guys organized the game and what code you used and also what editors and stuff like that. Help me understand what you guys did to make a game like this. :) THANX
,BitchPhD,2013-03-02T23:01Z,"Adobe air keeps saying that the installer is broken and I just read on their website that ""the pirate by (sic) promotion has ended.""  So what gives?  "
[V],seagaia,2013-03-03T23:22Z,"I used FlashDevelop and Flixel, and just typed code until the game worked - I'm not really experienced or anything, the code is a pretty big mess. Just start small and work your way up in scale.

---

Try deleting the install folder of Anodyne and then re-installing the game, sometimes that fixes it. Otherwise I'm not sure. If you're on Mac or Windows it shouldn't be a problem, try updating air?"
,D3C3PT3C0N,2013-03-09T22:48Z,This game is great. It's hard too. It should be released as an arcade for xbox.
[V],seagaia,2013-03-11T19:54Z,i put the music up - http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8244817 . seed if you want!
,z00ts,2013-03-25T04:20Z,For some reason I can't assign the JUMP key in the menu. It shows off as ??? which make me unable to jump in the game. Any help ? :(
[V],seagaia,2013-03-25T04:31Z,you can't jump till a little later into the game 
,AtomBlast,2013-04-16T20:12Z,"Sorry guys, I can't buy the game since there's no Paypal in my shitty country. Anyway, awesome game!"
