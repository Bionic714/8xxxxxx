ANODYNE TORRENT v 1.505 (2/11/13)

Hey! This is Sean. I made this game with a friend! Please vote for it on Steam Greenlight (http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=92921739) so we can hopefully get onto Steam. And tell your friends to vote!!! Tell your neighbor! Tell the waiter at your local Chili's! Etc.

While I of course prefer if you bought Anodyne (as we worked a lot on it), I understand that not everyone is able to purchase it. I guess what's more important is that more people get to experience the game. In any case, if you enjoyed Anodyne and have the funds, feel free to purchase the game from https://sites.fastspring.com/anodynegame/instant/anodyne or send me money at seagaia@f-m.fm . Anodyne was made by two guys - Sean Hogan (me -) and Jonathan Kittaka). We'd love to continue making games and any financial support we can get helps!

I also write music, and wrote the 70+ minutes of music for Anodyne. You can stream it and buy it from my Bandcamp:.
