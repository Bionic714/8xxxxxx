,xWingR2,2013-02-12T03:47Z,"Version 24.1 says it will work for Server 2012.  Will this one (because 24.1 hasn't worked for me yet).  If not, ideas?"

@xWingR2 
U can also try Daz's loader (2.2.1) for Server 2012, I tested on a few machines, works ok. At least a permanent solution if it works on your mobo. Best place to find help though would be MDL, like Ark said.

@syst_admin
If you're comfortable with it, you should try Murphy78's Win8Pro VL with Office2013 and KMSNano already setup to do everything automatically. It even reactivates before 180days so you don't have to do anything.

,syst_admin,2013-02-12T22:26Z,"@Arkenstone & @maxsuser

I try already to download more then 1 version of the KMSnano. all downloads is VIA pirate bay anonymous download, app uploaded by you and Murphy78.
 each one of them, after extracting, I had an *.exe file. all of them, when I tried to open it gave me ""NSIS Error - Error launching the installer"" or ""Launcher Error - unable to open archive file"". I have Windows 8 Enterprise x64.

could you advise? I just installed fresh OS, tried extract with WinArchive, WinRAR and 7-zip.

am I missing something??

thanks for the response.
