,TheVeldt,2013-02-16T05:01Z,"You might want to check your computer.  I made sure to download this torrent on five separate computers and locations, and each yielded a perfectly working, high quality torrent and video.  Your computer sounds like the problem, unfortunately.  Try downloading the latest codecs and drivers for your PC and/or playing it in VLC Media Player.  Feel free to let me know if you have any further issues.  Thanks for the comment!"
,Smexican,2013-02-17T17:01Z,AMAZING!!!! Thank you for the upload I TRULY & HIGHLY appreciate it. File works perfectly & though it's over 4gb to put on my HDD (Fat32) to watch on my PS3 I did copy it over through PS3 Media Server. Just finished watching & this is by far the best RvB Season.
,TheVeldt,2013-02-17T21:25Z,"You're more than welcome!  I definitely appreciate the feedback.  Season 10 is certainly incredible, and looks great on Bluray.  And if you like the Project: Freelancer storyline, you should check out my other torrent.  Basically, I'd loved it so much that I ended up making a video of just the Freelancer story.  Here's the link if interested:

,Prokodile,2013-02-19T00:25Z,"Hey Veldt, thanks for uploading the last RvB seasons - pretty hard to come by in such good quality, much appreciate it. Because of their such high bitrate though, it makes the files kinda hard to use with older hardware, players or setups. Would you consider doing another round of RvB rips at some point in the future for the last seasons (or just the Freelancer Project combo, that was a great idea) at something like 720p, 1500-2000kbps in avi/mp4 format or something of that caliber? TIA."
,TheVeldt,2013-02-20T04:05Z,"Hm.  I'm a bit hesitant, just because I've actually gone waaaaay over my upload limit for the month, and am actually afraid of incurring charges at this point.  I've had to pretty much stop seeding my current torrents as is, so I can't guarantee any future torrent will be healthy.  At least not until next month anyway.  If you don't mind helping seed it a bit, I'll see what I can do."
,AmbushintheDark,2013-02-21T16:19Z,If you could upload the director's commentary from each season you will be my new god.
,raacer,2013-03-06T08:06Z,"Hey TheVeldt, Amazing torrents I have all the files and help host if they get below 1.0 (and I am not doing anything important) Its great to be able to watch it in this high of quality. Is it possible you could release .m4v files for the mini series (in solid videos not broken up like usual). Also it would be nice to have decent copies of the blood gulch chronicles, if anything so they match what you have already posted."
,raacer,2013-03-06T08:11Z,"Also (just read comment about upload limits, there should really be an edit function for comments) if you are having trouble hosting I know people who can or if anything I have unlimited fiber optic internet (laptop so only when I am home) i can host on at least so you don't have to worry about charges. Also if you want any help with the vids I can help a little."
,Prokodile,2013-04-05T17:12Z,"Well, it's good news all around, it seems: Rooster Teeth is celebrating its 10th anniversary these days, Red vs. Blue will be going into its 11th season in the summer and this torrent made it through the winter with flying colors thanks to some vigorous seeding these past 2 months - kudos to all involved! Time to talk flexible bitrates yet :p?"
,TheVeldt,2013-04-23T18:02Z,"Thanks to everyone who helped seeded and offered feedback!  I haven't been able to get on recently, but I AM planning to ultimately upload the Bluray version for the Blood Gulch Chronicles.  I will say that I did compare the Bluray version with the DVD version and it's not a huge difference, but if you're a stickler for quality and don't mind downloading a bigger size, then I would recommend it.  In addition, I have actually finished doing the Director's Commentary for ALL seasons.  I will upload this as well in a separate torrent and provide instructions for how to use that audio track over my other torrents.  And it gets better...I have rendered a lower quality version for Project Freelancer as some expressed interest in this due to an outdated rig.  As for the mini series, I have already been working to do those as well.  It will be included in a torrent that ALSO includes extra scenes only available on Bluray.  Now, all this will take a bit of time, but I DO plan on uploading all of this if I can.  Once again, thanks to everyone for your wonderful feedback.  I'm very glad to be able to share such a wonderful series.  I also once again recommend my Project Freelancer torrent for those interested in seeing the whole Freelancer story uninterrupted.  Have a good one, everybody, and keep on the lookout for my future torrents."
,TheMostLegit,2013-04-27T04:13Z,File exceeds max... can you zip/split the video file?
,JakeKlein,2013-05-05T20:37Z,"There's no sound for me. Everything else I use has sound, but this has none. Any way you know to fix this?"
,JakeKlein,2013-05-05T21:01Z,Nevermind my last comment. There was no sound when I opened it with wmp but then i downloaded vlc and now it works fine. Thanks for the great torrent! :D
,Prokodile,2013-05-21T00:40Z,"More good news, everyone! Rooster Teeth released the trailer for RvB Season 11 today which is slated to premiere about a month from now, June 14th, with apparently improved CGI-fu from Monty, guest VAs (S10 featured Elijah Wood as Sigma) and a continuing ,""R&B get in more trouble"" plot. Shit seems legit... yo... n' stuff. I guess. Veldt, if you think there's even the slightest chance you could put together a lower bitrate Freelancer arc rip between now and S11 launch  day, I might even go as crazy as to promise year's-end seeding of that bad boy, although I know it'll involve dreaded *work* :p. Lemme us know when you can. Cheers."
