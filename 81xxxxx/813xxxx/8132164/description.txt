This is a collection of Crimson Fire's Editors before their business went belly up.

Included are:

-Kyle's Quest Classic
-Kyle's Quest 2

I have also included some tilesets and compiled games for Kyle's Quest 2.

Unfortunately, I cannot find the editor for Galactic Realms 3, although if someone really wants it that badly, you could probably search the internet for it.  If that fails, comment on it and I'll go through my other 2.5 TB of data.

I also have a separate torrent that contains the games for the above editors.
