Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site :: On the Monday, February 11 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex expounds on the banking elite's deliberate agenda to usher in economic chaos in the U.S. and the visible, telltale signs that the federal government is preparing for possible domestic disorder. He'll also cover China surpassing the U.S. in global trade and how that ties in to the agenda to bankrupt America. On today's show, Alex welcomes radio host and co-creator of A Noble Lie, Holland Vandennieuwenhof to speak about Navy SEAL Chris Kyle's suspicious death and other possible false flags.
