Will miss the series as I miss the the inspiration for it, the fabulous Morse. it seems Kevin Whately has agreed to do a Xmas special later this year. He has been more than generous with his talent and time over last 20 years, to this production.
Cheers Kevin and your offsider Laurence Fox, Morse would be proud of you :-) "
