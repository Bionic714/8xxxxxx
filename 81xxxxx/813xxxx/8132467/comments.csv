,TheVeldt,2013-02-18T23:18Z,"Glad you enjoy my torrents!  I can almost guarantee I'll upload Season 11 whenever its Bluray comes out.  I love this series too much not to get the best quality. 

As for Freelancer, I hope you enjoy my video as well.  There was a lot of overlapping dialogue/sound, especially in Season 9 (I think S9 went from past to present too often and should have had longer chunks of each story instead of short clips, personally), but I'm very experienced with editing videos, so the transitions should be pretty seamless.  Thanks again for your feedback! :)"
,Smexican,2013-02-25T07:29Z,Your experience shows as it was well edited. Even the credits & end logos were very good. Came back to ask. Do you plan on uploading S1-5? I'm sure you ripped S6-10 off the BluRay & was wondering how the overall quality of 1-5 came out on BluRay. Thanks again for it all
