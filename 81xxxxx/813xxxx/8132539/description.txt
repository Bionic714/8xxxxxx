Again. Another repack.

People were complaining about the blurry picture in the HDCAM copy, so I just did what I'm good at.

The audio may be a tiny bit off, cuz the sync wasn't correct. I had to screw around with the video and found that running the video at 100.4% syncs with the audio.

You won't notice anything. :P
