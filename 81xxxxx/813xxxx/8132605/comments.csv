thanks stiffy."
,MLO89,2013-02-12T08:45Z,Works perfect. Unpack the first file with Winrar which will create the iso. Then unpack that iso with Winrar again. Then install the game from the setup.exe.

,Firebird95,2013-02-12T11:54Z,"First time posting on here but I thought I would share something that worked for me. I have a quad core and the game crashed on startup for me so I decided to disable 2 cores and run my computer as a dual core through msconfig on win7. After that I ran the game, closed out of it, then restarted  and booted back onto 4 cores. After that, I was able to run it fine. Hope this helps for anyone using a quadcore and has a crash on setup."

,sixtailer,2013-02-12T12:33Z,"Games like this are why piracy exists.  This is in no way, shape, or form worth even 5$.  This game is complete and utter trash.  Gearbox should be fucking ashamed of themselves for taking a huge shit on the alien franchise like this.  I won't go into meticulous detail on why and how this game sucks...just play it for yourself and it will become abundantly clear in the first 5 minutes."

,CatOnDrugs,2013-02-12T17:22Z,"No no no no no no...
Why did you fuck this game upp?!
I looked forward to this game so much, but just look at the gameplay, it looks like Counter Strike 1.6, and that game had better animations.
Graphics doesnt mean everything, but this is just too much.
I looked forward to this, just to get dissapointed.
This doesnt mean you wont like it but you cannot say this game is actually up to standard."

,aliendna99,2013-02-12T23:05Z,"@tmpwhore. Yeah cus you cant just start deamon tools when you need it, you have to have it running :FACEPALM:. and yes, using winrar to extract the 15gb isos that some games have doesnt take like 5 minutes. You fucking stupid piece of shit, go die. you dont deserve to live."
,cyberdude83,2013-02-12T23:47Z,"Game works, just installed it. Crack working inside.

But the graphics is very poor,  too much empty space around you, the xenomorphs look  good while they attack , but it is not that scary as in Dead space if you know what i mean.
  I would say Aliens versus Predator looked better than this , but that was 2 or 3 years ago.
THAT'S    why dear developers don't ever hold and delay  a project to long because it will end up like this with SHITTY , OUTDATED graphics.

Mr.Stifmeister  Thanks for the upload.

 Keep up the good work"

,Diablos_303,2013-02-13T01:42Z,"WOW, This torrent community is so fucking cruel!

Guys, 

Install winrar, open program, click file > open torrent > point at the SMALLEST part number, dont rename name... thats double handling.

You will see 1 file in winrar, the ISO image. extract it. it takes a few minutes.

Install a program that can mount or burn image files, i like SLYSOFT virtual clone drive. its free. and very very noob friendly.

Once you mount the image, its like putting a CD in your computer. or a USB in your computer.

The rest from here changes from game to game but usually.

Install as per normal, open the CD (image) and look for a crack or a readme. Copy this crack over the INSTALLED files, or refer to readme instructions.

Stop taking 20 minutes to type shit fuck idot cunt stupid noob go die.... and take 5 minutes to contribute a solution.

FURTHERMORE, the included crack did not work for me, i had to download a 80mb filed files pack, i did try a few versions prior, could just be me."

and as you read i was offering some help on getting a iso ,the crack folder is the fairlight folder, copy the binaries folder,to were you installed the game on pc  copy and REPLACE,have installed this on 5 pc.s and 2 of them have done the games already,so this is a good torrent crack n all,its the shit we have on our pc's that course the issues,my opinion again.........and agree about the shit coming outa some BOYS mouths........make it a better torrent and help people , one day you might need it.......

,juggsf1,2013-02-13T03:30Z,"none of the files can be mounted, but the instructions say ""mount"""
,OmniNegro,2013-02-13T03:46Z,"Here is some background for you idiots. Usenet is where these formats come from. If you make a part too big it complicates things and makes it a bitch to work.

Now days you can make them whatever size you want, but the old habits die hard.

These files are standard size for a Usenet post. You can actually bother to open Winrar or 7Zip and manually open the 001 file without ever renaming it. Either of those programs will recognize it when you do.

No need for amateur bullshittery. Leave the filenames alone.

And all you whiny bitches that think this is all stupid are just ignorant of a thing that is very likely twice your whiny bitch age. Usenet predates the ""Internet"" by a decade or more. Do not dare bitch about it. You do not have the right."

4. You will see file name flt-acma.iso, grab it with your mouse and move it on desktop or where ever you want, wait for file to copy and that is it
5. You will have flt-acma.iso and then you can mount it normally with poweriso or daemon tools"

,charlie.chinchilla,2013-02-14T15:29Z,@pink50 The reason people are bashing it is because its nothing like Gearbox promised. Everything they showed at E3 is no where in the game and for an ALIENS game why is there only 3 (THREE!!!!) Levels where you only fight aliens. Most of the game is based on shooting PEOPLE! A true Alien/Aliens Franchise fan would and have been appalled at this game. Its a disgrace to the movie franchise.

,kssamseed,2013-02-17T15:49Z,"I have loved the Aliens franchise ever since I saw Alien and Aliens in the 80s. I love this franchise and have been really looking forward to this game. I know from the get go I would play it purely for the story, since I have longed for a proper sequel to the Aliens movie. 

This game however, is a 6/10 for me. Just barely playable. 

Haven't finished it yet, so I can't rate the story, which I know is what all Alien fans will play it for,  but I'm finding it interesting so far. 

The game remains a 6/10 so far tho. I will finish it, but I won't buy this. 

Don't waste your money"
,Alan00000,2013-02-17T15:59Z,"OK i figured it out MARKUS332!
open file in utorrent
right click any file 
go to properties
then change file to open with winrar
then double click the file you changed to winrar
now move the iso onto your desktop takes a few minutes.
now you should be able to use Deamon tools on the file thats on your desktop. 
IT WORKED!"
,Alan00000,2013-02-17T16:03Z,"OK MARKUSS332 HERE IS THE FIX,
1.right click any FLT acme file
2.go to properties
3.change the file to winrar
4.now open the file you changed and move the ISO onto your desktop 
5. now you should be able to use deamon tools on the file you moved to your desktop.

worked great."

,GoMade,2013-02-18T02:52Z,"First of all- This game has its bugs. That is for sure. The first level is very off-putting and I'm not sure what the actual intent was. There are too many basic glitches. BUT! They only appeared to be on the first mission. After playing through it and reaching the planet the game starts to actually get good. 

The game is fun and VERY hard to stop playing once you get locked into it. If you are expecting Black OPs III graphics you wont see it,,, at FIRST.

It felt like an experiment during the first few levels, and then someone decided, 'HEY!!!, let's actually make a full game!!!'  

I promise you 95% of the bad reviews, especially in THIS thread are coming from 13 year old kids who never played the game, heard it was bad, and now are trying to make themselves look like internet bad asses here.

@tmpwhore. Yeah cus you cant just start deamon tools when you need it, you have to have it running :FACEPALM:. and yes, using winrar to extract the 15gb isos that some games have doesnt take like 5 minutes. You fucking stupid piece of shit, go die. you dont deserve to live.

Welcome to windows 8 you stupid idiot. The operating system that lets you mount ISO images by default. 

...and yes, you take the first file and extract it with WINRAR. That produces the ISO that you can mount how ever you please.

,Psythus,2013-02-21T03:14Z,"STORY!?!?! Idk why you'd play aliens/predator/whatever from this franchise for the story.... it's a fuckn fps. FPS games have never had a good story. Which is why half-life was one of the best to this date.... there was no story, you just; survived, and played on. If anything, I miss the FIRST AvP game where you could play all 3 of them. Gory, variety in playing each marine, alien, predator.... and not to mention it was TERRIFYING only being able to use your flashlight, or your proximity beeper.... as the beeps get closer and louder you never know where they'd pop out from! Since then, NO Aliens game has done shit but SUCK. The last avp was a horrid excuse and i'm not even going to d/l this when it's free for the taking."

The game itself, not so much... I had read/watched the reviews and thought ""No way it can be that bad, it just can't!"". I was wrong. It is *that* bad, and worse. The AI in this game is horrible, for both your allies and the enemies. O'Neal is almost always lost or in the way. He got stuck on a railing in a corridor, and I realized he wasn't there was when I got swamped by a horde of bugs, and really needed his ""help"".
