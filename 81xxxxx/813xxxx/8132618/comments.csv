,Malice181,2013-02-13T00:28Z,"I bought the hard-back before I downloaded it myself. Then I started correcting it. I forgot about the epilogue though, so there's that. :D But the errors were minimal when I went back and did them."

I read the .mobi with Kindle for PC. Yes there are still minor errors (I've read retail Kindle books with more), but nothing that detracted from a very enjoyable read.

Would've bought the eBook if it were available - very poor decision by the powers that be.

Many thanks to Micron66 and Malice181 for all the work it took to make this torrent!"
,Malice181,2013-02-27T03:56Z,Glad you enjoyed it.

Well done Malice. To put the effort of getting this book out in e-format. I salute you!"
