After being betrayed and left for dead in Italy, Charlie Croker and his team plan 
an elaborate gold heist against their former ally.

A gang of robbers, lead by career criminal Charlie Croker, create the largest 
traffic jam in Los Angeles history, giving them time to pull off a theft of gold 
bullion. They get away in their Mini Coopers, which are small enough to drive on 
sidewalks so they can make a clean get away before the traffic jam clears.
