HOWEVER this movie has been dubbed in English and the voice actors are REALLY BAD!   It's completely cringe-worthy (or laugh-inducing) to listen to these c-list, out of work porn actors murder their lines.

For those of you who like to hear the actors actual voices and don't mind subtitles, I would look here:

Dubbing should be banned."
