--------------------------------------------------------

AMC's exhilarating drama, The Walking Dead, returns for Season 3 which is expected
to include 16 episodes (actual number of episodes may vary). Coming off an action-
packed finale, Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) and his band of survivors continue to

Rick and the survivors must not only fight the dead, but also face a whole new fear:
the living.
