,tomcruz,2013-02-15T14:01Z,"Mate, would you upload Love exposure (2008)? IMDB link : http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1128075/ The smallest available blue ray copy is 1.72 GB by junoon. Its of 237 minutes. Please, let me know if you can."
,Mutegrill,2013-02-24T07:01Z,"You choking your up-speed leads to downloading a movie taking up to two days. I have a 28 KB/s connection, and downloading from ANY other keeps the speed smothly at between 20-28 KB/s, but your upload settings renders downloading fluctuating heavily, for long periods of times close to 0 KB/s. I don't think I have the wrong download settings (unlimited down and 15 KB/s up), so it's annoying!

I like your rips, but I'm sorry to say I have to turn to other uploaders with bigger files. It will lead to 12-15 hours downloading a movie, but rather that than days. You really should let your up-speed flow more freely! Sadly, there is no notyfication system when getting an answer on piratebay, so I wouldn't know if you desided to do so... :-("
