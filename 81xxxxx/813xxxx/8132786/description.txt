Sarah JaffeΓÇÖs 2010 debut full-length Suburban Nature began with simple measured strums on her acoustic guitar. The album wasnΓÇÖt completely spareΓÇöeventually slow pulls on the violin colored that opening song and JaffeΓÇÖs quivering vocals echoed to fill the empty spaces. But overall, it occupied that familiar ground between folk, roots rock and indie pop.

Her follow-up The Body Wins, however, starts off more like Rufus WainwrightΓÇÖs operatic electro-pop masterpiece Want One. On ΓÇ£Paul,ΓÇ¥ subtle electric guitar, woodwinds, organ and piano begin ever so quietly as Jaffe sings ΓÇ£On the seventh day, we set aside our brains/From an amateur hell/Regardless of age/And they will never know the things.ΓÇ¥ The song is followed immediately by brash horns on the title track, then keyboardsΓÇöboth industrial and playful on ΓÇ£Glorified High.ΓÇ¥ ItΓÇÖs a stylistic leap that works, preserving much of what made Suburban Nature so enjoyable. In hindsight, that album was a lovely baseline full of wonderful melodies and heartbreaking lyrics upon which to decorate lavishly with whatever she and producer John Congleton (St. Vincent, Wye Oak) might imagine.

On the middle third of the album, that direction is soulful and sad, punctuated by piano or organ and always that voiceΓÇöpowerful but restrained like deep water behind the dam. And that dam seems to be built from JaffeΓÇÖs uncertainties, an ever-present discomfort with her own skin and a tentative approach to relationships. ΓÇ£I gave you my guts, you gave me your limbs,ΓÇ¥ she accuses in the title track, and ΓÇ£Still a mannequin woman/CanΓÇÖt set myself in motion,ΓÇ¥ she adds in ΓÇ£Mannequin Woman.ΓÇ¥ Even ΓÇ£Hooray For LoveΓÇ¥ is sung like a dirgeΓÇömore of a commemoration of what was than a celebration of whatΓÇÖs to come.

Things donΓÇÖt really pick back up in tempo until ΓÇ£Sucker For Your Marketing,ΓÇ¥ with pounding drums, swelling stringsΓÇöplus a cynical outlook on love and a melody that will stick in your brain. And penultimate song ΓÇ£TalkΓÇ¥ clashes New Wave atmospherics against industrial beats. ΓÇ£I feel ignorant to be certain/Strung out like a fool/I know I donΓÇÖt need to/But I know that I want you.ΓÇ¥

ItΓÇÖs not an album for those walking blind into love, but for those expecting (and experiencing) heartbreak at every turn. But for all its lovely wallowing, it ends with the albumΓÇÖs most uplifting track, ΓÇ£When You Rest.ΓÇ¥ If not full of resolution, it at least allows for hopeΓÇöand that sliver of hope in JaffeΓÇÖs lyrics is surrounded musically by pure joy. Even when love doesnΓÇÖt last, itΓÇÖs always a source of beauty.
