The band and their friends are devastated by Jessie's hospitalisation, and
take turns to visit her. Louis is interviewed by police about events on
the night of Jessie's attack, and he tells them that he saw Julian when
he should have been on a train to Paris. The band have to be persuaded to
play without Jessie for the Imperial Hotel's Christmas lunch and they are
unsettled when a table of racist Germans walks out during the performance.
But the mood is lifted when news arrives that Jessie has woken from her coma.

For New Year's Eve, Lady Cremone holds a party on her estate. Everybody is
surprised when Julian turns up, announcing he has been in France exploring
a new business idea. The group goes into the village to hear the New Year
announced on a loudspeaker, and there is a joyous and romantic mood. In the
middle of the party, Louis confides to Sarah that he saw Julian at the hotel
the night of Jessie's attack. Stanley exacts revenge on the racists by
smuggling in Louis to play at a German Embassy party. The prank goes
brilliantly, but the friends' joy soon turns to tears when tragedy strikes
