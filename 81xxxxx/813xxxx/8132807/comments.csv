Yadif seemed to work fine in VLC to remove it.  Most people may not notice though but like most things with video, once you notice it, you can't stop!"

I don't think the studio did a very good job when they released these.

Still, for those who want to take a pass at making these perfect to their tastes, I have upped the VOB files. In any event, these are better than the existing torrent."
,stratego77,2013-02-13T11:32Z,We appreciate it!  Not enough people remember that the late 70's and 80's were the mini series renaissance.  This download should work for most people and it is of quite superior quality compared to the older one.  I'll download the VOB's and post my deinterlace settings.  You are right about the original DVD quality but thanks again for posting the best possible versions and giving us options.

[V],rambam1776,2013-02-19T03:04Z,"It's MKV, which means all video and audio tracks are built into the film. Just open it up with VLC and select the subtitles or audi track you like. I dunno if you can do that with WMP, but I haven't used it in years. Go VLC, you won't regret it:

Thanks for keeping this material alive.  I have been DL a lot of WWII classic movies the last few months and appreciate the Civil War just as important.  Will Rate both when I have a chance to review them."
