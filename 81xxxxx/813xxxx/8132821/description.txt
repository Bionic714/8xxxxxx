"Deus Ex Machina"

Sung, Hooten and Villanueva join forces to 
convince Trisha Miller, a 13-year-old girl with 
an advanced brain stem glioma, to try surgery 
one last time before giving up. Shaken from 
losing a patient, Ty turns to Dr. Tina Ridgeway 
for support. Meanwhile, Dr. Buck Tierney tries 
to bully resident Michelle Robideux into 
pronouncing a potential organ donor brain dead. 
And Sydney enlists Villanueva's help diagnosing 
a patient under the care of internist Dr. John 
Lieberman.
