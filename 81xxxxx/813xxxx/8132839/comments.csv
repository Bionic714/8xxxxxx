,IsItReally,2013-02-12T15:13Z,"I am trying to use this on SLIC-activated Windows Server 2008 R2. I try to 'Run as Administrator' but nothing happens.

So I tried to extract the contents of the archive and run manually. What's the password? 'masterblaster666' doesn't work.

,IsItReally,2013-02-12T23:30Z,"@Arkenstone: That is the problem. I try to run that executable as Administrator, and nothing happens. There's no GUI, no process in Task Manager with a name beginning with 'qemu'."
,IsItReally,2013-02-13T15:11Z,"I ran the app as normal user and I saw the 'qemu' process in Task Manager for about a second or two (no more) after which it was gone. How do I know if it worked or crashed?

I know you didn't create the application, but why is there no GUI? This is just not very good design. Is it supposed to run as a daemon/service? If yes, why so, if it is designed to actually work once in 180 days?

This is not in any way to imply that I ungrateful; it is just that the design decisions flummox me."
