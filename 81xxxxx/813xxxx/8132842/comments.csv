,EllisD4u2,2013-02-13T08:41Z,"Hey fuckface vermvalent,go troll somewhere else you cunt. Thank you eztv. This is the episode of next Sunday. Thanks for all your work eztv. Password protected? You're a fucking joke vermvalent,are you a Showtime exec? "
,snakesweat,2013-02-14T01:15Z,"Not fake.  Showtime is releasing these a week early with their ""on demand"" feature.  Look for the skull next to the username.  EZTV with a skull is always legit.  

vermvalent, suck it.

,ziuber18,2013-02-18T14:03Z,how come this episode has 218MB and the walking dead above 470?
,G4MBA,2013-02-18T14:45Z,ziuber18 because TWD is longer?
,ziuber18,2013-02-20T01:00Z,aahh sorry. My bad. I thought both californiacation and TWD were about 50 minutes long.
,dodo_dudut,2013-02-23T21:40Z,"Great episode, nice plot so far. Storyline is intelligent and i wouldn't change it even a bit. Quality - A10 V10. I usually watch everything at film.plotar.org	because they always have HD but they don't have tv shows so having TPB for TVshows is great, thnx!"
,Teshin,2013-03-05T03:33Z,"thank you for the dedication, work and time you put into uploading torrents for the poor people! it's much appreciated"
