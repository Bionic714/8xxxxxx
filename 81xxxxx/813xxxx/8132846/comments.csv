,jalucian,2013-02-25T03:52Z,"The quality on this one is good as well, pro346pro. My bitrates and file sizes are optimized for those who store and watch movies on their computers. The bitrates are high enough to look perfect on ""normal"" sized monitors and low enough to keep download times short and the file size small enough for those who have storage concerns on their hard drives. If you plan on watching something on a large HD screen, you're going to need one of the larger file size, higher bitrate torrents. The larger the screen you'll be watching on, the higher the bitrate has to be to maintain picture quality. If you have a large screen, you'll need to experiment too see what bitrate it takes to maintain a quality picture for you particular size screen.

The only reason the other torrent of this in 1080p (the Kingdom release) might look better is if you're viewing on a very large screen, because at computer monitor sized screens, anything above 2000 or so bitrate is just overkill. The kingdom release is also in 5.1 audio, which is another reason its unnecessarily large compared to mine. Like I said, my encodes are for the many who watch movies on their computers, usually with headphones... not for those few who plan on watching on 50"" screens with 5.1 surround."
