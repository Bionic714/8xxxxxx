Editorial Reviews
From the Publisher
I think this is one of the most exciting, inspiring books I've ever read. Humankind, faced with overwhelming cataclysm, regroups to fight its way back to civilization.

It is a story with brain and heart--and a lot of both--and I can't figure how it missed that list of the hundred best books of the century.

But for the terrified men and women chance had saved, it was also the dawn of a new struggle for survival--a struggle more dangerous and challenging than any they had ever known....
"Massively entertaining."
