Also, Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash remain unplayable, sadly."
,Gomen,2013-02-12T12:12Z,"No Flutters? Pity, I understand the absence of Rainbow but FS looked pretty much completed in the last demo videos. 
Nevertheless, I'm very much grateful for this leak."
,Evostorm,2013-02-12T13:17Z,"...Please, next time, message me via YT or whatever before uploading this. Also, this is the same build as the EVO2K one, except for some personal modifications that I made, like extra stages, Story Mode (CPU) and Team VS."

,pdragoon,2013-02-12T19:44Z,"Thank YOU! I hope Hasbro can be convinced to take back the C&D, but if not... Well, at least we still have this to remember the project by... :'( "
,Khith,2013-02-13T01:25Z,"The game works great, though I can apparently only use my analog stick on a 360 controller. I can't remap to the gamepad. (might try JoyToKey though) I found movelists online which is practically a necessity.

I'm quite sad that this has been hit with a C&D, but I hope that they can work something out with Hasbro. There are also a few petitions online. The finished game would have been amazing.

Note: I DID get a virus detection in the EXE by Avast, labeling it as a suspicious file. This seems to be a false positive."
,musclestud1,2013-02-14T02:08Z,Great game! But where are more instructions??
,Khith,2013-02-14T04:04Z,"I found a good move list here: http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120916190720/mlpfanart/images/3/35/Full_move_list_Fighting_is_Magic.jpg

Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy are unplayable at this point in the game, so their moves are not included."
,MMK314,2013-02-15T13:39Z,"I think this not from mane6 but it's a mod by ohter :

- lot of bugs (in select screen, the gravitation in sugarcube corner...)
- old typo for number of hits (not same as in the fluttershy trailer)
- no FT, no RD
- it's not the moment for the team to leak a such bad version

SO, thank you to NOT lying about this, it's not good for mane6 and for fans. It's not a problem to put this on the Bay, but please, if this not from Mane6 as I think, DO NOT say it is."
,zemryis,2013-02-17T11:03Z,thx! awesome. stupid hasbro. i hope to play as rainbow dash & fluttershy soon!
,critiqal,2013-02-17T17:05Z,I'm crying because Hasbro fcked up FiM >_
,Xr1s,2013-03-03T00:49Z,This is so good! Haven't had this much fun with a fighting game since Super Smash Bros. I hope Ha$bro works something out with Mane6 to make this game happen. :(
,N-Kush,2013-03-08T18:23Z,No fluttershy...? Well I'm still hoping to see where this project goes. Hopefully they don't all get scared off by Hasbro's S&D
