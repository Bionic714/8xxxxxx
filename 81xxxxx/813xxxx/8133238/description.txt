While tribute albums nowadays are commonplace, a quick examination of history 30 years ago shows 
us that it wasn't always thus. And when they did occur, it was usually a tip of the hat to some 
long-standing show-business icon like Al Jolson. Certainly departed country music stars like Hank 
Williams were considered outside the pale of such honors, which is only one of the reasons why 
this tribute album by rocker Del Shannon stands out as being something rarified and great. Shannon 
-- like most aspiring rockers -- grew up on Williams' songs and once success allowed him to show 
that side of his musical equation, he jumped at the opporunity. But rather than cutting a dozen 
tepid updates of Hank's best ("Kaw-LIga," "Your Cheatin' Heart," "I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry," 
"Hey Good Lookin," etc.), awash in a sea of strings and female choruses, Shannon was smart enough 
to keep the music firmly in the style of Williams' backup band, the Drifting Cowboys. Although 
several Motown session players -- including Dennis "Scorpio" Coffey on lead guitar -- are on this 
session, the net result is heartfelt, understated country music with plenty of steel guitar to the 
fore, the kind you'd hear at the kinds of beer halls in Saginaw, MI, where Shannon honed his craft. 
Del sings the songs straight, minus any of his trademarked falsetto embellishments, and the result 
is one of the best straight forward country albums you'll ever hear.
