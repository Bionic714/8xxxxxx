"
,matzsd98,2013-02-12T14:52Z,Guys please seed!
,Sunray54,2013-02-18T03:40Z,"Thanks so much for the movie! Looks like a great copy from glancing through it. However, it took about 7 hours to download today and even with the huge number of seeders listed here it looks like there were never more than about 28 active."
,darkphobos,2013-02-19T15:09Z,"Great torrent, thanks!"
,usmckill,2013-02-20T22:33Z,"Maybe I'm just ignorant, but why is it that some BR 1080p rips are 1-2gb and others are fuckin 8g+?
If I'm transferring movies to a flash drive to watch on my 60LED TV what is the best file type/size to get?"
,Ronalds550,2013-02-22T09:46Z,"@usmckill

Unless compression tech has improved monumentally I don't believe that a full length movie could be only 1-2GB and still be a full 1080p Blu-Ray rip. Reason is because DVD = 4.7GB and Blu-Ray = 25GB, assuming each type is only a single layer disc.

Now a TV show which is only 40-45min in 720p is 1-1.4GB. So I don't see how a 1080p movie could only be 1 or 2GB. 

Please, correct me if I'm wrong."
,hurricanhill,2013-02-22T16:42Z,When i play it back in theres an echo. any ideas?
,MarceloTF,2013-02-23T08:05Z,"@hurricanhill Your player is probably playing the two audio streams at the same time, I suggest you to try a better player, like VLC Player or Media Player Classic."
,MarceloTF,2013-02-23T08:10Z,"@usmckill The reason these files are smaller is the bitrate of the video stream, these files with 8GB+ has a larger bitrate, the difference it gives it adds more detail to the movie, more crisp quality, but some people cant even notice the diff, while others do.

I suggest you to download this file and watch on your TV if you like the quality maybe you should stick with the smaller files."
,mexicoflor,2013-02-25T10:44Z,"Thank you soooo much for this, what a great movie!  Quality fabulous too, we really appreciate you here in Mexico - BIG thanks."
,blackbarsnope,2013-02-27T13:55Z,"why does it have dual audio?
can my 2.1 speaker sys play the higher bit rate?
i m a new Zen_Bud fan.! Just switched from YIFY who gives only 96kbps 2 channel audio "
,8BADX,2013-02-28T21:48Z,Thanks man... u make my day
,StayPlation,2013-03-02T17:26Z,Quality anyone?
,gigas27,2013-03-03T04:31Z,"Movie echoes in quick time, doesn't work correctly with VLC, and on the TV it crashes half way through.  Otherwise it seemed like a great quality movie.  Gotta say download a different copy!"
[V],Zen_Bud,2013-03-03T07:36Z,gigas27 ->PEBKAC
,dantron-z,2013-03-09T23:54Z,i'm new to torrents and may be a PEBKAC but I am also getting the echo. solution?
[V],Zen_Bud,2013-03-11T11:02Z,"@dantron-z  you forget that you also are a troll zzzzzz
"
[V],Zen_Bud,2013-03-11T11:06Z,"The solution is too make a choice  if you want 5.1 channel audio or the 2.0,
maybe some players play both at same time, 
remember that this torrent have been DL more than 20000 times :)"
