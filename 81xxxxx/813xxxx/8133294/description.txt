The #1 New York Times bestselling author Jonathan KellermanΓÇÖs ΓÇ£psychology skills and dark imagination are a potent literary mixΓÇ¥ (Los Angeles Times), and this intensely thrilling blend has never been so powerful as in the acclaimed authorΓÇÖs new novel of murder and madness among the beautiful dreamers, seductive predators, and doomed innocents adrift in the glare of Southern CaliforniaΓÇÖs eternal sunshine.

A series of horrifying events occur in quick succession in the same upscale L.A. neighborhood. A backyard renovation unearths an infantΓÇÖs body, buried sixty years ago. And soon thereafter in a nearby park, another disturbingly bizarre discovery is made not far from the body of a young woman shot in the head. Helping LAPD homicide detective Milo Sturgis to link these eerie incidents is brilliant psychologist Alex Delaware. But even the good doctorΓÇÖs vast experience with matters both clinical and criminal might not be enough to cut down to the bone of this chilling caseΓÇöand draw out the disturbing truth.

Backtracking six decades into the past stirs up tales of a beautiful nurse with a mystery lover, a handsome, wealthy doctor who seems too good to be true, and a hospital with a notorious reputationΓÇöall of them long gone, along with any records of a newborn, and destined for anonymity. But the specter of fame rears its head when the case unexpectedly twists in the direction of the highest echelons of celebrity privilege. Entering this sheltered world, Alex little imagines the macabre layer just below the surfaceΓÇöa decadent quagmire of unholy rituals and grisly sacrifice.

Before their work is done, Alex and Milo, ΓÇ£the most original whodunit duo since Watson and HolmesΓÇ¥ (Forbes), must confront a fanatically deranged mind of such monstrous cunning that even the most depraved madman would shudder.
