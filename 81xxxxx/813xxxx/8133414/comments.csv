I live in Mongolia. You can't get Comedy Central here and electronic equipment is extremely expensive. 

One of my few pleasures is reclining on my couch and watching The Daily Show and the Colbert Report on my TV, and my DVD player only plays XVID (if you want one that also plays x264, you'll have to shell out at least $300).

So, I, being that almost no one is posting XVIDs anymore, I, and many others would very much appreciate it if you would also put up the Report in XVID."

Terrible ""LMAO glitch"" @ 16:40 causing sound sync problems.
Usually 2HD does a ""proper"", but hasn't so far.
.
Which normally would put the kaibash on me doing anything LMAO
that I don't screen first. But since an LMAO glitch ALWAYS
causes sync problems, I've checked and the latest Colbert is in sync.
.
Normally, AFG does all of this, but since they haven't done the 12th,
I'll make an exception and do this ONE for you now.
.
Oh, you should know that TvTeam and other ""Scene"" distros will never give you an XVID.
