As an example, if you go to page 4 of the book and look at the paragraph below figure 1.1. You will find that the book has the first sentences of that paragraph, but, then the rest of them are missing.

I would greatly appreciate if you or some one else could upload a good, complete copy of this book."

This other copy of the book seems MUCH better and CLEANER and COMPLETE: http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7950276/Software_Projects_Secrets_V413HAV.

HTH."
