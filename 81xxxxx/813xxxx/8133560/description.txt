In the 24th century, the planet's fossil fuels have been completely consumed, forcing humanity to use solar power as the primary source of energy. A huge solar energy system orbiting the planet was eventually built, anchored to the Earth and providing it with power through three orbital space elevators. As a result of the expense of such a large-scale project, most the world consolidated into three factions: the Union, the Human Reform League, and the AEU. Despite their common reliance on the fragile orbital elevators for energy, however, humanity still continues to constantly fight wars and build up arms. A paramilitary organization called Celestial Being, equipped with incredibly powerful mobile suits called Gundams, fight in order to force humanity to unite and eradicate armed conflict.
