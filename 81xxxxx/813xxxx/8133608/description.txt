There's something funny about those two new priests. In fact, there's 
something downright hilarious. Because Robert De Niro and Sean Penn 
aren't clergymen at all. They're escaped cons whose only prayer is to 
pass themselves off as men of the cloth... and pass right by a police 
blockade at the border and into the safety of Canada. Demi Moore joins 
De Niro and Penn in this clever romp scripted by David Mamet. The cons 
are loose and the comedy is on. It'll be a sin to miss it!

Stars: Robert De Niro, Sean Penn
