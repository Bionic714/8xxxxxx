Ep 13: Game of Scones

Adrienne and Brandi come face-to-face (and to blows) at Lisa's tea party.

PREMIERE: Monday February 11, 9:00 pm

Kyle pays a visit to Lisa's to discuss the mutual hurt in their relationship: Lisa is upset Kyle doesn't defend her, and Kyle says Lisa holds a grudge. A truce is reached, but it's not exactly resolved. More unresolved issues are addressed when Lisa throws a tea party in her beautiful olive grove, and it's the first time Adrienne and Brandi have faced each other since their big blow-up. It's civil at first, but denials and accusations fly when a tipsy Taylor asks whether or not Adrienne is suing Brandi.
