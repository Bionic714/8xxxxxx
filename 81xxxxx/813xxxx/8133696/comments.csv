,choekstr,2013-02-12T20:50Z,"Works fine, installed in less than 3 minutes on an SSD but the HUD in game while playing is 3D.  Anyone know how to turn off the 3D HUD?  There is no settings menu option for it so it must be in the config .ini files somewhere? 

Running ATI video card in case the answer is something Nvidia specific..."

,TaleMunja,2013-02-24T21:37Z," @nosTeam
This works perfect, thank you for upload.

 Is there any chance to do Crysis 3? There is no proper torrent at all, i don't see anyone else capable.
 So..It will be seriously most popular torrent ever because obviously is very hard to crack it.

 Thanx anyway, so far i don't see any quality Crysis 3 torrent and i hope you guys will make it possible for us who don't have deep pockets."
