ΓÇ£Ashe is a band with no past and no future. What better to serve as the soundtrack to the hollow existence of a nation of zombies? Asleep at the wheel, we are content to follow the pattern set before us, the dull but safe path . . . Wake up! Live. History is what the people of the present wish it to be. Make a new story, choose a new path. 

This music is dedicated to the middle children of history, to those who question what they are sold, to those who are not content with easy answers or the easy way out, and those who can see past media hype, consumerism, and spin.ΓÇ¥
