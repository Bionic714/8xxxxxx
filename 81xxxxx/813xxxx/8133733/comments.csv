,Bl4ck0ut1,2013-02-12T14:11Z,Does this download support Co-op over hamachi?
,rockodss,2013-02-12T14:13Z,"you don't need keygen, don't follow aliens89 link. Spam retard.   Nice torrent as always, can't expect less coming from extremezone, but the game itself is just shit.... shame on Gearbox..."
,OmniNegro,2013-02-12T14:23Z,"Anytime someone posts a link to an external site for a crack or keygen, it is spam and not to be trusted. It will always be malware, and usually dressed up as an official scene release. 

If you ever go to those sites, you will regret it.

This is TPB, and only the skull and crossbone users content is safe. Sometimes their accounts get stolen and they cannot be trusted. Usually that lasts no more than a few hours before the account is locked.

Trust only the skull and crossbones users."
,durbzBoi,2013-02-12T16:11Z,WARNING : Prepare to hate the game
,Koca114,2013-02-12T18:08Z,"Great game, fast downloading. Thanks man. Seeding."
,fatzx2,2013-02-12T18:18Z,awesome!!! thx extremezone!!!
,partyhardy247,2013-02-12T18:34Z,The reviewers say this is worse than AVP released few years back.  :(  I had high hopes for this.  We don't have really strong start in 2013 in terms of gaming.   What's up with that.
,johnyl1,2013-02-12T18:46Z,Anyone managed to play on LAN???
,Vitez544,2013-02-12T19:09Z,"Game works perfectly. 
Thanks EZ !!"
,Galaksy1,2013-02-12T19:37Z,Nice game. :)
,RedskinsGM2B,2013-02-12T20:04Z,"DON'T listen to these losers!  THIS GAME IS AWESOME!!!   Yes, it's ""challenging"".  But, it's a GREAT GAME!  Just because these morons can't survive...they're gonna hate on it. LMMFAO  It's a SURVIVAL GAME!  It's supposed to be difficult & disorienting & frantic.  "
,bobbyseandad,2013-02-12T21:03Z,Daemon tools would not mount?
,momolbfr,2013-02-12T23:10Z,worst game ever 
,rockodss,2013-02-13T00:26Z,"@RedskinsGM2B  We are not saying the game is bad because its difficult lol. are you a moron or something? 
1. its NOT difficult ,
2. AI is dumb as shit even on hardest. 
3.Doesnt feel survival at all.
4. Mostly all websites categorize it as FPS, which is what it feels like after the first 2 missions.
5. Multiplayer is fun for 1 hour , which you cant play anyway, not till tunngle server are up, if ever there is.
6.feels like a 2004 game. I would compare it to DOOM3/duke nukem gameplay feeling. 
7.average of 5/10 score....

8. plz go head and download it to forge your own opinion, but if you played any other AVP/aliens before. prepare to be disapointed"
,tebrasin,2013-02-13T00:49Z,"The game runs fine,people this game is such bullshit,the graphics are crap,i can not play this shit..."
,limneos,2013-02-13T07:44Z,"this game is awesome, i downloaded and played. People say it bad because they lick ign's ass and play games that have 9.0+ on their website"

,LowBlow88,2013-02-16T01:10Z,i didint get singel ISO but what i did get was like 50 another files :O whats the problem?
,Sint69,2013-02-16T13:51Z,"WORK 100% (mount - powerISO)
run setup.exe from virtual DVD-drive
copy dir-binaries to game folder

you can setup in NVIDIA control panel
8xCSAA in enchance game
nad max 2 pre-rendered frames
it much better for quality and performance
its not the same with every game
this one doesn't need so much graphic and can render 2 frames in front (better responsivnes for mouse and keys)

I got GTX 650 OC 1GB
and is great (GOOD game - fast action)"
