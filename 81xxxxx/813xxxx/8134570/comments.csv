[V],Mr.Stifmeister,2013-02-12T16:50Z,"Update Includes:

- Added new, super high quality anti-aliasing  Super Sample Anti Aliasing. Users can enable it by toggling SSAA in the visual settings.
- Lots of fixes to various gameplay bugs that could cause characters or items to go missing, especially after loading from saves in certain spots.
- Fixed the bug that could cause the game to very rarely write out garbage/invalid save files."
