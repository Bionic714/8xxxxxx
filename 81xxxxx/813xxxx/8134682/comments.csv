,windowsguru44,2013-02-12T20:57Z,"The longhorn refers to the visual styles included and icons. This is Windows 7 ultimate SP1 plus all security updates until now, also the latest drivers"
,htsl,2013-02-12T21:54Z,"O ok, Thank you much for clarifying timely."
,Tisak11,2013-02-15T01:23Z,Windows will not boot!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,iamcims,2013-02-15T08:43Z,"WARNING!!! DO NOT GET THIS ISO!

This is an edited version of windows. I wasted a lot of valuable time thinking it was just Win7 with all the updates. Not only is the entire theme different (start menu, etc) using very poor looking textures. The icons, colors, wallpapers are all different as well. And there is no way of changing them to the default, the default icons/settings have been removed. What is worse is normal functions do not work either, like dragging an icon on the desktop creates a shortcut (cannot drag). Double clicking opens properties instead of the folder. Just all wacked out. The entire image is branded by some kid who had way to much time on his hands putting this together. If it worked fine, I wouldn't care to be honest. But it is neither functinoal or appealing. You will regret it!"

,windowsguru44,2013-02-15T23:17Z,"thanks for response what you are experiencing is your keyboard, not the OS. Easy fix just have to hit shift key 3 times, then hit the ctrl key 3 times.
and the keys will unstick. No point posting several times bashing my build, when its your keyboard asshole."
,Trevor1978,2013-02-16T13:56Z,Hi windowsguru44 forget what these other assholes are saying about your torrent. I have it installed on my system and it works awesome. You've got no complaints from me. Keep up the good work!!

,tonarpos,2013-03-12T18:01Z,"joetoads, try downloading the latest windows loader but be sure to use a trusted source, i think the latest version is 2.2, run it and you should be activated, hope this works."
,tonarpos,2013-03-12T18:17Z,"joetoads, just checked the list and it appears the latest version is 2.2.1, i'd go with the one from murphy78 as i've used his torrents and they're always the dogs bollocks."

,dan9100,2013-04-13T09:40Z,"I have tried several versions of Win 7 x64 and by far, this is the best version I tried. Didn't check for viruses but it worked great.
Thanks for the trial."
