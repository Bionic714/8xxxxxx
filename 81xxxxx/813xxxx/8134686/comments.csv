SP Campaign is working beautifully so far with absolutely no issues. 

DLC rifle works as well and is in your inventory when you get into the game. 

MP is not present but such is to be expected in a repack and tbh, the campaign is plenty of fun and will make you want to buy a copy for MP.

Don't mistake the glitchy writing for an issue at initial launch of install file just change language to English at bottom left by hitting 'En' button labelled as such."
