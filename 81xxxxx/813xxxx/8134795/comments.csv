,TW63684,2013-02-14T07:37Z,"I'm having a little trouble with the sound, maybe it was the download. but I have the communist codec and every thing. There seems to be a good 60 second delay between the sound and the video."

,djmixmode,2013-02-16T19:10Z,How do you get the Xbox360 to recognize MP4 formats? I can only view AVI's on mine. It says MP4 and MKV formats are unrecognizable.
,nivagm97,2013-02-16T22:19Z,yeah..whenever im done downloading i have it on automatic seed. so whenever my computer is on and i have wifi i always always always seed :)
,Boston3417,2013-02-17T16:16Z,@ djmixmode you have to download an update to get the 360 to play mp4's. For some reason I can't get my 360 to play anything between 400-800 MB in size but over and under have been good
,mexicoflor,2013-02-19T05:36Z,"Awesome, thank you so much, sound, picture great - this has become on of my favourite bond movies of all time.  Rule Britannia!"
,PsionicPhazon,2013-02-19T14:32Z,"@djmixmode: Get Format Factory or some other program that converts files, and change it from Mp4 to AVI. I do it all the time. "
,sgtballz,2013-02-20T05:43Z,Awesome quality for the size of the file.  Thanks Zen_Bud !
,70351,2013-02-22T13:45Z,"Excellent quality. No problems with sound or otherwise. No BS of any kind.

This is the way all movie downloads should be done. End of story."
