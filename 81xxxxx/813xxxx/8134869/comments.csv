[V],thegreenfrog,2013-02-13T00:35Z,"At $ 7.95 for a lifetime license, it is not worth the trouble.

If it works as advertised this is an incredible value that every Mac user should have no matter what, even if it is 'experimental' as the company says.

Anyhow, how would you crack a software that works by constantly communicating with the mother ship to work?

I am definitely getting this thing. Right now."

The application updates it's LOCAL database with data provided by well known phishing threat data providers and matches URLs you are visiting against this LOCAL database. We DO NOT save ANY web browsing history."
