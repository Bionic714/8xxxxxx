,Mrparonomasiac,2013-02-19T02:19Z,Russian source again. :(
,systemhost,2013-02-20T09:47Z,It only has one audio track of which is in English so I have no idea where a Russian sound track is coming from. I just checked the file again with zero issues on vlc. I'm sorry if it's not playing right for you.
,Mrparonomasiac,2013-02-20T10:17Z,"@systemhost; Sorry, meant to clarify; the on-screen ""setting text"" preceding each story is in Cyrillic instead of English. Had to Wiki the movie to figure out what the English equivalent was...

Otherwise, Great post.. A10/V10 "

Thanks to all seeders and leechers - Will seed to at least 20"
