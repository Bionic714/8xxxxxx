,ChasUGC,2013-03-15T04:00Z,"@GusGuzz - Thank you for the upload and that comment. This is not a movie critics forum.

I wish someone would instead critique the quality and whether the hard coded subs interfere with watching the movie. Personally, I thought the first Part was very interesting."

If you want drivel, take a look at your own comment. It totally lacks reasonable support to your loose claims. 

It's pretty obvious you're a agenda driven moron hooked on social democratic steal and share mentality. ""Viking"" + ""don't like Ayn Rand"" + ""movie is bad"". Enough said."
