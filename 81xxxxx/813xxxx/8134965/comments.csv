,habbytant,2013-02-15T21:15Z,"Hey guys its as simple as following directions.. Look in the description beside the Requires heading. It plain as day reads ""DVD 9"". Now you shouldn't have to ask if its dual layer.

For those new to this. Remember this for the future... DVD9 is dual layer. Also he even post layer break @1913776. 

Happy downloading.. SEED!"
