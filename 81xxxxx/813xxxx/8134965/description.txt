The game works fine on my NTSC console I suppose it's NTSC
To works requires hard drive preferably official microsoft
if not, need to use Xplorer 360 and restore partition 2.
It is also good to use the upgrade file in November 2007 for original Xbox games
Not used abgx360 I did the. Dvd with ImgBurn layer break is 1913776
