Inception is a 2010 American action science fiction and heist-themed film written, co-produced, and directed by Christopher Nolan. The film stars a large ensemble cast that includes Leonardo DiCaprio, Ken Watanabe, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Dileep Rao, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, and Michael Caine. DiCaprio plays Dom Cobb, a thief who commits corporate espionage by infiltrating the subconscious of his targets. He is offered a chance to regain his old life as payment for a task considered to be impossible: "inception", the implantation of another person's idea into a target's subconscious.[6]
Shortly after finishing Insomnia (2002),[7] Nolan wrote an 80-page treatment about "dream stealers" and presented the idea to Warner Bros., envisioned as a horror film inspired by lucid dreaming.[8] Feeling he needed to have more experience with large-scale film production, Nolan retired the project and instead worked on Batman Begins (2005), The Prestige (2006), and The Dark Knight (2008).[9] He spent six months polishing the script before Warner Bros. purchased it in February 2009.[10] Inception was filmed in six countries and four continents, beginning in Tokyo on June 19, 2009, and finishing in Canada on November 22, 2009.[11] Its official budget was US$160 million, a cost which was split between Warner Bros and Legendary Pictures.[4] Nolan's reputation and success with The Dark Knight helped secure the film's $100 million in advertising expenditure,[4] with most of the publicity involving viral marketing.
Inception premiered in London on July 8, 2010, and was released in both conventional and IMAX theaters on July 16, 2010.[12][13] A box office success, Inception has grossed over $800 million worldwide becoming one of the highest-grossing films of all time.[5] The home video market also had strong results, with $68 million in DVD sales. Inception has received wide critical acclaim and numerous critics have praised its originality, cast, score, and visual effects.[14] It won Academy Awards for Best Visual Effects, Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Cinematography, and was also nominated for four more: Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay, Best Original Score, and Best Art Direction.
