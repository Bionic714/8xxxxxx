I've been picking up issues here and there , then going through and re-naming them to get them to be filed in the right order, so I know how much work you put into this.  Thanks to you I can just sit back, relax, and read my fave superhero stories without hassle.  If you were here I'd kiss you...no I wouldn't, that's just wrong.  But I do appreciate it, you're the man.  Thanks again!!"
