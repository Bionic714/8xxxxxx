Deception isn't just the name of the Colourfield's second album; it's also vocalist Terry Hall's modus operandi. Underneath the surface of Hall's seemingly cheerful melodies is always a bummed-out lyric or two, and he wastes no time on Deception. Amidst the jolly xylophones of "From Dawn to Distraction," the second track on the LP, Hall sings, "Nothing is enough/In a world without love." "Digging It Deep" emulates the same formula: hook listeners with a danceable beat while hurling unsettling revelations like "Oh how I wish I love the human race/Oh how I wish I had a pretty face." There's probably no one who is having as much fun being depressed than Hall. While Deception is slicker than the Colourfield's debut album, Virgins and Philistines, Hall's songwriting hasn't softened; he can still tell sad stories with acid-tongued wit and a barrel full of empathy. On the haunting "Miss Texas 1967," Hall narrates a tale of faded beauty with deeply felt compassion. With its lovely acoustic guitars, "Miss Texas 1967" more closely resembles the intimate sound of Virgins and Philistines than Deception's glossy production. The robotic percussion and blaring horns of the band's cover of Sly & the Family Stone's "Running Away" might revolt indie pop purists with no tolerance for '80s dance music; however, it nicely shows off Hall's stylistic range, and "Goodbye Sun Valley" is a rousing homage to cabaret. Deception may wallow in its misery, but at least it does so with a smile on its face.
