Charley Boorman's South African Adventure
Join Adventurer Charley Boorman as he sets off once more on an epic motorbike adventure, this time making his way through the stunning, rugged and often unknown South Africa. Teaming up once again with producer/director Russ Malkin, they journey in a circular route starting and finishing in Cape Town, taking on all corners of this wild and varied African country, experiencing the deeply rooted cultures, the extraordinary people, the remarkable wildlife and the heart stopping adventures along the way. An abseil from the peak of Cape Town s iconic Table Mountain plunges Charley straight in to the start of his adventure. Following this he embarks on a journey of extremes that includes cage diving with deadly Great White Sharks in the rough Atlantic seas; navigating the majestic yet incredibly precarious Sani Pass to reach the icy peak; detonating dynamite deep underground in a Barberton Gold Mine; tracking lions on foot in the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park; and searching the ocean floor for the perfect diamond in the ship wreck strewn West Coast. The incredible trip culminates in a huge motorbike convoy down to Signal Hill in Cape Town accompanied by over 250 local riders.




2)  Part 2 
This week, Charley's trip starts just south of Durban where he is trying his hand at a spot of surfing amongst some of the country's largest and fastest waves. Then he faces one of South Africa's most challenging adventures - successfully navigating the Sani Pass. Leading up through the mountains towards Lesotho, Charley and team take a car up the treacherously steep and extremely icy path to the summit. This is a nerve-racking drive, during which one false move could see them plunge over a sheer mountain drop. Continuing their adventure towards the clouds, the team embark on a challenging trek to the top of Tugela Falls, enduring icy cold winds before setting up camp on the summit.
