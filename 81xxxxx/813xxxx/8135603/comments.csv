[V],PirateBoy,2013-02-13T03:48Z,"@ smoozable

we dont do requests. we were already working on the aliens game before the request was posted. anyways, have patience because your game might be done when we have some free time"
,rocksbury,2013-02-13T04:53Z,"I didnt listen to any of the reviews. This game is just as good as any other fps.
I think it could use a few patches but what game doesnt, especially day one patches.
Love and respect for the pirate community.
Now if multiplayer could be crack, not just this title but in general my life would be complete."
,smoozable,2013-02-13T05:08Z,"@ PirateBoy

,FBIOBSERVER,2013-02-13T13:08Z,"Good to see KAOS back in business,Thank you as always"
,Miatakias83,2013-02-13T14:25Z,guys does this game work online multiplayer?
,hopedeny,2013-02-13T15:05Z,i dont care how compact it is. dont bother playing this POS. you want aliens? play AVP 2.
,PseudoPositive,2013-02-14T08:13Z,"Game works well, thanks gansuk, nice upload as usual, will look forward to your next up, cheers buddy."

,druskov,2013-02-14T20:38Z,Someone seed ffs Im only getting 100 kb/s at the most
,V1LE,2013-02-15T03:05Z,"thx, I'm Ignoring the reviews and going to see for myself. Will seed and report back."
,aarJunn,2013-02-15T10:25Z,"My game stops working as soon as I recover inside the tunnel just after a man falls on his head on the tunnel outer top...
I could use some help if any one pleases so...  "
,CerebralStormer,2013-02-15T14:52Z,"@VILE, I'm a fair way through the game, & I ignored the reviews as well. Last time I checked, gamespot gave it a 4.5 (Poor), but I'm loving this game; I've  played AVP2 & loved it too, but a 4.5 for this game, to me , is stupid. This is a classic FPS game all the way, with good graphics & 360 controller suport, I would give this a 7.5 so far; I say thank you to gansuk & seeders, the game IS worth it."
,hhhhhhhhhh1977,2013-02-17T04:42Z,is this work?
,tman45005,2013-02-17T13:45Z,"hey! wen i open the game, the screen freezes for about 5 seconds, then i get a blue screen and my pc restarts, same thing happend with me on borderlands 2- Kaos, pleeeees help! thanks!"
,crossebby,2013-02-19T17:05Z,"@tman
Always mention Ur specs with the problem, 

Its happened in my case too with border lands 2 and assassins creed 3, I got GTX260 and 600Watt power supply, just after few minutes after launching the game there is ""blank screen(any color)"" but there is audio and I can't go back to windows, I had to restart the whole PC.

First I removed the ""Rivatuner"" which I use to increase the fan speed f the graphic card, it didn't worked then I removed all the cables and cleaned the dust and re-installed the GPU again, its seems to be working for now. If these both don't work then its defiantly Ur PSU problem, change to Corsair PSUs.

Its only my experience,   can't be sure, hope it helps."
