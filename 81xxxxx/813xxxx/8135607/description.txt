Saint Young Men (聖☆おにいさん Seinto Oniisan) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Hikaru Nakamura. It has been serialized by Kodansha in the monthly seinen manga magazine Morning 2 since 2007, with chapters collected in eight tankōbon volumes as of January 2013.

The eighth volume came with a DVD containing a 24 minutes OVA. This is that same OVA.

Jesus Christ and Gautama Buddha, the founders of Christianity and Buddhism, are living together as housemates in a Tokyo apartment while taking a vacation on Earth. The comedy often involves jokes about Christianity, Buddhism, and all things related, as well as the main characters' attempts to hide their identities and understand modern society in Japan. Each chapter shows how they go about or react to an average day, though they also go sightseeing or visit amusement parks.
