This is the magnum opus of Professor Carroll Quigley.

A (locked) 35-MiB pdf with readable page images is at:

The archive dot org version is edited a little, from a pro-John Birch Society, pro-conservative, pro-"Radical Right" (to use Prof. Quigley's phrase) perspective. It (currently) also includes lots of OCR errors.

The text in this archive has almost no italics indications or page numbers, none (I hope) of those edits remaining, and a lot fewer OCR errors.
