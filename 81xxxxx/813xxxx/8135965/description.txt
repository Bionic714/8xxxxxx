Some time ago on Beta RadioΓÇÖs MySpace page I saw where a person commented that the bandΓÇÖs music made her happy. Truthfully, that was probably the best, and easily most necessary review of ΓÇ£Seven SistersΓÇ¥ required. I think that statement is perfect for the simple rationale that itΓÇÖs precise and true. Sometimes simple is best. ΓÇ£Seven SistersΓÇ¥ is a superb album. It bears a quality all its own, derived from earnest singing and songwriting built upon gentle acoustic guitar, banjo playing and a smattering of other instruments that add to the albumΓÇÖs folksy, gypsy singer-songwriter feel.

If music is comfort food then Beta RadioΓÇÖs debut is what the philosophy means to extol. ΓÇ£Seven SistersΓÇ¥ envelops you, embracing by way of a country-folk, and occasionally, a church feel. Its wandering-through-the-country texture lends the songs to small town environs and family life, of love and heartache. There are songs that linger via their pleasant rhythms and MabryΓÇÖs engaging vocals. His voice is friendly, deftly mirroring peopleΓÇÖs emotions. In ΓÇ£Darden RoadΓÇ¥ Mabry sings ΓÇ£DonΓÇÖt want to clean my room/Cause I might clean my memories of youΓÇ¥ and sounds wholly genuine. He makes those sentiments real, not just as gestations or contrivances of them.

Mabry has a singular voice. He doesnΓÇÖt merely sing well, his voice is distinctive. As a singer he traverses between cool and calm to temperate and soaring, like Bono trying to be Paul Simon. On the somber ΓÇ£A Place for MeΓÇ¥ he begins with a subtle growl and when reaching the chorus stretches out in a pained timbre. The horns at the end make the song gravitate. On ΓÇ£KhimaΓÇ¥ MabryΓÇÖs vocals is a breeze crossing a front porch as Holloman steadily plays the banjo. It recalls the distant and lost quality of U2ΓÇÖs ΓÇ£Mothers of the Disappeared.ΓÇ¥ Mabry sings ΓÇ£I was wrong, I was wrongΓÇ¥ and the song sounds like territory ΓÇ£Amazing GraceΓÇ¥ once charted.

Mabry and guitarist Brent Holloman know how to write good songs, not just catchy and memorable ones. ΓÇ£Where Losers DoΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£Either WayΓÇ¥ are such obvious choices for radio singles and it doesnΓÇÖt hurt their music is overtly picturesque. Sincerity and soulfulness will carry them a long way, mirroring the presence of performers like Simon & Garfunkel, Natalie Merchant or James Taylor. ΓÇ£Seven SistersΓÇ¥ illustrate Mabry and Holloman as a great recipe, a combination of singer and musician that will likely produce more outstanding music.
