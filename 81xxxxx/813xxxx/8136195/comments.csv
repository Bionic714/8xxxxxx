""violates all laws of physics""

yet there are still those who will never give up their faith in perpetual motion and energy from nothing."

Lester Hendershot died in 1961, so it goes without saying that he does not send emails, and does not sell the schematics for his device. He wanted it to be free. It has been set free.

I did not buy this. I never buy infoproducts. Whoever is selling this left the downloadlinks in clear view in the pagesource of his site. I simply share it to save the infojunkies upwards of $120+  to get the information.

There are no violations of physics recorded in the video, nor is it a magical device. Me quoting a mail != me believing in magic. This device harnesses magnetic fields. Not ""energy from nothing"". Magnetics is real, not magic.

What the video shows is cool. What you think is moot."
,close242,2013-02-13T17:52Z,"I now noticed I forgot to put ""seemingly"" between ""does"" and ""generate"". But it should be clear from the description that it's about magnetics, not ""nothing""."

There were electronic ideas experimented with in the past, some that didn't work. But they are electronic, not paranormal.
But they are fun for electronic practice.

Lester sounds like he may be part of the James Randi foundation. Probably the most condescending, close minded faith I ever encountered."
