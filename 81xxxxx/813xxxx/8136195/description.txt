Visit hendershotgenerator.com or hendershotgenerator.eu for a video telling the story of Lester Hendershot.

This is from the promomail (read: SPAM) I received promoting it:

*****
Revealed the first energy generator thats
violates all law of physics and humiliates
top scientists even after 84 years..

Big Energy shut us down 6 months ago...
but now we`re back, and we`re here to stay.

They may not like it... and they may lose
billions because of this... but now, people
have the means to make their own electricity,
and cut the cord that ties them to the
greedy legal monopolies...

*****

Basically it's schematics and a video-tutorial explaining how to build a device (or several) that generates electricity from the magnetic fields surrounding us.

Looks interesting, but Lester wanted the information to be free, so I'm setting it free. Spam seems a terrible way of marketing such awesome information.

This torrent includes all the downloads available on the site, including the bonus and premium platinum blablabla. Some fun and interesting experiments.

Information looks legit and the video is proof of concept, it really does generate electricity from nothing. Cool.
