Charlaine Harris Harper Connelly ebooks 1-3, in pdf format: Grave Sight, Grave Surprise, An Ice Cold Grave.

These books aren't the young adult fiction of Sooky Stackhouse. Harper gets paid to find dead people and often finds more that she bargained for. Most of the dead people she finds have been murdered and there is a serial killer in one of them.

The audio books are good as they really brings Harper to life. Hope this seeds Ok.
