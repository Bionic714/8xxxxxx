,keeganzo,2013-02-13T03:54Z,Wow!! What a relief...thank you mr2wingz. Any chance you can reduce to ~100MB or so...my dl speed is 45 kbps...it's true...not lucky enough to live in the land of fast dl speeds. You're work is greatly appreciated by all the JJ fans visiting TPB. Please keep them coming...
[T],mr2wingz,2013-02-13T04:51Z,"ya I will reduce them, I was just trying to get these ones up as fast as i could for the people waiting. but I still have your situation in mind."
