Maybe not you,  I would just like to give you some info to make a decision.  scene4all,  you have posted some good stuff,  and I appreciate it all.  Im not saying this is a virus,  just passing some info and maybe I should not have said anything.  I trust you scene4all,  but ill pass on this one.  Keep up the good work,  and thanks for all I've got from you in the past! https://www.virustotal.com/file/4311a5aa0341147efeee6645f9a775d3980d9a43d0a32d05e101067ce3ee37cc/analysis/"
