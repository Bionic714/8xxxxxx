,-Surrey-,2013-02-15T22:31Z,"Active Boot Disk Suite only contains the Boot Disk Creator.

Active Data Studio contains the Boot Disk Creator plus all of LSoft's standalone apps that you can optionally install on Windows:
Active Data Burner
Active Disk Editor
Active Disk Image
Active Hard Disk Monitor 
Active File Recovery
Active Kill Disk
Active Partition Recovery
Active Password Changer

All these apps are also on the Active Boot Disk."
