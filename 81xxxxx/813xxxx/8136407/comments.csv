,mnhtapu,2013-02-13T17:02Z,"Hi, I'm using chrome 24. When I open this page a yellow banner at the top says Chrome doesn't support direct torrent download. It indeed is the case as when I click on magnetlink utorrent accepts the torrent file but can't begin the download. It just hangs on 'connecting peers' and nothing happens. Im using utorrent 3.3.
It's happening with every torrent. So anyone having similar problem? "
,mnhtapu,2013-02-13T17:05Z,Thanks. It works fine.
,mnhtapu,2013-02-13T17:08Z,"BTW that yellow banner at the top is a bullshit. Even when I opened this page with opera, it says opera doesn't support direct torrent download. So I tried again and again. And tada, Chrome, opera both works fine with magnet link. Just a crappy yellow banner,everyone ignore it."

You're welcome :)
Also, that yellow banner you're seeing is an advertisement I guess. Considering I don't see it as I use an adblocker."
