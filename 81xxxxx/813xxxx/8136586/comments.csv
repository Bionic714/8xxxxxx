[V],varuttee,2013-02-13T15:25Z,"Movies ripped from Blu Ray source is BRRip (Blu Ray Rip). Movies downloaded or viewed legally via from paid website(ie iTunes) are WEB-DL (Web Download) and when its riped again to ie 480p or 720p it called as WebRip (Web Download Rip). Well quality of Blu Ray are far better than Web-DL. But once ripped(ie BRRip or WebRip) the quality is always lower than the source.
Hard to say which will be better, at 480p and size I do, there wont be much diff in BRRip or WebRip."
