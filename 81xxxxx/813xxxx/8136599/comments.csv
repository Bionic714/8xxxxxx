,isteal2,2013-02-15T07:37Z,"Encore999 are you fucking retarded? This movie is beyond shit.. I'd rather watch paint dry... Here, let me give you some horse poo for breakfast. Dont complain, because it's free. Take it and eat it."
,xsven,2013-02-16T17:01Z,"@isteal2 Dude you need to relax. He just gave what he thinks about the movie. He did not say it was great. It's just a time waste flick. 

If your pussy hurts perhaps you should stuff it with cotton."

,chachiola,2013-03-26T08:29Z,im downloading this movie with an opened mind...
,amalpeiris,2013-05-16T15:04Z,Clean and quality upload. The movie is really Disappointing for me. Very easy to pick up that CGI is fake. A/V/M 10/10/03.
,mikedongs,2013-05-29T03:58Z,"XviD? Really? What is this, 2004? It works, but x264 is far superior... especially for lower bitrates like this.

Not that I don't appreciate the free movie, but it might be time to switch codecs."
,mikedongs,2013-05-29T04:16Z,"Alright, now that I've had a chance to see it I take back part of my last comment. The quality of this XviD encode is unacceptable, unless you're blind. I can't believe all the people saying they think the video quality is fine. It's crappy, and there is a lot of blocky artifacting. Please, start using x264!!"
