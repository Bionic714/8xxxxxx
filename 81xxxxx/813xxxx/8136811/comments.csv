,alpacino185,2013-02-19T13:03Z,Anybody care to comment on quality?
,Josh-rko,2013-02-19T23:19Z,The quality is almost perfect. A good quality though. It just has a few blurred out watermarks on the screen but they are hardly noticeable.
,Heduxz,2013-02-20T03:48Z,"The quality is much better than expected. It stays the same through the whole movie. The only thing to say is that a barely visible watermark popping on the screen for 5 seconds and then disappear, for something like every 15-20 minutes which is not a big deal. 

I'm not a big fan of DVDscr because of the quality but this torrent suprised me. If you don't want to wait until someone gets a hold on to the Bluray then this is the right torrent. 

Enjoy, and remember... This is not bluray, so do not expect that kind of quality.

M: 8/10"
