Review by Scott Yanow
Although he was very active in France during the 1950s and '60s, violinist Stephane Grappelli recorded relatively little until 1969. This Atlantic LP from 1962 finds Grappelli in good form in a quintet with guitarist Pierre Cavalli, performing a Django-dominated repertoire that is not all that different from what he would be playing 30 years later.
