Merle Haggard has a long history of singing patriotic songs but never 
has he been more powerful or politically incorrect than on the 
controversial "Me and Crippled Soldiers." This anti-flag burning song 
has been praised by President George Bush and loved by millions at his 
live concerts. Unfortunately it came out after country radio stopped 
playing singers who had passed their 40th birthdays, so it wasn't the 
hit it should have been.

Two other cuts, "Under the Bridge" and "My Home is in the Street" subtly 
support Merle's political statement. These tales of down-on-their-luck 
individuals seem to suggest that Washington DC's powers-that-be could 
have more important things to do that outrage the people who send them 
there and pay their salaries.

The rest of the CD is composed of solid Merle. Nothing else has the 
eloquence or sinew of "Me and Crippled Soldiers" but every song warrants 
a few listens.
