p.s. a MrWingz has lost his source for Judge Judy. 
Any way you awesome content providers can get Judge Judy?  
We need our schandenfraude and ole' Judith, while quick to anger, has some good brains n morals.

Judge Judy? Seriously? Hahaha. I think that wins as most amusing comment ever.

@hdreyes
Welcome. :)

@pjatgv
Welcome. :)

@Hoirc88
Ewww, you wanna fuck Judge Judy?! :O

@mibmib007
The hell did you even say...? If you want MP4, just change the file extension to MP4. Different cable providers use different settings.

,Knan4051,2013-02-16T01:54Z,Thanks Sec. For some reason KYR has chosen to use 23 FPS for all rips of this show. Not that theirs looked any better to begin with :P
,extracube,2013-03-09T19:44Z,Just finished watching this one.  For small file size the show was nearly perfect.  Thanks.
