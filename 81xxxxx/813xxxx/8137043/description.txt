After 12 records and over 40 years, bluesman Chris Smither is really backing himself on Hundred Dollar Valentine, each of its 11 songs penned by the man himself for the very first time; perhaps this is why itΓÇÖs such a confident, casual, strong piece of work. SmitherΓÇÖs talent as a fingerstyle guitarist has always been impressive, but it seems that with age heΓÇÖs developing a richer, hearty vocal tone that adds an extra depth. The sparse percussion of ex-Morphine drummer Billy Conway is the albumΓÇÖs unsung hero, so unobtrusive but vital in the way it pushes the tunes forward. Producer David Goodrich has crammed quite a lot into Hundred Dollar Valentine while still making it sound utterly intimate, which is no mean feat.

The guitar that powers What They Say might seem a little too close to SmitherΓÇÖs 2006 tune Leave The Light On, but the rest of the song ΓÇô all perky vocals, howling harp and down home fiddle ΓÇô ensures itΓÇÖs one of the albumΓÇÖs best cuts. All We Need To Know is bleak and ominous, while Make Room For Me that follows might have a similarly dark subject matter but comes across more carefree; you can just see SmitherΓÇÖs wry smile as he speaks of the world destructing and the human race being consigned to cages.

Smither is highly adept at acoustic blues with subject matter that doesnΓÇÖt follow any tropes of the genre; thereΓÇÖs always a little grit and a little cheek. On Hundred Dollar Valentine heΓÇÖs only being his own sardonic, humourous self and itΓÇÖs a damn good fit.
