Broadway production of Mormon the Musical on March 1st, 2011.  Originally captured by a handheld standard definition video camera.  It was then mistakenly encoded as a widescreen 16:9 video within a standard 4:3 screen image (black bars above and below) reducing the original resolution before the very first upload.  This is that same version previously uploaded, only I deshook the video with an image stabilizer, cropped out the black space, releveled the contrast to accommodate the harsh stage lights and attempted to upscaled the resolution to match a standard definition television video.  It's just as funny but doesn't make you dizzy nor hurt your eyes anymore.
