These and your others are much appreciated!"
,sykoskit,2013-02-13T07:42Z,"plus everyone else is posting s02e28, which they already posted last week... you're the only one who posted new episodes, so i'm getting them from you. the only thing, you label them wrong... it's not e39+e40, it's actually e29+e30... just thought you should know... i appreciate the upload tho, at least you can post the new episodes, even if you label it wrong lol :P"
,lexnitro6,2013-02-13T07:44Z,THANK YOU!
[V],psspss,2013-02-13T08:20Z,"theses are new episodes ive not seen them before and titles match too.. so just go by titles
then youre always correct even if the ep numbers change later

tvrage lists them 40-41 but I think they are one missing or didnt air
others listing them as 28-29-30 is cos they add 10 of season 2 in season 1 listings. which is how ane tv website still lists them"
,sykoskit,2013-02-13T08:36Z,"i think i get what you're trying to say, even though it didn't make much sense the way you said it... either way, idc much about the labels, this is the only one that uploaded the correct episodes, at least so far tonight lol"
,sykoskit,2013-02-13T08:37Z,so i thank you :)
,sykoskit,2013-02-13T08:39Z,"my comcast guide lists them as episodes 29 and 30, and i have only 30 episodes downloaded for this season... i'm not sure what you have as your first 10 episodes. i haven't downloaded from you until today, because you are the only one who could upload the correct episodes. usually i download from tvteam"
[V],psspss,2013-02-13T08:51Z,:U
[V],psspss,2013-02-13T08:53Z,"on the site that streams it and makes the show.. in season 1 folder it has 6 episodes.. the rest are listed in season 2 is what im saying so Im going by their own website

seems though they cant even hire people to keep their own sites correct. if thats the case

I wouldnt be surprised if they meant to be season 3 now either"
,sykoskit,2013-02-13T09:09Z,"ohh i got what ur saying.. lol they are pretty stupid. there is 16 episodes in season 1. they should hire me lol... i could do a better job than whoever they have working for them now. rofl... anyway, i've always seen your posts and saw the numbers and didn't download cause i wasn't sure, but since you were the only person who uploaded the correct episodes i had to check, and seems i should i have been downloading from you all along. getting them both in 1 torrent is far better than the 2 separate ones i used to get.. but i recognize your name so i think i must download something else you post. i just can't remember what it is lol"
,sykoskit,2013-02-13T09:11Z,ohh i just clicked on ur name and saw it... bering sea gold. i knew i recognized you lol... ur awesome you upload great shows :D
[V],psspss,2013-02-13T09:52Z,"they are still listing 6 episodes for season 1 until
their site relists or fixes it.. I wont be changing the naming again
http://www.aetv.com/storage-wars-texas/episode-guide/season-1/

however it normal for a pilot season to have only 6 episodes in it

the site sucks badly so slow loading and messy flash everywhere.. makes a mess of listing it on webpage
you go into guides you dont expect it to start playing an episode.. you want to see the listings and descriptions!"
,sykoskit,2013-02-13T10:11Z,"wow that's horrible... i'm glad i don't have to go to the site :P and yeah i wouldn't expect you to change... i can deal with the numbers now that i know it's still the episodes i need, i'm going to be downloading and seeding only urs from now on. anyway, thanks man... i appreciate ur work :)"
[V],psspss,2013-02-13T10:43Z,"you do know you can rss feed me here and at kat?

if you click on my username you see all my torrents as well.. saves having to search and miss something"
,miamisunset,2013-02-13T15:55Z,"According to the Futon Critic:
http://thefutoncritic.com/showatch/storage-wars-texas/listings/

These are actually episodes 15 and 31 of season 2. The Futon Critic lists production numbers and it's clear that A&E is running these shows out of order which makes for confusion. Epguides shows these as 39 & 40 but they don't have any indication as to how they determine season. They seem to be working with TVRage.com, which claims to be using A&E's listings, but A&E doesn't show any episode numbers, just the episode titles. 

So if you're going by production, there's 16 episodes in season 1. If you're going by airings, there's only 6.  So between episodes airing out of order and some of the first season episodes being held back, it makes episode numbers nearly useless. Giving episode title does help one to determine exactly which episode it is."
,storm2012,2013-02-14T00:59Z,"Who gives a fuck how they are numbered, just happy that someone is doing this for all to see.
& 2 eps in the one file.
Thanks psspss for your time & effrot"
[V],psspss,2013-02-14T02:05Z,"episodes should be by air times.. hence why I add the dates.. 

productions numbers are all over the place.. I dont see how they can be too much out of order though as the conflicts wouldnt match up well.. from week to week.


so it seems how Im numbering them for air-dates and seasons is correct then"
