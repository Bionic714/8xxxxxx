Description:

Crazy but true: One of the most popular photo editors just got even better. BeFunky Photo Editor Pro is now the only app that allows you to stack an UNLIMITED number of photo effects and edits, AND undo them! And even though YOU control the amount of each edit you make and YOU control how many are added, itΓÇÖs still one of the easiest photo editors out there to use.

BeFunky Photo Editor Pro already gives you effects that arenΓÇÖt offered anywhere else along with all your favorites. With this new version weΓÇÖve added new effects that will blow your mind, some more of the most popular ones, and powerful new editing tools.

No registration is required to use BeFunky Photo Editor, and there are NO ADS, no watermarks, no limitations, and no forcing to share. BeFunky Photo Editor was made with you in mind, so it's exactly the way you want it to be.

What's in this version:
- This is a major User Interface and features update

- New powerful editing tools: Crop, straighten, rotate, sharpen, and add vignetting to any photo. Try our new features beautify and fill light, and make temperature adjustments. And as always: tools for exposure, hue, saturation, etc., are included.
