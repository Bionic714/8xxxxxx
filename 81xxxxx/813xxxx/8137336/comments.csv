This is for those people who install on family and friends computers and don't want them going ""WTF? Thepiratebay???"""
[V],murphy78,2013-02-13T07:48Z,"ahh... forgot to change the recommendation part of my description to reflect x86 when I copied it over and modified it from my x64 description.  I wish I could edit the description, but I cannot; TPB doesn't allow it."
[V],murphy78,2013-02-15T02:50Z,"You guys can use the new MS toolkit and uninstall the kmsnano if you want. It's much faster and the autokms file that it uses for the task is only like a couple megs. It isn't quite as refined as the kmsnano, but some people report problems with kmsnano's qemu virtual machine. ms toolkit 2.4 and later use just straight emulation without any machine.

Plus it's easier to add the autokms.exe on an a/v list for future hacktool stuff since kmsnano extracts files and runs them. You kinda have to catch the a/v warnings as they happen with the particular kmsnano version I used.

This stuff is optional. KMSnano will work just fine if you don't install any interfering kb files or a/v updates."

,magzagg,2013-02-23T13:00Z,installed and running....in properties it says windows  is activated. but the thing is it says the license to use windows expires on 22/08/2013. which is only 6 months from now. Shouldn't it be for lifetime?
