KMSNano.exe

Changes from recent Windows 8 x64 releases:
-Complete updating done online with audit mode and sysprep
-DirectX web runtime ran to ensure latest directx files
-NetFx2-3.5.1 added and patched to latest
-Unmodified ei.cfg for extra stability long-term
-Obviously the KMS Pre-Activation stuff

People often ask in the comments which version of windows 8 I
would recommend for them. Well, folks, for x64 people, this is
the one I would recommend. Pro VL has the least likely chance
of developing activation problems since the only offline method
we have come up with for bypassing security is KMS. Enterprise
has Windows 8 To Go and Hyper-V but most people don't use that.

If a future problem arises and a newer activation method is
needed, you can run the Uninstall-KMSnano.cmd in the folder:
windows_setup_kmsnano This will delete the scheduled task and
remove the kmsnano files.

I'm not sure if smartscreen filter will bother with scheduled
tasks and scripted tasks, but if it does, turn it off in
action center in the control panel - system and security
Allow any related programs through any firewall programs
and A/V updates. (False positive in future for activator)
