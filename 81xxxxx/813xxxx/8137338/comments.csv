[V],murphy78,2013-02-13T07:45Z,"I forgot to mention in the description... I moved my normal Info folder from c:_Info to windows_setup_Info.

This is for those people who install on family and friends computers and don't want them going ""WTF? Thepiratebay???"""
,osxp,2013-02-13T08:11Z,"well...............I'm sure it is still Tuesday somewhere (may the east coast or Fiji :)
keep up the good work."
[V],murphy78,2013-02-13T09:40Z,"yah... sysprep method takes a lot longer to do than dism, but there's just some updates that you can't seem to do offline. You can use a dxredist for june2010 stuff, but that still leaves quite a few dx updates, plus it slows down install.

You can also probably copy some defender description files if you are really awesome with that stuff, but that's iffy at best.

Then there's a few online only hotfixes... those also slow down installs.

So, audit / sysprep has definite advantages for the end-result but it does take quite a bit longer to get into a workable dvd, esp with all the added activation stuff; if yer not used to it.

I had a problem making a folder in program files, but didn't realize I wasn't using quotes, so it kept making c:_Program...

Every little bit slows down my flagship things until I'm perfectly satisfied.  Anyhow, I never said it was Tuesday in my release, though it still was - here in Cali :P"
,Val777,2013-02-13T11:01Z,Win 8 sucks.
,osxp,2013-02-13T11:14Z,sure it's gonna be perfect like always. Thanks
[V],murphy78,2013-02-13T12:16Z,"lol val... it's not that bad when you get past the activation stuff and the crappy default setup options... If you set it up correctly, it's actually pretty pleasant to use."
,cowpizza7,2013-02-13T14:48Z,Can I do a in place upgrade and keep all my files or must I clean install?
,Sonic_27,2013-02-13T16:18Z,"Thank you so much, been waiting for this! Will seed for awhile. Can't get no better Windows 8 then this, AGAIN THANKS FOR ALL YOUR HARD WORK AND TIME!!"
,alvester,2013-02-13T16:38Z,"Read this Murphy....

,bl_rabbit,2013-02-13T17:48Z,"wooww...u was uploaded the beast again murphy
great job!

yeahh..I read it @alvester...some bugs again -_-"
[V],murphy78,2013-02-13T20:31Z,"Yah, that's kind-of why I keep making these things updated with the latest updates. Going naked these days is like just asking for problems..."
[V],murphy78,2013-02-13T20:35Z,"@cowpizza, I'm not entirely sure. I never do an upgrade, though I didn't do anything that would prevent one.  I *think* it will rename your old windows folder to windows.old and leave everything else where it is.  They really have done a phenomenal job software-wise on just about everything they've done, I would expect that you should be able to use most of your old software just fine.

I would backup any important stuff like tax info or family pictures, just in case. You can never be too careful."
,Rain45,2013-02-13T22:00Z,Can't wait to try this out. All this good news. Lets get some more seeders out there!
[V],murphy78,2013-02-14T02:20Z,"YW guys, please be patient with the downloading. I know it takes a while when you really want to download it. Just remember that this is the only place I release these files, so you're the first people to get them on the planet."
,Rain45,2013-02-14T02:39Z,"Thanks Murphy, install like a dream and activation a  sinch. BTW just a heads up this exact same torrent from a different upload is on KAT. "
[V],murphy78,2013-02-14T04:25Z,"as long as people don't claim it's their own work, they're free to re-up wherever they feel like."
,Reed26,2013-02-14T14:27Z,"Is it really permanently activated, murphy? sorry, low bandwidth so I can't recklessly download huge files like this."
[V],murphy78,2013-02-14T17:36Z,"no, but it's permanently re-activated; as long as you let it through any a/v program updates"
[V],murphy78,2013-02-15T02:50Z,"You guys can use the new MS toolkit and uninstall the kmsnano if you want. It's much faster and the autokms file that it uses for the task is only like a couple megs. It isn't quite as refined as the kmsnano, but some people report problems with kmsnano's qemu virtual machine. ms toolkit 2.4 and later use just straight emulation without any machine.

Plus it's easier to add the autokms.exe on an a/v list for future hacktool stuff since kmsnano extracts files and runs them. You kinda have to catch the a/v warnings as they happen with the particular kmsnano version I used.

This stuff is optional. KMSnano will work just fine if you don't install any interfering kb files or a/v updates."
,calou85,2013-02-15T03:08Z,hi Murphy78. it seems to be working great but it says the activation will expire on August..will i need to buy anything after that date???   thanks for the great service 
[V],murphy78,2013-02-15T03:50Z,no calou... kms activation lasts 180 days at a time. It will re-activate when 30 days or less are left on the activation.
,calou85,2013-02-15T04:04Z,thanks for your prompt response.
,Hijeputz1,2013-02-16T16:11Z,Hey men can I use this version of Windows to run into my Parallel Desktop 7 for my MacBook Pro?

,idrew2013,2013-03-01T16:59Z,Just wanted to give a big thank you for this torrent! I have tried a bunch of the other Windows 8 torrents and this is the only one that is causing my computer to crash constantly.
,alvester,2013-03-02T12:42Z,"Hi there Murphy. I wanted to install this release in UEFI mode. So I changed my boot mode from Legacy to UEFI in BIOS. But it didn't boot from USB. I did a little bit of research and found that you need to boot from FAT32 formatted USB while Windows 7 USB Tool formats it NTFS. Since FAT32 supports file less than 4GB and this release consists of a file more than 4GB, I ended up formatting my USB Drive with exFAT format and it still boot from it. Can you please help me with this. Awaiting response. Thanks."
