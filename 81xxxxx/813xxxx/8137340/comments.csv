Thanks for comment phase700b"

[V],HighCode,2013-02-14T09:27Z,"Argo 720p  http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8102527/Argo_2012_BDRip_720p_DTS_multisub_HighCode
is perfect, a 1080p encode won't look any better unless with projector on a huge screen. I won't upload it again in 1080p, for me this 720p is perfect. "
,phase700b,2013-02-14T15:50Z,Another reason not to bother with 1080p of Argo is it's 1970's look and film grain. It sort of looks old. Certainly no eye popping visuals. I had a huge 1080p copy of Argo and immediately saw it was unnecessary. I got rid of it in favor of a 720p copy. 720p really is plenty good enough for Argo. Just my opinion.
