[V],promodsharma,2013-02-14T14:50Z,"@'temporary2010' - Thanks for pointing out the source, but I still appreciate the effort of 'Anonymous' for the trouble of downloading the software, Making a Torrent , uploading it and patiently seeding it for sharing with the TPB community.

Also, the uploader has brought to notice of the TPB community a software which many may not have known about, had it not been for this torrent.

Therefore, please contribute similarly or keep your trap shut."
