,Tstart,2013-03-12T01:32Z,"yes 500kbps video is not even enough for iOS :/

I hope you have them in better quality as well! :)"

Maybe someone will come out with a rip (if they're even available on DVD yet), or maybe someone with decent recording gear has recorded an HD copy, but if they are, they haven't been forthcoming.  These are the files directly captured from the streaming service our local tv station provides.  I wish they streamed in higher quality too.  But I thought, anything is better than nothing.  And my larval stages certainly don't seem to mind ;-)"
