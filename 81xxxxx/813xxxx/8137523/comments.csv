,beechyboy,2013-02-13T18:00Z,"Thanks for the upload. 

It's  funny how you could find stupid shows about bacon ? yet you can't find decent shows like American pickers!"
[V],psspss,2013-02-14T01:58Z,"lost me? what bacon

and as I said already I not doing all shows anymore cos of data limits.. 
I really started out doing paranormal and UFO stuff

since i have watch the am pickers or canada one I havent gotten around to watching it or seeing if like it so havent followed it"
[V],psspss,2013-02-14T02:00Z,"well I watched maybe 2 of am pickers 

oh you mean bigfoot.. bacon and bobo

well thats comes under ufos and paranormal and mysteries liek i always do and plus its funny as hell 

I dont really like diggers guys either.. they piss me of.. I liek the big ex wrestler better and he seems ot make big cash each time :)"
,beechyboy,2013-02-15T03:16Z,No... the stupid show called The United States of bacon http://www.google.com/search?q=United%20States%20of%20bacon%20tvrage
[V],psspss,2013-02-16T03:43Z,"i dont understand your initial comment then,..


I never shared that show... lol and wouldnt bother 
however gordon ramsey is often entertaining and do him sometimes and the old ball weird food show like secret recipes.. to see if someone cracks kfc for sure.. but none have"
[V],psspss,2013-02-16T03:47Z,"oh i get you now.. your saying its funny how stupid shows are easy to find but the better ones no fooker caps it and shares it

whats worse is scene relay mules are so darn lame with their times to release stuff and have to wait ages for hdtv rips for gold rush and other popular shows LOL

instead we happy someone in usa rips a rabbit ears shows so can get to see it which is like VHS tapes again.. well most of us do anyhow.. theres always the teenies moan if its not 720p quality LOL"
,miamisunset,2013-02-16T19:54Z,"I think there's one or two episodes missing from the uploads. According to TruTV's site:

Stormy Waters
Aired: 2013-01-06

Men At War
Aired: 2013-01-06

www.trutv.com/trutv2go/index.html#!/240320

The episodes are available online for those who subscribe to the channel but are inaccessible by anyone else. I cannot access them.

They don't have the one for 2013-01-13, which corresponds with your S03E01 and FutonCritic's Ep 215.

The next episodes they list are
Truth or Dare
Aired 2013-01-20
(Which would probably correspond with your S03E02)

Torching the Competition
Aired 2013-01-27 (Your E03)

Fuel to the Fire
Aired 2013-02-10 (This one)
"
[V],psspss,2013-02-18T02:24Z,"whay back in E01 of this season I said I suspect 2 episodes missing and really Ep1 is Ep3
