Art Taylor - A.T.'s Delight

Since his days with the Bud Powell Trio, drummer Art Taylor was an invaluable member of the Blue Note recording family. A.T.'s Delight is the only album made under his own name for the label and it is a remarkable one. Choosing great compositions by Coltrane, Monk, Denzil Best and Kenny Dorham, Taylor assembled a great quintet fronted by Dave Burns and Stanley Turrentine, often adding Potato's congas to the proceedings. The unique and varied arrangements and great playing pay tribute to the drummer's exceptional song selection.
