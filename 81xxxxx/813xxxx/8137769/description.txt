Daniel celebrates Valentine's Day with viewers' rants about their love lives. Also: a Web Redemption for a man who clocked his running speed at 37 miles per hour.


This is a webrip... don't expect great quality! Video is stretched a little, but sound is good... definitely watch-able :) 

Enjoy!
