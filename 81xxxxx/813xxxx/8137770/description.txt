Uploading songs to your Google Music library on an individual basis can be a serious drag, as well as a complete time-waster. Much like the 8tracks Uploader for Macs, Music Manager lets users easily and quickly transfer songs to their Google Music Library in no time at all.

You can tweak the settings on Music Manager to automatically upload new music it detects from iTunes, Windows Media Player, or other storage media.

In addition to uploading songs, the program also provides a list of songs it was unable to upload, as well as a reason as to why the upload didn't work. Unfortunately, if you do encounter an error in uploading, Music Manager doesn't actually suggest a solution. You might just be out of luck, which could be frustrating.

If you want an easy-to-use method of uploading songs to your Google Music library, Music Manager is the way to go.
