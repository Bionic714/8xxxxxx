Transporter The Series S01E07 - Give the Guy a Hand (Canadian broadcast)

While waiting for a delivery in Toronto, Frank has a variety of strange encounters and then winds up in jail. 

This episode (as broadcast in Canada) has not been released yet by the scene as far as I know. It was aired on Feb 8, 2013 on HBO HD Canada. Like all of my releases to date, the source is an analog rip, so the quality is, at best, something like A8 V8.
