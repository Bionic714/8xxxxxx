Reverend Carver:

"... tonight I thought it would be appropriate to talk about a guy who _really_ 
trusted himself: Saint Valentinus, better known as Saint Valentine. 

"Saint Valentine was a Roman priest in the third century. At that time, the 
Roman Emperor, Claudius II, didn't want any of his young men to get married or 
have children, because he thought it would hurt their ability to become good 
soldiers. 

"Well, Saint Valentine defied Claudius II's law and performed secret marriages 
to young couples in love. In time, he was caught, jailed, and put to death. 
But before he died, Valentine himself met a woman and fell in love, with the 
jailer's daughter. He sent her notes, which he signed, 'From your Valentine' -- 
the legend which, of course, lives on today.

"So why should we listen to Emerson and trust ourselves? Maybe trusting ourselves 
is the only way what's meant to be, can be. And when that happens, if you're 
Saint Valentine, you end up being the embodiment of romantic love for centuries 
to come."
