,trogdori4e,2013-02-25T04:55Z,The audio skips quite often on this
,trogdori4e,2013-02-27T02:44Z,"actually maybe its ok.  For some reason this is the only one for me that had audio skips on my smart tv, but I re-coded it to be a smaller size and use AC3 audio and everything is fine."

,JMit,2013-03-25T02:37Z,@trogdori4e How did you do it? I've tried many tools but ac3 track always gets out of sync. I think there's a gap somewhere on DTS track.
,JMit,2013-03-25T09:37Z,"Nevermind, my file was corrupted."
