Sorry for the last one, seemed to be something wrong during the cracking. But this one do work! 


"Plan a wedding. Save for retirement. Track your workouts. Keep a baby journal. Anyone can be good with numbers.

Numbers ΓÇÖ09 can help you plan and dream, and great-looking Apple-designed templates will help you get started. Tables are already made. Formulas have been figured out. Fonts are in place. It's all ready to go. Just choose one of the 30 templates to use for home, work, and school and make it your own. If youΓÇÖre starting with a blank sheet, thatΓÇÖs easy, too. Spreadsheets are built on a flexible, free-form canvas. So you can move tables, charts, graphics, and text anywhere you want on the page. Effortlessly create formulas using an intuitive browser with more than 250 functions. Add interactive controls such as sliders, steppers, and checkboxes that let you play ΓÇ£what ifΓÇ¥ in real time. Scale your document with a drag of the mouse or trackpad to create the perfect printout using the interactive print view. You can even add photos, movies, and music to your spreadsheet with just a few clicks.

Everything you create in Numbers looks stunning on the MacBook Pro with Retina Display. And with iCloud built right in on OS X Mountain Lion, the spreadsheets you create are kept up to date across all your devices.
