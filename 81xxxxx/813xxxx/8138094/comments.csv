,Machine4578,2013-02-13T20:53Z,yep this method works 100%.. credit also goes to the cs.rin.ru community. and expecially LyuboA and myself too!!!
,carbupito,2013-02-14T10:30Z,"works fine,thank you Ghosnet"
,ASIMINICD,2013-02-14T13:57Z,thx/thx.works
,arinaka,2013-02-15T01:51Z,"Works perfectly, instructions are very easy to follow except for the most computer illiterate of us.

Way to go!"
,AlexMercer94,2013-02-15T16:30Z,"i swear im gonna cry...i lost my save...but i followed the instructions perfectly....
hellllpppp :'(((((((("
,Machine4578,2013-02-15T18:52Z,"@AlexMercer94

if you followed the instructions to keep your saves you would have them!!!
so put back the org uplay_r1_loader.dll from the v1.04 RLD crack and decrypt your saves first!!"
,kiason,2013-03-06T08:53Z,do you have to have the digitul delux for this to work or will it workwith any copy?
,hippo2432,2013-03-07T07:47Z,yeah does the dlc come with the normal copy or just the deluxe version?
,morbidmurderer,2013-03-08T01:31Z,"I can not get this to work. I follow the steps properly as far as I know for method 2. When I get to step 5 it only lets me start a new game. Maybe I'm not doing step 3 right. I type in all that jiberish ( aT2O6Z6+kzoImbx8lt9csmZNfJ5UQgOXlskAsmv5zTE= ) in between the exclamation marks. Is that what I'm supposed to do? I can always put the uplay_r1_loader.dll  back from the 1.04 update and my saves are back but I'd really like to get the DLC unlocked. Thanks, anyone that can help."
,morbidmurderer,2013-03-12T03:13Z,"UPDATE: I got it to work with method 2: My video settings have  been set for direct x 11, so I picked the .dll file for direct x 11 to patch. It never worked. When I picked the .dll for direct x 9 it worked."
,emosushi,2013-03-15T00:16Z,"I opened an account just to leave a comment on this torrent. It works perfectly and even kept my old save game. I used method 2. However, I encountered problems at first. The guy above me gave me an idea, so I performed method 2 for BOTH FC3.dll AND FC3_d3d11.dll. I don't know which one got it to work, but doing it on both got me around the bump. No I am playing the DLC on my old save game. THanks!!"
,ashishrane,2013-03-29T07:15Z,Thanks from the bottom of my heart. Works flawlessly as desired. You really deserve kudos.:)
