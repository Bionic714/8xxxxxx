Here's what Rank Tracker can do for you: 

- Automatically checks your search engine rankings : No more spending hours on end manually checking your site's positions in search engines. Just sit back and let Rank Tracker do the boring job for you!
- Shows if your site moved up or down in search results : Every time you check your rankings, Rank Tracker will conveniently show you the ranking difference so you can easily see if your site has moved up, or if it has slipped for whatever reason.
- Helps you discover profitable keywords you've been missing out on! : Check this out: Rank Tracker includes a powerful "Suggest Keywords" feature. With it, you'll be able to grab traffic-generating keywords using Wordtracker, Google Suggest, your competitor's websites, and many other methods! (Rank Tracker comes with a total of 16 different keyword suggestion tools - with many more on our TODO list!) This feature alone is so powerful, there are entire products that cost upwards of $100 that offer just this single feature!
- Supports 342 different search engines : Rank Tracker supports 342 international and local search engines so you can track your rankings using the engine that matters most to you. The currently supported SEs include Google, Yahoo! and Bing with their localized versions plus hundreds of others.
- Shows you the BEST keywords to optimize your site for! : Rank Tracker can show you how many times a keyword has been actually searched by real people over the last month, plus how stiff the competition for this keyword is. This "number-of-searches-to-competition" ratio is known as Keyword Efficiency Index, or KEI. This is how professional search engine optimizers pick the best keywords to optimize for - they choose keywords with the biggest number of searches AND the lowest competition. Go ahead, use the KEI feature to find out which keywords are worth it! And Rank Tracker can do all this automatically, without a single mouseclick done by you!
