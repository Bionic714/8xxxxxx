NOTES

- Read "ExtrasChangelog.txt" to see what's new!

- This Update requires v1.0.10246.0 (REV Release) to be installed.

- This Update doesn't require a crack.

- Tested on the HI2U Release, offline (bots) and online* working. The
PROPHET Release will probably work too.

- This is a BETA and there may still be bugs and issues. This patch does
not yet contain all of the planned fixes and features from Content
Update 1, and maps and new modes are not yet completely polished.
However you are still able to enjoy these new maps, weapons, modes,
anti-cheat and other improvements!

- The reason I did not release the full Content Update 1, is because
new protection has been added. I couldn't manage to crack this
protection. So, if you're reading this and you have the skills to
crack this protection (is Steam, I believe), please contact me via
royalgamer06 [at] gmail.com! I have the full Content Update 1 Files
ready.
