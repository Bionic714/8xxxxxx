and everyone else..
these DLC's are useless unless you have the unlocker file(made by Brucie which only unlocks 4/5 DLC) and the LAN fix.. because these DLC's are for MP only using LAN!!!! so people are downloading 4GB of useless files as of now!!!

I wished i had seen GhOstNet comment that this is for only multiplayer play and i like only singleplayer.
My mistake sorry again."
