Edinburgh to Glasgow route updated for Train Simulator 2013 and Class 66 V2.0

The Edinburgh-Glasgow Expansion Pack is a recreation of the line from Edinburgh Waverley to Glasgow Queen Street via Falkirk High, and including the Grangemouth Intermodal terminal and refinery area.

The Edinburgh-Glasgow Expansion Pack has been developed by Thomson Interactive with a focus on the ΓÇÿdriverΓÇÖs eyeΓÇÖ view, all station and line-side features being fully detailed and more distant landscape features represented with simpler detail to improve game rendering performance while driving.
