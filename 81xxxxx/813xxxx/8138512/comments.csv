,paul_kj,2013-03-08T06:45Z,"Hey guys, this file was not working for me too at first, so what needs to be done is you need to update your game from version 25.1 to v27.5a
 which is available on rutracker via torrent, its a 1.5 gb file, and once thats installed you can install this rwp file through the utilities app, mind you it will be in Russian, and it will work then, wish the uploader had doled out this simple advice upfront, I figured this out the hard way, and I thank the uploader for uploading these wonderful addons which we all enjoy, there's no way I can afford any of this dlc, so thanks uploader!! go strong!!"
