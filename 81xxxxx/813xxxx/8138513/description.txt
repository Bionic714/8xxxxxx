Information
------------------------------

Venture to the ocean deep with Titanic director James Cameron and the Discovery Channel. The mighty Bismarck was the Second World War's most feared and infamous battleship. For more than sixty years, it has rested at the bottom of the North Sea.
Three miles under the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, director James Cameron utilizes the expertise of historians, survivors, and an undersea team to explore the wreck of the DKM Bismarck, a mighty German ship which managed to bury the British fleet's finest underwater with one blow during World War II. A feat so rage-inducing, the Bismarck's dismantling punishment was immediately ordered by Prime Minister Winston Churchill, but its ultimate disapparance was never fully qualified as either a successful sinking by the British or a scuttling by the Bismarck's very own crew. Decades later, the mystery of its sinking is reexamined, the circumstances enlightened with the help of startling undersea cinematography, animated segments, and detailed reenactments of the players and events involved. Each element combined attempts to piece together the lost moments of history for this legendary sea vessel.
