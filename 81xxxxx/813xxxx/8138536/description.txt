Young Blue Eyes is not a compilation of RCA studio recordings, but rather a collection of radio broadcasts from the same time period that up to this point have been unissued. While the studio recordings are more famous, some may find these 1940-42 broadcasts more compelling. Although thereΓÇÖs a fair amount of crackle present from the original acetates, thereΓÇÖs also a bit of crackle in the band as well, who seem invigorated by the live setting and provide the music with a little more punch than there was in the studio.
