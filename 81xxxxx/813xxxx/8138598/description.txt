This is the second part of a 3 or 4 episode arc in which Riley and Gillis 
are offered new jobs working for the same aircraft manufacturer in a new plant 
elsewhere in California.  That happened in the previous episode that I
don't have. It's known as "The New Job".  The neighbors sold their houses
at Blue View Terrace in Los Angeles. This show has the both the Riley and 
Gillis families house hunting, and eventually moving to another part of L.A., 
to settle in a 2-floor duplex in an area called Del Mar Vista.

No sign of Babs Riley? Well, her character was going to college by this time.
