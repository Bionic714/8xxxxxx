,LavaWave,2013-02-15T15:42Z,"About the note in the description, I've updated Construct 2 from r114 to the current version r119 and it seems to work perfectly, does Construct 2 even have a drm? seems it's safe to update without even needing a crack :/"
,jimmyshabadoo,2013-02-22T20:52Z,License goes dead and reverts to free version as of r120
,LavaWave,2013-02-23T08:32Z,"The last public version is r119 as of yet, that's just a beta snapshot as of yet, try waiting for the official public r120 maybe it would work :/ if not then that's too bad."
,mohoULTIMATE,2013-03-19T20:57Z,"Wow, nice, its working with that Hernandez guy license. (Personal License), cool. But I have one question. It is possible that license will work in newest verision of Construct 2 (R119)? Thank for reply :)"
,CaptainKD,2013-03-22T14:38Z,"@mohoULTIMATE:
Yes, it works on r119."
,zistoire,2013-04-15T11:43Z,thanks man I hope that when i will update it  it will work as well as it work now
,LavaWave,2013-04-20T19:48Z,"It doesn't work with R126.

Looks like they changed something since the last versions, R119 is the last version this C2license will work with."
,LavaWave,2013-05-05T12:43Z,Uploaded the last stable version that the hacked license file will work with.
,xist646,2013-05-12T04:25Z,"If I use this or the R119 torrent to try out the software, will my save (capx) be able to transfer over to the latest builds if I buy a license?"
