[V],MVGroup,2013-02-13T15:47Z,"2)  Glue 
In a bid to find out all there is to know about glue, Richard and Jonny recreate the classic 'flying man' wallpaper paste TV ad by gluing Jonny to a board and dangling him from a crane above a pool of water. Find out how chairs are tested by robotic artificial human bottoms that each clock up 3.5 million 'sit downs' a month. Then Jonny slices open a plasma TV to see what's inside, while Richard looks at the technology of modern bank notes and the bacteria they harbor. Finally, ever wondered how the writing gets into seaside rock? We show you how.

3)  Batteries 
Richard and Jonny find out all there is to know about batteries - from standard batteries to those powered by seawater, fruit and even...urine. Then they hit the racetrack to witness a world record land-speed attempt by a battery-powered milk float. Will it beat the current record of 73.39mph? Did you know that Nazi scientists created and marketed radioactive toothpaste? Or that it's possible to make your own toothpaste? Richard experiments. Finally, Jonny slices open a cricket ball and we go behind-the-scenes at a tea manufacturer where each minute 2000 teabags are made.

4)  Glass 
Can high pitched singing really shatter glass? Our duo enlists the help of an opera singer before heading to a firing range to test the true resistance of bullet-proof glass. Also, find out about Bumper Harris, the one-legged man employed to travel on escalators in Edwardian London to demonstrate ease of usage. In 'Testing Testing' meet Sid the mannequin who is blasted daily with 1,000Â°C flames to test fireproof clothing. Then Jonny takes an angle grinder to a snooker ball to see what's inside and we go behind the scenes at a soap factory.

5)  Roads 
Did you know that just 1km of three-lane motorway costs Â£13 million to build? But what are our roads made of and what makes them so strong? Our intrepid pair tests the durability of asphalt using a flame thrower, a high pressure water jet and finally, some petrol. Afterwards, we get walking at a boot factory where remote-controlled mechanical feet test water-proof capabilities and a real human endures temperatures of -40Â°C, all in the name of testing. Then Richard delves into the history of the telephone while Jonny takes his angle grinder to a catalytic converter to see what's inside.

6)  Magnets 
Did you know that brakes on some vertical-drop fairground rides operate purely through electromagnetic induction? Richard and Jonny head to the fair to investigate, before visiting a scrapyard to demonstrate the incredible weight-lifting capabilities of a magnet powered by just four torch batteries. The guys then check out the magnetic suspension on a Ferrari and look at the future use of magnets in engine-free high speed, floating trains. But that's not all, Richard finds out all there is to know about diamonds while Jonny tackles a gearbox with his angle grinder. Finally, we visit a chip manufacturer famous for creating the Cheese and Onion flavoured chip.

7)  Paint 
Richard and Jonny turn graffiti artists to test the properties of anti-graffiti paint. Then it's off to the Humber Bridge for a spot of painting - little do they know it takes three years to paint the railings alone. Then it's off to meet Keith, the man whose job it is to watch paint dry...literally! While Richard finds out all there is to know about a 1950s invention - car airbags, Jonny cuts open a pair of trainers. Then it's off to a domestic fire alarm testing center to see how chip pan fires, petrol arson attacks and sofa fires are simulated to save lives. Finally, we head to an acoustic guitar workshop to see how nine different types of wood become a musical instrument.

8)  Steel 
Steel is one of the few manmade materials that is 100% recyclable - not only could your household cutlery be made of an old Victorian bridge or an old battleship, but after 9-11, NYC authorities dispatched thousands of tons of the wreckage around the world for recycling. Steel shipping containers can also be turned into surprisingly spacious and appealing housing as Jonny "
