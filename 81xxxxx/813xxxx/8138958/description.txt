I Didn't Know That
Industrial scientists Richard Ambrose and Jonny Phillips find extraordinary facts behind ordinary everyday objects. I Didn't Know That, an action-packed series exposes little-known facts about ordinary items we take for granted. From airbags to teabags, toothpaste to tea, and condoms to crash helmets, each episode is a mind-blowing cavalcade of crazy demonstrations and rarely-heard info about everyday stuff.
Follow presenters Richard Ambrose and Jonny Phillips - two bona fide industrial scientists with an insatiable thirst for knowledge - on their quest to investigate how things are made, what's inside them, how they are tested and how they work.

1)  Tyres 
Richard and Jonny delve into the world of rubber to test tires. After whizzing around a track with a top stunt driver, they head to Dunlop's testing chamber - The Burst Cell - to witness a Boeing 737 tire being over-inflated to destruction. From tires, onto toilets where we join a team of toilet sniffers who create fresh smells to annihilate malodors, plus see their 250 simultaneous flushing toilets designed to test cleaning products.Later, our duo finds out what's inside a motorcycle helmet and follow the development of the ubiquitous paper clip. Finally, go behind-the-scenes at a plastic bottle factory to see how tiny plastic tubes become huge 2 liter pop bottles.
