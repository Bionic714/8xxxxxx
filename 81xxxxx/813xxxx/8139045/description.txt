"do not treat us like animals" - 60min documentary

The Panthers was started in February 2011 by a few older youths from the suburb of Biskopsgården in Gothenburg. With a strong sense of commitment and an awareness of class based problems, they are now fighting to achieve a meaningful existence by, among other things, reopening the youth centre in Biskopsgården that has long been closed. They want to focus on the cutbacks that have affected not only Biskopsgården, but suburbs throughout Sweden, which have led to increased poverty and social vulnerability.
