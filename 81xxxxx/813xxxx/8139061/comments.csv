ABC know that if the last 2 episodes are aired in an English-speaking country, someone will rip it and Americans will download it (as they have for episode 10 and 11). And they don't want Americans to see these episodes unless they choose to let them.

Australian TV was going to air them, but FOX got them to stop after episode 11. Hoping for re-runs on ABC in Summer is probably the best bet."
,Tadrio,2013-02-25T16:36Z,"* FOX -> ABC.
FOX is the OZ station that was airing them."
,saint84,2013-02-26T18:53Z,why not somebody put out a sub in english for ep 12 and 13 . that way. no need to look for english audio .
