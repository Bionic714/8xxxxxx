,Ahlat,2013-02-13T16:41Z,Thanks for this. Loved the comic. Especially loved how the Joker built up his cruel act against the family and it ended up being a joke!

Mate, the series was awesome, I agree. The climax did not live up to it's build-up.

But, again that's just my opinion."
,superbatg2,2013-02-13T16:57Z,"Thanks for all the amazing uploads!

Would you happen to have the following comics in the 1920px digital format:
-Birds of Prey #10
-Legion of Super-Heroes #10
-Teen Titans Annual #1
-Justice League Dark #15, #16
-Talon #1
-Batgirl #0, #10, #11, #14
-Red Hood and the Outlaws #0, #16

I can't seem to find these issues anywhere. I'd assume they are all released by either G85, Zone, Son of Ultron, Megan, or Nahga of Empire, but are missing in those Hitlist torrents by shipJ.

If you have them that would be awesome. Thanks!"
