John Christopher Williams (born 24 April 1941) is an Australian classical
guitarist and long-term resident of the United Kingdom. In 1973, he shared a
Grammy Award win in the Best Chamber Music Performance category with Julian
Bream for Julian and John (Works by Lawes, Carulli, Alb√©niz, Granados).
Williams recorded "Cavatina" by Stanley Myers. The piece originally included
only the first few measures but, at Williams' request, it was rewritten for
guitar and expanded by Myers. After this transformation it was used for a film,
The Walking Stick (1970). In 1973, Cleo Laine wrote lyrics and recorded it as
the song "He Was Beautiful" accompanied by Williams. The guitar version became
a worldwide hit single when it was used as the theme tune to the Oscar-winning
film The Deer Hunter (1978).
