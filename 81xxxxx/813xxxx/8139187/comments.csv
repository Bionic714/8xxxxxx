,PrinceCharming12,2013-02-13T21:24Z,"bestas u jerk, how about u say please and thank you once in a while? You do realise the world doesn't revolve around u and Nepotu is not paid to give us all this entertainment? that he does it out of generosity and his own time? People are so unappreciative!
Again, Nepotu - can't say enough to thank you for providing NBA games to people who wouldn't get to watch them otherwise. You're a gentleman."
