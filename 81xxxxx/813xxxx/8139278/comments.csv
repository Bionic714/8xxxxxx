I wonder what that joke was at the very end that they blocked out. It must have been pretty nasty if they felt compelled to censor it."

I can't believe the season is already over!  I love this series so much.  I don't know why shows like Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert go on all year long, but this is only given a measly 6 episodes (especially when it's so topical)."
