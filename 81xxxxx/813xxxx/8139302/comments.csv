,Niasyn,2013-02-13T21:16Z,"I think I could like this game, in a few versions. Thank you for the upload though!"
,nemesis8727,2013-02-13T22:50Z,"Seems like we don't need crack for this, works great. Thanks soulking"
,hawkeye21,2013-02-14T10:33Z,"Doesnt work for me for some reason. No error message, just wouldn't start."
,Kudi23,2013-02-14T13:36Z,"@hawkeye21
Run as admin!"
,kingcover,2013-02-15T02:23Z,"Correct, run as admin.

,kingcover,2013-02-15T02:26Z,Note:  It may seem frozen at the first title screen with no mouse control....just give it a minute and you're golden.  If you hit any buttons on keyboard or mouse it may crash. ;)

,beermotoraxe,2013-02-15T06:43Z,"Yeah. Uninstalled. Fuck this ""game"". Would not recommend downloading, let alone paying. Seems like a bugfest, judging by quick googling and reading."
,hellblade,2013-04-28T09:47Z,I had the same problem with character creation but after game update it works.
