,jalucian,2013-02-25T03:59Z,"Thank you! I've also now completed a 720p version of this, for those who need it a little smaller. In 720p, I got the file sizes down to 1.6gig for each 3 hour movie. In addition, I also included some bonus material in the 720p version that I didn't have ready when I made this torrent. Here's the link:

Keep in mind that my bitrates and file sizes are optimized for those who store and watch movies on their computers. The bitrates are high enough to look perfect on ""normal"" sized monitors and low enough to keep download times short and the file size small enough for those who don't have a ton of free hard drive space to waste. If you plan on watching something on a large HD screen, you're going to need one of the larger file size, higher bitrate torrents. The larger the screen you'll be watching on, the higher the bitrate has to be to maintain picture quality. If you have a large screen, you'll need to experiment too see what bitrate it takes to maintain a quality picture for you particular size screen."
