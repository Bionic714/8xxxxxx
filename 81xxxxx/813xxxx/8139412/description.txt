Notes:

These are the extended versions (director's cuts) of Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy in their oringal Swedish with English subtitles in 1080p resolution, in x264 format in mp4 containers. The extended version of M채n som hatar kvinnor [Part 1] (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) is 34 minutes longer than the theatrical release. The extended version of Flickan som lekte med elden [Part 2] (The Girl Who Played with Fire) is 56 minutes longer than the theatrical version, and the extended version of Luftslottet som spr채ngdes [Part 3] (The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest) is 39 minutes longer than the theatrical version. 

The only other torrent I've ever seen of the extended versions in 1080p was a whopping 51.5gigs (around 17gigs each) so I decided to encode them myself at a much more reasonable fize size. I managed to get all three three-hour movies down to 8.4gigs (about 2.8gigs each.) The bitrates used are sufficiently high that there is no discenerable loss in quality when viewing on a computer monitor or average size television.

Since this is only the second torrent I've ever seen of the extended versions in 1080p and the ONLY one with decent file sizes, PLEASE seed as long as possible (try to reach a share ratio of 2:1 or better before you stop seeding.) Thank you.
