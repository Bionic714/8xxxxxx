An ambitious young man whose "mother" found him, as a newborn, in a pile of trash; an environmental activist and her parents; a political writer; an ex-CIA deep-cover operative; a professor of economics and one of psychology; a constitutional scholar; a librarian; and two movie stars  share a common fear; a common enemy; a common desperation; a common goal; and common plan to achieve the uncommon. Their rights  are disappearing into nothingness; their privacy is a thing of the past; their every move is observed and recorded; and hundreds of thousands of human lives  are callously extinguished and millions more destroyed, in their name. Their own money is being used against them. They are even forced to pay for their own oppression. The deteriorating situation in America hasn't a prayer of improving, because the majority of the people are unaware, don't care, or are too lethargic to act.  Unwilling to have their lives at the mercy of such people, they seek a viable solution. Realizing that working within the system is futile, they are set out to rally as many like-minded people as they can and leave the system. Naturally, the establishment has other ideas.

An idea whose time has come.
