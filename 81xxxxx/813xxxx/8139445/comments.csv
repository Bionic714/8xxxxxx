This trip of a lifetime takes him to some of the most remote yet stunningly beautiful places on the planet. Living with local people, who act as guides, he pits his fishing wits against many of the fiercest fighting fish imaginable. Keen to experience the local customs and traditions, Guy takes us on a journey of discovery as he seeks out his target species. We see nature in the raw — wild and untamed with an abundance of magnificent wildlife that is rarely seen by man.
