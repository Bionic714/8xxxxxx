 Gurvinder Singh's first Punjabi feature    
 film Anhey Ghorhey Da Daan based on        
 Punjabi novelist and Jnanpeeth Award winner
 Professor Gurdial Singh's novel tries to   
 bring to screen the effect that years of   
 subordination can bring to struggling      
 masses in the face of events spinning      
 beyond their control. Devoid of the power  
 to change course of their own destiny      
 and the invisible violence of power        
 equations. AGDD reflects the simmering     
 discontent etched on their faces.          
 The film was nominated as the Top Ten      
 Best Films of the World in 2011 by         
 the US Journal Film Comment!.
