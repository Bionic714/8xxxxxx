,ahvenan,2013-03-23T14:20Z,"What the fuck? The keymaker ""cr-extensis"" wont work, when i try opening it. it says its not compatible woth my system, im running Windows / 64-bit - Any solution?

Im guessing thats the keymaker since the other program CORE10K seems to be just some stupid demo and there is no instructions included in the torrent, wich by the way should be included in EVERY software torrent, not everyone who download them are computer technicians you know..."
,THRobinson,2013-03-23T23:30Z,"Works fine, Win7x64... no idea what ""ahvenan"" is talking about. I disconnected my internet to be safe, installed the program and added it to my firewall to block outbound connections. When I started the program it asks for a key, open the key folder and run cr-extensis.exe and generate a key. Easy."

Muchas gracias...nice one guys."
,gothambats,2013-05-23T23:43Z,Works great. Install first. don't launch the program. Hit the cr.extensis in the key folder and hit serial number. Launch program and enter said serial number! Viola!!! Thanks a bunch!
