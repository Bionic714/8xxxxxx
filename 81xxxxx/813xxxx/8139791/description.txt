Charley Boorman's South African Adventure
Join Adventurer Charley Boorman as he sets off once more on an epic motorbike adventure, this time making his way through the stunning, rugged and often unknown South Africa. Teaming up once again with producer/director Russ Malkin, they journey in a circular route starting and finishing in Cape Town, taking on all corners of this wild and varied African country, experiencing the deeply rooted cultures, the extraordinary people, the remarkable wildlife and the heart stopping adventures along the way. An abseil from the peak of Cape Town s iconic Table Mountain plunges Charley straight in to the start of his adventure. Following this he embarks on a journey of extremes that includes cage diving with deadly Great White Sharks in the rough Atlantic seas; navigating the majestic yet incredibly precarious Sani Pass to reach the icy peak; detonating dynamite deep underground in a Barberton Gold Mine; tracking lions on foot in the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park; and searching the ocean floor for the perfect diamond in the ship wreck strewn West Coast. The incredible trip culminates in a huge motorbike convoy down to Signal Hill in Cape Town accompanied by over 250 local riders.




4)  Part 4 
This week, Charley meets a research team who study scorpions and risks life and limb learning how to handle one of the world's most venomous creatures. Heading into the centre of the country, Charley gets behind the wheel of some of the giant trucks and machines used in the open iron ore mines. Moving west, the team spends two nights learning the way of the nomad with the San tribe in the desolate Kgalagadi National Park, before reaching the western coast. Venturing into the ocean once more, Charley goes diving in the open waters for diamonds, before ending the episode, and the series, in true Boorman style - leading a convoy of over 300 bikers from the Meer lust Winery through the beautiful mountains and beaches of Cape Town, to Signal Hill, renowned for its spectacular views.
