After instal,l when you Copy / Paste / Replace the Crack in the root directory in C/Program Files.... Place a Shortcut of the Cracked file on the desktop (and delete the one placed by the program at the time of installation). Use the new shortcut to start the program. If you do not follow this procedure, you will be asked for the Serial etc at the time of launch, which will not work."
