,enter90s,2013-02-14T00:22Z,This is why I don't watch tv on cable. Too much ads. Thanks anyway. :)
,resweb,2013-02-14T07:24Z,"um wtf, COMMERCIALS in a torrent? fail."
,DTake2012,2013-02-14T19:12Z,"Has all the commercials as if you were watching on TV.

Besides that, works good. Just skip through the ads."
,twijjit,2013-02-17T19:07Z,I'd rather skip through commercials than not have it at all. Easy enough to just watch it now and find a suitable replacement later.
,twijjit,2013-02-17T19:42Z,No commercials: http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8140908/
,jchen9999,2013-02-20T14:17Z,please upload episode 8
