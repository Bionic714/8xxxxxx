,FrozenApe,2013-02-16T21:37Z,Amazing story on how the guys were railroaded by the corrupt Swedish and US system. The judge being a party to the systems special interest groups was the topper. Thank god there is still left on the net where you can go and exchange the truth with your peers.
,FrozenApe,2013-02-16T21:47Z,"BTW peeps, if the subs are not working for you in one player, use another. In VLC it plays perfect with subs. 

Some many witty remarks in this one, I cracked up hard many times from the dry wit. 

The Swedish prosecutor and the Hollywood prostitute (female Swedish barrister representing Hollywhore) were exactly like they say in the film ""lacking souls"" and were total ignorant douches."
,Lonsman,2013-02-17T02:05Z,"Great flick! thanks for all you do, PB and YIFY!"

,swap44,2013-05-10T15:19Z,"Ask yourself, ""would there be a Pirate Bay if we had proper competition, fair distribution and reasonable prices?"" Corporate greed has only got itself to blame for the popularity of worlds biggest public library in the digital age."
