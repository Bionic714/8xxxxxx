MegaSeg is a totally self-contained DJ music mixing and radio automation system which benefits from the ease, mobility, and reliability of Mac computers.

MegaSeg enables DJs and radio stations to put their massive music libraries on their Mac and seamlessly segue or beat mix between songs or music videos, trigger sound effects via hot keys, note requests via color coded request lists, cue tracks via a second sound output, create dynamic scheduled playlists, and program timed playlist events.

Mobile DJ businesses can use MegaSeg to easily add another system to their growing business, and is a professional solution for DJ's who need more mixing control than Apple's iTunes offers. MegaSeg has full integration with the iTunes library and playlists, including compatibly with songs bought from the iTunes Music Store.
