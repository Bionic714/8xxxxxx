,alithegamer,2013-03-02T07:47Z,no one is repylying about how to fix the freezing problem on 3.55... please help guys...
,x3angel,2013-03-04T02:01Z,"*Important* You can only play this game on a PS3 CFW system, (example:Rogero CFW 4.30 v2.05) not on a regular system with Sony's official firmware - *Warning* this game has 4GB+ files -if you have the space on your internal HDD fine (no problems/play from int.HDD) - if not FTP game into your internal hd00/GAME folder then use Multiman to transfer it to your external HDD - Using MM internal File Manager- Multiman will automatically split the 4GB files so that it can be played externally. Then you can delete the internal version of the Game. Play the game with a disc inside the PS3 using BD Mirror enabled/With Disc & test Permissions & it'll work!

New EBOOT Patches/Fixes for 3.55 "
,x3angel,2013-03-04T02:14Z,For @alithe gamer here is the new fix for 3.55 that fixes the black a screen issue http://www.google.com/m?q=metal%20gear%20revengeance%20black%20screen%203.55
,alithegamer,2013-03-04T10:10Z,thanx a lot xangle for replying... i will try it right now and then i comment again.. thanx once again.
,alithegamer,2013-03-04T10:37Z,no hope... i have tried those fixes already.. and my issue is not the black screen. its the freezing on the save menu... thanx any ways
,x3angel,2013-03-05T01:43Z,"to @alithegamer  this may indicate that either there is a fault with your hard drive or with the save file itself. It is an annoyance but save files can become corrupt if you turn off your console while it is saving your progress. Once you begin to save or during the auto-save period DO NOT switch the console off. Doing so will result in your save file most likely becoming corrupt, un readable and un fixable.
Solution: There is no real way of fixing a corrupt save file. However some gamers have suggested that if you clear your system cache then it will allow you to load the save file. Also you can attempt to revert back to an earlier save file before your game was corrupted. If you believe that the save file is not the case and it may be your hard-drive. Attempt to transfer the save file by using a memory card to another hard-drive and try to 'Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance' save on another console. Some have said that will not play if the game is installed to the internal hard drive or if I u the update....when u erase both off the hard drive and choose to play offline or disconnect the internet from your ps3  the game plays "

,alithegamer,2013-03-05T08:08Z,"@x3angel. thanx again for replying, i have deleted all the save files which have been created automatically, i have removed all the metal gear data from the system, and even deleted the game itself from the hard disk, and did all the method again, loaded the game in the external hard disk, installed the game data to ps3, changed the eboot. but nothing nothing nothing it still freezing. after few seconds.  and as for my hard disk so its working properly i can play aal the games though it even resident evil 6 and dmc also... i think there is no fix available yet for 3.55, are you playing it on 3.55. once again thanx a lot for the reply....i am grateful to you."
