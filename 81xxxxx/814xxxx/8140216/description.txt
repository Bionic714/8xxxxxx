The GE 44 Tonner for Train Simulator, developed by DigitalTrainModel, is available in Boston & Maine livery and features opening cab doors and windows, and interior and gauge lighting. The locomotive is also Quick Drive compatible, giving you the freedom to drive the GE 44 on any Quick Drive enabled route for Train Simulator, such as those available through Steam. Also included are scenarios specifically for Portland Terminal (available separately and required to play these scenarios).
