*For a full listing of FFXI Private Servers please download the readme.txt file.

* I did NOT create any of these servers nor am I responsible for any changes or maintenance for them. I simply stumbled across them and thought they looked fun so I am sharing them.

* Play on the recommended server is highly advised. The  dev team seems to know what they are doing,  hey seem more than willing to listen to player suggestions and problems. They are also one of the few private servers with active GMs in-game.The server is small but it is continuing to grow.
