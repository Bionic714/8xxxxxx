These creatures are more than ordinary decorations, they are optical illusions!
A picture says more than a thousand words, but in this case we need videos to
demonstrate. When you move around it seems like the creature follows your movement
and turns its head, looking at you.

How does it work? If we move around when viewing a solid object, our brain knows how
the object we are looking at should behave. However the dragon gives us the wrong
clues, because we mis-interpret what its shape is. We assume that the nose of the
dragon is pointing out towards us, but in fact the dragon's head is concave.
This is called a Hollow-Face illusion.

Now you can build one yourself! Print it with your printer on regular paper, for
example standard A4, or use thicker paper. Then cut it out, fold and stick using
glue. That is all!

Tips:
- Many of the illusions are assembled in a similar manner, so if the illusion you
  want to build doesn't have understandable instructions, see another one for help.

- For OPTIMAL effect, COVER OR CLOSE 1 EYE, to shut off your brain's access to true
  depth perception, forcing it to interpret on shape and light only. Two eyes may
  work. One is better.

- Bright but diffuse lighting. Lighting which is too harsh can create shadows which
  break the illusion.

- On the dragon's head and mouth, tape/glue the tabs as shown, but DON'T sharply
  fold the paper where unnecessary. Seeing creases doesn't help.

- Use thicker paper than the cheapest printer muck, but not too stiff. It's too easy
  to get in situations where light comes through from the rear.

- When cutting along the edge behind which the tabs will be attached, CUT OFF THE
  BLACK OUTLINE so that the colors blend unbroken.

- If you look at it for the first time ever, it might take a minute or so before you
  see the effect.

Enjoy!
