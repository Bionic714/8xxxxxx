Advanced windows volume control. Works in all windows versions both x86 and x64.

The main windows volume control is quite bad and not really friendly to configurate, i fell in love with this tiny program since i installed it, it's one of my must have for any windows installation, give it a try and you will know it too.

you can have more info on the developer page.
