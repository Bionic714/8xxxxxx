Trevor Roy Dunn (born January 30, 1968) is an American composer, bass guitarist and double bassist. Dunn came to prominence in the 1990s with the experimental band Mr. Bungle. He has since worked in an array of musical styles, notably with singer and Mr. Bungle co-founder Mike Patton; with saxophonist/composer John Zorn; and with the group Secret Chiefs 3. He is also a member of the band Tomahawk, replacing founding member Kevin Rutmanis.
In 1998, Dunn formed his trio-convulsant. Their first release, Debutantes & Centipedes, features Dunn on bass, Adam Levy on guitar, and Kenny Wollesen on drums. Their most recent release, 2004's Sister Phantom Owl Fish on Ipecac, includes Ches Smith on percussion and Mary Halvorson on guitar
