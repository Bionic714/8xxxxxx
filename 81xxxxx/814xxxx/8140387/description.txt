Sweet 101 (Digital Playground) [BDRip]

Ann Marie Rios, April, Aurora Snow, Faith Adams, Kaylynn, Lezley Zen

A new movement in adult filmmaking, Sweet 101 delivers all the warped intensity of the sexuality of youth, tormented by the surreal obstacles that life always presents. This innovative and subliminal feature is the curious, emotional, and sexually charged experience of 9 outrageous hotel guests, their 4 scandalous requests and one hypnotic dream sequence, as experienced and weaved together by a lone and quirky bellhop on his first graveyard shift. Utilizing visual satire to depict five revolving scenarios, director Robby D engages all of your senses in this controversial and contrasting tale of youths' fleeting beauty.
