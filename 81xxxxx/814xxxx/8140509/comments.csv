The world of demolition derby can be summed up by one simple axiom - smash or be smashed. We'll be offering a front-row seat to the explosive egos, intense competition and automotive carnage that make these destructive events impossible to turn away from. ""Kings of Crash"" is set in the world of legalized road rage, where the accidents aren't accidents, and the characters are as combustible as the collisions.
