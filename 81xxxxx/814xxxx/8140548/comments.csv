Download and run Tor so people from China, Iran, and North Korea can access the free and open internet :)"
,pir8guy,2013-02-14T11:33Z,Another massive archive instead of individual books. When are people going to learn?
,lawnac,2013-02-14T22:05Z,"There are too many individual books to list, man.  I tried, but TPB only allows a certain number of words in the description.  since I could only list half of the books, an archive is better, IMO.

Or, make your own damn torrent :P"
,trejedy2,2013-04-29T22:32Z,"Lawnac, thanks for this. not complaining, but the way around the text limit is to post in bits, as in: "" 
Guerrilla Warfare & Military Books - Modern Ninja Library Part I"" "" 
Guerrilla Warfare & Military Books - Modern Ninja Library Part II"" etc.
With the books listed as separate files, one can choose not to download those of no interest. No one has a right to complain about free posts, but it does make torrents more enjoyable/useful/fast if the files are listed. At least I fid tat true. Again, though, thanks for the upload."
