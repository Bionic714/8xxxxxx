Guerrilla Warfare and Military Books Collection

The FBI, CIA, KGB, Mossad, Al Qaeda, and all other groups of
professional hooligans don't need these books because they already
have them in their own libraries. And most revolutionary groups have
most of these books already. So, none of these groups have a need
for this collection of demolition, arson, poisons and booby traps.


But the average citizen, who perhaps wants to study what the
professionals know, will find this library a gold mine of information.
Writers who need ideas for their action-adventure books and
screenplays will benefit from reliable methods and techniques for
raising havoc and taking care of enemies. And for the citizen who
wants to know how the various terrorist groups, patriotic militias,
freedom fighters and guerrilla bands operate without having to rely
on the prevarications and lies of the controlled media, then these
books will give you both basic and advanced knowledge and enable you
to recognize such operations.


All of these books are legal under the laws of the United States of
America. However, if you live where the government is repressive
and wants to restrict your freedoms, betray your trust, defraud your
wealth, abolish your rights, or censor the books that you read, then
you should first ask your nearest commissar, dictator or neighborhood
block captain for permission to download this library.


Knowledge is freedom. So, be knowledgable and be free.
