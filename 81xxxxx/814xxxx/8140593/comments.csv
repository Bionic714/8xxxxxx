,wintersbutterfly,2013-02-14T20:43Z,My uTorrent eventually showed uploads. And then when I got up this morning I had lost the ability to connect to the internet completely on the service I was using. I switched services this morning and I do not want to jeopardize this connection. At some point 15 or so people were shown on most posts in uTorrent as downloaders. It was not much of anything. Just kind of a test.
,wintersbutterfly,2013-02-14T20:45Z,I see one person seeding. If that is true thank you.
,wintersbutterfly,2013-03-16T05:24Z,I noticed tonight that this one torrent has over 100 seeders currently. None of the others do and that is I believe because of some odd network problem I am sure. I can successfully DL and Seed any other torrents other than these and yet I can neither DL nor Seed in either BitSpirit o uTorrent. Somehow this one got out to someone who was kind enough to seed for me. Thx. I hope it doesn't suk. I wanted to say thx TPB and I was just messing around with Garageband. I prefer some of the other songs better. I have dissociative amnesia and am just getting back to be able to play my piano and guitar. I would be happy if I could get to the point of doing something original and keeping on my Blog. I don't care much for million dollar musicians and actors. I don't think that's what music was supposed to be about or what life should be about. Again. I hope it doesn't suk.
