Just some stuff I recorded singing against. Not worth the time unless your not busy. I am trying to relearn the instruments I played as a child and just am recording some stuff in Garage Band. 

The are on my Blog at Wintersbutterfly.com on my skydrive.

I am teaching myself how to upload torrents and just messing around. I get some downloaders so hopefully they aren't to bad.
