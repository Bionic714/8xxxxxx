Notes: 

The AUD speed was increased on average by 1% to match the soundboard. 

There are occasional gaps in both the AUD and SBD, so there will be instances where only one source is 
playing. The SBD has more cuts in it, particularly between songs. 

There is a second AUD source patched into Sugar Magnolia from 1:40 to 2:50, it seems.

The Low Gain of the SBD was increased by 3 dB.

The SBD can sound a little scratchy during some loud parts, which may be the result of the technical 
difficulties they were having in Set I. (Not due to Gain adjust)

The transition between disc 2 and 3 is seamless.

For mysterious purposes only, an echo effect was added to the 30 second bit of noodling before I Need 
a Miracle.

The results of this matrix are pretty darn good - enjoy this amazing Iowa Dead!
