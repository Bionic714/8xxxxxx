,Yaqov,2013-02-15T16:05Z,"Do you have plans to encode older content using h.265? 1080p should be the file size of an h.264 720p, and it could be made to look better with being a bit larger. Also I advise using HE-AAC vbr audio in the future, 64 vbr should be more than enough to sound good. Though I don't know what you use currently, mp3 or AAC?"
,cmurf70,2013-02-16T19:01Z,Any subtitles available? It's all Swedish right?
,Unicum2010,2013-02-17T17:45Z,"Thanks YIFY!!!
Any subs available for the non-english parts?"

Us educated downloaders realize that a 1 gb file is not going to be 100% bluray quality. Get a clue man. Go find an 8 gb file and shut up."
