Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site :: On the Wednesday, February 13 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks about the media cover-up the LAPD's deliberate Waco-like torching of murder suspect and former cop Chris Dorner. He also talks about Obama's State of the Union address, his proposal for indoctrinating kids at an earlier age, and his plan to impose even more unconstitutional executive orders on the American people.

Note: not mentioned in the official description, Alex's guest in the last 15 minutes of hour 2 (and the first 5 minutes of hour 3) is Steve Shenk, Infowars sponsor, doing an "infomercial" for E-Foods Direct.
