"The Odyssey"

After Oliver is shot, he turns to a 
surprising person for help - 
Felicity. Diggle is stunned when he 
sees Felicity walk through the front 
door of the lair dragging a dying 
Oliver behind her, and the two team 
up to save Oliver's life. As Oliver 
hovers between life and death, he 
flashes back to a seminal event on 
the island - a daring escape attempt 
with his new friend Slade Wilson.
