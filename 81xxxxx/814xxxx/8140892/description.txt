Discs III and IV of the MOSAIC limited edition set:
 

THE COMPLETE RECORDINGS OF THE PAUL DESMOND QUARTET WITH JIM HALL


Two of the smoothest, most lyrical players in the history of jazz made this music 

together several decades ago.


Could serve as good dinner music or even to put oneself to sleep with.


I don't mean that as criticism.



Discs I and II to follow .....some of these sets have become rather expensive
