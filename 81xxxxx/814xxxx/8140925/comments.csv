,phase700b,2013-02-14T18:10Z,Great Quality. I added subs and switched out the audio with a DTS track. Ended up 5.4gb. Big Thanks!

,phase700b,2013-02-15T01:51Z,"You need to learn about aspect ratios. A 2.40:1 aspect ratio movie does not fill a 16:9 screen. there are black bars on the top and bottom of the screen when shown on a widescreen TV. Which has a 1.78:1 aspect ratio. The black bars on a wider aspect ratio movie are not included in the encode. Thus a 1920x800 file is 1080 resolution.
Any movie that has a horizontal pixel count of 1920 is a 1080 resolution movie regardless of the vertical count.
Same goes for 720 files. If the horizontal pixels are 1280, it's a 720 resolution file. 
If that seems complicated, just be glad we're not talking about anamorphic DVD's."
