Please stop commenting on my torrents. It's highly annoying."
,bobp127001,2013-02-23T23:35Z,Will eventually be rebroadcast in 1080i on Global :) It's a shame no one seemed to cap season 1 in HD.
[T],duranie,2013-02-25T01:10Z,"I had no idea Global repeated season 1 in HD.   I can barely sit through the show first time around, so the ball is in someone else's court if HD caps are desired.  Definitely won't be me, sorry."
