,ManiekHD,2013-02-15T01:10Z,Guys is it working for you the page which is giving you the password fo .rar ? Cause in my case I have 6 options (Win  iPod etc.) but in every one I have to put my phone number so it costs. (If I just put some random number it waits for confirmation forever and can' be done) I've always have this problem with every .rar file which needs getting password from this kind of website. Any solutions? 
,ManiekHD,2013-02-15T01:16Z,"Ouch my bad, probably dowloaded some fake torrent, he was in first position so it misleaded me with [eztv], which is here now. Sory for that :)"

,ScarletteSpider,2013-02-17T02:37Z,"never ever never use the downloads that are zipped then when opened say that you have to go to a site to get a password to unlock the files. This is a trick to get you to disclose your identity and personal information like your credit cards, address, phone and real name. It exposes you to credit card fraud, identity theft, and identifies you as a pirate torrent user for legal prosecution of intellectual properties theft. Real torrent providers do not require you to fill out surveys, if they do it  is a bogus link and do not download!"
,Pirate599,2013-02-23T21:38Z,"Great episode, nice plot so far. Storyline is intelligent and i wouldn't change it even a bit. Quality - A10 V10. I usually watch everything at film.plotar.org	because they always have HD but they don't have tv shows so having TPB for TVshows is great, thnx!"
