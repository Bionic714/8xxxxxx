"Valentine's Day IV"

As Valentine's Day approaches, Axl takes 
Boss Co., with partners Sean and Darrin, 
to the next level by offering their 
services to help guys break up with their 
girlfriends. Meanwhile, Brick becomes 
upset with Frankie when he discovers that 
she has thrown out all of the school 
artwork he has made over the years, Sue is 
thrilled when ex-boyfriend Matt invites 
her to the school's Valentine's Day dance, 
and Mike accidentally sends a romantic 
text meant for Frankie to a co-worker at 
the quarry.
