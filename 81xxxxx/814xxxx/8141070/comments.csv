,Bmack2013,2013-02-15T03:02Z,Gr8 work asusual s4a PERFECT DVD Quality and fast dL keep up the great work guys thanks but some help for those out there who have the issue with the 2 files should have the sense unless their new to here to simply search the torrent and you'll easily find another v.i.p uploader who has a 1 filed torrent of this like extremezone which is the exact same torrent as this only the 2 files are merged to 1 which he obviously took the time to do thanks great job asusual ez keeping it real as always whereas s4a just uploaded as is you could even have a 700mb torrent from heromaster another v.i.p uploader which is just the 1 file also beginners stuff i know still anything to help....Long Live TPB Peace :}
,honkeyman,2013-02-15T03:13Z,Those of you who are complaining about there being 2 files are ungrateful pieces of $h!t. You should be thanking scene4all for everything he/she/they do for the community. If you can't handle combining the two files yourself then go buy the damn movie yourself.

I guess you're one of the many ignorant folks that visit this site, yes?

Since you want to try and classify individuals and put them into categories, why not go sit down with the folks that are just like you which the vast majority of people frown upon and wish didn't exist in the first place. 

I'm quite sure you will enjoy your stay there with so many like-minded folks."

Stop complaining people.
Sync is fine - if its not for you, its your shitty computer/skills, not the file.

2 cd's - Shit yes? Get over it, takes < 3 minutes to make single file.
1. Download and install avidemux - 6mb
2. Open file 1
3. Append file 2
4. Save

People calling everyone a fag for watching these movies... Fair call, but only for these movies."
,God_8,2013-03-03T01:07Z,"Yet another Satanic demon possessed mind control movie from the Baphomet of  HELLYWOOD faggots . When will you people ever wake up to this wicked evil sick Illuminati Slave form of unholy entertainment. 

VAMPIRE MYTH _ VAMPIRES ARE DEMONS _ FALLEN ANGELS _ LUCIFERIAN DOCTRINE

THese faggot actors are all demon possessed Illuminati slaves who sold their souls to the Devil for fame. They promote the Luciferian Doctrine of Witchcraft and Vampiric Myth

Do not let your children be led from God by this Satanic mind control - the whole Twilight Series was written under Satanic influence - it is truly evil - keep away from these movies !!
