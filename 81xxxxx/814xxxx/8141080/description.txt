"Mother Clubbers"

After Debbie fears she's lost her looks and Jackie 
discovers that on Earth she's considered a "10" 
(back home Larry Bird was the pretty one), they 
end up in Hell (literally), a hip new club, hoping 
to feel a little more like desirable women and a 
little less like moms, in this episode that airs 
as part of ABC's Wednesday comedy Valentine's Day 
salute. Meanwhile, Marty and a deflated Larry Bird 
look to Amber to help them makeover their drab 
appearances.
