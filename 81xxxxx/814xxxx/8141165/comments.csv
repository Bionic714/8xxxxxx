,sumosmurf,2013-02-14T13:52Z,How are there 164 Seeds and I'm connected to none? I've been downloading since 9 minutes after the torrent was uploaded to TPB and currently I'm stuck at 68.4% just like the 28 peers I'm connected to.
,sumosmurf,2013-02-14T13:55Z,"If you want to watch it online instead of waiting.

,beechyboy,2013-02-14T14:24Z,"You can only watch it on-line if your from the USA
They block any other country from watch full episodes."
,beechyboy,2013-02-14T14:37Z,"It's 8:38 EST and I show 115 seeders and 1,030 peers.
Looking better... 
This is what happens when not enough people are seeding.
Come on your guys with unlimited bandwidth... SEED!"
,runcdfirst,2013-02-14T17:39Z,"@beechyboy you have not yet seeded 100%, there are no other seed than you at the moment. the tracker reports seeds but they are bogus. "
,dicktator,2013-02-14T17:48Z,"So 91.1% is the best we're gonna get, huh?"
,Crucio117,2013-02-14T17:50Z,Everyone is stuck at 91.1%. beechyboy!!!
,lontrus,2013-02-14T18:03Z,"over 9 hours and still 28.5MB left to download
in that time not once connected to the illusion of seed that is 130 to 200

i usually dont have problems with speed and i have uploaded it already 2GB so how is that possible that there is still so slow speed ??? "
,beechyboy,2013-02-14T18:05Z,"I am seeding now, but it seem there was too many grabbers and not enough seeders.
Come on guys.... SEED!!!"
,je3544,2013-02-14T19:23Z,Some of us need to stop downloading and allow some seeders to get on. I've been sat at 91.65% for 7 hours now. No one is gonna get anywhere at this rate. I can't seed till I've got the file. Cmon peeps lets not be selfish now.
,beechyboy,2013-02-14T20:26Z,"You right!
I might have to re-upload this.
Anyone think that is a good idea?"
,beechyboy,2013-02-14T20:41Z,"I give up with this torrent !!! 

New upload ->http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8144325

Now SEED this time please!!!"
,Crucio117,2013-02-14T21:31Z,Well I'm downloading fine now. Thanks.
,thejinxster,2013-02-15T09:27Z,Don't bother stops at 92.6% tried 3 times.
