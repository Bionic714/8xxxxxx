"Trial and Error"

Kevin deciphers the tablet and figures out 
how to close the gates of Hell. He tells Sam 
and Dean that according to the tablet one 
person must face a series of three tests 
designed by God. The first one - kill a 
hellhound. Sam and Dean argue over who 
should complete the trials, and they realize
that Smallville was a way better show.
