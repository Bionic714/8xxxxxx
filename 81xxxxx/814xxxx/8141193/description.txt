"There'll Be No Teardrops Tonight"

Rayna finds comfort in the arms of an old 
friend after revealing to Daphne and Maddie 
her plans to divorce. Juliette is invigorated
by the response to her new sound and takes 
steps to reinvent herself -- against the 
guidance of her management. Things are looking 
up for Scarlett and Gunnar when Rayna makes an 
offer to sign them to her label. While their 
hard work begins to show signs of success, 
Avery struggles to find his old sound and is 
forced to consider an attractive offer.

Evolve... or die.

Enjoy :)
