February is when dear Uncle Creepy’s fancy turns toward . . . scaring the bejeezus out of readers! Prepare to swoon at the bouquet of terror offered up by our team of rotten Romeos: Gilbert Hernandez (Love and Rockets) weaves a tale of love gone horribly wrong, Jamie S. Rich (It Girl and the Atomics) and Joëlle Jones (House of Night) provide a peek at voyeuristic ghosts, Alisa Kwitney (The Plain Janes) and Chrissie Zullo (Fables) find love and terror under the full moon, and J. Torres (Jinx) and Amy Reeder (Batwoman) make you afraid to go into the water—or near your beloved! Plus, the Creepys find romance in Dan Braun and Peter Bagge’s latest Creepy Family strips!
