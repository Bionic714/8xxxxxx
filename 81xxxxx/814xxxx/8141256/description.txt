The Fire emblem games are probably the most well developed and continued tactical rpgs out there. Granted I don't believe Intelligent Systems has yet to surpass The Sacred stones with their newer releases.

This is a game which has stat building aspects with logic based decisions to help move your "heroes" or "army" to the end of the select level to advance further into the story. Most of the controls and things are explained in game.
