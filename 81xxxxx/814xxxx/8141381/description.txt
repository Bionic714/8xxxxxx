A brand new series straight from the Grimm Fairy Tales Universe. The Highborn Gods of old have been biding their time, waiting for the right point in human evolution to make their return. Some have waited with nothing but good intentions and the desire to help the people of earth. But not all the deities from the past have such altruistic plans. One fallen god has set her sights on a much loftier and more sinister goal...the enslavement of all mankind.
