The She-Devil With A Sword keeps the home fires burning... literally. An ancient feud in Red Sonja's native Hyrkania has flared back to life, and awakened old animosities, and a growing, deadly evil. To stem the rising tide of bloodshed will take all of Red Sonja's skill and daring... and the help of an old ally. But is his return an omen of victory... or death?
