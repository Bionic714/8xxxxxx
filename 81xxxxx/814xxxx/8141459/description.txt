You can easily run out of words to describe Jerry Douglas as a Dobro player . . . Maestro, wizard, champion, doyenne. Yet it's his wonderful playing that ties together an adventurous album of songs in which Union Station man Douglas opens up what must be one of the best contacts book in music and gathers together stars of the calibre of Paul Simon, Eric Clapton, Keb Mo, Dr John and Mumford & Sons to play on his 14th solo album.
The familiar is as classy as ever - an instrumental version of American Tune blending into Chick Corea's Spain, and the usual Douglas dexterity on Duke and Cookie and Gone to Fortingall.
His old friend Alison Krauss and cohorts Union Station join in on Frozen Fields (a Jeff Black-Jon Randall Stewart song) and Clapton plays on a bluesy, slightly overlong, Something You Got. The funky High Blood Pressure (with Keb Mo and Dr John) hits the mark, its sultry sound helped by Sarah Buxton's vocals, the trumpet of New Orleans jazzman Wendell Brunious and the saxes of Rex Leary and Aaron Fletcher.


The highlight, though, is the collaboration with Mumford & Sons for a version The Boxer. Marcus Mumford takes lead vocals - something that can't have been an easy ride with songwriter Simon joining on vocals and bells - and delivers an impassioned and powerful version - with Douglas managing to sizzle and bring out the pathos of the song on dobro and lap steel.
There is a grungy, oddly likeable instrumental called So Here We Are and, to cap a bold project, Douglas takes lead vocals (for the first time since singing Ben DewberryΓÇÖs Final Run on Fluxedo in 1982) on the Leadbelly classic On A Monday. Krauss won't be absolutely shaking in her boots about being supplanted as lead vocalist on their next album together but it's a fine take in an album (produced by Russ Titelman) of eclectic delights.
