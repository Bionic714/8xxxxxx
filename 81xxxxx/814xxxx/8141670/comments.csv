in video description its written.. language: English; default:yes; forced:no.. i am assuming it is subtitles..."
,canc232,2013-02-14T12:08Z,"No subtitles are not included. 

When/if subtitles are muxed in the mkv file(softcoded) you can see an ID : 3(or 4 or 5)depending on the number of audio  and video tracks muxed in the file.

If only a single video(id:1) and a single audio(id:2) are present in a file like this one, then you'll probably see it like this:

Text :
ID : 3 
Format : UTF-8 
Codec ID : S_TEXT/UTF8 
Codec ID/Info : UTF-8 Plain Text 
Language : English 
Default : Yes 
Forced : No 


If subtitles are hardcoded into the frames of the video then you will not find such an extra text column.

You may find the subtitles in the screens though (if the screens are captured during an active dialog)"
