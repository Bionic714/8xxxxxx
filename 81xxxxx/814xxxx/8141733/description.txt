The music contained in this release is sourced from a TDK SA-90 cassette tape given to Scott Putesky (aka Daisy Berkowitz) by Marilyn Manson. In early 2013, Scott sold the tape to adamsribs, who passed it on to fellow Provider Module forum member Cringeon, who went on to rip and remaster the audio.

Several songs have different or additional lyrics when compared to the official album equivalents: Angel with the Scabbed Wings, Antichrist Superstar, Minute of Decay, Mister Superstar and The Beautiful People. Astonishing Panorama is very different from the official version. Piss in the Wound (originally Crippled Groom) is an unreleased song - not to be confused with the Dungeon Master/Teen Dabbler song. Irresponsible Hate Anthem is a full demo, as opposed to the ΓÇÿdevelopment versionΓÇÖ that was previously leaked. Likewise, the version of Antichrist Superstar here is previously unreleased, and is different from the version leaked to the internet recently. Tourniquet cuts off at 2:51. Little Horn is not on the cassette, despite being listed on the back. Scott plays guitar and wrote Wormboy Gets His Wings, Irresponsible Hate Anthem, Antichrist Superstar, Mr. Superstar, Man That You Fear, Tourniquet, Piss In The Wound, and Suicide Snowman. The unreleased tracks are part of what is known as the Spooky Kids catalog.

In addition to the tape, we have included some additional demos. One of the demos is Heaven on the Brain. Heaven on the Brain is musically related to the song Antichrist Superstar, this track was intended to be the intro for the eponymous album. Inspired by the Jesus Christ Superstar tune "Heaven On Their Minds" (original album recording features Stevie Ray Vaughn).
