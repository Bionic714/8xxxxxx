If the Playlist tries to open in Windows Media Player, right click on it and go to properties. Change it to VLC or your player of choice and it will work just fine. On continuous is really the only way to enjoy this stuff.

POMPLAMOOSE

YouTube and actual life sensation Pomplamoose has individual videos viewed over 86 million times on YouTube alone.

"Pomplamoose is an American indie music duo consisting of multi-instrumentalists Jack Conte and Nataly Dawn. The duo formed in the summer of 2008 and sold approximately 100,000 songs online in 2009." -- According to the interwebs, so it's true.

This torrent includes a high-def copy of every musical track they've ever uploaded, minus all the talking and what-not boshat at the end. When consuming music, you don't need that, so I just slashed it down to nothing but the beats.

The files are all FLV format in either hi-def, or the highest def available from the source recording.

Please seed and please enjoy. These guys give me endless hours of enjoyment, so I hope you feel the same way.

Oh, and I'm a torrent creator, so I'm supposed to spam some a bunch of links. Only problem is I'm a non-commercial one, so I don't really have anything to sell. I guess I'll just give you all of their links instead.
