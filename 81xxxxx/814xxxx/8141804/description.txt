This book is a Canadian adaptation of Lippincott's Textbook for Nursing Assistants, retaining the book's direct, conversational writing style and emphasis on professionalism and humanism. This adaptation prepares students to work as Personal Support Workers (who may be designated by other titles, depending upon the province) in long-term, acute, and home health settings. The original text has been adapted to cover the Canadian healthcare system, discuss considerations for caring for native Canadian populations, and present SI units of measurement. Although each province has a slightly different scope of practice, care has been taken to address the most general, overriding issues of concern to all provinces.
