I tried installing theme directly but it says it failed..."
,toorentz,2013-02-21T05:13Z,"1)Download Go Launcher Ex on your Android Device from the PlayStore
2)If you Download the theme from your PC Browser, transfer the theme to your Android device via USB or via Bluetooth. After the transfer is complete browse to the location of the transferred theme file via your Android default File manager or a third party file manager like AndroZip.
3)Tap the file to install.
4)If you get an installation error make sure you have ticked marked "" Unknown sources - Allow installation of non-Market apps"" in settings - security
5)Browse Apps and tap on the Go Launcher Ex App Icon. This will start Go Launcher.
6)Click Menu. Tap on themes.
