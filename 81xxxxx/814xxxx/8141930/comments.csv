,Babygeorge,2013-02-15T01:38Z,"I better be a dumb atheist than a smart religious person!
=P"
,jameskrueger2nd,2013-02-15T04:28Z,"The world's biggest mass murderers were marxist atheists fighting against religion, and this idiot talks about 9/11. What a moron. You have to be pretty ignorant and stupid to believe and follow this kind of crap. 

""Reason"" and ""science"" is when idiots change Christmas tree to Holiday tree LOL

,Babygeorge,2013-02-15T18:27Z,"Marxism is treated as a religion on this book -deservedly so as it spawned so many tragedies and fanatics in the way a religion normally does.
On this audio-version -at the 1 hour 14 min mark -you can listen the guy talking about Marxism as a religion-like ideology.

,hoeby1970,2013-02-17T22:31Z,I'm sorry but if you believe in any religion you forfeit your right to take part in a rational debate. By your very nature you are irrational so it's like trying to reason with a 4yr old or a drunk. Adults with imaginary friends are simply not to be taken seriously.

Now read the title: 'The God Virus'. Now where is the rationale in comparing the supernatural with a string of DNA? If anything, God inspires man to live a moral life. If there is no God then where is the reason for any moral (or the source of the information in the DNA of the virus). 
Comparing the greatest being to the smallest possible form of life is again saying a lot about the inspiration of the author. 
Stupid and deliberately demeaning title. 

By the way, the religious symbol for the writers religion (= same as of the real perpetrators of 9/11= NWO) is omitted from the cover. 

It's on the internet. It must be true!"
