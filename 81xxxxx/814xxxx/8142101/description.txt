"Candle Romance," the second episode of the "Snow Fun" series, was produced by multi-talented (not to mention drop-dead gorgeous) SexArt (and MetArt) model Ariel Piper Fawn and her creative collaborator, director Andrej Lupin. The first episode took place in the city, before the participants depart for a winter vacation. In "Candle Romance" we jump to the snowbound vacation destination ΓÇö and right into the middle of a passionate session of lovemaking that's already in progress. The bedroom is filled with numerous warmly glowing candles, and the mood is overwhelmingly and irresistibly romantic as Emylia Argan and Kristof Cale heat up the winter night. As the camera moves around the room the mood is as romantic as the title implies, and the sense of intimacy is powerful and engaging. "Candle Romance" ignites an inferno of erotic intensity ΓÇö pull up a chair and get ready to feel the heat.
