As the debate on file sharing heats up and people are being extradited to the USA to face criminal charges and being treated like terrorists just suck on this fact!

I requested this be made available commercially with no success.  The audio album and the whole film is out there but not just the video tracks, which was what I wanted for my Music Video venues.

I then requested just ONE video track be re issued for Valentine's Day...  TRUE LOVE.  Nothing.  Not any movement, so I grabbed this pirated film (Thanks to the original seeder for the 720p Hi def blu ray version of this MGM Classic) and then using a powerful PC and software edited this for the World to share, as MGM and the Music Industry do not care what there end users, or customers want these days.

So fellow Pirate, enjoy this classic and if your Girlfriend is called Sam or Samatha...  Wow you lucky SOB!!!  As everyone featured in this classic has now passed away, including the composer Cole Porter, who the heck gets the royalties and copyright now anyway... good question.. bloody Crooks that is what Hollywood are.
