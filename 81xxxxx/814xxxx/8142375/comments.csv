UFO news Bundle I uploaded.. fact or semi-fact or legend

I guess its possible it was a well with water to start with and maybe
the bottom collapsed into a bigger cavern .. as there are caverns very deep naturally.. although some claim Russians drilled as far as 40.000 and no further as earth pressure collapse it but then humans dont know everything still.. 
natural caverns known to exist to 8000 but dont mean there arent more out there

I like the gov interference in the story that just adds to it and the google earth map blockage :) regardless its a great story
there was a crap horror movie made and  based on it called the HOLE"
[V],psspss,2013-02-14T15:21Z,"opps terrserver not google.. I guess the army could of filled and hidden the hole by now but if someone finds it perhaps post google link

[V],psspss,2013-02-15T02:36Z,"In 2005 I was re acquainted with Chief Red Elk whom I met ten years earlier in California at a Seminar in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada. Red Elk living not more than 20 miles from me in Washington state, I was able to have several conversations with him on the mysteries of the area and Mel's Hole came up. He told me of 7 'Holes' in the the western half of Washington state and their approximate locations. I have been on 4 expeditions to 2 other holes and 3 trips to the ""Mel's Hole"". I have nver seen Mel's Hole it is quarantined off by the BLM and the Military but I know its exact location....I will have more posted from Chief Red Elk in the future and live footage of my expeditions to the HOLE'S...vangelis721

First, the story of Mel's hole didn't start with Mel Waters. On September 18, 2008, Coast to Coast AM had a guest name Red Elk, an Inter-Tribal Medicine Man who claimed to have visited the hole with his father in 1961 and also claimed to have more information on the hole. Red Elk has said the hole is 24--28 miles deep and connected to Mt Rainier. He has also been know to tell tales of an Inner Earth beneath the surface of the ground with a race giant lizardmen who make sex slaves of captures humans.
Red Elk is not the only one other one to have seen the hole. Ellensburg resident Jay Nickell remember exploring the area of Manastash Ridge as a teenager and coming across a hole that fits Waters' descriptions.
There are rumbling of a government conspiracy to conceal the location of the hole. Mel's property was near Yakima Firing Range, a 500 square mile training and firing range near the Hanford Nuclear Reservation, used by soldiers from Fort Lewis. It is said the satellite photos of the area have been altered to protect the military's training and that images of the hole and Waters' land were also doctored.
On Waters' second phone call into Coast To Coast, he described how was prevented from returning to his land by government or military Men In Black types. They claimed there was a plane crash on his property and would not allow him back on his property. Could these Men In Black possibly be responsible for then erasing any record of him owning property or paying taxes in Kittitas County?
During his second call, he also told the story of a conversation Waters had with a long time Kittitas County resident who remembered the hole from many years ago. According to the long time resident, there used to be stone monoliths, much like Stonehenge, with out the top pieces, surrounding the hole.
Waters is thought to now be in Nevada, studying another mysterious hole. This hole is creeper yet, with a bizarre story of a dead sheep that was lowered into Waters' new hole and returned dead and completely 'cooked' on the inside. When cut open, the sheep was found to be filled with a jelly like substance described as a tumour that formed into a alien/seal like creature that jumped back into the hole.
Until Mel Waters resurfaces, we may never know the truth behind the strange tale of Mel Waters and The Devil's Hole."

[V],psspss,2013-02-20T10:24Z,"TNE is hassling me with the same old stuff here did here at kat.. about encoding and long names

so I repeat it here incase --

the problem is not long names.. the problem is users making many sub folders and long download folder names to download it..
utorrent can create a file that exceeded explorers limits and
explorer cant access it.. thats MS for you
The names I use are good they are descriptive and great for searching later on.
just as well we dont all follow the pack like... 

--- also in descript i mean many SUB folders not SUN folders LOL"
