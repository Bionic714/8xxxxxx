release notes

Darkout is a sandbox action-game with strong survival and strategy
components. You are the only survivor after your escape pod crashes on
a strange planet. The environment is full of mysterious and hostile
shadow creatures, and the only way to survive will be to gather
resources used for crafting and researching new weapons and technologies
The world is sunk in permanent darkness and the shadow creatures
surrounding you are especially sensitive to light, and both play a key
role if you want to last in this world. During the game you will have
to use your strategic skills to build up new facilities which will
allow you to progress further. Darkout brings a completely new
experience to the player, frenetic, distressing and graphically far
superior to what has been seen before in the sandbox genre
