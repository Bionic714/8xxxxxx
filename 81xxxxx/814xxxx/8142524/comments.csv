,sldscrl,2013-02-14T19:52Z,Can't thank you enough! This was an amazing game back in the day and still is! 
[V],esharoth,2013-02-14T20:14Z,It seems that they have added more bonus content for the game: SHODAN full size render and concept maps. These weren't available when I initially made the torrent. I can upload them separately if anyone wants them.
,Ignusdej,2013-02-15T06:43Z,"@esharoth - Yes, upload them please."
[V],esharoth,2013-02-15T11:44Z,"Here you go, the rest of the bonus content:

,ArcImpulse,2013-02-15T15:15Z,"I don't get it. The official patch for the game was 2.3 (which is quite old), and this seems to be version 2.2? Can this even be updated to the New Dark patch?"
[V],esharoth,2013-02-17T10:32Z,"Here is a modding guide for the game:

,DJ_Pix3lbot,2013-05-12T15:20Z,"The only thing scary about this game is the shitty hit detection and the goddamn monkeys that shoot f*cking lasers at you. In short, the perfect game for masochists!"
,neko28th,2013-05-12T21:33Z,seed thx :D
,Chillmind,2013-05-29T01:29Z,"Could not get the game to work properly.  When I go to start a new game all that is visible is a tiny, tiny portion of what I am supposed to be seeing."
