This is a HIGHLY improved version of the Tomorrow discography I uploaded before. Not only does everything have a CBR of 320, it also includes the 2004 reissue of Tomorrow's s/t album, Mark Writz's project "A Teenage Opera", and a collection of Keith West recordings on "Groupsand Sessions '65-'74". 

I was hoping to find more material, but that's about as much as I can find, would love to know if there are any bootlegs of Tomorrow or even Tomorrow as The In Crowd that are floating around.
