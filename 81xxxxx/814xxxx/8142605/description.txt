Richard Starkey MBE (born 7 July 1940), known by his stage name Ringo Starr, is
an English musician and actor who gained worldwide fame as the drummer for the
Beatles. When the band formed in 1960, Starr was a member of another Liverpool
band, Rory Storm and the Hurricanes. He joined the Beatles in August 1962,
taking the place of Pete Best. In addition to his drumming, Starr is featured
on lead vocals on a number of successful Beatles songs (in particular, "With a
Little Help from My Friends", "Yellow Submarine", and the Beatles' version
of "Act Naturally"). He is credited as a co-writer of the songs "What Goes
On", "Flying", and "Dig It" and as the sole writer of "Don't Pass Me By"
and "Octopus's Garden".
