I Didn't Know That
Industrial scientists Richard Ambrose and Jonny Phillips find extraordinary facts behind ordinary everyday objects. I Didn't Know That, an action-packed series exposes little-known facts about ordinary items we take for granted. From airbags to teabags, toothpaste to tea, and condoms to crash helmets, each episode is a mind-blowing cavalcade of crazy demonstrations and rarely-heard info about everyday stuff.
Follow presenters Richard Ambrose and Jonny Phillips - two bona fide industrial scientists with an insatiable thirst for knowledge - on their quest to investigate how things are made, what's inside them, how they are tested and how they work.

4)  Glass 
Can high pitched singing really shatter glass? Our duo enlists the help of an opera singer before heading to a firing range to test the true resistance of bullet-proof glass. Also, find out about Bumper Harris, the one-legged man employed to travel on escalators in Edwardian London to demonstrate ease of usage. In 'Testing Testing' meet Sid the mannequin who is blasted daily with 1,000┬░C flames to test fireproof clothing. Then Jonny takes an angle grinder to a snooker ball to see what's inside and we go behind the scenes at a soap factory.
