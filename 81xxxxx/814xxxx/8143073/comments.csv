[V],Gh0stNet,2013-02-14T14:43Z,for the first time getting warning with Microsoft Toolkit of any version with my kaspersky may be false positive but still Dev's must look in to it           
,w4r3zh4ck,2013-02-14T15:11Z,"It is official release. BTW I stopped used any kind of antivirus since 2009. Seriously, common sense is the secret."

,w4r3zh4ck,2013-02-14T21:14Z,My antivirus doesn't exist on my computer to test the official release but my common sense detects that we have an obvious troll here. Hmmm... maybe I don't need to install an antivirus yet.

Just a question : What's difference between KMS activation and Product keys activation ?"
