Funeral Suits are a four-piece from Ireland consisting of Brian James, Mik McKeogh, Greg McCarthy and Dar Grant. The music they make is expansive without being overblown, heavy without being menacing and all the more thrilling for its restraint. Funeral Suits debut UK single ΓÇÿColour FadeΓÇÖ was released on May 29 through Friends vs Records.

A shared love of epic, distorted guitars, blistering harmonius pop, art rock and electronica led to the band spending the best part of two years holed up in a disused office space in deepest North County Dublin, writing, rehearsing and at times venturing out to play as special guests for Franz Ferdinand, Passion Pit, The Maccabees, Local Natives amongst others.

Funeral Suits have recorded and finished their debut album with acclaimed producer Stephen Street (Blur, The Smiths) which is due to be released Spring 2012.

Funeral Suits first single ΓÇÿColour FadeΓÇÖ has already enjoyed support from BBC Radio 1 DJΓÇÖs Zane Lowe, Steve Lamacq and Huw Stephens. ΓÇÿColour FadeΓÇÖ is a song reflective of the trioΓÇÖs hedonistic adolescence and burning passion to escape Dublin whilst hinting at big things to come from their full length.
