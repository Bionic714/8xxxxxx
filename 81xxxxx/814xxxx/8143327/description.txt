Super Dimension Fortress Macross

If you grew up watching Robotech as a kid, this is the real Japanese, English dub version you want to watch again.

In the summer of 2005, ADV Films announced that it would be releasing an English dub of Macross on January 10, 2006. This is the first complete, unedited English dub for Macross, and featured Mari Iijima returning to reprise the role of Lynn Minmay. However, the voice actors used in the dub were not the same as those used in the 1985 Robotech adaptation. This version was released by Hulu for online streaming in the United States in February 2010.
