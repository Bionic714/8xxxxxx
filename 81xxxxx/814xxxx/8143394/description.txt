The film is based on a real life group of con 
artists who pulled off many clever robberies  
during 1980's, they robbed famous businessmen 
politicians by pretending to be the CBI or    
Income tax officers, on the pretext of        
conducting raids they would take away all the 
black money hoarded by them, the film also    
takes its concept from the real-life daring   
where the same group posing as CBI officers   
executed a daylight income tax raid on        
the Opera House branch of Tribhovandas Bhimji 
Zaveri in Mumbai, and disappeared with        
jewellery worth lakhs. The movie is set in the
early 1980's.
