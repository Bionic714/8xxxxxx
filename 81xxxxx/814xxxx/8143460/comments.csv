Lots of clipping. DON""T WASTE YOUR BANDWIDTH ON THIS TORRENT! IT IS RUBBISH. Disk 2 has the freq. but still too much clipping!"

Take the bash script, apply replaygain to all your flacs and run the script. You'll see that about %45 of all downloads from anywehre are clipped, some light some massively heavy. This script does not miss a single clipped waveform."
