,w55,2013-02-15T01:16Z,You are awesome...how you got this so quick after publication is beyond me...and this is the new one I am most interested in.
[V],dohduhdah,2013-02-15T03:50Z,"Oh, I usually get them at some education-oriented torrent site.  It's somewhat less accessible (invite-only), so I figured it would be useful to upload them to here to tpb. 
Piratebay illustrates what an awesome virtual library the internet could be, if people freely share information."

Could tell us which ""education-oriented torrent sites"" are you talking about?

Thank you
"
[V],dohduhdah,2013-02-15T19:37Z,"bitme.org, but don't ask me for invites, because I can't get invites anymore."
,10121984,2013-02-16T04:07Z,Excellent as usual. Thank you very much.

LOL, tell me about it, I tried myself to get hold of a Bitme.Org invite for months until I finally gave up on it.

There are other good e-learning trackers, but BitMe.Org seems to be held in high esteem which is why I so doggedly tried getting access to it.

Lately, though, I've found that relying on a selection of a few different sites is the best way to go. With the demise of Demonoid, it will be hard to build up a community where just about everyone chooses to release whatever stuff they've got."
