On version 6.5, my PDF took a very long time to open and to load every page. Hopefully this will speed things up.

Also, does this now remember the last page your were viewing on PDF and re-open it right there?"

Can you upload a good english dictionary?"

YES, the PDF opening and page-turning speeds have been improved several-folds (literally) and now it also remembers the last page you were on and opens the PDF right there.

BUT, it has also introduced some problems! Now you can't change the page if you are in full-screen mode and have zoomed in on your PDF, which you generally do, due to the smaller screen sizes, you just have to zoom. Earlier whenever you tapped on the page, as the lower corner emerged the option to change page, now they have for some reason removed that! This is so very irritating!

@LuharS: I only use offline apps, and the best offline dictionary IMO is Longman Dictionary of English which can be found here: http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8007552/Longman_Dictionary_of_English_5th_-_Pearson_Education_Ltd_for_An"

,Shah_Jahan,2013-02-17T08:09Z,"Request: [Android] Wiki Encyclopedia Offline WITH database.
The entire English Language Wikipedia (3.8 million articles) on your Android Phone! 

Official Site: http://www.bitmagictech.com/
Google Play Link: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.bitmagic.wiki.offline&hl=en

It requires only and ONLY WiFi to download the database of 5.2 GB. I am from India and here WiFi is a very rare thing. I wish to use this offline encyclopedia, but unfortunately I cannot due to WiFi restrictions.

I use a Chrome extension called APK Downloader 1.4.0 and use it to download .apk files from my PC and then install it on my phone. This is because of Wifi and 3G restrictions (unavailability) in most parts of India.

Can someone kindly create an APK file along with the database that can be downloaded on PC and then installed on Phone? OR Provide the apk file and database separately so that it can be installed and then copy-paste the database in given folder?

This will really help those who are in a dilemma like me. Hoping for a positive reply.

Thank you very VERY much. "
