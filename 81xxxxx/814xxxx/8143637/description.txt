Sensual Harassment - Escape from Alpha Draconis (2013)
_____________________________________________________


Coming to Brooklyn by way of the Alpha Draconis star system, Sensual Harassment is a disco-pop duo whose earthly mission is to get bodies moving on the dance floor. Following up its 2010 debut, the group put in some studio time with producer Jesse Cannon (Animal Collective, the Cure) and readied the Escape From Alpha Draconis EP for early 2013. On ΓÇ£Make Me Human Again,ΓÇ¥ the two-piece sings of the trials and tribulations of intergalactic love amidst a glossy pastiche of late-ΓÇÖ70s-era disco synths and beats.
