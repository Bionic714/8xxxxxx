--Install Notes--


1) double click .EXE
2) install, play and enjoy :)
3) If you like the game, then BUY IT. It's only $10, and supports GOG.com so that we can get MORE great releases from them without any DRM at all and that will run on modern OSes.

Runs using DOSBox, so should run on any computer. I originally got this to play the games on my netbook without having to set it all up myself. Runs great on Win7 32 bit, and Windows Vista 64 bit, so should run on any modern OS.
