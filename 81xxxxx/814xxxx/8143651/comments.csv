Also, that serial (MR49R - DRJXX - M6PX2 - V96BF - 8CKBJ) is kind of a ""god serial key"" for Retail copies. Often the slipstreamed copies of windows xp that you find online utilize that key."
,Frosty_Winnipeg,2013-02-17T00:42Z,sethg_'s previous statement saved me some time reinstalling. Just used a lil util called changekey.exe and entered that number.
,xerik,2013-02-17T12:48Z,"""It's the original image from Microsoft except added updates, IE8, Adobe Flash Player and SATA drivers.""
""NO serial needed during installation, the key is already inserted.""
...this is NOT the original."

,itworks22,2013-02-20T12:06Z,"Created a bootable install disc from the download - no problems.

Tried it on a new hard disk. Automatically installed with no activation required. I subsequently installed Microsoft updates inc. Media player etc and again there were no problems.

As it includes SP3, this install saved me a lot of time. In my case I had to do a new install on an old licensed pc where the op/system had corrupted. 

Grateful thanks to the Uploader."
,lito_S,2013-02-22T08:25Z,"Installer fails to copy PRESETUP.CMD and SETUP.ORG into the SYSTEM32 folder of the WINDOWS folder being created by the installer. You have to find a way to INSTALL this initially up to the point where these files are being asked, and boot from another OS with access to the said windowssystem32 folder and manually copy the files into it. Then reboot and let the installation continue...

At least that's what I did and it worked fine."
,lito_S,2013-02-22T08:31Z,"Oh, I forgot to state that i ran the installer from the EXTRACTED .iso files. I didn't have a blank CD to burn the .iso file. Maybe that was the reason behind the issues I got.

Just the same, many thanks to LOLZOB."
