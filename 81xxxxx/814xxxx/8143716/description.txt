Nigella Lawson: The Domestic Goddess
She's beautiful, intelligent, gifted, and one of TV's most unique and successful "food" personalities. But, the life Nigella had imagined for herself as a child is far from the story that unfolded. Her father was the most prominent politician in Margaret Thatcher's government and her brother, the editor of one of Britain's leading Newspapers. Her life, though, remained stuck in the shadows. Crippled by shyness and devastated by the untimely death from cancer of her mother, sister and finally her husband, Nigella was determined to recreate herself as a self-confident modern woman. Today, the Domestic Goddess has been voted one of the most beautiful women on earth cementing her fame, to be known around the world by just one name, Nigella.
