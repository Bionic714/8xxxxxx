IMPORTANT - JELLY BEAN USERS
Can't find the theme on TSF Shell themes menu?
If you're running Jelly Bean 4.1, this problem might happen to you.
To fix it follow this steps.
If you have a ROOTED device:
- Install the app/theme from Google Play
- Open Titanium Backup (or whatever you use to backup your apps)
- Find the TSF Shell theme that you just installed
- Run a BACKUP of this app
- Tap the app again and then RESTORE the theme (choose "App Only")
- Go back into the TSF Shell theme chooser and find the Theme!


This is a fully working version.
