Note that the only issue I'm aware of at this time is that if you try to activate things like core or prowmc it will just reset the grace period to 30 days and give you a ""this product was activated using unsupported blahblahblah""

So, just know that the same kms rules most likely apply to all of the activation methods that kmsnano had. pro/ent versions of win7 and win8, business/ent for vista, and probably all of the server2008 and server2012 and Office 2010-2013 stuff.

I have no idea on project/visio stuff or if it pre-converts anything from retail to VL licenses.  You guys will have to play with this yourselves.  I'll play with this a bit later to answer questions."

I was just wondering if you are planning on doing any aio releases or any other versions this round of patch Tuesday. If not, no problem and no rush of course. Seeding as always
Thanks"
[V],murphy78,2013-02-14T23:42Z,"ark, no I haven't though I noticed that cody's official torrent has the istole.it tracker in the tracker list."
[V],murphy78,2013-02-14T23:44Z,"brjohnson, yes I spent quite a lot of time sysprepping vista aio, and it's not nearly as easy to do as 7 or 8.  They will come, I just have to seed a day or two in between releases."
,jacob5800,2013-02-16T01:06Z,how great is all this stuff and what so ever people have to think before they take  and  look into it to see what it is inside it so  before you take use google and ask question about it and you will find the exact anwser  . sorry the spelling its not wright ?????
