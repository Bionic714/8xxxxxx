In the world of Mouse Guard, mice struggle to live safely and prosper amongst harsh conditions and a host of predators. Thus the Mouse Guard was formed: more than just soldiers, they are guides for common mice looking to journey without confrontation from one village to another. They see to their duty with fearless dedication so that they may not simply exist, but truly live.

Yeah, about that bi-monthly thing ... Petersen only produced one issue in 2010, 2 each year for 2011 and 2012, and the final issue (#6) arrived on Wednesday, about 28 months after #1.

All credit to the scanners, at least 4 are the work of Minutemen-DTs -- I suspect the uncredited #2 is also -- and digital-Empire released #6 ... I considered waiting for a DTs scan of #6, but decided to compile these 6 files together for now.
