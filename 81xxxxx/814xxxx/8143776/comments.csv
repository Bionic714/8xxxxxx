[V],dhjudasx,2013-02-18T08:23Z,"yeah looks like my Narnia 3 disc has a fault in it ... something I should have picked up when I first watched it via bluray player and ran into a hiccup about 1/3rd the way into the movie.. having to skip past about 3 minutes to get it to continue..

at the time I thought it was just the bluray player being stupid.

Resulted in slightly corrupted rip apparently... (sigh)"
