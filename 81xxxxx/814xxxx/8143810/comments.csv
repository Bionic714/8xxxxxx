,bloominoctober,2013-02-14T18:08Z,"Thanks for this issue.  I'm having one hell of a time downloading issues 7 through 20.  The torrents all seem to be dead (probably because they're old, and I'm late to this party).  Gonna keep trying though because this series (from what I've read of it) is great!"
