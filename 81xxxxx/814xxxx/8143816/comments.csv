,alohahe,2013-02-19T09:47Z,"Thanks very much again for this series! These are very fascinating to hear, especially because of Joel Rinne, who made the Palmu-movies at around the same time, I think. (And those screams by Rauha Rentola.. quite frightening!).

Another series of the golden age of 'old time radio' was 'Hyvää iltaa, nimeni on Cox'. This was originally a German series but had its most success in Nordic countries, especially Norway and Sweden. It's somewhat similar to the Temple-series: cliffhangers, unexpected turns and lots of martini, whisky and so on. But its not as serious as Temple, its in fact more like a parody of the Temple-series, with lots of wit and black humor.
I see that it was also produced in Finland and is still remembered today. Do you have anything of this series?"

I think there is only one 10-part series, named ""Hyvä iltaa, nimeni on Cox"". I got that and I'll download it here sometime in the future."
,alohahe,2013-02-22T17:38Z,"Great you've got that! 
This could be series No. 3 (of 5 series altogether), in which a mysterious girl plays the main role. As far as I know the German, Norwegian and Dutch versions all have 10 parts too. The other series differ somewhat in number of episodes. If its really No.3, then this should be one of the best ones!
Thanks so much in advance!"

I think it might be it. This radio play has a sub title Tytöllä oli sata nimeä ('the girl had hundred names')."

Kiitos!"

Oh Yes, this must be the series I mentioned. Thanks for the info! I couldn't find the title of the Finnish versions on the net, so I guessed. Glad, that it turned out to be this series.

By the way, these Finnish versions of Paul Temple are really extremely interesting! Listeners who know the original BBC versions will notice some slight changes in the script. For example, in the very last episode of 'Valentinen tapaus', there is something that isn't in the BBC version (that means the remake, of course). The villain dies in a different way than in the original version!"
