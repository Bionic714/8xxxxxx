,Malice181,2013-02-23T19:40Z,"You do realize that the original companies still own the rights to these games and GOG has to buy the rights to sell them, right? If anything THIS is the market you should support after you've tried the games because these games are awesome. GOG ges people great content at reasonable prices. Nothing wrong with supporting them (and DRM free games) and the creators who still make commissions off a lot of the titles."
