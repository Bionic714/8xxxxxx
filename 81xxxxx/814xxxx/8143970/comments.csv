,Super-E,2013-02-14T20:37Z,THanks!!!! CANT WAIT TO PLAY!!
,hellblade,2013-02-14T21:47Z,"@ SuperTsubasa
thanks captain obvious, he is asking why xbox version is three times smaller than ps3, I'm also curious aboy it. "
[V],thenoobish,2013-02-14T21:49Z,Tegra3: I'm right here! :)
,UKballerz,2013-02-15T00:54Z,"LOL @ SuperTsubasa. OK, after doing some browsing I think I got the answer. The Xbox version has lower bit rates FMV or the cut scenes video where the PS3 has much higher bits rate FMVs. Since I have both versions of the game and I test each one and couldn't tell the difference with the gameplays but the PS3 version cut scenes are a little more detailed. Good game though. Thanks m8."
,omegaviper,2013-02-15T01:13Z,Why are the ps3 versions of cross platform games larger than the others especially the xbox 360. This game is 3x the size of the 360 version. 
,SuperTsubasa,2013-02-15T03:02Z,"@hellblade
i tough i was clearer as i can get, Bluray discs have 25gb total on it so they riped games will have something close to that, just wiikipedia Bluray, and dvddl has a total of 8gb so theyr riped games will have similiar size, im sry clearer than that just with drawings. Any question feel free to ask Michael Google."
,SuperTsubasa,2013-02-15T03:04Z,and the ps3 version will have 10 exclusive levels more than the 360
,Super-E,2013-02-15T03:05Z,The ps3 version is on a blu ray disc and 360 is usin 8.5 dual layers. U can repair dual layers blu rays once there scratched ur fucked 60$ down the toliet
,HeroGhost,2013-02-15T03:48Z,thanks alot for this game
,bravesb,2013-02-15T04:51Z,"After I extract the files, the .iso file ends up being around 8.7GB and when I go to write it on a disc it is roughly 200mb over the disc size and as a result doesn't let me write it to my dual layer disc, what do I do?"
,omegaviper,2013-02-15T07:20Z,"@SuperTsubasa how are you such an idiot that you don't understand what we are asking?  We are asking why the ps3 version of any multi platform game meaning it is on other consoles, is much larger when ripped as opposed to the other consoles rip.  If you can have the whole game at 8.5GB on the xbox 360 why is the ps3 version of the same game over 23GB.  Why you think the disc size has anything to do with why the game is larger is just retarded."
,tazzeboy,2013-02-15T09:14Z,works fine on xk3y. at least the comments here keep me entertained lol
,fundemos,2013-02-15T11:46Z,Guys its Obvious that the Xbox version is the compressed version. So there is only difference in the cut scenes but gameplay is all the same VS PS3. :)
,bthanhawk022,2013-02-15T12:01Z,Its insane how SuperTsubasa gave an answer in the most simple straight foward way and still got called a idiot. ANY multi platform game(gtv iv mirrors edge portal 2 FF XIII and a bunch of others) will have a larger file size on the ps3 because Bluray(ps3) disc have more storage capacity than a dvd(xbox 360) disc. Thats also the reason for the more detailed graphics on the ps3 version. Excuse my rambling. Game working on xkey. Appreciate the upload. 
,mikeym41240,2013-02-15T15:19Z,You are all dumb.What they do for blue rays is they add alot of crap files just to fill the disc.That will make it less desireable to rip and download for the pirates.The games are identical.
,SuperTsubasa,2013-02-15T15:19Z,"idiotic is keep rying to get answers here instead of so simples things as go to google and stop whining, ask anyone or research and u will see that im right, other thing guys, needs to pass on abgx because the .DVD file numbers are from a xgd2 game abgx fixes that."
,DonnieHill618,2013-02-15T20:06Z,For the love of god people. Here is how it goes. Let's say you have two boxes a small one (dl DVD) and a large one (bluray) they both have the exact same items but the large one needsto have packing peanuts (padding) so it all fits. For instance if you were to burn a 700mb video on a bluray durning finalization it would add padding so the DVD would boot and if you then ripped the DVD IMG it would come out around 30gb that's it same thing different size.
,omegaviper,2013-02-15T23:14Z,"Too all the idiots that commented after my last comment you are all incorrect the ps3 rips do not have padding that is all taken out hence the name rip not clone.  Having any kind of program on a larger format of media does not some how make the rip of it larger.  But I asked this here because I already searched elsewhere, of course I searched google first you dumb asses.  The way questions get on google is from asking somewhere else.  Did you search google before you spouted that retarded rubbish out.  The ps3 version having better graphics would not make the game play files larger the ps3 takes care of making the graphics as good as they are; only the cut scene files would be larger but I find that hard to believe that so much more space is required just for some slightly better quality cut scenes.  My question still stands for some one who actually knows what they are talking about to answer."
,Assassinprofessor,2013-02-15T23:46Z,what the hell is goin on with the graphics??? first alien colonial marines sucked a$$ now this one looks shitty too...where did all the good games gone..lets hope Crysis 3 n Bioshock wont let us down 
,TGOD_ROB,2013-02-16T01:15Z,Sup mates anybody having problems making this?? I burned it the first time but when it got 2 about 89% it spit it out saying it couldn't be done HELP!!!! & thanks :D
,DonnieHill618,2013-02-16T01:19Z,Lol I dumbed it down as much as possible. Believe what you will.  If anyone has any intelligent questions to ask feel free. I'm only a software engineering professor at SIUE with two masters or ask the guy from nifty lube. That's my real name look it up.
,Smallz94,2013-02-16T01:25Z,yea i am glad that you uploaded the game but it is a good thing that i played the demo and it was just awful. So i am not downloading it.. Waiting until Crysis 3 to come out :)))
,DonnieHill618,2013-02-16T01:31Z,TGOD gonna need more info bud. what are you useing to burn. what DL DVDs are you useing. ect. ect.
,TGOD_ROB,2013-02-16T01:50Z,@DonnieHill618 I'm using Verbatim disc 8.5gb and I'm using imgburn 
,Jzong,2013-02-16T02:04Z,Mr. Hill is 100% correct and I better get extra credit. (and you only have one masters lol)
,DonnieHill618,2013-02-16T02:17Z,@TGOD_ROB ok I'm going to assume these things sence you are using the best discs and iso soft. you have run it through abgx (not nes but in case topology is missing from bad rip) you set img burn to automatically det  opt layer break but burning in turn. if any of these steps were missed or you don't get it email me donniehill618@gmail.com if you followed all of this which i assume you did i need to know exactally what error message you got. and do your self a fav and jtag rhg or at least an xkey its east as hell to install and semi cheap and more safe and the best part no more F ing dvds
,DonnieHill618,2013-02-16T02:19Z,Jim you're not getting anything and i Have a masters in AOJ too (weird combo right?) so ha.
,Super-E,2013-02-16T06:03Z,over all though blu rays are not they way to go its way more of a hassle more expensive and u cant repair them.
,Cafe1311,2013-02-17T14:17Z,Thanks soulking!
,jarldan,2013-02-18T14:01Z,"@DonnieHill618 - You make crass spelling and grammar mistakes for someone with two master degrees. Just saying that it is a little bit odd, isn't it? Not only that, but for a person who says at the top of lungs he's a professor, your instructions were pretty confusing or, rather, inconsistent if you will. Then again, just saying. No offence, of course."
,DonnieHill618,2013-02-18T18:17Z,"Spellind grammer mistakes and 
Inconsistent instructions. Yep that's about ever teacher I ever had. I'd like to say its from doing all this on my phone but the truth. The second spell check was invented I lit forgot everything. I would like to know what you mean by inconsistent I never get feed back that constructive and fyi I never yell I just type in a voice loud enough for everyone to here."
,DonnieHill618,2013-02-18T19:20Z,Hear* see there's another example lol

,fobio,2013-04-30T08:01Z,how is this a xgd3 game but has a layer break of 1913760.  It should be 2133520
,fobio,2013-04-30T08:55Z,this is all you do if you have trouble burning.  Open .dvd file change 1913760 to 2133520.  Now you can more more on the dvd-dl disc
