For more info search for Ys I & II Chronicles+ at Steam and you will find it.

Install:
Mount or burn iso.
Install the game.
Copy the crack as usual.
Enjoy!"

,SpibbyMcGoo,2013-02-15T07:08Z,"yeah config doesn't really work for me either. I mean it runs, but changing the settings doesn't seem to actually have any effect at all. "
,SpibbyMcGoo,2013-02-15T18:48Z,manually editing the ini files doesn't have any effect either. oh well. not a big deal. just thought this version was supposed to have widescreen.
