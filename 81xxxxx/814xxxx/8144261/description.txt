This welcome guide explains how to treat tics and TouretteΓÇÖs syndrome using natural and alternative therapies, from nutritional therapy, behavioral and counseling therapies, EEG biofeedback, and homeopathy to bodywork, energy medicine, and Chinese medicine. Author Sheila Rogers discusses categories of tics including spasmodic facial movements, eye blinking, mild sounds, and humming. She persuasively counters the medical establishmentΓÇÖs standard claim that such disorders are ΓÇ£mysteriousΓÇ¥ and based in genetics. The dramatic spike in cases, she argues, belies this explanation. Natural Treatments for Tics and TouretteΓÇÖs takes a closer look at the environmental factors and underlying physical imbalances that trigger these conditionsΓÇÖ symptoms. In this second edition to Tics and Tourette's: Breakthrough Discoveries in NaturalTreatments, Rogers offers a detailed natural treatment plan. No more will patients have to rely on traditional, drug-based treatments that often carry multiple side effects. In eight sections, the book offers advice from medical experts, the latest reports in medical research, a checklist of common tic triggers, inspirational stories from families who have successfully conquered tics and TouretteΓÇÖs, and practical worksheets for readers to use in their treatment and research. Each of the 23 chapters includes a place for notes and ΓÇ£Takeaway TipsΓÇ¥ summarizing key points.
