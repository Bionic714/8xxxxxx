,tpb_4_ever,2013-02-15T08:09Z,"Will need someone else to verify... works fine our side.
So anyone else face the same problem?"
,aviatora320pb,2013-02-15T08:40Z,errors comes unzipping the files...i used winzip
,tpb_4_ever,2013-02-15T12:40Z,"@aviatora: You will need 7zip software to extract the files.. Winzip and Winrar cant extract the 7zips in most cases.
All our torrents are made using 7zip as it provides the highest compression.
7zip is a free software in case you want to know.

And we have checked the torrent is fine."
