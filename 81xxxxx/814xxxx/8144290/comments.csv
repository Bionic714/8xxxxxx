,BluntzNzigzags,2013-02-14T20:14Z,is this real?
,kingcover,2013-02-14T20:24Z,"Check the pink skull dude and download with confidence.  :D  It was exclusive for xbox but now it's for PC.  It's Beta though, as the title shows so don't expect nothing too fancy just yet.  I own this game for xbox and it's....well....meh. ;)"
,kingcover,2013-02-14T20:27Z,"Note:  
1. Download to your hard drive.
2. Copy entire folder to somewhere like C:Games
3. Run BrutalLegend.exe to play
4. Rock the Planet!"
,kirtasheks,2013-02-14T21:20Z,this is the MP-only beta?
,BluntzNzigzags,2013-02-14T21:49Z,someone help. ive clicked the little brutal legend icon but nothing happens? it should install but it doesnt.
,unscarred786,2013-02-14T23:11Z,If you're a fan of Rock and Metal you should definitely get this game! It's worth the lousy $15 on Steam!
,kingcover,2013-02-15T00:42Z,"Bluntz, you don't install anything.  You copy the whole folder to somewhere, wherever you want like C:Games, then run BrutalLegend.exe.  I posted this above.

If it doesn't work for you by double clicking, try right clicking and running BrutalLegend.exe as administrator.  If that doesn't work, try also running in compatibility mode for Windows 7 if you're on Windows 8.  If you're not at least on Windows 7, then just go yank one out and give up! :P  If that doesn't work then keep in mind it is still just BETA. ;)"

Wait For The Full game."

,BlackSite99,2013-02-15T12:26Z,The program has stopped functioning why?
,petepat,2013-02-17T07:15Z,"Downloaded and tried running it on Win 7 64 bit and doesn't work for me. Tried running as admin, compatibility but still nothing. GL everyone! "
,ivanhoe68,2013-02-17T13:54Z,"I can confirm that this do not work. I have tried this on my Comp with win8, and my girlfriends with win 7, no luck there either. FAKE!!!"
,Kasookv,2013-02-17T16:03Z,"Doesn't work, run .exe file and nothing happens."
,PanzerVor,2013-02-20T16:00Z,"Fake. ""Download with confidence"", right..."
,whatsacomputer,2013-02-25T00:09Z,"I'm an idiot
I downloaded this onto my mac and i have no idea if it will work. when i tried to open it 1 file opened up called BrutalLegend but i don't know what to open from there to be able to play it(if i can play it). 

Is there any way for me to play this game on my Mac?"
