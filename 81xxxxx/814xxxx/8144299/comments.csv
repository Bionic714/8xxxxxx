[V],Mr.Stifmeister,2013-02-14T22:08Z,@ZtorkX86: Try right click on desktop shortcut or the game exe file and choose Run as admin. That worked for me.
,Pharmit24,2013-02-15T06:21Z,Why don't you upload the Game Poster?
[V],Mr.Stifmeister,2013-02-15T17:05Z,"@Pharmit24: Im not uploading game releases my self, i have an bot who do that for me, so it will come up to TPB as fast as a game release has been released by scene.

So in short, you will get games fastest from me :)"
