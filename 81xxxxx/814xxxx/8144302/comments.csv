,Azex88,2013-02-14T22:06Z,Thanks mirrormaster! and sorry to all the guys i was harrasing about this torrent. i was just confused cause i thought this came out before the single issue torrents. keep up the good work. much love to all the scanners 
[V],STFmaryville,2013-02-14T23:21Z,"Azex88 it's cool. enjoy the comics and seed whenever you can.

hey what does everyone think about next week's justice league of america #1? if i counted right, there will be 54 variant covers (regular + combo+ 50 states + d.c. + puerto rico).

... and are empire or minutemen or novus going to up a 54 covers release?

... and vibe #1 ships the same day? are they trying NOT to find an audience for that series?"
[T],MrDowntown,2013-02-15T00:19Z,B+R 17 IS amazing though
,whoresman1,2013-02-15T02:44Z,thanks dude! awesome job as always
,BatDingler,2013-02-15T05:46Z, can you upload Naughty & Nice Good Girl Art by Bruce Timm?
,crucifire,2013-02-15T12:45Z,"First of all, huge thanks for the great job you've been doing all this time!

2nd, I have a question about some technical issues.

When I open SOME files, all the pages in them appear as 1-pixel dots.

When I open them with an editing program, like MS paint, Gimp, Photoshop etc, they show up normally, and if I hit save, then I have no problem at all.

But is there anyway I can skip this and be able to see them right away? Could I be doing something wrong while un-cbr-ing them?"

,bostonpolar,2013-03-15T01:20Z,"Hello, MirrorMaster82!

I see you have in this week's group of comics THRESHOLD #2.
However, I went back and check the last 10 ""New 52"" group posting by you -- and found that you hadn't included THRESHOLD #1 in any of them.  It went on sale on January 16, 2013.

The first issue was ""The Hunted"", spun off directly from GREEN LANTERN: NEW GUARDIANS ANNUAL #1. 
""Larfleeze steals the spotlight in his first ongoing series of backup stories! What happens when Larfleeze, the ultimate hoarder, is robbed...of everything?!?""

Here is a link to it for everyone:

Thanks for you continued posting of DC now way beyond ""New 52"", MirrorMaster82!"
