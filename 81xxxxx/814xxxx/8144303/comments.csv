,charrrlie,2013-02-15T07:31Z,"Quality's not very good, but it's not terrible either. Also, the person who recorded missed a few seconds after one of the breaks, but it's watchable if you can't wait (like me) for another file.

That aside, thanks for the upload anyway, I'm just warning people who want to download the perfect file."

,Eddiehjjjfcfjfc,2013-02-15T12:25Z,After reading these comments I was expecting quality to be low but I played it in Xbox 360 and it seemed fine to me.
