,MrBigSeeder,2013-02-15T05:56Z,thanks again beechyboy! i was wondering what happened there before : totally appreciated.
,Kilroy222,2013-02-15T06:01Z,"Good effort, however this is an extremely poor encode. It's riddled with errors. Either wait for another source or re-encode with ffmpeg."
,blumpkinator69,2013-02-15T07:31Z,"Nice try, but this is unwatchable.  Sound & picture is distorted in places when played on PC with VLC player.  When played on PS3 I get a corrupt data error after a few seconds."
,MrBigSeeder,2013-02-15T08:27Z,i felt like i was on acid watching that. still watchable though.
,storm2012,2013-02-15T12:09Z,No sound after about the first 25 secs. Picture is poor in some parts. Anyone else have the same problem with no sound for pretty much the entire show.
,miamisunset,2013-02-15T13:48Z,It seems to be reading the partial old file as the full new file so that the this file is actually only 92% complete when it reads fully complete. I think this will need another upload under a different name.
,lagafreud,2013-02-15T15:21Z,"it's shit, hacks and looses sound, pixels up every 2-3 minutes."
,beechyboy,2013-02-15T15:45Z,"DAM!!!  I started using Handbrake to encode video. 
                          NEVER AGAIN!!!

Sorry "
,Kilroy222,2013-02-15T17:52Z,"Always use ffmpeg. If you want a GUI, use WinFF. In my experience, it's the only encoder that works 100% of the time."
,beechyboy,2013-02-16T00:09Z,"
 I'll check out WinFF.

Thanks for the advice Kilroy."
,beechyboy,2013-02-16T01:40Z,Hey Kelroy have you ever tried XMedia Recode ?
