With a gleaming airstream trailer in tow and a buyer lined up, Mike and Frank hit the road to California. When the deal falls through, they find themselves in hot water until a rare opportunity leads to an awesome trade. Like a Hollywood back lot, Guy's jaw-dropping collection includes an entire village built from scratch. It's the pick of a lifetime where every building is packed with classic cars and vintage movie memorabilia. Mike and Frank get first crack at a lifetime collection that includes the biggest collection of leather aviator helmets they've ever seen.
