,rickybobby1190,2013-04-02T04:39Z,"BEFORE GOING TO ANY OF THE ""ALTERNATE SITES"" LISTED ON COMMENTS:

make sure you are not getting scammed, most of the sites listed say ""free subscription"" but they ask for your credit card info. if you look up the website on google.com you will find out, for sure if the website you are going to can be trusted.

don't get scammed like so many others have"
