This is an extra song released by Shoujo Jidai/Girls' Generation that was released alongside the Flower Power Single as a B-Side
This is the only song released in the time they were releasing singles for the album ~Girls and Peace~ that does not appear on the album itself.
I suspect that they will most likely release a re-packaged version of the album with a new title and the I GOT A BOY song in japanese, however that song appears on the new non-stop mix set for release on 20th March 2013

Please seed and Enjoy
