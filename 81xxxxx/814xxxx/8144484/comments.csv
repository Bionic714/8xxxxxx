,blue.dot,2013-02-15T09:16Z,"Hey man, could you upload European and US Assets Pack?"
,tpb_4_ever,2013-02-15T12:44Z,"I had a request for these from other people too but they both combined are in excess of 2GB which is a big size.

You can download the Train Simulator Deluxe Plus torrent.. it contains both the European and US assets pack."
