,DGAFPolar,2013-04-05T15:26Z,"All the issues you need are there, but not in the correct order. I cannot remember which ones were out of order, but i remember there were a few. You'll notice that sometimes you will be on issues 16 or so of one comic and then you jump back down to issue 14 of another (just an example). DC doesn't do their stories like that, usually you need to read all the ""issue 13s"" before you move on the even one ""issue 14"""
