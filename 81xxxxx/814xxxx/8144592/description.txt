I Didn't Know That
Industrial scientists Richard Ambrose and Jonny Phillips find extraordinary facts behind ordinary everyday objects. I Didn't Know That, an action-packed series exposes little-known facts about ordinary items we take for granted. From airbags to teabags, toothpaste to tea, and condoms to crash helmets, each episode is a mind-blowing cavalcade of crazy demonstrations and rarely-heard info about everyday stuff.
Follow presenters Richard Ambrose and Jonny Phillips - two bona fide industrial scientists with an insatiable thirst for knowledge - on their quest to investigate how things are made, what's inside them, how they are tested and how they work.

5)  Roads 
Did you know that just 1km of three-lane motorway costs ┬ú13 million to build? But what are our roads made of and what makes them so strong? Our intrepid pair tests the durability of asphalt using a flame thrower, a high pressure water jet and finally, some petrol. Afterwards, we get walking at a boot factory where remote-controlled mechanical feet test water-proof capabilities and a real human endures temperatures of -40┬░C, all in the name of testing. Then Richard delves into the history of the telephone while Jonny takes his angle grinder to a catalytic converter to see what's inside.
