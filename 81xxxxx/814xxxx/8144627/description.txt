A group of old friends gets together for a weekend in a mountain cabin. Years have
gone by and yet nothing seems to have changed between them. But lurking behind the
laughter and stories is a murky episode from the past that continues to haunt them.
A strange, sudden incident alters their plans, leaving them stranded and with no
line of communication to the outside world. On their way for help, the group starts
to disintegrate, just as a new natural order is unveiled before their astonished eyes.
