By all accounts, Emma Marx is a beautiful, confident
 well-adjusted woman. Unfortunately when it comes to
 love and romance, she has found all of her previous
 relationships to be a bit routine and mundane
 Suddenly, that is all changed by a chance encounter
 with a handsome and mysterious man. He introduces her
 to a world she had only dared to fantasize of a world
 of erotic sex, role-play and BDSM. She questions how a
 man can so easily strip away her inhibitions and
 replace them with lust and desire. How is it that he
 has such control over her? Why does she like it so
 much? Her journey of self-discovery and sexual
 awakening, however, may come with a price. What
 happens when the greatest love you've ever known
 forces you to face your greatest obstacle -- yourself?
