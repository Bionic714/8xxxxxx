,darkarson,2013-02-14T23:57Z,Guess this only enables Skirmish it seems
,DrTen,2013-02-15T00:27Z,"Like Darkarson said, it only enables Skirmish mode, and the developer hasn't made bots to play against (yet, it may be patched in later.) Sooo yeah, still can't play the game."
,john1912,2013-02-15T01:44Z,Should pull this as it doesnt work!
,nrcv,2013-02-15T02:36Z,"This does NOT work, its not even a crack made 3dm!
So ""darkarson"" is not only a stupid but also a lying cunt and you would be at a fault to download software uploaded by such a lying cunt."
,DrTen,2013-02-15T05:58Z,"@nrcv Did you even read the first comment here? He admitted it doesn't work fully. This was a scene release, it just doesn't fix everything yet."
,nrcv,2013-02-15T13:46Z,"@DrTen did you miss the title where is states its ""working""?

Its not working and as such he is lying, and slapping a scene group name to a *broken* p2p crack does not make it ""scene release"";

it makes the uploader a cunt and as I established already a lying one at that."
