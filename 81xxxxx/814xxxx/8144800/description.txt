Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site :: On the Thursday, February 14 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex analyzes the attempts by police to cover up their absurd razing of a cabin reportedly containing suspected murderer Christopher Dorner. Alex will also break down the push for tighter gun control in various states, marking the start of a larger agenda. 

Coming up today, Alex will have founder, editor and CEO of WND Joseph Farah to discuss several of the points Obama made in his State of the Union speech, the latest "watergate," and the complete economic takeover of the country.

Note: Dr. Corey Gold, a dentist affiliated with Youngevity is Alex's guest for most of hour 2 and the first segment of hour 3.
