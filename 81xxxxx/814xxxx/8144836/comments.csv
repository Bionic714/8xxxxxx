,highresjunkie,2013-03-08T20:37Z,This is only 18 minutes long.... why is it 1.83gigs? A full 2 hour movie in 1080 is smaller than this. This is six times bigger than it should be. Might wanna learn a thing or two about bitrates.

Yes, it's big for 18 minutes but I set Handbrake to constant quality RF=21.5 and this is what I got. I also tried other RF values but lower made it bigger without improving the video quality and I won't go higher than 21.5 for 1080p with any of my encodes since I want a sharp 1080p picture. I hope you enjoy the edit even though it's larger than you think it should be.
