By request, bsg4you is happy to present The Razor Flashbacks from Battlestar Galactica in a single 18minute 20second file formatted as a single episode. The source for this fanedit was the excellent Battlestar Galactica Blu-Ray set and used the 1080p/5.1 Razor (Unrated) movie and the 480p/2.0 Razor Flashbacks. Both the video and sound quality of the 480p Razor Flashbacks is much higher than The Resistance webisodes or the 360p deleted scenes from regular episodes. All of the Razor Flashbacks episodes 3, 4, 5, 6 and part of 7 are contained within the Razor (Unrated) movie which is 1080p with surround sound.

00.00-02.30 Razor Flashbacks episode1 480p
02.30-04.54 Razor Flashbacks episode2 480p
04.54-15.07 Razor (Unrated) 1080p
15.07-18.20 Razor Flashbacks episode7 480p

Episode7 only has 1minute 17 seconds of content, the rest is credits and the hilarious R&D TV stinger at the very end:
15.07-16.25 Razor Flashbacks episode7 flash forward to Galactica's decommissioning
16.25-18.15 Razor Flashbacks credits
18.15-18.20 R&D TV stinger with David saying "me, me, me ..." and Ron pushing his stomach in and saying "big head"

Changes:
* hid the "TO BE CONTINUED" text overlays and removed the associated sound effects at the end of episode 1 and episode 2
* removed the episode 2 establishing shot of an exterior zoom into Galactica
* left the very funny R&D stinger from the very end of episode 7 after the credits; this R&D stinger wasn't used at the end of any normal episodes so it's a bit of an Easter Egg

Note:
The webisodes are stereo 2.0 and the Razor (Unrated) material is surround 5.1. The final file is mastered as 5.1 and the sound levels sound about right with sound speakers but listening with just stereo speakers might make the Flashbacks sound a bit louder. If the video player has a speaker setting, be sure to set it to 2.0 if you only have stereo speakers.
