This is a set of tools and functions for managing licensing, deploying, and activating Microsoft Office and Windows. All output from these functions is displayed in the Information Console. All functions are run in the background and the GUI is disabled to prevent running multiple functions, as they could conflict or cause damage if run concurrently. The Microsoft Office Setup Customization Functions (Customize Setup Tab), AutoKMS Uninstaller (if AutoKMS is installed), AutoRearm Uninstaller (if AutoRearm is installed), Office Uninstaller and Product Key Checker work even if Microsoft Office or Windows is not installed/supported. For information about individual functions, read further.

    Requirements:
    Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0 or 4.5 (Not 3.5)
    Microsoft Office 2010 or Later for Office Toolkit Support
    Windows Vista or Later for Windows Toolkit Support

You can "thank" the post if this toolkit helped you. Please leave the questions to the person who uploaded or post a reply in the forum if you are pretty sure there is a bug.
Please do NOT PM CODYQX4, the guy who made the toolkit. His box fills fast and he cannot possibly answer everyone's questions.
