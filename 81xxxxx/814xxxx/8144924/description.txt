Aberzen - Books 1 - 4 [English]

For lovers of Myst, Dungeons & Dragons, Cerebus and The Hobbit, comes The Quest for Aberzen - something fresh in fantasy graphic novesl. Three heroes - intrepid, curious and idiotic -- join forces to reach the centre of an alien world. Their fate rests in their ability to conquer the deadly secrets that await them.

The art is beautiful and this comic is something different from the norm. Seems to be an independent translation as only Book one seems to be available in English elsewhere and has a slightly different translation.
