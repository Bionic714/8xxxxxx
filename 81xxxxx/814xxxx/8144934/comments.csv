So what happens is this:
1) I install Office
2) I install KMSnano or toolkit (tried both)
3) When I run ""check KMSnano"" it shows that both Win7 and Office are activated. But after EXACTLY 24 hours, every time, it suddenly only shows that Win7 is activated and Office totally dissappears from the check. When I then try to start office it won't start, only office config runs. I even tried repairing the registry.
Why would Toolkit help if KMSnano is not helping? Isn't toolkit actually using KMS activation like KMSnano? Isn't my problem that I have Win 7 ULTIMATE, or does in not matter which windows you have as long as Office is volume licence?

Tnx!"
