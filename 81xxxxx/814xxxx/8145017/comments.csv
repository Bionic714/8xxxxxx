,john1912,2013-02-15T02:37Z,"""Fixed bug with the tablet. For unknown reasons, only works Skirmish modes, a campaign to work, although it works on the license. The case is again in the emulator TRIMS (steam_api.dll). Trying to find a rational solution.""

So campaign still does not work with this?"
,Deurbell,2013-02-15T02:37Z,"Thanks again for uploading, the update text is a bit unclear to me tho. Is the campaign working in this version or just the skirmish?"
[V],HeroMaster,2013-02-15T02:48Z,"Ok guys we did the best for the Crack fix but Campaign is still not working, the problem is the crack, it only works with Skirmish modes so play until a Proper one props up :)"

Oh no wait, you double suck since you posted this broken garbage TWO times..

Seriously who gave this bonebag a skull? 
(or can you buy those now?)"
,BluntzNzigzags,2013-02-15T04:11Z,it works. but yeah pretty boring with just skirmish..
,Name4677,2013-02-15T04:26Z,"When u say ""play until a proper one props up"" does that mean u arent going to make one????!!!!If that is the case then pls explain how u can crack triple A titles no prob but decide to give up on a good game like this? and i made this account just to say that."
,demmydemon,2013-02-15T05:45Z,"Are you guys high?
Most likely, HeroMaster has nothing to do with the cracking or whatever, and is just a distributor.
It may be broken, but how many times have we not downloaded uncracked shit to be ready when a crack-only release is available?

Anyway, this serves my needs great, as I only need to verify that it runs okay on my box before I buy the game.  If Paradox don't want to release a demo, this is the only way I can test it, and a broken crack won't stop that."

,ICManiac,2013-02-15T06:46Z,"I'm actually surprised to see this immature kids, acting up about a game that isn't supposed to be cracked, but it is supposed to BOUGHT, stop complaining to the cracking team, they're doing it out of their freewill for YOU GUYS, stop complaining and buy the game if you don't want to wait, what they're doing is even illegal, so shut up and appreciate what the team is doing for you. (:"
[V],HeroMaster,2013-02-15T06:55Z,"May be this might help you guys running the campaign, try it and make sure you corrected it:

You wanna play campaign with this game you wanna need to use this Aliens Colonial Marines steamapi.dll and steam_appid.txt; Use google and find tunngle Aliens Colonial Marines page and download ""mp-fix v2"" file And Greenluma also needed. Download Greenluma from cs.rin.ru. "
,DrTen,2013-02-15T08:28Z,"It looks like this game requires Steam Cloud for save files. Even if you own it, you cannot play in offline mode.

That's probably why there's a delay in a proper working crack, they need to crack the whole save procedure as well as the typical steam API!"
,YogyBear,2013-02-15T12:45Z,"I downloaded Aliens Colonial Marines files and got it running through GreenLuma, but I'm still getting redirected to skirmish when I click proceed  in campaign menu.
Guess we'll have to wait for another release."
,Guido Holmes,2013-02-15T12:58Z,Doesn't work.
,zarat88dds,2013-02-15T14:17Z,"It works perfectly.  Did as Hero said.  Found a torrent with just the Aliens Colonial steamapi.dll and steam_appid.txt, and stuck them in the Impire game folder.  Then googled and downloaded the mp-fix and moved those files to Impire as well.  Then downloaded Greenluma and moved all those files to overwrite the already installed Steam program directory. Ran Steam, logged in, then ran Impire, and the campaign is working perfectly.

,Archimonni,2013-02-15T14:33Z,"Thanks for the torrent! I hope you or someone else can manage to fix the problem, where we can't start campaign."
,Archimonni,2013-02-15T14:37Z,"@zarat88dds

Where did you find the torrent? Also, is greenluma safe to use?"
,Deurbell,2013-02-15T15:54Z,"Using Greenluma in combination with the steam files for AvP makes the game work, but still only skirmish. Using the Aliens mp crack fix files in combination with Greenluma, Impire does not launch at all.

Thanks again for the effort, guess I'll be waiting for a proper crack to finish (hopefully soon)."
,MadRevolver,2013-02-15T17:47Z,"Thanks HeroMaster! it works!
Also thanks to zarat88dds for confirming this! If you follow their instructions it works in campaign too."
,DrTen,2013-02-15T18:02Z,"For anyone looking into using GreenLuma, be VERY CAREFUL! If you fuck it up, you WILL get your legit Steam account banned.

Take the time to read through the tutorials on the forums on how to set up two Steam shortcuts so you don't have that happen."
,Arzanii,2013-02-15T18:15Z,How about you all just WAIT for a proper crack instead?
,JacksonHerrer,2013-02-15T18:50Z,"too late, bought the damn thing, and im loving it, its worth the 20 euro's ! "
,Archimonni,2013-02-15T18:54Z,But.. but.. That could take whole weekend. We can't simply live without crack for this game! D:
,DrTen,2013-02-15T21:24Z,"I am so close to buying the game, but I'm afraid this is going to be another Dungeons. I'm not expecting Dungeon Keeper 3, but Dungeons was an awful selection of game design choices.

At least with a crack I can try the game out, since there's no demo. Videos never give me a good enough impression."
,undenied13,2013-02-15T22:17Z,"I also got it to work in campaign mode. I downloaded mp-fix v2 from tungle's page then copied the files in the game folder and downloaded greenluma and copied to steam folder.  Thanks for the advice HeroMaster. 

Regarding the actual gameplay... it ok, but not brilliant. It looks like dungeon keeper but it doesn't have it's spirit: the monsters can be directly controlled and have no needs except food, the atmosphere is more cartoonish rather than dark and the room sizes are predefined. Long story short, it has no depth... but it's NOT that bad."
,DrTen,2013-02-16T07:18Z,"Ended up downloading the Fairlight version, and it works great. I was wary of modifying my legit Steam installation, since a Steam patch can invalidate GreenLuma from what I understand.

Loving the game so far. It's heavier on the combat control and lighter on the building than Dungeon Keeper, but it has lots of unique elements.

Gonna try a couple more campaign missions, but I'm pretty sure I'll be buying this."
