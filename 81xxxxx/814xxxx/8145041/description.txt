Tuning Your Guitar

Connections ΓÇô Your guitar should be connected to your sound cardΓÇÖs 
microphone input jack. 
You may need a quarter-inch to eighth-inch adapter plug to get your 
instrument cable to fit the soundcard input jack. If you are not using 
an electric guitar, or an acoustic pickup, a regular desktop microphone will also work. 
If using a desktop microphone you will probably need the soundboard to 
be within 12 inches of the microphone head for best results.
 
Input Level ΓÇô the center column shows an input energy indicator. 
Your input levels should be set so that a strong pluck will send the colored bar 
very near the top, but without hitting it. For more help with input 
level issues see ΓÇ£Troubleshooting Input LevelsΓÇ¥
 
 
Fine Tuning Indicator ΓÇô the box on the right hand side of the window 
is the Fine tuning indicator. The current note being played will show 
up in the upper left corner, and the current percent error will be 
shown in the upper right corner. 
The needle will display the current percent error as well.
