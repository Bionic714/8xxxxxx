,devil_3,2013-03-21T08:26Z,it is asking for a password.......fake torrent don't download this 
,JS_760,2013-03-27T04:05Z,"There is a file (.mp3) archived and password protected. Smart people will not DL this if they cannot see (extract) the files. To may people hide Trojans or adware. Up loader should not have locked the .zip
Sad cause there are only two 10.9 FL DLs on this site.. SMH"
,aspiratr7,2013-03-30T02:36Z,"Wow, I don't really see what y'all are complaining about? It works perfectly fine, and you are not supposed to extract it, just click on it and a menu will come up to install it. Many thanks for the upload and by the way this one is the Signature Edition guys."
,TalonsRazor,2013-03-30T04:55Z,"Hello there, I apologize for my ignorance: I Downloaded and upon finishing, it loaded and said it was a demo that I need to register?? Am I doing something wrong? What do you suggest I do, or is that what this is, a demo download. Thank you in advance for the help. "
,aspiratr7,2013-03-30T06:04Z,"@TalonsRazor Yeah you are definitely doing something wrong. I suggest you download it again. It should download as an exe. file. Just double click on it, it should open up a menu like the one shown on the picture above, install it from there then just run the crack.  "
,m0n0lyth,2013-04-06T01:07Z,Great up 2010Kaiser!  Thanks a ton.
,nnirv,2013-04-08T03:10Z,"when i click on the info tab, it tells me i cant access it... anybody know what to do?"
,star82girl,2013-04-08T08:40Z,"Omg... beautiful song, 2010kaiser. 
When I try to access the Info tab, I get an error message that says System Information can't open the .nfo file. I don't know what to do..."
,star82girl,2013-04-08T08:55Z,"Figured out the Info button problem!! 
https://forum.suprbay.org/wiki/index.php?title=NFO_files_%26_Readme%27s
I had to install DAMN NFO viewer."
,nnirv,2013-04-09T00:04Z,"@star82girl, appreciate that link....i was buggin lol"
,Powerman26,2013-04-11T02:32Z,I tried using DAMN INFO VIEWER and I still wasn't able to open the INFO tab. Can someone just quickly outline how to install this program. I just want to make sure I don't do anything stupid.
,hollisb,2013-04-15T01:05Z,What is the changelog from 10.0.0 to this version?
,buttsandcandy,2013-04-20T00:24Z,"Great torrent, had no problems with installing and whatnot
Fyi the song is Just Say Yes by Snow Patrol for anyone else who had no idea"
[V],2010kaiser,2013-04-24T02:35Z,"To everyone:

1. This is an .exe (Executable) installer. Not aRAR, NFO or anything fucking else.
2. There is no TROJAN in any hidden MP£ file. There is a soundtrack contained withing the installer and.., surprise surprise. It's an MP3 Audio file.
3. For future referance. You don't need any damn 3rd party software to open a .NFO file. It opens with notepad.!!
4. The sound track is Snow Patrol - Just Say Yes.

For anymore questions regarding this or any other of my torrents. You'll find a link to suprbay, the official support forum of The Pirate Bay in this, and ALL of my torrent descriptions.

And @JS_760,

If your one of ""the smart people"", then the rest of us are fucked!  Lol  ;-)"
