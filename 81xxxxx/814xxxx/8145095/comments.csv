,m3nt4t,2013-02-15T13:08Z,Do you have a 720 or 1080p version? My streets-ahead 8-core FX-8350 CPU laughs at puny SD files.
,BeachBeachBum,2013-02-15T23:09Z,Make sure you guys still support the show! We gotta keep this on our TV :)
,Durrani,2013-02-16T04:04Z,@ BeachBeachBum  - It wouldn't matter because they have already mentioned that this is the last season and so far ratings haven't been stellar for INCASE there is a case of a renewal.
,Kattekvinnen,2013-02-16T04:47Z,"@Durrani The number of viewrs has increased a alot! And the cast and the writers have clearly said that they want to make more, but it all depends if NBC let them continue. It's all about viewers, why would they cancel a show if it's popular??? "
,VLobster,2013-02-16T11:39Z,"Thanks for the up :)

If you live in the US please watch and recommend this show to all your firends!
