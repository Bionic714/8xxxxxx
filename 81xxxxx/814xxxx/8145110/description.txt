Storyline:
Samantha's life is going downhill fast. The fifteen-year-old has a crush on the most popular boy in school,
and the geekiest boy in school has a crush on her.
Her sister's getting married, and with all the excitement the rest of her family forgets her birthday!
Add all this to a pair of horrendously embarrassing grandparents, a foreign exchange student named Long Duc Dong,
and we have the makings of a hilarious journey into young womanhood.
