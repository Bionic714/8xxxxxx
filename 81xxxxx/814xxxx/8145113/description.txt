"Down the Rabbit Hole"

On the island, Damon has an ugly run-in with a 
Hunter named Vaughn, and realizes he is one of The 
Five. Stefan confesses his true feelings about the 
possibility of becoming human again to Elena. When 
a stunning new piece of information about the cure 
is suddenly revealed, it changes the stakes for 
everyone. Jeremy helps Bonnie recognize what is 
real and what is an illusion, and Shane is 
comforted by a woman from his past, Caitlin. Back 
in Mystic Falls, Caroline and Tyler find that their 
attempt to translate the code on the Hunter's Sword 
is futile without help from Klaus, who has his own 
reasons for solving the puzzle.
