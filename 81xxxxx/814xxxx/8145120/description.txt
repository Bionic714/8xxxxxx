Armed Madhouse: Who's Afraid of Osama Wolf?, China Floats, Bush Sinks, The Scheme to Steal '08,No Child's Behind Left, and Other Dispatches from the FrontLines of the Class W

PalastΓÇÖs old-style gum-shoe detective work to dig out the info on the War on Terror, greed- dripping schemes to seize little nations with lots of oil, the hidden program to steal the 2008 election, and the media biases that keep it unreported are the meat and bones of this BBC television reporterΓÇÖs new book. Armed Madhouse is illustrated with dozens of documents marked "secret" and "confidential" that have walked out of file cabinets and fallen into PalastΓÇÖs hands.
You wonΓÇÖt find Palast in The New York Times (except its bestseller list), but you will read his reports on the hottest Web sites worldwide, hear him regularly on Air America and the Pacifica radio networks, and see his stories reappearing as the basis for EminemΓÇÖs hit video "Mosh," Michael MooreΓÇÖs Fahrenheit 9/11, and sampled by a dozen of todayΓÇÖs top platinum rock artists.
