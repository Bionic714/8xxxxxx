"Strike"

It's a race against time for Hank Galliston 
after his wife, Laila, is abducted by the 
international terrorist "White Vincent". As 
the publisher of a paranormal enthusiast 
magazine, Modern Skeptic, Hank has spent his 
career debunking myths and investigating 
conspiracies. Now, seemingly out of nowhere, 
he is thrust into the middle of one of the 
biggest conspiracies in human history, 
sparked by his wife's discovery of an 
antique clock at a Brooklyn flea market -- a 
clock that possesses much more than the 
power to tell time. With help from FBI Agent 
Rebecca "Beck" Riley and his two young 
magazine staffers, Rachel and Arron, they 
set out on a journey to find Laila, but soon 
find their mission is much bigger than just 
saving one woman.
