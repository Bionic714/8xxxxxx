Immortal: one of the biggest and baddest stables in wrestling history, headed by three of the most infamous stable villains in the business- Hulk Hogan, Ric Flair, and Eric Bishof. When this group formed, they took one of wrestling's most famous good guys with them- the Charismatic Enigma, wrestling's free-spirited daredevil, Jeff Hardy. As shocking as the legdrop heard round the world, Jeff's crutch blasts to Angle and Anderson shocked the wrestling world. They lasted a year and a half before it all fell apart. Now, relive their rise and fall, from the formation at Bound For Glory 2010, to the final dissolution at Lockdown 2012, and every Pay-Per-View in between.
