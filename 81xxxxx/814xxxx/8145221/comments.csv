,mercury001,2013-02-15T08:20Z,is there any different between this and the WEBRIP version..? if yes please tell me....
,tflagger997,2013-02-16T00:40Z,"Yes.  With professional encoders (LOL, DIMENSION, etc.) size really does matter.  Since this has an additional 60MB the quality will be better.  It all depends the size of the screen you are going to watch it on, but for 1280x1024 you should not go any smaller than 260MB for a 40 minute show."
