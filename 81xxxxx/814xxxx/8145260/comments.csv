Know that I download videos directly onto a network hardrive, that I read directly from my TV. That means that with these rar downloads, I need to get them out of my network HD, decompress and upload back to the HD.
And for some episodes, they don't exist as 720p in other torrents.

I forgot to add: big thanks for the upload!
I'm still happier if you upload rar torrents than if you did not upload anything, of course."
