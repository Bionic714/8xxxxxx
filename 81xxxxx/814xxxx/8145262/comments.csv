Please see the section marked ""container"" and please stop making me go elsewhere for my torrents, thank you

""- Container must be MP4. """

,DarthTauri,2013-02-15T06:59Z,"I didnt download it, started to pull then noticed it was a container thats 4 times the size of an mp4 and doesnt work on my box... if i had the ability to encode this shit myself i wouldnt be looking for it here, would i?

I usually enjoy dimension encodes, they are fast and work great, but when you start changing the encodes with no rhyme or reason, I am going to say something... the scene calls for mp4s, and yet dimension is doing mkvs... the rules are in place to make sure the broadest audience can use the released files.

I am sick and tired of these ""do it yourself if you dont like it"" stance, I come here because I CANT do it myself and I count on a bit of normalcy in my downloads, its releases like this that piss me (and im sure others) off, im just the only one willing to say something instead of bending over and taking it."
