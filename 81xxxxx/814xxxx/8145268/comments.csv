,raees1200,2013-03-11T12:48Z,Thanks for the torrent! took me more than 5 days to download because of less seeders. now i'll seed it for 4 or 5 days @ 400-1000 KB/s speed
,JurgenK,2013-05-04T21:25Z,Too bad it's english audio... Guess I'll merge the japanese audio from another download with this one to see the movie in it's full glory.
