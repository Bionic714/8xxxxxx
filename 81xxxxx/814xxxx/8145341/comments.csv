,.Leto.,2013-02-15T06:40Z,Great episode but as far as I'm concerned it was ruined by all those stupid logos and advertisements for other shows. I had never seen so many of them!!! I hope there will be another 720p release because there's no way I'm going to keep this one.

It's more like standard HDTV....
Think about it...."
