Please see the section marked ""container"" and please stop making me go elsewhere for my torrents, thank you

""- Container must be MP4. """
,teddyox,2013-02-15T05:26Z,oh stop your bitchin'!! encode it yourself if its such a big deal!!!
,DarthTauri,2013-02-15T06:51Z,"Sorry, but I count on scene releases for my TV, dropped broadcast 3 years ago... encoders who dont follow the scene rules just piss me off.

Usually dimension can be counted on for a good release and I have no trouble playing them on my box, but lately they seem to be doing containers that my system doesnt like, so of course im going to say something."
,DarthTauri,2013-02-15T06:53Z,"lets not bring up the fact that this release is 4 times the size of the same encode in mp4 format thus increasing the time taken to download... 

instead of telling me to ""quit my bitchin"" why dont you look at the problem logically."
,CorgiL,2013-02-15T08:36Z,"DarthTauri, please correct me if I'm wrong, but your link is referring to SD releases.  This is the 720p release.

If you want the low resolution mp4 version, there is one.  https://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8145408/Glee_S04E14_HDTV_x264_LOL_mp4"
