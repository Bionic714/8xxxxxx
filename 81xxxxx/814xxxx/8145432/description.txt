.: Plot :.
"Scandal" is a new drama that centers on Olivia Pope (Kerry Washington), a former media relations consultant to the President who has the power to "fix" things for everyone. Now, she is on her own working for herself with a new law firm. However, as it always is, the past starts to come back into her life when slowly it is clear that her staff, who are specifically trained in fixing the lives of other people, can't seem to quite fix their own issues.

When Olivia is called to protect the president again, she and her firm need to look over all the evidence to try to squash the scandal before it hits mainstream media. This takes her on a journey to find the truth and cover it. Created by Shonda Rhimes (Grey's Anatomy) comes this new and fresh drama that focuses on the Scandals that hit Washington and the people who are employed to fix things before they get bad.
