I myself would not call Frank a dancing fool. But I am quite certain that the genius in Frank would feel honored. No words can describe his greatness (and importance). This Master of so many giants plays a difficult role in our Rock or better, music history. Mainly because not many people could understand what he was doing (himself included sometimes). People just want to enjoy (consume) music like it is candy. Franks music simply does not allow that.

I myself rather avoided his brutal musical expressions and playing it for others was asking for trouble. Same can be said about his film. However, Frank cannot be avoided and making his music (and ideas) more accessible I was forced to listen a bit more. Now, 35 years later I finally have some idea.

Frank was more a performer and musician then a singer (good though). So I included some life recordings (I hardly ever do) in which his talents really excelled. Judge for yourself and try to enjoy (and share, Frank would like that)
