I guess you're ironic!? Or how old are you? Like three or something ;-). I watched this one with my 4 year old son, and he liked it. "

,LFGD1978,2013-02-16T17:07Z,@reine12 I guess you are being an asshole? I don't like it when people like you disrespect someone that wrote something useful about the torrent. You are totally pointless (same as your comment).

,reine12,2013-02-18T13:18Z,"@LF...

I didn´t meen to disrespect anyone (note the ;-) in my comment. But anyway, exactly what is soo useful with the comment? I'f a movie is good or bad is offcourse up to the viewer to decide!? If I say that it was the worst movie I've ever seen, is that useful too????"
,EvilCorporateWhore,2013-02-19T02:26Z,"@reine12

Funny how you throw around the word irony(incorrectly i might add). You attack someone for stating their opinion on a movie, then argue with another commenter that users have a right to their own opinions? Hypocritical, much?

His post was useful in the fact that he rated the quality of the torrent and then offered his opinion. You offered nothing but insults... no matter how many smiley icons you put in your insult, it's still an insult. Yes, opinions are opinions, but when the majority of opinions tend to agree with one another, they become statistical... and useful. "
