"Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"

After discovering the truth behind
defiance, Fitz is still struggling to
figure out whom he can actually trust.
Meanwhile Olivia is trying to move on with
her life, and she meets a handsome
stranger, Jake Weston, who sparks her
interest. But when Fitz and Olivia are
forced to be in the same room again, real
sparks fly and things get heated. Back at
Pope & Associates, the team handles a new
case, and for the first time they're
working with David Rosen instead of
against him.
