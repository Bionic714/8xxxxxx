NOTE: I suggest downloading VLC Media Player to watch this release.  You can download it here:
     
http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html

A few important and simple keyboard shortcuts for VLC are:

Double click: Fullscreen
Spacebar: Play/Pause
V key: Enable/Disable/Change Subtitles.
G/H key: Subtitle Delay (-50ms/+50ms per tap)
J/K key: Audio Delay (-50ms/+50ms per tap

NOTE: English Subtitles (SDH) are on by default.  If you do not want them on, simply tap the V key in VLC or delete the Subtitles folder.

NOTE: These 45 minute episodes take four (4) hours each (@100% CPU) to encode using my out-dated Dual-Core Laptop (2.4GHz) w/ 4GB RAM.  It is the least you can do to say thanks for my hours of work and wear and tear on my laptop.  It would be much appreciated. :)

NOTE: I can encode and upload The Walking Dead Season 2 720p BluRay in a week or so if enough people request it.  It would include all 13 regular episodes + the 65 minute "Inside The Walking Dead/Making of The Walking Dead" episode.

NOTE: In case you are wondering about grain, it is like that in the source and the BluRays themself.  The show was shot on 16mm film stock, which is the cause of the grain.  Google "grain the walking dead" for more info.

NOTE: Two 30 second samples are included for your viewing pleasure.

NOTE: I do not have constant Internet access, so this upload may take a few days.  Please be patient!
