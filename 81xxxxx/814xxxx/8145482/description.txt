Urbanity album by Hank Jones was released Sep 23, 1997 on the Verve label. Pianist Hank Jones' first LP consists of six piano solos from 1947 and four trio numbers (with guitarist Johnny Smith and bassist Ray Brown) from 1953. Urbanity music CDs This CD reissue from 1997 has all of that music, plus numerous alternate takes and false starts on a pair of the 1953 Jones originals ("Things Are So Pretty In the Spring" and "Thad's Pad"). Urbanity songs Particularly on the unaccompanied solos, Hank Jones shows off the influence of Art Tatum, while the trio cuts are more boppish and sometimes recall the King Cole Trio. Urbanity album Excellent music, although the added alternates (the many stop-and-start versions of "Things" go on for over 14 minutes) can get a bit tedious at times.
