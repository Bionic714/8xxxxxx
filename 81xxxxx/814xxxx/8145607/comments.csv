,MrJohnnyQuid,2013-02-15T08:33Z,"Simple shit really, it's a Youtube rip off their channel with a minor length edit, some proper tagging & an appropriate cover to complete it before he even had the chance to post it on iTunes."
,jonkirkpatrick,2013-02-15T17:11Z,It was posted on iTunes 45 minutes before it even came out on Youtube......
,MrJohnnyQuid,2013-02-16T03:20Z,Not in my time zone.
,Little_Nerd,2013-03-11T04:12Z,It could use the right album art as well as the lyrics tagged to it. Its also really quiet. I had to throw it into goldwave to turn it up.
