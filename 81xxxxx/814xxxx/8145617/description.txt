Rick Braun (born July 6, 1955 in Allentown, Pennsylvania) is a smooth jazz trumpet player and multi-instrumentalist. [1]
Braun attended the Eastman School of Music,[when?] and while a student there became a member of a jazz-fusion band, Auracle. Before embarking on a solo career, Braun got his start by playing in several bands, working as a session musician. Some of the artists with whom he recorded include guitarist Jeff Golub's Avenue Blue. He also collaborated with saxophonist Boney James on a remake of the Hugh Masekela's "Grazing in the Grass."
Braun also performs in the band BWB, with saxophonist Kirk Whalum and guitarist Norman Brown. In 2005, he and saxophonist Richard Elliot co-founded ARTizen Music Group (now known as Artistry Music). One of his influences was Freddie Hubbard, and Braun composed a song, "Freddie Was Here" in 2008, which he recorded on his album, All it Takes, in tribute to Hubbard, who died that year.
