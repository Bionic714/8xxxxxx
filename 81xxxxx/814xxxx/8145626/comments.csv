,missJiaLi,2013-03-27T02:36Z,"Thank you so much for this Krosis!! I needed to reinstall Windows 7 and had lost my disk during a move, but THANKFULLY i had my COA on stuck to the bottom of my laptop!! ^^

Now, to everyone else, what you need to do is go download ""ISO Image Burner 1.1"" on Softpedia, and then use that software to burn the ISO file from this torrent, to a DVD disk and WALA!

IT'S WORTH REPEATING WHAT KROSIS SAID HOWEVER;
This does NOT come with a crack or product key, so if you haven't purchased Windows 7, or a product key, you're only going to have an OS for 30 days. Me, I had to my COA/Product Key from my original purchase of Windows 7 years back, so I was able to activate this, but if you don't have a product key, you're SOL after a 30 day trial period."

,freris6991,2013-04-21T16:12Z,"This maybe a noobish question,but will my windows be genuine if I use the key on the sticker of my pc? Will my windows still be genuine if I install the antipiracy updates?"

If you have a sticker with a key on it, then you have a legitimate key that can be used to activate and will pass any test, assuming you install the same version on the sticker. (there are a few exceptions, mainly involving third party refurbished computers)

Thanks for this, my computer never came with a dvd and my old iso got corrupted."
