,tajammata,2013-02-16T00:34Z,Has anyone experienced problems installing this?
,schubert664,2013-03-08T20:52Z,"At first, clicking Setup.exe didn't work so I used Troubleshoot compatibility of Windows and the result is ""The specified path does not contain a valid program. Please select a valid program (ending with .exe)."" So I renamed it to Setup.exe.exe and it worked, I installed this application successfully. Thanks for this tiny but very useful application, very useful for Windows with System Restore problems."
