Please don't post direct download links.

We try to keep this site clear of fakes and malware.  Although the links you're posting might be to genuine, non-infected files, we can't check everyone so we just don't allow them, period.  

We are a torrent site, not an index for cyberlockers (even our own).

Thanks, and keep up the good work."
