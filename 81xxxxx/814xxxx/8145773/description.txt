Compiled by myself with various resources. This contains a metric shitload of musical resources. It contains a lot of books on music theory, jazz improv, guitar theory, etc. It has some sheet music and tabs from various bands, including Nirvana, Iron Maiden, Metallica, Pink Floyd and others. It also has a collection of real books/fake books, some video game sheet music, and some classical scores as well.

It has Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, Rachmaninoff, Grieg, Handel, Wagner, Vivaldi, Sibelius, and Tchaikovsky. All recognizable songs, if you're a active classical fan.

The video game music comes from Pokemon, Legend of Zelda, Super Mario, and even a little Metroid.

The rock song books are from the following artists:
Beatles
Foo Fighters
Iron Maiden
Jimi Hendrix
Led Zeppelin
Metallica
Nirvana
Pink Floyd
Radiohead
Red Hot Chili Peppers
Van Halen

Some of the song books have instrumentation, others have just tabs.

The Real Book collection is amazing. Enough said.

The theory books have really helped me personally when I was first starting out, and some of the more advanced stuff continues to help me.

Remember to seed, please!
