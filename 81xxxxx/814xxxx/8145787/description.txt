The album consists of two CDs, one with eighteen short pieces recorded in the
studio, the other one with six longer live improvisations. And that concept is
a very lucky one, because it shows the artists' breadth of range in the short
pieces, the quantity of things they have to tell and offer, like a rich menu
with lots of different choices, whereas the live setting gives them time to
explore the ideas, to structure the improvisation and expand on them. On one
track of the first CD Fujii plays accordion and Kihlstedt trumpet violin, which
offers additional variation.

Out of this huge musical baggage and technical skills, their only ambition here
is to create something entirely new, never heard before, tearing to pieces what
they've heard before, but lovingly, and reconstructing it into something
entirely different, full of red-hot passion and intensity, sometimes dissonant
or atonal, yet sometimes very melancholy and accessible, or joyful and fun, or
fresh and light, or full of drama and gravity, and especially on the second CD,
you get a mix of it all...
