Someone has also noted that using different language and region causes problems with this new method. You can either change to en-us for activation, or try using a different activator for now. Ex: kmsnano v25."

One question, is it possible to upgrade existing KMSNano activation to this new KMSPico?"

,vidyarathne,2013-02-15T18:15Z,Works ! Thanks
[V],murphy78,2013-02-15T21:13Z,"@kabir, I don't believe I said anything about permanent.

@supanut yes you can just run the runtrigger.cmd from either of these. The task name for the triggerkms call is the same, so it will use the new one. You can uninstall the old one or delete the folder after that, depending which version you have."
