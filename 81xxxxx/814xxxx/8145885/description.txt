2nd one is my personal repack using all of the settings from heldigard's
release except the kmseldi /music call. If the star-trek sound effects
are your thing, go ahead and use the normal release. NoSound version
is a little faster because it doesn't wait on the sound to finish.

KMSpico is an Offline KMS Activator that emulates a KMS server in the memory of
your computer and sends activation data back and forth attempting to activate
volume versions of Windows and Office. Heldigard has built on CODYQX4's
amazing work from MS Toolkit 2.4 where mikmik38 and CODYQX4 made an emulated
KMS activation program without the use of a Virtual Machine.

KMSnano was GREAT. KMSpico is even BETTER, SMALLER, FASTER.
You should always check for the latest version before using.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Activates:
Windows Vista Business/Enterprise Default/N/VL
Windows 7 Pro/Enterprise Default/N/VL
Windows 8 Pro/Enterprise Default/N/VL
Windows Server Std/Data 2008/2008R2/2012
Office/OfficeVL 2010/2013.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------Please read this non-KMS Windows versions list-------
Retail-Only Versions of windows that will **NOT** activate are:
Vista Starter/Homebasic/Homepremium/Ultimate - Default/N/E
7 Starter/Homebasic/Homepremium/Ultimate - Default/N/E
8 core/coreN/ProWMC
----------Again, those versions will NEVER activate with KMSpico---
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Requirements: . NET 4.0 or Windows 8

Instructions:

1. Extract the zip file to a directory. Make it a good one if you want to install.
2. RunTrigger.cmd will install the program to re-activate when you log on with 30
days or less on your 180-day KMS activation left. If you just want to do a
one-time activation, just run the corresponding kmspico exe file.
3. The NoSound activation is about 3 seconds, I think the sound ver is like 10ish
(It takes longer for Retail to VL Office 2013 conversion)
4. Done. Go about your business.

For Windows 8, it can take a minute or two of doing system things for the
watermark to go away. You don't need to reboot. Activators that require
a reboot are hacks and you should immediately run a "SFC /SCANNOW" if
you have used one. (SFC is the System File Checker) Esp. KJ Hacktivator
You CAN reboot if you want to, it's just not necessary for activation.

Note that Pre-Release versions of Office or Windows will NEVER activate.
I highly recommend just getting a proper release. I have tons of them.

Why use this program over any other activation method?
-It does not modify any of your system files.
-Because it's not a crack or a hack.
-Because it's the only way to get legit activation without using legit servers.
-Did I mention it activates ALL KMS activation software?

Change Log from KMSnano v25:
-No more Virtual Machine, and activation speeds are EXTREMELY fast now.
You can thank CODYQX4 and mikmik38 for the super fast non-vm activation method.
heldigard is the champ behind being able to use their new method and support
conversions from retail methods. I'm sure CODYQX4 most certainly COULD do it,
it just hasn't been done for his AutoKMS method yet.

All is Done (for now).

Recommendations:

- Disable SmartScreen.
- Disable Microsoft Security Updates.
- Make exceptions to KMSpico.exe in Antivirus.

(murphy-says: Allow kmseldi.exe through a/v protection when it pops up for
run-time protection if you downloaded an a/v update. Make sure you Pre-Screen
any KB files you download. It's very possible MS will patch localhost KMS
activations or somehow verify existing ones with a Genuine-type patch.)

If you bug anyone at MDL, bug me before heldigard please. His primary language
is not English, and I, or many others in the KMS Host and Tools v3.0 thread
can help you just fine.

(Big Salute to heldigard and all the peeps who contributed to this project)
Personal comment to heldigard: Nice damn job on adopting this for conversion!
