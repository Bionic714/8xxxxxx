,ognjen90,2013-02-15T13:35Z,"torrent is stuck at 68.5 % for all peers,any clue whats with the torrent?"
,AnonymousBasterd,2013-02-15T13:55Z,"@ognjen90

Yeah, I'm one of you guys stuck at 68.5%. Seeders and the uploader himself is missing... Lol."
,nicklas1015,2013-02-15T14:40Z,"FUCKING FAKE!

THE TORRENTS SEEDS IS GONE!"
,Machine4578,2013-02-15T14:54Z,"@nicklas1015

if its fake then explain to me how i have been playing OFFLINE all morning... you idiot!!!

THIS IS 100% real..
Ubisoft relesased an offline patch today.. so by using steam006's uplay crack or the modified ownership file, you can finally play!!!!!!!!!!!"
,dandalis,2013-02-15T15:08Z,"just get AC Assault Horizon, hawx sucks"
,RMJ113,2013-02-15T15:43Z,"I only need the crack, I have had the game for years"
[V],Gh0stNet,2013-02-15T16:03Z,ok here is the crack you guys have been requesting for  http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8146923  and sorry for the slow download 
,nicklas1015,2013-02-15T16:26Z,"I didnt mean fake as in Fake... BUT ITS STUCK ON 93%!!!
NO SEEDERS!"
,fusselrolle,2013-02-15T18:55Z,fake fake
,ognjen90,2013-02-15T21:08Z,"ok i have a problem here,i am stuck at the uplay log in screen and i cant do anything here. I changed in options the Offline mode but still when i press log in it says something about that you need online activation. Anyone had these problem?"
,hellboundsx,2013-02-15T21:18Z,"Its not fake, either way its a piece of sh*t game :/"
,hellboundsx,2013-02-15T21:19Z,"ognjen90
You first have to login with uplay online then you can go offline"
,whateverthefuck,2013-02-15T22:34Z,"WARNING! You still need a ""Uplay account"" to start the game, otherwise you can't even start the game! Uploader should have mentioned this in the description."
,whateverthefuck,2013-02-15T22:39Z,What an UTTER waste of time and bandwidth this download has proven to be.
,whateverthefuck,2013-02-15T22:46Z,"This uplay shit is a lot worse than that ""games for windows"" thing, because at least that allowed you to opt for a local offline account. This PoS says, first you make an online account and THEN I'll let you go offline. I mean it is because of stupid shit like this that I would want to play pirated games, but if a pirated game still has this shit attached then what the fuck is the point? Saving a measly 10 dollars?"
,Tiba021,2013-02-15T23:19Z,"Ok, so i installed the game, updated it, cracked it. I start the game, and uplay comes on, and starts updating... And it does that indefinitely... It simply doesn't end. Any one know any fix for this?"
,ognjen90,2013-02-15T23:33Z,"I dont get this uplay shit,i cant create account or what ever.....fck it this game isnt worth my nerves."
[V],Gh0stNet,2013-02-16T14:35Z,"Here is a simple noob friendly method to play this game So don't use the crack included within the iso as it is not working as of now .

1. Mount/burn.
2. Install the game.
3. Install Update 1.01 from the /Update folder.
4. make a uplay account.and log in for first time
and then go to setting and tick always offline.
5.Download offline patch + ownership file for the game from here http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8146923/H.A.W.X.2_Crack.Only-BlackEcho
5.Copy in to Ubisoft Game Launcher folder. Rename cache/ownership file to your custom profile ID. Make it read only.
6.Play.
If still you have any problem then you did some thing wrong "
,KomisCZ1,2013-02-16T16:36Z,"Not really sure whats wrong here, installed and patched it, created the account, went offline, closed uplay, copied ""crack"", renamed ownership file and made read-only (done same with the ""ownership"" folder) launched the game just to meet the same results(game is greyed out in the list and it wants to go online if I do that it wants key if I enter anything/nothing it still says invalid)
Any ideas what might be wrong here?"
,KomisCZ1,2013-02-16T16:48Z,"One does not even see their own comments here???? (not sure if thats ""feature"" of TPB or what)"
[V],Gh0stNet,2013-02-16T18:05Z,"@KomisCZ1  :-
don't know whats wrong with your uplay but if u need support then go to cs.rin.ru and people will help u there just be polite "
,SuperFulcrum,2013-02-16T19:39Z,"@Gh0stNet
im sorry but i dont get it,i mounted,installed,updated to 1.01 thats included,made an uplay account,logged in then ticked start always in offline,closed uplay,puted everything from crack folder in ubisoft game launcher file,started it in offline and when i start the game uplay says activate later and does nothing or activate online so i press activate online   and then i go to the cd key and when i press ok it says this cd-key or activation is not valid please try again. i would appreciate any help from anybody because i have been waiting for this game for a long time"

,FieroGT,2013-02-18T17:34Z,"hey guys, i installed this and did everything and it was ok, worked fine. then played 8 or so missions, and then had to quit right at the mission where u are in control of the uav, and some other guy contacts to separately. now when i load up game and hit continue, it starts a movie, where that Russian operative  is standing there after the dam blew, then suddenly quits back to main menu... i cant continue!! any ideas? i cant even see where to start a new game.. :("
,Anassuosa,2013-04-26T14:02Z,"Copy the random file name created by uplay to the clipboard, Ok so would some one tell me where the fuck is the Goddamn Clipboard so I could copy the fucking file, and thank you and sorry for my rage."
[M],Gargravar,2013-04-26T19:47Z,Anassuosa: Use the god damn fucking notepad in accessories you ragged son of a goat
