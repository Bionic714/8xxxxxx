Artists often want to share a vision of world peace through their music, yet many independent musicians fail to do this without sounding saccharine and contrived. Xcultures entry into this arena, One World One People, succeeds fairly well, bringing together voice and New Age synth sounds with modern 4/4 beats and ethnic instrumentation. Unlike other artists Xcultures doesn't sound too terribly cheesy, mixing West African drumming with Moroccan chanting, Scottish low whistle with Senegalese vocals. Make no mistake, this is still New Age music with panpipes and thick synth, but Brian Wayy's vision has a dark ethereal aspect that takes itself seriously. Therefore, it resembles the work of Deep Forest while transcending the squeaky clean sound of Adiemus. One-third of the royalties from the CD's sales will be donated to combat world hunger. A decent world-groove CD with fat beats. --Karen K. Hugg
