,Duffa96,2013-03-11T08:09Z,"Honestly, this is one of the greatest Death Metal cd's I have heard in a while. The new drummer lives up to Mike Smith's standards, very well done. 9.5/10 from me. Go support the artist and buy it."

Go get some merch or the CD! As soon as I get paid I'm picking this shit up, it's RIDICULOUSLY good.

Usually you think bands that have been around as long as these guys start to ""lose it"", kind of like Metallica with St Anger, but Suffocation keeps getting better.

Hobbs wrote some insane riffs for this album, it's nuts! So good!"
