Storyline: Rentâ™s a bitch. And that is why, six months after her best friend went missing, Amanda (Katie Cassidy, TVâ™s Arrow) finally gives in to getting another roommate, Hailey (Tracy Spiridakos, TVâ™s Revolution). The two college students turn out to have something in common, however: abusive men. For Hailey, itâ™s her dad (Donal Logue, Silent Night). For Amanda, itâ™s a stalkery ex-boyfriend. But problems can solved and, you know, you scratch my back, I scratch yours. In other words, Kill for Me, I kill for you.
