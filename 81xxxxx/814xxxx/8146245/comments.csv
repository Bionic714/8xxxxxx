,s1raz1,2013-02-17T08:50Z,"Thx for upload this update works fine.
 If u r new , u just need to xtract files then copy and replace to Program Files (x86)/DMC Devil May Cry then most likely run 1.0 to 1.2 and it will update fine.
Still no arena :/ .. beggars cant be choosers :P"
,Wrex1,2013-02-18T19:47Z,"Another shitty .bat updater, this crap never works for me it always errors."
,Lord-Darkstorn,2013-02-19T08:16Z,Didn't work for me and I followed the instructions many times. Just got errors when I tried to run the bat file v1.0 to 1.2
,PaulRTX,2013-02-19T22:38Z,"Works great with Black Box release, thanks Gh0stNet."
,bluerobins,2013-02-21T03:38Z,"You have to edit the .bat file and add these two lines at the top.

@setlocal enableextensions
@cd /d ""%~dp0""

Then when you place them in the game folder run the batch file as a admin and it should fix the issues."
,Crimsong,2013-02-21T05:35Z,"I still dont understand how it works like i keep getting errors.

,CapnBin,2013-02-21T10:30Z,i just figure out my mistakes! use 7 zip not winrar to extract the files! no error and clean extract.
,Wywy83,2013-02-21T14:18Z,"Can't update, it tells me it isn't a valid Win32 application."

,omega_jss,2013-02-22T08:50Z,"i don't know, it doesn't seem obvious... IS IT CRACKED?"
,Skrotorian,2013-02-23T04:34Z,Does this require Update 1?
,saboture,2013-02-23T06:14Z,"Had to reinstall. 

Took ownership of everything in my capcom folder. Tried running updater from c/downloads, no dice. Moved updater files into DmC folder (top of directory) tried to update, gave errors and deleted files necessary to run again. Unzipped AGAIN and moved all updater files into Binary/win32/ and tried to run from there. Same thing, errors and no dice. Manually tried to install files into appropriate folder locations. No dice again. Thanks for the upload but it's not working for me. Batch files are too unpredictable.  "

,Furious1964,2013-02-24T22:38Z,I tried this with MR. Stifmeister's update and the game crashed. Does your Update 1 have all the DLCs?
,Jack_ryder_2013,2013-02-25T10:37Z,"This screwed up my game also, i installed it and after awhile the game just crashed all the time randomly, the bat files also gave me noting but access is denied errors so this is not working properly i hope there will be a working version found so i can play bloody palace "
,Jack_ryder_2013,2013-02-25T18:35Z,I got it to work! i had to give permessions to each file that was giving the .bat file an error now i can play bloody palace mode it may slow down a time or 2 wich i think is because of a missing texture file but otherwise i got up to level 30 and even played it in stereo 3d so it can be made to work 
,Mr_Spoon_N_Fork,2013-02-25T21:18Z,Bat file gives location errors instead of looking in the directory it's looking in system 32 for the files even with the files in system 32 it still gave errors.
,Santy46,2013-02-27T19:23Z,"For those using windows 8 and getting errors:
1.go to properties of the .patch files(found in game folder after extraction) and edit their security by giving full control to all the users.
2.open properties of the xdelta3 file and check run as   admin in compatability tab and edit its security also giving full control to all the users.
3.run the .bat file

,zachshaun,2013-03-06T22:09Z,"Just to say how it worked here after some hours...
Copy the bat file:
DMC.v1.0_to_v1.2.Update
or
DMC.v1.1_to_v1.2.Update
right click and edit(outside the folder otherwise it will not work)
add this 2 lines on top of the file:

@setlocal enableextensions
@cd /d ""%~dp0""

now save it and move to the folder with the patch files.
Now the important thing:
Right Click the bat file and select RUN AS ADM

Now it will work!!!"

Is it possible for you to upload update 3 for this game, please... :-)"
,BenReeves,2013-05-11T23:07Z,"oh yeah works perfect for me and im playing Vergil's Downfall thanks for the torrent

just extract the download in game directory and run ""DMC.v1.0_to_v1.2.Update.bat"" then run DMC and play"
,cherrydee,2013-05-28T19:05Z,"Ok so after 4hrs of installing and uninstalling i got this working

1. download the 3 torrent (update 2-p2p, properDLC-p2p, and vergil's downfall)

2. go to safe mode

3. extract the update 2-p2p using 7zip. copy and paste the contents to DMC folder. 

4. cut the patch 1.0-1.2 and paste on your desktop.  open it with notepad and type 
@setlocal enableextensions
@cd /d ""%~dp0""
on the topmost of the codes then save

5. cut the file again and paste it back to DMC folder.

6. run the update and it should work

7. extract the proper DLC. you should get 2 folders. paste it on DMC folder and allow to merge.

8. mount the vergil's downfall ISO. extract it anywhere. then after that, go to that folder and you should see devilgame/published/content/vergildownfall. cut that and paste to your DMC/devilgame/published/content folder

9. copy the vergil's downfall crack files and paste it on your DMC/binary/win32 folder. open steamrld and be sure to have:

DLC001=229080
DLC002=223792
DLC003=223793
DLC003=223790

DONE!"
