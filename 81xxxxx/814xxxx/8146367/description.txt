Teorex Inpaint 5.0:
===================

Magically Remove Elements From Your Photos!

Inpaint will magically fill the selected area with intelligently-generated textures pulled from the surrounding image data.



How It Works:
=============

Inpaint photo restoration software reconstructs the selected image area from the pixels near the area boundary. Remove
undesirable objects from your images, such as logos, watermarks, power lines, people, text or any other undesired artefacts.
There's no need to manually go through messing around with your old clone tool any more! Now you can use Inpaint to easily
remove all those unexpected objects that end up spoiling an otherwise really great photograph.
