what?"
,altern822,2013-02-28T18:09Z,"It's Identity thief 2013.  it's still in theaters so the only kind of download available right now is the dark, blurry, hand held video camera, inside the theater kind.

It's worth the wait : )"

,Mazohyst,2013-04-27T02:51Z,It does have sound but it's so incredibly low. I had to turn it up to 200% on VLC and turn my headset all the way up to be able to hear anything at all.
