,lyinggreeneyes,2013-02-15T18:53Z,are you a trusted source?
,bigfatgrits,2013-02-15T19:08Z,I don't have a skull yet because I only recently started uploading stuff if that is what you mean. I am real though. lol You can read the comments on my other torrents and nobody has said anything bad. :)
,mikeike65,2013-02-15T19:09Z,@lyinggreeneyes Do you see a skull by his name? Stop asking stupid fucking questions and just download the damn thing and find out for yourself. If not move along.

,thundercat123,2013-02-16T04:45Z,"the qualify is pretty awful on this, will seed but won't watch, waiting on better quality."
,Ryzoz,2013-02-17T00:39Z,"Terrible quality, but thanks anyway."
,kirstikirst1,2013-02-18T00:35Z,Really bad quality but thanks anyway
,bigfatgrits,2013-02-18T01:34Z,"First of all I would like to say thank you to everyone who has helped me seed my torrents and also to those who have taken the time to comment. Positive or negative, you did take the time to comment and not everyone does that, so thank you.

In regards to the quality of the video & the file extensions of the video files I am sharing :

1. I DO state in the description what the file type is and I have also been very upfront that these files are NOT of a great quality.

2. As far as the file types/extensions go, the program I am using to record has chosen either the .flv type or the other one chooses .wmv. I am not experienced in all things encoding or really know much about converting something without making the quality poorer then it already is. I myself am ok with the file types it records in. They play in VLC media player and that's all I could ask for. If you want .mp4 or something perhaps you know how to convert and can do that so you can watch it in that format. I don't have time to sit and fiddle and learn how to convert into all these formats that are more popular. 

3. I have only recently learned how to record these shows from live streams. I intended to record them for myself and then thought perhaps I would share and give something back to the community that has shared with me for so long. I am not intending to be the next eztv or whomever. I just simply thought I would share a few files in case there was anyone out there like myself who wanted to see these shows but maybe doesn't have a lot of bandwidth and is ok with the quality not being top notch or doesn't mind seeing Jenelle Evans every facial expression not in high definition. lol

The gist of it is I really am just trying to give something to this community. I've never been anything but honest about the quality of my files. Either you are OK with that and willing to download or you're willing to wait for someone to share a better quality video. It's up to you! Either way have fun and share, share, share! :)"
,erinial,2013-02-18T07:01Z,"thank you lostinmyhope, might not be the best quality but it's not that bad either :)"
,lyinggreeneyes,2013-02-18T21:03Z,"great job @lostinmyhope

basically 2/3 years ago i downloaded a torrent of teen mom and i got a severe virus on my computer , it never really fixed i even re installed windows a few times and it was never the same 

some nasty person attached a virus to the teen mom torrent because they dont like that other people like crap tv shows 

anyways i like the show and thanks for your effort and upload , you can see now why i was a lil hesitant ........ soz hope you gets a sKull Soon "
,bigfatgrits,2013-02-19T04:01Z,I understand completely lyinggreeneyes! Thankfully I've never gotten any virus or anything from anything I downloaded. I know I do try to stay clear of torrents that are .rar'd and they are not trusted uploaders. Those kinda torrents always make me super wary I'm always suspicious someone has put something in the file! so I getcha! No worries. :) It never hurts to ask. :)
,nebulizer,2013-02-19T06:14Z,"Thanks for uploading this, I've been trying to watch it on mtv's website but it keeps buffering. It doesn't really matter if it's the best quality as long as I can watch it haha"
,nebulizer,2013-02-19T06:15Z,"ps fuck all of ya'll who won't watch it because of the quality, go buy cable if you're going to be a snob"
,bigfatgrits,2013-02-19T16:59Z,Thanks nebulizer! :)
,shellbee,2013-03-11T10:22Z,"I just registered after 160 downloads to tell you bigfatgrits, I have watched and was disgusted at the quality, I couldnt view full size because it was so pixelated and the sync was out.

To above I am not a snob, I have cable but live out side US ...

Lesson learnt I WILL ALWAYS READ THE DESCRIPTION from now on ..."
