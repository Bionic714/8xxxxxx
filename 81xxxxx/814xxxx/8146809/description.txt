The Swinger (2012)

James and Lily are a nice couple from the country in a bit of a sexual rut. When James gets called down to the big city to work at a fancy law firm, the two decide to see if L.A. can spice up their sex lives. But James' new boss, India, is much more than a sharp, power-hungry authoritarian. With eyes on the new guy and his sporty wife, she devises to send them off in a devious goose-chases of self-discovery, ultimately leading them back to her secret world where swinging is more than an amusing pastime. Directed by James Avalon and produced by Sweet Sinner, The Swinger guarantees the marriage of quality drama and passion.
