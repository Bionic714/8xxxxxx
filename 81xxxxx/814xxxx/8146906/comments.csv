,mt_phile,2013-02-15T16:24Z,Is this the version narrated by David Attenborough or the American re-dub by Forest Whitaker?

I got this off Newshosting the other day, and yes it is David Attenborough narrating."
,mike953100,2013-02-16T04:58Z,"I have only seen the first episode, but this is amazing.  Wow is all I have to say.  The video quality is absolutely phenomenal.  Then again 2.65GB for a 58 minute episode better give you good quality.  

Definitely

In the first episode there is an amazing fight scene between two male giraffes and some unprecedented footage of rhinoceroses at night.  Overall, this is a must-see, and I am very much looking forward to watching the other episodes in the near future."
