,markus8555,2013-02-19T12:00Z,"I would be very grateful if you added commentaries aswell. 

Other than that, awesome work!"
,col2k3,2013-02-24T04:27Z,"I love that this episodes are ripped so the filesize fits a single layer DVD. Is there a chance you can do Season 1 too? The only high quality Season 1 BDRip goes just above the DVD filesize (some are 5.5, some just 4.9) making it a bitch to burn."
,sean2e1958,2013-02-24T06:44Z,Great Quality but took me a week to get... Ill seed as much as I can but I only have 1MBps upload..  I got a Season 1 rip at 104GB and These are 90% the quality... Will test 5.1 soon as I don't have a set up here.
