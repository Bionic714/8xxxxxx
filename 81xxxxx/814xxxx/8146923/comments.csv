,Stefanovics,2013-02-15T20:48Z,No crack for this 2009 game just some emulators that work or dont
,Machine4578,2013-02-15T21:54Z,"all you need is the 12byte modded ownership file and the latest uplay launcher... ubisoft gave us everything else to play this game.. there is no crack needed.. 
1.install the game 
2.rename the modded ownership file to your serial in the 
program files (x86)_Ubisoft game launcher_cache_ownership folder(make it read only!!! or it will be deleted when the UGL updates)
3.run the uplay.exe to get the newest uplay launcher
4.start the game .exe and the uplay launcher will open, then click play!!
(this is basicallyhe same method used when AC3 first came out)"
,chrisroberts3,2013-02-15T23:08Z,"It still does not work. It asks for CD key to activate, a simple hit OK only gives invalid code. Please make a working crack for this game "
,ognjen90,2013-02-15T23:18Z,What serial do i put in the ownership file?
,Machine4578,2013-02-16T00:20Z,"@ognjen90

in the cache_ownership folder you should have a file there already... it consists of numbers and letters, that is your ownership serial (or id).. backup your file and use the file ""Rename_to_your_Profile_ID"" from this torrent and rename it to your file!!
NOTE: you must make the renamed file READ ONLY!!!"
,RedPointyBunny,2013-02-16T03:33Z,"@Machine4578

i dont have that cache_ownership folder after install ubisoft launcher n the game.. only Data and some others in it.. but no cache_ownership folder.."
,RedPointyBunny,2013-02-16T03:50Z,"Im able to get in game, but after i click New Story, then it going back to Main menu.. i cant even start the game.."

,JagonEye,2013-02-20T06:10Z,"Ok i got it working!
First of all THANKS THANKS THANKS THANKS.............(INFINITELY) Gh0stNet and BLACK ECHO LOVE YOU VERY MUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I'M POSTING PROPER INSRTRUCTIONS IN NEXT COMMENT!"
,JagonEye,2013-02-20T06:36Z,"OK HERE'S THE CLEAN INSTRUCTIONS:
1.Install the game with original setup i.e.the one that was released 3 years ago(don't remember exactly) or any other uploaded later than that.
KEEP YOUR NET ON WHEN IT INSTALLS.
2.After installation your browser will open automatically ubisoft's web site.If it doesn't then google out the site and make a new account.
3.The OWNERSHIP FOLDER IS NOT YET CREATED.So don't mess with that now.
After creating a new account log out if logged in(from ur web browser).Now STILL KEEP UR NET ON.DOUBLE CLICK HAWX2.EXE.
4.It'll start updation UPLAY after completion it'll ask you to login.So now enter email or username and password of ur account created earlier and login.And your uplay account opens.
Now search for settings on the page and go in it.
Tick ALWAYS OFFLINE option.
5.Close UPLAY directly.Now copy the folder 21 from DATA folder in the crack to data folder in C:ProgFiles(x86)Ubisoftdata.Once done check
C:ProgFiles(x86)Ubisoft has OWNERSHIP folder
created.Go in the folder and there will be a file named with mixed nos and aplhabets.Move that file for safety to some other location.Copy the file name before moving.
6.Now open ownership folder in the crack and you have a file name Rename_To_Your_ID.Now rename this file with the mixed name file you moved earlier.Now paste this file in C:ProgFiles(x86)Ubisoftownership
if it asks to copy and replace then click yes.
UR ONE STEP NOW FROM PALYING.
7.Now SWITCH YOU INTERNET OFF.
Click hawx2.exe and if you ticked the always offline option properly as before then uplay account will be opened and u'll see the PLAY OPTION besides HAWX icon.PRESTO UR DONE!
IF you are not seeing play button then login again wid ur net AND check to see if ALWAYS OFFLINE option is ticked.If any prob then ur free to tell guys.THis is as simple as possible i could tell in my words!ENJOY!AND LOVE YOU HACKERS!"
,ashishrane,2013-05-15T07:27Z,Thanks Gh0stNet. I just followed your instructions and the game works fine without any problem. Hats off to you bro.:)
