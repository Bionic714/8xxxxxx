,Mikilos98,2013-02-26T11:31Z,"I'm getting mad at all the torrents I downloaded. None of them are working, including this one, but I am hoping I did something wrong here. Please help: First of all, there is only ""check update game"" button, so I pressed that one, it updated something in another window, after it was finished, there is only a ""request generation"" button, no ""QUERY"". So I pressed that one. Doesn't work. ""Generation is impossible. Wrong version or generation client.dll already made?!?"" So when I turn on the game, it shuts itself down. Help?"
