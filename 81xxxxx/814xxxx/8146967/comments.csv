,slasherman,2013-03-15T12:56Z,"to change the laguage. Find the launcher file in  BmGame-config-launcher. Then

- Edit Launcher.ini located in batmanBmGameConfig folder
- Search for [Launcher.CultureMap] section
- Put a semi-colon before each line in this section except ""default=Int"" and ""en=Int"". This section should now looks like:
Code:
default=Int
en=Int
;fr=Fra
;it=Ita
;de=Deu
;es=Esn
;es-MX=Esm

1- Install game
2- Copy files in crack folder, which can be downloaded here

3- You need to edit the userengine.ini & Launcher.ini files. Their locations and what to edit can be found here

,mahigitam,2013-04-30T20:59Z,"""No disc inserted.

It worked for me friends. You need to use the crack to avoid the above error. You can download the crack uploaded by RELOADED. And then do the changes as said above by user ""slasherman"" @2013-03-15 12:56 CET. 

I guess you also need to go to DocumentsSquare EnixBatman Arkham Asylum GOTYBmGameConfig and edit userengine.ini file.

Change Language=RUS to Language=Int. You are done. Enjoy the game."
