i lost over 600GB of storage on my HDD drive

i lost everything that was in my 'Movies', 'TV Shows' folders on my harddrive.

all my pawn stars, hardcore pawn, cajun, king hill, 70s show, all my 720p movies, all my movies, everything.......:'(

it was over 600GB of stuff"
[V],psspss,2013-02-15T22:52Z,"is that all I lost prob 10tb in a 6 mont period

now i have easy 25tb - half for backup

the other half on live media server 
cos drives are always dying every 2-3 years

also friends prob have most of the stuff they dont downloAD JUST LEECH of me but always handy for remote backups

who needs cloud


after all 1.5tb of docus

and 2tb of paranormal

alone andf none are 720p that are too big and costly in space"

HOW bad is it/// hhd regenerator 2012 might do the trick and put drive in a bag in feeezer for 12 hours may work long enough to copy stuff of it t a new drive

was it usb or internal.. sometimes the usb interface dies and just replacing the case which cost $20 for a usb2 one will fix it

if its a small laptop drive 2""5 they can last much longer then the big ones at double the price

also handy if you have big quakes on weekly basis shaking the house and pcs

Ive lost much gear in last 3 years cos of quakes and comes out of pocket the replacements too"
