Anuranan 2006 Hindi 1CD DVDRip Esubs Xvid MP3 Phantom

Rahul, a creative and sensitive individual, arrives at a lonely hill station in Sikkim to help build a new holiday resort. The friendship between the two couples, Rahul and Nandita and Amit and Preeti, paves the way for a deeper bond between Rahul and Preeti. Towards the end of the movie, this "anuranan" between the two is misunderstood by society, including Amit. This misunderstanding intensifies when Rahul suddenly dies, leaving Nandita lonely. The fact that the love between Rahul and Nandita was pure does not prevent Nandita from falling prey to the rumors as well. All the four main characters are depicted as lost and lonely.
