  A couple years after breaking up, Screeching Weasel returned with a new lineup, a new sound, and an album that would influence seemingly a million imitators. Labeled as their big comeback album, My Brain Hurts has a poppier, more mature sound rather than the teen angst-ridden thrash-pop these guys were known for on their previous two records. And with their best-known songs here -- like "Guest List," "Kamala's Too Nice," and their "I Can See Clearly" cover -- My Brain Hurts was the album that would eventually define the Screeching Weasel sound for the remainder of their careers.
