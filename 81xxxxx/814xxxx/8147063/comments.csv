,Interpol5,2013-02-16T01:12Z,"This is a terrific movie, even if you're not a huge fan of The Shining. Saw it at Toronto. I'm sure this is a great copy, but I think I'll wait for something half the size. I just don't have 4 gigs to burn on one movie. "
,inkyon,2013-02-16T02:34Z,"I want to see it, but I need english subtitle for it."
,ANONisDED,2013-02-16T03:19Z,I have been searching TPB every day for a month to see if this was uploaded yet. Thanks God it's finally here.
,inkyon,2013-02-16T11:51Z,anybody know where to find english subtitle?
,spiceworm,2013-02-16T21:40Z,I badly want this movie but does 3.88GB will take a serious chunk out of my download limit. I'll hold on for a smaller version.
,ANONisDED,2013-02-17T05:49Z,Christ this movie was disappointing.
,rzrthrone,2013-02-21T06:55Z,"Quality as advertised...real screener at 1080p...
The morons talking about subtitles are full of shit since it doesnt need subtitles...10/10 quality...interesting sort of take on the hidden meanings in The Shining...

If you have any problems playing this video, you lost the internetz. Power off your computer and never return."
,inkyon,2013-02-24T04:15Z,"The morons talking about subtitles are full of shit since it doesnt need subtitles

You are an inconsiderate moron! I'm asking for an English subtitle so I can enjoy the movie because I cannot hear and I pretty much have to rely on the subtitle to enjoy what you called it, ""interesting sort of take on the hidden meanings in The Shining."" You douchebag."
,BostonAl2012,2013-03-05T04:03Z,A smaller version would be nice my machine locks up when I try to play large files at 1080p~anyone got a smaller file for this one~what I'm seeing is 2 only both at 1080 p and 3+ gigs~ty for the ul none the less! :)

,philliusmcgraw,2013-03-24T04:01Z,"a bigger load of rubbish, I have yet to see"
,grendelkhan69,2013-03-27T02:42Z,Thank you PublicHD!!! I've been postponing a viewing of The Shining until I could have this and the appropriate things to consume during the viewing. You've made my week!!
