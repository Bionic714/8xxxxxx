This is all the ambient/background/instrumental music from Fallout 3, by Inon Zur. Most of the file name are the same as they were in Data/Music, except finale/battle_01.mp3 has been changed to finale_battle_01.mp3 and so on to avoid a namespace collision with the existing battle_01.mp3.

This collection has a few files that aren't included with the official soundtrack, and there are plenty of torrents already that share the radio music.
