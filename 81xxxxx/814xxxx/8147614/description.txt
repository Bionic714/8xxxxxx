My all time favorite dark comedy. The scene with the baby has me in tears 

laughing. I feel bad that I'm just now sharing this. I've had the DVD for years, 

but MS hit me and kept me from this important task. If anyone wants an iso file of 

the whole disk, leave a comment and I'll put it up. I'd especially like to see a 

comment from jericho_cane that he has gotten a good copy of this must see, must 

own, must share film. 


I also have a copy of "The Fruit Machine 1988" aka "Wonderland" with Robbie 

Coltrane imdb.com/title/tt0095183/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1. Hard to find gay interest 

film. Leave a comment if you want it.



Andy Warhol's BAD:

Hazel runs a beauty salon out of her house, but makes extra money by providing 

ruthless women to do hit jobs. K.T. is a parasite, and contacts Hazel looking for 

work when he runs out of money. She is reluctant to use him for a hit, since she 

prefers using women, but decides to try him on a trial basis. Meanwhile, the local 

cop she pays off wants an arrest to make it look like he's actually doing his job, 

but she doesn't want to sacrifice any of her "associates." Several other side 

plots are woven in, populated with characters from the sleazy side of life.
