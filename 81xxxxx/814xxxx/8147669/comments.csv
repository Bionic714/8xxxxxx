[V],murphy78,2013-02-16T08:40Z,"jacob, I'm sorry... It was a knee-jerk reaction to reading that chicken scratch.

The reason I upload so many Windows versions is that I include the latest updates integrated into them every month.  Some people like having a quality windows version to re-install from when they need to.  There are a lot of people who try to help out, but tend to just include things they personally enjoy.

I try to just include security updates, internet explorer updates, .NET updates, maybe some directx updates.  I avoid putting non-microsoft stuff in my releases, and I think a lot of people appreciate it.  It doesn't really seem worth downloading them if you never re-install and re-download them.  If you install them on family and friends' computers often, as many of us do, you can really get tired of trying to update computers.

I personally get tired of trying to help a certain family member of mine who still has dialup.  It's really annoying trying to update a system on dialup.

So, yah, they're updated every month with security patches and such; that's why."

,jwats1973,2013-05-07T14:59Z,"So I just bought my daughter a new ultra book with a preinstalled trial version of office 2013, will this work for me? On start up it asked me to provide a serial or begin trial, neither of which I have done thus far.  I have tried activating on these preinstalled versions before with cracks without any luck. If not, can the trial be removed without leaving any traces behind preventing me from installing one from scratch? Any help is much appreciated."
