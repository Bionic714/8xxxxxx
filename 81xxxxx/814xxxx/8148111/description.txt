You may know of a story called ROMEO & JULIET by Bill Shakespeare- a tragic ditty about two star- crossed lover? Yeah, well this one's called JULIET & ROMEO, and while it has more than its share of star-crossed (and sex crazed) lovers, it lacks all the boo-hoo tragedy stuff of its predecessor. Instead, a happy ending befalls our exquisite cast of twlve, but only after they partake in no less than eight delightfully sinful situations that wil leave you with a smile on your face... and a stain in your shorts. Now that's romantic.
