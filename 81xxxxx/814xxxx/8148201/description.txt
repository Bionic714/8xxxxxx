No IMDB on this. It's a hard subbed documentary about trains!


Documentary on the everyday life of the crew of the train from Tokyo to Northern Japan, their return and the country they cross.

In 1962, the service schedule of the National Railways became increasingly congested due to transport of materials and Shinkansen deployment in preparation for the Olympics, and intensified labor schedules were imposed. On May 2 of that year a major accident occurred at Mikawashima. In order to wipe away the bad impression of the accident, the JNR authorities planned a film to promote the safety of the railways. The film traces a day in the life of an engineer┬üs assistant.
