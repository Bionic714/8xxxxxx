 - Includes Creatures of the Night DLC"
,DrTen,2013-02-16T00:40Z,"Nice job! Are the save files working alright? The legit version only saves via Steam Cloud, with offline players often losing data."
,ljstorm,2013-02-16T00:42Z,fixes only works Skirmish modes ?
,Lockjaw664,2013-02-16T01:02Z,Does the campaign work with this crack?
,dubesor,2013-02-16T01:05Z,is this the proper full game with the campaign? 
,DrTen,2013-02-16T01:11Z,"I'll let you know in 3 hours, but Skidrow normally does a good job checking their cracks. I think the prior two attempts just checked if the game loaded -.-"
,jhonel83,2013-02-16T01:28Z,"I really hope this is the proper one. I looked up other stuff from the uploader, seems legit, fingers crossed :)"
,Fluid56,2013-02-16T01:52Z,"yeah, it only works with skirmish. it's just a cat-a-cat games copy of the other version. same thing, clicking ""proceed"" on campaign takes you to the skirmish lobby. 

if anyone figures out how to make the campaign work I'm sure we'd all be grateful, but as is with this if you download and install it, it won't launch the campaign. sends you automatically to skirmish lobby."
,Fluid56,2013-02-16T01:55Z,"posting this again cause my comment isn't showing up for whatever reason, clicking on ""proceed"" to start the campaign sends you straight to the skirmish lobby, same as if you clicked on skirmish. 

bummer. game does work otherwise just fine though."
,Fluid56,2013-02-16T01:56Z,"fuck, comment shows up just fine now. sorry for the double(triple) post."
,vigoman,2013-02-16T02:04Z,"just dowloaded and have the same problem than the other releases, ONLY SKIRMISH MODE

Going to try now the FTL release"
,Guido Holmes,2013-02-16T02:16Z,Doesn't work.
,jhonel83,2013-02-16T02:21Z,"it also sais ""beta multiplayer"" on some point. Any attempt to tinker with the graphics options also yelds an ""index out of bonds error"". If anything, this is worse then the other versions"
,Machine4578,2013-02-16T03:16Z,"@azaq318

LOL!!! SKIDROW??? WTF?? are you smoking something?? you have to be the WORST uploader with a skull in the history of TPB!!!"
,DrTen,2013-02-16T07:20Z,"Fairlight version works like a charm right out of the box. No downloading Steam bypassers or any craziness.

FYI, the full game shows ""Multiplayer Beta,"" too. The developers are actively working on patches to bring it to what they consider a full state."
,hollisb,2013-02-16T07:25Z,Here is the campaign crack for all who missed it - https://mega.co.nz/#!HwxxRDTb!cffXXBn_38AK7B4S21vaSidqQOoxAWbsVWFuGYckUgc

[V],azaq318,2013-02-16T09:58Z,"Guys, single campaign works here fine, as I now see it ""mp"" has some issues, you can easy solve them probably by just adding FLT crack separatly ...."
[V],azaq318,2013-02-16T10:05Z,"Proper Crack Only FLT here:

Have fun ;)"
,dubesor,2013-02-16T13:56Z,"Just tested, the crack works fine. I played campaign with it, and also the saves work"
,boomaye,2013-02-16T18:52Z,"Guys, i can confirm that downloading the crack hollisb posted will allow the campaign to work"
,maxg50,2013-02-17T15:34Z,hey anybody else is having really bad fps rates i started the game everything was fine and in the first 10 minutes it started going crazy i barely could move the mouse curser
,luxy10,2013-02-18T13:56Z,Wanna see gameplay?..search for Legolas4234 on youtube :)
,MicroBalls,2013-04-16T19:16Z,Skidrow is a fucking joke...All their releases have been with some lame ass cracks and workarounds. Looks like only 14 years old little boys are cracking for Skidrow these days.
