,Deurbell,2013-02-16T02:15Z,"Update: Thank you boys and girls from FLT and Stifmeister. This version worked for me, campaign launcher. Unpack, mount or burn, install and make sure to block the exe in your firewall and you are all set!

WORKING"
,PGMP1979,2013-02-16T02:47Z,Downloading and waiting for more confirmation :) i trust the uploader. But ill take a day to see if its healthy.
,DrTen,2013-02-16T03:01Z,Any chance we can get a crack for other copies? I'd rather not redownload it again. Got suckered into thinking the Skidrow release was any different from the other one that didn't work.
,BluntzNzigzags,2013-02-16T03:36Z,niceee. thank you
,vigoman,2013-02-16T03:46Z,working 100% so far (campaing and skirmish)
,Jayskater8,2013-02-16T03:47Z,How do you install this?
,hollisb,2013-02-16T03:51Z,I agree with DrTen.
,Laz36,2013-02-16T03:55Z,"Yep, this one works. Thanks!"
,giuluz,2013-02-16T04:30Z,is anybody else having problems in downloading this???
,bluelief,2013-02-16T04:43Z,"im gunna trust your crack for now, only cause i dont wanna wait with 30kb/s LOL"
,bluelief,2013-02-16T04:46Z,"the fix emilio posted works for the copy posted by heromaster, thanks! "
,Somniphobia,2013-02-16T04:56Z,Working perfectly for me so far. Saving works fine as well. Both campaign and skirmish are working.
,hollisb,2013-02-16T06:30Z,"emilio's crack works, just verifying"
,DrTen,2013-02-16T07:13Z,"I ended up redownloading this one after uninstalling the old one to be safe. Installed easily, plays great. Loving the game so far. It has a Dungeon Keeper vibe to it, though differing levels of depth in certain elements.

In general, you control combat a lot more by forming squads and moving them around, while the building is a little lighter. Rooms are preset sizes, and your Workers run them. Some of them constantly produce resources, others provide benefits for your attackers.

I'm going to play a few more campaign missions to be sure, but I think I'll be buying this game to support the devs."

 Bal-Abaddon has been torn from his throne of skulls and imprisoned  in  an
 earthly body of less-than-imposing stature (he's an Imp, OK?) to serve  the
 none-too-competent sorcerer Oscar van Fairweather.  But  unfortunately  for
 Fairweather, the luck of the damned is on Bal's side and  he  soon  breaks
 free to build his own dark and majestic... Impire

Take control the of demon Bal-Abaddon as he attempts to rebuild his mighty
 hell spawn form. With the aid of dozens of evil creatures big and small  as

 underworld of limitless evil and nastiness to stop all those  pesky  Heroes
 of Ardania from ruining his return to greatness

I decided to hold back my fury to write this so id apreciate a response thx."
,Militance,2013-02-16T17:40Z,
,Militance,2013-02-16T17:46Z,"nm...i figured it out, you have to manually choose the program to unpack this, thx m8, however its wierd that it doesnt open winrar when you click on one of the files, first time its ever happened to me."
,tatata77,2013-02-16T20:57Z,I am having problems with opening the context menu when try to get baal or one of his imps to do anything (rightclicking on an imp/Baal and holding the mousebutton down is supposed to open a contexdt menu)? anyone else getting this?

It's not as good as it should be.

You saved me 20 USD."
,Pumppu-Sepe97,2013-02-17T20:50Z,"Downloaded 2 times, both times files were corrupted. Feels batman."
,Deurbell,2013-02-17T21:57Z,"For people confused about the files, before being able to mount anything you will need to use Winrar (or a similair program) to open the files you have just downloaded (only have to open the first file, the extract will use the other files automaticly) and extract the contents. After you have done that you can mount the file you have extracted and install the game."
,tiz2,2013-02-18T11:55Z,Is this similar to Dungeon Keeper?
,luxy10,2013-02-18T13:55Z,Wanna see gameplay?..search for Legolas4234 on youtube :)
,Sir_Ver,2013-02-18T23:36Z,"HOW TO INSTALL : Some people might find this thing unfamiliar, so i'll show you how to install this.

*First, make sure you have winrar and iso mounter (or whatever you call that) i use Magiciso.

1. Right-click the filename ""flt-impr.001"" and click ""open with...""
2. A window will pop-up, select ""Select the program from a list""
3. Then search for WinRAR Archiver and select it.
4. You'll see a file named ""flt-impr.iso"" right-click and extract it to where you want.
5. And mount that shit using your magiciso (or any same software)
6. You'll know the rest."
,Sir_Ver,2013-02-18T23:39Z,"*edit* I use poweriso, not magiciso. but that one works too. IDK if you can use winrar to mount files?"
,d3nis10,2013-02-19T09:42Z,"I have a strange problem, every time i try to change the graphics or the resolution the game crashing and i don't know what to do, PLEASE HELP"
,lords43,2013-02-19T11:45Z,"@luxy10

,yuricon,2013-02-20T12:56Z,"@d3nis10
I had a same problem and its because I use an old monitor at 1024*768 and this game support 1280*720 at least. (I still can play at 1024 but it will freeze if I try to change any graphic options.)"
,Peecuts,2013-02-21T13:12Z,"Thanks for this mate, everything works fine :)"
,Ryukojin,2013-02-28T20:10Z,"game installed works without problems,but when i click on play it takes me to matchmaking lobby,how do i play campaign mode ? please help !"

,xanat0s,2013-03-01T21:58Z,@luxy10 nobody is going to look up your gay ass videos bro
,Foghog,2013-03-04T07:01Z,"For those whose game stops working and won;t let you do anything after a second in the game, not even summon imps/etc, try this workaround. I managed to get mine to work on almost all versions, by quickly saving the game before the guy stops talking or at the very very start of the chapter, and then it will confirm the save. then it will freeze, but when I restart, I load the game and it works fine for the whole chapter. just a thought if anyone is having the same problems as I."
,waterbong,2013-03-09T23:03Z,Game installs and plays fine.
,waterbong,2013-03-10T21:24Z,Scratch that.  Game does not save.  Tried four times now.  No auto saves going on and manual saves don't work.  When I load them back up it starts back at the beginning every time.
,redspeeder,2013-03-29T11:12Z,is there any way of playing coop or multiplayer?
