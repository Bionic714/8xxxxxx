On 10-NOV-2012 I uploaded a CD of the Oscar Peterson trio recorded live in

Ljubljana, Yugoslavia 29-JULY-1964


This upload includes additional tracks from the same concert.  These tracks are

from a (2) CD set (Holland)


More than a few of the tracks were mislabeled and at least (6) were duplicates.

I've deleted the duplicates as far as I could figure it out. The incorrect

track names made this a bit tedious.


In total I think there are (11) tracks here which weren't on the 10-NOV-2012

upload.....appx. (23) unique tracks total in both uploads


The sound isn't bad and the trio didn't disappoint.
