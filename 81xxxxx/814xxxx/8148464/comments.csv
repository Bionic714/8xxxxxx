,huxin91,2013-02-17T20:19Z,truncate or overburn is better?

,The1stRule,2013-02-17T22:35Z,"Works great using Burner Max, IHas - D, and Ritek discs "
[V],-wxm-,2013-02-17T22:57Z,"Get an IHAS burner, flash it with burnermax and burn the WHOLE .iso I honestly think #P_Greezy is just trolling and want u to waste as many CDs as possible"
,joaoeo,2013-02-17T23:14Z,@-wxm- I've seen many reports that truncate method is working as well without errors on campaign
[V],-wxm-,2013-02-18T02:08Z,"@joaoeo Truncate was always meant to be a temporary solution while modders developed a more suitable method to burn XGD3 games.  The discussion has been put to bed long ago, truncate will work on some games but not all of them. Alot of the newer games will have a IO checking feature and if the entire iso isn't burn the game will crash and boot u back to the dashboard.  It's better to burn with a Ihas and verbatims or invest in an xk3y but they're more expensive"
,punkfreak123,2013-02-18T07:19Z,"Not to mention if you overburn/truncate you are more likely to get flagged for a ban. Of course, if you don't care about playing online this doesn't matter"
,Sailor420,2013-02-18T12:41Z,"First NOT a noob .... 

This is one of the very few that I have had an issue with, keeps freezing, have to reboot console.
Going to download the RAR version and see if I have better success.
FYI: I run my games off portable HD via xK3y, I got tired of burning games via iHas."
,RedKassper,2013-02-18T14:22Z,"@punkfreak Overburn is overburn, truncate is truncate. You either overburn or truncate. I'm quite curious how you want to burn xdg3 game on DVD+R DL without overburn. You need an IHAS drive and Imgburn in order to be able to overburn correctly. 
Truncate is what you shoud not do as it may or may not work. "
,P_Greezy,2013-02-18T19:31Z,"@-wxm- This is the last time im goin to say this YOU DONT NEED IHAS! i have burned every xgd3 game using OVERBURN method and it works without any errors i have finished games with this method, its good if you dont play online, so i dont kno what your talkin about kid get your facts straight before you talk"
,DonnieHill618,2013-02-18T19:34Z,I also discovered burning truncate you may also run into problems not only game to game but also on a console to console basis. Your disc may work fine on your 360 and stop mid game on your friends. But I totally agree ihas or xk3y is the way to go. I prefer the x for its ability to use original firm ware and no more coasters. In the long run it is the best investment www.modchipcentral.com
,ChrisFoo,2013-02-18T22:33Z,"Works with iHAS Version D, BurnerMax Payload v0.15 and Verbatims :)"
,Panagiotis_1992,2013-02-18T22:53Z,"HI GUYS,CAN TELL ME ANYONE IF THE GAME PLAYS WITHOUT IHAS BURNER;WRITING ONLY WITH IMGBURN AND THE TRUNCATE METHOD WILL BE WORKING;THANKS!!!"

,lolipopus,2013-02-21T22:35Z,Why play crysis 3 on a fucking xbox?
,Fuqthegovt,2013-02-22T11:02Z,why play this on a fucking PC? what would you do if all the PC had was mmos? that's the way it's going. Simcity 5 is the latest example (crack it for offline and half the game is missing like Anno 2070)
,Clem360,2013-02-23T17:03Z,"soulking, not to be rude, but can you please check the region before uploading? i have slow internet and i waited for nothing. my console is ntsc j, therefore rendering the iso useless. please do this and also, can you find an ntsc j version for me? i can't find any torrents of it."

,ONEmar,2013-02-26T22:00Z,"WORKS GREAT!

LT +3.0
Used Burner Max V0.15 and burn with ImgBurn 2,4x 

Thanks Soulking77!"
,ClipperCigars,2013-02-27T09:30Z,"@ RedKassper. No, overburn is not overburn. The overburn that punkfreak123 speaks of is the standard overburn that every stock burner is capable of dependent on media and will not provide enough extra space to allow any XGD3 game to burned in full. This is quite different than C4E's burnermax overburning which is a whole custom write strategy and has little to do with overburning in the typical sense.

@everyone else. Quit your bitching about the uploader saying the game was region free. The NFO from the group that ripped it says RF. It's not the uploaders fault the rippers got it wrong. It's not the uploader's job to personally test every fucking thing. He's just running software for your convenience. Ungrateful whiny ass crybabys bitching about wasting their time. Here's a thought, go to the store and buy the fucking thing and you won't have any problems or waste your time or anything else. So shut the fuck up about free shit you are being given by others. "
,pulh4,2013-02-28T03:40Z,"IMA TEACH U WHINY BITCHAS HOW TO PLAY XGD3 WITH TRUNCATE METHOD  WITHOUT ANY NEED TO BUY AN  IHAS  BURNER BULLSHIT.
1- USE IMGBURN AND BURN THE DISC AT 2,4X SPEED USING TRUNCATE METHOD
2- GET AN MP3 FILE INTO UR XBOX, USE A USB STICK OR WATEVER, AND BEFORE LAUNCHING THE GAME PLAY THE FILE USING THE XBOX PLAYER
3- LAUNCH THE GAME , NEXT START THE GAME, NEXT PAUSE THE GAME, NEXT STOP THE MP3  FILE AND FINNALY GO BACK TO THE GAME 
AGAIN.
4- PLAY THE FUKIN GAME TILL UR CONSOLE EXPLODES WITHOUT NO MORE DISC UNRECONAZIBLE ERROR.
IT IS RECOMENDED TO INSTALL THE GAME TO THE HARDDRIVE.
U WELCOME"
