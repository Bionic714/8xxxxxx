In 1990, "This House" was a US pop/R&B hit by then-14-year-old Tracie Spencer. The song is now well over 20 years old, yet the record company still has only ever digitally released the LP versionΓÇöwhich wasn't even the one that was a hit. They no longer promote it and never offered it in a lossless format. Their incompetence and disinterest are your gain: Here's a lossless rip of a rare promotional CD maxi-single containing all the club & radio mixes of "This House".
