I usually watch all the movies at film.kbc44.com because they have HD's but they didn't have this one so im happy to have piratebay :) Thank you once again uploader for this great share!"

Go fuck off with your link.  There is no web site on Earth that has a movie that is not also on the pirate bay.  If it can be found there, it WILL be found here.  If it can't be found here, it WONT be found there!"

That is so much bullshit. Of course there are movies on other sites that are not here. I download some every day. Is ""Ride A Wild Pony"" here? No, well I downloaded it yesterday from another site.

But I will refrain from giving a link. That would not be right."
