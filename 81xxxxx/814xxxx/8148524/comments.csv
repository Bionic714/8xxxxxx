now that I look at it.. it's the same line-up as  an el-cheapo ""Pickwick"" records release.. I had the 8-track at one point.. same as ""Roots"" and dozens of other renamed lps and cds.. but  no hendrix.."
,PRM-BR,2013-02-16T07:51Z,"thanks for the info!

here's some information by charly holdings inc.:

""this collection of some of hendrix's earliest recordings, made whilst he was a member of sax-man lonnie youngblood's group in 1963, feature his evolving guitar sound and occasional vocals in a group context, three years before he was to front his own line-up and sow the seeds of modern rock music.""

i'm afraid i didn't write that information in the description, i've just started sending my own torrents. i've always leeched and seeded, now it's time to give back something from my own collection. :)"
