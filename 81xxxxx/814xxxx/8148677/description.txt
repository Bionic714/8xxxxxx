The second chapter in the saga of Los Hermanos Wacos, Cowboy in Flames is widely regarded as THE perfect marriage of punk, liquor and roots. It's a wicked little skunk tossed into the tent of bloated, corrupt excesses. Making good on their promise (or was that a threat??) of their first record, the Wacos deliver a slab brimming with grim romanticism, and joyous, near ecstatic, drunken stomps. Join the cause as they strip the fat and greasepaint off country music's carcass and build a pagan temple out of its bones.

In addition to anthemic (and we don't bandy that word around lightly) originals like "See Willy Fly By," the title track, "Take Me to the Fires," "Do What I Say," there are scalding versions of "White Lightning," "Wreck On The Highway," and "Big River." This baby's got more classics on it than Get Your Ya's Ya's Out. We think you'll agree--Cowboy In Flames is a sure tonic to wash the taste of disgust out of a parched nation's throat.
