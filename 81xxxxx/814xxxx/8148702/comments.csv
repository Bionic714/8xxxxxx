,muzk,2013-02-23T04:19Z,What's this about German characters? Over 1500 seeders and just 1 comment? Someone please elaborate.
,gh0timan,2013-03-07T04:37Z,"For starters, thanks for the great posts!  :-)

Episode 1 was OK as far as I remember, but Episode 2 has some German bits on-screen at 12:20 and 23:38.

Episode 3 has a whole texted conversation in German from 24:40 - 25:50.

I didn't note the times while watching, but when I skimmed the video, these jumped out at me.  I haven't watched the rest of them yet, but hope to soon.

Is there a ""fix"" for this?"
