Lux Aeterna is an album by guitarist Terje Rypdal recorded in 2000 and released on the ECM label

The Allmusic review by Thom Jurek awarded the album 4½ stars stating "There is nothing remotely cold about this work; it is warm and dark and stunning in its stark presentation that is so deceptively complex. By the time the fifth and title movement commences, the listener has been to many worlds within the sonorous terrains of the heart... Terje Rypdal is making the greatest music of his life".
