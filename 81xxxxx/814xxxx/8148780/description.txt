This is not the official Lucasfilm edit of the movie. This is a Fan Edit.

10 minutes have been cut from the original running time. Also the order of many scenes has been changed.

Some scenes have been put together to make a larger sequence to allow for a better dramatic experience. The original cut of the movie had too many cuts jumping from one scene to another, not allowing the
audience to focus.  

I wanted to make the movie feel better by rearranging scenes and cutting as little as possible. I'm especially pleased with the ending.
