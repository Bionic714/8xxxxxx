Roosevelt ΓÇ£baby faceΓÇ¥ WilletteΓÇÖs early background was in gospel piano but after taking up jazz organ he appeared on Blue Note LPs by Lou Donaldson and Grant Green before making albums of his own.

After recording a handful of sessions for Blue Note in the early ΓÇÿ60s (including two albums as a leader), organist Baby Face Willette abruptly left the label and soon resurfaced on Argo. Issued on the Argo label in 1964, these two albums are a prime example of soulful jazz organ from the time when funk was in its infancy. Both sets are further proof that if Willette hadnΓÇÖt been so underexposed, He certainly wouldnΓÇÖt be quite so underrated.
