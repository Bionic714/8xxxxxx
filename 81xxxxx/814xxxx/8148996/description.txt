A brand new mini series featuring the master of horror. My government is a kleptocracy, moderated by violence. My city is a sinking ship... all the waters of the world's corruption flowing into her, filling her belly, dragging her down into darkness and nothing. They say the law doesn't matter anymore. That it exists only to preserve the powers and the position of a lawless few.
