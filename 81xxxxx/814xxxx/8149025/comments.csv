[T],moman73,2013-02-16T17:01Z,"There are many views and definition to the Western Civilization, Western Culture, Western World. One of these vies consider the Western World as the lands that are dominated and controlled by Christianity. This definition works well with those concerned with the study of the history of the development of civilizations starting with the Greek Civ., followed by the Roman Civ., and the spread of Christianity that was the driving force behind the evolvemnent of the Western Civ. Here, all the lands that are dominated by Christian European colonists are part of the Western Civ., such as: the USA, Canada, and Australia.

Stalin was born and  raised in an Orthodox Christinan family. He also studied in an Orthodox Seminary school. Therefore, he is definitely a product of Christianity and a Western culture.
Of course, we know that he later became an athiest, and he oppressed all religions and prohibited their practice.

,antignor,2013-02-16T19:11Z,"But let me elaborate on this, because someone making relationships like this may otherwise not understand.

Western civilization is very critical and opposed to oppressive regimes and dictatorships and those are considered to be uncivilized by western civilization. Nowadays even to Christianity as it, in an extreme form, results in a theocracy. Western civilization is based on the ideas of enlightenment in which people are allowed, even encouraged, to think for themselves, express their thoughts (without getting punished for that) and being able to discuss those ideas.  

Any kind of oppressive regime, no matter what particular shape it emerges in or how you call it, can and does happen everywhere where humans are. Racism is not exclusive for westerners either.

So whatever kind of propaganda you like to make with this upload, it based on completely nothing at all and shows how little you seem to understand of the concept of what ""civilization"" means and of Western civilization in particular."
