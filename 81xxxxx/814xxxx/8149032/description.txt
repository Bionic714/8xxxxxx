Consisting of some beautiful standards such as Smoke Gets into Your Eyes, Star Dust, Sunflower, plus some terrific new pieces created by Yamamoto, the music and sonic excellence has definitely surpassed his last album.

Recorded in Tokyo in July of 2008. In DXD digital format, the details of the music are just awesome, the dynamics are scary and the musicality is so rich. This explains why extreme high definition is so important - once you've heard it, you cannot go back!
