And stop linking to others torrent moron!"
,highresjunkie,2013-02-19T09:20Z,"I just happened to download one of your torrents and I was impressed with the quality:size ratio, so I grabbed a few others you've encoded including this one and it's very nice work. You seem to have found the sweet spot in terms of picture quality and file size... most 1080's and 720's are much larger than yours, but there's no blocking or pixelation at all that I've seen, and you seem to be doing movies that aren't well represented in high resolution which is also very nice! Thanks for all the work. I'm sure it takes quite a bit of time to do these."
,moeburn1,2013-02-23T22:21Z,2mbps seems a little low for a 1080p...  hope you did 2 pass...
,jalucian,2013-02-25T03:31Z,"Comments I posted several days ago are no longer here, so I'm re-posting:

@anoXmous - That's not a ""better"" rip, it's not even comparable since that's 720p resolution and this is 1080p. The only reason you came over here and posted that comment is because you're butthurt because I pointed out that there was pixelation in your Extended Dances with Wolves torrent because your bitrates on some of your 1080ps are too low. The difference though, is that what I said was actually the truth, while you are being dishonest just because your ego was apparently bruised. It's very unbecoming. Don't come over to someone elses' torrents and be dishonest just because they made a completely valid criticism of your work.

And @moeburn1, keep in mind that my bitrates and file sizes are optimized for those who store and watch movies on their computers. The bitrates are high enough to look perfect on ""normal"" sized monitors and low enough to keep download times short and the file size small enough for those who keep large collections of movies on their hard drives. If you plan on watching something on a large HD screen, you're going to need one of the larger file size, higher bitrate torrents. The larger the screen you'll be watching on, the higher the bitrate has to be to maintain picture quality. If you have a large screen, you'll need to experiment too see what bitrate it takes to maintain a quality picture for you particular size screen. So yes, for computer viewing, 2000 is more than enough for a 1080p (YIFY, who is well known for extremely high quality encoding, has bitrates of around 1800-1900 on his 1080p's and they are flawless.) And yes, I always do 2-pass, uneven multi-hexagon motion estimation method, as well as several other ""tweaked"" settings that I will keep to myself. On a computer sized-monitor, I would put my work very close to, if not just as good as YIFY's."
,highresjunkie,2013-03-02T06:04Z,Maybe moeburn1 is used to XviD format. x264 only requires about 65% of the bitrate that XviD does.
,RogerRoger66,2013-03-09T16:20Z,"Great quality, thx for ther up m8"
,jalucian,2013-03-14T06:32Z,"By the way, anoXmous, I just took a look at your link, and anyone who knows much about encoding can see from the stats you listed that your claim is demonstrably untrue. First of all, your audio bitrate was horrific. Digital, or ""CD"" quality audio is 160kbps and yours was under 70kbps. Secondly, your video bitrate was 937kbps, which normally is good enough for most films shot on conventional media, but when you have a very grainy source like this (or Clerks, or Beasts of the Southern Wild which was shot on 16mm film) you have to use a higher bitrate because of the grain. If you don't, you end up with blocks and pixelation in dark scenes, which is what I saw on your encode of Dances with Wolves Extended, and probably is present on your version of this as well. So I'll say again, please don't come over here and dishonestly claim that you have superior quality when it's already been demonstrated that you don't, in multiple cases. 

For anyone who might prefer to have this in 720p instead of 1080p, here's the link to my 720p which doesn't suffer from bitrate problems like anoXmous' link:

,axprodigy1,2013-03-21T02:44Z,Finally someone understands encoding! Halelujah! Thanks for the upload my friend. After seeing the meme so damn many times I figured it's time to see the movie it came from.
,dyslexikchicken,2013-03-23T17:09Z,"^^ What axprodigy1 said. Not only are Jalucian's better than anoXmous' most of the time, but they're actually better than YIFY's as well. Slightly better video bitrates and significantly better audio bitrates. I even noticed that anoXmous, on his newer posts, seems to have upped his video bitrates to ""Jalucian standards."" lol They were a little on the low size up until recently. I don't know if that's coincidence or not, but I have a feeling it's not. Aint competition wonderful? "
,josh12689,2013-05-12T13:03Z,thanks!
,redxleaf,2013-05-23T05:32Z,"fine work. many thanks, Jalucian.  I'll seed as long as I can."
