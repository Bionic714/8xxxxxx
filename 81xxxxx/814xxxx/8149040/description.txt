Please seed for as long as possible. From what I have seen, there is only one other torrent of this in 1080p, and it was an outrageously and unnecessarily large 14.7gig - so as of this date, this is the only reasonably sized 1080p version of this movie out there. Please try and seed until reaching a share ratio of at least 3:1.
