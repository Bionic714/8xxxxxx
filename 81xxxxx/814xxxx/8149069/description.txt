Adam Carolla and Dennis Prager share the stage again in October 2012 for two shows, this time at PhiladelphiaΓÇÖs Kimmel Center and a return engagement at the Redondo Beach Performing Arts Center. This double album features just under four hours of thought provoking conversation as they discuss a wide array of topics including bullying, bumper stickers, the 2012 election and legality versus morality. Both shows also include audience Q&A, and no question is off limits.
