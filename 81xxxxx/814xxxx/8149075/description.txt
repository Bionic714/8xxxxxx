This album features the artistry of one if Japan's top pianist's. When asked about the title of this album, Tsuyoshi Yamamoto had this to say: "I wrote this piece especially for this album and dedicated it to Winston Ma, the producer. I asked Winston to name the song. After hearing the song, Winston said he was reminded of the emotions he felt when he first saw the skyline of Seattle during an Autumn visit to the city some years go." Hence the name. Let Tsuyoshi lead you to a warm and romantic dreamland through his enchanting piano performances.
