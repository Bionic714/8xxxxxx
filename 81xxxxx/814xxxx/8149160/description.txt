||				ABOUT:					||
||									||
||		UNPOPULAR is a lame P2P group. We have a few		||
||		drawbacks such as releasing late and in low quality.	||
||		We're in it for the fun and not to please you.		||
||									||
||		We're here to bring you shows the scene or P2P don't.	||
||		(even though the scene hates when you leech their	||
||		releases - we're just fascinated with them)		||
||									||
||		All caps are analogue and SD television unless stated.	||
