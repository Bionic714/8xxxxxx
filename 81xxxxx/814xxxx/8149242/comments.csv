I downloaded this torrent within hours of it been posted:

1)  Installation Instructions ARE in the INFO TAB.
2)  You click 'Instal' on the .SFX and it extracts. What P/W are you talking about.

The torrent worked flawlessly for me. 100%

Don't be spamming good torrents with stupid comments.

[H],UA-07,2013-04-04T22:44Z,"@txmedic There is no malware in my torrents, it's probably a false positive against Adobe Tool it's flagged by most AntiVirus programs as a ""Hack Tool"""
,m0nkeyvan,2013-04-24T18:47Z,"I am having problems using the Adobe Tool.  Every time I try to execute it this is what I get:

C:UsersToniaAppDataLocalTempir_ext_temp_2AutoPlayDocslua5.1.dll is either not designed to run on Window or it contains an error.  Thre installing the program again using the orginal installation media or contact your system administrator or the software vender for support.

Than it says:

Internal Protection Error, please contact author!

I don't know what I am doing wrong or how to fix it.  Please help!"
