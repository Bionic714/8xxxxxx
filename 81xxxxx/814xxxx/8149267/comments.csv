One thing I don't understand, in the image screen provided it says ""no updates,"" but in the text above it says updates installed until Feb 12.  Does the ""no updates"" mean ""no updates needed""?"
[V],murphy78,2013-02-17T01:38Z,"Sorry, some clarity then.
I installed this using audit mode, which you can switch to during install.
I then downloaded all the windows updates, installed .net 4.5, directx updates, etc.
Then I ran sysprep /generalize, which removes all my hardware specific stuff and Administrator username stuff from the registry.

I then rebooted to my other partition and deleted the left-over user/administrator files.
I then captured the image using imagex for use in the install dvd. I exported the original image to a different file, and re-mounted the image to add the OEM-branding stuff. I then exported the newly added OEM-image under a different name, to the existing one I just copied, so it now has both.

It's a little complicated, but basically it has all the updates up to the Feb12 patch date."

,Kamahl19,2013-03-07T15:13Z,"Hi, maybe I have a dumb question but I want to be sure. What is the difference between OEM and normal version except logos and brands? I see that OEM is activated, does it mean I can turn on Win updates? Is it possible also on normal version? Thanks for best Win7 torrent"
