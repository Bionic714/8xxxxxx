@ Decebal01
I don't know what media player you are using.
English subtitles are set to default if you use VLC media player. It's excellent - plays anything, even broken files."

These subtitles are synced to the framerate of this encoding of the film (23.976215 frames per second). If you have a film that is of the same framerate they should work for you.
