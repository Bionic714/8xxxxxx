What's in this version:
Note: There's a known problem with Restoring messages on some devices on Jelly Bean.
It seems to be caused by the internal process of adding new messages. Some users have reported that Restore after a Factory Reset has worked for them. I'm trying to find a work-around for this but haven't had much luck yet. Anyone with rooted a device having this issue and willing to help please contact me.
v5.99:
- More bug fixes, better error messages
- Added Vietnamese translation, thanks to Long Nguyen
