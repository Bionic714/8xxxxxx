Information
------------------------------

He's been dead for more than 5,000 years and probed by scientists for the last 20. Yet today, Otzi the Iceman, the famous mummified corpse pulled from a glacier in the Italian Alps nearly two decades ago, continues to keep many secrets. Now, a new autopsy yields fresh clues to his way of life and the mysterious circumstances of his murder. If he was a warrior or a hunter, what was he doing so high up in the mountains, armed with an unfinished bow and useless arrows? If he was fleeing for his life, why did he eat a big meal less than an hour before he was killed? Besides clues to this original "cold case," Otzi's frozen remains reveal intriguing details of his life and times in the ancient Copper Age. Join NOVA as we defrost the ultimate time capsule, the 5,000-year-old man.
