Known Issues:
* CM7 - All CM7 issues have been resolved, make sure you are running CM 7.0.2 or later. Early versions may still give you issues.
* Buglessbeast - This firmware mod does not seem to have proper support for the new Equalizer APIs at this time
* Sony Xperia Arc Media Player - Sony's Media Player force closes. This is a bug in Sony's app, we tried to workaround it but cannot. We contacted the developers about the issue. Until it is resolved we recommend you use a different media player.
* Amazon MP3 - Amazon's MP3 player force closes when you play a song. Amazon has the same bug in their app as the Sony app. We contacted the developers about the issue. Until it is resolved we recommend you use a different media player.
* HTC Desire HD / HTC EVO - People have reported intermittent issues with the stock gingerbread firmware on this device. Users who have replaced their firmware with the CyanogenMod ROM no longer have issues. We have worked around the issues to make it more robust. Force closes should be gone, background service still gets killed every now and then though, but it should start back up cleanly now.

What's in this version:
3.2.7
-Force close fix for some users when trying to contact developer
3.2.6
-Added shortcuts for equalizer on and off, can be used with Takser and Locale
-Auto on/off feature on supported players (Google Play Music and Meridian Mobile)
-Force close fixes for some devices and music players

                        No Unlock key needed.
