,OzSteve,2013-02-16T22:13Z,"dop082000 - This looks like a retail rip of the COMPLETE disc, so no side by side or over/under.

vonwisdom - this is the complete disc. BOZX has other rips that are smaller for you"
,deng.xiaoping,2013-02-17T07:06Z,"Great to see the full disc uploaded. But how can you play it back from your computer? I have a Mac, but could also use of PC if not possible on a Mac to play the full 3D Blu-ray."
,funkglorious1,2013-02-27T21:47Z,"Hey BOZX, can make an iso file of Silent Hill Revelation 3D? If you have it."
,electrond,2013-03-03T21:47Z,Anyone who knows a version of the movie that actually works? Been downloading 4 movies of Wreck it Ralph and all of them fail (locks) in the third chapter... Bozx thanks for all your uploads. Much appreciated!
,orkahhh,2013-03-08T12:38Z,"Perfect.
Full HD 3D no sbs or tb. Play on a 3D Beamer.
No error and no protection.
Tanks a lot."
,GMNavDisc2,2013-03-20T17:08Z,Mac users will have to download MakeMKV for this to work without burning to a disc
,waterbong,2013-06-04T23:02Z,After downloading 2GB and uploading 17GB I finally said screw it on this one.  Greedy fuckers.
