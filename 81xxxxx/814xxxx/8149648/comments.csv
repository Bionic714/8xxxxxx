,technoxy2,2013-02-16T16:38Z,"There audio -- sort of.

When I played this mp4 file using QuickTime, no audio appears.

When I use VLC to play the file, there is audio.

Go figure.

If need in mp4, then I recommend convert using Handbrake."

,Cygnus-x1b2,2013-02-16T22:00Z,"I can confirm audio troubles.  It runs under mplayer, but Plex will not play audio.  Ran it through avconv and it started working.  Don't know if its a bitrate problem or what."
