,Sysrec222,2013-02-17T19:50Z,"Hi,

please help all of us, can somebody upload these files:

* Enroute/db_a/store/appedoc_store_1.lock
* Enroute/db_a/store/appenr_store_1.lock
* Enroute/db_b/store/appedoc_store_1.lock
* Enroute/db_b/store/appenr_store_1.lock

In most of the torrents it is missing an that are the most important files. When these files are missing, the enroute page in JeppFD is blank. No enroute data is displayed.

Please upload somebody!!

Many thanx"

do it like in the Tutorial described @cycle 1303,1302 for IPAD. You may have to erase the app (JeppFD) but then it works. I'm actual using the 1303 and it works also without these files.

Maybe the files you named are files which are personalized by Apple/Jeppesen and so it wouldn't may a good idea to make them public.

Check the tutorial and it should work fine :) "

Hey man,

I appreciate your help very much. I followed exactly(!!) the tutorials, but in the tutorials there is the one point, where I have to copy over these .lock files. I do not have any .lock files. I tried to download 1213 again an in this torrent (TPB) is no .lock file included.

My experience is as it follows: 

When I installed the jeppFD App new/clean and then copy the term charts including airportlist.bin, the the Termcharts are working fine. Also enroute data is displayed, but these are OLD enroute data, I guess they are stored somewhere in the .app section on the iPad. 

In the ""data"" folder I have no Enroute or Enr folder, if it is clean installed.

When I now copy the new ""Enroute"" folder to the data folder, enroute data is displayed no more. It is gone completely. If I delete this enroute folder, then the enroute data in JeppFD reappears, but it is again the old one.

What I am doing wrong? I am using the app in DEMO mode. 

I am sure, that many others experience exactly the same problem with the enroute data.


My theory: jeppFD looks, if a folder named ""enroute"" is existing in data folder. If so, it looks for the .lock files. If they don't exist or do not match for the version, no enroute data is displayed.

Agree?? Again the problem, I don t have these .lock files.

Thanks!!!"
,precursor1188,2013-02-18T17:01Z,"@sysrec222
I looked into the store folder of 1214. The .lock files are there. When I look into 1304, there are no .lock files.
So if your theory is correct. U should update with 1214. If it works then, update to the latest. I think the trick is not to delete anything but to copy the folders over.
My current working 1304 has the .lock file dated Sep 2012."

@airbusflyer

Hi precursor1188,

MANY THANKS for your hints. I would like to try it but the big problem is, 1214 is not available. There is no torrent alive with 1214. 

Do you have a link to get it or would it be possible or reasonable to upload those .lock files from 1214 somewhere?? You would help so many people with that...

Thanks again! Can't wait to enjoy my full JeppFD.

one question concerning FD:
I'm using iPad 1 32GB with jailbreak and iOS 5.1.1 . But sometimes the app is crashing or it takes a while to load. Also weather updates are sometimes rejecected because the slider goes to OFF.

Does someone have the same with newer iPad? My thoughts are that iPad 1 is just to slow/not much power to handle that. We all know the newer versions 2/3 has new CPU which should be much better.

Thanks."

- Erase JEPP FD application and download it from APPLE store.
- Open it once, without having updated anything.
- Close it completely (with X)
- Copy only TermCharts from 1305.
- Erase 'Enroute' Charts folder (whatever you find in Documents)
- Copy 'Enroute' Charts folder from 1213.
- Copy OVER PREVIOUS FOLDER, Enroute Charts from 1305.
- If you want to enable VFR Terminal Charts, create your own airportlist.bin file (need jepp.exe application and JeppView for Windows)
- Overwrite the older airportlist.bin with newer one in TermCharts
- Copy FROM ""C:ProgramData/Jeppesen/Common/TerminalCharts"" TO your IPAD folder ""JeppFD/Documents/data/TermCharts""
theese files: vfrcharts.bin, vfrchrts.dbf, vfrntms.dbf and vfrntms.dbt.

* Note 1: vfrcharts.bin must be writen in LOWERCASE letters, NOT IN CAPITALS.
* Note 2: Google to find jepp.exe application and it's manual.

Voila! FULL JeppFD ;-) "
