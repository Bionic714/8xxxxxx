,.h.264,2013-02-17T11:29Z,I'm surprised somehow I'm not getting accused of 'attacking' Squad again. >_>
,.h.264,2013-02-17T11:34Z,"Aw fucken ripped off. I just got informed it wasn't me they said was attacking them. It was the guy who wrote the foreword for our 18.3 release. I thought someone said our entire crew were responsible for their servers being taken offline for days? 

What's a video compressing torrent release group got to do for some street cred around here?"
,darkonealex,2013-02-17T15:56Z,"they still havent fixed the fuckin crashing...every damn time i want to launch my ship,game crashes! fuck this,my computer can run crysis with good fps,but i can't play this because of the fuckin crashing! dont get me wrong i apreciate the upload and the game but i'm just pissed about that bug"
,Milut44,2013-02-18T21:50Z,darkonealex for me going to 64bit windows fixed problem
,mrSPEED3,2013-02-21T03:45Z,"@darkonealex - If you are having problems with the game crashing you have to set it to only use one core. For some reason the game goes stupid when it tries to take advantage of more than one core. First off startt the game and hit CTRL-ALT-DEL and open the task manager, go to processes and click the show processes from all users button. After that find the KSP.exe and right click it and choose affinity, deselect all but the first core and enjoy smooth running with no crashes. The only downside to this is you need to do it every time you start Kerbal Space Program. Hope this helps you and anyone else having this issues."
,Dj-Kimax,2013-02-27T05:15Z,Thanks. Nice and fast download at 11 MB/s.
