Their Greatest Hits (1971-1975) is the fifth album by the American rock band the Eagles, a compilation released on Asylum Records in 1976.
It is the best selling record in the history of the United States and the second best worldwide behind Michael Jackson's Thriller. This album
was the first ever to be certified platinum for shipping one million copies, and was later certified diamond. It has since shipped 29 million copies,
of which 27 million have been sold. World-wide shipments of Their Greatest Hits (1971-1975) stand at 41 million.

The DCC Version has been remastered by "Genius" Steve Hoffman, from the original masters of the regular studio recordings.


The Album:

While not including any material from what is generally considered the Eagles' best album, Hotel California (which wasn't released until December of 1976),
it serves as a summary of the band's work in its original line-up with Bernie Leadon. Their Greatest Hits collects nine singles, all of which also appeared on their first four albums, and one album track not released as a single, "Desperado," a key song in the band's repertoire in presenting their early image echoing the outlaws from the old American west. Of the singles, all but "Tequila Sunrise" made the Top 40, with five in the top ten and "One of These Nights" and "Best of My Love" both topping the singles chart. Such chart success in the span of a little over four years made the band a formidable presence on American commercial radio in the 1970s, the album becoming a number one hit on the album chart upon release. The band's subsequent ubiquity on classic rock radio over the ensuing decades has undoubtedly been a factor in the album's spectacular sales. Beyond the quality of the performances and catchiness of the tunes, however, specific reasons for this artifact dating from the short reign in popular music of California country rock during the early 1970s attaining the historical position as the all-time number one selling album in America, and the third best-selling album worldwide, have yet to be fully explored.
