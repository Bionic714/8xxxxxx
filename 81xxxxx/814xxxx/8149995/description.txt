The Randi Rhodes Show with Nicole Sandler

It's Friday, ya bastids!

Randi's out today, but Nicole Sandler's filling in with some great topics and informed guests...

With the unprecedented filibuster of Chuck Hagel's nomination for Secretary of Defense, during a time of war no less, Nicole has reached out to political science professor Dr. Gregory Kroger. Kroger says filibusters are a useful tool that's gotten way out of hand, but Harry Reid could change rules at any time. Dr. Kroger's latest book is Filibustering: A Political History of Obstruction in the House and Senate

With the Sierra Club lifting their 120-year ban on civil disobedience and the Forward on Climate Rally happening this weekend, Daniel Kessler of 350.org will address what actions can be taken to stop the policies leading to climate change.

Speaking of climate change, Richard Heinberg of the Post Carbon Institute will also join Nicole to talk about his new book on energy and the President's goals on climate change, as he stated them in the SOTU this week.

Finally, The Franklin Institute's chief astronomer Derrick Pitts will explain the massive asteroid hovering above our heads right now and what connection it has to the meteorite that exploded over Russia.
