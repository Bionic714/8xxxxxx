,uclabobby,2013-02-18T08:32Z,"This is a problem on my end, not with the torrent:

When I get to the license manager - ""phone/email license"" I do not see an installation ID and the status is ""The service does not have sufficient privileges.  Please reinstall.""   

Can someone clearly explain how I should reinstall? Is this a ""run as administrator"" issue or something more complex/unknown? Thanks in advance."

,mf_photon,2013-02-27T09:35Z,"I downloaded this software and installed it great, but when I came to the part of activating it, I found there is no xf-oopf7.exe . I know another user mentioned this as well. What's going on, where is this file at. "
,mf_photon,2013-03-01T01:09Z,"Ok I found out that the problem is the anti-virus. I had to disable it because it kept on deleting the file. It does say it contains a virus with Bitdefender. Other than that the program works great, Thanks."
,jackyah333,2013-03-14T09:15Z,"The keygen gives me ""Invalid installation ID"" when I enter the Installation ID. I've tried over and over and no joy. Please help?!?"
,SpaceOctopus,2013-03-25T06:56Z,"@jackyeah, this is the same exact keygen from xforce... you have to separate every 4 numbers with a dash. I still haven't had luck with the unlock # it generates though....I can't get it to activate the program"

I have used x-force keygen's before but this one us NOT working. Please help."
,sarabear1,2013-04-11T03:23Z,Ok now I got it to generate a code by putting in a dash every four numbers then I pushed generate. I copied and pasted the generated code into the installation but it does not work. it says invalid #
