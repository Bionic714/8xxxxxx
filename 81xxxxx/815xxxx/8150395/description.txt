Woodworking at Home - Issue 22
DVD iso file.


A DVD woodworking magazine that started in 2003 and lasted for about 20 issues.

Well....this is the last issue that was published, unfortunately it was shut down due to financial difficulties.
I think it was good, and the first of this kind as far as I know.
