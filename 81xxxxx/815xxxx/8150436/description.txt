Sociopolitical Documentary hosted by Will Lyman, published by PBS broadcasted as part of PBS Frontline series in 2013 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

This February, as the nation faces yet another round of fiscal crises, FRONTLINE investigates the inside history of how Washington has failed to solve the country's problems of debt and deficit. Drawing on interviews with key players in Congress and the White House, FRONTLINE goes behind the scenes to show how a clash of politics and personalities has taken the nation's economy to the edge of the "fiscal cliff," and now to a second round of standoffs over the debt ceiling and sequestration. The film explores the deep ideological divide inside the Republican Party and the struggle between House Majority Leader Eric Cantor and House Speaker John Boehner as they take on President Obama and the Democrats.
