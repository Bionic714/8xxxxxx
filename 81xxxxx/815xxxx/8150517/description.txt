It offers a variety of different brushes. It has five different types of symmetries you can use (X-Axis, Y-Axis, Arbitrary Angle, Radial, and Kaleidoscopic). It utilizes a smart menu system and a fluid interface, seeking to make work flow on the go much easier. Since all the paths created are vector-based graphics, you can zoom in, zoom out, or pan over infinitely thus making your phone a window to an entire world for your imagination to run free. Those who are fond of Photoshop will find comfort in the Layers system which allows you to work on different aspects of a project with out messing with other ones. The eraser also has a built in softness function that allows you to define which paths can be erased and which ones cannot be. The various special paint attributes consist of four types of blurring, embossing or inner/outer shadowing. The auto save feature allows for peace of mind, allowing you to freely leave the app. It will save the project for you and load it on your return. This is one design app that should not be taken lightly. I hope you enjoy.
