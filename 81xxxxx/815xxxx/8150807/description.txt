So I recently finished Soul Eater (awesome) and after thinking how fun a Soul Eater game might be, I found this. Unfortunately the only torrent I could find was for the PSP version of this game, so I traced down a decent copy of the PS2 version, and well, here it is.

 This torrent contains "Soul Eater: Battle Resonance" for PS2 in ISO format (1.2GB), which is zipped into a 7z archive (155MB, don't ask how I got such a great compression because I just found it this way.) You'll need a program such as WinRar or 7-zip to extract it before it can be used. Please return the favor and seed this for as long as you can.

 I found this on TheIsoZone.com and have tested it using PCSX2 (a PS2 emulator for PC), so I know it's legit. So please, no complaints to the fact that it's zipped in an archive because it unzips to over 1GB (and don't worry, there's no password). 

 To play this game (unless you have a Japanese console), your going to need an emulator or a modded console (PS2 or PS3). This game was only released in Japan, so there aren't any North American NTSC or PAL versions in existence. Please don't ask because I won't be providing any support for emulators or anything. I'm providing you with the legitimate ISO, it's up to you to figure out how to use it!

 All the audio, from what I can tell, seems to be Japanese. The text is mixed so it's easy enough to get around and figure out the game without knowing Japanese.

Thanks for downloading, now please seed for as long as you can.
