,sixtailer,2013-02-18T00:55Z,wow this is the slowest fucking torrent of all time.  By current projections it will finally be finished when  Iran converts to Judaism.
,sixtailer,2013-02-18T01:02Z,wow I get modded for stating the obvious?  welcome to hypocrisy TPB
,melob23,2013-02-19T04:08Z,@ thenoobish whats up with xbox360 version canu get it homie
,spystone,2013-02-22T03:38Z,Thanks!! Work Perfectly !! Multiplayer works too :D
,hgps,2013-02-25T18:01Z,"@uchiwa7 : your comment clearly shows how much of a dumb shit ignorant fuck you really are. you don't need a 2000$ PC to play those games. even a low end CPU @ 100$ and mid end GPU @ 200-300$ can easily smoke a PS3.

and fyi i own xbox360, PS3 and a PC."

,kriss1313,2013-03-01T23:34Z,"Black screen on 4.30 MM 4.20.01.

pls help"
,smarteboy,2013-03-02T17:57Z,"@kriss1313
Go to game setting from MM and select BD mirror and load.. hope it'll work "
,blfunser,2013-03-03T10:20Z,very very slow
,kriss1313,2013-03-04T02:39Z,"@smarteboy
BD mirror didnt fix it.
Same simptom!!!!!

I DL the files 3 times.
Im no noob.
It wont work on 4.30!

All other games work perfect (ex. crysis 2 etc)"
,smarteboy,2013-03-05T15:27Z,"@page even I am using 4.30, and its work perfectly..
While mounting.. its always ask tht ""wud u like to convert 4.31 game to 4.30"" - YES

then only its work..

If possible, do try to install MM 4.20.00 Full and try, not base"
,kriss1313,2013-03-05T21:49Z,"IT WORKS!!
I put AC3 disk in the unit, fix permission from MM, then let the boot fix run - YES, and run it from the Disk icon, NOT /app_home/ps3_game."
,xPatchyZ,2013-03-28T02:54Z,"Working fine with Rebug 4.30.1!
Even Aliens : Colonial Marines is working!
All you have to do is click yes when prompted to convert the file system to 4.31 and it will work "
,theMRnate0,2013-04-10T13:14Z,Can someone tell me if you have to have a jailbroken ps3 to install this :)
,nauell,2013-06-03T19:30Z,"hola , cargue el juego de una disco externo y al seleccionar la imagen del juego me aparece un cartel , con las opciones de si y no , eso es para actualizar mi ps3?? yo trabajo en rogero 4.31"
