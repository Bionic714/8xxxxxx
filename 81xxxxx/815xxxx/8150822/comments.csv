,eliadias,2013-02-17T20:16Z,"I get the same error when I unzip it with 7zip, but i'm still able to view all the videos in it.. 

Alternatively, if you are using WinRar, you could ""Repair Damage Archive"".."
,kr33,2013-02-18T00:29Z,"Day 1 seems to play okay even though it had a CRC error.  I didn't watch every minute of it, I skipped through it in 10-minute increments, but it looked okay."
,eliadias,2013-02-18T01:50Z,Okay thanks for the info.. hope you'll enjoy it=)
,tommycool88,2013-02-18T11:51Z,"Same here ......CRC error, but video play fine STILL.  Keep up the good works Eliadias.....have been looking for all your uploads for a long time, with constant torment for passworded spammer."
,eliadias,2013-02-18T21:17Z,thanks .. means a a lot..
,fyrkant44,2013-02-19T16:34Z,"eliasdias, thanks for the up but I am not able to get Day 1 unzipped/unrared. I am using Winrar and have tried repairing any which way possible, but no luck!
Is it possible to upload just the Day 1 seperately? Thanks mate."
,eliadias,2013-02-20T01:36Z,"fyrkant44: Hi, the original file I downloaded came with a CRC error.. Uploading it separately won't solve the problem.

How bout try using a software called ""7zip"".. Its small and light and easy to use."
,fyrkant44,2013-02-21T19:58Z,"Thanks Eliasdias!!! 7zip did it. Works fine. Though its interesting why Winrar couldn't unzip that. Anyway, Thanks Heaps."
