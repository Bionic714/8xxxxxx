,Moogle36,2013-02-18T13:44Z,"I need help with installation. I follow every steps. Typical, automatic and manual installation. None of it seem to be working.

I also blocked both exe in game folder.

Can any one please tell me how to make this work ?"
,pirateluna,2013-02-27T06:29Z,"It worked perfectly. This is how I did it:

1.Download torrent.
2.When download is finished. Open the rar folder.
3.Create a new folder wherever you want like in My Documents.
4.Select all the files/folders in the rar folder and drag them to the new folder you created.
5.Run Setup.exe run as Administrator.
6.Install game.
7.Now go to where you installed the game (usually in program files/Kalypso Media Digital/Tropico 4.
8.Open the folder you created containing the game. Open the folder that says Crack on it. Open it, select the 4 files that are in the Crack folder. 
9. Copy paste those files unto the program files/Kalypso Media Digital/Tropico 4 folder.
10.Allow those 4 files to be copied and replaced. DONE. You can now play the game. It was very easy."

,dr.helmy,2013-03-23T21:54Z,"same problem

it failes to play the kalypso movie and displays a black screen with the pointer of the game visible and movable"
,weltall2,2013-04-08T05:10Z,"Woot. It is nice to finally see this with all the DLC along with it. Well, I have everything but 3 DLC bought, but this is really helpful since the DLC never really added much."
,weltall2,2013-04-08T13:29Z,"FOR THE PEOPLE THAT GET A BLACKSCREEN!

If you have played the game before and have a save, this is a cause. Sadly as soon as you are going to use this game, the older saves become useless. My previous save was even from the Official Tropico 4, from steam, with all the DLC minus:

┬╗Megalopolis DLC
┬╗Pirate Heaven DLC
┬╗Exclusive island for Steam Special Edition -"" Isla Nublar ""

and yet if the save is in the folder, the game does not start. You have to go to:

C:Users[Your user name here]AppDataRoamingTropico 4users folder and delete the saves folders from there.

You can still use the actual saves you have which are in the folder user1ExSaves, but save.lua must be deleted. 

Save.lua is ALL the progress you have done and even if you load the save files, you will just play the mission/map you were on. Achievements, levels (in different attribues) and missions will be reset to a new game."

Thank you so much , your solution resolved the problem."
,weltall2,2013-04-13T23:06Z,"No problem dr.helmy, but I have bad news on my side. After reaching mission 19 and leaving the game, my game got corrupt. Trying to enter it will just give me a flashing Tropico image and go back to the black screen. Sadly deleting the save.lua was the only solution I found to the problem. Well since Tropico did not want me to finish it normally. I went ahead and used cheats to go back to mission 19. No achievements for me I guess XD"
