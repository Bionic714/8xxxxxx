Any idea to make it work please ?"

I've just re-tested Expert PDF 8 Professional on 2 different rigs and i can't replicate the error your getting. Try a re-install and make sure you follow the instructions contained in the INFO TAB exactly."

Thanks for reply. I just tried to re-install ""exactly as indicated in the ""INFO"" and I got the same message... Too bad !
Thanks anyway"
