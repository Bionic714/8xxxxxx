Great good old Christian music , please help me by seeding this for everyone in the world , due to people being so fearful of the Truth that lays in Jesus ,, they tend to ignore these things and not want to hear it ,. but don't give up there will be a day when all is revealed :) 

psalms 23
Psalm 23
A psalm of David.

1 The Lord is my shepherd, I lack nothing.
2     He makes me lie down in green pastures,
he leads me beside quiet waters,
3     he refreshes my soul.
He guides me along the right paths
    for his nameΓÇÖs sake.
4 Even though I walk
    through the darkest valley,[a]
I will fear no evil,
    for you are with me;
your rod and your staff,
    they comfort me.

5 You prepare a table before me
    in the presence of my enemies.
You anoint my head with oil;
    my cup overflows.
6 Surely your goodness and love will follow me
    all the days of my life,
and I will dwell in the house of the Lord
    forever.
