Here are a variety of 1-shot comics that came out from the 1950's to the mid 1950's covering almost every genre.

Publishers include Fawcett, Avon, Charleston, Quality and many others.

My Personal Favorite is Super Duper Comics #3, which is the first Golden Age appearance of Mr Monster, the Character that Writer/Artist Michael T. Gilbert Later Made famous in the 80's/90's!!!
