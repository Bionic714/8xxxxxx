Wait for a cleaner upload.
Audio is out of sync, barely 350p."

,Melo22,2013-02-17T03:55Z,"Nepotu you pretty much always put up great videos. This one tho was unwatchable. Hopefully you'll get the dunk,3pt and allstar game in 720 and 540. Keep up the good work!"
,Laci4465,2013-02-17T16:34Z,Hard to believe that there is no better quality rip out there :/... ...this is the only one this far.
,stizzymack,2013-02-17T20:34Z,"Not good quality, but thanks for sharing!"
[V],Nepotu,2013-02-18T01:16Z,You're all welcome! It was all I could found until then. It is a 360p improved version in my NBA All Events torrent.
