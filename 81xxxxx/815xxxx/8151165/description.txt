This is the Hearthfire DLC pure, plain, and simple, with no installers, and no cracks. It will work on a properly cracked Skyrim game updated to the latest version (currently 1.8.151.0.7, aka Update 11). It will also work with the bought version from Steam.

This is a 7-zip file properly compressed. To install, simply extract Hearthfires.esm and Hearthfires.bsa into the Data directory of your Skyrim installation and check it in the Skyrim Launcher. Or, if you prefer, you may simply import it into your favorite mod manager (Nexus Mod Manager, for instance), and it will install it for you.

As always, if you like the game, BUY IT. Support good game developers!
