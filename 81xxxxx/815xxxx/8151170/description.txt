Personal Notes: I noticed there doesn't seem to be much of this bands music out there in the torrent community, and what does exist is in a lossy format like mp3, or even worse, mp3s encoded with CBR rather than VBR. I am in the process of collecting the entire discography and am releasing the rips piecemeal until my collection is complete. Ultimately I wish to provide the scans from the inserts as well (whenever I get a scanner). I ripped the cd using the linux "abcde" script and tagged with "easytag." This is my first torrent so go easy on the criticisms.
