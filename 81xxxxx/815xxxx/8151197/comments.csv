,eliadias,2013-02-16T22:46Z,"I was as piss as you when I downloaded torrents with the same name and they were password protected.. 

I got these downloads from heroturko.me.. Thats why they are zipped.. Credits to the uploaders.. They are good and working. "
,tommycool88,2013-02-17T08:13Z,"Hi. Still downloading...if its as you say it is, then that would be awesome. So keeping fingers cross right now"
,eliadias,2013-02-17T09:23Z,Do tell me if you got them okay.. This the first time I've ever uploaded torrents=)
,tommycool88,2013-02-17T20:09Z,will do. Lots of good password protected torrent....hopefully we shall get them through you. 
,eliadias,2013-02-17T20:18Z,"I notice you can actually download those password protected torrents from sites like heroturko.me.. unfortunately it takes forever and is a hassle!

Torrents are still the best=)"
,tommycool88,2013-02-18T11:56Z,"Yeah......downloading the files one after the other, and without premium account is such a drag."
,sharecare,2013-02-19T11:23Z,Please seed. I'm at 67%. Thanks. 
,falafelface,2013-02-21T16:07Z,OK. These are real deal. Thanks!
,Blaydemon,2013-02-21T17:58Z,"Thnx for the upload! I was wondering, does this come with all the extras, like the pdfs and such you use with the course?"
,yuber999,2013-02-25T11:22Z,"the PDF's isn't included, but still, its a great torrent, thank you for sharing it, will seed! and if anyone knows where to download the PDF's, please share the link"
,woofagoo,2013-03-04T00:41Z,"There are no PDFs, it's a CreativeLIVE broadcast, not a course. At least not a typical one and there are no PDFs for CreativeLIVE events."
