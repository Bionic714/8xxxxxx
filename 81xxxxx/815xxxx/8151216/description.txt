Sweatshop Union is a Canadian hip hop collective formed in 2000 in Vancouver, when four politically minded rap acts Dirty Circus, Pigeon Hole, Kyprios and Innocent Bystander came together to produce their first album, which was published in 2001.

Known for an inventive and socially conscious sound, Sweatshop Union's music focuses on being "honest" commenting on issues ranging from the war in Iraq, the plight of the poor and working-class, to the negativity and misogyny of mainstream hip-hop.

Personal Notes: I noticed there doesn't seem to be much of this bands music out there in the torrent community, and what does exist is in a lossy format like mp3, or even worse, mp3s encoded with CBR rather than VBR. I am in the process of collecting the entire discography and am releasing the rips piecemeal until my collection is complete. Ultimately I wish to provide the scans from the inserts as well (whenever I get a scanner). I ripped the cd using the linux "abcde" script and tagged with "easytag." This is my first torrent so go easy on the criticisms.
