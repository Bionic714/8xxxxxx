Mathematica 9 DMG.

I had Mathematica 8.0.4.0 installed previously from one on the torrent founds on this site. Running the install for the attached resulted in a clean overwrite, taking the serial # from the v. 8 install.

There is a Windows (.exe) based crack if this is your first install of Mathematica. I cannot vouch for its virus-free-ness.

So, the only tried route that I know of is install 8 using one of the recognised torrents, then install this v. 9 over it. Tested only on 10.8.2.

Enjoy!
