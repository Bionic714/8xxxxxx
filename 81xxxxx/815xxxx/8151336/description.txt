Cornetist Nat Adderley is heard with an all-star quintet also featuring tenor saxophonist Johnny Griffin and keyboardist Victor Feldman on this enjoyable set. Except for "Come Rain or Come Shine," all of the melodies are group originals (including four by Adderley). The music is essentially modern hard bop and is as well-played as one would expect from this strong personnel.
