The Penguins of Madagascar - Season 3 - Episode 26 (WEB-DL - 480p)
------------------------------------------------------------------

The Emmy Award winning Penguins of Madagascar Skipper, Kowalski, Rico
and Private are an elite strike force with top-tier commando skills and
a world-class clandestine headquarters. At least, that's how Skipper would
describe them. Others might say they're four cute penguins living among their
animal brethren at the New York City Zoo. Only one thing is capable of distracting
them from their mission: their obnoxious neighbor, King Julien.

Produced by DreamWorks Animation SKG and Nickelodeon Productions.
