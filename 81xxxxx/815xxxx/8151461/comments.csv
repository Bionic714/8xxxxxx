And then all of you can join me in seeding this collection to others (at least until you reach a 1:1 ratio!), making the whole thing go much faster for everyone. Thanks!"

I'm in and if I ever get this stuff I will seed!!!
Hope you're right. It runs fast now, but all me leecher-buddies are at 39%.
Hmm.
Because this is fine work you've done, all the x-rated early albums...COOL!"
,MarsVoltaic,2013-02-28T08:04Z,"Don't worry, you'll get it. The problem is that I'm the only one seeding to like 50 of you at once. So everyone gets a little bit at a time. Plus I was just gone for a few days vacation. And to allay any doubters' fears, would I bother to comment here if it was a dead seed? Not likely. Don't worry. If you download it, they will come :-)"
