1) ty eztv for your uploads, I couldn't live without your high quality and (almost always) your timeliness for making them available quickly

2) Did Bill take a break this week? And if so when is he due to be broadcasting new shows again since Feb 22nd show is no where to be seen?

3) Anyone that is still downloading torrents without an IP masker is asking for legal trouble these days. There are a few reliable and affordable ones out there. If I can afford a good one on disability benefits (which is less than 10K a year) then everyone can. To get torrents without one is just beyond stupidity because once you've been pinged by one network/channel/internet provider/movie production studio then your IP and your identifying info is circulated to ALL of them per FCC laws for intellectual property theft prevention. As much as we disagree with these laws philosophically (and they are excellent reasons to be sure) it is still by law illegal to do so and that put us in the position for them to have us by the short hairs. 
I am currently working with a lobby group to make people with developmental disabilities (epilepsy, autism, downs syndrome, etc) exempt from these laws since commercial advertising has many things in them that are common triggers for episodes and seizures (too much of certain colors, sound volumes exceedingly loud, content that is too quickly visually changing or subjects that are harmful, etc) Which can be easily verified the same way credit cards are done online to prove those persons are on disability with one of those afflictions. Many of us do not even own a television and the only way we can watch tv shows or movies is through torrents since it is the only safe way to view them without advertising, and be previewed by care providers to ensure that content is safe for us to view. 

The arguments against so far in congress and senate for such legislation is that once it is made available that way for the developmentally disabled that others that are not will exploit this loophole. They should be looking at the numbers of people that watch through torrents exclusively to see that their fight is hopeless and until the industry evolves with the times to allow us to subscribe to those channels through the internet exclusively without having to subscribe through a cable provider as well, they will continue to be on the losing end of what is the modern equivilant to prohibition. When a government bans something from the people that the people want, the government loses no matter how long they fight against it history teaches us throughout all of human history and not just USA history."
