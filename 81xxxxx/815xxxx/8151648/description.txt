Some /g/ents requested this since it was nowhere to be found on the internet. This is Chan Elite 1.9.1 tested for iOS 4, 5 and 6. It does crash every now and then, but it's definitely better than the mobile site 4chan has for example. 

It has been removed from the official App store. I have no idea whether or not this will work on jailbroken devices.
