,filhodaputa,2013-02-17T02:30Z,"under 700mb and with the 1080p more than twice the size
i have a felling this is another rip with fucked up audio"
,malakaa,2013-02-17T03:36Z,"@filhodaputa

1080p is slightly more than twice as many pixels, so it would make sense if the 1080p version is slightly more than double the file size... wouldnt it?
his file sizes are small because of the perfect settings he uses to re-encode the videos. it requires a very powerful computer to be able to do this within a reasonable time. luckily we have yify doing us all this favor of condensing these videos so much without losing noticeable quality. that is the beauty of it. 
a small file size does not always mean poor quality. his 720p rips are always great.
keep it up yify! thank you!
i'll rate the quality but im sure it's the usual 
V 9.9/10
A 9.9/10"
,alveolate,2013-02-17T08:17Z,"@filhodaputa

you are talking out of your ass.

yify has uploaded only top-quality rips thus far, i've personally never ever had any trouble with their torrents. and all their 720p rips are around this size.

why don't u be less of a moron and try the damn rip before dissing it? there are tons of crap uploaders out there... and you are pissing on the one of the rare good ones."

,filhodaputa,2013-02-17T17:35Z,"you guys are idiots
yifi  has released files with fucked up audio many times before just to save a couple of bytes whence my suspicion"
,arvipat,2013-02-17T18:25Z,"i've d'loaded tons of YIFY stuff and, so far, never had any issues, audio or video. he's a godsend, for me at least.

,TechnoSam,2013-02-19T02:39Z,"Quality here is amazing. Even for a YIFY torrent, which good quality is expected from, so that's really saying something."

,black.hat,2013-04-28T22:21Z,"this is a good movie and a compact, high-quality encoding that also plays unmodified on ipods / iphones / ipads!  the audio did drop out about halfway through the credits when playing on a PS3, but i'm probably one of the few people who actually watches the credit roll.  but other than that minor gripe, this is a fine torrent"
