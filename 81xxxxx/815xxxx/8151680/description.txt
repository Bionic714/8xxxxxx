About the Game:
Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS: GO) will expand upon the team-based
action gameplay that it pioneered when it was launched 12 years ago.

CS: GO features new maps, characters, and weapons and delivers updated
versions of the classic CS content (de_dust, etc.). In addition, CS: GO
will introduce new gameplay modes, matchmaking, leader boards, and more.

"Counter-Strike took the gaming industry by surprise when the unlikely
MOD became the most played online PC action game in the world almost
immediately after its release in August 1999," said Doug Lombardi at Valve.
"For the past 12 years, it has continued to be one of the most-played
games in the world, headline competitive gaming tournaments and selling
over 25 million units worldwide across the franchise. CS: GO promises to
expand on CS' award-winning gameplay and deliver it to gamers on the PC as
well as the next gen consoles and the Mac."
