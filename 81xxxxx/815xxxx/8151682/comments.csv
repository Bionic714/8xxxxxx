,spamaed,2013-04-19T03:10Z,"Installed to Win8, following the instructions... paste the request code to the x64 keygen.. but the activation code I paste back - doesnt fill the 16 boxes  (box 15 only has 1 character)  and after 'next' Autocad says ..
Registration-Activation Error (0015.111) 

Ideas ?   should I use a different download for Win8?"
