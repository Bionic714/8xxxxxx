Drugs, Inc: Cocaine
A comprehensive view of the $300 billion dollar global illicit drug industry from multiple perspectives; producers, traffickers, dealers, users, doctors, and law enforcement officials. The supply chain of cocaine is international, and produces fast wealth for a very few, and delivering misery to millions. This episode will follow its trail from the perspective of the peasant farmers who grow cocaine, a trafficker tied to Mexican cartels and a 28-year-old crack dealer in Miami's poorest neighbourhood. Additionally the devastation of cocaine addiction will be revealed via revolutionary brain photography in a leading laboratory in Brookhaven, New York.
