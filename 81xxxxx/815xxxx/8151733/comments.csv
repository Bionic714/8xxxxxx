,nickncass,2013-02-19T08:22Z,Can somebody pls seed. my download has stopped at 99.8% pls seed
,nickncass,2013-02-19T08:31Z,Pls seed guys...no seeders are available for this torrent...
,Jackal96,2013-02-19T19:11Z,"Hey guys, I seed most of the day, but I don't leave my PC on 24/7 so obviously there will be periods with low to no seeders.

However, by now many people must have finished downloading this torrent, so please everyone seed at least 1.0 ratio, and if you can seed 1.5+ that would be great."
,uffesnuffe,2013-02-20T00:45Z,"There is one 1 MB piece missing, according to uTorrent, but it plays fine in VLC-player and nothing seems to be missing. Things like this has happened before in my experience.
Thanks for the upload Jackal96!"
,Jackal96,2013-02-20T06:24Z,"The only file that can actually be corrupted is the .NFO file because I modified it after creating the torrent file and uploading it to TPB. But that one is not even near 1MB.

If you want to play it safe, just wait and it will eventually download.

Oh, and no problem uffesnuffe, I hope you like the movie."
,Jackal96,2013-02-27T20:20Z,"Guys, I'm almost at a 10/1 upload ratio and the seeders haven't increased. If you don't start seeding after downloading I'll stop uploading and this torrent will die. About the ""stuck at 98%"" problem, I'm not sure why It happens, but you can still watch the movie and seed. I suppose I'm the only one who is seeding that final 2% and that's why it takes forever to download. If more people seeded this wouldn't happen."
,mjabongo,2013-04-20T14:01Z,Very fast download. The only reason why it doesn't show all the seeders is because they're all trying to leech that last 0.02% which doesn't exist :) So don't worry about seeder number
,Jackal96,2013-05-04T19:41Z,"Has anyone been able to go past 99,9%? If not I'll have to re-upload."
,stangowner,2013-05-15T15:26Z,"I just jumped on this and am also stuck @ 99.8%.
Thanks for taking the time and energy to restore this classic! :-)"
,stangowner,2013-05-15T15:47Z,"Could you please?
Thank you for taking the time to restore this!!!"
,stangowner,2013-05-15T16:25Z,"http://i.imgbox.com/adwFR10F.jpg
Here is a pic of my seedbox's WebUI.As you can see,the movie is the problem.The .nfo doesn't matter.Could you please re-upload it?Thanks"
,screiter,2013-05-16T10:54Z,"Yes you should really re-upload this.... As have been mentioned, you get stuck at 98%, and I can't play the file in any player available. Downloading at 0,1 kB/s, so it will take for ever to get that 1 MB (if it's even possible)"
,intoxicator,2013-05-17T12:07Z,It wont download the last 0.2% and for me the file wont open in any kind of mediaplayer. Bullshit upload imo...
