,Shah_Jahan,2013-02-18T20:01Z,"Thanks brother.

I've never used this, so how should I get started? I *DON'T* have any net access on my phone due to WiFi and 3G unavailability in my area! But I can download apps from Google Play on PC and then install them on my Phone.

SO I should first get,
1) Sygic: GPS Navigation from here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sygic.aura
2) Install
3) How to activate (when I DON'T have net access on phone?)
4) Dowload data-content from here? http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8154886/Sygic_v.12.2.2_Data_Content_Full.rar
5) Download maps for India from your upload here? http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8015970/Sygic_India_TA_2012.01.rar
6) Rename the folder ""sygic"" to Sygic_1"" and uninstall Sygic (which was downloaded from Google Play in step 1?)
7) Install Sygic v.12.2.2 Full (THIS is the full version, right?!)
8) Don't run yet, go to the folder ""sygic_1"" rename it back to ""sygic"" and then run Sygic.
9) In which folder should I then copy-paste the maps for India I downloaded in step 5 (maps downloaded from YOUR torrent, NOT from the app!)

Also, kindly check your PM on suprbay.

Thank you very much brother."
,ScorpioPirate,2013-02-18T21:24Z,"@Shah_Jahan :)

Just do as you have write to do my friend :)

And Sygic don't use any kind of ""net"" or ""3G"".....

Have  fun :)"
,Shah_Jahan,2013-02-19T17:17Z,"Thanks. It worked. It didn't require internet connection to get it to work. Although no matter what I do, it says, ""inaccurate signal for car navigation"". Do you think installing ""GPS Fix Deluxe"" will make any difference to this? I know it's NOT required, but still. Can you kindly upload it as I didn't find it here.

It requires a buck load of RAM and since my RAM is very VERY limited, only 128MB, it runs painfully slow for around a minute before crashing. BUT the problem is on MY end, and NOT with this upload. If you have a phone with enough RAM to run this, then you should NOT have any problems running it.

Thanks again brother."
,AJthebest,2013-02-20T20:57Z,This shit never work for me. I can't never get trial to download any data or start anything. Also can you please post new maps for morocco. I am using sygic 12.1 and its been impossible for me to upgrade. 
,AJthebest,2013-02-21T01:30Z,"@ Shah_Jahan

,AJthebest,2013-02-21T02:27Z,"@ Shah_Jahan

I have the same issue with 12.2.2
@ ScorpioPirate

,xzqter,2013-02-22T02:25Z,"thanks Dude. I got Sygic working on my Motorola RAZR but for some reason the same apk did not work on my Galaxy Note 10.1 but I finally got it right. 
For everybody having problems, I downloaded the Sygic Trial and instaled the maps and aditional data, no mistery there then downloaded utorrent and SIMPLE UNRAR aplications from the market, downloaded the torrent to my external SD, after that renamed the folder just like the instructions unstaled the Trial and renamed back to Sygic and extracted, not installed like posted, thats a little confusing, both Sygic 12.2.2.rar and Sygic data content full to the same folder using the simple rar. Now you shoul seen the Sygic icon in the folder, instaled the new Sygic and everything works fine, even downloaded new maps with no problem."
,ScorpioPirate,2013-02-22T14:19Z,"Also the new updated Map-Downloader here:
http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8151771/Sygic_Maps_Downloader_v1.1.rar

For those that have try-out Sygic before, and don't have the permission to download maps.

This Downloader have the new 2012.09 maps from all the world inside :)

Have fun guy's, and seed long time :)"
,yasir_pk77,2013-02-22T18:46Z,"i did download it. when i open it, it doesnt give me the option of trail or download any thing. all it say to buy or something like that. please help."
,yourmomblows,2013-02-24T22:27Z,Followed all the steps and not working on LG-P999. I got the program to load and let me configure it at some point during the last 6 hours or so trying to get it to work. There is no clear info on how to put maps on external sd. I even modified the location setting in settings.ini and it still tries to go to the net and download them. clicking on activate trial crashes the app. To be honest there is way too much work involved to get this to work. I gave up.
,AJthebest,2013-02-25T21:01Z,"@yasir_pk77
just copy the MAP to sygic folder and it'll work
make sure u install the original apk not the trial one"
,cowidster,2013-03-05T04:37Z,How  to change the istallation to english?
,cheo1987,2013-03-13T19:07Z,"Hi!
First, thx for the upload!
Second, pls dont take this wrong but i think instructions are confusing, you refer to ""Sygic v12.2.2 trial"" and ""Sygic v.12.2.2 Full"" and at this torrent the files are named "".. original"" and ""... patched"" so... which one is the one!?!?!?!?
sorry for the inconvenience and thx again"
