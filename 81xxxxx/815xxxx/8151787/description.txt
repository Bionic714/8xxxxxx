The size is a bit bigger than I wanted it to be, but with the added audio track I just didn't want to lose quality. 

Simply the best (and probably most accurate) movie about the late middle ages. One of my personal favorites too. Enjoy!


SEED PLEASE! I have limited bandwidth, so I try not to upload new movies until there's at least 5 full seeds. I have LOTS more classic movies to up, so if you like my work please help out and seed, which saves me from having to seed old uploads. Thanks!
