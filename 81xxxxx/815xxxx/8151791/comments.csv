[T],relentlesstech,2013-02-19T15:36Z,"Not cool! Installed, and during install my NOD32 started going ballistic, and said it was shutting down my computer to prevent damage - I figured it was a false-positive, and wasn't too worried about it, but when I tried to turn the computer back on, my Windows 7 had been corrupted, and wouldn't boot! Ran a bootable A/V, and there were 4 recognized rootkits, and sectors on my hard drive were corrupt - This was a brand new fucking hard drive! I replaced the HDD with an older one, and once I reformatted I tried to install in a Virtual Machine, and the VM ended up not booting up after install! I don't know what the hell is wrong with this, but I know I'm not trusting any 'one-click installs' anymore! For what I have to pay for a new HDD I could have bought the game twice!"
[T],The_Duck1,2013-02-19T18:47Z,"Hmmm strange story, i have uploaded more then 400 torrents, there are more then 9000 runs with my one click torrents and you are the first one who comes up with a story like this.
I think you don't play very fair with me, or you run something else what was infected by i don't know what.

Please post the files who where infected and i will look deeper for you."
