Need for Speed: Most Wanted is an open world Racing game. The game is
the 19th release in the long-running Need for Speed franchise, but

in races with police unified against them. Races have a set beginning
and end point, with the open world game design allowing players to
complete each using whatever path they can find. Additional features
of performance include a unique blend of Simulation and Arcade
gameplay, social play options through the Autolog 2 feature, exciting
multiplayer support, and a large selection of vehicles.

Elude the Cops, and Competitors in Open World Racing Play

To be "Most Wanted," players need to outrun the cops, out drive your
friends, and outsmart your rivals. With a relentless police force
gunning to take you down, you'll need to make split second decisions.
Use the open world to your advantage to find hiding spots, hit jumps
and earn new vehicles to keep you one step ahead. In true Criterion
Games fashion, your friends are at the heart of your experience. In
an open world with no menus or lobbies, you'll be able to instantly
challenge your friends and prove your driving skill in a variety of
seamless multiplayer events. Your rivals will do everything they can
to stop you from getting to the top. In this world, only one thing is
certain - there can only be one "Most Wanted."

City.
