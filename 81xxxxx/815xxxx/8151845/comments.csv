,ayceod,2013-02-17T09:04Z,Can't get any speed downloading this or the YIFY 720p version. Even tried it on two different computers. The same on both. 
,arnold111,2013-02-17T11:04Z,Yify makes great quality brrip in small sizes. If you want the best then download full bluray or 7-8gb rip.

,akmranderson,2013-02-17T12:24Z,"WOOHOO!!! Thanks Yify, you are the absobloodylute best."
,b1893757,2013-02-17T12:48Z,"Hey @YIFY,

thanx for all your nice work.

I realize that you are concerned about file size and that's probably why you don't include the 6 channel AC3 audio track. Is there any way you could publish an extra torrent with yust the ac3 audio track? This way it would not make the main torrent bigger but we'd still have the option of multi channel. If this wouldn't be too much extra work for you.

Thank you ether way. :)"

,booobp,2013-02-17T22:40Z,"The picture is fine. But the audio is worse than YIFY's regular uploads. Extremely fuzzy, and gets worse when explosions and bass comes in. Better to wait for a better upload."

GREAT UPLOAD. THANKS!"
,roherin,2013-03-11T11:27Z,"Hello YIFY.
First of all thank you for the time and effort you spend on making torrents available to us. Great work.

There is just one thing that buggs me. In your file description you don't mention that the audio is AAC (wich they almost always are in all your torrents). This piece of information would have saved me a lot of downloading time since I can't use AAC. It will not decode to 5:1 and I really value the sound quality. 

Maybe others don't have a problem with this, then fine..!! But it would be a great thing to include the info in your file description.

PS: Even better would be a DTS/AC3 solution if possible? Thanx again for your work though :-)"
,nani1983,2013-03-12T05:45Z,perfect 10 for Audio & Video  ;D
,archangel1594,2013-03-14T18:24Z,"@hackerps3 How did you get 29.5 mb/s, I should be able to get 10mb/s but I only get 1mb/s. I have an ASUS laptop with windows 7...."
,metlebxirt,2013-03-17T15:50Z,"Thanks YIFI for another great one!

,DoomFather,2013-03-22T20:24Z,"@osriccc:
   Dude, you are retarded. I have not yet found a rip by YIFY that is bad. The pixel quality is top notch, the volume has minimal fluctuation just like the movies themselves, and the audio syncs perfectly with the video. If you don't know what you are talking about, don't speak. It makes you seem like an ignorant fool. I am hoping you are not, and take the advice of people who do."
