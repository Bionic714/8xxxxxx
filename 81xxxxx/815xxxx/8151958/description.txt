Emerson, Lake & Palmer - Works Orchestral Tour(1977) and The Manticore Special (1973) DVD

rguably the two best videos of ELP, each one from two climatic moments of the band's history. "The Manticore Special" comes from the Brain Salad Surgery era (which, unfortunately, never had a complete show video released). "Works Orchestral Tour" might be the very peak of ELP on stage, as on that historical night of August 26th, 1977, the band played (and had the show filmed) to a sold out audience of 70,000 fans, sharing the Montreal Olympic Stadium stage with the ELP 65 piece orchestra and Conductor Godfrey Salmon (who would work again with Keith Emerson in "Inferno" and "Nighthawks").
