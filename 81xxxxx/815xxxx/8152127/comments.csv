In some places it's fine - but in many, it's just bad."
,blugoo,2013-04-23T16:45Z,"Hi,
cinesimon is harsh but it's true, there is something wrong with the video compression. I had never seen x264 look like some old XVid in some parts of the film and wish I had downloaded a good DVD rip because in this instance, high def doesn't bring anything.
Have nice day."

Thanks for the link to the subtitles. They are not the best quality, but will have to do until someone posts retail subtitles. If such a thing exists for this film."
