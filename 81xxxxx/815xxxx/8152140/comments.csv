Scene, thank you for always coming through. I seed at least 3 to 4 times what I leech. Always will."

[T],XxFukenGruvenxX,2013-02-17T09:29Z,"Thank you for share.

However.. SirPaul is doing something wrong with his encodings..  all of his releases are horrible in color/quality. Where.. the competitors w/ similar size & format produce spectacular quality.

it must be his source .. he may have to invest in an HDTV or something.

Just a bit of constuctive criticism.

Other than that.. 
The file is clean, and no problems."

  I got a slow net, and my monitour isn´t full HD, so i preffer the 1.39GB cause it wil come faster!!!"
