,droidika3,2013-02-17T21:41Z,Why does anyone get these?  There is an x264 encoded copy of this that's about 180MB.  
,ScottyD7421,2013-02-21T07:28Z,"Cheers for the upload {C_P}, much appreciated.

Never ceases to surprise me that the same people complain about quality every week yet they continue to download?

Thanks M8"
