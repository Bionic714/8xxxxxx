Napoleon Hill, one of the best-selling self-help authors of all time whose teachings have influenced entire generations of success seekers, wrote this profound and provocative book in 1938 just after the publication of his all-time best-seller, Think and Grow Rich. But Outwitting the Devi! was withheld from release because it was considered too controversial by his family and advisors. HillΓÇÖs insights on breaking through inhibitionsand livinga life free from fear, donbt, and dependency remained mostly unseenΓÇöuntil now.

More than seven decades later, Sharon LechterΓÇö one of our leading motivational thinkersΓÇöhas edited and interpreted HillΓÇÖs manuscript for contemporary readers, revealing proven strategies that allow us to break free from the DevilΓÇÖs influence and live the abundant and successful life we deserve.

This book reveals that the DevilΓÇöafter being outwitted by legendary success guru HillΓÇörelinquishes his secrets about the hidden methods of control that can lead us to ruin. It offers a perceptive look at how we hand over our fates to negative thoughts, passive acceptance, and physical pain, and identifies the greatest obstacles we face in reaching personal goals: fear, procrastination, anger, and jealousy.

HillΓÇÖs aim was, in his own words, to help ΓÇ£unlock the doors of the self-made prisons in which men and women are confined.ΓÇ¥ Outwitting the Devil does just that. And because it was written at a lime when the world was emerging from a severe financial meltdown and facing a global conflict, it has a surprising relevance to our own time of economic and political uncertainty.
