Ron Sexsmith is in a difficult spot: Despite his well-structured pop songs and praise from the likes of Elvis Costello and Paul McCartney, his music has been confined to critical darling status. ItΓÇÖs a shame, because SexsmithΓÇÖs music comprises orchestral, Brian Wilson-esque love odes at times, and at others, contemplative, Sea Change-era Beck tunes. His newest album, Forever Endeavour, fuses those elements into an album of tightly-packed pop goodness.

Sexsmith is at his best when he doesnΓÇÖt try to do too much. Songs like the jaunty ΓÇ£Nowhere IsΓÇ¥ and the slow-rolling ΓÇ£Lost in ThoughtsΓÇ¥ are simple country-folk structures that showcase SexsmithΓÇÖs old soul vocoal with rising and falling strings and slide guitars. The latter track could easily be a ΓÇÖ70s Leonard Cohen cut (whoΓÇÖs another strong supporter of Sexsmith), gliding over the ears like a sea breeze.

ΓÇ£Sneak Out the Back DoorΓÇ¥ lets SexsmithΓÇÖs words take front and center ΓÇö just him and his guitar. He tells the story of a relationship falling apart and how heΓÇÖs ΓÇ£never been good at saying good-byeΓÇ¥ so heΓÇÖs just going to ΓÇ£sneak out the back door.ΓÇ¥ The old sad-words-over-jolly-melody trick works fantasticallyΓÇö especially at the end, when he sings, ΓÇ£When my life is over / gonna sneak out the back door / HadnΓÇÖt much of a Midas touch / No luck for sure / Give my regards to the people in charge / As I sneak out the back door.ΓÇ¥

The few missteps on the album are the too-pristine ΓÇ£Back of My HandΓÇ¥ and the forced Dixieland stomp of ΓÇ£Me Myself and Wine,ΓÇ¥ The production and extraneous instruments make the songs sound overwrought, particularly the horns on the latter. Overall, though, the album is crisp and straightforward, making Forever Endeavor a big step toward Sexsmith gaining household-name status.
