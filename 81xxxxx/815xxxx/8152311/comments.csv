A useful tip is that if you have to disguise a link to get it posted, it's because we've blocked links to that domain.  Note that if you disguise links eg. thepiratebay DOT se we consider that an act of bad faith."

As you can see, I got velvetfog to allow it. a long time ago from what i've heard though it requires URLs to be on its own line to work properly (be linked) which I don't want to bother doing since I just copy/paste the NFO into the description box and since I tend to release often I want to post here as quick as possible. as a result I just do ""dot xp3 dot biz"" in the nfo which just gets pasted here

I won't do it in the comments from now on though, sorry about that."
[S],soda,2013-02-18T22:31Z,"I'm not wrong, you've just misunderstood what I've said.  I've replied to your forum PM with more details.

As for "" it requires URLs to be on its own line to work properly (be linked) "" that is incorrect.  See https://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8159591/"

Is this pilot the same episode aired under the title ""Vinnie & Wendell"" or is it something different?"
[T],MrUnpopular,2013-02-25T21:39Z,"Yes. This is the first episode, the pilot/Vinnie & Wendell."
