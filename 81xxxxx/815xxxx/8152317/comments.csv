,kokalica,2013-03-11T08:39Z,"It does not contain Vergile's Downfall and update 1. This is the only working update 2 i found on piratebay so it's 100% legit. I used it and it's working. All you need to do now is to get Vergile's Downfall,u should use Mr.Stifmeister's file,and there u'll have explanation about installing the update2+vergile's downfall by me :) "
