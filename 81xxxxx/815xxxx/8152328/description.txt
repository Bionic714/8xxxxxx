English translated title: The Angel's Melancholy/Melancholia


Supposedly the sickest, most disturbing film ever made, making August Underground Mordum and Salo or The 120 Days of Sodom together look like My Little Pony by comparison.

Couldn't find a working torrent of this anywhere, so here you go.

English subtitles are from web searching; I cannot vouch for its quality. Don't ask me how to get subs to work with an ISO; I don't know.

ISO because I have no idea how to encode properly; someone else who knows what they're doing can go ahead and have fun with it.

IMDB link here and no image because PB kept yelling at me.
