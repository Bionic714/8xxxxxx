But when someone sees Renesmme do something that makes them think that she was turned. This person goes to the Volturri, because it is a violation to turn a child. And the penalty is death for both who turned the child into a vampire and the child, cause they deem a turned child too dangerous. Alice gets a vision of the Volturri coming after them. So the Cullens try to convince them that Renesmme is not a threat. So they ask friends and family to come stand with them.
