Elephant Stone frontman Rishi Dhir has been a frequently outsourced sitar player amongst bands of upper-middle prominence for years. He recorded and toured with the likes of Brian Jonestown Massacre and the Horrors before launching his own project in 2009 for which heΓÇÖs responsible for vocals, sitar, and bass. His band name is a reference to both the song by the Stone Roses and a literal stone that Dhir owns: a statue of the Hindu god of new beginnings, Ganesh. He describes his bandΓÇÖs sound as ΓÇô wait for it ΓÇô ΓÇ£Hindie rockΓÇ¥.

On their Polaris long-listed debut, 2009ΓÇ▓s The Seven Seas, Dhir set out to incorporate the sitar into shoegaze and indie pop in a seamless way that would devalue neither his instrument nor songs. It worked, at least when he committed to it, but there were moments where it would noticeably shield itself with either heavy sitar droning and noodling or with songs like ΓÇ£Bombs Bomb AwayΓÇ¥ that obviously had no place for it at all. While never boring, The Seven Seas also wasnΓÇÖt necessarily convincing that ΓÇ£Hindie rockΓÇ¥ was, or should be, an actual thing. Elephant Stone responds to this directly.

Whether by design or not, itΓÇÖs appropriate that DhirΓÇÖs second album is the self-titled one; at the very least, it provides a much clearer answer to the essential question of what heΓÇÖs out to accomplish with Elephant Stone than itΓÇÖs predecessor did. DhirΓÇÖs sitar is even more of a constant, but itΓÇÖs used primarily to richen his psych rock arrangementsΓÇÖ tones than to simply replace guitar leads. Opener ΓÇ£Setting SunΓÇ¥ recalls ΓÇ£DonΓÇÖt Fear the ReaperΓÇ¥ with breezed-out underlying reverb ΓÇô and hey look, lyrics about new beginnings too (ΓÇ£A setting sun is not an endingΓÇ¥, ΓÇ£rebirth to give new lifeΓÇ¥).

With the exception of the penultimate track ΓÇ£The Sea of Your MindΓÇ¥, a nine-minute sitar-and-percussion attack and incidentally one of the albumΓÇÖs most impressive, the 10 tracks of Elephant Stone are concise, pop song-length statements that more clearly reflect DhirΓÇÖs vision ΓÇô one heΓÇÖs learning how to bring to life.
