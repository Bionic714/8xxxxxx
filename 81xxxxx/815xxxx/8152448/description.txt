A new chapter of the Eisner Award-winning POWERS that sends Deena Pilgrim into the big leagues! Pilgrim is now a federal agent and dealing with the biggest powers cases in the entire country. But will this new life close the closet full of skeletons she carries with her? (Absolutely not!) And what does this mean for her old partner, Walker? This is a bold game-changer for the iconic crime superhero comic that started it all and an amazing jumping-on point for new readers!
