This version of Funny People is a Fan Edit. It effectively removes any and all mentions or appearances of the characters portrayed by Leslie Mann, Eric Bana and Iris/Maude Apatow. The final running time is a brisk and enjoyable 86 minutes, including a couple minutes of credits. The credits are cut off after the first song ends. My great apologizes for the .wmv file format....I am working on converting it into other more accessible formats, but I was curious if there was any interest in this before I bothered to continue to do so. One more thing, you may find that the audio is too low, I also apologize for this problem...simply put your volume up louder than you would normally have it.
