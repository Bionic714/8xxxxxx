Artist: Niveau Zero
Title: In_Sect

Label: Ad Noiseam
Catalog number: adn129d
Release date: May 2010

The first full length album by France's best known dubstep export, "In_Sect" is a boundary-free wild ride through the many forms of modern bass music. Featuring collaborations with such artists as Ben Sharpa, Broken Note, Hecq and The Unik, it is a new statement of Niveau Zero's talent and his take at concert hall-friendly heavy tracks. Heavy dubstep, hip-hop, metal and breaks collide here to form a massive and addictive collection. An ear-opener against musical sectarianism, as well as a perfect album to spin or dance to.

1. In_Sect
2. First (feat. The Unik)
3. My Dog
4. Revolution HXC (feat. Real Fake Mc & Plane Nine)
