Tsukamoto Tenma is young, bright, and smitten with the school hottie Karasuma Ooji. She's desperate for his attention, which is unfortunate considering he barely gives her the time of day! Throw Harima Kenji, the school delinquent with a crush on Tsukamoto into the mix and you've got one twisted love triangle of unrequited proportions! Can love find the trio happiness before their attention-grabbing stunts end up hurting more than their egos?
