Introducing the Theory of Computation is the ideal text for any undergraduate, introductory course on formal languages, automata, and computability. The author provides a concise, yet complete introduction to the important models of finite automata, grammars, and Turing machines, as well as undecidability and the basics of complexity theory. Numerous problems and programming exercises, varying in level of difficulty, round out each chapter and allow students to test themselves on key topics. Answers to selected exercises are included as an appendix and a complete instructor s solutions manual is available on the text s web site.
