Funk-O-Metal Carpet Ride isn't funk/metal in a Red Hot Chili Peppers-like fashion -- rather, the melodic yet aggressive band had more in common with Aerosmith's intense boogie. Combining an Aerosmith-influenced sense of fun with elements of '60s psychedelic rock (including a sitar), the Electric Boys made Carpet one of 1990's most memorable hard rock releases
