,s1raz1,2013-02-22T07:41Z,"i dont think so, the build is from february, the brothers fight bug was on release.
ill DL this after crysis 3, i had a old repack, but it had bugs on some items upgrades fights so i deleted it and since the new builds mess up ur saves game,  ill try to play this one again from scratch."

I have tried mounting with magic iso and also burning with imgburn and neither can read the file"
,kobe11,2013-03-03T07:51Z,"Nevermind.  I thought I had to join the files using hjsplit considering it's .001, .002 etc files but I tried extracting it with WinRAR and now it's good, thanks for the upload."
