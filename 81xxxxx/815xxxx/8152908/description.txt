chapter in the cult  RPG/adventure  saga.  The  new
tale takes place in the familiar world  of  Endoria
featured in the previous games, but begins  in  the
Viking  lands,  which  the  celebrated  hero   Bill
Gilbert never visited during his  famous  quest  in
King's Bounty: The Legend. The Mighty Olaf, son  of
the Konung of Northlings, has dedicated his life to
battling the undead who have infested the  northern
lands of Endoria. He seeks to  liberate  the  snowy
wastes, dwarven dungeons, and  the  very  heart  of
Endoria, the kingdom of  Darion  itself,  from  the
dark grip  of  necromancy.  On  his  quest  towards
immortal glory he will encounter cunning  foes  and
new friends, hard battles and amazing adventures.
