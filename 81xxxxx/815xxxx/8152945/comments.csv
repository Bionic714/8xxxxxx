,muthafock,2013-02-17T12:25Z,Really? Audiosync off with more than half a minute after first break. How 'bout checking the files before posting?
[T],Gondy10,2013-02-17T12:32Z,"Yo dude.. Chill out!!
How about throw you crap computer and buy new one.. This plays perfectly sync with mine..
tsk tsk tsk.."
,muthafock,2013-02-17T14:47Z,"Oh yeah wise ass? Sure it plays fine - UNTIL THE BREAK (7:33). Tried it on two powerful computers. Strange thing that I can play much larger HD files without problems on my ""crap"" computer..."
,vidwyz,2013-02-17T15:05Z,Thanks for this great upload!
[T],Gondy10,2013-02-17T17:08Z,"@muthafock 
Ok honey, I'm sorry for my language earlier.. But honestly, this plays perfectly fine with me..
Sorry mate I can't help you with your problem.
But try watching this with KMPlayer, maybe will fix the problem."
,muthafock,2013-02-17T17:43Z,"Tried VLC, KMPlayer, WMP, WMPC... To no avail."
,klassick,2013-02-17T21:55Z,"you're both right.  The is a brief time when it's out of sync after the first break, but it gets fixed really quickly (the music intro is the worst of it) but the actual competition works perfectly."
[T],Gondy10,2013-02-18T06:52Z,"Yeah, Now I see the glitch after the first break.. didn't noticed that while checking because I keep on skipping the boring parts... But still the competition parts are watchable.

Cheerss..."
,Bren0,2013-02-18T13:23Z,"Hey Mutha, how about showing a little respect and gratitude to Gondy? This dude repeatedly uploads massive amounts of high quality, problem free NBA footage whilst asking nothing in return. 

Problem or no problem, neither give you an excuse to forget your manners and humility. 

Gondodon, just remember, 99% of the leechers who do not convey their thanks via a comment are thanking you internally. Your time and effort does certainly not go unappreciated. 

Cheers bro and please accept my thanks on behalf of everyone else!! "
[T],Gondy10,2013-02-18T14:46Z,"@Bren0
Very well said mate.. Thanks.."
,Bren0,2013-02-18T15:08Z,"Anytime brahhh. 

Let's hope it's better received than the last time I attempted to convey my displeasure in a civilised manner regarding someone's comments: http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7194833/NBA.2012.Reg.S.(17_april).BOS.Celtics.vs.NY.Knicks.720p

haha, always have a chuckle when I occasionally re-read it. "
[T],Gondy10,2013-02-18T16:44Z,"@Bren0
Oh my, I just ignore those kind of people (you know who) :D. Just enjoy life..
Cheers.."
