The Paranormal Project S01E00 xvid avi - USA Ghost Hunting Series (2013)


converted tnes mp4 source to xvid 360p mp3 cbr 128 1000BR opti headers for sony tv 2012


I different kind of ghost hunting show.. where they give the gear to the
home users to try to document their own hauntings rather then
professionals doing it
there is a FB for the show visit there for more info at theparanormalproject

seems to be a one-off episode.. which one might call a pilot
I guess if ratings good enough it develop into a pilot season?

Help to SEED as Im out of data and its costing extra now :/
