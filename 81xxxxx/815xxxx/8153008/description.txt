Description
-----------

This is Prison Island, running in the Unity engine, circa August 2012. It is being released as the first public demo of the The Starry Expanse. It is still definitely a work in progress, and therefore not necessarily representative of the final product.

This is a DEMO, not a BETA TEST. To clarify: we are not seeking feedback on this build of the game, we are simply sharing some of our work with
the public. Enjoy!
