It was directed by Kenji Mizoguchi and is based on stories in Ueda Akinari's book of the same name. Set in AzuchiΓÇôMomoyama period Japan, it stars Masayuki Mori and Machiko Ky┼ì. It is one of Mizoguchi's most celebrated films, regarded by critics as a masterwork of Japanese cinema[1] and a definitive piece during Japan's Golden Age of Film.[2] Along with Akira Kurosawa's 1950 film Rashomon, Ugetsu is credited with having popularized Japanese cinema in the West
