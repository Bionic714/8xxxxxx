Hi Gang, download this and open it in any text editor, or better still Microsoft Excel or any spreadsheet and you will see what this collection will offer over the next 7 to 14 days.   I have made this series of torrents up as I am rather upset at the Karaoke providers, many of whom refuse to service us with machine readable files from legal download sites.   I have spend many many many hours editing this:

SCK1089001_1-2000_Green Green Grass Of Home - Jones, Tom.mp3
SCK1089001_1-2000_Green Green Grass Of Home - Jones, Tom.cdg

To:

Tom Jones - Green Green Grass Of Home [Karaoke].mp3
Tom Jones - Green Green Grass Of Home [Karaoke].cdg

And converting the MP3 tags to read the same and Artiste - Filename

So you have nothing to do and once and for all this nonsense file names people are posting can become history for those who do not play Karaoke from CD's or DVD's any more!
