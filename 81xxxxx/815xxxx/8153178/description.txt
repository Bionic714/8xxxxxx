Carnivale.S02E08.720p.WEBRip.H264-DRAWER


Resolution..: 1280x720
Audio.......: AC3 5.1 384k
Subs........: English (CC-lower) / English (CC-Orig) / English (Vobsubs)

This is basically similiar to what's been done for years on Pee2Pee and known as WEB-DL. 

Native HD video downloaded from iTunes with the DRM and metadata stripped and remuxed 
into .mkv container. Video/Audio are untouched. There is absolutely no point to reencode
as the source is progressive and the file sizes are very "affordable". That's also the 
reason for H264 tag and not x264. 


The Good: Most of TV shows never see a Blu-Ray release. This is the closest thing
          you'd get to a retail HD release. HDTV 720p caps are not regularly archived on many 
          sites and they have the all "issues" of a TV cap - screen spam from network, occasional
          issues such as airing compression artifacts, encode filtering issues, no end credits
          and so on. 

The Bad: 1) Go prove you didn't just leech it off a Pee2Pee and scene'd it.
         2) No rules
         3) No site sections
         4) Low tradability.

Best way we thought of to work around "The Bad 1)" is a screenshot of our iTunes queue as it's downloading
the set. Seems like a decent proof we spent our hard earned money on the atrocity that is iTunes, fruit of 
the devil's spawn (aka crApple).

Why bother? Everyone likes high res and so do we. We are aiming at shows we like and don't 
have high res copies of. In this instance, both seasons of Carnivale never had 720p caps
in the english scene and unlikely to ever see a Blu-Ray release. 

We ripped the CC that come with the iTunes vid but they turned out to be shit, so we used our NTSC 
copy. There are 3 options: 1) Closed Captions processed to lower case (with upper case at the beginning
of sentences, sadly it also does it for names but we find upper case very annoying). 2) lower case 
original (upper case for all dialogs and lower case for captions) 3) Vobsubs. 



"After the ball is over,
After the break of morn 
After the dancers' leaving;
After the stars are gone;
Many a heart is aching,
If you could read them all;
Many the hopes that have vanished
After the ball."
