,marvelnerd76,2013-02-17T16:55Z,Very cool! I hope he survives Avengers Arena. Great character. Hey by any chance do you have or know of a link to a higher quality scan of Grant Morrison and Frank Quitely's New X-Men run? Love that run but everything I have seen is kinda low res. Just wonderin. 
,binderguy1,2013-02-18T00:29Z,"Thanks for the ul.
I was wondering, if you're planning to ul the other Marvel Tsunami titles; is there any chance of you ul Runaways vol. 3 (2008)?
I managed to find the first two volumes.
Mystique and Human Torch has proven a bit difficult."
,LyokoMx,2013-02-18T11:51Z,Thanks!

you're all welcome. marvelnerd76, 'cause i refuse to acknowledge avengers arena, i can't tell you that juston and his sentinel are unceremoniously killed/destroyed in issue 3 in yet another asinine ""shock value"" plot twist. dennis hopeless has landed on my shitty-marvel-writers-who-waste-good-characters-and-script-pointless-death-scenes list -- at #2. (i'm looking at you, dan slott.) darkhawk also died that month. but if i ever admit to reading arena, i'd bitch about that!  :-P

END SPOILERS

marvelnerd76, i don't have good scans of morrison's new x-men -- just the old scans. love the run, though, so i'll look for some!

binderguy1, i didn't plan to do more Tsunami, but i'll have some time later today so i'll see what i can find."
,marvelnerd76,2013-02-18T19:13Z,Avengers Arena must be retconned!! That's terrible! I'm glad I haven't read any of that series! What is wrong with Marvel? First Octo-Spidey now this? Ugh
