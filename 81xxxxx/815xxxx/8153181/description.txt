A nurse starts speaking English when she is nervous. A translator compromises her integrity when translating bad novel. A woman turns down a million-crown inheritance because of pride. Three women all have a small soft spot in their personality, and are hit hard when their idiosyncrasies meet the light of day. A tragic comedy about the human factor.
