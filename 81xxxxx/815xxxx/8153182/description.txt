RE SEED damaged Archive:

Please don't worry about seeding to a 1 to 1 Ratio.   Just clear your Bit torrent client of all other downloads and uploads and leave just 1 seed, or at busy (peak network congestion) times NO SEEDS and we will get along just fine.   Don't worry I have a very fast seed box to look after part 1 and you will need ALL YOUR BANDWIDTH over the next 7 days or so to grab this 100GB collection.   I am having difficulty posting the track listing here, so see the torrent text file for what is in the Archive.  I will post the entire collection as a CSV file you can read in any text editor or spreadsheet today so you will know what is coming up over the next week or two.   The speed of the next part being posted depends on your download speed, so crack on.  I will try post the tracks for this torrent here, if you don't see the listing below the file is too large for the Pirate Bay software to post:

Please see torrent file for track details.  Cheers.
