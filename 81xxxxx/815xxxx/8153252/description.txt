I Didn't Know That
Industrial scientists Richard Ambrose and Jonny Phillips find extraordinary facts behind ordinary everyday objects. I Didn't Know That, an action-packed series exposes little-known facts about ordinary items we take for granted. From airbags to teabags, toothpaste to tea, and condoms to crash helmets, each episode is a mind-blowing cavalcade of crazy demonstrations and rarely-heard info about everyday stuff.
Follow presenters Richard Ambrose and Jonny Phillips - two bona fide industrial scientists with an insatiable thirst for knowledge - on their quest to investigate how things are made, what's inside them, how they are tested and how they work.

10)  Plastic 
Our duo examine the pros and cons of plastic including Bakelite, celluloid and Kevlar used in anti-stab material. Then there's Teflon, this slippy plastic isn't just used in frying pans, it's also used for sledges, so the lads head to a ski slope to test its effectiveness. Using his angle grinder, Jonny attempts to see if it's true that golf balls contain elastic bands. Meanwhile, on an investigation into the history of the humble brick, Richard meets a brickie who can lay 350 bricks per hour and attempts the sport of brick throwing. Finally, we visit a newspaper printing plant too see how 4.4 million papers are rolled off the press each week.
