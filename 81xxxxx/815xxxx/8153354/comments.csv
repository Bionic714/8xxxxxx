,ThaMunsta,2013-02-17T14:26Z,I wish my TV supported it. I actually avoided buying a 3D tv because I never thought I would use it. It would be cool to try this out

,aady91,2013-02-17T16:06Z,Soory for the stupid question but can anyone tell movie can i watch a 3d movie on a normal laptop.Does it show the real 3d effect or i need to watch it some other player?
,iSharted,2013-02-17T16:15Z,"Thank you so much for all the great 3D releases YIFY, keep it up!!!"
[T],dylanlutchman,2013-02-17T21:33Z,@aady91 you need a 3D screen and glasses :D
,Jojo1980,2013-02-18T06:24Z,"Before you ask, yes you need a 3d tv with glasses i prefer active or computer, why is the picture side by side? because it is meant to be shown in 3d, on your tv go to 3d mode and silect side by side and your good"
,SlothTerror,2013-02-18T10:51Z,"Thanks YIFI,3D movies are pretty expensive here in Australia and other 3D torrents are over 10gb.So again,thanks YIFI."
,kenasona,2013-02-19T07:01Z,"@aady91, search TBP for 'Stereoscopic player'. You'll watch the movie normally but without the 3D."
,Olevita,2013-02-20T20:41Z,"Hello, I have a LG 3D TV, these films usually work or not? SBS are or not? Thank you."
,gungrave4ever,2013-02-27T17:30Z,"Does anyone know how do I get Stereoscopic Player to merge the 3D movies?  Every 3D movie I try to play with Stereoscopic Player shows two images like this.

I need to be able to watch it interlaced/polarized because my 3D monitor is a HP 2311 GT.

Thanks."
,xxhaimbondxx,2013-03-23T22:15Z,"YIFY, your 3d rips are awesome. Just dled 2 in a few minutes for my kids to watch.  Quick question: are these real 3d blu ray rips or a blu ray with some kind of a 3d software addition.  The reason I'm asking is while the quality of your rips are great, I'm curious if my TV is working to its full 3d potential, if it makes any sense."
,xxhaimbondxx,2013-03-23T22:24Z,"gungrave4ever, there are a lot of different ways to play 3d in the player. TV's are pretty simple, I just press the 3D button, however, software is more complicated. You have to play around with the VIEW menu in the player. "
