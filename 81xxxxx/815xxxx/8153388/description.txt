Information
------------------------------

Life after death is an important element of many religions. Dead bodies were embalmed and mummified and, depending on the wealth of the deceased, equipped with both utility articles and precious ritual objects. When you think of a mummy what comes to mind? Most of us usually picture an Egyptian mummy wrapped in bandages and buried deep inside a pyramid. While the Egyptian ones are the most famous, mummies have been found in many places throughout the world. Mummies have a lot to tell us about the times and places in which they lived. Their bodies can tell us how long they lived, and the diseases and injuries they suffered from. In this series Dr. Bob Brier, whose work usually involves Egyptian archeology, follows an Italian team into the crypt of the Florentine family the Medicis and also investigates the biblical legend of the Three Wise Men.




4)  Bonus Program : Lost Mummy of Imhotep 
At the dawn of Egyptian civilization, Imhotep built the first pyramid, became legendary as a physician, and governed the greatest state on earth. The ancients made him a god. Then Hollywood made him "The Mummy." Today, Egyptologists may have found his tomb, and it could be the greatest discovery of the 2Oth century. By now, millions of people around the world know the name of Imhotep, the Egyptian high priest who turned into 'The Mummy.'
