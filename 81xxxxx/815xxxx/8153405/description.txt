If you aren't familiar with NERD's ebooks, sample a single day from a smaller, more recent torrent by setting other files in the torrent to Priority "do not download".

The complete collection from 2003 through 2012 contains over 300,000 ebooks, is over 234GB RAR'd, would be double that otherwise and will not be posted in any other format.

These torrents are an expression of appreciation to the NERD's for making all these wonderful ebooks available, providing missing and broken files as needed and giving me their blessing to redistribute them here.

These torrents are being posted anonymously via VPN for obvious reasons.  If these reasons aren't obvious to you, then you shouldn't be torrenting.

2008 and 2010 will be posted out of order.
