Your welcome :-)"
,keywest33,2013-02-17T15:25Z,Yo
,keywest33,2013-02-17T15:28Z,Just spent hours cleaning up after Nero 11 had to use windows tool and uninstall every bit one at a time (never again) Nero would not even get back to me so had to work it out for myself.
,keywest33,2013-02-17T15:40Z,Even after install the wins installer pops up asking for nero cd
,keywest33,2013-02-17T15:41Z,AFTER UNINSTALL--sorry
[V],2010kaiser,2013-02-17T16:01Z,@keywest33That's strange. I tested NERO on two separate rigs 32bit + 64bit and had no problems. I'll look into it later when i have time and if there's an issue. I'll have the torrent removed.
,keywest33,2013-02-17T16:24Z,"@2010kaiser,
                    I was not referring to any torrent of yours just nero 11 in general.(trial etc) as they do not have a cleanup tool as was case with 7-8 etc"
,keywest33,2013-02-17T17:22Z,Seems Ahead Nero does not like you to uninstall the product
,fabasee6624,2013-02-17T22:13Z,Thanks Bro! works perfect..

[V],2010kaiser,2013-02-18T02:25Z,"@jacob5800

Serial Key. Not a KeyGen??? WTF are you talking about??"
,Piribucz,2013-03-26T16:23Z,"Works fine! Thank you!
By the way, I agree with keywest33 about Nero. It was a great software ages ago, but now it's too much. Too much for me, and for my PC.
Thanks again for this release!"
,scarpelli65,2013-03-30T06:53Z,are you fucking kidding me???? Why are you asking for a password??? You should have posted thast it needs a password
,scarpelli65,2013-03-30T06:58Z,Are you fucking kidding me??? Why upload a torrent without telling people that you NEED  a password????
