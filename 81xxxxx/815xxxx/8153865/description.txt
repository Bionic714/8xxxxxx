Rush

Gabe, Jace, and Ash: three of the wealthiest, most powerful men in the country. TheyΓÇÖre accustomed to getting anything they want. Anything at all. For Gabe, itΓÇÖs making one particular fantasy come true with a woman who was forbidden fruit. Now sheΓÇÖs ripe for the pickingΓÇª

When Gabe Hamilton saw Mia Crestwell walk into the ballroom for his hotelΓÇÖs grand opening, he knew he was going to hell for what he had planned. After all, Mia is his best friendΓÇÖs little sister. Except sheΓÇÖs not so little anymore. And Gabe has waited a long time to act on his desires.

Gabe has starred in MiaΓÇÖs fantasies more than once, ever since she was a teenager with a huge crush on her brotherΓÇÖs best friend. So what if GabeΓÇÖs fourteen years older? Mia knows heΓÇÖs way out of her league, but her attraction has only grown stronger with time. SheΓÇÖs an adult now, and thereΓÇÖs no reason not to act on her most secret desires.

As Gabe pulls her into his provocative world, she realizes thereΓÇÖs a lot she doesnΓÇÖt know about him or how exacting his demands can be. Their relationship is intense and obsessive, but as they cross the line from secret sexual odyssey to something deeper, their affair runs the risk of being exposedΓÇöand vulnerable to a betrayal far more intimate than either expected.
