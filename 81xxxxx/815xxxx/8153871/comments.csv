,Stemborer,2013-02-25T16:48Z,"hey guys can anyone help me when i try to install the patch it always say ""Could not retrieve installation folder! Installation will be aborted. and it didn't even let me choose my installation folder it just decides by itself "
,Marcus101RR,2013-03-08T19:19Z,"WARNING: Can't get passed Sequence 7 ""Talk to James Bennett"". It will crash right after you watch the cutscene and then corrupt the save. This needs to be fixed."
,ChocolateAddict,2013-03-17T05:49Z,"I seriously don't understand the reason for all this BS. Does it work or not? If it does, tell us exactly how to install it. ""Previous updates may need to be installed"" Are you f--king serious?! You don't even know how to install your patch right? Next time, test it before you upload it, dumbass."
,ChocolateAddict,2013-03-19T00:21Z,"OK, so I got the game to work. First install skidrow's ac3 game. Don't apply any cracks from there. Then instal update 1.02 from skidrow, again don't apply any cracks just yet. Finally, install this update and copy the cracks that are in THIS update first to the install location. Then go back to 1.02 update from skidrow and copy the uplay crack files (a whole bunch of them) from that 1.02 update ONLY. DO NOT copy the game's crack files from update 1.02, ONLY the uplay crack files. then you block these .exe files in your firewall (Uplay.exe, UbisoftGameLauncher, AC3MP.exe, AC3SP.exe, AssassinsCreed3.exe) and you're done. game should launch."
,ChocolateAddict,2013-03-19T00:25Z,"just to clarify, the uplay crack files in update 1.02 should be in a folder called 'orbit.' copy those files only, don't copy any other files from 1.02."
,iadityam,2013-03-29T16:35Z,I'm having an error patching the sounds_ger.pck file in the pc folder in sounddata in multi. can anyone please upload just that particular file updated of v1.02
,ferrazrafael,2013-04-22T17:38Z,"the crack from this update is a trojan horse. I send 'ubiorbitapi_r2_loader.dll' to Avira for a analysis for false positive and they comfirm it was a Trojan Horse, not only a crack. Its a TR/Black.Gen2.

Install the update but dont use this crack. Update AC3 to v1.04. Skidrow update to 1.04 here on PB is working and doesnt have a Trojan Horse"
,mtmo9889,2013-05-03T16:10Z,"it works fine, but my save game (theta crack) is gone i know where it is but where is reloaded saves location, there is no orbit/54 in ub launcher folder."
