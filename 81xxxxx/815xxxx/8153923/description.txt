  Atlanta-based trio All the Saints derive their sound from blues-rock, psychedelia, and early heavy metal. Titus, Matt, and Jim, who prefer to go by first names only, met in Alabama but later relocated to Atlanta. After several months of jam sessions, All the Saints hit upon a sound they described as "70s psychedelia and classic dark riffs." Intense live shows led to a passionate regional fan base and critical acclaim. In 2007, All the Saints began working on an EP with Billy Bennett, the engineer who had recorded the Whigs' debut album.
