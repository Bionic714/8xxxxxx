This version has a different Scheduled task name. Make sure you correctly
remove previous versions before installing this.

2nd one is my personal repack using all of the settings from heldigard's
release except the kmseldi /music call. NoSound version
is a little faster because it doesn't wait on the sound to finish.
My versions are just 7z sfx programs and do not have proper uninstall.
Use the Uninstall-KMSpico.cmd script I included to remove task and
delete directory when you are done with it.

OEM is just an oem folder you can toss in your sources directory
if you know what you're doing. Don't bother if you don't know what
it is.

KMSpico is an Offline KMS Activator that emulates a KMS server in the memory of
your computer and sends activation data back and forth attempting to activate
volume versions of Windows and Office. Heldigard has built on CODYQX4's
amazing work from MS Toolkit 2.4 where mikmik38 and CODYQX4 made an emulated
KMS activation program without the use of a Virtual Machine.

KMSnano was GREAT. KMSpico is even BETTER, SMALLER, FASTER.
You should always check for the latest version before using.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Activates:
Windows Vista Business/Enterprise Default/N/VL
Windows 7 Pro/Enterprise Default/N/VL
Windows 8 Pro/Enterprise Default/N/VL
Windows Server Std/Data 2008/2008R2/2012
Office/OfficeVL 2010/2013.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------Please read this non-KMS Windows versions list-------
Retail-Only Versions of windows that will **NOT** activate are:
Vista Starter/Homebasic/Homepremium/Ultimate - Default/N/E
7 Starter/Homebasic/Homepremium/Ultimate - Default/N/E
8 core/coreN/ProWMC*
----------Again, those versions will NEVER support KMS activation---
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Core, ProWMC, and WServer support is in this, but it resets to
30 day renewable activation since they don't natively support KMS.
This, and the new low activation time, are the reason for daily re-activation.

Requirements: . NET 4.0 or Windows 8

Instructions:
1. Extract the zip file or run the associated exe from file explorer.
2. Run the corresponding kmspico exe setup file.
3. The NoSound activation is about 4 seconds, I think the sound ver is like 7ish
(It takes longer for Retail to VL Office or Windows conversions)
4. Done. Go about your business.

-Every version of this setup will install the task to re-run every time you
log on your computer. You can remove it by running taskschd.msc /s and
deleting the KMS Activation task. If you do this for my nosound repack,
you will need to create a new shortcut to pass the arguments /mtk /silent /log

-For Windows 8, it can take a minute or two of doing system things for the
watermark to go away. You don't need to reboot. Activators that require
a reboot are hacks and you should immediately run a "SFC /SCANNOW" if
you have used one. (SFC is the System File Checker) Esp. KJ Hacktivator
You CAN reboot if you want to, it's just not necessary for activation.

Note that Pre-Release versions of Office or Windows will NEVER activate.
I highly recommend just getting a proper release. I have tons of them.

Why use this program over any other activation method?
-It does not modify any of your system files.
-Because it's not a crack or a hack.
-Because it's the only way to get legit activation without using legit servers.
-Did I mention it activates ALL KMS activation software?

Change Log from KMSpico v2:
- Installer added since initial v2
- Removed TriggerKMS.
- Add /task flag to KMSELDI.
- Auto Task "KMS Activation" for activation every reboot without backup and sound.
- Add $OEM$ folder only to be included inside of Windows *.iso install.

murphy's note-heldigard added an oem folder for the sound version that installs 
automatically, however it still passes the /music argument to the kmseldi program,
invoking the star-trek sound-effects. While he works out the kinks in that you can
use my OEM folder. It doesn't have the Setup stuff passed through the registry for
uninstall program, but I have added my usual Uninstall-KMSpico.cmd changed to
accomodate the new KMS Activation trigger name removal.

All is Done (for now).

Recommendations:

- Disable SmartScreen.
- Disable Microsoft Security Updates.
- Make exceptions to KMSELDI.exe in Antivirus.

Only known issue I spotted was that the /task option does not work during windows
setup, requiring you to import xml to schedule a task manually. I know AutoKMS
from MTK 2.4 works during setup. I'll let heldigard know and maybe he can rework
his trigger coding a bit. It's his program though, he will do whatever he wants :P

If you bug anyone at MDL, bug me before heldigard please. His primary language
is not English, and I, or many others in the KMS Host and Tools v3.0 thread
can help you just fine. Your KMSpico.log is in the KMSpico directory in
Program Files.
