THx haloReD.

V9/A7

All there is to the Audio is an accident that seemed to have happened to the original ripper between 00:45 and 02:15 - he must have accidently pulled the line-cable which made the computer switch to mic input, he realized it one and a half minutes later, so no biggie at all ;).
The quality is acceptable, either there was no time or the ripper was rather unexperienced.

Seriously, you spoiled kids, that start whining the second something is not right and then don't even take the few more seconds you would need to check out the problem in order to confirm what you originally thought was wrong, you are the reason this world is going to waste :P!"

Please ignore my previous comments as i reviewed the wrong movie.

V/8
A/5

As noted by many the first 2 minutes is barely audible. I think @manOtor hit it on the head about the audio cord being in the wrong slot. The audio went out of sync about two thirds the way through the movie and kept jumping pretty much through till the end. Also, there were a few instances where the movie skipped briefly forwards and back, only by a second or so so it was more like a stutter. For the most part the picture was dvd quality. 

Overall and until a DvdRip/BluRayRip comes out this is the best going around. 

Cheers"
,BlackandBad,2013-02-19T01:14Z,"Audio in first 2 min is terrible, but then it becomes better, overall its worth the download

addition.... there seem to be some weird bugs in the movie...i saw two of them around 40:43...and again at the end

audio also goes out of sync by like an 8th of a second now and then"

,a2dogs222,2013-02-20T00:42Z,"Same prob as all the other ""screeners""of this wonderful  movie. Cam audio to 00:02:16. Some sync probs, 9/7."
,neolectric,2013-02-20T10:33Z,"If you have a graphic eq, drop the mids way down to level out the sound.

,teresamungarro,2013-02-20T20:35Z,SOUND IS MESSED UP IN FIRST COUPLE MINUTES BUT FIXES.  IT IS A SCREENER SO IT IS NOT A CAM SO PICTURE IS EXCELLENT.  I HOPE SOMEONE GETS A BETTER COPY SOON.
,slaneesh,2013-02-21T05:31Z,"^^^^ Hit that caps toggle buddy


Audio is a 6, the few audio cut ofs are a minor inconvinience

Video is a 9, 

Movie is an 8 Film which is great for kids, but has the disney style of appealing to adults to, a little cheesy but good humour and some decent to excellent characters keeps the movie going.

Worth the watch "
,TheEmpathicEar,2013-02-21T15:19Z,Anyone know of English subs for this?
,DammDoggs,2013-02-21T18:13Z,Audio is terrible throughout the movie... especially so at the beginning. Video is good though. I DL'd it because I wanted to see it... but I'm going to wait for a better copy to keep.
