This package's goal is to provide a "streamlined" (i.e. PowerPC only) version
of Mac OS X 10.5.8 (last minor release) for Macintosh users who still utilize
PowerPC based Macs.  This is done through the following effort:


1. Install a full version of Mac OS X 10.5
(both Intel and PowerPC code)on a PowerPC based Mac
 
2. Apply all updates available to Mac OS 10.5 as of released 
 date of this package (MacOSX10.5.8)
 
3. Stripping all Intel code from ALL libraries, binaries, etc
(evenatthe Mach/BSDLayer)
 
4. Resetting back to a core install 
 (first time startup on next boot)
 
5. Repackage contents into a compressed archive for distribution.
 
 
 
The end result is a faster, cleaner running Mac OS X 10.5.8 
for use on older PowerPC based Macintosh Systems that can be
imaged over to any support PowerMac/Powerbook G4 or G5 system.
