As el custodio, it's Ruben's duty to keep the Minister of Planning under constant surveillance. Although Ruben must always be present, he must also go completely un-noticed. A shadow, Ruben witnesses everything from the sidelines, as if life was passing by some meters away from him. Yet, despite his insider's view, he never understands clearly what's going on. Single Ruben is hardly even a protagonist of his own lonely life, involving a mentally unstable sister and a ditzy niece, the sale of illegal arms and cheap prostitutes. Plus the monotonous routine of being a bodyguard and the occasional humiliation from the Minister or his family... Some jobs result in almost replacing a life for another. Such pressure can ultimately explode. This is Ruben's inevitable outcome.
