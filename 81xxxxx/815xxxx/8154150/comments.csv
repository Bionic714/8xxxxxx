,slicknick0610,2013-02-18T00:32Z,@Korbendallas email me at slicknick610@yahoo.com if you really want to help. I am using Handbrake which seems to only use 3.2. I also click constant frame rate but when I combine the files with Avidemux it puts VFR.
,hotdogger83,2013-02-18T10:57Z,Thanks for the higher bitrate and 60 fps. :)
,Karkh,2013-02-18T11:49Z,Thanks from Norway! :)
,jeffjonesflorida,2013-02-18T13:25Z,"HD is nice on big screen, but VLC doesn't play these for crap. 30fps is all we need nick
but as always thanks i'd rather watch a choppy pictured race then no race at all"
,atip93,2013-02-18T15:41Z,amazing because in hungary you are not able to watch speed and sx this is the only way to watch so thank you from Hungary! +2
,Korbendallas,2013-02-18T19:16Z,"@slicknick I will!
If your computer doesen't run this.. then it's very old or very weak!
I can even run this on my Win8 Tablet!"
,nectarius,2013-02-18T23:28Z,"I enjoy your work weekly even when I attend some of these events in person. Ever since you made the switch from .mkv to .mp4 encoding my graphics card is choking on the bit rate hard core. I agree its better than nothing, just wanted to add another voice before the next round in Atlanta. Thanks slicknick610."
,hotdogger83,2013-02-20T08:41Z,@jeffjonesflorida: VLC sucks. Try Potplayer. It's much better for HD playback.
