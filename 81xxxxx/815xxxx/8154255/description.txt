New Atheists and the Old Testament God by Jeremiah Johnston:
Jeremiah Johnston (of Christian Thinkers Society) spakes on the New Atheist hatred of the Old Testament God of Christianity. Is God a moral monster? Is He a jealous God? Did God support slavery?

The Death of Darwinism, The New Evolutionism - Soft Tissue Dinosaurs & etc. by Dr. G. Charles Jackson:
