,misterniceguy123,2013-02-17T22:48Z,@Jude_Law try playing it with vlc media player on your computer.
,Jude_Law,2013-02-19T01:38Z,"On PC works just fine with VLC, but on my sony bluray-player the file is corrupt. Other 720p release's of One Piece works perfect on bluray-player, but this one is corrupt!"
