,granytat,2013-02-18T14:53Z,will this work in game ranger as 1.01?
,nauman3,2013-02-20T16:02Z,the game didn't work..i did everything i had to do just like the previous patch that we were supposed to copy and paste the data to the game folder..and i also had the patch1.01 installed
,ImmortalMaiden,2013-02-21T08:31Z,"FIFA doesn't run after patching. I installed a fresh copy of FIFA 11 and patched it (1.01) , cracked it and the did this patch but it doesn't work. Wont run. I'm going back to the old patch with new squads now!"
,nauman3,2013-02-21T13:16Z,what new squads? do you the one after the summer patch ? do tell the link
,tokke001,2013-02-21T20:22Z,"@granytat: yes

there are some problems indeed, we r trying our best to fix it.

- if you use clean install (+ea 1.01), the game wont start--> you need to have the file ""data0.big"": get it from first patch or use a ""fifa 11 regenerator 1.6""
- New music may give some crashes: wait for fix or delete it in the db"
,bwe245,2013-03-07T08:20Z,"Thanks for this nice patch.

Here are some bugs I noticed:
1. Sometimes the game crashes on online mode after selecting a team. maybe it has something to do with the edited kits.

2.Sometimes the game crashes at half times. maybe background pictures or players pictures cause that."

other than that, it works fine 60% of the time. thanks again."
