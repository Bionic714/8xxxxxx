..always you can right click on app and 'show package contenst' and in folder 'resources' you will see folder 'scripts' there you find script what you can view with applescript editor. you will see what that script can do or what for is it 

..or if you don't trust that uploader or you don't know what do do with these files, better don't download :)"
,hybirdd1,2013-02-18T10:52Z,7117 is right :) just click to run and voila. :)
,F89Traktor,2013-02-18T11:22Z,"Thank you guys.
One more question please: Must I do these actions before or after the crossover's first run?
I am asking because I haven't use crossover ever before."
,hybirdd1,2013-02-18T13:17Z,After you have run crossover (don't forget to close it first before applying extender)
,7117,2013-02-18T13:29Z,"..you have two weeks to run script, crossover trial is usually 15 days.

..In comic strips, the person on the left always speaks first  :)"
,F89Traktor,2013-02-18T23:30Z,"Thank you!

,xcenda,2013-02-25T07:52Z,Crossover runs but when I start an app there is a warning about trial expired .....days ago. So is worthless.
