An amazing new perspective on the landscapes and creatures of 
Africa's wildest places.

This is the world's wildest continent as you've never seen it 
before - an intense sensory adventure from the Atlas Mountains, 
through the Savannah lands to the Cape of Good Hope and from the 
Roof of Africa and the Kalahari to where the dark rainforests of 
the Congo meet the Atlantic Ocean. Each episode shifting the focus 
onto a different region as it contrasts the epic power of the 
landscape with the dramatic struggles of individual creatures 
living there.

From hidden jungles and ice-blue glaciers to erupting volcanoes 
and lakes of poison, Africa explores an astonishing array of 
previously un-filmed locations and discovers bizarre new 
creatures and behaviours - including some of the rarest fish 
in the world, exploding insects and lizards that hunt on the 
backs of lions.

This landmark five-part series utilises the latest filming 
technology to reveal the surprising environments, extraordinary 
creatures and other fascinating secrets of an amazing continent.
