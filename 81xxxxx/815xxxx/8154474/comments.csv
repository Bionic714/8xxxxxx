Saw this elsewhere and can say that this move deserves its IMDB rating and then some..

A:9
V:9
M: Ummm how to give this a negative (-) rating??

I would tell people to avoid this but after a few drinks or some bong hits... it's not *that* bad....lol

Regardless, thanks for the up Nobby010, this looks good visually but not even the sons of Pierce Brosnan (James Bond, Remington Steele) and Jon Pertwee (Dr. Who) can save this movie from itself...."
