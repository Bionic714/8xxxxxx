But this is 2013. Use FLAC, I don't understand why you compressed the fuck out of this torrent..and a terrible job indeed..everyone has a quad-core and fast internet now.

Improve a bit before uploading again. Seriously, sad. Thanks!"
,MrThePessimist,2013-03-07T01:29Z,The audio quality kinda suck though :/
,JRobz,2013-03-30T20:06Z,"There is no reason for 98% of the people who download this to waste their hard drive space with uncompressed audio.. that's what CDs are for! Most people can't tell the difference between FLAC and a high quality VBR 0 or 320kbps MP3 rip, especially without the right audio equipment...

Thanks for the upload, but no thanks. How about ripping it in either the highest quality VBR (VBR 0 with slow encoding), or 320CBR please!!! Do us all a favor, OP!  "
