                              Product Description
=================================================================================


Tubular Beats is a remix album featuring collaborations between Mike Oldfield and York (Torsten Stenzel), that was released on 1 February 2013. Unlike with previous club mixes, the album is a true two-sided collaboration between Oldfield and Stenzel, making use of parts from the original multitrack tapes as well as new parts played by Oldfield. It also features Tarja Turunen on the track "Never Too Far".

It was released on Edel in Germany even though Oldfield is currently signed to Universal/Mercury. The album cover features Oldfield's trademark Tubular Bells logo in blue/black on a white background

Mike Oldfield's 1973 classic Tubular Bells set a new precedent for soundtrack music, and walked so many different stylistic lines that it appealed to an enormous cross section of the record-buying public. If the original album flirted with prog rock, new age, neo-classical, and what would become ambient music, it only makes sense that 40 years later Tubular Bells and other early Oldfield material (including "Ommadawn") could be re-imagined as beat-driven electronica with Tubular Beats. Along with an almost 11-minute house remix of "Tubular Bells," the album collects remixes and reinterpretations by both Oldfield himself and producer Torsten "York" Stenzel. Occasional dashes of new age textures and classical guitar pop up amid the cinematic electronics, as on the epic album-opener, "Let There Be Light."
