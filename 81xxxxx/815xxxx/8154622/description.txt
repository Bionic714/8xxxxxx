Streak! The Man Who Can't Keep His Clothes On
Mark Roberts from Liverpool has done the Full Monty over 500 times. Mark, who's 48, is known as 'The Baredevil' and has no wife, no job, no money and - frequently - no clothes. This documentary unearths what has motivated Mark to streak with such extraordinary regularity for the last 20 years and why he is planning his retirement now. From streaking at the Superbowl, to a local building site, the film features extraordinary archive shot throughout his career and remarkable footage as he attempts to make his final streak his best ever. The film is part of Channel 4's critically-acclaimed First Cut strand, which introduces new and diverse directing talent, presenting original and bold documentary films.
