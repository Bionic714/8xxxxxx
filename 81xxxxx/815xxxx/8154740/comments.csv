Second, I´m kind of a tard with comps....How do I copy in the crack?"
,XenonKilla,2013-03-21T23:14Z,"Just a Heads Up!

Every time you save a tag with this cracked version, it automatically puts 

""Tagged by cracked version of Tag&Rename http://www.softpointer.com/tr.htm""

in the tag ""Comment"" field."
,Royalwitcheeez,2013-03-23T06:07Z,"XenonKilla is 100% Correct... 

Will figure out a way to disengage this if not I'll go back to 6.5"
,0p,2013-03-23T16:17Z,Use 3.65 instead

 Every time you save a tag with this cracked version, it automatically puts 

 ""Tagged by cracked version of Tag&Rename http://www.softpointer.com/tr.htm""

 in the tag ""Comment"" field.

Its seems to be hardcoded in the software or the crack!"
,XenonKilla,2013-05-10T07:38Z,"Along with my previous comment, I have found this other version that works perfect and doesn't leave any bullshit in the COMMENT field of the tag...
