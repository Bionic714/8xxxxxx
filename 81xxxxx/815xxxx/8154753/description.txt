AnyDVD is a Windows software that removes the restrictions of DVD, Blu-ray and HD DVD media automatically in the background and transparently enable read access of the contents of a movie as soon as it’s inserted into the drive. The DVD, Blu-ray or HD DVD will become useable to your windows operating system and all programs on your computer, such as DVD/Blu-Ray Backup software. AnyDVD optionally disables the RPC region codes, thereby making the movie region free and comfortably viewable on any stationary domestic player and with any media player software. AnyDVD is capable of disabling unwanted movie features such as forced subtitles, forced delays, and no-skip marks, giving you full control over your movie experience. It also allows you to launch an external application whenever you insert or remove a disc, and prevents unwanted software like ‘PC-friendly’ from automatically launching when you insert a video DVD/Blu-Ray.

Decryption is not all that AnyDVD offers. You can control the drive speed of your DVD drive, allowing you to reduce the noise level when watching movies on your PC. You can even adjust the display frequency of your monitor for both NTSC and PAL displays.
But AnyDVD doesn’t just stop at DVDs. It also decrypts protected audio CDs to allow you to copy them.
