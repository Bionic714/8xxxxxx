Richard Hammond gets behind the wheel of the Mastretta MXT, but worries about the repercussions of a comment he made in a previous episode about Mexico, the sports car's country of manufacture. Plus, three high-performance hatchbacks are driven with gusto around the test track, and Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton - who has switched from McLaren to Mercedes for the 2013 season - gets a second chance to smash the lap record.
