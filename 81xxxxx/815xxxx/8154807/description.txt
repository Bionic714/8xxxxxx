Widespread Panic
Ten Mile High Room
Breckenridge, CO
1996-01-22

DSBD &gt; CDR &gt; EAC &gt; SHN &gt; Flac8

SBE's fixed

There's a matrix version out there, but despite my preference for Matrix shows, the DSBD here sounds better in my opinion.  You can faintly hear the crowd, but it's just from the mics.  Crispy-sounding show for sure!  Enjoy!
