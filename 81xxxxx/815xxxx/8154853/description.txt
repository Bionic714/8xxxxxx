Call Of Duty Modern Warfare 3 (BLUS30838) Fix 3.41-3.55 Update Patch 1.23 - LeatherHead N0DRM Repacks (10-13-12)


I've tested the update and it works without problems.
I have Call.of.Duty.Modern.Warfare.3.PROPER.PS3-DUPLEX (BLUS30838) and it's working like a charm! I've 3.55... (The PARAM.SFO is 3.55...)

This is how I did it:


1. If you don't have the original files in your PS3_GAME (BLUS30838) map change them with the "Original Files" that come with this files.

2. Remove all update data from Call Of Duty Modern Warfare 3 (BLUS30838) (Not your savings!)

3. Download and install 1.19-1.23 Updates from MM - multiMAN. Or through the links available in the NFO file. (Click on the game in MM. "Options" and then "Update". Go to XMB Menu and to "Install Package Files")

4. After installing 1.19-1.23 Updates you install "Patch Fix UP0002-BLUS30838_00-MW3P000000000123-A0123-V0100.pkg".

And that's it! Enjoy!
