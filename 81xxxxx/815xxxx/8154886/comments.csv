,Shah_Jahan,2013-02-18T07:19Z,"Request: [Android App] Wiki Encyclopedia Offline WITH database.
The entire English Language Wikipedia (3.8 million articles) on your Android Phone!

Official Site: http://www.bitmagictech.com/
Google Play Link: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.bitmagic.wiki.offline&hl=en

It requires only and ONLY WiFi to download the database of 5.2 GB. I am from India and here WiFi is a very rare thing. I wish to use this offline encyclopedia, but unfortunately I cannot due to WiFi restrictions.

I use a Chrome extension called APK Downloader 1.4.0 and use it to download .apk files from my PC and then install it on my phone. This is because of Wifi and 3G restrictions (unavailability) in most parts of India.

Can someone kindly create an APK file along with the database that can be downloaded on PC and then installed on Phone? OR Provide the apk file and database separately so that it can be installed and then copy-paste the database in given folder?

This will really help those who are in a dilemma like me. Hoping for a positive reply.

Thank you very VERY much. "
