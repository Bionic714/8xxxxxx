,Sonic_27,2013-02-18T03:11Z,"What happen to the first So called Dell Windows 8 torrent, this one is a lot smaller?? The last torrent needed a Dell Key and wasn't in the torrent! This one I don't know...."
,pandy90,2013-02-18T03:44Z,"@Sonic_27

These are original, untouched windows dell disks. The Product key is built into the bios, therefore if you did not have Windows 8/7 pre-installed when you purchased the DELL computer, then it will not work. DO NOT DOWNLOAD IF YOU DON'T HAVE A CLUE WHAT IT'S FOR!"
,pandy90,2013-02-18T03:46Z,"Only use this Windows 7 iso if you have a Dell computer that came pre-installed with Windows 7 Home Premium (x64).

Only use the Windows 8 iso if you have a Dell computer that came pre-installed with Windows 8 (x64)

If not, it will not work without a product key. If you still don't understand then you most likely don't need to download it."
,Sonic_27,2013-02-18T06:14Z,ok...just wondering that's all. Murphy78 windows 8 torrents are the BEST anyways! Good luck on this torrent =)
,pandy90,2013-02-18T10:58Z,"Well good for Murphy76. I'll repeat, this is for Dell users only."
,jacob5800,2013-02-18T21:29Z,"you are wright about youre windows 7 if it was preinstall it will work for dell pc  inspiron which i have done this way, will work  thanks anyway"
,makdakas,2013-02-18T22:14Z,"Dear Pandy90, i've noticed that you have some windows for Dell pc's an I would like to ask if you have a Dell dedicated Win 7 ultimate or professional? Would it work if activated later with Daz loader as I got my Inspiron with linux :D ? "
,Shoobox,2013-03-02T16:10Z,"Pre-install doesn't matter FYI.

If your bios has above SLIC 2.1, then it will activate an OEM  dell, hp ,so forth OS.
If you you PC doesn't have an SLIC 2.0 then you will need to use an activation method.
I have used my OEM Win7 disks on pc that have had pre-installed vista and my Win7 installed and worked fine."
,Shoobox,2013-03-02T16:12Z,"Now mind you people you still can't use a dell os on a hp os, Dell would still have to be used with Dell. and hp with hp"
,dreadpiraterobert,2013-03-16T22:56Z,Can I load this on to a USB drive (then loading it on to my Dell) instead of burning it to a DVD?
,Julm666,2013-03-30T18:33Z,"hey pandy90,why this home network not working,internet cannot access,what is drivers???"
,Julm666,2013-03-30T18:34Z,"this is work,but internet access not available"
,dynasty247,2013-04-13T10:55Z,Oddly I have the original Win 7x64 Home Premium Disk and it is 5+GB not 3.51GB.
