Casual sex. Eating Disorders. Bizarre hazing rituals. All horrible, slanderous stereotypes associated with sorority sisters. And all sadly true. Modern sorority life deserves a serious, sensitive and mature depiction. Thankfully, that's not what HAZED is about. HAZED is a dark comedy about three young girls' perilous journey through the world of sororities and eating disorders. From the creator of the critically acclaimed GROUNDED, HAZED is to comics what "Heathers" and "Mean Girls" are to film, only smarter, meaner and funnier.
