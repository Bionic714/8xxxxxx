,Connyswaysway,2013-02-18T02:06Z,"Hah no problem. I wish I could upload it faster.
I hope it makes it easier to use the mods."
,markofbear,2013-02-18T02:46Z,"Had actually just downloaded a mod pack with this content, but it was hugely outdated so this came in the nick of time so to speak :)"
,Iztok67,2013-02-18T05:53Z,Thank you!
[T],Huggybaby,2013-03-03T01:25Z,"Thanks for this updated torrent to use with GOG. A couple of the most important mods can't be downloaded from the original site or mirrors. Maybe they are overloaded but I'm also in a really bad download location right now.

Torrents are so robust it's awesome.

I wish all the mods weren't stuck into one RAR though, so I could pick and choose.

Thanks again!"
[T],Huggybaby,2013-03-03T01:28Z,"PS I don't know if SS2Tool v5 does anything. It seems to download New Dark 2.4, which is unnecessary with the GOG version. Then if you run the tool again, it downloads ND 2.4 again?

So, I'm suspicious if it patches anything. "
[T],Huggybaby,2013-03-04T21:40Z,"Well I guess the SS2 Tool does actually do something. Still hunting for some of these files in original format.

Thanks for the package!"
,Connyswaysway,2013-03-07T05:22Z,"@Huggybaby: yeah, it was (I hesitate to call it this) a design decision to combine everything. I had been seeing an inordinate amount of people have an oddly difficult time figuring out how to patch and mod the game, so I just tried to make it a simple, singular drag and drop affair (as much as possible). 

Unfortunately, the file structure precluded me from separating the mods into their individual files while keeping it as simple as possible. It isn't the way I prefer, but it filled the need. Also, I truly think out of all the different mods and whatever, these combined end up making the best version of System Shock 2 around.

I totally realize that some people would want individual files, but this was for people who wanted to experience a damn cool game with the tiniest amount of fuss.

If you're still trying to find some individual mods, you can start with this thread:
http://www.systemshock.org/index.php?topic=4447.0

And, I believe SS2Tool checks online first before seeing if you have the other install files, or it might be the other way around, I don't remember. Either way, if you were offline, it would read from the provided folder. 

Cheers and good luck!"

You know, I wish TPB had a way of notifying me when comments are replied to. Demonoid had that feature.

Your torrent is the best way for a noob to start, for sure. I'm about to upload a torrent which will complement yours, because I left everything separate. Organizing took some time...how to avoid confusion? Multiple folders make extracting a pain.

In your torrent take a look at Comp 1_2 snd.avi. I don't know if it will work being named like that, and in that location.

Also, savant has uploaded his cutscenes again, he says they're a tiny bit better than the ones he had up before, which have disappeared.

Ans I'm sure you know ADaOB-v030 is about to get an update. But I couldn't wait for it.

Thanks again for the torrent and the inspiration."
[T],Huggybaby,2013-03-07T10:54Z,"PS It's understandable why people are confused! Wrong install information abounds due to the recent changes. Even procedures from a few weeks ago are wrong, since SSTool has been updated."
