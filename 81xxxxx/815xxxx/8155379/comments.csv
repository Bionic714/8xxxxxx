This was uploaded 2 days before the official release, it's only a leak. Of course it's not going to be top-notch qaulity."
,Disturbedmaster,2013-02-21T09:53Z,"to be  correct its the 3rd song on the album not the first, and so far its the only released single not the first "
,Disturbedmaster,2013-02-21T09:54Z,@mpgh2k8 i have an official video that's in 1080p

It was meant to convey ""The first single released from the self titled album by 'Device'.""

Bad wording is all."
