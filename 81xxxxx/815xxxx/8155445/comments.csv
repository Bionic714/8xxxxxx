If you want to update to the latest beta builds, this is working great.

Thx for a great upload"
,lex.usa,2013-02-20T19:33Z,"Works perfect
But…how to uninstal it?"
,w0lf1,2013-02-20T22:07Z,"@lex.usa

Not sure, but you can diable it in System Preferences.

I believe it edits you defaults file > /usr/bin/defaults  with some information from 
https://swscan.apple.com/content/catalogs/others/index-mountainlionseed-mountainlion-lion-snowleopard-leopard.merged-1.sucatalog.gz

Unless you're paranoid about something I wouldn't worry about removing it, the install is like less than 200kb"
,lex.usa,2013-02-21T19:33Z,"Everything ok, but I change my mind update to Beta
And Red spot with one update available always shows in apple store icon
I don't like it :)
Any ideas guys?"
