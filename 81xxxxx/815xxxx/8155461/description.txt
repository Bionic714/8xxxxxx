Top Gear
Season 19 Episode 4 of 7
Jeremy Clarkson puts the new Kia Cee'd through a 
rigorous but peculiar road test featuring eels, 
curry, a rock legend, an American police officer 
and an unusual game of rugby involving James May. 
Richard Hammond gets behind the wheel of the 
Mastretta MXT, but worries about the repercussions 
of a comment he made in a previous episode about 
Mexico, the sports car's country of manufacture. 
Plus, three high-performance hatchbacks are driven 
with gusto around the test track, and Formula One 
driver Lewis Hamilton - who has switched from McLaren 
to Mercedes for the 2013 season - gets a second chance 
to smash the lap record
