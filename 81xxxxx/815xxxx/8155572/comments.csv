,stingrayopp,2013-02-18T13:42Z,"well, nice job done by LUXlol again, but  why can't I input my "" USER+ORGANIZATION+WORKGROUP"" name during installing this windows xp black edition ?! is it not possible to re-customize this xp version by you friend LUXLOL, if you would do , your Black edition will become the most user friendly customized version for all the users and also that everybody could have ever found so far. Will you please do these tasks in next releases ! Thanks a lot, again."
,LuxLOL,2013-02-18T14:43Z,"@stingrayopp

You can change the WORKGROUP over the WinXP menu (START -> Right-Click -> Computer -> Properties -> Change).

And the USER and ORGANIZATION can be easily changed with the Registry Editor, but there is no point in doing this.

P.S.  i have windows 7 from a friend who torrented it too me and i didnt have to make a boot disk just seeing when installing it just seeing if i need one or not "
,LuxLOL,2013-02-27T16:42Z,Yes it works but you should better use a CD to install Windows.

 thanks!! :)"
,LuxLOL,2013-02-27T19:21Z,"Repair = To repair a Windows with the original installation CD.

,Fox_Grey,2013-02-28T01:23Z,"Hi Sir LuxLOL! is Outlook Express included on this package? because I have your build as of 2012.8.16 Black Edition (thanks btw!:D) tried reinstalling OS twice, but still OE is not around. I know its not a big deal because now a days we have MS Outlook, Hotmail Etc. but OE I still the best and easiest for me and for others and it saves the trouble for exporting a hundred GB of .DBX. :D (IMO) still this is one of the best torrents out there :)"
,LuxLOL,2013-02-28T02:36Z,"The default Windows XP Outlook Express is removed because it's outdated and because there is a new Outlook Express version out (Windows Live Mail).
You can download Windows Live Mail over the Windows XP Update Center.
This is also written in the Read Me file."

Install your computer driver.

@rehkli
Do a fresh installation on a formatted hard disk drive or partition.


@Noobs
If you don't know how to install a Windows XP then please at least Read the instruction in the Read Me file."
,rehkli,2013-03-09T21:27Z,I made a fresh installation
,LuxLOL,2013-03-09T22:47Z,"Did you get the Options Selector Box after the Windows XP installation?

,cc178700,2013-03-10T22:33Z,"I am trying this on a Dell Dimension 8300 that I dug out of the closet for my kid to use.
I get as far as setup, but then an error screen pops up saying something about:
Cannot find the following files on i386:

setupORG.exe = 1,,,,,,,2,0,0
presetup.cmd = 1,,,,,,,2,0,0

I'm not a noob and even the forums online aren't any help.  This tower is pretty old but it was running XP before I did a clean install.  Also during the install, while it was copying files for installation two separate errors came up saying the aforementioned cmd & exe files were not found/able to be copied.

Any help is appreciated!"
,LuxLOL,2013-03-11T14:19Z,"It's a CD-ROM or Disc (CD) problem.

Read Me file:

* If during the Windows XP installation you get corrupted file error(s) or missing file error(s) then try this:
1. Burn the Disc at the lowest possible speed.
2. Don't use old scratched Disc.
3. Clean your CD/DVD-ROM device(s).
4. Use another or buy another CD/DVD-ROM device.
5. Make and Install Windows XP from a USB Flash drive."
,BitchPhD,2013-03-13T01:31Z,"1.  It doesn't auto-populate the Key like it says it will in the readme.

Don't download unless you have another way of activating."

1. This Windows XP is not for Upgrading you must make a clean installation on a formatted Hard disk drive or Partition."
