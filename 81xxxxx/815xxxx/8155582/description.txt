t did not take Kidd many months to go from total anonymity to being a national celebrity rapper with silly lyrics and a warped attitude, which many either loved or loved to hate. In early 2012, he suddenly appeared on Clement Kjersgaard's talk show on Danish TV, and revealed that it was all a setup, a sarcastic attack on the established music industry, which had gotten out of hand. Director Andreas Johnsen has followed the project from day 1, when Nicholas Westwood Kidd was still called by his first name, and his debut track still only had nine hits on YouTube. With his hand-held camera, he captures the many highs and lows, the drunk nights on the town, and Kidd and his friends who shocked but excited look on as the rest of the world takes them shockingly serious. But at the same time one sees the transformation in Nicholas's eyes, as everything starts taking off, and the Kidd identity keeps him trapped between the silly and the serious, while the hangovers of one and a half years of drinking and partying wash over him. Eighteen months of burnt bridges, joints in droves, months spent as a homeless and groupies in his bed. Yes, Kidd got his women, but he also got his cash - and it is all brought together on film.
