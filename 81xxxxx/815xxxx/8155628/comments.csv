,mel9421,2013-03-05T14:27Z,great copy of windows 8. i installed on an old toshiba laptop via usb drive and installation was complete in six minutes. This windows 8 updates via windows update with no problems. you don't need a key to activate it. search thepiratebay for a windows 8 activator. activate it after you run windows update. thanks to the creator of this copy of windows for all your hard work.
