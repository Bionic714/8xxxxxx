"Chris Chross"

To buy new sneakers, Chris steals money 
from Lois' purse. When Meg catches him in 
the act, she forces him to do all of her 
chores in exchange for keeping mum. But 
Chris finally tires of the pact, and runs 
away to live with Herbert. Meanwhile, 
Stewie and Brian become obsessed with 
singer Anne Murray (guest-voicing as 
herself), and visit her to find out the 
true meaning of Snowbird

Evolve... or die.

Enjoy :)
