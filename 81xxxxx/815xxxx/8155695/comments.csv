Seems this file is corrupted.

Try compressing it before uploading

Tried all my resources to open, but it's a NO GO

You sure about that? It opens just fine for me. I would figure if other people were having problems someone else would have complained.

For anyone experiencing the same problem it sounds like you just downloaded some bad data from a peer. I'd just try verifying your local data, which all modern torrent clients should be able to do.

If that doesn't work I'd recommend this (which I see you've already gotten):
