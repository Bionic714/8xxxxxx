Kinky Cupcake is much more than a meeting place for like-minded BDSM enthusiasts ΓÇô it's an all-purpose play space with dungeons, boudoirs and role-play rooms galore. So when Rosie and her new friend Dimitri blag their way in, they know they are going to have to convince everyone that they are a genuine BDSM scene couple

The pleasures of domination and submission are explored, one by one, until Rosie and Dimitri's faked dynamic becomes all too real. But can their new bond survive outside Kinky Cupcake as well as inside its playrooms?
