Well done, you are managing to keep up with this mega download.  Don't worry about seeding 1:1 you can do that later once you have the whole collection.  Here is Part 4 and the text file will inform you what tracks are inside the RAR Archive.  Sorry I have to RAR these files but this is due to a code error with the Pirate Bay Web site which limits the number of files you can have in a Torrent.   It also limits the size of this text box so I can not even list the tracks here as text.  Part 5 will be up just as soon as this one has 100% out in the Swarm.

MP3+CDG Karaoke songs see torrent text file for details.

Rigmar Radio - The original seeder for the Alphabet of Pop karaoke series here a few years ago.  This is the 2013 updated version.  All correctly file named and tagged.  PLEASE don't upload Karaoke which is NOT CORRECTLY TAGGED!!! sigh...  Tracks should NOT have catalogue numbers before or after the filename and the file names should be industry standard that is:

Artist - Song Tile [Karaoke].mp3
Artist - Song Tile [Karaoke].cdg

Note the [Karaoke] at the end is optional but a good idea as that will prevent Karaoke tracks from over writing existing Audio only versions in MS Windows.  

Rigmar Radio - Rockin' the Free World since 1967
