,choodles,2013-02-18T09:56Z,Goddammit. Stop being tight arses! Seed!! Don't just freaking leech!
,ScarletteSpider,2013-02-18T10:27Z,"i have to agree with choodles
it is ridiculous that there are 200 ppl in the cluster, 83 of them have 100% but only 4 ppl are seeding and 3 of them don't have 100% of the file. 
then to add insult to injury combined are seeding at a rate of 16kbs which will take over 3 hours to download when every other program with this amount of seeders usually takes between 20 to 30 minutes when they aren't stingy with bandwidth
when ppl are generous to you with bandwidth speeds then you are OBLIGATED to be just as generous with yours
What goes around comes around douchebag leechers"
