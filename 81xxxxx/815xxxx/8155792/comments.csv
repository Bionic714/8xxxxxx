,mrorbear,2013-02-19T01:02Z,"What daFUQ is up with the password, and having to ""complete an offer"" at some dodgy website in order to get it?  I've never ever seen this before on a eztv torrent."
,pirate_share_the_love,2013-02-19T03:05Z,"Another fine download from eztv for me, unlike what mrorbear said.. Thanks for providing content years before it's available where I am."
,Dreams-Prince,2013-02-19T23:40Z,"mrorbear is a J-@ss, fine upload, thanks eztv for sharing the love..."
,kc4vdx,2013-02-20T01:33Z,"mrorbear, fall off a cliff you imbecile.."
,oldbreadbutt,2013-02-21T09:44Z,"no point in writing comments back to mrorbear, because mrorbear can't read. :-("
,oldbreadbutt,2013-02-21T09:45Z,"also, holy crap that was a fast download. TY eztv!"
,mrorbear,2013-02-22T07:09Z,"Yeah, I can read - how bout just answering the question? A password was required and the ""read me"" said to go to some website and ""complete and offer"" to get the password."
