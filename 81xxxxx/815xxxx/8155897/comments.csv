,JHackerX,2013-02-18T06:30Z,I would advise to not even bother downloading this. I downloaded the Royal Rumble match that this user posted previously and it was horrible. A lot of stuff was cut out of it to a point I stopped watching and waited  for a better download. I'm sure this is the same.
,HHMUT,2013-02-18T06:32Z,"is this a full show or what? cause,i can see the size of the file is only 339.39 MiB. thats too small."
,HHMUT,2013-02-18T06:33Z,JHacker. what do you mean? he/she cut some parts of the show?
,HHMUT,2013-02-18T06:34Z,"comment deleted,so. i think its not a full show"

,jdveraser,2013-02-18T08:26Z,"its obviously real, since it does have that nice little green skull beside his(or her) name. tpb doesnt just throw around status rewards like other kicktorrent ass sites. dont be butt-hurt jhacker, just enjoy the damn show, FREE of charge. THANK YOU LOVERULZ. i appreciate your hard work."
,DragonChaserKev,2013-02-18T10:31Z,"Looks complete, lower video quality equals much smaller file size and super fast download, am seeding it now and already at 1:1.5 ratio.  Nothing to complain about here folks, download, enjoy, and ignore the whiners."
,vizardGr,2013-02-18T12:58Z,hi guys. this torrent is not fake is reall but with not good quality. If u want to watch this show FAST download it. btw it was sucks :P 
,armyspy,2013-02-18T18:15Z,"I just finished watching and seeding. 

Well this was watchable considering my low resolution screen and my low patience.

This is just the same quality as you would watch a video on YouTube in 240p"
