Meet Bernard Black. Bernard is an anti-social, heavy drinking chain-smoker 
who owns a small London bookshop - an unusual vocation, given that he 
detests customers and delights in physically and verbally abusing them at 
every opportunity. His best (and only) friend in the world is his lunch 
time drinking partner Fran, a neurotic and boyfriend-desperate woman who 
owns the pretentious arts and crafts shop next to his. Bernard is cynical, 
abrasive and lazy, and is perfectly happy that way - but his life takes an 
unexpected turn when he sells 'The Little Book of Calm' to hyper-stressed 
accountant Manny Bianco, who against all odds ends up swallowing it. When 
the dust is settled, Manny will have a new job, Fran will have a new friend, 
and Bernard's life will be far more surreal (if that's possible).
