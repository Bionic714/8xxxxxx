,M.CTI,2013-02-18T09:37Z,"How can I help anyone if I can't download anything ? XD
It would just add a leecher.
And for the record, I always seed for weeks when i'm at 100% so plz shut the fuck up and have a nice day :)"

,konjaks,2013-02-18T10:57Z,ill definetally seed this ! ty uploader :))
,m3nt4t,2013-02-18T15:09Z,"Thanks for this. I dunno why the 720P version of TWD doesn't look like real 720P compared to epsiodes of other shows that I have downloaded. It looks more like software-upscaled SD 480P, and yet the file is 1.75GB in size! The original encoders need to tweak their settings for smaller file size if they want to maintain the same file quality or get more quality for the same file size. Look at the Homeland & Community 720P & 1080P episodes for comparison. Both look gorgeous."
,arkoth0,2013-02-18T17:46Z,"number of seeds doesn't matter now, it's always slow when it's first released. There are too many leechers"
,mikexw,2013-02-18T18:12Z,Walking Dead episodes aren't in true HD 720p because (i believe) the show doesn't air in HD/AMC is not set in HD ...yet.
,FinalCylon,2013-02-18T21:31Z,"@m3nt4t, the Walking Dead is filmed in 16mm. It's not the fault of the encoders."
,trckojr,2013-02-18T21:45Z,"download 5kbps, upload 105kbps :)
and for the uploader huge thanks!"
,yalF,2013-02-18T23:44Z,"Obg. pessoal.

,77Monk77,2013-02-19T00:54Z,"Thanks EZTV you rule as always!

Question for any smart Mac people here: I've always downloaded the SD version for the ease of watching it on my Xbox360. Every time I try to convert mkv with handbrake I end up experiencing the sound sync issue on Xbox and PS3. Any tips what might be causing it would be much appreciate it."
