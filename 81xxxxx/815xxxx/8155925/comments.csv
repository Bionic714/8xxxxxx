,JaydenSAS,2013-02-18T07:36Z,come on seed people
,SOPASUX,2013-02-18T10:56Z,I have yet to find an ettv file that ISN'T some scam. Needs a password but to do that you need to go register at some site and take a survey that never gets done (but they got your info already). Screw that!
,Astralia,2013-02-18T11:35Z,"SOPASUX, are you retarded or what? ETTV is a trusted uploader and non of ""his"" uploads that i've fetched are fakes. And btw, you come across many password protected avi files now do you? Either way, you're just a trolling n00b or a trolling idiot, take a pick!"
,maxba,2013-02-18T13:41Z,i agree with Astralia. I have been downloading from ettv for months now and haven't had any problems.
,Keeeeevin,2013-02-18T17:11Z,"Sopasux = NOOB

,Beograd_011,2013-02-19T03:19Z,thanks :D
,ScottyD7421,2013-02-19T07:30Z,"Thanks for uploading ettv, appreciate your work as usual.

Love the quality and love the show.

@SOPASUX isn't a noob he's a spammer. Just one of a hundred people who leave negative comments in the hopes of turning people off from downloading. Keep trying loser!!"
,smb275,2013-02-19T18:01Z,"""SOPASUX"" seems like something of a misnomer, consider that you're likely an MPAA goon."
,Sgt.Psycho,2013-02-22T01:18Z,Awesome as always.Thank you again.
,IncubatedDucks,2013-02-24T21:30Z,Why is there always such trolls on this site? You don't know how many times I've looked through comments and sometimes half of the people are saying it's fake and the other half says it's real. Just tell the truth people! But I trust ettv. Never had an issue.
