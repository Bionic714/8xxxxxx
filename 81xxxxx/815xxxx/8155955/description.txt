One of the best episodes of the modern era. Frightening, complicated, and emotionally resonant, this well-paced episode felt like it came straight out of some of the best eras of Classic Doctor Who. Except for one thing: the score. Watching this episode, we felt that Murray Gold's ham-fisted score was totally at odds with what was being seen on screen. Unwilling to settle for such a rare gem of an episode being compromised by such a letdown of a score, we took matters into our own hands, stripped the music away, and re-did it ourselves. We also made a couple of minor tweaks and edits to improve the flow and atmosphere of this excellent episode.

We hope that you enjoy this glimpse into what modern Doctor Who could be.
