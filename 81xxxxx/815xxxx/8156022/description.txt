Astral Projection Subliminal Hypnosis with Paul Santisi (2012)

I've listened to many hypnosis files and I like these ones a lot. Paul has a very friendly voice that makes you trust him whether you want it or not. The astral file nearly worked for me after one listening only. Paul cleverly combines hypnosis with subliminals in way I haven't experienced before. He's quite unobtrusive in his style and lets you have enough room for your own individuality. His style is somewhat similar to the files by Sonny Rosati whose audio files I've seeded some time ago. Of the many files I've listened to over the years I've liked Sonny Rosati and Paul Santisi the most. Both of them have Italian names - strange.
