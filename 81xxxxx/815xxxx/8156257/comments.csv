,bassposaune,2013-02-18T23:22Z,"No offense to Nepotu's torrents and his hard work but Gondy10's are way better. The 60 fps really makes a difference in smoothness.

Nepotu's torrents are just fine but if you want the best of the best download this.

Gondy10 is there any chance that you could tell me what program you use for making these and how you do it?

Thanks so much Gondy10. "
