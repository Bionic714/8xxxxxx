Ultimak makes better rails and accessories than UTG does, though."

I still find myself trying to refer to it today. This is a very difficult magazine to find; Guns&Ammo doesn't sell backissues, and they almost never pop up for sale on the internet.

Please share any other issues you may have! Thanks for the high quality scan also. If someone doesn't like the file size they can always scale it down."
