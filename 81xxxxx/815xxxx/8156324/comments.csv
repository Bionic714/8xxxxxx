,cuteycindyhoney,2013-02-21T12:36Z,"Gee, thanks a lot for packing it into an rar file so nobody can download just the files they want. Since I already have every episode and only want the documentary, this is a fine slap in the face. Oh well. Sooner or later someone will post just the documentary. I'll get it then. "
,killzone173,2013-02-21T13:56Z,"cuteycindyhoney is complaining that i packed it into a .rar when all she wanted was the documentary. well, where do u think i got it?... - http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8042542/Bronies__The_Extremely_Unexpected_Adult_Fans_of_My_Little_Pony - there you go... no complaining. i put everything in on file for convenience, period. brohoof and dont forget to seed..."
,cuteycindyhoney,2013-02-21T19:38Z,"Most people wouldn't want to download a 28GB rar file. Nobody will be able to check video quality, or even know for sure what's really in it, until it's completed downloading. For all we know, it's the complete G3 in that rar! You put everything into one file for YOUR convenience, You knew people would mostly be interested in the documentary, so you set it up this way to try and greatly increase your ratio. I bet I'm not the only one who had no idea what the full title was, and just knew it as ""The Brony Documentary"". "

,killzone173,2013-02-22T03:45Z,"look, its obvious u like to complains, but the title was cut off because it was too long."
,killzone173,2013-02-22T03:45Z,*complain*
,killzone173,2013-02-22T03:46Z,"oh, and if you dont like it, then delete it."
,cuteycindyhoney,2013-02-23T04:49Z,"When I said I didn't know the actual title of the documentary, I meant that was why I never found it to download. I have nothing to delete, since I didn't download your monster sized mystery rar. "
,killzone173,2013-02-23T06:38Z,my 28 gb monster file which is mostly 1080p versus your 45.59 gb 720p file... plus mine had the documentary all in one place so...
,cuteycindyhoney,2013-02-23T16:56Z,"But nobody wants to download a freakin' huge rar file. Note your very low numbers. It's been posted for five days, and you only have four seeds and fourteen leaches. Say all you want, but your file will remain a complete mystery to anyone downloading it until they finish. Many say it isn't worth the risk wasting time and bandwidth on.  "
,cuteycindyhoney,2013-02-23T17:01Z,"Haven't you noticed that MANY uploaders make a point of proclaiming that they NEVER upload rar files? Nobody likes downloading rar files! I bet if you had upped this as an open file and not packed, people would only be downloading the documentary out of it. You knew this too, hence the giant rar file. "
,killzone173,2013-02-25T11:14Z,"actually, this was my first torrent so shut it. LOVE AND TOLERATE!"
,notlong,2013-03-29T03:58Z,"Dear Princess Celestia,

Today I learned that people hate it when torrents come in the form of one large RAR file, and that Bronies should accept criticisms on their choices when creating torrents, especially when it's their first time making one, so they can learn from their mistakes. They should also stop using the motto ""Love and Tolerate"" as a catch-all phrase for ""Leave me alone, I'm right and you're wrong"".

Your faithful student,

Notlong"
,killzone173,2013-03-30T09:03Z,"you know what? if you dont like it, dont download it.  so, far only 2 complaints and TONS of downloads so..."
