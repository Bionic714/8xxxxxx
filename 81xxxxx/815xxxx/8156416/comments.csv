,romintang,2013-02-21T00:25Z,"Someone has ability in programming please write a program to read, parse and display this XML (in C++, Java, Python, Pascal, etc...) then share it to us."

,hairybogwoppit,2013-02-21T14:32Z,"tried everything i know, cannot figure this file out. it's a 7 zip, yet unzipped it displays a high chaparell se2 episode. i know i am a dork so let us not got there. just someone explain without links to banned things as they do not work in the UK"
,vikstrou2,2013-02-21T21:29Z,"Here's a command line tool you can use to search/parse this file.
https://github.com/vikstrous/pirate-get"
,kbilek,2013-02-21T21:37Z,Apparently the XML is not well formed. I will post the well-formed one afterwards (sorry guys)
,kbilek,2013-02-22T21:17Z,"Some people noticed that the XML files are not well-formed and valid. I am sorry for that, but I made perl scripts that will make them both, see https://github.com/runn1ng/pb-archive-make-valid. The script need perl, bash and sed, so you will need linux (OS X will maybe be sufficient but I have nowhere to try). I think it is better solution than uploading the file again; I am again sorry for the inconvenience.

Also - to everyone that is trying to open the file in notepad/something crazy like that - the file is NOT intended for ordinary usage instead of pirate bay. There is not point in manually searching in the XML file."

,Bodhi2010,2013-02-23T13:32Z,"how do use this XML file? http://bvlist.com
people want to make their own tracker"
,theguy39,2013-02-28T05:16Z,"Could you release this in csv format Plz!?

P.S sorry for any double posting internet being a beehotch"
,marco22222,2013-04-20T07:40Z,"What would take this to another level is to recreate search capabilities of TPB offline using the archive.
Example: Search a phrase in category ebooks and sort by number of seeds.
with support for operators such as *
Not sure why but some torrents get skipped/are missing on searches that return more than 1000 results, using a TPB offline search tool would make sure I don't."
