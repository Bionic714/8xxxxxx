I usually watch all the movies at film.raeshashop.com because they have HD's but they didn't have this one so im happy to have piratebay :) Good torrent quality - A9 V9,"

It was not coded correctly, about 1/4th of the way through the movie it is 3-5 seconds off, by about half it is 10-12+ off. Not sure why people force .mp4 rips knowing this is a known issue with playbacks.

The video quality is awesome but suffers becoming unwatchable due to the scenes audio throw off. I tried every way possible to fix with software, but now just have to download a different copy because it was ripped like this. 

Thanks AnoXmous, but you didn't do a very good job checking the sound when you were done, it is very unwatchable in this condition."
