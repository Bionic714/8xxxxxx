I couldn't find a torrent of this doujin anywhere, but some people wanted it so here you are.
You should be able to open the archive with a comic book viewer. If not, just extract it with your favourite archive utility (provided it can handle the 7z format).
It's 461 pages in total.

If there are any problems with corruption, or I messed up in some other way, let me know with a comment! And make sure to seed.
