also, thanks."
,Enkhsaikhan,2013-02-19T07:39Z,don_gacho don't troll here. Get the fuck outta here!
,Enkhsaikhan,2013-02-19T07:41Z,"There is no major difference between them. The only difference between them is it contains ""Lifeguard Cossacks"" for russia and ""Archduke Ferdinand Cuirassiers"" for austria. That's it."
,Enkhsaikhan,2013-02-19T07:53Z,If your current game has a pirate skull at loading screen this patch will fix it.
,ChiliNoMoreX,2013-02-22T04:50Z,"tested & aproved - much obliged.

@Enkhsaikhan 
yes, i had the skull intro but i think that could be easily removed by changed some modded itens for the original cracked ones.

still, will be doing the original campaign with the grande armée for the first time (played with modded countries/startpos before) so, nice job and many thanks. "
,Enkhsaikhan,2013-02-22T08:59Z,You are welcome ChillNoMoreX! 
,DarkJediLV,2013-02-27T09:23Z,"good torrent if you want the whole dlc pack.
will satisfy my total war taste till Shogun 2 Gold comes out. :)"
,RAMEN00DLE5,2013-05-26T06:05Z,"I beg your pardon if I am batshit crazy but don't we need a userscript file or something? I ask because I pasted this into the install folder and when I started NTW it had the red background but the penn camp box had no text and neither did the main camp screen. Is it because I pasted and didn't extract? That is what I am doing right now I am doing fresh install and will then extract this file into the new fresh install folder. Please, if anyone here still reads this thread and knows what is up let me know."
,Enkhsaikhan,2013-05-26T11:34Z,Read the instruction please. And we don't need a user.script. We use a user.script file when modding the game.
