This is a pack/folder of all the music that has been upload toas of Febuary 17th 2013. 
This is just for any one who likes the music I upload and wants to download it all at once.
If you havent seen my youtube channel and you just discovered this randomly on the pirate bay, 
consider subscribing to my channelif you like the music in this pack.
I try to upload at least one new song every day on my channel and I'll also upload every song here on tpb.

Also just to let you know I downloaded most of these songs from soundcloud 
(using a plugin that allows me to download any media on the page)
so almost all of these songs should be 128kbps.
I added the album artwork, title, album, and genre to almost all the songs too so some of them might not be 
the exact artwork for that specific song, but it'll be from the artist/producer who created the song at least.
