Karaoke Collection Part 5.  See torrent text file for track listing.  See torrent in this section called Total Collection Track Listings for the full collection which is going to be seeded over the next 7 to 10 days.

Please make sure you are only running this one torrent and your UPLOAD speed is set to no more than 70% of your measured UPLOAD speed.   Also check your ports are open and DHT (Distributed Hash Tracking) and or PEX (Peer Exchange) is switched on in your Bit Torrent client.

Please make sure you do not have more upload slots to the swarm than your bandwidth will allow.  You should have between 5 and never more than 10 upload slots and remember I SUPER SEED for the first few hours of each torrent, so you will NOT SEE ME AS A SEEDER but a fellow Peer in the swarm.   I give each PEER a different part of the whole file for the first few hours and it is vital that you communicate with the other peers in the swarm and you upload your parts to your fellow peers so they can download there's to you.

This is what happens in a good swarm - every peer is a seed while they are downloading the whole, they are giving the parts they have to others as others give you parts you have not got.   This way I can quickly get the whole torrent out there and move on to the next part in this series.  With 100GB of a collection I have to rely on your knowledge and expertise in Bit Torrenting to get this out in a timely fashion.   Thank You.

Your download speed setting is not important.  You will seldom every reach it anyway.   what you are aiming for is to be above average with your personal download speeds in the swarm.  If everyone aims for that, this collection will be out in no time at all.

Stop your seeding while you download this torrent.  Don't Worry the torrents will be well seeded by myself for the next week or so.
