Seeing as no-one is continuing the back catalogue of ASOT....

Thanks to the original uploaders and folks recording.

All the files are one mp3 per episode, no split tracks - generally 256 or 320 in quality.

Enjoy, and please seed for the new folks. This is music history, let those following us enjoy it as well.
