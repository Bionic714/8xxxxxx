Everwood.S01E12.720p.WEBRip.H264-DRAWER


Resolution..: 1280x718
Audio.......: aac 2.0

This is basically similiar to what's been done for years on Pee2Pee and known as WEB-DL. 

Native HD video downloaded from iTunes with the DRM and metadata stripped and remuxed 
into .mkv container. Video/Audio are untouched. There is absolutely no point to reencode
as the source is progressive and the file sizes are very "affordable". That's also the 
reason for H264 tag and not x264. 


The Good: Most of TV shows never see a Blu-Ray release. This is the closest thing
          you'd get to a retail HD release. HDTV 720p caps are not regularly archived on many 
          sites and they have the all "issues" of a TV cap - screen spam from network, occasional
          issues such as airing compression artifacts, encode filtering issues, no end credits
          and so on. 

The Bad: 1) Go prove you didn't just leech it off a Pee2Pee and scene'd it.
         2) No rules
         3) No site sections
         4) Low tradability.

Best way we thought of to work around "The Bad 1)" is a screenshot of our iTunes queue as it's downloading
the set. Seems like a decent proof we spent our hard earned money on the atrocity that is iTunes, fruit of 
the devil's spawn (aka crApple).

Why bother? Everyone likes high res and so do we. We are aiming at shows we personally love and don't 
have high res copies of. In this instance, Everwood S01 never had 720p caps unlikely to ever see a Blu-Ray 
release. In fact, even the dvds for S01 are all shitty FS (apart for the first ep which was in letterboxed WS).
