  Artist Bio:

  Singer and songwriter Max Gomez grew up in Taos, New Mexico, the son of a Portuguese-Spanish father and an Irish-Scottish mother. He fell early under the influence of country blues, and then moved on to classic modern singer/songwriters like Townes Van Zandt, Guy Clark, and John Prine, as well as folk-based rockers like Tom Petty and Neil Young, honing his songwriting skills and developing a style that melded all of his influences, but was still uniquely his. Gomez released a debut album, the Jeff Trott-produced Rule the World, on New West Records early in 2013.

  Album Review:

  The first thing that hits one while listening to Max Gomez's debut album Rule the World is his voice, which sounds much older than a 23-year-old's, which is how old Gomez was upon the album's release. Sounding calm, unassuming, weary, and wise, he sings with the kind of balance and unhurried phrasing of a Townes Van Zandt, say, and his songs, which at first seem like fairly ordinary singer/songwriter fare, have a dark edge to them at times, and a natural grace and flow that are rare at any age. Although there is some stylistic and instrumental variety in this playlist, from the swampy blues feel of "Ball and Chain" to the folky "What It Means" and the pop-like "Love Will Find a Way," Gomez's voice and singing don't really vary that much from track to track, which is a minor problem, although the songs have a sturdy and world-weary grace that makes them the real stars in this setting, and good songs will always find a voice. This is a promising debut.
