  U.K. supergroup Crippled Black Phoenix is a progressive post-rock musical collective that has featured nearly 30 members in its rotating roster. A constant driving force is Justin Greaves of Electric Wizard and Iron Monkey, who started the band in 2004 with the help of Mogwai bassist Dominic Aitchison. In 2006, Crippled Black Phoenix released their first album A Love of Shared Disasters, and started concentrating on live shows, which often involved more than a dozen members on-stage. Resurrectionists and Night Raider were recorded from March of 2007 to August of 2008 at S.O.A. Studio in Bristol, and released in 2009, along with a compilation of songs from those two albums titled 200 Tons of Bad Luck . 2010ΓÇÖs I, Vigilante followed on Geoff Barrow's Invada Records, and sparked some attention with a stoner rock version of JourneyΓÇÖs "Of a Lifetime." The band followed up in 2012 with the more conceptual, (Mankind) The Crafty Ape.
