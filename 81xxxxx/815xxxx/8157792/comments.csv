,m3nt4t,2013-02-18T14:57Z,What's the difference between this and the other 720P upload? This file is smaller by about ~500MB.

This version is the 720p WEB-DL, which means that it was ripped from the iTunes Store. The other 720P upload is a HDTV one, which was ripped from someone's TV.

The difference is a slight quality increase in this version, as well as there also being no channel logos, watermarks and ratings. "
