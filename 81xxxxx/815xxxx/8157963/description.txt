I have to laugh when local Karaoke Bars and Roadshows announce "Over 120,000 Selections"   Yeah right, and how many are duplicates or wrongly filenamed or tagged????

The answer is A LOT.   Well I can promise you that in THIS COLLECTION less than 1 track in 100 is a duplicate or wrongly file-named or tagged.   Yes that is correct less than 1% error.   I am so fed up seeing the MP3 and Karaoke on this site with either no filename just track1 track2 and so on or nonsense like:

SC1920045_01_Help_Me_Through_The_Night_-_Night,_Gladys_And_The_Pips.mp3
SC1920045_01_Help_Me_Through_The_Night_-_Night,_Gladys_And_The_Pips.cdg

Well welcome to part 6 of this collection which does not put you through all that renaming and re tagging nonsense, because I have done all that for you.  This collection is good to go, ready for import into the playout software of your choice.
