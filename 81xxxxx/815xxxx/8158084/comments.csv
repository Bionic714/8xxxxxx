,cactusjack666,2013-02-19T02:55Z,not to much Rugby here in the US accept on fox soccer plus i was following the Heineken Cup but i moved waiting for it to come back on in may but if you can upload any games from the Aviva Premiership and RaboDirect PRO12 would be cool but thanks for the uploads
[T],rugbybill,2013-02-19T10:09Z,@cactusjack666: Some RaboDirect Pro12 already uploaded (3 games) :)
,cactusjack666,2013-02-20T01:47Z,I got the munster game but the other two games are on a different video format i can't watch them i use a usb stick i plug in to a xbox 360 
[T],rugbybill,2013-02-20T02:47Z,"@cactusjack666: Gotcha, you prefer mp4. 
Thanks for the feedback, I'll remember that in future. 
If it's any help to you, you can download any mkv files and run them through some free software called Yamb. It's dead easy and it'll only take a few minutes and they should then be playable on your Xbox.
mp4 it is from now on then :)"
