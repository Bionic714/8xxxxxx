Reggae In High-Fi contains 15 jamminΓÇÖ selectionsΓÇª the cream of two decades from RAS Records. RAS Records is considered the pre-eminent Reggae label today. These are the real authentic sounds and superstars of Reggae. Some of the featured artists include Black Uhuru, who was the winner of the very first Grammy for Reggae, Yellowman, who rose to superstardom as the notorious ΓÇ£toasterΓÇ¥, Israel Vibration, one of the biggest groups in Reggae today, as well as Jacob Miller, Freddie McGregor and Gregory IsaacsΓÇª all superstars and all perennial chart-toppers and more.

Some listeners love to load up their iPod or CD player and hit the random button, delighting in the juxtaposition of songs and styles that burst forth in startling sequence. Others find that extremely annoying, preferring a smooth switch in sounds and gentler progression of styles that create a sumptuous coherent set. Those latter will find this compilation irritating to say the least, as it leapfrogs across the reggae spectrum, heedless of decades, subgenres or styling. Load it up, hit random, and IΓÇÖll guarantee the result will be better sequenced. That said, thereΓÇÖs no arguing with the quality of the 15 tracks nor with the star appeal of all the artists featured within. The songs are all licensed from RAS Records, the American label so instrumental in seeing roots reggae and culture through the lean years of the ΓÇÖ80s and beyond, a musical propensity the company maintains to this day. But that isnΓÇÖt to suggest this is a roots comp, although two masterpieces from Peter Broggs and Jacob Miller certainly fit that category. Even the culture icons had to move with the times, and thereΓÇÖs a dancehall-lite vibe to the majority of the music here, which on occasion moves straight into ragga territory. Considering both the labelΓÇÖs and the artistsΓÇÖ reputations, itΓÇÖs surprising, however, that the messages mostly revolve around mashing up the dancefloor, with the DJs inevitably delivering up the most massively pleasing numbers. Regardless, with such artists as Black Uhuru, Israel Vibration, and Gregory Isaacs on board, this set truly nices up the dancehall. Magnificent music, but an odd selection nonetheless.
