The CTV is tame and the Showtime is as intended nudity and all , hence why it makes a difference and I ask. Thanx though , been looking for a copy of anything from this really for years. My introduction to Super Dave lol."
,xxdocxx,2013-05-13T16:30Z,@oxburger as you can see in the title this in UNCENSORED version. Nudity and language have not been censored. And it is ripped from dvd. there are 10 volumes. I'll upload the last 9-10 this weekend
