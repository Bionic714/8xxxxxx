Ep: 2 Klose 4 Komfort

Released Feb 17, 2013

Miami's big beaches are seemingly not big enough for the Kardashian sisters! Kourtney is tired of their cramped quarters in the hotel and wants to lay down roots in the city by buying a real home with a real backyard--but Kim's not on board with the idea, and if she's not in, then Kourtney's out as well. However, what Kourtney wants, she usually gets. Meanwhile, Scott is itching to play, but Kourt's not biting--so he turns to the one sister that's always up for having fun--Khloe! But even Khloe has her limits, and it doesn't take long for Scott to cross a line.
