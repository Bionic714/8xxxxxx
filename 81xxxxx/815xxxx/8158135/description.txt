Ep 11: Reunion Part I

PREMIERE: Sunday February 17, 10:00 pm

Bravo caps off the explosive second season of Shahs of Sunset with the first ever two-part reunion when Reza, MJ, Mike, Lilly, Asa and GG all sit down with Andy Cohen for the ultimate Farsi face-off. In part-one of the reunion, Asa and GG are in a room together for the first time since the terrible knife-wielding dinner party and apology-gone-wrong in the season finale. Accusations fly about out-of-control-lifestyles plus behind the scenes revelations about MJ's criminal past.



Thanks to RKSTR for capping and sharing.

Enjoy!!!
