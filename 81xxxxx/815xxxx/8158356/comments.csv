,Pylaschitt,2013-02-19T00:08Z,"Hey Thanks for the upload, Does this require REACTPSN to work? Can anyone confirm if this will just install and go? I'm on Rogero 4.30. Thanks in advance!"
,ps3420,2013-02-19T01:16Z,"How do you get this game to work? I copied game via multiman to .pkg folder, installed the game but when you go to run it, it says the copyright protection information is invalid"
,ps3420,2013-02-19T01:20Z,Im on Rogero 4.3 
,killa024,2013-02-19T02:50Z,"Nevermind, Used this tutorial to use reactpsn to get the game working..http://www.ps3iso.com/ps3-tutorials/184482-reactpsn-tutorial-4-30cfw-rogero.html"
,Magnus9998,2013-02-20T20:44Z,"Don't stop seeding please. It's very slow. I haven't tried it yet but it needs react psn in order to be activated. Just copy the .rap file in a pen drive. It must be stored in a folder called ""exdata"", in the root of your pen drive. Then plug it into your first USB port, create a new user account called aa, install reactPSN (if you haven't already, if you already installed it just rename your reactpsn account to aa again), and then start reactpsn. Of course, all of this must be made AFTER you installed the game's pkg using multiman."
