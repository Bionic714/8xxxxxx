,cindy25,2013-02-18T16:05Z,"thanks

i bet a lot of us will download this"
,wirke,2013-02-18T19:29Z,How about posting the Video / Audio Spec's?
[T],MrUnpopular,2013-02-18T19:39Z,Ahh ya beat me! I just finished editing the commercials in my cap.
[T],MrUnpopular,2013-02-18T19:41Z,"And thanks by the way. :)

@wirke I'm guessing it's 624x352 (or about there) XviD so pretty decent"

[T],RayCort,2013-02-18T20:05Z,"@wirke, posting video and audio specs is not a requirement on TPB. The purple skull next to my name means I am a Trusted Uploader, and most that download my torrents know they are valid, so I don't bother with the petty stuff. "
[T],RayCort,2013-02-18T20:13Z,"@Mr. Unpopular, sorry. Was not sure anyone would cap it and share it. Let me know if you plan to cap upcoming movies from Hallmark and Lifetime, and I will let you deal with the leechers who download and run and leave everyone else waiting forever to download."
[T],MrUnpopular,2013-02-18T20:44Z,"Lifetime and Hallmark are not my specialties (I don't bother with what others do) but if you ever do want me to cap something so you don't have to deal with it, comment on a recent torrent of mine and I will see it and let you know if I can do it. Right now I have no movies planned. But will you be capping Meddling Mom on Hallmark this Saturday or shall I do it?"
[T],MrUnpopular,2013-02-18T20:47Z,Also are you still seeding this? There seems to be no seeders or at least very slow since everyone is at 58-59% only even after some time.
[T],Djofullinn,2013-02-18T22:01Z,Stuck at 58%.
,Transientbuddha,2013-02-18T23:06Z,Also stuck at 58% please seed!...
[T],MrUnpopular,2013-02-18T23:28Z,"I and everyone else are still at 58% after a few hours. We need a little bit more seeding, Raycort. :) I seeded to a ratio of 25 (15 or so GB) on the 2007 Lifetime movie so without a doubt I'll help out plenty on this one if I can get to 100%"
[T],RayCort,2013-02-18T23:41Z,"I stopped seeding at 4GB and it was showing 23 seeders when I removed it 30 minutes ago,now it shows 16 seeders. I guess they are hitting and running and I will NOT Reupload this as I am tired of the leechers causing me headaches."
[T],MrUnpopular,2013-02-19T00:10Z,"grr and I deleted my cap so I can't release it lol

Hopefully someone else releases it or I'll cap the encore saturday

thanks for the effort raycort"
[T],Djofullinn,2013-02-19T00:15Z,"Yeah, hit and run bums.

Well, I can wait. No biggie. It´ll kick in. Thanks for the effort Ray."
,Crashsq,2013-02-19T00:20Z,This sucks running. Why is everyone stuck at 58%?
[T],MrUnpopular,2013-02-19T00:30Z,"Just a thought, you could seed the remaining ~300 MB to me in a new torrent and I'll replace the 58% file with the full one and seed it to everyone so there's seeds. I've got a 100mbit seedbox so it'd be done seeding to everyone in no time."
,Crashsq,2013-02-19T00:31Z,I really do not understand the comment about leechers causing you headaches. I see plenty of your other uploads sitting with hardly any seeders. Couldn't you just leave it going until some of us that will seed could get a hold on it? We're just left hanging.
[T],MrUnpopular,2013-02-19T01:02Z,"Raycort DID leave it going, until there were 23 seeders - which should be enough for them to give the file to all the peers/leechers, but instead they left without uploading their fair share (to a ratio of 1 or greater). as a result, no seeds = nobody can have the full file. TPB stats are wrong about there being 21 seeds. There's 0."
[T],Djofullinn,2013-02-19T01:20Z,"Mr. U, doesn´t seem likely that 23 would get the entire file and all of them would subsequently bail out permanently - leaving the file stuck forever. Maybe I´m missing something."
,zipperhead672c,2013-02-19T01:38Z,So how do we get rid of the bad torrent since no one can complete the download and seed it?
,cindy25,2013-02-19T01:47Z,"I also think the problem is the stats here.  the stats of the mirror sites are all different. 

this problem seems to happen on the most popular releases (Steel Magnolias , Coretta)

maybe the solution for these type is a file host."
[T],RayCort,2013-02-19T02:15Z,"you can find it on different sites like KAT with different amount of seeders on different tracking sites. Use http://torrent-finder.info and type ""National Geographic-Killing Lincoln"" and you should get from other sites like KAT or ahashare."
[T],RayCort,2013-02-19T02:17Z,I am done with TPB. No more for me. tired of this BS
,cindy25,2013-02-19T02:24Z,"I am amazed neither the scene nor anyone on any board released this.  

what is really annoying is paying for NatGeo (Asia) and having to search for it here because what they show us is a year old.  same for Disney and Nick."
,CarolR,2013-02-19T02:32Z,"Oh man. You are the only person who has uploaded this show. 
I started DL at lunch time and it was DL at full speed. I thought for sure I'd have it DL and seeded back at least a few times by the time I got home. Nope. Stuck at 58%. 
I'm going to go cry in the corner now."
[T],Djofullinn,2013-02-19T02:39Z,"All right, misleading stats uploader abandons the torrent too early. Shift happens. Write it off as a loss, try again."
,cindy25,2013-02-19T02:47Z,"sent you a PM on the forum

the KAT release is just a mirror of your torrent.  if you try to dl it it will just say do you want to add trackers?  but their stats are also wrong, and everyone is stuck at 58%.  

is there anyway to seed a torrent slowly in a way  that no one completes it until others have reached into at least the 90s. "
[T],MrUnpopular,2013-02-19T03:17Z,"@cindy yes you limit your upload speed to whatever, like 250 kbps or something"
,dpg3,2013-02-19T03:25Z,"Leechers are blood suckers, they take and take and give nothing. Do the leechers ever think, if everybody was like them, there would be no shows to download?????? Of course they don't, they are the scum of the torrent community. I always upload to a ratio of 1 to 1 and my upload speeds are horrible, usually around 30 kps but I still do it. Thanks leechers, your greed has screwed everyone else in the torrent community, hope your proud of yourselves!!!!!"
,dpg3,2013-02-19T03:33Z,"I stopped the torrent, as all it was doing was feeding the leechers. Stuck at 57% like everyone else!! If it ever gets so that I can download all of it. I'll definitely seed back 1 to 1 !!!"
,CarolR,2013-02-19T03:38Z,"I think I've discovered the problem. I've had this happen before.
There is another file that has been uploaded since RayCort upped his file. It is the extact same file (avi) and has the exact same title. The only differnce is RayCort's is 699mb the other is 754mb. They are using the same trackers.
When I went for that file, it tried to force check the file I was already trying to DL and failed. I moved the original file out of the folder and the new file (not RayCort's) is DL'ing like a mad man at full speed. I am now at 80% on that one and it will be finished in a few minutes. 
When the files are titled the exact same and they are using the same trackers, you can get a false information from the trackers. They will say your file has 23 seeds, but you may actually have 0, it's the other file that really has the 23 seeds.
If someone is going to attempt to re-up this file, I strongly suggest renaming it."
,CarolR,2013-02-19T03:50Z,"Only thing worse than leechers... assholes that up fake shit. Do not go after the file with the same title as this one that is 754mb. It's fake shit, and to make it worse, since those asshats purposely named it after RayCort's it's fucking with Ray's file and people trying to download it.
Ray... any possibility you can rename this file and reup it? Pretty please? With whipped cream and handcuffs? "
,cindy25,2013-02-19T04:09Z,where do i find the 754 mb file?
,cindy25,2013-02-19T04:20Z,so it looks like the problem was not the leechers but the asshole with the fake file?
,CarolR,2013-02-19T04:22Z,"@cindy25 read my last comment. 

The file that is 754mb is fake. It was named specifically after Ray's to drain from people DL'ing his file. "
,CarolR,2013-02-19T04:52Z,Yep. Fake file set up on purpose to screw with real file DL. I haven't seen a move like that since the last time Madona put out an album. lol
,Anti11,2013-02-19T05:03Z,"Torrent has been censored, as required by US court."
,dpg3,2013-02-19T05:06Z,"@cindy25 I stand by what I said about leechers, they add nothing to the bit torrent community but only take!!!!!!!!!!"
,cindy25,2013-02-19T06:14Z,"@anti11 that's nonsense

sorry, but piratebay doesn't listen to USA courts.

too many people tried to dl what should have been a scene release and it overwhelmed the torrent.  

it happened with other movies (Steel Magnolias) "
,Transientbuddha,2013-02-19T08:23Z,"FUCK FAKE FILE!!!! ITS ASKS FOR CODEC download from Limecodec... 

STUPID FUCKING ASSHOLE!! YOU SHOULD HAVE YOUR PINK SKULL WITHDRAWN!!.. :("
,cindy25,2013-02-19T08:59Z,"@Transientbuddha

read the comments b4 commenting.  some asshole made a fake file with exact same name and ruined this torrent

this torrent would have been fine if this had not happened"
,rude181971,2013-02-19T09:40Z,"Hi,

is anybody able to upload another version of this?? Like everybody else stuck at 59% and really want to see this. Will seed freely if someone is kind enough to upload it again. Thankyou"
[T],RayCort,2013-02-19T11:30Z,"OK I reuploaded and renamed it National Geographic-Killing Lincoln [2013] ReSeed. I swear, this is the last time."
[T],RayCort,2013-02-19T11:49Z,"I reuploaded it this morning, and put ReSeed at end of name. Last Time I will do this."
,CarolR,2013-02-19T15:52Z,"@TransientBuddah 
This is the real file. That Limecodec one you are boasting about is the fake one, so I guess that makes YOU the stupid fucking asshole!"
,CarolR,2013-02-19T15:53Z,"I've DL'd this from Ray's other file and have copied it over and renamed it the original file name. I am now seeding but it going slow. I will continue seeding for another 5 hours, then I will have to shut down my computer. I will return later tonight to continue seeding overnight

Thank you Ray!!!!!!"
[T],MrUnpopular,2013-02-19T20:02Z,"Thank you Carol, everyone is about to hit 100% on this one. (Currently at 99.5%)"
