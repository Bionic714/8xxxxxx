,Wolf_20,2013-02-19T15:50Z,The x64 patch isn't working. It still says unregistered version. Tried running the patcher both with and without admin privileges too.
,jelosago,2013-02-20T11:31Z,Works on 64bit. Thanks!
,slizle1,2013-02-20T16:23Z,Crack/Patch works perfect for x64. Thanks so much for posting this quickly.

,XtraZoom,2013-02-24T08:37Z,Didn't XenoCoder & crackflasher11 had a pissing contest on whose crack it was.
,caffeine1,2013-03-03T02:00Z,"The crack worked flawlessly on a 64bit Win7 virtual machine (VMware 9).

Before the crack, Revo said ""29 days left of trial"".  After the crack, it said ""licensed to X"".  I was able to install and uninstall programs with it without a hitch.

Thanks!!!"

64bit patched worked fine for me.

Many thanks to Senzati  :O)"

,bayguy11,2013-03-11T02:50Z,"Am I the only one or does the ""init"" part of the installer lasts forever?"
,Buck_Plankchest,2013-03-12T18:03Z,"1.  Much thanks for upload.

2.  No viruses - any indication of such can be ignored.

3.  Easy, quick install and patch (I installed over previous version on a 32-bit system.)

4.  No delay in initializing installer, but the first time (only) program was run, it took a long time to open.  (I was offline, if that mattered.)  Subsequent times (online), no inordinate delay.  

5.  The empty box with the blinking cursor that appears when you press patch is for your name.  (I wrote in a joke fake name - hehe, I'm so clever.)

6.  If you don't want to be reminded of any updates on startup (because you can't update this), then uncheck that option in the Tools/Options section."
,remoted96052,2013-03-13T16:57Z,"Thanks for the upload. Works great on Windows 8 64bit. Had no problems what so ever. Fantastic job, appreciate your work."
,ivaldirr,2013-03-14T19:23Z,thx m8 :)
,CrAcKeZ,2013-03-20T22:52Z,"Works as expected on Win7x64 (when it prompts you for a name just put whetever name you want to appear registered)

P.S. No virus(scan with eset security)"
,Mitch0013,2013-04-10T05:50Z,"Worked great. NO viruses, And it got rid of a game I gave up hope on ever getting rid of :)"
,User108,2013-04-20T00:21Z,"Thanks, effortless install and works perfectly. The patch is a obvious fake positive."
