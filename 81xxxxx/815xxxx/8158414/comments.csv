,FDSeoul,2013-02-20T02:10Z,"I have to agree with BONES assessment on this garbage of a film, that's if you can call this things a film.

,MailerDaemon0,2013-02-20T04:47Z,"Wow, I guess one can say that this movie really IS ""The Fall of the Essex Boys""....

This is the first time I've seen .BONE. actually speak so coming to this thread and seeing how bad this movie MUST be to get him to comment like that has made the impulse to download and watch this trainwreck of a movie ""simply irresistable"" to quote Robert Palmer... :D

Great up as always scene4all.... ALWAYS appreciated even if the movie doesn't always deserve the effort you make to get it out to all of us. "
