We are Bloodsurge from Austevoll, Norway, and we want to share our album with everyone who want's to listen to it in a much higher quality and carry it with them on their portable players or whatever you want to do with our album! Just don't sell it, because we will become sad metalheads, you don't want to see that.

We just realised the label just fucked us over and doesn't want to pay out our part of the sales, so now it's our turn to fuck them over by giving you our album for free! Listen, party, fuck around and share it, we just want to say rock on people! And a big FUCK YOU to the labels and a even more huge and big FUCK YOU to our minister of culture in Norway, Hadia Tajik, for trying to censor our internet and free speach. 

Rock on people!

Bloodsurge.
