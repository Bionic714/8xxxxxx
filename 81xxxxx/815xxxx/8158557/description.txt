Join our study as we begin 1 John. Through a process of deduction, we learn the author of this book and why it matters. Just as pertinent today as in other times, 1 John is written as a sermon to the church brimming with blessing. Learn how your joy may be full through Jesus Christ, the promises of walking in the light and the forgiveness of sin.
