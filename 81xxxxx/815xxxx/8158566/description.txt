  Taking many a direct queue from The Cure, Elliott's third full-length album unleashes waves of distorted guitar intermingled with delicate, yet passionate vocals care of frontman, Chris Higdon. While the connection to previous releases is possible to see, the development of the band is also quite evident. The musical aspect laid out through the ten tracks is highly sexual, not in an overt, bludgeoning manner, rather it lulls the listener into a romantic sense of relaxation and bliss. Even with two instrumentals, the album's emotional tenderness hardly ever dissipates. The use of the strings, drum machine and keyboards creates an airy, light feel to back-up the strong presence that the distorted guitar brings to each song. While many of the lyrics are obscure, the poignant, memorable lines hit at the climax in each tune. The flow on the album never varies too much, making for a complete group of songs, instead of ten unorganized numbers. While their beginning might have had many labeling Elliott as just another emo band, the growth and beauty in their albums continues to show their remarkable resiliency and evolution.
