There has never been an actual official release of a MLP: FIM soundtrack and even if there were, season 3 just finished two days ago so there wouldn't be one anyway yet. So these are all recorded from the show. As in I put the episodes into WMM and cut out the musical parts and saved them as audio files. So there will be background noise/ talking etc. I did however convert them to mp3 so they can be played on more things. But like I said, there's no official soundtrack so I couldn't really do much else. I got the idea from the season 1 and 2 soundtracks torrent on here. 




Anyway, enjoy   :)
