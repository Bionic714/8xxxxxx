Probably crack-fix needed"

that is for me at least.
using windows xp 32 bit and UMD GPU

make sure you copy the crack after you install."
,SMARTYN89,2013-02-21T00:34Z,"Win 7 (64) here. With Ati 5850 updated. Re-installed did the crack etc.. 
Tried even in compatibility mode (for XP).

Well if it's only me I'm glad.

P.S. the file ""CGNT"" what is it for? It doesn't replace anything.
We should NOT run random configuration files. I'm  sure a simple NO-CD crack doesn't need to."
