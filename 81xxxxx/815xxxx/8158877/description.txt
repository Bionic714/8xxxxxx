Summary:

Darren Shan and his best friend, Steve, get tickets to the Cirque Du Freak, a wonderfully gothic freak show featuring weird, frightening half human/half animals who interact terrifyingly with the audience. In the midst of the excitement, true terror raises its head when Steve recognizes that one of the performers-- Mr. Crepsley-- is a vampire! 
Stever remains after the show finishes to confront the vampire-- but his motives are surprising! In the shadows of a crumbling theater, a horrified Darren eavesdrops on his friend and the vampire, and is witness to a monstrous, disturbing plea. As if by destiny, Darren is pulled to Mr. Crepsley and what follows is his forrifying descent into the dark and bloody world of vampires. 
This is Darren's story. - Goodreads Summary of A Living Nightmare (Cirque Du Freak #1)

Note: A series that has had critical reception, mainly revolving vampires, but definitely not your modern or typical vampire story. A must read! And the book was spammed with "Generated by ABC Converters", which I had to remove manually, so please excuse any errors in the books. Converted from pdf files, enjoy!
