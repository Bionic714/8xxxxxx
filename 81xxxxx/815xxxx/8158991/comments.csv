[V],LeonardTSpock,2013-02-19T06:09Z,"Great torrent. Really interesting idea. But way, way, WAAAAY too big. Hopefully some of this stuff will filter back in smaller chunks.

And yes, I know I can pick what I want, but utorrent would still put a 161.87 GB place holder on my HD, and that's too big."
,MVC78,2013-02-19T22:07Z,"Thanks for the upload but PLEASE someone break this up into smaller chunks. Heck even 20 GB chunks would be preferable to 161 GB, it's too much space to set aside while the handful documentaries on the list I would like to see are downloading."
