,zzirhp,2013-02-22T02:25Z,"According to CloneDVD, IfoEdit and MediaInfo, this is not NTSC as labeled.

Look elsewhere for an NTSC version, if anyone has even done it yet. All I can find here are screener-2-DVD's that are PAL and the R5 converted to DVD which also used 25fps 720/576 PAL during re-encode :/

Thanks anyway juutje, your uploads in general are great!"
