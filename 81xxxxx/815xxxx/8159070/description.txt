 Introduction
Your home's roof, siding, and trim form a protective envelope against the elements, but their value extends
beyond that crucial goal of keeping you dry. When selected carefully and installed properly, these three
systems create an important curb impression that adds value to your property, improves the neighborhood, and
makes you feel proud of your home. So, whether you need to replace your aging shingles out of necessity or
decide to update faded siding just to spruce the place up, your efforts usually pay dividends both functionally and
aesthetically. It's hard to go wrong embarking on a roofing, siding, or exterior trim project with the right guidance.
Contrary to what you may think, you don't have to hire a contractor to tackle a roof replacement, install
fiber cement siding, or hang a new soffit system. If you've got a spirit of adventure and consider yourself to be a
moderate to experienced do-it-yourselfer, you have what it takes to get these projects done effectively. By doing
the work yourself, you save a bundle of money in the process-and that's an enticing prospect for any homeowner
on a budget. Think you're up for the challenge? Then this book, The Complete Guide to Roofing, Siding & Trim, is
the perfect guide to get you started and walk you through every step of the process.
The first section of the book opens with an1 inspirational gallery of roofing and siding products installed on a
variety of contemporary homes so you can begin to dream about the possibilities. The next section, Planning for
New Roofing & Siding, helps you turn those dreams into reality as you plan your roofing, siding, or trim projects.
The section explains how to evaluate your needs and identify current problems with your home's exterior.
