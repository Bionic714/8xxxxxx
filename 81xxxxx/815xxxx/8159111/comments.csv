,blakemesa,2013-03-10T18:08Z,"I'm new to emulation; I've downloaded the game and am using the ps3 emulator from hackingnation. What do I need to do to be able to play? Whenever I tried opening something a dialog appears telling me to check if I have the right bios even though it says ""bios loaded succesfully"" when I startup. A readme text file explaining the procedure would have helped a lot. Help please?"

there isnt any ps3 emulators out there that are legit :( unfortunately, the one from hackingnation is just fake, so you need a ps3 and hack it, just google to hack or jailbreak your ps3 its fairly easy"
