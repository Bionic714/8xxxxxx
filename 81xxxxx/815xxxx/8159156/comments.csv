,isilox,2013-02-28T23:26Z,"get 7zip, works for me"
,Azirael,2013-03-03T18:36Z,It asks for a disk when I try to play.
[V],Wanderer,2013-03-05T21:07Z,azirael. if you update the game to the latest patch then it doesnt need a cd to play.It removes that need.You must have done something wrong
,ChiliNoMoreX,2013-04-14T02:55Z,Mask of the Betrayer expansion is corrupted and you'll get a catastrophic error during the installation... the rest seems ok
,ChiliNoMoreX,2013-04-14T04:06Z,"update:
both expansions are corrupted, so this release is useless.
download the game and the expansion one by one instead."
