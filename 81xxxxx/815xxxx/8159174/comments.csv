,Faygo24,2013-02-19T12:00Z,So 300 games is a bit of an exaggeration more like 142. But its working properly and ill leave another comment as soon as I get my first update. Good on ya mate. 
,Faygo24,2013-02-19T12:15Z,Question. Please forgive me if this is noobish but will Greenluma work for this? Or is it best just to wait for the updates? 
[V],roucher,2013-02-19T17:54Z,just wait for the updates
,aliceaje,2013-02-19T20:03Z,is this safe to use? because i dont want to be sued. lol
,aliceaje,2013-02-19T20:26Z,"Im worried that i may be caught, and i was also wondering if you could download the expansion Rift: Storm Legion"
,aliceaje,2013-02-19T22:24Z,Hoping for a quick response because this looks very appealing...
,Faygo24,2013-02-19T22:39Z,If i were you I wound't get this to play rift. Just buy the expansion. But if your wanting to play other games then this is perfect. 
,aliceaje,2013-02-19T23:44Z,"alright, but what are the chances for me being sued for using this?
or jailed...
Btw, I'm impressed with the quick response :D"
,aliceaje,2013-02-20T04:48Z,"and one other thing that has been making me worry ALOT, can i get fined/sued from downloading from this site?"
,SSJASON,2013-02-20T11:20Z,"Just make a new account if you're scared. 

Any games with server or license errors mean you need the .NCF and .GCF files. Google is your friend."
,aliceaje,2013-02-20T23:23Z,"were are those? I ended up downloading it, but i am getting that ""no license"" error. "
,sotoc97,2013-02-21T23:00Z,PLEASE MY FRIEND HELP ME!I can download only a few games...:( In most games I have an error when I try to download them.(sorry for my bad english)
,MaxMousepb,2013-03-25T19:14Z,This dont even look safe... and I dont mean a virus I mean getting sued or locked up kind of not safe
