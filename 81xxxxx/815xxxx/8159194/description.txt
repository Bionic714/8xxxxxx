********PLEASE READ***********
The auido is weird on this one. In the first 13 min of the movie as well as a few times throughout, it sounds like a dub track. It's in sync, but looks and sounds weird. This was from the source, NOT my encode! Just FYI.

A favorite Cult movie classic of mine (anyting with Tim Thomserson)!

I aLso included the soundtrack, which according to IMDB:

"In the late 80's the record label Varese Sarabande issued a special limited edition soundtrack CD for this film of about 1500 copies containing the late Basil Poledouris' musical score. It received high collectible status soon afterwards. In 1997 an anonymous collector purchased this CD for the then record sum for a CD of two thousand five hundred dollars in an auction. The soundtrack has since been reissued through another label in 2004"

SEED PLEASE! I have limited bandwidth, so I try not to upload new movies until there's at least 5 full seeds. I have LOTS more classic movies to up, so if you like my work please help out and seed, which saves me from having to seed old uploads.

Enjoy! Please Comment
