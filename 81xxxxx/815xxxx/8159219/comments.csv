if i start game from desktop shortcut for the socond time it wont work but if i run game from: 
C:/Program Files (x86)/Ubisoft/Uplay.exe
i log as SkidRow and voila i can play the game 2nd, 3rd, 100 times if i want :D"
,armandointer,2013-02-18T21:37Z,will give it a try hope it works
,rbs49,2013-02-19T17:28Z,"Yeap it works.
thanx."
,janko0120,2013-02-19T18:49Z,"@rbs49 np... ;)

If anyone have a problem when u r in game and start a mission and drops u on start of the mission... than lower your graphic resolution and u can play futher... i had such an error and i yust decrease the graphic resolution for a bit and i could play the game to the end... good luck."
,prozor351,2013-02-19T22:40Z,"I have followed your instructions to the letter, but I can't seem to get past the first 20 seconds or so of the intro without getting kicked back to the main menu."
,JuJuseventyfo,2013-02-20T00:10Z,"Just confirming from me at least that this does indeed work for me as well following the instructions above.  And works for me just using the regular Hawx 2 Direct 11 icon and not having to use the uplay one, although they both work fine for me."
,JuJuseventyfo,2013-02-20T00:13Z,"I'd guess if you guys are following the instructions above to the letter (they are very well written and almost idiot proof going step by step, nothing complicated), perhaps double check that your DirectX and VC++ or whatever those other files are updated."
,janko0120,2013-02-20T07:06Z,@prozor351 lower your graphic resolution...
,rakeshv47,2013-02-20T12:27Z,"PEOPLE....instead of going through all this shit... download the ""AAA.HAWX2.SHIELD.rar"" from SKIDROW...100% working crack...I have waited almost more than a year to play this game offline.
Any other crack other doesn't work except SKIDROW's.... 
@janko0120 -> your shit doesn't work as well ! 
AAA.HAWX2.SHIELD is only 2 steps to install.. GOOGLE it and download...update to 1.01 update and run the SKIDROW crack...installs automatically.  
I hope other fake fcukers can go die in a shit load tank"
,janko0120,2013-02-20T19:59Z,@rakeshv47 your mouth are full of shits! We dont give a fuck what u r waitn for a year! Dumbshit! U didnt even try the crack and y r so damn smart that cause problems to your brains! This is SkidRow crack. So STFU and go cry with this aaa stupid crack somewhere else! U could upload it allready if only that crack works! But we all see u r retarded gay with no atitude! Suck mine ... kido!
,rbs49,2013-02-20T20:46Z,"@janko0120
Nice lecture bro hahahhahahahaha...
By the way I'm currently playing on 1280*1024 resolution @75hertz refresh rate.
Work fine. 
Thanx again.:)"
,sze5003,2013-02-20T23:54Z,"This works if you follow all the instructions. For those that it doesn't work, if you already have a uplay account, do not use that to login. Create another one since no email verification is required.

I was getting kicked to main menu as well. I closed everything and then opened Uplay from my Desktop and pressed play on the game. Worked fine from there."
,CakeTown7,2013-02-28T04:37Z,"Here's how I got it to work.  Below is the MANUAL crack install method.  You can find automatic instructions (I have not tested) inside the NFO in the below steps.

1. Dowload Hawx 2 - TinyIso

2. Mount with Daemon Tools (or similar) and Install.

3.  Download AAA.HAWX2.SHIELD (Search Google).

4.  Extract the above file and find Crack.rar.  Extract Crack.rar

5.  Find folder SHIELD.    Extract this DIFFERENT crack.rar into your Ubisoft Game Launcher folder.

6.  Run HAWX2.exe or HAWX2_D11.exe to play."
,Anassuosa,2013-04-26T13:57Z,"Copy the random file name created by uplay to the clipboard, Ok so would some one tell me where the fuck is the Goddamn Clipboard so I could copy the fucking file, and thank you and sorry for my rage."
