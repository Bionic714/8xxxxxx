   ReCycle is a creative tool that helps you make the most of your grooves. In 
   simple terms, ReCycle lets you do  with sampled loops what you can  do with 
   beats programmed  from individual  drum sounds  v like  alter the tempo, or 
   replace sounds and  process them individually.  A tool for  quickly editing 
   sampled parts, chopping up riffs, remixing and doing mash ups. 
             
   How is it done? ReCycle will analyze  your groove and break it up into  its 
   rhythmic components. You are now in complete control and free to change the 
   tempo  or the  pitch, without  one affecting  the other.  And that's  just 
   scratching the surface. 
             
   Then  what? Load  the resulting  REX2 file  into your  audio sequencer  or 
   software sampler and you  can be the master  of your grooves, once  and for 
   all.
