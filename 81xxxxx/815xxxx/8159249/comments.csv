,george047,2013-02-25T09:20Z,"It works perfectly Windows 7,for Windows 8 there are some issues.
Install steam
Install directX
Install visual C++ 2008

Don't need to login on steam.

For those who don't work above try these"
,george047,2013-02-25T09:21Z,
,2Squirt,2013-02-25T09:26Z,"If the game doesn't start, make sure you have Steam installed (no need for a free account, just install it)."
,george047,2013-02-25T09:30Z,"For windows 7 it works perfectly.For windows 8 there are some problem.
Install steam
Install Direct X
Install Visual C++

You don't need to sign in steam.

For those who don't work above try crack v2.0
I can't post link beacause TPB is not allowing links."
,angelgamer1,2013-02-26T04:10Z, How are people getting this to work on steam?!?!
,2Squirt,2013-02-26T10:47Z,"It only requires Steam installed in order to run (it won't appear in Steam as a bought game - in fact you don't even have to run the Steam application). Edit ""LumaEmu.ini"" in the game folder to change the player name. "
,hunghung7514,2013-02-26T13:10Z,Work like a charm !
,Bruno360,2013-02-28T06:28Z,"I get this error message ""hkship.exe has stopped working"" Any fix for this error?"
,KevinPaul06,2013-02-28T17:03Z,Can you just upload the DLCs please?
,varso2012,2013-02-28T17:05Z,"Works for me. Install and play. i have windows 7 x64.
i don't now if dlc's works because i just play only the begining of the game .i dont need steam and the bink-shit error is fixed. thanks for the up great job."
,Bruno360,2013-02-28T23:24Z,"Somebody please tell me how to fix this ""HKShip.exe has stopped working"" error. I know so many users facing this error and no fix so far. its a shame!"
,george047,2013-03-01T06:22Z,"@Bruno360
did u install steam.
which is your OS?"
,Bruno360,2013-03-01T15:28Z,"@george047 Yes, I've installed steam client application built Feb 24 2013. I'm using Windows 8 32 and 64 bit."
,Bruno360,2013-03-01T15:50Z,"Yes, I've installed steam client application built: Feb 24 2013. I'm using Windows 8 Pro 32 and 64 Bit. Could you please suggest me how can i fix this?"
,varso2012,2013-03-01T21:17Z,confirmed. work for me the game and dlc's without crashes and issues. (i played an hour more or less). thanks for the up again.
,Amanda2010,2013-03-02T14:12Z,Same here. It's not working. HKSHIP.EXE HAS STOPPED RESPONDING!
,GB16,2013-03-02T21:19Z,"@Amanda2010: Maybe you still have on your computer old Sleeping Dogs files etc? If yes, then delete them all and install this Sleeping Dogs again. I had the same problem and this works. 


Also, for these, who opened the game nothing happens, then need to install just Steam. "

,george047,2013-03-03T16:17Z,"@Bruno360
There are problem with skidrow crack.it don't work perfectly in windows 8.I  installed win7 for playing this game.Also hitman Absolution."
,jaypiii12,2013-03-03T22:34Z,seed plss..:((
,Zamzumin,2013-03-11T21:13Z,"buddha.dll in the Sleeping Dogs folder scans as a malware by Malwarebytes. I think it's the same file as the Skidrow crack but if I remove it the game doesn't work, so I'm not sure what it's for. I would try a different crack."
,george047,2013-03-13T12:11Z,Buddha.dll is not a virus.it is included in crack file.Make it exeption to antivirus.
,FIREWORKKS,2013-03-16T23:24Z,"For those who have Windows 7 and can't even get hkship.exe to show up, just right click, properties, and then disable compatability mode. I think the up-loader might have enabled it during the upload."
,ClickTPB,2013-03-18T15:23Z,"Wanted to say thanks. You saved me a lot of pain. I lost my original install files, so I'd need original 8gb + 10gb + 250mb = a lot more than a clean 8gb. Cheers"
