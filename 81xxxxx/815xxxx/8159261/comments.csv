,SweatyBalls6969,2013-02-18T22:28Z,"I believe that this is correct as ep 11. Ep 8 and 9 were two half hour shows that were shown on Fri the 15th. bigfish5's upload of ep8 also contains Ep 9, thus his Ep 9 should be 10 and so on"

- Oh OK, thank you for the clarification. :-)"
,AlyH,2013-02-19T18:02Z,"this is 11 - according to the official website 10 was the reveal of bedroom 2 and this is the start of bathroom week so it is 11

the other upload combined and has the wrong 10 out there their 10 is actually the same as this 11"
,SweatyBalls6969,2013-02-19T21:55Z,TV Team have the correct numbering so this is 11
