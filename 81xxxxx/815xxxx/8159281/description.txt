Asian Dub Foundation discography

I laughed when I read on wikipedia the horrible words used to try to define the hybrid music of Asian Dub Foundation:
Rapcore, Jungle, Ragga, Dancehall...
Whatever... their music is but World Fusion with a strong accent on electronic and dub patterns.
This music is a weapon, it's combat music - something that maybe rap was in the beginning but now it's lost in USA.
ADF's sound is peculiar and really far from the rap shit of the majors with their metrosexual morons.
They belong to the European experience where the way of thinking reggae/rap is still alive and well with bands of different ethnic groups mixing together in always new experiences, each bringing their peculiar culture.
ADF brand is in the mix where dub atmospheres are suddenly perturbed with oriental grooves and also punk hints.
I guess many of you just know them well... For those who don't...
Come and taste... :)

There are 17 albums and 8 singles, including side projects of members of the band
The sampling rate is 320kbps when possible. Different rates are signed in the name of the albums folders. Enjoy :)
