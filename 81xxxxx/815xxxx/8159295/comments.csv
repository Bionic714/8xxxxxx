[V],thegreenfrog,2013-02-18T20:54Z,"What did you do with this movie? Did you take a regular DVD then upped its resolution artificially to BluRay-like? If yes, I don't see ANY reason to download this otherwise excellent movie.

Plus, the resulting file goes to almost 16 GB..."
[T],Tyr3ll,2013-02-20T12:39Z,"You're right bro,we did that and result is not so bad anyway.Btw,DTS is just fine and better with this version.It was just a test to see if it could work and be acceptable despite this new 1080p screen resolution.
Anyway,that means that we can provide a higher and better quality than the original and change sound codec as well.(DTS or E-AC3 is largely better...)
Dialog,sound effects and music are very important in this movie to get full ambiance of this particular movie.
Unfortunately this movie is still not available in Blu-ray :(
But i agree it takes probably a too huge size.
That's why we've made a 720p version to E-AC3-5.1 aka Dolby Digital plus with even a better video quality than our previous 1080p so.
However size is still somewhat large : 11,7 gb
but Worth a download anyway for sure 'cause you'll never see this specific movie with a such quality so ;)
If you really like or love this movie like us i just recommend you to grab our new 720p version and so far i don't think that you will regret it...
See yourself bro and you will still be welcome anyway 
We propose and you just have to decide for sure.
best regards"
