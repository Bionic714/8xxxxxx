,caffeine1,2013-03-03T00:50Z,"From the README file, this works on 64 bit Windows (i.e. Win7/8) but the *crack* says:

""This crack is only for 32 bit"""
,Straydog1st,2013-03-10T02:32Z,"There is a problem here on Windows 7. Every time I start the application I am **always** asked if I want to run the software, when I have previously unmarked the case ""Always ask before opening this file"", of course. Sometimes it also asks if it was correctly installed."
