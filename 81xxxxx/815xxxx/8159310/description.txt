Thanks everyone for keeping up!  Don't worry you will be done in 7 days or so if we can keep this pace up.   My seeding from 1700 to 2400 Hours every night is limited to under 1 mega bit per second due to network congestion but after midnight picks up again to above 3 mbps and that is when I get the real work done.

Part 7 takes us almost to the end of the letter C.   Don't forget to read the guide to good torrents if you are not meeting the average swarm download speeds.   Slow downloads are normally YOUR FAULT, the prime cause either too many torrents running at the same time (You should never have more than one download and one seed at any one time - better still only the one download and stop all seeding.)

OR you have not limited your upload speed to 70 percent or less of your measured maximum upload rate.
