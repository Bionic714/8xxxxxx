Its possible there are some fragments in spanish (like the 20mins of pre game show) 
during the transition
between timeouts and the plays, since the source is spanish Pay-TV...
During timeouts they switch back to their studio and analyze the 
game in spanish and sometimes there are overlapses (only couple of seconds tops)
99% is in english.
