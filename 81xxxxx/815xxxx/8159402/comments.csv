,taz420nj,2013-02-22T07:46Z,"Yet another WWB8 keygen failure from DJINN.  Don't bother with this.

Seriously guys, why upload this crap?"
,NootYu,2013-02-26T20:53Z,"Don't listen to taz420nj.  This person obviously smokes to much weed to get 3 steps right.

Installed flawless for me.

1)Run setup
2)Run keygen and enter fake email addy and click register
3)Run WYSIWYG, check Help>About and it should say ""Registered""

I advise to block the exe with your firewall as well.  This torrent is working fine for me though, thanks TorDigger for the up"
,taz420nj,2013-02-27T01:56Z,"Yeah it installed flawless for me too..  And it worked just fine until about an hour and a half into my project when the anti-piracy mechanism kicked in and fragged it.

This program does have a method to detect hacked keys, and is very spiteful when it detects them.  Just because it installs fine doesn't mean it is going to work fine, moron."
,hydromat,2013-03-13T05:41Z,"I'm afraid to say taz420nj is quite right and this happens with all versions of Web Builder, the most recent ones. I also said this a thousand times, this software is very hard to crack! give up!

NootYu if taz420nj smokes weed you snort heroin :D"
