Filmed on a Boston stage in 1991, this concert film features British comic Rowan Atkinson in selected sketches from 10 years of performing and creating characters. Fans of The Thin Blue Line, in which Atkinson plays a British policeman, will be pleased, but Mr. Bean enthusiasts will be ecstatic with the handful of great Bean moments re-created for a live audience. A real treat for the Atkinson faithful.
