This 3CD set contains all the charted Drifters tunes from 1953 through 1976 as well as selected single records by Clyde McPhatter and Ben E. King. During those 23 years, the Drifters music evolved from R&B doo-wop to main stream rock and roll and then to soul, matching the evolution of popular music. The liner notes are well written and full of interesting details on the Drifters history, especially the succession of lead singers.
