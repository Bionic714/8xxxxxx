,GoodTunes,2013-02-28T19:37Z,"@fastmine

That's because you're an idiot and can't read directions or know how to unrar files."

,mms20102,2013-03-12T21:13Z,it doesn't work on win 7
,Croatt,2013-03-15T17:27Z,"Ok, why is this game lagging so much that is unplayable? My PC configuration meets requirements, i play all other paradox games, and even much more graphicaly complex games like Shogun 2 total war with smooth flow. This game lags hard, even on 1024 x 768 resolution with trees turned off :(. I have win 7, 4 GB RAM, 3ghz dual core AMD CPU, and Nvidia card with 512 MB, and as i sad, all other games work perfect. Is there maybe a crack hiden that i didnt saw?"
,Croatt,2013-03-16T11:36Z,"Forget that, it was my mistake. I pluged monitor in wrong plug in. Instead of that of graphic card, it was in motherboard. Im an idiot, i know :) "

Epic Skull meister

Paradox is EPIC"
,doomdemon,2013-03-29T14:22Z,Please upload 1.01 patch
,Johann-Weiss,2013-04-14T01:01Z,"1 day of play shows bugs there. Why can't Paradox test games just for 1 day? Please, please upload patch."
,doomdemon,2013-04-16T01:38Z,Most annoying part is that 1.01 patch adds update button GODDAMNIT!
