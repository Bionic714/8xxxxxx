This is a superb box set, arguably the best Motown has ever released! From the early days as a doo-wop (!) and jazz group, through the soulful Detroit years and beyond, this collection has it all: great previously unreleased sides (My Heart Is Calling You), alternate mixes (I Can't Help Myself) and rarities (You Stole My Heart, with the Moody Blues). Take note of a great dance version of the Yardbirds' For Your Love and don't overlook some of the fine songs from the later years (I Believe In You and Me and Indestructible). The sound quality is excellent as is Stu Hackel's essay. A special section is devoted to the musicians who have backed the Tops overs the years. And there is even a page honoring the Andantes, who could be dubbed the fifth, sixth and seventh Tops! All in all, a very special anthology.
