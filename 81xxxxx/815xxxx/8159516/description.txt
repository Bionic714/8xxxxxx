Royal Memphis Soul is a superb, 95-track box set that collects all the highlights, both well-known and obscure, from the Hi Records vaults. Hi was one of the handful of great soul labels of the early '70s, featuring such artists as Al Green, Ann Peebles, Syl Johnson and Otis Clay. Green's popularity and reputation has tended to overshadow the other artists, who were all capable of delivering material of equal power, as this set demonstrates. In addition to all the hits, there's a number of neglected gems that hardcore soul fans will treasure. Certainly, the mammoth size of this box set means that it appeals primarily to special interests, but those collectors will find this to be an invaluable addition to their collection.
