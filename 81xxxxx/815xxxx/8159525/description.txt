No-one knew how to party more than the post-World War II nasty R n B crowd. And no-one knew better than those R n B singersjust how to use a risqué lyric and a double entendre in the cause of a real good time. Jim Wynn buttered his roll, Jimmy Wilson squeezed his lemon, the Docs sausage rocked and there was simply no stopping Wynonie Harris and his lovin machine. Those were raunch steamy, heady days. Here, in its full deep down and dirty glory (though smaller and shinier than the 10-inch version that Bull Moose Jackson was so proud of) is some of the nastiest good-time R n B of that era…(liner notes)
