Erin Tierney (Julianne Hough) leaves her abusive alcoholic husband, police officer Kevin Tierney (David Lyons), under disguise with the assistance of an elderly neighbor, Mrs. Feldman, and moves to the small town of Southport, North Carolina, where she befriends her neighbor, Jo (Cobie Smulders), and adopts the identity of "Katie". She also meets Alex Wheatley (Josh Duhamel), the manager of a local convenience store, and his children, Lexie (6) and Josh (8). Alex's wife died of cancer, and he keeps letters written by her, to be given to their children in important moments of their lives.

With Jo's encouragement, Katie and Alex begin a romantic relationship. Lexie immediately accepts Katie, while Josh is initially resistant, believing Katie to be his mother's replacement, but eventually accepts her as well. Meanwhile, Kevin continues to search for Katie using his authority as a police officer, and forges reports that she is a wanted murderer. Upon seeing her picture in the police station, Alex confronts Katie and tells her to leave town. He then realizes that he should've given her a chance to explain herself and goes to find her at the ferry dock. She reveals that her husband is on a hunt for her. Alex promises to protect her. Kevin is fired for misusing police resources. After breaking into Mrs. Feldman's home and listening to a phone message that Katie had left for her, Kevin heads to Southport to find her, after calling the number to figure out where she was.
