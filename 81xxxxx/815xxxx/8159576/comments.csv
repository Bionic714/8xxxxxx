,dohiety,2013-02-21T01:00Z,"I love how this is an ""unrated version"" but ""fuck"" is pronounced ""frack"" in the movie. Never will I read a title and expect it to be 100% exactly what it says to be."
,Coldethel,2013-02-21T02:02Z,Dohiety - Frack is how they say Fuck in BSG. Always has been.
,deagle7000,2013-02-22T14:18Z,They see him trollin'....
,pengouin007,2013-02-22T23:17Z,"It ' s the same as the small 10 episodes of last year!
Nice try.
Awaiting the real tv series.

,ProphetZarquon,2013-04-06T15:18Z,"There is no ""real"" TV series.

BSG Blood & Chrome was a series of YouTube and Machinima shorts originally aired online and then compiled into a single 90min film which aired on broadcast TV.

There are currently no plans announced to make any more episode / films.

This is all the BSG Blood & Chrome there is or will be.

Thanks YIFY!"
