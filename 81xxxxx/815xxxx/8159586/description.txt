Chronicling the life of Shivji's creation Agastya Muni, one of the Saat-Rishis, who was born to Bhargava and Indumati in Gujarat; went on to marry Rajkumari Lopamudra, and sired two sons. He also assisted in riding of demons and ensuring that Surya's passage was not blocked by a mountain; as well as descriptions of medicines that could cure any ailment; foresee the future; and one of the few who abstained from attending Shivji's wedding with Devi Maa Parvati

The movie 'Agathiyar', deals with the life of Agathiyar Muni. He is considered to be the embodiment of one of the nine celestial intellectuals who descended on earth to enlighten human beings. During the wedding of Lord Shiva and Parvati, the earth tilted to the northern side, as the whole world was witnessing the marriage. Lord Shiva gave the responsibility of balancing the earth to Agathiyar, by going to the southern side. Agathiyar, is also given the additional responsibility of spreading goodness and equality. Along with this he has the added task of spreading Tamil language. Many small stories, from the heaven and earth, are interwoven in the movie. The stories teach one to lead a simple existence without ego. It also shows how Agathiyar in his journey destroys the ego of river Ponni and Ravana, thereby teaching them the greatness of humility. The movie also captures Agathiyar's altercation with Narada, which ultimately benefits humanity
