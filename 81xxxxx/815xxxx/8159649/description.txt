 Kimsy (Kirsten Jakobsen) run away from her home, after yet another
 fight with her mom (Toril Skansen). She walks into the woods, where
 she normally can calm herself down. There she meets a helpful
 naturephotographer. Little does she know that this will be the
 beginning of the most depraved, bloodiest and horrific day of her
 life, when she is lured into a living hell, cleverly directed by a
 very brutal and extreme serialkiller.

 At the same time we go back to the 1960s, we are following the life
 of a small boy (Carl Arild Heffermehl). He lives together with his
 mom, far away in the deep woods of Trysil, Norway. His father died a
 long time ago and his mom (Sonja Bredesen) fills the house with new
 lovers every weekend, alcohol, beating and severe punishment. And the
 boys anger grows only stronger and stronger...
