From Wiki:


Malinda Gayle "Mindy" McCready (November 30, 1975 – February 17, 2013) was an American country music singer. Active from 1995 until her death in 2013, she recorded a total of five studio albums. Her debut album, 1996's Ten Thousand Angels, was released on BNA Records and was certified 2× Platinum by the RIAA, while 1997's If I Don't Stay the Night was certified Gold. 1999's I'm Not So Tough, her final album for BNA, was less successful, and she left the label. A self-titled fourth album followed in 2002 on Capitol Records.

Overall, McCready's four studio albums accounted for twelve singles on the Billboard country singles charts. This figure includes the Number One hit "Guys Do It All the Time", as well as the Top Ten hits "Ten Thousand Angels" and "A Girl's Gotta Do (What a Girl's Gotta Do)". Although she had not charted a single since 2002, McCready received significant media coverage regarding her personal life. McCready's fifth studio album, I'm Still Here, was released in March 2010 on Iconic Records and is available on Amazon and iTunes. 

On February 17, 2013, neighbors called the Sheriff's Office of Cleburne County, Arkansas, reporting gunshots. McCready was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.[1][45] She was found dead on her front porch, the same place where her former boyfriend, the father of her younger son, had killed himself one month prior.[46][47][48] McCready's two children remain in foster care and were not home at the time of her death.
