Someone asked to make a set of playlists with feel good music (Not Chill or Lounge, Songs). Wise girl (Indie Women Music) I thought. Found five more playlists to complete the wide range of ways to feel good (Nice, Romantic and Easy). Found a complete set of six, to wash away the badness in the figure 6.

Without Lies (Indie Pop), would have been included, but has been reissued to the Net recently.

Enjoy Love,


Dutch Treat - Feel Good (Pop, Folk, Jazz, Indie)

A073 The Way I Am (Easy Listening)
C001 Hide & Seek (Easy Pop)
C009 Dear Mr. President (Easy Jazz, Pop), Subtitle: I am Ready for Love.
C016 Song Of Sand (Pop Folk)
C025 Wise Girl (Indie Women)
C040 Ain't No Reason (Indie 2012)
