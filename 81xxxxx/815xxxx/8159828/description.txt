Logistics Management and Strategy: Competing through the Supply Chain (3rd Edition) [2008]

Alan Harrison and Remko van Hoek

Logistics Management and Strategy is an excellent text that disseminates knowledge and understanding of logistics in an easy-to-read way. While explaining with great clarity the theoretical concepts, it remains very pragmatic and close to business life through the use of concrete examples and well-chosen case studies. It manages to examine logistics knowledge and understanding in depth while at the same time remaining not only very accessible but really pleasant to read. Finally, its international perspective reflects the nature of logistics today.

This text is intended for MSc students on logistics courses, and as an accompanying text for open learning courses such as the global MSc degrees and virtual universities. It will also be attractive as a management textbook and as recommended reading on MBA options in logistics and supply chain management.
