Robot Chicken - Season 6 - Episode 20 (WEB-DL - 720p)
-----------------------------------------------------

Robot Chicken is back for its Sixth Season of hilariously insane, wackadoodle,
totally off the wall stop-motion animation! This season's 20 brand spankin' new
episodes will flash images across your retinas and flood your brains with an
overabundance of mind-melting pop culture spoofery that will most likely cause
your head to explode and leave a stain on the couch that will never come out (sorry Mom)!

Produced by Stoopid Monkey, Stoopid Buddy Stoodios, Sony Pictures and Williams Street.
