Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site :: On the Monday, February 18 transmission of the Alex Jones Show, Alex looks back on the Christopher Dorner standoff situation and examines the media's sickening portrayal of the spectacle as "exciting" and "like ΓÇÿDjango UnchainedΓÇÖ in real life". 

He'll also analyze the slow-motion implosion of the U.S. economy, even while some - like ex-Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan - try to downplay the severity of so-called "sequestration" spending cuts. 

Alex also further expounds on the media's attempt to spin Infowars' DHS ammo-buy story and the renewed efforts on all fronts to mobilize against the Second Amendment. 

On today's show, Alex welcomes Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke who recently urged the citizens he serves to consider learning firearm safety because of "a duty to protect yourself and your family."
