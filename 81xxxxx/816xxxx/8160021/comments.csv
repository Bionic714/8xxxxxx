I do my best as an independent poster and not being part of any group, club etc etc.. And yes this is episode four of five.. Catch you next week..;)"
,libertaswv,2013-02-20T06:58Z,"^ Thx oneanight! I tip my hat in your general direction :)

In case anyone still has doubts even after seeing that nifty green skull, this is definitely ep 4, and a nice copy too. 

Thanks to oneanight for stepping up, and to all seeders and leechers. Will seed to 20 or more
