Trying his expert hand at remixing DANK's chart-topping banger "BLOW", Calvertron has transformed the already raucous heater into a filthy, mind-boggling face-smasher of truly reality-defying proportions. Inhuman cries of anguish are juxtaposed with a marching synth lead that brings to mind the unfettered brutality at the vanguard of an unholy, carnage-filled battle. Offset by a scintillating melodic lead tastefully embellished with a delightful arpeggiated line, Calvertron unleashes his signature terrifying production in a display of pure audio malevolence.

Enjoy and don't forget to seed!
