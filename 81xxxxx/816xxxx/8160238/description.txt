Today I would like to share a very useful resource I found online for ESL teachers and learners. It is part of the BBC called Better Speaking and it is a booklet designed to help overcome some of the most common problems people face when they are learning to speak English.

Using extracts from the BBC World Service radio series, Better Speaking, this booklet looks at how you can become a more fluent speaker of English, and at some of the skills you need for effective communication.

The topics they look at include:

Becoming a confident speaker
Fluency or accuracy?
Finding the right words
Learning language in chunks
Showing where you are going
Keeping the listener interested
Being a supportive listener
Sounding natural


&lt;aLink&lt;/a&gt;
