I am uploading this to complete the discography I had previously uploaded. This includes the new single Rinkaku along with the audio rip of the DVD.

It also includes Kyo's poem book's songs and "Suisou" from Daisuke's album that features Kyo on the vocals.

Please seed! Don't forget to download the complete discography if you are missing anything. Pretty much everything I have is 320 kbps and perfectly tagged and named along with folders sorted by release/dates and covers on all of them.
