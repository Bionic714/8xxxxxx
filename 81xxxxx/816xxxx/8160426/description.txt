I was able to only capture the first two minutes of this great show, I would really like to share it with everyone but from my research so far not able to rip it in high quality.

This is where I was able to stream from but probably most countries cannot see this: http://video.citytv.com/video/detail/2127760343001.000000/the-poor-knights/oln/

direct to player: http://admin.brightcove.com/viewer/us20130212.1339/BrightcoveBootloader.swf?playerID=1565255279001&purl=http%3A%2F%2Fvideo.citytv.com%2Fvideo%2Fdetail%2F2127760343001.000000%2Fthe-poor-knights%2Foln%2F&%40videoPlayer=2127760343001&adServerURL=http%3A%2F%2Fpubads.g.doubleclick.net%2Fgampad%2Fads%3Fsz%3D640x360%26iu%3D%252F7326%252Frogers.broadcast%252FCityTV.Broadcast%252FVideo%252FPlayer%252Foln%252Fdescending%26ciu_szs%3D300x250%26impl%3Ds%26gdfp_req%3D1%26env%3Dvp%26output%3Dxml_vast2%26unviewed_position_start%3D1&additionalAdTargetingParams=%26mediatype%3Depisode%26season%3D1%26show%3Ddescending%26episode%3D2%26genre%3DReality&autoStart=&bgcolor=%23000000&debuggerID=&flashID=myExperience45047864001&height=360&isSlim=true&optimizedContentLoad=true&publisherID=1632712407&startTime=1361235502890&videoSmoothing=true&width=640&wmode=opaque

so this is hosted on brightcove.com and been researching, found getflv.net but the trial version only provided first two minutes (and I don't think the quality is great but I guess watchable -- could be better)

Any ideas please let me know!

Thank you
