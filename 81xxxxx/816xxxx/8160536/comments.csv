That doesn't even seem true 
Haven't seen it yet , 
but I call BS on what you just said."
,Jonny_ice-cool,2013-02-19T11:18Z,"Although the comment on the content of the show is complete BS, can I just remind the idiots that the comment section should be about the torrent itself or at least torrent related and NOT on the content of the show. Yes there are braindead dickheads like J3x3n, but if you want to critique a tv show (factual or not) go onto IMDB. Anyway torrent related eztv perfect as always, best place to download any torrent."
