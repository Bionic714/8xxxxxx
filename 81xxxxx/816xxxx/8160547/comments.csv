After eating my breakfast, I sat down at my computer chair, booted up Skyrim, and killed some stuff.

Then I went into the bathroom..  sat on the bowl, and took a MASSIVE ASSBLOWINGOUT SIZED SHIT.  As I lay there crying in the half fetal position.  I gingerly wiped my anus, stood up and looked at what had to be the biggest piece of shit I've EVER seen roll out of my brown crater.  

Then I watched 20 minutes of Red Dawn.. and I realized I had not even come CLOSE to the biggest shit ever taken.

Its similar to how every new movie is advertised as ""the best movie of the year"" and ""the movie everyone is talking about"".

media uses the same key words and phrases over and over because sadly the vast majority of the populace are in fact quite dumb and will fall for it ever single time.

Incorrect. It has barely changed. In fact the only thing that separates most of us from people of 2000 years ago is knowledge. With the internet we've reached an era where knowledge is almost impossible to destroy, unlike the simple book burnings of Alexandria.

""Even the neanderthals had higher intelligence that the majority of humans today.""

Incredibly incorrect.

They hide behind a made up username, and think they are so cool and tough when they trash and talk shit to other members, and in my opinion it's getting really old.

,foxvenom69,2013-02-28T07:46Z,"For all of you dumb ass fuckers who can not seem to realize yes this was a remake of the original RED DAWN, but with its own modern day twist in it all. Can the US be invaded like this yes actually we can i am a US solider and know this to be true, yes we might have the 3rd largest military in the world but as we all know if lives are at risk the GOVERNMENT will not take action straight on. why do you think we did not just bomb IRAN, IRAQ, KOREA, and Afghanistan it is cause our government is more worried about money and progress then our lives.. Which is why if this was to really happen it would be left up to the USA citizens to actually do something to stop it... and as for this movie i give it 21 stars out of 10.. it was a great fucking movie and the original was a great movie..."

,licachaly,2013-03-03T05:50Z,"Really!!, Obama trying to establish some ""GUN CONTROL"" and out comes this movie about an ""INVASION ON AMERICAN SOIL"". They are smart, they are fast, they´ve got money and they don´t care how many dead are in the schools as long YOU STAY WITH FEAR and keep buying weapons...please...BUY AMERICAN. They really UNDERESTIMATE YOU. How about a nice AD campaign replacing the face of the actors with the face of the ones who slugther your kids in your school. Remember, Remember the 5th of november..."

,libertaswv,2013-03-05T06:09Z,"I love seeing right wingers frothing and upset over a potential ""takeover"" of America. Clueless idiots don't realize they're already serfs trudging around the baronial castle. 

Here's a hint, my utterly brainless countrymen... There was already a war for control. One side showed up, the other side didn't. Not surprisingly, the side that showed up and fought won the battle. You know them better as 'the 1%'. To the victor went the spoils. You frickin' idiots aspire to be like them, rather than dragging them out of their houses by their frickin' heels to face justice for being the vampiric oligarchs that they so undeniably are.

But do keep wavin' that flag, because... y'know... pretty colors are nice.

(a special 'lol' to the 16 year old fucktard going by 'coulter2'. Literal lol at every pitiful, embarrassingly revealing word you've written, professor)

,darthbashar,2013-05-20T06:09Z,"I saw the original in the 80's, this one is terrible.  The production even recut the movie to remove the original invaders who were chinese, which is more plausible than north koreans.  Its like canada being the next world power, in another universe its possible, but not this one chachi.  Chinese influence in hollywood must be pervasive if the film company can get scared into this.
