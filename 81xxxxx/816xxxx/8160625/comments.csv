,Netarangi,2013-02-20T10:42Z,uhh wtf do AMD have to do with the crack?
,ZoopZA,2013-02-21T19:28Z,"shadohchaser, are you a moron? AMD sponsored the game so now it's their fault there's not a crack yet?

Get out of here and go do your homework, you middle-school brat."
,rosbell,2013-02-22T04:59Z,"not working to me, i've just followed all instructions and stills russian :/"
,dogoserf,2013-02-22T08:32Z,"Thanks for upload nice one

This works just edit 'system' file in main crysis directory and add: 'english' as first language in 2nd to last line and replace russian for english in last line. 
"
,Adog07,2013-02-22T10:11Z,can someone please explain the installation a bit more in depth please?
,ApeRoll,2013-02-22T19:19Z,"Verified that it works :)

For people needing a bit more help with the installation: 

1. Extract the contents of the rar file into their corresponding folders
2. Open the system.cfg file in your Crysis 3 directory with notepad
3. Change the last two lines from russian to english. These should now read 'sys_languages=english' and 'g_language=english'
4. Save the file and run Crysis 3
5. Enjoy! 

If you don't configure the system.cfg file the game will open but remain at a black screen. To be safe, you can also cut out all language files other than english in the localization and game folders."
,rosbell,2013-02-23T00:50Z,the audio from the cut scenes is not working :/
,fuhrby,2013-03-07T08:25Z,"Thanks you so much !!!! This works really great i have no problem with it. Just don't forget to change your language to English in ""system.cfg"". Thanks again !"
