"The Friend in Need"

The Jeffersonian team investigates 
the remains of a 15-year-old boy. 
Although his mother and few close 
friends saw him as intelligent with 
poor social skills, the team 
discovers that this seemingly 
innocent boy was actually involved in 
illegal activity and had attended a 
high school party two weeks prior 
where drugs were present. The 
investigation takes an ugly turn when 
an underage girl confesses to being 
raped and the deceased boy's 
reputation is compromised. Meanwhile, 
with the case's spotlight on 
deception, intern Finn Abernathy 
contemplates telling Cam that her 
daughter Michelle is in town visiting 
for the weekend.
