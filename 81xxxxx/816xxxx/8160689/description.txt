The second single from their upcoming album "Shaking the Habitual," which will be released on 08 April 2013 internationally and the next day in the US. This single, entitled "An Eye for a Tooth," is officially set to be released tomorrow (19 February 2013) but leaked on Soundcloud a few days early and has since been taken down.

Please, consider purchasing the full album when it's released. If there's one group that deserves due compensation for their hard work, it's Karin and Olof.

Enjoy!
