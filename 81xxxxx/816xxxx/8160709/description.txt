Carrie gets in way over her head when she tries to

Harlan, so she enlists Mouse's help. Tom is 
oblivious to the chaos going on in the kitchen, 
while Dorrit finds a new way to torture Carrie. 
Maggie is excited to have Thanksgiving with Walt's 
family, but when the topic of college comes up she 
realizes that she hasn't put much thought into her 
future. Elsewhere, Sebastian learns that his 
mother decided to fly out of town with her 
boyfriend, leaving him to fend for himself on 
Thanksgiving.
