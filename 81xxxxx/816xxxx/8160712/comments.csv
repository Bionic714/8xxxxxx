,ogstankyfluff,2013-03-31T04:16Z,"i listened to the 320kbps version of some nights and this version, and in my opinion, mp3 is a mastered digital version of vinyl. takes out all the natural sounds created by vinyls and filters that out resulting in a smaller sized file. If you use the right speakers/headphones, the only extra data that is in the vinyl track is the white noise in the backround. that adds alot of data to the file, the whole issue about the file size being small and not being of high quality is crap. mp3 is pretty good. the only quality that i can confirm can deliver you better sound is DTS encoded songs which there are not many."
,ogstankyfluff,2013-03-31T04:20Z,and obviously the digital flac
,ogstankyfluff,2013-03-31T04:22Z,but somehow that white noise makes it sound classically natural so maybe some people prefer that.
,rupert3k,2013-04-18T05:00Z,Thanks again 24.96 for your incredible work. Ogstankyfluff: what nonsense.
