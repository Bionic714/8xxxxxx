,cuteycindyhoney,2013-02-21T12:47Z,Thanks for being so fast to fix the problem. I hadn't even played the other files yet when I saw this come up. I jumped right on over and started downloading anew! 
,MarkNutt,2013-03-17T11:40Z,The songs are awfully quiet. On max volume with my earbuds I have to hold my fingers on them so I can hear the songs but season 1 & 2 songs are just fine. Please fix.
,Kanano,2013-04-25T04:28Z,"if you have to hold your earbuds to your ears to hear then it's probably something with your system or earbuds. It sounds loud enough for me. I've already re-uploaded this, I don't want to do it again. If you want to increase the volume, use windows movie maker or a different program. "
