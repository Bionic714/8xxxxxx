,Super-E,2013-02-19T19:10Z,"  Yeah if u wanna play it just dont go back online till release date, even then I think this thing might have some kinda secret banhammer in it so either way I gotta stay offline till c4eva gives the clear so best bet would be to just stay offline and wait for the word."
,Super-E,2013-02-19T19:15Z,Its an ISO just be warned though Micro shaft isnt playin around with this so the bann hammer is gonna be poundin dat azz with no lube!!!!

,Super-E,2013-02-21T17:56Z,Yeah u need to have a flashed/ Jtag/ Wasabi 360/RGH/3key in order to play it
,darkmark666,2013-02-23T04:52Z,"To Every one that has download this here are tips

1: Never Play Online Untill the Reless Date

2: You Need A Mod Xbox 360 to Play Burnt Games If You Dont Have One Get It Done There Kind of cheap Now (Most Mod Shops will only do Xkey Now Which i Think is Great for $130.00

3: All Ways Run The ISO File Through ABGX360 Frist

If your Xbox 360 Gets Banned Then you did not Follow These Simple Steps. If Your Course about Playing this Game then Wait Untill the Reless Date."
,Super-E,2013-02-23T14:53Z,I've never used ABGX360 and I been on this modded 360 for years wats up!?
