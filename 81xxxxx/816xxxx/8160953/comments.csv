As soon as the achievements are upped to the live servers on re-connect (along with dates of said achievements), a simple script call complies a partial list of offenders (combing profiles)for the next ban wave. Either don't play (or connect to live period) before the release date, or expect a not-so warm welcome in June/July of 2013. I personally could care less about Live, that's why you use 2 consoles. Sorry, I just saw some folks mentioning what will substantiate a ban, and thought I'd share my knowledge on the subject."

,quinnarty,2013-02-21T21:33Z,"in response to @IPoutcast 
Using ImgBurn to create backups of games you already own:
Dual Layer DVD ( Verbatim Brand )
iHas B DL DVD Burner
Run your game iso through ABGX360

For those of you creating backup games,
XGD2 Games LayerBreak = 1913760
XGD3 Games LayerBreak = 2133520
Open your .dvd file in notepad and make sure that the layer break is set for either 1913760 or 2133520 depending on if the game is XGD2 or XGD3. 
To check to see which your game is, visit the XDG3 Website and search your game. 
If it has a Wave Number next to it, burn with XGD2 Layerbreak. 
If it says XGD3 next to it, burn with XGD3 Layer Break. 
I'm sure most of you already know to burn at 2.4x. 
This game is obviously XGD3 so use XGD3 Layerbreak, I just copied most of this from my other posts.

,illjones,2013-02-21T21:34Z,"@flatak
I believe its splitscreen offline.

@IPoutcast
its an X3GD disc, you must have an IHASb burner with the right settings. Just search how to burn X3GD. IF you have done all this then I'm not sure. 


ALSO. Microshit updated live and anyone stupid enough to NOT have 2 consoles (one for offline another for online) will be a victim of the 'ban hammer' even if you do not go online on a different account as Microsoft will check the achievements unlocked and console ban you. This is all sweet if you never want to go online, even after launch. Chur"

Ex: when forza 4 was uploaded my friend and i downloaded it and played together he then decided to mod rank and credits. then at the main menu 2 days later he was flagged.

Download the torrent, run abgx. It will say its not verified, but that it is stealth checked. That's perfectly okay. 
Proceed to burn it, you should know how to do that. If not look up a tut.
Now to play! Disconnect your xbox from all internet connections. Either unplug the ethernet cord or disable your wireless adapter. Then plug in a flash drive to the xbox. Create a new profile and name it whatever you want, and SAVE IT TO THE FLASH DRIVE. Now sign in to that profile, and load up Gears. When the game asks where to save your information, check FLASH DRIVE, not hard drive. 

And then you can play without fear of being banned. I literally just did all that, then took out my flash drive and gears, signed into my main gold account, and was not banned at all. If you follow those steps you will not have a problem :D"

Some games I realized will play fine truncated, especially the older XGD3 games. But for some reason the latest games seem to be much anal about the burn quality. 

Now, the best method to burn it properly is to burn it using an iHas drive flashed with burnermax firmware using Verbatim MKM-001 or MKM-003 with proper imgburn and EEPROM settings. 

Burnermax payload tool will only work on some compatible drives, and even though it recognizes and patches your drive, it doesn't mean that it's burning a good copy. 

This was my case. I had certain games that would give this error randomly or at specific parts of the game. I invested in an ihas drive and flashed it with burnermax. Now all my burns are great and error-free. "
