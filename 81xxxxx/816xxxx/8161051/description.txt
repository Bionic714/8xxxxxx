"Who's Sorry Now?"

Sung is forced to meet with Risk Management's 
Fran Horowitz after refusing to apologize to 
the wife of a patient who died on his table. Ty 
and Michelle face a moral dilemma when a 
seemingly schizophrenic homeless man cannot 
provide the informed consent needed for life-
saving surgery. Sydney and Lieberman can't 
leave work behind during their date. And Buck 
is forced to evaluate his callous behavior 
after being named in a lawsuit by malpractice 
attorney Mitch Tompkins.

Evolve... or die.
