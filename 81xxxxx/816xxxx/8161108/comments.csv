,cpoustie,2013-02-19T11:03Z,2000 seeds and no one mentions that audio goes out of sync halfway through?  During the dance they miss the last 10 seconds or so and skip past the next ad break.
,misslilac,2013-02-19T11:16Z,Audio goes badly out of sync after dance sequence - unwatchable after that point.
