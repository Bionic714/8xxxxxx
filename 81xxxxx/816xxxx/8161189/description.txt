Strategic Relocation is meant to help you relocate around serious threats or develop contingency plans when you can't. In this third edition, we continue to help you pick safe areas in the US and Canada using new and updated tables, maps and analysis. We have also added descriptions of international areas that may offer some safety under certain circumstances as well as a totally new in-depth analysis of each state and province of the US and Canada with full-color maps showing geography, land-use and threats to security. Included are practical suggestions for those who must remain near urban cities pointing out nearby areas for a retreat.
