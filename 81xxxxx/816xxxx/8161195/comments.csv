Until YIFY posted a version of this, yours was the only high quality/low file size version out there in 1080p. And, just from a standpoint of comparing bitrates, your encodes are actually better than YIFY's by a little bit video-wise, and significantly better than YIFY's in the audio department, and they aren't very much bigger in terms of file size. You do great work. Hope to see a skull by your name soon."
