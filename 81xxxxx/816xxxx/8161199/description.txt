While working together, they strike up an unlikely friendship with hopes of starting up a successful business. However, there is one problem, they don't have any money. The two women come from two different words. For one, Max has to work two jobs just to make ends meet and for the other, Caroline is a sophisticated uptown trust fund princess who is now forced to give working as a waitress a shot after and "run of bad luck". Max sees Caroline as a waste of space until Caroline finds that Max loves to bake cupcakes and she sees a possible business.

While working, they meet some interesting characters. Oleg (Jonathan Kite), a Russian cook, Earl (Garrett Morris), a 75-year-old cashier and restaurant owner, Han Lee (Matthew Moy). Both girls look forward to their "big break". Created by Michael Patrick King ("Sex and the City" ) and writer-comedian Whitney Cummings ("Chelsea Lately" ) comes this fresh comedy in the world of waitressing and the hopes and dreams we all have of making it someday.
