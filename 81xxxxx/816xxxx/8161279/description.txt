Woody GuthrieΓÇÖs Dust Bowl Ballads were first issued as two 78 rpm records in 1940 before eventually being compiled on LP format during the 1960ΓÇÖs, when a new generation of musicians such as Bob Dylan took inspiration from his music. Accompanied by just an acoustic guitar and some occasional harmonica, his sparse, elegiac songs depict the hardship endured by inhabitants of the American prairies when enormous dust storms swept throughout the region, rendering the land infertile and causing a mass exodus of more than two million people. Guthrie had firsthand experience of the issues he sang about and infuses these songs with stark, chilling imagery that belies the often peppy musical backing, such as opener ΓÇ£The Great Dust Storm (Dust Storm Disaster)ΓÇ¥s observation of ΓÇ£our relatives huddled into their oil boom shacks/and the children they was crying/as it whistled through the cracksΓÇ¥. Elsewhere he describes the frequently unhappy fates of those that fled to California, as inferred in ΓÇ£Dough Re MiΓÇ¥s warning that prospective migrants would be better served to ΓÇ£stay right where you areΓÇ¥. Despite the grim subject matter, a vein of optimism pervades throughout, most notably on ΓÇ£Dust CanΓÇÖt Kill MeΓÇ¥, whose narrator remains defiant despite suffering a multitude of ignominies and tragedies.

Part folk record/travelogue/oral history, many of the songs on Dust Bowl Ballads have since become folk standards and their themes of poverty, inequality and economic depression are just as relevant today as they were seventy years ago. Anyone with even a passing interest in classic American folk music should pick this one up.
