Please note the following: 
Positioning your iPhone correctly in the vehicle is very important to ensure optimal GPS reception! We recommend that you use the NAVIGON Design Car Kit for the iPhone, which includes both a designer suction pad holder and a car charger, enabling you to charge your iPhone during the journey. Available from specialist retailers or from the NAVIGON shop directly at www.navigon.com!

Should you experience GPS reception problems with your iPhone, please refer to the FAQ on our website:www.navigon.com. 

Allowing GPS to run in the background for extended periods can lead to a significant reduction in battery life.

Whether in the car, by bike or on foot, NAVIGON hopes you have fun navigating.
