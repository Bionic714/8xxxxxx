Umberto Ferrari, aged government-pensioner, attends a street demonstration held
by his fellow pensioners. The police dispense the crowd and Umberto returns to
his cheap furnished room which he shares with his dog Flick. Umberto's lone
friend is Maria, servant of the boarding house. She is a simple girl who is
pregnant by one of two soldiers and neither will admit to being the father. When
Umberto's landlady Antonia demands the rent owed her and threatens eviction if
she is not paid, Umberto tries desperately to raise the money by selling his
books and watch. He is too proud to beg in the streets and can not get a loan
from any of his acquaintances. He contracts a sore throat, is admitted to a
hospital and this puts a delay on his financial difficulty. Discharged, he finds
that his dog is gone and, following a frantic search, locates him in the city
dog pound. His room has been taken over by the landlady and the now-homeless
Unberto determines to find a place for his beloved dog, and then kill himself.
Unsuccessful, he resolves that his dog must die with him and he stands in the
path of a train, with his dog in his arms.
