,Falar,2013-02-19T07:25Z,Forgot to mention this but I am currently running on borrowed internet until I can get into a new place so the download speed will be a tad slow until more people can seed and I can get stable internet. Sorry for the inconvenience.

I can seed for a while on broadband once I get the full 600Mb"
