[T],theburningbush,2013-02-19T08:57Z,"ziggyff - I don't disagree with your desire for smaller versions sooner, but I'm just happy that with tonight's Letterman, as well as tonight's Fallon, even though they're highres-only for now, at least they're not stuck for hours and hours and hours and hours and hours and hours and hours and hours and hours and hours and hours and hours and hours with 0.000 availability, as has so often been the case with the highres versions of the late-night shows.
