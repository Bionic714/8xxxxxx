For XVID AVI with MP3 audio, in a panic driven stupor I claim:
V=9
A=9
.
I can't believe the 2HD version hasn't been nuked.
From 28:12 to 28:39 the sound from the previous scene with the video from the next.
Which means everything after that is out of sync by some 27 seconds.
It's 28 seconds shorter than this, from EVOLVE
