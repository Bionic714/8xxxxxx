,xarinl,2013-02-24T11:49Z,"YIFY Dude which country did you source this from (ie which country did you get the Blu-Ray or whatever you need to rip this source from, since I see March 2 as the release date)? I have been waiting for your release eagerly."

,xarinl,2013-02-24T16:25Z,Maaan ... waiting for these movies is a horrible experience. I like watching them end to end. I'm gonna wait for all the parts of Hobbit series to come out before watching that series.

,hihuy,2013-04-29T17:29Z,"you forgot to put YIFY in the title- it doesn't come up in the search ""twilight yify"""
,rpgmaker,2013-05-12T00:11Z,The image quality of this is very good as usual from yify but I found the sound having a very low volume. I had to set the volume above 100% (~150% to be exact) AND the VLC to the maximum volume in order to be able to listen to this. Very weird for a YIFY release.
