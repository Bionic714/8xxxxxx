,pythonista99,2013-02-19T16:08Z,Bullshit.  Any schmuck that believes in this free-energy crap deserves all the spam that's going to come his way.  Simple rule of science : there's no such thing as a free ride !
,krew671,2013-02-19T16:18Z,idk do your homework. Many famous and non famous people are the reason why you are even using a computer came up with this technology before you where even born. You are believing what oil and electrical companies want you to believe. Its not impossible. I have a person who deal with electronics for his job and he thinks what in this torrent is very possible but he tried to talk me down from it. The he looked at the files himself and it raised a eyebrow. Traditional generators everyone is used to does not apply here. Youtube has alot of fakes so people can get views but there are legit machines that take low amps and make alot of RPM. Nikola Tesla has many devices in this torrent. Also the story of him and many others who got killed or de funed for trying to help humanity.

,pythonista99,2013-02-19T20:58Z,"It's an ad-survey.  That's it.  I rest my case.  
@krew761 - I bet you believe in perpetual motion too !  And running car engines on pure water !   And while you're at it, why not the Yeti, the Loch Ness Monster, Bigfoot, Fairies, Vampires and ghosts."
,mrmagoo25,2013-02-19T21:28Z,"Just skip past the ad, but would have been better as a torrent."
,krew671,2013-02-20T05:33Z,"There are different methods dude. Which ever comes across first that is doable. Some of the things in this download are a little weird and very off the wall. But there are practical devices in here. I am skeptical on alot of these devices. But some to most I can actually understand. The cars running on water was actually on a ""real"" news network as a story. But whatever. Its the internet and I ain't going to get butt hurt. It isn't my torrent so... meh. Nice troll insult BTW. :) Like one practical Idea that is in here shows that you can actually still use the grid power. But the power from the grid turns a generator coil and you get more out then you put in. Its not going to run itself. I'm not that stupid. Or use solar panels. Even charging batterys from the phone line. Or using the free energy from a phone line that is way cheaper then a electric bill to charge a deep cycle battery to get free lighting or turning a generator coil. Stuff that is not to far fetched. But yes it should of been a torrent. Kinda irritates me. But the ad is kinda annoying but its not that bad. 1 ad and skip. "
