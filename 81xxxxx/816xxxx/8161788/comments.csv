,Zoticus,2013-03-06T20:43Z,This could be the greatest literary torrent ever.
,Gelfryd,2013-03-09T22:58Z,"Great torrent, but wheather there is any chance of the supplement which would add the rest of Loeb Classical Library to the complete 520 volumes edited so far."

I cannot leave new comment on The Pirate Bay, i don't know why. Man, this torrent would be grateful but it is not. After closer watching I see, after downloading to my hard disc, that is not much worth. I expected something better, sth up to date. These are very old editions, from the initial life cycle of series. When Loeb Classical Library was censored, from sex, homosexuality etc. This torrent package lacks newer and of newest editions, the new editions and resumptions of Loeb Classical Library. Could You scan, edit and upload edited and published volumes of the Greek and Latin series respectively. If You did so, this would be great. Then I would appreciate it much. After the first euphoria, when I saw this torrent on The Pirate Bay, now I feel great disappointment. This torrent is nothing more than just very antiques, now being located already in an public domain. Unfortunately, I would prefer newer, and hence better Loeb Classical Library. Gelfryd
And here's my reply:
Dear Gelfryd,
To comment on TPB, you have to sign up!
What I got is what I got. I disagree that these older editions are censored though the new ones may be more politically-correct.
I'd LOVE to see a more complete torrent, Gelfryd, so get on it!"
