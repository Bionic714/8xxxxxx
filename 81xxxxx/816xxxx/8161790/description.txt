Proficient contemporary multi-instrumentalist Aeoliah (Ay-oh-lee-ya) is well-known among celebrities & health practitioners for the powerful healing techniques of his music. His understanding that sound and light are spiritually energized, inspires Aeoliah to compose his many diverse and rich musical compositions that bring so much joy, comfort, healing, and inspiration to so many of his fans around the world.

"Beautifully recorded, this album is a spiritual tool to empower one's physical, emotional and spiritual well-being by activating and balancing the body's eight energy centers, known as chakras. It includes an easy reference guide for each energy center!" (guide not in torrent) 

This guy has a very unusual voice to say the least. His angelic voice will make you trance out. This is great for insomniacs. Bear in mind that the normal chakras relate to your physical body only. The higher dimensional bodies such as your etheric body have their own chakras AFAIK.
