,Blaue,2013-02-19T19:54Z,Tack så mycket!!!
,brk254,2013-02-25T04:45Z,Embedded subtitles. That's cool.
,ScarletteSpider,2013-02-25T14:54Z,"i tried 5 different other file sources here at PB for this movie that for 10 days had no one seeding despite what the numbers said there should have been for seeders.

I finally downloaded this source and it fully downloaded in under 12 minutes.

Ty uploader and seeders for your generous bandwidth speeds.  

The next time I want a movie fast, I'll live with swedish subtitles just so I can actually watch a movie same day.

I only wish you had the LOTR extended trilogy available, I've been downloading that one for two months and i have only 81% of the first movie and none of the other two with a top speed of...are you ready for this ridiculousness?...0.7kbs"
