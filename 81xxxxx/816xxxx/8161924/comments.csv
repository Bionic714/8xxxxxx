,itspfaff,2013-03-20T04:11Z,Anyone know if the Metro pack works with mac? If not I will post soon if I have any luck.
,itspfaff,2013-03-20T04:55Z,Unfortunately it will not allow me to extract. Getting an error part way through extraction.
,RNBWDSH,2013-03-22T21:22Z,"As far as I know, it must be a mac problem because I haven't had any other complaints yet"
,martinh65,2013-03-26T15:00Z,The Metropolitan requires a separate license that I cannot find a generator for.
,vipervince,2013-04-09T22:52Z,"Downloaded. I allready have Element 1.6.
Metropolitan Pack requires a licence. 

It's NOT included. You have a solution or a licence??"
,RNBWDSH,2013-04-29T14:52Z,No ideas unfortunately. I don't see how it requires a key though. It's just an addon to element which really is just a folder with all the models instead of a separate plugin. I've installed on both CS5 and CS6 on multiple computers using element 1.5 and it worked just fine. Are you sure your 1.6 isn't what's asking for the key?
