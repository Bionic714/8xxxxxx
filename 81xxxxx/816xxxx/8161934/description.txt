About This App:

Updated:
    January 20, 2013

Current Version:
    2.60

Requires Android:
    4.0 and up

Category:
    Tools

Description:

Many Samsung devices store a flash counter that keeps track of how many times you have flashed *custom* firmwares to your device. On some devices, a yellow triangle or other sort of visual warning is also displayed during boot if you are running a *custom* firmware. TriangleAway was built do disable the triangle (if a visual warning is present) and reset the custom ROM flash counter to 0. This app requires root !

You can find out the current status of your flash counter and firmware state (custom or official) by booting into "download mode" on most devices. The usual way of getting into "download mode" is by first turning off your device, then turning it on by pressing and holding volumedown+home+power. Alternatively, the "adb reboot download" command also often works.

When you run TriangleAway, if your device and firmware are supported, it will show you the detected state of the binary (custom or official) and flash counter value, and the option to "Reset flash counter". Please confirm that the information shown is correct before resetting the values.

On a number of devices, TriangleAway can work, but your firmware may not be supported directly. In that case, the app will tell you it needs to reboot into a special boot mode, which will be happen if you select "Reset flash counter". The device will reboot into a special mode which will allow you to review the current status and reset the binary and flash counter values (or abort and do nothing).

!!! THIS IS A DANGEROUS OPERATION AND COULD POTENTIALLY BRICK YOUR DEVICE. PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK. A USB JIG IS PREFERRED IF YOU HAVE A WORKING ONE !!!
( and by brick I mean brick - only a board replacement or a JTAG unit will be able to save you, don't mess with boot(loader) stuff unless you *really* mean it! )

Note#1: using Triangle Away may unmount your SD card. Reboot or manually remount it from Android settings.

Note#2: on the SGS3, the "system modified" status can only be reset on some firmwares.

Whether or not Triangle Away works depends largely on your kernel. Flashing a different kernel may make it work if it previously didn't.

Variants that are NOT based on Exynos processors but rather on Qualcomm or Nvidia processors are NOT expected to work. I honestly would NOT try (until further notice) - examples are the Skyrocket and AT&T Note.
