,teddybare,2013-02-19T12:40Z,"Thanks! Is it just my computer or is the video not stretched enough? When watching, its very narrow. I never had this before...."
[T],ShoReleases,2013-02-19T12:42Z,"Message from RKSTR: ""Play the file in VLC or MPC and change the ratio to 16:9. I tried something new guess it didn't work"" ."

,donkeyfish99,2013-02-19T13:04Z,"I think the Housewives would be happy with this one - the video is so stretched that they all look impossibly skinny! I feel like I dropped acid watching it, hilarious. But thanks for the upload :)"
,donkeyfish99,2013-02-19T13:07Z,Yeah it works just fine if you switch to 16:9 - thanks again.
[T],ShoReleases,2013-02-19T13:25Z,@everyone: Open the file with VLC -> Select Video Option -> Aspect Ratio -> 16:9

,souldout,2013-02-19T16:05Z,"thanks for the upload! is it possible to re-encode, as i watch on apple TV and the aspect ratio cannot be changed on it. "

,Tenerife-Lad,2013-02-19T18:43Z,"Can you recode it to a standard aspect ratio?

I am unable to change the viewing format on my USB media player."

,springali,2013-02-19T20:54Z,Thanks guys! OXO
,lou888,2013-02-19T21:17Z,"Cheers RKSTR! Opened with VLC, changed aspect ratio 16:9 and perfect. Thanks again for your time, greatly appreciated!"
,byong,2013-02-19T22:59Z,"Thanx Sho! 

For those lazy ass idiots out there if you don't know how to play it look it up on the internet. Don't ask someone whom has taken their personal time to upload these videos in the first place and then be an inconsiderate dumb f**k and ask them to change the file. Figure it out yourself unless you're too stupid. "
,Thelxi,2013-02-19T23:06Z,Thank you for managing to upload this without any drama :)
,MSSHJM,2013-02-20T00:10Z,Thank you!!

I really appreciate your effort!

:)"
,Thelxi,2013-02-20T01:07Z,"For those that are cyber-challenged like myself:

right click the VLC screen -> Video -> Aspect Ratio -> 16:9"
,pulpintro,2013-02-20T02:55Z,Thank you very much!  16:9 looks great to me!  :)
,leander3932,2013-02-20T03:26Z,"hey byong, stop being so rude .. no one cares about your opinion......................i have a state of the art 4 month old computer, and i cant watch this vid. i am not a dumb f..k. i am just mechanically challenged. so f..k off. and it would be greatly appreciated recodeded. thank you. and as rkster knows, we appreciate all his vids. they are always HD , and great quality. xox "
,_Newf_,2013-02-20T04:49Z,"Hey byong, YOU dumb f**k!  How many of the people watching Beverly Hill Housewives do you think are THAT technically inclined to know how to change the aspect ratio on a file?  Not that they all don't, but I'm sure a lot wouldn't.  And how about those watching on AppleTV where you can't change the aspect ratio for a file....dumb f**k?
You really feel the need to insult other like that do you.  It's no wonder you are sitting there in your Mom's basement watching Beverly Hills Housewives  you f**king loser!"
,BoonesFerry,2013-02-20T04:54Z,Thank you. 
,MOONVIEW,2013-02-20T07:15Z,Thanks for shared. :D
,BoonesFerry,2013-02-21T14:57Z,"If a person can figure out how to download and install a torrent cleint, manage files, and play a video file...i think they should also be able to figure out how to adjust the aspect ratio. It's not rocket science. Apps have menues...check'm out. 
:P"
,_Newf_,2013-02-27T03:27Z,"Hey BoonesFerry, AppleTV is not an app.  Can you please enlighten us as to where to adjust the aspect ratio on AppleTV?

I know how to adjust the files but to give others shit for not knowing how is ridiculous.  Some geeks really need to get a life."
