I was hoping for a real gritty documentary about the dangers the men and women in air rescue go through in a mature grown up, nothing held back tell all like the documentary ""restrepo"". 

Instead, what it is, is a fairly tame, pg, family friendly look inside these people's lives. "

,budskee,2013-02-20T22:44Z,"Wolfy-Z, 
You make good points, and I agree it isn't fair for me to compare the two. Like you said they are shot in different styles. 

It's just that the style restrepo was shot in, is what I was looking for in this show, and it's not quite what it turned out to be. Which doesn't make it a bad show or lesser than. Just not what I was looking for is all. 

I'm going to hang in and catch a few more episodes to see where it takes me.

More on topic for other downloaders, it's a great torrent and fantastic quality. A/V ratings are arbitrary, so I'll just leave it at that."
