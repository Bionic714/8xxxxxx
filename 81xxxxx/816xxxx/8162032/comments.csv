,jerseyemt,2013-02-19T11:06Z,"I uploaded this because the Amplitube 3.9 Mac torrent has several effects that do not work -- rack delay, rack chorus, some chorus stomp boxes, and others.

This is fixed in this version (3.9.1).

Enjoy!"
,rockmixer,2013-02-19T17:31Z,Thank you! I was wondering why the delays weren't working in my copy of 3.9 and just assumed it was something to do with my system.
,zarquonp,2013-02-19T18:14Z,"No ""seperate"" crack, is this an AU, VST or what?"
,jerseyemt,2013-02-19T23:19Z,"@zarquonp The crack *is* separate. After unzipping, you'll see the install DMG and the crack installer.

This is the Mac OS X version of Amplitube 3.9.1, and can be used as an AU or VST plugin in any Mac DAW.

I use Logic, and Amplitube shows up automatically as an AU when you restart Logic (or rescan for plugins) after install."
,jerseyemt,2013-02-20T07:24Z,@zarquonp Just a clarification -- this includes both the standalone version of Amplitube as well as the VST and AU plugins for OS X.
,zarquonp,2013-02-20T15:26Z,"Thanx, found it, Works fine!"
,chaostastic,2013-02-24T17:20Z,Great. thanks!
,jenkinsjones,2013-05-18T12:59Z,"Hey there, I downloaded, installed, ran the crack and all seemed to be fine. However, when I tried to open both the standalone and the AU version, i get an error message that says the Amplitube 3.vpa exectuable cannot be opened.
Any ideas what could be the cause/how to fix?

Cheers anyway
