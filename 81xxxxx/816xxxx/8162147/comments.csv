If you figured out how to install, can you please share? I'm not sure what to do or what program I need. I have powerISO."
,TheDragonReborn26,2013-04-09T10:55Z,"@jsoudy: You don't need any program to open it. No unraring or mounting necessary. Just run the

""Install_New_Super_Mario_Forever.exe""

And that's it.
