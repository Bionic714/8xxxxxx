last upload said 10 but it is really 11"
,SweatyBalls6969,2013-02-19T21:54Z,This is 12
,DngnRdr,2013-02-21T08:05Z,Either get all FQM releases or all Bigfish releases and it won't matter what number is on it... you won't miss anything and you won't waste time downloading double ups.
,AlyH,2013-02-24T10:49Z,"yeah my problem with that DngnRdr is that if I remember and catch it just as it airs so I want to download it straight away, bigfish is first - but if I'm not on top of the upload the other is a lot smaller, and I prefer smaller file sizes, for both hard drive and download reasons, but I don't have the patience to wait for the other if I see this one up! lol

I really like this show and this is the first season I'm watching, so I'm a little impatient at times lol"
