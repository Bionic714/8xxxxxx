,DeansPalley,2013-02-19T13:33Z,Thanks again from up North RayCort.  We'd never see this in our neck of da woods.  Much appreciated.
,Pdid,2013-02-19T15:43Z,Raycort>Thank you for the extra effort in reseeding the torrent. One of my favorite uploaders :)
,CarolR,2013-02-19T15:49Z,"Thank you Ray! You're the best. I copied the original file into the new folder, renamed it the new file and forced a recheck. I now have it 100%. I recopied it into the old file and now I am reseeding both. 
The seeding is going slow on both, but I will keep it seeding for 5 hours. I will have to shut my computer down since it overheats. 
I will come back later this evening and start seeding again overnight. "
[T],RayCort,2013-02-19T16:36Z,"@CarolR, I appreciate your willing to seed. If only others would follow your lead then I would not be so upset at those Hit and Run people. I know some that download my torrent are learning to seed and share, so thanks to all who care enough to seed!"
[T],MrUnpopular,2013-02-19T18:07Z,Thank you so much. Highly appreciated.
,dpg3,2013-02-19T18:35Z,"@RayCort Thanks so much for the ReSeed. I will seed back 1 to 1, always do!!!!"
,dpg3,2013-02-19T19:53Z,@RayCort Thanks I now have 100% and am seeding back 1 to 1 !!!!
,dpg3,2013-02-19T19:53Z,Nice to see people seeding!!!!!
,cindy25,2013-02-20T03:08Z,"since many people dl this (and others) from the mirrored sites (KAT, aha, extra , new, etc) try putting a request to seed in your torrent description.

they mirror both the torrent and the description.  

I am almost at 100% seeding, but I will continue to seed for another 8 hours or so,when it will be burned to dvd. "
,dpg3,2013-02-21T03:05Z,I seeded 4.33 GB hope that helps!!!
,jjungclaus,2013-02-23T04:37Z,"Can someone please post what my settings should be on uTorrent so I give back (seeding) the right way. I downloaded the reseed as the original stopped around 59% but have been seeding since yesterday and don't know which column or numbers to look at to know when I've done my part. Now, when you answer, pretend I am torrent illiterate as I set up uTorrent according to some website showing the optimal settings. Thanks again, RayCort, for reseeding :)"
[T],MrUnpopular,2013-02-24T05:52Z,Have you tried removing and readding the torrent?
,cindy25,2013-02-24T13:12Z,"@jjungclaus 

set to forced seed."
