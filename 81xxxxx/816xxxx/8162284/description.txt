Date: May 25, 2012

Sara Tavares was only 16 years old when she won two of Portugal’s  most prestigious TV music contests. Born out second generation Cape Verdian immigrants, Sara grew up between two cultures. Initially known as a singer and composer of Gospel, Funk and Soul, she gradually incorporated more of her African music in her compositions. Her second album "Mi Ma Bô", produced by Parisian Lokua Kanza, reached gold in her native Portugal and was a mix of African rhythms and melodic pop songs.
