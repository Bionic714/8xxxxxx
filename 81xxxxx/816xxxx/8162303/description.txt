When Australia's favourite home-cooking show returns for its fourth series in 2013, the table will be set for a few extra guests.

My Kitchen Rules is a competition for average joes to cook off against each other, but the food isn't the only thing boiling. The series is full of drama and tension,  technique and looks, so enjoy.
