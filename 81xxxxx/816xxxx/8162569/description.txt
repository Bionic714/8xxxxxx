Cold Warriors: Wolves and Buffalo

Nature Documentary hosted by Jeff Turner, published by PBS broadcasted as part of PBS Nature series in 2013 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

For thousands of years, wolves have hunted buffalo across the vast North American plains. Although westward settlement of the continent saw the virtual extinction of these vast herds and their eternal predators, this ancient relationship was not lost altogether. On the northern edge of the continent's central plains, in a place named Wood Buffalo National Park, buffalo and wolves still engage in epic life and death dramas. By following one pack of wolves, wildlife filmmaker Jeff Turner captures how these two animal species live together in what seems like a forgotten corner of the world.
