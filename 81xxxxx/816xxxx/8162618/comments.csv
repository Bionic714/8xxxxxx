,darkmark666,2013-02-23T04:58Z,"To Every one that has download this here are tips

1: Never Play Online Untill the Reless Date

2: You Need A Mod Xbox 360 to Play Burnt Games If You Dont Have One Get It Done There Kind of cheap Now (Most Mod Shops will only do Xkey Now Which i Think is Great for $130.00

3: All Ways Run The ISO File Through ABGX360 Frist

If your Xbox 360 Gets Banned Then you did not Follow These Simple Steps. If Your Course about Playing this Game then Wait Untill the Reless Date."
,BoxingClo,2013-02-23T18:46Z,You can play this game on an account not tied to xbox live without getting banned. 
,krimzontide,2013-02-24T02:55Z,"@lordvo1demort12, your obviously doing it wrong...use a jtag console and eliminate any errors.
counterfeit doesnt mean fake, try reasearching before trying to detroy an innocent uploaders reputation. and if you still having problems its because your hopelessly noobish. GhostNet FTW once again."
