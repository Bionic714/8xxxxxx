Poker.Stove.Poker.Odds.Calculator

PokerStove is a program that calculates hand equities (i.e., expected percentage of 
the time that each hand wins at showdown).

Since poker is a game of incomplete information, the calculator is designed to evaluate the equity of ranges of hands that players can hold, instead of individual hands.

Pokerstove can calculate both pre-flop and post-flop equity given the community cards.
