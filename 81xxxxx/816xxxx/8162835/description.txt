A ruthless girl gang known as Pinky Violence has just hit Las Vegas. The odds are stacked against them when they run up against the girl in charge of casino security -- The White Canary! But her piercing shrieks and superb fighting skills may suddenly put her in a very big spotlight -- and we're not talking about one found on a Vegas stage.
