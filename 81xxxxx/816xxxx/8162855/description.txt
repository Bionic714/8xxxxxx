Welcome to Little Atlantis, just another ethnic neighborhood in Seattle, except many of its residents need water to breathe and the hippest clubs are the ones that are submerged. Everyone's excited by a visit from Mera, Queen of Atlantis. Everyone, that is, except her sister Nautica, better known as the villainous Black Manta!
