I'm in ROGERO 4.30 and I have copied the game into the intern HDD of my PS3, but when I run the game it takes me to the XMB and ask me to update to version 4.31. I have installed the fix that I've found on the web, but it still returning an error. Could you please upload a valid fix? or could you tell me what i'm doing wrong? Thanks!"
