,Pyrepenol,2013-03-20T04:37Z,This is a great idea but it's hard for me to believe it's legit. This should be up on a website rather than on TBP
,w4r3zh4ck,2013-03-20T16:30Z,And why should it be on a site rather than TPB?
,Pyrepenol,2013-03-24T07:40Z,"Mostly because it requires a torrent client to download. It's stupid having to download Vuze just so I can download a uTorrent repack. Also, there is very little information here about what this repack does. It just seems sketchy and my first instinct tells me that it's probably malware. Having a website up with some information would help cull that instinct. You have a brilliant idea here it just needs some work."
