As always bringing you crapwareless repacks of your favourite bittorrent client uTorrent! There is really no way you could completely remove all the crap because first of all the frogram is not open source and even if it was, my programming skills haven't developed yet lol. That being said, all the shit features are hidden like all my previous repacks. Optimised for fast downloads!

Changelog:
- Fix: gdi leak in add torrent dialog and devices panel
- Fix: remove torrent dialog, default to 'ok'
- Fix: fix flushing of completed pieces immediately
- Fix: fix disk flushing not being triggered every time it should be

REPACK Changelog:
- uTorrent will no longer install on Win2K, Win95, Win98 and WinME
- The installer will not overwrite "resume.dat" and "resume.dat.old" files.
