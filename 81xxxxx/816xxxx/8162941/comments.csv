,Heinzieie,2013-02-20T23:30Z,"Don't call it ""season 6 (complete)"" when there's 24 episodes and episode 17 is comming out tomorrow (the 21'th February)..."
,Heinzieie,2013-02-20T23:32Z,"I notice it's your first torrent. Great job on gathering the 720p's but just name it ""The Big Bang Theory Season 6 E01 - E16 (720p)"" or something."
,forlay,2013-02-21T14:43Z,Is this torrent reliable?
,DarthDiclonius,2013-02-22T20:05Z,"It would appear that I'm stuck around 73.8%. Judofish are you still seeding? I'm only getting 0.1kB/s. 

Look forward to when it's done. Thanks for the upload. :)"
,Mooshroom,2013-02-23T15:55Z,"Was also stuck around 70% yesterday. Left it running over night, now it's bumped up to 96% Avalability is still under 1 (0.968)
Looking back at DL speed history I see that it spiked up to around 130kB/s a few times during the night, but it has been stuck at about 2kB/s for the past 6hs

Had a few episodes done, excellent quality V/A:10
Thanks (:

,SlappyDM,2013-02-24T00:30Z,"Been stuck @ 96.34%, with seeders at same percentage.  all episodes 100% with the exception of epsiodes 4, 10 , 8, 6, & 9. All those are between 88 - 94% complete with no seeders (peers) above 96.34%. Ohh well."
,juqii,2013-02-24T15:03Z,"I only downloaded the episoded 11-16, so I dont know about the 1-10. Everything else was good but episode 12 is missing 9%.

Please seeeeeeed!"
,cooperr,2013-03-21T01:59Z,"i have 30 seeders, and its only downloading at 10 KB/s ..... wtf.."
,FruBjork,2013-04-24T21:50Z,How can you call it complete when it´s missing 8 episodes? THIS IS NOT A COMPLETE SEASON 6. Only 16 episodes
,malimt,2013-04-27T03:48Z,"Dude stop confusing people by saying (complete season 6) because you know it is not complete i dont know why you have to lie people will just fuckin hate u for wasting there time and ur ruining ur own reputation on pbay, not that its that that big of a deal but still the point is not to confuse people, might wana re-upload it or take it down otherwise ill have a talk with (moderator jankov) to remove this torrent ASAP"
,lars.etch,2013-05-17T02:13Z,"LOL on the complete part... and a big rofl for the tags part, seriously dude season finale is on CBS right now and you're claiming to have the complete series with just 16eps "
