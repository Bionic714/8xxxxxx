,dmiMyranib,2013-02-19T18:14Z,"That is a great upload, for sure ! I have already downloaded, but unable to open the XML file ! 

I used :

/Notepad++     [ File is too big ]
/Mozilla Fire Fox [ Error on Line 6 Column 1 ]

To read the XML File, none was able to open it !

Help !

,radioman-lt,2013-02-19T23:37Z,use Large Text File Viewer: swiftgear.com/ltfviewer/features.html
,lets_do_it_the_indian_way,2013-02-20T04:57Z,I am going to send this file on a flash drive to Mars . Then no one would be able to raid it . Fuck yeah !
,nginx,2013-02-20T16:38Z,Good luck to the MAFIAA. Try and stop file sharing now. Every pirate on earth can now keep a copy of TPB on their HDD. Share away people!
,Kalkusa,2013-02-20T22:28Z,"Reading the XML File in  ---Large Text File Viewer---
is just horrible is there any alternatives? "
,romintang,2013-02-21T00:19Z,"Dude, write your own program code to read and parse the XML, in C++, Java, Python, etc.... there're ton of XML parsers in the Internet. "
,atndigcrk,2013-02-21T04:23Z,"as a uploader here , i love this alot"
,TheMXL,2013-02-21T04:51Z,The power of millions is now in my possession! 
,wasifmehmood,2013-02-21T11:38Z,"well my little question is how can i use it.i dowanload it i open it but i cn,t find any torrent there.now plz tell me how can i use all this"
,SoftSex,2013-02-21T17:03Z,Good luck trying to stop piracy now! Tons of people with this in theyr hdd or any other storage devices! Never mess with a pirate!
,kbilek,2013-02-21T21:36Z,Apparently the XML is not well formed. I will post the well-formed one afterwards (sorry guys)
,T3chEra,2013-02-22T00:07Z,"I'll be waiting to download for the properly formatted XML, then. I wanna put this on a flash drive, but want it to work relatively without issue first >.<
We appreciate your time and efforts, uploader!"
,kbilek,2013-02-22T21:16Z,"Some people noticed that the XML files are not well-formed and valid. I am sorry for that, but I made perl scripts that will make them both, see https://github.com/runn1ng/pb-archive-make-valid. The script need perl, bash and sed, so you will need linux (OS X will maybe be sufficient but I have nowhere to try). I think it is better solution than uploading the file again; I am again sorry for the inconvenience.

Also - to everyone that is trying to open the file in notepad/something crazy like that - the file is NOT intended for ordinary usage instead of pirate bay. There is not point in manually searching in 4GB XML file."
,T3chEra,2013-02-22T23:44Z,"Out of curiosity, is this something you intend to continue doing? Will there be future archives? How often do you plan on making updated archives/when will the next one be?"
,Bodhi2010,2013-02-23T13:31Z,"how do use this XML file? http://bvlist.com
people want to make their own tracker

[H],shirepirate,2013-02-26T02:17Z,"@kbilek

there are at least 2.4-ish million torrents. out of curiosity how many magnet URIs did you come up with?"

,theguy39,2013-02-28T05:11Z,Could you release this in csv format!?
,romintang,2013-03-03T23:58Z,"Will be much easier to utilize this xml when it's converted to database, 
use this TPB tool: ""PremiumSoft Navicat Premium Enterprise v9.1.8+Keygen+Serial"" (8FAFC86BD3B8B87CE595159C8F584935CE5EE732) to import/convert xml to database (Mysql, oracle, sql server, postgresql, sqlite).
will be much faster to read/search data in DBMS format."
,marco22222,2013-03-09T04:53Z,Hello everyone. IMHO the most convenient to access and use the data is with an application that is already designed to handle hughe amount of news/data. Would it be possible to import the xml file into a feed reader such as RSS Owl? I wonder if the same would be possible for the BitSnoop archive.
,chunkymunky9000,2013-03-13T05:02Z,"Ah yes, but does the archive contain a link to ITSELF?"
,dlfx,2013-03-16T15:39Z,POWER TO THE PEOPLE!
