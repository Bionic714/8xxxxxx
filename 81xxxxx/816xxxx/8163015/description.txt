Complete Pirate Bay archive (from February 2013).

Includes all the possible information - names, descriptions, comments, seeder and leecher info, date of upload, size info and quality marks (only for some torrents, before before TPB took it down). 

It does NOT contain the torrent files, but it does contain magnet links. 

For both experimenting and archival purposes.

It's in developer-friendly XML.

Unzip with 7zip. More information here - http://runn1ng.github.com/piratebay.html
