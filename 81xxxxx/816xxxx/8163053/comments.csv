I'll seed this as long as humanly possible.  Watching ""Marco Polo"" right now - so glad I don't have to put up with the shitty VHS quality on these babies anymore!"
,peri-lives,2013-02-25T05:58Z,You are my hero. Been looking for high-quality Loose Cannon reconstructions for ages.
,struggler420,2013-03-15T15:47Z,"I'm very interested in this torrent but i have a question before I start to dl it: Are these reconstructions made from the actual archived video formats, or are they like other reconstructions I've seen that are made up of still frames with audio dubbed over them? If these are full motion video files I will seed forever, but I already have the choppy still frame recons and dont want more of the same. Those are hard to watch, they move so slow it puts me to sleep. Thats why I hope these are different, I'll finally see what I couldn't stay awake for!"
,prolsi,2013-03-16T05:43Z,"struggler420 - you have to understand that for many early Doctor Who episodes, there are no full motion videos. It's not a matter of waiting for a proper torrent; they just don't exist, period. You can read more about this here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_missing_episodes . Unless they are miraculously discovered in the future, reconstructions like the Loose Cannons are the best we're ever going to get for these episodes."

So would I. Too bad it's impossible."
