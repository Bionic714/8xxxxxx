Doctor Who - Loose Cannon Reconstructions of Lost Episodes
 
These are reconstructions of all the missing episodes of Doctor Who from the 1960s. They were created by Loose Cannon (www.recons.com). Previously only available through trading of VHS tapes, they have been recently uploaded to Youtube from the best original sources possible. These are mostly DVD quality.
 
Because Youtube keeps blocking many of these videos, they are being shared here in their entirety for eternity.
 
Included are the original AVC encoded files available from Youtube in the best possible quality of 640x480 @ 25fps. All cuts made to get past the Youtube content ID system have been repaired. Split episodes have been rejoined. Minor audio sync issues have been corrected. All have been re-muxed into MP4 container files. All of this was done using direct stream copy and smart rendering. That means they are not re-encoded and are the original quality. Basically, this is the best version of all reconstructions available unless Loose Cannon ever releases their original files without Youtube reencoding.
 
Included are all missing episodes from the following serials. No episodes from official BBC releases of existing episodes is included here. You must buy the "Lost in Time" box set to fill in the gaps.
