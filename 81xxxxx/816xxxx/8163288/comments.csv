,n1x4,2013-02-21T03:18Z,"Works fine.. If you receive version error don't you think it's time to update? 

Yes, works with THETA. All unlockers included,"

,youcifer,2013-02-21T14:38Z,"""...To be continued"" OMG! :D I am actually excited to play the next part! Didn't feel that all for the main game, which disappointed me so badly. The Wolf cloak is great and Connor finally becomes the assassin you could hope for, and not just another warrior. 5/6 for a DLC that, so far, is way better than the main game itself."
