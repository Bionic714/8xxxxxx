,Ahlat,2013-02-19T15:51Z,Thank you for this. My favourite X-Men run.
[V],STFmaryville,2013-02-19T16:34Z,"you're welcome Ahlat, for me it's either this one or claremont/cockrum/byrne on uncanny (1975-1983)"
,Ahlat,2013-02-19T17:12Z,"I haven't actually ever read Claremont's run, how many issues is it? Also do you have a link to a torrent of his run?"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-02-19T19:40Z,"Ahlat you're in for a treat, although Claremont's writing wasn't paced as fast as 21st century comics are.

Chris Claremont wrote the title for 17 years, #94-279, and then returned for #381-389, and again for #444-473. The Claremont era I referred to was Uncanny X-Men #94-164, drawn by the late Dave Cockrum, then by John Byrne, then by Cockrum again.

You could get the whole thing from
http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7352128/The_Uncanny_X-Men__1-499
That's well-seeded.

An easier way to jump into it might be grabbing #111-140 in the form of Marvel Masterworks - The Uncanny X-Men Volumes 3, 4 and 5 from
http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7955113/

And if you do that, get Marvel Graphic Novel - The New Mutants and Marvel Graphic Novel - X-Men: God Loves, Man Kills in the same torrent. If you enjoy those five books, you'll want to go back for the rest."

,marvelnerd76,2013-02-20T17:14Z,This is awesome! You are the best!
