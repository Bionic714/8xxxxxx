Thanks how I can install the crack tell something about this. The NIS detect a virus why? "
[V],2010kaiser,2013-02-20T00:08Z,"@anni1994

It's being detected as a 'False Positive'. Turn your A/V off until you have it installed. It's perfectly safe."
,MrPiss,2013-02-20T17:24Z,"Will not run. Keep getting ""tuneupsystemstatuscheck entry point not found"" even on uninstall. Had to do system restore. Any solution?"
,MrPiss,2013-02-20T18:31Z,OK Figured it out. I disabled internet and didnt allow it to update. Works fantastic! Thanks!
[V],2010kaiser,2013-02-20T21:46Z,"For anyone else having difficulty installing this software. Your internet must be disconnected and the installer MUST BE RAN AS ADMINISTRATOR

ENJOY!!!"
,Crusnikk,2013-02-21T07:20Z,I will try to disable my connection and not allow update. everytime i use the crack is says a file is missing. wont even allow me to uninstall unless i force delete it. Ill be back to update.
,Crusnikk,2013-02-21T07:45Z,"Yup, definitely disable internet connection. Thanks for the advice and the program!"
,Crusnikk,2013-02-21T07:56Z,I forgot to ask. should we also turn off auto update?
[V],2010kaiser,2013-02-21T13:37Z,"@Crusnikk

Yes. Turn off updates."
,chalotn,2013-02-21T17:03Z,"How do i turn off uptades?

Does this release solves the problem all the 2013 releases have? (works for a couple of days than gives the wrong serial pop up because this release has a feature that checks for any changes in the program and automatically banns it)

Anyways ill see it for myself and comeback here in a couple of days to let you guys know. 

Thanks alot mate, really appreciate the hard work."
