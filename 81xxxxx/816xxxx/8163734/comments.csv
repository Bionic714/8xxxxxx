,canopener,2013-02-20T23:21Z,"This copy looks great, but the last time I DL'd a WEB-DL, a BluRay copy came out 2 days later... aargh"
,raiannub,2013-02-21T00:37Z,Alguém pode me falar um pouco mais sobre a qualidade do AUDIO/VIDEO????
,nuborn13,2013-02-21T23:02Z,"For some reason, I'm unable to convert this file to be played on my console (Rebox and mkv2vob failed at it). VLC has no issue reading a file so I suppose its just one of those unsupported weird DTS encoding."

Thanks for the up aol, awesome quality."
,keithhall,2013-02-24T23:35Z,"IMDB states this has multiple languages...

Are there eng subs for the non-eng-parts only (hardcoded or otherwise)?

Hunting down non-eng-only subtitles is next to impossible and not to sound ungrateful but missing the foreign language dialogue is incredibly irritating.  You're missing out on (sometimes important) parts of the movie."
,o3xC,2013-02-25T05:31Z,"Download went very quickly; however, when opened in VLC it stops at 8 seconds in. Not sure if anyone else had that problem."
