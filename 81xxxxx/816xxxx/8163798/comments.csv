,Luciphage,2013-02-19T19:16Z,"Dude, I've been looking for this for a while. This is the best pinball sim out for android. Lots of authentic tables, a total blast from the past. Highly recommended for anyone that actually remembers real arcades. This version works perfectly on my low-end Coby Kyros MID7042 with ice cream sandwich.

Thanx much, you fucking rock!"
