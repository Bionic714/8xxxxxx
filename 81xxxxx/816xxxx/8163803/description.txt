A book i "made" of creatures and enemies from Skyrim. 
When i was playing Skyrim i ventured onto on of the several Skyrim wikis online. I fell in love in on of the sites production value and quality and wished to have it in paper form. So i took the content directly from the site and shoved it into a Adobe inDesign program and spewed out a pdf after some weeks.
So if you like the content and shit you can give money to the site i took most from:  
http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/The_Elder_Scrolls_Wiki

I did not make any of the articles or screenshots. I only made the pdf.

I will make this into paper format on lulu.com at some time. If anyone want to buy it (i will not take money for it, the cost on the book will depend on what lulu takes) i can post a link to you. 

If it is something that is wrong or something, the post a comment or send an email to me:
