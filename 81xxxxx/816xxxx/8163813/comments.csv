,chrisroberts3,2013-02-19T19:43Z,Does it finally have Gamepad 360 controller support for Windows PC or what the fuck is this? Its no wonder why it sold so bad because it lacked proper gamepad support in the first place. PC gamers wants to play with gamepads too just like our console friends.

I think this is a crack only not the full update."

,Furious1964,2013-03-24T19:38Z,Please upload a working one as this is complete crap and ALL torrents of this update should be nuked.
