I just checked the numbers and the Party Hardcore 77 that have been uploaded to TPB are actually PH78 (they renamed them) at the moment, according to Tainster there is no PH77 (but they have re-edited a new party, which might end up being the new PH77)

Confused? you should be!

,daonebomb,2013-02-22T07:09Z,"Lol ... Confusing indeed!
I'll wait for your new ups anyway.
Thanks a million fella :)"
,daonebomb,2013-02-24T12:54Z,Ive also noticed that tainster have gone softcore recently .. Vol 77 (or 78) and this one 79 are very disappointing ... I mean lots of hot birds getting banged but all you get to see is side view or view from the back ... its like they are censoring stuff ... no pussy shots at all :( 
,zipomatic,2013-02-25T21:10Z,"Party Hardcore is getting worse, that's for sure. I much preferred it when the girls wore jeans and looked like regular amateurs and not dressed up in stockings and tights so they would appeal to the people who like Tainster's other fetish sites."
,daonebomb,2013-02-26T07:04Z,"Exactly! ... I couldnt agree more :)
Time to find an alternative :D"
