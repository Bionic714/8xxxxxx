,3x3tr4tor,2013-02-24T16:25Z,"Okay I got it working. I also have LAN working, it works great, but everyone's names are Skidrow. My question now is how do I change my username? "
,ollar,2013-02-26T15:37Z,Cracked? Finally? DL-ing it to find out now.
,ollar,2013-02-26T18:01Z,"Ain't no way to get it to work. Fuck sake, hate to diss on hard work(if it works) of the uploader, but post some god-damn instructions on how to crack. The .exe stops responding after I copy the crack."
,ollar,2013-02-26T19:09Z,"Right. So I might have rushed off a little bit. Got it to work and after long last, HAWX 2 is available. Thank you for the upload."

,brunsquad,2013-03-27T05:50Z,"Having a tough time getting this to work, keep getting game launger erro code 2 when launching with uplay. Any better instructions ?"
,hazardose,2013-04-18T01:34Z,"brunsquad, for me a Windows restart helped solve the ""Ubisoft Game Launcher Error 2"" issue. However when I click on the story mode, and the game would begin, after a short time it drops back to the main menu. ...in the options menu, however, I could test the game in the display settings submenu. It looked great. Shame I can't play... Anyone any ideas (except buying the game)? ;-)"
,eronixs96,2013-05-03T13:15Z,help please it need cd key and activation code.
,HawaiianGuy,2013-05-09T01:03Z,It took 3 years for someone to crack it? I no longer want to play this game it's too old now but thanks for the upload though.
