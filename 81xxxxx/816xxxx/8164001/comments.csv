,dangermouse2001,2013-02-20T08:13Z,@lostinmyhope can you pleeeeeeeeeease upload s03e13 - the last uploader uploaded a wmv file and it sucked. Awesome job with this one
,dangermouse2001,2013-02-20T08:14Z,i meant the last uploade you uploaded sucked (quality wise). thanks again
,bigfatgrits,2013-02-20T21:29Z,dangermouse - I'm sorry but that's probably not going to happen as I would have to rerecord the file then reupload. I have a bunch of other torrents I am working on trying to get uploaded and I don't have the greatest upload speed so redoing something probably won't happen right now. Sorry. Perhaps someone else will upload a better copy.
,erindodd4,2013-02-22T05:33Z,season 4? awesome!
,Wilfro,2013-02-25T21:05Z,"Thanks so much for uploading.
The quality does not matter to me because I've become so addicted teen mom 2.
