,WaltG,2013-02-19T19:50Z,"Tested not work (no quest mark on map)

,man2375,2013-02-19T20:29Z,You won't find it as a quest. You will see it as a main menu option after you install patch 1.03
[V],Gh0stNet,2013-02-19T20:38Z,which crack are u guys using ?? this unlocker is only for reloaded version 
,WaltG,2013-02-19T20:55Z,"Yes I find in menu Tyranny...

But problem with connection server ubisoft game cannot playable..."
,Machine4578,2013-02-19T21:44Z,"guys you need to have RELOADED's v1.03 update installed!!!!!!!
the copy the save files to the programdata/orbit/54 folder..
at the main menu is the DLC..

NOTE:
this DLC is not in the main game, you need the DLC (1gb) files that are not provided here"
,kobby2k12,2013-02-20T02:15Z,"@Machine4578  where are the DLC files..I have the washington DLC menu from the 1.03 patch but I can't get the setup to recognize my version..Can you please help.

@Ghostnet  Can you please upload the DLC that Machine4578 is talking about"
,Jman2919,2013-02-20T02:18Z,.
,Machine4578,2013-02-20T03:11Z,"@kobby2k12
he already posted a torrent.. but if you have a repack it wont install.. you must have either the THETA, RLD or SKIDROW release with the updates installed for the new DLC to install.. the DLC checks registry entrys, and without them you are screwed.."
,kobby2k12,2013-02-20T05:47Z,@Machine4578  that sucks..which version should i choose (reloaded or skidrow). Do these versions use uplay for saves or an alternate way.  I am on sequence 9 with benedict arnold completed..I have to use brucies tool to convert my saves right?
,Machine4578,2013-02-20T09:13Z,"@kobby2k12

it doesn't matter what release.. RLD, THETA, or SKIDROW.. the game files are exactly the same..
i personnally am using the THETA release with the RLD crack, and all works perfect.. as far as the saves, having Brucies tool will makw no diff what crack as it can convert saves to any of them"
,WaltG,2013-02-20T09:24Z,"This is not function Unlocker!

I have  in my game folder!
Assassin's Creed 3 - Reloaded 
update 1.01 RLD

I have installed  Assassin's Creed 3 - Tyranny Of King Washington  1.05GB DLC

I have this save in ProgramDataOrbit54

In game menu is:

but still not work (needed ubisoft server connection) 

Im not stupid! Im experienced game player with cracks"
,youcifer,2013-02-20T11:36Z,"HOORAY ... I've had luck to make the DLC work, but I had to put the savegames in a DIFFERENT folder than given in the install notes: 

C Documents and Settings All Users Orbit 54"
[V],Gh0stNet,2013-02-20T14:03Z,"Here is the New Proper DLC unlocker for Theta ,Skidrow and Reloaded versions :- 
http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8168145"
,WaltG,2013-02-20T14:09Z,"C Documents and Settings All Users Orbit 54

still doesnt work!!!

needed connect to server Ubisoft...."
,dato0201,2013-02-20T15:18Z,"torrent works 100% for sure ...

1. install 1.02 update ( whatever your original version is ( SKIDROW, THETA, RELOADED ) 
2. install 1.03 update (This one was only from RELOADED version i found so far )
3.copy the torrent content to C/programdata/orbit/54

Enjoy !!!

and many thanks to Gh0stnet !!!"
