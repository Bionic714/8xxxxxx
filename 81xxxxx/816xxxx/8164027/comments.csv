,chrisroberts3,2013-02-19T19:44Z,Does it finally have Gamepad 360 controller support for Windows PC or what the fuck is this? Its no wonder why it sold so bad because it lacked proper gamepad support in the first place. PC gamers wants to play with gamepads too just like our console friends.

Hi there.
Buddy, since I've read some negative comments about the crack included with ""Citadel.DLC"",which also includes update 1.5. (supposedly crack fucks things up)...
... am I to understand that this is a fixed .exe crack?
I didn't finish my download of the ""Citadel"" yet, but people were suggesting to remove update altogether, and stick with update and crack from 1.04. So I'd prefer to find out first, before I apply new update...

Would you mind clarifying? "
