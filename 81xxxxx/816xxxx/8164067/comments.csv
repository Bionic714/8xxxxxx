Sorry, but I could not find an ebook format of your book. I've searched and as far as I know, there was no ebook released for that book. It was only sold in hardcover. 

However I can still find a different book for you."

A 'cult' author passed away last year whose stuff I've been dying to read as he's billed as a 'gothic Hunter Thompson/Charles Bukowski' (hailing from the southern US): Harry Crews.  Have totally struck out finding any of his titles in any digital format (not particular epub/mobi/pdf).  Any ideas?  Also William Manchester's trilogy of Winston Churchill, The Last Lion (i have all in hardcover but would like digital format if possible).  Another impossible to find book(s).  Thank you."
