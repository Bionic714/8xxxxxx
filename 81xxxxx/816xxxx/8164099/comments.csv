,gazda96,2013-02-19T20:15Z,we dont need this becouse we cant start game
,nu2mlock,2013-02-19T20:42Z,"If you would have read the description this is ONLY for people who have bought the game already. NOT those who want to pirate the game.

And yes, those who have purchased the game can start it. Some have purchased the Russian version and need the English files.

Stupid."
,GoreBacke,2013-02-19T20:59Z,Buying the Russian version when you speak English. Yeah that is pretty stupid.
,ZoopZA,2013-02-19T21:27Z,"GoreBacke, you can get the Russian version a lot cheaper than the English version online and then just download the english language files. That's why people buy the Russian version when they speak english.

I wouldn't call saving $20 - $30 stupid."
,dandalis,2013-02-19T22:21Z,"smart thing is just to wait till proper release by extremezone, HeroMaster or one of the good rippers."
,GoreBacke,2013-02-19T22:47Z,"I'm well aware of the reason. However, buying a foreign release just to save a few bucks, and then having to copy over the language files every time you install is balls out retarded. How about you just wait till the game is on sale for $5, or just straight up pirate it? Oh wait, I forgot. You probably just want to play the mediocre multiplayer that will be half dead a month after release."

Well, I could create a torrent for the whole pack, but there's no need seeing they're already here.

This pack is - like I said - ONLY for those who PURCHASED the game and want the English files.

@GoreBacke
Like ZoopZA said, a lot of people purchase their games from Russian sites for a lot less than the English ones. And saving a lot of money by doing so - all they need is the language packs. Hence, not stupid but instead cleaver. You just didn't know about it."
,nu2mlock,2013-02-19T23:01Z,"@GoreBacke
First off - there's no way to pirate the game. Yet.

Second, some people do want to support the developer by purchasing their games instead of pirating them. Even though we might get them for 25€ instead of 50€, we're still supporting them - especially when purchasing 4 copies like me (I would never buy 4 copies if I had to pay 50€ each).

Third - wait for a 5$ sale of Crysis 3? Yeah, you'd have to wait a couple of years. Some people might want to purchase it without waiting that long.

Fourth - Saving 33$ per copy is quite a lot, especially when I myself buys 4 copies.

Downloading a torrent and replacing some files is the same as downloading a crack and replacing those files. Only if you've already bought it you'd be saving a lot of money too.

There's nothing wrong with buying the game."
,GoreBacke,2013-02-19T23:42Z,"No way to pirate the game? Then why is it already on my hard drive?

Also why would you want to give money to EA / Crytek? Their games range from mediocre to terrible, not to mention EA is one of the worst companies in the video games industry.

The game is a glorified benchmark."

Thanks for the upload!

There is also people like me, who speak Russian, but don't like crappy russian localizations or prefer original language of the games.
If you don't like the game or EA - don't play it. Problem solved."

,ZoopZA,2013-02-20T01:55Z,"@Gorebacke - so saving $20 - $30 with the only trade-off being that you just need to press ctrl-c, ctrl-v is now a sign that you're stupid?

Maybe when mommy stops paying for your stuff you'll learn to understand the value of money. :)"
,GoneM4d,2013-02-20T03:16Z,There's a special place in heaven for people like you.
,MEGodObeyOrDIEeee,2013-02-20T06:08Z,"Thank you nu2mlock, I really appreciate people like you who want to help others who are in need. I dont need this file, but as these morons commenting here are very hostile against you, they are idiots and dont know better. Keep up the great work, there are allways someone who will need these kind of helping hands, so dont listen to the idiots here, just keep on trying to help people, as it is shows how much more of an person with character you are than those lame ass negative thinkers we got to read stupid messages from here on this page and other TPB pages/torrents. So keep up the great work, even if it is the smallest thing, as long as it helps someone, you are doing a good thing here! These loosers here, propably live in their parents garage/cellar, not paying rent (bums dont earn money), so anything they do and say, means nothing, as they are so selfish that they truely think that society (or all others than them selves) owe them something, and this means they think that downloading a game they like is ok, because its their right as assholes to do as they please!? Fuck y'all.... You will burn in hell boys! :) Ill see you there then..."
,MEGodObeyOrDIEeee,2013-02-20T06:19Z,"PS. I download games too, but I dont think its my right as a human to do so. And most games I really like, I often buy the game, even if I already played it through ones on the downloaded version. Not because I have to, because I want to support, truely, those developers that make us these great games. Im not saying pirating is wrong, Im just saying that if you like something, remember that there are 1-200 people been working on this for 1-2 years, so we can have a great time playing the game. They DESERVE to get payed. Its not the programmers that get rich by games, its the producers, the developer companies, the CEO´s, the Presidents, the Owners, the shareholders that get all the millions that games make in revenue. But those little guys that really make these games, they dont get shit if the game doesnt sell! "
,Doremonhg,2013-02-20T06:23Z,@GoreBacke: I don't really want to comment but your stupid way of thinking makes me want to prove that you are plain stupid. There is nothing wrong with saving money. Not everyone in this world has unlimited money that they can spend without having to worry at all.
,pApAkal,2013-02-20T06:54Z,when is the crack coming plzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz tell me tpb team plz plz plz upload the crack
,yomama2013,2013-02-20T10:10Z,GoreBacke i hope you are just trollin. You have to be the biggest retard on the internet if not.
,dandalis,2013-02-20T12:40Z,"yeah screw EA, i dont wanna get ripped off by buying legit version, huge overpay."
,H0P4,2013-02-20T16:49Z,"A must need, many thanks dead nu2mlock (hope its working, couldn't try it yet obviously :))."
