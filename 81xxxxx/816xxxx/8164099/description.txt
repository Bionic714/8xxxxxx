There is an English pack on TPB already, however, that one only enables English voice in-game and subtitles.

This torrent includes the file "Video2.pak" and a pre-edited "system.cfg" which enables English subtitles, English speech in-game AND English speech during pre-rendered videos (for example loading screens and the "recap").


NOTE:
For now, this is only useful for people who have PURCHASED a version without English (like Polish/Russian).


THIS IS NOT A CRACK, ONLY THE FULL LANGUAGE PACK INCLUDING ENGLISH VIDEOS!


How to install:

1. Copy the content to your Crysis 3 directory.
2. Start the game.
