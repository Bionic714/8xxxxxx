Reviews/Synopsis
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just in case some you of reading this have never actually seen ROTLD, it is an unofficial sequel to Romero's 1968 classic Night of the Living Dead. Return starts off at the UNEEDA Medical Supply Warehouse in Louisville, Kentucky, where long-time employee Frank (James Karen) is training the new kid, Freddy (Thom Mathews). Frank explains to Freddy that the movie Night of the Living Dead was based on a true story--an incident in Pennsylvania where the government used an experimental chemical to spray on marijuana, which inadvertently resurrected the dead. All of the contaminated bodies where sealed up in special containers, and mistakenly shipped to UNEEDA, where they sat in the basement for nearly twenty years. But when Frank shows Freddy the canisters, he accidentally releases the chemical gas, and all hell quickly breaks loose. Meanwhile, Freddy's punk rock friends are partying in the cemetery across the street from UNEEDA, only to find themselves fighting for survival when, through a series of ridiculous mishaps, the gas from the canister in the basement reaches the corpses in the ground. Next thing you know, the dead are clawing their way out of their graves, and looking to feast on human brains.
