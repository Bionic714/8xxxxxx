,DngnRdr,2013-02-20T13:30Z,"stall74.... perhaps you should calm down but if you're going by bigfish's numbering, he numbered the two consecutive episode (a regular episode followed by an 'unleashed' episode) as one episode whereas FQM had them as separate episodes (as per the official site). The exact same thing happened last year and bigfish renumbered a bunch of episodes IIRC. If you can't keep track of the differences, then only download one source or the other."
