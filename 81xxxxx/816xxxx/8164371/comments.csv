,thidges,2013-02-27T04:50Z,"Hi by mistake I pushed ""authorizelive828.auz"" towards the end while going through the patch1 then special then all the adds and should have stopped at life8.2. Now when I go back to select life app, in my application for life there is no Patch anymore just this authorizelive828.auz whitch looks blank. I deleted everything even loaded the torrent again but same thing keeps happening so can not finish. Please advise what to do cause for the rest all works like a charm. Thank you very much for the upload and video"
,AzamatK,2013-03-05T00:21Z,The icon of the patcher keeps bouncing for me.. I'm on mac os x 10.7.2
,chaostastic,2013-04-25T17:50Z,"@thidges, Use an app like free AppCleaner to get rid of everything Ableton.

Then repair permissions by typing in the Terminal: 

sudo diskutil repairPermissions /

restart the machine just to make sure nothing uninstalled is still running.

Then start over. Don't do the updates. 8.2.8 is very stable and functional."
,chaostastic,2013-04-25T17:52Z,"@AzamatK. I was on 10.7.4 when I used this one. There are no reason I know of that prevents an update to 10.7.4 in your case.

Also, is your user an admin? "

Update to 10.7.4,"
