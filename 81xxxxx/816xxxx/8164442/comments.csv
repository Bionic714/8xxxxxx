,jpmeyer038,2013-02-20T02:58Z,quality is really bad.

,Xcel271,2013-02-20T04:56Z,"Just kidding! Itunes tells me that it's 320, but it sounds like approx. 150. Great album, anyway."
,tarvdietts,2013-02-20T04:59Z,"Regarding quality, it really does lack the range and crispness of the quality right from the pitchfork stream.  You probably wouldn't notice if you didn't compare side by side...  I was going to throw this on my phone for now, but I don't think it would be doing the album justice.  Deleted!"
,noir.na,2013-02-20T11:42Z,"iTunes can tell you this is 320, but that doesn't mean anything if the original source was a lower bitrate. If Pitchfork was only streaming at 192 (I have no idea what their quality is), then you grab that audio and encode it at 320, iTunes will say 320, but in reality, the quality will be worse than whatever Pitchfork was using."
,GodspeedX,2013-02-22T06:18Z,"The quality compared to the web stream is really bad..  the range (especially the bass) is severely reduced.  I'm not sure what was used to rip this, but it wasn't done very well..  so much so that it ruins the greatness of this album, for me at least.

Thank you for the upload and the effort, though, teleekom.  I'm going to rip it myself in high quality instead =)  BUY THIS ALBUM WHEN IT COMES OUT!  It's worth your money!"
