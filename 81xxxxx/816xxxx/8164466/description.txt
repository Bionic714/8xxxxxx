NOTE: I suggest downloading VLC Media Player to watch this release.  You can download it here:

A few important and simple keyboard shortcuts for VLC are:

Double click: Fullscreen
Spacebar: Play/Pause
V key: Enable/Disable/Change Subtitles.
G/H key: Subtitle Delay (-50ms/+50ms per tap)
J/K key: Audio Delay (-50ms/+50ms per tap
B key: Change Audio Track

NOTE: English Subtitles (SDH) are on by default.  If you do not want them on, simply tap the V key in VLC or delete the Subtitles folder.

NOTE: These 45 minute episodes take four (4) hours each (@100% CPU) to encode using my out-dated Dual-Core Laptop (2.4GHz) w/ 4GB RAM.  It is the least you can do to say thanks for my days of work and wear and tear on my laptop.  It would be much appreciated. :)

NOTE: In case you are wondering about grain, it is like that in the source and the BluRay discs themselves.  The show was shot on 16mm film stock, which is the cause of the grain.  Google "grain the walking dead" for more info.

NOTE: Three 30 second samples are included for your viewing pleasure.

NOTE: I do not have constant Internet access, so this upload may take an ENTIRE WEEK.  PLEASE BE PATIENT!  Many times there may be no seeders, but be patient!
