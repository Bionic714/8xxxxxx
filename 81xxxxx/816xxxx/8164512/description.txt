Here is one of the best open world games for the xbox 360, Grand Theft Auto IV.

The game is already converted for Jtag/RGH so u can avoid fucking errors like "disc not authorized" "can't Read de disc"

It's really simple to play, just move all (obviously extracted) archives to your USB Flash Drive, and use XEX Menu 1.1, dash launch or FSD to launch default.xex file and play.

Enjoy, and if you need ANY help, comment.

Fucking good play to u.
