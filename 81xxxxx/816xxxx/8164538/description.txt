OK Gang this one is 3 times the size (6GB) due to the fact that two of the files were OTS Albums and contained over 900 Filipino Language Karaoke tracks between them.   I have clients over there, so hence these.   Often Filipino Karaoke do not mention the original artistes as they are all covers anyway of well known English Language songs, so the Artiste defaults to UNKNOWN.

But the 1600 plus track contain of course the next chunk in the mega collection so download away and you can always move or delete what you dont' want in your collection later.  Bandwidth and Disc Space are so cheap now, you may even consider keeping the whole lot... You just never know when a customer may ask for Filipino Language Karaoke right?

MP3+CDG Karaoke Songs, over 1600 in a single RAR Archive.
Also included text files of the tracks and a guide to good torrents.
