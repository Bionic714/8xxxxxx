,Music_Is_My_Life,2013-02-20T01:47Z,"Ah, for fuck sakes! We're all stuck at 22.7

This torrent didn't do much at all -_-"
,notsogentle,2013-02-20T02:19Z,"stuck at 22.7 sounds like fake seeders. damn, actually got my hopes up"
,notsogentle,2013-02-20T02:22Z,fake seeders

,sharaz_ali,2013-02-20T02:56Z,i am stuck on 22%...
,Music_Is_My_Life,2013-02-20T03:01Z,"I don't think this has fake seeders. People still seed when they're downloading, or at least trying to download it, and that's why it says it has many seeders, only problem is that the uploader isn't seeding and is making us have to wait even longer for an english cam version."
,notsogentle,2013-02-20T04:19Z,no a SEEDer is a person sharing that has the entire file. A PEER still shares the part they have but they don't have the whole thing yet... and people who take more than they share are known as LEECHers lol
,Kurius_,2013-02-20T09:35Z,"@notsogentle - that's correct but im seeing that im connected to 4/13 seeders in my client, but the peer list shows everyone stuck at 22.9%"
,saint84,2013-02-20T11:01Z,"this torrent is dead. plus if you look at his upload , not very promising , especially for a new release. 
all you spamers from eastern europe who are 10 years behind . go fuck yourself . we will not go to your stupid link hd . really!!!!!"
,Kurius_,2013-02-20T11:29Z,"File is named Szklana pulapka 5.avi

Google translate says its polish and means ""Glass Trap"" Wtf is that? But yeah this torrent is dead"
,saint84,2013-02-20T13:43Z,remove this shit from piratebay
,lanebob13,2013-02-20T13:50Z,dead link delete it please
,rrcondr,2013-02-20T14:16Z,Most fake seeders are bots planted by the MPAA not the uploaders fault. You can't expect them to stay on 24 hrs just to help you
,saint84,2013-02-20T19:44Z,donoregy. you are an idiot and liar . you really must think we are morons here on piratebay. shows you are a retard . 
,saint84,2013-02-21T13:39Z,blazere . you are a liar .
,dubaz_PL,2013-03-11T23:49Z,"""Szklana pułapka"" stands for Die Hard in Polish. It's just f*cked up translation - it's quite impossible to translate it properly to Polish language.
