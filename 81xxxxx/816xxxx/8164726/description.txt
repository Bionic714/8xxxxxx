Game Notes:

RPG Dungeon Gate is different. You can not
equip your character. You must drain the DNA
of creatures to use their equipment, power or
capacity.

Why do you shapeshift? Because it will take
you deep in the game. You're too weak to fight
or you want infiltrate an enemy camp, drain
the DNA of one of them and you turn them.
Beings too tall to access a passage, drain the
DNA of a small creature to pass. You must
transform into different creatures  through
the adventure. You can drain the DNA of all
living things in the game, even dungeon
bosses.

Open World, you can walk as you want in a
large valley, visiting several houses and
villages. You will pass through five dungeons
in the game dungeons with five different
environments and different gameplay.
