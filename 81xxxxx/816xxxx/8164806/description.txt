For though we live in the world, we do not wage war as the world does. The 
weapons we fight with are not the weapons of the world. On the contrary, they 
have divine power to demolish strongholds. We demolish arguments and every 
pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God, and we take captive 
every thought to make it obedient to Christ.

By using our spiritual authority we can demolish SatanΓÇÖs inserted thoughts and 
place our minds in obedience to Christ. This is the victory that Jesus has already 
won for you.

Remember, God wants you to be Emotionally Free.
