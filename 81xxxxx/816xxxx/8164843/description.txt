Walter Trout has always been a blues man with rock & roll on his mind first and foremost. Though showy and loud, Trout keeps on the path of least resistance for an audience that wonders what Stevie Ray Vaughan, Luther Allison, Albert Collins, or Jimi Hendrix would sound like were they still alive. Still, Trout has carved out a career and a living playing music that definitely gets people out of their seats and raving for more. This collection - correctly subtitled Twenty Years of Hardcore Blues - has Trout picking favorites from various live performances recorded over the years by the BBC and, as he puts it, were selected favoring performance over recording quality. It should be pointed out that there's absolutely nothing wrong with the sound quality of these select dates and songs, and there are a couple of studio tracks thrown in, adding to the special nature of this disc, for both fans and novices.
