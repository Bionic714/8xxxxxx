  The second album from Bad Books - an act featuring songwriters Kevin Devine and Andy Hull, along with members of Hull's Manchester Orchestra - was recorded at roughly the same quick pace as 2010's self-titled debut. Knocked out in just over a week, II features another round of easy-flowing material that draws from power pop and folk. While Devine and Hull wrote the debut's songs separately, II is rooted in the duo's collaborations, and harmonies are more prominent and developed.
