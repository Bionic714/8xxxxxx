Retro Gamer eMag Load 03

Retro Gamer is a british magazine devoted to retro videogame world.

From time to time the publisher gathers several of its past issues and places them on pdf format in a nicely crafted DVD, with flashy shockwave menus, a useful search engine and different indexes to browse sections and articles more confortably. Don't worry though, you can bypass the menu entirely, and open the pdf files directly.

This upload in particular is Retro Gamer eMag Load 03, which contains issues 56 to 80.
