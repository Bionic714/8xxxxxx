It's some kind of bitcoin accumulator that overloads your GPU - I started getting constant GPU driver kernel issues (It also created a folder under c:temporary with the exact timestamp when I installed Highborn.)

Be warned. You have to use msconfig to disable the iehighutil.exe program from restarting at startup, but after doing that and killing the process, I was free of the kernel problems again."
