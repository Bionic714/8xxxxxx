This witty, wacky, turn-based strategy game is now available for Steam. In
Highborn, you're treated to a strategy game that  offers  an  intelligent,
tactical experience without the frenetic play of a traditional  RTS.  Move
your forces around an overhead map to secure spells  and  combat  support,
then dive into combat to deploy those advantages against  an  unsuspecting
enemy. All the fun and fighting is set against an irreverent tale,  filled
with  wacky  heroes,    witty    dialogue    and    wild    assumptions

Features:

A New Strategy: A unique blend of strategic movement and combat caters
to a variety of gameplay styles and offers lots of replayability
Many Styles of Play: Unlock hero characters for access to different
abilities, play styles, and strategies
Achieve Greatness: More than 20 achievements to unlock, including
judicious use of turns, using units as bait, and making it through an
entire mission without capturing support structures
