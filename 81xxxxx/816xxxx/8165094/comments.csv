FLAC is the best!"
,chunkymunky9000,2013-02-20T01:11Z,"@politux Loseless Audio Checker (a freeware program) reports a cutoff for these files, so I'm not sure if they're geniune FLAC. Still, they sound good to me! Maybe someone else who knows more about audio than I do can comment"
[V],politux,2013-02-20T06:18Z,If its not real flac you should have this deleted.
,chunkymunky9000,2013-02-20T08:13Z,"@politux I'm not sure one way or another. How can one tell for sure? In any case, I couldn't find Opus 131 in any other format beside this here, not even in mp3. "
,chunkymunky9000,2013-02-20T08:38Z,"@politux Based on this forum post, it seems like the Loseless Audio Checker utility is capable of producing false positives (i.e. it sometimes claims that a file is lossy when it in fact is lossless): http://forums.bakabt.me/index.php?topic=24975.0 Or, perhaps, the original CD of the Alan Berg Quartet recordings contained lossy audio. Since, for all I know, these audio files are genuinely lossless, I won't delete this torrent just yet. And, like I said, I'm not aware of any free online source from which to download Beethoven's Opus 131 in any higher audio quality than this torrent"
[V],politux,2013-02-20T22:04Z,"Checked the files with Audacity, spikes hit 22k meaning it is legitimate FLAC. :)"
,chunkymunky9000,2013-02-23T10:20Z,The official FLACTester also confirms that this is legit FLAC! :)
