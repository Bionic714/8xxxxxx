,shabbamanuk,2013-02-20T04:27Z,american commentary.
,priyatanuroy,2013-02-20T06:41Z,Video quality is very very poor with lots of stuttering. Better to download other torrents.
,IAMH67,2013-02-20T07:30Z,"@priyatanuroy 

Use MPC or VLC, video quality is fine."
,TPB_KUMAR,2013-02-20T09:33Z,Brilliant upload as usual from iamh67. Best uploader for football torrent. Low in size and great in quality.
,TPB_KUMAR,2013-02-20T14:58Z,Follow up of the last comment. Some slight hick ups in the file each ten mins.But the quality is still not bad for 800mb
,drew1972,2013-02-20T15:46Z,Thank you IAMH67!  Are you going to upload the Porto/Malaga match?
,IAMH67,2013-02-20T16:01Z,"You are welcome. I just checked and the video does miss a couple of frames every 10 minutes for a couple of seconds but that is happening so the audio and video are synced or else the audio would not be at the correct time of the video. 

Uploaded this 1 hour after the match so couldn't check but it doesn't really effect the quality."

,drew1972,2013-02-20T18:44Z,"Thanks IAMH67 for the info.  I was hoping for an English language version, but beggars can't be choosers, right?  I appreciate your efforts greatly."
[T],dylanlutchman,2013-02-23T19:24Z,manchester utd vs QPR anytime soon??
,Morpheus009,2013-02-24T00:23Z,"Why is it in 60 FPS? Clearly not designed for 60 FPS, makes it really choppy."
,bhayaji007,2013-02-25T17:20Z,"thnx for upload
