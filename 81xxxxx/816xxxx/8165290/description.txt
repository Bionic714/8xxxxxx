Found on some Finnish site, they had an extra track, idk where it's from but the rest seems legit so here you go. Said deluxe edition but basically just has Oxygen and Mecha Love with this new? song Vessel.
Pls support artist, I have the cd preordered but couldn't wait any longer after the delay. 
comment on quality so others know its legit

Track List:
The Vortex
Levitate
Bliss Out
As One
Parasite
Bad Signal
Stop Time
Spill Your Guts
The Comedown
Daylight
Vessel    -    no idea where this track came from, not on Itunes listing
Mecha Love
Oxygen

you can also google the album and find the site I dled it from, but I always find TPB easier to access
