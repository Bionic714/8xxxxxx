The radical geographer guides us through the classic text of political economy.
ΓÇ£My aim is to get you to read a book by Karl Marx called Capital, Volume 1, and to read it on MarxΓÇÖs own termsΓÇªΓÇ¥

The biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression has generated a surge of interest in MarxΓÇÖs work in the effort to understand the origins of our current predicament. For nearly forty years, David Harvey has written and lectured on Capital, becoming one of the worldΓÇÖs most foremost Marx scholars.

Based on his recent lectures, this current volume aims to bring this depth of learning to a broader audience, guiding first-time readers through a fascinating and deeply rewarding text. A Companion to MarxΓÇÖs Capital offers fresh, original and sometimes critical interpretations of a book that changed the course of history and, as Harvey intimates, may do so again.
