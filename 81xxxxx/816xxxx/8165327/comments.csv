,keeganzo,2013-02-20T03:45Z,"Dear Mr2Wingz - enjoy ur holiday. I'm sorry to hear this is a chore to you...I've always wondered what the driving force was behind the uploaders since I've never uploaded anything due to such a limited bandwidth. Anyhow, whatever you upload whenever is truly appreciated by your core followers."
