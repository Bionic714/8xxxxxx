,phase700b,2013-02-20T02:26Z,Right on! Thanks HighCode. Is that first one the remastered release?
[V],HighCode,2013-02-20T03:44Z,"@phase700b
No.
For The Terminator (1984)  Remastered will have to wait 2 weeks or a  month or so, but I doubt it will be that noticeable the difference in quality for most of us using monitors not bigger then 42""."
,phase700b,2013-02-20T04:08Z,Yeah you're right. I'll check it out when one shows up though. We have a crazy huge monitor.

Thanks dude.

can you do The Mummy Trilogy please.."
[V],HighCode,2013-02-20T08:28Z,"@phase700b I envy you for your 80"" monitor :-) 
@rakich The Mummies shall be soon. I luv them.

Wow, I'm very disappointed that I didn't wait for the ""The Terminator (1984) Remastered"" ;-(
The screens below clearly shows that ...
-from Blu-ray.com-
""...offers a noticeable improvement over its 2006 predecessor. Detail, contrast and black levels are superior, providing an overall improvement in clarity and a greater sense of depth to the image. In part due to the increase in contrast, the colours are stronger...""

I'm waiting forward for the Remastered version and I'll re-upload the pack again. Till then you guys may want to skip this one from download and wait till the remastered arrives.
Weird though that the remastered has a couple of pixels missing from top and right.

,Chartsandgrafs,2013-02-20T10:10Z,"Which ending does the Terminator 2 in this package have?  Is it the good ending, or the really stupid ending?  I'm guessing the ""extended"" part in the description means it has the bad ending.  

Say it ain't so."
,karimbaraka,2013-02-20T15:22Z,Thanks and will wait :)
,phase700b,2013-02-20T15:34Z,The other 3 sure are keepers though. They look great!
