Episodes 0-42 of Ross Scott's popular machinima, Freeman's Mind.

This only includes the episodes that have been given download links on Accursed Farms, partially to avoid legal conflict, and partially to keep the number of different file formats in the torrent to a minimum.

Episodes 0-38 are in WMV format, the rest are MKV. Some of the earlier episodes are not in widescreen, but that was just how they were recorded by the author.

This is THE semi-official torrent of these videos! Enjoy, and please seed for as long as you can, or until there is newer official/semi-official torrent. Please don't leech and run.
