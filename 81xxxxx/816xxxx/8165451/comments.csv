thanx again :)"
[V],RubrumPopulus,2013-02-25T12:20Z,"Peter & Max is Willingham's prose novel.  That isn't a comic book...  It is a good read though, so I recommend it.  But it's a prose novel.
I don't have a good set of Jack of Fables.  I didn't really care for the series myself.  And I have no clue what Fables 18b is...."
