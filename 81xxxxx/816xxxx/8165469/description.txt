Soraya, born in Brooklyn in a working class community of Palestinian refugees, discovers that her grandfather's savings were frozen in a bank account in Jaffa when he was exiled in 1948. Stubborn, passionate and determined to reclaim what is hers, she fulfills her life-long dream of returning to Palestine. Once there, slowly she is taken apart by the reality around her and she is forced to confront her own anger. She meets Emad, a young Palestinian whose ambition, contrary to hers, is to leave forever.
Tired of the constraints that dictate their lives, they know in order to be free, they must take things into their own hands, even if it's illegal.
