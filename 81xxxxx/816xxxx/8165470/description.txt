This version of Titanic is a fan-edit.  The running time is 157 minutes with no credits.  It is dubbed "the 1912 cut" because all of the modern day scenes have been removed.  The modern day narration is replaced with music.  There are a bunch of other cuts, notably the gun-chase and the trapped-behind-gate scene that follows the gun-chase, as well some of the exchanges between Lovejoy and Cal.  There are other minor cuts throughout the movie.  Apologies for the .wmv format and possibly low-audio.  

The following deleted scenes have been added: 

-The Radio Room/The Californian
-Boat 6
-Guggenheim/Astor
-Cal sees dogs running
-Rescuing Chinese man
-Boarding Carpathia
