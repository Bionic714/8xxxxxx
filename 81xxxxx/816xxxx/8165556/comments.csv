And so easy with 1 click on EZ-Activator
THANKS"
,Red.,2013-02-23T06:29Z,is this activator activate forever for microsoft office 2013? or just 6 months like KMSnano?
,marielisa,2013-02-23T09:22Z,how to use this toolkit? when do I need to run this? after or before I install mic office? (i'm new in installing softwares like this)
,WDoubleYouW,2013-02-23T13:03Z,"@Red.
Autorearm leaves you in grace period forever and AutoKMS leaves you KMS activated forever. If you manage to get a working key, Phone activation will give you a perfectly clean activation forever. This works on Office 2013, but make sure you use a Volume edition.

@marielisa
1. Download and install Office (make sure it is a volume edition like https://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7963896)
2. Run Microsoft Toolkit
3. Select the Office icon to enter the Office Toolkit
4. Go to Activation tab
5. Click EZ-Activator
6. Verify that Office is activated under File - Account"
,Red.,2013-02-24T05:51Z,@WDoubleYouW so this will active forever just for volume edition?
,WDoubleYouW,2013-02-24T07:20Z,"@Red.
I'm not certain. I've just heard that people have had trouble with retail, and since there really isn't a benefit of having retail over volume, just stick with the volume edition. Autorearm should work for retail perfectly I think, but most people prefer to see the beautiful ""product activated"" thing on their Account page. Read the thread from the toolkit's authors for the best information."

,WDoubleYouW,2013-03-06T08:10Z,"@ritaritaaa
If it is retail, it will say this:

Description: Office 15, RETAIL(Grace) channel"
[T],acer47x,2013-03-06T20:30Z,Worked for me.
,KSAC,2013-03-07T09:34Z,"Used for Office 2013 on Win7 x64

,missy29,2013-03-07T19:20Z,"When I used the activator, I received the following message:

Attempting To Activate Microsoft Office
Attempting to Activate OfficeProPlusVL_MAK
ERROR CODE: 0xC004C020
ERROR TEXT: The activation server reported that the Multiple Activation Key has exceeded its limit.


Anyone have any ideas?"
,deons227,2013-03-08T07:47Z,"Hi guys
The following happened with me:
It activated perfectly, but after I shut down the system it was not activated anymore and when I tried to run it again it just said "" no product Keys detected"" and nothing more. I uninstalled everyting and did everything over and exactly the same happened. Please Help!!!???"
,vikrant47,2013-03-08T13:15Z,"can anyone tell the difference between RETAIL, VOLUME, SELECT AND PROFESSIONAL EDITIONS. 
i have ""Office Select Edition 2013 15.0.4420.1017 VL"" . 
which edition is the best??"
,deons227,2013-03-08T14:28Z,"As I understand it they are all basically the same, just the licensing that differs"
,Lav7Aryan,2013-03-10T08:30Z,"Well, I was reading your instructions and it says you need Office 2010 to support Office Toolkit.
I have Windows 7 Ultimate and Microsoft .NET Framework's required version installed but I don't have Office 2010. Will this activator work for me?"
,fdamaral,2013-03-10T10:00Z,"Worked fast and perfectly, at least for now! Much better than the other one that ""came"" with my pirate version of Office 2013 that I downloaded a while ago!"
,WDoubleYouW,2013-03-10T21:04Z,"@Lav7Aryan
Office 2010 is not required. It is simply supported, meaning you can use it to activate Office 2010. This will activate Windows Vista, 7, or 8 as well as Office 2010 or 2013."
,anni1994,2013-03-11T15:07Z,thanks a lot it works perfectly for office 2013 plus and virus clean
,eldestructor,2013-03-11T21:20Z,Has an error saying: Could not activate because de the product does not support KMS activation...

Earlier version i used for off 2010. This is fantastic with off 2013.
However failed with Win 7 sp1,where i had to use Daz loader, as always .

kms ones failed with off 2013 repeatedly."
,lookmann,2013-03-26T16:55Z,"@www, 
why the downloaded file shows version no as 2.4.0?"
,WDoubleYouW,2013-03-26T22:09Z,"@lookmann
Perhaps you downloaded a different torrent? Because the screenshot you see is one I took of this very program, and it very clearly is 2.4.1."
,lookmann,2013-03-27T15:54Z,"@www,

you're right. 
culprit is windows explorer which shows it as 2.4.0.
 As you answered, the prog., window shows 2.4.1.
Thanks for clarifiying."

,alallaallalaalllaa,2013-04-20T03:13Z,"Hi guys,

This toolkit didn't work for me (I got some sort of licensing error when I tried)

I disconnected my internet when installing Office as well as using the toolkit, and it works fine.

Just a small tip. If nothing works for you, do what I did."
,alallaallalaalllaa,2013-04-21T05:11Z,"Nevermind, doesn't work. Worked for a day.

When I open one of the programs (Word, for example) it opens a configuration. If I close the configuration, it closes Word, and if I let the configuration finish it says that the key is invalid. Then the toolkit gives an error when I try to activate it again.

If anyone knows why, please let me know, thanks."
