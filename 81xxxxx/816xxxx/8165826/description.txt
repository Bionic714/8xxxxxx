CCD/IMG/SUB Files


Here's what you do to play or burn these files.

1-Download MagicISO online.
2-After setting up the program, go to Tools&gt;Virtual CD/DVD-ROM&gt;E:No Media&gt;Mount
3-Select the file to mount(it will either be the ISO file, Img file or Bin file, depending on the game)
4-Open virtual drive and double click on image file
5-Setup and install game as you normally would

To burn:

1-Insert a blank CD/DVD disc
2-Run MagicISO
3-Click Tools&gt;Burn CD/DVD with ISO
4-Select image file under the CD/DVD Image file section (NOW this is important-if you have a Cue/Bin file you always burn the Cue file, just make sure that the Cue and Bin are in the same folder. With CCD/Img/Sub files, you always burn the CCD file, just make sure the CCD/Img and Bin are in the same folder as you burn. With an ISO file you just burn the ISO).
5-Click the Burn It! button.
