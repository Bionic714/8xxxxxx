Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site :: On the Tuesday, February 19 broadcast of the Alex Jones Show, Alex will confront World Wrestling Entertainment's attempt to demonize Tea Party Americans and himself with their revamp of the Jack Swagger character as a xenophobic, Constitution-loving racist. 

Alex will also discuss the City of Los Angeles' efforts to extort money from Infowars, accusing us for "illegally posted signs" despite the signs having no affiliation with our company and despite the fact that Infowars primarily operates out of Austin, Texas. 

Alex also welcomes investigative journalist and author Wayne Madsen to analyze the mysterious murder-suicide of "conspiracy theorist" author Phillip Marshall.

Not mentioned in the official show description, Max Keiser is Alex's guest for most of hour 3.
