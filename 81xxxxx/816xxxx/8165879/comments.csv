,folknation10,2013-02-20T05:58Z,"Thanks for the awesome quality. These 60FPS rips are amazing for UFC. Is there any way you could upload a 60FPS version of UFC on Fuel TV 7 from last week. The prelims were streamed through FB, so I'm assuming you wouldn't be able to help at all with that, but the main card would be greatly appreciated. Thanks again Sec"

A - 8  My wi-fi BluRay player couldn't play the audio format, but it sounded good, otherwise."
