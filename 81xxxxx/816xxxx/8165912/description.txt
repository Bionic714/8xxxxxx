Ryan's prideful indignation over having to read a live commercial for a male enhancement product causes him to stage a walkout, only to be replaced by Terrell Owens whom he just hired as a temporary assistant. Lauren obsesses over a single low group evaluation score and solicits help from George (Bill Cobbs) to find out who gave her the poor rating. Meanwhile Simone (Piper Perabo) invites Ryan to a meditation center where he does everything but calm himself. And in group, it's Anne who helps put Ryan back on track with the truth.
