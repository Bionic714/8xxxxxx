,mibmib007,2013-02-20T05:46Z,could u maybe rip something in 60 fps and still save it in mp4? =) wanted to try something in twixtor with 60 fps but software wont accept the TS format
[V],SecTPB,2013-02-20T06:11Z,"@mibmib007
I've already told you, the extension can be changed to mp4. It's an MPEG file. If it still doesn't work then just encode the 60FPS version yourself to MPEG-4."
