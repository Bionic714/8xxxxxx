Thanks a ton for picking up the the new fiction and non fiction bestsellers."
,Bmack7263,2013-02-27T10:23Z,"1 grillion attaboys for uploading new fiction and best selling non-fiction. Ever since deonoid went down it has been slim pickens. lots of scams and low life rip offs.

by the way could all you lazy requesters get off your dead buts and make an effort to find your own books.

On top of which I would be ashamed  to admit  I was reading the trash you  ask  for. Go look in the nickel  bin at 7-11. or maybe setting next to the hole in the outdoor head you share with six of your camping buds under the overpass.

But for now, my deepest thanks to-WXM-
I will seed for at least a month.  Bmack"
