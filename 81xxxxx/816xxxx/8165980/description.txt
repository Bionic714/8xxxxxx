My Little Forest (2009)






Itai Argaman discovered his musical world as a young boy, writing his first orchestral composition at the early age of 15. Later on he was exposed to electronic soundscapes, and started developing his own unique signature sound. During this period of development Itai discovered the world of frequencies and sound engineering and took it one step further with his unique approach and vision.
Using these capabilities Itai creates new sonic dimensions; morphing, twisting and sculpting sounds into a complete musical journey. These days Itai is composing cinematic scores, producing, engineering and designing sound in his own studio. Itai's first Album -- 'My Little Forest' was released in 2009, reaching an ever-growing worldwide audience, exposing them to his art and passion.
His message of an artistic world without boundaries has begun to seep into the fabric of our existence.
