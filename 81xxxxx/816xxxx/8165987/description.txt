El Último Malón it is one of the early Argentinean silent films that has survived until today. It was the only film that was directed by Herr Alcides Greca, a man with many cultural interests as a journalist and writer and with other more useful interests as a lawyer and politician. The movie dramatizes the last Indian uprising in Argentina, which happened in the north of the country, in the Chaco region, in the early 1900s. They were easily defeated by the Argentine troops. But what's interesting is certain dramatic devices not seen in cinema until decades later. For example, the very first scene shows the writer director writing the script of the movie. Then he is congratulated by an official of the province where the action took place for dramatizing these events. After that, the action takes place very much in the form of a southern (that is, a western set in South America).
