"Abducted Pt I"

Megan returns to work months after 
Peter's death, and she is surprised by 
a man from her past-Tommy Sullivan 
(Mark Valley, "Fringe"), the new 
detective assigned to her case. Megan, 
along with Tommy and his rookie 
partner, Adam Schaeffer (Elyes Gabel, 
"Game of Thrones"), must stop a serial 
killer whose victims are young war 
veterans. As she learns more about the 
crime, the stakes rise when she gets a 
call from the killer -- who is holding 
her teenage daughter, Lacey, hostage.
