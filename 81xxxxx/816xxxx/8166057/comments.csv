,Monsterica,2013-02-20T09:47Z,"2 grade ? Too bad for the actor, i was expecting more from Val Kilmer. "
,crumrugin,2013-02-20T21:38Z,"Thats a 3 grade not 2
 Val hasn't been in a good movie since he came out of the closet"

,dfl3506,2013-02-23T03:15Z,Mosterica. Why would you expect better from Val Kilmer? Name me on decent movie he's appeared in since Heat. He's a fat has-been.

,saddamlevine,2013-02-24T15:24Z,A mysterious town. A deadly secret: Val Kilmer is a fat fag
,starlite2,2013-02-24T16:49Z,"@dfl3506  Since Heat (1995)? Well, lessseeee... there's ... The Saint (1997); Red Planet (2000); The Salton Sea (2002); Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005); Deja Vu (2006). I don't think too shabby... by the way, have you ever done *anything* worthwhile in your life? Your trolling doesn't count because you're terrible at it, but I guess that's what one might expect from a ""never was"" like yourself."
,dfl3506,2013-02-24T21:39Z,starlite2 Have I done anything worthwhile in my life? Does getting a reaction out of you count?  Sorry didn't know you were a Kilmer fanboy.  
,starlite2,2013-02-24T23:33Z,"dfl3506 uh, no, I already stated it does not because your trolling just isn't up to snuff. Comprehension... get some."
,dfl3506,2013-02-25T02:06Z,startlite2 I'm a troll and yet you have this need to keep responding. What does that make you? Besides an arsewipe that is.
,starlite2,2013-02-25T04:09Z,"dfl3506 wrong again, drongo! You are an unimaginative, weak and pathetic excuse for a troll. I, otoh, am an exceptional troll. Observe as I manipulate you effortlessly with my superior intelligence, skill and experience, compelling you to reply again and again with flat, boring quasi-insults. "
,TheobaldDancelot,2013-02-25T04:19Z,"Thanks uploader..not a bad film..definitely not as bad as the bitches above me make out.

Applause to user Starlite2 for having the balls to state an opinion outside of the norm, answering a question, then getting ridiculed for answering said question.

dfl3506 you're clearly a troll & a sad bitter individual, you would be wiser to stop commenting and go watch silver linings playbook instead..its right up your street"
,dfl3506,2013-02-25T07:56Z,TheobaldDancelatot and starlite2 the fact that you both like this movie says it all. Do you both have the entire Steven Segal DVD collection as well?
,weemikey,2013-02-27T00:37Z,"theobolddancelot and starlite2 (the names alone tell us everything!) should get together for reach-arounds (if they haven't already!), and, in those quiet moments after, maybe peruse some of their seagull/kilmer combos... "
,jd11,2013-03-08T01:58Z,@dfl3506 you should learn to shut the cockhole in the middle of your face . you are an inept and inbred piece of crap who probably also resides in a trailer park wow what a looser  
,ajrf,2013-03-19T10:23Z,tx very good
,epicfrog,2013-03-21T07:41Z,"loads of gaybashing in this thread. it's 2013 people, get it anyway you can, you won't be getting any bickering about a movie"
,k4zuya,2013-04-07T05:28Z,"ok, so im not a kilmer fanboy but i can come up with one movie that nobody can say was shit. And val kilmer was amazing and that my friends was doc holiday in tombstone. Val kilmer was also good in the island of dr mureau. Unfortunatley, he gained some weight and isn't  in any good movies and hasnt for a while. He was a great actor in his prime though and i'll give this movie a chance. "
,k4zuya,2013-04-07T05:46Z,"Ok, so im not a kilmer fanboy or wuteva u call it. Kilmer played in Tombstone as Doc Holiday and i personally think it was his best performance and an amazing one at that. He was also good in the island of dr mureau. Yes, unfortunately he has gained weight and has been given shit roles. However, I do like kilmer and i'll give this movie a shot, probably shit but wtf... "
,k4zuya,2013-04-07T21:31Z,"not the greatest piece of artwork but definately worth a watch. good movie
