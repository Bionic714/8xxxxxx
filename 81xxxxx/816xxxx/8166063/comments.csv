A question, though:  Why do you insist upon UL in compressed form?  It's a little bit harder on DLers, because we have to keep the .rars to keep the torrent going well, but it doesn't save you much time, either, does it?  The videos are fairly well compressed already, aren't they, and how many seconds do you save, after all?  I'd love to understand the reasons for your actions."
