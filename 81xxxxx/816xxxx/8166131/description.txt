Thirteen Tales of Terror 


Psychological horror in the vein of The Twilight Zone and Tales from the Crypt!  In this first "Definitive" Collection of stories from the acclaimed online comic series, we delve into a world of ghostly lovers, demonic abductors, vengeful victims, and sexy Cthulhu priestesses as these loosely connected stories weave an epic tale of a world not unlike our own where nothing is what it seems.  Welcome to Nightmare World!  Written by "Write Or Wrong" Newsarama columnist Dirk Manning, featuring remastered art, extras, and a new in-continuity prose story.
