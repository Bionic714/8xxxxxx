Annette Peacock, the avant garde American composer, collaborator with Salvador Dalí, friend of Albert Ayler and Moog-synth pioneer, brought this seismically influential session out in 1972 – its synth-warped banshee vocals, morphed jazz ballads, Motown grooving and squelchy electronics were to touch many jazz and pop artists in that decade, most David Bowie and Mick Ronson. Early on, Peacock's spacey, harmonically drifting pieces were regularly interpreted by her second husband, the jazz pianist Paul Bley – but she's since been covered by everyone from Busta Rhymes to Pat Metheny and Marilyn Crispell. Peacock has finally reacquired I'm The One's rights from Sony-BMG, and reissued this long-unavailable classic. And for all the familiarity of computer-assisted vocals now, nothing prepares you for the howl of her searingly high notes spiralling up out of spooky organ chords and soul-brass riffs on the title track, or against the rolling blues groove of Pony, or the dark and prowling one of Blood. Elvis's Love Me Tender is the only cover, a blend of soft, lyrical intimacy and fierce exhortation. The underpinnings are as 1970s soul/blues-rooted as any classic-pop listener could wish, but the uncompromising, sound-manipulating focus still sounds contemporary.
