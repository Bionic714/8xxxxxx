Seriously it makes little to no diffrence in file size. Your pusshing out a 15 gig file as a fucking RAR! 

The one reason you don't use rars in torrents is because what if you want to download one epsode at a time or get the first one done. 

fuck... Why can't anyone get Kids in the hall right on torrents. 

Ipod sizes now this... FUCK THIS SHIT I guess I have to buy the fucking disks"
