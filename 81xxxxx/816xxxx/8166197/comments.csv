,ScarletteSpider,2013-02-21T05:53Z,"face off has a new spin off show called ""Redemption"" where the contestants that get eliminated have a chance to compete for a spot to get back on to Face Off. 
Pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeze start uploading this show episodes as well. Perhaps as a 2 for 1 included in the Face Off episodes files?"
,jl1983,2013-02-21T06:37Z,"ScarletteSpider: Face off Redemption is a new webseries that is still airing on SYFY.com, they haven't even premiered the second episode yet. Dumbass much?"
,blah257,2013-02-21T23:23Z,"Ugh! If there was ever a show that needed a 720p release and that people would actually
download/seed, this is IT! I guess since Comcast is blowing balls and hasn't updated On Demand all
week, I am stuck watching a Make Up competition that is all about the DETAILS in this crappy low
quality. Fml. "

Looks like you might have been in a bit of a rush to upload it and you forgot to remove all of the commercials. 18:50 made me hungry for Chili's...See ya later. Going to get some Big Mouth Burger Bites"
