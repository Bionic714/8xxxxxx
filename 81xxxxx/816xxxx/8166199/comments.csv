,enonumus,2013-04-09T01:39Z,"@Yxhultarn  Takes two minutes to permanently fix an audio sync issue using MKV Merge or Yamb, or 2 seconds to fix it temporarily if you watch the movie with the VLC player.  Probably took you longer than that to get back on here and post that the audio was out of sync.   "
