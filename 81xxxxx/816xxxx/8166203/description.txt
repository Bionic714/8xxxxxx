				
What Really Happened 
- with Mike Rivero -

[sebaygo1]

Familiar show themes: US government warmongering, deceit and theft; the steady path to an ever more oppressive police state; wars and threats of wars being used to placate Israel and distract US citizens from economic disaster and the ticking debt time-bomb ...and there's much more.

Mike manages to present powerful, credible and persuasive analysis without the screaming and yelling that some hosts seem to require.
Please give his show a listen.
