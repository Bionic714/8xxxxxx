Be sure to check ""load out-of-date addons"" in the WoW client."
,Raikalo,2013-02-20T13:31Z,Also do not use the Zygor client....skip to the manual install (2nd section).

,GRUJFlux,2013-02-21T13:44Z,"Amazing work bud, Can't wait to see more of this you just saved me countless hours."
,Raikalo,2013-02-21T17:26Z,"The addons button will show up on your character selection screen. I'm not familiar with Macs, sorry, I can't stand having problems like that with things that work fine in windows."
