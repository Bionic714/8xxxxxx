The entire English Language Wikipedia (3.8 million articles) on your Android Phone!

Official Site: http://www.bitmagictech.com/
Google Play Link: https://play.google.com/store/apps/detai...line&hl=en

Kindy note: The developer has NOT updated the version on Google Play, hence kindly visit the official developers site for the latest versions with almost twice the database size and more articles.

It requires only and ONLY WiFi to download the database of 5.2 GB. I am from India and here WiFi is a very rare thing. I wish to use this offline encyclopedia, but unfortunately I cannot due to WiFi restrictions.

I use a Chrome extension called APK Downloader 1.4.0 and use it to download .apk files from my PC and then install it on my phone. This is because of Wifi and 3G restrictions (unavailability) in most parts of India.

Can someone kindly create an APK file along with the database that can be downloaded on PC and then installed on Phone? OR Provide the apk file and database separately so that it can be installed and then copy-paste the database in given folder?

This will really help those who are in a dilemma like me. Hoping for a positive reply.

Thank you very VERY much."

I click the playstore link you provided and it says:
''We're sorry, the requested URL was not found on this server.''

And on the site there is no app for andriod???"

Although the Google Play version is VERY outdated with 3.6GB database. The current version has a larger database of 5.2GB.

On the official site, kindly click on the ""Available at Amazon Apps"" image button.

I would really REALLY appreciate if you can kindly upload this. I'm in desperate need to have this app, as I only have internet at home and thus find it frustrating to not have info when I need it on the go.

Thank you very much.

Kind regards."
