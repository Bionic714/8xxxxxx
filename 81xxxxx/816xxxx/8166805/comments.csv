,Mr.Davis2013,2013-02-21T05:37Z,"Hey i was curious, what program do you usually use for ripping blurays?
thanks"
,beechyboy,2013-02-21T18:53Z,"Just so you know, this has HARD CORE subs in a foreign language(not English)"
,beechyboy,2013-02-21T19:13Z,"My mistake. 
When you play this on a media player or other device you can select which sub language you want or none at all. It has built-in multilanguage Hard core subs. I was playing it on my computer using VLC and Spanish subs were shown for some reason..."
,nuborn13,2013-02-21T22:59Z,"I hope you meant hard coded subtitles and not hard core subtitles ^^

Thanks for the upload! "
,Coldblackice,2013-02-22T01:36Z,^LOL. I was wondering the same thing
,beechyboy,2013-02-22T03:15Z,"Didn't notice that it was a mkv video that has Hard CODED subs in many languages.

Great quality video by the way...

Thanks"
,Kooblukhan,2013-02-22T04:34Z,hard coded means u cant change or remove them.  mkv just has buillt in subtitle options

Thanks once again aoloffline! Great rip. Cheers."
,killyourself,2013-02-23T22:46Z,"Scratch that.. the link to subs I just posted is a full English subtitle file. Psh, description on site is false. Anyone know of another? I don't want to have to watch the whole movie with subtitle when there's only a few foreign speaking parts. :("

,keithhall,2013-02-26T04:08Z,"@killyourself

still looking as well.  i completely agree that its annoying to see subtitles throughout the entire movie.  its usually tough to find a non-eng-only sub file out there.

please post em here if you come across any."
