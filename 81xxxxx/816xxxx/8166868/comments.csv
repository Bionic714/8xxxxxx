Is it possible that one of your upload port has changed or is closed again?  I'm at 0.0% on this after an hour.

The torrents you put up are the best, I appareciate your hard work! Thanks again!"
,friendly_donkey,2013-02-20T14:08Z,Same thing. I'm sure it'll be fixed soon enough.

Should be all good now."
