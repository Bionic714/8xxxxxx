Notes

2013 collection of remixed tracks from Bjork's critically-lauded 2011 album
Biophilia. Bastards includes some of the remixes released in an eight-part
series earlier this year, remastered for this album by Grammy-nominee Mandy
Parnell, and features collaborations with Current Value, Death Grips, Hudson
Mohawke, Alva Noto, Matthew Herbert, Omar Souleyman, 16-bit, These New
Puritans, and The Slips. Bjrk also worked with her sound engineer Curver
Thoroddsen to isolate a specific chapter of Matthew Herbert's Sacrifice
remix on the Pins & Needles' Mix found on the album
