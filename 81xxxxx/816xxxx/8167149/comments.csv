,UncleO,2013-04-16T04:47Z,"Errors? I haven't tried anywhere near all of the songs on 1-11, but very, very little was wrong. Except for me not being able to hear just when my vocal should kick in!

I'm 73 and just hoping I'll get to the end of these ULs before I do my own ending. lol.

I hope there's some Joe South songs in here, Games People Play being the most famous, I reckon. Walk in My Shoes (?)?"
