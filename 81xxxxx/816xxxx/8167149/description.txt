Well our North American Peers should be well pleased with the Country & Western Artistes in this batch and our friends in France as there is about 100 French Language tracks too all mixed in with the Classic British and Euro Pop tracks from the 50's 60's 70's 80' 90's and naughties.

I have to get this lot up before the end of this month, so the heat is on as we are not even close to being half way through yet.

MP3+CDG Karaoke Songs with the file-name and MP3 tags sorted to industry standards.
there are LESS than 1 Track in 100 errors or duplications in this collection so enjoy all my hard work, doing what the Karaoke producers can not be bothered to do... giving you digital copy that works right out of the Box on any computer and does NOT involve CD's or Karaoke playback devices.

Please feel free to re seed this on any other Bit torrent site you wish to use.  Let's all work hard to get rid of wrongly tagged Karaoke files once and for all!
