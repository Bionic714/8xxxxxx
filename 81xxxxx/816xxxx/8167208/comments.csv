,carl4442,2013-03-17T10:27Z,"I'm using the RG Revenants 1.03 version (http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8167208).  How do I get version 1.04 installed? I tried running AssassinsCreed3Updater1.04_DIGITAL.exe, but that fails (presumably because the multiplayer files were ripped)"
,weedfuck123,2013-03-17T15:04Z,"Ha carl4442, try this one
You may try like this:
1. Run the update exe, wait until the welcome info comes out.
2. Go to your TEMP folder (press win+r and type %TEMP%), find extracted patch files, which may inside the folder called {9D15E813-0C26-41E7-ABC5-3EB06FF1B3CF} or something like this.
3. Delete Disk1deltaFilesmulti
4. Switch to installation, press next to start."
