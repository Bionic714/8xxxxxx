,.h.264,2013-02-20T10:35Z,"S/O: KurraDog, Lightning23, Ed for the hacked build mod, the modders who made this shit and @bashpr0mpt from Twitter for being so badass he can hack squad with no internet access!


Boo: Squad for being a pack of children, you're never going to make make it as a company if you keep fucking your fan base over and keep letting pathetic kiddies run your social presence, hire a PR firm with the millions of dollars in cash you've made from selling a paid-alpha release you tight asses, they shamed you so fucking hardcore even I feel embarrassed for you. 

You don't punish your player base to try and discredit one voice in an ocean of people exposing that you're making millions of dollars out of GNU licensed code.

You don't go getting your fans to personal army a guy with ten times the social media following you have and harass them by taking your websites offline and screaming from the highest hill that you're being 'ATTACKED' by bashpr0mpt just because -WE- RELEASED A FUCKING TORRENT he wrote a foreword for. 

No offense intended to bash, I actually thought you'd accused our crew of 'attacking' you when I first heard of it because the mere concept of a guy who quite publicly was bawwing about having no net access for days from a phone connection (and is just a pro-gamer and reviewer) being behind an 'attack' was too dumb, so I figured you'd assumed--erroneously--we'd hacked your Gibson. 

But no, you actually went the whole fucking hog with complete lunacy and blamed someone who couldn't have even done it. Shame on you Squad. Fucking Shame. On. You.

that go into more detail about what Squad are up to, and why they're being called out more and more by the gaming community and why Anthony Keeton and James Kupperian need to be fired and the entire KSP 'moderation community' need to be replaced by a PR firm.)

ENJOY! And seed or don't seed, we've got a 200 mbit link pumping this stuff to ya from an unnamed university in Mexico courtesy of the KSP development team themselves! 

Oops, did we just let that tidbit slip that Squad have a mole? A mole who knows they're ripping off not-for-profit code for profit and rolling in dough while releasing more half ass stolen code updates and collecting checks with a vaporware game? A mole who's pissed that they're taking as much time per update as even small indie game dev's take to release ENTIRE GAMES and are in no hurry to give us a final product because Squad have already got your fucking money and don't care? I think we just did! Have fun finding your leak fuckers."
