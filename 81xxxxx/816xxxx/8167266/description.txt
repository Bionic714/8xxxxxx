I got these from various sites and will try to get remaining episodes with eng sub in future but for now got only 59 episodes.i cant understand language of raw so i completed watching series with live action drama(The return of condor heroes) as reference. In dailymotion another 2-3 episodes are in eng sub.


Condor hero has 3 seasons but only 1 season dubbed to japanese and later 2 seasons were chinese audio and 3rd season almost dont have eng subs.

Season 1 is Japanese audio with English sub.
Season 2 is Chinese audio with English sub.
Season 3 is all episodes are Chinese audio and few episodes only got English subs.

J=Japanese audio, English sub
C=Chinese audio,English sub
