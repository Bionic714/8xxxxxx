,chunkymunky9000,2013-02-21T05:05Z,"'Signs', a book by Merleau-Ponty published in 1960, is available for free in the original French thanks to Pierre Patenaude: http://classiques.uqac.ca/classiques/merleau_ponty_maurice/signes/merleau_ponty_signes.pdf In Canada, the book (in original French) has lapsed into the public domain since it has been 50 years since the death of the author.

I haven't yet been able to track down a copy of the English translation of 'Signs'. (There does appear to be a Spanish translation on Scribd though: http://www.scribd.com/doc/105628703/signos-merleau-ponty)

An essay by Merleau-Ponty, 'Cezanne's Doubt', is also available online: http://faculty.uml.edu/rinnis/cezannedoubt.pdf I regret not thinking to include it in this torrent
