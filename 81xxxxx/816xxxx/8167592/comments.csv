,Aman321,2013-02-21T07:06Z,Thank you bro
,stubbieaussi,2013-02-23T10:24Z,I have this on iPad and it's great. Thanks for this torrent so I can check the differences and see if it's worth getting for the pc.
,stubbieaussi,2013-02-23T11:32Z,Unfortunately this version desperately needs a patch. There are no tooltips except for the spells and absolutely no unit information like the iPad version has. Also the game only contains 8 missions from chapter one without the tutorial.

It's some kind of bitcoin accumulator that overloads your GPU - I started getting constant GPU driver kernel issues (It also created a folder under c:temporary with the exact timestamp when I installed Highborn.)

Be warned. You have to use msconfig to disable the iehighutil.exe program from restarting at startup, but after doing that and killing the process, I was free of the kernel problems again."

(Already posted this once on this particular torrent, but for some reason it's not showing up.)"
