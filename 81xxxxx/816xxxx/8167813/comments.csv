[V],psspss,2013-02-20T14:43Z,"

So NO one connecting to me.. so I guess no one wants this collection"

Thanks for all the shares mate!"
,frobknob,2013-02-20T15:46Z,Coast to Coast AM is a radio show. So why does this torrent contain video files? I'm a little puzzled as to what this actually is.
[V],psspss,2013-02-20T21:34Z,cos they are video versions of the radio show that sometimes shows pictures and faces of the people talking and will play on tv and pc with less boring
[V],psspss,2013-02-21T01:59Z,"I recommend listening to this one

Coast-to-CoastAM_29-Oct-2010_Art_Bell_GIS_EVP Research

if you use utorrent priority high on it you can get it first to complete however ive only listen to a couple of them the gis ones im sure all are pretty good to have a listen too.. some evps are very clear"
[V],psspss,2013-02-22T07:01Z,"im only seeing 2 people wanting this.. connected to me.. Ive tried various IPs to share from so I doubt
its being blocked?

anyhow I have a big collection of similat stuff on conspiracies to share soon.. maybe they wont want either LOL.. why do I bother "
[V],psspss,2013-02-23T09:57Z,"try disabling your block list and find out
which is my vpn ip.. seems many block my ips I use
anyhow will be slow until gold rush and and GA seeds out"
[V],psspss,2013-02-24T00:42Z,"these are great to listen too before bed or while you work.. as you dont need to watch and play in media player minimised :)

so creepy stuff..

I thought there was 1000s of paranormal stuff lovers and followers.. 

weird only 2 want it.. very SAD"
,fish_fingers,2013-02-24T05:31Z,So this has old Art Bell webcam videos? That's great content if that's so. I don't have a torrent app that will let me select specific torrent files with a magnet link in linux. and 6 gb would take me a week to download.
[V],psspss,2013-02-26T13:14Z,"no reg c2cam on paranormal topics with evps aireed with photos of art etc added to the mp3

i have finally seeded out 100 percent (well more then that) but 7 atleast got it finally

I see a couple joined on.. but they might not get it now since i suspect the seeders will vanish.. as well.. im eating up too much bandwidth now so cutting back"
