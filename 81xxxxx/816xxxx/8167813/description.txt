Coast-to-Coast vidRadioChats (2002-2013)-Ghosts&Paranormal  collection xvid avi

This is a massive collection ive compiled from the web for C2CAM programmes
to do with the paranormal and ghost subject

theres some great EVPs and chat.. I recommend first to listen to the
the one called EVP_research from GIS and then any with GIS in the titles
as they great value.. most have news clips in front just scroll past if
dont want to listen to the news and chat about it and get to the main programme


FINALLY my DATA cap has reset so now I can share this collection!
however I need help seeding it

please dont hit and run or connect and leave minutes or hours after joining
in.. as it slows down the whole seeding out process !

IT A BIG 6GIG collection its goign to take days to seed out
so only join in for the first few days if you can stay connected 24x7 !!!


Enjoy!! happy listening
