Amanda survived crazy at the hands of the psychopath, Lorre. But the Livers are a new kind of insanity that threatens to push her narrow grasp on reality into the embrace of schizophrenia. With an army of Rat Crossed out to slurp her insides through a straw and three certified lunatics fighting over her, the only sane choice seems to be a bullet in the head. Available with a Regular and Torture cover by Raulo Caceres, Wraparound cover by Gianluca Pagliarani, and a special Red Crossed Incentive also by Caceres.
