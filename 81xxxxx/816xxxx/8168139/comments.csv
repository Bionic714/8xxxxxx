,SweRaider,2013-02-20T15:20Z,Thank you so much! :) Been waiting for vol4 for a while :3
,indiaman,2013-02-21T16:28Z,"Thanks a million for ""Engg.Circuit Analysis Vol.4"" and also for your previous upload on ""Statistics Vol.1"".
Would you be kind enough to upload ""Mathtutordvd Chemistry Vol.3 & Vol.4"" and also by Mathtutordvd ""Amazing Science Vol.1"" and ""MATLAB Essential Skills""."
,MudShark,2013-02-24T17:44Z,"I think section 13 is broken, I tried downloading it again but it quits at 45 seconds.
I even tried running it through ffmpeg, hoping that would repair it, but it still ends at the same spot.
Does anyone else have this problem?"
,MudShark,2013-02-24T17:46Z,".... that would be Section 13 on Volume 4. 

"
,zeal0us,2013-02-25T00:19Z,"MudShark is right, Vol. 4 Section 13 seems to be broken at 45 seconds. Elcotan, could you kindly look into this?"
