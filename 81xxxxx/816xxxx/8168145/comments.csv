,Jman2919,2013-02-20T22:04Z,yeah ive tried everything suggested and it still tries to connect to ubisoft server which is unnavaible of course. I have all proper updates by reloaded and ive downloaded and installed the actual dlc. My saves are in C:Users/Mydocuments/assassins creed 3. I put the files in there and i tried it in all the other folders. any ideas on how i can get it to work?
,memo81,2013-02-20T22:09Z,"for Theta version first setup update 1.03 then rename 4.save to 1.save and replace and yes it unlocks all dlcs (bernold , the infamy , etc)"

,Haracina,2013-02-21T02:55Z,"i have a solution if u have a reloaded version use a theta crack, put the unlocker in theta folder 54 and will work im playing it right now "
,Haracina,2013-02-21T02:57Z,The DLC works only in Reloaded version because in other versions u cant update the game and u need update version 1.03 to install dlc 
,ckd1992,2013-02-21T04:14Z,Works Perfectly. I am using theta version. Thousand Thanks Gh0stNet :D
,RapMProductions,2013-02-21T10:49Z,"Before installing this dlc, I opened My theta version of ac3 and it automatically downloaded the 1.03 patch, same with the previous 1.02 patch, if it does not download a 1.03 patch then try reinstalling maybe?"
,memo81,2013-02-21T10:57Z,"for theta version use 1.03 russian update and u have to go to temp files while opening the update , search for the last created file i think its name is like (3453tvrgdfhgyut6ruvghcx) open it then open delta u will find multi files delete it as theta version doesnt have multi files then press next in the update "
,memo81,2013-02-21T10:59Z,theta version crack works for all updates as its only dll files 
,sahil.sun,2013-02-21T11:52Z,"Okay let me make this clear i am using RG mechaniks verrsion of assassin's creed 3 and it automatically installs 1.01 update. i cant update to 1.02 or 1.03 using reloaded cracks as it is of different version...:(
pleaseee someone give step by step instructions on how can i update to 1.03...:(
my version uses theta crack by default...:("
,memo81,2013-02-21T13:32Z,u can use the auto patch file it will download the proper update 
,ckd1992,2013-02-21T13:48Z,"@sahil.sun - let the game automatically update to latest version. Then apply Theta crack (you can find it easily, just google it, try on gamescopyworld). Finally copy theta unlocker into your save game folder.

Note: 1. as memo81 said theta crack can work on any version game, so dont worry about the version of the crack you download.

2. again as memo81 said rename "" 4.save "" to "" 1.save "" before copy it to your save game folder..

3. At last dont forget to backup your save game."
,sahil.sun,2013-02-21T14:03Z,it downloads the update but the error comes that cannot patch data.sumthing :(
,m_sameer,2013-02-21T15:55Z,"Hey guys.

Download Skidrow Update 1 and 2 and Install.Then you'll be able to install DLC .
I was using THETA too."
,youcifer,2013-02-21T16:48Z,"Dear Gh0stNet (or anyone who is familiar with these things), could you be a little more specific on how to edit the INI file? I know how to open it in Notepad etc, but I'm not quite sure how to merge or combine my own savegame into the unlocker. So far I've just backed up and replaced my original savegames to play the DLC, but I would like to understand the given file a bit better. Thanks in advance! :)"
,Zgembara,2013-02-21T17:28Z,"Does this work on Black Box version,and how to install it, plz help!"
,memo81,2013-02-21T18:54Z,"@sahil as i mentioned these problem in a comment the error is about multi files so u first open the update the choose i accept the terms i know the language in russian but u will figure it now dont press next while the update is opening , open temp files u will find it in user name - app data - local - temp, then open the last created file its name will be something like that {ac142160-45b3-4545-83b8-6382cada6170} then u will find delta files open it u will find multi delete that folder ther return to the update and press next u will have no problems"

,burnemdown,2013-03-13T12:53Z,"hey guys! i'm using a skidrow version of ac3, updated to 1.03, all working perfectly.. i downloaded and installed the dlc as explained here and copied over the savegame files, but i don't seem to get it working.. in the main game menu there is only an option to download the dlc.. and when i exclude my savegame files from the savegame folder (so there are only the unlocker files) there doesn't seem to be any save inside the game.. what did i do wrong? thanx for your help!"
,PlumBrendan69,2013-04-12T05:45Z,"Just wondering (im too lazy to check the comments) will this DLC work on the official version of the game, non pirated?"
