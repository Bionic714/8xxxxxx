,SCU-316,2013-02-23T10:26Z,Anyone confirm this torrent has Deluxe dlc's?
,MnemonicSyntax,2013-02-24T03:59Z,"It does have all the DLCs, but West Point (Benedict Arnold missions) do not currently work. You can start the mission, by talking to Washington, but after you physically try to go to West Point it remains on the loading screen over and over again."
,MnemonicSyntax,2013-02-24T04:02Z,"The other DLCs are present and do work, except Benedict Arnold. You can start it by talking to Washington, but once you go to West Point the game remains loading over and over again."

i tried to download it from your wesite but then  "

the tyranny of king washington the betrayal"
,spirit313,2013-03-22T20:31Z,"Thanks for the game, but you could've made it easier to understand. I thought the tyranny of king washington (the infamy) was part of the torrent but after looking at the other links on your site, meaning other than the westpoint 1.04 patch it seems I have to download it. I also downloaded (the betrayal) from a torrent here on piratebay which doesn't work on your version of AC3. It's my fault for not carefully looking at your website, but perhaps you could've made it more clear in the description or the readme. Never mind, thank's again."
,spidey2033,2013-03-24T17:11Z,"Installed but cant play, im using win7 x64.. show AC3.exe stopped working.. and closing itself.. any idea? "
,CapnBin,2013-03-28T12:36Z,"@nosteam, if i download the update 1.04 and the 2nd part of the tyranny, you think it'll work with this game? thanks!"
,Lariet74,2013-04-01T04:22Z,"It's Easter weekend, so I had 3 days off, I spent pretty good chunk of it trying to get this game working, I admit I am not the most computer literate guy in the world, but after a day or two, there hasn't been a game yet, (other then this), that I couldn't get to work, I tried this one and Skidrow too, but I liked the fast that this one has the DLC right in it. I can't get it to work, any ideas, it just freezes after I click on the exe, I have it set to run as administrator and everything else. If anyone can help, it would be greatly appreciated, thanks."
,altieribn,2013-04-01T16:44Z,can any body tell me where is save game location
,Lariet74,2013-04-05T08:47Z,"Still no luck, when i try to start the game, it freezes EVERY TIME. I fiollowed the instructions, I have windows 7, all my computer stats are well above where they need to be. If anyone can help me, please email me, it's todd-laurette@hotmail.com
Thank very much, I love this game, i have it for the PS3, I just figured i could play the DLC's for free on here. Anyway, any help would be GREATLY appreciated, thanks again."
,TCostalonga,2013-04-06T02:23Z,"Thanks!!!
The game works pretty well!"
,916,2013-04-11T12:41Z,"For Those who are having the crash [acsp.exe stopped working] problem:

...Just Roll Back your Graphics Card Driver..[Go to Device Manager..display..properties]

If that didnt work..then along﻿ with the above step..make the acsp.exe compatible to Windows XP SP3...

Make sure the file is blocked by using firewall"
,chrisroberts3,2013-04-21T14:14Z,AC3 NEEDS to be updated to 1.05 because new DLC has been released. 
,Atlaua,2013-04-30T01:49Z,"This worked fine for me, Windows 7 64, just downloaded, ran part 1 then opened via desktop icon, couldn't be simpler. Thanks very much nosTEAM."
