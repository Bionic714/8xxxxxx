Plot:
Belgium, 1978. Katja, Roxy, and a group of other lively girls are too young for love, but still
almost mothers. In a hidden location, pregnant teenage girls await the birth of their babies in
secret. Some want to put their mistake behind them as soon as possible, but Katja, herself an
orphan, clearly wants something different: she longs to have her own little baby. During the
long wait, the girls share each other s joys and sorrows. They form close friendships and
distract themselves with strange games until the bubble bursts, and Katja becomes painfully
aware of the plans that the nuns are making behind their backs. She is not going to let this
happen to her baby, however... Little Black Spiders is a story about the beauty and strength of
unexpected friendships
