[V],politux,2013-02-24T08:00Z,This torrent is ripped from vinyl.
,raulf2012,2013-02-24T20:02Z,Could you rip it from the cd in FLAC please?  Not to bitch but the hum is a little much.

No, but you can feel free to rip it from CD and upload it."

[V],politux,2013-04-22T23:45Z,Feel free to trump my upload with one of your own.
