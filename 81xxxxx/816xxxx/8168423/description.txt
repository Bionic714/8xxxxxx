The final Twilight Saga begins with Bella now a vampire learning to use her abilities. And happy to see her daughter, Renesmme is flourishing. But when someone sees Renesmme do something that makes them think that she was turned. This person goes to the Volturri, because it is a violation to turn a child. And the penalty is death for both who turned the child into a vampire and the child, cause they deem a turned child too dangerous. Alice gets a vision of the Volturri coming after them. So the Cullens try to convince them that Renesmme is not a threat. So they ask friends and family to come stand with them. But when someone who has it in for the Volturri shows up and tells them they should be ready for a fight. And they get ready.
