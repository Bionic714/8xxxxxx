  The folky indie pop band Stornoway takes its name from a town in ScotlandΓÇÖs Outer Hebrides, but the group hails from Oxford, England. Singer/guitarist Brian Briggs, keyboardist/string player Jonathan Ouin, bassist Ollie Steadman, and drummer Rob Steadman (a pair of brothers from South Africa) formed the band while they were attending Oxford University; the well-studied band includes an ornithologist and a Russian translator among its ranks. The band debuted its jangly, largely acoustic sound -- which has drawn comparisons to James, Belle & Sebastian and XTC -- with a self-titled EP that included the song ΓÇ£Zorbing,ΓÇ¥ which was inspired by and named after the sport of rolling down a hill in a transparent sphere. 

  Another early single was 2007ΓÇÖs ΓÇ£The Good Fish Guide,ΓÇ¥ a musical list of which fish are plentiful to eat and which are endangered; its profits went to the Marine Conservation Society. Stornoway continued to refine their sound and had a breakthrough 2009: they headlined the BBC Introducing stage at BBC Radio 1ΓÇÖs Big Weekend that May and officially released "Zorbing," which included BriggsΓÇÖ brother Adam on trumpet, as a single that July. That summer, they also played festivals including Glastonbury, and wrote a tour journal for the Daily Telegraph. Their second single, "Unfaithful," which featured violin courtesy of touring member Rahul Satija, arrived that September, a month before StornowayΓÇÖs first headlining tour of the U.K. The band closed out the year by making the longlist for the BBCΓÇÖs Sounds of 2010 poll.
