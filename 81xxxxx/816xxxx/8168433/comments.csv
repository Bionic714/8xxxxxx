,janimorph007,2013-02-22T03:22Z,Looking for a mkv or mp4 version.  Can't do anything with this.  Is there a way to compress this onto a single-layer disc?  Or can I extract the video from this iso somehow?  What programs would I need?
,janimorph007,2013-02-22T16:39Z,"UPDATE:

I used Freemake Video Converter (http://www.freemake.com/free_video_converter/) to convert the main movie file, 00451.m2ts, to a 26GB mp4 file.  From there, Freemake lets me convert it into a single-layer Blu-Ray or anything else I want.

The picture quality is amazing!  Thanks, aoloffline!"
