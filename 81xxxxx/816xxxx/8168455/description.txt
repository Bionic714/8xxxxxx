For fans of Helen FieldingΓÇÖs Bridget JonesΓÇÖs Diary and Allison PearsonΓÇÖs I DonΓÇÖt Know How She Does It comes an irresistible novel of a woman losing herself . . . and finding herself again . . . in the middle of her life.

Maybe it was those extra five pounds IΓÇÖd gained. Maybe it was because I was about to turn the same age my mother was when I lost her. Maybe it was because after almost twenty years of marriage my husband and I seemed to be running out of things to say to each other.
 
But when the anonymous online study called ΓÇ£Marriage in the 21st CenturyΓÇ¥ showed up in my inbox, I had no idea how profoundly it would change my life. It wasnΓÇÖt long before I was assigned both a pseudonym (Wife 22) and a caseworker (Researcher 101). 
 
And, just like that, I found myself answering questions.
 
7. Sometimes I tell him heΓÇÖs snoring when heΓÇÖs not snoring so heΓÇÖll sleep in the guest room and I can have the bed all to myself.
61. Chet Baker on the tape player. He was cutting peppers for the salad. I looked at those hands and thought, I am going to have this manΓÇÖs children.
67. To not want what you donΓÇÖt have. What you canΓÇÖt have. What you shouldnΓÇÖt have.
32. That if we werenΓÇÖt careful, it was possible to forget one another.
 
Before the study, my life was an endless blur of school lunches and doctorΓÇÖs appointments, family dinners, budgets, and trying to discern the fastest-moving line at the grocery store. I was Alice Buckle: spouse of William and mother to Zoe and Peter, drama teacher andchatter, downloader of memories and Googler of solutions.
 
But these days, IΓÇÖm also Wife 22. And somehow, my anonymous correspondence with Researcher 101 has taken an unexpectedly personal turn. Soon, IΓÇÖll have to make a decisionΓÇöone that will affect my family, my marriage, my whole life. But at the moment, IΓÇÖm too busy answering questions. 
 
As it turns out, confession can be a very powerful aphrodisiac.
