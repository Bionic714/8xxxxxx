""His name is not Blackveil. It's ...""

YES! I knew it! This is gonna be awesome."
[T],GIANNIS511,2013-02-20T21:17Z,"Both Avengers and New Avengers have made such a great start that I might buy them too, if of course the comic shop in Greece bring them on Saturday (there is only one in my city and it brings new comics every 2-3 months) . I hope they continue like that. I've got to admit that many new Marvel releases are pretty good."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-02-20T22:25Z,"yes my friend, i expected marvel now to be a sales success, but i've been pleasantly surprised at the improved quality of 5 or 6 of these series. thanks again GIANNIS511!"
