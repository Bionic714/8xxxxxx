,TedDekker,2013-02-20T21:53Z,Thank You!
,TedDekker,2013-02-20T21:55Z,"Do you know where I could get sheet music? Like for the Artist Shawn McDonald? I'm learning how to play the guitar and I can not wait to start praising the Lord in person! Thanks ""TorrentTracts"" Your the Bestest!"
,TedDekker,2013-02-20T21:56Z,Just FYI I think I have collect about 1TB from you my friend is that about your collection or how much do you have? Man I would love to have it all even if I have to buy another hard drive! LOL!
[V],TorrentTracts,2013-02-20T23:57Z,"TedDekker, sheet music?  I don't think I ever come across any.  But I will make it a point to keep an eye open this week, specifically for sheet music, and if I find any, I'll post my findings back here."
[V],TorrentTracts,2013-02-21T00:01Z,"TedDekker, I think I'm hoovering around 20,000 albums or so by now.  Of that terabyte you mentioned, do you happen to know how many albums that adds up to?  And, like you, my 20K could easily be 40K, but for the available storage space, and more importantly, the lack of free time it would take to organize everything into my collection."
,Alcros,2013-02-21T00:21Z,"Great, great work torrenttracts. Brother, can you please please please upload discographies of steve green, scott wesley brown and the katinas in good quality? Thanks a million and god bless."
,TedDekker,2013-02-21T03:06Z,Man we need to buy you a hard drive or something. Ill have to try to find out a way to count all the albums. WoW you can double your collection that is amazing. 
,TedDekker,2013-02-21T03:07Z,"Thanks for checking on the sheet music, no biggie if you do not have any. I just can't wait to start playing some nice worship music with my new guitar. "
,TedDekker,2013-02-21T03:09Z,Thanks TorrentTracts Your the Best!
,iDivine,2013-02-21T14:37Z,"I knew you had a lot of music but that many albums?! Anyways, Thank you so much for your ministry! 

God Bless!"

,capemusic,2013-02-21T15:55Z,"THANK YOU - well, it's time to give back to you and the rest of your followers too - remember I asked for the old Hosanna stuff a while back: you can find lots of the old albums here and some other rarities: xtianchiki.b_l_o_g_s_p_o_t.c_o_m - Enjoy, God Bless!
PS. Remove the underscores..."
,capemusic,2013-02-21T16:09Z,"Hi TorrentTracts, sorry for the previous test - could not post, then I figured out the link is being filtered...

I'm a Christian songwriter/musician and learn from the versatility of artists/genres you have in your bundles... so from that I would like to think that secular artists, like Bruno Mars must be listening to our Christian artists too, cause lots of his last few songs have Christian themes and the recent popular ""Locked out of heaven"" has some christian rock ""musical"" elements in there too, that I have only heard from worship albums of church bands around the world...

Thanks again for you continued hard work doing this - You're the man (even if you're a woman, LOL)"
[V],TorrentTracts,2013-02-21T17:13Z,"Capemusic, thank you.  I'll be sure to check it out."
[V],TorrentTracts,2013-02-21T17:15Z,"Alcros, the only thing that troubles me is your ""in good quality"" comment.  ""Good quality"" should be purchased from the store where the Artist is supported, and food is put on their table.  What I share here are albums to ""sample before you buy"", regardless of the quality.  And that being said, I will indeed upload those three discographies for you."
,wiseacre6,2013-02-22T04:45Z,"TorrentTracts, do you have the discography of Downhere? Could you upload it?"
,actrosberg,2013-02-22T05:05Z,You are the best... no other person has been able to beat your consistent record in bringing these stuffs to many of us. Tx a million TorrentTracts!
,ITFPB,2013-02-23T04:28Z,"As always Thank you for all the great music. Seeding as much as I can. I Wanted to know if u might have the following Gospel Cds.
 Life Music by Jonathan McReynolds (Sep 25, 2012) 
 Bless This House by Kurt Carr & The Kurt Carr Singers (Jan 22, 2013) 
 Created4This (Deluxe) by VaShawn Mitchell (Aug 28, 2012)
 Thanks Again."
[V],TorrentTracts,2013-02-23T21:15Z,"ITFPB, it's going to take a little bit of searching on your part, but I'm pretty sure I included both ""Bless This House by Kurt Carr"" and ""Created4This"" in my 2012 bundles.  If so, you can get yourself a copy by sniffing through those older torrents."
