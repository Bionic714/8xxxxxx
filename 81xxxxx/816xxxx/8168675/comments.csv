,Jaylen1198,2013-03-01T20:53Z,Can you play online?
,Jaylen1198,2013-03-01T20:54Z,if so how because i cant seem to figure it out
,mcs1992,2013-03-06T17:57Z,not worth the download all the servers are russian servers witch is kinda pointless to americans since when you play on the servers your ping is through the roof... so in the end its only good for single player :/ but other than that its a good upload

That's right. All server is Russians or Ukrainian. Because its no law punch )"
,B.T.R.G.,2013-03-08T21:21Z,"I personally use the 2.1.1.8 version without updates and i play with my friends via Hamachi.This working perfect for us
We also used the 2.1.1.9 and 2.1.2.0 versions..we couldn't play LAN via Hamachi (i really don't know why), only at public servers but with very good ping!I can't speak for this version, i didn't try it yet..me and my mates use the 2.1.1.8 version cause we prefer the LAN gaming and it' s working perfect!"
[T],bruss.aka.durka9,2013-03-09T11:29Z,"to B.T.R.G.
2.1.1.8 is too old. Use 2.1.2.1 - latest. With 2.1.2.1 you can play on all no-steam servers (~190 servers) on iNet."
,B.T.R.G.,2013-03-09T22:29Z,"Thanks mate, we' ll try it!"
,dvrch,2013-03-10T16:41Z,"Whenever I try to join a server it says ""steam validation failed"". I have updated the game and am joining servers in the ""Custom"" tab. What am I doing wrong?"
[T],bruss.aka.durka9,2013-03-10T17:14Z,"to all
 Folow this step: Full off antivirus --> run updater --> off steam --> run game with administrator privileges --> enloy."
,dvrch,2013-03-10T18:24Z,"Thanks, running as an admin did it."
