,marvelnerd76,2013-02-20T17:06Z,I wanted to thank you for the New X-Men pack. I feel like its my birthday! That run got me excited to read comics again after giving up somewhere around 1995. You are the best my friend!
[V],STFmaryville,2013-02-20T17:19Z,"you're very welcome marvelnerd76. that one wasn't hard to do (after i actually took the time to locate it) because someone else had assembled the set, RARed it together. i just clicked a few buttons to share it here ... but yes, it's a great collection and one of my favorites too. thanks for saying thanks, comments like yours make ALL OF IT worthwhile."
,rirsss,2013-02-20T17:32Z,Wasn't there supposed to be 32 pages in this?
,steve1995,2013-02-20T18:14Z,YES! :D Thanks for uploading!
[V],STFmaryville,2013-02-20T18:22Z,"rirsss, 32 page comic, the ads are taken out.
this scan = 25 pages = 3 cover scans + 21 pages of story (including one double-page spread) + 1 scanner tag image = 25"

,rirsss,2013-02-21T21:29Z,"No, I mean, wasn't there supposed to be a back-up story of Hal Jordan and Sinestro? Or was it only shown on last page?"
