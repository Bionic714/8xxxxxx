,iceguy1,2013-02-20T23:19Z,"Hi, DL worked. Games starts.
But after using serial (Start) it runs an process of database update (no internet connection!) and seems to remove some content of the database.
After that game is ""empty"", not any content (so select) in Training, other things.

How to use that game? Thanks"
