,bonethugnharmony,2013-03-09T21:20Z,"You assholes who cannot get the game to run have to learn how to fucking read, but most important you dudes need to get the fuck off XP and join the modern world. We run windows 7 or 8 now. Who the fuck in their right mind runs XP or Vista, unless your printer is from the 1920´s and you have no choice. Some software is made for XP and alot of music software especially. So if you asshole want to game...get off XP, that´s a throwback. Fuck why not run Windows ´98 while you´re at it. READ THE FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS !!!!!  SMOKE THE KIND, NOT THE SHWAG. bone out yo !!!"
