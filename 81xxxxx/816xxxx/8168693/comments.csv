,CHibizoid,2013-03-04T09:43Z,"Thanks. A loooooong time ago I was really into train games but there was nothing for the Mac and looked with envy at the interesting-looking box of this game and the ability of the Windoze people to use it.
My interest on railroad games has been assuaged somewhat with time, but still this remains a very good game according to the knowledgeable and the experienced.
So thanks lots for allowing me to finally give it a go.
