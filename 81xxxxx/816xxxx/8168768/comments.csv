1. Unrar the main file, you will get a lot of .zip folders.

2. Select all the zip folder, right click, go to 7zip (or whatever you use DON'T use the regular windows extract) and select 'extract files...' - extract them all to one place.

3. You will then get a whole bunch of 7zip files - select the one without a number, extract that and you will get one setup file which is all you need. Phew!

Again, sorry for the inconvenience, maybe someone with better internet than me can upload just the setup without the need to extract."

That being said, wtf is this game?  Was looking for a light game to play on my netbook, and this fits the bill, but seriously..."
