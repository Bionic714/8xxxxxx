Those X-Men and Uncanny X-Men Masterworks were the cherry on top. I never seen those issues in such clarity before. They reminded me why I started reading in the first place. If you find or have anymore of the other volumes please include in future packs.  I'm gonna be reading those FF Visionaries volumes with a gigantic smile on my face. You are the man!"
