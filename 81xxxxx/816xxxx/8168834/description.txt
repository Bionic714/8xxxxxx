Small file, containing 3 images of the elusive AK47 Drop In Automatic disconnecter AKA "Lightning Link".

Not my Images, but I thought I would share them, as info on the Drop in auto disconnect is hard to find. I'm still looking for a template, and when I find it, I'll upload an update.

I'm in the 3rd world and using cellular internet, so if there are no seeders, please wait and I will resume seeding ASAP. Also, once dowloaded, please continue to seed. It's a small file after all.
