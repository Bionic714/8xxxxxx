SwiftKey replaces the touchscreen keyboard on your phone with one that understands how words work together, giving the worldΓÇÖs most accurate autocorrect - and predicting your next word before you press a key.

The keyboard learns as you use it to make corrections and predictions based on the way that you write. It can even learn from your Gmail,Twitter or blog to make its insights even more personalized. You can also enable up to three languages simultaneously, for true multi-lingual typing.

Switch seamlessly between tapping and gesture typing with our new SwiftKey Flow feature. It combines the mind-reading capabilities of SwiftKey with the speed of gliding your fingers across the screen. With ΓÇÿFlow Through SpaceΓÇÖ, you can also enter entire phrases without lifting your finger from the screen, simply by sliding to the space bar between words.
