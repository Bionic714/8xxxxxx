BBC Radio 4 Plays for AUGUST 2011 
 
I have captured most of these myself.
Thanks to Oldsoldier49 at OTRplus for providing me with a few fillers. 
  
If you are unfamiliar with BBC Radio plays I can recommend them for quality and variety ranging through humour, pathos, sci-fi, crime, romance, documentary etc. etc. etc. 
 
The format is vanilla CD quality (128kbps, 44kHz, Stereo, CBR).
They are all fully tagged with Title, Author, Date, Comments and Cover Art. 
 
The 23 Afternoon plays run for approx. 45 minutes each.
The 2  Friday plays run for approx. 55 minutes each.
The 4  Saturday plays run for approx. 60 or 90 minutes each. 
 
One caveat, you must be patient with my upload times and speed. I shall be active as often as possible but NOT 24/7.
