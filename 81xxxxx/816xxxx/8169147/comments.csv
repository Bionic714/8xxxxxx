,zero1zero,2013-02-21T17:01Z,If this is an official 2HD 720p release why is it in .avi? Shouldn't it be .mkv?

I checked this by downloading this torrent and the .srt file it contains, copying the S01E11 BTN .avi file into the folder, renaming it to match the S01E07 .avi filename and running a recheck in the torrent client. The recheck reports 100% good, which proves this is the S01E11 BTN release."
