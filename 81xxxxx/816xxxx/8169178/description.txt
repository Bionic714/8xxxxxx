Leroy Lowe, grand dragon of the Texas Ku Klux Klan confronts everything hes been taught to hate when hes sentenced to three years of hard labor on a prison work farm, where Warden Merville, dead set on rehabilitating Leroy, chooses Emilio, a Hispanic field worker imprisoned for fighting for labor rights, to be his cell-mate. Leroy, confined in a small cell with the enemy, far from the KKK comrades who deserted him, finds the chatty Emilio slowly chipping away at his anger and prejudice. His weekly rehabilitation meetings with the warden, barely tolerable as the man drones on about farm labor and field crops, take on a different meaning when Madalena, a beautiful Mexican maid is hired to clean the wardens office. An unconventional love story develops that opens Leroys eyes to the possibility of a different life. And a man who was a born and bred racist finds himself heading down a completely different path to salvation.
