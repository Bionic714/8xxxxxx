As Beirut exploded with the bombs and violence of a ruthless civil war in the ΓÇÖ80s, a nine-year-old Salma Abdelnour and her family fled Lebanon to start a new life in the States. Ever since thenΓÇö even as she built a thriving career as a food and travel writer in New York CityΓÇöSalma has had a hunch that Beirut was still her home. She kept dreaming of moving backΓÇöand finally decided to do it.

But could she resume her life in Beirut, so many years after her family moved away? Could she, or anyone for that matter, ever really go home again? 

Jasmine and Fire is SalmaΓÇÖs poignant and humorous journey of try-ing to resettle in Beirut and fumbling through the new realities of life in one of the worldΓÇÖs most complex, legendary, ever-vibrant, ever- troubled cities. WhatΓÇÖs more, in a year of roiling changes around the Middle East and the rise of the Arab Spring, Salma found herself in the midst of the turmoil, experiencing it all up close. 

As she comes to grips with all the changes in her lifeΓÇöa love left behind in New York and new relationships blossoming in BeirutΓÇöSalma takes comfort in some of LebanonΓÇÖs enduring traditions, particularly its extraordinary food culture. Through the sights, sounds, and flavors of a city full of beauty, tragedy, despair, and hope, Salma slowly begins to reconnect with the place sheΓÇÖs longed for her entire life.
