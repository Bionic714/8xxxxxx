,Synthesist,2013-02-21T10:27Z,"Pages 10, 12, 13, 15, 17 and 29 are corrupted and unrepairable."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-02-21T16:47Z,"bullshit. this file opens using CDisplayEx and every page loads. the archive is working and not corrupt, no corrupted pages, every page is present and viewable. any problem is on your end, with your software, or maybe you tried to open it before it finished downloading."
