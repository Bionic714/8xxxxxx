,Sovikos,2013-02-21T05:52Z,This is a CBR right?  Someone keeps uploading PDFs here... YUCK!
[V],STFmaryville,2013-02-21T16:38Z,"unnim2, you're welcome.

Sovikos, if i don't put the file type in the description, you can always click on the number to the right of the word ""Files:"" near the top of the page. then you can see the file type before downloading."
