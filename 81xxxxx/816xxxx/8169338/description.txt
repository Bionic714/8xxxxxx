Actual Window Manager is a technologically advanced utility tool that interacts with the Windows operating system's shell to bring the extended manipulation functionality to every window in the system.
It allows you to roll up/unroll windows, hide them to the Windows notification area (system tray), keep them always-on-top of others, make them semi-transparent - and many other advanced window actions available both in the automatic way (upon startup, activation/deactivation, minimization etc.) and in the manual way (via extra buttons added to each window's title bar or via extra options added to each window's system window menu).

Actual Window Manager keeps track of all the configuration changes you make to each individual window and applies the changes automatically on-the-fly!
