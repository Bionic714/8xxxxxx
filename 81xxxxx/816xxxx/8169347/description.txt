 The Filmfare Awards are presented annually by    
 The Times Group to honour both artistic and      
 technical excellence of professionals in the     
 Hindi language film industry of India. The       
 Filmfare ceremony is one of the oldest and       
 most prominent film events given for Hindi       
 films in India.The awards were first introduced  
 in 1954, the same year as the National Film      
 Awards.They were initially referred to as the    
 Clare Awards or The Clares after the editor of   
 The Times of India, Clare Mendonca. A dual voting
 system was developed in 1956.Under this system,  
 "in contrast to the National Film Awards, which  
 are decided by a panel appointed by Indian       
 Government, the Filmfare Awards are voted for by 
 both the public and a committee of experts."The  
 Filmfare Awards have been often referred to as   
 the Hindi film industry's equivalent to Oscars.
