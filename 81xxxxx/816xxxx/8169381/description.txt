Notes ....: The video on this movie is a bit tricky. It's a Dogme 95 inspired film,
           all shot with handheld video cameras, resulting in occasional field
           shifts (mostly in fast panning bits). Those are encoded into
           progressive fields and can't be removed. It appears to be partof the
           Dogme look. To be sure we compared it to PAL and NTSC dvds of this
           movie and both have those present as well. It's certainly not a case
           of bad PAL to NTSC convert as the PAL is a 5% speedup (2h14m on PAL,
           2h20m on NTSC).
