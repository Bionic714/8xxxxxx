Grand Prix Racer: The Manx Grand Prix

Travel Documentary hosted by Terry Cringle, published by ITV in 2013 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

A look at how for two weeks every summer the Isle of Man hosts an event where ordinary people attempt to do the extraordinary - ride the island's legendary 37-mile mountain course. This famous track has created legends and martyrs but the lure for these enthusiasts is to get the same buzz that their two-wheel heroes experience. Most are unlikely to carve a professional career out of the sport, but the risks and dangers are outweighed by the challenge to test themselves on one of the world's most famous circuits. Some are just happy to finish, but others have much higher goals.
