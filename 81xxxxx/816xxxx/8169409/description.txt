This is a hacked version of EarthBound for the SNES. I changed character stats, enemy stats, PSI effects and stats, store prices, and I even changed the name of some things to add creativity. My goal was to make this game more challenge and make it impossible to beat without strategy. This rom has been play tested and works best with the emulator snes9x. If anyone finds any problems with the game, I will fix them and re-upload. Other than that, just enjoy!
