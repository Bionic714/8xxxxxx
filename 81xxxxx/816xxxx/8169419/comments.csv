,dyslexikchicken,2013-03-24T23:57Z,"I agree. I was about to download anoXmous' until I saw the bitrates. Substandard. This is the ONLY decent low file size/high quality encode of Snatch in 1080p. Judging from the number of seeds though, it's clear that most people are clueless when it comes to bitrates and good encoding. Thank you Jalucian."
