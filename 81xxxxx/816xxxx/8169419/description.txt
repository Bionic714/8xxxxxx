Notes:

Since this is one of my all time favorite films, I also included several movie posters in a sub-folder. Subtitles in English are included as an .srt file. There's quite a lot of heavy "Pikey" accents in the film, so even English speakers may wish to use subtitles. 

Please seed for as long as possible, preferably until reaching a share ratio of at least 3:1.
