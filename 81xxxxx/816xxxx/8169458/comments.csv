,cindy25,2013-02-22T02:58Z,"@eurit35

because ABC in USA pressured Fox7 (in Australia) to pull it from their schedule "
,angelpunem,2013-02-22T20:18Z,"@cindy25, thank you Cindy for info. I will stop looking for english version till ABC re runs all the episodes including the last two, in the summer of 2013 as I read somewhere. That is why they are asking all countries not to air the last 2 episodes !!"
,eurit35,2013-02-22T21:53Z,"Thanks, cindy25!"
,moondog333,2013-02-23T06:39Z,"Is there an English version?

are you blind or illiterate  ??"
,cindy25,2013-02-25T08:38Z,"the English version is in the vaults of ABC studios, who are holding it back to prove a point"
,monnica688,2013-02-25T22:42Z,"They were showing the series in Australia. Looks like they pulled it there. You can go to Wikipedia and it tells you that it's only being shown in Spain.  Hum... so disappointed that ABC is making us wait until the summer? An english series is available in foreign countries but not here? I heard that they are re writing the ending so that they can tie up the series better. So we're going to have new episodes for ep. 10, 11, 12, & 13. should be interesting but I already saw 12 and 13 in Spanish and the ending was REALLY good!!! They really don't need to change it. The ending had a interesting plot twist but that's all I'll say. "
,saint84,2013-02-26T18:53Z,why not somebody put out a sub in english for ep 12 and 13 . that way. no need to look for english audio .
,ScarletteSpider,2013-02-27T07:24Z,"talked to some pals of mine in industry circles, seems that the real reasons and the ""official"" reasons for rewriting/reshooting the last four episodes is not entirely because they want to end it better. 

Apparently painting a bald successful business man and his trophy wife as having a pact with a demon was pissing off someone who thought this painted waaaaay too much a picture of his real person. 

This person was compared to an orangutan by good ol' Bill Maher who's being sued by this person for making that joke. 

So imagine the crap storm that rained down on ABC from this persons lawyers when he thought they were making a parody of him in 666 Park Ave!?!

Only goes to show that absolute power corrupts absolutely and money is the root of all evil lol"
