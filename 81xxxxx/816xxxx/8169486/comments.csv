,Strajow,2013-02-21T23:32Z,"ATTENTION EVERYONE PLEASE!!

THIS IS NOT A DVD SCR. 
NONE OF THE ""RISE OF THE GUARDIANS"" UPLOADED ARE DVDSCR'S.

DO NOT DOWNLOAD IF YOU THINK YOU ARE GETTING DVD SCR QUALITY.. 

FKN SKULLS MISLEADING USERS :/"

One of my new favorite movies, thanks scene4all, great torrent."
,Strajow,2013-02-22T02:21Z,"@Lynx.. What I said was far from being a lie, you have no idea what you are talking about with all those 10s.."
,Hanne70,2013-02-22T04:31Z,"Strajow: Why don't you go F**K yourself...

--- --- --- ---

I just watched some of the start of this movie. It is for me whit a 32"" tv a perfect quality. And the sound was good too :)

AND it is a screener... it got the sub text in the bottom of the screen...

,Strajow,2013-02-22T07:01Z,Ok Hanne70.. But it's not a screener..
,Hanne70,2013-02-22T07:46Z,"@Strajow

Do you know what a screener is? Have you downloaded this movie?

I assume you like BS like this because you are a little brat..."
,Strajow,2013-02-22T23:09Z,"just because the dreamworks writing comes on every now and then, does not mean this actual file is a screener. You have a lot to learn, I have downloaded every ROTG on here thank you. Brat? Yeah ok.. "
,HelveteShit,2013-02-23T13:07Z,"@Strajow. The fact that you have written the disclaimer on every and each download I doubt you have downloaded them all.

But I will not judge you just yet, going to wait for the download to finish then see if you are full of bull shit or if the others are. "
,HelveteShit,2013-02-23T13:22Z,"@Strajow

Scene4all record of uploads seems rather intact and good. Therefore the chances of this being a false one but this is false.

The video quality is of a DVD screen and perhaps not the same quality as a DVD disc but its close enough.

The file is legit all through, you are full of bullshit.

Next time, glance into the uploader and see if he has uploaded false torrents before to get a better grasp, he hasn't. So his legit. So stop bullshit about,. "
,HelveteShit,2013-02-23T14:52Z,"Correction to my upper comment.

Meant to write

""Scene4all record of uploads seems rather intact and good. Therefore the chances of this being a false is rather minimum. "" And so on. "
,Kapri25,2013-02-24T23:30Z,"You know...I do not know why people complain about things like what the uploaders title their uploads. If it is not a fake and has pretty good quality than their is nothing to cry over. It is free. Get over yourselves.

By the way, thank you scene4all for another great upload! Keep em coming!"

The quality of this movie is just as good as any I've seen. It appears to have been a copy that was intercepted while being sent for awards consideration.

Every now and again (ever 30min I think) a small non obstructive caption pops up that says:

""For awards consideration ONLY. Property of DreamWorks Animation, LLC.""

Once again, perfect quality and a very good movie."
