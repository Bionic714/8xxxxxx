This book has very good and solid points backed up by the word of God. Anyone that is curious to our spirtual armor and weapons should pick this up. This is not a guide to doing everything right, but only more of a 'side-manuel' explaining a few things that God has given us to defend and more importantly attack the devil..

We are not fighting against people.. we are not fighting against countries.. we are fighting against strongholds and walls in people's minds..

This is a battle not won with force.. but Love.. and in Love the Word of God, Prayer, Preaching, and Lifting one another up.
