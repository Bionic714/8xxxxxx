,Jman2919,2013-02-20T22:47Z,thank you!!!
,Rakanoth02,2013-02-20T22:52Z,Hello Mr Stifmeister is it possible to use this DLCs on a legit version due to i own AC3 on uplay and have it legit. Or will i risk that i will get banned if i use those DLC without pay for it?
,Frosticee,2013-02-20T23:04Z,"For the Steam version, I think you have to have bought at least one DLC. I may be very wrong however."
,n1x4,2013-02-20T23:05Z,"Just a heads-up. This DLC is EXTREMELY buggy. I mean the Starship Troopers have seen fewer bugs. Anyways I've tried multiple unlockers and saves/cracks and they're all the same so once again it's Ubisofts _FINE_ work at hand.

Major bugs I've encountered include:
-random CTD
-loss of tomahawk (no stores to get it back)
-skinning sounds glitch horribly
-do NOT trust the 'saving icon'

Otherwise, yay for AC3."
,n1x4,2013-02-20T23:24Z,Really? You're going to remove my comment warning users about major bugs in this DLC?

,Jman2919,2013-02-21T14:33Z,The dlc works fine ive experienced no bugs or issues but... installing the crack made me lose my saved games in the main games. I still have them on my computer where there supposed to be but in the game it wont let me load them and only lets me start a new game. any ideas how i can fix that?
,sanazin,2013-02-21T15:07Z,"When you've installed the DLC, how do you start it in the game?"
,[F]OxY,2013-02-21T15:24Z,"Damn it, if i know this DLC is coming up, i wouldn't delete my AC3

,goldinguy,2013-02-21T20:38Z,"I played and completed AC3 on PS, now I want to play the DLC on my computer. Can I access the DLC without a save game that has completed AC3? How do you start the DLC?"
,Jiraya_90,2013-02-21T22:49Z,"First of all thanks for the sharing. 
for @Jman2919  and the other losing the main saves. I had the same issue..you must copy again the previous crack version you were using BEFORE (in my case was THETA) in the game folder, so download and install your version one more time, this will make them appear again..remember they cannot go togheter with the dlc crack. So you must make a copy of the original crack and save it somewhere else until you finish the dlc..then restore it whenever you like to play again the main story. To get wich version you had look for the save files: 
RELOADED ""C:ProgramDataorbit54"" 
SKIDROW C:UsersYour_UserAppDataLocalUbisoft Game Launchersavegame_storagec2tpZHJvdw==54
THETA C:UsersYour_UserAppDataRoamingThetaorbit54

I hope  this can help someone."
,Jiraya_90,2013-02-21T22:55Z,"***To get which crack version you had before, you will have to look for your save files folder location:

,jadawgkss,2013-02-24T05:46Z,"Not sure if this has been posted, but, someone on another site figured out updating to 1.02 and the 1.03 in preparation for installing this game. All credits go to Max Mouse:

Man I went through hell to find a way to get this to work with blackbox and to update blackbox

It was hard but finally I got blackbox repack updated from 1.00 to 1.03 … It wasnt working because it needed the Russian update.. Game still looks English and all after the update
The repack version doesn’t have multiplayer so to update them without errors you have to do what mylock posted for 1.01, 1.02, and 1.03

Workaround for a successful install of patch 1.02 on rip/repacks:

Seems that MP contents are not included (Black Box version or others) but the 1.02 update needs to update these MP files.
You may try like this:
1. Run the update exe, wait until the welcome info comes out.
2. Go to your TEMP folder (press win+r and type %TEMP%), find extracted patch files, which may inside the folder called {9D15E813-0C26-41E7-ABC5-3EB06FF1B3CF} or something like this.
3. Delete Disk1deltaFilesmulti
4. Switch to installation, press next to start.

Have phun! :D [/quote]

If you having trouble finding the folder like I did… after going to the Temp folder Type “deltaFiles” in the search bar(while you are in the Temp folder) and you should see the deltaFiles folder

Now you should be able to install the DLC Washington Tyranny(that require 1.03) DLC doesnt show up or its asking to get the DLC when you already install it on the main menu.. you need a DLC unlocker for it or with somebody save file with DLC unlocked on it…. had to use a torrent from piratebay for that.."

,gilknut,2013-02-28T06:00Z,"Just to be clear: Do you start from scratch so to speak in this DLC, or do you get to continue and build on the items and skills you've built up in the actual game? If not, it would save me a lot of time downloading and installing it.  "

,Fangheart,2013-03-01T04:53Z,does this work with the skidrow release?
,Dufox,2013-03-02T00:33Z,"it works with skidrow release.

this is exactly what i did.

1. downloaded skidrows release cracked it played it.
2. downloaded http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8095873/Assassins_Creed_III_Update_v1.02_-RELOADED___DLC_Audio_em_PT-BR
the readme was in spanish but it is english and worked for me
3. downloaded http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8153871/Assassins.Creed.III.Update.v1.03-RELOADED
4. downloaded this dlc, installed it cracked it.
5. played it, got a never ending load screen about an hour in, exited the game with alt f4, started the game again and realized my game didnt save.
6. started the dlc from my save file that said 0:00 playtime, pressed start, exited the game with the quit button and realized my game says 0:17 on playtime.

been playing ever since and have not had any issues with my save or never ending load screens.
(so basically if your game doesnt save, try to start up the dlc and then quit the dlc and go back to the main menu to see if it makes the save start working)"
,Dewarton,2013-03-02T03:16Z,"If u previously cracked the game with the skidrow's crack, u won't be able to access the DLC.
- Install skidrow release
- Install patch 1.02
- Install patch 1.03
- Install DLC
- Copy crack from DLC iso

U'll have no sound at ubisoft logo  and in 1st cinematic but rest works perfect."
,Dewarton,2013-03-02T03:23Z,"Ofc i mean clean installs, don't put any crack except the DLC iso one at the end. if u used the skidrow crack then reinstall and restart a new game."

,bladeks66,2013-03-04T19:06Z,"i reinstalled the game, installed update 1.02, 1.03 and the dlc, copied the crack only from the dlc. when i want to start the dlc it says ubisoft server unavailable ! please help !!!"
,Elgguod,2013-03-05T05:43Z,Terrible download speeds. At least it's free...

,jcpangs,2013-03-10T08:09Z,"downloaded the ac3 game from http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7844040/Assassin_s_Creed_III_-_THETA_(2012)_PC_[ENG_RUS]_RePack

tyranny wont work on that version so I have to download the skidrow/reloaded version. work pretty great but the save file is diffrent. the theta repack version is using .save while this version is using .sav do you guys know how to convert it?"

,trigun3232,2013-03-24T17:37Z,"@jadawgkss Dude if your going to share something please give complete details and stop making it look like your some big guy who just discovered a big scientific breakthrough by making it look harder than it seems. -.-

to those looking on how to update blackbox repack, you need Rus installer of update 1.2 you can get that by going to your AC3 install directory and open assassin's creed 3.exe (NOT AC3SP!) this will open ubi updater and that will get you your rus update.

your 1.02 update will be found on temp folder(just type in the address: %temp%) and is named ubi6C4.tmp.exe run that then do what jadawgkss just said, type in the search ""deltafiles"" then delete multi, then run the installer again. then just work your way around that installer.

then to update to 1.03 you need to use ubi updater again then look again at temp folder the filename is ubi93F8.tmp, delete multi then do everything by yourself and apply 1.3 crack

then your free to install your dlc."
,trigun3232,2013-03-24T18:12Z,"btw, after installation i lost my save game so... lol thats sad, anyway the games pretty easy anyway."
,Renjalpaca,2013-03-30T20:18Z,"@Dewarton Your post is a load of BS, I did your steps and only placed the crack of the DLC iso, and it launched Uplay and tried to validate the game by asking me to go online."
,harsh2193,2013-04-14T13:14Z,"@trigun3232 I installed the blackbox repack version  and followed your steps but the ubisoft autopatcher downloaded the v1.01 rus updater. When i try to follow the rest of the steps, i.e after deleting the ""multi"" folder, i get an error ""Couldn't backup AC3MP.exe to file"".
What do i do?
Please Help"
