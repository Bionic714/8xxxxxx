General Notes:

Since Charlie Miller recently seeded a very nice 1st or 2nd row FOB AUD,
with plenty of Garcia's guitar in the mix, I decided to couple it with
the well circulated SBD since that source was woefully lacking in the
guitar in the mix factor, due to the fact that Garcia's stage volume was
plenty loud and little reinforcement was needed from the SBD, especially
in the first few tunes of the first set.  The mix of the SBD improves by
Knockin', but Jerry stays relatively low in the mix for the rest of
the show; thus, having plenty of him in the AUD, allow the two sources to
work well together. The fact that Cleveland Music Hall is a nice sounding
room also helps.

This is a great show with a very tasty setlist.  The whole band is on,
and Jerry never lets up, all the way from Melody through Tangled.

Thanks to everyone involved. For the FOB AUD, thanks to the person who
recorded it, to Dave Lisuch for the 2nd gen cassettes which Charlie Miller
transfered, edited and coverted to FLAC; for the SBD, thanks to whoever
recorded it, to Mike Lai for the original seed which jakemerc edited and
converted to SHN.
