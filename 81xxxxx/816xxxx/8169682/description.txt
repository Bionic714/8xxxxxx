This is a book for brave, nonconformist women (or for those who aspire to be), written from the heart and soul of a spiritual rocker chick. Lifelong psychic Lisa Marie Selow leads you to uncover your true self, reveal your life purpose, and carve out your spiritual path. She invites you to engage in positive rebellion by subverting your good-girl persona, letting go of limiting beliefs that youΓÇÖve inherited, and creating your own definition of perfect. Lisa encourages you to be a different type of rebel, one that defies the stereotype of a misfit loner without a cause. Instead, youΓÇÖre called to make a difference, rocking the world with your unique gifts and talents.

Through enjoyable, engaging exercises, youΓÇÖll create your very own manual for living according to your own rules. You can, as a modern mystic, drop out of the School of Hard Knocks, for instance. Lisa shares compelling stories from her own life as well as those of other women (including mentors from history) to illustrate how you can radically rewrite your life story.

Starting your journey from the premise that you already are perfect, A Rebel Chick MysticΓÇÖs Guide will help you excavate the real youΓÇöand, in the process, youΓÇÖll be guided to design action plans to move forward with the dreams and goals that make you the unique and amazing person you are.
