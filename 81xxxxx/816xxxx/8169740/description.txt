Amanda survived crazy at the hands of the psychopath, Lorre.  But the Livers are a new kind of insanity that threatens to push her narrow grasp on reality into the embrace of schizophrenia.  With an army of Rat Crossed out to slurp her insides through a straw and three certified lunatics fighting over her, the only sane choice seems to be a bullet in the head.
