This excellent long-out-of-print book was nowhere to be found on the web, so I bought a copy, scanned it in - and here it is!

Anyone searching for it will know what it's about, but for the uninitiated, it's basically the true-life story about a group in the US who decided to try and use technology to communicate with the dead, rather than continuing to rely on the vagaries of human mediums - with some very interesting results.
