Sonic.and.All.Stars.Racing.Transformed.Update.1.and.Metal.Sonic.and.Outrun.DLC-RELOADEDSonic.and.All.Stars.Racing.Transformed.Update.1.and.Metal.Sonic.and.Outrun.DLC.exe » RAR » steam_api.dll - a variant of Win32/Packed.VMProtect.AAH trojan

Translated for everyone:   T R O J A N ! ! ! Don't download !!!"
,AIXI,2013-02-26T05:01Z,"the Win32/Packed.VMProtect.AAH is reported in a lot of reloaded cracks. After all a crack is a program that changes the behavior of a program and a lot of times makes on the fly memory changes like a lot of virus.

But if you trust your antivirus more than Reloaded I suggest to delete all of their cracks"
,tomahawk_dts,2013-02-26T08:06Z,It's not about Reloaded group (even if you sound like you known them very well and you trust them with your life :))) ...  The path from the release group to TPB is not so much trustworthy....
