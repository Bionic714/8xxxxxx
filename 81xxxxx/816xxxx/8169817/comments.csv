Great uploads. Have any idea where the pbs documentaries are of Japanese film directors is? It was accompanied by a film from each. This is how I saw ""Boy"" for the first time. I remember seeing it in the 1970s ( I think). It was fablulous. Also, can you provide a listing of films you plan to release here. Your taste is amazing."
