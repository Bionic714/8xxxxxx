Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site :: On this Wednesday, February 20 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex covers the outrageous move by law enforcement to use shooting targets depicting children, pregnant women and elderly gun owners, an effort lavishly funded by a Department of Homeland Security grant totaling almost $2 million. 

Alex also analyzes the ongoing anti-Second Amendment move by Democrats in state legislatures and the federal government and the effort by advocates of firearms rights to resist further destruction of the Second Amendment.
