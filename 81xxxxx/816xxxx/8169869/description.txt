Big Beach Bootique 5 is a recording from his hometown show in Brighton and is everything youΓÇÖd expect from a Fatboy Slim live set; bodacious, four-to-the-floor, in-your-face dirty house tunes. Featuring cuts from likes of Chuckie, Basement Jaxx and Nicky Romero in amongst his biggest bangers that he teases in and out of the mix.
