,RNI75,2013-02-21T04:26Z,"This is even worse than the Hungarian version.
It is worth the wait to English.
Where this is not where sound, lousy quality."
,rzrthrone,2013-02-21T06:58Z,"Watchable, if you speak Russian... To much of the movie is in russian with non english subtitles..

Still watchable though.

,Kurius_,2013-02-21T07:00Z,"Wtf are ya'll talking about? This is ENGLISH, only a few moments in russian and the a/v is great. Thank you!"
,S.U.J.A.Y,2013-02-21T07:02Z,Not Bad
,NecroFile,2013-02-21T10:00Z,"Of course a lot of the movie is in Russia; it fucking takes place in Moscow. There should be subtitles, though. I like being able to understand what the bad guys are saying."
,saint84,2013-02-21T10:05Z,the cam source is okay. however the encoding is crap. heavily pixelated . i suggest a bigger file or a 264x encoding of the source for better quality
,Tanlic,2013-02-21T10:54Z,"The problem with this movie is they all want to be as tough as John McLane but Yippee-ki-январь, московское татарское студенческое собрание"" is Russian for Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker but it takes so long to say in their language McClane kills them all before they can finish the sentence.....bit unfair on the ruskies but life sux whe your a bad guy :0)"
,Music_Is_My_Life,2013-02-21T11:48Z,Someone could always take the audio from this and add it into the hungarian cam version which has a bit better quality.
,Imgupl,2013-02-21T16:41Z,Thank you for polish subtitles. You're the man :]
,Lycanthrofred,2013-02-21T21:42Z,"Thanx for the upload...by the  Screenshots i can seen is not a good quality,ill wait for a better version."

O and btw for all the shit talkers, THIS IS FREE STOP COMPLAINING. Stop being a bum and go to the theater."
,woprr,2013-02-22T11:58Z,"@jalucian
Because h.264 is a >80% (C)PU time and electric power waste without any real senseable quality improvement over MPEG4 Part2 just for making money with fucking patents."
,woprr,2013-02-22T12:14Z,Hail x264! x264 ueber alles! :P
,michaelrwatson,2013-03-10T05:56Z,"Hmm, a version for people who are bilingual in English and Polish!"
