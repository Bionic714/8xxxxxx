The tags are from another album however, check that out and correct you downloaders :-)"
[T],mikesanderspqrs,2013-02-21T13:14Z,"By tags I guess you mean the album cover info (when shown in VLC). This was one of my earlier rips where I used Switch Sound Converter and I've now found it's shite when it comes to that sort of thing (the rips good though).
Many of my uploads will now be using CUETools or EAC (but I've still got quite a few of these earlier ones I'm afraid)."
