I hope you also have 56, 57 and 59 to round out the set.

Most appreciated."

I should mention that after listening to some of these Bear Family sets you have shared, I have purchased a couple volumes from some of their other sets. 

So the Sony/EMI nazis who want to shut down these websites should understand that sharing music leads to a newly educated music fan buying more music, not less.

Thanks again."
