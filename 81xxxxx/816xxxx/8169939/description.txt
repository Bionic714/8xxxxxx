A book of stunning power - by one of the most heralded writers of the past thirty years. Set just after the events of September 2001, about a twenty-year-old woman from a small midwestern farm, making her way, coming of age. Under the novel's languid, easygoing surface, Moore's deft, lyrical writing brings us up against the heart of racism, the shock of war, and the carelessness perpetrated against others in the name of love.
