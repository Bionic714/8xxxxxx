,JustAnotherApprentice,2013-02-21T15:43Z,"Thanks a lot,Giannis511!

 STFmaryville,why are you glad with the sales going down?"
,hombrep,2013-02-21T23:09Z,"Sales are down? not really, they actually are getting to the normal rate - it seems down because last month was the highest:

I feel sorry for you. In my view, the current stories are as interesting as the old ones (maybe even more). You may hate change, but to me they are welcome"

[V],STFmaryville,2013-02-22T04:16Z,"Amazing 695 : 58,185
Amazing 696 : 57,950
Amazing 697 : 59,872
Amazing 698 : 81,342
Amazing 699 : 74,904
Amazing 700 : 200,966
Superior 1 : 188,182
Superior 2 : 112,546

so after a precipitous 40% drop in sales from #1 to #2 (not unusual for a relaunch), this issue's likely to clock in at between 55,000 to 65,000 ... which would mean the octospidey crap had no long-term benefit.

and please don't forget, those 200,000 copies? MAYBE the shops sold 2/3 of those ... by summer the rest will be on ebay for $1. predatory publishing stunts (mostly marvel's, in fact) led to the bust of the mid-90s.

@the_darkmaster, hey if you like this shit, enjoy it my friend! but don't feel sorry for me. i have better taste. the storyline's pacing is awful, and the entire premise is ridiculous. here's ""a villain with a heart of gold"" and peter ""died"" only to show up (publishing time) weeks later as the ""jiminy cricket conscience"" ghost. how can family, friends, co-workers and dudes like cap, wolvie, DD, and stark not know this isn't peter, when octospidey isn't even trying to be? slott's a hack and the art is shit.

this was, is, and will be remembered as a cheap publicity stunt like the clone saga."
,hombrep,2013-02-22T05:53Z,"not really - the normal rate is around 55,000 - If sales would go down, it would be less than 40,000 - as I said in my last comment - they seem going down, but it is because all collectors and sellers got the last and first issues - but the people who are actually reading did not change pretty much - it will be always the average between 50,000 - 60,000 - as I said, if goes less than 40,000, than yes, something is happening - 

as for the plot, so far so good - the art is much better than clone saga - we have to thank heavens and other Gods for not having crap Mark Bagley, he only does faces as Namor, have you noticed? I feel pity for FF4 now. Mark Bagley was the worse for Spider-Man. Stegman did great in the first 3 issues a lá McFarlane and  Giuseppe Camuncoli is like the new Sal Buscema - I am not sad for Kafka's death, actually - for me, she was like the spider-signal - a mockery that should belong only to batman's crap plots - "
,HeyNow01138,2013-02-22T14:37Z,Hey now!
[V],STFmaryville,2013-02-22T15:59Z,"yes hombrep but the people who are actually reading is supposed to change! it should be growing again! look at a similar title, also over 8 issues:

invincible iron man 525 - 30,885
invincible iron man 526 - 35,934
invincible iron man 527 - 36,981
iron man 1 - 116,529
iron man 2 - 72,902
iron man 3 - 59,041
iron man 4 - 56,708
iron man 5 - 50,899

so i.i.m. averaged exactly 34,600 on its last 3 issues, relaunched and is averaging 53,000-55,000. this series has gained 55% in sales from ""marvel now"". will it be sustained? maybe not, but let's assume i'm right and the spider-man sales continue to dip down to 60,000 or less. they've gained nothing. why? people generally and genuinely hate this crap.

the main difference is, iron man's creative team didn't use a meaningless death, hype, and a story that flies in the face of logic.

by attracting maybe 10,000 *potential comic book readers* to buy #700 and perhaps 1/2 of those came back to buy the new #1, and yet by having no skill at pacing a storyline (peter the friendly ghost intro), how many of those people got ""hooked"" and became customers at a local comics shop? very few. how many are pissed because they bought an $8 ""death of spider-man"" issue that was invalidated a couple of weeks later? probably a lot. = bad for the entire industry.

hombrep, we are never going to agree on good art because i see mark bagley as one of the 2 or 3 best spider-man artists of the last 25 years. (romita jr. and deodato are the others.) stegman is awful, mcfarlane was awful at marvel and only decent on spawn, and camuncoli makes me want to stab out my eyes with a pencil! we obviously have completely different opinions about art."
