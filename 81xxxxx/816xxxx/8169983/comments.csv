,auxilix,2013-03-03T19:13Z,"great video, mostly focusing on the mixing habits for their drums (which i think is a HUGE thing to talk about for them).

definitely not the best video for beginners but for people out there that want to learn more about how to make their percussion feel a bit snappier and how to get things to fit in the mix altogether, this is a MUST. ty cypher909 :D"
,thepisstank,2013-04-25T20:41Z,yeah i respect them for taking the time to chat about their drum process but what's up with the awkward vibes coming off of them? i know it's not just me feeling it.. it's so strange
