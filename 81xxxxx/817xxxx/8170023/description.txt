ΓÇ£The Earth is a mosqueΓÇ¥

Muslims are compelled by their religion to praise the Creator and to care for their community. But what is not widely known is that there are deep and long-standing connections between Islamic teachings and environmentalism. In this groundbreaking book, Ibrahim Abdul-Matin draws on research, scripture, and interviews with Muslim Americans to trace IslamΓÇÖs preoccupation with humankindΓÇÖs collective role as stewards of the Earth. Abdul-Matin points out that the Prophet Muhammad declared that ΓÇ£the Earth is a mosque.ΓÇ¥

Deen means ΓÇ£pathΓÇ¥ or ΓÇ£wayΓÇ¥ in Arabic. Abdul-Matin offers dozens of examples of how Muslims can follow, and already are following, a Green Deen in four areas: ΓÇ£waste, watts (energy), water, and food.ΓÇ¥ At last, people of all beliefs can appreciate the gifts and contributions that Islam and Muslims bring to the environmental movement.
