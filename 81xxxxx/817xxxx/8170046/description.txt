'At the age of thirteen, I knew that I was destined to marry John Travolta. One day he would arrive on my North London doorstep, fall madly in love with me and ask me to marry him. Then he would convert to Islam and become a devoted Muslim.' Shelina is keeping a very surprising secret under her headscarf - she wants to fall in love and find her faith. Torn between the Buxom Aunties, romantic comedies and mosque Imams, she decides to follow the arranged-marriage route to finding Mr Right, Muslim-style. Shelina's captivating journey begins as a search for the One, but along the way she also discovers herself and her faith. Shelina is your conspirator. Smiling cheekily at you from under her headscarf, you may never have imagined what goes on in the life of Muslim women. You will put the book down at the end having found a new and unexpected friend in her. Love in a Headscarf is a light-hearted yet sensitive book with a hilarious twist from one of Britain's leading female Muslim writers. It is an entertaining, fresh and un-missable insight into what it means to be a young British Muslim woman.
