,hisazul,2013-02-22T17:28Z,"Ehem Since I never actually specified what I corrected.
Conjure Seeker
Conjure Ash Spawn
2 Greater powers related to summoning Werebear. One is the one from beast stone and 1 is... unused.
Greater power for Summoning K...something Big guy that you killed back in Morrowind. All 3 versions of it.
Conjure spectral dragon. It summons 1 fire wyrm. Summon ancients works fine.
Conjure Ash Guardian also works fine due to the way spell is handled.
Butler, Black Market and Bardic Knowledge work fine.
Didn't really find anything else in files relevant to conjuration."
