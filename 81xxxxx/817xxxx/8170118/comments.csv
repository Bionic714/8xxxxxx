,Whobuysgames,2013-02-21T07:37Z,"the blizzard client is P2P as it is, no need for torrents"
,EvoPnk,2013-02-21T07:51Z,"Hey^ can u jus STFU. Its for an private server. If u dont know about it dont say it.
Idoits."
,smperault,2013-02-21T09:05Z,Hey^ Can you learn how to spell?  This torrent makes no fucking sense at all.  You can actually d/l all the patches single from Blizzard.  It doesn't matter that its for a private server.  
,smperault,2013-02-21T09:05Z,what server is this for?
,solarysta,2013-02-21T09:43Z,are you people retarded or something? he clearly said it's for a private server so why the fuck you keep telling to go to blizzard site nabzors
,stfug33k,2013-02-21T10:02Z,"It's for Molten WoW, Because they will launch a 4.3.4 version of server"
,EvoPnk,2013-02-21T10:07Z,"Its for molten wow. And you will see how its seeders and leechers increase :)
Just think before you speak.
Peace"
,bloodlust7,2013-02-21T10:14Z,its for molten-wow. and also downloading or patching wow from offcial patcher somehow prevents you from connecting to a private server...so download from here
,Glorf92,2013-02-21T11:50Z,Can't wait! Although it'll probably be buggy as hell at first...
,papayrus,2013-02-21T12:36Z,I am confused. My old molten cata is like 28gb this is only 11.46gb. Can I delete the old huge one and just use this and why is it so much smaller?
,solarysta,2013-02-21T13:51Z,If you dont want to play for the next week or 2 - yes
,EvoPnk,2013-02-21T14:27Z,"You can deleted it.
The torrent have 4 files in it. all .rar
1st You have to extract them."
,papayrus,2013-02-21T15:43Z,Oh ok nice so it's just very compressed. Thanks for the info.
,hector2,2013-02-21T18:27Z,Thanks.
,blacktemple,2013-02-21T21:01Z,We can try crusade gamign (is a server)
,McLyster,2013-02-21T21:36Z,"@blacktemple
how about you gtfo with your advertisement of a sad little server? cunt"
,blaymoric,2013-02-22T02:07Z,"I suppose if any WoW community could pull off 4.3.4 and make it stable, it'd be Molten. Anyone else think their working for Blizzard?"
,Tukislav,2013-02-22T03:14Z,^ /facepalm
,bloodlust7,2013-02-22T04:46Z,Molten-wow forevaaaaaaaaah!!!!!!!!!
,EvoPnk,2013-02-22T07:57Z,"@blaymoric LOL, you really make me thought that they do it. :D"
,norka25,2013-02-22T09:33Z,Molten wow community is bigger than Blizzards !!!
,Vemfanvet,2013-02-22T23:16Z,"^ hahah omg >.<
So many trolls here"
,shhnedo,2013-02-24T09:48Z,Perfect for 4 DVDs. Thanks for the upload.
,Dragonate,2013-02-24T16:45Z,463 Seeders and i downloading with 200 kB/s
,kaoru.,2013-02-25T04:25Z,"oh no major update wah huge! 

their private server is almost like retail, they actually fix the bugs, compared to other servers.
10000+ pop. My fav actually."
,twix2010,2013-02-26T03:00Z,Just curious is this for online gaming only or can I use this also on a standalone? Thanks.
,papayrus,2013-02-26T08:52Z,Hey after I extracted this it is 14.8gb still alot smaller than the older cata at 28gb. Is 14.8gb the right size and why is it half the size of the older cata client?
,Tukislav,2013-02-26T17:22Z,"@papayrus

The rest will download when you play.It will grow to ~30GB again don't worry."
,shhnedo,2013-02-26T18:58Z,"@papayrus
It's 15GB large because it's missing the gamedirDataCache folder which contains a lot of game data. Blizz made it so can download that data while being able to connect and play."
,technowolfie,2013-02-26T22:54Z,I have all 4 rar downloaded but how do i get them to extract correctly without deleting the copy?
,Tukislav,2013-02-27T01:58Z,"@technowolfie
Right click on part1>Extract to World of Warcraft: Cataclysm 4.3.4 (15595) (it will create new folder with extracted files)."
,ircomputer,2013-02-27T09:32Z,SEED PLEASE!!! :)
,subv3r7,2013-02-27T12:01Z,"Can i extract 1-4 .rars into my current Cata 4.0.6 folder and ""replace all"" when it ask?"
,TyrantOfDeath,2013-03-01T02:26Z,This is gonna take for ever to download...
,papayrus,2013-03-01T11:09Z,Aw I would rather have downloaded the whole 30gb then since I am putting it on more than one computer. Oh well I guess I can run it on one computer for awhile till all content downloads then copy over to another computer.
,ludimacak,2013-03-01T18:36Z,do i have to extract all to 1 folder
,mrcintrao,2013-03-01T18:39Z,"Can any one Please tell me what's happening my download speed is soooo low and my internet conection/speed is awsome im using uTorrent and it says that it will take a week. Please tell me what i can do, I realy want to play it when the server Sargeras is transfered to 4.3.
Thanks"
,WymanWow,2013-03-01T19:46Z,"Come on dudes, SEED please!"
,rockodss,2013-03-01T22:51Z,"Just extract part 1, it was ok for me after. Molten = Best private server. Go register on their site, and you can start in 2 mins. some regular, some x2,x5,x10,x12,x20 experience and 1 instant lvl 85 PVP server."
,bloodlust7,2013-03-02T14:20Z,Anyone know any torrent of 4.3.4 client which is full sized?.....so that i wont have to play and download rather to just download it fully from torrent.....
,twodee3,2013-03-06T00:49Z,0.0% in 40 mins. Fuck me this is S L O W
,papayrus,2013-03-06T08:01Z,Is there only supposed to be warsong in this a pvp realm. I don't see any other realms?
,ghostfriendly,2013-03-06T12:52Z,so there are 4 archives. To me they look completly the same. When i extract one the game doeasnt lounch. When i extract 4 of them into one folder same problem. What do i do?
,ghostfriendly,2013-03-06T12:54Z,or is this an update and i have to have the game?
,McLyster,2013-03-07T20:53Z,"@ghostfriendly
Just extract ANY of them (it will extract them all into 1 folder). Click WoW.exe and log in with your Molten-WoW account name"
,Mintogt,2013-03-08T04:28Z,You can only start as a level 85 character in a PVP realm which seems to be completely empty. Can you ever access the other realms and play as a level 1 character?
,Tukislav,2013-03-08T04:39Z,"@papayrus 
They will upgrade other realms too just be patient.Warsong is ""test realm""."
,brokefrombuying,2013-03-08T14:25Z,"first this torrent downloaded at an obscenely slow rate of less than 100kB/s; while everything downloads at 1mB/s; 

and now when i try to download it again, the torrent is completely empty. No files whatsoever"
,Anser117,2013-03-09T18:12Z,"Stuck at 80.4 % and showing estimated time as infinity!! :( 
for the last 6 hours its been like 1 or 2 kB/s!!"
,papayrus,2013-03-11T15:34Z,@Tukislav ok cool I got it soon all relams will be on there. One more question. If I log into the game and just leave it will it download all the rest of the content that way automatically?
,ADDOriN,2013-03-12T21:58Z,The best private server and best client. Molten-WoW at its best.
,rockodss,2013-03-15T06:31Z,"Just extract part 1, it was ok for me after. Molten = Best private server.

,Przywek,2013-03-16T00:04Z,hi i have problems with interface can someone tell me why i don't have any files there ??
,ShawnStrike,2013-03-16T10:31Z,I played it before the new patch was released and it is fun. But i had to redownload it because of the new patch and now the only realm that is showing up is Warsong and I used to play on Neltharion. Can anyone help me out please? HELP!! :(
,xxRPGxx,2013-03-18T09:31Z,"no tracker working, no seeds.
WTF
don't be selfish guys those of u who have downloaded ought to seed for others too, this aint fair"
,howdoidownload,2013-03-20T05:07Z,omg what a retard uploads torrents with archives. its a utter fail - i will delete archives as soon i unpack them to free up disk space - e.g. no seeding from me even if i want to seed it i cant afford it. + it needs like 2x disk space to unpack this shit after download.
,Mintogt,2013-03-25T22:41Z,I am not one to normally complain and this looks like it has excellent potential but I think they should have started with a realm that allows normal play - and then added a lvl85 pvp realm later on.
,ga_pilot,2013-03-29T19:36Z,Don't know what everyone else is bitching about...I'm downloading at my normal 2.1 MB/s
,ga_pilot,2013-03-29T19:37Z,"@howdoidownload

Like really man if you need to delete shit to make room for an 11gb file than you really need a new computer. FAIL"
,Mohsin09,2013-04-06T14:23Z,"is this for Molten WOW? or WOWbeez??

will this need additional patching? or will it work by just making an account on molten wow and starting? :P a newbie!

REPLY HELP "

,Shadowcog,2013-04-23T08:11Z,"Hey, So I heard about all of these private servers and stuff...and I really want a 255 server...I heard Eternal-wow was awesome, and Im about to go try it, someone should tell me about it ^^"
,Zeusknws,2013-04-24T20:30Z,"I have installed the game and its working fine. I have added a torrent of the installed game.. U can just download and directly play. NO need of anything. Just run Wow.exe

,willardnigma,2013-04-25T01:46Z,"Best server?  I have to laugh, as the torrent to be able to play on their most popular realms has how many seeders?  The above number is false.  With several trackers and DHT enables I've only found 1 seeder online.

I had to go somewhere else to download it, and upon getting in game I must say, bug city.  Oh and on the wrath realms all you hear is gearscore gearscore yawn.  I'm not saying this to advertise for another server, I'm saying this because if you don't want to run simple tank spank encounters with 10 year olds who value a 4 digit number over everything else, you might want to look elsewhere."
,regan1993,2013-05-02T01:27Z,none of the quest addons work with this one . am i missing something ?

,Kapri25,2013-05-05T12:34Z,"Molten-WoW has great WotLK.
Playing Cataclysm I suggest you use Eternal-WoW. Why? Molten seems to not have fixed the bugs out yet and most of the time unless it is late at night you have to go through a line before being able to play."
