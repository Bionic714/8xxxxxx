2. Right click on World of Warcraft, select view package content. 
3. Browse around, look for a file called World of Warcraft. The icon should be blank, and the file size should be larger then the rest.
4. On the terminal, type chmod u+x
5. Drag the file to the terminal, and press enter."

How to fix this error ?"
,mukulmehta13,2013-05-04T00:24Z,"Got it working. I confirm, it works on OS X 10.8.3.

The guys who're getting permission denied error, make the file executable first, it will work for sure.

Nice Torrent."
