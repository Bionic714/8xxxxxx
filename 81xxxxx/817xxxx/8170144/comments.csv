,dredre27,2013-02-22T22:15Z,"Oddly enough, home anal does show legit screen caps. There are porn links and maybe JavaScript crap (use sandboxie), but the image caps are there as promised. That just may be a first that link spammers can learn from ie be honest when claiming there are links there. [this coming from a parite - lol]."
,billthekiller1234,2013-02-23T11:07Z,"Great show, great upload... thanks a lot eztv"
,waldorfx,2013-02-23T20:02Z,English subtitles here: http://www.correctsubs.com/Arrow.S01E15.HDTV.x264-LOL.srt
,Pirate599,2013-02-23T21:38Z,"Great episode, nice plot so far. Storyline is intelligent and i wouldn't change it even a bit. Quality - A10 V10. I usually watch everything at film.plotar.org	because they always have HD but they don't have tv shows so having TPB for TVshows is great, thnx!"
,jonaslorik,2013-02-25T20:24Z,"For anyone considering to watch the show I would recommend it, it's very clever and well written. It gets kind of ""cheesy"" sometimes but y'know... It's on the CW Network, what can you do.

Personally I think this show is one of the pleasant surprises this year. It follows two storylines; Oliver as the ""Arrow"" fighting bad guys and his life on the island, both are very enjoyable."
,zapphb,2013-03-02T23:03Z,Thanks eztv!!
