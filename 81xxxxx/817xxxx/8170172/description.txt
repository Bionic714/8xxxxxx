NOTE I USE SUPER SEEDING for the first 2 to 4 hours so you may not see any seeds, but as long as you can send and receive to the other peers in the swarm you will get to One Hundred Percent just the same.

Super seeding sees the SEED (Me in this case) give bits out to each Peer which are unique in the Swarm.   Say for example I have 100 BITS in my torrent and 50 Peers in the Swarm.  I give you each 2 BITS which no other PEER has and then you have to file share with the other Kids in the sandbox or you wait and wait for the original seed to take pity on you.   I will not take pity with those in any swarm who do not give as they get.

This way I seed only one copy of the original between the 50 Peers instead of sending the same bits 50 times to you all.  Simple really, try it sometime.
