,CDUBBlin,2013-02-22T00:00Z,This was done on a 64 bit version of Vista and tested on windows 7 64 bit. Also worked fine on 32 bit versions of XP and vista. Drag n drop and easy to play!

I got stuck at 98% as well but just stopped it and restarted it...finished 10 minutes after.

HEY OP!

Anyway we can get this without the mods? Just vanilla GTA 4 so I can play around with it myself? Also, if I Alt+Tab I can't get back in the game. Any fix? 

Thanks!"
,shivam07,2013-02-23T15:04Z,no crack? please help with the installation!!
,shivam07,2013-02-23T16:05Z,how can i make a quick launch icon? i extracted the file to desktop but it didn't work.
,CDUBBlin,2013-02-23T18:58Z,"@shivam07 No Crack Needed here guys. Its already ready to play. Drag and drop the folder that come with download. and click the LaunchGTAIV to start the game. 
@RSVater You will have to download an orignal Vanilla version then. but vanilla is str8 boring and it will take you many many days to get this many mods working together without crashes and texture pop up problems.
@joepro8011 thnx for the help seeding

,Valamyr82,2013-02-24T20:41Z,"I'm going to give this a try. But I suggest adding links to screenshots and maybe a demo video. 

Recommanded hardware specs would be a plus as well :)"
,Valamyr82,2013-02-24T20:45Z,"I assume the various videos on youtube of ""GTA 4.5"" are this. Looks much better than vanilla for sure."
,mims906,2013-02-25T12:51Z,"I am playing for over two days now.   Despite that the game really plays easilly at high settings and it is really pretty, I have issues with the ZERO crashes... The game crashes to desktop when I get in the chopper that is above Algonquin HQ safehouse.

I really liked the upload and this is why I am replying here for any help.  I have Win7 64bit."

,AzzKikr73,2013-03-28T12:31Z,"First of all.... NO, there is no virus or tjojan in this download, so please stop bullshitting!!!

Second, if you have problem with the Brucies Missions, just download a savegame after they are done, so you wont have the bug, that the hangar-door, never goes down.  (I have played the vanilla game, so many times, I dont care to do Brucies missions again...)

Third, if you have problem with an donloaded save, for example that the game crashes, it could be that easy to fix, because if you download a savegame that does not have all the add-ons this game have, the game crashes because you have wrong car-models parked in the save-houses slots.

Just take some time to run around, and move all the cars out from the ""save-car-parking-slots"".

Save your game after each Clean-out, if the games should crash often.

Forth thing:  If you start the LCPD:RF mod, and play as a cop, the script to stop cars will alter, and after that, you will NOT BE ABLE to whisle or hail, or get into a cab, as a passenger..... This problem is not solved yet from the creator of the ""police-mod"".

That's all I had to say.... I am from Sweden, so please exuse my bad English!!
:)

Thanks again for a really grat upload!!!"
,GuitarmanX,2013-03-31T11:57Z,"Hi there, i just downloaded this torrent. I could run it but once the game started i had some HUGE LAG.
What can i do ?  i've read that GTA IV had LAG on Win 7 x64  but i guess this version has already taken care of that problem.  Should i download any patch? 
Thanks

P.D. : My PC does have the requirements.

[V],hiest,2013-04-01T06:36Z,"@ CDUBBLin

Very good work with this, please get us a fix for the crash if you are still around.

or please provide the saved file so that we can skip brucies mission.... 

I downloaded 3 different saved files, the game crashes within 30 seconds after loading the downloaded saved file, i also had a word with the staffs of gtaforums and found that the car mode is not allowing to load external saved files, the car mode is not compatible with the external/downloaded saved files .... it would be great if you could provide the saved files.

@ rayessrayess & Ruhnon

Not only the crash, there are few other bugs in this mode. few cars dies out suddenly while you drive, it just stops all of a sudden, it just stands still and does not move an inch, tried turning the engine off and on with the trainer option but nothing changes.

@ laufer

Replacing those three files in the common/data folder didn't change a thing, the game still crashes in coffee and brucie's shitty mission (Easy As Can Be)"
[V],hiest,2013-04-01T07:25Z,"Got the externally downloaded file to work with this copy. deleted the Rockstar Games folder from My Documents, started a new game to get the fresh Rockstar Games folder and placed the downloaded saved file inside and loaded it successfully.... also replaced those three files which laufer was talking about^ which did the trick to load externally downloaded save files...
The game still crashes @ coffee but who cares, i hate michelle anyway:P

Very good mode with lots of kewl features like mountain island and new cars... Thanks for this"

set waypoint then go to teleport to waypoint second to last under teleport


also to clear the f3 menu go to f4 menu, press f3 and f4 again a few times it will make it go away.


also 4 and 6 gives you other options in trainer menu.

fun stuff,  THE NEW  island is on the BOTTOM RIGHT of the main island. (the most right one on the map)"
