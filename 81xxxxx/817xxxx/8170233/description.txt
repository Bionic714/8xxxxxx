Dj Kriksta

Hello TPB users. My name is James Gallan but for my musical ventures i go by the name Dj Kriksta. I have recently uploaded my first torrent which is an original track I produced. I cant give it a specific genre as i dont feel it has one but its definitely something i am proud of which is why i took the time to create a torrent out of it to try and share it with more people. Id be happy if you took the time to check it out If not for the music at least to assure me that my mission was a success and that the torrent will function correctly. If you do enjoy the song though please leave me a comment and let me know its decent as the early stages are rough and full of uncertainty. I thank you for at least taking the time to read all or part of this and all the best to you with your own endeavors.

His torrent failed like a ship with a hole in it, it didnt seed, so i thought i would give him a hand. TPB loves to see aspiring Artist sharing their stuff with us.
