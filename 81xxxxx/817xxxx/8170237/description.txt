Calie wakes finding Violet gone and goes in search of her daughter but she will arrive in time to save her from the minions of Wonderland or will Violet become the latest flower in the flower girls twisted garden? From the same minds behind the Wonderland trilogy and the Grimm Fairy Tales series, the ongoing comic book series you've been wanting is here!
