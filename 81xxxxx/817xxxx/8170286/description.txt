"Winners and Losers"

As Frankie prepares for her upcoming 
annual tradition of watching the Oscars on 
TV, she becomes concerned when Brick 
informs her that he's taking a three-day 
school bus trip to Chicago, and she 
worries that his unique quirkiness could 
lead him to become separated from the 
group. Meanwhile, Sue wants to find out if 
Axl's friend, Darrin, has feelings for 
her.
