Valiant is proud to present Harbinger #9 from New York Times best-selling author Joshua Dysart (BPRD) and rising star Pere Perez (Smallville Season 11)! Pinned down by the forces of Project Rising Spirit, Peter Stanchek and his new team of Renegades are facing their first trial by fire and their only hope is the amazing, the indomitable, the indestructible ... Faith Herbert?!

Nothing can bring her down. She's the light in the dark. The soul of a rising resistance movement. Here now, for the first time, is the story of Zephyr (a.k.a. Faith ... but shhh don't tell anyone)! As danger closes in on all sides, Faith must begin the trials and tribulations of being the Valiant Universe's first real-life superhero. Look, up in the air! It's a bird, it's a plane ... it's frakkin' Zephyr!

On February 20th, learn the secret potential of Zephyr's powers and the truth about her time at the Harbinger Foundation - and then follow her into her battle as she vies to save the Renegades in the devastating penultimate chapter of "Renegades," only in Harbinger #9!
