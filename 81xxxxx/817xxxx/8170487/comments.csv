,bobp127001,2013-02-23T23:28Z,"duranie, may I ask how you cap a premium network such as Slice? Is this an AHDTV cap through analog hole (component) or HDMI through an HDCP stripper, or are you actually able to encode right from the transport stream? 

Thanks for all your great work :) "
[T],duranie,2013-02-25T01:21Z,"Thanks for the comments bobp127001.  Sorry I'm not comfortable chatting about such topics on a public forum.  

To everyone who's been saying 'thanks', I really appreciate the comments.   I truly HATE this show.. and every week I say to myself that 'this is the last one I will sit through'.  But people expressing gratitude is the only thing that makes me do the next episode. 

And if jchen9999 reads this, please don't write 'please upload episode 4'.  Your comments on my other RHOV uploads are annoying.  Read the CAPPER NOTES.

,jchen9999,2013-02-27T14:49Z,please upload episode 4
,fixatia,2013-02-27T16:00Z,"i miss christina too,  lala.  she was my favourite."
,fixatia,2013-02-27T16:03Z,just ignore jchen9999.  some people are born with what I like to call the asshole gene.  they just can't help it.  
,WuzzlePopple,2013-02-28T01:13Z,"thank you for the upload. i think the show is entertaining. 
if you do upload episode 4, maybe you should comment youself: ""please upload episode 5"" and beat jchen9999 to it.  
or you could comment: ""jchen999 says ""please upload episode 5"". "
