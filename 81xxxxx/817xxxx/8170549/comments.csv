Maybe you should put that in the damn text of your shitty post? like saying: 

Being.Human.UK.S05E02.RELASEGROUPSUCKS


Because you know they are into season 4 of the USA one so hey maybe it will help in the future?"
,Neon_Jackal,2013-02-24T11:34Z,"@rickruin Or maybe since it's the original it can just be called Being Human...
The US one has US in the title on torrents so there is no need to label this one as UK"
