"Bad Hair Day"

Claire flies solo to her college reunion and 
runs into a professor she once dated, but 
when Phil shows up things get really awkward. 
Back at home, Jay is obsessed with winning 
his big bowling tournament, and Gloria is 
running ragged with the baby but won't admit 
it. Mitchell offers to take baby Joe for a 
while, and Cameron seizes the opportunity to 
use him in one of his elaborate photo shoots. 
However, a wig malfunction leads to 
unfortunate results and no one wants to be 
the one to face Gloria.

18/Slower+
Evolve... or die.

Enjoy :)
