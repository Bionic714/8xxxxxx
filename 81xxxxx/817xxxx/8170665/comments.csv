,Dwch,2013-02-21T07:59Z,"Hitlist + 0-day = pretty much every new comic book release for a given week.

As far as I can tell, 0-day has the new titles which came out that week and hitlist contains new/re-releases of titles that came out prior to that week. If you check both every week, you won't miss a thing.

I check them every week and it keeps me very happy! Hitlist has been on fire lately with all these digital back-issue and TPB releases."
