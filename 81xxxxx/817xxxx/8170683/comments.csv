,pedrofell,2013-02-21T05:37Z,No. It isn't. It's pretty small to be honest
,bdog99,2013-02-21T10:09Z,its really small for a hd mkv
,ghanem.remy,2013-02-21T10:12Z,"Size doesn't matter.... 
But still it's pretty average size for 720p. 
Sometimes there're at 200Mo for 720p 
other time there're 1,5Go.
so with 900Mo it's ok."
