If you're a fan of Joe Purdy's songwriting, this album will not let you down. Some of his strongest songs are on this cd (Paris in the Morning, Brand New Set of Wings and I've Been to Holland), and until the re-release, the only place you've heard them over the last several years was at a live show! There's a great raw/live feel to the recordings of these songs (I'm no recording wiz but I'm guessing these were either recorded live or else with relatively few tracks). The effect this produces is a passionate, visceral delivery of these gems, one that begins to give you a hint of the emotion you're in for if and when you're lucky enough to see Joe Purdy live. Whiskey-soaked countrybluesfolk at its finest.
