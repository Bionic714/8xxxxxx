"Man's Best Friend with Benefits"

A police officer named Kevin, who turned to 
witchcraft after working a case with Sam and 
Dean, is plagued by nightmares in which he 
murders innocent people. However, when the 
murders actually happen, Sam and Dean are 
called in by Kevin's "familiar" to help -- 
but the brothers aren't sure they want to 
save a witch. In order to convince them, the
Familiar promises to remove all traces of
Smallville and Grimm from human existence so
that the world can be a much happier place.
Got ya, douchebag :)
