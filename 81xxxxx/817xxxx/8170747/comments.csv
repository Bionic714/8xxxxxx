[V],MP4SUX,2013-02-22T22:09Z,"Well, someone has to do it - I stopped lifelong lurking and elected ""me"" until someone 

comes along and stages a coup by doing what I do, just a little bit better. It aint hard, 

just time consuming and incredibly rewarding.

Don't believe the conventional lie - AVI is still the preferred format by about 80% of our 

little community. This is easy to prove - I took about a half hour to collect the following 

data - you can do the same. Test reality, test the lies and establish the truth you know 

you can believe in, because you figured it out for yourself. You can't do it with TV shows 

- ""The Scene"" has poisoned ""the well"" to much unneccesary consternation.. You have to 

look where people are still allowed to make up their own minds about how and what they 

do.

I excluded 480p, 720p. 1080p, Porn, TV shows (only 2 XVID and 4 x264 examples)
Because I think the fair comparison is the standard resolutions most people download.
I find that TPB here is about the finest database to search for this purpose.

Pick a reasonable time frame or use mine:
GMT 2013-02-19 00:07 to 2013-02-21 20:21 (68h14m) just short of three days (72h) .
Pick your own search terms - or use mine:
(DVDrip XVID)
(DVDrip x264-720p)
(BRrip XVID -720p -480p)
(BRrip x264 -720p -1080p)
I count the numbers and get:139 XVID movie rip postings within the selected time period.
I count the numbers and get 29 x264 movie rip postings within the selected time period.
The math is really simple: 139/(139+29) Gives a very clear 82.74% rippers prefer XVID.
.
Don't take my word for it - select your own criteria and report back or be the crusader.
