,Grizraz,2013-02-26T19:23Z,"Looks great, and it's all there, for me, except the main terminal building. I have tested with both the UT terrain, and without. Guess I'll have to wait for the inevitable update. Win8-x64 machine; might count for something to understand that. "
[T],_SnakEye,2013-02-26T19:31Z,"this is with or without the ASE online protection?
in other word, is it v1.01?
I need to know before I will upload the newer version if this is already the newer version or not."
,Grizraz,2013-02-26T23:15Z,v1.00 displayed on the installer. 
,Grizraz,2013-02-26T23:32Z,v1.00 displays on the installer.
[T],_SnakEye,2013-02-26T23:53Z,"ok thanks.
I'll Upload the v1.01 without ASE_data protection."
[T],_SnakEye,2013-02-27T15:02Z,"you can all grab the newer version here:
http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8198372/
the newer version does not require the ASE_Data online activation. "
,pierce368,2013-02-28T03:25Z,"Thanks for the update snakeye. Knew there was a  reason your name was in the readme and it wasnt on tpb lol. I was not missing any buildings though, weird. If this is a confirmed flaw with this torrent, should I remove it since the newer version is up? Still new to all this, thanks in advance."
