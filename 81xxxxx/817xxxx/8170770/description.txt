Aerosoft X for FSX. tested and working if you follow the readme. Not my rip but found on a another site.

Buy if you like, it is the right thing and also allows you to download the updates for the addons which will increase performance and fix bugs.

I run an AMD 980 system and get 30+ fps no stutters in nyc with fsdt kjfk, mtx4.5, manhattanx, utx, gex rex etc etc. All sliders to the right. So yeah the updates are pretty important.

My first torrent, hope it works out, i keep getting banned so we will see how long this lasts. Tons of more add-ons to come if TPB stops banning my ip.
