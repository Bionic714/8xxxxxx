When Bond's latest assignment goes gravely wrong and agents around
the world are exposed, MI6 is attacked forcing M to relocate the agency.
These events cause her authority and position to be challenged by
Gareth Mallory (Ralph Fiennes), the new Chairman of the Intelligence
and Security Committee. With MI6 now compromised from both inside and out,
M is left with one ally she can trust: Bond. 007 takes to the shadows -
aided only by field agent, Eve (Naomie Harris) - following a trail
to the mysterious Silva (Javier Bardem), whose lethal and hidden
motives have yet to reveal themselves.
