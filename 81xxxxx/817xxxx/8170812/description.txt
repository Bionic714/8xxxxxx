Up! Live in Chicago is the third live video album by Canadian singer Shania Twain. Directed and produced by Beth McCarthy-Miller, the concert was held and filmed on July 27, 2003 at the Hutchinson Field in the south-side of Grant Park in Chicago, Illinois; there were over 50,000 attendants. The concert itself differed from that of the Up! Tour (2003ΓÇô04), featuring divergent stages, setlits, and production. Behind-the-scenes footage was filmed during the same week, when Twain visited local landmarks and events. The concert film debuted on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) on August 19, 2003, and was watched by over 8.87 million viewers, becoming the second-most-viewed concert film on television, behind Celine Dion's A New Day... Live in Las Vegas (2003).
Due to its high television ratings, Up! Live in Chicago was released as a video album on November 18, 2003 by Mercury Nashville Records. Released both in standard DVD packaging and in a jewel case, it featured additional performances not included on the television presentation, and was received positively by music critics, who complimented Twain's interaction with the audience; however, some questioned her singing. The video peaked at number two on Billboard's Top Music Video sales chart, and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of 100,000 copies in the United States. It was also certified platinum in Australia and gold in Austria and Brazil. Excerpts from Up! Close and Personal were used as the music videos for Twain's singles "She's Not Just a Pretty Face" (2003) and "It Only Hurts when I'm Breathing" (2004).
