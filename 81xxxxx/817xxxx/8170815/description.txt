Nothing if not consistent, Endless Boogie provides more examples of its casual approach to rock music. Full House Head is a good hour-plus demonstration of its craft. Proficient at its instruments, its membership keens toward a unified front, this self-aware everyman presence that eschews virtuosity in favor of togetherness, as these four men squeeze their way through a swamp-assed tromp in the wilds of nasty blues and Southern rock. Most of their songs hover past the 8-minute mark, so that anyone just walking into the bar theyΓÇÖre playing gets more of a chance to grab a lick. ItΓÇÖs incredible background music, and when/where/why you decide to pay attention depends solely on you. And when you do, GREAT! Dip in your friendly conversation with Boz Scaggs? Zen moment in the mensΓÇÖ room, honkinΓÇÖ on bobo? TheyΓÇÖre your boys.

Endless Boogie is not high-concept, and as such, their music is easily deconstructed. ThereΓÇÖs pop songwriting ΓÇö then thereΓÇÖs these guys. ThereΓÇÖs very little build-up to get to their songs. YouΓÇÖre there. But wait! Time travel is for suckers. You want to extend your time on Earth because itΓÇÖs all you got. The triple-length jams that roll out of this forge give the illusion that everythingΓÇÖs the same, while robbing you of your time. Robbie Robertson wrote ΓÇ£you put the load right on me.ΓÇ¥ Hard rock, blues rock, psych rock ΓÇª these are obsessions, the weight of the obsessed. IΓÇÖm one of them. You might be, too. IΓÇÖm aware that huge chunks of the world slip right past my view, choosing instead to go deaf in search of the righteous vibe. Its poison is the allure. ItΓÇÖs not for everyone, but it is for some. People with lots to do wouldnΓÇÖt dig this too much.

ThereΓÇÖs no Krautrock in their approach, no attempts at minimalism or pop jockinΓÇÖ or rebranding of the form. ItΓÇÖs nothing more than riffinΓÇÖ and blue-collar soloinΓÇÖ. And you better love those riffs, because itΓÇÖs gonna take ΓÇÿem a while to resolve. Their music comes from confinement, in the garage, revvinΓÇÖ in neutral, trying to get a base high. Class and personality is not on display. The public-facing organ of Endless Boogie, Paul Major, croaks like Fred Cole doing Chris Griffin from Family Guy. He barks about grabbinΓÇÖ some ΓÇ£Mighty Fine PieΓÇ¥ and the sensible throngs drift off, as a pack of wolves up front leer like escaped cons from the foot of the stage. ItΓÇÖs dirty.

This is a band that has four full-length albums to its credit. Never has it bent or changed. Humans take a break from everyday life to do something they love, and in the case of these gents, they attempt to give back. We made ourselves this way. IΓÇÖm far from a generation that told me it was a good idea to listen to Free. I had to travel backward to get there. It took a long time. That search, that struggle is represented in the 9-minute asphalt melters and the fumes they generate. YouΓÇÖre either impressed with their single-mindedness, or youΓÇÖve stopped reading this review.

Endless Boogie uses the infinity symbol as its logo. The problem with Endless Boogie is its solution.
