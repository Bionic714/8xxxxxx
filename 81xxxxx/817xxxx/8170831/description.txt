Eric LuomaΓÇÖs wistful, sleepy tenor set mostly to downtempo tunes, the mellow mood recalling the bandΓÇÖs 2002 disc Home Late. And the similarities donΓÇÖt stop there; the likes of ΓÇ£Half LifeΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£CatalinaΓÇ¥ come off as Luoma outtakes (to be generous) or self-plagiarism (to be blunt).

On the bright side, the latter tune, an otherwise nondescript strummer, does boast a rhyming couplet so perfect itΓÇÖs hard to believe no oneΓÇÖs thought of it before: ΓÇ£YouΓÇÖre up in Minnesota/Do you have someone to hold ya/When itΓÇÖs cold?ΓÇ¥ ThereΓÇÖs also a little Jayhawks jangle (ΓÇ£This TimeΓÇ¥) and a lo-fi dose of Joe Henry faux-funk (ΓÇ£St. HelenaΓÇ¥), but in the end, such slight deviations from the norm donΓÇÖt equate to breaking new ground ΓÇö and, as another North Star song-smith said, he not busy being born is busy dying.
