"Viral"

The anguish that haunts Cruz (Joe Minoso) 
over his previous actions boils over, as he 
puts himself and his fellow firefighters in 
jeopardy. Casey (Jesse Spencer) and his 
sister Christie (guest star Nicole Forester) 
try to solve their issues with their mother 
(guest star Kathleen Quinlan) and each 
other. Meanwhile, Severide (Taylor Kinney) 
reaches out again to an important person 
from his past as a favor to Lieutenant 
Whaley (guest star Shane McRae) and the 
squad gains new perspective after assisting 
the bomb squad on an extremely dangerous 
call.
