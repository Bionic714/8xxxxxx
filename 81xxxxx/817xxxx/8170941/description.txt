Not many modern rock bands draw a line -- and dare you to cross it -- the way that Endless Boogie does. Even their name spells out provocation. It is the promise of a long time on your feet. It sets a level. And even then, itΓÇÖs still a misunderstood ideal, the one they pursue. I can only guess what other people hear when they listen to music, but IΓÇÖm sure that in stature, in precedent, and in approach, Endless Boogie creates preconceptions that have caused a lot of their potential audience to back away before a single note is finished. They must be confused. Maybe they donΓÇÖt like electric guitars in an ΓÇ£endlessΓÇ¥ context, or fear hours of some no-talent wanking away into nowhere.

But itΓÇÖs all in the presentation, and in that Endless Boogie puts up a fight. It took me several sets and a number of years before their first album, Focus Level, brought them into sharper perspective for me. One thing to know about these guys is that anything less than an 80-minute double LP doesnΓÇÖt seem to be considered an album. TheyΓÇÖve made a handful of these smaller releases, with the assistance of record/art aficionado and speculative get-doneΓÇÖr Johan Kugelberg, who somehow bestowed these records (three 12ΓÇ¥s, and a 7ΓÇ¥ called Swedish Pizza which retailed for $20 new, and may have been somehow associated with the KugeΓÇÖs HuffPo piece from last year) with instant collectability cachet. The full-lengths, though, are where Endless Boogie achieves parity with what their live experiences are like, and Long Island, their third, goes the greatest distance of any of their records in bridging that gap.
