,paladan26,2013-02-21T07:17Z,Thanks a million PurpleBeanz!  I just download the trial and had a ball with it..  Nothing better then making your family blow up with TNT!  
,Shah_Jahan,2013-02-21T07:30Z,"Thanks. I really admire your uploads. BTW, why did you include both, version 1.04 and 1.05 in this?

And does this have just the 3 free effects or more than that? Coz the description doesn't mention that specifically.

Thank you very much."
,Shah_Jahan,2013-02-21T08:04Z,"Oops! The description should have mentioned that this requires root and you need to download the effects individually (which I can't as I don't have 3G or WiFi in my area).

From Instructions.txt:
1. Download The Torrent
2. Install 1.0.4
3. Install latest freedom (requires root)
4. If in USA go into phone settings and change Time Zone to Moscow GMT +4:00
5. Open freedom and click on FXGuru and let it do it's thing
6. Then go into 1.0.4 and purchase Megapack using the Freecard
7. Now go back and download each individual effect (approx 100MB)
8. After all effects are installed. then update to 1.0.5
9. Done"

,Shah_Jahan,2013-02-21T14:17Z,"Can you kindly upload all the individual effects so that we can copy and paste all the files in a said location and make it work?

Because I don't have access to 3G or WiFi internet in my area :-(

Thank you very much."
,AlexPC7k,2013-02-21T17:21Z,So this works only on rooted phone? :(
[V],UltraTorrents,2013-02-21T18:06Z,"i think you cannot copy the effects. yes, freedom works only on rooted phones but not on all roms (eg doesn't work on miui v4) but it works on cyanogen."
