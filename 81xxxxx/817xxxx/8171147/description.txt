PBS Nova: Season 40, Episode 12 "Mind of a Rampage Killer" (February 20, 2013)

What makes a person walk into a theater or a church or a classroom full of students and open fire? What combination of circumstances compels a human being to commit the most inhuman of crimes? Can science in any way help us understand these horrific events and provide any clues as to how to prevent them in the future? As the nation tries to understand the tragic events at Newtown, NOVA correspondent Miles OΓÇÖBrien separates fact from fiction, investigating new theories that the most destructive rampage killers are driven most of all, not by the urge to kill, but the wish to die. Could suicideΓÇôand the desire to go out in a media-fueled blaze of gloryΓÇôbe the main motivation? How much can science tell us about the violent brain?  Most importantly, can we recognize dangerous minds in timeΓÇöand stop the next Newtown?
