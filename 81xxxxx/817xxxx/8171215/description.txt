These are 3D images of the Martian landscape from the University of Arizona's HiRise - High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment.


I had to split this into two torrents because of the number of files.


Part 1 - 1460 anaglyph 3D pics in .png format.
You will need the red/blue anaglyph 3D glasses to see these properly.



These are the thumbs of the full-size images, though they are 
still fairly large, varying in size from 512x262 up to 512x7610.


I could not include the originals because they are HUGE.
The first full size image is 228 Mb, the second is 118 Mb,
the third is 236 Mb and so on. They are in a special format called Jpeg2000 and require a special image viewer called HiView also
developed by UA.


I have included the HiView installer with user's guide and one full size image, the 118 Mb one, if you want to check it out.


There is also a short .pdf with some information about HiRise.


Previews.
