,Warfalcon,2013-02-21T17:24Z,"Maybe dumb question but can someone explain to me: (1) why load this file, when you anyhow need the FTB-Launcher with wich you can also simply download it directly? (2) why the hell is the .zip ~100MB when the unpacked folder downloaded via the launcher is only half that big?"
,Warfalcon,2013-02-21T18:54Z,Okay... the answer to (2) is: Cause the download contain some additional sound- & music-files.

You is my friend!!! :D :D"

So in an effort to finally get him back on my server, I uploaded the full Direwolf20 folder onto here because the file was too big for me to email it to him. :P"
