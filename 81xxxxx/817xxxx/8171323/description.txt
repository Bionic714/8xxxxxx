Why have we forgotten the question of the meaning of being?

Being and Time, written by Martin Heidegger. Originally published in German as Sein und Zeit in 1927. 

This is the Joan Stambaugh translation from 1996, as opposed to the John Macquarrie & Edward Robinson translation from 1962. If someone has the Macquarrie & Robinson translation, I would love it if you would upload that translation and leave the link here in the comments.
