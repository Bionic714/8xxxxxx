Their third and last LP, "No illusions" from the end of 1979, is thus somewhat coarser and tougher than its two predecessors. There was now a female singer for the first time in Pancake's history, in addition to some other changes in line-up. The LP contains exclusively self-written tracks. The CD edition on Garden of Delights includes six bonus tracks.
