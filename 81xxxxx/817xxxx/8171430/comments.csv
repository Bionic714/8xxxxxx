I feel they have lost a lot of credibility especially due to the fact they dropped the evidence review not to mention it seems to me that Grant quit more due to the quality of the show than anything else. Every episode now all you see is them saying ""did you hear that?"" ""Did you see that?"" The ""evidence"", when they actually show any, is vague if not completely indiscernible. The episode that particularly set me off was the first episode of season 8 when they went to King's Island in Cincinatti, OH. Being from the area I have done a lot of local research and can tell you that the explosion that killed 100+ people never happened. The company that ran that powder mill had an explosion as described but it happened in Connecticut. I emailed the gentleman from the park that was on the show and he claims there are several sources but refused to link me to any said sources."
,axprodigy1,2013-03-08T04:03Z,"Another thing about s08e01 that was missed by a lot of people is the fact that they recorded the evp of the little girl saying ""I'm looking for my mom"" yet the word ""mom"" wasnt widely used in the english language until the 1890s or so yet the little girl in question died in the 1860s. So if it were truly her, she would have said something along the lines of ""I'm looking for my mother"". This was the first episode where the team did 0 evidence research and solely took the word of the property spokesman for gospel. It set the same precedent for every episode since. I currently live 30 minutes from the Spaulding Hotel, which Jay and Grant bought after the first time they investigated it and you wouldn't believe how hard they are trying to commercialize the supernatural aspect of it. Halloween Balls etc."

According to that link I may be wrong that the 1942 explosion didn't happen but it clearly states casualties stood at 5 deaths with 11 injured. It cites the 1890 explosion that the Ghost Hunters make so much ado over as the most deadly with 11 deaths."
,axprodigy1,2013-03-08T04:18Z,"As a further self correction Missouri Jane died in 1846 not in the 1860s as I previously stated, which lends even more credence to what I already stated."
