Goodnight, Bull Creek! is the third studio album by Australian rock musician Kevin Mitchell, under his pseudonym Bob Evans. It was released through EMI on 3 April 2009. The album was recorded in Nashville, Tennessee, with producer Brad Jones (Sheryl Crowe).The title of the album comes from the Perth suburb of Bull Creek where Mitchell lived between the ages of 5 and 18. Mitchell has said using it in the title of his album "was just something that gave me a cheap thrill ... to name it in a song ("Someone So Much"). Then I took it to the next step of it being the title of the record. It made sense."

The album debuted and peaked at number 22 on the ARIA Albums Chart.
