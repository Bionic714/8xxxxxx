,dbranson17,2013-02-22T06:40Z,what's up with the seeding?  I've got 0% after the better part of a day...
,jdurdan17,2013-02-22T21:09Z,Same here. I see 102 seeders 467 peers and after a day I have less than 1 % done. 
,gra2355,2013-02-22T21:11Z,Been downloading for over a day and still 0% 
,comixscholar,2013-02-22T21:38Z,"Indeed, same issue here, and it is EXTREMELY unlike any previous shipjolly upload in this regard. "
,thecardmonster,2013-02-22T21:48Z,"Me too, no movement."
,chrys56,2013-02-23T03:13Z,"Same deal, here.

Does anyone know how to get in touch with shipjolly?  Do you think he reads these comments?"
,jdurdan17,2013-02-26T16:40Z,5 freaking days and this torrent is shit. Would be nice if the author checked back every now and then to see if it was working. Because we all know that bit torrents never go wrong:)
[T],shipjolly,2013-02-27T04:15Z,"OK, recreated it.

The whining from jdurdan  made me hesitate to do it. I must have missed the part where this is a service he is paying for and he i snot getting his moneys worth.
