Not long to go now, 3 or 4 more parts and you will have one of the best tagged and Windows file named Karaoke collections in the World today, on line anyway.  There may well be a larger, better tagged collection but I have not seen it.

Most of the Karaoke roadshows (if that is what you can call them) locally are using Winamp or other free software and downloaded rubbish with no tags and can never find the wanted files for the singers.

contains a Guide to Good Torrents,  A non technical guide to Bit torrent and a Non Technical guide to SUPER SEEDING, a method of getting large in demand files out to the swarm in record time and one I use all the time when seeding this collection for the first few hours of any torrent.

To check you have all the parts from the Pirate Bay tick AUDIO and use the Search String Karaoke collection and you will see all the Parts there.

MP3+CDG Karaoke files, over 650 songs in a single WinRAR Archive.
