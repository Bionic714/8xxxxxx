Chloe King is a normal girl. She goes to class (most of the time), fights with her mom, and crushes on a boy or two. But around her sixteenth birthday, Chloe finds that perhaps she is not so normal after all. There is the heightened night vision, the super fast reflexes oh, and the claws.

As she discovers who she is and where she comes from it is clear she is not alone. And someone is trying to get her.

Chloe has nine lives. But will nine be enough?
