      In  1982,  Sue Grafton  introduced  us  to Kinsey  Millhone.
      Thirty years  later, Kinsey is an  established international
      icon and Sue, a number-one  bestselling author. To mark this
      anniversary  year,  Sue has  given  us  stories that  reveal
      KinseyΓÇÖs origins and SueΓÇÖs past.

      Kinsey  and  Me  has  two parts:  The  nine  Kinsey  stories
      (1986-93), each a gem of  detection; and the And Me stories,
      written in the decade after Grafton's mother died. Together,
      they  show just  how much  of  Kinsey is  a distillation  of
      her  creatorΓÇÖs  past  even  as  they  reveal  a  child  who,
      free of  parental interventions, read everything  and roamed
      everywhere. But the dark side  of such freedom was that very
      parental distance.

      The same  unique voice  and witty  insights readers  fell in
      love with  in A  Is for Alibi  permeate the  Kinsey stories.
      Those in the And Me  section trace a remarkable voyage, from
      anger to understanding, from  pain to forgiveness. They take
      us into  a troubled  family, dysfunctional as  most families
      are,  each  in  their  own way,  but  GraftonΓÇÖs  telling  is
      sensitive, delicate,  and ultimately, loving.  Enriching the
      way we  see Kinsey  and know Sue,  these stories  are deeply
      affecting.
