,Freakyfairy,2013-02-22T05:57Z,"Thanx for the upload, but it gives me an error... ""Cannot open file with extension .mp3"" How do I remove it so I can listen to it through media player or vlc?"
,boondall,2013-02-23T01:20Z,Don't download. Gives error on win media player as the guy above says. Double click on a song and it takes you to a website which tries to install a program. Ran it with VLC and a message comes on that i need to download a browser attachment to play the files . HaHa yeah rite. Stay away.
,CCRLH85,2013-02-23T05:36Z,"Like boondall said, this is a fake.  If you play the files in Media Player Classic they actually have a little video saying that they won't play in your player and that you have to install a toolbar to make them work.  No chance there.  I wish the +/- voting system were still around to deal with these."

,mrpoopiepants,2013-03-05T23:57Z,I can also confirm that this torrent contains 270 Megabytes of completely unusable data. I should have read the comments before downloading. This torrent should really be expunged from TPB as spam.
