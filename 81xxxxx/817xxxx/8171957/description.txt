This is a direct rip of the show as recorded from 4HD by a Freesat box.

Original 1080i50 broadcast converted to 480p25, original AC3 stereo audio. Normally I leave videos in HD, but this show when broadcast on 4HD was actually upscaled to 1080i from a standard definition recording so there is no benefit to having a HD rip this time.

Encoded with Handbrake (High Profile @ 1500kb/s), with MKV Merge to remux.

About as close as you'll get to broadcast quality without the original TS file!

I uploaded this one because there doesn't appear to be a torrent copy anywhere else.  It's a stand-up comedy performance by Al Murray (The Pub Landlord), where he takes a humourous look back at 1997 with banter, video clips, interviews with people who were famous at the time and a live music performance at the end.  If you're an Al Murray fan you should add this to your collection.
