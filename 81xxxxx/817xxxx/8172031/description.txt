GOLDEN BOY is a drama about the meteoric rise of an ambitious cop who one day will become the youngest police commissioner in the history of New York City, and the high personal and professional cost he pays to achieve it. After only three years as a beat cop, ClarkΓÇÖs heroics on the job make him bold enough to ask for and receive the unheard-of promotion to homicide detective, angering some members of his new department who are eager to see him fail. Clark is partnered with and mentored by experienced veteran Detective Don Owen, just two years shy of retirement. Immediately, Clark comes into conflict with First Grade Detective Christian Arroyo, the alpha dog in the squad whoΓÇÖs just as ambitious as Clark, but without a moral center. ArroyoΓÇÖs partner is Detective Deborah McKenzie, a tough third-generation cop and the only female detective in the unit. Also on the team is Detective Joe Diaco, well-connected with tremendous resources which Clark might find useful. Though laser-focused on moving up the ladder, ClarkΓÇÖs soft spot is serving as the sole caregiver and supporter of his sister, Agnes, a teenager demonstrating increasingly dangerous behavior, whom Clark must serve as much a parent as a brother. Keenly observant and politically savvy, the Golden Boy often bases his career decisions solely on his need to succeed as quickly as possible, and heΓÇÖll find that his epic journey will be filled with unexpected consequences.
