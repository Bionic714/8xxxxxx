,tinycrab,2013-02-22T00:59Z,"does this version perhaps have hard coded English subs during the Russian parts? This movie is about 1/4 spoken Russian in the begining at least,and although I can guess the plot is that Bruce Willis is going somewhere to save some family member from some Bad guys, Like all the other ""Die Hards"" I still would like to know the nature of the bad guys, or some of the background info that is in Russian. Or maybe there is an .SRT file somewhere?
Thanks for the up haloReD I appreciate your efforts greatly.
Oh yeah...Spammers Die please"

,gratefulforthis,2013-02-22T23:08Z,"If you don't speak Russian then you'll be shit out of luck for the, err, Russian parts. 

Not sure why a movie, being played in English, wouldn't have the subs on the screen :/"
,gratefulforthis,2013-02-23T00:32Z,"Sorry, can't watch it.

Whoever was sitting in the cinema should have pulled the focus in. 

One of the few cams I can genuinely say is proper unwatchable. Even for the none fussy. Out of focus the whole thing.

Made it to 10 mins of proper watching. Urgh...it's 2013, man. Fucking use your cameras properly, ffs.

A: 6 (It's a cam so as you'd expect)
V: 2 (Urgh, man. Out of focus the whole lot)"

,swine666,2013-03-01T21:30Z,"I was wondering if they changed the name of the movie from what it is to ""a good day to stay at home and beat the meat"", would the story have remained the same?"
,ato080,2013-03-02T16:52Z,"NOTICE TO CAM USERS:  Turn your Auto Focus OFF.  Simply manually focus on the screen, a stationary target.  You're trying to play the part of the projector and IT WON'T WORK!  Think about it!"
