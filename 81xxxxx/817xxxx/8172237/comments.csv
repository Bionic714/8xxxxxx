Thank You!

Looking at your collection is a real treat..I'm actually excited.

Good file size too.

2G and up is much better than smaller..in file sharing..size matters.

So you may be the sort of individual whom I can request a couple of totally under-represented or even straight up non-existent 'as torrent' films:

'Shakes The Clown' which does not exist on TPB to our collective shame.

'Rolling Thunder' which does not exist in an adequate file size of 2-3 (+) Gigs.

If I could do it..I would..fact is I would love to see a way to buy films and hand them off to good artist UL'ers..I'd be happy to buy the thing if someone could do a good torrent for the 'community'..oh well..with Bitcoin being inflated by the CIA..guess its not likely..

Thanks for this..appreciate it."
