,wvactions,2013-02-21T21:38Z,Is there anyway to compress this download so that it fits on a DVD?
,jacob5800,2013-02-21T22:35Z,use a dobble layer disc easy
,wvactions,2013-02-22T05:47Z,"I apologize, I should have been clearer. Is there a way to compress this download to an ISO or other format that fits on a single layer DVD?"
,IamGandalf,2013-02-22T07:57Z,"Its portable, get a USB/FLASH drive, then it can be updated and it runs faster than DVD

IF you compress it (win rar best compression) the size is 5.5GB and that gives nothing.

Alternativ, compress with 2 files of 3GB and burn on 2 dvds"
,IamGandalf,2013-02-22T11:00Z,"You CAN copy this and delete half the driveres on one dvd and the rest on the other dvd...

But then the idea is gone :o)"
,wvactions,2013-02-25T02:32Z,"Thank you for your responses! I have a few relatives that don't have internet that I would like to send a DVD with this download to. Flash drives would be too costly. Is it possible to remove the driver packs that are labeled ""notebook"" since they all have desktop PCs? Sorry for my ignorance. "
,IamGandalf,2013-02-25T09:32Z,Yes. Delete packs will work.
,FriendlyF,2013-03-01T22:29Z,Just used this. It installed two drivers and updated 15 more. It told me a restart was required. Now Windows won't load. Please tell me this did not just fuck up my desktop.
,FriendlyF,2013-03-01T22:35Z,Was my comment deleted because I mentioned this program made Windows unable to boot?
,FriendlyF,2013-03-01T22:36Z,"No, turns out I was going insane. Oh well. Windows, please come back :("
