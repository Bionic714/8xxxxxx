,M4v0,2013-02-21T16:13Z,AVG 2012 - game clean and works
,EightBitRanger,2013-02-21T17:31Z,"I'm disappointed to see someone has torrented a small-developer indie game. Its still in Alpha but it was worth my $30 so far and its nowhere near done yet. If you enjoy it, buy it. This is the kind of shit you'd expect for an EA or Ubisoft game with DRM."
,Whickerx7,2013-02-21T18:20Z,@EightBitRanger you act like every one can afford $30 it dont seem like much but when your living paycheck to paycheck and barely able to keep your internet on $30 can feel like a lot the makers of anodyne understand
,MadRevolver,2013-02-21T19:33Z,"Thanks for the upload! I will test it later!
@EightBitRanger: Think of it as a butterfly effect. If you remove torrents from the internet, the technology will go back at least 20 years and there will be no 300+ million $ for introversion, there will be no prison architect + +...+. Accept, understand it, hug it and let's move forward."
,blint126,2013-02-21T19:36Z,it's not like i haven't bought lots of games after trying them out this way...
,MadRevolver,2013-02-21T19:38Z,sorry...ment thousands $
,MadRevolver,2013-02-21T22:08Z,"game works fine. I like the changes and I build a prison for all of you as we speak. I will try luxury cells with computer desks :D And yes guys...we buy a game to support the developers also and not only to play a game. I'm pretty sure all people when they have the money and they enjoy a game, they buy it."

,Russian_AK88,2013-02-23T05:12Z,every version of this game above alpha 2 crashes on me while loading up and ive tried every fix i can find. this is quite irritating. 
,k3lt,2013-02-23T15:19Z,"You must be out of your mind to pay $30 for Indie game, thanks tpb."
,sati777,2013-02-27T03:14Z,"@Eightbitranger The developers stated on their last video, that more than 30,000 ppl bought the alpha, thats almost 1mio revenue, thats enough for an alpha and they will earn even more when full version gets released"
,infern4l,2013-03-08T01:34Z,"@EightBitRanger cry about it bozo. all of introversion's games are good, but theyve only made 3, and this one isnt even out yet. This game has been in the works insanely forever and it took this goddamn long even to make alpha, I'm not going to pay 30+$ for a game that may never even be finished, and stands the highest chance so far of being a buggy/uninteresting shitcake of the 3 (now 4) games they've developed. Think about it, they made the only real game about being a hacker (their best by far), a game about a digital ecosystem (second best), and a game about murdering the world with nuclear weapons (cool in concept, but unfun and buggy at rls),  and now... a fucking tycoon game??

Not to bother the fact that this game concept has been made over and over again by a hundred budget feces-merchants over the years (search ""prison tycoon""), and is by far the least creative concept which introversion has ever attempted, reading about it, this doesn't even look to be the best one!

Now granted, its not done, and could get a lot better before it even reaches final alpha. Also, there has never really been a definitive prison tycoon game, all of them have decent features, but the only stable ones are poorly drawn 2d ones that aren't fun (if one of them had been made with decent art it could have been the best), and the only fun ones are the least annoying 3d ones which aren't stable to play for long. So it wouldnt be hard for a company with the design savvy of intro to beat the crowd. But thats exactly why I cant see paying for this without downloading it first, THERES A CROWD.

With every game intro has made in the past, even defcon, the worst, its been the first of its kind, with nothing to really compare it to. So its fun at least for the novelty, and worth paying 10-15$ for the few hours it takes to get bored of (excepting uplink, which is good for hundreds of hours, despite the fact there are only 10 unique missions, all of which are short, and others are all cut from one of 20 templates), but this game has no demo, may never be released and is the exact same concept that no big company will touch because its a cheesy check that budget crap pushers keep on cashing.

This is why I'm glad for torrents"
