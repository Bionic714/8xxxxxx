James Bond Gadgets
His movies are legendary, his women breathtaking and with his sharp suits and cutting edge toys, he is dressed to kill. Whether James Bond is pursuing villains in space-age flying machines or neatly evading danger with high-tech marvels, British Secret Agent 007 is licensed to carry the most stunningly intelligent devices ever to grace the silver screen. Bond had it all.
This exclusive look at his Gadgets reveals what it really takes to save the world.

The gadgets disc was previously available and isn't really entitled James Bond gadgets but Modern Marvels. It's a good enough look at some gadgets and vehicles featured in the Bond movies, but worth having though if you are a Bond fan.
