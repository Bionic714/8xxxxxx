Thx man !."
[V],murphy78,2013-02-22T10:30Z,"There are occasional reports of people having issues with this activator. It is likely the newer obfuscation used in the file hiding stuff. Feel free to use an older version if it doesn't work for you for any reason.

On the positive side, I spotted the kms-host thread up again... no idea what is going on over there. maybe the mods are debating the thread."
,4suvo,2013-02-23T18:46Z,thanx bro..it worked fine...
,_viruzz_,2013-02-24T03:56Z,"worked great! thanks murphy78
. by the way, this ( KMSpico v3.2 )  re-active windows 8 after the expiration date provided? like KMSnano ?"
[V],murphy78,2013-02-26T02:20Z,"When you install with his installer, it should schedule daily re-activation.

Guys heldigard has released 3.3 and 4.0, so if you are having an issue with this version, try getting newer ones or just using MTK 2.4.1

This program is very similar to AutoKMS option from MTK 2.4.1 except that it converts retail to VL on office and windows and has some slightly different handling methods.

It also boasts the awesome file randomizing, but heuristics would probably jump all over that behavior.

I'm going to stop uploading these so often as I have other things to work on, but you guys can check around on mydigitallife.info, usually in the windows 8 area for heldigard's stuff. I've asked that he start his own thread there for people like me and you to discuss things, but at the very least you can follow the links in the tools v3.0 thread to download 3.3 and 4.0 if you want.

/salute heldigard, very good job on all of these activation things."
,MyndeX13,2013-03-01T10:10Z,"Hi, murphy78.
I wanted to ask about this activation before i try using it, because earlier i had some problems by activating windows through KMS. There was an error in windows update and later my pc send Hard drive disk error, there was something wrong with activation too, i have used all my three computers connection on HomeGroup.

Do i need to be offline when this activator tries to activate windows?
This only activates from my computer and do not connect to any online KMS servers?
I want to use it to activate windows 8, so will I be able to download windows updates? I saw that you recommended to hide security updates, so i should hide only those windows updates who have ""Security"" word in it? I knew that there was KB970133 on windows 7 which checked windows 7 for genuine. Do you know any update which is checking for activation on windows 8?

Waiting for your answers :)"
,cjmcder,2013-03-01T10:42Z,"you are my fucking hero, i tried like a thousand activators and this was the only one that worked. For some reason it said warning primary shields failing like 10 times but it did work so im happy."
