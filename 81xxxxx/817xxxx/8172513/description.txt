KMSpico is an Offline KMS Activator that emulates a KMS server in the memory of
your computer and sends activation data back and forth attempting to activate
volume versions of Windows and Office. Heldigard has built on CODYQX4's
amazing work from MS Toolkit 2.4 where mikmik38 and CODYQX4 made an emulated
KMS activation program without the use of a Virtual Machine.

KMSnano was GREAT. KMSpico is even BETTER, SMALLER, FASTER.
You should always check for the latest version before using.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Activates:
Windows Vista Business/Enterprise Default/N/VL
Windows 7 Pro/Enterprise Default/N/VL
Windows 8 Pro/Enterprise Default/N/VL
Windows Server Std/Data 2008/2008R2/2012
Office/OfficeVL 2010/2013.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------Please read this non-KMS Windows versions list-------
Retail-Only Versions of windows that will **NOT** activate are:
Vista Starter/Homebasic/Homepremium/Ultimate - Default/N/E
7 Starter/Homebasic/Homepremium/Ultimate - Default/N/E
8 core/coreN/ProWMC*
----------Again, those versions will NEVER support KMS activation---
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Core, ProWMC, and WServer support is in this, but it resets to
30 day renewable activation since they don't natively support KMS.
This, and the new low activation time, are the reason for daily re-activation.

Requirements: . NET 4.0 or Windows 8

Instructions:
1. Extract the zip file or run the associated exe from file explorer.
2. Run the KMSpico_Install_v3.2.exe setup file.
3. The activation takes about 8 seconds
(It takes longer for Retail to VL Office or Windows conversions)
4. Done. Go about your business.

-For Windows 8, it can take a minute or two of doing system things for the
watermark to go away. You don't need to reboot. Activators that require
a reboot are hacks and you should immediately run a "SFC /SCANNOW" if
you have used one. (SFC is the System File Checker) Esp. KJ Hacktivator
You CAN reboot if you want to, it's just not necessary for activation.

Note that Pre-Release versions of Office or Windows will NEVER activate.
I highly recommend just getting a proper release. I have tons of them.

Why use this program over any other activation method?
-It does not modify any of your system files.
-Because it's not a crack or a hack.
-Because it's the only way to get legit activation without using legit servers.
-Did I mention it activates ALL KMS activation software?

Change Log:
- Random Generation of KMSELDI file and KMSEmulator file to avoid any detection.
- Fixed task of v3.1

All is Done (for now).

Recommendations:

- Disable SmartScreen.
- Disable Microsoft Security Updates.
- Make exceptions to KMSpico folder in Antivirus.

This version has a different Scheduled task name from many KMSnano and KMSpico
releases. Make sure you correctly remove previous versions before installing
this. The installer also lists 3.1 in the registry. I think heldigard made
a quick fix to 3.1 before upping 3.2, so just ignore the different version.

I have included 2 scripts, Re-Schedule-Trigger.cmd, and verysilent.cmd.
If you don't want activation to run every time you log on, you can copy these
to the KMSpico directory in your Program Files after installing. Then just
run Re-Schedule-Trigger.cmd as admin by right clicking on it and selecting
run as administrator. This will delete the onlogon task for activating
every single logon and change it to only activate when below 21 days left
on your activation. It will save about 6 seconds of computing time every
boot, but it's not that necessary at all.

I don't know what's in the cards in the future for KMSpico or the great
heldigard. They closed our beloved KMS-Host and tools thread. Perhaps they wanted
everyone to use CODYQX4's official tool. CODY has dropped all retail to VL
conversion support, so people either need to man-up and stop installing non-VL
operating systems if they want 180 day activations, or they need to manually
convert them with the conversion scripts. I guess you could use this activator
as well, but it's easier to just get a VL OS and Office version in the first
place.

For once, I feel like this might be the end of the road for this activator.
There's always something else to fix or do, but functionally there's not much
else to do, and nowhere to talk about it anymore.

If you want a better solution than this fine activator, go buy Windows. There
really isn't much you can do beyond what heldigard has done in this release to
help hide the activator from whiny anti-virus program false-positives.
If you are trying to integrate the installer you have your work cut out for you.
heldigard has released an oem folder version of it, but it hangs on the task
creation. That leaves you with possibly scheduling it to install using runonce.
This can be quite a shock for people as it has sci-fi sound effects.
IMO it's worth it because of all the hard work heldigard did with the file
randomization, but it's just my opinion.  You could also try a sc stop audiosrv
script combined with runonce, but it might make people just as concerned.
If you do attempt that remember to sc start audiosrv after :P

(Big Salute to heldigard. Excellent work on the file randomizers)
