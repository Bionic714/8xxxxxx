Im having problem using the KMSpico 3.2 to activate Office13. Can you tell me step by step?

I'm using Win7 Pro N. Thanks.

twix, I think 3.2 had an issue with win7 activation, you can try 3.3 or 4.0. I haven't uploaded them, but there are links in the KMS-Host and Tools v3.0 thread on mdl.

If you just want to activate office but use windows loader for win7 activation (I'd recommend) I would suggest getting Microsoft Toolkit 2.4.1 or later. It has an AutoKMS that will run every time you boot and re-activate your office to it's 180 day KMS period. It takes only a couple seconds every time you boot.

You can also find the latest MTK on MDL. I have upped a mirror torrent, but note that the text files aren't that user-friendly. CODYQX4 still has a way to go to make things more intelligible to the masses."

,FoIM,2013-05-24T11:35Z,"I had strange experience when trying to install Office 2013 on Win 7 Pro. With clean install of Office 2013 the activator KMSpico didn't work. However, if I first install Office 2010 (activated with mini-KMS) and then upgrade to Office 2013 then KMSpico can activate 2013 version. "
