,neilzzz01,2013-02-21T23:00Z,Thanks a Lot Buddy^^
,thostby,2013-02-22T01:00Z,"can you install office 2013 from office 2007?
Or do I have to uninstall 2007 first?

Thanks for up!"
[V],murphy78,2013-02-22T02:38Z,"2007, geez. Yes I would definitely recommend fully uninstalling any previous versions of office before using 2013."
,Halloweenpsycho,2013-02-22T03:37Z,"@murphy78 nice up :)
As for the office 2007 i am unsure, but i had a guy comment on one of my torrents that he was successful in updating from office 2010..hope this  helps :)"
[V],murphy78,2013-02-22T05:45Z,"Yah they can co-exist, but activators sometimes don't support the way they detect them co-existing. For example, codyqx4's toolkit doesn't detect office 2010 sometimes if you have 2013 installed. I think it has something to do with either their registry keys or setup info that is in the registry."
,cselva007,2013-02-22T06:11Z,does it work for 32 bit Win 7 ? or must i download both x86 and x64 
,thostby,2013-02-22T11:22Z,No problem installing 2013 when you have 2007. Start the setup and select the upgrade button :)
,ReconVirus,2013-02-24T06:51Z,Is this the full activation version?
,delleonb,2013-02-25T01:18Z,"I installed it, and I'm confused on how to open it and actually use microsoft word through office, I can't seem to find the file ?? help asap !"
[V],murphy78,2013-02-27T03:08Z,"delleonb, office 2013 puts shortcuts for everything on your start menu. You can copy them wherever you want. If you use win8, you can right click them and open location, then open desktop and copy the lnk files for the progs you want. For win7 you could prolly just right click and drag them from the start menu.

recon, read my notes about activation in the description. You have to use a kms activator. There is no retail office activation and never will be unless you buy it.

cselva007, no. You should use 32-bit version on a 32-bit OS and 64-bit on a 64-bit OS. You could technically use a 32-bit version on a 64-bit OS, but there's not really any speed increase, so there's no reason to."
,Corleone-Hacker,2013-02-27T10:38Z,"what version of this ms office pro plus 2013 have?

,mattwaves,2013-03-02T21:41Z,Thx for the up Murph.  I have installed no problems. It runs perfect. Do I need to extract the zip file and do anything further?
,deathstalker82,2013-03-03T01:05Z,first off thanks for putting this up. second i installed the kmspico and now i am stuck. when i click on the office icon it wants me to burn a disc. i did read all the directions included with the program. i'm just not that good with this stuff. thank you in advance for any help that you can give.
,iiijjjiii,2013-03-03T03:33Z,"OK, download complete. Thanks a million murphy78.
Now for the installation, fingers crossed !!~!!"
,iiijjjiii,2013-03-03T05:35Z,"SWEET !!!!
Thanks again for the up mate :)"
,tryit12,2013-03-04T00:17Z,"Question:
Under account tab in word it says ""activation required."" Did I miss something or is that expected? Will I be able to use the skydrive upload option if it's not fully activated? 

I keep getting a message saying fonts cant be downloaded because I'm low on memory or disk space. . which isn't the case. Maybe a glitch? 

Besides all that, it seems to be working just fine. Thanks for the upload!"
,Skeptik285,2013-03-04T18:30Z,Is it safe to login with microsoft account and use it with skydrive and stuff? thx
,LifeHunter,2013-03-08T15:53Z,"Thanks for your hard work murphy78. Appreciate it!

But could you please put both x86 and x64 Office into one AIO iso file? Just like you put Windows installations in single iso file...

Thanks again! ;)"
,Alien119,2013-03-13T04:48Z,Great upload mate everything went great !
