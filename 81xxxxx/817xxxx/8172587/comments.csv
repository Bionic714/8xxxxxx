[T],webmodelsindex,2013-02-21T22:01Z,"Yeah, but it was only released in 3 theaters. They could have been backwater redneck towns where the residents couldn't afford to wear shoes, and lived in broken down trailers."

,snowbirds,2013-02-21T22:04Z,"The tagline should read:

A Dark Truth, where unpopular actors go to die...."
,Tanlic,2013-02-22T01:52Z,"It was only released in Hobbiton, which is a town in the Shire Middle Earth. Unfortunately the only person tall enough to see over the seats in front of them in the cinema is Gandalf and he was on holiday when it was released

Stars Forest Whitaker and Andy Garcia and not a hobbit in sight.........gotta be good"
,zambala,2013-02-22T10:24Z,"$630 ?  Ouch!

That's a few families that would have lost a lot of money.

I can understand though how wage slaves would laugh and feel smug about that though. I guess it offers a consolation for their own crappy ""9 to 5"" existence."
,zambala,2013-02-22T10:27Z,"..to be fair though

It hasn't stopped me downloading the movie though and watching it at what seems like a very reasonable price..."
,snowbirds,2013-02-22T23:55Z,"I don't watch movies with Andy Garcia in them anymore.  Have you ever noticed how he doesn't actually act?  

His entire acting range consists of him occasionally squinting his eyes a little bit.  Otherwise the man's face is frozen."

,ChasUGC,2013-04-22T07:58Z,"A=10 V=10 M=8 . A very good movie about courage, integrity, and truth. In this country it doesn't surprise me that it did so poorly. Those values seem to have diminished, unfortunately.

Now its all about money, power, success and greed. Humanity is totally loss. Thanks for the illustration that this movie brings back to humanity. Maybe its not all a loss. Thanks uploader, great movie."
,ChasUGC,2013-04-22T08:01Z,"on an after thought, it does need subs for the spanish dialogue."
,riccogrosse,2013-05-15T23:58Z,I totally agree with ChasUGC! A great movie...
