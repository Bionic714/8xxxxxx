Banned Documentary About The Murder Of Princess Diana 

This film, which has been banned in the UK, exposes the blatant cover up of the murder of Princess Diana and Dodi Fayed. Presented by actor Keith Allen, Real questions are asked about that fateful day in 1997 and once again all of the so called 'evidence' put forward by the 'official' version and conclusion of events, is torn apart, just like 9/11, 7/7, Pearl Harbour and a whole host of other false flag operations perpetrated on the population by those in high places. 

This documentary keeps getting removed from public access so watch it while you can. Says something doesn't it?! No guilt to be found here!
