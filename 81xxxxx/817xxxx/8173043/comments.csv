,KevinCostner,2013-02-24T17:05Z,"If it's a dvd rip, why in the hell can't you rip this title and include sub titles?  There are many non-English speaking parts in this movie and you can't understand what's going on."
,zeneeth,2013-02-24T21:50Z,Great share! Thanks.
,doc_the_one,2013-02-25T13:51Z,Thanks.. Awesome film..I love India
,billysbragg,2013-02-25T15:36Z,"Thanks, however I did find the picture a bit choppy/jumpy.
A bit below DVDRip quality for me & yeah need to find subs elsewhere.

English Subtitle for this DVDrip:

It's for the entire movie though."

,Tallyortoby,2013-03-01T12:29Z,Thanks and MQ's subs work perfectly... just need to rename them by removing the AC3 in it
,cardgum,2013-03-05T18:26Z,"The picture quality is good, but it is indeed choppy, feels like playing a low framerate video game. I would not recommend anyone to download this, it hurts the eyes."
,donbassmandem,2013-03-11T10:10Z,"Great film and much smaller than a lot of the others available.  Thank you juggs99.

Perfect. Keep up the fantastic work. Long live TPB. Long live free stuff!!"
,MathsHenr,2013-04-07T01:04Z,You guys really recommend that? The framerate is shitty.
,DarkerAngel,2013-04-15T06:42Z,"@Maths: Are you serious?
You do know what the normal film frame rate is? 24fps (merely 24 ms faster than this.)

Standard NTSC frame rate is exactly what this is encoded in and it is completely normal for most video formats.

Maybe you should learn more about video production/conversions/rendering before making comments that make you look silly.

Now the bitrate on the other hand is pretty low, but that's for drive space/bandwidth conservation. If wasn't completely concerned for space I would be looking for BDRips anyways."
