,datwerd,2013-02-22T07:22Z,"please don't stop sharing, I really appreciate your uploads.

Especially the ones no one else has shared.

Keep up the good work!"
,studentofmonth,2013-02-22T13:27Z,"First of all, thanks!

Second of all, your sh1t is greatly appreciated, particularly by this pirate. Sorry that I don't often comment.

While I don't say ""thanks"" enough, I do show my gratitude by faithfully seeding. Hope and trust that other silent parties are doing likewise."
