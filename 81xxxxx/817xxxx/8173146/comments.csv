,Jony1337,2013-02-26T03:04Z,"Thanks for the upload. Is asking internet access, and when I access it asks for a registration code.


Where do I find this code?"
,Jony1337,2013-02-26T15:09Z,"Good morning, I guess I was not very clear in my last post so I'll make this more complete.

I downloaded the update, installed it and then used the crack that came in the folder
and when I enter the game he asked for internet access at the time was no connection, then have disabled automatic updates, tried again and nothing.

now with access to the internet the game asked for a code and cut the startup game, after clicking play.

This system is in the folder (Thesims3/Game/Bin/Packs/TS3)

I'm not a beginner in this matter, I downloaded and played HAWX 2 uploaded by you.

Thanks to all and thank you google translator."

Still keeping my fingers crossed, but this seems to have fixed the incrementally lengthy ""hickups"" I was having with 1.48. So far, so smooth. "
