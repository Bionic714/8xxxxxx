,mansonfamily,2013-02-21T18:52Z,"@RMJ113

you always make stupid comments"
,ijam_j,2013-02-21T19:00Z,"@mansonfamily 

Agreed."
,darkgamerX,2013-02-21T19:01Z,"Thanks Hero. This is a pretty decent benchmarking tool. On the large zombies section I got 19 frames per second LOL. overall I got an S rank with a score of 8074 with the message (the game works exceptionally well,even at higher resolutions) 1080p everything maxed including the AA. I was hoping the benchmark would have 2 settings like RE5 bench that took actual gameplay into account, but I guess not.....this is more like a stress test"

,darkgamerX,2013-02-21T23:15Z,turning off motion blur increases your score..........

This is not a game, this is just test to see how will your pc handle the game when it comes out.

You can not play this."

Really hearing the fan working to keep the temperature stable.  The scenes were not very smooth.  Obviously going to have to play on Medium if I don't want to over heat after extensive playing times. =(
