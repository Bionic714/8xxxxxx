There are and never have been ANY passwords on ANY of my torrents. Your problem is one of the following:

1.  UAC is blocking the installer from opening.
2. You don't have elevated privledges to install software (Administrator).
3. The torrent was corrupted during the download.

Please check for the 3 above possibilities before posting on any torrent comments that it's P/W protected.
P/W protected torrents are removed by TPB staff the minute they're identified. False claims will stop users from downloading perfectly good torrents, the torrent then dies which then makes it unavailable to all. 

Regards and Respect,
