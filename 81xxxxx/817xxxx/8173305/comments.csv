,CollectorMan223,2013-05-14T02:27Z,curlyfri666 try a fresh install and reboot if that dont work find another version of gta on the bay that is compatible with ur device and just use the 100% save file if u want. I do know that not all devices are compatible with gta vc I‘ve only tested asus and moto devices. asus works flawlessly with this version but Motorola not so much
