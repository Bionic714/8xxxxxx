,peachpuppy,2013-02-21T18:53Z,I just wanted to comment that this movie is amazing. But it's not for people who expect instant mindblasting horror. You gotta have patience and also some understanding on how horrific this idea actually is concidering we ARE destroying this planet.

,udumazz,2013-02-25T09:48Z,"Peachpuppy, your stupid. Only thing being destroyed are minds, objective thought and the ability to tell movie from real life.

Thanks for the upload scene!"
,tfarwiha,2013-02-27T14:06Z,"Thnx to the uploader! Movie was OK as i expected it to be! Storyline is intelligent and entertaining and acters were OK! I usually watch all the movies at film.raeshashop.com because they have HD's but they didn't have this one so im happy to have piratebay :) Good torrent quality - A9 V9,"
,Trake0425,2013-02-28T20:35Z,"I find it funny when one insults someones intelligence but can't figure out the difference between your and you're.  Oh and we are destroying the planet, a monkey could figure that out. "
,EmKeL,2013-02-28T22:44Z,"I think this movie is awesome..it's horrifying to think something like this could happen and does happen...most of the time it's at the bottom of the news "" 64 people died from a bacteria""..blah blah blah..but no one cares!! This movie is the SHIT!!"
,JamsBand,2013-03-04T03:46Z,"Whether we are destroying the planet or not I find it absurd that anyone could consider this movie for anything other than complete stupidity.
It make me infuriated that the director and writer put such rubbish out there for cause and effect of the outbreak and just completely unbelievable as to real medicine and how to deal with it. 
I only comment here because I see a few comments from people that actually liked this movie. It is not the least bit plausible and the acting was some of the worst I've seen in a movie.
If you are going to fall for the ""man is destroying the planet"" at least back it up with a plausible movie not this pure trash."
,Nebuman,2013-04-11T06:43Z,Why is it that everyone seems to be a professional film critic? Yet no one comments on what we all really want to know - what is the quality of the dl?
,hisgirl5101124,2013-04-13T20:13Z,nebuman you read my mind i still have no damn clue what the video looks like wtf!
,u2att,2013-05-11T23:22Z,Sweet  thanx
