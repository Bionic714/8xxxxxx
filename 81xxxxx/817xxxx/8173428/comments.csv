He has about 5 or 6 releases.
Thank you,
Weston 0175"

Thank you, thank you thank you!!"
[V],TorrentTracts,2013-02-22T14:23Z,"iDivine, there's 10 titles here and I ""think"" I'm missing three more.  Wish I had a complete collection for ya.  But I didn't even know I had any Terry MacAlmon in my collection until you asked me for it.  :)"
,blaheiei,2013-02-22T16:19Z,"Hey TorrentTracts. Thanks for being faithful and uploading as always! 
Could you possibly update a discography for Hillsong, Matt Redman (His new album), and Will Reagan (His new album)? I'd appreciate it!"
[V],TorrentTracts,2013-02-23T21:18Z,"blaheiei, please do a search here on The Pirate Bay, using HILLSONG as your search criteria, and then go to the second page.  There you will see that I already have torrented a bunch of different hillsong torrents.  One for Hillsong United, Hillsong Kids, Hillsong Ukraine, etc.  11 of them in total, as a matter of fact."

All of the music that you upload just gives me a closer touch with home and I do not have to listen to the same music because it is digital and not cassette, if you know what I mean."
