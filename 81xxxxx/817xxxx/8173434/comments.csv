Your rips are of excellent quality, and I'd highly recommend them, however this one has a problem for all Side A with high frequency distortion on 'S' and 'T' consonants, and some high hat activity.
It is still there a little on Side B, but seems that something might have been stuck on the pickup causing a problem, or perhaps the tracks have been cut by a worn stylus? 
It is testament, however, to your excellent setup that they still have a world more image and clarity and depth despite the above mentioned problems. 
Thanks HEAPS!"
