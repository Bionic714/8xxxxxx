Charlotte Nicholls can hardly believe it, but it seems sheΓÇÖs landed in paradise. Living in a cottage in a shady cove on the beautiful Bay of Islands, surrounded by the splendor of New Zealand, Charlotte revels in her new life. She and her nearly four-year-old daughter, Chloe, have started over, with the help of CharlotteΓÇÖs birth mother, Anna, who has recently reentered CharlotteΓÇÖs life after a twenty-six-year absence. Little Chloe is thriving in her new home, and despite lingering effects from a terrible trauma Chloe has suffered, Charlotte is hopeful that love will pull her through. And though their relationship is tentative, Charlotte and Anna are slowly rebuilding their trust after nearly a lifetime apart.


But the horrors of the pastΓÇöboth recent and long buriedΓÇöare never far from CharlotteΓÇÖs mind. And then their idyll is suddenly shattered, as a series of events is set in motion that Charlotte can neither control nor comprehend. It will take all of CharlotteΓÇÖs strength to keep her little family together, in the face of a world that will do everything it can to tear them apart.
