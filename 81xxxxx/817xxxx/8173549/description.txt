Plot: Two women who meet by chance make a pact to fix their unhappy lives: they will each do what the other one says. But one of them has a secret. She knows her husband is sleeping with the younger woman. Madelynâ™s plan backfires when Lucy, an aspiring actress, orders her to play King Lear in a very amateur production, with Lucy playing the Fool. Madelynâ™s life is transformed in unexpected ways as, like Lear, she struggles with matters of mortality and betrayal, loyalty and love.
