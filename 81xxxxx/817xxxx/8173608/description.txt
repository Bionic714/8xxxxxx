Jimmys Winnin Matches GAA [RTE Ireland] HQ PDTV x264 AC3 DeViL303

Donegal fans still high on the success of last year’s All-Ireland title can relive it one more time by tuning into ‘Jimmy’s Winnin’ Matches’ on RTE One tonight. Here’s a taste of what you can expect.

It seems like longer than three months since Donegal confounded the critics and conquered all-comers en route to one of the most comprehensive All-Ireland successes in recent years and although they celebrated long and hard in the hills afterwards, there won’t be many who will miss a documentary charting the path to glory of the Tír Chonaill men on RTE One tonight.

The documentary features unseen behind the scenes footage with the team, match highlights and interviews with players, GAA managers, sports journalists and pundits and also includes a nod to the song that inspired the title and garnered 1.3 million YouTube hits, Rory Gallagher’s ‘Jimmy’s Winning Matches’.

Mayo fans mightn’t be too fond of having another look at the teaser clip above – it’s basically slow motion footage of the start of last year’s showpiece – but if the documentary makers can do justice to what was an amazing year for the men in green and gold then it should be well worth a watch.
