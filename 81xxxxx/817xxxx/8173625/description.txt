.NET Framework Obfuscator
DevExtras .NET Obfuscator is a simple yet advanced obfuscation
tool for the .NET framework.

What is Obfuscation?
Obfuscation protects your intellectual property by making it
incredibly difficult for others to reverse-engineer your
software. By its very nature .NET applications are very easily
decompiled.

None-obfuscated .NET applications can be compared to an
unlocked car with the keys left in the ignition. If someone
wants to steal it, it's pretty easy for them to do so.

Obfuscated .NET applications are more comparable to a locked
car that's kept in a high security car park. It could still be
stolen but it would take a considerable amount of time, skill
and effort to do so.

Why DevExtras .NET Obfusasm?
DevExtras .NET Obfuscator allows you to protect your assemblies
by using a variety of advanced obfuscation techniques and is
very easy to integrate into your release process. The
assemblies are obfuscated after compilation as part of the
build process so your development process is completely
unaffected. Assemblies can be obfuscated either via the GUI or
the command line.
