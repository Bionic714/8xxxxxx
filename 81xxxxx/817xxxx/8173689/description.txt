Zelia Barbosa sings these protest songs of the early sixties with a depth of feeling both sorrowful and evocative - unlike other interpretations, including those by the artists that wrote them. The recording is not overproduced, which only adds to the sense of the music being 'real', not a producer's dream of how to sell hits. Drums crash and guitar strums as Barbosa moodily evokes the suffering of down and out people, and though there are brighter songs, the dark tone pervades most of the album. If you're looking for early bossa music that steers clear of the cheesy arrangements and fey vocalising, this album is for you.
