,Benny2100,2013-03-24T07:08Z,"WHY THE HELL IS IT CENSORED?!?! Is the actual BluRay available in physical retail censored? I'd be so guttered if I bought it, got home and played it only to find out it's censored... FUCK CENSORSHIP!

Anyway, A/V 1O/10!

Archer is one of, if not THE, greatest animated TV shows of all time!

Thanks BC!"
