River Monsters Series 3
Jeremy Wade, biologist and extreme angler, is back with more investigations into the murky world of fishermen s tales. Jeremy investigates tales of frighteningly large and dangerous river monsters that have attacked and even killed humans. In this season, Wade catches the most bizarre and dangerous underwater creatures to inhabit earth, including a monster responsible for devouring certain male body parts in Papua New Guinea, and packs of eels that will rip the flesh from unfortunate swimmers. Jeremy s search for the truth takes him on a dark and dangerous journey across the globe to reveal that the truth is every bit as unbelievable as the myth.
"Perhaps my favorite part about River Monsters is that the program is entirely aware of the dangers that exist outside of the water when traveling to different continents. Jeremy Wade is always very culturally aware, and often has to tread thin lines when investigating animals in extreme locations. He is always eager to seek local knowledge, respect tradition and utilize the assistance of the community. When speaking to those who have suffered loss or injury he is sympathetic, yet composed and persevering."



2)  Flesh Ripper 
Jeremy Wade is on the trail of a mysterious man-eater. New Zealand's freshwaters have been a safe place for swimmers, yet as Jeremy finds out, its remote rivers and deep lakes provide refuge for an ancient and slippery predator that can stay hidden for more than a century. To flush one out, he must put himself on the menu.
