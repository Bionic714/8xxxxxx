,muzk,2013-02-23T04:18Z,What's this about German characters? Over 1900 seeders and just 1 comment? Someone please elaborate.
,tarball8,2013-02-25T07:31Z,"One scene for about 1 minute.   The German text messages are a bit annoying, but it doesn't seem like the plot gets lost from it.   In any event, all the torrents I looked at seem to have come from the same source."
,creek3r,2013-03-07T00:40Z,Can someone who understands German please be so kind as to translate the text messages? Danke!
,sensualspirit,2013-03-31T03:09Z,"I agree, I don't even understand why they are in German, this is an American show isn't it?

How can some edit the file so the texts are in German? I'm confused."
,liightz,2013-04-10T07:53Z,"I don't speak German but here are the text messages. It's not exact, but you'll get the message... hehe.

Zoe 22:15: ""What could be more urgent?""
F. Underwood 22:15: ""You are unstoppable.""
Zoe 22:15: ""Unstoppable? I haven't even started!""
F. Underwood 22:15: ""I can't even imagine.""

,Nemo89,2013-04-29T23:47Z,"Texts are in German 'cause this particular copies of the show that got uploaded here come from German TV, geniuses. Nobody edited the video files, it was some German TV station that did that. It's like with the video games this days - they just get the english version shipped with dev's kit for localisation. What I'm more interested in is why on earth, among 315 milion people in US there is not a single resident who'd record and upload such a loudly and widely praised TV show?!"
,crazyoliv,2013-05-23T00:37Z,"Why noone speaks german??? GotesWerdamtenGlück!

The first two episodes, exceptionaly realised by David Fincher, are far better than the other ones. The gorgeous journalist is the sister of the girl that played in the Fincher's Girl with the Dragon Tatoo which, obviously, is far better than the original swedish version.

Donnerwetter!!"
