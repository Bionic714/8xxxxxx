I pirate the software I do, because that software SHOULD be shareware, imo. To offer this here, ""figuring you'd make it easier"" is like kicking a horse in the teeth. It is saying, ""thanks guys, for the quality website and adequate scenery. I think, for your efforts, you should be paid nothing, but I will reduce your bandwidth bill by mirroring you product without the shareware request!""
 What, do we just steal everything we can get our hands on?"

So no it is not stealing because it is freeware as the agreement states. I think it is a great scenery and is hard to find since it is not on the fsx freeware database, I simply like the scenery and wanted to share it with other because I thought it was great. I also included a link to the developer site which allows people to give donations if they want."

I got it from him not knowing about their website, installed it and tried it and never even looked at your ""EULA,"" so, so much for that pressing information. That is all legal disclaimer anyway, so don't go pulling the semantics card, that's just lame.

It is shareware, after all, these guys offer it at whatever price we can pay and you know it costs bandwidth, if not anything else. I believe it is our responsibility, when we share, to inform these things, that's all, the source, or the terms.
I am sorry if I seemed harsh but I hope you heed my request or opinion or whatever you call it. I should have welcomed you to TPB, so, welcome.

I also read that you are having problems with banned ip's. There is a reason for this. I think it is automatic and there are answers in the SuprBay forum. You might search there. If I am not mistaken, it is because of your ISP."
,pierce368,2013-02-24T23:24Z,"Its all good, I really didnt mean any harm by it. I just really liked the scenery and wanted to share it. I use alot of freeware stuff and a good amount of it is amazing (philly, fsnordic stuff, prague etc) Found this one in the depths of the web so just wanted to shed some light on it. I assumed it was freeware because there was no time limit etc

The ip stuff is good now, just need to switch proxy every upload or so."
