FSX Aerosoft Madrid Barajas 1.02. Tested and working, this is version 1.02 which fixes the bad FPS issue. Found and sharing here.

Remember if you like it buy it. Its the right thing but also will allow you to get all the updates and support which will increase FPS amd fix bugs, add stuff etc. Trust me, the updates make a difference especially in high density zones with addons etc.
