,KevinCostner,2013-02-23T23:37Z,Are there hard coded English subs for the non speaking English parts?
,KevinCostner,2013-02-23T23:41Z,"Why do you guys continue to put subs in a ""srt file""?  These are useless if you're burning to disc.  Why can't you upload these titles with the subs attached normally so they can be burned to a disc?"

srt files are easy to manage, I would think why.

People really just don't care. They're not uploading to people who are going to burn it to a disc because most people watch on their computer. If you wanna download movies to burn to DVD, try the Movies - DVDR section, that may help you out. And also because 1080p files can't be burned on DVDs, and those who burn movies onto blu-ray discs are a small percentage, I think.

Nobody's required to make them easy to burn to dvd, so don't act entitled. Let them do what they want, they don't have to cater to your specific needs. Just attach them yourself if you're that irritated."
,MsPeachy,2013-02-25T13:41Z,Thank you for this!
,pro346pro,2013-03-02T11:34Z,1080p files can be burned to DVD disc and so can srt files I do it from time to time if I'm trying to save HD space and they also play on bluray player
