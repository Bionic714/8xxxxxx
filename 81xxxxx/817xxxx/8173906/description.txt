Is there an exit from the actual financial crisis?
Is the crisis real, paradoxal or a paradigm of economic ideological orthodoxy, combined to the needs of uncontrolled modern financial markets?
"Debt  Management" is an insight to the Greek reality/developments of the unfolding crisis.  
What is actually happening in Greece? How different is the crisis from the rest of the Euro-zone?
What can we learn from this symbolic war between people's determination to preserve common values, human conditions, rights and needs, versus an orwellian financial world?

Debt Management
Are we really free to choose and is the peopleΓÇÖs power acknowledged? ΓÇ£Debt ManagementΓÇ¥ is a short documentary on the illusion of freedom (the case of the ΓÇ£boiling frogΓÇ¥) and the illusion of choice (as in the example of ΓÇ£PlatoΓÇÖs caveΓÇ¥). The Greek crisis is just another round in the constant struggle between those who take decisions that determine the will of whole societies and the real power of the people. How can entire societies become powerless, from an economic point of view? By what means is that being achieved in modern Europe?
