This GOLD album from 1979 contains the duo's first wave of Top-10 hits during 1971-1978. it also features some album tracks that weren't hits that make it a must-have purchase despite MANY later CD versions of the duo's hits. The six duets that weren't hits but were fan favorites:

"It's Only Make Believe"; 
"I've Already Loved You in My Mind"; 
"Pickin' Wild Mountain Berries"; 
"Spiders and Snakes"; 
"You're the Reason Our Kids Are Ugly"; 
and the album closer, "God Bless America Again". 

Eight of the songs were hits, though. this album was released the same year as Conway's solo album "Cross Winds" and his all-new duet album with Loretta called "Diamond Duet" (the singles from that album, of course, aren't on this Very Best of collection.) The album opens up with their signature duet, "Louisiana Woman, Mississippi Man" from 1973. The only hit that some might not recall that well is "From Seven Till Ten", but it hit #6 in 1978. 

Owen Bradley produced all the songs on this album. "Lead Me On" is the next to last song. Their Grammy winner, "After The Fire Is Gone", opens up side two (or in the CD age, it's simply track 9). For those who aren't huge fans of neither Conway or Loretta, this album is still a must have because it showcases 6 of their album tracks not available hardly anywhere unless you have the original vinyl albums. The album tracks are just as great as the hit singles and it shows off the wonderful chemistry the duo had in the studio.
