This is a full mirror of methopoly.com as of 2/21/2013. Methopoly is a Breaking Bad version of Monopoly. The site contains full instructions and PDF's to create your own Methopoly board and cards. Regular Monopoly money, tokens, and house and hotel pieces can be used to play the game. I made this offline mirror as an attempt to keep the game alive in case Parker Brothers or AMC's lawyers decide to take it down.
