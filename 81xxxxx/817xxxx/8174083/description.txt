  The fourth full-length offering from Ocala, FL-based punk-pop/metalcore outfit A Day to Remember opens with vocalist Jeremy McKinnon screaming ΓÇ£I am fueled by all forms of failureΓÇ¥. What Separates Me From You is whiney, petulant, immature, hopeless, and thoroughly addicting, as the ten songs contained within the gatefold packaging (with the not-so-subtle painting of a man on a busy city street, trapped in an hourglass as the sand piles up around him) are as immaculately crafted and engaging as they are blindingly self-absorbed. Produced by New Found GloryΓÇÖs Chad Gilbert, WSMFY blurs the line between clean vocal emo-punk and throat-exploding metalcore with great success, especially on the more brutal offerings like ΓÇ£Sticks and StoneΓÇ¥, ΓÇ£2nd SucksΓÇ¥, ΓÇ£You Be Tails,ΓÇ¥ ΓÇ£I'll Be Sonic,ΓÇ¥ and the guitarmony-laden album high point ΓÇ£This Is the House that Doubt Built.ΓÇ¥ While mopey, melodic punk-pop jams like ΓÇ£All Signs Point to LauderdaleΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£Out of TimeΓÇ¥ may sound like second-rate Against Me! cuts, the performances are so flawless and the knob-twiddling (mouse clicking) is so dialed in, that the volume nearly goes up on its own.
