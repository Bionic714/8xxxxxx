Infected files are:

Dictionary of Plant Lore
Current Status of Carotid bifurcation
Dictionary For Clinical Trials
Development Problems of Childhood & Adolescence"
,MJE55,2013-02-24T17:28Z,Up to 9 trojans now and only halfway downloaded. Part 9 now showing one too.
,Benson,2013-02-27T07:13Z,Thank YOU!
,Benson,2013-02-27T07:50Z,In depth scan with AVG found that the files are clean!
,MJE55,2013-02-27T20:12Z,I'm still plodding along downloading this and Zone Alarm has stopped the download 10 times due to the aforementioned MSIL.Disfa.Pye  trojan. The past 2 days have gone without a hitch though. I completed part 9 yesterday with 4 stoppages by ZA. The first 7 parts came through with no trouble.

All files seem clean. It sounds like either ZoneAlarm found a false positive, or you've got some nasty malware from elsewhere."
,cetme308,2013-03-16T00:03Z,"I'm just passing on the files as I got them and have not done any scan of the files.

If you're concerned about stoppages, before starting the download just deselect the ones that are programs until you are at the computer to deal with the alerts..."
