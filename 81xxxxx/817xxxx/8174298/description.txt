Available as part of the NeoGeo Station on PlayStation
Network, this is a downloadable version of the classic
NeoGeo game.

Yuri Sakazaki has been abducted by Mr. Big to punish her
father, Takuma, and her brother, Ryo. To rescue her, Ryo
and Robert must take on numerous enemies around South
Town, eventually reaching the mysterious Mr. Karate. The
passion of the game's creators is evident in the unique
game-play elements introduced. These include an energy
gauge that is depleted every time a fighter uses a
special maneuver, Desperation Attacks that are usable
only when a fighter's health is low and camera zooming
that adjusts on the fly as fighters move around the
stage. All these features ensure that players use
strategy and tactics, rather than simply mash buttons.
Adding to the mix are little touches such as characters
showing cuts when they are injured and voice-over samples
during cut scenes. Can you perfect the art of fighting
and save Yuri?
