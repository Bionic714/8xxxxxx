I give to you today, 225 Cars from FreshPrince Creations. 

With these, your Sims can drive everything from a 1950 Ford F-1 Pickup to a Lockheed Martin F-35 Fighter Jet (Flyable!)

Enjoy!


Creators notes on the Fighter Jet:

- Designed for one sim at a time to drive.

-Wheels don't animate.

-Not Recolorable

-Set includes Ground Drivable Plane, Flyable plane, and Helipad for flyable plane.

-Sims sit through their seat.

-For flyable plane, place a driveway down first, then buy your plane and put it in your driveway. Then use "moveobjects on" to place helipad.

-Shadows aren't perfect.
