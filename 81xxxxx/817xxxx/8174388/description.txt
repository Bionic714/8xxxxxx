Almost 22 years after My Bloody Valentine's last album, Kevin Shields has completed this stunning followup. What My Bloody Valentine have done is take the precise toolkit of Loveless-- layered Fender Jaguar guitars made woozy through pedals and tremolo, hushed androgynous vocals way down in the mix, titles that hint at the grey memory of feelings rather than saying anything explicit-- and made another album with it, one that is stranger and darker and even harder to pin down. Rather than feeling effortless, mbv strains, pushing at its boundaries with a sense of pensive gloom.
