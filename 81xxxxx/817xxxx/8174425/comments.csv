It does not matter what I do, or rename I've been gone a year now at least, but you always remember me and my ""torrents"" haha :D 
It's always fun when you come back and ask. 

A RUSH collection yes why not they're extremely well this weekend, we shall see what happens. 
All is not good I do, but I do what I can.

And someone like you make this place floats on for you is important even you canadianice :)"

You are right there are a few files that are equal but listen before you spew bile on it can be ""LIVE""

If not, you may well take it easy, I'm getting old and do not bitching about things that I do not get paid for haha. Take care and thanks :)"
