From Joss Whedon, creative mastermind behind Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel,comes the proactive Dollhouse, a sexy, suspenseful thriller starring the stunningly talented Eliza Dushku.

As an "Active", the mysterious Echo (Dushku) serves as an unwitting agent of Dollhouse, an illegal underground organization that provides its elite clientele with programmable human beings. Actives receive personality imprints, allowing them to temporarily become anyone or anything - the perfect burglar, lover, spy, or assassin. Now, with the FBI and her own shadowy past closing in, Echo must face a rogue Active who will stop at nothing to bring Dollhouse down - forever.

Ripped with DVDFab 8 in 1:1 ratio FULLDISC mode. Untouched DVD9, NTSC Region 1. Stored in .iso format so it will need to be opened with a program such as Virtual CloneDrive (free and what I use), or image will need to be burned to a dual-layer DVD to use in a DVD drive/player.
