Everyone please seed or reseed this it says just 126 seed,(im never having a go at the uploader ! ) if u find any file with low seeds & you still have the file please reseed (start sharing the file again from utorrent /bittorent etc) torrent sites may not be around for ever so always help out. If a files taking over a week to get leave a comment so we know a file may not complete..copy url link & ask for a ressed on suprbay forum ! , If you find a file lacking useful details like imdb.com  info & a films score out of 10  /tvrage.com & score or wikipedia info please google it then copy & paste it into a comment to help every1 else out , ive more than done my share of helping now its your turn, and always report viruses or fakes to the suprbay forum thanks, ps dont forget the faster you seed uploading the faster your files download so set upload speed to unlimited in Utorrent etc ,we must get more people to help out , theres too many hit & runners who never comment or add links etc :( "

I usually watch all the movies at film.kbc44.com because they have HD's but they didn't have this one so im happy to have piratebay :) Thank you once again uploader for this great share!"
