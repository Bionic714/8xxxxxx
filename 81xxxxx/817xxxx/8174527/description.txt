It's the start of Hollywood on Hudson, and New York City is swept up  in the glamour. Every night, the red carpet rolls out for movie stars  arriving at premieres in limos; the most exclusive restaurants close for  private parties for wealthy producers and preeminent directors; and  thousands of fans gather with the paparazzi, hoping to catch a glimpse  of the most famous and beautiful faces in the world. With this many  celebrities in town, special task force NYPD Red is on high alert - and  they can't afford to make a single mistake.[/color]

Then a world-renowned  producer fatally collapses at his power breakfast, and top NYPD Red  Detective Zach Jordan is the first one on the scene. Zach works with his  beautiful new partner, Detective Kylie MacDonald - who also happens to  be his ex-girlfriend - to discover who the murderer might be. But this  is only the beginning: the most brutal, public, and horrifyingly  spectacular crimes they've ever encountered are about to send all of New  York into chaos, putting NYPD Red on the ropes.

Zach and Kylie  know there's no way of telling what a killer this deranged will do next.  With the whole world watching, they have to find a way to stop a  psychopath who has scripted his finale down to the last explosive  detail. With larger-than-life action, relentless speed, and  white-knuckle twists, NYPD Red is the next mega-blockbuster from "The Man Who Can't Miss."

Please Note! The last 8 minutes of NYPD Red seems to be virtually silent. I have cut approximately the last 8 minutes of the original file, amplified that portion, and uploaded the fixed ending.
