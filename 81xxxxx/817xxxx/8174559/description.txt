  Rooted in the fertile Chapel Hill music scene, Mount Moriah built a devoted national following around their D.I.Y. debut. They were tapped for a national tour with the Indigo Girls; endorsed by Pitchfork, NPR, The Onion A.V. Club, Stereogum, PopMatters, and others; named the creators of North CarolinaΓÇÖs best 2011 album by Shuffle Magazine; and featured on Bon IverΓÇÖs celebrity playlist on iTunes. Much acclaim focused on the riveting stage presence of McEntire, hailed by the Mountain GoatsΓÇÖ John Darnielle as the kind one rarely discovers, a sentiment echoed by Paste MagazineΓÇÖs Shane Ryan, who wrote: ΓÇ£McEntire fits into that rarified subgroup of charismatic performers ΓÇª When she sings, the transformation begins. The energy is evident in her eyes ΓÇª and in her voice, a powerful instrument capable of finding the perfect emotional tone within the lyrics ΓÇª I left the venue knowing [Mount Moriah] will be huge.ΓÇ¥
