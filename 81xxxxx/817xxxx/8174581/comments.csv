,pythonista99,2013-02-22T10:44Z,Can we seriously expect a 117 GB torrent to actually be seeded properly bu the uploader ?  I wouldn't stake my limited download bandwidth on a partial and then hung download !
,torrmaker,2013-03-06T18:14Z,"At least four users have just completed this download and two more should complete within the hour. These are just the peers I see so the total could be higher. I know everyone says this but please seed. Niche torrents like this need as many seeders as possible, especially in the beginning."

But this could take a year at this rate.  

This is incredible, I just hope it lasts...."
