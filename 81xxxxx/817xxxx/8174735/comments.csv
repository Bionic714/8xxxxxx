,Tlakuikani,2013-05-04T16:03Z,it's just in english or also includes japanese?
,yinyang107,2013-06-01T11:59Z,"First several thoughts:

1. The fuck's a .m4v file? Probably won't play on my Xbox.

2. No episode titles in filenames? Shucks.

3. Holy crap that's fast. 12 episodes in 2 hours.

4. Hooray! It works on Xbox!

5. Drat, all the text (Credits, titlecard, etc) is in Japanese.

(And no, there's no Japanese audio.)"
