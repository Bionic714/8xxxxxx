PART 22 of 23 - Yes the second last part of this mega collection of over 19600 Karaoke songs in MP3+CDG Format, tagged and file named to industry standards.

FEEL FREE TO RE SEED THIS ENTIRE COLLECTION on any other Bit torrent site you wish.  Let's get rid of badly tagged or non tagged Karaoke on the Web once and for all.

Just because the Karaoke Labels don't know what they are doing, does not excuse YOU as an expert computer user... Well if you got this far you sure as heck know your way around bit torrent that is for sure.

There are at least ONE PERCENT index errors in this collection, so with about 20 Thousand tracks you can expect about 200 wrongly tagged or duplicate songs.  It should be easy for you to spot them if you open the collection in a file window and sort the tracks by FILE NAME.  The mistakes will be grouped together and very close or right next to any duplicate files.

Your mission is to reduce these errors to ZERO before you re up this lot on any other site.  In the short term please help me seed weak torrents in this collection.  On the Pirate bay tick AUDIO and then search for this string:
