,dodo_dudut,2013-02-23T21:45Z,"Great episode, nice plot so far. Storyline is intelligent and i wouldn't change it even a bit. Quality - A10 V10. I usually watch everything at film.plotar.org	because they always have HD but they don't have tv shows so having TPB for TVshows is great, thnx!"

,ubiknik,2013-02-25T08:55Z,Mr. Doodoo dolt I am sure you didn't watch anything -wow what a mastermind angle giving such warm and glowing reviews to hook some poor meathead (like yourself) into bouncing over to some pay to click crap site. Scum of the Earth telemarketers have mutated into shitknobs like yourself. 
,OnAStick,2013-03-01T17:58Z,"Totally agree with you, ubi. I laugh every time I see that fucking sentence: ""Storyline is intelligent and i wouldn't change it even a bit."" 

Like you, I get tired of the fucktards."
,Mr_Cha-whoo,2013-03-17T02:54Z,YAY!!!
