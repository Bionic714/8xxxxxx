"Conventions of Space and Time"

In support of Troy and Abed, the study 
group heads to InspecTiCon - the annual 
Inspector Spacetime Convention. Trouble 
begins when the group meets up with 
Abed's email "pen-pal," Toby Davies 
(guest star Matt Lucas), who's shared 
passion for Inspector Spacetime comes 
between Abed and Troy. Meanwhile, Annie 
leaves the convention floor to enjoy the 
luxuries of the hotel while Jeff relaxes 
in the bar with Lauren, an Inspector 
Spacetime fan (Tricia Helfer).
