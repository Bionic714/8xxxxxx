Some of the Margie TV cast also worked on the radio show, except
that the radio version had a better actress Verna Felton ( previously 
in Red Skelton's radio show ) in the role of elderly Mrs. Odets.
Verna's portrayal, however, was outspoken and wisecracking. 
Not the boring, quiet Mrs. Odets in the television version.

The TV series actually began first and both versions ran on different nights.
