,Vegetto420,2013-03-02T04:42Z,I just wanted to say thanks to Rigmar_radio for this unbelievable collection that he has put together! I have searched high and low and couldn't find anything like this! Thanks again and again! Secondly I'm not a huge expert at the karaoke files but The ones that have completed I did go and check out all I have is the .mp3 file and when I play them there is no lyrics to go with the song. Is there supposed to be a .cdg file names the same as the song to go along with the  files? Or is there a specific program I need to play these back? Many thanks again
,Vegetto420,2013-03-02T04:58Z,Never mind I'm an idiot! I didn't have win RAR on this machine so I didn't see the RAR at the end with all the CDG's in it! AWESOME! Thanks Rigmar_radio and these are sound choice as well the BEST!
,Vegetto420,2013-03-07T03:02Z,"Hey all got this amazing collection done in two days! 
my only problem now is the ""p"" artists. goes from paul macrtny to POD skips everything else according to the master list. There should be pink floyd which I was looking forward to. Looked at download 15 and 16's list and those are what we got but the master has a different list. can we get the ones that are missing? Please"
,gabevr,2013-03-09T20:20Z,"This is amazing, thanks so much! 

Some of H, all of I, J, and K, and some of L are missing. Lots of good tracks in there! Any word on uploading the missing tracks? 

No rush, just curious if you have them. There's plenty to tide us over! "
,dtwins,2013-03-11T10:51Z,"Thanks! 150mbit connection seeding. Sometimes peaks at 18 megaBytes per second.

I haven't seen anything this great in the scene since the days of IRC. Definitely the biggest collection online, even after the missing files. Can't thank you enough rigmar_radio. "
,CyberTootie,2013-03-29T00:42Z,"Great release. A lot of useful torrent functionality is neutralized by RARing the content, however.

While I'm thinking about it, does anyone know of a torrent hub dedicated to karaoke?"
,fanie.dry,2013-04-14T11:59Z,"I seem to be missing a lot of files starting with I, J, K. In which of the 23 torrents are most of them? My K has like 6 different songs. That's definitely not right. Would appreciate anyone pointing me in the right direction."
,greebomc,2013-04-21T10:44Z,Where is J???
,pancakebread,2013-04-26T01:15Z,Great collection. Thank you.  Only 2 bands i really wanted that aren't in this are motley crue and pearl jam but i'll try to find them somewhere...
,tony08,2013-04-27T08:42Z,These xongs seem to have been ripped with something like vocal remover.  OK for a party at your home but no good for prime time.  Vocals can still be heard during many parts of most of the songs.  Thanks for trying though
,tony08,2013-04-27T08:45Z,This collection and the others are ok for a party at home but not for prime time.  The vocals can still be heard on most of the songs throughout the 23 collections.  They were done with something like vocal remover or some other silly program
,CyberTootie,2013-05-04T01:27Z,"I mean I haven't gone through and listened to the entire collection, but I have yet to encounter one as described by tony08."
,CyberTootie,2013-05-04T15:08Z,"I'd like to bring up a slight sound quality issue...

The uploader recommended a certain player for the files; OTS something or other. I tried it. I ended up not using it because it doesn't natively support MP3+CDG, rather it will convert them to their own proprietary format so the player will play it. I found that too counterproductive to use it, so I went with VirtualDJ. But anyways, after looking into some of the sound and based on tags I'm seeing in the files, I've drawn the conclusion that at least some of these files (I haven't looked at them all) are transcodes from OTS' proprietary format, further degrading audio quality moreso than they already were. If I'm right, that means these affected audio files have at least two transcodes:

Original MP3 encode -> OTS format -> MP3

What does this mean? The uploader's use of this OTS program permanently damaged the sound quality of the files, albeit somewhat insignificantly."
