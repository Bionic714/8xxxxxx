Part 23 of 23 THE END of this amazing Karaoke collection.   WELL DONE you have been a part of a Pirate Bay RECORD with 100 Gigabyte of uncompressed data having been seeded over a short 7 day period.  Amazing - some average swarm speeds have been in excess of 10 mega bits per second and considering that I can only seed at 3.5 at best that shows the power of the swarm.

Thank you for being a part of this.  Now you can relax and enjoy the collection, find the 200 plus errors and duplicates still in the files, sort that and then re seed the whole lot on your own Bit torrent site.  That would be cool.

Please keep an eye on the 23 parts and if you see any poor seed to peer ratio's please jump in and help out with the seeding as many peers are just joining the action now and don't forget some have very poor bandwidth connections and it may take them many weeks to get all 23 parts.

So a big pat on your back for getting this far, I would of never made it without your help.   Enjoy the Music.
