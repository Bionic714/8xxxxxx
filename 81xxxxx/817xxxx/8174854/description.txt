"Face"

An explosive start to Hank's search for his 
wife, Laila, brings him and "Beck" to a 
near-death confrontation with White Vincent, 
who slips away in the Canadian Tundra. Now 
faced with more questions than answers - not 
just about his wife, but about his own 
existence - the search is on for the next 
clock. Determined to unlock the next clue in 
the hope that it will bring him closer to 
understanding his past and the woman he 
loves, Hank and Beck set course for India, 
where Hank is confronted with a bombshell 
discovery. Meanwhile, Rachel and Arron chase 
another path, which reveals the final 
journey of the mysterious Rose Commandant.
