When Stefan arrives back in Mystic Falls with Elena 
and Jeremy, Caroline is immediately worried about 
Elena's state of mind. Stefan reaches out to Dr. 
Fell and Matt for help. Still on the island, Damon 
relays somber news to Rebekah, and is surprised at 
her reaction. Together, Damon and Rebekah learn an 
unexpected bit of recent history from Vaughn. 
Everyone is horrified when Bonnie reveals the rest

to help her, Elena comes up with a plan of her own.
