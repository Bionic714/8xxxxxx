,antde2001,2013-02-22T22:55Z,"@miki80pirate No, to my knowledge there's no hack to somehow make an out-of-date card compatible with this generation of games. Your best bet would be to upgrade as it seems Crysis 3 is DX11 native and can't be switched to an earlier version. "
,hisazul,2013-02-22T22:55Z,"Point is... i refuse to use preloaded bullshit.
1... its always half arsed. unfinished product ment to simply lessen download. uploaded ones need full fucking do it urself registry fixing unless u want it in some retarded ass default folder. and they tend to also have glitches because digital uploads aren't even always full/correct. They tend to be fixed/checked on the spot.
So again... is this equivalent of hunter edition/digital deluxe?"

You have to mount both iso's. DVD 1 is just install files. DVD 2 has 16 to 30 something, plus crack. After mounting and installing the first one it will then ask for 16 and on, find the drive with the second dvd and open up game folder, then click ok. "

2 - Go into control panel and into ""System""

3 - Go to ""Computer"" tab where you can change your name and description... CHANGE BOTH names! the name of the computer and then the Description to anything... (ex:) ""fuckdapolice""

4 - Restart the computer

5 - Now start the game again it will crash again recreating the Electronic Arts folder once more... now delete the EA folder again one more time and Boot up Crysis 3

Ya, I s'pose you're right, but it'll look great on the 60"" LCD,,,,,,much better than a console would.

Don't you mean the REPLACEMENT CRACK from extremezone?

,nerfu,2013-02-25T23:17Z,"@Funkyasshit: Your display should have an option for how to handle lower resolutions in its setup menu. The naming differs widely between manufacturers. Look for something like ""scaling"". On my Dell it's called ""Wide Mode"". You should set that to ""Fill"" or ""Aspect"" or whatever it is called with yours. Check your monitor's manual.

Graphics drivers may also offer controls for this. Eg. in the Radeon's AMD Vision Control Centre under ""My Digital Flat-Panels"" -> ""Properties"" there is an option called ""Image Scaling""."

However, on one of my other systems, that have a DX10 card installed - game will not launch.

I do know, as I have seen, these ""Crysis 3 DX10 fixes"". Forget them, there are none. Even the one that say ""No Surveys!"". Game was made exclusively for DX11 capable cards, those who can run the game know what I'm speaking of, and those few out there that can run the game in ""Ultra"" settings know exactly why..
Doesn't it bother you? That even that the game is ""free"" here, you still have to spend money on a new graphics card?

Thing is - in the computer world, you have to hang on with the rest, follow the flow. Doesn't matter much complaining about it, doesn't change the fact that your hardware is outdated when you can't play a game that requires something extra..

There is however a solution:
Get a job. Whatever job, get it, take it. Follow that stream instead. Yes, I do have a job. And yes, I did download the game - for testing.
I know own a digital copy.

People keep arguing, ""I ain't gonna pay EA that sum for a game like this!"". Well don't do it. Just realize one thing - EA is the publisher, just like someone giving out a book, but it's the people behind each game that you should thank at the very end of the day..."

I had the same issue. I downloaded that fix everyone is posting and it worked.

But now i have a new issue. In the 3rd mission when trying to take out the 3 turrets, you have to pick up a sniper rifle. I've watched other walkthrough video's and people who pick them up have ammo in the rifle! I don't! My rifle has zero ammo so i die all the time because you're not actually supposed to get through the turrets.

Anyone know how to fix this?"

He didn't make the game, he didn't crack the game, he didn't build your computer, he didn't corrupt your file transfer, and he didn't install a shitty anti virus that flies off the handle every time it sees a file that was created using tools that ""hackers"" use.  He also didn't force you to download anything.

What he did do, was find and upload shitloads of games, movies, and other software that are all as reliable as they can be considering they're cracked, so unappreciative assholes like yourself could sit back and steal a copy without having to have any sort of personal connections or know shit from shinola.

There is nothing wrong with the game, the only thing that has changed is the executable and some dynamic-link library files. Other than that, it's still the same game as if you would have bought it.


And no, there is not going to be a ""patch"" for people who has a graphics card that lacks the necessary DX11 requirements.


Ok, I know that you don't want to spend like 60US$ on a game perhaps, but do you still want that old graphics card? You can afford internet, a decent computer, food on the table and roof over your head - so why not a graphics card for say 40 bucks?


And don't complain so much, instead ask ""why"" and perhaps get some help instead..

Så vad fan ska man göra för att starta spelet?"
,Magestrix,2013-04-20T13:00Z,"@Olsson30: Kör du exe filen i administratörs läge?
Om inte, högerklicka och välj att köra som admin.
Hör av dig om det fortfarande inte fungerar.
Lycka till!"
