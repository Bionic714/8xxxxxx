This is a DTS 5.1 conversion created from a lossless FLAC stereo source utilizing the SPEC method (ArcTan mode) as found on www.surroundbyus.com.

Only playable on home theater equipment and PC software capable of decoding a DTS signal. Otherwise, you will hear static.

Notes and disclaimers:

It is not recommended that you downmix these tracks to stereo, transcode them in any way, or make any changes other to them than how they are presented here.

If you are not a fan of stereo-to-surround conversions, while I do recommend giving the SPEC mixes a chance, if it is not your intention to do so, please respect those who do get enjoyment out of these mixes and do not troll or flame on my, or anyone else's, posts.

Rundgren's always one of my favorites to convert. Those who liked my other conversions of his won't be disappointed here.
