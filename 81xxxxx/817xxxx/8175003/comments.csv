There seem to be certain users who are very aware of the episodes of a lot of good shows that need to be uploaded, and you are certainly at the top part of that list.  It seems that when i finally find a show I've been looking for that most of the time it's from you guys..  Thanks again.

[V],psspss,2013-02-22T06:01Z,"im not a team... im like a reg user.. who shares not leeches like most do here. 

I just find the sources and fix and convert and rename or add title and upload..

anyone is able to do that same.. many sources are public but some are hidden on private out the way of the greedy trouble makers out there"
[V],psspss,2013-02-22T06:59Z,a lot of people download my sh1t but they dont comment much or say thnx either :) does that mean I should give up sharing this?
[V],psspss,2013-02-22T07:11Z,"i did forget to align on interleaves and opti header for sony on this one.. its a simple header fix.. I was in a rush for apptment

,MrBigSeeder,2013-02-22T07:25Z,"as always, thank you for all your efforts. i appreciate that you go through the time to share with others week after week and i will always seed till i bleed on these. cheers, all the best."
,beechyboy,2013-02-22T14:13Z,"I had to find show lately for some reason.

Thanks

PS - Remember on Demonoid when everyone said thanks after downloading?"
,beechyboy,2013-02-22T14:16Z,Oh by the way... why is Hardcore Pawn Chicago not available lately?
[V],psspss,2013-02-22T14:45Z,"the hardcore pawn chicago one isnt very popular as the original.. plus I suspect it clashes with some other crap so the handful of usa cappers or scene arent doing it

and i too have got bored with that one.. I like the original though I didnt see a listing for it.. but tvrage isnt well maintained in recent months!! so who in usa is keeping it up to date and ahead of coming things.. mmmm no one perhaps 

so maybe hardcore original did air too

I use myepisodes.com its very good to alert you but cos it mostly uses tvrage it too hasnt been notifying people and i think cappers use it a bit also for alerts"
,chucktuna,2013-02-24T06:20Z,"actually, I think the original show just finished its current season.. (at least according to futon.com)... anyway... if I remember correctly, last year when the season 'ended' for hardcore pawn detroit, there was only about a month until they started the next season, sp whp knows?? It might be back on, so I'll keep watching anyhow.
