From the 11 songs track list are in 4 files . The first file it's just static noise and the other files have sound dips going up and down in volume . I would prefer to have this seeded properly instead of some graphic pictures ."
[V],24.96,2013-02-22T22:45Z,Use a media player that supports cue files.  And no static or dips in audio here.
,Adamalarc,2013-02-23T02:58Z,"I tried several things before i posted . BS Player VLC , external DAC , OPPO DAC and the receiver internal DAC . For the first file nothing worked and the dips were and only noticeable at higher volumes on the OPPO . I wish i could get my hands on this in Vinyl but the ones who have it don't sell ."
