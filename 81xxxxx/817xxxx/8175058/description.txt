"Boom Goes the Dynamite"

Olivia and the team are hired by an up and 
coming politician, Peter Caldwell, but 
this time instead of fixing a scandal, 
they're playing high-powered matchmaker. 
Meanwhile, David is trying to leave the 
past behind him, but when he feels like 
he's being followed, he finally turns to 
the team at OPA for help. Back at the 
White House, Fitz is still struggling with 
whom to trust and how to handle a delicate 
hostage situation, and Jake just won't 
take no for an answer when it comes to 
dating Olivia.

Evolve... or die.

Enjoy :)
