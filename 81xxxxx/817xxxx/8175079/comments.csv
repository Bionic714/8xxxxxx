,Rawlings44,2013-02-23T01:06Z,"If you can only see russian text/menus then open up system.cfg in the Crysis 3 directory and change sys_languages to ""russian, english"" and g_language=english."

,TrevLove,2013-02-24T15:19Z,"I tried to change the CFG file like you said, but when I do it changes it to a .txt document instead. I tried going back and renaming it but it still says its a .txt file and I cant seem to change it. https://thepiratebay.sx/user/Rawlings44/"
,doomslayermax,2013-03-10T08:29Z,"worked for me , you gotta save the system.cfg on the desktop then paste it over and replace the other system.cfg and also you can edit it with notepad , thats all i did if it doesnt work for you then its your system not the torrent files and thank you azaq318"
