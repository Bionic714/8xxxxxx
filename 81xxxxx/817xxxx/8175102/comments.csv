I wonder who you are.

What kind of a name is Dibya? 

TPB obviously stands for the pirate bay. 

Thank you for all your great work man. Take care now. "
,casper89,2013-02-22T08:49Z,"@Expedio shut the fuck up man. 

@DibyaTPB thanks"
,sticker101,2013-02-22T13:39Z,"@Expedio  - You silly twat

Thanks DibyaTPB"
,Blizmond,2013-02-22T15:43Z,What if it's George Dibya Bush?
,fall1en,2013-02-22T17:39Z,"Thanks for this!

@ casper89 & sticker101: Wow, guess you two have trouble coping with people that are decent human beings, so you needed to trash them to make them feel guilty for not being as vile minded as you both clearly are."
,Matvej,2013-02-23T01:40Z,"fuck you fallen! go to fb

@ thanks DibyaTPB"
,madlax10,2013-02-23T03:20Z,Thanks for the up - Seeded 15:1 and still going.  Will probably stop at around 20:1.  The least I could do for a good uploader.
,jala0011,2013-02-23T22:20Z,"Great episode, nice plot so far. Storyline is intelligent and i wouldn't change it even a bit. Quality - A10 V10. I usually watch everything at film.plotar.org	because they always have HD but they don't have tv shows so having TPB for TVshows is great, thnx!"
,Expedio,2013-02-24T20:24Z,Relax everyone. I was just curious. Dibya sort of sounds like a woman's name. 
,Francus_Caetus,2013-02-26T07:17Z,Relax everyone. He just wants to get into her panties
,RiverRaidII,2013-03-03T10:22Z,"Well, I thought it is well know, of course DIBYA stands for:

Deus
Infinitus
Brotherhood (of)
Yewish 
Arians

It's rather kinda obvious if you think about it. What else could it mean?"
