i love g.i. joe but the crappy art of this cover makes me sad."
[T],MrDowntown,2013-02-22T05:58Z,"OMG, I said the same thing, I havent read this issue yet, but if the art on the cover is the same inside, i may have to drop it :("
[V],STFmaryville,2013-02-22T14:29Z,"i read it this morning, and overall the comic is poor. i googled it and the good news is, that is by far the worst of 4 alternate covers. one of the other 3 is also in this scan. however steve kurth's art throughout is pretty bad. he's like an image artist from 20 years ago ... passable but just barely. fred van lente's story is ok but for a relaunch with a #1 on it, fairly boring and uninspiring. g.i. joe has had this problem throughout my life, from marvel to devil's due and now at idw -- the company with its license makes stellar comics for a year or two, then they slowly but surely turn to crap."
[T],MrDowntown,2013-02-22T17:14Z,"That blows ... Yeah the cover is very Liefield-esque.

The funny thing is I always forget his name, but if you Google, ""worst comic artist"" - He's the first result - not kidding."
,across97,2013-03-07T04:48Z,has anyone collected the GI Joe IDW comics that predate this volume?   That'd be awesome :-)
,teddyox,2013-03-20T17:43Z,I just saw this!! Have all the GI Joe titles started back at the beginning??
,dawg44,2013-04-17T22:32Z,"Does anyone know where I can get issue #2 & & #3 of this volume? They've been out but I've yet to see  them for BT download. Also, Two other new G.I. Joe Titles I haven't been able to find - GI Joe: Special Missions, and GI Joe: Cobra Files. Both are BRAND NEW titles that debuted with GI Joe Vol. 3. Thanks"
