Also, how editors feel about the characters and what they WANT do happen.
Case and point: Barbara Gordon was a badass cripple who became much more interesting as Oracle? Fuck that, she HAS to be Batgirl, because WE grew up with her! What, Cassandra Cain and Stephanie Brown? THERE'S ONLY ONE BATGIRL!11!!1!!1! Writers want to use those characters? Fuck that. Readers want to SEE those characters? If only to know if they still exist? I know! let's string them along and not give a clear answer for over a year! Damn we're good at out jobs!
Okay., rant over. Thanks for the upload :)"
