3 - Go to ""Computer"" tab where you can change your name and description... CHANGE BOTH names! the name of the computer and then the Description to anything... (ex:) ""fuckdapolice""

4 - Restart the computer

5 - Now start the game again it will crash again recreating the Electronic Arts folder once more... now delete the EA folder again one more time and Boot up Crysis 3

For those who cant run game, did you installed newest redistributable of DX11 from _install folder of this release? (or at least its in Deluxe release). Without it my game crashed and did not started, after installation runs ok."

You have to mount disc 2 first using a separate program such as DaemonTools, and then hit continue. This is different from a lot of other RELOADED torrents.

For all having that nagging issue starting the game, someone posted the solution, it worked for me!:

Guys anyone who has the CRYSIS logo pop up and then the game doesnt start.... this is how you fix it!

1 - Start the game, it crashes yes.. ok now go into ur C: Program Data folder and you will now see an Electronic Arts folder inside... DELETE it completely.

2 - Go into control panel and into ""System""

3 - Go to ""Computer"" tab where you can change your name and description... CHANGE BOTH names! the name of the computer and then the Description to anything... (ex:) ""fuckdapolice""

4 - Restart the computer

5 - Now start the game again it will crash again recreating the Electronic Arts folder once more... now delete the EA folder again one more time and Boot up Crysis 3

Brace yoself because now more CRASH! You can fkn play it now.. dont ask why this works it just does! GG people hope i helped some of you! "
