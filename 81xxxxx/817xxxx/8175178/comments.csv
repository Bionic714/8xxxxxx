#1 - It's primarily a Windows-based P2P downloader.  Any version ""cracked"" for Mac is surely going to pose issues of all sorts.  Besides, you can download the LEGITIMATE Windows version here:

#2 - I've done some research into the actual Windows version (via the OFFICIAL product forum) and there seems to be quite a few examples of various ISP's shutting users down and so on:

#3 - This dude here (luis26x) hasn't had the best record of sharing / posting up working torrents or good initial seeding practices.

DOWNLOAD AT YOUR OWN RISK."
,luis26x,2013-02-23T02:58Z,"Well I know this is with reliable, works 100%.
give no problem. I have little reputation torrent because I started early, but I have video neighborhoods and if my name sounds there but not as luis26x, this application does not hurt and is easy to remove as it is the same as taking an original application of mac."

I think you;re using a dictionary to look up english words you don't know. You don't seem to be using a web site to translate, because that would not misspell ""facile"" as ""fasil"". You're using some words that mean different things than you think they mean. Web site to translations are not much better,  but they will probably avoid the worst errors.  You should try  google translate.
If you are curious the incorrect words are: sip  game gluttony  obstructions  scam intrusions work fasil (facial)"
[V],joshua13,2013-03-08T03:25Z,I meant facile not facial for the last word
,dirtymeister,2013-03-27T00:35Z,"'Facil' is 'easy' in Portuguese.
ClubQbollocks you're a fucking muppet.
Luis, cool done, nice work."
,ClubQBall,2013-05-08T01:34Z,"dirtymeister - you're a fucking shit-for-brains dickhead.  Your point being, motherfucker?  Was I even fucking speaking to you, motherfucker?  No?  Then shut the fuck up."
