Photiosity is an application to sharpen blurry and shaky images. It uses a newly developed "blind deconvolution" technique to calculate the blur and to recalculate the original (sharp) image.

It is possible to achieve results that are far better than the image sharpening in many image editing programs. However, this requires the interactive cooperation of the user.

Photiosity runs on the CPU or on the graphics card (OpenCL).
Photiosity also contains an anti noise filter.
