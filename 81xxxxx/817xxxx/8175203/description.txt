For XVID AVI with MP3 audio, I put my faith in:
V=8
A=8
.
Gotta stop second guessing myself. Here was my demented logic:
Someone did a wonderful thing - they not only posted an XVID of 114,
they not only posted an XVID WEB-DL of 114, but they posted it a day early.
My brain said "can't beat that, why cause a glut". But this week's interest was
phenomenal and to top it off, someone's gotten frustrated looking for what aint
there - well, lesson learned, so here it is ... eight days late.
Sorry to all and sundry and especially to the loyal viewer who asked - Phaedron.
