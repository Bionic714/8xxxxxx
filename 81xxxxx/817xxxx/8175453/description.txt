by Stef

One great album in a decade is an achievement, two great albums in one year is
exceptional, yet this trio with saxophonist Lotte Anker, pianist Craig Taborn
and drummer Gerald Cleaver does it.

[...]

This is the third album by the trio, and they get better with each release.

[...]

This album has it all : the mastership, the skills, the balance, the musical
baggage to draw from, the musical vision, the coherent delivery, the variation,
the adventure, the passion, the discipline, the raw emotional power, the
sophistication, .... Absolutely stunning.
