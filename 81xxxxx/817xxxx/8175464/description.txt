River Monsters Series 3
Jeremy Wade, biologist and extreme angler, is back with more investigations into the murky world of fishermen s tales. Jeremy investigates tales of frighteningly large and dangerous river monsters that have attacked and even killed humans. In this season, Wade catches the most bizarre and dangerous underwater creatures to inhabit earth, including a monster responsible for devouring certain male body parts in Papua New Guinea, and packs of eels that will rip the flesh from unfortunate swimmers. Jeremy s search for the truth takes him on a dark and dangerous journey across the globe to reveal that the truth is every bit as unbelievable as the myth.
"Perhaps my favorite part about River Monsters is that the program is entirely aware of the dangers that exist outside of the water when traveling to different continents. Jeremy Wade is always very culturally aware, and often has to tread thin lines when investigating animals in extreme locations. He is always eager to seek local knowledge, respect tradition and utilize the assistance of the community. When speaking to those who have suffered loss or injury he is sympathetic, yet composed and persevering."




3)  Silent Assassin 
Jeremy Wade travels to the Paran√° River in the remote northeast corner of Argentina to investigate the death of a young girl. Once there, he discovers a second death. The people who live along this river bank fear the creature they call "River Dog." This is a new species to Jeremy, a river monster that somehow got under his radar. His discovery is not only the most alien of all river monsters, it is also the largest totally freshwater river monster Jeremy ever has caught!
