Game Notes

A generation has passed since the glory days of racing in Downhill Night,
and those events have faded to nostalgic legend - but a new epic tale of
the need for speed, sex and romance is about to begin!

You are Akito, a college student who works part time to fund your addiction
to racing games at the local arcade. You're offered a lift one day by your
friend and coworker Rinka, a racer in her own right with the local Yotsuya
Four Knights auto club. When your pleasant drive is interrupted by a bad-
mouthing punk who challenges Rinka to a driving battle with her body on the
line, you're tasked with using your virtual navigation skills in the real
world - can you keep your cool under the pressure of a relentless downhill
duel, and win both the race and the girl?
