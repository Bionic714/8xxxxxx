300 is a 2007 American action film based on the 1998 comic series of the same name by Frank Miller. Both are fictionalized retellings of the Battle of Thermopylae. The film was directed by Zack Snyder, while Miller served as executive producer and consultant. It was filmed mostly with a super-imposition chroma key technique, to help replicate the imagery of the original comic book.

The plot revolves around King Leonidas (Gerard Butler), who leads 300 Spartans into battle against Persian "god-King" Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) and his army of more than 300,000 soldiers. As the battle rages, Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) attempts to rally support in Sparta for her husband. The story is framed by a voice-over narrative by the Spartan soldier Dilios (David Wenham). Through this narrative technique, various fantastical creatures are introduced, placing 300 within the genre of historical fantasy.

300 was released in both conventional and IMAX theaters in the United States on March 9, 2007, and on DVD, Blu-ray Disc, and HD DVD on July 31, 2007. The film received mixed reviews, receiving acclaim for its original visuals and style, but criticism for favoring visuals over characterization and its controversial depiction of the ancient Persians. However, the film was a box office success, grossing over $450 million, with the film's opening being the 24th largest in box office history at the time, and it has since developed a cult following.

Adaptación del cómic de Frank Miller (autor del cómic de "Sin City") sobre la famosa batalla de las Termópilas (480 a. C.). El objetivo de Jerjes, emperador de Persia, era la conquista de Grecia, lo que desencadenó las Guerras Médicas. Dada la gravedad de la situación, Atenas consiguió convencer a Leónidas I, rey de Esparta, para que participase con los atenienses en la guerra contra los persas. Así, el rey Leonidas (Gerard Butler) y 300 espartanos se enfrentaron a un ejército persa que era inmensamente superior.
