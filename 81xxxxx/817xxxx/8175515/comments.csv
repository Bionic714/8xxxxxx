,binderguy1,2013-02-22T15:37Z,"Appreciate you're trying to upload this torrent as I prefer cbr/cbz format to pdf, but for some reason I'm having a great deal of difficulty dl-ing this torrent.

Is anyone else having the same trouble?"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-02-22T16:10Z,"yeah unfortunately i'm stuck at ""downloading metadata"". it's strange 'cause it's showing dozens of seeders but in my peer list everyone's stuck at 0%"
,xombie76,2013-02-23T00:56Z,"I have the same issue. You can get it on KAT as a CBR, good quality, no issues downloading."
,erikdrakon,2013-02-26T01:48Z,sorry guys glad someone uploaded it in the cbr format
