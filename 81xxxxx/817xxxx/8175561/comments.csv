,Sicrift,2013-02-22T10:39Z,cool. : ) is this just before or after the dome?  do we miss out on much basically ?
[V],Gh0stNet,2013-02-22T10:40Z,People this is the only way you can play past mission 2 and as reloaded is internal so we cant expect them to release any crack fix for it 
,Sicrift,2013-02-22T10:44Z,from what i've read above that you wrote it sounds like we miss out on a whole level. 
,mahes3426,2013-02-22T10:44Z,good work pirate bay thank man
,Glibko,2013-02-22T10:44Z,а вторую миссию можно  и в интернете посмотреть :)
,bulletproofAllahuAkbar,2013-02-22T10:50Z,Its a shame. Mission 2 is the best looking map.
,bonethugnharmony,2013-02-22T10:50Z,seeding now !!!
,bulletproofAllahuAkbar,2013-02-22T10:52Z,"BTW, Any fix for us that cant start the game at all?"

,IzayaOrihara,2013-02-22T10:55Z,I think a large majority of the game takes place in the dome. It probably starts at after you get to that building seen in the mission 2 briefing.
