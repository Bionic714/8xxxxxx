On her sophomore full-length release, Oklahoma-based singer/songwriter Samantha Crain takes an 11-song glance over her young shoulder, each track the result of an interaction with a particular person, time and place. Not surprisingly, You (Understood) isnΓÇÖt exactly cohesive, scurrying from the wistful bounce of ΓÇ£BlueprintsΓÇ¥ to fuzzed-out guitars on broken-heart anthem ΓÇ£Two-Sidedness,ΓÇ¥ but Crain more than compensates through sheer earnestness. Like a prairie-bred, meat-and-potatoes Joanna Newsom, CrainΓÇÖs vocals are quivering, emotive and visceral. They shine when layered over the sparse beauty of ΓÇ£We Are the Same,ΓÇ¥ but fall a bit short when fighting through the guitar licks and wonky time signatures of ΓÇ£Toothpicks.ΓÇ¥
