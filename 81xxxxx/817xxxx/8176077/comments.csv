,wetbeak,2013-02-25T11:21Z,"dude!! it is awesome... some of  it is a bit weak, but thats due to ,you know changing writers and artists mid series!.. the best of it is fuckin' great. especially  all the kev walker ones plus volgan war vol 2 etc  which seems to have a tip o the hat other early brit comics  r.e panel and character composition.such as - revere the witch boy.. weird  one with cool art... have a quick look."
