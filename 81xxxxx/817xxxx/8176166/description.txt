Transporter The Series S01E08 - Sharks (Canadian broadcast)

Frank is competing with other drivers to deliver a briefcase from Paris to Marseille.

This episode (as broadcast in Canada) has not been released yet by the scene as far as I know. It was aired on Feb 15, 2013 on HBO HD Canada. Like all of my releases to date, the source is an analog rip, so the quality is, at best, something like A8 V8.
