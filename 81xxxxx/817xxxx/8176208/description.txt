 Karan and Neera are happily married living in London. At least that's what Neera thinks. Till she discovers Karan is having an affair. Ashwin is a painter hoping to strike it big someday. Sakhi, his wife is a high flying executive. Ashwin is unaware of Sakhi's affair with Karan till Neera knocks on his door. If the world was perfect they would have never met. Mr Singh/Mrs Mehta is a journey of a relationship that defies the moral fabric of Indian middle class values... A journey where lines between right and wrong blur... A journey that has no boundaries
