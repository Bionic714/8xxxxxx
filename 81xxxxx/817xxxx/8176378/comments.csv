,froggy321,2013-02-23T15:36Z,"Downloaded it, there are new games included in this one unlike the older one. Don't really have the anti virus program to be positive. Also, didn't need to run msnserver for most of these games...however their are some that I couldn't get to work."
,Slyve,2013-02-23T16:50Z,"@Eleison:

I don't know about the upload a few days ago, i got this from a site via direct download... forgot the name though... and made a torrent for it. I use Norton and it didn't detect any viruses.

@Froggy321:

Yeah, the ones that don't work are the protected ones, you need to follow the instructions in the description to play those, but most of them are unprotected."
,_Eleison_,2013-02-24T13:38Z,Good to know Slyve!
,WTF911,2013-03-02T10:07Z,"Very Nice, Thx so much! "
,ther00kie,2013-03-09T06:46Z,"Hey Slyve, do you think you could make a re-release? They've created a few more game recently like Street Games 2."
,Slyve,2013-03-18T00:18Z,"@ther00kie: You can find almost all of those games, and the few new ones, over at swfchan com (just search for ""mnf"" or ""Meet and fuck"")

I think there are just 2 or 3 new ones, and the newest isn't even cracked yet (to my knowledge at least), so it would be kind of a wasted effort to make a whole new torrent for just 2 games."
,Abimera,2013-03-19T19:36Z,"I did everything in the description, but some of games still asking for username and password. What I do?"
,Shariele,2013-03-19T21:14Z,"How do I get the other games to work?
In the ""mnfserver"" folder there are already games there and they show up in the browser when done as instructed. But how do I get other games that are not ""preinstalled"" to work?
I´ve tried a little myself in the config document but didn´t get it to work. Please help!"
,Shariele,2013-03-20T20:29Z,"I figured it out, must´ve been tired yesterday..
If someone else had the problem I described just rightclick on the name.SWF file and chose open with -> chose your browser and it´s done. I´ve tested both Firefox and explorer and both works fine. "
,daydou90,2013-03-27T17:16Z,thanks
,Fezman92,2013-04-11T17:53Z,Darn I hoped that these were Mac compatible. Oh well.
,jefersond,2013-05-15T07:08Z,"I missed The Iron Giant, anyone knows were i can download it?"
