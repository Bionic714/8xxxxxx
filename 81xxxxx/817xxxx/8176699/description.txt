On February 26th, Johnny Marr will release his first solo album, The Messenger; it's filled with Brit-pop melodies and reverbed post-punk jangles. "European Me" shimmers with guitars and bobs with a swaying snare beat, and "Generate! Generate!" barrels through with luminous textures and Marr's unstrained vocals. "New Town Velocity" slows things down in lush, meandering pop.
