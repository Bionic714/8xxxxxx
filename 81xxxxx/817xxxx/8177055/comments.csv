Thanks STFmaryville.

Why are these files only about 21 mb whereas all the DC/Marvel stuff are now about 45 mb ?  Are they a higer res scan  because I can't tell the difference on my tablet aside from it taking up more space ?"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-02-23T02:58Z,"you're welcome GMTN. yes, for instance this comic has 1280px width pages while LSH #17 that i posted earlier (53.6mb file) has 1920px width pages."
,GMTN,2013-02-23T05:36Z,Thanks for the answer.   All the files use to be half the size.  I guess it's for all the peeps with HD displays.
[V],STFmaryville,2013-02-24T01:34Z,"a lot of people leave comments about file size which are borderline rude. as an uploader, i have nothing to do with the resolution. i appreciate you for asking in a nice way.

(it's like going to mcdonalds and hassling the drive-thru worker about the size of your big mac.) we have no control over resolution or file size.

and then there are a few others who will complain when the files aren't big enough!"
,dbranson17,2013-02-24T18:43Z,asking questions is not being rude!  if you're that delicate why are you on the internet?
[V],STFmaryville,2013-02-25T04:03Z,"uh i'm pretty sure i'm on the internet to download and upload comics, not to listen to ungrateful cunts (not GMTN) bitch. ""how come these files are so big?"" ""can you post smaller files?""

when you are LITERALLY getting something for nothing, just shut the fuck up and be glad that you're lucky enough to get anything for free. that's not a delicate attitude, that's an indignant attitude."
