The Bionic Woman #8, hitting stores Feb 20th from Dynamite Publishing:

Is that a 90mm Matador rocket launcher, or are you just happy to see me? Jaime's search into the remnants of her past lead her to discover a high-school friend who has gone on to become an international weapons dealer, and a high-ranking member of the Russian "Bratva" mob's "most wanted ... dead" list! Can Jaime save her friend's life? And ... should she? And what part do the fembots play? It's violence in Volgograd, when the Bionic Woman comes to town!
