,tokaytokay,2013-03-02T03:23Z,Thanks so much for doing these uploads. Do you happen to have a source for season 5 from last year? It's the only season I'm missing and I can't find it anywhere.
,SC2Superbibi,2013-03-02T13:32Z,"If you type ""GSL 2012 Season 5 Code S torrent"" in Google, you should find what you seek. Haven't checked all the linked in detail but the one I did had all the Ro32 and some Ro16 so you should be able to get the whole season."
,SC2Superbibi,2013-03-02T13:37Z,I will upload GSL 2012 Season 5 later today on TPB.
