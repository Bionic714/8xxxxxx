,Street_Disciple,2013-02-22T20:02Z,Hey STFmaryville: What titles are you liking right now? You guys give us so many titles I can never decide what to read next. I saw you recommended Revival anything else your really liking?
,binderguy1,2013-02-22T21:12Z,"Thanks for the ul.

Is it possible for you to ul GODLAND # 1-36?
Don't think anyone has done a complete run of that title."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-02-22T22:14Z,"Street_Disciple, thank you very much for asking me. I'm going to go crazy with this answer, so ... First and foremost, if you held a gun to my head and said ""Name 3 comics that everyone should read right now!"" then I might pick Captain America, Chew and Revival.

Yesterday I read the new Thor: God of Thunder series from Marvel NOW. It's very good.

At home, I am currently reading The Nearly Complete Essential Hembeck Archives Omnibus, and I'm willing to bet anyone $20 that they will not scan it.

The next title on my list is Morning Glories, followed by either Saga or Fables.

I have to read these, whenever they come out:

All New X-Men
Avengers
Captain America
Chew
Daredevil: End of Days (limited series)
G.I. Joe - A Real American Hero
Hawkeye
Injustice: Gods Among Us
Rachel Rising
Revival
Savage Dragon
The High Ways (limited series)
Transformers: Regeneration One
Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man
Walking Dead
X-Factor

Here are my favorite titles from the past:

Astro City
Bone (preferably the Scholastic color trades)
Damage Control (series of 3 limited series)
Miracleman
Nth Man: The Ultimate Ninja
Planetary
Preacher
Spider-Girl
Starman
Supreme (#41 and up)
The Authority (up until DC censored it)
Twisted Toyfare Theatre
Y: The Last Man"
,Street_Disciple,2013-02-22T22:50Z,"STFm: Sweet man thanks for the thoughts, I find I tend to read completed series the most as I am to impatient to read a series one month at time as they come out. I will definitely check some of these out thanks again dude. Not a big DC fan?"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-02-23T00:06Z,"More of a Marvel fan, always have been. I think it's because when I was a kid, everything cool on TV was Marvel: Hulk re-runs, Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends, G.I. Joe and Transformers. So what happened? Marvel zombie.

I avoided listing pieces of an ongoing series like ""Byrne's She-Hulk"" or ""Busiek and Perez on Avengers."" But if I had, there would be more DC, like  ""O'Neil and Aparo's Batman,"" ""Sandman: Season of Mists,"" ""Mark Waid on Flash,"" ""Morrison and Porter's JLA."" And for awhile there (circa 1991-1998) I'd buy Superman every month. And this is like digital gold to me: http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8027882/
