While we know about the events that lead Jaime Summers to become the Bionic Woman, the details of her break up with Steve have been a mystery ... until now. Dealing with Jaime's injuries and long recovery have Steve on edge, but how will he react to the discovery that HE might have played a role in her accident? All questions will be answered in this stand-alone issue.
