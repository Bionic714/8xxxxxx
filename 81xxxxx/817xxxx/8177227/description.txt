Dark legends surround the old abandoned Blackwood House, secluded far away in the northern wastelands.

As he is drawn deeper into the story, his sleep is shattered by mysterious noises and he is plagued by nightmares that cross into reality.

Whose shadows lurk in the dark corners? Is that lonely house inhabited by restless spirits of the past or something more sinister? What is that sound that chills to the very bone, scratching?
