""Kinda fix"" instead of ""fix"" was just to make people laugh !! as the game was not working but then people started downloading it like crazy and now it is more funny then ever don't you agree?? "

Do this to start Mission 2 if crash:
( 1.) Run game crysis 3
 ( 2.) In menu Press the button ~ (tilde) to down the console 
(3.) Type Map canyon And Press Enter 
 Enjoy"

Try it, this is not bullshit like other post. This works to start level 2.
If someone get stuck at start to another level, you only need to know the level name and do the same.
Enjoy."
,MLO89,2013-02-22T18:44Z,"@palynzer, so you're saying map canyon is level 2 or is it level 3? Do you happen to know the names of all the maps?"
