Beautiful Tragedy ~V2 (min 172 kbps, max 208 kbps)
Blood more than V2, not quite V1 (min 194 kbps, max 221 kbps)
The Dream (Limited Edition) ~V3 (min 135 kbps, max 200 kbps)
A Star-Crossed Wasteland ~V2 (min 147 kbps, max 214 kbps)

No idea whether or not they are transcodes.

@Zen_: I would recommend putting the above information in the torrent description, if it's editable! =)"
