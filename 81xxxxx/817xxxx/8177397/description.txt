Welcome to Prep School!

ItΓÇÖs easy to be intimidated by a hardcore prepper with 30 years of food stores, multiple bug-out locations, and an off-the-grid power system. Prep School exists to let you in on three big prepping secrets.

SECRET ONE: Nobody starts perfect.
SECRET TWO: Prepping is fun.
SECRET THREE: Prepping isnΓÇÖt just for The End Of The World As We Know It.

Prep School is for people whoΓÇÖve been bit by the prepping bug but donΓÇÖt know where to start. YouΓÇÖll walk through introductory prepping lessons that wonΓÇÖt break the bank or scare your neighbors. Prepping doesnΓÇÖt have to be a big, intimidating ordeal. Prep School teaches you how to be social, learn interesting new skills, and sleep easier at night knowing youΓÇÖre ready for any crisis or disaster.

If youΓÇÖre an advanced prepper who could use a quick refresher on a specific topic you can spend 99 cents on a single essay. ThereΓÇÖs no need to waste your money or make you wade past information you could teach in search of the good stuff you need. If youΓÇÖre just getting started, you can pick up individual $1.49 books or save a little cash and pick up our $2.99 Theme Packs where we bundle related articles into a single book. Only buy what you need. Spend the rest on your preps.
