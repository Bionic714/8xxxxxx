( 1.) Run game crysis 3
 ( 2.) In menu Press the button ~ (tilde) to down the console 
(3.) Type Map canyon And Press Enter 

Try it, this is not bullshit like other post. This works to start level 2.
If someone get stuck at start to another level, you only need to know the level name and do the same.
Enjoy."

,EdyK9,2013-02-22T20:56Z,"- the ""canyon"" is the 3 mission.
- the 2 mission is ""fields""
if you open the console and enter: map fields it will load the map but freezes on black screen :(
- best if we wait for a better crack and enjoy the full game."

,raysefo666,2013-02-23T12:48Z,@truitaman  GOD BLESS U MAN!
,bonethugnharmony,2013-02-23T12:48Z,"@raysefo666, re-install your direct x. Make sure it´s current. Double check your .netframework and be sure you copied the correct crack to the master folder. If all else fails, you may not meet system requirements. Check you video card is at least 1GB.

When a re-pack comes out that is less heavy you may have better luck. It just sounds like your machine is not up to par and/or lacks drivers and software to get it off the ground. Good luck."
,bonethugnharmony,2013-02-23T12:53Z,@JoaoPauloBR...you don´t have to download the whole fucking torrent dumb ass...just the crack here. single it out and just download crack only. gadoy !!!!!

,eOnsp8ce,2013-02-24T09:21Z,"Guys anyone who has the CRYSIS logo pop up and then the game doesnt start.... this is how you fix it!

1 - Start the game, it crashes yes.. ok now go into ur C: Program Data folder and you will now see an Electronic Arts folder inside... DELETE it completely.

2 - Go into control panel and into ""System""

3 - Go to ""Computer"" tab where you can change your name and description... CHANGE BOTH names! the name of the computer and then the Description to anything... (ex:) ""fuckdapolice""

4 - Restart the computer

5 - Now start the game again it will crash again recreating the Electronic Arts folder once more... now delete the EA folder again one more time and Boot up Crysis 3

Brace yoself because now more CRASH! You can fkn play it now.. dont ask why this works it just does! GG people hope i helped some of you!"
