In this darkly comical look at the sinister side of our relationship with the natural world,
Stewart has tracked down over one hundred of our worst entomological foesΓÇöcreatures
that infest, infect, and generally wreak havoc on human affairs. From the worldΓÇÖs most
painful hornet, to the flies that transmit deadly diseases, to millipedes that stop traffic, to the
ΓÇ£bookwormsΓÇ¥ that devour libraries, to the Japanese beetles munching on your roses, Wicked Bugs
delves into the extraordinary powers of six- and eight-legged creatures.
With wit, style, and exacting research, Stewart has uncovered the most terrifying and titillating
stories of bugs gone wild. ItΓÇÖs an A to Z of insect enemies, interspersed with sections that
explore bugs with kinky sex lives (ΓÇ£SheΓÇÖs Just Not That Into YouΓÇ¥), creatures lurking in the cupboard
(ΓÇ£Fear No WeevilΓÇ¥), insects eating your tomatoes (ΓÇ£GardenerΓÇÖs Dirty DozenΓÇ¥), and phobias
that feed our (sometimes) irrational responses to bugs (ΓÇ£Have No FearΓÇ¥).
Intricate and strangely beautiful etchings and drawings by Briony Morrow-Cribbs capture
diabolical bugs of all shapes and sizes in this mixture of history, science, murder, and intrigue
that beginsΓÇöbut doesnΓÇÖt endΓÇöin your own backyard
