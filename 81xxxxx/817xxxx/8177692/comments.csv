[T],rugbybill,2013-03-02T13:00Z,"Downloaded rapidly for me Viciously, and loads of seeders too. It seems to me that you must have a badly configured client (or you are not connectable) as well as having an ungrateful and bad attitude. 
With insulting comments like that, it's no surprise to me that cappers and uploaders are getting harder to find.
Shame on you."
