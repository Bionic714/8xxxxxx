,Ipmark,2013-02-23T10:16Z,"You have three ways to update the map:
1) Buy a cheap 2/4GB SD, create a folder called Garmin and copy on it the gmapsupp.img Canada map. 
This is the safest way to avoid any compatibility problems.
When you are absolutely sure the new map is working fine, you have the other 2 options:
2) Add the new map to the internal memory.
For this you have to create a folder called Map in the root of the Nuvi and copy on it the new map.
or
3) Replace the preinstalled map in the .system hidden folder, in this case you have to rename the new map to gmapprom.img (as the old map).
Make a backup of the old map on the PC before delete it.

If you aren't confident with these operations, I suggest the option 1."

Thanks for UL Ipmark!! "
,Ipmark,2013-02-23T21:15Z,"No.
Map and additional files must have the same release number.
Wait tomorrow for a my torrent with 3DB-JCV-G2S-SQLite-TimeZone files of CNNANT 2013.40.

Stay tuned."

,Islandz786,2013-02-24T21:11Z,"Okay - so it has been a while since I updated the maps on my Garmin.  I currently have full North American maps, so would I just copy this new Full NA img over my current one and I'm good to go?"
,Ipmark,2013-02-26T10:36Z,"To avoid any problems, it's preferable to test the new map on a SD before to write it in the internal GPS memory.

If needed, rename the new map as the old one and overwrite it."

Thank you for all you do!"
,loveaudit,2013-02-27T17:31Z,Thank you so much Ipmark.  Your efforts are appreciated.
,nauskas,2013-03-09T05:05Z,"is it possible to just name them gmapprom.img, gmapprom1.img, gmapprom2.img gmapprom3.img etc and it works ?"
,nauskas,2013-03-09T05:15Z,"is it possible to add multiple maps on sd or internal memory
gmapprom.img
gmapprom1.img
gmapprom2.img
gmapprom3.img

Not sure its supported on all devices"
,Ipmark,2013-03-09T14:28Z,"Some Garmin models can read multiple custom map filenames, other models gmapsupp.img, gmapsup2.img, gmapprom.img, gmapprom1.img, gmapoem.img (in internal memory) and gmapsupp.img, gmapsup1.img (in SD card) only."
,dpippin01,2013-03-11T03:16Z,"I have a Nuvi 265w with traffic.  I added the new map (gmapsupp.img) to the SD card in a folder named Garmin.  I took off the old gmapsupp.img on the internal memory.  The new map works but I have lost traffic.  Any ideas?  Thanks, "
,chocolatemonkey999,2013-03-15T23:25Z,"Can someone help me?

I installed the full North America on my Garmin nuvi 265W.

When in USA, and I choose ""Where To"" and then try to change Province/State, I can't change it to a Province. I can only change to a State.

When I'm in Canada, and I choose ""Where To"" and then try to change Province/State, I can't change to a State. I can only change to a Provicne.

When in Canada, I'm able to browse the map to the USA, and I do see the streets, and if I choose to navigate to where my arrow is pointing, i have no problem.
When in USA, I'm able to browse the Canada map, and I do see all the street info, but I can even choose to navigate to where arrow is pointing.

But why can't the Where_To/Change_Province_State work?"
,LukeKrollhayd,2013-04-02T00:55Z,"My Garmin Nuvi 255W does not have enough room for the Full North America map, even after I deleted some of the languages that I don't need.  I therefore put that map on an SD card in a folder named Garmin.  My original maps I've already deleted from my Garmin's memory (after backing them up).  However, the Garmin does not find the maps on the SD card.  When I turn it on, it comes up as ""cannot find maps"".  For now I'm copying the USA only maps to Garmin's memory.  However, I really want to use the Full North America map because I will definitely be driving in Canada and there's some chance I might drive in Mexico.  "
,Ipmark,2013-04-02T03:31Z,"First, you have to update the Nuvi's firmware to the latest version using Webupdater tool.
The SD memory card MUST be fully formatted with filesystem FAT32 and preferabely not larger than 4GB in size.
Sometimes, for obscure reasons, some SDs refuse to work in a Nuvi.
To check this copy a POI file in the Garmin/Poi folder of the SD, if the SD is recognized by the Nuvi during the boot you will have a message about to copy the Poi in the internal memory.
If you haven't this message The SD in not recognized."
,cuzinjawn,2013-04-12T00:16Z,"I hope i can use this on my Garmin, I have a Nuvi 1250, hasn't been updated since 2010. Hopefully I don't screw it up, I only need the North America maps"
,cuzinjawn,2013-04-12T00:21Z,"hmmm...thought I commented on this but seems to be gone. Anyway I have a Nuvi 1250, hasn't been updated since 2010, hopefully i don't screw it up. I only will be using the USA maps"
