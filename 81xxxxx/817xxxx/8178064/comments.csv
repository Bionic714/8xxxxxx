,lostnights,2013-02-28T02:42Z,"audio is only 2 channel and to me it doesn't seem like the subs are correct (even thought they are for french only) as I know a little french and the don't ""sync"" up to me."
,jalucian,2013-02-28T22:07Z,"1) I never claimed the audio was 5.1. All my torrents are 2 channel stereo because, as it says in the notes, my torrents are intended for those who will be watching movies on their computers and most of those people don't have 5.1 surround.

2) I spot-checked the subs myself and they were synched, but I'll check them again. However, this is only torrent of this movie at the current time that has subs AT ALL for the French speaking parts."
,highresjunkie,2013-03-01T12:37Z,"Exactly what are you saying lostnights? The subs were perfectly synchronized and the translation was fine. And why would you even mention the audio when it wasn't ever advertised as 5.1 as Jalucian pointed out? Comments like this annoy me... instead of complimenting the quality and file size, you make up two things to complain about that aren't even valid complaints. "
,jalucian,2013-03-05T16:57Z,"Thanks highres. 

I went back and double-checked as I said I would lostnights. You're either confused or being deliberately dishonest. The subtitles are perfect."
,jalucian,2013-03-17T00:20Z,"Guys, we really need more people to seed. This is the only version on pirate bay in 720p with working subtitles, so please, consider seeding indefinitely, or at least as long as possible. Right now there's only two of us seeding and I have limited bandwidth. Please seed."
,dyslexikchicken,2013-03-23T16:59Z,"Yeah, lostnights doesn't know what he's talking about. The subs match up perfectly, and the quality of this encode is at least as good as the other two versions I tried, if not better. Jalucian really knows what he's doing. Hope to see a skull by your name soon!"
