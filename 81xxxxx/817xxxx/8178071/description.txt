Naiad is a state-of-the-art fluid simulation software product.

What makes Naiad different is that Naiad empowers small VFX companies (and even freelancers) to produce 3D fluid simulation animations that previously only large facilities with powerful in-house tools could attempt. How is this possible? Because Exotic Matter was founded by the people who used to write those powerful in-house fluid tools.

Despite being a relatively new product, Naiad has already been used to produce the 3D fluid animations in several motion-pictures, some of which are listed below:

Avatar (Weta Digital)
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 (Framestore London)
Narnia: Voyage of the Dawn Treader (Framestore London)
GulliverΓÇÖs Travels (Weta Digital)
X-Men: First Class (Weta Digital)
Final Destination 5 (Prime Focus)
The A-Team (Weta Digital)
Shark Night 3D (Reliant MediaWorks/Crater Studios/Shadow VFX)
Naiad is also being used frequently in TV series and commercials.
