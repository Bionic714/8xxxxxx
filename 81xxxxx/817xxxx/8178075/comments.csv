The film was made by people who love making movies, and funded mostly by ourselves, family & friends. It was made on a very small budget – a truly “independent” film. Sadly, it’s become incredibly difficult for independent filmmakers to make their money back on their films nowadays, and that’s certainly true for us.

If you enjoy the film and would like to support us, I’d like to ask that you please consider buying a copy on DVD. It has now been released in the US, Canada, the UK, Australia, and Germany, and is coming later this year to South Korea.  Or, you could also donate to us directly via Paypal, at our email address: midnightsonmovie@yahoo.com

Thanks, and enjoy the movie!"
