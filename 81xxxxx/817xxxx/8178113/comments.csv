,mi.tom,2013-02-23T04:24Z,finally.....thanx a ton bro...
[V],dhjudasx,2013-02-23T07:46Z,"hopefully everyone is patient... this has been the most leeches torrent to date...

To those out there waiting to experience 5.1 audio... Make certain you make the audio swap/change to the 2nd Audio stream and then double check the output mode.

PS3 users make certain to flip through the audio modes until 5.1 shows up.. you may have to wait approximately 30 seconds into the film before 5.1 finally fully triggers (ps3 detection)

For those on computers.... VLC for example gives you this option.

Depending on your hardware, HDMI connected audio solution will guarantee the best results without issue. But I must still stress.. make certain to change the audio track/stream to 2 and then double check the output mode is 5.1"

,joser116,2013-02-23T23:15Z,Please upload Life of Pi! :) That movie deserves a 1920x1080 full HD rip
[V],dhjudasx,2013-02-25T08:17Z,wow thanks to all the seeders.. 600.... all time high
,antispamstar,2013-03-02T04:06Z,Does this movie have SDH subtitle? It is for deaf or hard of hearing people who can't hear or recognize voices and background noises. I'll waste no time downloading a movie without SDH subtitle. Thanks.
,TheBrenton,2013-03-02T10:33Z,"@antispamstar
you can download the subtitles separate.
try subscene.com"
[V],dhjudasx,2013-03-04T21:26Z,"antispamstar

Sorry these do not include the Hearing Impaired version of the subtitles.

I actually take the time on all my encodes to remove everything that is in brackets that describe certain audio related specifics.

You can still download the movie and get the hearing impaired version of the subtitles from various subtitle website though."
,jungcookie,2013-03-10T07:37Z,Thanks a whole bunch:)
,salcemx,2013-03-11T17:55Z,"First of all, thanks to judas, seriously, thank you so much for taking the time of uploading this files.

Review:

I have downloaded i think 4 torrents of judas, and i must say they are totally watchable, i like the idea that the files are just only around 3GB.

Video: 8 (personally i dont care about black bars, actually i like black bars, but on the 4 torrents i have downloaded, there is small pixelations sometimes, mostly on black scenes, i think this could be fixed if he makes the files a little bit higher so they can have a little more quality to be a 10, 5GB file will be ideal)

Audio: 10 (because I have excellent hearing, I'm not very demanding in this particular area, so i have watched the movies without any audio problems at all, and i can hear everything just fine.)

Bottom line, this files are almost to perfection, wich i think they will be in time, but i recommend you to download them because you cant ask for more for free for a 3GB file, if you want a 100% Quality Blu ray with no pixelations you should buy the original blu ray or download a 15-20 GB file.

Anyway hope this review gives you an idea, i tried to be honest and writte a constructive review, thanks judas, great work."
,Tailgun,2013-03-12T15:42Z,Does this rip have HC English subs for the non-English scenes?
[V],dhjudasx,2013-03-12T21:45Z,"Skyfall doesn't have much for non-english scenes..

However unfortunately no there are no hardcoded subs in this movie... "
[V],dhjudasx,2013-03-12T21:55Z,"salcemx, Thanks for the overall review.

Some movies take to compression in the dark scenes very well.. others do not... it really seems to depend on the way that they mastered and transferred to bluray. Some movies that i expect to look UTTERLY terrible the whole way through because it's a dark movie surprise the hell out of me because they end up encoding so beautifully, no soft color/shade banding or occasion pixelation to find. I think the first underworld i encoded is a good example of this.

Bumping up the Bitrate however i've learnt hasn't been able to resolve pixelation issues without making a more significant jump... We are of course talking about compressing a movie that the combined M2TS files weigh in at anywhere between 20gb for the lower quality or short film... to as much as 35-38gb for the higherend films like lets say Avatar which i think was 44GB for just the movie.

What i would LOVE to do is demux the video in 10bit or even 12/14 bit and then encode it into 10bit rather than the current 8bit.

However Even brand NEW tvs and devices won't play it... it's unsupported device.

As an example.. the little bit of pixelation you see in this encode would be mostly eliminated by the move from 8bit to 10 bit as it would provide another set of color/shade steps for all scenes... you then would rarely if ever generally notice any kind of ""compression"" effects short of REALLY paying attention to it.

Just kinda sucks i can't use it. I did some test encodes to try and various devices.. and basically for the most part... it only allowed computers to play it...

One thing i have noticed however is that comparing to netflix and Satalite/cable broadcasted 1080p content or even 720p content..... they have significantly more pixelation on those HD Movie channels than my encode. It's rather surprising considering how much netflix now dilivers for bandwidth. I suppose they haven't ""re-encoded"" many of the netflix HD movies using a newer format perhaps."
,salcemx,2013-03-21T08:22Z,"Great judas, cant wait for your new releases, thank you very much also for the time to respond, when you can, please upload the box 2009 i havnt found that movie :(!!!"
,jonaskuba,2013-04-18T19:34Z,"Hello, I love ur torrents and I would like to ask u: Can u upload The Hangover One and Two?? I would appreciate it "
,AnimeRip,2013-05-04T14:12Z,"Best rips ever man! Just asking, I don't want to start doing like you because it just takes too much time, but what GUI do you use? Thanks man, appreciated."
[V],dhjudasx,2013-05-09T19:35Z,"I generally recommend Staxrip for a gui.. but my encodes are usually done using my own custom scripts I've setup that I tweak PER movie.

Thanks for the other comments, I'll upload only what I can when I can..."
