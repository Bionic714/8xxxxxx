,Puddl3s,2013-02-24T18:19Z,I'm getting some major graphical glitches with all the entities. You might want to check this out and reupload or fix it if you can.

Alpha < Beta < version 1.0"
,Puddl3s,2013-02-25T05:34Z,I understand that. I tried out several others and the windows version and I'm still getting the bug. I guess we'll have to wait for the devs to fix it.
