,Criminai,2013-02-27T17:28Z,"Thank you! Ghostnet's torrent wouldn't work but your torrent did. Also, just a heads up for people reading, Bloody palace's difficulty does progress. I died at level 84-85 because it switched to DmD and those bloodhounds raped me."
,davespen,2013-03-01T06:16Z,"Works great! However, and it's not exactly a big deal, my previously installed costume DLC is gone now. :-/"

,jocastus,2013-03-19T05:35Z,"Not sure about why I can't change costumes after having updated here either. If someone wants to share what the secret is, I'd be grateful."
,DracoRyx,2013-04-07T18:03Z,How do you fix the classic costume? I can't stand dante's new emo-bitch style.
,IzayaOrihara,2013-04-24T11:23Z,"[COSTUME FIX, COPIED OFF SAME TORRENT ON A DIFFERENT WEBSITE]

For those having the issue regarding loss of costume open your C:Program Files (86)DMC Devil May CryBinariesWin32steam_rld.ini in notepad youll see this: AppId=220440 DLC001=229080 DLC002=223792 All you have to do is add DLC003=223790 directly under the lines labeled DLC001 & DLC002... Save it and you are good to go. Granted this will give you the costumes so long as you already installed that DLC. Hope this helps everyone out that lost there costumes after installing this update and DLC"
