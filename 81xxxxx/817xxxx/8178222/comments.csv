,AtiGamer,2013-02-22T23:14Z,"@Gh0stNet 
I have downloaded your Crysis 3 torrent and the Crysis 3 logo comes up and disappears without the game window coming up as it should.  I mounted the DVD 1 iso first, then double clicked it, installed it two times in Program Files and Program Files x86 (Only difference were the images that pop up when I click Crysis 3 exe to launch game)  Then it asked for the next dvd, so I unmounted disc 1 and mounted disc 2 and clicked ok, It continued to extract, then I clicked exit on the Installer... copied the all the crack content from dvd 2 into the bin 32... disabled crysis 3 from connecting to the internet and last I went into the __Installer/directx folder and installed directx11 and confirmed it was installed... The game will not even start... Alienware area51 with Ati HD graphics card Intel 6 core i7 16gb ram windows 7"
,Foppski,2013-02-22T23:17Z,"Iv tryed it, instead of the game freezing at mission 2, it fucking crashes.... "

,Gedimas,2013-02-22T23:38Z,"Didn't work for me. :( Is that because of windows 7 64bit? Because I get some error that says it's not compatible with 64bit version of windows, when I try to run crysis.exe."
,AtiGamer,2013-02-22T23:49Z,PLEASE ANSWER MY QUESTION!!!  I'VE UPLOADED MORE THAN 20GB FOR THE GAME NOT TO WORK!!!!
,iztari,2013-02-23T00:10Z,"This works like a charm, if it does not work remember to install:

1) Latest DirectX
2) Latest Virtual C++ 2010
3) And as usual: Update Graphic Drivers "
,notdone23,2013-02-23T00:12Z,"I tried it and it let me continue to mission 2, but now seems that a very needed gun has 0 ammo. So Essentially almost the same as not working at all. "
,Mafu11,2013-02-23T00:21Z,Works perfectly. Thanks a lot Gh0stNet!
,novashipp,2013-02-23T00:47Z,"Mission 5 still crashes
also this gets rid of (really just renames) rldea.dll which the game won't start without, so I had to manually put it back."
,Plasros,2013-02-23T00:53Z,ss
,Plasros,2013-02-23T00:54Z,"@notdone32 I found a fix for the 0 ammo gun
download this trainer:


Now what you need to do is extract this trainer - then load up the game into the mission, afterwards alt tab and run the trainer as administrator, then go back inside the game press F5 and press it again."
,Plasros,2013-02-23T00:55Z,"Go the Mediafire and input this after .com /?7qw3rdlajxvknpi
"
,Plasros,2013-02-23T00:57Z,"This works 100% because I had this same issue like you of the alien weapon with no ammo, remember to press F5 two times before firing the weapon or else the game will crash. Enjoy!"
,kodyj88,2013-02-23T01:09Z,put file in main folder not bin and dont run as admin
,truitaman,2013-02-23T01:25Z,"Hi,

The game launches and appears the crysis3.bmp , after that it returns to desktop, it didnt really leave the dessktop at all, it did work just once the first time, and after that not anymore.

Any idea? How i can solve this?

My hardware specs are okey.

i got a GT650 i5 3rd gen 2.9 8 gb memory"
,Irlydont,2013-02-23T01:49Z,"I don't get it please someone give me a answer.

,MasterUryi,2013-02-23T02:57Z,@Plasros how can i undo the infinit ammo after i destroyed cannons ?
,Sheevz0r,2013-02-23T03:06Z,"For people like AtiGamer, who can`t launch the game at all: I got it to work. After installing it several times without a successfull launch I installed the game to the default directory d/games/crysis 3 for me. I had to rename the letter of the partition for the duration because I had D for different use, but it works afterwards when I changed it back too. I also copied the mounted images content to my harddisk before installing, but I don`t thing that matters... After that, by using the provided instructions of the reloaded release the game launched for me. Hope this works for someone. Peace."
,truitaman,2013-02-23T10:07Z,"plessure:

try this:

2. Open Internet Explorer (this will only work with Internet Explorer, not other browsers). Enter the following address into your address bar and press ""Enter/Return""

C:ProgramDataElectronic ArtsEA ServicesLicense

3. Delete the file named either 71067.dlf or 70619 or 71069.dlf (i deleted everything)
