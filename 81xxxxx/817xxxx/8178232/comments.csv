,jitengful,2013-03-02T08:47Z,"everything working so far so good expect (Adobe Media Encoder CS6) is supposed to be replace by a 64 bit amtlib.dll instead of 32 bit. Also after replacing Adobe Encore CS6 with a 64 bit amtlib.dll i get a message when i try to open it

(Adobe Encore CS6 cannot run in non-royalty serialized mode. The application needs to be
serialized with a royalty bearing serial number.

that the only two issued i have. Thank you for the great collection"

,BrunoSardine,2013-03-10T23:31Z,"'WORKING' , my ass. I've uninstalled and reinstalled this at least 20 different fucking times only to get this every time on every app:

""Please uninstall and reinstall the product.

If this problem still occurs, please contact Adobe technical support for help, and mention the error code shown at the bottom of this screen.

Error: 1

""PUP.RiskwareTool.CK""

ASSHOLE!"
,drizzerker,2013-05-21T02:32Z,So is there a virus in this thing or what?
,drizzerker,2013-05-21T02:35Z,Is the virus file one that can be avoided?
,serverhack,2013-05-22T19:01Z,"It works for me, the amtlib.dll for all and then the patch for Encore CS6 included in indio profile at youtube. THAAAANKKKSSS!!!!"
,bilditup1,2013-05-27T08:20Z,"Guys: if it has a crack, it's going to be flagged as potentially dangerous by your AV software. How do people still not know this and continue to bitch about it without any actual proof positive (e.g. their shit getting stolen or computer getting fucked up)?

What I want to know is, if I update the software am I screwed - will amtlib.dll be overwritten - or no?"
