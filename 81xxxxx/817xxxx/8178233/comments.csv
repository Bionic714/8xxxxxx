Yep. Skidrow is the worst offender. And I mean actual scene group not the shitheads with websites claiming they have something to do with scene. Best example that comes to mind is ac2 emulator that was made by guys ac cs.rin.ru were a whole bunch of people collected data and pulled together then skidrow smacked it all together and tagged it as ""better"" and theirs too. I laughed at stupidity and shittyness that scenes are spewing nowdays. Forgot last time skidrow managed to do something actually challenging that wasn't stolen or worked like shit in a bucket.

,hisazul,2013-02-22T23:53Z,"For all the people with those preloaded versions.
This is why you don't donwload that nonsense. It hardly ever works unless group that released it also released crack and left overs needed and most importantly registry installer.
Most likely cause why its not working? You got nothing in your registry about crysis 3... how the heck would it find its own files then? Magic is not likely to happen. We are long over games that did not need specific registry paths."

_Installation
got both dx installer and vc installer.
vc is a 32bit version of 2010 distr. So everything is there.
One thing shove this game where origins would install it by default. Granted shit can go wrong if poorly signed things are ran from program files under 7+... but well... u get what you ordered lol."

Im on win7 64bit.
Running latest dx11 and nvidia drivers 310.90
Got both vc 2010 32bit and 64bit.
Install path is to non-system folder to make sure protections don't get bitchy and anal. Never install games into Program Files or any system paths on win7+ if you plan to use 3rd party apps on files. Will cause more problems then I would ever care to deal with.
Thats it... at least for internal dvd release. But again make sure vc is installed game will never run w/o it and make sure your vgpu is dx11 compatible or this game will not run. While its true there are some dx10 leftovers in files I doubt it would be a simple matter to enable support for it."

,hisazul,2013-02-23T00:21Z,"And since crysis is most likely using tessalation make sure your video drivers aren't the reason why game crashes.
Check event logs if any drivers are crashing and ur card is dx11 make sure you have proper voltage on it.
Example. witcher 2 with superior grafics on default factory card settings would be baby ass smooth with fully maxed out everything. dx:hr would crash eventually. Reason? witcher uses dx9 needs a lot less juice. hx:hr while less stress its still dx11 and because factory voltage was somewhat low for tessalation that was reason why it crashed."

As for voltage, I pumped 1.200 as opposed to the default 1.000 and what I use (0.987), it still crashes. Beginning to lose my mind here.

if you read past comment you would have known the fix for not having ammo..
but i will say it again, DO NOT just ""Resume Campaign"" with this crack fix... you MUST start a New Campaign, select Replay Mission.. and choose the second mission.. Now the Sniper rifle will have ammo(its some kind of glitch when resuming the game with the original crack)
OR get a trainer that adds ammo works too!!"

you get that Dx11 GPU error because  your GPU doesn't have Dx11. You can NEVER get crysis3 to work unless you upgrade.
