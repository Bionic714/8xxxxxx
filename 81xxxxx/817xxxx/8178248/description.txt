Good Will Hunting is a 1997 American drama film directed by Gus Van Sant and starring Matt Damon, Robin Williams, Ben Affleck, Minnie Driver, and Stellan Skarsgård. Written by Affleck and Damon, and with Damon in the title role, the film follows 20-year-old South Boston laborer Will Hunting, an unrecognized genius who is forced to see a therapist (Williams) and study advanced mathematics with a renowned professor (Skarsgård) in order to avoid jail time for assaulting a police officer. Through his therapy sessions, Will re-evaluates his relationships with his best friend (Affleck), his girlfriend (Driver), and himself, facing the significant task of thinking about his future.

Good Will Hunting received universal critical acclaim and was a financial success. It grossed over US$225 million during its theatrical run with only a modest $10 million budget. It was nominated for nine Academy Awards, including the Academy Award for Best Picture, and won two: Best Supporting Actor for Williams and Best Original Screenplay for Affleck and Damon.

Will es un joven rebelde con una inteligencia asombrosa, especialmente para las matemáticas. El descubrimiento de su talento por parte de los profesores le planteará un dilema: seguir con su vida de siempre -un trabajo fácil, buenos amigos, muchas cervezas y alguna bronca- o aprovechar sus grandes cualidades intelectuales en alguna universidad. Sólo los consejos de un solitario y bohemio profesor le ayudarán a decidirse.
