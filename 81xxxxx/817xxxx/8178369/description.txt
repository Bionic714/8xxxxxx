The Vonbluvens Show was a White Nationalist podcast from a neo-Nazi point of view that ran on and off from 2002 to 2008.  It remains an intersting timecapsule type snapshot of the world of the NS movement as it existed at the time.  Sadly, copies of the original podcasts can be a bit hard to find these days in no small part due to the orginal host having disavoyed the show and working to "scrub" the internat of all references to it.  It' unfortnate to see anything go down the memory hole like that, so I am providing a fairly complete archive of the shws for download in three seperate torrents.

This is the third part of the collection that covers the shows that were released after the original host broke with the National Socialist Movement.  This is often known as the "Bill White Era" due to most of them having been produced for the ANSWP under White's direction.

As always this torrent is being provided for historical research and amusement value alone.  It does not nessisarly represent the views of the seeder.
