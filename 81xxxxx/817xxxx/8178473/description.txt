For all you that miss or still enjoy the old 2004 Filteria sound; I am bringing you the Sky Input Remixed EP. All these tracks were made 2003-2005. They have been remastered though to make them more balanced in the frequency spectrum. However I have left my trademark sound in there from that era. This release will be available atand other online stores on Thursday (2013-02-14). I would like to mention also that there will be more unreleased stuff coming digitally, a 4th Filteria album and also a K.O.B. album. I hope you will enjoy it!

Tracklist:
1. Operation Pulse (Remix)
2. Stars (Warped Remix)
3. Navigate (Pitch Down The World Mix)
4. The Snuggling Snail (Live Remix)
5. Ultimator (Ultimated Remix)
6. Operation Pulse (Live Remix)
