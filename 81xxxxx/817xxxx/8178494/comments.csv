,Miatakias83,2013-02-23T23:34Z,guys what must i do to play??there is nothing to unzip...and there is no ISO.....how will i install it??
,xgatto,2013-02-24T02:25Z,"I can't get it to work. It crashes on startup with the typical 'stopped working' message of Windows. Crack was installed properly as far as I know, its only 1 file."
,Samotom,2013-02-24T08:07Z,"@Miatakias83: Its a bin file instead of ISO, pretty much the same. Just ""Open with..."" with Daemon Tools. "
,mmsandi,2013-02-24T13:52Z,Walking with A+D doesn't work for me.

associate first file with Rar, 
then extract to a specified folder, 
open daemon tools, 
mount the Cue file on that folder, 
PLAY!"

,LgnLOL,2013-02-28T16:21Z,"Ok guys, i've found the problem.
You need Windows Media Player installed on your pc in order to run the game.
At least it worked for me, tell me if it works for you too :D"

,bb7891,2013-02-28T20:04Z,"I had windows media player installed already, but it was turned off in ""Control PanelAll Control Panel ItemsPrograms and Features -> ""turn windows features on or off""  -> 'media features' -> windows media player

game works now"
,Zamzumin,2013-03-01T01:11Z,"@LgnLOL
Fuck that, I'm not getting Windows Media Player just to play this game. Does anybody know a work around? How to fool the game into thinking that WMP is installed?"
,LgnLOL,2013-03-01T13:01Z,"@Zamzumin I don't think it's possible. The audio is based on wmp files or smth like that, try to search the discussion on the steam forum."
,zkteh,2013-03-03T09:01Z,"@LgnLOL , @bb7891

Help .... =( 
I already have my WMP pre-installed in my PC .. 
and i check in Windows Feature , it's enabled ..

,angma,2013-03-03T17:37Z,"It really doesn't look as if WMP is the problem. I've had games on steam install XNA before, so I'm not having problems. WMP is completely disabled on my Win7 x64 box."
,zkteh,2013-03-04T09:43Z,"@angma 
Yeah , u are right ..... 

but the main problem is my VIrtual Drive Program not supporting .bin/.cue   

Daemon Tools Lite helped me =D 
- just remember to apply the crack ( steam_api.dll ) 

To Uploader , if u have time , pls convert to ISO format ..... "

,minastirith,2013-03-29T15:57Z,"Extracted after changing to .rar and mounted in PowerISO... access denied, can't even install it. Sigh what a waste of time. "
,minastirith,2013-03-29T15:59Z,"Ignore my previous comment, you need to right click the .exe and run as Administrator. "
,blackdragon13,2013-04-20T21:04Z,When I try to mount it with Daemon Tools Lite it shows nothing to mount.
,blackdragon13,2013-04-20T22:33Z,Shows nothing to mount when using Power ISO either.
