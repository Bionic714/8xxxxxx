INFO
_____________

We are proud to be back with another fine release for your pleasure!

This is a very easy menu driven way to play Giana Sisters Twisted Dreams.
The Menu System helps you through the install, crack and config of the game.
You can then start Giana Sisters Twisted Dreams with the push of a button.
There's an option in this App to install updated DirectX files if needed.

This release also features a retro package we created which makes it possible 
for you to easily play the old classic Commodore 64 and Commodore Amiga 
versions of the game. We went a little out of bounds and also included 
the wonderful Classic Team 17s Amiga SuperFrog platformer.

As an added Bonus we have included a Remix music package which many of you 
and especially retro gamers will love. We havent changed any in-game music in
the Giana Sisters Twisted Dreams, this is just an extra stand alone Remix kit.

Enjoy :)

ABOUT THE GAME
_______________

Maria is abducted to the Dream World, where a giant dragon holds her prisoner.
It is now up to her sister, Giana, who has become a teenager in the time
since the last entry in the series, to enter the Dream World and rescue her.
Because she is in a stage of her life that is all about transformation,
she has learned how to manipulate her dreams.

She must use this newly developed ability to jump between dreams and
transform herself into a "Cute" and "Punk" persona in order to deal with
her inner conflict and fear while she searches for her sister.

As in the past, Giana can pick up crystals for points and discover secrets.

User Score on Metacritic 8.3 / 10
