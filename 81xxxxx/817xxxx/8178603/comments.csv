,PrepaidRUs,2013-02-23T18:13Z,I think that I like the Sampler recordings the best out of everything from Windham Hill's catalog.  It introduced me to several artists I would have never heard any other method.  These are such high quality recordings and it would be a shame to only hear them in MP3.  You are doing the Lord's work here Anon.
