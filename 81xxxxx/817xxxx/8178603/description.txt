Windham Hill was truly hitting its stride in 1981-82. It took four years for Ackerman to release the first nine Windham Hill Albums, and of those, only six remained in print. Numbers 14-23 came in just over a single year, and each became a defining album for the label ΓÇô either the first release of important new artists such as Liz Story, or genre-establishing discs like Alex de GrassiΓÇÖs Clockwork. Sampler ΓÇÖ82 excises one track from each of the nine discs that Windham Hill released since the initial sampler came out in 1981.

Side One opens with the rather somber ΓÇ£RemediosΓÇ¥ and continues in a generally solemn vein throughout the side, with HedgesΓÇÖ ΓÇ£The Happy CoupleΓÇ¥ being the happy exception. Side Two picks things up a bit, and ends with the upbeat ΓÇ£Clockwork,ΓÇ¥ an ensemble piece which will be familiar to any Windham fan today thanks to its appearance on countless samplers since its initial release.

Ackerman was enraptured with the new digital technology of the time ΓÇô his album Passage was one of the first commercial digital releases in the world. Each of the tracks here were remastered in digital ΓÇô at some expense to the dynamics, detail and warmth of each of the recordings. Indeed, only ΓÇ£The Happy CoupleΓÇ¥ benefits from the increased detail and brightness of the remastering. Nonetheless, unless youΓÇÖre a die-hard vinyl fan with a revealing system, the sound quality is still excellent.

In the end, IΓÇÖm sure Sampler ΓÇÖ82 has its fans ΓÇô it was the first introduction to many of these artists for many tens of thousands of people. However, the album is a broad overview rather than a cohesive statement of where the label was at the time, and each of the albums represented are strong and complete on their own. Nonetheless, while I do hesitate to second-guess AckermanΓÇÖs selections, for the modern listener, I would recommend you skip this one and buy the individual albums from the era. Sampler ΓÇÖ82 is an important snapshot of Windham HillΓÇÖs development, but not necessarily the place to start as a listener.
