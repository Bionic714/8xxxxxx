This early episode of Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse was Rod Serling's 
first attempt to launch The Twilight Zone, and first post-Life of Riley
appearances by character actor William Bendix in the lead role. 

CBS didn't buy the time-travel aspect for a series pilot, so they instead commissioned a very different story: "Where is Everybody?" with Earl Holliman 
and that sold instead....but didn't get on the schedule until a year later.
