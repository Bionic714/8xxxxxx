,therealtommyjay,2013-03-03T15:57Z,"@PuffysPlace @jonnysniperfilms Hey guys, I installed the metro pack on both windows and osx, in both i used the lic generator from element which worked for me. But when i tried installing it on another OSX machine, it said still kept asking for a license. Not sure where the problem is though, sorry :("
,jinjala,2013-03-08T09:47Z,"sorry mate, it just says that metropolitan pack is unregistered, when i install this with cracked element 3d and select scene set up on after effect, it just asking to register, but i try to register with same keygen of element 3d which produce request file and keygen produce license, but it doesnt work too, i am on mac os 10.8 and after effect cs6, and yes pro shader pack works great which i got downloaded earlier on torrent, thanks "
,vipervince,2013-04-09T22:49Z,"I downloaded the complete file. Element 3D is allready installed.
The Metropolitan Pack does require a licence. There is no key included.

Do you have it or not?"
