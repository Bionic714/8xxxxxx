,binderguy1,2013-02-23T03:19Z,"May the MAKER-OF-US-ALL-IN-THE-SKY bless your spirit!

Thanks so much for the ul, STFmaryville!

If it's not pushing my luck, would a COYOTE/I AM COYOTE run (and/or THE JUDAS COIN) be possible?"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-02-23T04:08Z,"Hamster-X and thecardmonster you're welcome

binderguy1, you're welcome, and coyote, maybe. but it'll be at least a few days. (i have to be AFK this weekend.) i know a ton of people want the judas coin, but i still can't say that it's been scanned. if it has, i certainly missed it!"

[V],RubrumPopulus,2013-02-25T19:39Z,"Nice work on this STFmaryville.  FYI: I sent you a message in the forum.

tpbbabu:  Peter & Max is Willingham's prose novel. That isn't a comic book... It is a good read though, so I recommend it. But it's a prose novel.  And what is Fables #18b??"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-02-25T21:55Z,"Just an update, I have all the Coyote issues now but am stuck at 99.8% for the color I Am Coyote collection. I'm waiting to see if it completes. If not, I'll post the Marvel series with a link to the black & white Eclipse Magazine torrent."
