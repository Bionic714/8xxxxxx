I Get This Call Every Day is a personal tale of unwinnable realities. It is a telephone conversation made interactive in a point and click format. It presents, quite literally, what it says on the tin: a particular type of call that its creator regularly deals with in his day job. Players make dialogue choices that either allow them to lose in the slightly soul-killing way he does every day, or in a far more spectacular fashion. It is a lightly filtered experienced pulled from his daily life, with which anyone who's ever worked in customer service can relate.
