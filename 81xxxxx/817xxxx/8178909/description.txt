A Course in Miracles, Third Edition, as published by Foundation for Inner Peace; includes Text, workbook and Manual. Appears to be retail quality. Source is mobi; epub and pdf are calibre conversions from mobi. I tried to format the pdf so that it's reasonably useful, unlike typical calibre-generated pdf files.

Note: there are numerous versions of ACIM on tpb and elsewhere on the web, but most are the so-called "ur-text" or public domain version. The version here is not the ur-text; it's the version most widely available in bookstores, etc. There are debates about the differences between them, but if you're looking for the "Foundation"/Ken Wapnick edition, this is it.

The torrent also contains the two volumes of The Plain Language A Course in Miracles, as translated by Elizabeth Cronkhite, in epub and mobi. The titles are The Message of A Course in Miracles (volume 1) and Practicing A Course in Miracles and The Way of A Course in Miracles (volume 2). Formatting appears different in each one, but both have a retail source. The purpose of the books is to restate the central teachings of ACIM in "plain language."
