,JazzIzChrist,2013-02-23T03:17Z,What?!?! For PC now?
,PseudoPositive,2013-02-23T03:54Z,"Does it emulate well?, this might be a bit heavy for some rigs. I tried to play the game Black, frame rate was ok, but it has too many video glitches to play properly, maybe this runs ok, I'll will check it out."
,chrisroberts3,2013-02-23T04:00Z,"Yeah man. It runs through a PS2 emulator, mostly for medium to high end PC users only."
,Lardzor,2013-02-23T23:02Z,"I just tried this. It was not worth it for me.  Corrupted graphics and garbled sound in game.  Cutscenes were choppy with  choppy sound as well. 

My specs:
Win7 x64 Ultimate. w/6GB DDR2
Core2 Duo 4.0 Ghz
Nvidia GTX 560 2GB"
,MAA11792,2013-02-24T05:48Z,@Lardzor what did you expect? It's a poorly made game and a cheap console port.
,nignug,2013-02-24T10:31Z,Ha might try this just for fun. I hope one day we can get Heavy Rain to emulate onto the PC.
,MAA11792,2013-02-24T11:28Z,@nignug the hell with Quantic Dream. They suck ass.
,spyderx810,2013-02-24T14:41Z,"This is an EMULATOR, not a pc port. Expect it to run and play like shit."
,MAA11792,2013-02-24T15:38Z,"@spyderx810 indeed, my bad, back to old 1.0.0"
,aarJunn,2013-02-24T17:32Z,"How do I play it with my Mouse & Keyboard?
I request you to post a simple solution..."
,nignug,2013-02-25T12:15Z,"@MAA11792 Indigo Prophecy is still one of my favorite games. It is bullshit though that they went exclusive to Sony. Sony sucks when it comes to video games, especially non-MP games."
