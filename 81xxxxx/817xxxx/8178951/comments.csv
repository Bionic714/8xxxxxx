,Mertonoia,2013-02-23T07:52Z,My favorite! How did you do that?! Thank you so much.
[T],pharmakate,2013-02-23T08:18Z,"@mertonoia - That's very gratifying -- and you're welcome. There's more to come, & if you have interests in this topic generally, feel free to request anything you can't find elsewhere."
,Mertonoia,2013-02-24T17:00Z,"@pharmakate, I can't tell you how much I'm enjoying your contributions. For months now i've taken everything you UP because your taste is always exquisite. Now that you're adding my favorite works by my favorite writer I'm feeling the deepest gratitude for you. I'd be thrilled to return the favor if there's anything you might be seeking. I wonder if you've you read Gilead by Marilynne Robinson, or her first novel, Housekeeping."
[T],pharmakate,2013-02-24T21:10Z,"@Mertonoia - It makes a BIG difference to me knowing these are appreciated. Thanks. My intention is to post good books that are unjustly neglected & that I would like if I found on tpb. My list of ebook ""wants"" are mostly things I'm preparing to scan myself. But I'd be delighted to find more good Irish literary fiction -- O'Brien, McGahern, Lavin, Kevin Barry, Frank & Joseph O'Connor, Sean & Nuala O'Faolain, etc. Marilynne Robinson's been on my ""to-be-read"" list for years ... I need to read her. Thanks again for the encouragement!"
,Mertonoia,2013-02-26T13:59Z,"Thank you, pharmakate. Such sophisticated taste! I have the strength of ten librarians, though, and take this on as a personal quest. : ) You've made an inestimable contribution here. It would be a real pleasure to surprise you."
[T],pharmakate,2013-02-27T01:20Z,"@Mertonoia - Ha! I will indeed be surprised if you come up with this stuff. But if something was on demonoid, or is on usenet or the other usual places, I very likely have it, e.g., William Trevor. Thanks in any case!"
,Mertonoia,2013-03-16T17:42Z,"Indeed, pharmakate. I'm chagrinned but must admit failure here. If there is anything else you're seeking please don't hesitate to post it here. While I have all the Merton in print, there's nothing like having one's dearest things in one place and mobile. Never mind all the other fantastic titles you've turned us on to. Just imagine how many people will have been enriched by these now and for many generations hence."
[T],pharmakate,2013-03-22T21:32Z,@Mertonoia - I hadn't checked this for a few days ... Thanks for looking for those authors. If you have a nice version of Gilead I'd love to see it. The only one I've come across is badly formatted. If you don't have it I'll scan my own copy soon.
,Mertonoia,2013-06-04T12:16Z,"@pharmakate - So sorry I missed your request for Gilead. I do have many of these but, alas, I don't have a good scanner. I'll try with the old one I do have if you'll tell me your secret for making the pages so straight and free of the binding curve, for lack of a better word."
