Ed Wynn and Keenan Wynn re-create the behind the scenes drama leading up
to another anthology series Playhouse 90 airing "Requiem for a Heavyweight"
3 years earlier, where they had scenes together as old-time comedian Ed 
worked in a drama for the first time!

Lots of famous actors, producers, and writers played themselves 
including Rod Serling, director Ralph Nelson, Red Skelton, Ned Glass,
and boxer turned actor "Slapsy" Maxie Rosenbloom.

Ed, Red, and Ned in one show! Too bad they couldn't get Jack Palance.
