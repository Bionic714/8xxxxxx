  Retreating from the hazy Danger Mouse-fueled pot dream of Attack & Release, the Black Keys headed down to the legendary Muscle Shoals, recording their third album on their own and dubbing it Brothers. The studio, not to mention the artwork patterned after such disregarded Chess psychedelic-era relics as This Is HowlinΓÇÖ WolfΓÇÖs New Album, are good indications that the tough blues band of the Black Keys earliest records is back, but the group hasnΓÇÖt forgotten what theyΓÇÖve learned in their inwardly psychedelic mid-period. Brothers still can get mighty trippy -- the swirling chintzy organ that circles ΓÇ£The Only One,ΓÇ¥ the Baroque harpsichord flair of ΓÇ£Too Afraid to Love YouΓÇ¥ -- but the album is built with blood and dirt, so its wilder moments remain gritty without being earthbound. Sonically, that scuffed-up spaciness -- the open air created by the fuzz guitars and phasing, analog keyboards, and cavernous drums -- is considerably appealing, but the Black Keys' ace in the hole remains the exceptional songwriting that Dan Auerbach and Patrick Carney are so good at. They twist a Gary Glitter stomp into swamp fuzz blues, steal a title from Archie Bell & the Drells but never reference that classic Tighten Up groove, and approximate a slow ΓÇÿ60s soul crawl on ΓÇ£Unknown BrotherΓÇ¥ before following it up with a version of Jerry ButlerΓÇÖs ΓÇ£Never Gonna Give You Up,ΓÇ¥ and itΓÇÖs nearly impossible to tell which is the cover. And thatΓÇÖs the great thing about the Black Keys in general and Brothers in particular: the past and present intermingle so thoroughly that they blur, yet thereΓÇÖs no affect, just three hundred pounds of joy.
