==========================================================================
||									||
||		PROGRAMME NAME: Gold Rush (Formerly Gold Rush Alaska)	||
||									||
||		CHANNEL: Discovery Channel				||
||									||
||		ViDEO LENGTH: 1h27m26s					||
||									||
||		NOTES: Here's the season 3 finale of Gold Rush/Gold Rush||
||		Alaska. Thanks to all the release blogs that posted	||
||		our caps when the scene or BALLISTIC didn't yet and also||
||		to the downloaders who didn't complain that the quality	||
||		is lower than normal due to the fact that it's capped	||
||		from an SD channel and not HD. We love you guys&lt;3	||
||									||
||		I'd say congrats to whoever hit the motherlode but I'm	||
||		only halfway through season 3 so I didn't watch this	||
||		yet. :P							||
||									||
||		See you next season, maybe! (there will be a season 4!)	||
||									||
||		Included in this release of Gold Rush Live is everything||
||		from the actual show to the live and non-live segments.	||
||									||
||		And once again it's not overcropped...letterboxed on SD	||
||		and as a result part of the "LIVE" thing at the top was	||
||		not on the actual show (just black) so we cropped it	||
||		out. The only thing actually cropped out are a few 	||
||		tweets that appeared in a ticker under the actual show.	||
||		Unimportant and doesn't change what you're watching.	||
||									||
||		Still reading? Hah. Since you're actually reading this	||
||		I might as well say sorry that it's late. Usually we up	||
||		Gold Rush within 10 minutes of it airing but towards	||
||		the end it was noticed cropping was done wrong by a few	||
||		pixels and when the new encode finished	we accidentally	||
||		deleted it which led to 20 long minutes of waiting...	||
||		But we did it right finally. Cropping is correct and	||
||		we didn't delete the file. :D				||
||									||
||		Still reading? Stop. Seriously. We're UNPOPULAR and	||
||		we're bored.						||

||				ABOUT:					||
||									||
||		UNPOPULAR is a lame P2P group. We have a few		||
||		drawbacks such as releasing late and in low quality.	||
||		We're in it for the fun and not to please you.		||
||									||
||		We're here to bring you shows the scene or P2P don't.	||
||		(even though the scene hates when you leech their	||
||		releases - we're just fascinated with them)		||
||									||
||		All caps are analogue and SD television unless stated.	||
