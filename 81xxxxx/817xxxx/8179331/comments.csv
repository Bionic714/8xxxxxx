For 700mb this video is great quality.

V10/A10 , considering small file size.

There is an .idx ,but no .sub so I got an error in VLC and no subtitles. 
However, the srt file you can down load from here( http://subscene.com/subtitles/jiro-dreams-of-sushi/english/592208 ) works perfectly with the movie"
,codak29,2013-03-17T20:16Z,"Ditto, no subtitles. zen4153's fix works though. Right-click and ""open file"" the .srt file."
,gabriel1475,2013-04-12T08:59Z,"still, after all this time, people still go through all the effort of putting these files up, and yet offer NO FILE INFO whatsoever.

seems about as counter-intuitive as anything can be."
