Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site :: On the Friday, February 22 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex blasts Michael Moore's gun control solution for people who are worried about their safety: "get a dog." 

Alex will also cover Law Enforcement Target Inc.'s removal of their offensive "no more hesitation" shooting targets, and the concerted efforts to demonize returning veterans as right-wing extremists. 

Alex also examines the Pentagon's floating military bases possibly opening the door for sinister black programs and operations to be conducted under the impunity of the high seas.

Note: though not mentioned at all in the official show description, today's broadcast runs a full four hours, with pharmacist Ben Fuchs (one of Alex's Youngevity partners) taking over as a guest in the 3rd hour and a guest-host for the 4th hour.
