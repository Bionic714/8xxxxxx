Anyhow, thanks for the upload."
,lontrus,2013-02-23T16:43Z,karven4  TS is a cam if you didnt know it 
,cbisme,2013-02-23T18:25Z,"TS = Telesync = The syncing of one video source with a separate audio source. More often than not, a CAM is the video source, but not always. Could be a foreign language video source (Cam or other), synced with another language audio source (Cam or Line). "
,nesperi,2013-02-23T18:37Z,Det här är en jätte bra fim såg den på bio för en timma sen ska ladda ner den nu

IT SUCKS WHAT FOR A TS"
,erraticchevy,2013-02-23T19:21Z,"@lontrus A Ts is Telesync if you didnt know dumbass. Its a cam with line audio from usally a better source.
So by Definition this is not a TS ""lontrus"" Its just a cam

Cam Scale 1-10 (not in a scale with dvd quality)
Cam Video 6
Cam Audio 2"

,karven4,2013-02-23T20:06Z,"Have to say I don't like the tone in some of the comments. Even though someone is wrong, and the fact that we are anonymous.

Anyhow, fetched from wikipedia: ""A telesync (TS)[1] is a bootleg recording of a film recorded in a movie theater, often (although not always) filmed using a professional camera on a tripod in the projection booth, the audio of a TS is captured with a direct connection to the sound source (often an FM microbroadcast provided for the hearing-impaired, or from a drive-in theater).""

,jayleneglamour,2013-02-25T14:56Z,"Thanks for effort and upload, video quality is amazing for a cam, unfortunately the audio only worked for 5 seconds for me (MAC-VLC). Wouldn't play audio through other players for me either. Maybe better luck to Windows users.. Great video quality though. The search continues. 
Can anyone upload IDENTITY THIEF ? Or The Company you keep?? European release only trailer looks amazing!!! Need to watch "
,WingZing,2013-02-25T21:38Z,This is not a TS as you can hear background theater noise. Focus went out during the finale action scenes. Can't see any of the action going on during that time.
,CaptPugwash,2013-02-26T00:40Z,"Now now fellow Pirates calm down!!
So much hate is going on over something that is FREE & something that Tykoon123 has gone to the trouble of recording & uploading for the entertainment of others.
Having done this, all that some Wankers can do is fucking moan. You fucking ungrateful Bastards!!
I'm not saying don't score the quality, coz that is very helpful. But don't abuse the Uploader coz at least he / she has gone to the trouble of doing it for YOU!!
Once I've downloaded said film & watched the offering I shall return to score.
So, THANKYOU Tykoon123.
Oh, one other thing.... Fuck right off & die you miserable spamming Fuck-Wits!!!! Thankyou."

@lontrus A Ts is Telesync if you didnt know dumbass. Its a cam with line audio from usally a better source.

DONT CALL ME DUMBASS
you say it your self that it is a cam
i know that ts is cam recording and sounds is with line or with other source audio

it does not matter if the cam is professional or not the video is still recorded in cinema that makes it a CAM 
TS has usually better quality then the early cam's that are recorded in public

next time you call someone dumbass you should back it up with facts
rite now you are the dumbass cause telesync is still a cam but with other source of audio where video quality is still cam recorded in cinema"
,RafVne2,2013-02-26T18:15Z,"v-7 very good for a cam.
A-4 distant, and kind of echoing.

Sounded more like cam, then a TS... 
Telesync usually has better audio.

I couldn't get into the movie,
@tykoon123
Thanks for the effort anyways.

,xxjaretxx,2013-02-27T10:32Z,"Thanks abunch Man! Ive been around for years on TPB this is the first comment i have ever left. I am going to post this comment or one similar on all of the popular shows and movies I get. The MAIN REASON FOR MY POST IS I WANT TO TELL/REMIND EVERYONE THAT THE ""COPYRIGHT ALERT SYSTEM"" was launched yesterday. Most of the major isp's are involved, AT&T, TIME WARNER, VERIZON, and CABLEVISION, along with many others. SO GET BEHIND A VPN if you don't want your ISP dropping you for copyright infringement. Supposedly u get around 5 warnings then they drop you.  Just a friendly heads up to all you Pirates! here is a link to a news article about it, pretty basic column. :: http://news.yahoo.com/pirates-beware-industry-isps-launch-copyright-alert-system-000744092.html PROXY VPN or ""Borrow"" Wi-fi from the neighbors for your downloadingl I had a VPN in the past but it made my downloads drop DRASTICALLY so I currently looking for the best VPN or other option where I can maintain a decent speed. I appreciate the work you put into uploading, and the sourcing that goes into it. You seriously rock man, Keep up the Great work!"

,ato080,2013-03-01T22:07Z,Just DL'd it to PC w/VLC.  NO AUDIO!
,krimsonater,2013-03-02T14:04Z,"this is definitely not ts, first of movie you hear crowd talkin, and phones ringin, which I coulda forgave, but jeez, it's a crap copy. 
a=4
v=3
real real real bad copy. sux.
ts, stands for telesync which should mean that audio is from a different source than the speakers inside the theater. shouldn't hear crowd. just for those who might not know, cuz, at one time I didn't. and may still not. but I understand it to mean that ts represents a quality audio source, at least. reasoning being that with slightly poorer image quality, inherent in cam's, the audio would make the experience better overall. again, this is not ts."

,Chuckfist,2013-03-04T18:51Z,"@m0h1th

You are so lame. 
To mention you use a mac makes you look like a complete idiot. Shitcunts, n00bs, simpletons, etc use a mac. Don't be so proud of that"
,Starpass,2013-03-05T18:20Z,It's a pretty good attempt with what you had to work with. Not DVD quality but damn close. The only problem is with the color. It is definitely not up to par; but thank you for doing the work.
,crustykid,2013-03-06T03:00Z,no audio after the first couple seconds. using a new acer netbook and vlc media player.
,Zeusvolt9,2013-03-12T02:49Z,"Quality made it unwatchable for me.  Thanks for the upload though.  I appreciate the effort.   Seriously though, I really do......no sarcasm"
