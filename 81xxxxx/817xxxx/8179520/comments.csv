,potvinsuks,2013-03-03T05:02Z,"Dude thanks, but could you at least respond to weather you have part 8 or not?  Several peeps have asked already.  I mean its 8 parts and not just 7 right?  Thanks."
,karamorama2,2013-03-06T02:20Z,"Thanks, but the 7 parts here are around 6 GB,  on the Mega Scenery Earth website, the total state size is around 22 GB.   Do you plan to upload the whole state?.  "
