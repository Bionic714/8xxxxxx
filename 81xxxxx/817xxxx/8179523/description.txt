Originally formed in 1997 to lead worship for the first Planetshakers Conference held in Australia, the Planetshakers band is passionate about uniting generations worldwide through worship. Their goal is to see people encounter God, be transformed by His presence and empowered to make a difference in their world. While they tour internationally, the team remains based out of Planetshakers City Church, a multi-campus, 7,800-member congregation in Melbourne that is pastored by husband and wife, Russell and Sam Evans.  The church is the fastest growing church in Australian history.
