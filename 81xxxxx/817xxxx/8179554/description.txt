I am a huge fan of Maroon 5 and when I found out that they were a totally different group before they were what they are now, I was anxious to hear what I could of their older stuff.  It took me a while, but I was able to locate two albums. If you have a link to any other songs that I do not have included, please leave a comment. Thank you and enjoy!
