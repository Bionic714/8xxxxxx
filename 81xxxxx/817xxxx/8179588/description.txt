Sex in Troubled Waters: Ralph is a big star whose slightest actions and gestures cause a field day with journalists. So, when Ralph is on the verge of singing a fabulous $ 12 million contract. The Signore Stratos, a hemiplegic "godfather" who runs a ruthless organized crime outfit decides to seize the gold mine. In the end, he kidnaps the star's proxy. It's how beautiful Lea, mistress of one of Stratos' lieutenants, meets Alain, a hardworking sales rep, who is the spitting image of Ralph. Immediately, Stratos sees what he can make of this striking resemblance. He tries to lure a naive Alain with a brilliant acting career and offers him the leading role: in exchange for a comfortable salary, he must take Ralph's place at the time the contract is signed. Stunned, Alain sees no harm in it and accepts.
