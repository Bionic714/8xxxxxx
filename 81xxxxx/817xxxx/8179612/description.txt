Last night, in his State of the Union speech, President Obama claimed: "both parties have worked together to reduce the deficit by more than $2.5 trillion - mostly through spending cuts".

I have this dream - one where my president walks to the podium, and he instead says this:

I'm so happy I won again. Now that I don't have to suck up to my base, I will be the grown-up in the room...

I looked at the numbers, and they are scary. I made so many promises that there's no way we can pay for them.

Take climate change. I think it's real and that man contributes, but even if America spent trillions to try to lower our carbon output, that would only make a microscopic change in world temperatures. The earth wouldn't notice.

Some of my anti-poverty plans are worse. Now that I've been re-elected, it dawns on me that those programs I said need more investment - always more - well, they didn't work. They perpetuate poverty by making Americans dependent.

The key to helping the poor - and being rich enough to adjust to things like climate change - is growth.

The rest of my dream speech here. You can watch a version of it on my show on Fox Business at 9pm ET this Thursday.
