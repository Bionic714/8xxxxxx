This week, STOSSEL takes a special trip to Washington, D.C. to hear from more than 1,000 students who want to advance liberty.

Former New Mexico Governor, Gary Johnson, and Cato Institute's David Boaz will answer student questions and discuss the future of the Libertarian party.

Students ask Representative Justin Amash about the travails of libertarians in Congress.

We'll also hear from Huffington Post's Radley Balko about out-of-control swat teams.

The students grill Republican Ann Coulter about drug laws and gay marriage. Then they'll take on Democrat Dennis Kucinich for saying "Social Security is rock solid through 2032 without any changes whatsoever."

Finally, former UN Ambassador, John Bolton, defends Obama's drone strikes.
