Criticism of the Western Civilization - Collection 29 (Media Deception, Spin, Control):

"Night after night audiences are terrified and titillated, aroused and manipulated, but not informed. Like an unbalanced diet, which gradually can lead to serious illness, the local TV news threatens the health of our community." -- Paul Klite, former executive director, Rocky Mountain Media Watch.

Media deception, manipulation, cover-up, and control exist in all societies. Its nature and purpose may be political, economical, or religious. In a small or third-world country, its effect is limited and localized. In a major (or superpower) country, the effects could have global consequences.
