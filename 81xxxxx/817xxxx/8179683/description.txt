3 one page text files which do what they say:

Bit Torrent - A Non Technical Guide
A Guide to Good Torrents
A Guide to Super Seeding

As you will learn, you too can have fast download speeds as long as you remember not to run more than two torrents at any one time and regulate your upload speed correctly so as to leave 30% headroom for communication between yourself and the swarm...  so simple, so not understood if average swarm speeds are anything to go one these day sigh..

Oh and Micro Torrent Users - We know you are not technical, but do you know that Micro Torrent is way too generous with the number of upload slots it give to each swarm.... Again it is all in these 3 very short text files.  Half of being smart is knowing what you are dumb at..

After this Bit torrenting will NOT BE ONE of those :)
