Having spent nearly two decades creating uniquely affecting music defined by folk and rock flourishes, personal sentiment and 

a voice that channels Neil Young's falsetto highs and the wavering, raspy lows of Leonard Cohen, Hayden now signs to Arts & 

Crafts for the release of his seventh full length.

Us Alone is a subtle, emotional and sonically warm journey written and performed by one of Canada's most consistent artists. 

A welcome addition to a brilliant career.
