,Leeski,2013-02-23T11:24Z,"hope the 720 version will come out also, but thanks for this ;)"
,drhank,2013-02-23T23:29Z,"The correct episode title is ""Strange Abductions,"" which is show onscreen and was also posted at zap2it.  Great cap, but doesn't anyone read the episode titles, which are clearly displayed?  Seems like others simply copied tNe's incorrect title."
,craddle,2013-02-24T18:35Z,Incorrect title.
,gcrimez,2013-03-01T04:17Z,"Change title.
Other than that thanks."
,cormaczoso,2013-03-11T07:03Z,"then change the title after you download it you worthless pudknockers ... jesus, whine whine whine ... 

thanks for the upload ... it was really easy to find even with the horribly incorrect title that nearly made it impossible to search for ...you know, like searching for 'ancient aliens s05e09' ... yeah, really threw me for a fucking curve ... jesus christ i don't know how you motherfuckers get thru life ... how do you handle a malfunctioning stop light? just put the car in park, turn it off, leave the keys in the ignition and wander out into nature trying to survive on the cheese stuck to the inside of disposed of pizza boxes? 

thanks again for the upload :)"
