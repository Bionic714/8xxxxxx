[V],HeroMaster,2013-02-23T14:52Z,"If the game does not start, use these faqs for solving it:

- Remove the Electronic Arts folder located here C:  ProgramData
                                                                      - Rename the computer, for example, was ""Freeman-PC"", and therefore ""Freeman"" (And that was not Russian letters, such as ""Sasha-PC"")

- Remove the computer Microsoft Visual C + + 2010 and install Microsoft Visual C + + 2010 x86 Redistributable - 10.0.30319"
,itakmaszraka,2013-02-23T15:25Z,"Did that. Before I had black screen, now when I click exe, after logo nothing happens."
,s1raz1,2013-02-23T17:33Z,"Its 2047...
When all hope is lost...

HeroMaster to the rescue :D"
,bombaii1,2013-02-23T18:04Z,"Now I got to the game Menu, using this torrent and then I used the Crysis.3.Crackfix.INTERNAL-RELOADED for crack.

But now I get blackscreen lol. Soooo much problems with Crysis 3. But I thank you uploaders for all your hard work! Keep it up :)"
,s1raz1,2013-02-23T18:34Z,"Thing is Half the people still dont get that this game --REQUIRES DX11--
 So any pc thats  still dx 9-10 based wont have a chance period.
How do u see ur DX version?
 just run dxdiag and laugh or cry."
,salmanbari86,2013-02-23T18:59Z,Most of the ppl here don't realize that Crysis 3 is a DX11 game!!! Your DX9 and DX10 card won't run this game until Crytek brings a new exe file that supports DX10 Graphic cards...We are screwed until than...
,senjudo,2013-02-23T19:31Z,thank you HeroMaster even befor i get download it and instal but i trust your post they always work ;)
,flawlessly,2013-02-23T22:39Z,"@s1raz1 that's the thing. that app says DX11 is my current directx version. but another app (gpuz or wtv) says my gpu only supports dx10. my question is... dafuq ? i've been able to play everything that came out recently, so it's kinda stupid i can't play crysis 3 because of that"
,TurtleGuy,2013-02-23T23:12Z,What graphics card are you using flaw?
,flawlessly,2013-02-23T23:47Z,"@TurtleGuy GeForce 8600 GT

it even says in Nvidia panel that i have dx11 installed. But in GPU-Z program, it says it only supports dx10/SM4.0

anyway you can help ? i can run all the recent games besides this one..."
,ColdNeutron,2013-02-24T01:35Z,"@flawlessly
You need DX11 installed on your PC AND a DX11 capable graphics card, meaning Geforce 400 series/Radeon HD5000 series or newer. Your 8600GT is only DX10 capable. Nothing you can do to run the game other than buying a new graphics card."
,Cerebral222,2013-02-24T02:29Z,"Thanks HeroMaster, I finally got this working. I got the black screen also, inspite of my graphics card being DirectX 11 ready; if your getting black screen, go the games main folder, and open the ""system"" CFG file with WordPad and you will notice that the language is set to russian, even though you installed it as english, change it to english, it should look like this:

Job done  :)"
,MLO89,2013-02-24T07:56Z,End boss invincible with current crack. No one will finish this game until this is addressed.

,ineedanswers,2013-02-24T16:21Z,"@cerebral222 thanks, editing the cfg file worked.  B4 I got black screen with music and could only see mouse pointer, but after doing your steps from Russian to English for last 2 lines, it started perfectly :)

""eOnsp8ce at 2013-02-24 09:19 CET:
Guys anyone who has the CRYSIS logo pop up and then the game doesnt start.... this is how you fix it!

1 - Start the game, it crashes yes.. ok now go into ur C: Program Data folder and you will now see an Electronic Arts folder inside... DELETE it completely.

2 - Go into control panel and into ""System""

3 - Go to ""Computer"" tab where you can change your name and description... CHANGE BOTH names! the name of the computer and then the Description to anything... (ex:) ""fuckdapolice""

4 - Restart the computer

5 - Now start the game again it will crash again recreating the Electronic Arts folder once more... now delete the EA folder again one more time and Boot up Crysis 3

Brace yoself because now more CRASH! You can fkn play it now.. dont ask why this works it just does! GG people hope i helped some of you!"""
,VGTGBubs,2013-02-25T01:24Z,"Props to this guy an all his uploads. Gotta love him. Also the EA Russia stuff uses a non-origin installer. That means you don't have to go through a DRM wall.

I.E. Upload EA Russia installers to save a lot of trouble."
,toaz,2013-02-25T04:17Z,"I don't know about you guys but i downloaded this and installed it but inside the Localisation folder i only have Russian.pak no English inside and that's the cause of crashing when i changed it to english in system file. For those who don't have English.pak , change it back to russian and install Crysis.3.Crackfix.INTERNAL-RELOADED"
,cyberdude83,2013-02-25T19:53Z,"So installed , in 5 minutes. BUT requires DX11 video
