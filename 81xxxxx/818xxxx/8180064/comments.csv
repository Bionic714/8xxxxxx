,dubai1991,2013-02-23T11:38Z,"GOOD NEWS! CRASH AFTER LOGO FIX!!!
I found it on a russian forum, I did not believe it would work, BUT IT DOES!!!

1. Delete the folder ""electronic arts"" from C:ProgramData
2. RENAME YOUR COMPUTER (whoa... what does this have to do with the game, bro? well.. I haven't got the sligthest idea, BUT IT WORKS!!!)
!!! I'd try something simple, only english characters, max 8 char, just to be sure
3. You will be asked to reboot, do it!!!
4. PLAY!!!!

HOLY CRAP FINALLY, I'VE TRIED TO FIX THIS FOR HOURS!!!!"
