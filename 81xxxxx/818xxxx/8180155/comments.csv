,saint84,2013-02-23T17:47Z,"not true . same audio , same crap . video okay . so you are a liar . i dl that move and saw nothing different "
,johnkb528,2013-02-23T20:23Z,"yeah its the same shitty audio. i did reverse stereo with 2 pass soft preset & it was best i could get it. the wrapper noise is annoying, but you could understand what is being said at least"
,twlght,2013-02-24T04:15Z,"the Russian version is best audio/video i have seen so far there is no talking/moving and noise BS.
Just wish there was English version as good as Russian :/"

,AriGold45,2013-02-24T16:14Z,"I always watch CAMs instead of waiting on something better, and I never complain about the quality of them.  Having said that, I couldn't watch but about ten minutes of this because I couldn't hear the audio.  VLC doesn't work on my computer and the program I use doesn't have an equalizer so I couldn't fine tune it.  It sounds like it was filmed inside a tin can and you can't understand what is being said most of the time.  Wait for better audio"
,cheekyaussie,2013-02-25T06:45Z,"thx to the uploader for taking the time.
To all that complain all the copies are the same with the exception to the Russian so quit yr bitching and learn Russian or get over it they didn't have to upload anything

video can be dark at times and audio is very tinny if u are persistent it is watchable I've seen worse 
V:5
A:3"
