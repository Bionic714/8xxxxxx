 The physical focus of this yoga lesson plan is a balanced approach to backbending strength, and the broader focus is finding a deep inner strength that supports everything we do. This practice balances traditional fitness notions of back strength with awareness of developing a strong, steady breath and a quiet mind. Maya Yoga Vinyasa Fusion is the synthesis of Vinyasa style yoga with the heightened sense of awareness that comes from studying alignment principles. Filmed on the beautiful island of Maui, Nicki Doane - in collaboration with her ΓÇïΓÇïhusband, Eddie Modestini - takes you to the next level while offering the flexibility of time commitment to your practice.
