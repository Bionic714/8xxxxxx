,EU_User,2013-02-23T14:06Z,"The quality!! And many didn't use DTS.
Compressing of a DVD from DVD-9 to DVD5 e.g.
with AC-3/6:               87%
with DTS/6:                82%
with AC-3/6 & DTS/6:  75%"
[V],Mr.Stifmeister,2013-02-23T14:29Z,"Yea as EU_User says, its about quality.
Sometimes you want better video quality and then it goes with AC-3 only.
And sometimes the video quality still can be pretty good if you include DTS.
Thats how it is :)"
,xxLotusxx,2013-02-23T23:31Z,"Thank you for your explanation ;) 
Of course it will affect the quality when it uses more space, too bad 87 down to 75%...but good sound is half the experience. Hope there will be more to come with DTS, anyway ;)
I can imagine if the movie is 2 hours or more, the result would probably not be good picture."
