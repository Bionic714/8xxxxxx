Great Quality..good file size for 'dark/smoky/steamy' scenes..real smooth.

Also..imho..good movie.

This is..for me..the second 'not big budget hollywood' film that actually does it right.

If you liked 'The Objective' for example..for surprising level of technical realism with weapons etc..then you'll probably like this one too."
