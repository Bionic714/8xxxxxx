Thank you for all you do!"

,bullfeathers,2013-03-09T17:07Z,"I have tried loading this file into my Garmin Street Pilot C320, via an sd card, and it keeps telling me the ""file is locked"". I have loaded these files before, with no problems. The last was NT 2011.20.
Thanks"
,Ipmark,2013-03-11T02:24Z,"gma protection?
Unlock the map again with gimgunlock

ht_tp:_/_/w_ww_.me_dia_fir_e.c_om/_?b7i_htir_uio_y2e_hp
(remove underscores)

Drag the map over the tool"
,bullfeathers,2013-03-11T19:02Z,"First, let me thank you for all your uploads and help.
I must be getting old and senile,,, but when I connect my GPS to the computer I get this message ""No unlocked maps were found for this device."" 
On the GPS I have the message ""Please use the provided PC software to load maps.""
I downloaded ""gimgunlock"" as suggested, but when I run it it just flashes the screen and I cannot find any evidence of the program. 
Thanks again.
PS. I'm not having fun, any more,,, LOL."
,Ipmark,2013-03-12T00:13Z,"For your C320, crop with Mapsource a map and send it to a SD card (2GB max.)

gimgunlock simply remove any lock from a map without any message, in a ""DOS box flash"".

It's really fast, isn't it? "
