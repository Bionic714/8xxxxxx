And here you go, an old goodie that Fantagraphics finally released in English in 2011. The Arctic Marauder, by Jacques Tardi.
This is an important book, both as an early steampunk (or rather, icepunk) book, but also for its amazing artwork, made to look like woodcuts.


In our ongoing quest to showcase the wide range of Jacques Tardis bibliography, Fantagraphics reaches all the way back to one of his earliest, and most distinctive graphic novels: A satirical, Jules Verne-esque retro-sci-fi yarn executed on scratchboard in a stunningly detailed faux-woodcut style perfectly chosen to render the Edwardian-era mechanical marvels on display. Created in 1972, The Arctic Marauder is a downright prescient example of proto-steampunk science fiction - or perhaps more accurately, and to coin a spinoff genre, icepunk.

In 1899, LAnjou, a ship navigating the Arctic Ocean from Murmansk, Russia, to Le Havre, France comes across a stunning sight: A ghostly, abandoned vessel perched high atop an iceberg. But exploring this strange apparition is the last thing the sailors will ever do, as their own ship is soon dispatched to Davy Jones locker via a mysterious explosion.

Enter Jerome Plumier, whose search for his missing uncle, the inventor Louis-Ferdinand Chapoutier, brings him into contact with the sinister, frigid forces behind this - and soon he too is headed towards the North Pole, where he will contend with mad scientists, monsters of the deep, and futuristic submarines and flying machines.
