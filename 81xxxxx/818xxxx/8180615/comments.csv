As for the ""Speed Limited"" that is said at the bottom of the application, ""Professional(Speed Limited), that is because this is not an official released version. It is a version that has been modified and released on the Internet by a third party, which, in some places, is called a cracked version. As they must pay expensive server bandwidth fees, they can only offer the dedicate server with the paid Professional Version, for users to enjoy high-speed download services. The Professional (Speed Limited) and Free Version utilize a similar download server and bandwidth."
