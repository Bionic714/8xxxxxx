Created by Angela Santomero, the creator of Blue's Clues and Super Why!, Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood is a new animated sequel to Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood, where all the original characters from the Neighborhood of Make-Believe are now grown up with their own preschool-aged children. The series centers around a four-year-old Daniel Tiger, son of the original Daniel Striped Tiger. Other characters include Katerina Kittycat, O the Owl, and Prince Wednesday. Two 11-minute episodes are linked by a common socio-emotional theme, such as disappointment, sadness or anger. The theme also uses a Musical Motif phrase to reenforce the theme and help children remember. The series is co-produced by The Fred Rogers Company (formerly Family Communications) and Out of the Blue Enterprises, with animation produced in Canada by 9 Story Entertainment.
