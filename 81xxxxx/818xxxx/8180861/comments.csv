,binderguy1,2013-02-23T14:43Z,"Thanks for the ul, jackfrost8787!
It's the most impressive compilation.

I'm just surprised that Neil Gaiman's BOOKS of MAGIC # 1-4 wasn't included as well as it did have John Constantine and the first appearance of the Trenchcoat Brigade in it.

Otherwise, this torrent has everything else.  ;-)"
,tedsclai,2013-02-23T15:14Z,Constantine made his first appearance in The Saga of Swamp Thing #25 page 21 panel 2. Just showed he was getting intel on Abby and Swampy before he set his plan into motion. Thats my geek moment for the day. Peace.

,Sliddy,2013-04-28T08:01Z,"Do i have to read specials before some of the regular issues to get a better understanding of the story? Or specials are just more like parallel stuff that doesn't actually has much to do with regulars issues' plot?
Thanks, anyway. Great torrent!"
