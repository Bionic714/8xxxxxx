I do not know, probably the number uploaded torrent (s), how you write comments, and how long you stayed on the TPB and how much you share, gigabytes..
I do not know, it all comes down to how much.
Yes, it has and you get the compliments from others in the form of pink skulls.

It's a torrent when they gave me a pink skull, I think the moderator and his comment.
Bye and Cheer !!!
