Can you upload the BLADE TRILOGY on HD BD5  size?? The new releases USA (The remastered editions)"

Sorry, no more vamps & zombs for me.
I hoped ""Cockneys vs Zombies"" would be a nice horror-comedy but I deleted it after watching the half. Huge disappointment, many B-movies rated below 5* are a lot more fun.
I'll upload instead the Transformers trilogy with T2 IMAX."

Lots and lots of movie cliches.  The only thing missing was the Queen Mum and the Tardis."
