,Demon_Gate,2013-03-05T02:21Z,"this mod is in vgunetwork (.) com

Make sure you put the right info down instead of your own crappy website."

Stop trolling. If you Google ""Skyrim monster mod"" you will find the mod site I listed at the top of the list. True, it is also available at the website you mentioned, but you have to jump through a million hoops to get it there. It's so bad that my torrent listing here outranks the listing there in Google search!"
,Demon_Gate,2013-03-06T23:49Z,Don't call me a fucking troll you dumb fuck. Put it on  your description then. why the fuck do you need to get credit for something that's free and wasn't made by you? Dickhead.

Load order really shouldn't matter on this mod."
