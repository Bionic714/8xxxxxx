The Short-Circuit-Analytic (SCA) software performs available fault currents calculations in three-phase electric power systems you are working with. The program takes into consideration electrical parameters of the power supply as well as the power distribution system including utility, cables, bus ducts, transformers, generators, motors etc. SCA automatically converts the entire system into a unique impedance unit from which the short circuit current at each and every point is calculated. The process is simple, efficient and will save you both money and time.
