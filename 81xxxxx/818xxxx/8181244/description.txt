Per is a harsh and bitter caretaker with a lowlife son who just got out of prison and two pathetic friends he bosses around. One day he discovers a young beautiful woman lying naked in an empty apartment, wrapped in a curtain. Apparently she's up for grabs. The girl is happy and willing - almost like a gift from above. Per brings her home to his own apartment and her innocence awakens something new in him and his friends - love perhaps?

Keep in mind I can not give full speed to all, so if you're one of the lucky ones, help seed.
