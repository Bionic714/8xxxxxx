RELEASE INFO

Kentucky Route Zero is a magical realist adventure
game about a secret highway in the caves beneath
Kentucky, and the mysterious folks who travel it.
Developed by Cardboard Computer (Jake Elliot and
Tamas Kemenczy), the game features an original
score by Ben Babbitt, along with a suite of old
hymns and bluegrass standards recorded by The
Bedquilt Ramblers.
The game is split into five acts, of which the first
is available now. Taken as a whole, the Kentucky
Route Zero is roughly the length of a summer night.
Act I is available now. Act II will be released
around April 2013, and the remaining three acts
over the rest of the year.
