,TheFatBeast,2013-04-14T12:31Z,"Can I just congratulate you on performing about the worst filming job possible. I made the mistake of not checking the description first, but are you fucking serious. Upright filming, about phone quality from a wing seat inside a cinema, no substitles and there are 8 part-files in flv format.... are you fucking serious there is a special place in hell for you - how did you even manage to make it that bad. Atleast sit in the middle of the cinemas for starter, hold your shitty phone horizontal so it actually looks alright and try and make a regular fucking file format like mp4, avi or mkv, with a single file, and maybe make the torrent from an actual directory, rather than just a compressed file, so we can have a sample in there somewhere. FFS, such a bullshit waste of about 2 minutes download"
