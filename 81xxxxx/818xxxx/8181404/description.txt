DISCUSSIONS WITH RICHARD DAWKINS, EPISODE 1: THE FOUR HORSEMEN (2008)

On the 30th of September 2007, Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett, Sam Harris and Christopher Hitchens sat down for a first-of-its-kind, unmoderated 2-hour discussion, convened by RDFRS and filmed by Josh Timonen.

All four authors have recently received a large amount of media attention for their writings against religion - some positive, and some negative. 
In this conversation the group trades stories of the public's reaction to their recent books, their unexpected successes, criticisms and common misrepresentations. 
They discuss the tough questions about religion that face the world today, and propose new strategies for going forward.
