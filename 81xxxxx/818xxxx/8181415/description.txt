Political activity heats up in the coastal city of Goa, India, when it gets near election time. Two candidates, one, MLA Kalekar, representing the majority of the local-speaking population, and the other, Dennis Pereira, for the local minority-speaking population, are out to prove under who the city will be best represented. And they will not leave any stone unturned to succeed. Some local college students, including Peter, who loves his class-mate Sangeeta Kalekar; their friend, Sanjeev Kamat, who secretly loves Sangeeta. Sangeeta is the daughter of local MLA Kalekar. Sanjeev comes to know that Kalekar is behind local killings, rioting, and drug supplies, and threatens to expose him, but he must himself clear himself for the murder of Peter, the man his sweetheart intends to marry.
