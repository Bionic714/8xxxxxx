,njbexile,2013-04-30T09:19Z,"Could you show us a screenshot of the default size/res/quality of the video please? I'm fine with it not being hd but I just want it to be okay, before I go downloading 16.2gb as I have a 100gb data cap here. (In NZ...)"

,Shoobox,2013-05-21T06:05Z,"mkv files,
episode 1 and 2 are combined at 329mb
all other episodes are 162mb.
that size for a mkv file,
 I garante you they sacrificed either audio or video
probably poor audio with pixald video."
,ShadowWolf87,2013-05-21T23:37Z,"For those wondering, quality's gonna look like this: http://i.imgur.com/2e9KfpQ.png

Resolution's about 640 x 360, Audio's at 240 Kbps.

It's not gonna look STUNNING, but it'll do if you want it to watch without having to split it apart."
,Shoobox,2013-05-22T03:03Z,"First thanks for the upload,
second follow up,
 Sound is actually loader than normal, but video did take the sacrifice.
 I'm watching them on a 42"" but barely blocky into major battle scenes,

All in all decent for the size. if you have low bandwidth i would suggest this version of the series to download."
