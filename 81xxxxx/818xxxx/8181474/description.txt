Plot: In the autobiographical I AM NANCY, the focus is
squarely on Heather Langenkamp and her unique
experience playing Wes Craven's legendary teen
heroine Nancy Thompson. With tongue planted firmly
in cheek, Heather asks the burning question:
"Why Freddymania, and not Nancymania?" After
personally experiencing the Freddy Krueger marketing
craze, the rise of horror convention fandom and the
phenomenon of eight Nightmare On Elm Street films
Heather reflects on the relevance of heroes in this
modern age of monster lovers. Prepare to put yourself
in Nancy's shoes and think about Elm Street in a whole
new way
