,syabilng,2013-02-23T16:33Z,Working. Thanks so much. ^^
,texic,2013-02-23T16:47Z,Why is there no ammo in the bolt sniper? without that you can't proceed after knocking out the tower. is this drm or am I missing something?
,texic,2013-02-23T16:48Z,"that would be "" welcome to the jungle"". i can find no work around for this. bolt sniper has no ammo."
,texic,2013-02-23T16:55Z,"on level 2 welcome to the jungle, there is no ammo in the bolt sniper. without ammo you cannot proceed. Did I miss something or is this a drm issue?"
,dubai1991,2013-02-23T16:56Z,FINALLY WORKING
,Piratechnix,2013-02-23T18:08Z,yes some kind of issue with the sniper rifle ammo .... EA trolling us or what? lOl
,egclocknload,2013-02-23T18:30Z,"No issues with bolt sniper here.
"
,salmanbari86,2013-02-23T18:58Z,Most of the ppl here don't realize that Crysis 3 is a DX11 game!!! Your DX9 and DX10 card won't run this game until Crytek brings a new exe file that supports DX10 Graphic cards...We are screwed until than...
,remotehugger2,2013-02-23T19:02Z,i cannot find/or dont have the rldea.dll in my bin32 directory ? Is that only there if you have installed an older crack ?
,deriant,2013-02-23T19:32Z,"FINAL BOSS IS BUGGED

CAUTION

FINAL BOSS IS BUGGED"
,Malynde,2013-02-23T19:32Z,"If you dont have ammo in alien sniper rifle then select Replay Mission and start the mission over,and the ammo will be there."
,pbay1120,2013-02-23T19:48Z,To fix ammo issue with rifle make sure you deleted the rldea.dll file and restart the mission.
,hitlerdidnothingwrong,2013-02-23T19:56Z,"Whatabout using the console to get more ammo/bolts?
@texic
@Piratechnix"
,georgep001,2013-02-23T22:25Z,Last boss is bugged cant be killed or hurt.
,tommick,2013-02-23T22:53Z,"FINALLY WORKS!!!

Thnx"
,adun0,2013-02-24T00:37Z,"ya crashed few times , just run again , resume game and it was fine,
 until last boss which is bugged and cannot be killed..."
,Machine4578,2013-02-24T00:39Z,"@sataners 
read the nfo!!!""
Savegames from our previous crack might be affected, in case of issues 
restart level""
everything will work fine if you restart the level..
select campaign at main menu, click replay mission, choose mission 2, you will now have ammo when you get the gun!!"
,tuurdsfuh,2013-02-24T00:53Z,So far I've had no bugs with this. Everything works. I'll just have to wait and see for the final boss thing.
,DanMozzy,2013-02-24T01:39Z,Thank you very much
,stunner92,2013-02-24T01:44Z,"@Malynde,@pbay1120
Thanx a lot. fixed that ammo issue.!"
,9sr4f5g0j7,2013-02-24T04:30Z,"can confirm that the (maybe) final boss can't be killed
enemies besides alpha ceph just don't spawn"
,pbay1120,2013-02-24T05:38Z,last boss cannot be killed. another fix needed 
,pbay1120,2013-02-24T05:42Z,"@9sr4f5g0j7
you are correct "
,emisansev,2013-02-24T09:14Z,"Woot !! finally, it works"
,agentblack97,2013-02-24T10:25Z,"Thanks a lot. For those whose game crashed after the splash screen (the image that pops ups before the game starts), this fixed it. THANKS A LOT scene4all !!"
,bonethugnharmony,2013-02-24T11:05Z,BULLSHIT
,IzayaOrihara,2013-02-24T13:04Z,"Can confirm that the final boss does not take damage, and therefore can't be killed. 

Not a coincidence since many others have been reporting it. We need another-nother fix."
,IzayaOrihara,2013-02-24T13:07Z,"To the people STILL getting black screens on opening the game, or nothing happening at all, I believe it's because you do not have a DX 11 Capable video card. You NEED one, or else the game will not work."
,ermrgrd,2013-02-24T15:44Z,"I have GTX 570 and I'm getting the crash after splash,so no it's not because I don't have the proper card.I even fucking bought the game and all I get is ""Crysis 3 has stopped working""  I tried only putting the cracked exe in my Origin folder and I got past the first movie,then crash right before first chapter."
,bonethugnharmony,2013-02-24T16:14Z,"FORGET CRACK AND BULLSHIT PEOPLE....GET THE 

nosTEAM COPY. IT INSTALLS AND IS BROKEN DOWN INTO OPEN ONLY PART ONE AND PART 2,3,&4 INSTALL AUTOMATICALLY. INSTALL AND PLAY. NO CRACK NO BULLSHIT.  FIND IT HERE ON THE PIRATE BAY,

,ermrgrd,2013-02-24T16:50Z,"Bonethug, let me repeat myself. I paid for the fucking game, and it's not working. It's not, not working,because I stole the game from here, it's just not working."
,Fuoyall,2013-02-24T17:54Z,"Crackfix Internal-reloaded with Deluxe digital full unlocked cant be completed - final boss immortal, cant kill it"
,MLO89,2013-02-24T23:53Z,"@Bonehug, apparently you haven't got to the end of the game yet or you would have seen all cracks including Nosteam's version has the end boss invincibility bug making completing the game impossible."
,ermrgrd,2013-02-25T00:58Z,"MLO, as I've said in other torrents, the legitimate copy of Crysis 3 is having the same boss problem (Go to mycrysis forums and you will see), so it's not a bug in the release teams crack, it's a bug in the game itself."
