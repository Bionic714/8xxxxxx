,texic,2013-02-23T16:50Z,why is there no ammo in the bolt sniper in the welcome to the jungle level. Is that a drm issue? Has anyone else had this problem? am I missing something or do we need a new crack?
,paxju,2013-02-23T17:10Z,go to mision selection and start mision 2 from start
[T],Knaster,2013-02-23T17:29Z,Same problem as texic
,salmanbari86,2013-02-23T19:00Z,Most of the ppl here don't realize that Crysis 3 is a DX11 game!!! Your DX9 and DX10 card won't run this game until Crytek brings a new exe file that supports DX10 Graphic cards...We are screwed until than...
,GObonzo,2013-02-23T20:42Z,or update to modern standards since you game on your system and you're not screwed
,Machine4578,2013-02-23T22:33Z,"@texic and Knaster

read the nfo!!

""Savegames from our previous crack might be affected, in case of issues restart level""

select campaign, choose replay mission, select the second mission and play!!"
,plagasx,2013-02-24T02:10Z,"Game is still crashing for me on the ""Welcome to the Jungle"" mission...

I am using this with the Reloaded version.."
,0omaple123,2013-02-24T13:41Z,"Thanks it works.

You are screwed with you antiquated equipment,,,,,
Me!,,,,I gots dx11,,,,,Pffffftt!"
,pennknig,2013-02-25T23:44Z,"Ummmmm,,,,,the ""rldea.dll"" from the game Bin32 directory wasn't there?!
I didn't have to delete anything.
Just installed and over wrote the .dll and the .exe,,,,,,
Works fine, I'm into the 2nd level."
,MrSchwiets,2013-02-27T02:02Z,"I might just be naive but after replacing old crack with new crack (restarting and making a new prof) the game seems to be running very slowely.

Currently re-installing and removing old crack contents after re making the images for 1 and 2.

Curious if anyone has run into this issue: example the intro video is extremely choppy all the way through when the english dude releases you.

Thanks guys"
,MrSchwiets,2013-02-27T02:03Z,"also assure the .dll file that was blacklisted has been deleted

:]"
