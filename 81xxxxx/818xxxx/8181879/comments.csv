this update should be nuked... not only is the .exe not properly cracked, and even if it was, the game wouldn't start due to the missing update files.. as this update should contain more than just an .exe... COGENT failed big on this one!!! so dont waste your time downloading this and wait for a proper update!!"

,dragonsouce,2013-03-06T23:55Z,"Machine4578 right i tested it.

why are people STILL uploading this? Cogent screwed up this dose not work. besides it's only the exe. Install it to a temp and see. Could not work as you need about 3 more files. Cogent must of been stoned out of his f@#$ing loving mind!"
,dragonsouce,2013-03-06T23:57Z,tested FAKE!!
,john6425,2013-03-10T05:59Z,"*** DO NOT** I REPEAT DO NOT download the update v1.5.5427.124

Do not download the update as other here have stated, it will ruin your game and cause you trouble like it did for me for the last 2hrs! 

If you played the last Leviathan DLC then just add this DLC as per the instructions and PLAY, DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT download the update untill your game doesn't work without it

The v1.5 update is garbage and should be nuked immediately form all torrent sites, in fact I would just avoid downloading anything by that release team that goes by COGENT. 

If you were stupid enough to install it like I did you will be missing some .dll files like Binkw32.dll 

you will screw everything up, I was mins away from redownloading the entire game plus all DLC's (prob 20GB worth of stuff) instead I read a comment on TPB about v1.5 by someone and he was right, it needs to be nuked right away, it's garbage and will screw up your life for 2hrs. "
