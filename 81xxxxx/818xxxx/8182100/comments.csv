,shinoda5213,2013-02-24T16:35Z,"Hi nosTEAM, I have two questions:

I am still downloading your version and I believe it would be good as always, but does your version have the final boss glitch like the other scene? Which you can not kill it so can;t finish the game. Second, I've tried other versions(they have more seeders so it finished first sorry not I don't like your version) and it only opens a splash screen then nothing happens, I have to change my computer name to get the game started which is weird, does your version require that kind of work around? Any response would be appreciated, Thanks."

,MLO89,2013-02-25T00:19Z,Apparently not one person has finished the Nosteam version because not one single person has said he didn't encounter the end boss invincibility bug making completing the game impossible.

,Machine4578,2013-02-25T04:31Z,"@plagasx 

who cares what version, repack, copy, rip, name, you put on this game... NO ONE can beat the final boss until there is a new crack... because EVERYONE is using the same crack with EVERY release out there!!!!! PERIOD!!"

The non pirated copies are having the same boss problem. "
,ermrgrd,2013-02-25T09:20Z,"Nvidia users, the feb update and the beta drivers are bunk and will cause you to have a ""crysis 3 exe has stopped working"" after the splash.

To remedy this delete drivers, install nvidia drivers from december.

Make sure you delete this nvwgf2umx.dll file from c:/windows/system32 This showed up in event log as cause of crash. After I reinstalled old drivers I no longer crash."

i have a nvidia geforce gtx 660m with the latest 314.07 driver.. and the game has started without any problems... there was no need for me to delete any file or revert back to an old driver to play the game"

Thanks man, it work's like a charm, far better than other uploads. You're like a fuckin' angel!

They upload shitwares and try to fix them with updates and crack fixes. The thing which amazes me is almost all the time when you release a game, there is hardly any problem in installation or play. Except l4d2, I have not applied a single update fix to nosTEAM's games.
