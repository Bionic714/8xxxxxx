Tamer Abu Ghazaleh - 2008 - Mir'ah

When light rays are made up of paradox and reflected light rays are made up of missiles, Mir'ah is the mirror.

This 2008 release contains 7 songs that were composed in Palestine during the period in which demonstrations erupted, during the invasion and bombardment of Palestinian cities, during curfews, and during the construction of the apartheid wall. Love, hate, comfort, boredom, excitement; the album expresses every-day human emotions blended with the unusual experience of living in Palestine during that period of time.

Mir'ah is composed and performed by Tamer Abu Ghazaleh in cooperation with a number of Palestinian and Egyptian performers. Artistic production by Al-Urmawi Center for Mashreq Music.
