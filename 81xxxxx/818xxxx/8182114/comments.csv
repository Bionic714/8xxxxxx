The Boston Celtics, their season taking a surprising turn after the season-ending injury to Rajon Rondo, are bearing down on a playoff spot.

So maybe Friday night's visit by the Celtics (29-26) to Arizona was predictable. They played with purpose in rolling to an easy 113-88 win over the disjointed Suns. The Celtics, 9-3 since the Rondo injury, burst out of the gate with a 16-3 lead and really never were challenged in the wire-to-wire win. The Suns got only as close as 53-48 early in the third quarter. The Celtics are two games ahead of the Milwaukee Bucks for the No. 8 and final playoff spot"
