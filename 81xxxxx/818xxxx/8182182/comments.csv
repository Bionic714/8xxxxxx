Anne Perry is getting consideration as well. It's just the sheer volume of books she's had published that's causing problems haha. As with Agatha Christie but I have gotten to about half of her books."
,a5h15hn3g1,2013-02-26T20:16Z,"I have anne perry Most of the books (think many of the are retail) excpet the Midnight at Marble Arch.
And For Agatha Christie very few books but not any retail books."
[T],TxJag,2013-02-26T20:31Z,"I have ALL their books. Some are retail, some are decent OCR. I will work on those myself. Shouldn't take me but a few weeks."
