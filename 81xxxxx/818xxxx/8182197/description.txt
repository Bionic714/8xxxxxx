Passarim album by Antonio Carlos Jobim was released Jan 01, 1987 on the Verve label. Passarim is Jobim's major statement of the '80s, emerging during a time when his concerns were turning increasingly toward the Planet Earth. Passarim music CDs The title song is one of Jobim's most haunting creations, a cry of pain about the the destruction of the Brazilian rain forest that resonates in the memory for hours. Also, by this time, Jobim had resumed touring with a large group containing friends and family, and they carry a great deal of the load here, with lots of airy female backup vocals, two worthy songs by Jobim's multi-talented son Paulo, and another by flutist/singer Danilo Caymmi. Recorded entirely in Rio, the record's overall sound is very different from Jobim's '60s and '70s work: denser, hazier, still grounded in the samba yet rougher in texture (as is Jobim's voice). Though not as immediately winning as the Creed Taylor-produced albums, this music repays repeated listening -- particularly the extended suite from Jobim's score for the film Gabriela -- and there are samples of his wry humor in "Chansong" and the bossa nova reworking of "Fascinatin' Rhythm"
