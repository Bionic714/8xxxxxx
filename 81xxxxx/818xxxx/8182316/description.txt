A no-cd crack for Oblivion. Supports Shivering Isles expansion and most (if not all) DLC's.


Simply copy the oblivion.exe to your Oblivion/ folder (NOT Oblivion/Data/ ) and when asked to overwrite, click yes. If you aren't sure if this will work, copy your Oblivion.exe (NOT Oblivion_Launcher.exe) to your desktop, or some other location BEFORE replacing it with the crack provided.


This simple Crack deletes a registry line that checks to see if the CD is in the drive, and allows you to play the game without the CD.


As far as I know, this will work with any and all version of Oblivion, although it wouldn't hurt to download and install the Unofficial Oblivion Patch, or if you have Shivering Isles, the Unofficial Shivering Isles Patch.
The Patches can be obtained through here for free, with no ads or requirements:     http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Tes4Mod:Unofficial_Oblivion_Patch
