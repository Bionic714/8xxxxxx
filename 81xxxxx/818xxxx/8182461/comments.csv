I don't understand just cause you got a new computer why the file isn't still on the HD for episode 5. Find the file again plz."
,sup1990,2013-02-25T18:11Z,"i don't have the file on my HD anymore, i switched drives and reformatted it and lost all my torrent files.
but i promise i will have every episode from now on. "
,sup1990,2013-02-25T18:17Z,"give me a couple hours, i will redownload the file and seed. sorry again. if i had the file i would have been seeding sooner."
,sup1990,2013-02-25T19:05Z,@Bean-Bandit I have the file now and i'm seeding at the highest rate i can! :)

Thanks. I just started that file back up again and it's started downloading where I left off. Good Job. :)"

One last thing. Your S03E04 actual file is wrong. The file shows I think S02. Please check it out."
,sup1990,2013-02-27T18:35Z,"@Bean-Bandit, yea that is the right file though, i double checked it. the person who originally created the file named it wrong :)"
,jchen9999,2013-03-01T11:45Z,please upload episode 7
,sup1990,2013-03-04T03:35Z,"i'll have episode 7 up tomorrow, sorry for the delay :)"
