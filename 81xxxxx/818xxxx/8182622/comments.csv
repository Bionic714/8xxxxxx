The trouble is, the isp company get lots of pressure to throttle upload speeds, to discourage torrent and P2P stuff going onto sites like this. Once it's been fully downloaded once, then the amount of seeds goes up quickly, making it a lot faster to download.

Thanks to all the seeders. It makes it more fun for all of us. x x x "
