,at7000,2013-03-28T19:01Z,"  Be patient and wait for the DVD or Bluray to be released.  The whole point of watching these films are they are shot in very hi-def. And no, burning a crap cam capture to a DVD format, does not improve the quality. It bloats the hell out of the file size, and you are still left with an unwatchable crap copy.  Screw this cam BS. I wish someone would ban it. "
