After all the shenanigans that happened at last year’s BRIT awards, the nation waited with bated breath as the opening credits rolled for the BRIT awards 2013. The organisers of this prestigious event pulled out all the stops this year with incredible performances, the charming James Corden presenting, and the gong being designed by British designer Damien Hirst.
 
The night kicked off with Muse delivering a phenomenal performance of their hit song “Supremacy.” Next the award for Best British Group, which went to Mumford & Sons, perhaps no surprise after their second album Babel, became the fastest ever selling album in the UK! The folk band also did, in my opinion, the greatest live act of the evening with an outstanding performance of “I Will Wait.”
