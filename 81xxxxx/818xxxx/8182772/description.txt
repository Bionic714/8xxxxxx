Big thanks to all of you

NOTES:
The source is x264 and having 23,976fps.
To create a DVD of films with 23,976 or 24fps
must always change the FPS.

For NTSC makes use of Pulldown to 29.76 fps.
For PAL makes use of AssumeFPS to 25fps, the proper way to do it.

We in Scandinavia has PAL TV-system, hence the choice is simple
to encode the movie to PAL with the best tools, CCE, AssumeFPS,
Lanczos4Resize, eac3to and DVD-Lab.
