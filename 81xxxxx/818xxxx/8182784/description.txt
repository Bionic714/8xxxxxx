The Concorde for MSFS 2004 & FSX.

The sound.cfg file is set to use the default soundpack for the B734 in FS9, but in FSX will default to the "stock" propeller sound in FSX, so you should add a soundpack. The are many good sources for the soundpack. Simply do a Google search, and you should be able to find it.
