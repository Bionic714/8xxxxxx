,ectoendomezo,2013-02-26T18:05Z,"Thanks Folks..

Greatly Appreciated..

imho This is the best of the recent slate of ""Hitchcock"" bio pieces..

'The Girl' was...interesting..made me immediately re-watch 'marnie' and 'the birds' and 'marnie' is again...imho..for who am I but a lowly non-famous citizen...but 'Marnie' was frankly embarrassing to watch..the horse riding scene in particular was....almost bizarre...like Alfred H. was trying to ruin tippy's career..but also..Anthony Hopkins is SO good as Hitchcock that its really enjoyable.

So Thanks Again..truly."
