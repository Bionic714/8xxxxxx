El Matador. Spanish for The Killer. The killer of the beast. The killer of the hearts and minds of men who admire bravery in itΓÇÖs raw form. One man stands alone against the angry rage of the mature, 3000 pound bull. Its horns like sharpened metal spears, its breath like molten lava, its eyes transfixed on The Killer, El Matador. With force of a speeding truck, the raging beast throws its spears with the full weight of its enormous bodyΓÇª Yet the killer, El Matador, stands unafraid, unmoving. With no protection, nothing to safeguard his body, he stands against the raging beast with no more than a red cloth to inflame the beastΓÇÖs anger, and pure human courage.
