,loveaudit,2013-02-27T17:32Z,"Thanks Ipmark!  I'm glad my 755T is still well supported and going strong, except for the battery life. LOL."
,robert342,2013-02-27T19:06Z,"Thank you for uploading all the files, not just the Navigator. Hopefully, someone else will do the same for Europe. Though, I don't know if they support the 755 in the latest version."

Question: I'm using the D06009A.JCV file on my Gamin 1490T, it seems to work fine, however when it first opens for a junction view it splits, then goes full screen.  I notice there are three parts to this file. Im using pt. 1.  Am I supposed to try all three separately to see which works better? Or all three at once?  I've loaded the new map and JCV on the SD card 'cuz they wont fit on internal memory."
,cazam,2013-03-05T17:46Z,"Sorry, meant to say I'm using D3060090A.JCV file."
,Ipmark,2013-03-05T18:40Z,"Unrar the part #1 ONLY.
Winrar will join togheter the other parts during decompression."
,cazam,2013-03-07T02:30Z,"OK, THANKS !!!"
