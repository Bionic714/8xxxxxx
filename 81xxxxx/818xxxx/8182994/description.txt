DEBUGER 20 is out! Stanny Abram brings two tech house tracks, with a 
retro funk taste. Rollercoaster Boogie is a funky blaster, with strong 
bassline, great percs and funky vocals, the brake will blow you away! 
Return Of The Hustler is much lighter tracks, with some soul guitar 
parts. Libetry Klaud provided the deep funk remixes for both tracks, 
with the 80's moments highlighted. DJ GrujA is more turned to driving 
action as usual with his remix of Rollercoaster Boogie.
