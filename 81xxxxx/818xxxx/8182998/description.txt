Notes:

Fantastic movie with an all-star cast. This movie, for some reason, surprisingly has not yet been released on blu-ray, but the source is HD so this IS a 720p encode.

Please keep in mind that my bitrates and file sizes are optimized for those who store and watch movies on their computers. The bitrates are high enough to look perfect on "normal" sized monitors and low enough to keep download times short and the file size small enough for those who keep large collections of movies on their hard drives. If you plan on watching something on a large HD screen, you're going to need one of the larger, higher bitrate torrents. For large screen TVs, I recommend bitrates of at least 2500 for 720p's and 5000 for 1080p's or higher, depending on the size of your screen.

Please seed for as long as possible, preferably until reaching a share ratio of at least 3:1.
