2)  Episode Two: 
In this episode Sir Trevor visits three countries where the landscape has determined how people live there, whether it is living by an ancient lagoon, being a cowboy in southern France or turning a barren Tunisian landscape into a multi-million pound Hollywood film set. Sir Trevor heads to the beautiful Greek island of Santorini, where he visits the caves that the island's earliest dwellers dug into the side of the volcanic rock. Here he meets Kostis Psychas who turned these caves into an unusual modern hotel in the mid 1980s. Although the hotel is now some of the most expensive real estate in Greece, Kostis explains how the caves were originally very humble dwellings: "The people here didn't have the possibility to build a proper house. They didn't have materials, they didn't have wood, so the easy way to create a house was just to dig a cave."
