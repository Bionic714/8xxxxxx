,illjones,2013-03-02T03:43Z,"@jakenator

what an ignorant comment. There's a reason the 'real scene' releases are safer and always quality. They uphold standards in the scene, so in the end we don't get burnt. 'P2P', however, does not adhere to these standards. thenoobish is a 'VIP' so it's a trusted source. Many 'P2P' releases have been nuked in the past so think before you speak next time.   "

,quinnarty,2013-03-07T02:47Z,"Using ImgBurn to create backups of games you already own:
Dual Layer DVD ( Verbatim Brand )

For those of you creating backup games,
XGD2 Games LayerBreak = 1913760
XGD3 Games LayerBreak = 2133520
Open your .dvd file in notepad and make sure that the layer break is set for either 1913760 or 2133520 depending on if the game is XGD2 or XGD3. 
To check to see which your game is, visit the XDG3 Website and search your game. 
If it has a Wave Number next to it, burn with XGD2 Layerbreak. 
If it says XGD3 next to it, burn with XGD3 Layer Break. 
I'm sure most of you already know to burn at 2.4x. 

This game is XGD2, and you will need to use the layerbreak 1913760
