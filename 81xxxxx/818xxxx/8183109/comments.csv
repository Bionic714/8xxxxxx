One of my friends always says that he, too, often have tshirts with Rush and the mark on his motorcycle, I often tell him you're crazy 50 years and so childish haha.

Should we fill up with additional songs ""Part Two"", you write a list here. Yes even you guys can fill in.

Enjoy all ;)"
,canadianice,2013-02-24T02:57Z,"Part 2---yes.  Songs from Vapour trails and the new Clockwork Angels, which is a true MASTERPIECE.Also Grace under pressure---thanks man"
,canadianice,2013-02-24T02:58Z,are tracks 14 and 15 repeated?

14 & 15 I think not. I need advice and help with the 25 to me to have the Clockwork Angels which is good where do you think? Would be great if you are with and chooses more detail. And while the rest of you who want to choose you write here, too."
