This second of three Sliders-12 workshops heralded the beginning of NET EarthΓÇÖs Team KrystosΓÇÖ Al-Hum-Bhra Host Mission. This new upgrade in the Kristos Mission commenced with opening of something called the Miotic Planes and the Councils of 48, a huge collective of Krystic CosMAyah Beings also referred to as the ΓÇ£Krystal PeopleΓÇ¥. The Krystal People represent the RhAya-Phim Races who manifest as Krystal RhAy Ships, and who are coming together in an extraordinary way in our EarthΓÇÖs atmosphere to form the massive Mirror in the Sky that will be reflecting back a large portion of the reversed frequencies (including the powerful reversed Violet Plasma Ray of Consumption) during the up-and-coming months. As part of this most recent Mission upgrade, the hosting parts of our Metagalaxy (MG) will be drawn through into the ΓÇÿadjugate alignmentΓÇÖ from MG-6; GL-3; SS-3 into MG-12; GL-12; Sol-5; Stella-3. This new 12:12:5:3 alignment will open the Eye of Aquari starting NOW and will complete by May 27th. UrthaΓÇÖs staff in M-31 in MG12; GAL3; Sol3; Stell3 will hold EarthΓÇÖs Rod chambers stable until the end of the load-out in 2047.
