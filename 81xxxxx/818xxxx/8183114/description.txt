SPORT: Six Nations Rugby Union - England v France
On: BBC 1 HD 
Date: Saturday 23rd February 2013 
KO Time: 17:00

Live coverage from Twickenham as England renew their cross-Channel rivalry with France. England hosts have won five of their last six encounters against the French in the Six Nations, including a 24-22 victory in Paris last year which helped ensure Stuart Lancaster was given the head coach role on a permanent basis. Lancaster's young side have since impressed and frustrated in equal measure, but they began this tournament as joint favourites with France. The visitors bounced back from a poor Six Nations campaign last year to win their three autumn internationals, beating Australia when marshalled by Frederic Michalak. France's prodigal son is likely to need to be at his best again if his side are to earn only their second Six Nations win at Twickenham since 1997. Commentary by Eddie Butler and Brian Moore.
