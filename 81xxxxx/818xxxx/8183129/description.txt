SPORT: Six Nations Rugby Union - Italy v Wales.
On: BBC 1 HD
Date: Saturday 23rd February 2013 
KO Time: 14:30

Live coverage from Rome of the opening Six Nations fixture of the weekend, as Wales continue their defence of the title against Italy. Wales have endured a chastening run of results since winning the Grand Slam last spring, and Italy will feel they have a golden opportunity to create an upset. They have done it twice before in this fixture, latterly in 2007 when Mauro Bergamasco's late try earned a 23-20 victory. Nonetheless, Wales have reeled off five straight victories against Italy since that game and will start as favourites. Commentary by Andrew Cotter and Jonathan Davies.
