Office 2007 Enterprise Blue Edition w SP3.

This is the full activated Blue Edition of Office 2007 but has been configured to give you the options to install what items you would like.  Most Enterprise Editions only allow a full unattended install of all components.  This download has been configured to give you the splash screen to choose which components are to be installed as well as the ability to add your registration name and organization (does not effect functionality).  By default this will install only Word, Exel, and Powerpoint.  Outlook files are included but will only install on first use.  If you require more items such as Groove, InfoPath etc. you can also install those by checking the corresponding box(es).

Service Pack 3 is also slipstreamed in so no updates will be required as of Feb 20, 2013. All updates will install with the program.

Read the "READ ME" in the main folder.

Enjoy...
