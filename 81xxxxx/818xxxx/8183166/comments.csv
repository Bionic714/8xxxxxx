Thanks!"
[V],TheExecutive,2013-02-24T05:02Z,"Unfortunately I only have one more, Cozy.

That's 4 out of 24 episodes!"
,cozy8,2013-02-24T05:24Z,"I like quality and your uploads are always that. The old stuff is so much better than a lot of the new. I'm grateful!
thanks,

Looking to get seeds for Silent Flute/Circle of Iron w/ Bruce Lee. Do you know anyone who can seed that one for me. Heard about through Longstreet.
thx."
[V],TheExecutive,2013-02-26T03:07Z,"Silent Flute/Circle of Iron must be two of Bruce Lee movies, Cozy.   I don't collect his stuff not being a fan of his, so no way I could seed those."
,cozy8,2013-02-26T05:13Z,Ok. Thx for responding Exec.
