Until recently I've had to endure listening to this awesome LP in Lossy.

Now I know how crummy it sounded.


Last week I learned of the 2006 remaster and immediately bought it.



2 musicians multitracked this great music in 1974





JAN HAMMER plays DRUMS, MOOG BASS, MOOG LEADS, OBERHEIM SEQUENCED SYNTH, 

                 ELECTRIC PIANO




JERRY GOODMAN plays GUITAR, All manner of ELECTRIC VIOLINS, ELECTRIC MANDOLIN





Compare the first track: COUNTRY AND EASTERN MUSIC with the Lossy rip

in my 29-JAN-013 Jan Hammer/Jerry Goodman vinyl rips upload to hear the

difference Lossless compression makes.  Copy and Paste this one 





A TRULY GREAT ALBUM GIVEN THE TREATMENT IT DESERVES  (top 10 album all genres IMO)
