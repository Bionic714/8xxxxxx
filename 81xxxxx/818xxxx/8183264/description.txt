Arc-Flash-Analytic v 5.0 software tool has been developed based on IEEE 1584 Guide for Performing Arc-Flash Hazard Calculations as an easy to use and comprehensive instrument for calculating arc incident energy and arc flash boundary, for determining limited, restricted, prohibited approach boundaries and hazard risk category required by NEC / CEC and OSHA when work is to be performed on or near the energized equipment. Also, the program allows one to calculate initial pressure generated by arc blast and arc flash TNT (TriNitroToluen) equivalent.
