 I thought it was﻿ legal to walk/ride naked in Portland as long as you are﻿ on public property and aren't doing anything sexual but the police officers said it was illegal for him to be riding like that.
 I LOLed when I saw﻿ a Nissan Leaf electric car passed by them while the naked guy was talking about global warming. "
