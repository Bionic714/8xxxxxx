[T],MrUnpopular,2013-02-24T05:52Z,"Tell me, where do you see HDTV in the release title?

You don't."
,OkLetsTryAgain,2013-02-25T06:41Z,"The usual Unpopular release: might not be the best, but, hey, it was quick and is still the only available. Don't complain, guys, let's thanks MrUnpoplar! :)"
[T],MrUnpopular,2013-02-26T03:52Z,OOO uploads 720p versions and posts it on Tehparadox but it's a few hours wait minimum usually.
,OkLetsTryAgain,2013-02-26T11:43Z,"No worries, I like your releases! They're quick. :) If the episode is really good I might download the 720 version, but usually I just want to have a good laugh, so the quality is good enough. Thanks again, Unpopular!"
