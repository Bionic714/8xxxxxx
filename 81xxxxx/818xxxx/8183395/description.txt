So, my first release on torrent. I'll seed as much as I can for long as I can, so enjoy.

My work was based on the encodes done by the user dhjudasx (and I seriously recommend checking his releases).

Why release this one when there are others? It was available only in two levels of quality, and I found either too big and good or too small and bad files. Nothing in between... so here's something in between.

If everything worked as it should, this file should be compatible with PS3 and standalone players. I haven't tested it and I can't test it, so I hope it is compatible.

The mixing done to convert the 5.1 track to stereo is NOT good, the stereo track is there for compatibility only. When using an iOS or Android device, it should be used automatically.
If you can, use the 5.1 sound track. It'll sound better than the 2.0 in most cases.

Well, I hope you guys enjoy this movie as much as I did
