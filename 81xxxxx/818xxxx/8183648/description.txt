Transporter The Series S01E09 - City of Love (Canadian broadcast)

Frank is hired by a terrorist to deliver a dangerous package to Paris. 

This episode (as broadcast in Canada) has not been released yet by the scene as far as I know. It was aired on Feb 22, 2013 on HBO HD Canada. Like all of my releases to date, the source is an analog rip, so the quality is, at best, something like A8 V8.
