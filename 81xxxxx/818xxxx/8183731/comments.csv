It is a new torrent, I only made it last night.  It'll begin to grow once people finish their downloads, but until that happens, I'm really the only significant seeder.  Just wait a while.  Eventually, you'll be able to download.  My upload speed on my internet connection is only 300KB/s max, which I've been seeding at for the last 12 hours."
,CrimCap,2013-02-24T18:33Z,"I've currently got the number of peers on the torrent for seeding set to 100 (there are less than 100 leechers).  Is there a better way for me to seed?  Should I be seeding to one person at a time?  Or should I just continue letting Transmission choose to whom I seed, and to how many leechers at once."
,CrimCap,2013-02-25T01:35Z,"You guys also understand that seeding will increase your speed, right?  If you seed to someone who doesn't have any percentage completed, I don't have to, and I can seed to you.

The people who are stuck at 65%: if you help get everyone up to your level of completion, every single piece of data my client uploads will be new, and you'll finish your download limited only by my upload speed, not by the other peers that are using a percentage of it!

Basically: if you seed while you're downloading, you'll download faster, as you'll be maxing out other people's download speeds and forcing me to seed to you.  Simple as that."
