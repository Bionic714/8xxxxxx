All the Mario Party games packaged together nicely in one mega-download!  Every game in the epic sequence, all the way up from the original Mario Party on the N64 to Mario Party 9, released on the Wii in 2012.

N64 roms are relatively simple, and will run on most N64 emulators.  My personal favorite for PC is Project64.  For Mac, Sixtyforce.

All Gamecube and Wii roms have been play-tested on the Dolphin emulator (on both Mac and PC).  The games show no errors, but if you do find any, please report them in the comments section below.

As this torrent is so large, I encourage you to pick and choose which individual games you wish to download.  I also, of course, encourage you to seed for at least a little while after you download.  If this torrent grows in popularity, I won't be able to singlehandedly seed for it due to its size.  Your cooperation in this matter is appreciated.

Most importantly, have fun with it!
