,willowsummers,2013-02-26T10:23Z,How exactly do I transfer the game to my Xbox so it can be playable? Can anyone give a thorough explanation or at least point me to one?
,iknowafewthings,2013-03-17T04:17Z,"If you have to ask how to get this on your Xbox 360 you probably shouldn't.  You have to have a moded Xbox 360.  You either have to be running one with a jtagrgh hack and custom dashboard (can't go on Live) or a DVD drive that is flashed with LT+ or LTU (can go on live if you burn the game correctly) depending on the drive type.  There are a ton of tutorials on how to do these things, and this magical thing called Google that will let you find them."
