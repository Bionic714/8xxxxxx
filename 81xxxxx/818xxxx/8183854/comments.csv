,IKnowWhatImHereFor,2013-02-25T00:41Z,"@AArelig: Works perfectly on mine, try to remove the songs from the iPod, resync, then add the songs back to the iPod and see if that fixes the issue.

If it doesn't, I recommend removing the songs from iTunes, Sync the iPod (to remove the songs from the iPod), then re-add the songs to iTunes.

If all else fails, re-download torrent or try restoring your iPod"

My iPod has the same issue with this album BUT I downloaded it from somewhere else. Only came here to see if there was a version of the mp3's that worked =/"

,spunkdiddles,2013-03-18T09:42Z,320kbps isnt CD quality....1411kbps is CD quality not that you can really tell the difference between them when your listening.  Quality isnt the best but it works for now...they almost sound like youtube rips.  That might explain why people are having trouble playing these songs since they are fake 320kbps.
