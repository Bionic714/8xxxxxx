Plot
----
Jack Frost follows the story of Noh-A Joo, the new student at Amityville High School. Things start off rather poorly for Noh-A as she quickly comes to realize that the school is not as it appears. Caught in an interschool war between vampires, monsters, and other creatures, she must quickly learn what her new role is as the "mirror image," and how to handle the mysterious Jack Frost.

What is known about Amityville; There have been 13 wars/classes, only Jack survived the latest. There are 4 districts North, East, South, West, and north is smallest. The combine population of the 4 districts is equal to a country in the living world. Those who come there are removed from the karmic cycle of death and rebirth, thus death is truly final there with no hope of any reincarnation or afterlife.There have been multiple statements hinting that the mirror image is somehow able to change this.
