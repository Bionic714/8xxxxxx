[T],pharmakate,2013-02-24T21:17Z,@Mertonoia - So you like Merton the Mystical Christian Humanist best? Why these two books rather than New Seeds or Life & Holiness? (The latter I hope to post soon.)
,ffsinval,2013-05-17T19:21Z,"Thank you very much for all your efforts to put these works available. The works of Merton, Nouwen, Lewis among others are simply great. Thanks for all these high quality spiritual readings! God bless you. "
,Mertonoia,2013-05-28T20:58Z,"@pharmakate I missed until now your incisive and insightful question. New Seeds is wonderfully pithy and quotable, of course, but with its respect for brevity there is naturally less development of thought. Its purpose seems entirely different. I came to Life & Holiness late, after I'd already accepted a kind of theologically-founded  wordliness, perhaps largely from Tillich? You're exactly right...the ""deeper"" concerns of spiritual identity are where I've appreciated Merton most. Thanks for asking!"
