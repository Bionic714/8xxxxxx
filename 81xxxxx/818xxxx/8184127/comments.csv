,ram44,2013-02-24T11:38Z,Some initial super-seeding might help? Extremely slow start
[T],Hard2Find2,2013-02-24T11:45Z,That happens when you are the only one with the file and 270 leachers dude. Try uploading something yourself that is popular. I am running full blast as always. Fully devoted bandwith.
,ram44,2013-02-24T13:09Z,"Super-seeding sends each part of the torrent to 1 leecher only, and doesn't resend that part until that leecher has seeded to someone else. My ratio on this is climbing and i will stay on as long as needed."
