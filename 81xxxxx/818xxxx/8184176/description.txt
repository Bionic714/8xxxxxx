Description:
This is the story of how builds character, how inexperienced girl into a fearless Tomb Raider. In its arsenal - a innate instincts and desire to survive at any cost. Against it - and the brutal nature of the mysterious force. But where the other fails and dies, it proves that deserves to carry the proud name Croft. Having overcome all the trials at the limit of human capabilities, it will turn into a desperate adventurer, for whom nothing is impossible.
Legendary franchise reboots as Tomb Raider flashes back to the time before Lara Croft was a gun-wielding, butt-kicking, tomb-raiding hero. When the young researcher washes up on an uncharted island after a shipwreck, she believes she's alone - until strange noises start coming from the shadows. Travel across the open island wilderness and through the tombs underground as ruthless predators stalk your every move. Adapt to your surroundings in a gritty battle to survive using your wits, brute strength, and whatever weapons you can find. Fight unflinching melee battles as the hunted becomes the hunter in a cinematic story tailor-made for Lara Croft.
