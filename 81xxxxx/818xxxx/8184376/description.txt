In his first book for young adults, bestselling author Sherman Alexie
tells the story of Junior, a budding cartoonist growing up on the Spokane
Indian Reservation. Determined to take his future into his own hands,
Junior leaves his troubled school on the rez to attend an all-white farm
town high school where the only other Indian is the school mascot.
Heartbreaking, funny, and beautifully written, The Absolutely True Diary
of a Part-Time Indian, which is based on the author's own experiences,
coupled with poignant drawings by acclaimed artist Ellen Forney, that
reflect the character's art, chronicles the contemporary adolescence of
one Native American boy as he attempts to break away from the life he was
destined to live.
