Chu, an ugly, timid scholar, carelessly breaks the life-and-death registry stone on a monk statue. Thanking him for repairing the registry, the spirit of the statue awards Chu by turning him into a handsome man. This brings Chu wealth, power, and the most beautiful prostitutes in town as he leaves his wife behind. Unbeknownst to Chu, however, his life will soon be changed forever.
