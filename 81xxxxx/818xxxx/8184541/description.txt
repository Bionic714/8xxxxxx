A Murder of Crows
They are generally dismissed as spooky - Hitchcock used them quite successfully to frighten moviegoers, or as a general nuisance - scarecrows were after all invented to scare crows away from crops. But their image is about to take a real turn. New research has shown they are among the most intelligent animals in the world, able to use tools as only elephants and chimpanzees do, able to recognize each other's voices and 250 distinct calls. They are very social, mate for life, and raise their young for up to five years. And they are able to recognize individual humans and pick them out of a crowd up to two years later. Crow experts from around the world sing their praises, and present us with captivating new footage of crows as we have never seen them before.
