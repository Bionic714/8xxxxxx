River Monsters Series 3
Jeremy Wade, biologist and extreme angler, is back with more investigations into the murky world of fishermen s tales. Jeremy investigates tales of frighteningly large and dangerous river monsters that have attacked and even killed humans. In this season, Wade catches the most bizarre and dangerous underwater creatures to inhabit earth, including a monster responsible for devouring certain male body parts in Papua New Guinea, and packs of eels that will rip the flesh from unfortunate swimmers. Jeremy s search for the truth takes him on a dark and dangerous journey across the globe to reveal that the truth is every bit as unbelievable as the myth.
"Perhaps my favorite part about River Monsters is that the program is entirely aware of the dangers that exist outside of the water when traveling to different continents. Jeremy Wade is always very culturally aware, and often has to tread thin lines when investigating animals in extreme locations. He is always eager to seek local knowledge, respect tradition and utilize the assistance of the community. When speaking to those who have suffered loss or injury he is sympathetic, yet composed and persevering."




8)  Tribal Fishing 
Jeremy Wade attempts to survive alongside some of the world's best tribal fishermen using spears, bows and arrows, and even spiders webs to catch his prey. These master fishermen live in a tropical island paradise, where they fish and swim in some of the most shark-infested waters on the planet. As Jeremy throws himself into South Pacific tribal life, he comes closer than ever to one of the world's ultimate predator.
