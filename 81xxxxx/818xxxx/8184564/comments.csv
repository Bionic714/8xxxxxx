not so hard to set up hidden cameras all around the house and ones with IR etc even old mechanic 8mm or something that cant be detected so easily by hitech aliens :)
even a camera set up on a neighbors place looks towards yours.. or a portable camera in back of car parked outside must be some way to out smart the greenies/greyies

I think only a could have got some dna.. that dude in aussie with the blonde hair which wasnt much evidence to be beyond proof but he did pass the lie detector (e.g. see my moms talks to aliens docu)"
