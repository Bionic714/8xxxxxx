A collection of tracks Ive produced using garage band on my iPod in the last months. The genre ranges from dubstep to drum and bass to electronic to even a bit of rock. I'm still in the learning process so some tracks are better then others and of higher quality. The standout track for me is The Way It Should Be and if nothing else check that one out.
