Spiritus(2013), (Latin for ΓÇ£SpiritΓÇ¥) combines 'loops' from multiple sources to create musical magic. A 'loop' is a repetitive musical pattern which is adjusted and expanded by adding variations. 

A wide variety of instruments have been incorporated in this album. A distinct Tabla groove with a perfect blend of Sitar notes add to its beauty. The music you are about to experience has been arranged on Apple's GarageBandΓäó for iPad. 

Spiritus and other future albums are free to download and share.
