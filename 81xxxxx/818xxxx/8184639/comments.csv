,MailerDaemon0,2013-02-24T19:22Z,"It's a damn shame that this show as well as Green Lantern: The Animated Series were both canceled by Warner Brothers and Cartoon Network because of poor merchandise tie-in sales no matter they are both at the top of charts for numbers of watchers according to CN...

When the current season's ep's are done airing that's it, and that's a damn shame..

,dbranson17,2013-02-24T19:58Z,"it's run out too soon... the stories have gotten increasingly convoluted and confusing to the toy buying age group... and that is completely the failure of Warner/DC - you have to wonder how long Warner/DC will continue to fail in this way.  They should hire some former or current Pixar employees to consult on how to make interesting stories that appeal to kids.

Rule #1: you can't have contrived, unnecessarily complicated season arcs filled with more characters than one could count on fingers and toes."

There are enough kid's shows on tv, this wasn't convoluted at all! if you think so then I'm pretty sure you're just being ridiculous! are you telling me you'd rather have Teen Titans instead of this, if yes, then I find your lack of taste disturbing!"
