Version: AVG PC TuneUp

Pros

It did make the computer boot up quicker.

Cons

It is apparently overeager in what it deletes. After using the program my dvd/cd could no longer burn files to disk, and my MSWord could no longer print to my Corel PDF Fusion program. Hours later still trying to fix the problems caused by this program.

Summary

DEFINITELY A TWO THUMBS DOWN PROGRAM IF YOU WANT YOUR COMPUTER TO CONTINUE TO WORK CORRECTLY UNLESS A FASTER COMPOUTER THAT DOESN'T WORK RIGHT IS WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR!"

,Ziero_1986,2013-02-25T21:37Z,"No longer works, product code has been black listed.  Needs new crack and product code."
,Ziero_1986,2013-02-25T21:40Z,"On another note, this did work fine for about two days, and people who says this damages their PC don't know what they are doing anyway.  I never had any ""damaging"" problems, but that's because I know what things are and what operations are safe to do.  You can't just do everything all at once without first checking the settings."

,friendly_tec,2013-03-03T14:10Z,"It seems avg got wise, so this is the way I have AVG Tuneup 2013 to work perfectly  (at least for now, on 3rd March 2013) Install the program OFFLINE, as soon as it says “finished” open the crack folder and send these 4 files to c:program files/avg. Next install the following name: Senzati    Serial:Q9RAD3-WJQQNR-68NKP0-8WDK62-4MDEJV-JRVWTY Lastly open the program and un check automatic updates. You may NOW connect to the internet."
,Ziero_1986,2013-03-05T19:36Z,"Okay everyone, here's how I fixed mine after accidentally letting it check for updates:

First, I completely uninstalled AVG PC TuneUp 2013.

Second, I opened run command (WindowsKey +R), type regedit in the box.

3rd, press Ctrl+F to open the find dialog.  Make sure only the ""Keys"" and ""Match whole string only"" boxes are checked.  The type ""AWL"" (no quotes) in the 'Find What:' box. Press enter.

Regedit will now find only the registry key that match AWL.  AWL is the key for PC TuneUp.  When it finds a key (folder), press delete.  Click yes on the confirmation box.  Now press F3 to automatically find the next key.  (NOTE: Sometimes, regedit will find the AWL key (folder), and underneath it there will be an AWL2012 folder also, delete it too.)

Now, to be sure there is no trace of the program left, restart your PC.  This cleans out temp files that were stored in your RAM.

Now, turn off your internet.  This can be easily achieved by unplugging your internet cable from your modem/router.  Now, install AVG PC TuneUp 2013, and make sure the settings for automatic update are completely disabled.  Next, close AVG PC TuneUp and make sure the icon in the notification area is also closed.  Follow the crack instructions to the letter (put the crack files in the main directory [folder] for AVG PC TuneUp 2013, replacing all). Look for RegWiz.exe in the main directory.  Run it and use whatever name and e-mail you like. After that is finished, run AVG PC TuneUp 2013.  When it asks you to enter usename/product key, use this one:

name: Senzati
product key: Q9RAD3-WJQQNR-68NKP0-8WDK62-4MDEJV-JRVWTY

AVG PC TuneUp should now start without any problems.  You may now re-enable your internet, plug in the cord, whatever.  This worked for me, and it should work for anyone else also.  I don't know how long the activation will last, or if it will even expire, I just now figured this out and wanted to share it.

Good luck!"

The link you posted was not information from AVG just posts from idiot users that don't know how to do basic computer things. In your link AVG tech said for the person to send specific info from their computer: "" Re: Scanning & Repairing Drive - Stuck On 29% #228356

,mattkilla,2013-05-03T05:08Z,"yea mR HOOK was way out of context posting that on EVERY torrent of AVG Tune up 13. The keys keep going bad but everytime i get shut down there is usually a fix by then.. follow ziero's instructions above,, JUST MAKE SURE YOUR COPY THE CRACK FILES BEFORE YOU TRY AND ENTER A PRODUCT KEY! and make sure you are NOT connected to internet... works fine for me"
