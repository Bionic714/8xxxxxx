,ps3junkie,2013-03-02T18:35Z,hey im just glad that he used avi.... i wanted an mp4 but i cant figure out why sum assholes go almost all season with mp4's wich i can watch on my tv instead of sitting huddled around the pc like iddiots when the assholes throw in a MKV... why the mkv file... why not everyone just stick with mp4..... i think they enjoy pissing people off... and then its the only person that uploads that episode... and yes convert it.... it hate that and it take way to fricken long and im not about to go buy a new pc.... im sorry i shouldnt be ranting like this... i appreciate the time you took to upload this and thank you for the opp to download...
