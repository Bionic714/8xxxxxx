Geezus dood! I've been watching you for what seems like weeks spamming every LoP post asking that, and nobody seems to answer.

If you can do a little ""leg work"" (like I did) here's what you do..

Go here:

http://subscene.com/subtitles/life-of-pi-2012/english/694060

and download..

Foreign parts only for Life.of.Pi.2012.1080p.WEB-DL.H264-CrazyHD by kaedosan

.. and either download the matching scene release or try it against any of yours. I found a ""generic"" 720p copy and it fit and synced just fine. There's ONLY a dozen or so Hindi lines in the movie anyway.. it's not like one can't comprehend what's going on without them. my mom's 88 years old, and SHE got it watching the previous screener!

Now STFU! ;-)"
