,crazy_babar,2013-02-24T16:30Z,"As usual, I Can't check everything by myself, but all the songs are supposed to be mp3 320kbps "
,pec2027,2013-02-24T21:26Z,I gave up months ago trying to download any of these 1001 album torrents from u. there are never any seeds even when they say there are. heres a perfect example not ever a day old and no seeds even tho it says there are 5.....pathetic
,crazy_babar,2013-02-25T10:55Z,"Can you please be patient pec2027 ? 
I'm uploading everything at 100kbps so it takes at least 3days to be 100% online for you guys.
My online seedboxis also running with 10mbps upload. So as soon as it will be 100% on my seedbox, it will be fast. (actually 53.6% is online)"
,crazy_babar,2013-02-25T10:56Z,"And for information, I Downloaded everything from another computer, it takes a while, but it worked fine."
,izumidude,2013-02-27T11:26Z,"You're doing a great job!  Been able to download all of your torrents, don't understand what that other guy is going on about.  Currently seeding 3 of your last torrents."
,pathetos,2013-03-03T21:30Z,Thank you very much!!!!! Seeding as much as I can
,izumidude,2013-03-09T07:28Z,Not wanting to sound too greedy - but are you going to continue to the end?  It's been a couple weeks since your last post.  Cheers!!
