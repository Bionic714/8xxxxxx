 Girls Names - a Belfast, Ireland-based group whose shambling, lo-fi tunes give a nod to old-school indie pop acts like Beat Happening, Field Mice, and Josef K - formed in 2009, initially as a duo consisting of Cathal Cully and Neil Peel. Bassist Claire was brought on board as a full-fledged member of Girls Names the following year. Girls Names' demos were released on cassette tape on the Belfast-based label Cass/Flick soon after they formed, and their first mini-album, You Should Know by Now, was released on Tough Love in the spring of 2010. A 12" EP on Captured Tracks, Don't Let Me In, followed soon after. The band next signed to Slumberland and early in 2011 released their debut album Dead to Me.
