 no explanation is possible."

==================================== Description ====================================

I have created an offline copy of BibleotecaPleyades
and all the references which were used on this website.

Why download the copy? It is great for offline reading!
Also, in case this wonderful website will be taken down,
the gathered information and evidence will not be lost.
