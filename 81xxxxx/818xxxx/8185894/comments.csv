As far as it concern to the movie it is very great movie telling a usual situations at the elderly age. I like the direction (especially a screenplay) but I seriously missed the background music. Which I think Michael Haneke didn't add to make movie as simple as possible. Yet! that was needed. yet, Thanxx again."
