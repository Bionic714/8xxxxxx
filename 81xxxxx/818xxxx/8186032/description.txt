Summary:

Can the Crystal Shard be destroyed at last?

Drizzt is determined to destroy the evil Crystal Shard, and seeks out the help of the scholar-priest Cadderly. But instead, his worst fears are realized, and Crenshinibon falls into the hands of the dark elf mercenary Jarlaxle and his unlikely ally Artemis Entreri.

The Silent Blade is the book that brought Drizzt back to the Realms, and was a New York Times best seller on its initial release--and has been in print every day since. Like the rest of the Legend of Drizzt(R) reissues, The Silent Blade features beautiful new cover art by award-winning illustrator Todd Lockwood. - Goodreads Summary of The Silent Blade (Paths of Darkness #1)

Note: This series is part of a much bigger series called the Forgotten Realms. A book recommendable to everybody, mainly for fantasy-lovers! And Book 3: The Servant of Shards is also the same book, in another series called The Sellswords (which is one of my torrents). Check it out!
