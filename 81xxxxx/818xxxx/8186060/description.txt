What is this?
Market Helper is a tool for Android that helps users to be able to change/fake their rooted devices to any other devices. It can make your Nexus 7 become Samsung Galaxy S3 in a few seconds. No reboot is required.

Why do I need to use this?
To download and install incompatible apps from Android Market / Google Play Market on your devices. For example, if you want to install Viber on your Nexus 7, switch it to Samsung Galaxy S3 and youΓÇÖll can. Or if you change your DPI value, youΓÇÖll find this app very useful.

( IΓÇÖll update this section later ;P )

Why is this app awesome?
- It DOES NOT touch your build.prop or any system files so itΓÇÖs easier and safer.

- You donΓÇÖt have to reboot the device to update the change.

- You can switch back your device to original state anytime, by using ΓÇ£RestoreΓÇ¥ feature or simply by rebooting your device ( with wifi/3g is enabled )

- Totally free
