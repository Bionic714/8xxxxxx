Chef Robert Irvine's newest mission is to save the failing restaurant, Nanny Goats Cafe and Feed Bin, in Kilgore, Texas. Owner Nancy was once a successful restaurateur, but Nanny Goats has depleted her savings, and led to the volatile relationship with her daughter that's driving customers away. With the restaurant in a financial mess, food being cooked unsafely, and a restaurant that resembles a flea market, Robert and his team will need every minute and dollar of the two day limit and $10,000 budget if they're going to save Nanny Goats.
