,blacksnc,2013-03-17T06:20Z,"Guys, you can use a program called Cracklock to extend the trial time. You have to do this:

- Add Prezi into Cracklock
- Set time to 2011/2012 or another year before.
- Check the button ""freeze date and time"" and press OK.
- Right click on the Prezi and click run.

Trial will be extended. Enjoy it."
,ChaseMc,2013-03-23T17:51Z,Thank you for this. Installation and crack work great. But There will be a Prezi logo on the bottom left in presentation mode.  Any suggestions how to remove this? Thanks
,TechBoi,2013-04-14T01:07Z,"blacksync is right. Use Crackload.

This crack doesn't work, sorry AmuLight. It will crash when opened. If it crashed when you open it, just open the crack again and un-crack it.

What I did:
1- Install the latest version (4.3.1)
2- Install Crackload
3- Open Prezi and log in. It will say ""30 days left"" or somthing like that.
4- Close Prezi
5- Open Crackload as Administrator
6- Change date to November 28, 2011. (if you do it any earlier than that, you will get Microsoft Security Certificate errors.)
7- Tick ""Freeze date and Time""
7- Go to ""Injection Mode"" tab
8- ""Static Injection""
9- Enjoy 500+ days of trial. If you finish those 500+ days, just repeat crack."
