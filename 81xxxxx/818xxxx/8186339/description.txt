Developed jointly by Oovee Entertainment and Thomson Interactive, the Class 150/2 is a recreation of these familiar second generation diesel multiple units, built by BREL in York as part of the programme to replace British Rails ageing fleet of heritage DMUs. Operating across the UK, the 150/2s soon became a familiar sight, going on to find new owners following the privatisation of the network, and continuing to carry passengers all over the country to this day. Each unit in the train formation is powered by a 286-horsepower diesel engine with hydraulic transmission, enabling the 150/2 to reach 75mph and making it ideal for local and stopping services. 

The Class 150/2 for Train Simulator features an accurately recreated driver's console complete with functioning key, AWS test, DRA, instrument lighting and cab lighting, and much more.
