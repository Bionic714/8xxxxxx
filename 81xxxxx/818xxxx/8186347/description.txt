The EMD SD 45 for Train Simulator, developed by DigitalTrainModel, is available in Southern Pacific livery and features opening cab doors and windows, accurate sounds, working brake animations, extensive locomotive lighting and power selector. 

The locomotive is also Quick Drive compatible, giving you the freedom to drive the EMD SD 45 on any Quick Drive enabled route for Train Simulator, such as those available through Steam. Also included are scenarios specifically for the Donner Pass route (available separately and required to play these scenarios).
