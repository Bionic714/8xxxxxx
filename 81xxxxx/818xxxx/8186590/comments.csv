Firstly many thanks for providing these. Great work.

I notice that you say you prefer to upload in HD but have decided to do this match in SD.

I ask that you continue with HD as it is my preference too. If people want SD they can always downsample but I prefer the quality.

My download isn't that fast either but I just prefer to wait and enjoy the quality when I do finally get it."
[T],rugbybill,2013-02-25T12:00Z,"@mastermonkey: Thanks for the feedback :)
I prefer to upload rugby in the same sort of quality that I'd like to watch it myself, in other words HD encoded with the higher quality settings. It's always a compromise between quality and time. 
I will be continuing to do the remaining Six Nations games and the majority will be HD for sure."

Thanks again, Bill."
