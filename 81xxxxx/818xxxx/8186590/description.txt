SPORT: Six Nations Rugby Union - Scotland v Ireland
On: BBC 1 HD
Date: Sunday 24th February 2013 
Time: 13:30 to 16:00 (2 hours and 30 minutes long)

Celtic cousins collide at Murrayfield as Scotland take on Ireland, introduced by John Inverdale. The home side are attempting to rebuild under new interim coach Scott Johnson after a disastrous 2012, which began with a whitewash in the Six Nations and ended with a humiliating home defeat by Tonga. Scotland's minimum target before this tournament was two wins, which would be as many as they have managed in the previous three Six Nations campaigns combined. A victory today would be no mean feat, with Ireland having won five of their six most recent Six Nations trips to Edinburgh and able to call on fit-again talisman Brian O'Driscoll. Commentary by Andrew Cotter and Philip Matthews.
