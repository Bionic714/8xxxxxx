,RedHail,2013-05-27T07:23Z,"@fiveskin1222 @opel121 this is a blueray rip (.iso) - you need a blueray player or find a program to virtually mount it on your computer. Search ""Virtual Mount ISO program"" or to burn to disc ""ISO Burner"", just opening the ISO will show the files and folders you'd find on a DVD or Blue-ray."
