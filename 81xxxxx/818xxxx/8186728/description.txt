Three months have passed since the ultimate defeat of Richard III and Lady Macbeth. Since the re-appearance of wizard-god William Shakespeare, Juliet CapuletΓÇÖs rebellion has taken a much-needed break. A new nation is building and the Council of Thirty-Seven has been structuring their government. But a different threat is rising from the border as Titus is gathering an army. Titus will strike and no one will ever feel safe again, especially now that Shakespeare has gone missing again.
