,danhimself,2013-02-25T01:29Z,so....are you going to seed this?
,danhimself,2013-02-25T01:30Z,wait....49mbs is waaaay to small for this to include more that one or two books
[V],STFmaryville,2013-02-25T03:03Z,"well whatever it is, it isn't seeded. fuck it."
,joefry,2013-02-25T05:23Z,"sorry it's not seeded guys.  I was having troubles with it and tried to delete and reupload but it would not delete.

It's as small as it is because i took pages from other scans and turned them into one book following a chronology I found"
,joefry,2013-02-25T05:31Z,"I think I figured out my seeding problem.

It should be working a bit better now."
