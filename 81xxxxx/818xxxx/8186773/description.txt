These Recovery Discs will allow you to restore your Lenovo Y580 to its factory settings. If you have installed a different HD; done a Clean Install and want to go back; if you have lost the function of the Lenovo One Key Recovery, this is for you! The discs will install Windows 8 64bit, I can only guarantee it will work for the 2099-8NU model, but it also should work for other Win 8 native Y580s (You can check the models at the 'Y580 Data Sheet.pdf'), I wouldn't try on a Win 7 though.
