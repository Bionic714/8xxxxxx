Restored the 11.10 desktop to 10.04 state for increased speed and performance. The built in search bar is completely removed.

Removed games and Libre office set, i never used it myself not worth keeping on it. Its been updated to last night as well. Should stay that way as well even after your installing. It can be installed or run as a live cd.

Built specifically for a laptop to run it live distro, crack the wifi in the area, and send http/udp style floods from that connect. Tor is installed however not functioning properly. Rev 2 will have this fixed
