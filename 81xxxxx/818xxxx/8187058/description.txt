William Marcel (Buddy) Collette (1921-2010) led his first group as a teenager.

That band included Charles Mingus who remained a lifelong friend.

Collette was a founding member of the Chico Hamilton Quintet along with 

Jim Hall and cellist Fred Katz.  The music with Hamilton has been called

"chamber jazz;" a label which is quite apt.


Collette was a lyrical reedman and flautist as well as a gifted writer.


This album showcases his considerable skills as both a player and writer.
