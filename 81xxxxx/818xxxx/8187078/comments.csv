,JAC83,2013-04-11T19:44Z,"  Works like a charm, but I do have one minor issue, I have a new Mac mini running 10.8.2 (i7 2,3GHz, 4gb ram), anyway, if I change the settings from low to medium or high, I get a bunch of graphic glitches, rectangles and lines all over the screen, the game still works but it's not playable like this. That and windowed mode will crash the game, although I didn't expect it to work.

Great work regardless."

,TehCake,2013-05-23T23:04Z,"I have an issue that makes the game unplayable. Basically, when I start in any mode, the only thing visible is water. Everything else is just a white void. Any fix?"
,TehCake,2013-05-23T23:13Z,"Oh, and from ""About This Mac"":
Mac OS X 10.7.5
2.5 GHz Intel Core i5 Processor
4 GB 1333 MHz DDR3 Memory

The game runs smoothly, with no lag at all. Just, you know, a bit hard to play without being able to see any land. It seems like a problem with the game to me."
