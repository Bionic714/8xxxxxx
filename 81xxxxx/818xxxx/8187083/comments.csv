,ominae,2013-03-02T11:09Z,"first i must thank you for your uploads, they are a godsend for anyone who loves games but has a mac. I've been looking for this game for awhile but couldn't find anything. Couldn't get this one to work though, just the icon bounces a few seconds then goes away. I'd love to see this bundled with the insect expansion. Or Neverwinter nights 1 or 2 with all the expansions.
