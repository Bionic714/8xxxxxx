Information
------------------------------

This six-part series presents the definitive history of archaeology, a 250-year worldwide odyssey that began with the unearthing of the ruins of Pompeii buried beneath the ash of Mt. Vesuvius. In a short time, archaeologists started pursuing very different objectives: some were treasure-seekers hoping to plunder antiquities of the ancient world; others sought to prove theories about the origins of civilization or the historical accuracy of Homer or the Bible; still others focused on humans themselves, trying to determine the age of the species. The series also looks at how archaeology has been misused as an instrument of foreign policy and where the study is going in the future with new technologies and methods.




3)  Digging by the Book 
Program Archaeology

While most read Homer's Iliad as an entertaining epic, one man believed it was more than a story and could actually be used as a literary map to find ancient Troy; his name was Heinrich Schliemann and he found treasure and a buried city in what is now Turkey. But was it Troy? This video looks at "program archaeology," how archaeologists dig in the ground to find evidence for the stories in books. In a similar context, the episode covers the work of Flinders Petrie, who unearthed proof that the Israelites had really once lived in Egypt. Inspired by Schliemann's example and Petrie's findings, a whole wave of excavations ensued with the hopes of verifying the existence of various figures from the Bible.
