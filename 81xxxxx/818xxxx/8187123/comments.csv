,hagehun,2013-03-15T17:04Z,"If you have a white screen with two windows, then the wrapper needs an update.
Right click on wrapper, run wineskin - Advanced - Tools - Update wrapper.

I updated to 2.5.9 and it works like a charm."

,cemagaga,2013-04-06T12:44Z,"Had a little problem when launching the game, it gave me a white screen with a small square with the title Port Royale 3, could anyone help me?"
,cemagaga,2013-04-06T12:45Z,"Sorry went trough the comment and found solution, real sorry for the trouble"
,byoonbyoon,2013-04-14T15:29Z,"ad567

Unfortunately, your method has proven ineffective for me. While I can open and view the options.cfg folder, it is a read-only volume and cannot be unlocked. I tried making a duplicate and replacing the original, but that didn't work either. Any advise would be excellent."
