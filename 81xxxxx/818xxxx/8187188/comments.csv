,henrytilk,2013-02-25T00:13Z,"@Chrizrolex Because the show is 1 hour long, and it  is available to download after the show is finished."
,Chrizrolex,2013-02-25T02:06Z,"@henrytilk Yeah, In normal basis the show is available as a torrent approx. 5-15min after it ends on air. 

This episode however was available to download 60 minutes later than usually. And I wonder in curiosity why it happend today."
,rastamees,2013-02-25T02:16Z,"this is a bloody good episode !
james may in the range rover was very interesting
and also clarkson & hammond were very funny, especially the ending !"
,pr0xZen,2013-02-25T03:22Z,"Actually, here on TPB there was one (legit) out already at 21.38 GMT. Its a tad bit later than the typical routine, but could easily be down to having a fag or taking a shit. Encoders have lives, needs and urges too ^^,

And, just now a REPACK came up, so a quick fix to a bad encode could also be the reason. Who knows. BBC2's airing chedule shows airing at 8 pm."
,kaozgamer,2013-02-25T03:42Z,"a/v: 10

@blink1n - i think its something wrong with your computer. sound is all good for me"
,Tuckle,2013-02-25T10:35Z,"If you don't like the fact that you had to wait an hour (yes, ALL of an hour...) you have 3 options.  
1 - Watch it live on TV
2 - Watch it somewhere else
3 - STFU and be glad that you are getting quality FREE shows from ettv.  "
,Chrizrolex,2013-02-27T21:32Z,"@Tuckle No no, dont misjudge me. I'm asking in pure curiosity.

I want to point out that I was not complaining that the shows was uploaded one hour late.  Only asked in curiosity.

Thank you."
