 Detroit completes the US Cities X range around the great lakes. "Motown" as many call it, is one of the largest cities in the US, full of history, home to a major hub for Delta Airlines and home to some large industry corporations. Detroit is without a doubt the industry capital of the US.

But it is going through some dire straits as the heavy industry found it hard to compete with other nations. Unemployment forced many people (up to 25%) to leave the area. The massive traffic jams of the 1980ΓÇÖs are only a memory. But Detroit has a strong spirit and seems to be leaving the problems behind. The low prices draw young people and the heavy industry is slowly replaced with smaller more agile companies.

Like most other activities aviation took a hit but passenger numbers are increasing. Detroit Metro and the many other smaller airports make this a complex and busy environment for pilots.  But there are many rewards, the region looks great from the air. Even outside of the downtownΓÇÖs boundaries there are some fascinating sights from the air: Let it be the Dearborn test track, which was one of the first international airports in history, Detroit Metro, one of the largest airports in the country, a military airport at the shores of Lake St. Clair and islands with airports scattered along the course of the St. Clair and Detroit rivers that are home to thousands of vacation homes that can often only be reached by boat.
