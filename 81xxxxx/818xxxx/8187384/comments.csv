,dbbfc,2013-02-25T06:42Z,Do any of the other files have good audio and picture quality. This one is driving me nuts!  
,seevee1969,2013-02-25T06:55Z,"There is a Repack for the SD version re unsynched audio, best to wait for the HD repack"
,schmolch,2013-02-25T08:58Z,"A/V is a little out of sync. 
With audio set to -200ms it's fine for me."
,schmolch,2013-02-25T09:42Z,Correction: Later on it's full of video errors. This is a shit release.
,Froglet,2013-02-25T11:30Z,Thanks for the feedback guys. I guess I can wait a day or so for a clean HD version.
