PS- Most of them are also fond of Made in Chelsea, when that comes out!
Peace :)"

As a massive Aussie fan of TOWIE - thanx you for your prompt uploads! I think we're only up to season 5 over here, and Gary has been awesome at keeping TOWIE tragics like me up to date! 

Gary - wishing you health and happiness,, and thanx for helping to feed my TOWIE addiction and that of my fellow Aussies who can't get reliable access to UK tv :)

Cheers, Lianne"
