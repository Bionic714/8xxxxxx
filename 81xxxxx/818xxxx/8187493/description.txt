*Note: You can download both or only choose which version you'd prefer by deselecting the one you don't want when you add the torrent to your client software.  If you're adding the torrent via magnet link, you can deselect any undesired file in the list of files once the torrent has begun downloading.

Marriage and family are the most important components of the community. It's in the book. Go ahead and look it up yourself. The official charter of Fabletown laws hold little the government as a whole can do to interfere in family matters. Mostly this is a good thing. Once in a great while-like in this issue, for instance-it isn't. Also, Bigby and Stinky continue their road trip, trying to catch the hint of a scent of the missing cubs.


Thanks goes to theProletariat for this release.
