Terrorists are plotting to destroy Wentworth Industries while the mesmerist who calls himself The Hater targets The Spider's closest allies. With the clock ticking and lives in the balance, The Spider must figure out how to be in two places at once - and how to stop a friend used as a puppet to commit murder.
