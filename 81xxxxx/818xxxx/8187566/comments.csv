,FonZeD,2013-02-25T10:01Z,Thank's but it's loosy (15Khz; -50dB).

No, it is not lossy.  It is lossless FLAC, the waveform spikes hit 22k as you can see in this screenshot.

,sunseb,2013-02-25T11:22Z,"Yes, track #2 - Blizzard is loseless, but what's about track #13 - Endless ? MPEG (100%) ? Weird."

[V],politux,2013-02-25T11:59Z,"I love how the ones who have never uploaded anything like to complain about the album they just got for free.  

If you don't like my uploads don't download them.

You're very welcome my friend.  Kind words are appreciated when one is confronted with troll comments. "
,iamrockketman,2013-02-26T03:55Z,"Hey great torrent! I was wondering if you can upload possibly a 320 kbps version of it, I dont have anything to convert it to it as well as FLAC doesn't work with itunes"
,gabinary,2013-02-26T17:20Z,"Thanks a lot,dude ! French touche is just...
the Daft Punks even helped Kavinsky on this one !"
,ogstankyfluff,2013-02-27T01:29Z,"@sunseb

lol track 13 isnt mpeg you fucktard. fuck outta here noob. its 863kbps flac"
,ogstankyfluff,2013-02-27T01:31Z,and thank you uploader for not uploading transcodes. i hate those fool on here downloading flac songs that were just converted. that wont magically increase the sound quality you dumb fucktards. learn your shit.
[V],politux,2013-02-27T11:53Z,"I can admit when I'm wrong, track 13 is infact sourced from mpeg.  No idea why and I want to apologize but the rest of the album is lossless.  Also keep in mind this is a public tracker and you should be thankful that people are uploading at all and asking for nothing in return.  

Had I know track 13 was suspect I wouldn't have uploaded it, obviously.  This was sourced from web. "
,nbmatt,2013-02-28T00:26Z,"Thanks, man! I didn't even know this came out until today, haha. "
,bobfaustenmelmoth,2013-03-04T12:04Z,Thank you. Great Kavinsky!
[V],-wxm-,2013-03-20T21:06Z,I heard that Kavinsky will put together an entire radio station in GTA V.  Hopefully it's all original content because these dudes sound so effin cool.
