Owl pose some intriguing questions on their second full-length album, The Right Thing on Overit Records.

ΓÇ£So many things are up in the air today,ΓÇ¥ ponders frontman Chris Wyse. ΓÇ£A lot of times you ask yourself, ΓÇÿAre we doing the right thing?ΓÇÖ ItΓÇÖs a simple question, but also profound. WeΓÇÖre always wondering if weΓÇÖre moving in the right direction.ΓÇ¥

Musically, the trio has nothing to worry about. They bravely continue to forge ahead on the right path. Approaching timeless rock structures through a healthy amount of experimentation and instrumental intricacy, the group takes flight locked and loaded with unforgettable hooks and impressive delivery.  ItΓÇÖs a combination that instantly impacts and takes up residence inside your head as all great hard rock should.

After releasing their self-titled debut in 2009, Owl captivated audiences alongside the likes of Helmet and Jet to Hollywood all-star rock collective Camp Freddy. Between touring and recording commitments with WyseΓÇÖs other gig ΓÇô playing bass in The Cult ΓÇô Owl began writing what would become the bandΓÇÖs self-produced The Right Thing in early 2011. Sessions took place in Matt SorumΓÇÖs Drac Studios in Los Angeles as well as at DinsmoreΓÇÖs own O Studios in the mountains of upstate New York.

ΓÇ£Although the first album was heavy and bombastic, I feel like our new record is even more engaging and exhilarating on various levels,ΓÇ¥ Dinsmore reveals. ΓÇ£ThereΓÇÖs an honesty that shines through. We were all in the moment, and it shows. If you let it, this record will take you on a wild ride.ΓÇ¥

The title track boasts a propulsive drumbeat that drives into staggering distortion as Wyse muses,ΓÇ£You couldnΓÇÖt handle. YouΓÇÖre tripping. You canΓÇÖt trust yourselfΓÇ£. The song teeters between brooding and hypnotic as the band roars to life.

On the other end of the spectrum, they transform The KinksΓÇÖ classic ΓÇ£DestroyerΓÇ¥ into a swaggering futuristic stomper. ItΓÇÖs got a classic energy, but itΓÇÖs still unequivocally Owl.

Elsewhere on the album, Wyse delves into his Irish roots on the rousing ΓÇ£Rover,ΓÇ¥ and welcomes guest drummer Johnny Tempesta of The Cult on the electrifying, tribal beat-driven ΓÇ£All Day.ΓÇ¥

ΓÇ£PerfectΓÇ¥ contemplates a perfect day over an ethereal soundscape flush with emotion. Wyse shares, ΓÇ£Sometimes you have those special moments where everything feels perfect. You get a flash of clarity and are able to reach another level. ItΓÇÖs about cherishing those simple times when the dark parts of life just donΓÇÖt matter.ΓÇ¥

Mezilis concludes, ΓÇ£We approach music in a slightly unorthodox way, but our aim has always been to take listeners places theyΓÇÖve never been before.ΓÇ¥

ThatΓÇÖs undeniably The Right Thing for Owl and listeners everywhere.
