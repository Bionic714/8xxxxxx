Last year, the Academy Award-winning film The Hurt Locker introduced audiences around the globe to the high-pressure world of the brave men and women who diffuse and dismantle explosives in some of the most high-pressure terrorist hotbeds. However, when it comes to this specialized and incredibly dangerous military job, make believe is nothing compared to the real thing. Now for the first time, G4 will take viewers to Afghanistan with real members of the United States Navy who have trained extensively to face the specialized challenges that come with this high-risk military position and are honored to wear the Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) badge. This is action, suspense and drama unlike anything captured on film before and failure is never an option.
