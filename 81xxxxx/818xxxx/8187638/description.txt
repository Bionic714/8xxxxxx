Join us in the courtroom scene of 1 John 2:1-14 as we read Jesus the Son is our advocate with God the Father. Learn the meaning of sin and what constitutes salvation as we gain understanding of how Jesus took the hit for all sin and death, in our stead! Wherever we are in our walk with the Lord, be encouraged in the steadiness of knowing Him.
