This MuchTalks special aired directly after S12E32 on February 22, 2013.

Before anyone asks, no I did NOT cap S12E32, as I figured the scene (2HD?) would be doing it, as they usually do. I see it hasn't surfaced yet.

2HD has been pretty good at filling in the holes as episodes repeat, so cross your fingers they will catch it someday.

Anyhow, due to the serious subject nature of the episode (suicide), Much held a discussion forum afterwards with cast and fans discussing the episode.
