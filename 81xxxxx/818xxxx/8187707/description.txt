Ricki sits down with gay individuals who are navigating the world of parenting.

Rosie O'Donnell joins the conversation to discuss her role as a gay parent advocate and introduces the latest member of her family. Ricki also discusses personal triumphs, tribulations and hilarious misadventures with Dan Bucatinsky, the actor on ABC's hit show "Scandal" and author of "Does This Baby Make Me Look Straight?" Comedian Anthony Spock stops by to share how his mother came out when he was 22 years-old and, inadvertently, provided unseen advantages for his comedy career.

And, Ricki chats with Elise and Andrea who, after years of trying to get pregnant, signed up to be foster parents and soon found themselves with three healthy, happy children.

In addition, Noah St. John, a star student and frequent spoken-word performer who was recently seen on NPR's "Snap Judgment," recounts the break-up of his two mothers and performs his celebrated spoken-word piece.
