This is from the 1989 Headless Cross Tour. Tony Martin is on vocals and Tony Iommi is the only original band member left.
The sound quality on this one is amazing. The only downside is that there's almost zero crowd noise, so it sometimes sounds weird when they finish a song, there's complete silence and he says "Thank you very much!"
