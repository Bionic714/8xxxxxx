On the live Sunday, February 24 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex runs down a DOJ memo analyzing registration and ultimately confiscation of all firearms by the government under the auspices of a national "buyback" program and other schemes aimed directly at the heart of the Second Amendment. 

Alex also analyzes efforts by the establishment to exploit a racial war to take down America and set the stage for an authoritarian takeover.
