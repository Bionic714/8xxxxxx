,acktdp,2013-02-28T16:15Z,WTF....What is with the survey crap I thought the whole idea here was to get away from this.  I d/led from another source that does not require filling out forms
,leestrato,2013-03-01T12:16Z,what is this winrar file that needs a password that you only get by filling out surveys with all your info required? If you dont want to share freely then dont upload your files. always someone trying to make money out of something thats supposed to be piratebay not survey bay. FUCK YOU ettv.FUCK YOU and anyone who supports that bullshit
,DrMerman,2013-03-01T15:30Z,"All good as always with ettv and eztv
It's trusted so dont believe all that password crap"
,leestrato,2013-03-01T19:50Z,"Believe all the ""password crap"" because it's true, this is a scam WINRAR file requiring a password to unlock which you can only get by filling out surveys online which require your personal details. Seems [ettv] has found a way of making money from piratebay. FUCK YOU ettv and all you scum that support this bullshit."
,leestrato,2013-03-01T20:00Z,"Believe all the ""password crap"" because it's true!

,sirantonius,2013-03-02T01:53Z,"@leestrato
Why are you slandering this quality torrent?
This is not a WINRAR file; it is one video file.
That's it.
Fuck YOU.
...Thank you ettv; I always enjoy your uploads."
,leestrato,2013-03-02T19:46Z,"@sirantonious 
I dont know what file you have dloaded but the file i got was winrar archive requiring a password, so fuck YOU!"

,xanat0s,2013-03-07T09:48Z,of course this isn't a pass protected rar... trolling is the corporate goons newest hi-tech method of deterring piracy. 
,xanat0s,2013-03-07T09:51Z,"@waldorfx and seriously bro stop posting that shit. if we want subs, we all kno how to fucking google"
,Twiddler_13,2013-03-07T21:40Z,"The file is fine. If you select a file, then download it, find out that it's crap, then come back to the WRONG place to place a comment, well, you're an idiot.

If this password/RAR file thing is corporate trying to fight piracy, well that's a different matter.

Either way, THIS file is fine."
