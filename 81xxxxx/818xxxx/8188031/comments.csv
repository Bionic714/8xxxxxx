,davidfletcher142,2013-02-26T11:58Z,"could someone put some serials here , nod32 says the keygen is a trojan and i dont want to take the risk. just add a comment with 10 serials or something"
[V],asupergeek,2013-03-03T14:41Z,Thank you :)
,CountryCousin,2013-03-03T19:30Z,"No point to provide '10 serials' since you have to generate them based on your unique hardware challenge code.
Byte a bullet and run keygen. It is clean anyway, and your nod32 is piece of crap."
,ThePoet1408,2013-03-07T01:09Z,"@CountryCousin

You're dumb.
This is a virus.
Don't download.

P.S
My AV brought up a threat warning before I even finished downloading the KeyGen.
Also, I've never gotten a virus notification from TPB.  Not even with KeyGens."
,tvjab,2013-03-10T03:21Z,installing right now...so far so good keygen worked fine also :)
,tvjab,2013-03-10T03:58Z,update --- finished install just as described in directions and it all works great!!!!!
,vinivitesmw456,2013-03-13T02:35Z,"I used this DR16C22-QY2R8RM-ULFU4YL-2FJJ748
but there's no use to post anything else because it requires your hardware unique blah blah blah. 

Please ignore the virus waring, because almost any anti-virus that have a paid version will try to make you be afraid of everything and want to pay. Basic and greedy economics.

I'd recommend an open-source (obviously totally free) anti-virus, like Clamwin."
,uclwong,2013-03-14T08:44Z,"Can any one help me up on this? I click on the ""GET THIS TORRENT"", it reacts no reaction although i have upgraded to the latest Torch"
,legalbrr2,2013-03-19T00:44Z,"When your anti-virus tells you something, look what is the problem. You'll often see something like ""Keymaker.gen"". This "".gen"" indicates GENERIC detection. In other words, this program (keygen) is trying to read information from other programs (the one you're trying to crack!?), and this is unusual. So, your anti-virus report a ""Generic"" warning. It IS A FALSE POSITIVE.

If you have any doubts, install ""Total Uninstall"", make a snapshot before running the keygen, and another one after running it. You'll see that no changes are made to your computer, proving that there's no virus on it.

Ps: 95% of keygens will be reported by anti-virus. In my case, all the times were false-positive. If you have any doubts, always download from VIP users (like Scene4All)."
