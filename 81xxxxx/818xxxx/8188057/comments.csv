So, this ep 8 is from a new source, only because it showed up almost a day early. Watching it seems fine in all but one tiny respect. I should mention that I've been mis-labeling eps 1-7 as ""HDTV"" when they are in fact ""WEB-DL"", while this ep IS ""HDTV"".
.
Anyway, I think it detracts when the scenes are seperated by the ""Mr. Selfridge"" logo. Kind of breaks the mood for me. Not enough to make me wait an extra day - but I wanted to mention it. Anyone else with input is strongly urged to contribute an opinion.
.
FWIW - WEB-DL sources are NEVER smaller than 720p, for which I made a snap decisiuon to keep quality (whateverthehellthatmeans) consistent and I passed up the quick and easy MP4 for the 720p MKV.
.
Sadly, I've yet to see any significant opinion on the two sources. It is a complex issue. Now that I 2pass everythiung, no matter the source - 720p take nearly three times as long as an MP4 to download and encoding it takes nearly four times as long.
.
And, as stated, being the ""burger flipper"" for the masses, I think I've made the correct choice that if it's ""good enough"", then getting it maybe an hour earlier is just fine with folks who only want the sound to sync and the picture not to do anything abruptly wrong.
.
Again, opinions in any direction are very much welcome here.
.
And sure, gotta get in a final tiny petty dig - ""The Scene"" cannot be reached for comment at any time on any subject - all that ivory tower monopoly stuff has clearly gone to their heads.
.
Alright - when they get it right and mostly they do - they do it very well. I just think we would all be better served by competition in the marketplace - monopolies are just a way of pointing out that the Soviet Union collapsed because without competition, you don't even know if you're going in the right direction.
