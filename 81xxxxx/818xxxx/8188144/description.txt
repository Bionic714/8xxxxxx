Few local artists have changed as dramatically over the course of a few years as local singer/songwriter Aby Wolf. In the space of the time between her 2009 debut Sweet Prudence and her self-titled follow up, A. Wolf and Her Claws, Wolf has undergone both a name change and a band recruitment (adding vibraphonist Joey Van Phillips, keyboardist/vocalist Linnea Mohn, and synthesist/programmer Jesse Whitney). She has also transitioned from a homespun folktronic artist to a fully-fledged practitioner of electronic pop. Even WolfΓÇÖs look has changed ΓÇô seeing her now with an ultra-modern haircut and prominent tattoos itΓÇÖs hard to even recall the acoustic-toting rural Illinois gal of just a few years back.

Still, while much has changed about WolfΓÇÖs look and sound certain things do remain constant. On her new record the singerΓÇÖs pipes are as pristine as ever. While she doesnΓÇÖt spend much time looping and mixing her vocal tracks (which for a while looked like the direction she was headed) Wolf leads each tune with the limitless confidence of someone with a flawless singing voice. On vox Wolf is also ably backed by the talented Linnea Mohn, a scene veteran who also currently sings in Rogue Valley.

Lyrically speaking Wolf is still an intimately personal songwriter. When she details the everyday struggles of life, she casts herself as protagonist and inflects each song with uplifting and empowering themes. Whether sheΓÇÖs wrestling with her own metaphorical artistic demons or moving on from a failed romance, WolfΓÇÖs words are like a mantra for anti-defeatism. Even in her most fragile moments, which here seems to be lovely piano-inflected tune ΓÇ£Disassembled,ΓÇ¥ Wolf sounds far more interested in growing and learning than she is in feeling sorry for herself.

A. Wolf and Her Claws contains a full, pop-oriented sound that skews electronic but also incorporates slight elements of dub/reggae and hip hop. While Wolf doesnΓÇÖt rap per se, she does occasionally take on vocal cadences that arenΓÇÖt too far off of the fact. Occasionally one canΓÇÖt help but hear some similarities to local rapper Dessa, who Wolf frequently performs with and who has in fact, made a recent vocal transition of her own (in her case from hip hop to R&B). The dub/reggae footprint is pretty small, but on tracks like ΓÇ£Zero to 60ΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£All This TimeΓÇ¥ the synths definitely take on a flavor that is distinctly Caribbean. And while those particular tunes lend the album a poppy, dance feel ΓÇô the tone is balanced out overall by the addition of a healthy dose of slower, heavier songs.
