It fairly makes my head spin that I've come to occupy my position so quickly and easily. But one specific thing has been nagging the back of my brain. It's that statement about quality. The historic logic has always been that a file this long should be 350MB and use a bit rate of 1024Kbpw.
.
But I've been doing 768Kbps and about 288MB and most of those who watch it say the quality is somewhere between ""just fine"" and ""great"".
.
And then, almost like clockwork someone comes in, to inform me of the terrible mistake I'm making. The problem is - they NEVER have a specific complaint (you know the scene where the whatsis does the thingy - doesn't look good at all) - they just insist that the ideo looks bad - flying completely in the face of reality and the facts.
.
I still can't understand why 272p looks so good on my 1080p monitor.
.
But I think it's working it's way along the back neurons in my skull and this is what I've come up with:
.
The monopoly that is running this enterprise (""The Scene"") made an executive decision so long ago and without opposition, became the video religion around here. THEY decided 350MB ... THEY decided 1024Kbps ... just as THEY decided (against demonstrable facts) that MP4 is preferred and better than AVI. That last is an ongoing battle, so we'll back-burner it for now.
.
But the other one strikes true to me. Nobody ever did any testing on file sizes and bit rates - somebody used them, they seemed like a nice round number, so it became essential fact along the lines of Aristotle's ""heavy things fall faster than light things"".
.
They, of course picked these numbers so video would fit evenly on a CD. What really bummed me out was when DVDs only held 12.9 videos and I was waiting (in vain) for them to drop the size just a tiny bit so 13 eps could fit on a DVD. But they never did.
.
I have noticed that in the new MP4 paradigm, there are no file size or bit rate mandates, which strikes me as extremely odd. LOL is dropping ""Elementary"" and ""Scandal"" bit rates below 600Kbps and somebody's alarm bells should be going of somewhere.
.
Meanwhile, I'm having a great time and all the folks like you who think XVID / AVI, even at a reduced bit rate is good enough on the quality front for you and many others. When people really start to notice how CPU intensive their viewing experience has become, they may well wish a return to ""great"" before ""new"" got shoved down our throats - in spite of reality.

I do know my old player doesnt like the 264 files and so I deliberately look for xvid/avi.  I have watched your videos on my computer monitor using VLC with no problems and have transferred them to USB stick to watch on a Television (32"" I think) and again, no problems.  Your numbers are fantastic as far as I am concerned!  Thanks for all your hard work!"
