,pmw59,2013-02-25T16:21Z,MP4SUX is right keep the AVI's coming
,pmw59,2013-02-25T16:22Z,I don't mean the person MP4SUX sucks just MP4's
[V],MP4SUX,2013-02-25T23:17Z,"From my perspective (and mine from the beginning) MP4 SUX in exactly two ways.
.
1) Using their monopoly status to force something demonstrably less popular than AVI.
See how I test this theory in the comments section for:
Whitney.S02E10.Breaking.Dad.HDTV.XVID-AVIGUY.avi
Please attempt your own tests so a dialog can be started.
.
2) ""The Scene"" clearly wasn't ready for this, but they pushed ahead anyway.
This has led to a couple problems, one serious enough to bring me out of lurking.
Anyone who's downloaded for a long time notice that many RGs are doing less.
This has somehow left the bulk of EVERY evening's fair up to LOL / DIM.
Whether defective hardware (or just inferior to the task), defective paradigm.
LOL (and therefore ""The Scene"") are having terrible pixelation problems.
Which for some unknown reason they won't fix - won't even admit the problem.
But if LOL is the only one screwing it up, you'd think they'd let others help.
