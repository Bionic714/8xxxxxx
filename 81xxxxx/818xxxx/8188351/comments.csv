,binkmale,2013-02-25T14:15Z,"This puppy is VERY thinly seeded.

I'm connected to 200 peers - the pack is stuck at 79% completion.   It -is- slowly creeping up, which means that somebody is seeding them.   Should improve to usable by Monday morning in FreedomLand®."
,Papinos1,2013-02-25T14:29Z,"Nice, with this speed in three years I'm gonna watch it...My utorrent sead so..."
,binkmale,2013-02-25T15:57Z,"The pack is up to 92% now;  in about an hour from this message posting, there should be a serious improvement in seed availability."
,AlexLibman,2013-02-25T15:57Z,"This torrent didn't download while I was sleeping for 8 hours, and still says ""remaining time unknown"".  Upon waking I find EZTV has come through with their version 7 hours ago, and the EZTV version is downloading at a decent speed (1.5mB/s).

Time to jump ship...

[T],SCSA420,2013-02-28T06:26Z,"To ensure that you can get proper MKV and MP4 playback be sure you have installed the K-lite codec pack full version or mega version both of which comes with Media Player Classic Home Cinema and configure it properly for .mkv and MP4 playback. If you do not have it you can get it here below:

Once installed you can playback the .mkv file with the following players:

Media Player Classic or Windows Media Player. "

,Arsany_Moses,2013-03-01T18:23Z,i need subtitel
,longnh,2013-03-03T15:31Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD!

The video is fair good, but the audio is shit. Audio is not synced with video at all. I tried to edit the audio speed but there's no luck because of the ratio between video and audio. Now I'll have to delete 3.6 GB. That's suck."
,longnh,2013-03-03T15:44Z,"Sorry, my bad. For anyone who suffers unsynced problem between video and audio, use Media Classic and the error's gone. Thanks for uploading."
