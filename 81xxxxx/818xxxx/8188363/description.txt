This is not the official edit of the movie. This is a Fan Edit.

I am aware that this movie has won the Oscar for best editing. I believe the law firm conference room scenes edited throughout the movie hurt the flow of the movie.

I believe the story is so powerful that it would have a greater impact if you tell it in a chronological order without showing how peopleΓÇÖs relationships have changed in advance. All those scenes have been moved.

Approximately 5 minutes have been cut and new music has been added in 2 places.
