[T],theburningbush,2013-02-25T07:35Z,"In past years, it was common for these to be uploaded in (at least) two pieces, so you could download a piece and begin watching it while the other piece(s) were downloading. I miss that. 

That being said...thanks for this!"
,dizzytyron,2013-02-25T07:40Z,"Me too, cheers."
,hmac2,2013-02-25T08:46Z,"Thanks! My mom and wife will appreciate this (I will tune in for Seth). I'm on 100Mbit and will continue to seed for a couple days.

@theburningbush I'm pretty sure modern BitTorrent applications can begin streaming the movie during the download."
