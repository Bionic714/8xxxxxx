My plan was to upload (2) versions of this masterwork, but the 1954 Reiner/Chicago

is already available here at TPB.  It sets the standard by which all other 

interpretations of this inspired composition are measured.



SO...I offer this 1988 recording on TELARC which has the ambience of an empty 

concert hall and the dynamics that Telarc boasts of.


The odd double folder exists because uploading the REINER would have been redundant

and I didn't want to redo the rip if deleting the inclusive empty folder somehow 

screwed things up.
