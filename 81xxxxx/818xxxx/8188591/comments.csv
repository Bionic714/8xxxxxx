,gamer13_,2013-02-25T11:21Z,"Wow with 10 times as many leechers as downloaders, this'll probably take a while.

Just an fyi that might lighten the load: you can stream the Oscars on hulu and abc by monday morning (6am eastern)."
,kodokapi,2013-02-25T11:48Z,aaaaaa
,zielix,2013-02-25T12:43Z,"Somebody PLEASEEEEE SEEEEEEDDDDD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

,Badrdiin,2013-02-25T13:32Z,how can i seed ?
,gndlng,2013-02-25T14:10Z,this might take a while lol. 4k seeders and 17k leechers. less than 2kB/s dl.
,ScarletteSpider,2013-02-25T14:59Z,"why so slow? from what I'm seeing in the peers cluster, NO one that has 100% is seeding this.
Only ppl seeding are others like me that are still waiting for it to finish downloading.
I will seed with unlimited bandwidth speeds once i have 100%
Unlike others, I don't leech and my seeding doesn't auto stop till i've reached 12 times ratio and over 30 minutes of no one downloading from me after the 12 time ratio. 
I want my stuff fast so I am generous with my bandwidth for seeding so others can get it fast too.
Only wish others weren't so stingy"
,Afzal8920,2013-02-25T15:28Z,great
,XD1992,2013-02-25T16:59Z,leechers...leechers everywhere! 
,ScarletteSpider,2013-02-25T19:06Z,"just achieved 100% so the bandwidth speeds to other downloaders is limited only by my internet provider which is about 850kps, i have it set on unlimited so up your download speeds while you can.
ty to those that gave generously of their bandwidths to me so could pass it on!
V = 9.5 (what little flaws are due to the broadcasters not the uploader)
A = 10"

,Mirzaei,2013-02-27T18:46Z,Good quality. Definitely worth downloading.
,seednope,2013-02-28T21:27Z,all you people begging for seeders make me sick.  Do you really think anyone seeds because of your stupid comments?
