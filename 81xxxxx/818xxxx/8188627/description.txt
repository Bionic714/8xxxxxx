"Loose Lips Sink Ships"

The 10 remaining teams compete in Bora Bora. One
duo's fear of water leads to extreme panic; and
one racer suffers a possible race-ending injury
while running to the pit stop.

Rules are unclear if a show such as this would
be 'reality' or 'competitive reality'. Due to
this being a literal race involving lots of
running and high motion we went with
'competitive'.
