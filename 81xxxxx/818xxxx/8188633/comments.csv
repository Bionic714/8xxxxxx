If some one, lets call him Mr leech. was thinking of downloading all he time and let agree that some one is possibly going to download more then they can watch in one life time. But this imaginary person is the sort of person that if downloading in the future does not want to be a leech so they thought, or then- would leave what they are not able to watch in the torrent program  as to ""seed"" would that person or persons come to realize that there is no way they could even seed 1 torrent to the desired ratio before that torrent when the way of the DoDo? so - how would some person or bot or imagined being go about seeding  to get the best result if they choose??
