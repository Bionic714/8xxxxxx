The sixth of Fraser's books detailing the history and adventures of Harry Flashman, the bully of TOM BROWN'S SCHOOLDAYS who went on to become a soldier, an inadvertent hero, and an empire-builder. This installment follows Harry as he traverses the high seas in search of Elspeth, the light of his life, who has been kidnapped by pirates. Along the way, ever the cad, he has several dalliances with exotic beauties and avoids confrontation whenever possible, nonetheless emerging (however fraudulently) as a hero of the highest order.
