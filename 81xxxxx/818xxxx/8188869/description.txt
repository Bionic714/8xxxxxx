Readers who use this text are motivated to learn mathematics. They become more confident and are better able to appreciate the beauty and excitement of the mathematical world.
That's why the new Ninth Edition of Musser, Burger, and Peterson's best-selling textbook focuses on one primary goal: helping students develop a true understanding of central concepts using solid mathematical content in an accessible and appealing format. The components in this complete learning program--from the textbook, to the eManipulative activities, to the online problem-solving tools and the resource-rich website--work in harmony to help achieve this goal.
