[V],RubrumPopulus,2013-02-27T13:45Z,"Hey reneshakil. Nice job on this upload. :)
I was hoping to send you a forum PM. Do you have an account in the SuprBay forum?"
,PTodd,2013-02-28T00:03Z,Thanks for your uploads!  You provide some of the more obscure stuff that nobody else does!
,reneshakil,2013-02-28T18:38Z,"thanks all :)
@RubrumPopulus: i cant open SuprBay account. everytime i want to register it says ""Your details match those of a known spammer, therefore you have been disallowed registration."" now what is this???
@PTodd: i start upload as a gap filler. u can see that i upload 1 or 2 days later than everybody else. I just want to upload files that others misses. its because my upload speed is average 10kb/s (unbelievable but true in my country) so i cant upload like others."
,reneshakil,2013-02-28T20:21Z,@RubrumPopulus: registered with reneshakil. u can pm me now.
