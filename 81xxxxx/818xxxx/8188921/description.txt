  Based out of Auckland, New Zealand, electro-pop duo Kids of 88 are a throwback to the pulsing sounds of the ΓÇÿ80s. Jordan Arts and Sam McCarthy initially met in school after bonding over a shared love of music in an English class. Arts and McCarthy debuted their slithering, synth-heavy sound in 2008 and self-released their first single, ΓÇ£My House,ΓÇ¥ on their own Dryden Street label in 2009. The song took off, eventually being certified platinum in New Zealand and drawing the attention of Sony Music. Kids of 88 made their full-length debut the following year with Sugarpills, and set out on the road in support of Kesha later that year. In 2011, the band followed up with the five-song Sugarpills EP.
