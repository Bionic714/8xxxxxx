[V],psspss,2013-02-26T00:28Z,"i love the theme music.. best for any ghost show.. airy and great lyrics

the episodes were the gold mine ghost town, cementry and psych hosp but most were good followed by riccardton house and dunedin castle"
[V],psspss,2013-02-26T00:31Z,"plays great in VLC with sharpener but also worked well with twonkyserver 6.030 from a old NAS box as long as it werent too busy else it would go out of sync.. which was easy to fix by scroll back a little by a few seconds never nas boxes will be fine and also serviio media server always works espc if use panasonic veria profile so it transcodes to all tvs like sony and samsung

note the drm stream (copies) used a old ver of tunebites to rip them back in 2005, and i see it used 32K not 128 ,160 or 192 like my tv rips I did.. but seems to be no issue with sound from what I heard.. "
