NZ Ghost Hunt - New Zealand Paranormal TV Series (2005) Season 1 Complete+Extras Xvid Avi Headers Fix and Audio Resynced


As this was the first ever rips I did back in 2005 when I did my
first share to p2p.. I was new to stream ripping and software editor
since then I have re-edited the originals I did making the headers
better and Resyncing some of the audio which was -200ms out on the
originals.. plus I have renamed them and added city names that were known
some places werent revealed the exact locations like the Psych Hospital

Still a great series and some great evidence caught and the first
to INVENT the back and head POV cameras to capture what they see and
to film them and reactions without BIG CAMERA crews following them

(sorry GA you werent the first :))


Ive prob watched this over 4 times now.. always a great watch
and the NZ girl (former tv host for children shows) is a hotty :)
