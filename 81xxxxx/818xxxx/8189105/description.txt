Privacy Eraser Pro is a very useful program for cleaning up the history of your activities on a computer. Maybe you don't realize that Windows and other software programs store information about what you have done, what documents you have used, what web sites you have visited, what images and movies you have seen, and various other activities you have performed. The Windows built-in functions will not protect you, most of the tracks can not be erased with them. Therefore, anyone else can see what you have been doing on your computer, which raises several privacy concerns. Furthermore, much of your activity information takes up valuable disk space, and recovering this space can be very beneficial.
