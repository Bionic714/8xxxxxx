It took me 12 nights to synchronize Bitcoin with the network :(

Here it is ... 6.47 GB ;(

You can copy your wallet.dat(if you have one) to /data/ folder, if you are a new to Bitcoin just run bitcoin.bat - the programm will create everyting it needs to work itself.

bitcoin.bat - Starts Bitcoin in portable mode.
