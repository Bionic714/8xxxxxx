Welcome to the first release of
Demobase C64 (06 Dec 2009)

In an attempt to archive C64 demos,
this Demobase C64 will be a constant
work in progress.


Relive the past !


This project is the work of
Sjakie43 and .mad.

We hope you all enjoy this Demobase!

Based on the demo collection from 
http://c64.ch/ .
We had to start somewhere. ;)

All Blank D64 volume names have
been renamed to make them gamebase
friendly.

Demobase Problems??
-------------------
CPU JAMs
nothing we can do about it.
Try another /latest emulator.

Some Demos have to be loaded manually
out of the Gamebase front end.

T64 which contain filenames that
start with a SPACE
press RUN/STOP then type
Load ""

PRG Files that contain
[up arrow]
[pi]
[commodore key GFX]

will not load the correct "file name"

Programs that start at $0400-$0700
filling the screen with text
will not Auto RUN

fixed by typing "RUN:"

Everything should be fixed when the
NEW version of Gamebase v1.3
by Jimbo gets a released. ;)

If you have any demos you would like
to see adding to the Demobase.

please contact 
Sjakie43 at the GB64.com forum.
