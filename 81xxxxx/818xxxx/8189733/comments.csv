,nul98,2013-02-25T16:37Z,THE FINAL BOSS IS STILL INVINCIBLE!!!FIX THIS BUG.
,63Jax,2013-02-25T16:42Z,"info, info, we need info! does it work or not?"
,r4ymaN^,2013-02-25T17:39Z,Report back when you run into a small snag destroying The Alpha Ceph. 
,MLO89,2013-02-25T17:48Z,Both Black Box and Nosteam come out with their own versions using same crack which results in not being able to finish the game because of the invincible boss bug. Don't know why they even bothered making them. I guess they figured no one could care less about actually finishing the game.

,kerror,2013-03-09T05:34Z,app crash at second level.  mem usage lower than crysis 2.  althogh crysis 2 maxed with OMG textures etc...crysis 3 doesnt look as good.  no peek/cover mode.  and runs like do do.  but i tweak alot to get things to run smooth.  how u get to the final boss?  app crash here...maybe my specs aint high enough...
,zeomal,2013-03-10T08:59Z,"To fix last boss issue, download the crackfix2 from
https://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8191196/
and for any textures problem download latest nVidia 314.07 drivers.

,Sinister181,2013-03-13T05:06Z,"Dear Blackbox, the next time you rip a game, please try to include all of the textures with it as the game looks shithouse without certain textures. All of your other rips have been flawless. This one, not so much."
,ricking06,2013-03-16T13:45Z,"Hey Guys plz help in DVD 1 there's lprob..whenever i am trying 2 install it shows an error named isdone.dll: saying ""unarc.dll returened an error code -6 .....archive corrupt.... ""

,RafVne2,2013-03-17T02:45Z,"@ sinister
That bad?
I guess I'll go with nosTeam on this one, or I'll just go with original reloaded release. (I'd probably would actually buy this game, cauz' I know devs deserve it, unfortunately I can't afford it... hence... well, I'm here)

Just before we'll criticize Black Box release, you're positive it not just your settings?

I'm asking because Black Box teams repacks usually work flawlessly.  "
