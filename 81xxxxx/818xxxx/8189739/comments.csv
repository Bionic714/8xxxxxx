I can not be the only one to see artists that rely on dancers and other things that do not have the musicality to do, and is just tiresome. 

Now we have Ralf Gyllenhammar who is also the frontman of the metal band ""Mustache"" then he sings demonstrably highest in Sweden proves well each cabinet shall be.

Thank you Ralf :)"
