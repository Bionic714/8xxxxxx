I try to sleep
In a bed on fire
A change must come
No matter how
ThereΓÇÖs no return
Ashes to ashes
Dust to dust
But everything will burn

Once again, the night has fallen
Hard thoughts, keep on crawling
Lying awake, desperate yawning
Soon itΓÇÖs here that bloody morning
I donΓÇÖt like to be frustrated
I donΓÇÖt want to be sedated
WhoΓÇÖs gonnaΓÇÖ be my saviour?
Wonder if IΓÇÖll ever make it

I try to sleep
In a bed on fire
A change must come
No matter how
ThereΓÇÖs no return
Ashes to ashes
Dust to dust
But everything will burn

I could use some hibernation
Be an interstellar spaceman
One more night , and IΓÇÖll go crazy
Rest would be a new sensation
Early riser, duties calling
What a life, itΓÇÖs so boring
I wannaΓÇÖ snooze, oh no!
Here it comes that bloody morning
