Designing an attractive, resolution-independent user interface is hard, especially if you have to program your drawing codeΓÇª

PaintCode is a simple vector drawing app that instantly generates resolution-independent Objective-C and C#/MonoTouch drawing code.

You no longer have to tweak and recompile your drawing code over and over again to achieve the desired result. With PaintCode, a graphic designer with no programming experience can draw beautiful controls, icons and other user interface elements, and the app automatically generates code that is equally beautiful.
