Dear Perceptiontwist

 My torrents are goods, only this I was with some troubles... Look to my skull three times before to rate my job :B"
,Perceptiontwist,2013-02-28T11:24Z,"I meant that theater/TV uploads are slow everywhere. I guess I expressed myself poorly.

As of right now, 4 days after broadcasting, you're pretty much the sole trusthworthy uploader with this torrent on the net. Thanks for the fixed link :)"
