2013 - THE YEAR IN CHRISTIAN MUSIC
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

After having shared a few discographies this past week, it sure is nice to get back to another 2013 bundle.  Unlike the discographies, these bundles tend to be well supported with continual seeding well after I've moved onto another torrent.  So to those of you who stick around and share with others, what you've downloaded for yourself, I thank you.

Our year to date count for 2013 has just modestly climbed from 153 to 171 releases, including today's torrent.

This 6th bundle includes the following 18 titles...

 * Cadency, The - 2013 - Morning EP
 * Courtney Fadlin - 2013 - The Next Chapter
 * Daniel Bashta - 2013 - The Invisible - Instrumentals
