i cant install it!"
,carline,2013-03-20T05:28Z,Can someone please give detailed instructions on how to install this? All I have is a large bunch of .rar files.
,gmartcab,2013-03-20T12:36Z,"The download was quick and fine. To make it work we just have to unpack the last .rar file [the numberless one]. I had to use a PC to do this, for some reason it wouldn't work on Mac, but then we just have to mount the disk image on our Mac and copy to Applications. 

My problem comes now: Serial number. The Internet is full of sites offering a keygen but you have to fill in a survey and give your phone number... that ain't cool.

Any serials please?"
,gmartcab,2013-03-21T00:11Z,"Update:

No need for serial. When the window pops up asking for the serial, there's a ""Play"" button on the bottom right corner.

Works right away."
