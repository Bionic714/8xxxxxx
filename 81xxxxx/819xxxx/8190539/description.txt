NOTE: I suggest downloading VLC Media Player to watch this release.  You can download it here:
     
http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html

A few important and simple keyboard shortcuts for VLC are:

Double click: Fullscreen
Spacebar: Play/Pause
V key: Enable/Disable/Change Subtitles.
G/H key: Subtitle Delay (-50ms/+50ms per tap)
J/K key: Audio Delay (-50ms/+50ms per tap

NOTE: English Subtitles (SDH) are on by default.  If you do not want them on, simply tap the V key in VLC or delete the Subtitles folder.  Episode 2 has .srt Subtitles due to an error made by DEMAND.  They included the wrong .sub/.idx for Episode 2, so I downloaded Subtitles for the WEB-DL release of E02 and did my best to sync them up.

NOTE: These 45 minute episodes take four (4) hours each (@100% CPU) to encode using my out-dated Dual-Core Laptop (2.4GHz) w/ 4GB RAM.  It is the least you can do to say thanks for my hours of work and wear and tear on my laptop.  It would be much appreciated. :)

NOTE: Two 30 second samples are included for your viewing pleasure.

NOTE: I do not have constant Internet access, so this upload may take a few days.  Please be patient!
