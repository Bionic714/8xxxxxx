RELEASE INFO

Long-forgotten memories bubble to the surface when
the past invades the present in Lake House: Children
of Silence Located at the edge of a gloomy lake and
shrouded in fog, the house at the center of this
story has stood empty for 15 years. All that's
left of the family that once lived there are their
discarded belongings and home movies that reveal a
terrible secret. Beckoned by what appears to be a
ghost, a woman who lived there as a child and her
fiance return to the house to solve a mystery that
begins with an old photograph and ends in a secret
room. Guide the fiance as he explores locations
blanketed in mist and tries to rescue his bride-to-be
from the grip of a masked stranger. Find hidden
objects, solve puzzles and piece together a solution
that will take you to a place darker than you can
imagine. Only the clever will solve all of the
riddles and only the strong in spirit will endure
to the end
