,skulldragon,2013-04-10T03:54Z,"Dear .SceNe.,
could you kindly find yourself a shotgun, put the bullet exit hole inside your mouth and then pull the trigger?

Dear TPB,
could you kindly shove that Anonymous Download up your fucking ass?


Yep, it's another fake. The first thing that greets you, when you start the program is Product Activation Failed.
I assume I can stay on Office 2007 for many many upcoming years. Unless somebody makes LibreOffice work just as beautifully as Microsoft Office."

,kedde1009,2013-05-05T13:41Z,"I have downloaded this file to my Windows 8 pc and I got it installed. This is the steps I did:
1. Open the file with any ISO driver you have (I already had one)
2. Run it to a new cd drive or Mount it as virtual. Most new ones are called Diskdrive E or CD Drive E.
3. I then opened the file IU.MSP. After that it had finished I ran the setup.exe file. All this is done from your ISO program. (I have Cyberlink ISO Viewer)
4. After it have done installing restart your pc as it says.
5. Then open the same file in your ISO program again and install any program of the Office you need by running the MUI.msi file for them.
6. Nothing appeared on my desktop or anywhere were I cold find it so go to your search tool and type in the name of the program you installed. Example Word and it should be there ready to run and work.
Hope this helped it took me a while to figure out."

Please upload a 64 bit version"
,ses123,2013-06-02T12:11Z,"Awesome torrent, the easiest way to make this work is download jzip - www.jzip.com, and install. Then open this file then right hand click on inside archive and select extract with jzip. Then go to extracted folder and double click setup file and your done, easy as. No mucking about with having to burn discs etc. keep these torrents coming."
