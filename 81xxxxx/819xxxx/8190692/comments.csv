!!!!!

You ban by MAC-ADDR?!?!?

Where exactly do you enforce this ban?!?

From what you got me thinking, please correct me if I am wrong:

1 - If you do it on your torrent client (what do you use to do this? I don't have this option on the client I use: qBitTorrent), it will be pretty useless as it will only mean the peer won't download from you...

2 - I don't see where else you could do it and/or in a way it would affect more than the peer connecting to your own machine...

It depends on if you are doing a 'clean install', or an 'upgrade' ...
To Upgrade:
You must be logged into Windows to perform an Upgrade (NOTE: Even though files are not touched, it is still a good idea to back them all up, just in case) - Just insert the USB drive with the Windows install, and run the setup - When prompted, BE SURE to choose 'Upgrade', then continue install as normal.
Clean Install:
Once you have it on the USB, plug it in, and reboot - Once your BIOS screen loads, hit F8 (May differ on other PCs) to enter the Boot Device Selection screen - Select to boot from the USB, and continue - When prompted, select 'Clean Install', NOT 'Upgrade'!"

The way I do it is I have a set folder on my Desktop for my torrents, and when I reformat I copy this to a different drive, so I can copy it back after - I also copy my %USER%AppDataRoaminguTorrent folder, so I'll have all my settings saved - If you do that, once you re-format, and re-installed uTorrent, copy the AppData copy to the AppData folder, and overwrite any files - When you start uTorrent, you should just have to 'Start', and will continue seeding (As long as you keep the files in the torrent download folder!)"

Ok, it's at router level...but then, my assumption still holds:

""it will be pretty useless as it will only mean the peer won't download from you...""


Of course the meaning of ""useless"" is arguable: if you ban hit-and-runners from downloading from you, that means you will slow them down a little bit (""only 1 seed stage"") in the next torrent(s) they try to download from you...being you a seeder or a peer!

Ehehehe: but in these kind of things, I understand it will make you feel much better :)

2.-Then I copy and wrote the Iso file into a DVD, and still it didnt work :(.

An ISO file needs to either be burned to a DVD/USB, or mounted in a virtual drive, such as with MagicISO - You cannot just 'run' an ISO file - Unpacking the ISO with WinRAR/WinZIP will extract the files, but will NOT allow it to be bootable - You need to use Nero to 'Burn Image to Disc' for DVD, or Google 'Windows USB DVD Download Tool' to be able to burn the ISO to a USB drive."

I have already mounted the ISO using WinIso on a HDD usb.
I burned the iso into 2 dvds using the windows default program and after with ImgBurn.

Are you just restarting, and letting you system start up normally? You need to tell your system to boot from the CD first, rather than your normal HD or wherever your current OS is.

To do this you can either enter BIOS and change the boot order. Or, while your system is starting up (in POST) you can select the boot menu. It should tell you what key to press - it will be something like F12 or ESC, depending on your system. Then just select the drive, or CD, or USB that you're loading the .iso from."
,nightology_88,2013-03-05T18:20Z,"Hello Guys:

The problem seemed to simply be the program I was using to burn the image. I tried again with ImgBurn and it did worked wonrderfully.

It was also funny to see that my usb ports were not working on DOS (not bios, DOS) and when I finally made it work, i couldnt press ""any key"" with my wireless keyboard, so I had to get a ps/2 keyboard after being uncapable of enabling usb ports on DOS. Anyway so far works wonderful!!!!

Ps: I simply copied the torrent file back into the share folder, clicked on this torrent again to download it and it simply recognized the 100% after a chek, so it is possible to re seed after reboot.

no problem, val777 is a noob."
,aznfishie,2013-03-23T13:48Z,"Just want to thank you for the torrent, I've been using it for a week now after installing it onto a newly built computer and it's been working perfectly. Essentially, you helped me save like $250. Thanksss!"
[V],HighCode,2013-03-28T13:35Z,"Thanks a lot. I need it because for some weird reason my genuine Windows premium gives me headache.
I'll seed from seed-box up to 20x ratio ;-)"
,vileri94,2013-03-29T19:12Z,"Hi, used this torrent and is having some problems. Alot of windows services are not working and it wont let me install microsoft security essentials or download updates with windows updater. 
Its not that it does not pass validation, it wont even try to install. Somebody else with this problem or is this on my end?"
,vileri94,2013-03-29T22:34Z,"False alarm! A reinstall solved my problem, great torrent!"
[T],relentlesstech,2013-03-30T12:36Z,"@vileri94:
You had me worried there for a second LOL :-P"
,Edoh,2013-04-01T20:23Z,"Another question,

Can I install updates or will this ruin something?

Thanks in advance!"
[T],relentlesstech,2013-04-01T22:09Z,"@Edoh:
It updates without a problem :-)"
,smoker05,2013-04-11T12:36Z,"how much time period I can update Windows? And one more thing, after installing windows do I have to run any other program to make it activate? Please help I am kind of new."
[T],relentlesstech,2013-04-11T13:51Z,"@smoker05:
You will never be blocked from updating - As far as M$ is concerned, the OS is legit - Once you have installed Windows, you need to right-click the Loader, and 'Run as Admin' - Once it opens, click the 'Profile' tab in the Loader, and change the SLIC, Certificate, and Serial areas to whatever you want (As long as all 3 are the same!), then click the 'Installation' tab, and click 'Install' - Once finished, restart your computer, and you will be legit! :-)"
,smoker05,2013-04-11T17:42Z,"Thanks a lot for your reply brother. Just one more question, for How long I can update. I mean is there any limited time for the expiry of the key or just unlimited. Sorry for my Noobish questions. :( "
[T],relentlesstech,2013-04-11T22:59Z,You can update forever - The 'fix' never expires ;-)
,smoker05,2013-04-12T09:30Z,"Woah! Thanks a lot. Just Installed this, I Haven't faced any problem yet. Thanks a lot Mate. "
,depore,2013-04-16T14:36Z,"hey relentlesstech, i just finished downloading this but i dont know which file should i burn to my dvd.. coz i cant find any .ISO file.. "
[T],relentlesstech,2013-04-16T16:34Z,"@depore:
You can't find the ISO ??? The only files IN the torrent are the ISO, and Loader!

The image to burn is:
Win7Ult-SP1-x64-en-US-Feb2013.iso"
,nickreserved,2013-04-17T23:33Z,Know someone if it has IE10 or IE9?
[T],relentlesstech,2013-04-19T01:08Z,"@nickreserved:
I'm not sure, actually - I never checked - I know I have it NOW, don't know if it was an update at some point, or installed with the OS - Did anyone else who installed this notice?"
,Meowfy,2013-04-19T04:18Z,"Hi, I'm currently burning the ISO and I'm feeling pretty confident after reading the comments so far (just had 2 unsuccessful installations with other torrents). I'm wondering, is it okay to use the Windows Disc Image Burner, or should I be using some fancy program like MagicISO or something of the sort? Will be seeding!"
,Meowfy,2013-04-19T04:40Z,"I had the same error again.. I'm beginning to wonder if it's my disk drive, which I really hope it isn't. It's either that, or the fact that I'm using Windows Disc Image Burner rather than some other ISO program. It says:

""Windows cannot install required files. The file may be corrupt or missing. Make sure all files required for installation are available, and restart the installation. Error code: 0x80070017""

This is the same error I've had twice now. The thing is, the ""Expanding Windows Files"" percentage never went up, but the first time it did (it went up to 70% before it failed). What's the issue here, could somebody help?"
,Meowfy,2013-04-19T08:35Z,"Alright. I apologize for the chain of comments, BUT...

I finally got it after some trial/error from tinkering around with WUDT for a little bit. I appreciate this very much, everything went okay when I installed via USB :) Will definitely remember your name when searching for torrents in the future, and will definitely seed :D"
[T],relentlesstech,2013-04-20T13:43Z,"@Meowfy:
I was going to tell you that if burning to DVD, use Nero (Or other 'recognized' burning software), and you HAVE to make sure you burn at no more than 4x speed - Any higher than 4x, and the probability of errors increases ... I'm glad to hear you got it working!"
,daedalusi,2013-05-15T06:47Z,"hi relentless! was able to get the x86 up and running but did not realize that was the 32 bit :( dl the x64 now. can i ask what would be the best installation process on the same hd would be??
Thanks again!"
