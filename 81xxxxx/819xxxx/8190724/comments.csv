Wtf.
This one was the best in the series."
,MLO89,2013-02-25T19:10Z,"Well I'll be a muthafucka, gonna try this puppy out pronto."
,MLO89,2013-02-25T19:36Z,"Just loaded up to the Boss and beat the sombitch this time! Very good ReLOADed, glad you stuck with it and got it fixed. You guys fucking rock, I don't care what Skidrow says about you, heh heh. Rock on dudes with your bad ass selves."
,nirzhar,2013-02-25T19:36Z,can anyone confirm?

,fluffyhhm,2013-02-25T20:32Z,This crack doesnt fix the no ammo in the bolt sniper in mission 2
,carmitaccd,2013-02-25T20:33Z,works 100% i got this ealier today on a private tracker. you can now beat the final boss
,Dunge,2013-02-25T22:23Z,Since when Reloaded dare to criticize a game in their NFO? Especially a top-of-the-art game like this.
,Kirmz69,2013-02-25T23:30Z,TROJAN ALERT! Avast anti-virus reports CryEA.dll as a Trojan both on download and on execution of Crysis.exe
,Mahoraba3,2013-02-25T23:38Z,We shall see if this fixes the boss for me.
,WonderPirate24,2013-02-25T23:45Z,"Can anybody confirm if there's such a thing as a no ammo isue in Crysis 3 Mission 2 with the new
Crysis.3.Crackfix.2.INTERNAL-RELOADED?

Does anybody knows a way to skip to the last
mission without having to play all the previous
one. Thanks!"
,huynhc,2013-02-26T02:05Z,"Can someone please help me im stuck at Mission two where i have to use the ceph bolt sniper to take out the tower machine gun but everytime i pick up the bolt sniper its empty and i seen youtube video where the sniper is full with bullets so im thinking its a bug or i have a bad crack
-thanks"
,fleckn,2013-02-26T02:20Z,"If you're having problems with the ceph sniper ammo: search TPB for ""crysis 3 trainer"" and download that. Turn on infinite ammo and no reload via the trainer, and the sniper will work. Then just turn off/delete the trainer and continue."
,slystar,2013-02-26T04:47Z,guys for the mission 2 sniper bolt ammo fix use this http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8192352/Crysis_3_Mission_2_Bolt_Sniper_Ammo_Fix
,Vallencre,2013-02-26T04:54Z,"I can confirm the ammo bug on level 2 is fixed. At least, I had no issues with it. I see some people say they have but perhaps they did something wrong."
,Lshizzle,2013-02-26T05:14Z,"Ammo bug for the bolt sniper is still there. I know i did everything right, there's only 3 files to replace..... No antivirus so i know that's not an issue. Tried going to all the weapon sites before getting to the bolt sniper, tried running straight to the bolt sniper, no matter what there's no ammo."
,CapPanda,2013-02-26T05:22Z,Thanks for the upload.  Seeding seems to be rather slow though.
,Shadow416,2013-02-26T05:55Z,"for the people having the sniper bolt ammo issue, it could be that you need to restart that chapter, that's what my friend did and hes okay now, I've only played like 5 minutes of it and turned it off because I need to OC my video card if i wanna play it on Very high settings lmao :( 

Sapphire Radeon 6970 (it's only slightly laggish on high settings with MSAA 4x)"
,MLO89,2013-02-26T06:55Z,You guys make sure you remember to delete the old dll from the previous crack so as not to cause any conflicts with new dll.
,korsair_13,2013-02-26T08:41Z,"For you people having an issue with the bolt sniper in mission 2, start the game at the end of mission one and go through the game from there. It fixes itself and you don't need to cheat. It is only an issue if you have a save game with the old crack."
,Chenko77,2013-02-26T11:17Z,"Thank you, this fixed the crash problem i had."
,CapPanda,2013-02-26T20:25Z,@MLO89 - Skidrow's version still only has the first 3-4 levels bug free.  Reloaded always has more peers and faster bug fixes.  Forget skidrow.
,riahc3,2013-02-26T23:29Z,"I haven't installed Crysis 3 yet because of the mission bugs but seeing as this is all fixed, Im installing now."
,Machine4578,2013-02-28T01:10Z,"@CapPanda

LOL!!! Skidrow's version????? are you kidding me!! SKIDROW had NOTHING to do with this game AT ALL!! NOOB!!"
,riahc3,2013-02-28T11:50Z,"OK here is the deal:

I installed a completely clean install of Crysis 3 without no previous save file.

The bolt ammo issue did NOT occur so this crack is safe against that.

Now, this is to fix the final boss anticrack glitch so I suppose that is fixed too....I havent gotten there yet so I cannot try it out.

Other than those 2, there arent any more anticrack glitches AFAIK."
,MLO89,2013-02-28T18:58Z,"@CapPanda, you need to re-read my comment you idiot. My joking references to Skidrow were related to them and Reloaded always chiding each other in the nfos."
,unscarred786,2013-02-28T22:27Z,"Can you guys help me. When i start a new game it goes through the first cut scene then crashes to the desktop and gives me this message.

There is a known issue with your video card. update Crysis to version 1.1 using this: http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8204707/Crysis.3.Update.v1.1.INTERNAL-RELOADED"
,pennknig,2013-03-02T02:12Z,"This ""FIX""?,,,breaks the crossbow's cross hair on the 2nd go through.
This makes the crossbow unusable.
This does fix the final boss issue, but another arises."
,xanderzub,2013-03-03T02:05Z,"Gracias!, me sirvio para acabar con el cepth alpha"
,superceed,2013-03-03T04:51Z,"I applied this crack and tried the final boss alpha ceph again using my previous game save, it still wont open its weak points...

Should I replay that mission or go through the entire game again?!?! I deleted my game saves, and restored back to original unlocked ripped version. THe game now thinks its first time to run,, (cant skip the intro logos).

I still dont have the time to play it though for now, but its fine with me to play with it again the whole time. hehehe... 

Someone here said, the no ammo bug is fixed and the crash.. i hope it does fix the final boss..

if anybody here has reached the final boss with this crack, please let me know if the crack does fixes the final boss anti crack glitch.. :D thank you."
,frifrau,2013-03-04T00:33Z,"This fix final boss alpha ceph glitch. Thanks, finally I  finish it.

,Clemenator,2013-03-04T11:00Z,"pennknig: Are you sure you on your 2nd play thru you don't have it on one of the top 2 difficulty's.
As on either of these difficulty's you get no aim assist or crosshair for any weapon."

,egyking,2013-03-18T15:59Z,thank you game working fine now.
,Agreatname,2013-03-21T08:48Z,"I've checked 3 versions of this same torrent, and all of a sudden they're viruses. I had been playing Crysis 3 for the last several days, and all of a sudden today it says I'm missing a file when I try to launch.(cryea.dll, to be exact) 

On top of that, my antivirus is now showing that file as a virus, though it wasn't a few days ago. I've redownloaded the torrent a few times, each time it comes up a virus, and moving the cryea.dll results in weird behaviour like it telling me i don't have admin permission (I do) or just DISAPPEARING when I try to copy it.

http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8200414/Crysis.3.Crackfix.2.INTERNAL-RELOADED has been confirmed as a virus, and the trackers for all the other torrents seem to be the same.

The fact that there's a dozen or so of the same crack-fix torrent is also making this little investigation a pain in the ass.

Anyone else have issues all of sudden?

"
,WhereIam,2013-03-21T23:58Z,"Yes I had the same problem, is it Microsoft Security Essentials that deletes CryEA.dll as soon as you open any folder containing it.

Looks like an interesting way to get back at us.

I had to turn off MSE and redownload this crack to keep playing. and i saved the CryEA.dll in other folders."
,newpirategr,2013-03-25T17:02Z,"I applied this fix but still crashes when I play mission 2 and tries to auto-save the game at the first checkpoint!

,xarinl,2013-05-09T15:50Z,Can this crack be used directly over the main download found at 'http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8174928/Crysis.3.INTERNAL-RELOADED'
,_Strelok_,2013-05-22T04:37Z,"VirTool:Win32/Obfuscator are detections for programs that have had their purpose obfuscated, often to hinder analysis or detection by antivirus scanners. They commonly employ a combination of methods including encryption, compression, anti-debugging and anti-emulation techniques.

These obfuscation techniques are used on various kinds of malware. The malware that lies ""underneath"" may have virtually any purpose. Hence, there are no obvious symptoms that indicate the presence of this malware on a computer.

There is no virus. If you don't think that EA reports these cracks to NOD32 then you should do more in depth research. Your fine and continue on"
