                Crysis 3 Crackfix #2 *INTERNAL* (c) EA Games

      02/2013 :..... RELEASE.DATE .. PROTECTION .......: Securom/EADRM
            - :.......... DISC(S) .. GAME.TYPE ........: FPS


What can we say. This is why loaders suck. This fix takes care of a trigger
which makes it impossible to kill the end boss, for those who didn't become
bored with the game after 15 minutes.


1. Unrar.
2. Copy over the cracked content to your game Bin32 directory.
3. Use a firewall to block all game exes from going online.
4. Play the game.
5. Support the software developers. If you honestly think this game is worth
   the money, BUY IT!
