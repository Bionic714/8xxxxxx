,gmupats,2013-03-08T20:06Z,"Any way to enable cheats with this? Cannot find swkotor2.ini in Library -> Preferences. 

[sorry if this is a double post]"
,gmupats,2013-03-08T20:42Z,"K never mind, I figured it out. To enable cheats:

Applications -> Knights of the Old Republic 2 -> Show Package Contents

Contents -> Resources -> transgaming -> c_drive -> Program Files -> SWKotOR2 -> swKotor2.ini

At the end of [Game Options] -> 
EnableCheats=1
Enable Console=1

Save.

~ key will enable invisible console. You should not be able to move while console is enabled. "
,HSPLazerz,2013-03-12T16:42Z,"People, games with DX11 can't be ported to the Mac, like BF3 or Black Ops 2 etc.

Some games like Max Payne 3 doesn't work because, for some, it doesn't even launch, for some, it's stuck in the loading screen (endless loading) etc.

Anyways, back to the game.

It works, but the resolution is only 4:3, but widescreen patches don't work, and the only resolutions for me that are available are 800x600 and 1024x640, sucks."

,xochild,2013-04-21T06:55Z,"Thanks for the upload, I really appreciate you taking the time to let me play a game for free.

I have a question though, contrary to what gmupats posted - which I believe only works on a windows computer - I'm having a hard time finding the .ini file that lets you add the ""EnableCheats=1"" line which allows one to access the console in-game.

Could someone please be a little more specific on how to enable the console in the game for this torrent?"
,pebh,2013-05-11T20:01Z,"Thanks man .. I have a problem though, the game freezes on my new 27"" iMac after every fight sequence? I'm scouring the internet for help, but nothing seems to do the trick ..
