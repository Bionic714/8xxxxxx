The installer itself doesn't contain any protection i.e. passwords etc. Is it possible that UAC is asking you for the ADMIN password?
If so, go to:

Start and type UAC

Click on ""Change User Account Control settings""

On the left of the screen that appears, drag the slider down to ""Never notify"" and click on ""OK"".

Re-boot your PC and run the tool as Administrator again. If the tool still fails to launch (Requiring ADMIN/Elevated permissions). 
Run CMD Prompt from your accessories directory as Administrator type the following EXACTLY. Re-boot, log into the newly created Administrator account and run the tool from there:

net user administrator /active:yes

Once command has been successful type:

exit

Re-boot and log into the new account.
