,digitalepisode,2013-02-26T19:10Z,Is this real/fake and how's the quality?  Spammers seem to be taking up comments to promote pay scam sites.  Dickheads!  Fuckoff!
,LameAzzGamer,2013-02-27T00:58Z,"This is legit cam.  3 files in .vob format.
A/V/=6/5
Picture is dark throughout most of movie, and at times can be difficult to see what is happening.  Sound has tinny/echo as is typical of cam files. Hardcoded subs. Movie is watchable, but I would suggest waiting for higher quality.

Thanks for the upload NLUPPER002!!"
,downloser,2013-02-27T20:55Z,"The last 10 minutes are way out of focus most of the time.  It did not ruin the movie for me, but it did give me a headache.  Thank you for the upload."
,at7000,2013-03-01T17:51Z,"  You idiots think putting a crap quality cam file on a DVD makes it better? What is it, psychological?? ""Well it's a DVD now, so it is no longer low quality garbage.""   Hilarious.

It's still crap and you're still wasting your time.  A Cam file at 2+ Gig and in DVD format is a sad joke.   

Who are you losers? Juvenile, impatient dweebs who cannot wait to see a proper rip?"

,Tgod420,2013-03-15T18:02Z,Thanks gna check it out
,sathanas6,2013-03-18T03:06Z,"Thanks for the up, but the audio is terrible, and the file size is crap due to being vob. Acesn8s uploaded a great TS with near perfect audio and decent video too, only 1.12GB.
