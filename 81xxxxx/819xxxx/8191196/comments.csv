,Mercer99,2013-02-25T23:21Z,"Update, I downloaded the second crackfix from Ghostnet and it worked just fine. MeMar, could you check and make sure that your files are not corrupted in any way? It looks like the crack is unable to find the DLL."
,PseudoPositive,2013-02-26T00:50Z,"I haven't got to the final boss scene yet, so I can't verify that the fix works, but I can state that this crack did work as far as saving, & loading is concerned without screwing up your current saves, so,.....so far, so good. Thanks MeMar, cheers."

,goingmad1,2013-02-26T18:20Z,"Well ""done.exe"". Now tell me why do this so called fix is trying to run a fucking trojan? It creates this file in temp directory and then tries to execute it. Correct me if i'm wrong but this is not how it should work."
,Gamer4492,2013-03-02T06:32Z,yeah there is a trojan in this crack because when i tried to use this crack i got a virus and i almost got a rootkit virus but malewarebytes caught it but the trjan made my computer bluescreen and i had to boot from the disc to fix it because i couldnt get to the logon screen because it keep bluecreening. dont download
