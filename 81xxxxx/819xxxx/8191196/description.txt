RELOADED just released another crackfix for their internal release of the game ΓÇ£Crysis 3ΓÇ│. It seems that with their previous crackfix, the last boss was invincible. Now, you donΓÇÖt have no excuse for not killing this bad guy. Have fun.

[Group notes]: What can we say. This is why loaders suck. This fix takes care of a trigger which makes it impossible to kill the end boss, for those who didnΓÇÖt become bored with the game after 15 minutes.
