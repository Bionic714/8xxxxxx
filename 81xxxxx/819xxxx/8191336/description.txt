For Updated Exams From December 2008

Complete First Certificate is a new course for the 2008 revised FCE exam. Informed by the Cambridge Learner Corpus and providing a complete FCE exam paper specially prepared for publication by Cambridge ESOL, it is the most authentic exam preparation course available. Complete First Certificate combines the very best in contemporary classroom practice with first-hand knowledge of the challenges students face. There are exercises to help students avoid repeating the typical mistakes that real FCE candidates make, as revealed by the Cambridge Learner Corpus. This topic-based course covers every part of the FCE exam in detail, ensuring that students are fully equipped to tackle each part of every paper. In addition, the accompanying free CD-ROM enables students to focus on their own particular areas of difficulty and work at their own pace. There is a Student's Book with answers and CD-ROM edition so students can study on their own or in class. The Teacher's Book offers plenty of time-saving consolidation and extension material, including photocopiable resources such as tests and activities.
