======&gt; Descrizione &lt;======

English Pronunciation In Use is a book to help students of English to work on pronunciation, for both speaking and understanding. It is written mainly for students of intermediate level.

How is English Pronunciation In Use organised?

There are 60 units in the book. Each unit look at a different point of pronunciation. Each unit has two pages. The page on the left has explanations and examples, and the page on the right has exercises. The 60 units are divided into three sections of 20 units each. Section A is about how to say and spell individual sounds, Section B is about joining sounds to make words and sentences. Section C is about pronunciation in conversation.

After the 60 units, there is a fourth section, Section D, which contains the following:
Introduction to phonemic symbols
Pronunciation test
Guide for speakers of specific languages
Sound pairs
Sentence stress phrasebook
Glossary
At the end of the book there is a Key with answers.

With the book, there is also a set of four CDs, one for each section of the book.

To the teacher

Although English Pronunciation In Use has been written so that it can be used for self-study, it will work equally well in a class situation. In a classroom context, the learners can get intermediate guidance and feedback from the teacher. Also, they can practise some of the dialogues and other exercises in pairs. You can direct students with particular pronunciation difficulties to do specific units on their own.
