,Foghog,2013-03-01T21:00Z,"It worked for the first quest level, then it stopped freezes/ doesn't allow me to build or even create imps after the video finishes in the second campaign chapter. tried both on a 64 bit win 7 and 32 bit win 7."
,Foghog,2013-03-04T06:57Z,"a workaround? I managed to get mine to work on almost all versions, by quickly saving the game before the guy stops talking or at the very very start of the chapter, and then it will confirm the save. then it will freeze, but when I restart, I load the game and it works fine for the whole chapter. just a thought if anyone is having the same problems as I"
