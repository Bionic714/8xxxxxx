 Plot Summary 
                                                                                     
                                                                                                   
    During their travels through the Unova region, Ash and his friends Iris and Cilan arrive       
     in Eindoak Town, built around a castle called the Sword of the Vale. The three Trainers       
      have come to compete in the town's annual battle competition, and Ash manages to win         
     with some unexpected help from the Mythical Pokmon Victini. It turns out Victini has a       
    special bond with this place. Long ago, the castle watched over the Kingdom of the Vale,       
     and the partnership between Victini and the king protected its people who lived there.        
       But that kingdom has since vanished into memory, leaving behind powerful relics and         
    ancient Pokmon. Damon, a descendant of the People of the Vale, is trying to restore the       
     lost kingdom with the help of his Reuniclus. His quest has taken him to the far reaches       
    of the barren desert, and he has convinced the Legendary Pokmon Reshiram to join him in       
      the search for truth. Damon plans to trap Victini and harness its power, and as that         
       plan gets under way, the entire town of Eindoak faces disaster. Can Ash awaken the          
                Legendary Pokmon Zekrom to help him stop Damon and save Victini?
