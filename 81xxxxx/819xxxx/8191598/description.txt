   Crack open a cold one, or kick-start the blender and fire up that          
   Pina Colada. It's time to celebrate! Forum is proud to announce the        
   newest installment in their vast library of team-inspired videos.          
   After winning back-to-back awards for Forever and Fuck It, a little        
   team Vacation was long overdue. This last season was all about taking      
   advantage of traveling on someone else's dime, and focusing more on        
   good times than hard work. Ironically, when the pressure went down,        
   the progression of snowboarding went up ... WAY UP.
