===================================================================================



While Markus Schulz's collaboration with Armin van Buuren,"The Expedition", continues to travel as the ASOT 600 anthem, the German producer has returned this week with another official theme. Created for Prague's Transmission festival, "The Spiritual Gateway" is both the event's anthem and its ethos, as trance fans from around the world gathered to get lost in the sounds of some of the genre's best acts. With a hard-hitting bassline, an echoing melody and celestial chord progressions, the track is pure trance, pure Markus, and pure anthem gold. For those who couldn't make it to eastern Europe, the track is now available on Beatport.
