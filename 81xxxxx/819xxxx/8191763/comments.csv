,box_77,2013-02-27T04:01Z,"ungratefull, youre right !!  my download limit per month is 60gb, so im happy when its a small size bdrip or dvdrip. also, my fastest download speed is like 1mb/sec. , so even a 700mb movie takes like 30-40 min. i dont wanna wait several hours to get the blue ray version! (for an xbox game, its ok, because theres no rip loll)"
,tarzanscousin,2013-02-27T05:42Z,"Not sure why the continued chopping of the file to fit onto CDs. I tried to combine them with virtualdub but it seems the 2 files have different audio encodings and won't combine (at least not the way I usually do it in vdub).

Please stop releasing stuff in 700MB chunks, thanks."
,Mike_Hunt_Spanker,2013-02-27T06:30Z,"totally shite movie... lasted 15mins and then I thought tell everyone, movie not been 3D, high def, blu ray, sound shite.. 
scene4all and all keep up the good work! "
,topeak,2013-02-27T07:57Z,"@Tarzanscousin

Screw VirtualDub. Google Fast AVI Joiner. It's a stupid simple program that can combine anything in seconds. 

Heck, just look for it here. That's where I downloaded it. "

,xxjaretxx,2013-02-27T10:29Z,"Thanks abunch Man! Ive been around for years on TPB this is the first comment i have ever left. I am going to post this comment or one similar on all of the popular shows and movies I get. The MAIN REASON FOR MY POST IS I WANT TO TELL/REMIND EVERYONE THAT THE ""COPYRIGHT ALERT SYSTEM"" was launched yesterday. Most of the major isp's are involved, AT&T, TIME WARNER, VERIZON, and CABLEVISION, along with many others. SO GET BEHIND A VPN if you don't want your ISP dropping you for copyright infringement. Supposedly u get around 5 warnings then they drop you.  Just a friendly heads up to all you Pirates! here is a link to a news article about it, pretty basic column. :: http://news.yahoo.com/pirates-beware-industry-isps-launch-copyright-alert-system-000744092.html PROXY VPN or ""Borrow"" Wi-fi from the neighbors for your downloadingl I had a VPN in the past but it made my downloads drop DRASTICALLY so I currently looking for the best VPN or other option where I can maintain a decent speed. I appreciate the work you put into uploading, and the sourcing that goes into it. You seriously rock man, Keep up the Great work!"
,topeak,2013-02-27T10:42Z,"Don't listen to that cocksucking liar PetaFlux, this is a fine copy with no issues. 

A - 9
V - 9

It's not a Bluray quality release, but it looks and sounds fine on a 60"" set. If you want to wait for BDRip instead, well that's fine, but frankly this copy is good enough for 99% of downloaders. "
,topeak,2013-02-27T10:46Z,"And fuck off, Jaret, you assfucking studio plant. 

Most quality VPN's don't do a goddamn thing to your download speeds. BTGuard, for one, works great and is less that 7 bucks a month. 

If any of you are seriously concerned, though, look into a Seedbox instead, which start at 20 bucks a month. 

There are other free options available, so just google and educate yourself. "
,woprr,2013-02-27T12:18Z,"To be clear, the BT clients encryption is better than vpn, because it's using point-to-point connections, but vpn's for this use case are concentrators which may provide easy mass- monitoring, by the FEDs e.g.

xxjaretxx, does not trust his own contracted ISP under laws and courts he can use against them,

but rather trusts some unknown VPN provider crooks under no law, maybe now setup in 10000s by FBI or content industry detectives?

Good luck. "

I have to say, v/a is at best a 7.  Highly compressed for the file size.

As harbor521 mentioned its very compressed for the file size. Nothing for the big screen. OK for a pad or smartphone though. Thanks for the up anyway."

better go with other release."
,Xenirina,2013-03-01T07:44Z,"Okay, for the dickheads that complain about it been in two parts:

SPARKS (the release group) release the movie in that way. 
Why? Scene rules say so. The file must be able to fit on an average DVD. So it's release two 700 MB files, or just 1 in bad quality. 

So stop complaining and get used to it.

,skareo,2013-04-11T05:16Z,"A/V - 8

Movie was a fucking waste of time. The book was a relatively short story compared to LotR. This should have been all in one movie with lots of action and shit. This fucking garbage was so tedious and boring. I'm not paying a dime for this movie. Fuck you, Hollywood. These kikes making these movies can suck my hairy nutsack if they want to see a penny out of me."
,skareo,2013-04-11T06:02Z,"From the words of Christopher Tolkien:

""Hollywood has turned Tolkien into a monster, devoured by his own popularity and absorbed into the absurdity of our time. The chasm between the beauty and seriousness of the work, and what it has become, has overwhelmed me. The commercialization has reduced the aesthetic and philosophical impact of the creation to nothing. There is only one solution for me: to turn my head away.""

That about sums it up. Fuck you, Peter Jackson."
,beau75,2013-04-11T22:25Z,"For the people who want to put the movie onto a DVD here is what I did (I use ConvertXToDVD).

1) Insert a blank disk and launch ConvertX.

2) Drag the ""sparks-hobbit2012-xvid-a"" file into the Tree View box.

3) Select Titleset #1 by right clicking on it.

4) Click Merge more files into this title set, select the Add option and then select the ""sparks-hobbit2012-xvid-b"" file.

5) Click Convert and once it is done enjoy the movie!

6) (optional) Under Settings find the Encoding tab and enable Two-pass encoding for better quality but it does take longer.

For me the movie looks and sounds perfect on my 47"" TV."
