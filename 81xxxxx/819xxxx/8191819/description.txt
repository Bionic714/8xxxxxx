From some guy's website:

Hostess ads ran in comic books starting in 1977 with Batman and the Mummy. This continued for five insane years. Five years of amazing super beings tossing food to madmen whose special ability may or may not have been really enjoying peaches.

Each hero has his or her own unique approach to fighting crime with snacks. Aquaman likes to fail or suck and then share in cupcakes. Captain America prefers to kick the fuck out of you, maybe hand you a pie, and then kick out whatever fuck you have left. But Thor and Wonder Woman ... those two use Hostess treats as a portal to an impossible underverse of dislogic and nonsense.
