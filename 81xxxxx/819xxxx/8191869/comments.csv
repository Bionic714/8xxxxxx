,racer123246,2013-05-11T23:06Z,"Gives me a weird error whenever I try to download a video or convert a video. This has occurred on two different computers. (checked for consistency) I don't know if it has something to do on my end, but I recommend maybe trying a different torrent?"

@racer123246: That's weird. I also use multiple PCs and test my work on each of them before uploading. I didn't get errors on any of them. What error are you seeing?"
,dutchuss,2013-05-23T21:42Z,i am a mac user and this program does not have a torrent for mac users could you please get one up with a registration code perhaps
,racer123246,2013-06-04T02:10Z,"@Swegin8r Sadly I don't remember the error because the one computer I was using crashed (unrelated) and with the other, I uninstalled it. I'm going to try on a new Win7 PC, I'll let you know if I have success."
,racer123246,2013-06-04T02:18Z,"And, success. Thanks for the upload!"
