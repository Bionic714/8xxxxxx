The new Canadian rock group Celestial Ruin is styled after European Symphonic Metal but executed with a decidedly North American flavour. Celestial RuinΓÇÖs sound combines heavy rock rhythms and riffs with catchy, singable melodies, and rich symphonic textures. The combination is ΓÇ£epicΓÇ¥ by all accounts. Lyrical themes are drawn from fantasy and horror, sometimes implying deeper meanings, sometimes just celebrating the subject matter. 

Celestial RuinΓÇÖs live performance is close to the recording but organically so. They shun the use of backing tracks and drum machines, performing every aspect of the music live. Their music is written as organically as it is performed, a completely collaborative effort on the part of all project members.
