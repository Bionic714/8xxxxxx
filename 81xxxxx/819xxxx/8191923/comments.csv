You are obviously a complete newbie, so I will tell you a little secret.  Look for a skull next to the uploaders name.  The skull means that they are a trusted uploader (pirate)."
,mike953100,2013-02-27T05:29Z,Hmmmm.....surprisingly low video bitrate.  These types of releases usually have a bitrate around 4000-5000Kbps.  Not complaining; in fact I am not even downloading this.
