,delro92,2013-02-26T05:51Z, It's 20 mins long because you added the Up a Tree episode at the end. Dunno why you'd do that. 
,Ghostmorph4,2013-02-26T07:16Z,Yeah. Why the hell did you put Up A Tree on the end?
,V1ceC1ty,2013-02-26T17:05Z,Why does it matter if he made a mistake? It's free Adventure Time. Thanks EZTV once again for making my day!
,BoonesFerry,2013-02-27T01:48Z,"Oh my, oh deear, FQM made a minor error. Better throw a temper tantrum and make childish comments. With an error or this magnitude there is no possible way we can just say thank you and be grateful. [/end sarcasm]"
,The-IT,2013-02-27T07:12Z,"Lol at the comments! XD
Nice quality as usual. "
,Redstar2613,2013-02-27T22:43Z,"BoonesFerry, chill out. 
People are allowed to ask questions and that was a perfectly good one. Certainly nothing to get so worked up over :)"
,LazySummers,2013-03-06T07:49Z,"I don't care if it's 2 episodes or 20 episodes, as long as one of them is the right one lol"
,Mjurjel2,2013-03-30T16:05Z,"LOL New leaked episode (title: A glitch is a glitch) is on some kind of polish blog. We dont have it even on TPB oO
