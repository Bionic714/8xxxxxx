It's not a Bluray quality release, but it looks and sounds fine on a 60"" set. If you want to wait for BDRip instead, well that's fine, but frankly this copy is good enough for 99% of downloaders. "

Excellent rip of an excellent movie. Mucho thanks extremezone"
,beau75,2013-04-11T22:19Z,"For the people who want to put the movie onto a DVD here is what I did (I use ConvertXToDVD).

1) Insert a blank disk and launch ConvertX.

2) Drag the ""sparks-hobbit2012-xvid-a"" file into the Tree View box.

3) Select Titleset #1 by right clicking on it.

4) Click Merge more files into this title set, select the Add option and then select the ""sparks-hobbit2012-xvid-b"" file.

5) Click Convert and once it is done enjoy the movie!

6) (optional) Under Settings find the Encoding tab and enable Two-pass encoding for better quality but it does take longer.

For me the movie looks and sounds perfect on my 47"" TV."
