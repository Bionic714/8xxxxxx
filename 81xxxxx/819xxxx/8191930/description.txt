Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site :: On the Monday, February 25 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex continues analyzing the unrelenting blows to the Second Amendment as he blows the lid on the wider agenda behind proposed gun bans. 

On today's program, Alex welcomes former Congressman Ron Paul [last 12 minutes of hour 1] to break down the use of force by federal agents to enforce unjust and unconstitutional laws and the victimization of Americans for simply engaging in commercial transactions. 

We'll also welcome Natural News editor Mike Adams "The Health Ranger" in studio to discuss Monsanto taking over 400 farmers to court for allegedly violating seed patents.
