 : Dale DeGroff is widely regarded as the world's foremost mixologist. Hailed :
 : by the New York Times as "single-handedly responsible for what's been      :
 : called the cocktail renaissance," he earned this reputation during his     :
 : twelve years at the fashionable Promenade Bar in New York City's Rainbow   :
 : Room. It was there in 1987 that he not only reintroduced the cocktail menu :
 : to the country but also began mixing drinks from scratch, using impeccably :
 : fresh ingredients instead of the widespread mixes used at the time. Known  :
 : especially for crafting unique cocktails, reviving classics, and coaxing   :
 : superior flavor from his ingredients, DeGroff has selected his 100         :
 : essential drinks and 100 of their best variations--including many of his   :
 : signature cocktails--for this premier mixology guide.                      :
 :                                                                            :
 : The Essential Cocktail features only those drinks that stand out for their :
 : flavor, interesting formula, or distinctive technique. These are the very  :
 : ones every amateur and professional bartender must know, the martinis,     :
 : sours, highballs, tropicals, punches, sweets, and classics, both old and   :
 : new, that form the core of a connoisseur's repertoire. Throughout the book :
 : are DeGroff's personal twists, such as a tangy Grapefruit Julep or a       :
 : refreshing Yuzu Gimlet.                                                    :
 :                                                                            :
 : To complement the tantalizing photographs of each essential cocktail,      :
 : DeGroff also regales readers with the fascinating lore behind a drink's    :
 : genesis and instructs us on using the right ingredients, techniques,       :
 : glasses, and garnishes. As Julia Child's Mastering the Art of French       :
 : Cooking was the classic compendium for home chefs and gourmands, so The    :
 : Essential Cocktail will be the go-to book for serious mixologists and      :
 : cocktail enthusiasts.                                                      :
