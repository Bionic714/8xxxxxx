 : The classic, worldwide bestseller from the author of East of the Mountains.:
 : With an introduction by Nicholas Evans In 1954 a fisherman is found dead in:
 : the nets of his boat, and a local Japanese-American man is charged with his:
 : murder. In the course of his trial, it becomes clear that what is at stake :

 : as cedar trees and the fields of ripe strawberries - memories of a charmed :
 : love affair between a white boy and a Japanese girl; memories of land      :
