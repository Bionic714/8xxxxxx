Africa straddles the equator which bestows a rich diversity
of wildlife and landscapes on the world's second largest
continent. Large predators roam the sweeping savannas among
huge herds of grazing herbivores, while apes, monkeys and
snakes inhabit its dark, dense forests.
An amazing new perspective on the landscapes
and creatures of Africa's wildest places.
This is the worldâ™s wildest continent as youâ™ve never seen
it before – an intense sensory adventure from the Atlas
Mountains, through the Savannah lands to the Cape of Good
Hope and from the Roof of Africa and the Kalahari to where
the dark rainforests of the Congo meet the Atlantic Ocean.
Each episode shifting the focus onto a different region as
it contrasts the epic power of the landscape with the
dramatic struggles of individual creatures living there.
From hidden jungles and ice-blue glaciers to erupting volcanoes
and lakes of poison, Africa explores an astonishing array of
previously un-filmed locations and discovers bizarre new
creatures and behaviours – including some of the rarest fish
in the world, exploding insects and lizards that hunt on the
backs of lions.
This landmark Six-part series utilises the latest filming
technology to reveal the surprising environments,
extraordinary creatures and other fascinating secrets of
an amazing continent.
