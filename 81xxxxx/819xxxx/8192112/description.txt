Hammer House of Horror is a British television series,
made in 1980. An anthology series created by Hammer Films
in association with Cinema Arts International and ITC
Entertainment, it consisted of thirteen 50-minute episodes,

Each self-contained episode featured a different kind of horror,

and voodoo, but also included non-supernatural horror themes such
as cannibalism, confinement and serial killers. In 2003, Channel
4 placed Hammer House of Horror at No.50 in its "100 Scariest
Moments" show. The clip shown was the children's party scene in
"The House That Bled to Death".
