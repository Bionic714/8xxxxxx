,carnaval93,2013-03-01T07:11Z,Sorry to ask...but are you goin to put the beginning of season 5 up??
[T],loadstone2k12,2013-03-02T01:33Z,@carnaval93 I don't have the past episodes and so few people are downloading that I think is not worth it to release more.
,Wiiner,2013-03-02T05:12Z,"Oh it is worth it buddy! I would kill for these, at least the 480p would be great. my daughters have been up my ass forever for this series! please thanks "
,carnaval93,2013-03-02T13:45Z,They are extremely hard to find..I stopped by ep.6 because I can't find it anywhere.
[T],loadstone2k12,2013-03-02T19:00Z,"No group is doing this show, so I have to buy the episodes to release, and as you can see by the number of seeders and leechers, few people are interested."
,ShiningArmor,2013-03-02T21:17Z,does that mean you will not be releasing winx club anymore? not even the new episodes? :(
