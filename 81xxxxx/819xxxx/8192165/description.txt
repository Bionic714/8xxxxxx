"The Fact in the Fiction"

When extremely educated new intern
Dr. Oliver Wells starts working at
the Jeffersonian, his quick-learning,
enthusiastic personality challenges
Brennan as he gets under her skin
with his eccentric but undeniable
observations, causing her to try to
be more open-minded about many
scientific questions. Meanwhile,
Booth worries she may have gone too
far when she accepts the possibility
of time travel as a factor in a
murder investigation.
