Using object-oriented terminology from the start, Object-Oriented Programming Using C++, Fourth Edition, will provide readers with a solid foundation in C++ programming. Like its predecessors, the fourth edition uses clear, straightforward examples to teach both the syntax of the C++ language and sound programming principles. It begins with an overview of object-oriented programming and C++, and then builds upon this knowledge to teach increasingly complex concepts, such as inheritance, templates, handling exceptions, and advanced input and output. Aimed at providing readers with the most current programming knowledge, this edition has been updated to reflect the latest software, Visual C++ 2008.
