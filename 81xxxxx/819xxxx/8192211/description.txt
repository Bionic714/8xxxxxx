Paper Boy 2[PC][Win7 x86 x64][Repack by GriZzlyB]



Description:

Paperboy 2 is a sequel to the video game Paperboy. It was released in 1991-1992. The game was much like the original: the player controls a paperboy (or papergirl) who must navigate a bizarre series of obstacles, such as tires rolling down a driveway while a car is being repaired, or strange houses like a haunted house, while trying to deliver the morning paper to various customers on a street (though unlike its predecessor, papers had to be delivered to houses on both sides of the street). Like the original, the game is renowned for its difficulty.
