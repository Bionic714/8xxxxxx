,ironymon,2013-02-26T13:52Z,"I wonder how many fools thought of joining a cult like so in this tv show. I did, a mere fantasy."
,adhey70,2013-02-27T20:11Z,this show is about as believable as mary poppins . but not as enjoyable . it makes the FBI look like incompetent fuck wits .
,oigveh,2013-02-28T20:26Z,"@adhey70, read your first two words ""this show"", its television douche-bag, comment on quality of upload, not your incompetent fuck wits of opinion"
,jmtdjmtd,2013-02-28T21:56Z,"oigveh, who designed you as the person that determine what can be commented on?
I happen to agree with what adhey70 said but even if i didn't i wouldn't have a problem with people expressing their opinions on the movie/tv show."
