Then you start the mission with principal weapons and all ammo and when you get to this point of the mission will be ammo."
,TayzGpa,2013-02-26T14:51Z,Tried Rulicos. Still no ammo. Will try this.

,DARKMANIAC33,2013-03-01T17:00Z,"The easier and ultimate way to fix the ammo problem:
Type ""MAP"" in console [“] and level reboots. Play it again and now you have ammo for BOLT SNIPER.

Enjoy!!"
