About half way through the show there's a promo for OZ: Great and Powerful which aired as part of the show with an exclusive introduction from Chris Harrison comparing the plot of the movie to the Bachelor's quest for love. Since cutting it out would have made for awkward transitions, we've left it alone since it was clearly part of the show"
