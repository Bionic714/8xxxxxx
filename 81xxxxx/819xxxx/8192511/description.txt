Harry Dresden has survived the events of Fool Moon - barely - but all is not well in his world. He's still alienated from his closest friend, Karrin Murphy, and on exceedingly poor terms with Chicago's number one gangster, John Marcone. And that's just the small stuff -- the creatures of the Nevernever don't take vacations and aren't particularly worried about Harry's friendships or love life.

Still reeling from the events of Fool Moon, Harry's been hired by a small-town Deputy Sheriff to look into a series of bizarre deaths linked to a singularly unfortunate family named the Talbots. Far from his usual Windy City stomping grounds, Mr. Dresden has nevertheless found some very familiar obstacles -- hostile law enforcement officials, reluctant civilians, and people protecting secrets. Oh, and at least one supernatural threat that isn't about to go down without a fight -- or at all.
