You have never read a comic like Dan the Unharmable. Looking for something that is three parts crazy and one part outrageous?

Step into the drug induced world that David Lapham has created and you'll wonder where reality has retreated to. Lizzy gets closer to the truth about her mother's relationship with Dan.

All she has to do is survive the most insane audition anyone has ever endured and the answers will be revealed.

But there's no easy answers on the lunatic casting couch ... only hard ones.
