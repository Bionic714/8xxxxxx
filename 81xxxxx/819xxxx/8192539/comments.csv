I call these shows the asifs
As in 'as if' that would happen.

,Toperharrier,2013-03-27T00:49Z,"@wiseguyy Cant agree more with you, Im about to drop watching it even when the idea and the show itself looked promising.

Most of the time Im laughing at how the director tries to masterfully change the story direction by making us believe such stupidity is even posible.

This show should be listed under sci-fi or fantasy, theres no way such bunch of stupid cops would make it to work together (I hope, at least)."
