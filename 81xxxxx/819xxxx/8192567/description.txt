Summary:

First title of a classic trilogy now brought back into print!
Firstborn, the first title in The Elven Nations trilogy, was initially released in mass market format in 1991, and it documented the ancient rise of the elven races in the Dragonlance world. Unavailable for the past several years, this title is now being brought back into print in a new mass market edition in order to fulfill the rising demands of consumers. The other two titles in this trilogy will also be re-released in the same season so that readers may easily compile the entire trilogy.  - Goodreads Summary of Firstborn (Elven Nations #1)
