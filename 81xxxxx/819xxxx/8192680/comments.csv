,Dinkaks,2013-02-28T11:50Z,Any reviews? is it computer voice or a human reading it? Are all the words from the unabridged book here in the audiobook?
,The_Abee,2013-02-28T13:30Z,"Well, I'm very much surprised why no one reviewed it so far. So, as an uploader how Can I miss this chance? ;) So, This definitely is an unabridged collection of Orwell's work which is performed by Humans (Not bots, Lolz). And,  apart of that the whole collection of 'Other Work' by George Orwell. As, I mentioned in Description. So, you might take a risk to download it, I make you sure that It won't make your PC to bust out. LOLz ;)"

@Dinkaks
Actually, I forget to add the review there yesterday due to some reason. So this is totally legitimate torrent. So feel free to download & do make your review.  "
