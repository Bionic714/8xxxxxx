______________________________

Orwell was a Indo-British journalist and author, who wrote two of the most famous novels of the 20th century 'Animal Farm' and 'Nineteen Eighty-Four'. Orwell was born Eric Arthur Blair on 25 June 1903 in eastern India, the son of a British colonial civil servant. He was educated in England and, after he left Eton, joined the Indian Imperial Police in Burma, then a British colony. He resigned in 1927 and decided to become a writer. In 1928, he moved to Paris where lack of success as a writer forced him into a series of menial jobs.

            | In a time of deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act. |
             ***************************************************************

 As, Orwell said once, his work reflects his thoughts of political criticism(& satire) very reactionary & revolutionary. So, This is my tribute to him.
