Description:

 Carbon is the missing app sync and backup solution for Android.

Carbon does NOT require root. All Android users can use Carbon to backup and sync Android applications.

Carbon lets you backup your apps and data to your SD card or cloud storage. With Carbon, you can sync app data from your other Android devices-- even if they are not on the same network. Set up backup schedules with Carbon, and never lose data again.

Carbon Setup
1. Install Carbon on Android
a) Root user? You're done!
2. Install and run Carbon Desktop (link below)
a) Windows users must install their Android drivers as well
3. Connect Android to computer.
a) You may need to set your USB Connection Mode to "PTP". (Nexus 7, Nexus 10, etc)
4. Carbon on Android should now be enabled.

Note: Carbon is NOT available to Motorola devices. This is because Motorola phones have a bug that break Android's backup mechanism. Until this is fixed by Motorola, Carbon will not work on those Androids. You can download Carbon manually here:

If you find that Carbon *does* work on your Motorola Android, please notify me.
