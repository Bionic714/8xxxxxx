Ek Doctor Ki Maut is a 1991 award winning film by noted Bengali director Tapan Sinha, which depicts the ostracism, bureaucratic negligence, reprimand and insult of a doctor and his research, instead of recognition.


However, since this movie is a monumental masterpiece in the parallel cinema genre, I always wanted to release the DVD Rip for DBBians.
So here is the DVD Rip of my favourite movie after Sholay.

SYNOPSIS
After years of painstaking research at the cost of his personal life, Dr. Dipankar Roy (Pankaj Kapoor) discovers a vaccine for leprosy. The news is flashed over television and overnight, an insignificant junior doctor receives international recognition. Professional jealousy and abuse of power threaten Dr. Roy, even as the Secretary of Health reprimands him for breaking the news to the press. He is asked to report to the Director of Health. Professional colleagues Dr. Arijit Sen and Dr. Ramananda invite him to a lecture but it is merely a pretence to humiliate him. Dr. Roy suffers a mild heart attack but he refuses to go to the hospital. His wife (Shabana Azmi) and a few others like Dr. Kundu and Amulya (Irfan Khan) stand by Dr. Roy, but the harassment continues; a letter from a British foundation, John Anderson Foundation, is suppressed and Dr. Roy transferred to a remote village. The last straw is two American doctors receiving credit for discovering the same vaccine. Dr. Roy is shattered.
