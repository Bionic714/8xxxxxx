,stiltken,2013-04-19T09:56Z,"thank you YIFY for your generosity and your consistent good downloads - I am  getting this now, sorry I cannot give any sound or picture quality as yet. Thank you again - much appreciated"
,crcycle,2013-04-23T06:41Z,Why does this block the sound as soon as I get to about 20 min into the movie. It says this device is not an authorized player of this video. I use my PS3 to play my video and am tired of having movies doing this to me. It is only from certain uploaders that I have this problem. YIFI being one of them... Please let me know what is causing this if you know. Thanks
