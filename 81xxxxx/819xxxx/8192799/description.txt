Lily Chou-Chou as a character was initially created by Shunji Iwai in 2000, as a part of an online novel that was posted on a BBS. The music was produced as a collaboration between Iwai, Salyu, a musician who had not debuted yet, and Takeshi Kobayashi, a music producer who had previously worked with Iwai on the soundtrack to his 1996 film Swallowtail Butterfly. Iwai supplied the lyrics of two songs to the project, "Arabesque" and "Tobenai Tsubasa."

In April 2000, Lily Chou-Chou music began to be released, with the single "Glide" and later "Ky┼ìmei (K┼½kyo na Ishi)" in June. Three Iwai-directed music videos were produced for the project, "Glide," "Ky┼ìmei (K┼½kyo na Ishi)"[citation needed] and "Tobenai Tsubasa." Salyu performed "Ky┼ìmei (K┼½kyo na Ishi)" on music shows Hey! Hey! Hey! Music Champ and Music Station in June 2000. The group released their album, Koky┼½, in October 2001, a week and a half after the release of the film in Japan.

After the release of the film, the group ceased to release music. In 2003, the Lily Chou-Chou song "Kaifuku Suru Kizu" was featured in the Quentin Tarantino film Kill Bill Vol. 1. Salyu debuted as a musician in 2004 with the single "Valon," a collaboration with hip-hop musician Ilmari. She began working with Kobayashi as her producer since her debut, and continues to work with him.
