Can't stop the rock.

RUNNING ROCKS
Sprint through over 140 levels, each one with it's own set of challenges to accomplish. Collect gems to unlock upgrades and new playable characters!

TIMING IS EVERYTHING
In Rock Runners, nothing matches the feeling of getting a perfect run. You'll need to use all your judgement, timing and quick thinking to get three stars on every stage though!

ROCKING VISUALS
