[V],murphy78,2013-02-26T09:22Z,"OK, finally got it named correctly. I uploaded this 3x. First 2x it named it ""Windows Vis0"" instead of ""Windows Vista AIO"", some strange bug... I will keep seeding the previous ones if you grabbed those... There's nothing wrong with them, the torrent was just uploading with an incorrect name."

,shukree,2013-02-26T14:46Z,"hi Murphy

good job as usual
because it is your release , that i test vista.
""feelings of depression"" is obvious in comparison to 7 and 8.
regarding ""I did all sorts of audit-mode - sysprep ...""

today and before your February release , i used your January one ,Audit-sysprep, but it did not shut down properly.

force-shutdown , taking the image,installing from it.

and now it is February 2013 fully updated.

thanks again"
,BlackDragontc,2013-02-26T15:53Z,"Did i miss the windows 7 SP1 x86 and x64 torrent from you Feb 2013, i know your busy and i'm in no rush, thank you for this though. "
,ikapman,2013-02-26T16:41Z,"Hi murphy,can you please do a win7 X64 Ent with office 2013 VL X64"
[V],murphy78,2013-02-27T03:32Z,"Hi guys... I have no plans to do a win7 with office sysprepped because of two things. One being that it is a lot harder to fool the genuine callback stuff in win7 because it does a callback in either the genuine activex update thing, and the kb971033.  It checks for blacklisted invalid KMS server epids.  Since every activator I'm aware of doesn't check for known blacklisted epids and randomize itself to a non-blacklisted version, I just don't feel confidently enough to release a special version for it.  I try not to add things that I know won't work very well.

That being said, yes I will release an AIO for win7 soon. I will do it up when I'm confident the torrents can sustain themselves. My first incorrectly named up still has a few stragglers downloading, but I might work on it tonight or tomorrow.

As far as sysprepped versions being viable options for the future, I think I'll just leave them to special case versions like win8+office.  There's just weird stuff that will come up when you use a sysprepped image on certain machines that never seems to come up when you use pre-integration methods like vlite or dism.

No worries guys, I won't give you any half-ass aio versions of 7 or 8 this month..."
,Mesiya,2013-02-27T17:54Z,"murphy 78 could make x86 and x64 seperate version. 

i only need x86 version which can be recorded to 4.7 gb disk.

[V],murphy78,2013-02-28T10:50Z,"negative, this was my final vista release."
,ikapman,2013-02-28T13:23Z,Is win 7 with IE 10 on the cards?
[V],murphy78,2013-02-28T13:53Z,"yes sir, been working on it for the aio."
[V],Anacondaz,2013-03-02T04:00Z,"your works are really awesome mate and ur comments are better than ur uploads lol
thanks for all ur hardwork
green skull is on ur way"
[V],murphy78,2013-03-11T13:13Z,"Heh... kind-of a fitting funeral for Vista. Hardly anyone downloading it, and noone gives a damn.  Now you see why this is the FINAL."
,datars1,2013-04-26T06:00Z,"any way of making the updates work?
