This is my FINAL Vista release ever. I didn't use 2 indexes
for each install on this one because the previous version with
OEM branding severely hampered the boot-setup. Vista likes to
read all of the OOBE info during that phase. You can still use
the previous version if you like it better.

I played around with different methods of integration for over
a week. Seriously. I did all sorts of audit-mode - sysprep
captures from pre-integrated sources and original sources.
The end result just wasn't satisfactory and I've accomplished
the same thing with Vlite using about 1.5gigs less space,
minus directx web runtimes. Chances are if someone really
wants to use Vista, they aren't doing it for 3D games anyway.

So that's it folks, this is the last Vista I'll do and it's
as un-crappy as I can make it. If it isn't satisfactory to
you, you can just not use it.  If you want to add the OEM
branding from the mdl project, just copy the oem folder stuff
into the oem folder from my release, but note that it will
seriously slow down the initial install. I tested the hell
out of every single one of these indexes. If you have a
problem, it's probably on your end.

Condolances Pirates,
