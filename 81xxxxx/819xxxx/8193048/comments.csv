,Larry2011,2013-02-27T16:38Z,SEED!!!!!!!!!!!!
,kitelime,2013-02-28T01:41Z,"big thank you for this, was hoping would upload the audio commentary. will def seed when finished."
,luf4all,2013-03-02T06:11Z,WHY make it a mkv? Is there any chance of just releasing the audio?
,sehkzy,2013-03-13T21:56Z,Am I doing something wrong here? When I play these files I just see and hear the regular episode...do I need a particular program for the commentaries? Or did they just accidentally get left out of the upload? How do I hear the commentaries?
,stormwern,2013-03-17T12:03Z,Where's the commentary? It doesn't show any extra audio tracks for me.
,stormwern,2013-03-17T19:23Z,"Never mind, worked with VLC player"
