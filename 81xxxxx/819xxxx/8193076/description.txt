Born and raised in Nashville, with parents immersed in the music business, it is perhaps not surprising that Caitlin Rose sounds like the essence of modern country music.
After youthful flirtations with punk, her 2010 debut Own Side Now was a charm-filled Americana-laden introduction to her talents. Now, three years on, its follow up seems no less likely to enchant.
Rose has an expressive voice, possessing both purity and trueness of pitch, and an appealingly human, direct tone. Only occasionally ornamented with harmonies, as on Only a Clown, the album otherwise opts to showcase it unadorned.
The vocal performance on the sweetly romantic wedding song Pink Champagne is slow, languorous and quite gorgeous: Rose savouring the tune and the sentiments in the least showy yet somehow most effective way possible.
The contrast between this wonderful singing and the sentiments expressed in many songs adds grit to what might otherwise risk blandness.
The streak of mild emotional sadomasochism in songs like I Was Cruel (ΓÇ£I never knew I was cruelΓÇª baby, ΓÇÿtil I met youΓÇ¥), or WaitinΓÇÖΓÇÖs ΓÇ£the love thatΓÇÖs gone, baby, hurts the bestΓÇ¥ is all the more interesting when combined with such tuneful delivery. The F-bomb dropped on Dallas, too, is pleasingly jarring. 
Heartbreak abounds, from opener No One to CallΓÇÖs broken ΓÇ£radio heartΓÇ¥ to Silver SingsΓÇÖ ΓÇ£way that only broken hearts can tellΓÇ¥ and MenagerieΓÇÖs plaintive description of ΓÇ£two lonely people with nothing to sayΓÇ¥.
This is often made more poignant by the subtle touches of accompanying steel pedal or flourishes of Hammond organ, reminders of the artistΓÇÖs and the albumΓÇÖs country music chops.
After a delightful run from No One to Call to Golden Boy, on which Rose seems to be channelling a 1950s Doris Day-type matinee idol, things drop off a little. Both Everywhere I Go and When IΓÇÖm Gone trade some of their Nashville allure for a more ordinary, AOR direction, and suffer for it.
Mainly, though, if Caitlin Rose is the future of Nashville and American country music, then it would seem that its future is in safe, appealing and mellifluous hands.
