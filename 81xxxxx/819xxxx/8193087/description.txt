Louis can no longer hide out at the Music Express Office so Stanley takes
him to a suburban flat to escape the manhunt. He is to wait until nightfall,
whilst Stanley goes to find his passport as they plan his escape out of the
country.

Stanley returns to the Imperial Hotel, to find that it's reputation has
been badly affected by the murder there.

Masterson takes over the new Music Express magazine, and surprises Stanley
by announcing he has offered a large reward for the capture of Louis Lester.
