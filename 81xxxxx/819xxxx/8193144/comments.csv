,bundyone,2013-03-05T07:50Z,"Hey Fonfon222, do you have eps 7 onwards?? I love this show!"
,Fonfon222,2013-03-10T04:57Z,"@bundyone: to my knowledge, there are no eps 7 aired at this moment.  The eps 7 and onwards that you can find on the internet are either half-version of the first 6 eps of season 2 or re-airing of the first season."
,Fonfon222,2013-03-10T09:58Z,Just got the eps 7 from season 2 and now uploading it.
