,uheardmebitch,2013-04-06T12:45Z,^ omg noob. you could have done nothing except made them worse
,trace535,2013-04-08T09:28Z,"To the contrary, 160 MB per 60 min is about 360 kbits/sec, which is really not sufficient for true 848x480 video, even when using the x264 codec.

Up until last year, the standard res for HDTV was 624x352, and I still find it perfectly satisfactory."
