,Diva_sms,2013-02-26T13:26Z,"It says right in the description of the release. Don't you people read?!

""The Block All-Stars Series 6 Episode 19

Episode 19 I hear you ask? No, there is nothing wrong, you haven't missed an episode! The pedants amongst us want numbering according to the official site (which I don't look at), so here it is. I just number according to what is in the local program guide, and when it's shown. Hopefully this will shut them up.""

Sheesh!

Oh and thank you so much BF. :-)"
,AlyH,2013-02-27T00:37Z,"it just helps when the numbers match, but I assure you I have no problems with whatever you number them!!

I'm in the US so if it wasn't for your uploads of all these great shows I'd be missing out on a lot (like this and Masterchef)

so please don't take any of my number comments as negative, I am very appreciative of these uploads!!"
,DngnRdr,2013-02-27T10:07Z,Numbering doesn't matter to me as I just grab the bigfish releases - I was getting sick of people bitching about numbering being different so tried to explain it - didn't work!
