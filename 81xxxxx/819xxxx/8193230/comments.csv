[V],Gh0stNet,2013-02-26T14:03Z,because that one is in rar forum while this on is in iso forum and not compressed thats why this one has a bigger size

Oh yea thanks got ya point man:) thx for the upload :D"
,rajtalreja,2013-02-27T00:35Z,"@Ashiq1118 
When you verify with abgx360 it will display you the region code, before you burn the dvd verify once again so don't worry man."
,Ashiq1118,2013-02-27T02:12Z,"@rajtalreja, bro i have already downloaded 2 times and none of it was region free.(although they were labeled as region free-complex copy). So anyone who downloaded this please inform whether it's truly region free."

,onelovekir,2013-03-03T19:32Z,"seriously guys...it will most likely be considered RegionFree once it is actually released on the 5th.  this shouldn't be your first rodeo, so why are you saying fuck you to Gh0st?!!? use your brains a little bit...just a little, please!  abgx360.net will not report the most accurate results until it is officially released and verified, I thought everybody knew this stuff already?"
,Tyclone,2013-03-06T02:25Z,"NOT RF!!!!!!!!
