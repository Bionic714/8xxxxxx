The city builder strategy game Imperium Romanum is
set in the time-honoured Roman Empire and players
will marvel in the incredible attention to detail
when working on a strategy to build a well
organised, prosperous and commanding settlement.
As governor of a Roman province, the fortune very
much lies in the players own hands. Imperium
Romanum is packed with a variety of new features to
enhance the gameplay such as a complete overhaul of
the graphic engine, a mass of authentic historical
buildings such as the world famous Circus Maximus
or Gladiator schools. The Emperor Expansion pack
takes the player to voyage through ancient history,
from cold Britannia via the wild forests of
Germania to the fertile Nile Delta in Cleopatra's
Egypt. 19 challenging, new scenarios at historic
places such as Aquae Sulis (Bath), Hadrians Wall,
Massilia or Treverorum will require all your
comprehensive economic and strategic leadership
abilities to succeed. Not only your competence, but
also your exposure with religion and the Roman
deities like Jupiter or Venus will play an
important role to accomplish your mission as a
Roman governor. Will you be able to earn the mercy
of the gods and rule the empire successfully?
