This I will keep just in case I need to look for movies I can't remember the names for. Thanks for this.

,harrisventura,2013-03-14T09:48Z,Afraid quality is not excellent. Maybe 6/10. It's what you'd expect from 3hrs of video in 900MB. You'd probably prefer a more faithful rip.
,harrisventura,2013-03-14T15:15Z,"Actually ignore that. First few seconds, things don't look great, but rest is fine, a solid 9/10. Apologies Brego, good work on the rip for such a small size, and btw appreciate some of your other uploads ;)"
