Weird Sounds - UFOs,SkyQuakes,Meteors,EarthBooms (2011-2013) xvid avi

I put together a collection of the videos claiming to be
sky sound weirdness. Now theres been so many faking them its now hard
to know the truth and which if any are REAL but seems that
scientists say some are real-see info.doc. (the trumpet one i believe are fake)
however since I lived through a quake. indeed it had this massive
sound like a jet plane/train noise mega decibels too so I believe
the earth can make these mysterious sounds

I suspect some are sonic booms from the space like meteors and also
maybe the earth moving. 2011 was the lead up to  the quakes world wide
and USA is way overdue

the sounds are still going as of feb 2013 (more fakes dont know)

but there was some new quakes lately and Meteorite flybys as well as
fireballs reported in usa and the big one that hit Russia recently


IF NOT LISTENED TO THE Coast to coast AM Weird sounds in a recent UFO
BUNDLE i did .. grab it and have a listen as well. it talks about
much of this collection


Enjoy and HELP SEED!
