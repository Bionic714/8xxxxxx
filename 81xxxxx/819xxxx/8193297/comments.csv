[V],STFmaryville,2013-02-26T16:49Z,"you're welcome dathmung and LincolnRex. i had put ""fred hembeck destroys the marvel universe"" in my brother voodoo torrent, and i came across this somehow. so i bought it a few weeks ago. if you're in the US, on amazon it's $11 used. you can also buy a new copy - autographed! - directly from www.hembeck.com for $30."
