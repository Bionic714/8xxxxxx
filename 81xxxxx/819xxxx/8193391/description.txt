Ep 15: The Real Housewives of Paris, Part Un

PREMIERE: Monday February 25, 8:00 pm
 
Prompted by a disturbing phone call earlier, Kim and Kyle confront Taylor about using alcohol as a crutch. Taylor then turns down a group trip to Paris in order to spend time with her daughter. The rest of the ladies, however, jet off to the City of Lights for fun and fireworks. TheyΓÇÖre worried, however, when Kim is late then acts increasingly strange, in a way reminiscent of her life before rehab. Lisa and Ken also take a side trip to San Tropez, where they reunite with Ken's grown son and his much-older wife, who was once a friend of Lisa's.
