The third season begins several months after the group escaped the farm, with Lori in the final days of her pregnancy. They stumble upon an overrun prison and begin to convert it into their new home. While searching the place for supplies, Hershel is bitten by a walker and Rick is forced to amputate his leg. They soon meet a new group of survivors, who are prison inmates. In exchange for food, Rick's group clears out a different cellblock for the inmates (most of whom end up killed) to reside away from Rick's group. A walker breakout then splits up the group. T-Dog is bitten in the struggle and sacrifices himself to save Carol. Lori goes into labor and insists that Maggie perform an emergency Caesarean section to save the baby. The operation kills Lori, and Carl is forced to shoot her to prevent reanimation. After several days of mourning, Carl and Rick name the baby Judith.[/color][/b]
