Book Description
PuppetΓÇÖs true power exists in the simple resource model it uses to manage the state of complex operating systems. This concise guide shows you how to extend that model and implement custom functionality on top of Puppet by working with the type and provider APIs.

Two experts from Puppet Labs explain the concepts behind these APIs, and provide instructions and examples to help you write your own fully functional types and providers. YouΓÇÖll also delve into PuppetΓÇÖs source code to get a better understanding of how types and providers are implemented internally. If youΓÇÖre familiar with basic Puppet concepts, youΓÇÖre ready to get started.
