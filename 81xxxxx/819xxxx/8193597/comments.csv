,live_amazin,2013-05-03T09:06Z,"Hi

Thanks for seeding! I managed to download.
Just to check with you what convertor are u using to extract the files and what format u save as? I extracted using ITUNES for A TIME FOR YOU album but the quality seems so different!

I even use CD walkman player to play but still quality is different. "
,sktaprh,2013-05-03T21:28Z,"The albums are extracted from CD with Windows Media Player for most of them, but for ""A Time For You"" I got it from a friend.
Would you like a better quality version?"
,live_amazin,2013-05-04T04:05Z,Ok Im quite surprised the quality is pretty good. Its okay will let u know if I need better quality version again^___^. Cause Im still hesitating whether to get MP3 player or stick to my old CD player. If u need TIME For You ripped let me know. 
,sktaprh,2013-05-04T17:37Z,"Thanks!
I'll let you know if I do need. Thanks again!"
