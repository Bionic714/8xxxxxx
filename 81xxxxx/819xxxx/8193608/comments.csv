thanks in advance"
,mycophage,2013-04-28T01:55Z,"How is this a Mac version? The only executable is a Windows .exe file. The instructions in the description are ""Run setup_krz_act_i.exe and install the game"", but it's not clear how to do that."
[V],esharoth,2013-05-02T15:02Z,"How you managed to get an exe file by downloading this torrent is beyond me. The only files are:

- KentuckyRouteZero_ActI_MAC_complete.dmg
and
- Description.txt

Also, those instructions you mentioned don't appear anywhere. 

Are you sure you donwloaded this torrent and not the one for the Windows version of the game?"
,mycophage,2013-05-02T17:08Z,"Thanks. I must have had one of the other windows up when I got the torrent, and downloaded the wrong one. "
