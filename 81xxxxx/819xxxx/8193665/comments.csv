,Demo99,2013-02-26T13:40Z,Thank you!
,Homeoplasmine,2013-02-26T14:49Z,"Quality?
after Reloaded's Crysis 3 release I am skeptical"
[V],Mr.Stifmeister,2013-02-26T16:15Z,"@Homeoplasmine: Dont blame RELOADED, he did fix his crack.
So yes this is working."
,Devillord2009,2013-02-26T16:30Z,"Crysis.3 INTERNAL.RELOADED is an imperfect emulator to the game, FIFA had, a releas like this both then they cracked it properly, so Crysis 3 RELOADED is comming in the near future!"
,brownnotesuicide,2013-02-26T16:34Z,"@Homeoplasmine it works perfectly, i don't know why your bitching about an overrated watered down FPS for...the first one was the best one, 2 and 3 were garbage, get over it."
,brownnotesuicide,2013-02-26T16:35Z,"it works perfectly, meaning this Torrent...i can give 2 shits about AAA shooter rehash 3"
,Homeoplasmine,2013-02-26T17:11Z,"@brownnotesuicide: I dont even care about Crysis 3 tbh, I care about the scene being more and more shoddy tho..."
,oposeu,2013-02-26T18:13Z,"Game works fine, I'll seed with something about 1mbps ;)
Thank You Reloaded, You've made my day :D"
,oposeu,2013-02-26T19:20Z,"And actually simple request.
Stop downlaoding 'till there'll be about 500 seeders, because now noone can download at normal speed ;)"
,Fluid56,2013-02-26T20:20Z,"fuck off with self-righteous bullshit homeoplasmine, you wanna be skeptical, go back to pirating from mediafire."
,przemyslavitz,2013-02-26T23:12Z,"Got a little problem. When I launch the game, I can still see my mouse cursor. It's really annoying and interfering with gameplay, because when I want to turn camera around, first I must move cursor to the edge of screen :/ Please help :/"
,truth7747,2013-02-27T00:06Z,SeeD plz... downloads at 0.6 kb =( SeeD
,Flimx,2013-02-27T01:29Z,"Uploaded 33gb, but still only on 85% myself.. wut?"
,klip1,2013-02-27T10:00Z,game is gay as fuck fyi lol
,dulex83,2013-02-27T10:28Z,"I remember how angry I was when it came out for consoles 3,4 years ago and not for Pc and now its finaly out!!! still cannot believe hehehe. thank you thank you thank you :)...what a suprise o my!!
greetings from Croatia....cheers"
,waabla,2013-02-27T11:13Z,"Game works fine,seeded almost 30GB"
,Homeoplasmine,2013-02-27T11:23Z,"@Fluid56: you can't call me self righteous for wanting the scene I was once involved in to keep such things as INTERNALS under wraps from people on torrents; keep it for their top sites because at the end of the day it damages the reputation of some groups. but here I also blame people putting up torrents of releases that are not meant to be put up as torrents...
When I said I was skeptical about the release I wasn't so much skeptical about reloaded's work, I know they have their problems but I also know they are leggit, but I was skeptical of it being uploaded by an ""autobot"" without clearing up what the initial source is..."
,Arzanii,2013-02-27T11:35Z,"I can't download this at all.. Getting 0/kbs 
God damn it."
,filip989,2013-02-27T20:37Z,"Thanks for this, I played it on X360 a few years ago. But I have a problem, can anyone help... when I need to copy the crack files it says I need an administrator permission, so I can't do it. It's win7 64bit home premium. Anyone knows what to do here?"
,kingdogss,2013-02-27T21:58Z,hey assholes we want to know about this game not crysis 3
,Uesugi1,2013-02-27T23:26Z,"The game works fine until the mission: Battle of Bladehenge (18% completition). You basically play the guitar for the fans and then the troops are supposed to appear but nothing happens, you are just stuck there."
,hwarming,2013-02-28T02:33Z,"Downloaded and installed fine, but when I go to copy the dll's from the crack over I get Windows 7 telling me bullshit about ""Everyone"" not giving me permission, never had this problem with cracks, and I copied them over in safe mode, now the game is just telling me that it won't run because it encountered some error."
,Sarg338,2013-02-28T06:18Z,@hwarming Turn off your Antivirus and then try to copy it over.
,klawx3,2013-02-28T13:15Z,is it multilenguaje ? or just english 
,nenadradojcic,2013-02-28T15:27Z,The game is awesome! It works like a charm! Thank you! :)
,kidofdeath,2013-02-28T18:52Z,Is it compatitable with DX 10.1?
,beatcrusaders,2013-02-28T20:28Z,"I played this game on the PS3 few years ago,beat it and I'm gonna say this game was a huge disappointment,its my opinion though so...but wow only now they released a pc version??"
,atechsavy,2013-02-28T20:53Z,love Black..but this game is...stupid and borin..sorry...got bored in first 5 minutes
,Arzanii,2013-03-01T01:55Z,"How the fuck do you people download this? 3 days and i'm only on 7% done.

And it's only with the games from Stifmeister."
,RAMEN00DLE5,2013-03-01T04:10Z,more and more shoddy......why don't you start cracking then asshole instead of bitching that RELOADED isn't up to your fucking standards?  THEY FIXED THE CRACK
,atechsavy,2013-03-01T08:51Z,"the game works..so the crack is fixed, to downlaod faster make sure you clean the peers...use high bandwith allocation..and try bit torent cause tiny torrent is fckd up"
,Jumbo245,2013-03-01T18:18Z,I have a problem when i want to copy crack the copying process is stuck and afterwards my whole system is stuck and i have to reset pc
,lordradish,2013-03-02T01:51Z,"When I go to setup.exe, I get ""access denied"". Firewall and av turned off... running Win 8 64.. anyone else have that prob?"
,mfrost666,2013-03-02T16:09Z,"Is it possible to play multiplayer? or at least against A.I.?
thanks."
,Ultralazuli,2013-03-02T20:24Z,"yeah, honestly wtf is up with the torrent part of this business? 51 seeders out of 1521 and only ~10.6 kbps downloading? is this normal for day zero/one releases? cuz i don't remember any other day zero or day one releases having this much difficulty.

i usually average around 1.8 MBps download no matter what it is, but this is ridiculous."
,Ultralazuli,2013-03-02T20:28Z,"and this has been almost 3 hours now downloading this 8 gig torrent, and it isn't even a day zero/one torrent!"
,strongiam,2013-03-03T17:58Z,"please, seed =("
,Agonix,2013-03-03T21:05Z,"Same problem as guy below me. Battle of Bladehenge, can't recruit anyone from the Fan Geysers. Is that crack problem?"
,Homeoplasmine,2013-03-04T22:59Z,"the maturity here is staggering.
let me guess you are all 16 year olds sitting in mama's basement...
learn life, learn the scene, and stop calling people assholes.
seeding stopped (10G/s box)
have fun!"
,fookov,2013-03-06T14:23Z,"For the ""bugs"": it is just because the keys aren't shown! 
The earthbreaker attack is: left clic+right clic

THE BATTLE OF BLADEHENGE fans bug: Just press tab to select units ;)  
Took me a while to figure it out!"
,Azrael91,2013-03-08T00:15Z,"Can someone please upload the fixed crack only?
I'm sick of this trojan shit."
,tiz2,2013-03-10T13:16Z,@ Homeoplasmine: Self-righteous and a whiny bitch too. 
,Homeoplasmine,2013-03-14T01:14Z,tiz2 *eyebrow raise* seriously? calling me selfrighteous because I decided to not seed to entitled kids anymore? just confirms my opinion of public trackers
,tiz2,2013-03-17T23:37Z,"@ Homeoplasmine: Nope what you said makes you self-righteous, and getting all offended and making a point out of stopping seeding is what makes you a whiny bitch. Your latest comment only cemented my opinion."
[T],TAKINI,2013-03-18T23:41Z,PC version [port] is way better than the console edition 2 years back..
,Eski93,2013-03-19T22:43Z,"i found a trojan in this, anyone else? :S"
,stackerman,2013-03-24T12:31Z,stop being cheep you can get this game for 2 bucks ps3 and xbox lol
,patrickchhakchhuak,2013-04-01T12:33Z,Downloading this game but i hope i dont get the same problem like Dead space 3 ... the game can be played but saved games are all crasher SAD download it for 1 w 1 d and this happens shit!
,Muaddib58,2013-04-04T14:41Z,"@Eski93

I got too, but it seems its a false positive, since a online scan by 40 different programs got only 3 positives. It works."
,Kagirion,2013-04-06T10:49Z,"hELOOO,
Anyone else get stuck after the bridge collapse?
Car just sits there like the controls are disconnected, watching the scenery.

:D"
,Kagirion,2013-04-06T16:28Z,"Nevermind,
Going to 'map' and then exiting freed it up, all good!"
,Jallin,2013-05-07T21:58Z,For those interested this game is currently part of a humble bundle if you pay more then the average (currently 8.25 but that will go down as the $1.00 donations roll in).
