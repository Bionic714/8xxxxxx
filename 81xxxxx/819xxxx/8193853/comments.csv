,Mutegrill,2013-03-21T00:04Z,"YIFY-group releases more and more movies with to low audio quality (trying to win the small-sized-war?).

In this one, 96 kbps audio bitrate is a bit to low, resulting in some clicking. Not unbearable though. A bit stupid, because keeping it to 128 kbps would be quite a big difference.

Just a tip to any of you rippers: Try to keep audio bitrate at a minimum of 128 kbps and audio sample rate at a minimum of 32 000 kHz. Thus it can be played on most systems without to much suffering. Though, top notch high end stuff craves alot more that."

I'll never download a YIFY file again"
