Brutal Legend is an action-adventure that marries visceral action combat
with open-world freedom. Set in a universe somewhere between Lord of the
Rings and Spinal Tap, its a fresh take on the action/driving genre, which
in this case is full of imitation cover bands, demons intent on enslaving
humanity and Heavy metal tunes. Featuring the talents of comedian, actor
and musician, Jack Black as super roadie Eddie Riggs, as well as cameos by
some of the biggest names in metal music it's a wild ride in the belly of
the beast that is not to be missed by gamers and Metalheads alike.

Included as a free bonus in the PC version of Brutal Legend are both the
Hammer of Infinite Fate and Tears of the Hextadon multiplayer map packs.
