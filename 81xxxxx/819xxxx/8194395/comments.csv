Hopefully, I'll be able to dl this torrent before all the Leechers ruin this torrent for good!  You know that Complete Hellblazer torrent?  Took 3 days to dl.  :-(

[V],STFmaryville,2013-02-27T02:48Z,"i feel that the key to seeding a torrent is this: once you get one or two downloaders to 100%, it usually becomes healthy quickly ... for a big torrent (and most of you know i u/l some whoppers) you really have to use all the u/l speed you can and it still takes many hours, sometimes even days, to make it healthy.

i'll seed this as long as it takes, even though i've moved on to other books :-)"
