PROFILE:

The album was released in 1990, the group is called Rat Bat Blue and the title is Squeak. The combo is of Scandinavian origin especially in Sweden. Members are not all unknown since found guitarist Chris Lind and Freddie Von Gerber drummer who officiated in the side of Easy Action Tommy Nilsson and Kee Marcello. The album’s style is between rock, pop and AOR. To give you a more accurate one is from John Parr, Jack Wagner and Stage Dolls.

 If this is the case you will have 100 times as reasons this album is excellent even though we can see one side a bit antiquated in production and in synth sounds. Besides Angelina final ballad that is not famous, everything else is to advise at the highest point with a side of the great AOR Hi Tek as a bit of Jack Is Back, Back In The Back Seat or Talk To Me and the other titles a bit more rock like Stage Dolls Long Gone or White Line. Are special arrangements made guitars but also quite abundant in many synths which gives a stamp to Rat Bat Blue. It is not in the Scandinavian AOR pure juice because the keyboards are more pop than rock, even when they sound like New Wave on the verse of I Need Love.

It is this side of the original combo that gives the flavor to this album more melodic quality which, not surprisingly with a Nordic group.
