For XVID AVI with MP3 audio, current consensus suggests:
V=9
A=9

I only encode WEB-DL (LOL / DIM unreliable source)

GET YOUR STEREO HERE, GOOD WEB-DL STEREO YOU'LL FIND NOWHERE ELSE
.
I don't know how many realize that something is audibly wrong with the WEB-DLs.
Same problem 1080p or 720p. The problem is immediately evident under headphones
or any sound system with good Stereo seperation.
.
All stereo has an important mono component - the primary speaker(s). We've been
culturally taught since the invention of radio to count on the primary voice being
dead center of your attention, be it an old timey radio grille or the center of a
video screen.
.
The goof, of course is that the primary voice here is only in the left channel.
They left the right channel half of it out altogether. So, the simplest move
would be to mix the two lopsided stereo (3/4 L, 1/4 R) signals down to one
mono track where everything comes from dead center. But mono is so '70s.
.
I like my solution better - balanced primary voice and stereo sounds and
presence to boot. Betcha can't guess what I did? (I have the 'touch'?)
It's a power we all have within us ... I'm just a little more full of it ... heh

Don't get your hopes up over this series. He's the guy what brought us
"Crossing Jordan" and "Heroes". He starts strong, gets lost and wanders and then ...
He'll have a brand new series to snow you with. Kring, Tim Kring.
Here's how you can tell - try watching every other episode - makes the same sense.
Now, if Joss Whedon were doing this, boyo! (Bufffy, Angel, DollHouse).
