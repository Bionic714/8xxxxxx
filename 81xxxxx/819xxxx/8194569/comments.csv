,gjones88,2013-02-27T09:31Z,I love you Dylan. Please marry me!
,xxjaretxx,2013-02-27T10:30Z,"Thanks abunch Man! Ive been around for years on TPB this is the first comment i have ever left. I am going to post this comment or one similar on all of the popular shows and movies I get. The MAIN REASON FOR MY POST IS I WANT TO TELL/REMIND EVERYONE THAT THE ""COPYRIGHT ALERT SYSTEM"" was launched yesterday. Most of the major isp's are involved, AT&T, TIME WARNER, VERIZON, and CABLEVISION, along with many others. SO GET BEHIND A VPN if you don't want your ISP dropping you for copyright infringement. Supposedly u get around 5 warnings then they drop you.  Just a friendly heads up to all you Pirates! here is a link to a news article about it, pretty basic column. :: http://news.yahoo.com/pirates-beware-industry-isps-launch-copyright-alert-system-000744092.html PROXY VPN or ""Borrow"" Wi-fi from the neighbors for your downloadingl I had a VPN in the past but it made my downloads drop DRASTICALLY so I currently looking for the best VPN or other option where I can maintain a decent speed. I appreciate the work you put into uploading, and the sourcing that goes into it. You seriously rock man, Keep up the Great work!"
,woprr,2013-02-27T11:14Z,"Well, xxjaretxx is a nice neighbour, wants his neighbours jailed for his downloads :-(

Get a PC for dummies course, buddy, one hop proxies or neighbours wifi do not provide any anonymity, tor is too slow,

and nearly all latest bittorrent clients support encryption and privacy blocklists, 

so this nonsense alarm system won't detect anything, 

just fear propaganda. Keep seeding."
,woprr,2013-02-27T11:46Z,"To be clear, the BT clients encryption is better than vpn, because it's using point-to-point connections, but vpn's for this use case are concentrators which may provide easy mass- monitoring, by the FEDs e.g.

xxjaretxx, does not trust his own contracted ISP under laws and courts he can use against them, 

but rather trusts some unknown VPN provider crooks under no law, maybe now setup in 10000s by FBI or content industry detectives?

Good luck."
,xxjaretxx,2013-02-27T12:15Z,"damn guy, dont shoot the messenger! 
                                                         ""Announced in 2011 and originally set to begin by the end of 2012, the alert system is an effort by the movie, TV and recording industries and major cable providers to move much more swiftly to issue warnings whenever copyright owners discover that an account is being used to access or download pirated content.

The system was created by the Center for Copyright Information, which includes the six major studios, record labels such as Warner and EMI and internet giants such as Time Warner Cable, Verizon, AT&T and Cablevision. Along with the Motion Picture Association of America, the Recording Industry Association of America and the Independent Film and Television Alliance are also involved.

The alerts will go out automatically when internet service providers are notified that piracy has occurred - hopefully as soon as a day after the content is accessed.

In the new system, users will be directed to a landing page after receiving five to six warnings. That page will require them to contact their internet providers or respond to some educational materials.""""

I use at&t, so we will c what comes of this if anything. For the time being i will not be applying a VPN quite yet, but if i do get a notice i sure as shit am. You must not live in America, where you can go to jail for enjoying a movie. "
