Some of the best blues tracks ever taken from the first few Fleetwood Mac albums with Peter Green (when they were good, before the days when the women crucified their songs!, although to be fair Christine Perfect was in another blues band on Horizon label (Chicken Shack).

In glorious lossless (FLAC) format.

PLEASE PLEASE, why has nobody uploaded the 1st few Fleetwood Mac albums in lossless format?
