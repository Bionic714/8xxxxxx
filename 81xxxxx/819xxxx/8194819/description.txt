This is a classic psych album in every sense: trippy effects, phased/wah'd guitars, searing leads, wasted vocals/subject matter and the obligatory 'experiment' pieces, tho' these are not as prominent as you'd figure knowing that this is a double lp.
Despite the title, this is not a solo album by any means, as Bob Smith had a large backup band that featured members of the Mothers of Invention.
