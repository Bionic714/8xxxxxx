,war59312,2013-02-28T02:56Z,"10bit? WTF!

Got to be kidding me. What a crappy thing to do.

No benifit from going 10bit today. In fact its much worse because now 95%+ of users wont be able to play it back.

Only can play on PC as no hardware device supports 10bit or at least not with hardware decoding so good luck getting it to play lag free.

So stupid!"
,JDub8,2013-02-28T08:29Z,Would anyone mind uploading just the commentary files? I'd like to merge them with my -publichd releases

,B.H,2013-03-19T19:46Z,hhhh. Why not ?
,wongnog,2013-03-20T13:43Z,Does anyone have just the audio commentary files they could seed?
,tomahawk_dts,2013-03-21T07:11Z,@ war59312 : the only stupid thing here is your comment. ESiR's rips are delight to see. Go into TV-3bit-shit-rip section if you like it more.

,manyakpo,2013-03-23T05:55Z,"Come on guys, seed this ffs"
