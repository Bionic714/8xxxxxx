,mentallyours,2013-02-27T16:16Z,"Playing their fifth road game in seven nights and against a team that's pretty decent on its home floor, the Boston Celtics had the deck stacked against them. That's why Boston coach Doc Rivers called it their best win of the year.

Paul Pierce had 26 points and Avery Bradley scored a season-high 18 points as the Celtics overcame the Utah Jazz 110-107 in overtime on Monday night. Kevin Garnett had 13 points and 10 rebounds while doing most of his damage in the second half for Boston (30-27). He had 10 points and nine boards after halftime to help Boston to its fifth straight victory over Utah (31-26). Gordon Hayward had 26 points to lead the Jazz, who fell to 2-1 in overtime games this season"
