[V],QborT,2013-02-26T20:28Z,"The scene release for this episode was labeled incorrectly (so were the P2P ((mSD and AFG)) encodes because they just followed what KILLERS wrote).  KILLERS put the title as Swamp People (S04E03), if you search for that you will find other sized rips of this.

But still nice job uploading a (mostly) properly labeled rip of this DeepThinker.  You should have included the scene group (KILLERS) in the title though, then it would look more official."
