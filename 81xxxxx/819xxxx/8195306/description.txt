I provide useful supplements to my student guide book, Understanding Karate Do. I hope that the resources, especially the forums, will help you increase your understanding and answer any questions you may have. As you progress in your overall ability, I also hope that you can find your own personal area(s) of specialization. It is with this in mind that I have provided a wide variety of resources that expand upon some of the areas I cover in Understanding Karate Do.
