  With Recovery it becomes obvious that Eminem's richest albums aren't necessarily his most structurally sound, which isn't much of a surprise when considering the rapper's full-on embrace of flaws and contradictions. This lean, mean bipolar machine began life as Relapse 2, but when Shady decided he wasn't really Shady at the moment and that he was no longer keen on Relapse -- or the last two albums as he states on ΓÇ£Talkin' 2 MyselfΓÇ¥ -- it became Marshall Mathers time again, so damn any 11th hour issues. This results in an album where a shameless but killer Michael J. Fox punch line (ΓÇ£The world will stop spinninΓÇÖ and Michael J. FoxΓÇÿll come to a standstillΓÇ¥ from ΓÇ£Cold WindΓÇ¥) is followed by a song with another, less effective MJF joke (ΓÇ£Make like Michael J. Fox in your drawers, playin' with an Etch-A-SketchΓÇ¥), although that song is the lurching heavy metal monster ΓÇ£Won't Back DownΓÇ¥ with P!nk, and it could be used as the lead-in to ΓÇ£Lose YourselfΓÇ¥ on any ego-boosting mixtape. Following an apology for your recent work with a damnation of critics and haters is just sloppy; taking off the skits and then overstuffing your album by a track or two is undermining what's good; and the beats here are collectively just a B+ with only one production (the so good ΓÇ£So BadΓÇ¥) coming from Dr. Dre. Add to that the detractor idea that being privy to the man's therapy sessions just isn't compelling anymore and the only persuasive moments remaining are the highlights, but fans can feed on the energy, the renewed sense of purpose, and Marshall doing whatever the hell he wants, up to and including shoehorning a grand D12-like comedy number ("W.T.P.," which stands for "White Trash Party") into this emotionally heavy album. ItΓÇÖs fascinating when Em admits ΓÇ£Hatred was flowinΓÇÖ through my veins, on the verge of goinΓÇÖ insane/I almost made a song dissinΓÇÖ Lil WayneΓÇ¥ and then ΓÇ£Thank God I didnΓÇÖt do it/IΓÇÖda had my ass handed to me, and I knew itΓÇ¥ before sparring with said Weezy on the Haddaway-sampling ΓÇ£No Love.ΓÇ¥ When the recovery-minded ΓÇ£Going Through ChangesΓÇ¥ gets back on the wagon by sampling Black SabbathΓÇÖs very druggy ΓÇ£ChangesΓÇ¥ itΓÇÖs a brilliant and layered idea thatΓÇÖs executed with poignant lyrics on top. Add the man at his most profound (the gigantic hit ΓÇ£Not AfraidΓÇ¥) and his most profane (ΓÇ£You wanna get graphic? We can go the scenic route/You couldnΓÇÖt make a bulimic puke on a piece of corn and peanut poopΓÇ¥ from ΓÇ£On FireΓÇ¥) plus one of thickest lyric booklets out of any of his albums and the fans who really listen are instantly on board. It may be flawed and the rapperΓÇÖs attitude is sometimes one step ahead of his output, but he hasnΓÇÖt sounded this unfiltered and proud since The Marshall Mathers LP, so to hell with refinement -- bring on the hunger and spirit of 8 Mile.
