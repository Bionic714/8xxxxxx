All the World's a Stage is a double live album by Canadian rock band Rush, released in 1976. The album was recorded at Massey Hall in Toronto on June 11 through 13 during their 2112 tour. Similar to a lyric in the track "Limelight" from 1981's album Moving Pictures, the title of this album alludes to William Shakespeare's play As You Like It.

This performance of "2112" omits the "Discovery" and "Oracle: The Dream" sections of the studio recording. The final 32 seconds of "Discovery" are played as a lead-in to "Presentation," but the liner notes do not indicate this. Rush would not perform the entire suite live until the 1996-97 Test for Echo Tour, as documented on the live album Different Stages.

The medley on track 9 is marked as below on the album but runs as follows: "Working Man (first half)/Finding My Way/Working Man (second half)/Drum Solo" before jamming out the end of the medley.

Following along at the end of the last song the album closes with a bit of post-show chatter among the band members and the sound of a slamming of a door as they leave the venue.

All The World's A Stage was remastered again in 2011 by Andy VanDette for the "Sector" box set
