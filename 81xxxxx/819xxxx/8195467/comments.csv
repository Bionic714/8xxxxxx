,mojo-666,2013-02-28T16:19Z,"@thortin: Download ""The Unarchiver"" from the App Store (free), then double-click on money-watesca.rar"
,mojo-666,2013-02-28T17:37Z,"To answer my own question: no online play. Trying to connect results in an ""Invalid login or passwords"" error. This seems to be the AppStore version, wouldn't it be the same login/password for everyone and shouldn't it be hardcoded? Maybe someone with a working AppStore version can sniff the password from the network traffic?"
