A man is bothered by a couple who is talking during a movie. He becomes their stalker.

The Faithful and the Foul is a dark comedy, low budget, independent, art house, feature-length movie. What it lacks in production, it makes up for in story and acting and film-making.

Helmed by Aaron Hendren, this darkly comic indie tale follows a social reject who splits his time between stalking his dream girl and turning life into a nightmare for a couple who committed the unpardonable sin of chatting it up during a movie. Riffing on the 1980s films of director John Hughes, The Faithful and the Foul stars Abigail Blueher, Chad Brummett, Dodie Montgomery, Summer Olsson and Babak Tafti.
