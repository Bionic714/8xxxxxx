[V],Mr.Stifmeister,2013-02-26T20:08Z,"@GateKeeper13: This is real RELOADED release as all my reloaded torrents.
Some games and updates doesnt go to pre sites.
Sometimes they forgot to pre a game and just uploading it.

Anyway, Enjoy :)"

,ffhighwind,2013-03-07T13:32Z,"Where is the hell is the save directory?

Game works fine at least up to Chapter 3. No trojans detected. 

Steam detects it loading into the game and names it Unreal Development Kit."
,ffhighwind,2013-03-07T14:31Z,"Apparently the game saves directly into the binaries folder.

C:Program Files (x86)EleusisBinariesWin32

Saves are named:
Eleusis0.bin
Eleusis0Game.bin"

,lolhowdoinet,2013-03-17T14:26Z,"When I'm launching the game, it's asking me for a .NET framework 4.0 . should i just look it up and install it from a random place or do something else?"
