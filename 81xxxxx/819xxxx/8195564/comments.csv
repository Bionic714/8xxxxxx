,GettinToreUp,2013-03-01T06:26Z,"@Jansiman 

hello new friend. welcome to tpb. i suggest finding a different anti-virus program. do a little reading and find 1 right here, on tpb. cracks will give false positive on avg and other inferior programs. also, do a little reading and lurking before posting. good day"

@Jansiman
I also got the same ""Trojan detected"" warning, so i did a Metascan

Funny that avg didnt detect anything.
