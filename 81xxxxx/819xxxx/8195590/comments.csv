,mojo-666,2013-02-26T23:33Z,Has this been actually tested on private servers? Because all cracked 4.3.4 Mac clients so far had problems like not being able to loot corpses.
,feruend,2013-02-27T20:29Z,"Yes, but this client fixed!"
,mojo-666,2013-02-28T01:12Z,"Ok, so instead of seeding the whole 15 GB, why don't you just seed the fixed .app? Everyone can patch to 4.3.4, the files are available all over the place. We just need the fixed app!!!"
,mojo-666,2013-02-28T02:04Z,"EDIT: Just noticed that the content isn't packed, hence everyone can just pick any files he wants, e.g. only the World of Warcraft.app folder. Nice. Now we only need a seeder ;-)"
