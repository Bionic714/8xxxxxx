I have to make a request..sorry;

'Waiting Room'.

Its a film about an ER waiting room in I believe Oakland(?) Anyway..the Wife is an ER nurse and she's been asking me to find this recent Doc and I cannot. But if I can find it...well..umm..anyway..fortune will smile upon me for a day or two..

Thanks for this one though.."

,muLineZu,2013-04-09T00:44Z,"The English subtitles are hardcoded! Now, the container is mkv, so you can put any subtitle in it, and enable or disable them as you please... so why to hardcode the subtitles anyway? But even if you do so (you know the reason, 'cause I can't imagine) it is usually mentioned: Subs.... English (hardcoded).
Is it to much to ask?"
