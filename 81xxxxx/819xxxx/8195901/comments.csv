,Doodlebugg,2013-02-27T14:17Z,Have been downloading nearly all the great stuff you put up.. thanks a lot forr your efforts.  Particularly pleased to see Drop In reseeded. It's only been partially seeded for a year or two & I wanted the vintage Beatles in particular. You have wonderful taste in music.. but then again I'm biased I guess.
