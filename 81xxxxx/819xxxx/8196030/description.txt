How I Go: Kenny Wayne Shepard Band

The new albumΓÇÖs lead single, ΓÇ£Never LookinΓÇÖ Back,ΓÇ¥ sets the tone for the record by drawing on the mojo from his early materialΓÇö but youΓÇÖll notice thereΓÇÖs a playful irony at work as Shepherd also looks back, musically, at other great artists from the past: Its opening riffs are an obvious homage to Keef, the driving rhythm pays respect to Billy Gibbons, and the nods to Stevie Ray Vaughan are plentiful, including a few quoted licks from ΓÇ£Tightrope.ΓÇ¥ Guitarists will enjoy ShepherdΓÇÖs carefully crafted formula of showing his reverence for the great players and styles that came before him while also employing the approach that put him on the map. His cover of the BeatlesΓÇÖ ΓÇ£Yer BluesΓÇ¥ puts to good use the woodshedding he did to pay homage to Jimi on the most recent Experience Hendrix tour. It fuses ΓÇ£Hey JoeΓÇ¥-ish elements with the ΓÇ£When the Levee BreaksΓÇ¥-type groove that undergirds some of his best soloing on the album. His supercharged tone on that track is to die for. Kenny Wayne Shepherd's How I Go not only serves as a strong reminder of the chops that caused Guitar World to place him right behind B.B. King and Eric Clapton on their list of blues guitarists, but it's the strongest indication yet of his gifted songwriting talent. The album pairs Kenny's deeply soulful and impassioned takes on classic material like Bessie Smith's "Blackwater Blues," Albert King's "Oh, Pretty Woman" and The Beatles "Yer Blues" alongside the strongest writing and co-writing of his career thus far. 
The hard-rocking, blues-based, guitar-driven album sounds young, it sounds fresh. Yet it has that distinctive energy and vibe drawn from the deep heritage of the genre. Kenny Wayne Shepherd is growing as a songwriter, musician and producer.
