In my quest for a good copy of LIKE CHILDREN, this CD was recommended by Amazon


and I took the bait because I really like Jerry Goodman's music.  


Howard Levy is a founding member of the Flecktones.  He "invented" new ways
 

of playing the harmonica.  This is HOT music...track 1 pulls you into it's 


groove.  Don't ask me to explain what STRANGER'S HAND is probably a reference to.
