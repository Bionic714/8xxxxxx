,sylvianre,2013-02-27T17:47Z,"The subs don't work correctly. There should be hardsubs for the nonenglish parts. There are only softsubs for everything - so you need subs for the entire movie just to know the indian parts.

Why are release groups becoming so lazy? Nearly all releases have this problem. "
