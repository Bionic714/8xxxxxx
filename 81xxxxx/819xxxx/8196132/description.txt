Living off the Grid with Organic Gardening

If you find yourself worried about all of the junk that is tainting the American food supply, then you might want to consider starting your own garden. Yet, if you use tap water and fertilizers you buy from the store to tend to that garden, you just might be tainting the produce you are growing. One of the best ways to have a garden and avoid these problems is to garden off the grid. This book will explain what that means and how you can effectively do it, so you can enjoy the fruits of your labors without any worry about additional costs, environmental impact or contaminants for your family.

Introduction: What Is Gardening Off the Grid?

Gardening off the grid is a fairly simple concept. In fact, it involves gardening techniques that were common before the advent of electricity and running water. Basically, when you garden this way, you garden with just what Nature provides: rainwater and sunlight. No electricity, no tap water and no unnatural additions to the soil. Simply good old natural provisions.
