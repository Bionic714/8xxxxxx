You're welcome. :)
Also, doesn't the Nvidia driver vary depending on your graphics card? So what's yours? Are the links provided by Anandtech fine for you ?  http://www.anandtech.com/show/6758/nvidia-geforce-31407-whql-available
They're direct links to the Nvidia drivers. I use IDM for downloading. So even if it gets cancelled, I can resume it later. Search piratebay for IDM or Internet Download Manager if you need it.
If you still can't download it, then I'll upload it. My upload speed's really slow, that's why I'm a bit hesitant to upload big files."
