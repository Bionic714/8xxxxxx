BE SURE TO FOLLOW ALL INSTRUCTIONS EXACTLY AS DESCRIBED, IN THE EXACT ORDER!

IMPORTANT: EXTRACT ALL ARCHIVES TO PATH - DO NOT EXTRACT TO NEW FOLDER!

Due to file count restrictions on torrents here at TPB, I had no choice but to compress everything with WinRAR - The RAR files are meant to be extracted right where they are (Right-click RAR, select 'extract here' - If you do not have WinRAR installed on your computer, I have it here:All archives have full Recovery Records.

Archives contain:

File Set 1.rar
===&gt;  v1.0.7.0 Update
===&gt;  Razor1911 No-CD (GTA IV)
===&gt;  Offline Installer
===&gt;  XboX Controller Emulator
===&gt;  Xliveless v0.999b7
===&gt;  GTA IV Cheats
===&gt;  GTA IV Handbook

Episodes From Liberty CityFile Set 1.rar
===&gt;  v1.1.2.0 Update
===&gt;  Razor1911 No-CD (EFLC)
===&gt;  EFLC_x64.reg
===&gt;  EFLC_x86.reg

Episodes From Liberty CityFile Set 2 (Parts 1-5).rar
===&gt;  EFLC Directory

I recommend that you do not delete the archives until you have fully installed the game, and tested every function of it - This way, if there is a problem, you can simply re-extract the files, and start over again.
