It is an undeniable pleasure for the modern individual to look at the work accomplished by his or her own hands with a sense of pride and ownership. While humans will no longer generally starve to death if we donΓÇÖt preserve food at home (as we once would have done) we still enjoy the self-reliance that doing so brings.

A Beginners Guide to Home Canning & Food Preserving is for anyone wanting to learn the art of Home Canning. The book cover such topics as:

History of Food Preservation
Definitions of Various Food Preservation Methods
Food Safety and Safety Precautions
Sourcing Tools, Equipment and Food
Altitude Adjustments
Water Bath Canning Details & Pressure Canning Details
Recipes Including Jams, Jellies, Butters, Chutneys, Relishes, Pickles and Meat Fish and Poultry

If you are an old hand at food preserving and canning you may even find a new recipe included in book.

Although the canning process is the most labor intensive procedure, all methods promote a sense of pride, accomplishment, and self-reliance. ThereΓÇÖs nothing like opening the pantry or freezer door on a frigid winterΓÇÖs day, where the snow - already up to the window sills - is coming down so hard you canΓÇÖt see your mailbox, and finding row upon row of neatly labeled produce and meats and remembering once again that if the world ended outside your door, your family would still eat well.
