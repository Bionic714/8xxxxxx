(This book was formerly titled "Crunching the Numbers")

Some people like the idea of producing their own food. They want to grow a garden or raise animals, or otherwise provide for themselves. Others are 'preppers' and have been buying and storing food in case of disaster, hardship, or other turmoil. It's a great plan, but knowing how to produce your own food is real security. Hand in hand with that is knowing what you'll need to produce, preserve, and store that food.

This books is about the numbers. It's not a how-to book, it's about what you need for the ΓÇ£how toΓÇ¥. We'll look at figuring out how much space you need for gardens or animals, how many jars you'll need if you plan to get into canning, and what other options there are for preserving and storing food.

I'll talk about animals and their needs, and suggest ways to feed and shelter them that won't break your bank account. I'll point you the right direction to find out what you need to know about foraging, hunting, and fishing, plus share some tips from my own experiences.

This book is geared toward those with limited funds, but will also be helpful to more prosperous readers who are considering growing or otherwise providing for most or all of their own food. The 'how-to' may vary but the numbers are the same, whether you're rich or poor.
