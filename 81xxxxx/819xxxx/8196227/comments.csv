I used to always laugh when I saw WinRAR/WinZip posted in forums, and the file itself is compressed - Nobody ever stops to think about how they will extract it once they get it LOL - I know a lot of people don't trust self-compiled EXEs, but with compression programs, it's pretty much the ONLY way to do it right :-P"
,D0gmeat,2013-02-28T03:00Z,"Well one could always download the demo/trial versions to do the unpack, uninstall the demo/trial or use the keygen/key/patch to turn the demo/trial into the real thing... :)"
[T],relentlesstech,2013-02-28T03:35Z,"Isn't it just so much easier this way, though? LOL"
,Crusnikk,2013-02-28T04:38Z,"@ dogmeat thats the way I usually do it. however i have wished for the program, what relentlesstech has provided, for a long time. nonetheless, he has made me happy! I should also mention i trust your torrent too!"
[T],relentlesstech,2013-02-28T12:57Z,"@Crusnikk:
Thank you!  It took a long time of having quality torrents to become 'Trusted', which is tough when only about 20% of downloaders actually SEED when finished :-P"

You obviously need a better A/V o.O"
,extracube,2013-03-17T09:55Z,"Simply perfect, installed like a charm.

Side question:  Have used this and *other* versions of winrar (on 3 different OS's) to compress a 1gb file when making a rar, yet the 1gb still comes out as exact same size when rar'ed.  Any ideas why?

Otherwise this file is perfect.  Thank you."
[T],relentlesstech,2013-03-19T00:41Z,"@extracube:
If you were trying to compress an audio file, video file, or ISO (Also most EXEs), they are already compressed as much as they can be - There have been many times that I RAR'd an album folder, and there was no change at all in the file size, even with max compression ..."
,shallow02,2013-03-25T19:45Z,"My Norman Security Suite went to town on this one :(

As you are a trusted uploader, I took the chance to disable scanner while installing. No problems with any of the installed files.

Works great, thanks :)"
[T],relentlesstech,2013-03-26T01:08Z,"@shallow02:

I'm really surprised that it threw up a false-positive - I haven't had anybody tell me that in ages, and I've been re-using the 'keygen' for any updates - It IS safe, though LOL :-)"
,Lasergurka,2013-04-17T18:27Z,"Using win8 now.
Keygen don't seem to work. Winrar says it's a 40 day trial even after keygen is ""successful"" 
Tried 64-bits version.

I have used this torrent on win7 with success.
"

I have it registered in Windows 8 Pro x64 - Did you right-click the keygen and 'Run as Admin'?
