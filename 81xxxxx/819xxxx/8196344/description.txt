The Chrysalis Years: 1973-1979 is a compilation album by the band UFO which includes 81 tracks, some not previously released. The compilation includes, in their entirety, the albums recorded for the Chrysalis label during said years, including (in order of appearance): Phenomenon (1974), Force It (1975), No Heavy Petting (1976), Lights Out (1977), Obsession (1978), and Strangers in the Night (1979). In addition to these albums, the compilation also includes a previously unreleased live set recorded at the Electric Ballroom in Atlanta, GA, several singles and B-sides which have not to date been released in CD format, and tracks recorded with engineers Bob Harris and John Peel but not included on the original album releases. Arguably, this period during the 1970s, is the zenith of the band's creativity, and The Chrysalis Years: 1973-1979 is an attractive collection likely to contain all the recordings by the band one might desire excepting for the most devout UFO fans.
