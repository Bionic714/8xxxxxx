,osriccc,2013-03-01T16:34Z,"Please give more details. I'm seeding right now but I want to know video bitrate, sound bitrate and maybe you could upload some screenshots of wide shots and close ups and give the links in the info above. Any subs? I hope no hardcoded. Complete with opening and closing credits? Thank you!"
[T],Danimal1q2w3,2013-03-01T19:11Z,"no subs at all, if you want subs you will have to supply them yourself, and here is the info for the first episode according to mediainfo, normally if i upload just one video file i post this info but for ten files i just skip it

,jamzkie,2013-03-02T12:56Z,no seeds? is this bluray source?
[T],Danimal1q2w3,2013-03-02T13:57Z,"Nah, I've had this way before the Blu-ray came out"
,saoirse3,2013-03-08T22:09Z,thank you to the ONE person with enough sense to make an AVI rip available. what is wrong with the world today that mkv and mp4 gets more hits? avi is soooooo much more betterest! thank you!
[T],Danimal1q2w3,2013-03-09T05:03Z,"Enjoy brother, please be sure to seed"
,snorsic,2013-03-17T02:49Z,Blotchy and looks bad on big screen not worth the download. A10/V2.
[T],Danimal1q2w3,2013-03-17T13:39Z,"Thats bullshit, ive got a 50 inch screen and it looks amazing, you must have old decoders and im not sure what youre playing it on"
,Pony113,2013-03-20T00:40Z,"I have a question. The picture and audio quality are top notch, but when i try to play these on either xbox 360 or ps3, the picture ""stutters"". Is there anyway to fix this?"
,jamzkie,2013-03-20T19:20Z,is this bluray source or hdtv???? comment on quality please? no 5.1 audio?
[T],Danimal1q2w3,2013-03-21T01:03Z,"@Pony113 
If I had to guess, maybe you're using a drive with a slow read write time, for a long time my xbox was the only way I had to watch stuff on my tv, and it always worked for me, flawlessly. Try a different USB device."
[T],Danimal1q2w3,2013-03-21T01:04Z,"@jamzkie TV source, quality is good, look in my torrents and there is a sample. And there is no 5.1, only stereo, sorry"
,gamer88liz,2013-03-31T04:59Z,Stellar job! Thanks again for uploading this and Season 1. I will be seeding. :)
,ajax2421,2013-05-02T21:53Z,I like your torrents bro. they are very detailed and i can tell you spent quite some effort on it. From that fact alone i can trust your content. keep up the amazing work.
[T],Danimal1q2w3,2013-05-22T04:56Z,"Thanks man I appreciate that, please seed :)"
