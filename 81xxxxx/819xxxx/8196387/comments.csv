I'd love a version of the Player Character Folio Like this. "
,Zanban,2013-03-03T21:10Z,I'll consider it. Currently working on quite a few different game sheets.
,Kraal55,2013-03-04T08:12Z,"Hi, thanks for this, its great. But why lock it, so you can't print? I simply used a pdf unlocker to unlock so I can print. I am sure everyone appreciates the work and time you spent on this but surely most people will want to print!? Thanks again. :)"
,Zanban,2013-03-04T17:39Z,"I locked it so people couldn't just change and re-upload. Being a pdf form there is no reason to print it. If you want a physical copy of a character sheet, just print out the actual character sheet.

The whole reason for this is so you don't have to have a physical sheet and nearly everything is done for you. Printing out a new updated copy every time would be a waste of not only time but ink and paper as well.

Just saying."
