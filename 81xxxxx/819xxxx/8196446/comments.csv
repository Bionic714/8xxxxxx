:)

Thanks again.

[V],STFmaryville,2013-02-27T02:13Z,"BabiesDontNeedSpleens, thanks my friend. By the way, if anyone has BRILLIANT #5 from Marvel/Icon (supposedly it came out in December) or SPACE: 1999 - AWE #2 from Archaia, I'd really like to have those!"
,elmacho74,2013-02-27T02:39Z,i was wondering do you have bad planet or bullet points? no one is seeding anymore on the links posted thanks for all the work you do
[V],STFmaryville,2013-02-27T02:55Z,"oblivious2000, http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/5079211/Spider-Man_Doctor_Octopus__Year_One"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-02-27T03:06Z,"elmacho74, you're welcome. but bad planet is seeded & healthy http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/4591338/Bad_Planet_-_Steve_Niles__%5Balieneye%5D_%5Bh33t%5D  i just downloaded the set, it only took about 8 minutes."
,Mothra67,2013-02-27T03:44Z,"Had to get this as Doom is awesome!

BTW will you take a request?  I am looking for the 3 issue mini from 1999 ""Dr Mid-Nite"" either TPB or the 3 comics is fine?  hope you can help me find this STFmaryville"
,elmacho74,2013-02-27T04:39Z,Thanks have been trying for days but it stays at 0%. any recommendations on how i can get it to download i am using torch torrent. thanks for the help
,BabiesDontNeedSpleens,2013-02-27T07:39Z,"Brillant 5 lists as not having dropped yet according to one of the ordering books i have, lists as for march 20 

Looking for the other still.

cheers"
,scienceho,2013-02-27T08:15Z,"STF, thank you for this, and everybody else- thank you for the civil discourse. 11 comments on a TPB torrent, in a row, 100% human decency. Hope for humanity restored. Carry on."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-02-27T12:57Z,"scienceho, thanks! i personally think Comics is the best area on TPB -- lots of great people here.

BabiesDontNeedSpleens, thank you for the info. my info had come from the official marvel site, which i now assume just hasn't been updated since bendis & bagley blew another deadline. the reason i was anxious to get #5 was that the official marvel site also says #6 comes out today. LOL! not gonna happen. thanks my friend.

elmacho74, i use uTorrent 3.2.3 and i'm not exaggerating, that torrent came to me from 0 to 100% is under 10 minutes. i was very surprised since you had stated it wasn't seeded. i'll re-up it for you today though. it's not a big deal. i also have bullet points ...

Mothra67, i can surely u/l that for you. i also have some golden age books to put up on here, since i know you love 'em. hopefully there are some issues you don't have."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-02-27T13:05Z,"oblivious2000, here's the last of the comics you asked about: http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8198524/BLACK_WIDOW_01-03_%281999%29_plus_WEB_OF_INTRIGUE_one-shot_REQUESTED"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-02-27T13:21Z,"elmacho74, here's one of your requests: http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8198648/BULLET_POINTS_01-05_%282007%29_%28Marvel%29_Complete_%28REQUESTED%29"
,elmacho74,2013-02-27T14:37Z,thank you. i will try Utorrent i appreciate the help. thanks for bullet points downloaded in less then 5 minutes.
,321loh,2013-02-27T15:17Z,"Since you seem to be taking requests on this post STF, I was wondering if you have Lone Wolf 2100, I got stuck at 96% for a week.
Also I would love good scans of Grant Morrison's Marvel Boy series.
If you can help out great, if not no worries. 
Thanks for all your hard work in the meantime."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-02-27T15:47Z,"elmacho74, no problem. i've got the bad planet torrent almost ready to go, but i'm trying to download something extra to throw in.  :-)

321loh, i can probably dig those up. however, it's new comics day and they are starting to show up now, so check back in a day or two."
,dwm015,2013-02-28T01:15Z,YOU ARE MFing AWESOME! Im the original requester! I didnt think I would ever get these!!  THANK YOU!!
