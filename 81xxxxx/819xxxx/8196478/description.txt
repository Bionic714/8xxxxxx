This Is A High Quality Audio Video Recording Uploaded By verydroll,
A Must Have For Serious Neil Fans And Quite Tricky To Find,
It's A Fascinating Documentary Looking At The Life Of A Legend,
Neil And Those Closest To Him Talk About The Early Days Up To The Present,
Often Funny, Sometimes Sad And Occasionally Revealing The Previously Untold,
Love Him Or Not, You Have To Admire His Iron Will And Perseverence,
Throughout His Fifty Years In Music He Has Always Followed His Heart And Soul,
Many Times He Has Taken What He Believed To Be The Right Path Musically,
Friendships Have Been Strained And Damaged But He Is Still Loved And Respected,
Refusing To Take The Best Financial/Commercial Route Has Won Him Many Admirers,
A Great Musician And A Great Man.

Enjoy, verydroll.
