Glastonbury Festival,

This Is A High Quality Audio Video Recording Uploaded By verydroll,
A Must Have For Serious Neil Fans And Extremely Rare,
I Was One Of The 120 Thousand Or So Awestruck Fans On That Beautiful Summer Night,
The Way He Mesmerised The Crowd, Especially On The Last Two Tracks Was Magical,
I've Been To Many Concerts And Festivals But This Was An Amazing Atmosphere,
Hopefully For Those Who Could Not Be There This Will Give You Great Pleasure.

Enjoy, verydroll.
