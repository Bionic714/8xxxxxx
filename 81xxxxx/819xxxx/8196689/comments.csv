,Azila,2013-02-27T07:04Z,thank u for ur reply...bro
,Azila,2013-02-27T07:05Z,hope this version will support my gpu ..with latest driver..and hope all max setting is enable :)
,ChiliNoMoreX,2013-02-27T10:43Z,"good luck with that... this game still pretty much bugged even with a lot of patches.
it still runs at 15~25fps on a med/high range pc... worst optimization i've seen since arma II, so you might be able to run crysis smoothly with high graphics but you won't be able to do it with this resource hog."
,veky12,2013-02-27T11:09Z,Thank you!!
,chrisroberts3,2013-02-27T12:02Z,I guess there is a market for these type of games on the PC as well. 
,Azila,2013-02-27T13:37Z,lolz...bro..i test already ..my PC got 40 fps to 55 fps with these new update :)

,AciDToX8,2013-03-03T08:36Z,Works for me... :)
,Godlee_oO,2013-03-03T11:10Z,"For the guys having the ERROR CODE 1,you need to have Uplay installed on your pc,its like a steam platform but its made by ubisoft.
Game works like a charm,7 hours played last night no crashes or bugs."
,forever123,2013-03-03T12:12Z,"Thanks ollirg!

Works perfect on my PC (win 8 64x)

just follow the steps posted by ollirg that will work. I just do not know if the DLC are working."
,valthonis_c,2013-03-03T17:56Z,how can i activate the DLC?
,pwn0zero,2013-03-05T11:06Z,"http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8200036/The.Settlers.7.Paths.to.a.Kingdom.Deluxe.Gold.Edition.DLC.Enable this exe makes the dlc work, i find it a bit funny since its almost the same exe, but either way it works, i can't get to work the dlc saves tho, can't load them after i save a dlc mission"
,cocoverde,2013-03-05T23:29Z,pwn0zero: same problem here. Waiting for a crackfix
,mrphilip,2013-03-06T18:46Z,"Everything works fine, if you follow the directions that somebody posted in the comments. The game itself is a sack of shit though. Do yourself a favor and play Civ 5 or Starcraft. This game is a joke."
,lords43,2013-03-12T13:22Z,"rather boring game, way to simple, combat consists of making just 1 click"
,Jimbob1211,2013-03-15T20:13Z,"Installed, updated, cracked - single player works fine (in offline mode).

However - I can't play multiplayer! Any ideas how to play multiplayer? Not possible?"
,viwp88,2013-03-16T02:28Z,"The game is on sale right on Steam. If you liked the game then you should buy it. Its only $13 at the moment because steam is having an Ubisoft weekend(ending March 18th). The deluxe gold edition has all the dlc. Thanks for this upload, I enjoyed it and just bought the game on steam myself."
,budwar65,2013-03-22T15:00Z,"thanx, fallow ollirg instructions, crack is in the TiNYiSO folder on the ISO....."
,MitchAllen,2013-03-23T03:17Z,"Did the Oilrig instructions. Update Crack Copy Paste Play method and when i get into single player it keeps telling me ""Trying to restore network connection"" EVERY time. Anyone have the same issue and fixed it?"
,MitchAllen,2013-03-23T03:22Z,I think I know why it fooked up for me. Cause i blocked it thru my firewall for good measure. I bet that's it.
,yago007,2013-03-24T09:48Z,"Works thank you very much :)
Don't listen to all that ""the game won't run at a decent fps because it's bugged"".

I got a GTX550ti 1gb with 4gb ddr3 on a quadcore 2nd generation (which is not even i3) cpu called Q8400, High settings on everything with all the checkboxes checked.
45 fps+."
,Izuna,2013-03-29T19:34Z,Ollirg instructions don't work for me. :c I keep getting Ubisoft Game Launcher Error 2. :l Anyone got better instructions?
,tuchaczewsky,2013-04-05T07:26Z,"TO ALL WHO WANT TO PLAY WITH SAVES IN DLC (Chronicles of Tandria in this case) 

As we know, when you  play any of the missions from Chronicles of Tandria (where real fun begin, by the way) you can save but saves are then locked as a DLC content and nothing can be done. There is simple solution that I found by chance.

WHEN YOU PLAY A MISSION SAVE BY QUICK SAVE (default: F5), THEN WHEN YOU WANT TO LOAD, JUST USE QUICK LOAD ON KEYBOARD (default: holding ctrl + F5).
It must be done during the game because
In the Main Menu quick save is still locked but using quick load during game works just fine. You can save, leave the game, then comeback, start any mission and quick load your last save. Everything works just fine, no ""locked"" features anymore.

It's only a one slot for a save but still, you can actually play DLC, without fear that one mistake and 6 hour long game is nothing."
,gever570,2013-04-05T14:57Z,Is it possible to play online also?
,tonyz_eagle,2013-04-16T12:01Z,after followed all instructions its asking me for a CD key! where to find it?!
,tonyz_eagle,2013-04-16T12:13Z,CD key required! where to find it?!
,thcfreak666,2013-04-21T21:00Z,Bad Torrent getting 6kb/s. FAIL !
,MoleculezXF,2013-04-23T16:39Z,tuchaczewsky - You are a life saver! Thank you very much for the solution. I was so anxious to play the expansion and when I saw my save games were locked I was so disappointed and you comment made my day. Thank you again!
,xaximus,2013-05-23T16:17Z,"I followed ollirg's instructions, however I'm still getting a server connection error when trying to quicksave while in the Chronicles of Tandria campaign.

Sigh."
,xaximus,2013-05-23T23:04Z,"Well, I went through the process again... exactly the same process, as far as I know, and it now works. Woohoo!"
,xaximus,2013-05-24T05:14Z,"Spoke too soon. The initial play was fine. Went back, starting a new game, used quick load to resume, and the server error popped up about 5 minutes later. Tested again, same problem."
,huntersteel,2013-06-01T22:06Z,asking for a cd key ... where can i find one ? ( just tried downloading a key gen. and turned out to be malwar so plz comme up with better solutions : )
