,CommonR,2013-04-01T12:01Z,"Stop downloading YIFY torrents they are crap.  Look awful, sound awful.  Basically these look like sub par dvd rips.  He sets the bitrate too low, compare two movies, one YIFY and one from a respectable uploader.  You should only use YIFY if you have low quality internet, and cannot find a DVDrip instead."
