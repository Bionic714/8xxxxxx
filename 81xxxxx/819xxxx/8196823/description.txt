Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site :: Radio talk show host and author Michael Savage is the guest today on the Tuesday edition of the Alex Jones Show. Savage and Alex analyze China's economic takeover of America, the federal attack on the Second Amendment and the ongoing effort to destroy the Constitution, and the ever-encroaching surveillance and police state as the global elite tighten their grip on humanity and the Supreme Court throws out a challenge to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Mr. Savage's latest book is A Time for War.
