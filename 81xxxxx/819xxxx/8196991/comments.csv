[V],RubrumPopulus,2013-02-27T12:34Z,"Dude.  Look in the file list of the Fables torrent pack I linked you to last time.  You'll see this at the bottom in the Graphic Novels folder:
Graphic Novels/Fables - The Last Castle (2003) (Obi).cbr
If you look on wikipedia it isn't 18b.  It's just a prestige format one-shot.  I suppose whoever prepared that torrent named it that way for ordering purposes, but that isn't how it was released.  
In any event, it's in the torrent I linked you to before...."
