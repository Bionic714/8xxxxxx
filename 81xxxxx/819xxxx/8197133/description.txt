Where I Lead Me

With the sudden nuptials of Wanda (guest star
Mallory Moye) and Tom (guest star Ross
Philips) in BlueBell, Zoe agrees to be maid
of honor, which entails the difficult job of
watching Wanda's crafty mother. Zoe uses her
wedding duties to try to avoid the
awkwardness between her and Wade, but has a
feeling something is wrong. Lemon faces the
memory of being left at the altar and decides
to take matters into her own hands.
Meanwhile, Lavon hears about the neighboring
town trying to build a shopping mall next to
their local beach and he enlists George's
help to fight it, but an unexpected side of
George rears its ugly head.
