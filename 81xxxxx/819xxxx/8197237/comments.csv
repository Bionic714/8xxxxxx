restarting and recreating everything, hopefully helps. the other ones are running fine."
,jdurdan17,2013-02-27T04:41Z,"This is not the right Part 4, this is the Part 4 from 2 weeks ago. I understand it has to be difficult keeping track of 12 to 15 GB's uploaded every week, but don't fix a mistake by making another one. I love what you do and I down load all of your stuff, but man this is a fail."
,thecardmonster,2013-02-27T05:05Z,"ship don't listen to this jerkoff, good job man. Shit happens. People are so ungrateful and love to point out the mistakes of others. What you do is hard and there are many of us who appreciate it no matter what. Keep up the great work, you and all of the other uploaders."
,dbranson17,2013-02-27T05:13Z,"yeah, the post with the problem is the one with all the issues of Love & Capes..."
,khaostar,2013-02-27T11:39Z,"Rule #1 of torrenting is not to be an ungrateful dick to the uploaders. Being able to download these packs is a privilege, not a right.  I think I speak for the silent majority when I say we are all very appreciative of the hard work you do on these, Ship.  That being said, as near as I can tell, this is indeed the part 4 for 1/30 instead of the nerfed one for 2/13, but thank you all the same for making a second attempt.  "
[V],STFmaryville,2013-02-27T12:44Z,"""but don't fix a mistake by making another one.""
that's what they did by choosing not to abort you.

shipjolly, thank you for all your efforts."
[T],shipjolly,2013-02-27T13:34Z,"please try it now. deleted and readded. reinstalled utorrent as well and that seems to have done the trick.

sorry for the troubles and thanks for the support against you know who :)"
,llaney1,2013-02-27T13:59Z,Thanks for all your hard work. Its appreciated. Could you please reup the number four with the love and capes stuff in it. I think you reupped an older one. Thanks again.
,llaney1,2013-02-27T14:17Z,Thank You. That was quick.
,khaostar,2013-02-27T14:50Z,"@llaney1 and anyone else still having problems: Go try the orignal 2/13 part 4 torrent again. Its connecting to seeders just fine now, whereas previously it would only connect to peers. Looks to be working normally. "
,jdurdan17,2013-02-27T16:09Z,"I told Ship he did a good job, so to cardmonster, STFmaryville you are fuckoffs and I trully pray you die a long and lingering death, I think bone cancer sounds good."
,Extremist,2013-02-27T17:35Z,"Thanks again, shipjolly!

And I think it's a typo in your name jdurdan, should be 07? 'Cause that number refers to your age, right?"
,EdoTrest,2013-02-27T18:18Z,Thanks shipjolly!  I left the other one up all week and it eventually got there... I don't mind waiting on the quality product you put out.
[V],STFmaryville,2013-02-27T18:29Z,"jdurdan17, lol"
[T],shipjolly,2013-02-27T19:07Z,"yeah, sorry an old one was added agai. I did add the new one but utorrent messed it up. Worked after the reinstall. Happy reading!
Now to try and add the new ones."
,thecardmonster,2013-02-27T20:16Z,"I'm already dying a long and lingering death, it's called marriage..."
