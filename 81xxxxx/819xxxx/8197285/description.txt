  Losing John Frusciante for a second time doesnΓÇÖt send the Red Hot Chili Peppers into a tailspin. By now, the Chili Peppers shed guitarists like a second skin, changing their outer layer but retaining their inner core. Such is the case with IΓÇÖm with You, the bandΓÇÖs first album since 2006ΓÇÖs Stadium Arcadium. If that double-disc was defined by its unwieldy sprawl, its songs spewed not sequenced, IΓÇÖm with You is characterized by its focus, both within individual tunes and the songs as a whole. New guitarist Josh Klinghoffer -- veteran sideman and longtime pal of Frusciante who provided secondary guitar on the closing stretch of the Stadium Arcadium tour -- doesnΓÇÖt compete for center stage the way previous Peppers did. He doesnΓÇÖt strut, he weaves, disappearing so completely into the arrangements he doesnΓÇÖt seem to leave his signature despite the heavy layers of guitars on each cut. This makes IΓÇÖm with You the flipside of One Hot Minute, where the Chili Peppers bent over backward to accommodate Dave Navarro: the Peppers donΓÇÖt miss a step, they almost seem relieved to be carrying on without Frusciante. Part of that could be due to a newfound musical elasticity, a reflection of Flea taking music theory classes at USC during the groupΓÇÖs half-decade gap between albums. Certainly a song like ΓÇ£Happiness Loves CompanyΓÇ¥ -- half Beach Boys, half Kinks -- shows a compositional dexterity unthinkable for previous incarnations of the Peppers, but thereΓÇÖs no showiness here, the album is all about precision. This extends to Anthony Kiedis, who neither hams it up on the ballads nor goofs around on his raps, he merely serves the purposes of the song like the old pro he now is. Ultimately, the Red Hot Chili Peppers are served well by that professionalism; theyΓÇÖre long past the point of proving themselves, theyΓÇÖre no longer here for a party, theyΓÇÖre rock & roll lifers, and IΓÇÖm with You illustrates they can settle into maturity convincingly.
