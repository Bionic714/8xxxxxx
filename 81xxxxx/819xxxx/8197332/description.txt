The Anti-Science Left

There has been a long-time anti-science current in right wing ideology, which sees evolutionary theory as a threat to religion and morality and climate change science as a threat to economic prosperity. But flip the coin over and you'll see an equally distressing mistrust of science by the left of anything that is unnatural: in food and food additives, of pharmaceutical drugs or vaccination, and of energy choices from nuclear options to fossil fuels, hydroelectric and wind power. Does your political ideology colour the kinds of science biases and suspicions you may hold? Is the current anti-science streak in our society a symptom of corresponding political extremism? Or are we all just afraid of the future?
