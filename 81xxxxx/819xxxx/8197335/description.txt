 : "If Pollock's powerful collection Knockemstiff was a punch to the jaw, his :
 : follow-up, a novel set in the violent soul-numbing towns of southern Ohio  :
 : and West Virginia, feels closer to a mule's kick, and how he draws these   :
 : folks and their inevitably hopeless lives without pity is what the kick's  :
 : all about. Willard Russell is back from the war, on a Greyhound bus passing:
 : through Meade, Ohio, in 1945 when he falls for a pretty waitress in a      :
 : coffee ship. Haunted by what he's seen in the Pacific and by the lovely    :
 : Charlotte, he finds her again, marries her, and has a son, Arvin. But      :
 : happiness is elusive, and while Willard teaches his only son some serious  :
 : survival skills ("You just got to pick the right time," he tells him about :
 : getting back at bullies. "They's a lot of no-good sonofabitches out        :
 : there"), Charlotte sickens,Willard goes mad--sacrificing animals and worse :
 : at his altar in the woods--and Arvin's sent to his grandmother Emma in Coal:
 : Creek. Emma's also raising Leonora, the daughter of a timid religious      :
 : mother who was murdered, possibility by her father, Roy, the visiting      :
 : preacher at the Coal Creek Church of the Holy Ghost Sanctified, who along  :
 : with his guitar-playing, crippled cousin, Theodore, in a wheelchair after  :
 : drinking strychnine to prove his love for Jesus, has disappeared. And      :
 : there's on-the-take sheriff Lee Bodecker, whose sister Sandy and her       :
 : perverted serial killer husband, Carl Henderson, troll the interstates for :
 : male hitchhikers he refers to as "models." Pollock pulls them all together,:
 : the pace relentless, and just when it seems like no one can ever catch a   :
 : break, a good guy does, but not in any predictable way."                   :
