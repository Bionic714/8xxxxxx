 : Bestselling author Donna Tartt returns with a grandly ambitious and utterly:
 : riveting novel of childhood, innocence and evil. The setting is Alexandria,:
 : Mississippi, where one Mother's Day a little boy named Robin Cleve         :
 : Dufresnes was found hanging from a tree in his parents' yard. Twelve years :
 : later Robin's murder is still unsolved and his family remains devastated.  :
 : So it is that Robin's sister Harriet--unnervingly bright, insufferably     :
 : determined, and unduly influenced by the fiction of Kipling and Robert     :
 : Louis Stevenson--sets out to unmask his killer. Aided only by her          :
 : worshipful friend Hely, Harriet crosses her town's rigid lines of race and :
 : caste and burrows deep into her family's history of loss. Filled with      :
 : hairpin turns of plot and "a bustling, ridiculous humanity worthy of       :
 : Dickens" (The New York Times Book Review), The Little Friend is a work of  :
 : myriad enchantments by a writer of prodigious talent.                      :
