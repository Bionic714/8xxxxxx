I ask cause ALL the uploaders (9) of this show have all released the exact same x264 and nothin else.  Thank you."

,Mr_Heisenberg,2013-02-27T22:12Z,"For those of you who haven't watch this episode yet, disregard fat-pack's retarded comment. It is absolutely false, ava does NOT die in this episode!! Sorry if that's somewhat of a spoiler but 
Ava hasn't even come close to dying since being shot a couple seasons back so that shouldn't be a surprise....."
