,prophet1776,2013-02-27T07:05Z,Could we possibly get this in xvid?  I'm homeless with just a cheap ass android phone and it doesn't play the x264 audio right.  It cuts in and out.  I only ask cause like ten uploaders all just put up the same x264 but not one xvid.  Thank u and sorry for whining.
,prophet1776,2013-02-27T11:37Z,How is it that every single up of this episode is the exact same 264 rip?  Did ya'll just decide collectively to not xvid this one or what?
