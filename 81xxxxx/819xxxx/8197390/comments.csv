,prophet1776,2013-02-27T09:33Z,Xvid please.  What good is nine or ten uploads of the exact same format?
[V],maximersk,2013-02-27T12:08Z,"They changed codec video ! :P
To download it with AVI / XviD codec, only AFG does it, now :("
,mwalsher,2013-02-27T17:44Z,"@maximersk, yes, the scene officially changed to x264, but plenty of independents still release in XviD because not everybody is rich enough to have iPhones and iPads.

Regardless, that’s not the issue here. The question is why a bunch of different people released the same file separately. Not only is it pointless, it also unnecessarily fragments the swarm."
,prophet1776,2013-02-27T18:52Z,@mwalsher.  Thanks for saying it for me.  I'm a homeless guy with a crappy little android phone that won't even properly play the 264 audio.  This is one of the only shows on tv I really like and its gonna suck if no one will put it out in that codec.  
[V],maximersk,2013-02-27T20:17Z,"wait a minute ! 
You watch tv shows in Iphone ! :O
Seriously, I watch them on DAMN PC and sometimes I put a cable HDMI via my 1080p HDTV !  :)
:P "

@maximersk way to rub it in jerk. :- Decorum would dictate that you *don’t* throw your good fortunate and wealth in the face of the less fortunate, but apparently you have no empathy or tact."

I really don't give a shit about you wrote
I was telling I'm just impressed to see a guy watch tv shows on his phone ! That's all"

@maximersk, no, that’s not all. Your first two lines were indicating your surprise about watching shows on a phone (which I don’t understand in this day and age; watching videos on phones is commonplace), but the second half of your comment was just showing off and rubbing it in that you have fancy, HD stuff while the OP doesn’t even have a home."
