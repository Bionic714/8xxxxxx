Larisa Kranden knows all about the evil that lurks in man's soul, and woman's. The lustful and reckless Larisa has a dark heart, and it is that negative aspect of her character that brings her to the attention of Zabo, a mysterious woman who plans to send Larisa on a mission to save the world. It will take a dark heart to meet and defeat a cold-blooded munitions dealer named Simon Darnell. Zabo gives Larisa one power: she can become invisible, leaving only one thing to be seen by human eyes - her dark shadow.
