When the Medway ValleyΓÇÖs psychedelic-mod hopefuls the Prisoners disbanded in 1986, organist James Taylor vowed to move into the realms of jazz, and away from rock. Assembling a quartet from Kent, England, comprising fellow Prisoner bass player Alan Crockford and ex-Daggermen personnel Simon Howard (drums) and Taylor's brother David (guitar), the band recorded a BBC session for disc jockey John Peel before Taylor retired to Sweden for a break. However, the broadcast made such an impression that the band was signed to new "mod" label Re-Elect the President. A mini-album of cover versions, Mission Impossible, featured "organ groovy" '60s soundtrack instrumentals like the single "Blow Up," with Jimmy Smith and Booker T. & the MG's providing the strongest influences. The Money Spyder took the theme a stage further; while the Damned had mocked the psychedelic soundtrack as Naz Nomad & the Nightmares, the JTQ reminisced on the beat and jazz age. Taylor become frustrated with the band's limitations, and by the time Wait a Minute appeared on Polydor Records dance offshoot, Urban, in September 1988, only his brother remained with him in the group.
