,IceDruids_,2013-02-28T03:00Z,"Mac instructions work perfectly - haven't needed to check ""Load out of date addons"" for any of your releases.  Thanks!"

,pikultybalt,2013-02-28T22:25Z,My archy addon (for archaeology) doesn't work with this zygor guide. I have to use the old version zygor guide in order to make the addon work. Can you please fix this?
,toskao,2013-03-01T13:07Z,No working... dont have seeders... i whait for 2 days.... 
,Raikalo,2013-03-01T19:04Z,"There are plenty of seeders, and the addon works just fine. As for Archy, I obviously can't fix Zygor to work with it as I don't make Zygor. 

You'll probably have to wait for a fix from Zygor that I'll post here after release."
