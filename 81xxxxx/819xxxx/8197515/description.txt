
After Trivium performed two of their own songs, they invited Robb Flynn of Machine Head and Corey Taylor of Slipknot to join them for the cover of the Metallica classic ΓÇÿCreeping Death' at the 2012 Revolver Golden Gods Awards 11 April in Los Angeles.

I played with the audio a bit to try and remove the annoying tones meant to cover up the swearing on live television...they completely missed the mark.

Anyway enjoy & seed.

Cheers
