,daemondog,2013-02-27T16:20Z,Great upload as always. Im ALWAYS coming to you for the shows I watch. Is there any way you could upload the Robot Combat League show that aired on scyfy last night? only one person has it uploaded but no seeders. I know there would be tons of seeders if you did it cause everyone loves your uploads. Thanks. :)

Maybe you should focus on finding shelter rather than keeping up on justified?

loljk soz for poking fun at a possibly sensitive situation and I hope he does that for you, although from what I've seen he seems quite busy..."
,ktehmok,2013-03-04T03:00Z,"plan987: please don't confuse homelessness with pushing a shopping cart around. My kids and myself are also homeless. It simply means I don't have a permanent address. among other things. (lol, long live free wifi). People think that if you have a means to get online, you can sell it and somehow find a place to live. Well, good luck selling a 12 year old laptop to anyone that isn't pushing a shopping cart :/.

I can say that I truly appreciate kind souls like those at eztv, ettv, yify, aXXo, and many others. They make my kids and myself feel at home no matter where we are.

TV is our escape & Justified is a top notch show. Unique, funny, great writers & acting.

Who knew I'd love the South LOL"
