 : In The Living Universe, Duane Elgin marshals evidence from cosmology,      :
 : biology, physics, even his participation in NASA-sponsored psychic         :
 : experiments to show that the universe is actually a living field of        :
 : existence and that we are always in communion with that field of aliveness :
 : whether we are conscious of it or not. This is a worldview that, as Elgin  :
 : explains, is shared by virtually every spiritual tradition, and the        :
 : implications of it are vast and deep. In a living system each part is      :
 : integral to the whole, so each of us is intimately connected to the entire :
 : universe. Elgin eloquently demonstrates how that identity manifests itself :
 : on a whole series of levels, from subatomic to galactic. We are, he writes,:
 : far more than biological beings; we are beings of cosmic connection and    :
 : dimension.                                                                 :
