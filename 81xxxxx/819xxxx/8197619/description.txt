 : In 1864, Union general William Tecumseh Sherman marched his sixty thousand :
 : troops through Georgia to the sea, and then up into the Carolinas. The army:
 : fought off Confederate forces, demolished cities, and accumulated a        :
 : borne-along population of freed blacks and white refugees until all that   :
 : remained was the dangerous transient life of the dispossessed and the      :
 : triumphant. In E. L. Doctorow's hands the great march becomes a floating   :
 : world, a nomadic consciousness, and an unforgettable reading experience    :
 : with awesome relevance to our own times.                                   :
