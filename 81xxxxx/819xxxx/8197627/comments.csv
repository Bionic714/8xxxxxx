,Ryall,2013-02-27T21:08Z,"Yes, the sound does go out of sync at 7:55.

In VLC adjust the audio synchronisation to +0.200 seconds to continue proper playback."

,iamrifter,2013-02-28T10:45Z,"It doesn't just get out of sync. There are serious video distortions as well. There is a ""PROPER"" of this release, available from some other uploaders on the bay (The.Colbert.Report.2013.02.26.Dr.Michio.Kaku.PROPER.480p.HDTV.x2). Hopefully eztv will upload that, too, but it is available."
,iamrifter,2013-02-28T10:47Z,"Ha! they did indeed! Dunno how I missed it. It's here: https://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8200417/The_Colbert_Report_2013_02_26_Dr_Michio_Kaku_PROPER_HDTV_x264-2H
Thanks again to eztv"
