 : This biography by Edmund Morris, the Pulitzer Prize-- and National Book    :
 : Award--winning author of The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt and Theodore Rex,  :
 : marks the completion of a trilogy sure to stand as definitive. Of all our  :
 : great presidents, Theodore Roosevelt is the only one whose greatness       :
 : increased out of office. What other president has written forty books,     :
 : hunted lions, founded a third political party, survived an assassin's      :
 : bullet, and explored an unknown river longer than the Rhine? Packed with   :
 : more adventure, variety, drama, humor, and tragedy than a big novel, yet   :
 : documented down to the smallest fact, this masterwork recounts the last    :
 : decade of perhaps the most amazing life in American history.               :
