[V],dhjudasx,2013-02-27T20:06Z,"i've nearly 140 movies already encoded that haven't been uploaded that only need to have the subtitles OCRed and cleaned up.

this shows how backlogged i am.

I've actually started ripping some of the older James Bonds Films... even with 24TB of storage.... all the demuxing and such without deleting sure chews all of it up quick."
