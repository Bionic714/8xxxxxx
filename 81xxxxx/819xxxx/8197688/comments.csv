,SHIFTY7900000,2013-02-28T04:16Z,Considering people are just hitting and running no seeding back after they hit a hundred percent I'm killing the torrent as I shouldn't have to seed for all it's supposed to be a joint effort you are supposed to share when you complete the file I'm a downloaded aswell as an uploader I have seen six get to a hundred percent only to bail seconds later so blame the ones who didn't seed it back as its a shit go of them not to help me seed it after I got them to a hundred percent if anyone is genuinely willing to help seed ill start it back up till then I'm doing nothing
