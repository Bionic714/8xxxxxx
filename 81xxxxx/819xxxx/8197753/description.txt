Looking at Movies, Third Edition is an accessible and visually dynamic introduction to film studies that offers more media support and a lower price than all of its competitors. The Third Edition of Looking at Movies is as visually engaging and fun to read as previous editions, and now contains new material on film history, film genre, and cultural contexts, and even more help with film analysis. 

Supplementary materials, conceived and created by the authors, integrate seamlessly with the text. Two DVDs contain nearly four hours of film clips, frame sequences, short films, and animations to show what the text describes. The Looking at Movies student website provides an abundance of review and ancillary materials, including the Writing About Movies guide.

The Looking at Movies package, including the text, DVDs, website, and writing guide, costs less than competing texts alone, making it an outstanding value for students.
