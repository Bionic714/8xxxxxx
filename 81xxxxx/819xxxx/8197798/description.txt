as a baby boomer i found this book very illuminating. it provided wonderful context for some of the issues that aging challenges me with.

from some reviewers of the book: 

"Hillman sheds new light on the aging process, showing growth where many see only decline."

"A humane and generous theory of character, one that grants each of us our individuality and oddness rather than trying to force us into a moral straitjacket. The idea that the eccentricities of old age are not signs of incipient dementia but expressions of our true inner selves is appealing."
