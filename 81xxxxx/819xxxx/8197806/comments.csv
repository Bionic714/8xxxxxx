seems the dumb ones are the ones that comment like that and cant read before downloading

people who download xvids dont want big or mp4 formats that fail/glitch on many devices still

if you dont want it dont download it.. if you want HD go and buy it "
[T],crwildman,2013-02-28T08:03Z,"@Jaktgal95   Your name should be Dumbass.  Because in the name of a file when it says HDTV.xvid that means it was converted from HDTV to xvid,  likewise when you see DVDRip.Xvid it means the same thing,  Except it was a DVD converted to Xvid.  So all you proved by making a comment was that your a idiot."
[V],psspss,2013-02-28T12:04Z,"lol this is what I made clear to TNE hassling me at kat on the stranded upload there.

hes blabbing about my sds made from HD not being 720p sources.. when actually some are
but thats not what I mean.. I mean its a hdtv source not some analoque tv source or webrip

most know this I think.. but also most know
the pros of xvid like the size and speed of decoding it and its quantizing pixelness
of the downside of the format when zoomed or
expanded on a large screen area"
[V],psspss,2013-02-28T12:08Z,"as far as I know SD is basically anything below 720 generally 480 360 or 240p that standards vertical sizings 

HD is either 720p or 1080p or higher

as storage increases and speed of devices increases and the limitations to scan more pixels on large screens increases Im sure next generation HDs will be like 2160p or 4320p LOL"
[V],psspss,2013-02-28T12:18Z,"heres the 720p HD version came out after mine 

shes comment about the shock so many seeding this? perhaps people just dont want 1.6gb files is why? and didnt want to want for smaller mp4s to show up or maybe they just wanted xvid ver lol
