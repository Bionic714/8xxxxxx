Keygen note:

The developer made some changes in the serial checking method to
prevent the serials of our keymaker from working. Since this is
one of the vital application for most Mac users, we decided to
release a new one and give some extra hints about the problems
the users may encounter.

This new keymaker will allow you to register v4.00 - v4.02,
while the serials generated by the old keymaker won't work if
you upgrade. Also, if you had any of our keymakers running
during the registration, the serial won't be accepted no matter
what. It checks if there's an running application's bundle
identifier's MD5 hash = "46461172D9C4EA25F95C98190245A7B6",
which is "com.core.keygen" in clear text.
