In Brothers In Arms: Hell's Highway, you take control of Sgt. Matt Baker, the hero of Brothers In Arms: Road To Hill 30. Just like the other Brothers In Arms games, you must lead your squad through various missions in World War II. Now you take place in Operation Market Garden, a huge push by the Allied forces to capture key bridges that will hopefully bring a quick end to the biggest war in history.
