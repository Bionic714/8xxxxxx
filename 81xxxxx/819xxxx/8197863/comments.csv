,BackDaFuckup,2013-02-27T08:48Z,cool thanx brah!
,squash34,2013-02-27T09:02Z,downloading now will let everyone know if it works
,squash34,2013-02-27T09:06Z,"i'm skeptical for two reasons

1. this uploader is using a graphic from the original game. not the sequel.

2. 369 MiB? i've seen videos of this game. it should be much larger than that.

I'll wait for someone to confirm this works before attempting it myself."
,squash34,2013-02-27T09:08Z,"3. Block Firewall? What the hell does that mean? A firewall blocks things. And the other two interpretations: enable/disable firewall don't make sense in the context of pirating a game either.

Now that I think about it I'm almost 100% sure this is BS."
,squash34,2013-02-27T09:12Z,nope it works :)
[V],HeroMaster,2013-02-27T12:03Z,"@squash34 When you see the name HeroMaster then do not even think for 1 sec that i would be uploading some fake stuff, I am not giving scene releases that does not mean that I would not be entertaining you guys, these are all my special releases before the scene could ever think of making it, if there would be any problem i will comment and tell you guys for sure to leave it for now, enjoy these releases and seed them for others cheers :)"

,abualanod,2013-02-27T19:12Z,niiiiiiiiice :D
,nignug,2013-02-27T23:38Z,"@squash34

You're a fucking moron. gtfo"
,j03y0,2013-02-28T20:02Z,"I run the setup.exe but get the error ""ExtractTemporaryFile: The file gws.dll was not found"". Good fast download but this is a nuisance, thanks in advance :]"
,tl2dev,2013-03-01T01:31Z,Holy crap this game is incredible once you get used to the controls(get a 360 pad or emulate it with ps3 controller) feel bad stealing this might just buy it off steam
,uwotmate,2013-03-01T02:15Z,It's not working for me. I get shader: failed to create effect compiler for default.OS: Win7 64 bit. 
,RNBWDSH,2013-03-04T06:34Z,@Squash. STFU idiot. Don't scare people away if you have no clue what you're talking about. A lot of game cracks require blocking the game from the fire wall. It prevents the game from contacting the server for authentication and updates
,Zamzumin,2013-03-04T08:31Z,"@RNBWDSH

Actually this instructions don't say anything about blocking the game from the firewall, but blocking the firewall itself (i.e. turning it off). So yes, while squash34 is an idiot for making 4 posts in a row just to realize that the game works, you should come up with a better reason.

Anyway, game works fine except for a few control issues when sliding. But that's probably the game and not this torrent's fault."
,Yorkfield,2013-03-06T21:03Z,"People with a two-digit IQ will understand what ""Block Firewall"" suppose to mean, while people with a one-digit IQ don't."
,360_fanboy,2013-03-08T00:22Z,"@Yorkfield
and how about people with three-digit IQ?"
,PCGD,2013-03-09T13:03Z,When i run it is saying AppID is not configured and Steam is not running but Steam is running
,PCGD,2013-03-09T22:20Z,No problem now :D
,squash34,2013-03-20T03:00Z,"@nignug

My concerns were logical and warranted.

In the end, this is a perfect release and I've enjoyed, beaten, and almost 100%'d this game.

But you, sir, are the fucking moron. And you are the one I banish.

I BANISH THEE. THOU ART BANISHED."
,winrrpgx78,2013-03-22T10:01Z,"@squash34  It means block the game in your firewall, (the exe file) in order to prevent it from connecting to the internet.  Pretty common with cracked games."
,winrrpgx78,2013-03-24T11:32Z,"Thanks for the upload, works perfectly.  Game sucks though lol I played it for like 2 minutes and uninstalled the motherfucker.  I suppose some people will like it though, it has good reviews."
,fishbong,2013-03-26T14:49Z,My Antivirus will not let me download this
,phunqe,2013-03-29T17:28Z,"@360_fanboy

No one who comes here has a 3 digit IQ."
,r4-g3,2013-04-22T22:55Z,if someone could upload the Mac version I would be eternally grateful.
,VermiIion,2013-04-24T19:26Z,"Where is the Main Game folder?
Please help."
,Cheesie11,2013-04-26T21:52Z,"@squash34

Makes me wonder if you've ever pirated a game before..."
,rizanda,2013-05-14T04:34Z,"what is the different between this one and that one http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8312885/Runner_2_Future_Legend_of_Rhythm_Alien#filelistContainer ?
I think the second one is simpler."
,thirstymidget,2013-05-19T06:56Z,thank you works great
