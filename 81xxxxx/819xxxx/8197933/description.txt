Harry Flashman: the unrepentant bully of Tom Brown's schooldays, now with a Victoria Cross, has three main talents -- horsemanship, facility with foreign languages and fornication. A reluctant military hero, Flashman plays a key part in most of the defining military campaigns of the 19th century, despite trying his utmost to escape them all. With the mighty Sikh Khalsa, the finest army ever seen in Asia, poised to invade India and sweep Britannia's ill-guarded empire into the sea, every able-bodied man was needed to defend the frontier -- and one at least had his answer ready when the Call of Duty came: 'I'll swim in blood first!' Alas, though, for poor Flashman, there was no avoiding the terrors of secret service in the debauched and intrigue-ridden Court of the Punjab, the attentions of its beautiful nymphomaniac Maharani (not that he minded that, really), the horrors of its torture chambers or the baleful influence of the Mountain of Light.
