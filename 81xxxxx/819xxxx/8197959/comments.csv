EXIT PATCHING

I've got nero 12 platinum downloaded with the key provided and it worked, but I was getting the failed patent activation with Nero Recode... what am I doing wrong?"

,FlamerFTW,2013-03-12T05:32Z,"purpleshedevil1: try right click patch.exe and choose ""run as administrator"" and also check that it finds the correct installation directory. "
,Polyblendz,2013-05-19T06:07Z,Ok I seem to be confused here... how come when I download this it comes up as an unrecognized file? Like when I even right click doesnt even have the run as administer option but instead it says pick program to open it with? Ive never had any other problems with patches except this one. Can someone help please? I fall in the category of the annoying Patent Activation fail.
