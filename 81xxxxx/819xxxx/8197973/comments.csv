[V],rr-ne,2013-02-27T23:58Z,"me neither im not much into reptiles

finding bigfoot is always a disappointment, the episode previews look good but when u watch the show, its complete crap!!

they just try to hype up the show as much as possible.. ratings....viewers.... ratings...... viewers"
[V],psspss,2013-02-28T01:37Z,"as I always said there much more interesting stuff out there thats not main stream media on mysteries to paranormal

did you listen to the coast to coast am I said grab and listen call more odd disappearences.. one of the most interesting chats ive heard.. and its linked to maybe bigfoots.. I guess maybe theres serial killer bigfoots after all they got human dna too :)"
[V],psspss,2013-02-28T01:41Z,"i think most people that follow me like my taste in shows and out of the normal stuff.. some will download just to check it out and see if like too.. often they do and get hooked :)
I have a certain taste in things I like from docus ,science,scifi,mysteries,education stuff and fiunny stuff dealers come under that and paranormal (inc UFOs).. I dont know how someone thats into ufos cant be in ghosts they go hand in hand

just putting together some more cool c2cam and ufo rips to share next"
