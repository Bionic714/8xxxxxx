,swine666,2013-02-27T20:00Z,Can someone watch this and tell me if the stupid bitch gets raped and beheaded in the end and therefore learns a hard lesson? If so it means this movie will be worth the time spent for download and watching!

Well seeing how the movie doesn't take place in India or any Muslim countries, no, the ""bitch"" won't be getting raped or beheaded. "

,master_cheef,2013-02-28T03:30Z,"Thank you Scene. Fuck all the haters. You always give us the best quality out there. I'm sick of these people crying about downloading a free movie. If you don't like it take your cheap ass to the theater. Or better yet, UPLOAD SOMETHING BETTER YOUR DAMN SELF!!!!  "
,dfl3506,2013-02-28T05:16Z,"master cheef  This is a made for TV movie, so pretty sure it would be free. Last time I looked freedom of speech is protected in the Constitution, so go fuck yourself."
,corymerlin,2013-02-28T15:19Z,"wow this was a bad movie 2 hours ill never get back, but it was so b grade it was funny g in buot worthso ok for one time not worth buying definitely."
,Raz3rrGreen,2013-03-01T10:25Z,"I disagree that this is a bad movie. Some people make out this movie to be like trolls 2. Lol, but really, the acting is decent and the whole scheme of teenage girls robbing a bank,hhmm, Priceless. Plus it's always good to have a certain person in the movie that will make you want to crawl into the screen to choke them out=) Anyways, great upload scene. "
