,DudeOnFire,2013-02-28T04:11Z,"@dptrumpeter91, haha. Still, I have to thank you for uploading these even if they're terrible!"
,upsidedownthumbsup,2013-03-01T08:12Z,"Hey dude i downloaded 01,02, and 03.  But i cant seem to use the camera profiles for 02 and 03.  I just cant find it when i go to the camera calibration menu.  HELP? I really want to use 02."
,dptrumpeter91,2013-03-01T08:47Z,"@upsidedownthumbsup there's a pdf in the main folder that explains how to install the profiles and such. I actually found also that you can install the profiles in the Adobe Photoshop Lightroom install folder, under Resources, then CameraProfiles. Hope that helps. Oh and that's for PC... no idea about MAC. Hopefully it works. "

,Allexandder,2013-03-02T19:35Z,"I still use Lightroom 3, are the LR4 presets compatible with the previous version? Thank you dptrumter91!"
,dptrumpeter91,2013-03-03T03:57Z,"@Allexandder ... They will, but they won't look as good. I mean, you're already on a pirate site, I'd just go and get Lightroom 4 if I were you ;)"
,Allexandder,2013-03-04T17:42Z,"@drtrumpeter91 Lightroom 4 requires Vista or later, I tried to install but it's not working for me. Any idea where I can get VSCO film for LR3? Have a nice day, thank you! "
,dptrumpeter91,2013-03-04T22:35Z,@Allexandder VSCO does not make any products for anything under Lighroom 4. 
,dptrumpeter91,2013-03-05T02:09Z,"@Allexandder I guess I lied. It seems they make VSCO 01 for Lightroom 3, but good luck finding it because everyone is pretty much upgraded to Lightroom 4. I mean, I'm sure you can try installing these and seeing if they work. All of the file extensions are the same, it just might not produce the same results. "
,dtown20,2013-04-24T02:59Z,Any tips on where to find the Aperture version?
,struggle903,2013-05-30T07:34Z,@Allexandder same problem:(i can't upgrade to lr4 and doesn't work well in lightroom 3
