[V],HighCode,2013-02-27T12:21Z,"Alien (1979) (theatrical)
Aliens (1986) (DC)
Alien³ (1992) (DC)
Alien: Resurrection (1997) (DC)
we got here."
[V],HighCode,2013-02-27T12:32Z,"Bollocks, Alien (1979) Runtime: 01:56:38 so probably is DC. I'm confused now."
[V],dhjudasx,2013-03-02T07:25Z,"for clarity sake, having just recently watched both... the Theatrical cut has less scenes the just run longer most often, the DC cut has shorter scenes but more of them, and arguably faster progression. All opinion however on which is actually better... Would have been nice to keep all the original and simply just ADD the cut scenes for it.

DC cut is precisely 1 hour, 55 minutes, 50 seconds long. Which is commonly viewed as 1:56

Theatrical is usually shown as 1:57. But it's hard to say short of downloading it."

Thanks for enlightenment, I then suppose DC should be more interesting having more scenes.
I remember that some scenes were a bit too long.
I watched them long time ago though.
Better shorter but more of them in my opinion at least. 

@Hex86
Thank you for the comment about the quality. People need encouragement ;-)"
[V],dhjudasx,2013-03-08T00:53Z,"Your welcome...

I think one of the scenes in the DC cut is actually longer.... but the rest are more rapid and shorter....

Watching them side by side makes one wonder ""Why?""... Not really comprehending the reasons for eithers types of cuts.... lol"
