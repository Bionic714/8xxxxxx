,desade1919,2013-03-01T10:18Z,"For two days now, I am stuck with ""Downloading metadata"". In other words, I can't get the filelist of the torrent so I can start downloading. I am using utorrent 3.2.3 abd I've never had this problem before with PirateBay. Judging from the lack of comments, no-one else has a problem. Is it possible for anyone to upload the torrent file? 

Thank you. 

Oh, btw, regardless of the problem I'm facing, great job chkm8te! Your torrents are ALWAYS grade-A stuff!!"
