GAME INFORMATION

The fan-favorite 2D brawler is back as ex-mob hit man Shank returns to
action in Shank 2. With those closest to him under attack, Shank is once
again forced on the offensive. Now he must put his trusty arsenal of
handguns, shotguns, automatic weapons, chainsaws, machetes, grenades, plus
all-new weaponry and moves to use in order to protect those close to him.
The original game set a new standard for its visual style and Shank 2
raises the bar. Shank 2 expands on the original games amazing combat
system to redefine the 2D side-scrolling brawler
