Description:
------------
From the imagination of Tim Schafer and Double Fine Productions comes Brutal Legend, an action game in the third person, rich in combat, and picture frame that provides endless entertainment.
One of the most original and innovative recent years. BL tells the story of Eddie Riggs member of a band. Eddie is the first person everyone calls when they need guitars tuned. Risk lover and a photographic memory for all album covers of Heavy Metal and letters containing those albums. One night Eddie has an accident on stage and falls unconscious.
With blood streaming down on the belt buckle he wears, a gift from his father, a fighter character and yet oddly familiar, a world where every Heavy Metal cover and lyrics come to life, a world where evil emperor and Doviculus and demonic army, "The Tainted Coil", have enslaved the human past. Led by Lars Halford alongside his sister Lita and the mysterious Ophelia, the human resistance is by no means helpless.
Anyway, no one who can organize and lead them into battle, who need it to Eddie. Under his command, returned the old world to the world of Metal.
