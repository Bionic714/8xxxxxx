At ease, Comrade unnamed Marine. You already know, why are there? Right. We have to save the world from enslavement. Someone has to do it, and best of all save the world in this nameless Marines.
The enemy is cunning and crafty: can attack not only sideways, backwards, but it was yesterday. We surely can give it to a nozzle in the present, and if he believes that beat us in the past, it will be easier - will have to convince him cruelly. Pall military bases and space stations? To walk through the medieval tombs and ancient tombs with a shotgun on the edge - an enviable fate ... At whatever age or invaded invader - be prepared to fight back.
And yes, about the time paradoxes - hammer. Good luck, soldier!
And briefly to the editorial - a toy, not very popular, but is able to give yourself a light quake: entourage, detailed enemies, interactive dismemberment, great animation and excellent schedule.
