,XxCmonxX,2013-02-27T14:14Z,lol how does this contain the previous update while its smaller in size @.@ and also no info about what does it change @.@
[V],HeroMaster,2013-02-27T14:48Z,"@XxCmonxX Only GhostNet could answer that question, well other you can try it yourself."
,Machine4578,2013-02-27T15:28Z,"@XxCmonxX 

this is an xdelta patch which is why its small...
you cant use this if you installed RLD's update 1 patch either.. the game files must be from v1.0!!
here is the changelog(by using google which you could have done yourself!!) from the steam webpage...


**2/26/13 Patch**
We have released another patch to the game. We have a lot of big fixes:

Major Fixes

* IMPORTANT NOTE: 60Hz sim is now “opt in” not “opt out”. If you have a fast computer and can handle the 60 fps sim, please just turn it on in Brutal Legends Options!
* Fixes to performance/lag on computers with slower CPUs.
* HiFi Sim (i.e. simulate at 60 fps) now off by default. Users can enable it, but may see some jitter until we fix a couple more bugs. 
* Fixes to some options not saving/loading correctly.
* Fix for oceans sometimes not rendering on AMD GPUs.
* Missing cutscene at end of intro bridge plays properly again.
* Mission beacon now appears appropriately throughout game.
* Fixes to some car physics when Hi Fi Sim is on."

Because this patch is made using xdelta which unlike Reloaded patch does not replace existing files with updated files but only updates the existing files with when u run the bat file thats why the update size is small just like the ones i uploaded for sleeping dogs "
,badjhonsen,2013-02-27T16:52Z,ur the man works perfect now no more gay ass lag in the main world. now i can finally play this awesome unique game.
,Whickerx7,2013-02-27T18:15Z,after patch it wont go past the doublefine spash screen might be my antivirus though
,bladeks66,2013-02-27T18:39Z,does this mean that update 1 and 2 are the same just update 2 has less MB ?
,XxCmonxX,2013-02-27T20:25Z,thanks everyone who answered. love u guys
[V],Gh0stNet,2013-02-28T09:56Z,Get update 3 from here http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8202196/Brutal.Legend.Update.3-P2P
,Stefanovics,2013-02-28T23:00Z,"sorry but saving not worked with this and the next update either, after i saved and returned to the main menu it loaded back BUT if i exited the game and reloaded it it wont find any save.
so i stick with the only working save update the
Brutal.Legend.Update.1-RELOADED"
,Sarg338,2013-03-01T01:35Z,"Doesn't work for me. I copy the folder into the Game folder, rub the .bat, and it gives me a bunch of errors about not being able to find files. Afterwards, the files disappear (I'm assuming they were moved), I copy the folders into the Game folder and overwrite, and the game is stuck at the Double Fine logo.

Any ideas?"
