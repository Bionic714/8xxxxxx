Here's 3 hours of Rage captured from VHS of This is Serious Mums Humphrey B Flaubert and Ron Hitler-Barassi Guest Programming rage. Most of their song choices are downright humorous (Hot Potato by the Wiggles being a highlight) and some being downright painful (3 Milli Vanilli songs in a row, blech) and 1 15 minute Brian Eno docco to start things off.

I don't know if this is the whole host session, but it's probably the most complete version out there. and ABC's Rage archives don't go back to 95 so I can't check, but please enjoy the next 3 hours!
