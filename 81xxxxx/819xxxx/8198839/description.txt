Microsensors and MEMS (micro-electro-mechanical systems) are revolutionising the semiconductor industry. A microsystem or the so-called "system-on-a-chip" combines microelectronic circuitry with microsensors and microactuators. This emergent field has seen the development of applications ranging from the electronic nose and intelligent ear to micro-tweezers and the modern ink-jet nozzle.
