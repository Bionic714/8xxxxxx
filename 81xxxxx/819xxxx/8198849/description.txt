KeyScrambler Features
Smart Engineering Keeps Ahead of the Bad Guys.

KeyScrambler adopts an effective preventive approach to protecting the user's private information by encrypting user keystrokes in real time deep in the operating system. Harnessing the power of state-of-the-art cryptography, KeyScrambler has proven to defeat both known and unknown keyloggers, even on security compromised computers.
Small Footprint; Vast Protective Range.

KeyScrambler (file size ~1.4 MB) takes very little resources to run and requires no user effort. And yet it protects 29 browsers and up to 170+ applications against keylogging. KeyScrambler (the Premium edition) also encrypts the user's login credentials in Windows workstation, Active Directory Domain, Windows VistaΓÇÖs User Account Control prompts (UAC), and all of the Windows Store (Metro) Apps. It effectively cuts down on system-wide data breaches and network intrusion.
	
Transparent Protection Gives the User Reassurance.

Once you downloaded and installed KeyScrambler, an unobtrusive green overlay window appears on your computer screen. Here you can see the ongoing encryption so you know how and when KeyScrambler is working. It gives you peace of mind.
Broad Compatibility; Unique Position of Defense.

KeyScrambler works seamlessly with most security programs and authentication methods such as tokens and smart cards. Because the detect-and-remove method of traditional anti-virus, anti-malware programs is still unable to effectively deal with new, unknown malware, KeyScrambler's capability to effectively foil attacks by new, unknown keylogging malware makes it an invaluable tool for online information security.
