,SWSTDWP,2013-03-22T01:02Z,"This has been asked many times to no answer but, what is the ""game dir"" that the SteamApps folder full of .gcf files is meant to go in. I have my own GCFs for portal and HL2E1 that i put in the steamapps folder but they won't show up in GMOD."
,willi3012,2013-03-22T20:22Z,"i downloaded the game and it works great but how do you play online?? when i try to join one of the servers it will always say ""steam validation rejected"" and i dont have steam installed on my computer.can you help me with this problem?"
,willi3012,2013-03-22T20:47Z,oh and one more thing.i also tried on non-steam servers but i get steam validation rejected too.can somebody help me??
[T],bruss.aka.durka9,2013-03-23T22:00Z,"to SWSTDWP
Create in game dir (where hl2.exe placed) directory named ""SteamApps"" and put there all your GCFs. GCFs names must be equal in revApps.ini

to willi3012
To which non-steam servers you are connecting? You can connect to friendly server in main menu (on top)."
[T],bruss.aka.durka9,2013-03-23T22:10Z,"to SWSTDWP
Then you must check/uncheck all available/unavailable GCFs. Like this: http://bayimg.com/bakeNAAEP"
[T],bruss.aka.durka9,2013-03-23T22:19Z,"to SWSTDWP
Or you can just change in rev.ini (in game dir) ""CachePath=./SteamApps"" to ""CachePath="". Example: ""CachePath=D:/Games/Steam/steamapps""."
,T0pAz,2013-03-24T04:05Z,"It doesn't work. Having the same issue ""Steam validation rejected."" and I don't even have Steam."

[T],bruss.aka.durka9,2013-03-24T17:55Z,"to T0pAz
To which server you are connecting? Are you shore he is no-steam?"
,T0pAz,2013-03-24T18:56Z,I'm trying all the servers on TTT and nothing is working.
[T],bruss.aka.durka9,2013-03-24T19:41Z,"to T0pAz
May be it is all steam (licensed) server. You may connect only to no-steam servers."
,T0pAz,2013-03-24T21:07Z,There is only 1 cracked server and there are no players. This torrent is pointless.
[T],bruss.aka.durka9,2013-03-24T21:49Z,"to T0pAz
Delete this and use others."
,willi3012,2013-03-27T01:03Z,"to T0pAz

[T],bruss.aka.durka9,2013-04-15T01:32Z,"to dakata3693
You must manually download and install additional content from other games (ex. TF2, Portal 2 and etc). Try this: http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7506493 but he's very outdated (some or all *.gcf may not work).
