It's the official soundtrack of the game Praetorians.Strategy fans must check out the game(already uploaded to tpb), in my opinion the best mixture of rts and rtt games available despite the fact that it's old.Anyway, the songs have been ripped at CBR 320kbps as mp3s with dbpoweramp r14.4,encoder was Fraunhofer IIS v4.0.3,audio sample size is 16bit,
audio sample rate is 44.1 khz of course.Album art is inluded, ID Tag [ID3v2.3],AccurateRip verified.

As far as I know this is the highest quality mp3 rip you can achieve.(In my opinion FHG does better than lame for this particular soundtrack,also with a slightly smaller size for every song!)


 Plzz help me in this one guys I would be seeding mostly from Tuesdays to Wednesdays and  weekends.
