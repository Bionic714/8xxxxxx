[T],MrDowntown,2013-02-27T16:42Z,"I liked the scene with he and Dick, other than that, yes, like the entire run of this 'critically acclaimed' series, its a jumbled mess of crap. The fact that DC has made it continuity is infuriating.

I know that it will be undone soon enough, but I am still annoyed by it, quite a bit."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-02-28T01:25Z,that scene is touching. glad they at least gave that nod to their B & R team.
