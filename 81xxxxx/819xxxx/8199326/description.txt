"Seduzir" is one of the the most lovely, authentic, and musically satisfying Brasilian jazz/pop albums of it's era (and possibly 'OF ALL TIMES') and is a cd which represents a true Classic. Yes, the word is overused, but here it really applies. Enjoy listening to a unique performer at the very top of his game - accompanied by Brasilian musicians from the top drawer -"Seduzir" contains some arrangements so wrenching and achingly beautiful you'd think they were made in heaven... Faltando Um Padaco I consider to be a masterpiece. One of the two copies I purchased was given as a wedding gift to a couple just married this past weekend. Whether you are in love now or recently had a break-up or experienced a dump-fest, this record will not make you feel cornier and more left out. This music uplifts one as a member of the human race, even if you have little or no idea of the Portuguese language lyrics.
