,ikhor,2013-03-15T03:18Z,this update fucks the game!! uplay stars and cant login
,truenoob,2013-04-11T22:07Z,If uou have problems with logging in after updating to 1.7 you must copy content of skidrow folder from 1.6 update to the game dir. After that you got working 1.7 version. 
,shaddyz,2013-04-25T13:46Z,"If i got v1.6 can i update to this directly? As always, good job Stifmeister."
,shaddyz,2013-04-25T14:40Z,"I updated to 1.7 and when i try log in with SKIDROW as username and a 7 character password it says ""If this is your first time using Uplay on this computer you need to log in online at﻿ least once before using offline mode."" - How do I bypass this? "
