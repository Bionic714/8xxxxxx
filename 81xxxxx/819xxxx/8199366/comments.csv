[V],STFmaryville,2013-02-27T17:45Z,"LOL yes I'm sorry my friend, I didn't see yours until it was too late. Oh well this is from Empire, at least.

I haven't been reading this or any of his Batman since Quitely was with him on Batman & Robin. I'm a pretty big fan of his work, but if you say it sucks, I suspect it probably does."

[T],MrDowntown,2013-02-27T20:56Z,"Well every review, says that this series is amazing, every time I read it I think Im having a stroke. The characters and plot points popping in and out, I never have a clue whats going on. I dont know why I read it ...? No reason any longer."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-02-27T21:11Z,"oh it feels like that every issue? i thought it was just 'cause i didn't read the first 7 !!! lol well i guess this is going to need further review thanks to past torrents, of course ..."
,ImmaDLStf,2013-02-28T00:34Z,"I haven't given this series much thought. I'm really overloaded when it comes to Batman works. I'm reading Batman, Nightwing and Batgirl, and I'm trying to revisit Batman and Robin. The only reason I gave this series a second thought was because I heard rumors that Cassandra Cain (my favourite Batgirl and a big reason as to why I hate the reboot) would be reintroduced here.
Of course, I'm confused as to when this even takes place, or if it even takes place in the same universe as the other books.
All that said, the implication that Robin will die really makes me want to read, so good job marketing team."
