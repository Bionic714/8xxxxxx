Was looking for Ben Howard songs (more than Great) and came across one of his examples I missed. So I listened (and yes I am ashamed I totally missed him).

Some Real old-school Folk and mostly poor recordings. However you can hear why he is an example for many promising singer song writers. So I selected - maybe not the best songs ΓÇô but most certainly 30 of his best tracks. Ideal if you do not know John and quite pleasant if you just want to enjoy his music.

The best albums I found and I recommend are: On The Cobbles and The Church With One Bell. They sound quite good as well.

Enjoy,
