,naumi,2013-02-27T18:45Z,yes!!!!! iam waitin for ur upload thnks 
,larryrube,2013-02-27T18:54Z,"So, I'm a little confused by the description. It's for 4.30 but it's not working on 4.30? Only 4.21? I know this up has only been posted for a half hour, but if you get it working please comment on results! I'm stuck at work all day, so I can't test until later. Thank you and thanks to thenoobish!"
,Cyph3r19,2013-02-27T20:07Z,"Read the note again, they didn't say it DIDN'T work only that their testers reported it as such.

If anything, there are more than DUPLEX who will figure it out (we all love DUPLEX :O) to get it working even on 3.55.

tl:dr wait a day or 2 and read comments to know if it is actually working on 4.30

Thanks thenoobish"
[V],thenoobish,2013-02-27T20:15Z,It does work perfectly on 4.30. The only thing you have to do is set the bdmirror on and press setting permission.
,larryrube,2013-02-27T21:09Z,Thanks for the update. Didn't mean to start a debate over semantics.
,flaviud,2013-02-27T21:10Z,"thenoobish, you're great man! :)"

,Sayroni,2013-02-28T18:20Z,"you can delete language files to save room. (spanish,french,italian,germen,dutch)

delete:
BIGFILE_DUTCH.000.tiger - BIGFILE_FRENCH.000.tiger - BIGFILE_GERMAN.000.tiger -BIGFILE_ITALIAN.000.tiger - BIGFILE_PORTUGUESE.000.tiger -BIGFILE_SPANISH.000.tiger
also go to usrdir -movies - delete french,spanish,germen,italian files

u have now reduced from a 13GB game file to a 6.51 game file.
(saved somewhat 7GB)
thats it, enjoy."
,Cyph3r19,2013-02-28T23:50Z,"@larryrube, i wasn't trying to debate either :). Sorry if i sounded harsh. Respect.

Thanks for the info on reducing game size, will help speed the download up (not speed heh)."
,shais,2013-03-01T00:02Z,"Hi, how do I actually play this on my ps3? Do I download from the ps3 or from the computer and somehow burn it onto a disc and pop that into the ps3. I AM COMPLETELY NEW to this and would appreciate any help. Thanks!"
,Mike2442,2013-03-01T00:36Z,Does anyone know where i can find the PC version?

just horrible."
,varenax,2013-03-01T11:11Z,"-For those who are struggling to get TOMB RAIDER to work on Rogero 4.30 [build 2.05] follow the below:

Very Important #1: First of all make sure you have MultiMan above 4.18.02+ ( im using 4.20.01 )
Very Important #2: You should have a game disc inserted in Bluray Drive as this game won't work discless

Step #1: Copy game to INTERNAL [Tested] or EXTERNAL [Not Tested!] Via FTP
  *Step #2 to #6 through MultiMan
Step #2: Run MultiMan
Step #3: Refresh the list in MultiMan
Step #4: Select game options then select FIX PERMISSIONS (It may take a few seconds or minutes, so be patient)
Step #5: In game setting, select BD-MIRROR and INTERNAL -or EXTERNAL [Step #1]-
Step #6: Load game from MultiMan
  -In this step [first load] MultiMan will ask you to fix the boot, you have to confirm that (It may take a few seconds or minutes, so be patient).
Step #7: Run game from Bluray Drive in XMB

All credit goes to: Rogero for CFW, Deank for MultiMan, Duplex for Game AND ray0"
,pdscoelho,2013-03-01T11:23Z,"Game runs fine, press square and tick bd-mirror option!"

,_-ghost-_,2013-03-01T17:33Z,"i am on 3.55 and i have the fix but im having some trouble. after the first intro the game stays on black screen and nothing happens, any ideas ??!!"
,navin00o,2013-03-02T07:29Z,SEED GUYS..
,torrenter0007,2013-03-03T03:02Z,hey any1 know why some torrents are different sizes even though they're the same game? and sometimes there are two identical games on PS3 and Xbox360 but one of them is bigger than the other...why is that? :S
,jmuckey2,2013-03-03T05:06Z,you don't have to do anything special all you have to do is if you want to make the file size smaller take out all the other files that don't say your respective language and then transfer to multiman via usb or ftp and then let it patch the param and run as normal from the internal hdd i am using rebug firmware 430 standalone 
,x3angel,2013-03-03T20:44Z,*Important* this game has 4GB+ files -if you have the space on your internal HDD fine - if not FTP game into your internal hd00/GAME folder then use Multiman to transfer it to your external HDD - Multiman will automatically split the 4GB file so that it can be played externally. Then you can delete the internal version of the Game. Play the game with a games disc inside using BD Mirror enabled/With Disc & test Permissions & it'll work
,oudi1988,2013-03-04T00:30Z,  thank it works 100% on rogero 4.30 
,hbright84,2013-03-04T01:25Z,There is a game breaking glitch late in the story. This is happening on both consoles PS3 and Xbox. On the boat later in the story you have to move a crate to fall below the boat. The crate freezes and you cannot proceed. There is a day 1 fix aval but it does nothing.
