    to continue to write/publish brilliant pieces of literature, whether its    
    physical or digital.                                                        
                                                                                
    We dont release these good books for people to get away with paying for     
    them more a try before you buy, as we ourselves buy the books that we       
    like.                                                                       
                                                                                
    We have NOTHING to do with the distribution of our releases on ANY form of  
    website or infected filesharing networks, unfortunatly its others that do   
    this, but only to our dismay. We Apologise for their inept behaviour, as    
    this IS/WAS never our intention for this to happen, to your work.           
                                                                                
    We are just a group of humble people sharing the power of knowledge in a    
    digital format with preservation for the future in mind.
