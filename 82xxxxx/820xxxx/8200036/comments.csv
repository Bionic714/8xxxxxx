,viwp88,2013-03-16T02:34Z,"The game is on sale right on Steam. If you liked the game then you should buy it. Its only $13 at the moment because steam is having an Ubisoft weekend(ending March 18th). The deluxe gold edition has all the dlc. Thanks for this upload, I enjoyed it and just bought the game on steam myself."
,fbk420,2013-03-23T16:46Z,"Would love to buy this game, but I refuse to pay Ubisoft one cent until they ditch their drm.  If you want to see a change in the favor of the player from these companies you cannot reward them for their behavior."

,tuchaczewsky,2013-04-05T07:33Z," TO ALL WHO WANT TO PLAY WITH SAVES IN DLC (Chronicles of Tandria in this case)

As we know, when you play any of the missions from Chronicles of Tandria (where real fun begin, by the way) you can save but saves are then locked as a DLC content and nothing can be done. There is simple solution that I found by chance.

WHEN YOU PLAY A MISSION SAVE BY QUICK SAVE (default: F5), THEN WHEN YOU WANT TO LOAD, JUST USE QUICK LOAD ON KEYBOARD (default: holding ctrl + F5).
It must be done during the game because in the Main Menu quick save position is still locked but using quick load during game works just fine. You can save, leave the game, then comeback, start any mission and quick load your last save. Everything works just fine, no ""locked"" features anymore.

It's only a one slot for a save but still, you can actually play DLC, without fear that one mistake and 6 hour long game is nothing. Just have to be extra careful when to save."
