However, because my ISP has no non-gateway DOCSIS 3 modems yet, I'm limited to 64Kbps up instead of the 512 I'm paying for (unless I'm willing to pay double the monthly modem rental and throw out my good, working router and use their self-branded, defective, buggy piece of junk--which of course I am not)."
,mwalsher,2013-02-27T21:06Z,"Wow, the tracker is reporting 18 seeds already, which is miraculous considering that I have only uploaded 190/338MB so far. o.O"

I don't know... it is showing 70+ seeds, but then I don't think stats are accurate since it showed 18 seeds before the full file had been transferred."
,mwalsher,2013-02-28T01:37Z,"It looks like I stopped a little early and a few pieces had not spread yet.

(I don't know why the seed/peer numbers are so inaccurate or why the torrent client/tracker would indicate that there are seeds before there actually are any other complete sources.)

Anyway, I opened it up again and the remaining pieces are now available and being spread, so the number of complete sources is going through the roof already. :-)"
