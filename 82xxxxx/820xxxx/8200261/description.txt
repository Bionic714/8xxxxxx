This is the modified Gateway FX P-7805u BIOS. It is based off of the original version of the bios 9C.23. It has been modified to be able to disable EIST [speedstep technology] therefore allowing you to OC the CPU using throttlestep in windows.


Flash it with phlash16 in DOS
Change the bios setting to disable speedstep
Use throttlestop to disable EIST in windows thus allowing you to overclock


Enjoy!


Note: Flashing a bios wrong will ruin your computer, use this at your own risk.

Worked fine on my Gateway FX P-7807u. Went from 2.55 ghz stock to 2.66 ghz OC.
