CHANGE the contents of a folder


This is for Samsung Galaxy S3 and others with 1280x720 resolution. 


1. Open data.zip in winzip or another program that can handle zip-files.
2. Locate the ui_android folder and open multimode.ini.
3. Change text to:

[modes]
; mx=WidthMin..WidthMax, HeightMin..HeightMax,Folder
; OR
; mx=Width, Height ,Folder

m3=1280..1280,552..800,""800_480""
m4=720..800,976..1280,""800_480""
m5=1024..1280,552..800,""1024_768""
m6=600..800,976..1280,""1024_768""

4. Save and check that all went well.
5. Move the data.zip file back to the iGO map in the phone."
