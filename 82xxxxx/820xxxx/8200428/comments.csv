,binderguy1,2013-02-28T03:34Z,"I wanted to thank you for ul-ing this torrent, as I committed sacrilege.  I'd forgotten all about this volume of the LOTEG, and I am a Alan Moore fan.

I see a whole lot of ul torrents from you and wonder if you run or work in a comic shop?

If you do, can you see if FAUST # 13, and the related mini-series/one-shots is available?"
,jennysparks,2013-02-28T09:21Z,Fantastic!  Thanks STFmaryville.
[V],STFmaryville,2013-02-28T14:55Z,"binderguy1, i worked in comic shops in my misspent youth but i prefer to have a profitable job. i don't have any faust on hand but i can come up with it. do you just want 13, or 1-15? not sure about the spin-offs."
,GP67,2013-02-28T15:44Z,thanks
,binderguy1,2013-03-01T00:11Z,"I'm sure some folks 'round here wouldn't mind a complete run of a FAUST torrent.  I can always get the missing issue(s) to complete the ones I don't have.  ;-)

As for the spin-offs, maybe someone can help out.

Is the Nemo a one-shot or a mini-series?"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-01T20:30Z,"I think it's a one-shot graphic novel.

As ""The Black Dossier"" came out between Volumes 2 and 3 of TLoEG, perhaps in a year or two they'll be doing Volume 4 as a miniseries."
