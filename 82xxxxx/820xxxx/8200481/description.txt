Notes: I'm drunk right now, wbu?
This does have CAM audio before anybody asks! Pretty god damn sure we
won't see any LiNE for this, doubt we'll get any full audio up until retail drops
either. First 5 minutes of the release are Russian dubbed. (You can still clearly
hear the English audio in the background over the Russian audio though). After
credits scene is also in Russian. Audio is a little meh, some of you won't mind
it, some of you will hate it and some of you will bitch about it. Not our best
release but we simply have no time and we just had to put this out there.

On a personal note: saw this at the cinema, I reccommend you watch it under the
influence of a heavy amount of your favourite drug/alcohoic beverage. You may
understand it that way...

We wish we could release more often, but we simply can't. We love you all. &lt;3
