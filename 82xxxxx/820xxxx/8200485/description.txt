During the mid to late 60's, the Shanes were one of the most popular bands in Sweden along with the Hep Stars, the Tages, and Ola & The Janglers. At the beginning of 1965, the Shanes got their big break when they toured all over Sweden, and were chased by hysterical fans. 

In the Spring of 67, 4 members of the Shanes were drafted to the Swedish military. A year later, after their service, the Shanes found music to be a lot different. This lead to the breaking up of the Shanes.
