Notes: I'm drunk right now, wbu?

(READNFO) - This does have CAM audio before anybody asks! Pretty god damn sure we won't
see any LiNE for this, doubt we'll get any full audio up until retail drops either.
&gt; First 5 minutes of the release are Russian dubbed. (You can still clearly hear the English 
audio in the background over the Russian audio though). After credits scene is also in
Russian. Audio is a little meh, some of you won't mind it, some of you will hate it and some 
of you will bitch about it. Not our best release but we simply have no time and we just 
had to put this out there.

On a personal note; saw this at the cinema, I reccommend you watch it under the influence of
a heavy amount of your favourite drug/alcohoic beverage. You may understand it that way...

We wish we could release more often, but we simply can't. We love you all. 

Greetz: To everybody keeping things alive.
