Going to try and start doing more uploads like this. Certain short stories from anthologies such as Dark Horse Presents,2000 AD,Creepy Comics,etc. I've noticed sometimes It's easier to read a story on it's own especially if you want to save just that particular one and not the whole anthology. Going to try and start with compiling arcs/runs from Dark Horse Presents since the relaunch (at least ones that haven't already been released as one shots such as Neighborhood Watch and Resident Alien). Requests are welcome. 

Sound off in the comments on torrent quality. Would be much appreciated as it is my first upload. Thanks a bunch.

As always, if you like it, but it.
