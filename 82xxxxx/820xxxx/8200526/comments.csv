They are airing Mammary Lane but the specials will take longer to show up.  I use Howard's vacation time as my own break from this stuff.  But they'll still go up eventually.

Thanks."

And the AGT shit -- I skip right thru it when he starts talking about it anyway. Thanks to you, it's pretty easy to do now. 

So take your time, man. You deserve it!"

Thanks again wushdishmeen!!!!!!"
