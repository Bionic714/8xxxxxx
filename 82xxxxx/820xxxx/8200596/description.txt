Notes:


Please note that my bitrates and file sizes are optimized for those who store and watch movies on their computers. The bitrates are high enough to look perfect on "normal" sized monitors and low enough to keep download times short and the file size small enough for those who don't have a ton of free hard drive space to waste. If you plan on watching something on a large HD screen, you're going to need one of the larger file size, higher bitrate torrents. The larger the screen you'll be watching on, the higher the bitrate has to be to maintain picture quality. If you have a large screen, you'll need to experiment too see what bitrate it takes to maintain a quality picture for your particular size screen.

The only other torrent of this movie in 1080p is a whopping 14gigs. Another more reasonable file sized version is desperately needed, so please seed for as long as possible, preferably until reaching a share ratio of at least 3:1.
