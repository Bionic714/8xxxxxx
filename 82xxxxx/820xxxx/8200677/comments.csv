,60FPSguy,2013-02-28T22:37Z,"Well, it's a kind of ""upscalling"". I converted the original video, by extrapollating the missing frames. And here is the result. Tried it with various videos, such as anime, LOTR (I got the same feeling than viewing The Hobbit in HFR), Stargate SG1 and more, and I find the result amazing. Since we can't all afford expensive television, I'm doing these conversions. I Hope you enjoy them."
