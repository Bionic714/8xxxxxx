Story about the last days of an epoch, in Europe's history known as "Belle Epoque" -- time of turbulent events in the Balkans, and plotting of the assassination in Sarajevo, between 1910 and 1914. Basic historic facts were used as a background for shaping this "dramatic comedy" about the epoch from the turn of the century, which is in many ways a negative image of our times, from the end of the same century. This colorful and humorous film about an unusual time, offers the viewer excitement, joy and true cinema fun.
