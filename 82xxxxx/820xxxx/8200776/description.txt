We forget our passwords. We pay too much to go to the gym. We think weΓÇÖd be happier if we lived in California (we wouldnΓÇÖt), and we think we should stick with our first answer on tests (we shouldnΓÇÖt). Why do we make mistakes? And could we do a little better? 

We human beings have design flaws. Our eyes play tricks on us, our stories change in the retelling, and most of us are fairly sure weΓÇÖre way above average. In Why We Make Mistakes, journalist Joseph T. Hallinan sets out to explore the captivating science of human errorΓÇöhow we think, see, remember, and forget, and how this sets us up for wholly irresistible mistakes.

In his quest to understand our imperfections, Hallinan delves into psychology, neuroscience, and economics, with forays into aviation, consumer behavior, geography, football, stock picking, and more. He discovers that some of the same qualities that make us efficient also make us error prone. We learn to move rapidly through the world, quickly recognizing patternsΓÇöbut overlooking details. Which is why thirteen-year-old boys discover errors that NASA scientists missΓÇöand why you canΓÇÖt find the beer in your refrigerator.

Why We Make Mistakes is enlivened by real-life storiesΓÇöof weathermen whose predictions are uncannily accurate and a witness who sent an innocent man to jailΓÇöand offers valuable advice, such as how to remember where youΓÇÖve hidden something important. YouΓÇÖll learn why multitasking is a bad idea, why men make errors women donΓÇÖt, and why most people think San Diego is west of Reno (itΓÇÖs not).

 Why We Make Mistakes will open your eyes to the reasons behind your mistakesΓÇöand have you vowing to do better the next time
