Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site :: On the Wednesday, February 27 transmission of the Alex Jones Show, Alex breaks down the release of 10,000 illegal aliens from detention centers in response to sequestration budget cuts and the hypocrisy of constructing new detention centers for the same purpose. Alex also analyzes New York's 7-round firearm magazine restriction which effectively bans all semi-automatic firearms as there are few mags that hold less than ten bullets. 

On today's show, Alex welcomes "America's liberty belle" Dr. Katherine Albrecht to discuss the imminent threats to our digital and personal privacy and ways to overcome warrantless government spying.
