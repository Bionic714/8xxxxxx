In this episode we meetup with Edward again, former bootcamp student, to go over ΓÇ£success barriers.ΓÇ¥ A success barrier is an internal switch that turns on when you go from 'being a boss' to reverting back to your old habits. To stress this from not happening, it is crucial you learn to i) record yourself, ii) recognize your mistakes but keep pushing yourself to recover, and iii) motivate yourself by re-living your 'boss' moments in your head.
