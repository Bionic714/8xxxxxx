"DAUGHTERS OF STONE," Conclusion
As arc two draws to a close the Queen declares war on her homeland, and things thought long buried return to haunt her. In KOL the true purpose of Giselle's mission is revealed, and both sides realize too late that the power of Gottfaust's stone is not so easily tamed.
