This was the last film of Elio Petri, a wonderful satirist who used the techniques of slapstick to make devastating critiques of the "system". His masterpiece is Investigation of a Citizen above Suspicion, which won an Oscar in 1970; Buone Notizie can therefore be considered the last gasp of radical Italian cinema.

The wild plot begins with a power cut, and ends when opening a forbidden letter precipitates some unexplained crisis. We are left just as confused as the befuddled victim, which was probably the intention.

After this, Italian cinema sank into bland feel-good stuff - I now look to South Korea and Iran to keep me awake.
