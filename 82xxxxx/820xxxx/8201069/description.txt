This is the updated list I made from last year.  It contains everything I could find single-wise off of random albums, and the internet.  Not again it's not everything.  But I think it's a good representation of music and audio for the Halloween season.  It has a few sound effects and random radio commercials (all fake of course) that I either found or made.  I also scoured the net and got as many halloween tracks from the Dr. Demento show as I could.  That collection spans 40 years and I grabbed it single by single.  It's all in one folder sorry folks I was lazy.  I tagged as much as I could get tagged, however some songs literally don't have albums, and some songs I don't know the year.  I think that's all.  I hope you all enjoy this. 

The majority of songs is in 

128 KBPS 44.1 Stereo  however some files are a higher bitrate.
