,Greenhoood,2013-02-28T02:56Z,Do anyone think they will upload the hobbit in 48fps? 
,eminemd12,2013-02-28T03:40Z,"is there an extended version, cuz lets be honest 3 hours is not enough for the middle earth series"
,jimaa66,2013-02-28T03:56Z,Appreciate it Bozx! And I'm sure 720 will be great...

Why wouldnt a computer play it, computers can output 60fps - 120fps for games, video/movies is the same thing! Dumbass"

there are two more hobbit films coming."
[T],SCSA420,2013-02-28T06:20Z,Fuck it I'm NOT waiting............... I'll end up getting the 1080p 48fps BluRay version if and when it comes out at the store just like I did for the Avatar 3D BluRay as I already got a Bad Ass 55 inch LG 3D LED Smart Tv to watch it on. Thanks BOZX!!!
,Sarom,2013-02-28T06:22Z,"@sharkcutter:
Projector? Any PC monitor AND HDTV can support up to 60fps, the 3DTVs can up to 120fps... Ohh and the DVDs run at 29fps.

Remember when gaming hardware reviews always mention how many frames can display the newest graphic card? If the tv or monitor couldn't display more than 24fps, then why the need of xbox or ps3 to display games at 60fps?. Oh yeah and many HDcamcorders can record at 60fps AND you can see the video running at 60fps in the tiny screen of the camcorder.

A movie in 48fps 1080p will be obviously more CPU demanding than any standard 24fps movie.

Conclusion: Don't be pussies..."
,brucey886,2013-02-28T06:26Z,"@geezer32 
Actually most tvs can play 48fps! its just the devices attached to them cant. Eg blu-ray player, dvd-player and etc. 

How do you think you can play videos games at such high frames per second? If you use a media centre PC there should be no problem playing at 48fps. "
,Sarom,2013-02-28T06:31Z,"@sharkcutter and Geezer32
Don't be pussies...
Any PC monitor and HDTV can display up to 60fps. Remember the xbox or ps3 games? they are running at 40 and 60fps. The old DVDs run at 29fps, most HD camcorders can record at 60fps. That's why your homemade gay porn videos run smoother than those you see in youporn. The 3DTVs can display up to 120fps...

More proofs? Edit any 24fps video to run at 48fps, the video obviously will run faster but you will see a more fluid or smooth movement; Now that's how a 48fps movie should look: More fluid and with more detail in action or high movement scenes.

Any HDTV or PC monitor can easly display this movie at 48fps. (But as far as i know, the 48fps version is 3D, so, you will need a 3DTV to watch it correctly)."
,pro346pro,2013-02-28T06:35Z,if people are waiting for 48fps youll be waiting along time only 24fps will be released to home market

,poijhbn,2013-02-28T14:55Z,"BLU-RAY DOES NOT SUPPORT 48FPS. THE ONLY CHANCE OF A 48FPS RELEASE IS THROUGH DIGITAL DISTRUBUTION, LIKE ITUNES."
,ikia,2013-02-28T16:01Z,Where can i find some movie with 48fps? to try to play it on my Xtreamer Ultra with openelec and Samsung 55'' 3D TV :D
,sharkcutter,2013-02-28T17:30Z,"There's no need to get offensive guys, but I don't think you really get what Jackson has done here. He has re-written cinema standards. Very few IMAX theaters could even run the film at the intended 48 fps. Roughly speaking each image is 4mb, 4 x 48 x 2 = 384 (it's in 3D so each eye needs it's own image) That means 384 mb per sec to to processed and be thrown onto a 4k screen. Of course 48 fps looks much better, but only if every thing else, ie image resolution remains the same. Now your computer says it can run different frame rates, sure, but not at full rez, think about it, something has to give. You want to download what a 10 gb file? You can't have 48 fps, 1080p at that size without major compression. You will get a better copy running 24 fps than 48 fps with the resulting compression to each frame. Ultimately you cannot expect the same quality as IMAX from a downloaded ripped bluRay. Enjoy the movie, however you get to see it."
,formfactor,2013-02-28T18:08Z,"To all who want a 48fps release, its not likely to happen from a blue ray source due to the fact that blue ray does not support 48fps...  blue ray players likely wont have the processing power to decode 48fps.  Its hard to say if we will see a web version (itunes) since those tooo are unlikely to posess the power to decode video at 48fps smoothly with current codecs."
,TruWING,2013-02-28T18:15Z,"Very slow to download. Could be the 25,000 leechers.

Can you guys seed please?"
[V],meech,2013-02-28T18:25Z,"I really have no idea if 48fps is doable or not on a p.c.  But it does seem strange that one would be able to view it on a consumer computer when most theaters don't have the ability to display them.  In my area, I wasn't able to watch it in that fps if I wanted to since none of my theaters could support it.

I think sharkcutter has a good point that seems to maek sense.

All that aside, most critic reviewers stated that they didn't like the way 48fps looked overall in this movie.  That's of course subjective, but there did seem to be a general consensus to that.

Like someone said earlier, the important thing is the quality of the story and the way it's told.  The effect are plenty impressive enough at the lower fps."
,HEzooL,2013-02-28T18:39Z,"@sharkcutter Is that the reason this release gets many comments stating it's stuttery/slideshowy? It would explain a lot to me, cause every other bluray movie compressed here still look great."

,Redante,2013-02-28T19:58Z,"I'll wait 48 fps version. Doesn't matter how long.
Once you've seen the HFR video there's no point in going back to crappy 23 fps. Even interpolated to HFR videos looks great. Try yourself http://hfrmovies.com/Avatar_48_fps_Sample.mkv . There are also few extra 60fps examples here http://www.hfrmovies.com/2012/12/30/sample-avatar-clips-at-48-fps-and-60-fps/.
Average PC will play these with no problem. The final size of the movie will be roughly twice as regular 720p rip. So no problems there."

But yes, like others have stated: If bluray discs can't do 48fps, then there probably won't be a 48fps version released..

Although we still all have to wait for the extended version release any way with probably 12 extra seconds of footage, then we can all start the mad rush to download it again and complain how it isn't in 48fps.."

FYI, playing a playstation game at 60 fps is not the same thing as video formats.
Currently most TV's won't accept a native 48P signal without at least a firmware update, but either way it will NEVER come on BR disc at the spec for bluray is 24p.
And there are NO commercial TV's with the processing power that can run HFR 3D"
