A regular family - Maria (Naomi Watts), Henry (Ewan McGregor)
and their three kids - travel to Thailand to spend Christmas.
They get an upgrade to a villa on the coastline.
After settling in and exchanging gifts, they go to the pool,
like so many other tourists. A perfect paradise vacation until
a distant noise becomes a roar. There is no time to escape from
the tsunami; Maria and her eldest are swept one way, Henry and
the youngest another. Who will survive, and what will become
of them?
