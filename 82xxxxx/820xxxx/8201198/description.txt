A team of five intrepid young wildlife filmmakers
is based on the magnificent Tswalu Kalahari game
reserve and they venture out from dusk to dawn each
day to follow the Gosa gang, led by alpha-female
Cleo and her mate Gandalf.
Spending a large chunk of the past 25 days with the
Gosa meerkat gang has been a very enjoyable, and at
the same time, fascinating experience. Observing
each individual meerkat go about their daily business
of survival, against the magnificent backdrop of the
Southern Kalahari, has made it impossible for us not
project our human attitudes and emotions onto each of
these little yet, larger than life, characters.
Here follows a brief description of some of the
ten meerkats that make up the Gosa gang based
on our observations thus far.

Meet the Gosa Meerkat Gang.

Cleopatra
The alpha female of the Gosa gang, she is a serene presence.
From the start, she has been totally unfazed by the presence
of the crew and our gear. Her calm demeanour seems to have
rubbed off on most of the other members, enabling us to gain
their trust and film them without interrupting their natural
activities. Sadly, and quite surprisingly, she has been
unable to rear any pups, and it is now clear that her most
recent litter also succumbed. Whether she is a strong enough
character to maintain her status as the alpha female and hold
the gang together remains to be seen. Big challenges lie ahead
for Cleo.
Gandalf
Regally grey in the hair around his face, his status as the
alpha male remains undisputed at this point. He is something
of a workaholic, and takes his job as head of security very
seriously indeed. He is inevitably the one who takes on the
responsibility of sentry duty, risking life and limb to get
as high as possible to scan for both aerial and ground predators.
His motto: “No tree too high, no bush too thorny.”
How he manages to eat enough in between performing his duties,
Iâ™m not quite sure, but he still seems to be in pretty good shape.
Delilah
An extremely nervous, bordering on paranoiac, beta female, she
seems quite distant from the alpha pair. Her slightly larger
than usual belly suggests that, she has either been enjoying
the beetle larvae buffet a little too much, or she has broken
the meerkat gang code and gotten herself pregnant. I suspect
it to be the latter, which could signal serious trouble for
her and the pups down the line.
Dingaan
A prominent beta male in the gang, he is Gandalfâ™s right
hand….um…..meerkat. Equally adept at scaling impossibly
high and flimsy sentry posts, he performs sentry duty when
Gandalf allows himself a breather and a chance to protein-load.
He has exceptional eyesight, but seems to lack a little bit of
judgement as he has often sounded the alarm for something quite
innocuous. It seems that the rest of the gang have mastered
the art of knowing when he is ‘crying wolfâ™. He is a strong
and good-looking meerkat, and no doubt he will have designs on
becoming an alpha male someday. Whether he will have the
gumption to challenge Gandalf, or whether he will choose to
seek greener pastures, only time will tell.
Brutus and Napoleon
Two beta males that, as with Delilah, are not part of the
inner circle of the Gosa gang and that we donâ™t know much
about. We have often noticed them sneaking off, quite
rapidly mind you, from the burrow in the early morning,
resulting in a split in the gang for the dayâ™s foraging.
They do not always spend the night in the same burrow as
the rest of the gang either. It is possible, even likely,
that one of them is responsible for impregnating Delilah.
It will be very interesting to see how it all plays out
should those pups arrive.
Starsky
The youngest member of the gang, he is a real character;
full of life, extremely curious and rather mischievous.
From the start he has shown a keen interest in us and our
various accessories. He seems to have a thing for the old
aqua show curtain and always quite fancies the look of his
reflection in the camera housing. Despite the fact that
he is quite old enough and perfectly capable of finding
his own food, he has somehow managed to convince a few of
the others to hand over their hard-earned grubs every once
in a while. He has also recently discovered the power of
his anal gland, which is used for scent marking, and has
been marking anything he can lift his leg up to, including
the other gang members. The smart money says he will be
the first to perform this display of ownership on the
camera rig or one of the crew. Indeed, it seems that there
are great things written in his stars.
Hutch
Older than Starsky, but not quite at full maturity, he has
displayed a level-headedness beyond his years and is a born
leader. He has not been shy to perform sentry duty when
the other older males have not been around and his
tree-climbing skills are on the up and up. Never shy to
let his hair down, he is also Starskyâ™s sparring partner
when itâ™s time for fun and games at the burrow. He has,
however, also made it clear that he is higher up the chain
of command than Starsky and the two younger females, and
has never hesitated to put any of them in their place should
they ever get a little too cheeky.
