Not sure where you are but it will be the first here tomorrow and it maybe the same for you.
But if you are in the US you will have to wait one day longer
Thanks again for your posts"

,Ez-Pz,2013-02-28T20:32Z,"Thanks a bunch! And speaking for myself, I often try to leave comments for uploaders but very often get ""database error"" messages. More of us are grateful than you know!"
,BroMan90,2013-03-01T01:52Z,"Thanks for all the uploads.  You're the ONLY person kind of us to upload judge judy all the time :)  I'll miss you badly, hope you come back after your vacation :) Have fun!"
,Pendaws,2013-03-02T04:32Z,"Thanks Wingz, I do hope you have a GREAT holiday and come back fresh and rested. If you feel like you want to upload again I am sure that I speak for the rest of us in saying, IT WILL BE APPRECIATED but, you don't have to if it is too much. :)"
,ghdsd,2013-03-06T09:42Z,"Hey wingz - you got me through the flu with JJ, and now I'm doing house arrest w/ an ankle monitor because something happened to that sweet doggie next door, and the police think I had something to do with it!  I can't imagine why they would think that .... So thanks in advance for getting me through the next 4 months; 2 months if I can behave .....   (YES!  I am kidding in case somebody is wondering)"
,snark77,2013-03-07T17:49Z,"I've always wanted to leave a comment, but never figured it out! *facepalm* Now that I have, I wanted to say thank you SOOOO MUCH WINGZ! You're a lifesaver and I hope you come back after your much needed vacation. We love and adore you here! Blessings!"
