"Camping"

The Weavers and the Bird-Kersees unplug for a 
weekend of camping in the great outdoors, as Marty 
tries to prove he's a "manly man" like his dad, 
Dominick. Debbie and Jackie work secretly behind 
the scenes to make the trip a success for an 
oblivious Marty, but all bets are off when both 
families have a close encounter of the animal
kind.

18/Very Slow
Evolve... or die.

Enjoy :)
