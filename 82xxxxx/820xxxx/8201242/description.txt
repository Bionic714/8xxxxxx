Woodpigeon (aka Mark Andrew Hamilton) has announced he will release his fifth full-length album, ΓÇÿThumbtacks and GlueΓÇÖ, on 25th February 2013.

While ΓÇÿThumbtacks and GlueΓÇÖ (released via Fierce Panda in UK & Boompa in US/ Canada) is WoodpigeonΓÇÖs first proper full-length release since 2010 the past few years have been anything but quiet for Mark Andrew Hamilton with the release of the bonus full-length ΓÇÿBalladeerΓÇÖ in 2010 and the tour-only full-length, ΓÇÿDiamondsΓÇÖ coinciding with his recent North American tour supporting Patrick Wolf.

There have been multiple EPs and singles, a move from Calgary, Alberta to Vienna, Austria, tours of Europe with Junip and Andrew Bird, plus a slew of headlining and festival dates. The Observer declared Woodpigeon a ΓÇ£Best New DiscoveryΓÇ¥ in June of this year, while CanadaΓÇÖs Post City Magazine called HamiltonΓÇÖs September Toronto performance ΓÇ£awe-inspiringΓÇ¥, and the Saatchi Gallery awarded Woodpigeon the ΓÇ£New Talent AwardΓÇ¥ at their inaugural ΓÇÿGlittering PrizesΓÇÖ that month.

Woodpigeon continues to refine and expand upon his sound with ΓÇÿThumbtacks & GlueΓÇÖ, recorded in Calgary, Alberta with producer Arran Fisher and mastered by Ryan Morey. Known for his stunning and heart-wrenching orchestral pop, ΓÇÿThumbtacks & GlueΓÇÖ shows off Hamilton at his most diverse, from ΓÇÿChildren Should Be Seen And Not HeardΓÇÖ crunching guitar and ΓÇÿAs Read In The Pine Bluff CommercialΓÇÖ pure pop to the delicacy of ΓÇÿLittle WingsΓÇÖ and the bitter sting of ΓÇÿRobin SongΓÇÖ. This is the sound of a songwriter hitting his stride.
