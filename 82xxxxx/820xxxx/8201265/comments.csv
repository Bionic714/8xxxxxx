#1 Kirby's Devil Dinosaur (own the HC, but haven't found it digital yet)

#2 Doctor Mid-nite 1999 mini series

thanks in advance"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-02-28T14:37Z,"i have dr. mid-nite, just didn't have time to up it on new comics day. should post it today. :-)

a devil dinosaur torrent is a great idea -- but have you read nextwave? it makes me laugh just thinking about it."
,Mothra67,2013-02-28T15:49Z,"Nextwave? no I haven't!  I'll have to check that one out!

and thanks so much for the Dr Mid-Nite!  There was only 1 torrent here for it, it was 3 years old and no one was seeding it!"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-02-28T16:51Z,just f.y.i. if you search for MTCDC you can find almost anything from DC 1938-2011
