,kingashi,2013-02-28T19:10Z,i think its already here....
,tuptohs,2013-02-28T20:02Z,It's already here.  But thanks for the consideration anyway.
,pierce368,2013-03-01T11:39Z,Really? I searched here a bunch of different times b4 posting because i didnt want to double post and couldnt find it. Only thing i saw was music and videos.
,ovracvr,2013-03-19T20:19Z,I downloaded this version 1.20 from here back in November 2012. I feel like kicking my own ass!!!. I compared both and its the same. Please don't post duplicates and argue. such waste of resources!
,potvinsuks,2013-03-21T00:56Z,"ovracvr...Who the hell is arguing?  It was an honest mistake and he apologized.  It's not like it's his only file and you act like it's the end of the world because you had to download again and wasted your precious time.  Also, I dont blame him for not seeing this because it was UP, then DOWN  for a while.  Thanks pierce you're doing a great job!"
,pierce368,2013-03-21T04:57Z,@ovracvr if you already had helsinki 1.20 why would you expect this 1.2 to be any different? I did check b4 uploading under any tag combination possible and nothing came up so it must have been down at the time
