,BoneyX,2013-05-08T10:04Z,"I keep getting the error ""A problem occured while extracting some files. Check available space on your computer and the write priviledges on the destination folder."" using the extractors.

I've tried your CS6, elements premier 11 64bit, elements 11, and elements 10, and got the same error.

I've cleared my temp folder. 

Any idea where it is going wrong and how to get the extractors to work for me?"
