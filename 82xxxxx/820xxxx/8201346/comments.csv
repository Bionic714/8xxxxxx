,Kimberlay,2013-02-28T11:46Z,"Thanks so much for uploading!  I can't say this is my favourite Housewives, but I still like the Housewives format enough to watch it.  And as a Canadian, it's was nice to see the franchise come North :)"
,WuzzlePopple,2013-02-28T15:04Z,"someone is uploading this show on YouTube too. Not sure if it's available in every country, but to look for it on YouTube, search for ""RHOV"". 
thank you for taking the time to upload this though, because like you said, I know you don't like it that much."
,WuzzlePopple,2013-02-28T15:12Z,"BUT then I forget, maybe they downloaded it from you to post it on YouTube. So nevermind me."
,jellie1343,2013-02-28T21:47Z,thx big time for all your downloads....it allows us more time to enjoy our shows ! and if u think jchen9999 is an idiot thats good enough  for me....he should be shot with a ball of his own shit

WuzzlePopple, I am fairly certain the youtuber takes these files and uploads them, but who knows.

S02E05 airs tonight and I will have it up either Wednesday or Thursday.
And even though I've said that.. I bet a certain idiot named jchen9999 is still going to post 'please upload episode 5'."
,jchen9999,2013-03-06T13:36Z,please upload episode 5
[T],duranie,2013-03-06T22:59Z,And the idiot is still an idiot.
