THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW : A PRESERVATION [HD 1080p DTS]

A high-definition preservation of the original version this cult classic, as it was meant to be seen at the time of its release in 1975:

- The opening sequence is presented in black and white up to the "Time Warp", as originally planned during the production of the film. Unlike the bonus feature on the DVD/BR releases, the red color of the "Science Fiction Double Feature" opening number has been preserved.

- The deleted scene with the song "Once In A While" sung by Brad has been restored.

- The original mono soundtrack has been recreated, with the original sound effects intact and with the original vocals by Trevor White on "The Sword Of Damocles" and "Rose Tint My World". The mono mix also includes the alternate version of the ending credits, as once included in the original 1977 home-video release.

- Also included is a new 5.1 mix presented in DTS (audio 2), and a cast commentary with Richard O'Brien and Patricia Quinn (audio 3).
