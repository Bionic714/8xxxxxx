,Legato_Otagel,2013-02-28T14:30Z,The reason why it's so big is the remake of the FMV's and enhancing every location in the game.
,MajoraMan702,2013-03-07T03:37Z,Does this work on the 98 PC version? And will it work even if you already have mods installed? I would get it for the FMV's if it will work.
,Legato_Otagel,2013-03-08T07:39Z,It works only for the 98 version which is what all the mods are based from. The 2012 version works but you have to let the Bootleg mod convert it back to the 1998 version. It's also best to install it on a fresh install rather than an already modded game. Just make sure to put maximum installation when you are installing.
