CD 2 of the 6-CD set 'Listen'. Ripped into Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC) format from the original CD using dBpoweramp.

I urge you to listen to this music in FLAC rather than MP3 format, since MP3's lose some of the sound quality that you would hear on the CD. By contrast, FLAC loses none of that quality-- that's why it's called a lossless format.

VLC media player and many others play FLAC format. Installing the free K-Lite Codec Pack (Basic) will allow you to play FLAC files in Windows Media Player, if you aren't already able to: http://codecguide.com/download_kl.htm 

Songbird (http://getsongbird.com/desktop/) is a pretty good free program for organizing and playing your FLAC music library.
