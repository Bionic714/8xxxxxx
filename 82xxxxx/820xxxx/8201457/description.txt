Remember the Titans

Sam and Dean are stumped when they
investigate a possible zombie case where an
amnesiac man dies and then revives himself
once a day. After the guy is attacked by the
goddess Artemis, Sam and Dean realize he's
not a zombie but instead a god, more
specifically, Prometheus. Dean confides in
Sam that he knows they will be moved into
obscurity now that Grimm is finally
returning.
