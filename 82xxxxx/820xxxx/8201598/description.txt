Formed in New York, Elephant's Memory were a band trying to make it big. With two albums under their belt and a pretty secure line-up, the band went to work on their third album. However, the band had some help with producing this album: John Lennon and Yoko Ono. Elephant's Memory, at that time, were serving as John and Yoko's backing band for their controversial political album Sometime in New York City. John and Yoko can both be heard on the album at some points. For the most part, it's Elephant's Memory. "Liberation Special" is a great rocker while "Chuck N Bo" is a nice bluesy number. Songs like "Gypsy Wolf" and "Madness" are really rocking but "Power Boogie" will most likely be stuck in your head for a while. "Local Plastic Ono Band" is short but quite silly. Drummer Rick Frank is singing lead, in the style of Ray Davies ala "Lola" or "Apeman". How can you not love a lyric like this: "We're havin' Nixon for dinner tonight/We hope that you like him rare". Overall, a really good album.
