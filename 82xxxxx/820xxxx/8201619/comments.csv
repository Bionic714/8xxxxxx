,wevy,2013-03-01T01:54Z,just be patient the reason why the download speed is jumping around is because the upload speed is doing that as well but its steadily uploading just give it time and sorry for the jumping around I had to switch to utorrent because vuze wouldn't seed it it would just stay there and not upload it i wont stop seeding so you will be able to finish it :)

,agenthack,2013-03-04T05:21Z,i see..im not really sure why im only having less than 10kb dl speed..but with other dl's i have 200kb + speed...and i've been dl'ng this for 3 days now..lol...maybe if you set ul speed to 150-200kb it'll make dl'ng faster.. ;-)
,wevy,2013-03-04T05:27Z,My max is 170 kbs
,wevy,2013-03-04T05:32Z,That's what I was uploading at 170kbs 
,wevy,2013-03-04T05:33Z,Idk what to do to make it faster cause I'm uploading at my max n it's still slow
,agenthack,2013-03-04T06:11Z,maybe you're uploading multiple files? speed gets divided..i can dl it tom so your pc can rest...i may need to shutdown my pc too..lol...it was up for 5 days now..lol...
