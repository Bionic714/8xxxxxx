and Audio Rip Rate : 128 KBPS on 48000 KHZ.

then Movie quality very good .

This is for the your BLURAY RIP 2.76 each for both part. 


Yesterday, I Tested quality is awesome .. I get around 1.4-1.6 GB size for the Rip. 

and I ripped from Your Movie which is already ripped ... 

if you upload on that size then quality is more great ... 

Please try to upload your future movie are in 1.5-1.8 GB.. Its more easy to download.. 


its just a suggestion. and one more thing. Your Upload quality is best from other rippers."
