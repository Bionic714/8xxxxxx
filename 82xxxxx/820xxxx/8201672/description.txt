 Towards the end of colonial India, Shahid       
 Khan loots the British trains, impersonating    
 the legendary Sultana Daku. Now outcast,        
 Shahid becomes a worker at Ramadhir Singh's     
 colliery, only to spur a revenge battle that    
 passes on to generations. At the turn of the    
 decade, Shahid's son, the philandering Sardar   
 Khan vows to get his father's honor back,       
 becoming the most feared man of Wasseypur.      
 Staying true to its real life influences, the   
 film explores this revenge saga through the     
 socio-political dynamic in erstwhile Bihar      
 (North India), in the coal and scrap trade      
 mafia of Wasseypur, through the imprudence of   
 a place obsessed with mainstream 'Bollywood'.
