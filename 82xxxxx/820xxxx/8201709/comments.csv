Using VLC media player click on:

Media -> Open Network Stream...

paste this URL - http://jokersupdates.com/bbcafeeds.pls

Click Play.

Right click on stream window while playing and go to Playlist to select Feed 1,2,3, or 4 and the quality for that Feed.

You can bring up 4 instances of VLC media player and watch all 4 feeds at the same time."
