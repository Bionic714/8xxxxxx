VintageScene is your one stop shop for making photos look "old-school" or "retro".

Vintage Scene is the best special effects software for photography enthusiasts, turning a new or recent photo into an old photo, one that looks like it was taken many years ago.

This unique algorithm automatically combines several classic effects: sepia tone, grain, darkened edges, distressed paper, along with the look of fade that with time has left behind an image with only bright blacks and darkening whites. Vintage Scene is easy to use but gives the user control to change each component for a unique look on each photo.

Includes hundreds of possible combinations, a visual preset system, and the ability to create your own presets for re-use.

Built with power to produce high resolution images this app will apply the most sophisticated photo filters to your images. Vintage Scene quickly and easily creates compelling photos for graphic artists, photographers, & hobbyist who rely on a high quality end result.
