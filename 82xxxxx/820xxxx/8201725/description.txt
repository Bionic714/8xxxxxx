Indie bluegrass band Son Volt emerged from the ruins of Uncle Tupelo, so I was thrilled when their new album Honky Tonk came across my desk. Upon putting it in my car stereo, I was immediately greeted by the cheerfully upbeat opener ΓÇ£Hearts and MindsΓÇ¥ whose lyrics speak of ΓÇ£looking for love outside of dangerΓÇ¥ over a sunny, Cajun-like waltz. The rest of the album is a far more somber affair, with a typical country sound that is constantly being subverted by odd turns of poetic phrase in the lyrics. ΓÇ£Brick WallsΓÇ¥ speaks of a relationship where ΓÇ£thereΓÇÖs more brick walls than bridges on the way to your heartΓÇ¥, and even ΓÇ£Wild SideΓÇ¥, a tribute to a gracious rebel reminds us that ΓÇ£weΓÇÖll all be tested anyway.ΓÇ¥ ΓÇ£BakersfieldΓÇ¥ seems to be more about a location in the soul than a location on the map, and ΓÇ£Angel of the BluesΓÇ¥ offers an ever-so-slightly more modern sound, which isnΓÇÖt the blues per se but has quite the melancholy mood. ΓÇ£SeawallΓÇ¥ seemingly carries forward the albumΓÇÖs underlying theme of divisions and barriers that was first introduced in ΓÇ£Brick WallsΓÇ¥ and is also referred to in ΓÇ£Barricades.ΓÇ¥ Honky Tonk is an album firmly planted at the intersection of bluegrass, folk and Americana, a beautiful juxtaposition of traditional music with exquisite poetry.
