This is the 23 fps release,  will there be a 48fps HFR release ?  that'd be cool.."
,okonomiyaki,2013-02-28T10:55Z,"I downloaded this 1080 version because that 720 version was just so fuzzy low-resolution that I couldn't even tell what was going on..

But then I find out, this isn't the 48fps version!!!.. 24fps is so choppy it is unwatchable.. Like I am watching a hobbit slide-show.. geez I can't believe the crap I get after spending all day downloading a movie for free from the comfort of my own house.."

Anyway, this is awesome! It just stopped playing in the theater yesterday. Is this some odd coincidence? :-)

Also, the issue I had with sound stuttering on BOZX files was only because I was trying to stream these, which is not possible unless your receiver is picking up a consistent signal of 25+ MBS from your WiFi router. Now that I forked out $40 for a digital medial player, these larger files play perfectly from a USB stick. THANKS BOZX!!!"

,psychoacer,2013-02-28T23:21Z,"Haze do you know how torrents work? The first day is always the worst because there is obviously more leechers then seeders since it's pretty hard for there to be more people who have this then those who want this. So obviously it's going to be slow so stop complaining. Also people have been saying this for years so obviously your comment isn't going to do shit.

Beatcrusader: Even if you had a 1920x1080 monitor you will still have black bars. Those are there because your monitors aspect ratio is not the same as the movie. "
,rickydenim,2013-02-28T23:34Z,Can't wait for a remux BOZX. Great work mate!

,miguelboliviak,2013-03-01T01:22Z,"I AM SEEDING! Please don't leech off this one guys, cheers :)"
,Diegus83,2013-03-01T01:45Z,"@xjun1or3

It is FULL HD, but your TV/monitor aspect ratio is probably 16:9 or 16:10 (1920x1080) but most movies are 2.35:1 or similar.
So, if you crop the black bars when you encode the video you get resolutions like this."
,sebas9307,2013-03-01T02:07Z,"Sorry, How can I seed?, Just let torrent open after downloaded?"
,PM_ENG,2013-03-01T02:20Z,"it says its 1080p while its 1920x800, shouldn't it be 1920x 1080?"
,PrinceVince_,2013-03-01T02:40Z,"It's the aspect ratio of the movie. You either extend the vertical beyond 1920px, or you crop the horizontal to values below 1080px (16:9). Be glad this isn't encoded with redundant black letterbox bars."
,PrinceVince_,2013-03-01T02:41Z,I mixed up vertical and horizontal; you get my point.
,Dalkamyr,2013-03-01T04:00Z,Can anyone PLEASE comment on Audio and Video quality pls. I'd like to know before I download 13gb

Unfortunately it's actually you who's the retard, Evenglare. The Blu-Ray standard dictates that the frame rate has to be 24 fps and if you put a 48 fps version on a Blu-Ray disc, no player would be able to play it back.

The fact that you can play a video game at 60 fps is something completely different and if you think the movie company would create a 48 fps version that only could be played back on a computer (i.e. pirated) then you are possibly the most stupid person on TPB."

,juanchitoman,2013-03-26T21:47Z,"Hey guys! 

I am really curious (and kind of pissed off) at something: why are there only a few HD movies with 1080p resultion, this is, 1920x1080? Whenever they are 1920x800 or x1200 they never fit the whole TV screen, wasting some movie experience.

For example, the last Harry Potter movie has no version ANYWHERE on the Internet offering 1920x1080 :'(

Why is that?

Thanks!"
,steveken,2013-03-30T23:54Z,"@juanchitoman, because when you talk about 1920x1080 you refer to the WHOLE screen. Not the movie. If it is shot as one of those that is really wide screen where on a 1920x1080 tv it has those black bars on it, then it is a different aspect ratio and everything. By default, those types of movies are not 1920x1080. So, when you encode that for a tv, you don't wanna waste the bits encoding the black bars, so you leave those out and you end up getting a 1920x800 actual picture area for a 1.77:1 movie. Don't stress so much over the resolution, man. People don't alter the movie when they put them up on here. It's all there."
