anyone know for sure.. 

no people hidding on island pulling levers? or perhaps RC controlled devices lol"

and Josh should of been at the dock to meet them either at the start but definitely at the end to interview them and to do a final anaylze of their footage to see if they missed anything or cleared it up and played the evps like My ghost stories does.. with the words and waves.. (thats a nice way to do it I think)

they could of given them a full spectrum or thermal to play with also"
[V],psspss,2013-02-28T08:41Z,that way it would of come across more geniune
