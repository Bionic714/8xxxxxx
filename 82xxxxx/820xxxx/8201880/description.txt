converted evolves mp4 to xvid 360p 640x360p mp3 cbr 128 1000BR optimized for
samsung/sony tvs so will work on most things

A new reality Paranormal show produced by josh gates where he puts 3 or more people on a haunted
ghostly island or location (I suspect its a 6 episode pilot Season like ghost mine)

Stupid name for a show.. hasnt any word liek ghost paranormal or haunted in
the title so people will think its one of those reality shows where they
compete to stay on the Island LOL oh well


I see Josh intros it.. with a deep voice.. not kermit :)

ENjoy and HELP SEED IT

seems some dont know the difference
