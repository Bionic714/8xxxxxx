BMW: Who Colt The Game Cassette

Source: cassette&gt; Xitel Inport &gt; Hard Drive &gt; Wav.

     This is another of many tapes I was given by a friend in Santa Monica in about 1989. Side A: consists of
11 tracks from what I understand to be the Black Ark Demos, Side B: are 3 tracks from the '79 Wounded Lion
cessions. I have an 11 minute Ride Natty Ride that may also be a partial track to this cession, but not from this tape.
So I did not include here. Further, it sounds different (source ?) so I can post at a later date.
     
Side A:

1. Who Colt The Game #1 3:30
2. Who Colt The Game #2 version 3:38
3. I Know A Place 4:09
4. I Know A Place #2 version 4:33
5. Jah Live 4:20
6. Jah Live (single channel vocal-dub) 4:29

8. Talkin' Blues (riding High version) 4:55

10. Bend Down Low 2:47
