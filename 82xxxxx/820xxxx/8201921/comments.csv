To fix this issue go into Windows firewall and block outgoing connection from the application ""windows8manager.exe"" in the yamicsoft folder."
,bert16,2013-03-03T03:45Z,I installed this and it's really 1.06 which is what I already had. It seemed to update OK and overwrote the existing version. Has anyone installed this and got 1.07?
