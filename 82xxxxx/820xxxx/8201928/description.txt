ΓÖª A tile-built, turn-based game world where the result of absolutely every action is rolled, calculated or statistically determined. Strategy is paramount to success; careful skill management, equipment selection and magic usage will win your fights, not rapid button clicking. We are very pleased to say this is not another ΓÇ£action RPGΓÇ¥.

ΓÖª Hundreds of items and dozens of creatures await your discovery. A combination of randomly generated treasure and carefully hidden goodies means that no two games will play the exact same way.

ΓÖª Unlimited character development style: Choose from 24 unique skills to make the character you want and 8 base attributes that affect your characterΓÇÖs every action throughout the game. The game world does not scale or adjust itself to match anyoneΓÇÖs play style, so the ease or difficulty of the game is directly related to how successful you are at developing your character.

ΓÖª Combat plays out at your pace. Eschalon: Book I features a turn-based system that allows you to roll through combat as fast or slow you wantΓÇªmake it fast and furious, or analyze every option for maximum advantage.

ΓÖª A non-linear storyline means that the game world is open to explore as you desire. Follow the storyline or donΓÇÖtΓÇªitΓÇÖs up to you. Just be careful where you go and who you choose to trust- the world of Eschalon can be a deadly place for an inexperienced adventurer.

ΓÖª An epic adventure that you must face aloneΓÇªa single-player RPG carefully designed to feel like the great old school RPGs of the past such as Ultima┬«, Might & Magic┬«, and Wizardry┬«
