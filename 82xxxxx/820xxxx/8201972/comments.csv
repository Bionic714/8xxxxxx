,dacc420,2013-04-12T03:32Z,"I installed this to my iPhone 4S running on iOS 6.1.2 perfectly. You need to have your device jailbroken, then get the following from Cydia: iFile, AppSync, iTransmission and iPASTORE.

Open iTransmission and use the magnet link for this torrent to download it. Then, go into iFile and locate the .ipa file. After you've found it, move it to the directory: var/mobile/Documents/ipastore/Downloads. Finally, open iPASTORE and go into the Downloads section, then hit install it so it appears on your springboard as a usable app. That's what I did."
