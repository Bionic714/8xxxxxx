SamLab long been a member of the team Bashrat has the ability to know about all the problems of the other driver packages to create its own set of the most comprehensive and peaceful!

NB: If a driver has not been established, showed up not chosen optimally: for any other questions and mistakes - it is necessary:
A report, running from the root SysInfo.exe SamDrivers, while in the root directory C: create a file that you need to put SysInfo.7z here

Drivers for touchpads and other input devices of the driver packs DP_Touchpad_HHH installed only under the personal supervision and only envelope DPS
All of these devices have the same ID - controls what put us on the touchpad and the name of the pack on the notebook vendor in the name of the folder with the drivers
Still same identifiers found in drivers for sound cards and tuners - install just the drivers what firm your device
