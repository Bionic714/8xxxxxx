Murdoch Mysteries S06E07 - The Ghost of Queen's Park

Murdoch investigates the death of a politician. 

This episode has not been released yet by the scene as far as I know. It was aired on Feb 25, 2013 on CBC HD in Canada. Like all of my releases to date, the source is an analog rip, so the quality is, at best, something like A8 V8.
