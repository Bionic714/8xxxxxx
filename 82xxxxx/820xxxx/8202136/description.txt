he Shotgun Brothers Band is a unique blend of musical styles and sounds. Ranging from hard-driving, Bluegrass-inspired Rock, to Psychedelic electric instrumentation, to Vocal and lyric driven Americana, and everything between. There's a certain nod the pioneers of jamming, the Grateful Dead, but swirled together with so many different influences, that nearly every song falls into it's own genre. More than anything, the Shotgun Brothers Band is about having fun and interacting with each other and the audience.
