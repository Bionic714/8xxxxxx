,Whickerx7,2013-02-28T16:04Z,"Greygo if you knew anything you would know an ""untouched"" port would not work with any mouse/keyboard input and its not as simple as you think on the consoles they only had to make the game for 2/3 specific hardware sets with PC there are millions of hardware comboinations its much harder to make it compatible will all of them"
,Balintss,2013-02-28T17:01Z,"I've done anything according to the steps, but when I try to launch, it says: Disk cannot be read - and the game won't start up normally (black screen).

Can anybody suggest a solution? (I'm using a windows 8, with the previous update it was fine)"
[V],Gh0stNet,2013-02-28T17:42Z,Dont use reloaded update other wise your game will not work so reinstall game then install my update 2 and update 3 
,Balintss,2013-02-28T18:43Z,"I didn't use the reloaded update, just the two update of yours.. i've tried reinstalling the game - i repeated the steps, but it's the same. "
,Balintss,2013-02-28T18:45Z,"I redownloaded the updates, but it's the same."
,Balintss,2013-02-28T18:46Z,"I didn't use the reloaded update, just yours. (2 and 3)"

,Machine4578,2013-02-28T20:32Z,"@RaW-D-Coy

RELOADED..quality??
no this is quality!!!.. "
,Stefanovics,2013-02-28T22:38Z,"it wont save!
i had read from a forum that if this occurs the only thing to do is downgrade to 1.01
so i will reinstall the game but only with the first update"
,Stefanovics,2013-02-28T22:58Z,"the method worked. if someone has save issues only use the
Brutal.Legend.Update.1-RELOADED"
,Pestilencemage,2013-03-01T02:49Z,"Whickerx7 and GeryGo
Everything in this game works perfectly.  (er... the legit version anyway)  There is nothing ""broken"".  As you failed to discribe your problem, and judgeing by the way GeryGo worded his message; I'll assume he is an idiot who calls tech support and bitches untill they tell him to plug in his P.... well, probably a MAC.  Get yourself a MAC, they are good for people who don't know what they are doing."
,dahaka47,2013-03-01T04:50Z,"@ Pestilencemage

If everything in this game works perfectly as you say, then developers must be releasing updates for the pirated version. Isn't that right, genius?"
,dcs78,2013-03-01T07:00Z,"For anyone getting an error about too many file names in RgB_Ctsn.~p, here is a fix that worked for me.

Open Brutal.Legend.Update.3.bat and find ""RgB_Ctsn.patch"". Simply add two ampersands with spaces before and after, just like this ""&&""

The string should read:
xdelta3 -d -f -q -9 s ""WinPacksRgB_Ctsn.~p.tmp"" RgB_Ctsn.patch && ""WinPacksRgB_Ctsn.~p""

Gh0stNet: There is a newer version of xdelta out. It has both a x86 and x64 flavors. I put both in the folder naming them ""xdelta3x86"" and ""xdelta3x64"". Then I added a few pieces of code to decide which to use. As this is my first post and I don't know how to pm you I will add entire file. *Note: Only tested it on Win8 x64.

,miked2138,2013-03-01T07:22Z," I dont know whats up with this ""update"" but it didnt work for me  either, and it changed the permissions on my game folder so i could not even paste the steam, crack back into the folder, and even after uninstalling and not using this update it still did it, i had to change the install directory to be able to install the game again,, imo avoid this one something is def not right with this, the reloaded game and update 1 work just fine, "
,tedwu,2013-03-01T09:11Z,"Another confirm that this path along with Update 2 will not work w/ RELOADED version of the game. I followed per uploader's instruction dont use RELOADED patch for anything just update 2 and 3 P2P uploaded by Gh0stNet.
Result win7, GTX690 froze on start up.
Going back to RELOADED update 1.
As far as the game at first it's weird but during game play asides from some of the major bug issue I really enjoyed it. 
Still seeding RELOADED version so others can enjoy:)
Found solution please share anything will help thanks."
