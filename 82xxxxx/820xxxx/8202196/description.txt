 ****************************** 
Brutal Legend is an action-adventure that marries visceral action combat
with open-world freedom. Set in a universe somewhere between Lord of the
Rings and Spinal Tap, its a fresh take on the action/driving genre, which
in this case is full of imitation cover bands, demons intent on enslaving
humanity and Heavy metal tunes. Featuring the talents of comedian, actor
and musician, Jack Black as super roadie Eddie Riggs, as well as cameos by
some of the biggest names in metal music it's a wild ride in the belly of
the beast that is not to be missed by gamers and Metalheads alike

Included as a free bonus in the PC version of Brutal Legend are both the
Hammer of Infinite Fate and Tears of the Hextadon multiplayer map packs

Change log:-
----------

Major Fixes
ΓÇó Terrible stuttering/low framerate that some players experienced after pausing the game (including opening the map) should now be now fixed. This required (temporarily) disabling interpolated rendering. WeΓÇÖll re-enable interpolated rendering once we having the timing issue that affected some players worked out. Hi-fi (60 fps) sim is still enabled (if you turn the option on).
ΓÇó Missing background in Motor Forge is fixed.
ΓÇó Fixes and improvements for the in-game radial menus based on player feedback.
ΓÇó Fixed the shadows in the intro area of the game and in additional trouble spots

Major Known Issues
ΓÇó Alt+Tab can lead to black textures.
ΓÇó Interpolated rendering is disabled until we have a solution that works on all platforms.
