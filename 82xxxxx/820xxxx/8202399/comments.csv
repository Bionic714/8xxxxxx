,mindextension,2013-03-01T02:13Z,"The last 10 minutes is a Russian overdub. Funny one can still understand what is going on.

Do svidaniya!"
,BUTT_SEX,2013-03-01T06:57Z,Should have uploaded it in avi/xvid format. More versatile file. I'll probably download and convert it anyways. Thanks.
,itznite,2013-03-01T07:06Z,exact dupe of previous release....
,OsamaBinKevo,2013-03-01T08:32Z,Thanks man!
,tattooinescavenger,2013-03-01T10:27Z,"Thank 4 hard work, dude - am beginning to think the voiceover parts are PART of the story in the movie??? Most people aren't watching more than 30 seconds of the DL to find out it's mostly in English...?"
,maverickbleh,2013-03-02T00:54Z,"@tattooinescavenger in the international version maybe, but not the US version. In the US version, it's not kids who watch Youtube, it's Dennis Quaid pitching movie ideas to a producer. Without any russian."
,pgsgpf,2013-03-03T01:19Z,thanks bro can you do Jack the Giant Slayer
,EdgarS789,2013-03-09T08:24Z,"In another R5 version of this movie, the strong Russian voiceover is in the FIRST 20 minutes or so. I never watched the end. Without subtitles, I consider this flaw makes the movie unwatchable for English audiences. So I hope a copy with really clean English audio or at least subtitles, comes along soon."
,tej5,2013-04-05T18:42Z,"Thanks to the uploader! Movie was OK as i expected it to be! I usually watch all the movies at film.inisolo.com because they have HD's but they didn't have this one so im happy to have piratebay :) Good torrent quality - A9 V9,"
,smitsonijum,2013-04-23T16:59Z,this is so shitty it do not deserve to be called film...
