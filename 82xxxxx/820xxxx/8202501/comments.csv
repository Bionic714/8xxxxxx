[V],RosaMannen,2013-02-28T20:14Z,hello! i have noticed that you don't seed after you have downloaded the files. how come??
,beaujoulais,2013-02-28T21:28Z,"Hi RosaMannen, I'm driving seeds all days and all nights long. Cf: actually runs a seed of a 'Spirit' concert of 4GB and this needs a couple of days with my 100MBit upload. Most of the time I'm seeding very old music video clips and concerts I've once got more than 10 years ago. So please don't be angry about sometimes re-uploading with some weeks of time shift. T.B."
,beaujoulais,2013-02-28T21:44Z,"I've actually checked the situation for 
Slayer - Hultsfred Festival (2002).avi; file size: 703 MB; seeded: 1.11 GB; still missing: 16.2 MB
- this doesn't look like not seeding enough?!"
,beaujoulais,2013-02-28T22:05Z,please valuate seeds of new created torrents of others like uploads of your seeds. T.B. 
[V],RosaMannen,2013-03-01T06:21Z,ok. i believe you. sorry. must be my fault. I will help you with the seedings this weekend. have a nice day
,beaujoulais,2013-03-01T21:12Z,"Hi, it's not your fault. I'm releasing music videos 'Anonymous' because of silly restrictions at German law and dirty advocats, which act like vampires to press money out of you based on your hobbies. Thus I'll keep an eye on acting as careful as possible and -in normal- seeding and leaching no DVDs nor BRs. I try to use only TV rips of clips and TV broadcasted concerts. Sorry, I'm not allowed acting 'transparent' like in nice old Kazza, Shareaza and WinMX days. Keep going on wiht your project of live clips from Swedish newcomer groups. It's pretty nice and interesting stuff. cu, Tom"
