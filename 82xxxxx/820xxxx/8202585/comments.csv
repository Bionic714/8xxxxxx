,IAmSoGreat,2013-03-01T08:57Z,"Hey just wondering but why did you stop uploading the .avi files you did before?  

What program would you say plays these ones best people? ive got a mac and i use QuickTime with perian tools or NicePlayer for mkv files neither really works well for these ones and the sound/subs is never in sync.

also thanks for the uploads, even if i cant get them to play right lately im still glad i can watch this series."
