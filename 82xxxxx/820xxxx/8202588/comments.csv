for those of us keeping score, after the new cancellations take effect and after the debuts of constantine (march), the green team, the movement (both in may), larfleeze and batman/superman (both in june), there will only be 48 titles in the new 52."

,DiFato,2013-03-01T01:18Z,"I was wondering if you could upload ""Batman: Knight and Squire"""
,dsohei,2013-03-01T01:47Z,the events of batman inc take place BEFORE death of the family. it's pretty terrible chronology not to mention the entire dc reboot is badly thought out.

I can't seem to find the complete series in order anywhere. If you could point me in the right direction or even upload it that'd be great. Keep up the good work. Cheers."
