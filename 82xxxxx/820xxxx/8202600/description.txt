EVEN AS WE SPEAK is an illuminating and hilarious collection of essays from one of Picador's most beloved authors. Reflecting his comprehensive knowledge, wide-ranging interests and eclectic style, Clive James explores the rise and fall of various celebrities, discusses Australian poetry, considers the state of television today, questions the culpability of the ordinary German in the holocaust, and contemplates -- in a compellingly provocative and much-talked about piece -- the death of Diana.

Sadly incomplete, but for fans of Clive James still most enjoyable.
