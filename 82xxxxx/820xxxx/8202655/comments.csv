It firstly asks you to be a phone admin. When you've accepted that and been putting in a code, you'll get requested to enter your email address. When that's done, it suddenly stops and won't get removed in any case, because it's the damn admin of the phone. Fucking piece of shit!"
,Q__boii,2013-03-16T18:35Z,"forgot to mention i'm also an ICS root user. Have to reinstall the damn ROM, or restore my Nandroid backup. It sucks!"
,CollectorMan223,2013-03-29T19:38Z,Hey Q__boii did you uninstall it like a regular app or did u go in to kaspersky advanced and uninstall from there? Jw bc it might explain the problem you had. The uninstall in side the app has gotta be there for a reason just sayn'.
,Nikkzee,2013-05-11T05:40Z,hey qboi u can always remove the phone admin from rom.......... :)
