This torrent contains the English-patched game, the original Japanese game, the source code, and a walkthrough (you'll need it).  Note that Demonophobia contains no in-game music or audio, so you should probably find a torrent of a good spooky/suspensful soundtrack (Silent Hill fits perfectly), unless you think the lack of audio helps increase the suspense.

The lack of audio, along with the game's control scheme (which can be annoying at best, downright infuriating at worst), may put some people off of this game.  However, if you are a sadist, a masochist, or like subjecting terrified 14 year old lolis to rediculous amounts of cruelty or violence, then this game is just for you!  Or if you just like suspense/horror, either way you'll probably enjoy this game."
