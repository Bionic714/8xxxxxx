Demonophobia is a Guro Survival Horror game with more emphasis on the Horror aspect and much less on the Survival aspect. You play as a girl named Sakuri Kunikai, who, after jokingly pretending to summon a demon to get revenge for some reason, wakes up to find herself dumped in Hell. Not surprisingly, Hell is full of deathtraps and demons that only desire to cause grievous bodily harm, including a large hulking thing that looks like a distant relative of a certain geometry-based monster that is constantly hunting her down. And she's pretty much powerless, but she seems to have help from a small, mysterious demon in blue who offers her advice and gives her a chance to flee.

And so begins Sakuri's quest to escape from Hell.

The game features lots of death traps with long, elaborate cutscenes that come suddenly just by taking a wrong turn, finishing Sakuri off in brutal ways, who, being conscious the whole time, will revive a few days later to try again from the beginning of the level and a healthy dose of amnesia. Discretion is advised.
