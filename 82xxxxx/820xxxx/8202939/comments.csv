,gungrave4ever,2013-02-28T14:52Z,"YIFY, how do I get Stereoscopic Player to merge the 3D movies? Every 3D movie I try to play with Stereoscopic Player shows two images like this.

I need to be able to watch it interlaced/polarized because my 3D monitor is a HP 2311 GT.

,EvilCorporateWhore,2013-02-28T18:17Z,"@bfc2012

Your first time here? Well, let me say welcome to TPB. Anyway, they're saying ""waiting for 1080 version"" because they are basically reminding YIFY that his/her fans are anticipating their 1080 release... as they usually always does both resolutions. Is it pointless? Maybe. There is no guarantee that YIFY would have released a 1080 version, but at least they know it's wanted. That clear things up for you?

I will also be waiting for the 1080 version, as i'm downloading one right now that's 13GB, i will probably stop that one as i see YIFY will most likely release theirs soon. :)"

,bfc2012,2013-02-28T20:00Z,"@EvilCorporateWhore: wow, a completely useless post to explain other completely useless posts... thanks again for your posting pollution, because i couldn't figure out the 720p followed by 1080p format that yify has been using for YEARS with THOUSANDS of movies... so thanks for explaining it... hey, can you explain how to use the piratebay's search feature too? oh, by the way, i'm waiting for a pizza i just ordered, i'll let all you guys know when it gets here, because i still haven't figured out the pattern of 'order pizza and 20 minutes later, it's here'...."

I'm glad you caught on to the point i was making with my reply, i'm relieved it wasn't lost on you. Now i'm wondering if you're smart enough to clue into the irony in all the useless posts you're making... i don't think i'll hold my breath on that one. ;)"

@Muddicks: There comes a time in an uploader's career when his rips no longer need ratings.

@EvilCorporateWhore: Dude, I like your username & your replies to bfc2012. Hardly have I seen people tackling trolls sans profanities... way to go!!"

Weird... in YIFY's 1080p version the non-English bits(elves, orcs, etc) are hard coded, and nicely i might add. Wonder why they aren't in this version."
