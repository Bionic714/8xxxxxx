,Nightwing1945,2013-02-28T15:50Z,"Thanks STF, this looks cool.

Request:  I know, I know, always requesting, but I can't find Insufferable v004.  v005 was in Zero Day last week, but 004 escapes me.  If you have it, or can use your superior searching skills, I would appreciate it."
,Nightwing1945,2013-02-28T16:29Z,"Ha ha, I guess I jumped the gun on that request, I found Insufferable 004 all by my own self.  Thanks anyway STF, keep up all the great work you do here for us comic lovers!!"
