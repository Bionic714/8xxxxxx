,deadcow1,2013-03-01T08:43Z,I deleted all the win* style files that made the CBT Nuggets version run with autoplay or in a browser. If you use Windows to learn there are 2 DVD's inside so you can burn them and install the whole pack.  Please seed.

,Orion_X11,2013-03-16T23:42Z,Hi. How can it have 11.12 GiB if it have only some Pdfs and a DVD.iso? Even if they are Dvds 1 and 2 how can they have 11.12 GiB? Could someone to explain me?
,deadcow1,2013-03-20T19:58Z,i know it's kind of late but you can skip the comptia  pack altogether. if you really want them you have the DVD's and one of them is installed already and takes something like 1Gb. the books are priceless and also the folder 'linux201'.
