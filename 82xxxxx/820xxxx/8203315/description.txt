Assassin's Creed III is a free-roaming action-adventure game for the PS3, PC, Xbox 360, and WiiU that takes place both in a near-future setting and 1775 colonial America. The series places the player in the role of Desmond Miles, descendant of a long line of assassins. His ancestors have been battling the Templars for control of powerful artifacts from an ancient, deceased race. Desmond accesses memories locked inside his DNA through the use of a machine called the Animus in the search for clues and information on the artifacts, as well as gaining the skills of his ancestors as he lives their memories. This is where the majority of the game takes place, through 30 years of the life of Connor Kenway, Desmond's ancestor.
