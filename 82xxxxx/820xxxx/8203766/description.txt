Well, I decided to update the file of icons for everyone!  These are created for Windows mostly and are 256x256.  Sorry, Mac guys!

Anyway, I've included icons from the latest series in the New 52, new miniseries, and new Digital First titles.

Enjoy!

If you missed the first update (which contains all the original icons as well), you can find it here:
