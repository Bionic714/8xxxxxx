,Sunuvagun,2013-03-01T04:30Z,"I don't know if this has English subtitles for just the foreign parts (it's a common problem), but if not, you can get them at: http://subscene.com/subtitles/life-of-pi-2012/english/694060.  To hardcode them into this video, first use mkvmerge to merge the .srt file with the .mkv.  At the same time, use mkvmerge strip all of the other subtitles from the .mkv file.  Then, use mkv2vob to burn the subtitles into the video."
,Sunuvagun,2013-03-01T23:19Z,"OK, I finished d'loading the .mkv, and BOZX's version -does- have English subtitles for just the non-English parts.   However, the subtitle file is -not- labeled, so that while the subtitles will show up in VLC (for example), hardcoding does not work as per the usual method of stripping all but one of the subtitle files.  For this video, use mkvmerge to remove ALL -displayed- subtitles.  Then, use mkv2vob to remux the file with ""burn subtitles"" turned on in the configuration.  Voilà!  The desired English-for-foreign subtitles will be hard-coded into the video stream."
