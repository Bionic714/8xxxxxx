CGW Short Review: 
Simply put, SWAT 4 is just about the best tactical shooter available. 
It's outstandingly realistic and gripping play delivers everything a tac-sim fan craves. 
Now, if you'll excuse me, there are more perps in need of cuffing.


Detailed Game Information:
The campaign of SWAT 4 takes place in a fictional locale loosely based on a future New York City.

During the campaign, the player is tasked with leading a five-man police SWAT team, also known as 
an ""element"", through 13 missions. The player controls ""Lead"", a recent transferee and former LAPD SWAT officer.
SWAT 4's goal is having gameplay simulating a real police SWAT officer's experience.

To simulate realistic police procedures, SWAT 4 encourages the use of non-lethal force to subdue and arrest subjects 
rather than incapacitating or killing them. In addition, players must follow protocol to ensure 
proper use of force. Players may not fire on suspects with lethal weapons unless the suspect points their firearm at 
a fellow officer or a civilian. Penalties are given for unauthorized use of force, injuries to hostages, 
officer incapacitation and personal injury. 

The player character leads a five-man SWAT made up of the leader and four other men that are divided into 
two pairs, called ""teams"". The teams are assigned colors, ""red"" or ""blue"". 
The player does not assume direct control over the other officers. However, orders can be issued from an order 
selection menu, ranging from clearing a room to covering an area and handcuffing a compliant person. 
Additionally, a video camera is mounted on each police officer's helmet. This allows the leader to see what 
other members of the element see, and to issue appropriate orders to a team that is in another location.

All missions start with a pre-mission briefing which describes the situation and gives whatever details are 
available on the suspects and/or hostages. For some missions, a 911 call is heard, which can give a clue on what
to expect, and what equipment should be chosen for that situation.
The briefing identifies mission goals, which consists of bringing order to chaos by removing all suspects, 
and rescue all hostages or other civilians. 

Sniper support may also be provided. Different objectives may include the capture of a specific suspect, 
finding out the fate of an undercover officer, or defusing explosives. 
After the briefing, the player can choose equipment for themselves and the other four officers. 
Some mission maps also provide for multiple entry points.

A perfect score may be gained in a campaign by arresting all suspects and rescuing all civilians, securing 
all weapons, reporting all status updates, not suffering any losses to the team, and not receiving injury.

The missions progress from poorly armed suspects to well-equipped terrorists with weaponry such as AKM rifles.

Suspects may also obtain gas masks, helmets, and body armor, sometimes given to them by the police during 
negotiations. Suspects who cannot be arrested or who won't cooperate when verbally challenged must be 
neutralized according to SWAT protocol.
SWAT 4 uses the concept of authorized and unauthorized use of weapons. Most situations require the officers 
to give the suspect a warning to give them the chance to surrender. Shooting without warning is considered 
unauthorized use of force or deadly force, depending on whether the player kills the suspect. A non-compliant 
suspect that does not point his weapon at another person may not be lawfully shot. 
Shooting without warning is allowed if the suspect is pointing their weapon at a hostage or a SWAT team member 
or if they open fire. Suspect reactions to warnings differ—some may attempt to hide and set up an ambush, some 
immediately surrender, others will flee and some will open fire. Some suspects may also pretend to surrender and 
open fire or run. If a hostage is killed, the mission is automatically deemed a failure.
Lightly wounded players suffer gameplay penalties depending on injury locations. Leg injuries res"

Though the graphics is of course outdated, the feel of it is still as good now as 8 years ago :)"
