There's a menu option in this App to install updated DirectX files if needed.

NETWORK PLAY
_____________

In the game, select 'LAN' then click button 'DIRECT IP'. Type your friends IP address 
who is hosting the server. Either that or you host and your friend(s) connects to you.
This way you can play with your friends connecting directly to their IP address.
You will need to accept SWAT4 in your Windows Firewall when Windows asks.
The person hosting the game server will also need to properly forward 
incoming packets in his/her router.
SWAT 4-The Stetchkov Syndicate requires you to forward the UDP 10480-10483 ports.
You cannot connect to official Internet game servers running a cracked game 
such as this, so single player gaming or internet hosting with friends are the 
available gaming options.

SWAT 4 features several multiplayer game modes, all of which are team-based: 
SWAT versus suspects. Here is a list of the multiplayer modes.

Barricaded Suspects:
Teams gain points by arresting or killing members of the other team. 
The team which hits the score limit first or has the highest score when the 
round time ends wins.

VIP Escort:
A random member of the SWAT team is selected to be the VIP. The suspects must arrest 
the VIP, hold him for two minutes and then execute him. The SWAT team must escort the 
VIP to an extraction point on the map. 
If the suspects kill the VIP without holding him for two minutes, SWAT wins. 
If a SWAT team member kills the VIP, suspects win.

Rapid Deployment:
Three to five bombs are placed throughout the map. The SWAT team must locate and 
disable them all within a time limit, if they fail to do so, suspects win.

Co-op: 
This allows the player to play through the single-player missions with up to four 
other people taking the place of computer-controlled SWAT officers. In the expansion, 
Co-op can run on custom missions and with up to ten players per game, which can further 
be split into two completely separate teams (red and blue) with a leader each. 
This is not similar to single player teams where an element leader controls both teams.
