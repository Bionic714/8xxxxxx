This fills a request (maybe) for Donkrieg1101. My friend I don't know if the 2nd one ever came out -- although, in a sense, this is the "2nd one." (See below.)

From Wikipedia:

Sharknife is an action/comedy/henshin comics series by Corey Lewis (sometimes credited as "Rey" or "The Rey"), intended to eventually consist of five digest-sized graphic novels.

The first volume was released in 2005, and a revised second edition, titled Sharknife Stage First, was released in 2006.

The first printing advertised that a second volume would be released in Fall 2005, but it has since been pushed back due to Lewis's involvement with the Rival Schools comics series from UDON. The second volume is called Sharknife Double Z, which REYYY website recently advised will be released in 2012.
