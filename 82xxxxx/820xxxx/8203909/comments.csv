,batman79,2013-03-10T07:16Z,compressing this at 10bit is a retarded waste. Realize that most peoples monitors cannot display more than 8 and a large chunk of cheap LCDs are only 6. So whats the point? You should have put that information into something useful like pushing the resolution up to 720.

,canc232,2013-03-11T07:20Z,"@batman79 you can always get another release if you dont want 10 bit files. Suit yourself,no one is forcing you. 10 bit gives a near equal quality at a considerably lesser size. Update your player or DL the pot player. Btw 720p is not possible at this size. Try and tell me if you got it"
