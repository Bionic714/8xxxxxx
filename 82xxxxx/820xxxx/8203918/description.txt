  Blending aspects of dark electro, dissonant art rock, and plodding indie rock, Suuns, formerly named Zeroes, utilize minimalism in their wide-open (and often paranoid) sound. After their first EP, which was also titled Zeroes, they recorded a full-length with the Besnard Lakes' Jace Lasek at Breakglass Studios in their home city of Montreal. Upon Lasek's recommendation, the ten-song outing, Zeroes QC, got the attention of Secretly Canadian, and Suuns signed to the label in the autumn of 2010. That October the album was released, just as the group started touring with the Besnard Lakes and Land of Talk.
