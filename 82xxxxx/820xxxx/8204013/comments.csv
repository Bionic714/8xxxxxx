,helloyou44,2013-03-07T09:08Z,Can some one tell me why I can not see the map when I look in my garmin maps in nuvi 660?
,Tstart,2013-03-07T11:16Z,"have you copied the Garmin folder to your sd-card?

not just the img inside the folder"
,helloyou44,2013-03-07T15:15Z,"Yes I did, my SD card is noname, inside is a garmin folder and there inside is the img, When I go inside the maps in my nuvi 660 I can see only the old v9 map not marked, but when I want to navigate I see roads and everything but do not know if these are from the v9 map or the new one 2013"
,Tstart,2013-03-08T01:15Z,"in Map Info you should be able to see both maps listed and be able to check which one you want to use

,helloyou44,2013-03-08T15:00Z,"Yes thats what I mean, I can not se the new map there, I can only see only the old map and its unchecked"
,Tstart,2013-03-08T16:02Z,"weird ... is the SD-card too big for your Garmin? ie can it read that size?

Some older can only read up to 2 GB, not 4GB cards"
,Tstart,2013-03-08T22:28Z,"checked Nuvi 660 can handle up to 16 GB

is it formatted in FAT32 then? cause if it´s using NTFS the 660 can´t read it"
,helloyou44,2013-03-09T13:44Z,"its FAT32 and my garmin 660 had the older 2012 maps in a 4Gb card with no problem, I use the same card now, I tried to navigate yesterday but nothing works so I had to use older maps v9 in nuvi it self"
,Tstart,2013-03-09T15:57Z,"then I´m clueless :/

unlocked map in a Garmin folder should work straight away"
,shitdog1234,2013-04-19T22:48Z,"helloboy44 , try when you are on the map , to zoom in on the map , on the + , push many times on the + , and then you can see the road where you stay , I have the same problem on my Nuvi 750 , when I start it the first time , after install this update . Have a nice day"
