,sakkispb,2013-03-25T23:17Z,"There is some problem with the sound.

DTS HD-MA is presented like DTS with 6 channels, but the main problem i think is that the track is not recognizable as DTS HD-MA 7.1ch either form my sony bluray, or TSmuxer on pc.

Results: It's not playable in my home cinema.

Maybe is the container (.mkv) that can't handle properly DTS HD-MA, like .m2ts can??

Any tips are welcome..."
,sakkispb,2013-04-01T07:27Z,"I finally got it to work. Reencoding with RipBot264 and creating an AVCHD structure. Now Audio is working perfectly as DTS-HD MA 7.1ch [6.1Mbs](after reencoding).

A: 10
V: 10

Perfect quality, watched on Home Cinema as "".m2ts"" file.

***
If anyone is interested in adding subtitles on blurays (m2ts, ts, or mkv, mp4), so he can watch from home theater or ps3 stand alone, just use RipBot264. 
You can hardcode image subtitles (sup, srt...) and retain the exactly same quality in both a/v.

You reencode the bluray. Although you must have a powerful cpu, it’s very demanding."

I don't think it is necessary to 're-encode' just because it is an MKV file.  I have a fairly touchy OPPO Blu-ray player and all you really need is to use TSMuxer to place the MKV A/V files into an AVCHD or strict Blu-ray format (which I would use in this case since the file size requires a Blu-ray anyway - I guess first you WOULD have to remux the remux using BDRebuilder or something to shrink it to fit on a single layer BD anyway or if you had more time and the CPU power, you COULD shrink it down to a BD9, but then why download this Blu-ray  : )"
