For XVID AVI with MP3 audio, current consensus suggests:
V=9
A=9

Replaces the Grossly Pixelated LOL / DIM release @ 00:20
As I found this during pre-screening, I thank them for screwing up early in the ep.

I would like to point out that there is no better source than a WEB-DL
This is not some cheezy webrip, this is what the networks package and sell
through iTunes or Amazon. 
.
The problem is that this is a direct threat to "The Scene" and their monopoly.
So, if anyone bad mouths a WEB-DL, especially without specifics, they are lying.
Except this past WEB-DL of Touch from FOX - abominable single channel mix.
As long as "The Scene" keep their heads in the dirt over pixelation as horrible
as this week's "Go.On.S01E17", WEB-DL is the only quality available.
.
While I may be just a lowly re-encoder, understand that nobody broadcasts
in MKV, MP4 or AVI - so if it's not "Transport Stream" (.TS) Then it's ALL
a re-encode. Every "Scene" download has ALWAYS been a re-encode.
