,kevvy007,2013-03-01T23:17Z,"Tospeak I'm assuming you mean the Swedish people when you say "" We already made this shit in the 90's ""... as this is a Swedish site.  What show did the Swedes make that is like Housos?  I would love to watch it, love Housos."
,tobiashorton,2013-03-02T06:58Z,"Tospeak: I would also like to know what show you speak of  australia has been taking the piss out of ourselves for years. its just that this is one of the better ( or worse, depending who you ask). this is more like a doco to some people. so close to the truth it hurts."
