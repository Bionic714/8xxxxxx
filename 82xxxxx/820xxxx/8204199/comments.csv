,bajazzba,2013-03-10T01:57Z,"Impark ty for this torrent. Can i put some oher maps to be in mapsource together with city navigator europe (adria route 3.11) i assume it would be locked, would it be ok to unlock it with garmin keygen 1.5 without ruining city navigator?"
,Ipmark,2013-03-10T18:54Z,"Do NOT merge together maps from different manufacturers, keep them separated and not overlapping if active at the same time on the GPS.
Latest AdriaRoute is the v4.10, the unlocked map can be downloaded here:

,bajazzba,2013-03-10T21:15Z,thanx bro
,bajazzba,2013-03-11T00:03Z,"Ok I just cannot make it how i want it to be. 
As i said your torrent is great ''Garmin City Navigator Europe NT 2013.40 Unlocked for Mapsource'' and i install it and it works perfect. Now what i cannot do is to install  latest AdriaRoute and unlock it in your mapsource so i can combine those 2 maps (i know it can cause problems if i choose same country map from europe map and adriaroute and i will not do it). This is how i tried: instaled AdriaRoute 4.10, used Garmin Keygen 1.5 entered my id, chose custom mapset, entered  708 id for adriaroute, genetared map unlock code, coppied that code and entered it in unlock wizard and unlocked but when i opened mapsource AdriaRoute was still locked. What am i doing wrong?"
,Ipmark,2013-03-11T02:20Z,"Check on Mapsource > Product Map Manager > Unlock Regions if the unlock code for AdriaRoute is present.
If not add it.

Second option:
Unlock the AdriaRoute installation folder with Garmin Unlocker or Unlock Mapsource tools and then crop the map you need."

,DennisOlof,2013-03-15T16:28Z,"Thanks. Now I can install mapsource and just generate the limited map for my internal memory in my garmin. A few years since I updated the maps.

Thanks."
,stpett3r,2013-04-24T00:28Z,does it have the waypoints? or should add it manually? thanks 4 sharing
,Ipmark,2013-04-29T06:03Z,"I think you are talking about POIs (Point Of Interest).
A lot of POIs are preinstalled and  it can't be removed, other types (speedcameras, fuel stations, ....) must be added manually."
