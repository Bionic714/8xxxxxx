,mike953100,2013-03-01T02:26Z,"@ THRobinson @jdcarna

YIFY audio is always 2.0.  Also, it is a matter of opinion about the audio, and I do agree that per usual audio is not very good.  It simply needs maybe 50MB for audio if that to just make it 128Kbps which should be standard for all audio.  Here is some INFO that YIFY left out:

Overall Bitrate: 2110 Kbps
Video: x264 (High@L4.0) @ 2010 Kbps
Audio: AAC 2-channel @ 96.0 Kbps (L, R)
Source: hobbit.an.unexpected.journey.2012.1080p.bluray.x264-sparks.mkv"

I have some of Yours 1080p Movies and they are really good. But I must say that hour Hobbit is not good. As wall as Your Life of Pi :O( I think that you and Your team should learn the Equation Size/image quality so that one day ALL Your 1080p will be good... One more thing, please could you mention when Your subtitles are for Death People (earring impaired) and they are most of the time..., it would be great.
Ps: you are great but you are not the best and not a God...
Thank you for Your time"

,defguysezhuh,2013-03-04T01:40Z,"@getabrain as one of those ""death"" people, I must say I find it offensive that you declared me to be earring impaired. I don't wear earrings, but I don't consider that to be an impairment.  All kidding aside, if you are trying to be politically correct, just stick with ""deaf"" or ""hard-of-hearing.""  The term ""hearing impaired"" is outdated, like ""deaf mute"" or ""deaf & dumb"".

@YIFY - thanks for the upload!"
,P4ssw0rd,2013-03-04T02:27Z,1920x800? Why dont you make 1920x1080 instead. I was thinking that your LED/LCD TV is 1920x800 only.. :-D
,EvilCorporateWhore,2013-03-04T03:28Z,"@P4ssw0rd

Because that's the way it was filmed. :/

The most common aspect ratios used in films are 1.85:1 and 2.39:1 @ 24fps, so, 1.85:1 at 24fps(in this case 48fps) is as close to the original source as you can get.

So, if you have 16:9 you would lose some of the picture. Or it would have to be up-scaled."

You're an idiot. 1920x800 is the true Cinema resolution. ALL movies made for cinemas are made for this aspect ratio. In order to have 1080 resolution, additional black bars (black unused pixels) are added.

,Deiradinn,2013-04-16T14:03Z,"Be warned ahead of time, all of YIFW's torrents will be drastically low and the audio will almost always been of less quality. Remember to turn your tv down after watching a YIFW movie, save your speakers. "
,Theonus,2013-04-19T19:25Z,"HI, I am having a problem with this torrent. I use BitTorrent for the program, and it gets about halfway through the download, when the bar goes from green to red and says ""error"" etc. Will using BitLord fix this? "

Well said. I agree 100%

@Jack-Purcell

You're an idiot and didn't get what mgman770 said. Why even have a search function then, if it doesn't matter that this is wrongly labeled? You could just browse aimlessly through torrents for hours until you find something you want. The point is that labeling this as HD is screwing up the search results. "
,tiz2,2013-04-27T19:34Z,"A: 5 v: 5, Not really hd, too low bit rate"
,maffti,2013-04-28T10:53Z,"@mgman770
""They make it extremely painful to search for truly HD material."" 

Yet i can with ease when searching for a specific movie find true HD quality uploads, get off your high horse you self entitled faggot, just avoid YIFYS torrents if it bothers you that much.

@praxiteles

Same as above."
,alexslife,2013-04-28T21:49Z,"For the average middle age balding man, YIFY movies that are 720p resolution yet DVD quality these would be fine...

For the rest of us who want quality and DTS surround....this is not up to my standards"
,oceanroar,2013-04-29T10:59Z,"I'm sorry, usually YIFY does okay quality for the file size... but calling this 1080p is a flat-out lie. By definition it must be 1920x1080 but this is 1920x800. 

I really wish there was a true 1080p section on TPB for people who value quality over small files, as the Top 100 'Hi-Res Movies' has been totally diluted with YIFY files, many of which are even sub-720p. 

I don't blame YIFY, I blame the uneducated users that simply see that it's in the HD Movie section or see that it's under 2GB and say to themselves ""Wow, so small! I can fit loads of these on my iPad"" and think that's good enough, not even knowing what a bitrate is. 

These things are going to look a little better than a DVD rip but they are definitely NOT ""Full HD"". 

If you're going to pirate movies you might as well do it properly and get something that looks GOOD. 

These YIFY videos are great those of you not living in a first world country who might have bandwidth caps or slow internet, however. "
,oceanroar,2013-04-29T11:04Z,"Also, it boggles my mind to see people rating 

V: 10
A: 10

Have you never seen a bluray? are you watching these things on your old CRT TV and stereo speakers which are so poor you can't tell the difference? 

I bet when 4K movies start coming out YIFY will be there saying ""4K everyone!"" when they actually look like 1080p. "

Rofl! A master troll you are, mate! Keep up the good work. I couldn't stop laughing for at least five minutes after reading your post.

As for the torrent, my thanks to YIFY."
,magee89,2013-06-03T14:55Z,"You know both sides have a point in this debate. This is not 1080p, not even close to being the same quality of the blu-ray disc that you would buy. 

The lack of surround sound doesn't really bother me but I find my self having to turn the volume up to max for YIFY movies.

Lastly, I'm not looking for true 1080p, it's file size would be too big and for me personaly, it's just not worth my time to download that and copy it to my PS3. I need to copy using PS3 media server because I use subtitles which triples the file size, so I would be copying a file thats like 60gb which would take all day.

With that said, for what I'm looking for, this is perfect which is why I would give it a 10/10. However, it should not be titled as 1080p because it's not even close."
