  Rhye is a low-key collaboration between two well-regarded producers, multi-instrumentalists, and vocalists: Denmark native Robin Braun (aka Robin Hannibal, member of Boom Clap Bachelors, Owusu & Hannibal, Parallel Dance Ensemble, and Quadron) and Canadian Mike Milosh (aka Milosh). In 2010, Hannibal contacted Milosh - who had released three albums on Plug Research, home to Quadron - about working on a remix. The meeting was more productive than anticipated and developed into the initially secretive project Rhye. Braun and Milosh connected with the Innovative Leisure label, where they released their first two singles - "Open" and "The Fall" - in 2012. The former was licensed for a Victoria's Secret commercial. After signing to Polydor in the U.K. (Loma Vista/Republic in the U.S.), they prepared their first album, Woman, which was released in March 2013. Milosh's soft, yearning voice made for an ideal match with Braun's elegant, organic/synthetic hybrid sound - a modern form of R&B-inspired sophisti-pop.
