,Demon_Gate,2013-03-15T20:24Z,Sorry but it doesn't work on the 40 hour limit think you can fix this?
,MassStash,2013-03-19T08:18Z,"Fantastic. Bought Pandora one to support the service surviving, but still prefer this version of the android app. Thank you sir. Oh, and how do you go over 40hrs??? Haha crazy "
,Skimpy007,2013-03-28T04:50Z,Sorry to say this second the only way I see to avoid the 40 hours is to switch to the 4.1 version 
,Demon_Gate,2013-05-09T02:32Z,That's fine by me :3
