,plagasx,2013-03-01T02:08Z,Will this work with the noSTEAM version???

See? I can post bullshit too. *EVERY* crack, keygen and fixed executable for damned nearly every game has ""Viruses"" in it. Why is this? Because they arbitrarily decided that all cracks and keygens and such are bad.

Reloaded does not post malware."
,bafakos76,2013-03-01T10:41Z,@ azam: virus??? by such a trusted uploader??? and with 800 seeders??????? noway
,Dimmis80,2013-03-01T10:42Z,Scene4all thanks a lot dude.It sure this game needs a patch or two..Anyways will this update will work well with the 2 previous crack fixes and will my save games be ok with this patch.I mean can i continue from the same place i saved my game.???
,niram07,2013-03-01T11:24Z,Its probably a false/positive (fake) virus. So there is nothing to worry about.
,riahc3,2013-03-01T11:36Z,Is this prepared for the Bolt Sniper and the final boss antipirate glitch?
,Cerebral222,2013-03-01T11:47Z,"Thanks S4A, works well, cheers.
@ This comes with the right crack for this update & works well; this will not mess up your current game saves. :)"
,bungunners,2013-03-01T11:49Z,A virus by definition is an executable that has been changed from its original purpose.  This is changed for the purpose that we don't have to pay the $60 asking price....Even though I personally DO think it would be worth it.  This game so far is damn good!
,Performer81,2013-03-01T13:13Z,DOesnt seem to work with the nosteam release or die anybody find out how?
,Performer81,2013-03-01T13:33Z,"Did something wrong, it works with nosteam release"
,doobtribe,2013-03-01T15:22Z,Apart from the medium detail settings optimizations it's a ridiculous huge update for so many minor fixes.
,Furious1964,2013-03-01T17:24Z,Will this fix the problem of not being able to kill the Alpha Ceph? It won't open its vulnerable spots.
,FieroGT,2013-03-01T19:29Z,any dx10 mods/patches yet? :)

,warfox101,2013-03-03T08:24Z,STILL NO OPTION FOR 1920X1080. game defaults the game back to 1200x720 after editing config.
,Drim009,2013-03-04T07:40Z,it's not a virus but it ain't a fix neither when at mission 2 you pick the ceph bolt sniper without any ammo and there is fuking nothing you can do then.
