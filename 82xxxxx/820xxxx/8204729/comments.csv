Thanks!"

Movist is a good app but doesn't allow you to use your Apple remote. VLC does all of this."
,wharfrat22,2013-03-01T04:25Z,this is 4.99 on the app store...just what i saw.
,wizh,2013-03-01T14:22Z,yeah . this is paid app
,ClubQBall,2013-03-01T14:22Z,"Exactly.

$4.99 ... not ""free"" as someone mentioned.

Thanks again, yoeluru."
