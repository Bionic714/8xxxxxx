,CrowZero,2013-03-01T07:41Z,"I heard a lot about this film,and thanks to you I am going to it tonight."
[V],JCinema,2013-03-01T08:13Z,"quatermassive: All I have is a vhs rip without subtitles. Was not planning to post it, should I do it anyway?"
,quatermassive,2013-03-02T12:35Z,"Even a VHS copy without subs would be much very appreciated. Thanks in advance!  [But I know that a copy with subs exists somewhere out there in the world, otherwise how else could I have watched it an art-house cinema in 1993]."
