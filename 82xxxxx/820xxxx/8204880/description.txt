Mel Torme also appears late in this, the 26th show of the 1967-1968 season
just one week after his previous appearance.  Of the several episodes I'm
missing that includes 2 with Barbara Eden, who was in the first 
Jerry Lewis Show with Merv Griffin and the 23rd episode as well.

However, this season finale is mostly a clip-fest...
