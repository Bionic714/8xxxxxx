Juggalos....Juggalettes...I bring to you...

Insane Clown Posse & Twiztid's "American Psycho Tour Documentary"

OFFICIAL RELEASE - FUCK THE FAKES!

Sup' ninjas and ninjettes! Whoop Whoop!

So for a while now this DVD has been out, and I've checked frequently for it to be uploaded. Apparently we don't have many Juggalos on top of shit, because at time that I bought this, I specifically did so, just so that I could make it availible here. So with that said...

This is the "American Psycho Tour Documentary"

I don't fuck around when it comes to DVDRips - This bitch is standard 700 MB, not some 1.2 GB phat bitch. 

Grab this biatch, copy it to a flash drive, and play it on your PC, Xbox, PS3 or whatever the fuck. If playing on your PC, I recommend you use VLC (http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html)

Hopefully, you enjoy it! Whoop Whoop!

Pure freshness. Download, Seed, ENJOY!
