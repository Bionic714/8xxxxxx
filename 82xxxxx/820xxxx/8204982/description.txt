Chiller is a two-issue, 1993 release for epic Comics by James Hudnall and John Ridgeway.


From Hudnall's website:

Brian Marx is a ΓÇ£Chaos WizardΓÇ¥ living in modern day New York, posing as an artist. When a mysterious group comes to him with a strange request, he undertakes a mission to save the country from a demon that was unleashed during the revolutionary war. But the people who hire him donΓÇÖt want it killed. They want to control it. And thatΓÇÖs where things really get out of hand. 

All praise to the creative team and original scanners.
