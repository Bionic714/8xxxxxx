Wackypedia says:

Crash Ryan is a four-issue comic book mini-series created by Ron Harris and published by Marvel Comics' Epic Comics line in 1984.

The story takes place in the mid-1930s, and details the fight between the United Airmen and their merciless foe "The Doom".

All praise to the creative team and original scanners.
