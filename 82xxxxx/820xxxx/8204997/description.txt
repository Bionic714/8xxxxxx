From the Pedia of Wiki:

Espers was an independent comic book series created and written by James D. Hudnall. It centered on a disparate group of people with various psychic powers who are brought together under duress and later coalesce as a team. Espers was published intermittently in the 1980s and 1990s by four different companies, including Eclipse, Marvel, and Image, and was re-numbered from issue 1 again each time.

This is the seven-issue run done for Image Comics in 1997, with Greg Horn providing artwork and covers. The TPB of the Eclipse series can be found here: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8197588/Espers_(epic_Comics). The epic Comics 'Interface' series is here: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8201824/Interface_(epic_Comics).

The six-issue, 1996 run done for Hudnall's own Halloween Comics is still needed. Image Comics also collected this run in the 1998 TPB, "Espers: Undertow". If anyone has it, PLEASE upload it!

As always, all praise to the creative team and original scanners.
