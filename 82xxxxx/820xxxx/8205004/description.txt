Just downloaded from European PSN, this is not the .pkg (I don't know how to copy it as it installs instantly), this is a copy of the folder where the DLC is installed, (/dev_hdd0/game), I guess it should work on any ps3 (if you have CFW, of course) if you require me to upload something else to make this work, just say it.

Maybe tomorrow I might be able to upload "Grey Fox" and Inferno armor skins

It would be cool if someone uploads the other two (BLES version).


Good Luck and have fun playing MGR!
