,KNiKNi,2013-03-12T19:37Z,"Hey Feastly i'm on CFW 3.41 Hermes, first i was download DUPLEX release, after i was download this EBOOT at this torrent : http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8204972/Tomb_Raider_(BLES01780)_(PROPER)_Fix_3.41_3.55_EBOOT_PATCH_PS3

But game don't start on APPHOME or DISC, black screen.

So i have download this (here) http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8205022/Tomb_Raider_(BLES01780)_Fix_3.41_3.55_Update_Patch_1.01

I was installed the TWO .PKG without removed the EBOOT from first TORRENT and the game launch and saving, but Playstation will crash if you quit the game.

Good Luck"
