TOMB RAIDER - BLES01780 - update 1.01 fix by opoisso893

1. First install official update 1.01 (INCLUDED!!!)

2. Then Patch: "BLES01780_A0101-341-355 by opoisso893 - NeedOfficial101.pkg"


Note : same as retail fix : when you quit to xmb the console restarts.

External with BD-mirror
For the moment only one problem : when you want to quit the game with PS button, the console beeps 3 times and restarts.


Thanks to opoisso893!
