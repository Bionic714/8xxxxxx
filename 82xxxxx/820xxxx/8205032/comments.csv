I have a recommendation question for you. I'm looking for some horror comics, maybe lesser-known ones, you might think would be worth checking out. I pick up all the main ones, but figured you would be a good person to ask.

BabiesDontNeedSpleens, i'm relatively mainstream so i don't know how much help i'll be, but here are a few excellent continuing series in the horror genre:
Locke and Key (IDW) - http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8145060/
Rachel Rising - (Abstract Studios) - http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7928331/
Revival (Image) - http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7456629/

and these are minis that were very good:
Chasing the Dead (IDW) - http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7825652/
Severed (Image) - http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7039137/
The Secret (Dark Horse) - http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7925783/

and there's a creepy as shit fantagraphics hardcover called ""the hidden"". i'll put that in my next torrent of graphic novels.

if you like old comics, you might try these 1970s marvel titles:

I love how this area of PB is a collection of what the place should be, unique to not only the site but the web in my opinion.
