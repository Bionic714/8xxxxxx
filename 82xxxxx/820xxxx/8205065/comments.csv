[T],azpieusk,2013-03-01T02:31Z,Thanks Seeders!!
,lightisdark,2013-03-01T09:34Z,Is the text in English? Like when it's showing you from past and future.. Basically what im asking is this from a Russian source like the others?
[T],azpieusk,2013-03-01T13:37Z,"Yes, source is the same, but are very few text (10 lines) in movie. For English you can use this subs: http://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/4747675/cloud-atlas-en"
,dandalis,2013-03-01T13:42Z,is this the proper one or russian release ?
,w00tbie,2013-03-09T05:44Z,"really awesome film, i watched it last night and holy crap, tears. this story speaks to the soul. but somewhat more prosaically.. can anyone tell me which upload is *not* from the russian release blueray? i've been looking and they all seem to be based on the same source. i don't usually mind bits of some other language getting into the experience, but just really want to see this again and be able to read the location/date visual text and the credits as intended, not relying on subs. does anyone know? and thanks!
