BBC Royal Institution Christmas Lectures 2012 The Modern Alchemist (3 parts) xvid

these are a yearly great lecture on different topics in UK aimed at high school
kids and laypersons level of understanding you can also understand the complex
subjects they introduce,, this one is about turning lead in to gold and
the idea of living forever with anti-aging chemicals
with great DEMOS throughout

THIS IS NOT MY RIP as you can see some nob defaced the intro for a few seconds 
at least the antis will know the next site to target and shutdown (drip)
its minor though not worth re-encoding to rid it with a delogo-er

however they
are much smaller then existing versions out there

I however fixed the header and RESYNC the audio as all were -200ms out! 
and renamed them properly

The medieval alchemists made elements react to create magnificent shows, 
enthralling kings and commoners alike, but their secrets were never revealed 
until now. 

In the first of this year's Christmas Lectures, Dr Peter Wothers explores what 
the alchemists knew about the air we breathe and reveals how our modern 
knowledge of these elements can be used to control fire, defy gravity and 
harness the power of a lightning storm. Peter is joined by the cast of the 
musical Loserville and is helped in his exploration of the 118 modern elements 
by a periodic table made from audience members at the Royal Institution.



Medieval alchemists wrote of a mysterious fountain of youth, whose waters could 
rejuvenate anyone who drank them. But can water really be magical? 

In the second of this year's Christmas Lectures, Dr Peter Wothers drinks from 
the fountain and finds out whether the elements lurking in the water can 
restore his youth. Along the way he discovers how exploding balloons could 
solve the energy crisis, how water contains the remains of the most violent 
reactions on Earth and that the real secret to eternal youth might be drinking 
no water at all. 

Peter is joined in his quest by Paralympic champion cyclist Mark Colbourne and 
finds out what happens when the two most reactive elements on the periodic 
table, caesium and fluorine, meet each other.

       The Philosopher's Stone 2012
 
For centuries alchemists have tried to turn base metals into gold. But is such 
a feat even possible? 

In the final Christmas Lecture, Dr Peter Wothers explores the elements within 
the earth and discovers just how difficult it is for chemists to extract the 
planet's greatest treasures. He discovers how our knowledge of the elements can 
allow us to levitate, turn carbon dioxide into diamonds and maybe turn lead 
into gold. 

Peter is joined by Nobel Prize-winning chemist Professor Sir Harry Kroto and 
together they find out whether a member of the audience is really worth their 
weight in gold and what happens when you set fire to a diamond.
