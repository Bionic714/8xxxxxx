,sealedsaint,2013-03-02T05:55Z,No one beats extremezone..
,highresjunkie,2013-03-02T10:28Z,"I'm not sure why people are going on and on about how great this encode is when 1) its encoded using an obsolete (XviD) format instead of x264 and 2) the bitrate and file size is 3x what it needs to be. In x264 you can get a 480p down to 3-500megs with no loss in quality. Granted, XviD requires around 65% higher bitrate to match the quality of x264, but even then the bitrate here is overkill for this resolution."
,ian-d,2013-03-02T17:10Z,"Have a agree, whilst everyone no doubt appreciates the efforts the extremezone team go to, there is no doubting that the film sizes and quality are very poor. Compare this 480p 1.8gb file against yify's 1080p 1.9gb file, http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8205618/Life_of_Pi_%282012%29_1080p_BrRip_x264_-_YIFY, I know which I'd pick!!!"

,James5.5,2013-05-17T01:16Z,What a crap piece of shit..!  There is no plot or anything. Can't believe they made such a big thing about this junk..  Terrible waste of time to watch this...
