,mongylloyd,2013-05-20T14:00Z,The quality of the video is good. Hard subtitles have spelling mistakes and grammatical errors. Choice of font is ok but could have been better. White serif with black outline. Thanks anyway.
,mongylloyd,2013-05-20T14:34Z,The spelling mistakes are really bad. Nothing wrong with hard coded subtitles... but these are annoying. I'm going to look for a better torrent.
