please start seeding your torrents and stop creating more until there are sufficient seeders.

At the moment MOST of your torrents have no seeders and have not been obtained by anyone 100%. Your reputation (if you ever had one) is sinking fast."

Someone came on and seeded for a few minutes b/c I managed to get 3Mb in the last 24 hours. It's just a matter of principal now that I feel like I should seed to the rest of the poor 68 leaches connected to me. Other uploaders take note, this is how to NOT upload content (ie zero initial seeding time)."
