"Pendulum"

With a renewed determination to find Laila, 
Hank returns from India, searching for new 
clues while Laila, who is being held hostage 
by White Vincent, is tasked with repairing 
the next clock for him. Knowing she needs to 
help Hank find her, she starts leaving a 
trail of clues for him to follow. In another 
face-to-face showdown with White Vincent, 
Hank begins to realize there is more to this 
connection than meets the eye -- or in this 
case White Vincent's eyes. Meanwhile, Hank's 
parents seem to be hiding a secret, and with 
help from the FBI, Hank, Arron and Rachel 
discover that a famous historical figure 
holds the key to unlocking the next clock.
