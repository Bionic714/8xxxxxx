"To the Ranch"

When unable to make a decision about who 
to nominate to the Supreme Court, 
President Dale Gilchrist decides to take 
a family trip to their ranch to clear 
his head. During their getaway, Skip 
finds himself moping over his failed 
relationship, while Becca contemplates 
major flaws in her own relationship. 
Meanwhile, Emily attempts to spend some 
quality time with Marigold and Xander, 
who both struggle with their loss of 
technology while at the ranch.
