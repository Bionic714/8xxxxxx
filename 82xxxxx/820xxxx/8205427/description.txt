Summer 1943. Two of the AlliesΓÇÖ most important plans for winning World War II are at grave riskΓÇöOperation OverlordΓÇÖs invasion of France, and the Manhattan ProjectΓÇÖs race to build the atomic bomb. A furious FDR turns to OSS spy chief Wild Bill DonovanΓÇöand Donovan turns to his top agent, Dick Canidy, and his team. TheyΓÇÖve certainly got their work cut out for them.

In the weeks to come, they must fight not only the enemy in the fieldΓÇöincluding figuring out how to sabotage GermanyΓÇÖs new ΓÇ£aerial torpedoΓÇ¥ rocketsΓÇöbut the enemy within: Someone is feeding Manhattan Project secrets to the Soviets. Moles are bad enough. But if the Soviets build their own atomic bomb . . . who knows where that might lead?
