Four-issue, 1993-1994 series for epic Comics written by John Miller and illustrated by Floyd Hughes.

According to some guy trying to sell the complete series on Amazon... "Sleeper horror title - FANTASTIC Stuff! Artist Floyd Hughes ROCKS! Story ties together the legends of Robert Johnson, Billy the Kid and Marie Laveau!"

Praise be unto the creative team and original scanners.
