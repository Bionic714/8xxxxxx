,Getabrain,2013-03-03T17:50Z,"Hi Yify,
 I have some of yours 1080p Movies and they are really good. But I must say that hour Life of Pi is not good. As wall as Your Hobbit :O( I think that you and Your team should learn the Equation Size/image quality so that one day ALL Your 1080p will be good... One more thing, please could you mention when Your subtitles are for Deaf People (hearring impaired) and they are most of the time..., it would be nice.
 Ps: you are great but you are not the best and not a God...
 Thank you for Your time "

Have a nice day."
,DIEleechy,2013-03-05T20:50Z,"I'm guessing this is a screener copy? Since it has yet to be released on disc. And missing subs?
Would be nice if more info was given my uploader and/or comments made?"
,nageeK,2013-03-07T21:06Z,"Thanks, always got good quality."

,mars4,2013-03-18T01:23Z,"Hi! Would anyone know where I can get Chinese subtitles for this?

Anyway, thanks for this! Viewed this in the theater and loved it, so downloaded while waiting on the inevitable Blu-Rays to arrive in R3! Superb work YIFY!
"
,leligal,2013-03-18T12:43Z,"Thanks Yify, video has amazing quality, but audio seems a little weak. "
,Meadows_zeta,2013-04-07T21:36Z,"How dare you compress 1080p to under 2 GiB. I want to watch a film, not a collection of visual artifacts. Oh well, I guess I'll download it elsewhere."
,piizda,2013-04-10T19:55Z,Yeah something is not right with picture if you compare to original.
,akhnaten,2013-04-23T09:08Z,A/9:V/10...thanks again
,mohawkm,2013-04-25T15:30Z,Good Quality considering the size of the file.  Sucks that subtitles are missing when other languages are spoken.  
,andyfukinj,2013-05-09T09:20Z,"Since all these fool loser-ass spammers were talking shit on YIFY's uploads  ( My personal favorite uploader of good stolen movies) , I thought I would let everyone on here know there is actually a YIFY website out there you can download from......"
,Kona_Guy,2013-05-13T02:26Z,"NOT BLURAY, THIS IS COMPRESSED SHIT. STILL OK QUALITY BUT NOT BLURAY! WHY THE FUCK DO YOU NAME YOUR TORRENTS BLURAY ASSHOLE? I WANT TO STICK A BURNING STICK IN YOUR FAGGOT ASS YOU FUCKING RESTARTED MONKEY!"
,gamer13_,2013-05-13T11:46Z,"The subs that blugoo linked to were updated so his link doesn't work anymore. Here's the current link:

,Buzzbee1974,2013-05-18T14:32Z,thanks gamer13_ for the subs
,Ironmaiden2013,2013-05-24T02:14Z,"Anyone who talks shit and insults YIFY like KONA GUY should be put to death. Dude this guy does all this uploads for free and not only that, he doesn't have to do it for you and yet he spends countless hours everyday to bring you free movies and yet you and other people insult one of the best torrent uploaders in the net. I wish there was a way to ban people or IP addresses from ungrateful assholes like you. If you want a perfect movie go fucking buy it you cheap piece of shit and dont even fucking come here looking for them. Sorry for my language but people like you and others who just don't appreciate the hard work that people like YIFY does pisses me off so much I just can't let it go without making a comment about it. YIFY keep the good work, you are the best and don't listen to idiots like KONA GUY and others who insult your work. If they don't like the movies here, look people. GO AND FUCKING BUY THE DAMN MOVIE AND STOP BITCHING AND COMPLAINING. Thank you YIFY"
,darryl66,2013-06-03T08:59Z,"@Ironmaiden2013

first off encoding movies takes no time at all.  you literally put a disc in a drive, name the output file and click a saved preset for the quality of the movie you would like and chose the audio track.  all in all it is less then one minute of work for anyone who has used handbrake before.  yify doesnt suck because he makes low quality rips (to each their own), he sucks because he he tags and names his movies incorrectly thereby spamming the whole hd sections front page.  i dont think anyone would have a problem with his lofi rips if he labeled them correctly and put them in the right section.  yify is a TROLL. if you cant see that you are blind."
