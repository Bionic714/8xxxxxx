From the sages of Wikipedia:

The Shadowline Saga is a comic book imprint from Epic Comics that was published in its original incarnation from 1988 to 1990. It was created and edited by Archie Goodwin.

The Shadowline Saga was Marvel's first attempt at creating a mature-themed line of superhero comics. Further, it was the first line produced by Epic Comics utilizing a pre-conceived shared universe concept. The central concept tied all of the titles together, allowing them to serve as one unified crossover. The line could either be read as individual title(s) or the entire line of titles could tell a much broader story when read together chronologically.

The original line of The Shadowline Saga titles included Doctor Zero, Power Line, and St. George - all ran eight issues. Doctor Zero, Power Line, and St. George #9 - 13 were supposed to be part of The Shadowline Saga "Critical Mass" Crossover. Due to poor sales, Epic cancelled the three Shadowline series and published the story in an anthology format as the Critical Mass limited series.

Praise be to the creative teams and the scanners.
