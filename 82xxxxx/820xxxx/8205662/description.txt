All of these songs were ripped from the official concert video, and converted to mp3 format (good for ipod listening, and removes the video content, its all audio.) At least 25 of these songs are in english. Also, I added cover art to every song to spice things up.Please let me know if I did anything wrong and how to fix it, this is my first torrent, and I have no clue what I'm doing. I hope these songs help to hold you guys over until persona 5, or persona 3: the movie. If there are any other persona concerts that you guys want to get a similar treatment, link me to them and I'll do my best. Also, if the concerts aren't persona-related, I'll check them out, and if I have time/like them, I'll do it. To anyone from atlus who may wind up seeing this torrent, I'm sorry for distributing your work, but you weren't selling this content, and the concert's on youtube for free anyway. A lot of us are persona-starving (your fault for making a great series and getting us addicted) and I hope you guys release persona 5 and persona 3: the movie soon. All this content was already out there, the only thing changed is the format. To anyone who downloads this torrent and seeds, thanks a lot!
