Is there a special reaaon that this must be a rar file?
Rar files are the best way to spread viruses. People don't trust them. Can you re-encode this in a safer format?"
,Wolfashin,2013-03-05T01:30Z,"It's in RAR because it's password-protected, and to get a password you need to go to link provided and complete some stupid generic survey.
Not doing that, F you."
