Minimos-NT is a general-purpose semiconductor device simulator providing steady-state, transient, and small-signal analysis of arbitrary two and three dimensional device geometries. In mixed-mode device and circuit simulation, numerically simulated devices can be embedded in circuits consisting of compact device models and passive elements.

Minimos-NT is integrated with a state-of-the-art TCAD Framework. A comprehensive set of physical models enables the user to simulate various kinds of advanced device structures, such as present-day CMOS devices, silicon-on-insulator devices, and hetero-structure devices. Taking into account atomistic traps and dopants, MINIMOS-NT allows reliability and variability modeling of highly scaled transistors such as bulk planar devices silicon-on-insulator FinFETs with a channel length down to 22 nm and below.
