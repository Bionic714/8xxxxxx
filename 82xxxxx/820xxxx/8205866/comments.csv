,Pavlezzz,2013-03-01T12:33Z,N00by Question: Is this a single game or a DLC or a Addon?
,moeburn1,2013-03-01T14:59Z,"You forgot to mention:  THIS IS A STANDALONE GAME.   Sniper Elite V2 is NOT required!  So for everyone out there like me, who uninstalled V2 and deleted the ISO a long time ago, never fear!  Nazi zombies are here!"
,MrMoolah,2013-03-01T16:01Z,Can we play multiplayer on this crack?
,Mymaqn,2013-03-01T19:00Z,"The game crashes after the Rebellion and Nazi Zombie Army logo pops up. Is there any fix to this? 

Thank you!"
,haribz,2013-03-01T19:54Z,"Game was crashing for me after it got to Nazi Zombie Army page, so I disconnected from the the internet and it works fine :)"
,peninha1975,2013-03-02T10:20Z,This is a scary game.for me to be able to play i had to run the game as an administrator or it wouldn't start.thks for the upload
,vomega,2013-03-02T17:33Z,ok i installed it but only problem is there is no sound. any ideas on how to fix?
,vomega,2013-03-02T17:42Z,"im getting no sound, anybody else?"
,Fluid56,2013-03-02T20:54Z,no you cannot play multiplayer ever on any crack. 
,FieroGT,2013-03-03T21:54Z,"AFTER OPENING LOGO BLACK SCREEN / CRASH FIX:
I had the same problem, here is how to fix it...
Start the game, and right when the Rebellion logo comes up, 
hit ALT-ENTER, to make a window, the game will continue to load, 
then once u get to the main menu, u can hit alt-enter again to go back to full screen.
I have to do this just about every time I want to play..... 
(but not always.... its quite odd that way...)

Good Luck! "
