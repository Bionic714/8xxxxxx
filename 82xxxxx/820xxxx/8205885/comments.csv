,Phenom100,2013-03-01T12:21Z,"@Zen Bud: the 5.1 audio has been made from 384 to 192? ok that's fine but pls keep the video @ 1800+kbps like ur previous 20 encodes. With 1800 Video bitrate ur rips such as Skyfall, ARGO< Terminator, Schindler's List were all awesome with crisp quality view. Pls let the video be same on the otehr hand 192 kbps is legit for audio.

- Warm Regards"
