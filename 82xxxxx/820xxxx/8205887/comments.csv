,Ipmark,2013-03-23T20:56Z,"One is the torrent of the full European map, the other is the torrent of a ""mosaic"" of smaller maps of the same release.
Smaller maps may be a bit faster in position update during the movements, especially with many old Garmin GPS models, and they can't manage maps larger than 2GB in size too."
,hardware13,2013-03-27T23:56Z,Works beautifully (nuvi 205W)! Thank you!
