and yes, they are interesting.  He did alot of those while waiting for letters to come in.  It turns out that Marvel made him do this series in answer to DC's Kamandi which he also did, but when his books at marvel did not do well, he then went on to animation and storyoarding, got the benefits he wanted for his family, and was much happier!!!!"
