The Randi Rhodes Show 


Yesterday the Voting Rights Act underwent some very hostile questioning from the Supreme CourtΓÇÖs conservative justices. The conservatives on the Supreme Court donΓÇÖt seem to think that the Voting Rights Act is doing any good. I think the problem is with what the conservatives on the Supreme Court consider to be ΓÇ£good.ΓÇ¥ They certainly canΓÇÖt mean that the Voting Rights Act doesnΓÇÖt do any good in guaranteeing voting rights for minorities, because it certainly does. They must just not think thatΓÇÖs a very good thing.

During questioning, Justice Antonin Scalia asked if the Voting Rights Act hadnΓÇÖt become a ΓÇ£perpetuation of racial entitlement.ΓÇ¥ If you strip away the legal language, Scalia was asking ΓÇ£Do we really want black people voting?ΓÇ¥ I think Antonin Scalia is in the wrong kind of robe. He should trade in his judicial robes for something in white with a pointy top that covers the head, with eyeholes cut out. The observers in the courtroom gasped when Scalia said that. Please donΓÇÖt do that, people. It just eggs him on.

Bob Woodward is saying that the White House threatened him over a piece he wrote claiming that President Obama lied about creating the sequester. Bob Woodward has had some big scoops in the past, but this isnΓÇÖt one of them. This is the kind of ΓÇ£big scoopΓÇ¥ that you put into a plastic baggie and throw away at the dog park. Now Woodward says the White House ΓÇ£threatenedΓÇ¥ him in an email. What the White House aide actually wrote in the email was ΓÇ£I think you will regret staking out that claim.ΓÇ¥ The White House aide obviously meant the phrase to mean ΓÇ£you will look like a fool.ΓÇ¥ I base that belief on the fact that Bob Woodward does in fact look like a fool now. WoodwardΓÇÖs story is a pile of crap. How can you be sure? HeΓÇÖs going on Sean HannityΓÇÖs show to whine about it.

In the face of sequester budget cuts, immigration officials have released hundreds of detainees from detention centers. Or as Fox News put itΓÇöObama has unleashed his Hispanic Rape Army. Back in the real world, the detainees are being freed on supervised release while their cases continue in court. If this is a threat to anyone, itΓÇÖs a threat to the prison contractors who make a fortune from locking these people up. The bottom line is that these people should not have been released nowΓÇöthey should have been released years ago.
