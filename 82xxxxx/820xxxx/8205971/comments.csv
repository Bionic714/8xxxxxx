,canc232,2013-03-07T19:06Z,Its not fake...If you are getting a green screen means your players are ancient. Try downloading the new pot player or MPC HC.
,Lilpirate123,2013-03-08T18:55Z,okay I'll check these options. I use VLC by the way. Thanks anyway.
,canc232,2013-03-09T20:14Z,"Yeaaah..about that..VLC doesn't completely support 10 bit, with its nightly builds and all. If you want to get the best possible quality out of a 10 bit video, configure your MPC HC or kmplayer or pot player with madVR. Google it for a how to!"
