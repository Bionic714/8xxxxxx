The flute-like voice of IrelandΓÇÖs Heidi Talbot is a fine instrument. Every word is clear, each note hit, yet itΓÇÖs no bragging perfection. Her tones still have a whispering undertow to them.
She has been around for a while: this is her fifth album as a solo artist, and she has also recorded and performed with the Irish-American collective, Cherish the Ladies. Talbot is a schooled singer, and also a capable ukulele player.
But the title Angels Without Wings seems curiously inappropriate for an album that doesnΓÇÖt have much of the gritty or the earthbound in it.
While the lyrics usually tell of lost or rickety love, TalbotΓÇÖs mesmerizing voice and John McCuskerΓÇÖs velvety production often, perhaps unconsciously, smoothes out the messy feelings she explores.
At points thereΓÇÖs a distance to this album, a mannered approach, and the songsΓÇÖ emotional hearts often feel bypassed. But on the song that she does riddle with feeling, Dearest Johnny, Talbot is majestic.
She retains a tinkling precision here, but the overall sound is freer, aptly reflecting the traditional origins of the song. Buoyed by banjo, fiddle and accordion, her voice transmits both anguish and pride, beautifully inhabiting her character.
The other problem with Angels Without Wings is guest overdose. Although the Mark Knopfler and Boo Hewerdine guitar support is a good fit ΓÇô particularly HewerdineΓÇÖs sensitive work on My Sister The Moon, a track he also penned ΓÇô the vocal spots are less consistent.
On Button Up, the Scottish cadence of King Creosote chimes well, but on Wine and Roses Tim OΓÇÖBrien seems shoehorned in. This happens repeatedly: Talbot is getting on very well with a song and the introduction of a new voice halfway through breaks the mood.
ItΓÇÖs particularly inappropriate on the break-up track IΓÇÖm Not Sorry ΓÇô a solo lyrical theme if ever there was one ΓÇô when Guy Fletcher pipes up.
Angels Without Wings is as downy as TalbotΓÇÖs voice. ThatΓÇÖs not a compliment ΓÇô nor, in fact, is it an insult. For while some of this album is beautiful and delicate, at other times its vocal and musical honey smothers the intimacy of the lyrics.
Talbot could have buried a few more stingers in the nectar.
