it's also an interesting footnote that when marvel president terry stewart was confronted by todd mcfarlane, jim lee, rob liefeld and the gang in '91 or '92, stewart offered to give them the entire epic line for the creator-owned books they wanted to do. they balked and literally walked to a meeting with malibu graphics to launch image comics.
