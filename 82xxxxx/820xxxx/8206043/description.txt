Y'know, I can't really find much information regarding this line, so I'm gonna wing it:

It was the 1990's and epic Comics took a close look at what was selling, pondered a good 30 seconds, and decided to get into the grim-and-gritty, action-oriented business. They made a list of necessities, then set about filling them: gritted teeth; outsized torsos; extreme shirtlessness; breasts the size of Goodyear blimps; physically-impossible poses; giant guns that fired smaller guns that fired chainsaws, and; enough cross-hatching to to cause Image Comics to file a plagarism suit. Add it together and you got a blood-spattering coughing-fit from the soon-to-die epic imprint.

Your mileage may vary.

Still, there was some nice talent involved, including Howard Chaykin (Midnight Men), Mike Baron (Spyke and Feud), Mike Vosburg (Offcastes), Peter David & George Perez (Sachs and Violens), Ron Lim (Dragon Lines) and even the great Joe Kubert doing writing and art chores on a four-issue run of Tor.

So, oil your mullet, pull up your pastel bean-bag and crank up the grunge music. It's the 90's, bitches!

All hail the creative teams and original scanners.
