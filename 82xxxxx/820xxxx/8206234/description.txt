For my money, Avital is one of the most exciting musicians to come onto the
jazz scene in the last 20 years. His live shows are pure joy, with the
Israeli-born bassist bobbing, weaving, whooping and playing a rhythmic
blur. HeΓÇÖs locked into his music with an intensity and purpose that is rare and
beautiful. On Live At Smalls, we catch Avital and his quintet at one of New
York CityΓÇÖs best clubs at presenting the next generation of jazz. Before
talking about the music, weΓÇÖve got to address the bandΓÇöAvishai Cohen on
trumpet, Jason Lindner on piano, Joel Frahm on tenor sax and Jonathan Blake on
drums. Each of these artists is fantastic in his own right. Together, theyΓÇÖre
on fire. Now, for the music. All eight tracks are Avital originals. They are
stunning for their drive, beautiful horn lines and fine improvisation. ItΓÇÖs the
whole package. ΓÇ£Theme For A Brighter FutureΓÇ¥ leads off the recording with a
soulful groove. ΓÇ£Magic CarpetΓÇ¥ scorches the earth with stinging solos and
interplay between Avital, Frahm and Cohen. AvitalΓÇÖs bass intro into ΓÇ£Anthem For
LifeΓÇ¥ shows his deep understanding of soul musicΓÇöbe it Middle Eastern,
classical, or the blues-driven American variety. And the closing number,
ΓÇ£(ΓÇªJust Some) Small Time Shit,ΓÇ¥ leads you back around to a great groove and a
laugh with the band singing the songΓÇÖs title. This is hard-driving jazz with a
new soul for a new era.
