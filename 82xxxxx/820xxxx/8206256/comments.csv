,GTX460,2013-03-01T11:30Z,"Yea, true...Can you get 1.11 patch for Sniper Elite V2?"
,shauwy1978,2013-03-01T13:57Z,"Waou fuck sniper elite V2 it's a good game but Sniper Elite Nazi Zombie Army is just AWESOME :=)

,RMJ113,2013-03-01T14:17Z,"thisgame has 4 player coop in ""tunngle"" with green luma , invites"
,GTX460,2013-03-01T15:29Z,You dont need tunngle...
,MikeTheGreek,2013-03-01T15:45Z,How we will play then coop GTX460??without Tunngle or Greenluma.By the way.....SEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED
,GTX460,2013-03-01T16:39Z,you need greenluma and activated friends mod on steam...my eng suck...
,Kimeraz,2013-03-01T17:59Z,"GTX460: But in my own opinion Tunngle is better. It have walkthroughs, and guides for each game how you ""crack"" it to work so you can play Co-op or MP. And a chat for each game aswell. so you can easy find players for that game you like to play! "
,GTX460,2013-03-01T22:07Z,"i haved tunngle 1 year and sev2 1.05 and 1.07 and still those noobs did never come to play that patch or even instal and they haved instruction on tunngle.So,what is the point???And now im waiting them with patch 1.11...where are they???They still play those 2 maps Jesus Christ!!!"
,Heretic21,2013-03-02T07:57Z,"@GTX460 ""activated friends mod?"" what is that? also if you dont need tunggle to play how does it work? anyone confirm it actually works and has played? Personally i havent been able to figure out how to get Greenluma to work. is it just me or anyone else? could someone point me in a direction?"
,Rideredder,2013-03-02T11:27Z,Does anyone else get lag when you pull up the sniper scope?
,GTX460,2013-03-03T01:34Z,"Rideredder, Go to options/display/advanced display options/turn off reduce mouse lag"
,GTX460,2013-03-03T01:36Z,@Heretic21 read tunngle wiki...you have everything there...
,GTX460,2013-03-03T01:48Z,@Rideredder Go to options/display/advanced display options/and turn off reduce mouse lag
,rojeel,2013-03-03T17:24Z,"hello my game jsut stop and crashes when im going to klick on ""Singel player why"" ??

,skotosa,2013-03-03T18:37Z,Can your legit steam account get banned with Greenluma?  What are the risks and how can one be safe when using it? 
,IAMBBMK,2013-03-03T23:27Z,This doesn't seem to work... The moment I launch the game I hear music for a split second and then It just crashes. I tried reinstalling and that didn't work. What should I do now? D:
,GTX460,2013-03-04T12:09Z,Read tunngle forum for fixes...
