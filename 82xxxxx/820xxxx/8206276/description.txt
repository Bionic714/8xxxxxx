Description :

Drug smuggling is big business for Hong Kong's triad gangs and Wei Shen's longtime friend Dr Tang has created the wheels to give the Sun On Yee the edge over their rivals. A weaponised supercar, the prototype DZS-90 will give Wei Shen enough armour and firepower to take control of business. Seize the streets back from the 18K with a series of upgrades and add-ons available on completion of each mission, building into the ultimate supercar available both in missions and in the open world.
