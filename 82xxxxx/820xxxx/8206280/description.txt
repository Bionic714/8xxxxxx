A BBC interview with George MacDonald Frazer(1925 - 2008), author of the Flashman series of novels. A must listen for Flashman fans and an insight to the origin of Flashmans character.

and also interestingly.... 

"America just didn't get it." As Fraser recalled in an interview; "when Flashman appeared in the US in 1969, one-third of 40-odd critics accepted it as a genuine historical memoir. 'The most important discovery since the Boswell Papers,' is the one that haunts me still ... I was appalled ... I'd never supposed that it would fool anybody."
