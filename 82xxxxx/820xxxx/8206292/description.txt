This is the first day of a 5 day week with the Lennons co-hosting 
with Mike Douglas. I don't have the other 4 episodes.

Also with consumer advocate Ralph Nader, whom John Lennon suggested run
for President (years later he would -- 5 times !!)

The interview with comedian Louis Nye is actually cut off.  I'm not sure
if that's the fault of the person who recorded this show or not, but 
he was unusually boring...so maybe that's a good thing!

This episode runs 66 minutes, since Mike Douglas had a 90 minute time slot.
