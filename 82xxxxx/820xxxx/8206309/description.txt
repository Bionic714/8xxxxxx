This book makes the case that - contrary to conventional wisdom - human evolution has *not* slowed down, but rather accelerated as a result of civilization developing.

The result has led to massive changes between different groups of people.

In the final chapter, discussion about how medieval evolution made Ashkenazi 
Jews relatively intelligent compared to other ethnic groups is covered (they score 112 on average on IQ tests). This chapter will be especially of interest to anyone wondering if a hereditary element exists for intelligence.



To gain a better understanding of how different groups of humans have transformed in the last 10,000 years, this book is a must read.
