,thegamer,2013-03-01T12:39Z,"Hi Murphy78, I downloaded your last windows 7 and I'm very impressed with it I've installed it on a couple of computers and a couple of laptops and once done it comes up with the make of the computer motherboard or laptop as a desktop screen very nice, WELL DONE M8
keep up the goodwork.

,neilzzz01,2013-03-01T14:34Z,"Great Job mate for the update!
Well, Hope to see also the Windows 8 AIO DaRT8 USB3 IE10 NET45 from you soon, but necessarily this Feb2013 or March2013, Im still using your Windows 8 AIO 18in1 en-US DaRT8 Jan2013, and its awesome!"

[V],murphy78,2013-03-01T14:43Z,"win8 already has usb3, ie10, and net45 by default, but I'll make a good one with net2-3.5.1 support, toss in the newer defender updates, and do everything offline with dism just like I did with this one.  I'm pretty happy with the way this turned out. The size is small, all things considered, and there's no junk data that gets created during a sysprep.

It's like I said on my vista AIO, I'll probably just stick to offline dism integration for everything. Consider the win7ultsp1 and win8pro for feb2013 kind-of a fluke. They should technically work just fine, but I don't like capturing images with junk data.  Win8's cleanmgr does a good job of cleaning up any downloaded updates, but win7 doesn't. They both don't seem to delete the admin account afterward.

anyhow, got sleep to try and make up."
,Sonic_27,2013-03-01T16:02Z,Sweet....Thanks =)
,BlackDragontc,2013-03-01T19:38Z,Thank you for this release!!
[V],murphy78,2013-03-01T19:39Z,"I think one of the USB drivers is actually Etron, not Entron. It's just a typo, there's nothing wrong with the actual drivers."
,s_t_o_r_m,2013-03-01T20:23Z,"Hi murphy78, I see that you are doing a good job here. I have a question. Is there a way to change or add other language? This Windows is in English. What I had to do, to have it in Polish?"
[V],murphy78,2013-03-01T21:15Z,"I'm not sure exactly if/how you would do it for most of the indexes, but I believe you can download languages in windows update on ultimate and enterprise and then just change the language from control panel.

I've tried many times to release non-english stuff and people just don't download them very much. Partly because I cannot really advertise everything in the native language, and partly because it just isn't as popular.

If the add language thing works for you, great. If not, you can always try your hand at integration. You can use offline methods or audit mode / sysprep.  I think there is pretty much every language RTM on full-packs_com"
,_viruzz_,2013-03-01T21:32Z,"@s_t_o_r_m

you can always install windows 7 ultimate then download language pack from updates, or install the windows 7 version you want and use Vistalizator to change to the language you want.

,alvester,2013-03-02T12:43Z,"Hi there Murphy. I wanted to install this release ""Windows 8 Pro VL x64 Perm Re-Activation Feb2013"" in UEFI mode. So I changed my boot mode from Legacy to UEFI in BIOS. But it didn't boot from USB. I did a little bit of research and found that you need to boot from FAT32 formatted USB while Windows 7 USB Tool formats it NTFS. Since FAT32 supports file less than 4GB and this release consists of a file more than 4GB, I ended up formatting my USB Drive with exFAT format and it still boot from it. Can you please help me with this. Awaiting response. Thanks"
,alvester,2013-03-02T14:29Z,@scoalait I know how to install windows from usb. I just don't know how to get it ready to install it in uefi mode.
,extracube,2013-03-03T17:07Z,"Question for uploader and anyone / everyone else.  I wonder what would happen if you installed this OS, then after a few weeks changed your motherboard (to a different brand -- i.e. from gigabyte to Asus), as well as graphix card.  Would the OS mess up / crash, or would it autoload under the new intro screen to the changed brand?"
,MicahA,2013-03-03T19:53Z,"Can you give me a walk through on how to do this? I'm new to installing operating systems. Also what is KMS? like i said, I'm fairly new to this."

,david-lynch,2013-03-05T22:19Z,"Huge thanks for such a great work, murphy78! :)

Could someone please tell us where to find a good tutorial on how to prepare a USB flash drive to use this image?

Thanks!"
,russianhornybear,2013-03-07T10:44Z,"@ david-lynch 
Just install Microsoft Windows 7 USB DVD tool and push next..
@murphy78
I think if Win 7 or 8 installed on formatted partitions w/o hidden recovery 300mb thingy ,will be no DART and so on. Need to use DVD or USB to be able to access it?"
,humannature,2013-03-07T11:35Z,"Hi!
Would you tell me please, how to split this iso in only one x64 edition iso to fit  on a blank 4.7 DVD?
Thank you so much  in advance !"

Thank you :)

@ humannature:
I would like to know that, too :)"
,mrthuvi,2013-03-11T05:30Z,"THANK YOU, murphy78. I only created this account to say thank you. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK MAN! "
[V],murphy78,2013-03-11T13:07Z,"I'm starting to get the UEFI boot question a lot now. You guys are going to have to find a UEFI usb conversion program. It's not super difficult. You can do it with diskpart if you first use a tool to create a hidden extra partition.

There's a tool called rmusbpreptool or something like that. I found it searching for ways to make a windows 8 to go usb stick. That tool can prep your drive with the extra hidden partition, and they also have instructions on their site about making uefi partition stuff with diskpart.

It's kind-of a pain in the ass, but until someone makes a dvd-to-usb tool that supports UEFI, you're kind-of stuck using that workaround."
[V],murphy78,2013-03-11T13:10Z,"@humannature, I will try not to make multi-disc AIO versions as long as I possibly can. It's really better to just use a single-install version if you want to save disc space.  I plan on rolling out a new Ultimate version for IE10, USB3, and NET45 in a few days for tommorrow's patch date."
,NaJeEb303,2013-05-02T11:27Z,"PLZZ PLZZ, i need windows 7 ultimate 32 & 64 bit pre-activated , LATEST!!!
Will be greatly appreaciated .. not 32 bit and 64 bit separately, in a single iso file.... pre-activated!!
