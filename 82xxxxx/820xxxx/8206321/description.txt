Versions you can activate with Volume-KMS are:
Windows 7 Pro, Windows 7 Pro N,
Windows 7 Enterprise, Windows 7 Enterprise N

Pro and Pro N are from a retail image, so they will need conversion
if you plan on using an offline KMS activator. KMSpico does this
automatically, but I recommend either using Windows Loader or MTK241.
Windows Loader is permanent activation, and MTK241 is damn near flawless

KMS-Activators.zip contains KMSpico_v4 and MTK241. Use pico if you
need to convert Pro or Pro N to volume versions. MTK241 works perfectly
fine for activating Enterprise and Ent N. You can most likely use
MTK241 after you have converted with KMSpico on Pro and Pro N if you
don't like the little screen blips when you log on.

Note that KMSpico currently does not use a banned KMS Server ePID, but
it would be bad form for me to recommend using KB971033 anyway. I have
included scripts to either disable the validation tasks if you have it
installed, or to uninstall KB971033. KB971033 does a call-back feature
to check your activation and see if it is blacklisted. KB971033 does
not currently detect Windows Loader, but that could potentially change.
If you install on another person's computer I recommend hiding KB971033
from the windows update list so they don't have to deal with it.

Changes from recent Windows 7 x64 and x86 releases:
-Info folder moved to Windows_Setup_Info
-Added IE10 and USB3 drivers to Boot and Install Indexes.
USB Drivers Include:
Asmedia 104x
Entron
Intel
Renesas
If you use some other Chipset for your USB that you think I should
add next month, let me know. Note that most manufacturers use one
of those 4 chipsets, and you should only let me know if it isn't
currently working for you. This was not intended to cover everybody.
Some people with obscure cards or chipsets I'll never cover.

(Thanks to CODYQX4 and heldigard for their KMS Activators,
I didn't ask permission for both our sakes)
