,desuking,2013-03-01T13:46Z,"Hehe, as soon as it became free on iTunes for some days, I was like ""I wonder how long it will take it to be on TPB"".
Less than a day =)
Good job! Decent album"
[V],bubanee,2013-03-01T14:41Z,"thats right, i saw it elsewhere made free as well and checked torrents and couldn't believe one wasn't here.. well that problem is now solved, so itune and torrent peeps that didn't know now have access torrent wise :)"

,Pjenkys,2013-03-06T13:34Z,Don't download. Really bad quality on my Sennheiser HD585. 130MB rips are better.

,desuking,2013-03-07T14:33Z,"@Pjenkys
Do you really feel the need to tell us the brand and model of your headphones? Douche. At least they are not ""beats by dr dre"".
The quality is fine! The album has like 4 good songs though."
[V],bubanee,2013-03-12T08:19Z,lol... 
,netfire_,2013-03-14T06:19Z,"Yea, but he's right. The quality on this is kinda low."
,Pjenkys,2013-03-15T00:43Z,@desuking  Its not about brand of my headphones. If somebody has a little bit better headphones and download this version than will be disappointed of quality. The quality is worse than official Bowie's clips on YouTube. Of course for a lot of people this rip is sufficient.
