,adam6or7,2013-03-01T16:07Z,Hardcore subs are the substitute teachers that wear the low cut tops and bend over for everything.

,transcona,2013-03-05T02:18Z,"""this movie sucked ass, saw it in theaters""

damn straight!  why is it that movie companies bitch about illegal downloads when they make people fork out tons of cash for rotten eggs like this?!  I was one of the unfortunate who spent $50 on a nite out to see this and let me tell ya.... every movie someone downloads for free is a little bit of payback for shit sandwiches like this."
,Kaulitz,2013-03-05T06:24Z,"@ elasher Not when they're hardcoded, dipshit...and these are. Learn what you're talking about before criticising another's comment.

Good seeds. fast dl. Clean. In VLC player, the A/V are 9 each. The audio was synced fine and with the exception of the Chinese across the bottom...it's perfectly watchable. Especially if you've been waiting for a decent pre-DVD copy.

Thanks, HeroMaster"

Anyways, who the hell uses subtitles unless your deaf?

If your country and people don't make movies, then I feel sorry for your POS country. It must suck to go to the movies and READ THE MOVIE!

I just assumed that if I went to china, that there would be locally made movies.. I mean they make everything here in the US, they don't make shit for their own people? That must suck to live in that country, and go watch US movies where the mouths don't match up, and you have to read the subtitles all the way through..

I don't see how they can read those chicken scratches anyways "

,nbmatt,2013-04-06T08:27Z,"The watermark is from the Chinese website it was ripped from, as are the subtitles. Quit bitching. 

@eb121209: 720p includes the size of the letterbox. Almost all movies are like that. "
,h1vem1nd,2013-04-11T05:59Z,"@IncomePitbull:
You're an ignorant bag of dicks.

Of course China has locally-made movies. American movies are different, though, and are popular in a lot of other countries. Foreign-made movies are nothing new; hell, Miyazaki films (made in Japan) are always big sellers in the US. SPanish-language Pan's Labyrinth? HUGE in the US.

As for the ""chickenscratch"" comment: it's their freaking language. It's as easy to read for them as English is for you - wait, no. It's probably easier, considering your obvious lack of education. Your inability to understand something doesn't make it impossible to understand; it just means it takes more effort to learn than you're willing to put forth.

All these spoiled-child types need to grow the fuck up, stop acting like uneducated hillbillies & stop bitching about free stuff. Jesus Christ."

You're wrong... Shitty movie or not, there were people working, giving it's best at the job, many of them don't have the blame that the writer or director did a shitty movie/history.

Nearly every movie i've downloaded i already watched it in the cinema or rented or owned in vhs or something. For me this is not piracy, i just want to remember the movie i've already paid for watching. "
