On the first release by a partially reunited Hazeldine (the group had split in the late '90s after a proposed major-label deal went south, along with singer/guitarist Tonya Lamm and ex-drummer Jeffrey Richards' relationship), the twangy southwestern rock and lo-fi squalls of early singles like "Tarmac" are largely supplanted by a more acoustic-based, country-oriented sound that at times verges on Dixie Chicks slickness. The trio is helped by a squadron of alt-country superstars, including Caitlin Cary on violin and Superchunk drummer Jon Wurster (producer Chris Stamey provides the lion's share of the guitar and keyboard parts as well), but their familiar harmonies, with Lamm and Shawn Barton sharing leads about equally, stay at the forefront. The highlights include "When You Sleep," which recalls the more tender side of Neil Young's '70s work without sounding slavishly inspired, and Lamm's delicate, singer/songwriter-ish "Miss Ordinary."
