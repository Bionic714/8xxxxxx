 : Before Gabrielle Hamilton opened her acclaimed New York restaurant Prune,  :
 : she spent twenty hard-living years trying to find purpose and meaning in   :
 : her life. Blood, Bones & Butter follows an unconventional journey through  :
 : the many kitchens Hamilton has inhabited through the years: the rural      :
 : kitchen of her childhood, where her adored mother stood over the six-burner:
 : with an oily wooden spoon in hand; the kitchens of France, Greece, and     :
 : Turkey, where she was often fed by complete strangers and learned the      :
 : essence of hospitality; Hamilton's own kitchen at Prune, with its many     :
 : unexpected challenges; and the kitchen of her Italian mother-in-law, who   :
 : serves as the link between Hamilton's idyllic past and her own future      :
 : family--the result of a prickly marriage that nonetheless yields lasting   :
 : dividends. By turns epic and intimate, Gabrielle Hamilton's story is told  :
 : with uncommon honesty, grit, humor, and passion.                           :
