The follow-up to 2005ΓÇÖs ΓÇ£Acetylene,ΓÇ¥ ΓÇ£Travels in the DustlandΓÇ¥ is the band┬┤s first new album in six years and the priority release in GlitterhouseΓÇÖs catalogue for the upcoming fall/winter season.In November of 2010 The Walkabouts entered a studio in Seattle to begin work on the album. The final details were wrapped up in June of 2011. The same crew that made Acetylene and most of the other Walkabouts albums, made this one: Carla Torgerson, Terri Moeller, Michael Wells, Glenn Slater and Chris Eckman. Paul Austin formerly of Willard Grant Conspiracy and Transmissionary Six joined us, providing new angles and possibilities. ΓÇ£Travels in the DustlandΓÇ¥ is a collection of interconnected songs. It is a song cycle. The Dustland is a made up place but it looks acts like a real place. Whiledifferent characters come and go throughout the songs, the most important character is the landscape itself: Its vastness, its endless skies, its scarcity,its hidden opportunities and its rugged dead-end roads.
