,philipo,2013-03-08T19:20Z,"I should start putting in a note about the quality. Its not intended for big screen viewing. Then you should go for 720 or 1080. This is 480, in other words great for pc / small tvs. if you want 720p you must double the filesize. This is the smallest bitrate per pixles you can have to not get quality loss from a dvdrip. To make it clear: for tvs < 40 inches: This is DVD quality!"
