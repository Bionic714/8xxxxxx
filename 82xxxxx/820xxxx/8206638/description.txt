Description:
------------
Want to try a program but do not dare in case you damage your operating system? Wish you have another operating system without removing yours? Can you imagine your test Windows Vista from XP?
All this is possible with VirtualBox, a free utility that creates a virtual computer within your presence with your operating system completely independent.
This way, you can create 'virtual machines' with different operating systems and thus have at your disposal a Windows 95, a Vista, a 2000 a XP or even Linux. Everything from your current operating system.
To use it, you first need to get or create your own virtual machine operating system you want, then load the program and ready, start like a new operating system in question. By the way, the program does not take much, but keep in mind that virtual machines usually occupy a lot of space, easily four to six gigabytes.
