,maverickbleh,2013-03-01T17:48Z,Is there hardcoded subs on this one too?
[T],.SceNe.,2013-03-01T19:02Z,yes
,cwebbie,2013-03-02T19:45Z,Great Picture Quality but I can't figure out how to get rid of the Japanese subtitles. Japanese must prefer to read their movies because the characters are large and in the middle of the screen. 
,lrm-blue,2013-05-09T06:17Z,"Shame it has hardcoded subtitles, if you r like me and hate hardcoded subtitles don't bother with it.
Why do people make the subs hard coded anyway?"
,PENGUIN1234,2013-05-12T03:54Z,Hardcoded subtitles are so incredibly stupid. Why cant you just be able to turn them on and off?
