Dark Captain make shimmering experimental folk, and give it the kind of epic scope we last witnessed in the days of post rock. ThatΓÇÖs no bad thing either; with the grandiose wail of Godspeed and the heart and soul of Fairport Convention the band are on to something really special, and coming from the LOAF camp you know youΓÇÖre in for a delicious treat. Somehow thereΓÇÖs a very defiant British streak to ΓÇÿDead Legs & AlibisΓÇÖ, and deep beneath the gorgeous production and noisier elements thereΓÇÖs a record that even my dad could hold near and dear. I canΓÇÖt for the life of me work out why more people arenΓÇÖt listening to Dark Captain instead of plumping for arch-twats Mumford and Sons, but then the world isnΓÇÖt very fair, is it now? Well good.
