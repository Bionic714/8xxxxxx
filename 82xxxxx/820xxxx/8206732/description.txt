If you think you are going to hear an album that will remind you of Dire Straits and Mark Knopfler then think again. This is the sound of Guy Fletcher. His lyrics are good, his voice very soft and melodic, and he and the musicians who play with him on his first solo album are from out of the top drawer. The album scores highly for "feel good" factor. Particular delights for me were Different World - with the legend himself on guitar - and Stone, which is v catchy right from first listening. There are no weak songs on this album and I know it is going to grow on me even more as I play it over again and again.
