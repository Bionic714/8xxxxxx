Happy New Year and welcome to PSYCHEDELIC REVOLUTION, the first of two albums of Julian Cope songs for 2012. Gone temporarily are those massed percussion Black Sheep workouts of recent years, replaced across PSYCHEDELIC REVOLUTIONΓÇÖs two half-hour-long CDs by eleven epic examples of the ArchdrudeΓÇÖs most scrupulously-written balladry. Listen to those fucking lyrics! And as CD1 and CD2 are dedicated to CopeΓÇÖs two most politically intense heroes and heroines ΓÇô Che Guevara and Leila Khaled ΓÇô listeners will be right to expect the always fiery intensity of the ArchdrudeΓÇÖs performance. Expect tales of insurrection, tales of building new cultural traditions and tales of sexism, racism and even species-ism. Yes, both intellectually and sonically, this is a record to engage deeply with the listenerΓÇÖs unconscious. And with its massed banks of Mellotron 400, wah-acoustic guitars, oboe and brass, this new Cope album is one to Send You Under again and again.

PSYCHEDELIC REVOLUTION features chanteuse Lucy Brownhills taking lead vocals on the title track, and arrives with a 16-page booklet chock full of new political art and poems from the Archdrude. Dig PSYCHEDELIC REVOLUTION and look out for its sibling REVOLUTIONARY SUICIDE later this year. ItΓÇÖs 2012,
