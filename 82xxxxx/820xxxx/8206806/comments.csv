,Mothra67,2013-03-03T02:00Z,"STFmaryville, I have a request: I am searching for the obscure 1991-1993 Impact Comics line that DC  did with all those Archie/Red Circle heroes.  all the Torrents I find at other sites are long dead.  any chance you can help?"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-03T02:32Z,"i think i can probably do that, although there were quite a few titles so it could take a few days! by the way, i've STILL got a few more quality scans of golden age comics to d/l and then i'm posting a big torrent of those."
