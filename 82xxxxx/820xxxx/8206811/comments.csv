You need Calibre with the DRM plugin to rectify.
I'm sure a replacement torrent would be appreciated by many."
,badlylgurl121,2013-03-22T18:57Z,I don't have a problem with any of them. I downloaded the torrent and was able to open them in Sony Reader for PC and able to transfer them to devices and open them with no problem.

Thanks for replying.
Could you try a book on a computer or device that isn't registered?
I redownloaded and retested book 1 and I'm still getting the DRM message from Calibre and Sigil -- Adobe Editions is just blank. Opening the PDF sends me to the Adobe Editions web page."
,badlylgurl121,2013-03-23T18:30Z,I'm not registered or signed in with Sony Reader on my PC or tablet and they worked with no problem. Try using reader for PC and see if you get an error?

Thanks again for replying.
Had the problem because I needed to convert to mobi for Kindle but I've got a Sony Reader coming and I'll see how that goes.
Another Hamilton torrent by zombiRG didn't open in my Editions but after opening in Sigil and resaving, then did but the quality was variable.
So it could be something weird on my setup.
Thanks again."

,badlylgurl121,2013-03-31T07:17Z,I'm sorry but I do not have any issue opening any of the books so I'm not sure how to fix them without seeing the issue.
