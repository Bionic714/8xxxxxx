'300 Days At SeaΓÇÖ is how it feels when you are deep in a songwriting session. There is no sense of arriving, just the peace or the storm of being in the moment with the music, but finally both the land and the songs appear and you realize you have arrived somewhere."

The album was recorded in Heather's home on a small rocky island using only solar power. "I wanted to make a big rock record, all about atmosphere and texture, so I went back to both the guitarist, David Ayers, and the producer (and my husband) Felix Tod, from many of the 'OysterΓÇÖ sessions . Geoff Dugmore, who played on ΓÇÿSirenΓÇÖ, played drums. It was pretty intense, but wonderful."

ΓÇÿ300 Days At SeaΓÇÖ is a rush to the head and a roar through the sea. Although she promises to be a soft, warm earth-mother, Nova is still demonstrating the steely siren-qualities of a time-proven rockstar. I, for one, donΓÇÖt believe for one minute that sheΓÇÖd rather be on the ground than ΓÇÿtravelling at the speed of light.ΓÇÖ
