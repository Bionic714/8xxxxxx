The Dr. Garden book series also includes the following books:
1- Organic garden beginners guide
2-How to make your organic garden grow faster

This manual will teach you:

And this is just a small portion of what the book contains. In this manual I gathered tips and techniques from an experience of over 20 years, simple explanations and illustrations.
