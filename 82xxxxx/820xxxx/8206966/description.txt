
This book is not meant to make you a master gardener. Its purpose is to provide you with the essential information to grow a productive garden to put food on the dining table. We will not emphasize the esthetics of a garden but please keep in mind that a vegetable garden can be a beautiful place. Mine are beautiful to me but I know that others think that they are a little ratty. All agree that my gardens produce a lot of food and that is their major purpose. My purpose is to show you how to grow food.
You might like a little background about this author. I grew up in Central Montana in the Snowy Mountain about 16 miles north and east of Judith Gap, Montana. Our family owned and operated a small sawmill in the mountains selling lumber to the local market. The base elevation was about 6500 feet. Our growing season in a good year was June, July and August. I have seen it snow on our garden on the 4th of July. In order to grow a productive garden under these conditions you had to be a good gardener. We grew lots of potatoes, beans, and a mountain of peas, carrots, parsnips turnips, lettuce, radishes, hardy strawberries, rhubarbs and onions by the bushel. Those rugged and cold mountains taught me to garden.

This book was not meant to be the end all of gardening books. It was written for those that want to grow more food. The pictures are rough and not setup to show a beautiful garden. The pictures are real pictures from my garden. That is all except the cover.
My purpose is to help the beginning gardener get started and maybe supply a few new ideas to the seasoned gardener. I could write a summary for each chapter but the table of contents takes care of that task.
My personal plea is for you to grow a garden. Please, help the world food supply. Store some food.
