The idea for this book came when someone asked what they could do with some ground venison they had been given, besides making it into meatloaf. I was shocked. Ground meat is such an incredibly versatile ingredient that it never occurred to me that someone might not know what to do with it besides meatloaf. While there are meatloaf recipes in this ebook, you will see that there are many, many more ways to use ground meat than in a simple meatloaf.
