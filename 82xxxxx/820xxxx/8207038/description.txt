 Secrets of the Summer House 2008 A lifetime Original Movie


A centuries old curse haunts a family summer house. Male heirs seem to be affected by strange symptoms, occasionally leading to tragedy. When a young woman's (Lindsay Price) husband inherits the house, he isn't there more than a few days before a near-fatal accident befalls him. She realizes that both her husband, and now unborn son are at great risk unless she can break the curse. She uncovers the dark family history of slavery that is at the route of the haunting, and manages to put the vengeful spirit to rest.
