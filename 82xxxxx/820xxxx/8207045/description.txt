Like the DC Icons I've updated recently, these are icons I created to use with your electronic files for your Valiant Comics!

These were created for Windows and are up to 256 X 256.  Rumor has it they can be converted for use on Macs.

Icons included in this batch are Archer & Armstrong, Bloodshot, Harbinger, Shadowman (x2), X-O Manowar and a generic Valiant logo.

Like the DC icons, I will update these periodically.

Enjoy!!
