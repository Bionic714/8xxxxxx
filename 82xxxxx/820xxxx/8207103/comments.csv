,gatosardina,2013-03-01T21:03Z,may work on intel hd 4000?
,MacIsaac28,2013-03-02T03:24Z,Funciona? por favor decir
,ryballs,2013-03-02T03:55Z,"Doubt it. This may be the 'Official Native Version' but unfortunately it is far from optimised. When you start up the game or enter a level first you have to wait for the loading stutter to finish. Then with my 256mb GT330 it runs at about 10fps. I'm guessing you will need a 2012/2013 iMac or 17"" MBP to run this game with any amount of smoothness. I may try and port this myself.. Wouldn't be surprised if I achieved better performance then this official one! ;p"
,giraldie,2013-03-03T08:36Z,"This is terrible ""Official Native version"" ever.. Theres a wrapper made by someone better than this ""Official Native version"""
,ryballs,2013-03-03T09:37Z,giraldie: could you link to that wrapper? the only wrapper ive seen is on portingteam and it has no sound. i might try to port myself..
,ryballs,2013-03-03T09:45Z,if anyone gets good fps can you please let me know ur specs via comment so i can let others know thx
,giraldie,2013-03-04T06:29Z,@ryballs I forget where I download. But the file name is Dungeon_Defenders_macosx_cw...
