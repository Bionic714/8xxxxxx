Hugh's Fish Fight: Save Our Seas
Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall embarks on a brand new battle to Save Our Seas. Two thirds of the planet's fish stocks are overfished and a fifth have collapsed altogether. But Hugh has a plan; he wants to persuade governments around the world to set up many more marine protected areas, to redress the balance in our seas, and allow consumers to continue to enjoy the benefits of eating fish. Hugh takes his new campaign to the far corners of the planet, including Antarctica, Thailand and the Philippines, as well as all round the UK. He also sets out to galvanise his massive army of 850,000 fish fighters through the Fish Fight website.




2)  Part 2 
Hugh goes to the southern oceans to witness the high-tech fishing practices targeting the tiny krill. Hugh travels further than he's ever been before, close to Antarctica and one of the last significant patches of sea not already being overrun with fishing boats. But even here, he discovers a high-tech fishery that is targeting krill, the tiny shrimp-like crustacea at the bottom of the food chain that is being fished for feed that helps turn salmon pink, and also as krill oil tablets - part of the increasingly lucrative health food market for omega 3 products. South Georgia, a haven for wildlife, is governed by the British. This means that it is the British Government who decide how much of this sea to protect. But will they listen to Hugh as he pushes them to set up a bigger protected area around this extraordinary patch of sea?
