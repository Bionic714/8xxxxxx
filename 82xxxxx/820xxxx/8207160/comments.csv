,FieroGT,2013-03-02T21:24Z,"for those with a black screen after logo:
i had same problem, heres how to fix...
start game, right when rebellion logo comes up, hit
ALT-ENTER, to make a window, then game will continue to load, once u get to main menu, u can hit alt-enter again to go back to full screen.  
i have to do this just about everytime to get it to come up.... good luck!"

Had to register to advise those with ""crash after logo"" issue to give this a shot.
Go to nvidia control panel and under 'manage 3D settings', add the sniper nazi zombie .exe file to the list and change the settings from 'use global setting' to 'high performance nvidia processor'. Worked for me so good luck!"
