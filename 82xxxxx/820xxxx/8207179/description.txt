Description:
Sniper Elite Nazi Zombie Army - is a spin-off in a series of Sniper Elite, dedicated zombie Nazis.
In the story, at the end of the Second World War, Hitler resorted to a desperate last resort - half-dead legion of soldiers who threaten flood the whole of Europe. Fairbairn agent Carl (Karl Fairburne) with his team-mates will have to meet with enemies, as hordes of zombies, Nazi super-soldiers, commanders of the occult, and other fiends. The game is dedicated to the cooperative (supports up to 4 players), but you can play alone. In addition, the developers promise new weapons for close combat, and the mechanics of sniping Sniper Elite V2 will be saved.
