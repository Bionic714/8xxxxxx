,barton101,2013-04-06T04:28Z,"Next time, please at least include English subtitles for the hearing impaired. They are also good for people who don't have English as their first language. Many people who have trouble understanding English that they hear can understand it when they see it too. Subtitles take up hardly any extra space and they make for more seeders because the torrent is useful to more people."
