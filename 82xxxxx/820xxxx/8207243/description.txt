YouΓÇÖve probably heard about organic gardening before. You may not have only read about it, but might also have heard about it from ads offering so-called ΓÇ£healthyΓÇ¥ produce. This isnΓÇÖt particularly surprising, since organic gardening has always been associated with healthy living. But what is organic gardening?

Organic gardening means more than just making a conscious decision to skip the use of synthetic fertilizers or pesticides on plants. ItΓÇÖs a choice of working WITH nature, rather than against it. When one works with nature, the choices for growing produce and other plants will be all about making use of the existing ecosystem. It means becoming an element that belongs to the entire system, not just a commodity.
