Harald, whose life is over-controlled, has a romantic weekend in Oslo with Vilborg, whose life is out of control. They meet back in Iceland for a holiday that changes both their lives.

The comedy Our Own Oslo is an everyday love story. We follow the strained courtship of the wildly differing Harald, forty year old engineer, and Vilborg, an unemployed single mother. They are both tangled up in their own pasts and their attempts at love end in disaster. The humor in the movie is often black and firmly tied to the commonplace, but the compassion lies with the main characters who are trying their best.

The beautiful Icelandic countryside is the opposite of the common drone of Reykjavík city, the lover’s troubled, awkward courtship is the opposite of the magical world of Oslo, where the two met while traveling, in a sense on leave from their normal lives.

Harald and Vilborg are normal people we all know. They have their strengths and weaknesses. They make some questionable decisions, are often unlucky and clumsy at communication, but like the rest of us they are driven on by the simple quest for a better life, companionship, love and happiness.
