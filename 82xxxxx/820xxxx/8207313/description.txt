This book contains home-made candy recipes which are 100 or more years old, but can still be made today. The recipes date from 1885-1908, and include recipes from the author's great-grandmother in addition to archival recipes from books and newspapers. The author has an MA Degree in History and includes candy history, trivia and cooking tips with regards to candy throughout the book. Unusual recipe details include things like the recommendations of melting grated chocolate for dipping over a teakettle, dipping nuts into chocolate with a thin knitting needle and testing candy on snow. Discussion of the lack of modern refrigeration during this time period is also included. These recipes hark of an older day, but read like a health food cookbook nowadays, due to the lack of artificial ingredients and use of wholesome, pure foods to make old-fashioned candy. ΓÇ£For homemade candies, use pure materials and good fruit. Enough of earths and starch and decayed fruits are bought in the cheap candies of the stores.ΓÇ¥ ΓÇô The HousewifeΓÇÖs Library, 1885
