Hello, I found these update/crack 1.13G  for "JAGGED ALLIANCE BACK IN ACTION" in the net , I have test it
and it's work (I have the Skidrow version).



..... I add in this torrent 2 fix if needed (english text, and Cambria crash) , 1.13g patch should fix 
the Cambria crash tought
  

..... Installation : copy/paste the files in the "jabia 113g update" folder in your game directory, then
copy/paste the files in the "jabia 113g crack" folder in your game directory


.....1 minor bug , if you play the addon new missions, restart the game to start a new campaign to have
every mercenaries and the shop online 
 

..... I had also 2 mods from me (one SF , and one zombie) see raf mod readme.txt


,enjoy Ralfsolo
 

note : this is my first torrent ;)
