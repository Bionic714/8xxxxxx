Can you think of anything nicer than preparing a meal from produce grown in your own garden? Whether you own a window box or a meadow, every outdoor space can yield a fine crop of fruit or vegetables. Plant some delicious cut-and-come again salads in a window box, plan a ΓÇÿsquare footΓÇÖ garden on a four-foot square plot, or use your flowerbed to grow decorative vegetables and flowers together. Growing your own food doesnΓÇÖt have to be time-consuming or expensive. A few packets of seeds and some basic tools ΓÇô a spade, fork, hoe, rake, trowel and watering can ΓÇô will provide you with all you need to fill a plot with vegetables. Whatever you choose to grow youΓÇÖll find nothing beats the satisfaction of serving up a home-cooked, home-grown meal to family or friends. Good luck and happy digging.
