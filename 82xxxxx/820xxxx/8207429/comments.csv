,i.me.myself,2013-03-01T18:38Z,this is not 3d sbs rip :( and too big for a movie of 2 hrs. it will take me 3-4 months to dl this 45gb shit :P anything less man? thanks in advance.
,khalid_hussain,2013-03-01T19:07Z,is there anyway i can play this on my sony 3d bluray player over the network without burning it to bluray disc?
,GMNavDisc2,2013-03-02T06:28Z,Remux please
,PM_ENG,2013-03-03T19:51Z,"any reason this one is so large? will it look better than the 13GB version on my 3D Full HD 1080p Epson projector, if yes, i'm for sure ready to download it."
,Marwan98,2013-03-04T06:01Z,"Of course it ill look better, its the same as you buying the retail Blu-ray, the 15GB version is compressed from this. Here you've got DTS-HD MA 7.1 audio lossless, in the other you've got DTS 5.1. This version exceeds the 15GB version by miles. I normally don't download these versions but I think this movie deserves it because of all the visual effects in it."
,Dmoney604,2013-03-04T08:24Z,"i too have an epson, and the difference is definitely noticeable...its worth the wait !

cant wait for the hobbit 3d full bluray

bozx u da man.. "
,rattata12,2013-03-04T08:29Z,"If u see the videostreams, the 3D version is aprox. 9000kbps, and in a MVC container, few programs if some doesn't play this type. 

What MVC is, is that it checks if it's a 3D capable device, and switches between 2D and 3D. So everyone that does not burn the BR will probably experience a 2D version.

Stay with the SBS version."
,GMNavDisc2,2013-03-09T10:37Z,"I'm sorry rattata12 but you are wrong.  I downloaded the whole thing and got it working.  

Steps to play this:
1.  Get a PS3
2.  Take the largest file of the .iso out of the image and copy it onto your computer
3.  Use PS3 Media Server (Free) to stream to your PS3
4.  It will start it 2D mode.  Hit the 3D button on your TV Remote

Enjoy"

,thebigboom,2013-03-17T19:45Z,im guessing its this big because it has multiple audio dts and dd 5.1 streams in different languages. and two video streams. picture quality and sound quality should be identical to your 14 gig rips.
,waterbong,2013-03-18T04:16Z,You people complaining about the size go back to your crappy rips.  This is a full disc copy.
,akash2008,2013-06-06T22:09Z,"Thank you BOZX! Downloaded, burned to 50gb blur-ray. Full 3d bluray for $1.50..
