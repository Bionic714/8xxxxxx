I never had to use any crack for it.As far as I know there are two verions(the cd version and the gog version) for the cd version you just install the game. it doesn't even ask for serial key!! same is for gog version that u can find here http://www.gog.com/gamecard/praetorians and is also updated to 1.04 patch"
