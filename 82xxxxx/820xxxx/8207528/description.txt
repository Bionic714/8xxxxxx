    Special note:
    Deviance didn't not fully crack the this game.  By using their copy, you 
    will have the game quitting in several places, disappearing scouts,
    and other problems through out the game.  This is a special feature in this 
    securom and has appeared in a previous title by Eidos, ie, Hitman2.  Here we 
    present you with a copy that works 100%.  We are releasing this 
    release in full because we think that the group that does the proper crack 
    should get the credit.  Otherwise, any group can rush out a release and 
    wait for someone to provide a working crack. That said, we include a crackfix
    zip for those who have already downloaded Deviance's release.
    
    Further note: This release is 100% our own, in case any speculation arises.
    
    Praetorians is an epic 3D strategy game set at the time of Julius 
    Caesar's campaigns to expand the frontier's of the Roman Empire. Taking 
    on the role of a Roman General you are transported back to the deserts of
    Egypt, the frozen lands of the Gauls and to the heart of the Empire itself, 
    Italy. 

    The lands you seek to conquer will be heavily defended by thousands of 
    troops, all with special skills and individual strengths. Fortresses and 
    war machines will stand in your path as you lead your army in a quest for 
    the glory of Rome. You will command the forces not only of Rome, but also 
    of the ferocious Gaulish tribes and the religiously fanatical Egyptians. 
    The path to victory depends on the strategies you choose, the tactics and 
    troop formations you decide upon, and whether you learn to combine your 
    forces and exploit your enemy's weaknesses. 

    Played out in jaw dropping 3D visuals, from the immense scale of the 
    Pyramids right down to the individual centurion, Praetorians is stunning 
    in its detail, scale and beauty. The game is also incredibly intuitive 
    allowing skilled strategy gamers and beginners alike to fully immerse 
    themselves in the game with absolute ease. 

    Features: 

    - Control three different civilisations each featuring a unique set of troops 
    and tactics. 
    
    - The disciplined Romans will utilise organisation and flexible formations 
    as a means of overthrowing the enemy. 
     
    - Gauls have the power of raw strength and greater flexibility of movement 
    on different terrains as they employ guerrilla warfare tactics. 
    
    - The Egyptian priests use a combination of religious fanaticism and 
    advanced science to complement their range of military units. 
    
    - Over 20 varied campaign missions. 
    
    - Employ the powerful war machines of the Roman army and make the best use of 
    them to protect possessions or to destroy enemy defences and lay siege to 
    their fortresses. 
    
    - Different terrain and landscapes play a major part in battle. The AI will 
    understand terrain and its defensive and offensive possibilities and it will 
    also affect unit visibility. 
    
    - Up to 8 players can do battle over LAN or Internet.
