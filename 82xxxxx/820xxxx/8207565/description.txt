Notes: (READNFO) Video has two lines of hardcoded subtitles. They take up too much
video to remove, anybody that wants to can of course do that, but it'd be stupid if
you ask us. Video is a little jittery, nothing major at all. This is also fully in
sync.

Did the usual work here, same as what we do on nearly all of our HDRips. We also
used our nice sweet blur filter up the top right on that watermark which takes
hours to encode. Big thanks to SmY again. Enjoy!

P.S - Sorry for some of the mistakes on the Movie 43 NFO, we were drunk.
