any Ideas what I' doing wrong?"
[T],Totenkruez,2013-03-02T07:24Z,"@kevmeister2009
From the very little information you gave me...

01. ""Dplay.DLL"" refers to DirectPlay, which has been deprecated and was last featured in DirectX 9.

02. DirectX 10 was a fresh start and built from the ground-up, unlike previous versions which were built from older versions. Simply having DirectX 10 or later will not cover anything needing DirectX 9 or earlier. So it is possible to have one, but not the other. You can download the DirectX 9 redistributable from Microsoft's website. It will co-exist with whatever later version of DirectX you might have installed.

03. You are likely running Windows Vista or later, given that all versions of DirectX after 9 required such. I implore you to please read the ""Uploader's Note"" section in the description of this torrent if you have not yet done so."
