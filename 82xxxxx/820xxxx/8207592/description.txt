UPLOADER'S NOTE:
The game consists of a client program and a server program. The client program will not run on Windows XP, even when using compatibility mode. You will need to run the client on Windows 9x either on a physical computer or on a virtual machine.

The server program will run on Windows XP. You can lower the process priority if the program is using too many CPU cycles.

You can rename or delete the intro.avi file to skip it whenever the client program starts.

And lastly, this is one of those scene releases that are double packed. Each ZIP file contains a RAR archive. The RAR archives together contain the game. No installation is needed despite what is stated in the NFO file.
