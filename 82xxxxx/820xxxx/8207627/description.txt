Wiki says:

Void Indigo was a short-lived and controversial comic book series written by Steve Gerber and drawn by Val Mayerik. It was published by Epic Comics from 1983 to 1984. Originally a pitch for revamping DC Comics' Hawkman, Gerber reworked the story into one of the first graphic novels (Marvel Graphic Novel #11) published by Epic Comics in 1983. It was then meant to spin out into a six-issue limited series by Epic. There were minor references implying that the story was set in the Marvel Universe in spite of it being a creator-owned title.

Due to the comic's extreme (for its time) portrayal of violence, however, distributor reaction to the first issue of the limited series was negative. Critical reaction (to the violence) was also harsh: in his Comics Buyer's Guide column, "The Law is a Ass," Bob Ingersoll cited the book as being a "crime against humanity."

Orders for the second issue dropped due to negative reviews, and Epic's editor-in-chief Archie Goodwin considered it not worth publishing the rest of the series due to the pressures he and the company were under.Issues 3-6 were never completed, although the synopsis was later leaked onto the Internet, providing an idea as to how the series would have finished.

Props to the creative team and scanners. Get it, seed it.
