Wiki, him say:

The One was a six-issue comic book limited series distributed by Epic Comics in 1985ΓÇô1986. It was written and drawn by Rick Veitch.

It is an ambitious and bizarre fantasy-adventure involving monstrous superheroes, the Cold War, and spiritual evolution.

I say:

Rick Veitch = Criminally under-appreciated.

Props to Mr. Veitch and the scanners.
