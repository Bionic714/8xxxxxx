1992 Abnett/Lanning pairing for epic Comics. The mutant virus Mutatis is loose in the near future, and it's turning people into monstrous creatures. One infected man is offered an antidote, but the price is he must find other infected people and kill them. Written by Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning. Art by John Higgins and Andy Lanning.
