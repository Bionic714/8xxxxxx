back cover:

Welcome to Tom Reamy's world. You might hear a middle-aged spinster scream as she faces a sixteen-foot monster with only one thing on his mind. You might see a teacher cowering behind her desk as the children she taught all year advance on her with bloodlust in their eyes. You might witness the ritual trek of the nuclear holocaust survivors, avoiding the subsurface creatures that feed on them. One thing is for sure: you won't return unchanged!
