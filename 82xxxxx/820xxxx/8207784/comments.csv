how can we believe you, you're comment spammer piece of shit damn shame"
,HoUsEQuAkE,2013-03-02T13:20Z,For what it is and since the movie is number 1 at the box office right now I give this V7 A8. You have to take into consideration what you are getting. Yes the chinese subtitles are annoying but you can still see the movie just fine. Very watchable for a movie thats only been in theaters for 3 weeks. 
,pumpkin33,2013-03-08T02:56Z,anyone know if this has those foreign supbtitles on it or is it without. Is there a copy out there that doesnt have it
,Ratxhet,2013-04-08T21:06Z,"before you leave bad comments dl the sample
thanks"
,lrm-blue,2013-05-09T06:24Z,"To ratxhet: why would you download the sample when it says the Chinese subtitles are there. The quality of the movie may be good but if you don't like hard coded subs viewing the sample is not going to change anything.
It would be nice if the people who upload movies with hard subs include that fact in the beginning. the same goes for Cams, include details in beginning please it would be much appreciated."

if you take a look at the screen shots, the subtitles are obviously there. 
So what is the problem? O.o..."
