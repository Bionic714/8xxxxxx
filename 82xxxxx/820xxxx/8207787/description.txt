"About the EP:
I started work on this EP in late september 2012. 4 months and about 400 hours of work later I present you 4 tracks that couldn't be more different from each other.
Ranging from hardstyle to liquid dubstep I want to take you on a journey to show my very own imagination of what electronic music can be. Melancholic, uplifting, energetic, calm... It's all there! 

Special thanks to RI for doing the amazing Coverart, to General Mumble for doing the typography and to Lavender Harmony for doing the video editing. I'd also like to thank Icky, Artattack, Whitetail, Michael A, Jamison, Dashi, Lavender Harmony (again) and Command Spry for giving lots of feedback and for putting up with my constant spamming of WIPs." ~Addictia
