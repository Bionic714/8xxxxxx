also, apparently ""subbed"" in the main title doesn't mean "" this comes with subtitles"", but ACTUALLY means "" hard-coded Chinese or Korean subtitles that are pretty high up the screen""

It's not too damn difficult, surely, to write HARD-CODED subtitles???? 

Surely, TvTeam if you give the downloader as much info as possible about these torrents, then it will make for a happier internet!!!"
