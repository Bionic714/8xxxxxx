The 'City of Truro' locomotive would become famous on May 9, 1904 when it was timed at 102.3 MPH while descending the 1-in-86 Whiteball bank with the ΓÇÿOcean MailsΓÇÖ parcel service. The accuracy of this speed has been questioned and investigated a number of times, but the loco was certainly travelling in excess of 98 MPH when it passed Milepost 171 near Wellington in Somerset! If we believe the recording of Charles Rous-Marten it is certain that 3440 ΓÇÿCity of TruroΓÇÖ was the first steam locomotive to reach 100 MPH anywhere in the world. We have included a scenario to see if you can also get to this magic number!
