,joppshr,2013-03-02T00:23Z,"Guys, comment is it working or not?

@The_Duck1, why are you playing like the clay pigeon, writte down is this working or not, because the community is waiting for working copy for months now and nobody provided it.

So, is it working or you are colecting cliks?"
[T],The_Duck1,2013-03-02T07:18Z,"All i can say about er if it's working or not, when other torrents from me are working good for you this one will also work perfectly for you.
On my system it works great."
[T],The_Duck1,2013-03-02T07:19Z,Question: Why would i upload a torrent that is not working?
,mhmm141,2013-03-02T08:51Z,"This crashes, like all the other FM2013 torrents.  Don't bother."
,mhmm141,2013-03-02T08:58Z,"Oh and to that question, The_Duck1: you might not know it, but a working crack for this game doesn't exist.  "

,WizzardofOz,2013-03-02T18:18Z,Koliko moze maksimalno liga da se ukljuce da se igra a da ne izbacuje iz igrice?
,afterbloo,2013-03-02T18:46Z,"Confirmed working, win7 ultimate sp1 64bit. 

That beeing said, by no means I want to sound ungreatful, but a newer version 13.2 and above wouldn't hurt, because this 13.1 is not compatible with Genie Scout. Notheless, great job, much appreciated."
,helicon84,2013-03-02T19:12Z,"Unfortunately, The_Duck1, the game still crashes on the Backroom Advice screen. It's easy to install and a relatively small torrent to download but it still doesn't work properly without a new crackfix. That, the way it's looking right now, is not happening."
,joppshr,2013-03-02T19:46Z,"DOES NOT WORK! THE SAME CRAP AS BEFORE. 

THE DUCK THANKS FOR NOTHING, AND YOUR VERY POOR KNOWELADGE OF GAMES YOU ARE UPLOADING.

WHEN YOU CLICK ON MEET YOUR STAFF THE GAME CHRASHES TO DESKTOP. 

TRIED WITH MEDIUM DATABASE AND SMALL DATABASE THE SAME SHIT.

EVERYONE WHO IS SAYING IT IS WORKING IS LAYING.

MAYBE IT WILL WORK FOR SOME TIME, AND THEN IT WILL CHRASH WHEN YOU CHOOSE SOMETHING THAT USUALLY CHRASHAS THE GAME."
,koomank,2013-03-02T20:35Z,"Firstly, The_Duck1 thank you for efforts. The simple installation is appreciated.

The bugs that are common for most of us have been patched with repeated updates through steam. Without those patches the game is unplayable.

I have both the steam demo(with update patches) and this Duck version installed.

Does anyone know if its possible to copy+paste the certain files(dont know which ones)from the steam folders and transfer them to the Portable directory and essentially patch it that way? Ive tried and keep getting an appcrash. 

THe_duck hope you keep trying with a patch to help all of freeloaders out. Thanks"
,pfloyd51,2013-03-03T01:13Z,"Hi guys, any idea how to uninstall the damned useless thing? What an idiot I've been to install it in the first place."
,WizzardofOz,2013-03-03T02:32Z,I tried this shit it works only when you turn 2 or 3 league if you turn more league it crashes in the loading screen!How long we will wait for a fucking game who works?Ohhhhhh Godddddddd!!!
,joppshr,2013-03-03T02:40Z,Just delete folder from program files... Also folder in app data/roaming/sports interactive and users/yourname/documensts/sports interactive
,john575,2013-03-03T14:29Z,"how do you install this? i downloaded the torrent, clicked on the Football Manager 2013 (1-click run) file and after initiating the install screen it sends me to the site : http://www.friendsinwar.com/thank_you_use_prog.php"
,john575,2013-03-03T14:45Z,can someone please explain how to install this?
,Rapheal91,2013-03-03T15:15Z,Game still crashes after two weeks game time. Any fixes?
,koomank,2013-03-03T21:49Z,John you have to check your program files or start menu program. Theres a folder named Portable and the installation files and fm.exe are there.
,WizzardofOz,2013-03-03T22:12Z,This manager is awesome too pity that we will not able to play him for a long long time!

,Marin87,2013-03-09T12:55Z,"This is first version that works,but you can't update it so its basicly useless cause you cant use geniue scout."
,bola4323,2013-03-09T19:03Z,How do i install this? If someone can please explain in few steps. Thank you!
,professoras,2013-03-10T15:48Z,"So Marin87, it does not work for you who use Genie Scout etc.

For the ones that they prefer to play as real it could be, the game maybe ok"
,dafm,2013-03-11T16:10Z,"Damn it, it's not ok, it doesn't work, stop trying to fool people..."
,delirium_rm,2013-03-11T17:40Z,"it's a fake, it crashes when you access backroom advice, not worth downloading"
,snupix,2013-03-13T01:11Z,If you want working crack send email on markwatt1988@gmail.com
,dafm,2013-03-13T16:03Z,"@snupix  go fuck yourself, douchebag"
,rararine,2013-03-15T15:54Z,"it works, but how to uninstall?"
,batsulis,2013-03-15T19:06Z,the game seems as it works at the beginning but crashes all the time. funny thing is i did 50% of the summers preparation before i discover it crashes. 
,joppshr,2013-03-17T18:43Z,"@batsulis

Well done!

The game crashes from November 2012, and this is still the same release.

Plus if you read first or last comments you would see that it is not working.

So, you are telling us that you are basically living under the rock, and second thing is that you CAN'T read.

Can't believe how much retarded people exist on this planet."
,CKunda1,2013-03-26T21:28Z,its a useless crap...!
,jstew80,2013-03-29T18:22Z,"Game crashes every time I load Romania, this happened since forever in these bugged versions, fu for wasting my time, also this piece of shit doesn't say how to uninstall. "

,Petuniest,2013-05-12T14:04Z,"I always giggle a bit when I see people writing ""FU FOR WASTING MY TIME!""

Do you guys realize you're angry that other people wasted your time that you were going to use for playing a video game? Hilarious..."
