"Unto This Last" had a very important impact on Gandhi's philosophy.[3]  He discovered the book in March 1904 through Henry Polak, whom he had met in a vegetarian restaurant in South Africa. Polak was chief editor of the Johannesburg paper The Critic.  Gandhi decided immediately not only to change his own life according to Ruskin's teaching, but also to publish his own newspaper, Indian Opinion, from a farm where everybody would get the same salary, without distinction of function, 
race or nationality, which for that time, was quite revolutionary. Thus Gandhi created Phoenix Settlement.  Gandhi translated "Unto This Last" into Gujarati in 1908 under the title of "Sarvodaya" ("well being of all"). Valii Govindji Desai translated it back to English in 1951 under the title of "Unto This 
Last: A Paraphrase".[4] This last essay can be considered his program on economics, as in "Unto This Last", Gandhi found an important part of his social and economic ideas.

Tolstoy's book 'The Kingdom of God is within you' overwhelmed Gandhi. Ruskin's book 'Unto this Last' had cast a magic spell on Gandhi so much so that he paraphrased the book as Sarvodaya' and decided to teach from it.
