I prefer this to the so-called "Director's Cut" -- the actors were speaking English and the English language audio is appropriate.  (Slaves in the Deep South didn't speak Italian, neither did their masters.)

This is the true version of Goodbye Uncle Tom, the one that disgusted the film critic Pauline Kael.  So you know it's worthwhile and good.  Enjoy.
