I downloaded this because of some papers, but frankly, what a degenerate world we live in. Before queers of all varieties were persecuted, that was wrong, they should be pitied and allowed to live their lives as happily as they can, BUT today with queers pushing their abnormality as if it were some sort of 'normal' will only encourage more sexual experimentation in that direction and we'll end up with more queers, I long for the day when they go back to being DISCREET and stop those ridiculous and absurd gay pride (?!) parades before the inevitable reaction from disgusted normal people push them back into closets.

You need these papers more than anybody else."
,senseinai,2013-03-02T00:08Z,I think with that level of ignorance he'll need more than these papers.

What you queers fail to understand or perceive is the intense disgust any same-sex affection display provokes in, normal, heterosexual people.

Deceived by considering such displays OK and by the way heteros react to same-sex affection IN THE OPPOSITE SEX (most normal women don't mind gay people kissing but are revolted by lesbian intimacy, and most normal men get turned on by lezzies but hate to see men kissing each other), you don't realize how dangerous to you all is such provocation that with uneducated heteros results in violence.

It would be very sad if because of pushing too hard for excessive demands (adoption, same-sex 'marriage', tolerance of public homosexual display, etc.) you bring about a negative reaction that cancels all you've won so far.

That's a very definite possibility bearing in mind how there have been such mood swings in history (sexually more liberal XVIII century, repressive XIX, etc.).

All you are doing is proclaiming your self-loathing closet case homosexuality to the world, and  with mouth breathers such as yourself, you are the LAST thing good decent gay people need in their lives...So crawl back under your rock and stay there until you dissolve back into the slime that you are."

You're definitely deranged. I doubt any homosexual, repressed or not, would say what I'm saying. But you can deny what I warn you all about to your own peril. Then don't say nobody told you.

You REALLY are a pathetic loser...seek help.  You're going to be unloved and alone with the cancer of hatred eating you up.  You are a sad and very sick individual.

Yet you still download this file...I guess you needed more masturbatory material in your mother's basement.

You pathetic loser."

Precisely, the deranged queer above only knows about insulting those who want to save the queers 
asses so a return to former persecutions doesn't come about.

I downloaded and deleted all the shitty articles on unimportant items, I only kept the ones about queers in the Third Reich and how evil that regime was. That makes it worthwhile. Thanks.

... and one more thing, like Colombo used to say, some day you'll realize that people like me were more deserving of careful attention so you can lawfully continue to do one another in the privacy of your dwellings and live to a ripe old age wearing those convenient diapers to stop what oozes from leaky bottoms whose sphincters have been used in reverse from the normal purpose.   :-)

Go back to swallowing the excrement you spew.  What a sad pathetic loser you are.  Just sick and sad."

Your repeat yourself endlessly in your insults. Can you be a little bit more creative? I know that even among queers there are retards, but your messages give queers a worse name than they already have among the normal populus...
