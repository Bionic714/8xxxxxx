,kolagen,2013-03-02T07:53Z,Thank You Mr.JUNLAJUBALAN!
,isotope,2013-03-03T01:14Z,Considering how close that meteorite passed next to Earth on the Dec 21th I would say they had the money on the spot.
,Joakim_A,2013-03-23T04:41Z,Worked like a treat on the latest Google Earth free. It converted mine to Pro. No virus or Trojans in this one (scanned it with with Malware Bytes Antimalware and Security Essentials). No threats found. Was unable to make it work when running it from a different partion tough. I had to move it to my C drive to make it work. The main reason I wanted to upgrade (but not have to pay for it lol) was to get that wonderful polygon tool that calculates square surfaces of buildings or other areas. I love it!
