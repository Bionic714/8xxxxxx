This six-issue series is a tale of near-future Sci-fi interweaving elements of Mecha,
cyberpunk, and gritty detective fiction. The original comic mini was by co-creators Roy Richardson (Flash, Star Wars) and Rod Whigham (Punisher, GI Joe), and was produced by Marvel under the epic imprint in 1990-91. Was later used as the basis for an RPG game.
