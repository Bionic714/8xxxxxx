,SwimclubOphelia,2013-03-02T12:25Z,"Well, I'm not trusting MeMar, but where is this done.exe you speak of?

I see 6 files, the one you mentioned is not among them."
,G-4-Free,2013-03-02T13:38Z,"SwimclubOphelia
Crysis3.exe is a selfextracting cab archive, inside it is Real Crysis3.exe and done.exe."
,SwimclubOphelia,2013-03-02T16:33Z,"Oh, now I see it.
The Crysis3.exe in this torrent also has a different size (29.85MiB) vs. the legit torrents (31.6MiB).

I say: Let MeMar walk the plank!
Could you report him in the forums?"
,Towersnacks,2013-03-03T04:44Z,Infected. Tried to run from temp folder & contact some hack site.
[V],MeMar,2013-03-04T10:50Z,"LIEVE MENSEN,
DIT IS GEEN TORRENT VAN MIJ!!!!!"
,SwimclubOphelia,2013-03-05T08:54Z,"So this is not your torrent and it magically infected and uploaded itself, right?
And after noticing you still don't have the decency to delete them?

In my opinion that's twice the reason to remove the skull and ban the account."
