ISBN: 9780399161643 | 288 pages | Mobi / ePub

Zen master Bernie Glassman compares Jeff BridgesΓÇÖs iconic role in The Big Lebowski to a Lamed-Vavnik: one of the men in Jewish mysticism who ΓÇ£are simple and unassuming, and so good that, on account of them, God lets the world go on.ΓÇ¥ His buddy Jeff puts it another way. The wonderful thing about the Dude, he says, is that heΓÇÖd always rather hug it out than slug it out.

For more than a decade, Academy AwardΓÇôwinning actor Jeff Bridges and his buddhist teacher, renowned Roshi Bernie Glassman, have been close friends. Inspiring and often hilarious, The Dude and the Zen Master captures their freewheeling dialogue about life, laughter, and the movies with a charm and bonhomie that never fail to enlighten and entertain. Throughout, their remarkable humanism reminds us of the importance of doing good in a difficult world.
