,BoneMonkey,2013-03-01T21:26Z,Thank you soo much been waiting days for this one 
,unholychild,2013-03-02T05:41Z,Your welcome
,shortybobert,2013-03-03T03:00Z,"So ABGX is s**tting itself when I run this through... Is this okay anyways? PFI doesn't match, Video partition does not match, Stealth uncertain, Verification failed. But it's just an addon pack, so I'm assuming it's safe?"
,unholychild,2013-03-03T05:44Z,"Correct, just an add-on pack. Also, I've heard people were having problems with some of the content not showing up in game. So don't get mad at me if there's something wrong with your dlc after installation, it's happening to retails copies as well and gearbox is gonna fix the problem. Everything on my end is good so far."
,LGDPR,2013-03-05T14:24Z,"Didn't work for me....
Torgue's just a 1.5GB dummy file....."
,unholychild,2013-03-05T21:52Z,"@LGDPR
just wait till gearbox releases an update. That seems to be the content that everyones having problems with."
,LGDPR,2013-03-06T01:22Z,"I hope that just an update solves the problem....
But I doubt..."
,BoneMonkey,2013-03-06T22:13Z,"Works great some ppl are having trouble with the game but its not the disc its the game itself

I can confirm this works 100 percent 

Gearbox should be coming out with a patch soon hopefully "
,LGDPR,2013-03-07T15:18Z,"@BoneMonkey

Are you connected to Live?"
,BoneMonkey,2013-03-08T16:07Z,yes im connected to live
,LGDPR,2013-03-09T04:45Z,Did it download something when you installed the DLC's?
,r0dbust,2013-03-12T10:16Z,"So, is this working?"
,ElanBard,2013-04-16T00:47Z,How is this supposed to actually install
,unholychild,2013-04-16T17:16Z,@ElanBard burn to disc or use xkey and install.
,dn559,2013-05-15T00:11Z,"unholychild,
Is there a new ""Borderlands 2 Add-On Pack Version 2.0""?"
,MrMonday1,2013-05-25T05:48Z,"When I put the disc in nothing happened, no files were recognized. Should something pop up, or do I need to find the files on the disc and transfer them to the Xbox?"
