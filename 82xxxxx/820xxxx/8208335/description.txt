Love Borderlands 2, but hate buying things digitally? Gearbox has bundled DLC into a physical "Add-On Content Pack," containing the Captain Scarlett and Mr. Torgue campaigns, the Mechromancer character, a Golden Key, and other DLC for $29.99. The DLC comes to $40 when all bought individually.


Just burn to disc and install on xbox. It's XGD2, so no need to truncate.
Enjoy.
