,Trevor1978,2013-03-07T03:00Z,Hi OnlyByTheRain I installed this on my computer and the Windows Experience Index is not working. I can't rate my computer. Any ideas on how I might be able to fix this?
,DekaSwap,2013-04-14T19:05Z,Is this update-able?
,DekaSwap,2013-04-18T01:18Z,"Okay, I'm here to say that I did in fact install it regardless of it being updateable or not(I don't know, I never got that far), but it's honestly more of a single track than an OS.
You cannot change the theme, doing so makes it impossible to open new windows in explorer. So that jacked up.
Next is the theme itself, which is BEAUTIFUL, but hardly usable with the window thing.
It's not really good on that new start up screen, which I personally hate because of the terrible colors. The logo is okay, but pixelated. 
All in all, it's nice to show your friends, but installing a vanilla Win7 iso from MS's site would probably be the best way to go. 
Also, I'd like to mention this to Rain, there is a way to insert this type of modding via theme pack, and enter the registry keys via REG file to get those extra commands."
