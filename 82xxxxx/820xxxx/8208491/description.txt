MLB 13 The Show allows you to experience the MLB like never before.
Its jaw-dropping realism doesn't just capture every detail and mechanic
of the sport; it captures the raw emotion of Major League Baseball.
Improvements to Diamond Dynasty, Franchise and Road To The Show modes make
MLB 13 The Show the most realistic baseball game ever, while the addition
of all-new game modes expand gameplay options even further. If it can
happen in baseball, you can experience it in The Show. Whether it's the
moment you're called up to the majors, a sacrifice fly to left field,
or crushing a walk-off homer to win it all, every big, emotional moment
in baseball can be yours. And The Show delivers it with such realism,
it's like it really happened.
