,beaujoulais,2013-03-02T16:38Z,"Hi Zlatko, grandiose version of 'Led Zeppelin - Dazed and Confused'. It's totally different to the version from 'Led Zeppelin - Tous En Scene - Live @ Paris (1969)' I once posted. Are there other songs available from the concert or was it a single gig? Thanks & cu, Tom B.
@All: search for video ''Led Zeppelin - Tous En Scene' for an alternative version :-)"
