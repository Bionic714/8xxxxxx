Stan Getz (1927-1991) was 25 when he cut these quartet and quintet tracks for Verve.

This CD comprises (2) sessions:


Tracks 1 - 12  Quintet with Jimmy Raney (guitar)


Tracks 13 - 16  Quartet with Jimmy Rowles (piano) and Max Roach (drums)



the album is something of an orphan...being a compilation which was

released in 1988 but doesn't appear as STAN GETZ PLAYS in the Wikipedia

discography.  One of my "PINK ARROW" favorites


tracks #1 , #12 , #15  are particularly good;  fA
