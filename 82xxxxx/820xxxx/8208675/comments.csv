,mrmaxmorglu,2013-03-05T17:31Z,"Sorry about that @is_there_no_one_else.  
I am seeding 24/7, and i have noticed that quite a few people have finished D/Ling but havent bothered seeding. 
hopefully the seeders will go up soon.
If you've finished your D/L please seed!!!"
,reworker123,2013-03-06T15:53Z,Did you stop seeding this?
,mrmaxmorglu,2013-03-07T19:27Z,"Seeded overnight and let everybody finish their download , hence the massive imcrease of seeders from 2 to 51! your download should finish in no time now. 
Please comment if this content is what you are looking for, and just general feedback as this is my first torrent and I would like to learn from any mistakes I have made.
Once again, thanks for seeding guys!"

,krug93,2013-03-19T08:33Z,Thanks for uploading this! Hilarious show. I'll seed for at least a week.
,FlashBastard1964,2013-04-19T02:13Z,This is really cool and I thank you. I believe there are still 13 episodes to go for the entire second season. They should be airing soon. But then again I could be wrong!
,mrmaxmorglu,2013-05-29T15:32Z,"@Flashbastard1964
Thanks for letting me know this!! I have checked it seems their are more episodes in the second series to come in july 2013. After the finale of season 2, I shall reupload this torrent with these new episodes!
Thanks again"
