* Plot :

Emily Taylor's (Rooney Mara) husband Martin (Channing Tatum) is released after serving a 4-year prison sentence for insider trading. Shortly afterward, Emily drives her car into a concrete wall in an apparent suicide attempt. Jonathan Banks (Jude Law), her assigned psychiatrist, fears for her safety, but he agrees to release her from the hospital as long as she frequently attends sessions with him. Emily tries a series of anti-depressant medications, but none of them work. Jonathan contacts Emily's previous psychiatrist Victoria (Catherine Zeta-Jones), who suggests that Jonathan put Emily on the drug Ablixa. Jonathan is reluctant to put Emily on the experimental drug until she attempts suicide a second time by trying to jump onto a subway track. The medication works, enabling Emily to function normally besides occasional sleepwalking episodes, a side effect of the drug. One night, she stabs Martin to death while sleep-walking.

Emily is brought to trial, and Jonathan fights for her acquittal. Jonathan is criticized publicly for fumbling Emily's case, and his colleagues assume he has been negligent due to his heavy work-load. Emily eventually agrees to an insanity plea deal; she is declared not guilty on the condition that she stay in a mental institution until cleared by a psychiatrist.

Due to the case's bad publicity, Jonathan's partners leave him; he is removed from the clinical trials, and the District Attorney will no longer consult with him. He believes he did nothing wrong, so he begins to investigate the case, eventually finding evidence of a conspiracy. For example, Emily had clearly worn her seat belt just before her first suicide attempt; Victoria had been the only psychiatrist who reported the sleep-walking side effects of Ablixa, and the coverage from Emily's murder trial had caused a massive drop in the stock price of Ablixa and a large rise in the stock price of its primary competitor. Jonathan believes that Emily and Victoria have conspired together, and he interviews Emily after administering what he claims is a truth serum. Emily behaves as if she's groggy from the drug, which unbeknownst to her is actually a placebo. This confirms Jonathan's suspicions.
