       In 1930, Howlin' Wolf met Charley Patton, the most popular bluesman in the Delta at the time. Wolf would listen to Patton play nightly from outside of a nearby juke joint. There he remembered Patton playing "Pony Blues," "High Water Everywhere," "A Spoonful Blues," and "Banty Rooster Blues." The two became acquainted and soon Patton was teaching him guitar. "The first piece I ever played in my life was ... a tune about hook up my pony and saddle up my black mare" (Patton's "Pony Blues"). Wolf also learned about showmanship from Patton: "When he played his guitar, he would turn it over backwards and forwards, and throw it around over his shoulders, between his legs, throw it up in the sky." Chester [Wolf] could perform the guitar tricks he learned from Patton for the rest of his life. Chester learned his lessons well and played with Patton often. During the peak of his success, he returned from Chicago to his home town to see his mother  but was driven to tears when she rebuffed him and refused to take any money he offered her, saying it was from his playing the "Devil's music".
