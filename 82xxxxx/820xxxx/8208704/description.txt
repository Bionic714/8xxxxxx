Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site :: On the Friday, March 1 edition of the Alex Jones Show, veteran guest host Mike Adams, "The Health Ranger," fills in for Alex, breaking down Iowa's on-the-verge legalization of raw milk sales from dairy farms and the raid on Missouri's Morningland Dairy raw cheese farm. 

He'll also analyze how a DARPA-funded study successfully "mind melded" two rats what can be seen as a precursor to the creation of DARPAΓÇÖs ultimate goal. 

On today's show, Mike welcomes rapper Ashel "Seasunz" Eldridge to talk about the message behind the music video "Food Fight," a song calling out the processed food plague.

We'll also air Alex's interview with hip hop artist Immortal Technique, which has since gone viral.
