When Gram Parsons coined the term Cosmic American Music to describe what he was cooking up out on the West Coast in the late 1960s, he couldnΓÇÖt have imagined that the phrase might someday better serve a stream of skin-prickling sounds from Texas. Which is not to knock the Flying Burrito Brothers, but merely to suggest that HoustonΓÇÖs Charalambides have discovered a means for tethering the vastness of the cosmos to the dirt of our shores in a manner thatΓÇÖs too boundless to ever fit inside a Nudie Suit.

Since the release of Our Bed is Green in 1992, Tom and Christina Carter ΓÇô joined intermittently, but not here, by pedal steel player Heather Leigh Murray ΓÇô have toyed with the celestial half of the Cosmic American equation. Records like Unknown Spin and Joy Shapes explore notions of space and stasis in eerily evocative ways. Joy Shapes' ΓÇ£Here Not Here,ΓÇ¥ one of the bandΓÇÖs most perplexing and hypnotic expressions, pits quiet ripples of electric guitar against the strumming of distant, discordant strings, while Christina CarterΓÇÖs vocals yearn feverishly over top. Like much of the bandΓÇÖs output, it sounds like something that might have been picked up by one of those enormous satellite dishes that NASA keeps trained on the skies. In fact, the composition barely makes sense as a cooperative human venture; every one of its parts feels so arrestingly strange that by braiding them together the band takes a quantum leap into the void.

Likeness is the duoΓÇÖs eleventh or twelfth ΓÇ£properΓÇ¥ release, though theyΓÇÖve put out at least that many limited edition CD-Rs, making the distinction somewhat murky. Regardless, Likeness represents a continued, perhaps inevitable, step away from the shimmering shapelessness of the aforementioned records towards more song-based structures ΓÇô a redirection that began on last yearΓÇÖs A Vintage Burden.

If previous Charalambides records represented a kind of wondrous groping in the dark, Likeness offers only as much illumination as its title implies. Christina CarterΓÇÖs gossamer voice is double-tracked on one of the recordΓÇÖs most successful moments, the 13-minute ΓÇ£Memory Takes Hold.ΓÇ¥ Her incantation, which assumes a variety of overlapping pitches as if arriving from all angles, is ΓÇ£Darkness, Likeness / Darkness, LikenessΓÇ¥ ΓÇô as stark a polarity as the band is willing to draw. These ΓÇ£songsΓÇ¥ coalesce to the same degree that shapes in a dark and unfamiliar room reveal themselves once your eyes become adjusted to a lack of light. But such shapes can easily mislead ΓÇô concentrating on one of Tom CarterΓÇÖs buried electric guitar squiggles can quickly unravel a central melodic fragment, just as squinting at that round, red shape on the recordΓÇÖs cover can transform it from a turkey vulture to a beating heart.

Nevertheless, there are breathy contours here, which is where the other half of the Cosmic American equation comes into play. Throughout Likeness, Christina Carter borrows riffs from the American Songbag ΓÇô folk fragments as familiar as they are hard to pin down. ΓÇ£Memory Takes HoldΓÇ¥ dissolves into a kind of wearied and bandaged Drum Taps, with Carter singing ΓÇ£The drummers are returning home from the warΓÇ¥ over tendrils of wafting guitar noise. Less successfully, ΓÇ£The Good LifeΓÇ¥ marries a plodding blues riff to a gritty vocal lamentation (ΓÇ£I have been a nice girl, done what was expected / I will be an old one, loved but unrespectedΓÇ¥) without complicating it in any way. Bitterness emerges as a kind of theme by the time Christina goes out looking for ΓÇ£A fair shake / In this world somewhereΓÇ¥ in ΓÇ£Saddle Up The Pony.ΓÇ¥ Yet, itΓÇÖs a less interesting emotional tenor than whatΓÇÖs generated by the throbbing bass and storm cloud of reverberating notes that blanket her voice.

Likeness ultimately straddles its two poles of ΓÇ£Darkness, LikenessΓÇ¥ by refusing to quite commit to either. Too oblique to offer an easy entryway for anyone who's foolishly been put off by records like Joy Shapes, neither does it quite strike the winning balance of A Vintage Burden. Yet, as is always the case with this band, multiple listens will have you grappling about for the forms that are casting these peculiar shadows. The songs that stick in the head ΓÇô ΓÇ£The Good Life,ΓÇ¥ ΓÇ£Saddle Up The PonyΓÇ¥ ΓÇô are in some sense the slightest because theyΓÇÖre fixed, concrete. ItΓÇÖs in the tangled intermingling of drone and chime, guitar and naked voice, where the likenesses become talismanic and strange, impossible to fully decipher.
