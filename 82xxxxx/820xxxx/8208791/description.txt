                Brutal Legend Update 2 (c) Double Fine Prod.

         03/2013 :..... RELEASE.DATE .. PROTECTION .......: Steam
             DOX :.......... DISC(S) .. GAME.TYPE ........: Action


Major Fixes:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Fixes bug where players who started playing single player on or after the
  28th of February would be unable to continue their save. All of the saved
  data should be intact. This bug was that the game was falsely reporting
  that there were no save games and now thats fixed.
- Interpolated re-enabled with improved logic to avoid the post-pause
  stutter and to generally be smoother than before.
-	Alt+Tab works much better in the albumn cover menu. Backgrounds no longer
  go black when alt+tabbing. Some UI textures may still exhibit problems
  elsewhere in the game.
-	Matchmaking will allow a much broader range of players to match with one
  another, fixing some reported problems of players not finding any matches
  or finding the same person over and over again.
-	Steam Cloud support has been added and is working!!!
