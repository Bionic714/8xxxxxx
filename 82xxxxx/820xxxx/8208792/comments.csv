,LittleBoy777,2013-03-04T23:24Z,"Even if ''Red Dawn'' was first released in 1988, the australian author John Marsden had already the idea of his novel in 1983. 10 years after the idea (1993) he finnaly released his book series. The story is not like Red Dawn, since he has some sense of justice and is not egocentric as americans.

Instead of just killing enemies as true warriors, the australian adolescents have human feelings and the story ends being a drama and not an american trash with explosions everywhere.

Read the books if you are interested, or just comment without understanding the story and show how dumb you are."

,Bonesman1990,2013-03-07T10:41Z,"Here's a ""story"" for LittleTwat777:

A disarmed people are slaves. Australians are forbade AKs and other effective weapons of war (proving this half-witted work is pure fiction; tear-jerking Liberal story and all). All their Queen allows them to have are 48"" shotguns and cap & ball pistols. Brits and their dejected criminal trash are bound for extinction.

AUS = my ASS

Americans may like to blow shit up, but the next time some weak-assed Liberal pansy starts whining about our explosions, we are going to send a drone to the house and show them the meaning of ""gratuitous violence"" while we sit in a bunker 10,000 miles away.

Fuck the world!"
