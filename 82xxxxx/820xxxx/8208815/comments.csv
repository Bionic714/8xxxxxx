,topk,2013-03-02T01:17Z,"DVD must die.
I will wait a couple days until Bluray is out."
,erraticchevy,2013-03-02T01:47Z,"@topk i Completely agree Dvds are like vhs used to be and blurays are the new ""DVD""  The only thing a dvd is good for is if you still have a 26"" or smaller SD TV. Which are also becoming obsolete. It wont be to much longer then we will have 4k HD and 8k HD tvs and Video Disks they will replace blurays in a few years. Ya plus this movie is over 2 hours so 1.37gb at 336p, I recomend waiting tomorrow or thhe next day will have a BRrip"

,m__v__h,2013-03-02T10:53Z,Ty! Awesome movie. When will the 1080p version be ul:ed?
,tororosso85,2013-03-02T13:24Z,"DVDs (even DVDrips) are fine for home entertainment . If someone is looking for ""THE BEST QUALITY"" he can go to cinemas (with payment of course)"
,topk,2013-03-02T14:06Z,"@torrosso A cat is fine too.
Go to Youtube and watch a video in 1080p = Bluray
Then watch the same vidoe in 480 or 360p = DVD
Is DVD still fine?"
