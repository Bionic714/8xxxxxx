SYNOPSIS
Russia, present day, summer: Truck driver Georgy picks up his latest load and heads off for the motorway, stopping off first at home, where he avoids contact with his wife. His journey is interrupted by two traffic policemen at a checkpoint; and when he evades their seemingly-unnecessary attentions and returns to his cab, he finds an old man sitting in the front seat. The man asks for a lift, and, in return, tells Georgy the sobering story of his return from the German front in 1946. After the old man disappears, Georgy drives into a traffic jam on the main road. A teenage prostitute appears and offers to show him a short-cut ΓÇô along with her services ΓÇô and they end up at a village market. There, hurt by GeorgyΓÇÖs attempt to show her some kindness, she abandons him. Leaving the market, Georgy continues his journey alone and ends up lost in a field. By now, night has fallen and his truck has broken down. Three tramps appear out of the darkness, planning a robbery. They invite Georgy for a meal by the fire and offer him a drink. Georgy refuses alcohol and asks for directions back to the motorway, but the meal ends violently and abruptlyΓÇª
