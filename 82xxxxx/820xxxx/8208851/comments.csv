,finderrr,2013-03-03T00:00Z,How can I upload one of the maps on my garmin?
,finderrr,2013-03-03T10:07Z,...and how can I load/open the image files into base camp?
,Ipmark,2013-03-03T11:21Z,"1) Copy the gmapsupp.img you prefer in a SD folder called Garmin (SD must be fully formatted FAT or FAT32 filesystem). If you want to copy the new map in the internal GPS memory you must specify the GPS model.

2) Copy the map in a folder called Garmin of a pendrive or SD in a USB memory card adapter and start BaseCamp, wait the map loading (it can take some time) then select the device from the program left panel."

,aaronj69,2013-03-05T17:36Z,"the RAR files part01, part02... are they link as one extracted file, or they are all separated files... they all have same file gmapsupp.img. Please explain. Thanks."
,aaronj69,2013-03-05T17:37Z,"The Unarchiver RAR in Mac, does not recognize as ONE compressed IMG file...?"
,Ipmark,2013-03-05T18:37Z,"For Win users:
Unrar the part #1 ONLY with Winrar, the tool will join togheter all other parts of the package.

For MAC user don't know. Sorry"
,aaronj69,2013-03-05T20:26Z,Fair enough. Thanks.
,finderrr,2013-03-12T21:47Z,"@Ipmark

Thanks for the reply. Loading into base camp has worked just fine. However, my Garmin Dakota 10 has only internal storage and no SD card option. Can I upload several gmapsupp.img files into the internal memory (I would like to use several maps) and do I need to rename them? Thanks a lot! Excellent upload!"
,Malborough,2013-03-12T23:12Z,"I have put 4 maps into my garmin 360, 3 in the internal memory and 1 on the SD card. It recognizes 2 of the intenal maps (gmapprom, gmapprom1) and the SD map (gmapsupp). What do I have to name the 3rd internal map. I've had no luck so far. Thanks for all your help."
,Ipmark,2013-03-13T09:25Z,"@finderrr
Update the Dakota to the latest firmware, then you can use custom filenames map.
Rename maps to Italy.img, SpaPor.img, France.img and so on and copy them to the GPS Garmin folder.

@Malborough
On the internal memory you can use gmapsupp.img and gmapoem.img too."
,DNBC,2013-03-22T13:09Z,"Hi, i downloaded it, and in the SD I put 4 different countries. I named it gmapsupp1, 2, 3..
When I turn on the divice all the maps are from 2010.
What can I do? or What do i do wrong?
tnx"
,DNBC,2013-03-22T13:35Z,"how must I named the gmapsupp in the SD when I need to install several maps? (gmapsupp1, gmapsupp2 gmapsupp3??...
tnx"
,Ipmark,2013-03-23T21:01Z,Old Nuvis support 1 gmapsupp.img map only on the SD but the Nuvi 2xx with 5.10 firmware or higher that support 2 maps on the SD gmapsupp.img and gmapsup1.img (SD Garmin folder).
,AdrianaJ,2013-04-14T17:44Z,"Hi there... Thanx for all you maps... It work flawlessly...

Unfortunately, so far I have only manage to install one map at a time... How can I install all gmapsupp.img into one SD card... For now, I've installed local map in device internal memory & international map in SD card... 

If possible, I would like to install map for a couple of countries at once...

Thank you in advance for your help..."
,AdrianaJ,2013-04-14T17:45Z,"Hi... Sorry for didn't read the previous post first...

Guess my question has been answered by your reply to DNBC..

Cheers..."
,Ipmark,2013-04-14T23:55Z,"You can merge two or more maps that NOT overlap with GmapTool following the tutorial at

ht_tp://w_ww_5.zi_ppysh_are.com/v/437_77548/fi_le.ht_ml
(remove underscores)

At first test the map on the SD and NOT in the internal GPS's memory."
,AdrianaJ,2013-04-16T13:50Z,"Hi... Thanx a million for your reply...

Have yet to do as per your suggestion since I just got my device back from a friend who has just returned from Australia (using your map & it work brilliantly, THANK YOU)...

I noticed that when I tried to install & rename the map to gmapsupp.img (Western Europe) & gmapsupp1.img (Australia/New Zealand), it only detected the Western Europe map, but not the Australia....

FYI, my device is Garmin Nuvi 255W SgMy Version 3.10 & GPS SW Version 3.90b...

I noticed you told DNBC that double map can only be installed at Nuvi 2xx devices with version 5.10...

I tried to update the software at Garmin Singapore but, the site told me I already have the latest software version of Ver 3.10...

Please advise how to get around with this problem or probably I need to do the map combination as advised earlier...

Thank you again for your help and ever working maps...

Take care..."
,Ipmark,2013-04-19T13:49Z,"The double map on the SD was introduced with 5.10 firmware for 2xxs but not for all models.
Note that the correct mapname is gmapsup1.img (1 p only)
If you can't update the firmware you have to merge the maps with gmaptool, the process is quite simple."
,AdrianaJ,2013-04-20T09:44Z,"Thanx Buddy... Manage to combine the map... Indeed it's pretty straight forward stuff...

Cheers & THNAK YOU from me..."

,piedro2,2013-05-17T22:09Z,"The easiest way for me to have several maps is to have several SD cards with one map on each. The cards I am not using in GPS at the moment, I use in my camera and MP3 player."
,torckar,2013-06-06T21:46Z,"Hi Ipmark.  
I love your work ...... Have Garmin made ​​a recent map update for Europe? The latest I have from you is 2013.40. Garmin has just reelesed a new update for Europe, but I do not know what the version is called"
