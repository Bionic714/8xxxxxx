Ponderosa are a new band, but not a band feeling its way to a mature sound and style -- Ponderosa are already fully developed on Moonlight Revival, the groupΓÇÖs debut album on New West Records. Sounding at times like a blend of the Black Crowes, Lynyrd Skynyrd, and Tom Petty, all with just a dash of country tossed in, this Atlanta-based band delivers first-rate songs with verve, joy, energy, and attitude, due in no small part to lead singer Kalen Nash's poised and assured vocals. Everything works here -- the vocals, the guitars, the little piano touches. The opener, ΓÇ£Old Gin Road,ΓÇ¥ could play anywhere on todayΓÇÖs radio dial, from new country stations to alternative rock stations. It features crisp guitars, great hooks, and a solid lead vocal from Nash, and itΓÇÖs no accident that itΓÇÖs the bandΓÇÖs first single. But it might not even be the best song on the album. ΓÇ£I DonΓÇÖt Mind" is just as good, and ΓÇ£Pretty People,ΓÇ¥ driven by a Stones-like guitar riff and British Invasion harmonies, is arguably even better. Oh, and then thereΓÇÖs ΓÇ£Revolution,ΓÇ¥ which sounds like the rocking political song Tom Petty has always wanted to write, and the warm, back-porch folk/bluegrass feel of ΓÇ£Penniless,ΓÇ¥ which shows just how versatile and talented this band is. These guys are the real deal, and theyΓÇÖve arrived fully formed. ItΓÇÖs difficult to imagine a better debut album this year.
