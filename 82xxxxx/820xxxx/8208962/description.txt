The 2nd album from this Seattle band led by former Band of Horses/CarissaΓÇÖs Wierd member Mat Brooke is an often-stunning set of beautifully crafted folk-pop. Co-produced once again by Ben Kersten at Paradise Sound studios in Index, WA (located in the foothills of the Cascades), the album is a little darker and more subdued than their 2008 debut. ItΓÇÖs also drop-dead gorgeous, with airy production highlighting the bandΓÇÖs sublime harmonies
