,gokulnc,2013-04-20T12:06Z,"Error: ""Could not establish a connection to Steam"" in Cooperative Mode:

After installing the Sniper Elite Nazi Zombie Army Game on my PC, I played the game.
The single player mode worked good.
But when I chose the co-operative mode in the Game Menu, the following error occured:
""Could not establish a connection to Steam""
I get this error even after installing Steam software (and logging in).
pls help."
