FLT Release Notes:

If you experience a black screen after the Rebellion logo,
disablesprogram like Afterburner and let the game decide
how to run ( graphic card settings ). Otherwise check Steam
forums for updates on how issues like this can be fixed
or wait for a patch that addresses it


Notes:

We Recommend Installing To A Short Path (Like The Install.exe Default)
As Long Path Names Can Cause Missing Files On Certain
Games During Rebuild.
Unless You Changed It The Default Extraction Folder Install.exe
Creates Is C:/Games/
This Is Were You Can Find The Games exe.
If Install/Rebuild Seems To Freeze Leave It Alone.
Install/Rebuild Is Normally Very Time/Space Consuming.
(So Ensure You Have Pleanty Of Space And Patience)
