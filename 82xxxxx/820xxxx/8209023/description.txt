A man comes home at a time of day heΓÇÖs never been there before. A time when the light hits it differently, when the humming of the fridge is the only audible sound. A man comes home at a time heΓÇÖs never come home before and for a moment it seems to him like he has walked into the house of a stranger, empty and silent at a desolate mid-day hour. 
A man comes home and all of a sudden he can see fabulous and forgotten things. Dust particles swirling around in a white ray of light. An old price tag glued to the underside of the table. 
A man comes home like a tourist and observes anew those things that make up his life. The parking lot, the stairs, the full mailboxes. A man comes home and walks into his life at a time heΓÇÖs never been inside it, observing it with the eyes of the child he once was. And, once again, it is filled with mystery and magical hideouts. The corridors, the passageways, the boiler rooms. 
A man stands by and observes his own life from the outside. But is this life still truly his own?
