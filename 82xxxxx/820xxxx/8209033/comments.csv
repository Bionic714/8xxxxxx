,w0lf1,2013-03-02T06:51Z,"Hmmm yes I suppose I did forget to put that in the title. It really is a shame you can't edit your torrent info after uploading it.

*THIS IS A BETA*

I wouldn't fret over it though, there have been no known issues reported with the last several iterations of the beta and I haven't seen any complaints anywhere on the net about people experiencing problems with 10.8.3 after they fixed a few minor problems. Also 10.8.3 has been in beta since Nov 26 of 2012 so pretty much everything has been ironed out. I'd expect either this or the next build to be the Golden Master."

,bjornagainswede,2013-03-02T18:18Z,"Just an FYI.. I have previously installed betas and among some of the apps it f***ed up are my anti virus software (Avast) and Little Snitch to name just two.. OnyX I think was also affected at one point. I do not install betas now as a result. These apps cannot apply updates as the beta excedes the alpha Os version.. ie they will not update or behave nicely til the official release comes along.. Mac Native apps naturally will behave as they are the ones being updated with each beta release

THIS IS WHY IT IS IMPORTANT TO STATE THAT THE UPLOAD IS A BETA!"
,Cachorro,2013-03-02T23:22Z," agreed 100% with ""Bjornagainswede"" It should be named BETA.
I think that this ""w0lf1"" is an amateur. None to trust with his uploading.  YES, YES, YES !!"
,CapeCodSmith,2013-03-03T23:26Z,w0lf1 may be new to this....but every app i have downloaded from him works just fine....Keep up the great work buddy!!
,CapeCodSmith,2013-03-03T23:28Z,and oh yea.... no need to use the word beta because he put in the update number....12D74....which means that its a beta....no call letters are attached to general releases.

Spoken like a true expert who only thinks about himself... How the hell is someone who bought their first Mac a month ago and has little of no tech savvy going to figure out that it's a Beta with a bunch of numbers and letters there and not the word Beta???? Or a windows convert for that matter... These are things that only Mac useres who have been around the block and back again are savvy to!

I have no problem with the seeder or his torrents... but would thank him to include the word Beta on such torrents in future... and others for that matter knowing they are uploading a Beta!

What's a Gold Master??? Is it a final Alpha pre-release, or is it an unofficial official release?...why the heck have folk in the Mac community always invented these little terms to confuse the hell out of everone for? All I know here is that Golden Masters were always good and didn't screw stuff up... unlike betas"

Yes it's not included in the title, but I can't edit the title or anything else about the torrent once it's been posted.

One thing you should note though, is that it actually does say ""Beta"" and ""Developer"" in the tags as well as mentioning the build # which, when googled, is clearly a beta.

Someone who isn't tech savvy and just got their first mac probably shouldn't be downloading torrents without looking into what the torrent is.

Golden Master is the final build that will be shipped/distributed to customers, it is akin to the term RTM for Windows Operating Systems."
,CapeCodSmith,2013-03-06T14:36Z,"Hay...bjornagainswede....the last thing i think of is myself... I bought my 1st Mac in 1980 so your right about that...But as was already stated....someone who just bought a Mac shouldn't be getting torrents. Sorry if i offended you...but your the one that sounds like the ""expert"""
,CapeCodSmith,2013-03-06T14:38Z,12D76 is out already....I wonder how many updates there gonna make before they move on...10.9 is coming soon...and then X.X!!

""someone who just bought a Mac shouldn't be getting torrents""

- says who???

are seasoned users the only ones with rights to torrents now????  or have you once again not thought it through...?

Friend sends new Mac User a .wmv video or a .rar file ..... or better still a bin/cue audio file... just for starters...

I have been using Intel Mac from day 1... never had any time for the old power machines... too slow... so no... I am not thinking about myself here...."
