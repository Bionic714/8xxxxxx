Dressed in bouffant dreadlocks, Snidely Whiplash mustache, and a bootcase of frilly pirate blouses, London-based indie rocker Charles Costa (aka King Charles) comes off as a kind of latter-day Adam Ant on his 2012 debut, Loveblood. However, where Adam Ant pillaged the punk rock sound of '80s London, King Charles is a frothier regent with an ear for the campy '70s glitter-synth of Sparks combined with the indie Afro-pop meets neo-new wave of Vampire Weekend. Musically, Loveblood is an elaborately produced affair with a generous amount of orchestral sounds, as well as acoustic and percussion instruments dressing up the overall driving electronic and indie folk-rock vibe. And though he clearly aspires to the royal rock heights of Freddie Mercury, King Charles is less Queen and more Mumford & Sons on Loveblood. Songs like the jaunty leadoff title track and the '50s doo wop meets "hooked on the classics"-style disco number "Bam Bam" are exuberantly batty, eminently hummable ditties that showcase King Charles' knack for laconic crooning and bodice-ripping romantic lyrics like "I will build a towering pyre of passion built by my desire." Similarly engaging tracks like the tropical island steel drum fantasy "Lady Percy," in which King Charles coos "Oh, I know Lady Percy will never come to my show/Up in the highlands racing cars, building guns, and breaking hearts," and the anthemic banjo-driven country-rocker "The Brightest Lights" are sparkling, foot-tapping numbers that blithely play up Charles' lordly hedonistic persona. Ultimately, while King Charles' moniker would indicate he's crowned himself Lord of the Pop Manor, in truth, he's seated a bit further down the line from the throne. That turns out to be a good thing for the vocalist, who's clearly cut out for making silly, romantic, and catchy music that's not exactly what you would call "regal."
