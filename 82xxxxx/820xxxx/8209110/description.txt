The best parts of Jill Sobule's self-titled second album capture a goofy cocktail nation groove worthy of Combustible Edison or Love Jones. The singer- songwriter's sparer efforts are less interesting, until you turn to the witty lyric sheet, which chronicles the secret lives of characters like Karen, the uptight boss at the shoe store, and Margaret, the bad girl at St. Mary's Catholic high school
