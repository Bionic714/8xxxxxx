Lisa Germano is the female succubus of music; each syllable that spills from her glorious mouth is laced with a breathy coldness that's also incredibly sexy at the same time. In fact, sort of similar to a female version of Lee Hazlewood (coincidentally, she sings the Lee Hazlewood parts on a cover of "Sand" on here). Applying that voice to a raw, yet rather experimental, Americana sound (with members of Giant Sand comprising the rest of the band), it's like a match made in heaven. If I were a cowboy that wandered too far from home, becoming lost in the wide open West, Slush would be my album of choice to listen to on those cold, lonesome nights.

So aside from all of Lisa's crafty seduction, the writing on here is pretty ace. OP8 are almost a supergroup of sorts, with many of these songs written by different people. I can't get enough of Lisa's composition; "If I Think of Love" being one of the most gorgeous pop songs she's ever crafted, and considerably more boisterous than her usual violin-heavy auditory depression. Then "It's a Rainbow" is also a showstopper. Her songs tend to take a break from the album's usually sparse instrumentation; full on orchestras of Americana goodness are needed to harness her creativity.

The rest of the band's songs aren't really bad by any means, but they don't really match up to what Lisa contributes to Slush. I think they shoot for bits of introspection and reflection, but really, for the most part, songs like "Lost in Space" and "Leather" are just good points to catch a few Z's in between Lisa songs. All in all, a pretty decent album to my judgmental ears.
