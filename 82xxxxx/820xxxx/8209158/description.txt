If Shannon WhitworthΓÇÖs first two albums were cross-country treks, High Tide is a trans-Atlantic voyage. Leaving all preconceptions of the banjo-wielding songstress behind, WhitworthΓÇÖs new adventure steers into waters both familiar and refreshingly new, Gibson SG in hand.

On the heels of a year spent touring with Chris Isaak and the Tedeschi-Trucks Band and recording as the singing voice of Belk department storesΓÇÖ latest campaign, High Tide finds Whitworth collaborating with Bill Reynolds (Band of Horses) and producer Seth Kauffman, while continuing to hit the road with her core quartet.

From the first rolling rhythms, itΓÇÖs evident that this album charts new waters. Just as her music stems from Appalachian roots (sheΓÇÖs a favorite at MerleFest) but sheds its traditional skin at the door, High Tide begins with a journey to the coast that takes rest stops in reverb-drenched jazz and indie rock along the way, setting the mood for a tight but playful expedition. Whether youΓÇÖre holed up in a chilly Appalachian barn or walking the coast on a hot August evening, WhitworthΓÇÖs High Tide holds universal appeal, from the mountains to the sea.
