Do not forget to stop the program in task manager and the service before using the patch."

whenever try to get connected with a PC,
""Commercial Use Suspected""
 warning message appears.

Some one remake the perfect crack, please.

,oquatanginwann,2013-03-10T22:50Z,"Regarding TeamViewer: The TeamViewer servers monitor all the remotes one connects to via the computers Mac address. If one makes what they consider too many connections to too many different computers, the dreaded ""Commercial Use Suspected"" scenario pops up.

So, while your TeamViewer One-Click indeed opens, many people are going to get, or eventually get, the ""Commercial Use Suspected"" situation.

I did indeed using yours.

No one has yet to come up with a way to crack TeamViewer for someone who wants to use it to connect to many different computers. And likely, a crack cannot be made since the connection has to go through TeamViewer's servers.

So folks, if you are just going to connect to a small amount of computers, and only those, using TeamViewer for free will be fine.

But if you want it for access and/or tech support to many different computers, TeamViewer will always eventually catch on and then hit you with ""Commercial Use Suspected."""
