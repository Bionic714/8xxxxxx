Singer/songwriter Emm Gryner is one of the most under appreciated talents on the Canadian music scene. For years she's been making album after album of beautifully crafted songs.

Gryner's signature piano sound is less dominant on Goddess. Filling the void are elegant cello and violin arrangements ("Goddess"). The guitars and drums are also turned up on the album, making songs like "Empty Hole" some of her hardest ever.
