,gza6,2013-03-02T05:20Z,"Appreciate you uploading all of these TV shows EZ, is there an uncensored version of Kitchen Nightmares. The bleeping gets fucking annoying LOL."
,acsmith1972,2013-03-09T08:34Z,Apparently no one wants to upload episode 12.
,jchen9999,2013-03-09T21:59Z,please upload episode 12
,heyyouguys,2013-03-26T22:55Z,"the problem im seeing is the numbering is off on the series as there are only 12 total episodes to the season.  everyone has uploaded 1-11 and 13, the only ep 12 i see is really 11 so cant tell whats missing without downloading them all.  but then again that was the plan after all"
