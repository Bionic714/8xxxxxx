Bondi Vet S05E01 real + E02 (2013)  xvid avi


I did a web stream rip to xvid for the missing episode 1 for the 
new season and gave it a title 

and included a covert of rtas episode 2 (which is also being called
wrongly ep1ep2)

I notice the new season the episodes seem much longer.. werent they
like 22min? now they are 40-44min

in this episodes is a sick Dolphin and ep2 about a Swan


ENJOY and HELP TO SEED!!!!

note these arent HD but other sources 360p mp3 cbr 128 1000BR they
are crisp but watchable on laptop maybe TV too

they have been optimized so sony tv wont give dreaded not supported error
when xvids should be :)
