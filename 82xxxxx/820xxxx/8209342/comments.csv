,piizda,2013-03-05T01:26Z,"As ususal.
Good videa and audio.
Boring movie. A good movie to get to sleep."
,Ayni.,2013-03-05T03:45Z,Thanks BOZX. Great quality as usual.
,joegi50,2013-03-11T08:08Z,"Video: 10. full screen fits nicely with your HDTV, nice video quality.
Audio: 10. You can listen to audio at high and low frequency. English subtitle included.
File Size: 3-7 Gbytes is excellent for great torrent. Small file size is great but you lose all the quality.
You do not want to waste time to torrent and come to frustration...stay with good trusted name like BOZX."
,Tankocity,2013-03-14T05:17Z,"A: 10
V: 10

Except in the last 30 minutes of the film - when it's dark/night.  Then the visual quality drops to around 6/7."
,PTheus,2013-03-17T04:25Z,"English subtitles from the release container. Minor corrections and italics added:

,Sanyi001,2013-04-06T05:31Z,Protected by Cinavia! Unwatchable on PS3!! 
,xanat0s,2013-04-11T01:50Z,"@Sanyi001

If you can't figure out how to bypass Cinavia, then this clearly isn't the scene for you. 

BTW there's this wonderful invention called Google. You should try it some time."
