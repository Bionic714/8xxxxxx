,x.morbid.x,2013-03-02T05:46Z,"Yes, real.  DibyaTPB is trusted, with skull .... and I've DLed and watched.  Thanks Dibya!"
,az25,2013-03-02T06:24Z,No. I was referring to / asking why it is in the name.
,Richaod,2013-03-02T06:57Z,"I assume it's ""real"" because they mislabelled last week's 720p as 3-11 instead of 3-10, as it should've been?"
,00sweeney,2013-03-03T02:19Z,"According to every list I can find, there are only 11 episodes of this season of Portlandia. I understand that this is a trusted uploader, but the fact is that every site including the Portlandia home page lists only 11 episodes. "

episode 3-11 is a two-parter, so either a 40 minute episode 11 or two 20 minutes per episodes 11 and 12."
