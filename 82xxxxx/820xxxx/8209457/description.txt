Storyville: Documentary that goes inside the complex network and history
of Anonymous, the radical online 'hacktivist' collective. Through
interviews with current members - some recently returned from prison
others still awaiting trial - as well as writers, academics and major
players in various 'raids', the film traces the collective's breathtaking
evolution from merry pranksters to a full-blown global movement, one armed
with new weapons of civil disobedience for an online world.

In recent years, Anonymous has been associated with attacks or 'raids'
on hundreds of targets. Angered by issues as diverse as copyright abuse
and police brutality, they have also taken on targets such as the Church
of Scientology.
