New scan. Image pdf with contents in bookmarks, accurate pagination and metadata, etc.

Note: This is a scan of a rather poor paperback edition of The Long Loneliness from the late 60s or early 70s. The scanning result is pretty good, but not great. However it's readable.

About Dorothy Day and this book:

Dorothy Day (November 8, 1897 ΓÇô November 29, 1980) was an American journalist, social activist, and devout Catholic convert; she advocated the Catholic economic theory of distributism. Day "believed all states were inherently totalitarian," and was considered to be an anarchist and did not hesitate to use the term. In the 1930s, Day worked closely with fellow activist Peter Maurin to establish the Catholic Worker movement, a nonviolent, pacifist movement that continues to combine direct aid for the poor and homeless with nonviolent direct action on their behalf.

The cause for Day's canonization is open in the Catholic Church, and she is thus formally referred to as a Servant of God.

The Long Loneliness is her autobiography, published in 1952 by Harper & Brothers. In the book Day chronicles her involvement in socialist groups along with her eventual conversion to Catholicism in 1927, and the beginning of her newspaper the Catholic Worker in 1933.
