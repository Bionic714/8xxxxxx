Solid Steel (1st March) Strictly Kev breaks into the 4/4 electronics box and retrieves modular experiments, deep house grooves, classic electro and a touch of acid. Ninja & Big Dada artists Falty DL and Dobie make their mark, oldies from Air, Eon and Hashim feature and a fantastic new track from Food collaborator Natural Self features near the end.
