,221BBST,2013-03-03T20:07Z,"Congrats for the skull! Easily the best collection of films in 1080p in terms of quality and size. Keep it up! I like how you put in the best effort in encoding. Nobody can put it that way you do. Anyway, I read that you have 140+ films in queue. May I have an idea as to what they are? Just a few will do. Thanks and rock on!"
,joser116,2013-03-04T04:54Z,"dhjudasx, you are the best encoder here in terms of quality and size, but please, if you are planning to do Rise of the Guardians, please do it in full 1920 by 1080 HD. :) Your encodes would be perfect if you did all your releases like that. "

The list of movies is rather larger...

This is just i'd say just under half the movies I've already encoded so far ... some I've uploaded already mind you... but it's an old screenshot...

You are among MANY that mention ""Please upload in 1920x1080""... Are you among the ones that thinks all movie uploads should be uploaded this way?

Not trying to come off rude or offensive in any manner, but if that is the case, it'd be a huge waste of space and a significant reduction in quality to Encode a movie with all the Wasted Unused BLACK Bars.

Look up Aspect ratio my friend, There is RELATIVELY few movies that are actually presented in full 1080p. This is why you see numerous movies uploaded that are 1920x1040/1024/864/816/800/784.

The few movies that are fully 1920x1080 I DO indeed upload as such. Mind you I have in the past made a few minimal mistakes due to still learning the ropes on a few things or finding out that my dimensions were a bit off ... cutting between 8 or 16 pixels off the original films dimensions. Nothing to serious.

Either way... If a movie is indeed presented in 1080p.... it will be encoded as such."
,221BBST,2013-03-05T05:01Z,"@dhjudasx Wow, that's an impressive collection. Only if you have much faster connection. Looking forward to them. If ever, can you prioritize Indiana Jones films? It's okay if you don't need to.

Waiting for The Goblet of Fire to be here soon. I know it's in another torrent site (right now, I'm DL-ing from there). But the seeders are few. Would help to gain more seeders if it's uploaded here as well. Thanks very much!"
