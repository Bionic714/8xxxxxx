The Randi Rhodes Show

ItΓÇÖs Friday, ya bastids!


It looks like the rightwing has decided to deal with changing demographics by changing voting rights. And by ΓÇ£changingΓÇ¥ I mean ΓÇ£eliminating.ΓÇ¥ The world the rightwing envisions will have the old white aristocracy still running things no matter how much they are outnumbered by non-whites. I think the technical term for that is ΓÇ£South Africa, 1982.ΓÇ¥ The Justices are looking for excuses to strike down the Voting Rights ActΓÇöbesides the fact that it guarantees voting rights. They canΓÇÖt say that reason out loud, although Antonin Scalia comes pretty close.

The sequester kicks in at the end of today. I guess that makes today Sequester Eve. On Sequester Eve, families will sit around the dinner table. The eldest child will ask the ritual question ΓÇ£Why is this night different from all other nights.ΓÇ¥ And the parents will answer ΓÇ£Because this is the last meal weΓÇÖll have where we can be sure that the meat was inspected.ΓÇ¥ Sequester Eve is the night that Santa Boehner gets into his sleigh and flies over every home in America, crapping on all of them. There are 8 days of Hanukkah, 7 days of Kwanza, and 12 days of ChristmasΓÇöbut there are unlimited days of Sequester! This can go on for as long as Republicans can drag it out.

John Boehner has halted talks on avoiding the sequester. ThereΓÇÖs no sense in talking to him. You might as well be talking to a block of wood. ThatΓÇÖs what it looks like when youΓÇÖre talking to BoehnerΓÇÖs lacquered head anyway. He doesnΓÇÖt want to hear anything about raising new revenue. So please donΓÇÖt play any tape of him earlier, talking about raising new revenue.

On Sean HannityΓÇÖs show last night, Bob Woodward said the White House email that had put him into such a tizzy was code for ΓÇ£you better watch out.ΓÇ¥ Bob, when you look for threats to the public in policy decisions, youΓÇÖre being a journalist. When you look for threats in everyday speech, youΓÇÖre being paranoid.
