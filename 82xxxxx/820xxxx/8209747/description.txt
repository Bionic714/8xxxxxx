Info from Wikipedia:

Sweatshop Union is a Canadian hip hop collective formed in 2000 in Vancouver, when four politically minded rap acts Dirty Circus, Pigeon Hole, Kyprios and Innocent Bystander came together to produce their first album, which was published in 2001.

Known for an inventive and socially conscious sound, Sweatshop Union's music focuses on being "honest" commenting on issues ranging from the war in Iraq, the plight of the poor and working-class, to the negativity and misogyny of mainstream hip-hop.

All tracks were written by Sweatshop Union, except where noted.

Uploaders notes: This is my third upload of SU's work, I couldn't find their music anywhere in lossless format in the torrent community and took it upon myself to collect the CD's, rip them and upload them for ya'll.
