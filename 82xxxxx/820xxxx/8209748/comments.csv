,decolsin,2013-03-02T09:31Z,"works perfectly, thx!"
,kc4vdx,2013-03-02T17:33Z,"As always, perfect. Thanks!!"
,Ziggy2by2,2013-03-03T02:21Z,What I meant by my previous question Raikalo was; are you able to post every update of zygor due to the fact that you purchased it? Like do I need to purchase something to be the first to share it?
,Raikalo,2013-03-03T03:50Z,"Oh, yeah. My source(s) have purchased the entire collection and aren't afraid to share the whole thing. I typically get updates ~12 hours after release through the official website."
,Raikalo,2013-03-03T03:51Z,"Also, there aren't even legally allowed to complain about the torrents since Blizzard stated that no one is allowed to sell addons for World of Warcraft. Not that complaining would do any good... :P"
,Ziggy2by2,2013-03-03T16:48Z,"Gotcha, anyway you can share with me how I may go about getting various addons and sharing them with the community both WoW related and non wow? Without actually purchasing it myself? Just curious lol."
,Ziggy2by2,2013-03-03T16:50Z,"Like If I have a friend who bought the addon and gets the updates free, how do I make the updates into a torrent? Just make a copy of the updated addon and make it a torrent?"
,azra3l76,2013-03-03T18:51Z,thanks man
,Raikalo,2013-03-03T20:15Z,"I use uTorrent. Get the addon, in folder or zip form, then open uTorrent and hit File -> Create Torrent... (or CTRL-N), then follow the prompts. After you have the torrent, upload it on TPB and seed."
,Raikalo,2013-03-03T20:17Z,"And to actually answer your question, yes, if someone you know has the addon you want to upload just make a copy of the files and turn it into a torrent. It only takes about a minute for me to upload any given version of Zygor since I just use the AutoForm stuff in Firefox to fill in the tags, name etc."
,Ziggy2by2,2013-03-04T00:35Z,So you find the torrent on other sites and just give it to us here? sweet :)
,Raikalo,2013-03-04T05:31Z,"Sometimes I can find the updates ready to go from other sites/torrent sites, sometimes I have to do a little more work to get the functional."
