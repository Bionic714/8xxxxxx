Themelock.com themes are full of malware to take over the site. I do not know if they got any clean themes, but last one I used from them like Clockstone 1.2.3 was full of malware. So I am weary of these from them."

I understand, i have had the same experience with most of those types of sites. but the reality for me is this, i use them for demos on a server that can be sacrificed, when the client agrees to buy, i buy the theme. they are not expensive. i have memberships to theme clubs, but sometimes they do not have what i need for that look&feel.

as always, if you are making money with this, buy it. otherwise, hope for the best, it is the wild internet ;)

ps. i have had no problems with this theme"
