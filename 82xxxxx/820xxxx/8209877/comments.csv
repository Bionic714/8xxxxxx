BTW< what happened to Maher last week? Was he sick or doing something else that weekend? I checked HBO's site and they didn't mention anything about last week or what have you."
,Interpol5,2013-03-02T12:09Z,"Maher made a mention two weeks ago that ""we'll be away next week and return on March 1st"" and that he was going to be performing somewhere or something. No biggie.

I'm starting to be addicted to Bill Maher. I need my fix every week. With so much complete bullshit filling the airwaves through whitewashed corporate media and lying liars like Fox, it's really refreshing to have a SANE, REASONABLE debate among intelligent adults about the issues. And presented in a funny way! Long live Bill Maher."

,robert342,2013-03-02T22:51Z,Nobody is whining but the quality is terrible. It doesn't take much effort to upload a 1gig file.
,Jimmyxyz,2013-03-03T03:20Z,"Robert, If It's so easy maybe you could help us out and download it yourself.  You can read the Bytes (quality of video) before you download. Jesus, take some responsibility for yourself!"
