For those whose game stops working and won;t let you do anything after a second in the game, not even summon imps/etc, try this workaround. I managed to get mine to work on almost all versions, by quickly saving the game before the guy stops talking or at the very very start of the chapter, and then it will confirm the save. then it will freeze, but when I restart, I load the game and it works fine for the whole chapter. just a thought if anyone is having the same problems as I"
