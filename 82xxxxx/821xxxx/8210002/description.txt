"Full length CD album from Jerome aka Message to Bears, Oxfords premiere ambient folker. Here he brings us 10 tracks of his gorgeous acoustic guitar driven melancholy, beginning with the the aptly titled ΓÇ£Running Through WoodlandΓÇ¥, the track sets a menacing pace with layers of guitars and cellos. ΓÇ£Hidden BeneathΓÇ¥ is driven by a stomping pulse and delightful percussion. Plenty of glock action and viola sweeps, uplifting choral vocals and delicate piano lines, this is Jerome at his finest yet, showcasing a brilliant melodic ability, combining classical instrumentation into a folk/pop structure taking cues from bands such as Explosions in the Sky. This is an album that will leave you speechless every time you listen as you uncover new hidden details, textures and melodies. I couldnΓÇÖt be prouder to release this." - Dead Pilot Records
