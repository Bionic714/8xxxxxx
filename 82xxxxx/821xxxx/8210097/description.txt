The Zentimo application was developed to be a powerful external drive manager.

Honest Drive Speed Test 
 Most other drive speed testers measure only the readwrite speed of large files, displaying a theoretical drive speed. This is not related to real-life speed as we often write plenty of small files to external drives.
 Our investigations shows that some flash drives have worse performance than other ones on writing of small files however their top performance at writing large files are the same. 
 Zentimo measures the file readwrite speeds of 3 different file sizes: small files (32 KB), medium files (3 MB) and large files (100 MB) and displays all those measurements as well as an average. The average speed calculated by Zentimo reflects your drives real performance more accurately than characteristics from the vendor's specification.
