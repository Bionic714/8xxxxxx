Audio conversion software converts audio video file formats (3gp, psp, mp4, ipod, 

ext) from one form into another 

(for example, from FLAC into MP3). Many include the ability to select encoding 

parameters for each of the output file formats selected to obtain Voice, CD, 

Telephony and Radio quality sound.

A converter analyses the format information in the audio file and uses a decoder to 

decompress it to the raw audio. It then sends the raw audio to a coder executable 

which then applies the encoding information selected for the file format type. The 

tools that do this are often called codecs (a portmanteau of 'compressor-

decompress-or').
