- ""In Crysis 3, there is a known tessellation problem with Psycho when object detail is set to 'Very High.' In most cases, the character model experiences texture issues as well as causes unnecessary stress on the GPU, thereby drastically lowering the framerate on any system. The only current fixes are to decrease object detail or manually turn off tessellation. It is not know whether Crytek are working on a bug fix for this problem. """
