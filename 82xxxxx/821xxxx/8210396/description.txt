  Youth Lagoon is the outlet of Boise, Idaho's Trevor Powers' most personal hopes and fears, which he sets to dreamy yet tenacious lo-fi pop. While studying at Boise State University, Powers would go to the school's music building and write songs between classes, and he recorded what would become his debut album over winter break in 2010 in his bedroom, a kitchen, and a four-car garage - all settings that captured the intimate yet spacious atmosphere of his music. Powers posted his first Youth Lagoon song online in May 2011, sparking buzz that resulted in a two-album deal with Fat Possum Records. His first album, The Year of Hibernation, which reflects the wake of a breakup as well as Powers' struggles with chronic anxiety, arrived that September. The more expansive Wondrous Bughouse, which drew comparisons to vintage Pink Floyd and the Flaming Lips, was released in March 2013.
