  Named after a 1984 Coil single, How to Destroy Angels features Nine Inch Nails' Trent Reznor, former West Indian Girl singer (and Reznor's wife) Mariqueen Maandig, and Atticus Ross. Work on the project began a few months after Nine Inch Nails' final show in September 2009, and the following spring, the group made their debut with the digital single A Drowning and a video for the song ΓÇ£The Space in Between,ΓÇ¥ which premiered on pitchfork.com that May. Soon after, the band made their self-titled debut EP - which was produced by Ross, also NINΓÇÖs longtime co-producer - available as a free download. That July, How to Destroy Angels was released on CD through the Null label. In 2011, the group contributed a cover of Bryan Ferry's "Is Your Love Strong Enough" to the soundtrack of the David Fincher film The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, which Reznor scored. The following year, How to Destroy Angels prepared their second release, An Omen EP, which became their first major-label recording that fall. A full-length album was planned for 2013.
