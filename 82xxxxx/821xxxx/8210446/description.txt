Chess is a two-player strategy board game played on a chessboard, a checkered 

gameboard with 64 squares arranged in an eight-by-eight grid. It is one of the 

world's most popular games, played by millions of people worldwide at home, in 

clubs, online, by correspondence, and in tournaments.


Since the second half of the 20th century, computers have been programmed to play 

chess with increasing success, to the point where home computers can play chess at a 

very high level. In the past two decades computer analysis has contributed 

significantly to chess theory, particularly in the endgame. The computer Deep Blue 

was the first machine to overcome a reigning World Chess Champion in a match, when 

it defeated Garry Kasparov in 1997.
