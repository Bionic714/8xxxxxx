,Tiny Turtle ,2013-03-02T13:55Z,"For anyone considering downloading this version after seeing the theatrical cut: The difference is that this one has nine more minutes of backstory about Mendez and his son.

Note that it's an ""Extended version"" - Not a ""Director's Cut""."

You Rock My Friend..

I am Truly Grateful for the Comment and Information you provided.

Argo is one of my favorites in a long time..irritates me how good Afleck is...so when I see ""Extended"" my heart races..but ""how?"" etc..is this real? or more torrent site agit-prop?

So truly..I thank you..and if the ""Community"" were more tinyturtle and less ..umm..some others..it would be in fact ""perfect"".

So thank You..and I'll grab this one anyway..but now I know what to expect.."
,highresjunkie,2013-04-29T23:07Z,"This should say ""BRrip"" or ""BDRip"" in the title, not ""BluRay.""  ""BluRay"" is ONLY used when its a lossless encode. Since this is under 10gigs, it's obviously not lossless, and either a ""BRRip"" or a ""BDRip."" I suggest you learn the difference and start using correct labeling in your titles."

I hate to say this but you are a ""fucking idiot"" you always leave stupid comments, you always bash the people who are making content available if you have so much issues just go to the store and buy the movie, I am sure that will have the correct labeling.
BOZX and other uploaders keep up the good work."
