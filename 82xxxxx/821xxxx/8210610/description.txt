  Inspired by the dreamy underwater imagery of their collaborative short film, Dolphins and Porpoises, Rebecca Scott (vocals, keys) and Brian Cook (drum machine, guitar) formed the equally dreamy indie pop group Panda Riot in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania circa 2005. The band's buzzy guitar riffs, gossamer vocals, and swaths of synthesized distortion (the duo filtered their keyboards through a death metal pedal) gave a nod to early-'90s acts like Tender Trap, the Softies, and My Bloody Valentine. The duo handed out their debut handmade CD-R EP, Paper Airplanes, at their live shows in 2006, and they self-released their first full-length album, She Dares All Things, the following year. Panda Riot brought a couple new members into the fold, bassist Justin and drummer Melissa, soon after their full-length debut was released; Melissa soon parted ways with the band, and drummer Jose was brought on board to round out the group's sound. Panda Riot's sophomore EP, Far & Near, was released on the Mirror/Mirror label in 2010. The band's profile enjoyed a healthy boost in 2011 when they made an appearance at the 2011 New York Popfest, sharing the stage with like-minded indie pop acts Silver Swans, the Motifs, and Kids on a Crime Spree.
