* Plot :

John Matthews, the owner of a construction company, receives a call from his estranged ex-wife Sylvie Collins. His estranged son Jason is being charged for distribution of illegal drugs; while Jason is not actually a dealer, his friend set him up in a sting operation to reduce his own sentence after being caught. Jason's charges carry a minimum of a 10 year prison sentence which can only be mitigated by leading to the conviction of another drug dealer, but as he neither knows any dealers nor is willing to set up a friend, his situation seems hopeless. John currently lives with his wife Analisa and young daughter. He feels guilty because he believes Jason made a mistake due to being emotionally abandoned by his father, and he becomes desperate as he realizes that Jason may be killed before he finishes his prison sentence.

Using his connections, John arranges several meetings with the local US Attorney Joanne Keeghan, who is running a very aggressive anti-drug offensive in order to bolster her chances in her Congressional race. Joanne agrees to reduce Jason's sentence if John can inform on a drug dealer but states that he'll receive little help from her and that the risk will be all his. Agent Cooper leads a task force which will monitor any dealings John arranges to use as evidence for an arrest. John searches through his employee records and finds an employee on his payroll with two former distribution convictions: Daniel James is now very strictly leading a clean life to avoid a third strike as he now has a wife and young son to care for. John offers twenty-thousand dollars if Daniel will simply introduce him to a dealer. Daniel initially refuses but later agrees so that he can move to a safer apartment for his son, though he is not aware that John is acting as an informant.

Daniel introduces John to Malik, an extremely dangerous high-ranking local drug dealer, who like Daniel also has two strikes. Using the explanation that his business can not stay afloat in the current economy without a supplement to its revenues, John offers to Malik that he can run nearly limitless amounts of drugs at almost zero risk in his freight trucks. Due to being a legitimate business, the trucks avoid suspicion and carry too much freight to thoroughly search. Malik agrees under the condition that John and Daniel drive the initial run themselves.

John and Agent Cooper arrange for several wire taps to be put in place to catch the transactions involved. John drives to the pickup point near the Mexican border. In the process, a rival gang ambushes the pickup, but John manages a daring escape, impressing cartel kingpin Juan Carlos "El Topo" Pintera, whose cartel successfully fights off the ambushers. John successfully completes his end of the deal, delivering the drugs to Malik while under surveillance by Agent Cooper. Agent Cooper betrays his deal with John when Malik mentions a meeting with higher cartel members than himself: with Cooper hoping to catch the higher priority targets, he refuses to arrest Malik during the deal. John meets with Keeghan and Cooper. Keeghan claims Cooper did the right thing and refuses to reduce Jason's sentence unless John cooperates in a second meeting. John agrees only if Jason is released immediately upon the job being completed rather than just a reduction in sentence. Around this time, Daniel finds out about the arrangement John made with the police and is furious, saying that the cartel will kill John, Daniel, and their families. John and Daniel send their families into hiding.
