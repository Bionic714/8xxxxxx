An unusual item: a documentary about sound engineer Jim Fosgate, who has been directly and indirectly responsible for the creation and development of the home theatre system and hifi products in general.  His greatest achievement is Dolby Pro Logic II, which took him years to refine and was released to market in 2000, eventually winning him a special Emmy award in 2003.  The documentary provides an overview of his life by direct interviews with him, his family, close friends and archive video/pictures.

This is a direct rip of the DVD as sent to me by Jim Fosgate.  I don't think it had an official release so I thought it might interest those who want to know more about pioneers of technology like him.
