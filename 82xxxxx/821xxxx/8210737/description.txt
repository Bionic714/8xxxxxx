This movie charts the rise of the Corporate State, and examines the future of obedience in a world of unfettered capitalism, globalization, staggering inequality, environmental change combined with intellectual and cultural debasement. 

While the film predominantly focuses on US corporate capitalism, the compelling graphics and somewhat hypnotic pace creates are eerie, foreboding mood of an imminent 'Brave New World' or '1984'. 

For those nearing a new realization of today's reality, this may bring it all together. 


This is a film based on the book "Death of the Liberal Class" by journalist and Pulitzer prize winner, Chris Hedges. It was made completely of clips found on the web. Music by Clark (warp.net/records/clark)
