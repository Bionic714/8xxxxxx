Notes:

I usually don't do anything other than 720p/1080p encodes, but this movie is a personal favorite and there aren't many good torrents for it. It's definitely a "B movie" and not many people have heard of it, but it's very underrated. The TV series 'Sordid Lives' is a prequel series to this movie. The source is standard widescreen DVD [480p] since no blu-ray or HD version has ever been released. Delta Burke, Leslie Jordan, Beau Bridges and Olivia Newton John star in this "black comedy about white trash."
