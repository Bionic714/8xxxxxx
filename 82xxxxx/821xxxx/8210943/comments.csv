[V],thenoobish,2013-03-02T15:31Z,May I ask you why you bother to upload this already existing torrent? The only thing you are doing is splitting the swarm..
[V],Gh0stNet,2013-03-02T15:48Z,just may i ask what the your problem with that as this is being done on all the torrent ??
[V],thenoobish,2013-03-02T16:26Z,"No. It is not being done on all the torrents. The problem is that when the first torrent is trying to build up a healthy seeder/leecher ratio, you upload another one, and the process must start over from the beginning.

More duplicate torrents = shittier seeder/leecher ratios."
