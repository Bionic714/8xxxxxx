Emmanuel Levinas (1906-1995) was a distinguished French philosopher and Talmudic commentator of Lithuanian Jewish origin. He derives the primacy of his ethics from the experience of the encounter with the Other. For Levinas, the irreducible relation, the epiphany, of the face-to-face, the encounter with another, is a privileged phenomenon in which the other person's proximity and distance are both strongly felt: "The Other precisely reveals himself in his alterity not in a shock negating the I, but as the primordial phenomenon of gentleness." To meet the Other is to have the idea of Infinity.

He had a major impact on the young Jacques Derrida, a fellow French Jew whose seminal "Writing and Difference" contains an essay, "Violence and Metaphysics", on Levinas. Derrida also delivered a eulogy at Levinas's funeral, later published as "Adieu Ã  Emmanuel Levinas", an appreciation and exploration of Levinas' moral philosophy. In a memorial essay for Levinas, Jean-Luc Marion claimed that "If one defines a great philosopher as someone without whom philosophy would not have been what it is, then in France there are two great philosophers of the 20th Century: [Henri] Bergson and Levinas."
