,Fluid56,2013-03-02T20:45Z,"i never gave this game a fair shot, mostly because the name of it is so generic and bad. I remember it vividly though, the name stuck with me because I thought it was such a poor decision. 

project IGI would have been fine. but the ""i'm going in"" sounds totally off-putting and out of place.

titles aside, you made it sound good. maybe it's worth a shot."
