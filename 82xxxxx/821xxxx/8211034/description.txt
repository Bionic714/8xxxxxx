Hi Friends,

  I love Project IGI I'm going in, and this game is the inspiration for all the PC games that I have been playing for a long time now. But it has been a long time since I played this game, so I thought of playing it and found some graphics glitches with my new card (GTX 650). 


It was a big headache to me as I cannot play the game, only I can see the loading screen with some green color lines crossed over. After a pain taking search for the fix in all the forums, I am happy to tell you that I have got it :)

Instructions:
-------------
1.  Download this torrent -----&gt;   http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/3373055/PC_-_Project_IGI_1_-_Im_Going_In_-_Full_ISO_._No_RIP_SHIT

2. Install the game, then copy and paste the two files from the folder "crack" to your installation directory and replace the files, then run the patch"Crack Project IGI". For eg in Windows 7 x64 bit, paste here ---&gt; C:Program Files (x86)Eidos InteractiveProject IGIpc 

3. Mount the image of Project IGI using power ISO or Ultra ISO.

4. Extract the folder you have downloaded with this torrent (Project IGI graphics fix), then copy the two files "IGILoader" and "InjectIGI.dll" and paste it in the installation directory (C:Program Files (x86)Eidos InteractiveProject IGIpc).

5. Right click on "IGILoader" and set the compatibility to "run this program in windows XP Service pack 2" and run as Administrator.

6. Thats it.... Enjoy the Game....


Thanks to "mastermanmaster" for uploading the ISO file of Project IGI.
