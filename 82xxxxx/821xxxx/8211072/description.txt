Press Reviews:

"A compelling exposition of how authors, printers, booksellers and readers competed for power over the printed page... The richness of Mr. Johns's book lies in the splendid detail he has collected to describe the world of books in the first two centuries after the printing press arrived in England." ΓÇö Alberto Manguel, Washington Times

"[A] mammoth and stimulating account of the place of print in the history of knowledge... Johns has written a tremendously learned primer." ΓÇö D. Graham Burnett, New Republic

"A detailed, engrossing, and genuinely eye-opening account of the formative stages of the print culture... This is scholarship at its best." ΓÇö Merle Rubin, Christian Science Monitor
