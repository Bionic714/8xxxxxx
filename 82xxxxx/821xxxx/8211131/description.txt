Summary:

Grubbs Grady has stiff red hair and is a little big for his age, which means he can get into R-rated movies. He hates history and loves bacon, rats, and playing tricks on his squeamish older sister. When he opts out of a family weekend trip, he never guesses that he is about to take a terrifying journey into darkness. Hungry demons and howling werewolves haunt his waking nightmares... and threaten his life.  - Goodreads Summary of Lord Loss (The Demonata #1)

Note: A scary, vividly scary, read that entrances readers within the first book! Be known that readers have come out shaken, but have loved this series anyways! Mainly for young adults, but is recommendable to older audiences as well.
