Have you ever wished you could go back and remake a decision that changed your life? Anne Malone finds a music box that could let her do just that. Every time she lifts the lid, her world changes just a bit. She repeatedly uses the box, hoping to return to the moment when she might have prevented a tragedy. But each use proves to be more dangerous, and Anne must decide if she's willing to risk everything she has to get what she most wants 

Quality is DVD rip but from the lifetime movie store so pretty awful quality for the cost of this and no title page included.
