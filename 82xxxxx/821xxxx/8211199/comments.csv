As I am recently disabled and unable to work, therefore unable to afford another quality vinyl rig, your uploads have given me great joy. Thanks for taking the time to rip them properly. If only I had the money, I'd do it myself. Lord knows I've got the vinyl.  Thanks again and keep up the great work. I check in at least once a week and am always surprised. :)"
