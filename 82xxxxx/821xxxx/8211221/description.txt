Generationals is the collaboration of Ted Joyner and Grant Widmer (formerly of Eames Era). Oranges Band founder Daniel Black engineered and produced the record in the style of his heroes ? George Martin, Phil Spector, Jeff Lynn, and Quincy Jones ? with meticulous attention to detail and a willingness to make the recordings sound old. The result is one of those ""first record"" moments that blissfully wills its listeners into repeat listens. RIYL: Squeeze, The Shins, Weezer, Richie Valens.
