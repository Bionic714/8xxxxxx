In the last days, there are many antichrists. Read through 1 John 2:18-27 as we learn the Biblical definition of antichrist and how this looks in the world today. We are called to be separate from any diminishing of the Lord Jesus. As we abide in Him, walk steadily in what is true since the beginning; Jesus is God
