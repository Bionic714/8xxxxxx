Anyone who has seen the TV show ΓÇ£Doomsday PreppersΓÇ¥ has probably laughed at the extreme measures which some preppers have taken to ensure their survival. The truth of the matter is, most preppers aren't that extreme; but rather, are normal people who see what is going on in the world around them, and simply wonder how long it will be before they are the victims of such problems. Instead of deciding to forget it and have another beer, they decide it's time to do something.
While there are many who view prepping as a radical fad and laugh at those who spend their spare time collecting supplies and learning survival skills, the truth is that every day, somewhere in the world people are facing a disaster. From hurricanes, to tsunamis, to financial collapse, to war, the world is full of things that take away our comfortable life, creating "the end of the world as we know it."
Ask any of the victims of Hurricane Katrina or Superstorm Sandy and they can tell you that the world they knew had ended, to be replaced by a much harder one; one in which survival wasn't guaranteed.
