Introducing a beginner's guide to creating a spectacular xeriscape landscape. Xeriscape is a landscape design using native plants that require very little water and maintenance. Contrary to popular belief, xeriscaping can be beautiful.

Xeriscape first became popular in drought-stricken areas where water was becoming scarce. One of the most drought stricken areas in the US is Las Vegas, Nevada. Lake Mead, the city's largest resource for water, has dropped to a record low. And it continues to drop. The white "bathtub ring" around the canyon that surrounds the lake is proof that one of the cities' most precious resource is disappearing. Vegas isn't the only city experiencing drought conditions.

Climate changes are happening all over the world. Now, more than ever before, people are becoming aware of preserving water and making a difference by reducing their water consumption. One of the easiest ways to reduce your water consumption is by creating a xeriscape landscape.

Whether you want to save time, money or water, xeriscaping is the answer. A no to low maintenance landscape means you won't be spending your weekends working in the yard. You'll have time to enjoy life. A lower water bill means money in your pocket. In some locations, water authorities offer residents rebates and incentives to replace grass with native landscapes. That's means more money in your pocket. With water quickly becoming a commodity rather than a convenience, the environmentally conscious are installing xeriscaping. Learn how you too can save time, money and water.
