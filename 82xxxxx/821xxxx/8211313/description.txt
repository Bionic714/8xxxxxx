Naruto Shippuden (UNCUT) - Episode 164 (WEB-DL - 1080p)
-------------------------------------------------------

Naruto Uzumaki wants to be the best ninja in the land. He's done well so far, but
with the looming danger posed by the mysterious Akatsuki organization, Naruto knows
he must train harder than ever and leaves his village for intense exercises that
will push him to his limits. Two and a half years later, Naruto returns to find that
everyone's been promoted up the ninja ranks--except him. Sakura's a medic ninja,
Gaara's advanced to Kazekage, and Kakashi... well, he's the same.

Naruto hits Pain with his Sage Jutsu-perfected Wind Style Rasen Shuriken.
Although he succeeds in defeating Ningendo, the remaining Pain quickly
confronts him. Shikamaru and the other Leaf ninja want to assist Naruto
by joining the battle, but now that Naruto has mastered Sage Jutsu, they
would only get in his way and are forced to watch from a distance. Gamabunta,
Gamahiro, and Gamaken take on Chikushodo's giant summon creatures while
Fukasaku and Shima prepare to break the Rinnegan's link. However,
time is ticking away until Naruto runs out of Sage Mode.
