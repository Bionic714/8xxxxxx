Intensity's been repacking other scanners work and redistributing it as their own for over a decade now.  Bloody shame."

[V],RubrumPopulus,2013-03-02T19:42Z,"I'm sorry, but it isn't spam.  I'm simply bringing to light, to the good users of this site, the douchebaggery that Intensity has been doing for years.  And giving them the means to get the original release(s) that Intensity is jacking. :)  It's all about creating awareness.
And I have no issue with you, unless you're part of Intensity.  I have issue with the content. :)  So no need to be hateful."
