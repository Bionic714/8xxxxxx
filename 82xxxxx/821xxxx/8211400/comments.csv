Great Pacific 02 (2012) (Tarutaru-Novus-HD)
Intensity's been repacking other scanners work and redistributing it as their own for over a decade now. Bloody shame.
If you want the original release, from the actual scanner who provided the work to the community, you can find that here: https://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8049704/Great_Pacific_02_(2012)_(1440px_amp_amp_2048px-HD)_(Tarutaru-Novus)

Intensity: How about you start actually doing something useful, rather than taking other scanners work, converting it to pdf and releasing it as your own.  It's lazy at best.  Buncha shameless hacks...."
