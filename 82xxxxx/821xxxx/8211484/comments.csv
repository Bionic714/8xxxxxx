,FieroGT,2013-03-03T21:50Z,"AFTER OPENING LOGO BLACK SCREEN / CRASH FIX:
I had the same problem, here is how to fix it...
Start the game, and right when the Rebellion logo comes up, 
hit ALT-ENTER, to make a window, the game will continue to load, 
then once u get to the main menu, u can hit alt-enter again to go back to full screen.
I have to do this just about every time I want to play..... 
(but not always.... its quite odd that way...)

Good Luck! "
