,Kortzen,2013-03-02T23:38Z,"If you guys want to avoid the hassle of trying to make it work on windows 7, go to ""good old games"" (google it). They specialise in selling old games and making them work on newer operating systems like Windows Vista, 7 and 8.
They have Thief Gold available there and it works perfectly on my Windows 7. Thief 2 as well.
They just recently released System Shock 2 which works with recent windows versions!

(No I dont work for GoG, but I respect what they do and I personally find their services agreeable)."

For Thief 1/Gold I had to install it on an XP VM and then copy it to my Windows 8 machine and apply the patch.  For thief 2 you can use the patcher to pull the data from the CDs and install everything at once."
