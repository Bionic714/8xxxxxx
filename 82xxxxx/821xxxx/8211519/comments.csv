The Pearl Jam Movie!! That's right, Made in 1995 by the band when Jack Irons was drummer and filmed over the course of the tour in Japan, Taiwan, Australia and New Zealand...it's half tour documentary and half movie (over 3 hours long).
This movie was apparently scrapped by the band at the final mixing stage for some unknown reason. The counterbars for post production mixing & editing are even visible (small) in the corners of the screen...but they show the date and time of th clip being filmed, as well as the master timer for the whole movie & some other technical stuff I don't understand. This is legit & unbelievably rare!! I've only met 2 other people in my life who'd even heard of this movie before. It full of weird little skits by the band (like Ed and Jack acting out some strange Godzilla attack on the beach - hilarious!), airplane, backstage & soundcheck footage of all the band members, the band on the streets & taking in the culture of the countries they're visiting, Ed smoking a fat dube while watching the local Japaneese tv, etc. 

Like I said, this is incredibly rare. The overall sound and video of the tape are VERY GOOD and this is a master tape...not a copy of a copy or anything like that. I'll give a very brief rundown of what this incredible 3 hour movie contains
