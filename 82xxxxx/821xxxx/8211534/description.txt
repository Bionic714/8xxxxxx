Leslie Coleman "Les" McCann (b.1935-) according to lore took only 4 piano lessons.

He was inspired by Erroll Garner and gospel music, which is easily noticed.




"This compilation has selected the tastiest treats made by the heaviest mojo

hands from the King's kitchen where the vibe rises like yeast to make McCann's 

jelly-roll-soul doughnuts."   (TOM TERRELL  Feb 1998)



These tracks off the Limelight label (Verve) predate McCann's instant stardom

in 1969 with the release of Montreaux jazz festival recordings SWISS MOVEMENT.

An earlier version of the smash hit  COMPARED TO WHAT? .. is included in this

compilation of Limelight recordings (1964-67)
