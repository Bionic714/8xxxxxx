Everything you need will already be downloaded.  (mobi, pdf,&epub) I have no clue if it's just with my pc, but everything works fine. (even the cover!?!) sorry if it does this, but i hope not!  luckily just cancel it at the bottom (path) and everything will still work.  sometimes i love technology, and the sometimes i want to smash my pc! Anyway enjoy!"

Otherwise if it stopped there, just skip it in your torrent client.  I tried fixing it (explaining the millions of torrents uploaded)"
