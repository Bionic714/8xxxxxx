,beliha1,2013-03-03T17:48Z,"""oldtimer48"", this isn't tarantino's ""Django unchained"", this is a movie from 1966 named Django! 
and how can you rate the video and audio 10/10 when you clearly haven't checked it out!!"
,oldtimer48,2013-03-04T00:30Z,"@ beliha1, you obviously didn't read what I wrote, I didn't say it was ""Django Unchained"", I clearly said it was a Quentin Tarantino spaghetti western dubbed in English, what are you on about? Oh and for your information I have watched the movie and stick by A/10, V/10"
