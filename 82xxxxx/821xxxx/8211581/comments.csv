,IAMBBMK,2013-03-02T20:13Z,"Doesn't work, let alone won't even launch. it keeps on saying OpenAL32.dll is missing from your computer, try reinstalling the program to fix this. So I did multiple times and still gives me the same error. So I downloaded the .dll off the web and then it gives me another error saying it can't load a the game because it can't find it in OpenAL32.dll, is this supposed to happen? If not can you tell me what I am doing wrong?"

,Aman321,2013-03-02T20:55Z,@IAMBBMK where you placed that .dll file
,IAMBBMK,2013-03-02T21:31Z,I placed it in the game's directory where the launcher and that stuff is. Is that the wrong location?

,ihvnacntt,2013-05-23T15:06Z,"Thank you for finally uploading this -- I've been waiting for so long.
That being said: I'm so glad I didn't pay for this. This ""game"" is complete garbage, even after so many months of development and hype."
