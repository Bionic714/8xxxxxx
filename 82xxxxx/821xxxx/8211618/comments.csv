It's interesting that, despite your upload being of a superior bit rate, one of TPB's sacred and holy ""green skulls"" has more seeders than you with an upload of lesser quality.

This stupid skull system needs to go!"
,ttcttc,2013-03-03T18:22Z,"The ""Skulls"" refer to the Uploader, not the Torrent itself. There's nothing stupid about it and it doesn't have to go. You just need to understand it for what it is and means."

I think these are complementary in cases of flame wars:


""Condemnation without investigation is the﻿ highest form of ignorance""
~Albert Einstein

""One should never ascribe to malice, that which is adequately explained by incompetence""
~Napoleon"
