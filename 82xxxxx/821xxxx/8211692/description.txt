"The main character spends his summer vacation at his aunt and uncle's bed and breakfast in a southern Japanese coastal town. Features from the first game, like collecting and bug battles, return, along with new facets, like swimming. The player controls the main character for the thirty-one days of August 1975."

Straight rip from PS2 DVD to iso.
Works at least with Pcsx2 emulator r5559 (see http://http://www.pcsx2.net/ ).
Iso not tested with actual Ps2.
You won't have much fun playing this without at least some basic knowledge of written and spoken japanese.
