The Wizards of Wiki say:

The Sleeze Brothers was a comic book limited series published by Epic Comics in 1989, lasting for 6 issues. A collection of the six issues were later released in 1990, along with a final extended issue in 1991. It was written by John Carnell, with art by Andy Lanning. The characters were spun-off from a Doctor Who comic strip by Carnell entitled "Follow That TARDIS!", published in Doctor Who Magazine #147 (April 1989), though they are not generally considered part of the Doctor Who extended universe.

The title characters in the Sleeze Brothers comics were loosely inspired by Jake and Elwood Blues from the cult movie The Blues Brothers, but were actually based on Andy Lanning's two cousins, Phil and Pete Carmichael. These two characters appeared on the front cover of the collected edition. However, other influences also shine through, specifically Ridley Scott's hugely popular movie Blade Runner.

Get it, pay it forward. Kudos to the creative team and the scanners.
