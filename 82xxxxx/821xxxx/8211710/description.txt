The Sisterhood of Steel was a series of comics by Christy Marx.

In the series, a society of warrior-women has survived for generations by hiring out its elite forces. Each Sister has been trained in the art of battle since childhood. The series focuses on the life of Boronwë, a young woman coming of age in a world where survival rests on the edge of a blade.

They were first published as an eight-issue limited series by Epic Comics, a division of Marvel Comics that specialized in creator-owned books for an adult audience. Mike Vosburg did the artwork.

Marx and Epic were in negotiations to continue with a series of graphic novels, until this was derailed in a disagreement over content restrictions on the books.

Subsequently, Marx took the series to Eclipse Comics, which in partnership with Moonfire Productions (Marx's self-publishing imprint), published the graphic novel, Boronwë: Daughter of Death, in both paperback and hardcover. Peter Ledger illustrated it.

This torrent is for the eight issues from epic. I do not have the Eclipse graphic novel. If anyone does, please upload!

Get it, pay it forward. Kudos to the creative team and the scanners.
