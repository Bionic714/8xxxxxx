Change For a Dollar was offered on YT and others free for all to share. Websites and blogs featured it everywhere. This beautiful little video went viral.  Now it's pay per view (1.99 for 2 days) available only throughSynergyTV | GiftPlayLove which also requires installation of an additional app to view.  Supposedly all the money goes to charity but when have we heard that one before? Administrative cost anyone???

When it was available people shared as holiday wishes, teachers played it for their classrooms and well, people just shared it freely for such a poignant message.

Some comments on fbΓÇªchange for a dollar but 1.99 to view?  Sharon's reply, she doesn't control price (who does then if it's all about spreading love?) she only controls which charity (but makes no mention of which charity).  There are some charities that I fully support and some I have disfavor towards.  This not only removes my choice that my 'change for 1.99' supports but doesn't even tell me what I am supporting.

That it is only available on FB is also something I have issue with.  Not everyone wants a FB account.  Playing it for classrooms further indoctrinates children to sign right up.

Regardless of the politics involved it is a beautiful little video.
