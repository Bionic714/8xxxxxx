Alcohol calculator is a powerful tool for the calculation of the residual alcohol in the blood. Apart from the actual calculation, this tool provides you a quick selection of the most common alcoholic drinks with the appropriate glass sizes - for example if you do not know how much alcohol is in a drink, or how much of the drink is in the glass. This tool also calculates temporal predictions for 0.5, 0.3, 0.1 and 0.0 pm.
