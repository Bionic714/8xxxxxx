Cyndi.Lauper.Iconography.March.2013.SiriusXM-OutQ108.VBRMP3-CLDD.mp3

Premiered on SiriusXM OutQ on March 2, 2013.
And will be repeated throughout the whole month.
Cyndi is OutQ's GAY ICON for March 2013 (long overdue!)


I am uploading this under MUSIC, although it's technically an interview.  Larry gets Cyndi talking about topics we don't hear in all the usual interviews.   SHINE and SEX IS IN THE HEEL are played (along with parts of 4 80s songs.. I'm sure you all can guess which ones).

SHARE BACK what you download...and Enjoy!
