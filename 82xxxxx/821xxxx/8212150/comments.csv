,kicksaw,2013-03-03T02:22Z,"QUICK INFORMATION ABOUT TORRENT:

I don't know why installer is named 2mar 2013 instead of 28feb 2013. The truth is there was NO HOTFIX at 2march, but at 28 february.

http://dont-starve-game.wikia.com/wiki/Version_History

there is link to patch notes for Don't Starve.

In fact, there is no diff if installer is named as march one, but don't be afraid.

Tested, scanned by web, and my AV soft too, so you can enjoy that game :)"
,john2s,2013-03-03T04:38Z,"kicksaw, there was several hotfixes after 26 february.
The last one was on 2 march http://forums.kleientertainment.com/showthread.php?10872-A-Winter-s-Tale-Update-Release-Notes&p=98704&viewfull=1#post98704"
,kicksaw,2013-03-03T21:50Z,"Wow, did not know, then that version include it too :) (tested, my game didn't crashed at 12-4, so it's ok)

So there was release at 2 march too.

My game didnt update on steam so was almost sure there is no patch for that too :) Good to know ;)"
