,bobbo_nut,2013-05-01T21:47Z,"DON'T INSTALL ENTERPRISE

Its the exact same thing as Ultimate, but uses server activation. This means that ANYTHING you use to activate Windows is temporary (short of the genuine product). That is why all of the activation fixes work for other versions but not Enterprise.
(Enterprise is typically used for businesses etc, that need to activate a bunch of computers at the same time)"
