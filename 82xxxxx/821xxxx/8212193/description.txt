A very succinct Wikipedia says:

Stalkers is a twelve issues comic book limited series created in 1990 by Jan Strnad, Mark Verheiden and Mark Texeira, and published by Marvel Comics imprint Epic Comics.

It concerns a series of people, some mentally unstable, kidnapped to become disposable assassins. A co-story concerns a nihilistic detective and a psychic.

Get it, pay it forward. Kudos to the creative team and the scanners.
