Pete Seeger, who began recording in the early 1940s, is perhaps the most influential figure in the American folk revival, a walking repository of song who's had an immense influence in popularizing folk music with mainstream audiences. 'We Shall Overcome' is an expanded version of a classic 1963 live album that offers an excellent example of Seeger's activist passion and good-humored humanity.
