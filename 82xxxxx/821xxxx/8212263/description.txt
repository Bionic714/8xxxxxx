Hitlist breakdowns

Every week TPB member, shipjolly, uploads several torrents called "Hitlists". These torrents represent everything that was scanned for that particular week: current, old and OOP. I've found these to be very, VERY helpful in plugging holes in my collection.

This torrent is an easily searchable .rtf file I created that lists the contents of each of these torrents available on TPB, excluding his separate 'Hitlist Adult' and 'Hitlist Non-English' uploads, from 4/11/12 thru 2/20/13, making it current as of this writing. 

To find these torrents, search for "Hitlist" under "Other" and download what you need. 

Now everyone say, "Thank you, shipjolly!"
