SecurityCam is a powerful monitoring and motion detection software that monitors web camera, connected to computer, and enables users to keep an eye on their properties from a local location or remote location via the Internet. The program stays out of way in system tray area, and waits for a movement at the front of the camera. Once movement is detected, SecurityCam starts either video recording or makes a snapshot of a picture. The program can optionally do some other functions like playback a warning sound.
