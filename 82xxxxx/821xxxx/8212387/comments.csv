[V],HighCode,2013-03-03T11:51Z,Comments related to quality and dl speed very appreciated. I know how hard is to log in and comment lol.
,karimbaraka,2013-03-03T12:32Z,I'm sure quality will be as great as always :)
,phase700b,2013-03-04T03:50Z,"We just watched it. Great movie! Fantastic quality. I think it would probably take some serious side by side comparisons to tell this encode from the original disc.
As far as speed goes it did seem to download unusually fast last night. Thanks again HighCode."
[V],HighCode,2013-03-04T19:27Z,"Thx mates.
If you're good pirates and keep this torrent active I'll upload more movies with optional audios in the future. 
This torrent was a test."
,VBRate,2013-03-12T18:56Z,"Hey HighCode,  dl speed is in the 50 kB/s range which isn't great but is to be expected when the seed to leech ratio is 1:3.  Your torrents are just too popular!  Maybe you should take a lesson from Yiffy, drop your AV quality to the floor to reduce the file size and improve the overall ratio.  Who cares what it looks and sounds like as long as it downloads quickly.  Makes you wonder why they bothered buying HDTVs.  Another suggestion, when up'ing multi audio track torrents, (if it's within your control) is to provide a torrent file download link in addition to the magnet link.  This way we are immediately presented with the popup file list and can de-select unneeded tracks.  Thanks again for all the great work..."
[V],HighCode,2013-03-24T08:41Z,"All torrents uploaded here are uploaded also to other public sites.
All other sites give you the actual torrent file with the orifginal metadata, then you can chose the files to dl.
On this page upper right part under Comments is Info Hash. Copy that long hash key and paste it in google then you'll find a site from where you can get the torrent file.
@VBRate
If you like Yiffy's torrents with ""dropped  AV quality to the floor"" to use your words you're free to dl his torrents and don't bother with my torrents.
 I don't need any lesson from Yiffy and especially not from you thank you very much."
,ironarun,2013-04-05T22:15Z,"Ok I've had this file downloading for 72 hours now with an average speed of just 18kbps! And I still have another 20% to go. Guess Richard Parker will be dead before I manage to see this movie again! 

Please seed people! 

We all love to share good things, dont we? :D"
,ironarun,2013-04-07T08:12Z,"So I finally managed to download just the mkv file. I tried playing it on my HDTV but it says audio format not supported. I changed that to AC3 lav (which has worked for Avatar & Dark Knight Rises earlier) but it still wouldn't play. And now it just says ""Playback not available"". 
Can anybody help me with anymore suggestions? Thanks."
