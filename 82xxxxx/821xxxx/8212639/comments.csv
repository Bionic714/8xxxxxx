,Beetlejuicexx,2013-03-24T02:22Z,"I'm guessing this person (or whoever uploads is buying these or has a friend who buys these.)

You do understand older GOG games are relatively inexpensive to purchase for yourselves... $1.99 to $9.99 on most if not all old titles.

Leisure Suit Larry: Love for Sail is $6 - get someone to buy it for you if you can't afford it.

Neverwinter Nights Diamond Edition is $9.99
Still doesn't break the bank, really. "
