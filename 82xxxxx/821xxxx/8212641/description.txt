Written and illustrated by 'Marvel Zombie' cover artist Arthur Suydam! Cholly is a gaunt Road-Warrioresque adventurer. Flytrap is his sumo-like (and naked!) companion. Together, they travel a post-apocalyptic world reminiscent of the wild west. 

This torrent contains: the 'Original Adventures', culled from the 'Epic Magazine' by Marvel and collected as a TPB; the four-issue mini, 'The New Adventures of...' published under the epic Comics line; and the four-issue mini 'Cholly and Flytrap' published by Image in 2004.

Much love to the creative team and scanners. Get it, seed it!
