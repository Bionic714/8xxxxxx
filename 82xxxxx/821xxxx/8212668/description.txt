The emphasis is on laffs as some of the dumbest, most muscle-bound super heroes ever born rampage through London, with poor Max Tarrant, director of super heroes under the Ministry of Superheroics, caught in the fray. This two-issue series is written by Stephen Jewell, with art by Gary Chaloner and Gary Martin. 

Much love to the creative team and scanners. Get it, seed it!
