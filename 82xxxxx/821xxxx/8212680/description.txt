This four-issue series was created by Stefan Petrucha (writer) and Barry Crain (artist), and published by epic Comics in 1993.

It has been suggested that you should:

GASP as gumshoe LANCE BARNES snips the wrong wire on an ICBM and ends the world!

SCREECH as he guiltily wanders the post-nuke landscape with his one-legged secretary Peg!

READ what Stan Lee called full of "amazing originality and off-beat humor"! 


Much love to the creative team and scanners. Get it, seed it!
