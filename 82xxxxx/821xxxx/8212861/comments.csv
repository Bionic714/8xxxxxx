,Carmine233,2013-03-09T16:42Z,Will you upload One Piece Season 4 Voyage 5 before it comes out aswell?
,ProtoFate,2013-03-14T07:25Z,"Yo man, so far so good on this download. I'm just curious though, how exactly do you acquire the DVD release prior to it actually being released? And on that note, do you plan on doing this consistently with each release? Regardless, thanks bro!"
,SaTaNiK1,2013-03-16T03:58Z,RightStuff.com ships the DVDs as soon as they get them from what I am told. I get them as soon as someone uploads the uncompressed ISOs on another site. I will be encoding One Piece until it completes and uploading the episodes as soon as the uncompressed ISOs are available on that other site. I may get them before release date or after. There is no way to tell. Depends of if the uploader.
,bonzaib,2013-03-19T02:49Z,Fantastic as always! Keep it up!
,122jdh,2013-03-19T22:53Z,"Can you tell us the name of the site with the isos?

,Maj0ra,2013-03-20T06:14Z,"You're seriously a fucking God among men for this upload. Super early too. I""ll be ""ganbarre""ing your uploads from now on. If you're current with the anime, you should know that's one of the best things someone can do... :D"
,SaTaNiK1,2013-03-20T07:15Z,"AsianDVDClub.org Registrations are Closed and I don't have any Invites so don't ask.

I have a LOT of stuff to upload that people would be excited about but I am uploading a few HUGE torrents on ADC right now to get my ratio up so I don't have to worry about it down the road. ;) No ETAs, No Hints."
