The Death of Klinghoffer is a 1991 opera with music by American composer John Adams, and featuring a libretto by Alice Goodman. The opera is based on the real-life events of the 1985 hijacking of the cruise ship "Achille Lauro" in the Mediterranean by Palestinian militants, which ultimately resulted in the death of Jewish-American tourist Leon Klinghoffer, an elderly wheelchair-bound man celebrating his wedding anniversary.

De facto banned from production in North America due to fervent protests over its depiction of the Palestinians, this is most likely the only chance most of us will get to see it. This recording was done in 2003 by the London Symphony Orchestra, conducted by John Adams himself, and directed by Penny Woolcock.

If you have any issues, it'll be a result of me never having done this whole "DVD Ripping" thing before. Just shout at me for being a moron in the comments, and I'll see what I can do to fix things.

Incidentally:
The soundtrack (From a 1991 Op√©ra National de Lyon staging, if I am correct) is available as part of eterman's excellent "A John Adams Collection" which can be found here:
