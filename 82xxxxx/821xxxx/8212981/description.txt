Piece by Evgeny Morozov (author of "The Net Delusion") explaining how people (esp. governments, see: Hillary Clinton's speech on Internet Freedom) are quick to embrace the cyber-utopian approach to the Internet and believe that it has the power to topple authoritarian governments.  However, these same governments can be empowered by the Internet as well, using censorship and collecting data on dissenters in order to halt activist activities and further imprison activists. In short, we naively believe that technology equates to progress while ignoring the potential pitfalls to these same technologies that we believe will bring progress.
