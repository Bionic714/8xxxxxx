,rainbowzTPB,2013-05-21T00:28Z,"FYI: This is a 1911 publication called ""First Lessons in Bee-Keeping"" published by the American Bee Journal. Obviously, the info is a tad dated as methods have changed somewhat in the last 100 years, but still very interesting. 

Although in PDF format, it is actually a scan of the original booklet, some 198 pages in length with numerous engravings and illustrations. The language is charmingly archaic. Being a scan and not a computer-written volume, the content is not searchable in a PDF reader although there is an index.

At just 17 Mb, it's certainly worth the bother to download if just for interest sake in what beekeeping was like at the beginning of the previous century."
