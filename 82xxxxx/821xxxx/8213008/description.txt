Buy this CD. Play it often. Learn all the words to "Mari-Mac" (I dare you). And go see the greatest band in the world in concert. There is no way you will be disappointed.
From start to finish, this set is a winner. "Run Runaway" starts the ball rolling and it doesn't stop until track 15. People will recommend this band if you like Irish Rock, but I say if you like music AT ALL you have to love these guys. The original compositions are every bit as good as the re-workings of traditional Irish songs. You will sing, you will dance and you will have as much fun as you can possibly have with you clothes off or on (pants required in public, please).
If you own this CD, you should hunt up a copy of "Fire in the Kitchen" produced by Paddy Moloney of the Chieftains which has GBS doing an even better version of "Lukey."
Sit back, take a sip of the old black rum, and enjoy.
