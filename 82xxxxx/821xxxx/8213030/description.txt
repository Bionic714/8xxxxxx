Following the hype and riding the wave of the indie folk revival comes Matthew Hegarty of Matthew and the Atlas. After a slot supporting Mumford & Sons, he is in good hands at Communion Records if MumfordΓÇÖs phenomenal success is anything to go by. With a voice best described by Ben Lovett of Mumford as a ΓÇÿUK cross between Bon Iver and Ray LaMontagneΓÇÖ, this newcomer is quickly gaining a following with his earthy sounding voice and pared down folk style. MatthewΓÇÖs husky voice is a perfect match for banjos, hand claps and drumming, with his sweet melodies swathed in the delicate backup vocals of fellow folk artist Lindsay West. 

The opening song on the EP ΓÇÿI Will RemainΓÇÖ is an awakening folk anthem, with the energy of Mumford & Sons, but with a little more depth and soul than the foursome. This is probably the standout on the EP, whilst ΓÇÿVeins In Your HistoryΓÇÖ with its old blues sound and Matthew singing ΓÇÿOh my love, youΓÇÖre not aloneΓÇÖ is just stunning. ΓÇÿIn The WinterΓÇÖ is slow and gentle, with a thunderous reprisal at the end. Finishing off the EP as if finishing off an album (we hope one is in the works), but essentially leaving us wanting more from the singer. 

Whilst Bon Iver was beautifully sad, the subject matter was almost nauseating. Matthew and the Atlas is all at once world-weary and soulful with a sense of hopefulness about the music, rather than depression.

MatthewΓÇÖs songs are stories, emotional and with the honesty that some of his folk compatriots lack. I would almost hate to see Matthew and The Atlas become as commercially successful as some of his peers, bur rather that he stay the best kept secret. The kind of singer you tell your friends about and sneak off to see whilst everyone is looking the other way.
