Michael Trent and Cary Ann Hearst never fail to impress. "Shovels and Rope" is by far one of the greatest albums ever put together. With two re-vamped songs, two covers and six brand new tracks, you can't hide from the musical genius that comes straight from the hearts of Charleston's finest. From their sad tale of having to leave home in 'Gasoline', to their downright country cover of Jump, Little Children's 'Mexico', this album will have you from start to finish, and it'll even leave you begging for more.
