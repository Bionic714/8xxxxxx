For x264 MP4 with AAC audio, a bow to HBO credits them with the best possible quality:
V=10
A=10
.
So, this is quite odd (probably shows me naive). I use ReplayMediaCatcher, two versions
3.11 downloaded this file as .MP4, 4.4.3.0 downloads it as .MOV  they are identical.
In XP, I hover over the MP4 and it says "MPEG-4(QuickTime)"
I demux the MP4 (x264, AAC) and remux and now it says "MPEG-4(BaseMedia)version 4"
