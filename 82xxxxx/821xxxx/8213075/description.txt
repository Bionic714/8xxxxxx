Kate Wolf's arrangements got a little more complex on this album, with occasional string arrangements and drum tracks. "Leggett Serenade" especially sounds like an attempt (probably inevitable) to craft a track with more pop/adult contemporary appeal. Largely, though, it's the same dependable sparsely arranged, strong material, with support from noted musicians Nina Gerber, Tony Rice, Norton Buffalo, and Darol Anger.
