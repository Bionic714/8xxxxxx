Grinderswitch was a southern rock band formed in Warner Robbins, Georgia. They recorded for Capricorn Records, but never rose to same success as their label mates, The Marshall Tucker Band or The Allman Brothers Band.

Grinderswitch was formed in 1973, while original members Dru Lombar, Larry Howard, Joe Dan Petty and Rich Burnett lived together in farm, practicing and writing songs. Joe Dan Petty was working for The Allman Brother Band at the time and supported other members of Grinderswitch, before they got a record contract.

After Capricorn Records signed them, first album "Honest to Goodness", came out in 1974. It started never ending touring for them, taking brakes only to record new albums. Grinderswitch performed side by side with Lynyrd Skynyrd, Wet Willie, The Charlie Daniels Band and other southern rockΓÇÖs greatest stars.

Grinderswitch's debut album starts off well enough with the Dickey Betts-driven "Kiss The Blues Goodbye," which makes for a riveting introduction. Nothing else here really matches its tightness or excitement, and the songwriting isn't up to the standard that the group would reach over the next couple of years. There's decent playing throughout, but apart from the opener, "Homebound" is the only track off the original album that begins to demonstrate Grinderswitch's potential, Dru Lombar's soulful voice finally finding a vehicle through which he can express himself properly. That, and a live bonus track ("You're So Fine"), are more representative of this band than most of the rest of this early effort.
