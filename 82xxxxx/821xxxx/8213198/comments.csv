I don't normally comment on the quality of a movie but in this case if i can stop just one person from watching this movie i can die a happy man. I was expecting b-grade but OMFG this is so much worse. It's like a small town in Alaska or somewhere decided to make a movie and use the towns people as the cast.  It was by far the worst movie i can recollect seeing... LOL i just had to say.

Cheers"
