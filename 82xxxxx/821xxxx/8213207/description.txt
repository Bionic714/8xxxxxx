Review by Orin Kerr, on a book titled "Privacy at Risk: The New Government Surveillance and the Fourth Amendment" by Christopher Slobogin.

"Slobogin proposes a new approach to the Fourth Amendment designed to appeal to such a Court...Argues that the government should have to justify all types of surveillance with at least some sort of cause.  In particular, the Constitution should require the government to justify all investigatory tactics with a sufficient basis to think the tactic will work in light of its perceived intrusiveness...book offers a new approach to the Fourth Amendment".
