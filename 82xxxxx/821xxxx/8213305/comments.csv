,farghalyahmad,2013-03-07T00:40Z,any screen shots?
,khems,2013-03-09T06:44Z,The movie is two screens combined into one. I couldn't watch it
,POWERxHOUSE,2013-03-10T14:56Z,"you downloaded a 3d movie, 1 format is 2 screens side by side. you need you get your t.v. to convert it.  If you don't know this, you probably shouldn't be downloading 3d movies?   if you DO in fact have a 3d tv, then look for the split screen conversion"
