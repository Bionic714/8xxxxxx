I noticed the larger size, higher bit rate and sample rate of this one as compared to your other upload of the same title. Is there an audible difference in the sound quality between the two? Thanks for sharing your music.

It should. I haven't downloaded them, but this one has a much higher sample rate. I'm going to delete my old 24 96 vinyl rip in favor of this one. This uploader's work is incredible and top notch. I known I won't disappointed."
