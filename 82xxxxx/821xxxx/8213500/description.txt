Jackie's advice ranges from dealing with cannibalistic hens to providing the healthiest and cheapest chicken feed, from finding the best dairy goat to using the safest do-it-yourself method of bull castration. Jackie also explains the reasons for hanging meat, the proper way to dispose of large animals, and even shares a dog food stew recipe from her old boss.
