Bears of Alaska

Nature Documentary hosted by Johnny Kingdom, published by BBC in 2013 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

Johnny Kingdom takes the trip of a lifetime to Kodiak Island in Alaska in search of brown bears. As a lad, amateur wildlife filmmaker Johnny poached salmon from Exmoor rivers with his bare hands, but his lifelong ambition has been to see how the real experts - brown bears - do it, as they fish for sockeye salmon in the remote Alaskan rivers. It is also the biggest challenge he has faced as an amateur cameraman. Johnny finds himself struggling to keep his camera still without a tripod and because his hands are shaking when faced with a giant bear less than 30 metres away. The other challenge he faces is the weather. In the summer, this part of Alaska is plagued by heavy mists and fog, which makes the journey by seaplane to the remote areas where the bears live even harder to achieve. Johnny takes advantage of being grounded by filming humpback whales, tufted puffins and sea otters. But it's the bears he's come for and Johnny finally gets the shots he wanted - bears catching salmon.
