 : It's the day before Mike Frame's fiftieth birthday and his quiet provincial:
 : life is suddenly falling apart. But perhaps it doesn't matter, because it's:
 : not his life in the first place. He has a past that his partner Miranda and:
 : step-daughter Sam know nothing about, lived under another name amidst the  :
 : turbulence of the revolutionary armed struggle of the 1970s.               :
 :                                                                            :
 : Now Mike is seeing ghosts; a dead ex-lover and an old friend who wants to  :
 : reminisce. Mike can no longer ignore the contradiction between who he is   :
 : and who he once was. Which side was he on back then? And which side is he  :
 : on now?                                                                    :
