 : Sammy Davis Jr. lived a storied life. Adored by millions over a            :
 : six-decade-long career, he was considered an entertainment icon and a      :
 : national treasure. But despite lifetime earnings that topped $50 million,  :
 : Sammy died in 1990 near bankruptcy. His estate was declared insolvent, and :
 : there was no possibility of it ever using Sammy's name or likeness again.  :
 : It was as if Sammy had never existed.                                      :

 : Years later his wife, Altovise, a once-vivacious woman and heir to one of  :
 : the greatest entertainment legacies of the twentieth century, was living in:
 : poverty, and with nowhere else to go, she turned to a former federal       :
 : prosecutor, Albert "Sonny" Murray, to make one last attempt to resolve     :
 : Sammy's debts, restore his estate, and revive his legacy. For seven years  :
 : Sonny probed Sammy's life to understand how someone of great notoriety and :
 : wealth could have lost everything, and in the process he came to understand:
 : Sammy as a man whose complexity makes for a riveting work of celebrity     :
 : biography as cultural history.                                             :

 : Matt Birkbeck's serious work of investigative journalism unveils the       :
 : extraordinary story of an international celebrity at the center of a       :
 : confluence of entertainment, politics, and organized crime, and shows how  :
 : even Sammy's outsized talent couldn't save him from himself.               :
