 : Following the massive complexity of The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle--Haruki     :
 : Murakami's best-selling, award-winning novel--comes this deceptively simple:
 : love story, a contemporary rendering of the romance in which a boy finds   :
 : and then loses a girl, only to meet her again years later.                 :
 :                                                                            :
 : Hajime--"Beginning" in Japanese--was an atypical only child growing up in a:
 : conventional middle-class suburb. Shimamoto, herself an only child, was    :
 : cool and self-possessed, precocious in the extreme. After school these     :
 : childhood sweethearts would listen to records, hold hands, and talk about  :
 : their future. Then, despite themselves, in the way peculiar to adolescents,:
 : they grew apart, seemingly for good.                                       :

 : Now, facing middle age, finally content after years of aimlessness, Hajime :
 : is a successful nightclub owner, a husband and father, when he suddenly is :
 : reunited with Shimamoto, propelled into the mysteries of her life, and     :
 : confronted by dark secrets she is loath to reveal. And so, reckless with   :
 : enchantment and lust, Hajime prepares to risk everything in order to       :
 : consummate his first love, and to experience a life he's dreamed of but    :
 : never had a chance to realize.                                             :

 : Bittersweet, passionate, and ultimately redemptive, South of the Border,   :
 : West of the Sun is an intricate examination of desire, illuminating the    :
 : persistent power of childhood and memory in matters of the heart.          :
