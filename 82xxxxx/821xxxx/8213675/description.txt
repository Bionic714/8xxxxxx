This large book is perfect for the kitchen. Departing from canning, this installment of the "Ask Jackie" series covers everything from vegetables to vinegar. Spanning from dairy, to grains, to meals, to fruit and vegetables, its pages provide delicious recipes, handy hints, and practical advice for those learning to cook or perfecting their skills as a self-sufficient homesteader. This fits nicely with both Water Bath Canning and Pressure Canning to provide a truly comprehensive guide to food preparation.
