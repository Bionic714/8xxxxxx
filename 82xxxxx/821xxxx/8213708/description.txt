 : From a prizewinning young writer, a brilliant and inventive story of love, :
 : lies, and inspiration.                                                     :
 :                                                                            :
 : Fairy-tale romances end with a wedding, and the fairy tales don't get      :
 : complicated. In this book, the celebrated writer Mr. Fox can't stop himself:
 : from killing off the heroines of his novels, and neither can his wife,     :
 : Daphne. It's not until Mary, his muse, comes to life and transforms him    :
 : from author into subject that his story begins to unfold differently.      :
 :                                                                            :
 : Mary challenges Mr. Fox to join her in stories of their own devising; and  :
 : in different times and places, the two of them seek each other, find each  :
 : other, thwart each other, and try to stay together, even when the roles    :
 : they inhabit seem to forbid it. Their adventures twist the fairy tale into :
 : nine variations, exploding and teasing conventions of genre and romance,   :
 : and each iteration explores the fears that come with accepting a lifelong  :
 : bond. Meanwhile, Daphne becomes convinced that her husband is having an    :
 : affair, and finds her way into Mary and Mr. Fox's game. And so Mr. Fox is  :
 : offered a choice:                                                          :
 : Will it be a life with the girl of his dreams, or a life with an           :
 : all-too-real woman who delights him more than he cares to admit?           :
 :                                                                            :
 : The extraordinarily gifted Helen Oyeyemi has written a love story like no  :
 : other. Mr. Fox is a magical book, endlessly inventive, as witty and        :
 : charming as it is profound in its truths about how we learn to be with one :
 : another.                                                                   :
