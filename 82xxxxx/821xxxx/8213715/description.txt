 : You are about to travel to Edgecombe St. Mary, a small village in the      :
 : English countryside filled with rolling hills, thatched cottages, and a    :
 : cast of characters both hilariously original and as familiar as the members:
 : of your own family. Among them is Major Ernest Pettigrew (retired), the    :
 : unlikely hero of Helen Simonson's wondrous debut. Wry, courtly,            :
 : opinionated, and completely endearing, Major Pettigrew is one of the most  :
 : indelible characters in contemporary fiction, and from the very first page :
 : of this remarkable novel he will steal your heart.                         :
 :                                                                            :
 : The Major leads a quiet life valuing the proper things that Englishmen have:
 : lived by for generations: honor, duty, decorum, and a properly brewed cup  :
 : of tea. But then his brother's death sparks an unexpected friendship with  :
 : Mrs. Jasmina Ali, the Pakistani shopkeeper from the village. Drawn together:
 : by their shared love of literature and the loss of their respective        :
 : spouses, the Major and Mrs. Ali soon find their friendship blossoming into :
 : something more. But village society insists on embracing him as the        :
 : quintessential local and her as the permanent foreigner. Can their         :
 : relationship survive the risks one takes when pursuing happiness in the    :
 : face of culture and tradition?                                             :
