,canopener,2013-03-03T23:18Z,"Nice, thanks BOZX for a higher bitrate version... So, what is the final file size after you remove the other 3 languages in mkvmerge?"
,kiwij,2013-03-04T10:03Z,"I have a feeling there wont be a 48fps release, because there is no common 48fps bluray standard?"

,TheOriginalCoda,2013-03-07T23:02Z,No if you want to see 48fps it has to be in the cinema at least for the next few years.

,sakkispb,2013-03-12T18:25Z,"Is this the original copy of the bluray disc?

Does it have DTS-MA 7.1, or it's just the source of the audio and the actual is DTS 5.1?

Thanks

,sakkispb,2013-04-01T07:13Z,"A: 12/10
V: 12/10
Perfect sound and video quality.

Amazing torrent... Thank you.
It's worth to watch it on home cinema like i did, or in a proper pc build.

***
If anyone is interested in adding subtitles on blurays (m2ts, ts, or mkv, mp4), so he can watch from home theater or ps3 stand alone, just use RipBot264. 
You can hardcode image subtitles (sup, srt...) and retain the exactly same quality in both a/v.

You reencode the bluray. Although you must have a powerful cpu, it’s very demanding."
,griiid,2013-04-11T00:00Z,res is still crap though 1920x800... black bars...
