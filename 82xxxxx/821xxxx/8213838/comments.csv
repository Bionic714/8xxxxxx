,ext23,2013-03-04T18:37Z,"good to have this torrent, BUT track 2 has some seriously weird volume issues (not sure how that even happens) and the single ""right here"" is clearly sourced from somewhere else as it's encoded at a higher bitrate to the other tracks.

thanks to the uploader but if this kind of thing bothers you (it bothers me) wait for the 320kbps rip."

,drewobvs,2013-03-06T06:18Z,"Really dig this band. But I am wondering if this leak is before any mastering, except for maybe ""Right Here"". I am even hoping that this leak is before a final mix. There are a lot of rough edges to these mixes and it sounds a bit muddy. With all of that said, you can still here that it is really well produced and I am hoping that this is just a non mastered/not final mix of the album. This happened with Brand New's Deja Entandu way back in the day. I still have that un-mastered leak. 

Anyone else notice some strange mixes on this album. ie. vocals being oddly low in some parts of songs?"
