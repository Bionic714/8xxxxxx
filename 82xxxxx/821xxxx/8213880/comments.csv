,since1871,2013-03-03T23:08Z,"ty, great fight !"
,StayPlation,2013-03-04T23:13Z,"A: 4/10
V: 6/10

Quality was so bad I just deleted it. "
,TrashCompaqtor,2013-03-05T02:18Z,"Quality is great as always... BUT, the judge's decision for the first fight (Bahadurzada vs Kim) was cut out!!!

Now I'm wondering what else is cut out... I just started watching it and it pisses me off when something is missing.  I know who won the fight (Kim, obviously) but fjdkaslfjdlsa;fjsadl  makes me angry.  Yes, I'm commenting on the right release, I'm not an idiot like half the commenters on this site!  :)"
,TrashCompaqtor,2013-03-05T02:55Z,Might I also add that the audio does sound like it was recorded with a potato when listening with headphones.  Not too bad with regular stereo speakers though.
,TrashCompaqtor,2013-03-05T02:58Z,"Ok, so with regular stereo speakers at 1/4 volume it sounded ok.  Just tried it with earphones and it sounds like it was recorded with a potato.  Video is perfectly fine."
,TrashCompaqtor,2013-03-05T02:59Z,"LOL  gotta love this site and its timeouts with missing comments that appear later.  Thanks for making me look foolish, TPB"
,chris92300,2013-03-06T02:08Z,Audio is fucked up
,godgali,2013-03-09T00:53Z,thanks Scene4all!   appreciate the upload

,Stiff_123,2013-03-10T02:33Z,"I meant to say.....

3dot14 is a Redneck

mentallyours is a slow fucker & his wife hates him for it...

StayPlation is a Console Whore

For those wondering...
The sound issue is they used a low Audio bit rate so it sounds a little watery but not that bad.
The Video is quite good actually!

Thanks scene!!!"
,Stiff_123,2013-03-10T02:41Z,"Oh!
One More Thing.

If you have the k-lite codec pack installed and use the ffdshow audio decoder then use the re-sample function and set it to 48Khz highest quality it sounds close to perfect...

Just thought I'd throw that out there!
Peace!"
