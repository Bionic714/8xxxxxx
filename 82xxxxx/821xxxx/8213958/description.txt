Article by Peter Krapp unpacking three core misunderstandings between old and new media and the 'hacktivist' culture.  The misunderstandings in short are as follows: i. hackers are portrayed as hoodlums; ii. the terms activists and cyber-terrorists are used interchangeably; iii. greater secrecy leads to greater security.  In this digital age, 'hackers' are seen to be more and more of a threat -- but to who? And what defines a 'hacktivist'? Would the leaderless movement, Anonymous, be seen as such? Krapp ties in this discussion of hacktivists to cyber-terrorism, security, freedom of speech, among other contentious topics today.
