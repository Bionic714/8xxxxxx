http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaglyph_3D#Anaglyphic_Color_Channels
with a high quality Dubois least squares encoder,
recent FFmpeg supports it as new default, see
libmpcodecs/vf_stereo3d.c

I find it more eyes-friendly and better color quality than 1970/2001 red-cyan full color.

?"
,woprr,2013-03-06T15:15Z,"As You wish, has only been a suggestion :-)

Maybe You know the Final Destination 4 official 3D DVD with R/C full color encoding, 
that really hurts my eyes and brain, waste of money, newer 3D DVD releases available here are using a G/M- System, too, but U.S. seems to prefer still R/C."

G/M glasses are available from Ebay USA and EU for 2GBP...6EUR as R/C, looks like manufactured in China, so should be available in pacific area, too.

From seeders stats it looks like most users rather get the SBS bluray rip torrents to encode to their favourite Anaglyph System.

May I ask what anaglyph image processor product You're using?"

And showing up there with this topic may get us into law trouble, because it's not known yet if our efforts to provide a ""preview before buy 3D equipment"" with Anaglyph is considered by the content industry as ""marketing support for spreading 3D"" or attack against their 3D business models, any statements seen?"
,woprr,2013-03-12T23:03Z,"Yeah, looks like You're pretty right about the 3D hazzles:

This critic of AACS-, HDCP- DRM, says in short that if You buy 3D/HD equipment You get a virtual 70's Coins Jukebox in Your TV room which may fail due to AACS system errors or take down signals by AACS LA (Over Internet, TV- Broadcast, BluRay Movie) at any time."
,woprr,2013-03-12T23:04Z,No way. Donate the rippers and seeders with this money until they drop the crap.
