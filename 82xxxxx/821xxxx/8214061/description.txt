German Automatic Rifles 1941ΓÇô45: Gew 41, Gew 43, FG 42 and StG 44 (Osprey Weapon 24)
by Chris McNab

DESCRIPTION:
This book explores the origins, development, combat use and lasting influence of Nazi GermanyΓÇÖs automatic rifles, focusing on the Gew 41(W), Gew 43/Kar 43, FG 42 and MP 43/StG 44. The Blitzkrieg campaigns of 1939ΓÇô40 convinced many observers that most infantry combat took place at closer ranges than the 750ΓÇô1,000m. From 1941 GermanyΓÇÖs arms designers took note and produced a new series of infantry firearms. This study not only provides a detailed technical description of each weapon, but also explores how the firearms performed on the battlefields of World War II. The combat takes us from the FG 42 in the hands of Fallschirmjager at Monte Cassino through to StG 44s being used by Waffen-SS soldiers on both the Eastern and Western Fronts. Postwar service is also studied, such as the Gew 43ΓÇÖs adoption by the Czech Army and the StG 44ΓÇÖs use by the Viet Cong in the Vietnam War. Setting each firearm in its tactical and historical context, and employing striking photographs and full-colour artwork, firearms expert Chris McNab sets out the absorbing story of this distinctive and influential series of weapons.
