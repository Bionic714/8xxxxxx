,Bennyslob,2013-03-03T18:11Z,I grabbed it and have been playing it for about 30 minutes. It seems to be legit. Excellent game! Vote on greenlight for the devs I say.
,xMyran,2013-03-03T21:48Z,"Hey guys, one of the developers here.
So I guess Hammerwatch has an open beta now :), this torrent seems legit, but if you want to make sure you can get it from http://www.hammerwatch.com/builds/beta_v2.zip
Please read the readme file though, this is an early build and it has some major issues, we're currently working on fixing most of the more obvious stuff and we'll have a new build in a few days.
Oh, and please vote for us at http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=122788084

,xMyran,2013-03-06T20:25Z,"We released a newer version of this as an open beta which you can get here, http://www.hammerwatch.com/builds/hammerwatch_beta.zip
So with this version out you probably don't want to download this torrent anymore, it's more or less the same content, but with some bugfixes and some tweaking."
