     VMware Fusion is a software hypervisor developed by VMware for        
     Macintosh computers with Intel processors. Fusion allows Intel-       
     based Macs to run operating systems, such as Microsoft Windows,       
     Linux, NetWare or Solaris on virtual machines, along with their       
     Mac OS X operating system using a combination of                      
     paravirtualization, hardware virtualization and dynamic               
     recompilation.                                                        
                                                                           
     VMware Fusion 5 has been revamped to take advantage of new            
     technologies only available in Mountain Lion, Windows 8 and the       
     latest Macs to deliver a Windows on Mac experience never seen         
     before.
