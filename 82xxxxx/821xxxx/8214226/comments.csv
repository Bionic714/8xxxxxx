,aaronj69,2013-03-05T20:28Z,"Unrar-ing this file Garmin_CN_Eu_2010.31NT_unlocked_img_jcv_3d gave me an error. Is there any problem with this, or its just my Mac Unrar? "
,aaronj69,2013-03-05T21:00Z,"Ups, Sorry. last comment is for other post."
,grakk,2013-03-06T00:48Z,"@aaronj69
And apparently another time, too (2010)?"
,Ghostspirit,2013-03-06T01:53Z,"Thanks Ipmark -- found a pretty thorough walkthrough on which files does what here, which helped me a lot. http://gpsunderground.com/forum/garmin-tutorials/10744-garmin-additions-files-asr-g2s-db-3d-what-how-update.html

I ended up loading JCV (Hi-Res), G2S and Timezone on my box, and it works without issues! Thanks a ton for uploading Ipmark!"
,monkmarr,2013-03-08T03:30Z,Bought the NA & EU maps for an older unit but does not include these bits for my newer Nuvi so very much appreciate these being available each time!!!  TY
,MasterQt,2013-03-23T16:56Z,"Thanks m8, works fine here! (Nuvi 1490tv)"
,Zeagle,2013-04-17T05:26Z,"This works perfect - thank you Ipmark. In case this helps anyone, I have a US 3490 lmt that I update legit. I keep a 32GB micro SD ( G.Skill brand) in the device. I remove it only to load maps on it and currently have this europe nt as well as israel and middle east and n africa nt maps. JVC and ASR europe also on the SD and it all works smoothly. Each gmapsupp is loaded in sequence with a number assigned to it 2,3...and the nuvi finds it. garmin got 329 for this and I am totaly ok taking these maps. hope this can help..cheers"
