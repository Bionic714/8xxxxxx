   Climate and Conservation presents case studies from around the world of   
   leading-edge projects focused on climate change                           
   adaptation-regional-scale endeavors where scientists, managers, and       
   practitioners are working to protect biodiversity by protecting           
   landscapes and seascapes in response to threats posed by climate          
   change. The book begins with an introductory section that frames the      
   issues and takes a systematic look at planning for climate change         
   adaptation. The nineteen chapters that follow examine particular case     
   studies in every part of the world, including landscapes and seascapes    
   from equatorial, temperate, montane, polar, and marine and freshwater     
   regions. Projects profiled range from North American grasslands to        
   boreal forests to coral reefs to Alpine freshwater environments.          
   Chapter authors have extensive experience in their respective regions     
   and are actively engaged in working on climate-related issues. The        
   result is a collection of geographical case studies that allows for       
   effective cross-comparison while at the same time recognizing the         
   uniqueness of each situation and locale. Climate and Conservation         
   offers readers tangible, place-based examples of projects designed to     
   protect large landscapes as a means of conserving biodiversity in the     
   face of the looming threat of global climate change. It informs readers   
   of how a diverse set of conservation actors have been responding to       
   climate change at a scale that matches the problem, and is an essential   
   contribution for anyone involved with large-scale biodiversity            
   conservation.

  : its construction in the 3rd century BC until the Roman conquest of      :
  : Egypt in 30 BC. The library was conceived and opened either during the  :
