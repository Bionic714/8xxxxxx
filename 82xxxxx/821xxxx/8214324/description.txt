   How can each of us live Cooler Smarter? While the routine decisions       
   that shape our dayswhat to have for dinner, where to shop, how to get     
   to workmay seem small, collectively they have a big effect on global      
   warming. But which changes in our lifestyles might make the biggest       
   difference to the climate? This science-based guide shows you the most    
   effective ways to cut your own global warming emissions by twenty         
   percent or more, and explains why your individual contribution is so      
   vital to addressing this global problem. Cooler Smarter is based on an    
   in-depth, two-year study by the experts at The Union of Concerned         
   Scientists. While other green guides suggest an array of tips, Cooler     
   Smarter offers proven strategies to cut carbon, with chapters on          
   transportation, home energy use, diet, personal consumption, as well as   
   how best to influence your workplace, your community, and elected         
   officials. The book explains how to make the biggest impact and when      
   not to sweat the small stuff. It also turns many eco-myths on their       
   head, like the importance of locally produced food or the superiority     
   of all hybrid cars. The advice in Cooler Smarter can help save you        
   money and live healthier. But its central purpose is to empower you,      
   through low carbon-living, to confront one of societys greatest threats.
