   Despite a prolonged slump in the housing market, the demand for           
   residential green building remains strong. More than ever,                
   professionals need reliable information about how to construct or         
   retrofit livable, sustainable, and economical homes. With Fundamentals    
   of Sustainable Dwellings, Avi Friedman provides that resource. While      
   other books on residential green building are often either superficial    
   or overly technical, Friedman gets it just right, delivering an           
   illustrated, accessible guide for architects, developers, home            
   builders, codes officials, and students of architecture and green         
   design. Friedman charts a new course for residential buildingone in       
   which social, cultural, economic, and environmental values are part of    
   every design decision. The book begins with a concise overview of green   
   building principles, covering topics such as sustainable resources and    
   common certification methods. Each following chapter examines a           
   critical aspect of green home construction, from siting to waste          
   management options. Friedman provides basics about energy-efficient       
   windows and heating and cooling systems. And he offers innovative         
   solutions like edible landscaping and green roofs. Friedman knows that    
   in green building, ideas are only as good as their execution. So in       
   each chapter valuable data is assembled and a contemporary project in     
   which designers strove to achieve sustainability while adhering to        
   real-world constraints is featured. The result is a practical guide for   
   every professional in the burgeoning field of residential green building.
