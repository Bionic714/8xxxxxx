 : Long before blogs, tweets, and sound bites, people were telling the world  :
 : how they felt in brief, blunt bursts of information plastered on the backs :
 : of their cars. Whether they're political or religious, passionate or proud,:
 : controversial or corny, these brightly colored, boldly lettered mini       :
 : manifestos are declarations of who we are, where we stand, and what we'd   :
 : rather be doing. But as bestselling author and noted philosopher Jack Bowen:

 : than rolling one-liners and drive-by propaganda--no less, in fact, than a  :
 : wise, funny, poignant, contentious, and truthful discourse on the human    :
 : condition.                                                                 :

 : and scientists, If You Can Read This exposes the deeper wisdom couched     :
 : behind these slogans--or, as need be, exposes where they have gone wrong.  :
 : If you brake for big ideas, now's the time.                                :
