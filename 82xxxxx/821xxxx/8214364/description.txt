 : The Battle of Guadalcanal has long been heralded as a Marine victory. Now, :
 : with his powerful portrait of the Navy's sacrifice, James D. Hornfischer   :
 : tells for the first time the full story of the men who fought in           :
 : destroyers, cruisers, and battleships in the narrow, deadly waters of      :
 : "Ironbottom Sound." Here, in stunning cinematic detail, are the seven major:
 : naval actions that began in August 1942, a time when the war seemed        :
 : unwinnable and America fought on a shoestring, with the outcome always in  :
 : doubt. Working from new interviews with survivors, unpublished eyewitness  :
 : accounts, and newly available documents, Hornfischer paints a vivid picture:
 : of the officers and enlisted men who opposed the Japanese in America's hour:
 : of need. The first major work on this subject in almost two decades,       :
 : Neptune's Inferno does what all great battle narratives do: It tells the   :
 : gripping human stories behind the momentous events and critical decisions  :
 : that altered the course of history and shaped so many lives.               :
