,terjitt,2013-03-03T19:54Z,"Thank you so much.  I've always wanted to play this, but wasn't able to find any live torrents of it anywhere."
,terjitt,2013-03-05T06:34Z,"Well that sucks.  I waited all this time, and it won't run.  I get a whole list of general protection faults.  And the fixes posted online don't work. 

Really wanted to play this finally."
