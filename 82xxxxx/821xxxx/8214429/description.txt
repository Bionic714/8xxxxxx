You are Joseph Turok, once a member of Wolf Pack - the
most savage, merciless black ops squad of its time. Now,
you have been attached by special order to Whiskey
Company, an elite commando team, for what should have been
a simple mission: Capture and detain Roland Kane from his
fortress on a worthless, backwater planet. Kane is an
escaped war criminal, the once-legendary leader of Wolf
Pack...and your former mentor.
