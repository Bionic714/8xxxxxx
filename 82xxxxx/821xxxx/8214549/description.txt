NOTES:
I did not code the crappy hacks.  Most suck at injecting because the AJ coders
don't seem to give two shits and just use a MONSTER delay on their loader.  Well 
maybe they care but don't have a fucking clue ?  I will improve on their shit and
let you set a delay based on what you need.  Some games like AVA will need a 0 or 1 
seconds delay.  Others like APB could need 60 seconds.  Play with it and find a delay 
that works for you,

GUI requires .NET 2.5 runtimes
My MemoryLoader.dll needs VS2005 runtimes
