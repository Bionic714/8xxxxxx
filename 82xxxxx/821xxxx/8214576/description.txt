Galactus has converted humanity into his followers, and he's leading them to their doom! The planet-devouring demigod's only challenger is the hero he himself trapped on Earth: the Silver Surfer. It's a war for Earth's worship, but how much will be left when it's over?

A two-issue Silver Surfer miniseries (later collected as Silver Surfer: Parable), scripted by Lee and drawn by Moebius, was published through Marvel's Epic Comics imprint in 1988 and 1989. Because of inconsistencies with other stories, it has been argued that these stories actually feature an alternate Silver Surfer from a parallel Earth.
 
This miniseries won the Eisner Award for best finite/limited series in 1989.
