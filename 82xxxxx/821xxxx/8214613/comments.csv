I seed to at least 1:1.10!"
,citizendonny,2013-03-03T19:27Z,thank you. much appreciated.
[T],Hard2Find2,2013-03-03T21:38Z,No trucks at this time. I just do not have the bandwidth and time to dedicate to them. Could change at some point. I appreciate the seeds. Last season the race was usually dead after a few weeks. Glad more people are doing their part.
,SwedishMeatball,2013-03-03T23:09Z,"Racing, like most episodic tv torrents, is very short lived. Honestly, I would not worry about a torrent for a race not surviving for more than a few weeks.

Anything I can do to convince you to devote bandwidth to the NWTS???????"

,alissonpc,2013-03-04T12:50Z,Waiting for the Sprint race but downoading this! First time i'll see a Nationwide race.

Carl Edwards won the Sprint Cup race, not the Nationwide Race. 

I love it when a idiot opens his mouth and proves he is also a fool.

And that is that....."
