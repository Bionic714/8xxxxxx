,DJiF,2013-03-03T14:18Z,"dear sir. what do we do with the uncracked 777? could you, please, upload the working gauges? thank you."
,fskillerX,2013-03-03T14:24Z,"i know that its not cracked,that's why i upload it for someone who can crack it."
,Kantonnn,2013-03-03T15:10Z,"fskillerx what's wrong with you ???????
this the 999999x time we said to you: UPLOAD CS 777 WORKING GAUGES FILES !!!
go to your fsx folder, gauge folder, find the captainsim gauges put them in a file and UPLOAD IT.
And then we will be able to crack it.
If you don't, WE CAN'T CRACK IT.

Understand ?"
,camus_to,2013-03-03T15:13Z,"@fskillerX: The only way to crack it is to provide those activated gauges to here. You are not the first one to upload this great bird and someone have uploaded it here before, but no one can crack it. If you really want to share this bird, please upload those gauges.:)"
,fskillerX,2013-03-03T15:35Z,"i'll upload GAUGES tomorrow.and please don't be furious,im so sorry to take so much time to upload gauges files cuz i had a problem with my PC I'm using the PC from my office to upload this.and i don't have a good internet connection.
i'm so sorry again please."
,fskillerX,2013-03-03T15:38Z,the first one who upload this aircraft  is the 0.20 version not the full version 1.0
,turontado117,2013-03-03T17:29Z,fskillerX be sure you upload those gauge file and dont forget the ace777
,kingashi,2013-03-03T18:34Z,"@turontado117

,Eroxz564,2013-03-03T19:39Z,fskillerX take your time :) Just get everything up and then we can start make some progress :)
,turontado117,2013-03-03T20:36Z,hey im not giving him orders im just reminding him. cause he already upload the 1.0 uncracked then he upload this. so whats the purpose of uploading this stuff if it doesnt work right?
,mamadkalak,2013-03-03T20:52Z,"DUDE ARE YOU KDDING US ??? YOU UPLOADED THE INSTALLER WITH ANY CRACK :) AND NOW YOU CANT UPLOAD THE GAUGES FILES , YOU SHOULD SAY IT IF YOU DONT WANNA SHARE THIS WITH US :) SO IF YOU WANNA SHARE IT PLEASE UPLOAD THE GAUGES FILES AND IF YOU DONT WANNA SHARE THIS SAY IT HERE :) THANK YOU MAN "
,namco-nexgen,2013-03-03T22:16Z,"If you want, and if that's what you need, i will upload the 1.0, 1.1 update and the gauges files.

It will still require some sort of patching/reg done."
,Espana25,2013-03-03T22:40Z,OK i wont say much here but please to all those asking this guy to upload his working Gauges files please tell me your source ? what is your source behind the confirmation of those files working with the aircraft! ? 
,turontado117,2013-03-03T23:38Z,"@namco-nexgen please sir we really REALLY need it. and by the thank you for the ORBX stapleford

@mamadkala - yes youre right if this guys didnt want to share the files then he should just say it to us

@espana25 - if you still remember there's a user here who upload a captain sim 767 CRACKED! and the crack is the 767 gauge files and the ace767. i dont know if he do other things."
,turontado117,2013-03-04T00:28Z,fskillerX- please dude upload those files we really need it
,camus_to,2013-03-04T11:54Z,"Yes, we need to find out what the gauges we need so as to ask fskillerX to upload those gauge files. I think all the .gau files should be uploaded right?"
,camus_to,2013-03-04T11:57Z,"Yes, we need to find out what the gauges we need so as to ask fskillerX to upload those gauge files. But we don't know what the files are so I think fskillerX should upload an activated RIP files to here. Am I right?"
,turontado117,2013-03-04T21:22Z,hey fskillerX i thought you were gonna upload those .gau files by today so where is it? 
,fskillerX,2013-03-05T09:38Z,"i must tell you sorry i have a connection probleme with my home PC i use the office PC to upload this,and without connection i can't activate it,
but don(t worry i'll upload them tomorrow and i have to tell you all here FORGIVE ME and please EXCUSE ME , all these problems happens when i change to windows 8 pro."
,turontado117,2013-03-05T10:04Z,yes i agree to you @camus the rip copy is much better.
,camus_to,2013-03-05T15:50Z,"@fskillerX: You could get through here but you had had a connection problem before, a little bit strange here:P anyway, try your best to upload the RIP files and we all are waiting your great job!"
