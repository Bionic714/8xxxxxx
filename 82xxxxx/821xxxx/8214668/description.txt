There only were 13 episodes of this fun variety show
from 1970, headlined by future Carol Burnett Show regular Tim Conway.

But Tim was already guest-starring on Carol's show, and here she
returned the favor for the first time. This is his ninth show.

Series regulars here included McLean Stevenson and Art Metrano.
