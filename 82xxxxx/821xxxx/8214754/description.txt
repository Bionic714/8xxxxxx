Roy Shaw is the ultimate hardman, he has a cult status and commands a respect that few, even in the violent world he moves in, can equal. He was the original GuvΓÇÖnor, and the great rival of Lenny McLean. RoyΓÇÖs words speak for themselves: IΓÇÖm Roy Shaw. Maybe my name means nothing to you. Why should it? IΓÇÖm no actor, no showman, no wannabe celebrity. IΓÇÖm not loud or brash and I donΓÇÖt huff or puff or growl at anyone, but I live by a merciless code. For me violence is simply an accepted part of my profession ΓÇô the profession of violence. I donΓÇÖt exaggerate the violence I have inflicted. I canΓÇÖt excuse it and I certainly wonΓÇÖt apologise for it. If that makes me the devil, then the devil I am ΓÇô I havenΓÇÖt got horns sticking out of my head or cloven hooves and a tail, but if youΓÇÖre unlucky enough to have me coming after you then beware ΓÇô ΓÇÿcos hellΓÇÖs coming with me.
