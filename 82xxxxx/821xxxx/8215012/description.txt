DVDINFOPro is a DVD information program written in Visual Studio V2010 C++ for Windows XPSP2, Vista, Windows 7 and later. It provides information and useful tools for DVD media. Both DVD-R/RW and DVD+R/RW types are supported. It follows in the tradition of DVDInfo, my first dvd application that was very successful. This new version is a result of listening to users criticisms, requests and suggestions, and applying this to the new version.

This program provides information & tools for:
 - Blu-ray and HD-DVD
 - DVD-R/RW
 - DVD+R/RW burners
 - DVD-R DL (Double Layer) burners
 - DVD+R DL (Double Layer) burners
 - DVD-ROM players.

 DVDInfoPro also provides information on all CD players & burners.
