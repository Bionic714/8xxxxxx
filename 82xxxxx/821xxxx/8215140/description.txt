Written by and starring AustraliaΓÇÖs favourite young comedian, Josh Thomas, the uniquely honest comedy/drama series PLEASE LIKE ME kicked off on February 28, 2013 on ABC2 Channel.

With his 21st birthday just around the corner, life finally seems to be coming together for Josh (Josh Thomas). He's sharing a house with his best (and only) friend, Tom (Tom Ward), his dog, John, and Tom's rabbit, $haniqua, and he's doing adult things like cooking roast chickens and eating asparagus.

But the events of one day throw his world into chaos. He's dumped by his girlfriend, Claire (Caitlin Stasey), and introduced to a decidedly odd but very attractive man, Geoffrey (Wade Briggs).

Based on the award-winning comedy of Josh Thomas, the six-part series PLEASE LIKE ME is about cavoodles, custard tarts, boyfriends and girlfriends. Mostly, though, it's about growing up quickly and realising that your parents are not heroes, but big dopes with no idea what's going on ΓÇô just like you.
