Written by and starring Australia's favourite young comedian, Josh Thomas, the uniquely honest comedy/drama series PLEASE LIKE ME kicked off on February 28, 2013 on ABC2 Channel.

Based on the award-winning comedy of Josh Thomas, the six-part series PLEASE LIKE ME is about cavoodles, custard tarts, boyfriends and girlfriends. Mostly, though, it's about growing up quickly and realising that your parents are not heroes, but big dopes with no idea what's going on - just like you.
