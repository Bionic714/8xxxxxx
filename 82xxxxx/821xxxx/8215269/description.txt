CrossOver.v12.1.2.MAC.OSX-P2P


CrossOver allows you to install many popular Windows applications on your Mac. Your applications integrate seamlessly in OS X; just click and run. No rebooting, no switching to a virtual machine, and no Windows Operating System license required.

Version 12.1.2:
Application Support:

Fixed a bug which caused Steam to get stuck in a loop while trying to update.
Fixed a bug which caused performance to suffer badly in Skyrim, and possibly some other games, on certain Linux systems.
Fixed a bug which caused Outlook 2010 to fail to open .xlsx, .pptx, and .docx attachments.
Fixed a bug which caused Quicken to fail to connect to Chase Bank online.
Office 2007 and 2010 will now display help topics!

Mac OS X:

We have improvements to windowing in the Mac Driver.
We are hopeful that changes in this version of CrossOver will mean that gaming performance will improve when Apple releases its upcoming OS X 10.8.3.
