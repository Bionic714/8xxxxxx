,rareones,2013-03-04T01:22Z,"I hoped to achieve what your screenhot is shwing ,but there are only x30 days licenses for kav 2013 ;(. Am i missing something? should I apply license from certain older kav version? please explain, thanks for the ul. "
[T],YahSoft,2013-03-04T02:29Z,"@rareones

If one does not work, try another key, some (not sure which) of the 365 days of license.

OBS: 1 TURN OFF INTERNET
2 INPUT >>>THIS"

,frideska,2013-03-04T05:30Z,"Thank U so Much, YahSoft..
i get 316 days for KIS-12C54B22

keep Rock man.. :)"
,rareones,2013-03-04T11:32Z,"Well, thanks for the reply ;). I did notice many of the KIS licenses work properly but not the same with antivirus, most are trials, din t find any working 300+ days for the 2013 version ( like in the image above ) ;P."
,Ka5per5ky,2013-03-06T06:06Z,"Thanks Bro! Little Help for other Bros here:
Activate THE TRIAL VERSION with that exact Serial provided by the Author (AAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAA4).
The process was failing to me ´cos I was inputing the serial in the first line. GL."
,Ka5per5ky,2013-03-06T06:10Z,BTW I promise I´ll buy this shit as soon as I really can ´cos I think Kaspersky is being GR8 this year and it´s not heavy on System either. Don´t trust silly propaganda! ( I got infected by a WORM using BitDefender in just 1 month of use! ).
,rareones,2013-03-06T11:54Z,"Well, the aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaa4 method isn t working for 2013 version, I need to use 22222-22222-22222-2222u in order to work ;). And yeah trial is easy to activate, I mean 365 license like in the screenshot above, anyone managed that ( for KAV not KIS )? Yeah I agree with ka5pe5ky, very solid protection, nothing like other av I have tried and easy on system resources, hope I can buy it sometime, can't afford it atm."
,TOmhOGanPItt,2013-03-08T12:52Z,Worked like a Charm. I got 312 days
