,cha0zix,2013-03-29T23:29Z,Best quality I've seen for a Flapjack episode. Great Torrent
,ButtonsTheMonkey,2013-04-07T18:00Z,Haven't downloaded yet but thank you!!! I'd love to pay for this show but dumb region restrictions prevent me from actually doing so... Canadian iTunes doesn't have it. Very grateful for you doing this... show that left us much too soon.

Until your release some of the only copies floating around were so low quality that they were barely even watchable. These look even better than when I saw them on tv. Since these are such clean, high quality copies they even look good scaled up to 1080 on a big tv.

Now if only someone would release similar copies of The Grim Adventures Of Billy And Mandy and My Gym Partner's a Monkey, then I'd be all set."
