For a company that develops and publishes tons of games a year, it isn't surprising that they have had so many duds lately. I still give Ubisoft credit because they still stay dedicated to the PC market."

you're right dude the game itself is good but the optimization of the game and the patch out in spite of everything that has destroyed more than anything else it's a shame (40/50fps patch 1.4 patch 1.6 20fps: (
But i like much of ubisoft game but not this one That All ;)"
