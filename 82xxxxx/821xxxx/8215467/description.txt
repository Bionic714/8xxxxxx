Zenescope, February 27, 2013

Intended for mature audiences

As the flower girls from Wonderland continue to claim their victims, Calie struggles with finding a way to snap Violet out of her downward spiral. But when Violet meets a new friend who seems to be the answer to all Calie's prayers, they will both learn first-hand that even the best of friends can carry their own deep, dark secrets. Meanwhile, in Wonderland, the hunt for the Red Queen and the suicide king continues as they arrive at the Temple of Purity, where even the madness of Wonderland may not enter. From the same minds behind the smash-hit Wonderland trilogy and the Grimm Fairy Tales series, the ongoing comic book series you've been wanting is here!
