'Infamous, I have become disowned, but I am one of your own' - Myra Hindley, from her unpublished autobiography

On 15 November 2002, Myra Hindley, Britain's most notorious murderess, died in prison, one of the rare women whose crimes were deemed so indefensible that 'life' really did mean 'life'.

But who was the woman behind the headlines? How could a seemingly normal girl grow up to commit such terrible acts? Her defenders claim she fell under Ian Brady's spell, but is this the truth? Was her insistence that she had changed, that she felt deep remorse and had reverted to the Catholicism of her childhood genuine or a calculating bid to win parole?

One of Your Own explores these questions and many others, drawing on a wide range of resources, including Hindley's own unseen writings, hundreds of recently released prison files, fresh interviews and extensive new research. Compellingly well written, this is the first in-depth study of Hindley and the challenging, definitive biography of Britain's 'most-hated woman'.
