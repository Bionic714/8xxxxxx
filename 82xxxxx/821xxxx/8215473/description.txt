Over twenty years, Andy Hailwood took part in major operations to arrest international terrorists, ruthless drugs gangs, kidnappers and armed robbers and was on the frontline at some of the most violent crime busts of recent years. He has been part of the Police VA3 Firearms Department, then of the Tactical Aid Group (known as the T.A.G.) before transferring to the VO8 Firearms Department. Gun Law tells the action-packed inside story of hard target, armed policing on the streets of Britain and the men who daily risk their lives in pursuit of criminals.
