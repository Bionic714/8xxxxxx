In heaven, you can upload a constant stream of new torrents of every shape and size.  They never die and thousands of people download them and leave comments about how awesome you are for uploading them.  You have unlimited bandwidth and so do all of your leechers.  It's a glorious unending cornucopia of ones and zeros flying around in a beautiful orgasmic frenzy of light and energy.  There's no downtime, no limits, and no restrictions.  And also, they have free donuts.
