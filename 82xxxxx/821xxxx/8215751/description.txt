"What better way to present a classic Nickelodeon Game than with a classic Nickelodeon Figurehead, yes Mellisa Joan Hart herself helps to instruct you through the many features of this all inclusive Viacom Interactive's Nickelodeon Director's Lab!

"Director's Lab is laid out into rooms with several doors, each leading into the different aspects of film-making and all contributing to making your imagination come alive. The rooms needed to make your masterpiece are:

The Sound Lab

The Music Lab

The Video Suite

The Graphic Studio

The Title Editor

The Directors Lab

The Screening Room

"While the program is of course primitive to that of the main sound, music, graphic and video editing softwares available, for a young audience Nickelodeon Directors Lab really is easy to grasp and fun to use, you can happily get lost for hours just playing around with all the added content of the game; clips, sounds, music files and images taken from a wide range of sources including some of your favourite classic Nickelodeon Cartoons."
