,Rechrophit,2013-03-13T16:19Z,"@ ZeRoLiMi — Immense gratitude! I don't know how to thank you enough. I tried everything to get multiple different Pages downloads working, but I just couldn't solve the problem without a format probably. I even BOUGHT Pages from the App Store and that didn't work. I come here... download this, and it's just magical. Thank you... thank you... thank you, most graciously! If there's any chance you are willing to do the same with Numbers & Keynote, I am exceptionally appreciative."

Thanks again!"
