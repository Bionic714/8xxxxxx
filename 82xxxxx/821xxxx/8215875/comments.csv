Bless you LORD like The Holy Bible mentions.  Then, bless my mom for working so hard to take perfect care of me.  She bought me this game so I do not have to steal.  I ask you, God, that I never forget the lessons both my parents have taught me.  I am too old now.  It is my turn to take perfect care of them so they retire and live out the rest of their long lives happy.  Amen."
