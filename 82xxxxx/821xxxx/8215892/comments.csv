Having two remotes sucks, though!!!! just think its bull-shit that they make smart TVs that only respond to 2/3 media formats. and my panasonic couldnt play DDS or whatever it is(dolby). which is like the most popular fn format for audio nowadays. Its like ""come on"".... Thanks for the up though!"

Also, I personally loved the movie and found it to be a great fun time. For me, this torrent was a really good choice to make. Thanks, uploader!!"
