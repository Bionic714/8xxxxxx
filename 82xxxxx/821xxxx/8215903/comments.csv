[V],RubrumPopulus,2013-03-03T19:59Z,"Excuse me, but this was just released minutes ago asshat.  Nobody on this site has posted this since it wasn't released.  You find me a link to a post of this comic scanned by theProletariat-Novus, and I'll stfu.  But until then stop being a bitch-ass troll."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-04T04:28Z,"the site isn't clogged up by novus scans. many times they are higher quality than previously posted versions, and often different resolutions. skip it and move on, don't complain."
