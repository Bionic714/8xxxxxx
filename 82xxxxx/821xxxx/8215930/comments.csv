,evolved72,2013-03-15T00:55Z,"Don't worry about the trial reset, people make a bigger deal out of it than it is. When there's about 7 days left Norton itself will warn you with a nice big popup in the middle of your screen, at that point you take 2 min and run the NTR. Boom, you're good for another couple of months. One, you don't need to worry about it running out without you noticing, and two it uses up about 2 min of your time every couple of months. Anyone who gets a program for free at the cost of 2 min of time every 2 months and STILL bitches and moans deserves to be outright ignored.

@maxuser That said, I know you didn't do that, no bitching, no moaning, and you even said thanks, so no this isn't directed at you at all, but your post made me think of these things. If you find a way to do what you said more power to you and I think something like that would be very cool and I'd use it myself."

No, you cannot script this.  A script would require another application to turn off tamper protection.  This is one of the things that you DO NOT want, because it would allow another ""unsolicited app"" to turn it off and then destroy your computer.
Sorry, but this has to be done by the user, so the trial reset will always have to be done manually...."
,frizoky,2013-04-04T15:25Z,i got a BSOD after two days of trial reset
,fliter16,2013-04-07T22:03Z,"This is a welcomed release since the previous gold standard, ESET, stopped updating its firewall over a year ago, and now when you try to use ESET they deliberately force you to use the firewall module from 2011, which these days results in automatic infections with banking trojans within a matter of several hours.

That said, I have had no problems with this so far.  I will report back in 60 days and let everyone know if the reset works the way it's supposed to."
