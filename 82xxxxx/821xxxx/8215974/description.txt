 Description:

 The neo-synth pop group Bastille were formed in London, England in 2010. Originally the solo project of singer/songwriter Dan Smith, Bastille expanded to a quartet after he decided to form a band and got some of his friends involved. The band attracted a lot of attention after putting a few tracks online, leading to support slots at major U.K. festivals like Glastonbury and the Isle of Wight.
