Purely out of curiosity, is there a specific reason Novus releases 2048 HD scans as opposed to 1920?  Not that I mind, obviously. Just curious."

RE: 2048px  I'm not 100% sure, but I believe it has something to do with the Ipad's retina display having a 2048 native resolution.  And since it's just as easy to do them at the higher res without too much larger file sizes, why not? lol"
