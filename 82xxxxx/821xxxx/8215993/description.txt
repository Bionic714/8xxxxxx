I could not find this in HD, and it's another of my favorite movies, so this is my first attempt at upconverting a DVD. I think it turned out pretty good!

SEED PLEASE! I have limited bandwidth, so I try not to upload new movies until there's at least 5 full seeds. I have LOTS more classic movies to up, so if you like my work please help out and seed, which saves me from having to seed old uploads.

Please comment, feedback is nice to keep me motivated and to let me know if my work is any good. Thanks
