,agenthack,2013-03-05T22:22Z,im dl'ng this one ;-) but it went back t slow dl speed..less than 10kb...
,wevy,2013-03-05T22:32Z,im seeding two but ill stop it to seed just this one for u
,wevy,2013-03-05T22:33Z,avg 403kbs now not the 40kbs it was before
,wevy,2013-03-05T23:04Z,it may be slow because there is 8 in swarm and im uploading at 170kbs so divide that by 8 that comes out to 15-20 kbs i cant upload any faster i already uploaded 20gb n the files is 9.3gb
,agenthack,2013-03-06T02:22Z,dl speed is now 40-60kb... better than 0-20kb before... 
,wevy,2013-03-06T02:56Z,Alrighty I'm seeding now
,wevy,2013-03-07T23:42Z,you finish the torrent i havent uploaded in 2 days cause my family has been using the internet
,agenthack,2013-03-08T04:48Z,not yet wevy..sorry if im taking too long to finish..
,agenthack,2013-03-08T04:55Z,i found a solution to this...the only problem of the iso's before is the VTS_01_0.vob file... if you could upload that file then i dont have to dl the whole iso..since i already got the whole iso..its just that 1 file is wrong.. you can extract that iso with winzip or 7zip and just put each VTS_01_0.vob intothere respective folder..then upload it.that file is around 5-7mb only..so for that 3 vob files its only 20mb.. is that cool? thanks
,wevy,2013-03-08T06:51Z,ill do it tomorrow in the morning
,agenthack,2013-03-08T07:00Z,"nice... thanks wevy... ur the man!

will wait for it > iso's 2-4 VTS_01_0.vob

once i finish...i'll try dl'ng your insanity deluxe upgarde iso only..i already have the 10dvd insanity.. ;-)"
