As a guitar player what is the thing you would like to watch on an instructional DVD? Certainly not the kind of instructional videos that Yngwie Oh-I-play-so-fast-you-cannot-keep up Malmsteen has released during the years. Paul Gilbert is one of the best guitar players of our generation for sure and has proven his abilities by contributing top notch melodies and solos in bands like MR. BIG and RACER-X. 

Silence Followed By A Deafening Roar guitar instructional DVD is a lot more than the step by step and track by track explanation of Paul Gilbert's intense guitar techniques that he used on his latest album release with the same name. This DVD also includes special sections on arpeggios, picking phrasing and legato techniques that Gilbert is fluent at.

The way that Gilbert is explaining his techniques is so cool and amazing, and its very easy for every guitar player with a little knowledge of the 6-string to keep up and try his best. The Silence Followed By A Deafening Roar DVD also includes a detailed Shred Annex of Paul's favorite and fastest new licks that once again he demonstrates with excellent precision, makes you wonder Is this so easy? The DVD comes with downloadable tablature explanation for you so that everyone can follow Gilbert's instructions easier.

Enjoy!
Seed.
