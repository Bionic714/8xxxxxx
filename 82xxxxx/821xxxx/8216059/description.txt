Sacred Sexuality & The Art Of Divine Relationship - Divine Coupling-Intimations, Explorations & Cosmic Connection. Part Three of a three part series - Recorded Live in Virgina Beach, VA 10-2006

Join Team Indigo alongside lovely Virginia Beach as they experience their first Crystal Communion while receiving important frequency transmissions that will assist them in supporting Earth and EarthΓÇÖs Elementals & life forms to join the Urtha Host and progress through StarFire.

In the previous two Sacred Sexuality workshops, the Team activated their personal Um-Shaddh-EieΓÇÖs in order to generate the Rheuzetta, Rhosetta and Rosetta currents that correspond to the Inner, Middle and Outer Domains. All three RΓÇÖsetta codes play a ΓÇÿkeyΓÇÖ role in restoring the natural Kristic orientation of our Outer (World) Yon-A-Sa Seed Atom at the AzurA and will progressively clear the distortions within our ReushaTA spiral, allowing us to generate Kristic (rather than metatronic Sextant) Keys when engaging in sacred sexuality or sexual coupling. In order to be able to more fully appreciate and utilize these fabulous Symbol Codes, Team Indigo has now been gifted with the Kama SU-tara Transmissions. The well known Karma Sutra information also comes from the CDT plates but today, contains little of the original Ka-Ma SU-tara Transmissions, which cover information on how to generate, transmit and co-create powerful Kristic frequencies with partners and others in a Kristic and responsible way for the purpose of enhancing connectivity to God Source and for the immediate purpose of strengthening the Indigo Shield. Many English words have derivations from these transmission including Ka-Ma (karma), Ma-Ta-Or (matter), Wa-Ta-Or (water), Ga-Sa (gas/air), Va-pa-Urs (vapors), ΓÇ£OrΓÇÖ DenΓÇÖationΓÇ¥ (ordination), ΓÇ£OrΓÇÖAtionΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£AdOr-AtionΓÇ¥ (adoration).
