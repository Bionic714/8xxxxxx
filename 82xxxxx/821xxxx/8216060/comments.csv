,swine666,2013-03-05T16:58Z,Im not good at writting reviews so im just going to say it sucks. I saw most of the movie and i coulnt figure out what it was about. At first i thought it was a zombie movie what with the virus that wipes out 90percent of humanity. The movie is in english with italian actors who speak fluent english a proffessor is involved who isnt much convincing in his role.

You may not be good at writing reviews but you are good at being a fucking idiot."
