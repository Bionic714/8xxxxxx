Discover the beginning processes involved in the expedited TaKEYon Activation Cycle, which is beginning 9 years earlier than planned, to override the activation of the Threshold Spiral, which has been ΓÇÿarrangedΓÇÖ by a Fallen group called the ThE-tans. Early TaKEYon Cycle activation and the timing there-of, will be crucial in order to ΓÇÿinterceptΓÇÖ the ΓÇÿThreshold SpiralΓÇÖ which is capable of taking all the structures and associated Life-Forms in this entire Ecka-Veca Universe, that were previously headed for either the Ascension Path or Cal-Fall, into Sho-na Black Hole Fall.

The expedited TaKEYon Cycle, that the Indigo Team are now assisting in, will be critical in preventing this intended ThE-tan take-over and providing an alternative Cal (Guff) Fall path for hosting Fallen Races AND of course in maintaining an ascending path for Kristic Races into the Middle Domains and Inner Hub Worlds for a successful StarFire Cycle.
