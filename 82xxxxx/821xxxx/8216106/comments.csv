,Fluffeh,2013-03-05T07:45Z,"@Beowulf6666 - These files aren't a merge of the individual tracks, I got them from another source. I listened to three of the mixes (Markus, Jorn and Orjan) at work today and they are spot on. The closest thing I could find to a problem was one section about halfway through the Orjan set where I think the original file skipped an ad and the music did change, short of that, none of the problems you experience. Perhaps try downloading again, or let me know exactly what part of a file you are having trouble with so I can double check the originals in that exact spot?"
,waitesb,2013-03-08T05:37Z,Does this contain the commentary and interviews by Armin during the other DJ's sets? Cuz I gotta say that is annoying as hell on the one I have where Markus Shulz is right in middle of a mix and AVB starts interviewing someone so we can't hear the music!
,Fluffeh,2013-03-08T11:38Z,"@waitesb - Yes, this has come off the live stream, so there is some chatter. The Markus set has talk during the following:

14:45-16:50 Int with Orjan Nilsen
33:30-34:00 Crowd Wishes
46:45-48:45 Crowd Wishes
62:00-62:20 Chatter
75:15-77:30 Ruben de Ronde
81:30-82:20 Chatter

Sadly I can't find the direct, recorded from  turntables feed :("
