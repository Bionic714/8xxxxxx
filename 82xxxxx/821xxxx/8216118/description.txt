A compilation of the most weird and wonderful experiences from the readers of Fortean Times magazine over the last 35 years. Each story is a first-person account of a strange experience. Some are scary, some are weird, but they are all stories of things that have actually happened to people, from living in haunted houses to witnessing rains of frogs.
