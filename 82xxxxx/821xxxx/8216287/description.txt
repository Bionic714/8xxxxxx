I'm slowly but steadily uploading all the songs in the amazing Majesticcasual
Youtube channel. All of the tracks have been dl'ed in their full FLV (yes, with fmt=18) form, after
which I ripped the tracks at 256kbps, which sounded transparent enough to me.
I'm too lazy to make a list, but these are like the first 300-odd songs
on the channel.
Maybe I'll make a list after a while. More has yet to come, although the rate at which it will
depends on the success this one gets.
Also, i've got really bad upload speeds here, so, if you like the torrent,
please SEED!
