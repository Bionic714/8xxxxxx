I grew tired for waiting for one of the "private" tracker users to upload their own rip so what i did was

A) Scour the net for a foreign upload of the 3D 1080 rip of The hobbit
B) Remove the foreign track and replace with a DTS 5.1 track + English subtitles 
C) Upload and seed 

SO yes, this is a 3D 1080p Half SBS rip of The Hobbit: An unexpected journey

I spent a few hours on this so if anybody would be grateful to forward any invites just to show some appreciation... sgt_pepper@live.co.uk
