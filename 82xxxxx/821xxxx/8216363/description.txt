Maya is a CIA operative whose first experience is in the
interrogation of prisoners following the Al Qaeda attacks
against the U.S. on the 11th September 2001. She is a
reluctant participant in extreme duress applied to the
detainees, but believes that the truth may only be obtained
through such tactics. For several years, she is
single-minded in her pursuit of leads to uncover the
whereabouts of Al Qaeda's leader, Osama Bin Laden. Finally,
in 2011, it appears that her work will pay off, and a U.S.
Navy SEAL team is sent to kill or capture Bin Laden. But
only Maya is confident Bin Laden is where she says he is.
