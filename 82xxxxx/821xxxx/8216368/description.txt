A new drama set in the East End of London in 1889 during the
aftermath of Jack The Ripper murders. The infamous H Division
- the police precinct charged with keeping order in the
district of Whitechapel- is in a chaotic state trying to keep
order after a tumultuous time for London and reported
infamously worldwide.
Haunted by the failure to catch London's most evil killer,
Jack the Ripper, Inspector Edmund Reid (Matthew Macfadyen)
now heads up the notorious H Division – the toughest police
district in the East End. Charged with keeping order in the
blood-stained streets of Whitechapel, Reid and his men find
themselves fi ghting to uphold justice and the rule of law;
but always in the background lurks the fear of the Ripper –
is he back for another reign of terror.
The shadow of the Ripper is still felt in the neighbourhood
by the vigilantes, the sensation-seeking newspaper hacks and
the men who hunted – and failed to find – the notorious
murderer. It seems that even though the notorious killer has
disappeared, there are plenty more willing to stain the
streets of Whitechapel with their victimsâ™ blood...
