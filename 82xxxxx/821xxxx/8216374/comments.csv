I waited to watch this movie in HQ for a long time now. Therefore I am very grateful. Thanks again, mate!"
,ccooluke,2013-03-09T07:48Z,"I don't know what tetnem is talking about.. this movie is not in HQ or HD.. or high anything.. the screenshots are pretty much true to what you get, it's grainy and there is a green line /glow on the left/right sides of the movie the whole time. 

Do yourself a favor and keep waiting. or Find a real copy of this in HD... if it's out there yet, just don't watch this one. "

,zardes123,2013-03-10T10:03Z,"Waited long for this movie, but still it's low quality... i think i can wait more for a hd one .... stll hanks uploader!!"
,tetnem,2013-03-10T21:00Z,I thought it was HQ because of the file size. My mistake I guess. :P
