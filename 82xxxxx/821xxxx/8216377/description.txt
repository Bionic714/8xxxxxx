This music is easily the best Electro I have ever heard. His style is upbeat, smooth, and addictive as hell. The catchy tunes will have you bobbing your head with the beat on the first listen and it won't be long before you're singing along several play-throughs later. 

Unfortunately there aren't many words that can describe how awesome these tracks are. Give your ears a treat and listen! :D
