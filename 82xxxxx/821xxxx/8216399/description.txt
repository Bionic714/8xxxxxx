This is the second of four rulebooks used in the Live Action Roleplaying Game Valiant: Secrets of the Mesa, run from 2008 to 2010 in New Hampshire in the USA. The rules rely on the published Accelerant System Larp Rules by Robert Ciccolini and Chimera Entertainment. The current version of this system is in use in many Larps and can be license via Chimera LLC.
