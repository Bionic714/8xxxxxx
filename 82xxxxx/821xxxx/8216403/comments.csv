[T],rjordan21,2013-03-04T23:21Z,"^^^^ yes, I agree...."
,buzz420x,2013-03-20T03:43Z,"Sounds great...everyone comments on each vinyl that it's ""not the best"" but they don't provide a link.  thanksr upload rjordan"
[T],rjordan21,2013-03-23T08:55Z,^^ you're very welcome...
,crabgrass08,2013-03-29T20:12Z,"I'm sorry politux, but when considering vinyl of DSotM, there is no consensus on what may be the ""best"" version, which is, I suspect, why rjordan used the word ""favorite"" in writing the description. Consideration of such things as versions of Pink Floyd recordings (and vinyl in general) is nearly completely subjective.  Since this torrent is of SHVL 804 and that can objectively be considered the original issue of this recordings, one can objectively say that this is definitive in that it is the original and everything beyond that are versions of the original, versions whose value in relation to the original is subjective.  at any rate, how about we just thank rjordan for providing this version of the original recording and be done with it?

thanks rj."
