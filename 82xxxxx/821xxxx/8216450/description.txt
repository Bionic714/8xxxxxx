Fast download manager supports multiple browsers

Internet Download Manager is a practical download manager, with lots of interesting options and integrates well with your system.
The best reason to settle a download manager is undoubtedly the ability to resume a download at the point where it left off and, as expected, Internet Download Manager allows.
Create multiple connections to the same file, accelerating downloads if connection is the limiting factor.
Ready to integrate with most browsers, supporting among others: Mozilla, Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, MyIE (now Maxthon), Avant Browser, AOL and Opera.
