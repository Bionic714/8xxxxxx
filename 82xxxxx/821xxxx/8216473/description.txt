Hi,

On request of those who like to have a music gallery of honour. I have one and James Taylor has its own place of honour. However, just like John Mayer, their recordings do not have the (sound) quality one would like.

So its hard to make a playable list that sounds good all the way. I looked for the best (sounding) tracks that do justice to the remarkable artist James really is. The fact he is like my friend next door and consequently he is easily overlooked, only adds to his greatness. You may be the judgeΓÇª Enjoy,
