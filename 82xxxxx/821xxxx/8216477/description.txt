Delve into the world of Amazon Web Services (AWS) with trainer Jeremy Cioara. If youre trying to establish a cloud presence, AWS offers a cost-effective, scalable infrastructure. Jeremy covers what AWS is, how it works, and how you (and your organization) can get started using it.

This series is full of cool technology, but the biggest way-cool factor is the complete shift in the way we think about and handle Information Technology! With AWS, you no longer have to build your own world-wide IT enterprise solution to deliver amazing cloud-based services.

Jeremy walks you through how to sign up for an AWS account, create and use instances, Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), Simple Storage Service (S3), and more. Youll also see a real-life case study on a company called CBT Nuggets that migrated its services to AWS.

Find out how easy it is to use AWS, and how to make the powerful features of AWS work for you.
