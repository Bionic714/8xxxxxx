A sexual drama of uncommon depth, 'Mascara' is one of the best sex films of director Henri Pachard's career. Shot in 1983, the film stars Lisa DeLeeuw in one of her best roles ever, playing a lonely young woman who spends her days in the secretarial pool and her nights looking for lust in all the wrong places. After a particularly disappointing one night stand, Lisa decides to see how the other half lives. She finds a mentor in high-priced call girl Lee Carroll, and starts spending her night engaged in some pay-for-play passion of her own. Lisa indulges her every erotic appetite, whether it's taking on two guys at once or experiencing lesbian lust in the arms of a sultry siren. Things quickly get a bit heady for Lisa and she starts to wonder whether a life devoted purely to sensual pleasure is such a great thing after all.
