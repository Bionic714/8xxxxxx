These are all the copies of the Golden age Green Hornet I actually found intact with the GH stories!  there are alot of them out there, but missing the GH and what's the point in that?

Also, some of these may not be the best scans.  I did not do them.  They came from Comicbooksplus so blame them if the quality is not up to snuff

One last thing, be sure to seed!  I have limited bandwidth, and can only keep a torrent going for a bit, as I will need the room for other uploads.  keep it going so others may enjoy it!

My Next golden Age upload will be The Black Cat!
