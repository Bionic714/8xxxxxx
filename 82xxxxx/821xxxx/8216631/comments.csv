,padme99,2013-03-15T00:33Z,"And don't forget the warlords that are supported by the Americans. They are greedy thieves and murderers. They grab land and any thing they like from whomever they want, then build huge projects and sell them at atrocious prices and there is nothing anyone can do about it. Just a couple of years before Karzi's brother Mahmood Karzai and General Dostam cheated people out of 900 million dollars in the Kabul Bank scam(depriving millions of afghans out of their life savings) Even though any taxi driver will tell you this story these wanted criminals travel in and out of the US and around the world freely. 

If America could just give the ordinary afghan some justice, believe me the ISAF forces would have been a lot more popular. But for reasons not understood by anyone the American forces insist on supporting these parasites and earning the hate of the millions who have been cheated and robbed. 

Why! 

People of Afghanistan had hoped to really prosper with the arrival of US forces but now they pray for the taliban-even though times were tough and the economy was down then, at least they had security, at least their children were safe. 
At the time of the Taliban the above mentioned police surely would have been executed in public  but after the initial wave of executing criminals by the Taliban one would rarely hear of incidents like that. Without US protection these vermins(the warlord and their corrupt sycophants) would have been taken care of within months.  

An Afghan friend of mine visited Afghanistan in 2007. She told me about how the police just stopped her uncle's car at a check-post and then just drove away with his. That easy to get robbed in Afghanistan, he walked home.

The Uncle complained to the then governor of Kandahar (Karzais brother) who told him he could not help him, especially if his tribe was involved as he needed their support, ie he needed their votes. (Wow! wonderful ain't it. Vote for me and you get to rob and steal without being harassed) It's a government for the thieves by the thieves. 

The friends Uncle was advised to drop the issue, as he could just have been shot dead and they would have claimed he was a terrorist. Naturally the friend in question and her family promptly moved back to the states. They left behind a lot of prime property in Kandahar and recently returned friends tell them that most of those property has been sold and structures erected on them even though the friends family holds the actual deeds.

US spent billions of our tax dollars in Afghanistan and millions for fighting alqaida and the Taliban and all it has to do is stop giving support to these criminals that it claims to be the legitimate govt of Afghanistan.
