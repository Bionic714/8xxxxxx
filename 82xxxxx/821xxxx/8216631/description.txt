This important BBC documentary deserves to be seen outside of Britain. Please grab, learn, YouTube it, circulate the word about the depravation of our Afghani 'allies'.

Original description from BBC:

The BBC has had investigator Ben Anderson in Afghanistan looking into allegations of extreme abuse of citizens there including child rape and murder by the local police we, the USA are working with.

While some operations in the country are moving along in a more or less satisfactory way, in Sangin located in the infamous Helmand Province, things are a lot less rosy. Many experts believe unless the hot bed of Helmand Province, in particular the Sangin District is cleaned up and under control with the support of the local population, the country will slip back under the control of the Taliban entirely in short order following the USA's exit in 2014.

Given whats been happening there and the growing hatred of the corrupt new US backed government and abuse of the citizenry a positive transition is pretty much impossible.
