Poole's musical career began in 1992 when he played guitar in the band Mizery which later became Psycho Opera which featured guitarist Abby Normal, drummer Jeff Washam, bassist Michael Patrick and lead vocalist Todd Cage. Poole left the band to form Maniac Spider Trash as lead vocalist alongside Abby Normal (again on guitar) and Michael Patrick (also filling his earlier role as bassist), they were joined by Sicko Zero on drums. Poole fronted the band from 1992 through 1996. The band released one EP entitled Dumpster Mummies on Dead Hell Records in 1994. This was followed by an album titled Murder Happy Fairytales in 1995 which remains unreleased. The band then disbanded. Dumpster Mummies EP will be re-issued October 5, 2010.
Murder Happy Fairytales was the second recording done by Maniac Spider Trash recorded in 1995 on the Dead Hell Records label. Shortly after recording of the album was completed, Maniac Spider Trash disbanded and Wednesday 13 and Sicko Zero formed "The Frankenstein Drag Queens From Planet 13".
