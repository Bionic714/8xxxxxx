 ΓûêΓûêΓöé  We've all been there. You have a killer 8 or 16 bars but building an  ΓöéΓûêΓûê
 Γûê Γöé  entire track from them isn't as easy as it first appears...           Γöé Γûê
 ΓûêΓûêΓöé                                                                        ΓöéΓûêΓûê
  ΓûêΓöé  For Fundamental 6 we examine the theory and practice behind           ΓöéΓûê
 ΓûêΓûêΓöé  arranging dance music. Beginning with an examination of the theory    ΓöéΓûêΓûê
 Γûê Γöé  behind phrasing and response, we move on to discuss sonata form,      Γöé Γûê
 ΓûêΓûêΓöé  energy, development, recapitulation, motion, contour and              ΓöéΓûêΓûê
  ΓûêΓöé  anticipation.                                                         ΓöéΓûê
 ΓûêΓûêΓöé                                                                        ΓöéΓûêΓûê
 Γûê Γöé  Using an example track constructed from 16 bars, we use the           Γöé Γûê
 ΓûêΓûêΓöé  previously discussed theory and over numerous sessions walk through   ΓöéΓûêΓûê
  ΓûêΓöé  how to create a complete club arrangement using these techniques      ΓöéΓûê
 ΓûêΓûêΓöé  whilst also discussing techniques such as syncopation, meter,         ΓöéΓûêΓûê
 Γûê Γöé  poly-meter, hyperbeats, hypermeter and hemiola to create interesting  Γöé Γûê
 ΓûêΓûêΓöé  patterns and loops from limited instruments.                          ΓöéΓûêΓûê
  ΓûêΓöé                                                                        ΓöéΓûê
 ΓûêΓûêΓöé  Finally, we examine builds and drops, discussing the theory and       ΓöéΓûêΓûê
 Γûê Γöé  practice of synthesis programming for the creation of risers, sweeps  Γöé Γûê
 ΓûêΓûêΓöé  and falls before finally taking a look at how to create an            ΓöéΓûêΓûê
  ΓûêΓöé  arrangement for the radio.
