I thought I already had this, although I no longer have the means to play any of my old vinyl. Then I remembered it was my brother who had the album and I had a much-listened-to copy on C90 cassette.
Cheers for the blast."

I am perfectly capable of splitting each track in audacity -- but I was hoping to avoid doing that.

The other torrent on here for Moontan sounds incredible, but the uploader didn't bother checking his files before adding the torrent, because there's some serious skipping on ""Radar Love"" (track b1 iirc)"
