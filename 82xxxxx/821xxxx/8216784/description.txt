AutoKMS is an activator that runs every boot from the Microsoft ToolKit
2.4.1 from CODYQX4. It runs silently in the background for a couple seconds
every time you boot to activate Windows and Office.

It is on A/V program sh**lists because it's such a successful, fast,
activator. Do not move the program out of the Windows_AutoKMS directory
or your Defender will quarantine it. Although it is a false positive in
A/V programs, you will need to exclude it in any extra A/V programs that
you add to your system.

You may update windows at your own risk. I would recommend screening to
make sure people don't complain about breaking kms activation before
installing them. I personally recommend turning off smartscreen filter
and disabling automatic updates. You can still update, but do it
manually with by running wuapp (winkey+r then wuapp)

I did not download any display drivers or other optional software.
The only program that I added to Windows, besides the activator, is Office.

All Windows and Office updates available were integrated into the
release at the time of creation. No other programs besides Office 2013
were integrated.
