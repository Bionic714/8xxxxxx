Premiere Recital Recording of the RUFFATTI Pipe Organ installed in Davies

Symphony Hall, San Francisco, CA, USA  (1984)



This is one of several TELARC CDs featuring Michael Murray playing 

pipe organs in different countries.



At a reasonable volume this should shake a few windows in your house.  If not,

take off your headphones and do it right.
