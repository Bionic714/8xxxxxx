High-Efficiency Car Fuel Plans for Survival [pack]

This system can be built easily by anyone with conventional tools and materials and at little cost. This torrent contains everything required to build your own system in a reasonable amount of time and with a moderate degree of proficiency. This may sound like a hoax to many but it's not.

The Multi-Fuels Processor (GEET) is an internationally patented technology (Patent US005794601A1) whose inventor is Paul Pantone. This revolutionary system allows the common 4 stroke-car-engines to run on a water-hydrocarbons mixture. This system is capable of using all types of fuels (gasoline, diesel, kerosene, crude oils and others derived from hydrocarbons) with its endothermic plasma-reactor. The Multi-Fuels Processor also results in a significant reduction in pollution by almost 85 percent compared to a conventional engine. Tests carried out by many commercial experts and private researchers have shown that it is possible to make function an engine equipped by this device with a mixture of 20 percent gas and 80 percent water without any loss in output power. This means a reduction in gasoline consumption by up to 80 percent. Both gasoline and decomposed water (hydrogen and oxygen) are used as a fuel by this system.

Patent: "A fuel system for improved fuel efficiency may include a fuel injector to transmit fuel in droplet form to a reaction region. A reaction rod may be positioned in the reaction region, where the reaction rod may have a convex end and a concave end. The fuel system may be used with engines such as gasoline engines, turbine engines, diesel engines, and steam engines."
