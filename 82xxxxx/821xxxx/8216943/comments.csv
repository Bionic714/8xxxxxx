,binderguy1,2013-03-04T05:17Z,"Damn, man!  You must've ul every single EPIC Comics (related or imprints) by now!  Except for the current torrents in TPB.

Thanks bunches!

You must be up to the 90's now.  How about the second coming of Epic Comics (circa 2000's)?"
,Ichthypod_Crane,2013-03-04T06:35Z,"Hey binderguy1! Surprisingly, there is still a good deal of original epic stuff to upload, either because it isn't here or the torrent is so old it has pennies on its eyes. So that's gonna tie me up for a few more days. Re: 2003-2004 epic, I don't have any of those (Trouble, Gun Theory, Crimson Dynamo and one issue of Epic Anthology, I think), because none of them really interest me - sorry. However, you should be able to track them down by d/ling the torrents for the CMCs (Complete Marvel Chronology Project). I don't see them at THIS PirateBay, but they are all over thepiratebay.mk  

Hope that helps!"
