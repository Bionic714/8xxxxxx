A brief respite from the epic Comics uploads to bring you the entirety of another Marvel imprint, Razorline.

Wikipedia educates:

Razorline was an imprint of American comic book company Marvel Comics that ran from 1993-1995. It was created by filmmaker and horror/fantasy novelist Clive Barker, with its characters existing in one of the many alternate universes outside the mainstream continuity known as the Marvel Universe.

The Razorline imprint consisted of four interrelated titles, based on Barker's detailed premises, titles and lead characters. These were:

    Ectokid ΓÇö written first by James Robinson, then by future Matrix co-creator Lana Wachowski (then known as Larry Wachowski), and penciled by Steve Skroce

    Hokum & Hex ΓÇö written by Frank Lovece, penciled by Anthony Williams

    Hyperkind ΓÇö written by Fred Burke, penciled by Paris Cullins and inked by Bob Petrecca

    Saint Sinner ΓÇö written by Elaine Lee, penciled and inked by Max Douglas

The four titles were preceded by a one-shot sampler: Razorline: First Cut.

They all here, peeps! Praise to the creative teams, the scanners and to Mr. Barker. Seed? indeed!
