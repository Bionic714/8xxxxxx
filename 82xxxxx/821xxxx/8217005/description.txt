Emmylou HarrisΓÇÖ shimmering, yearning soprano is one of the great voices in music. Long before it is a country song, or a sad song, anything she sings is an Emmylou Harris song.
Yet at the same time, curiously, the Alabama native is a singer whose best moments come in partnership. And on Old Yellow Moon, in that hokiest of country traditions ΓÇô the boy/girl duet ΓÇô an old alliance triumphs with charm.
As HarrisΓÇÖ second-most famous singing partner, Rodney Crowell has sometimes suffered by unfair comparison with the man who came before him: Gram Parsons.
Parsons reframed country music through the lens of the 60s counter-culture ΓÇô and his legacy is most effectively realised on a wonderful tribute album, Return of the Grievous Angel, which may be HarrisΓÇÖ (as co-producer) own finest achievement.
But Crowell is a different thing, a songwriting craftsman with a naturally emotive tenor that beautifully complements that famous soprano.
Nearly 40 years after he joined forces with Emmylou in her 1970s Hot Band ΓÇô and supported by impeccable contributions from other distinguished veterans of that era, like James Burton, Bill Payne and Hank DeVito ΓÇô Crowell drives the partnership through a handful of songs that are as sassy and spry as the best of their early years.
And if thereΓÇÖs no getting away from the roots pairing that has outstripped the rest in the 21st century, it should be said that the stomping Harris/Crowell take on Kris KristoffersonΓÇÖs Chase the Feeling bears comparison with anything from Robert Plant and Alison Krauss.
Still, much of Old Yellow Moon is unashamedly sentimental. Its eighth track, CrowellΓÇÖs Bluebird Wine, was the song that introduced the pairΓÇÖs first collaboration in 1975 ΓÇô and producer Brian Ahern was there on the day, too.
Perhaps someone less familiar at the helm might have muttered a stern word when these old friends began to get maudlin on weepies like Matraca BergΓÇÖs Back When We Were Beautiful. But you know what nostalgic reunions are like.
