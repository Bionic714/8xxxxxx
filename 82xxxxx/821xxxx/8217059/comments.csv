,thundercat123,2013-03-04T12:19Z,what happened to episode 3? anyone have it please?
,mikexw,2013-03-04T18:53Z,"Is this another After Dark episode?  Or should this be Episode 3 with first HOH competition and nominations?  Looking for (what should be) Episode 3

PLEASE LABEL PROPERLY!"
[T],duranie,2013-03-05T00:35Z,"mikexw - 
If you took 3 seconds to read the comment four above yours (posted 12 HOURS before yours), you'd see that verovenlo clearly said this is an After Dark episode.

Mistakes happen.  For some reason, this site does not allow uploaders to edit/correct their torrents, which you'd know if you'd make an effort to upload something instead of making complaints.  If something is uploaded with an error on Pirate Bay, it stays that way.

Instead of yelling PLEASE LABEL PROPERLY to someone who is doing people a HUGE favour.. why don't you take a moment and reflect on the face you've done NOTHING to help the pirate bay community.

Same goes for everyone who's posted a complaint in this torrent. Especially if you've never actually uploaded anything to the site.

I cap a lot of Canadian TV.. but I decided not to go near BB because I know the type of idiots who comment on these shows when the smallest thing goes wrong.

I wouldn't blame verovenlo if he/she stops capping it altogether.  verovenlo, you've got the patience of a saint to deal with this crap. "
,missmalissa,2013-03-05T00:56Z,"duranie -- you're so right! I hate when the only comments are people bitching, not saying thank you! 

verovenlo -- THANK YOU!!!! Very much appreciated!!! "
[V],verovenlo,2013-03-05T03:47Z,thank u duranie for sticking up with me i just mis labebeld the file thats all and yes people always find the comment buttion when someting is wrong with a torrent but a thank u no way so fuck em all
,montej,2013-03-05T05:30Z,I usually thank you  (and others) most people are ungrateful. But not all of us :)
,montej,2013-03-05T05:32Z,"oh and I almost forgot, I can DL your releases faster than ANYONE elses. So thanks double for that."
,thundercat123,2013-03-06T07:06Z,this is why leaving/reading comments is essential.
,AllzCool123,2013-03-07T18:05Z,This is AFTER-DARK EPISODE
,CanadianBakin,2013-03-07T21:46Z,You guys know that if all else fails you can watch the episodes on the Slice website. I don't think it's region blocked.
