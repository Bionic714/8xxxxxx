For those of you new to this group, they often sing songs about sex, dirty sex. The lyrics, however, do not use words that are offensive, so Tipper Gore would be happy about this. Consequently, these songs are not all good for the younger under 18 crowd to hear, but may already know about! This group is a mix of funk, party music, rock and roll with a taste of the full horn section like in that of Chicago. There are three main singers. This group always dresses as mummies, but is not a Halloween band. They wear these costumes on a regular basis so that they cannot be identified for various legal precautionary reasons; they were originally all session/studio musicians located in Tennessee who have struck out on their own. The sound of this CD is somewhat reminicent of a carnival atmosphere in the title song and the reprise. To date, I feel it is their best work, but their first CD will always be my favorite. If you have followed them from their beginning, you can hear the progression that they have reached in Carnal Carnival. They have become more experienced in writing and you can hear how far they have come in their musical arranging. As a bunch of talented studio/session musicians, you can appreciate how far they have come to reach this point in their career. And, their harmonizing is also a hit everytime. These boys got it right! Enjoy
