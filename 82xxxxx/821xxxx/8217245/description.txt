What can be said about a band that has survived for 17 years? They are talented, versatile, energetic, and most of all, fun. Their sound is best described as an energetic combination of folk, pop, Celtic, punk and rock. Unique? You bet!

Captain Tractor's live show "never fails to bring the house down". With versatile writers and every member a fine musician, each show is a roller coaster ride of fun and mayhem, and you never know what's going to happen from night to night. Playing over a 1,000 shows (Canada, USA, Europe and New Zealand) since their formation has made this band of misfits a tight, sought-after Canadian sensation.

The band has won many awards throughout their history including ARIA awards for single of the year and recording artist of the year.
