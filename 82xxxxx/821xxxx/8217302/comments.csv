Today s the first day I have ever commented on thepiratebay and I just set up the account because of you evil witches...I see all your post about surveys and password...I wish I could blow out one of your eye... BIG Goat"
,ivoest,2013-03-04T19:11Z,"No survey Or Password, maybe you click on the popup ads I guess"
,Damien74,2013-03-04T20:09Z,"Im not sure if victorvaz is a troll or if he clicked som ad link somwhere. But no matter, it's a mp4-file and you can not password protect them, there's nothing to unpack so his picture is from something else."
,doormos,2013-03-04T21:12Z,"There's no survey or any of that for me either, just a mp4 and txt. You probably clicked on an ad victorvaz. Try redownloading."

,XTRNT,2013-03-04T22:51Z,@victorvaz if you look at the files it is a straight .mp4 file with 1 text file...no password cause no winrar. 
,NewmannZA,2013-03-04T22:55Z,"Guys - just make a habit of clicking the preview link (where it shows you how many files is included in the torrent) - if you see a ZIP/RAR, then skip the torrent and look for something else. If nobody downloads or seed crappy torrents like that, they die out anyways..."
