Physics of the Future: How Science Will Shape Human Destiny and Our Daily Lives by the Year 2100
by Michio Kaku


FIXED VERSION!



In Physics of the Future, Michio KakuΓÇöthe New York 
Times bestselling author of Physics of the ImpossibleΓÇögives us 
a stunning, provocative, and exhilarating vision of the coming 
century based on interviews with over three hundred of the 
worldΓÇÖs top scientists who are already inventing the future in 
their labs. The result is the most authoritative and scientifically 
accurate description of the revolutionary developments taking 
place in medicine, computers, artificial intelligence, 
nanotechnology, energy production, and astronautics.
In all likelihood, by 2100 we will control computers via tiny brain 
sensors and, like magicians, move objects around with the power 
of our minds. Artificial intelligence will be dispersed throughout 
the environment, and Internet-enabled contact lenses will allow 
us to access the world's information base or conjure up any 
image we desire in the blink of an eye.
Meanwhile, cars will drive themselves using GPS, and if room-
temperature superconductors are discovered, vehicles will 
effortlessly fly on a cushion of air, coasting on powerful magnetic 
fields and ushering in the age of magnetism.
Using molecular medicine, scientists will be able to grow almost 
every organ of the body and cure genetic diseases. Millions of 
tiny DNA sensors and nanoparticles patrolling our blood cells will 
silently scan our bodies for the first sign of illness, while rapid 
advances in genetic research will enable us to slow down or 
maybe even reverse the aging process, allowing human life 
spans to increase dramatically.
In space, radically new shipsΓÇöneedle-sized vessels using laser 
propulsionΓÇöcould replace the expensive chemical rockets of 
today and perhaps visit nearby stars. Advances in 
nanotechnology may lead to the fabled space elevator, which 
would propel humans hundreds of miles above the earthΓÇÖs 
atmosphere at the push of a button.
But these astonishing revelations are only the tip of the iceberg. 
Kaku also discusses emotional robots, antimatter rockets, X-ray 
vision, and the ability to create new life-forms, and he considers 
the development of the world economy. He addresses the key 
questions: Who are the winner and losers of the future? Who will 
have jobs, and which nations will prosper?
All the while, Kaku illuminates the rigorous scientific principles, 
examining the rate at which certain technologies are likely to 
mature, how far they can advance, and what their ultimate 
limitations and hazards are. Synthesizing a vast amount of 
information to construct an exciting look at the years leading up 
to 2100, Physics of the Future is a thrilling, wondrous ride through 
the next 100 years of breathtaking scientific revolution.
