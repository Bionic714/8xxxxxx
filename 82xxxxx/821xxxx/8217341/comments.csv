your title is OFF!!!
BUT i will still download in HOPES that it works."
,Cerebral222,2013-03-04T07:01Z,"Oi, stupid!!, read the title properly [PS2-PC]. Q)- can you play this on PS2? A)- yes. Q)-can you play this on PC?, A)-yes. Read shit before you comment, or go back to school to learn what reading is pole smoker."
,PseudoPositive,2013-03-04T08:41Z,"I have this game, & I also have Outlaw Tennis & Outlaw Volleyball, this works well, the only glitch is the intro videos are a bit wavey, you can simply go to the GS plugin & change the interlacing to any other setting & they come good, but when you go to another video, you have to do it again if you want to see the video stable, this is not the case in the game itself though & this game is heaps better on PC, the graphics are just like PC graphics, (very sharp). I find the benefit with PS2 game on PC (apart from graphics) is running the game in full screen mode whilst playing movies with VLC player in the corner of the screen, with golf games that works perfectly, with racing games, just sort of a destraction. 
NOTE: 
Outlaw Golf 2 on PC works well.
Outlaw Tennis PC works well.
Outlaw Volleyball Won't emulate well, if at all.
Thanks again Cerebral for Operation Surma.  :)"

1st time I tried this ps2 emu, I'm going to give it a try.  Love those 'outlaw' classics!!
PseudoPositive commented on others 'tennis' that would work this way.  Would you by any chance have this to upload?
Or could you tell me what to look for?  Just a ps2 dvd or?
Thanks again, I have xbox copies of some but not ps2!"
,Cerebral222,2013-03-07T07:07Z,"@meddraw, yes I have Outlaw tennis as well, other games that emulate well are:
Darkwatch
Batman Begins
Star Wars: Bounty Hunter
Downhill Domination
Aeon Flux (a little laggy from time 2 time)
Spy Fiction
Sky Odessey
Jurassic The Hunted 
The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
Naval Ops-Warship Gunner
etc.

The best thing about emulation is 
1) the advantage of greater graphics (If you have a good rig).
2) flexabilty, ie: If I remember right, with playing Spawn, or Star Wars-Bounter Hunter, the X axis for the right analog stick can't be changed, but you can swap these around with the LilyPad plugin (Very simple)
3) No need to worry about burning, or scratching discs, just select & off you go, that's why games that emulate well should go into the PC section, because of the emulation tool, it effectively becomes a playable PC game.
now after all that ranting; yes, I'll upload Outlaw Tennis soon."
