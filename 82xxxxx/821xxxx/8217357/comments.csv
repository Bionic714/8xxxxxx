,JohnnySasaki,2013-03-19T00:57Z,"Works perfectly. Windows 7's security thingy said that the publisher was unknown, but so far the game's running great with no problems. You guys might want to block internet access for the game just in case."
,AzL79,2013-03-22T22:15Z,Trojan.... :/
,AzL79,2013-03-22T22:20Z,Works perfectly if y want a trojan...
,moeburn1,2013-03-24T17:21Z,"it's not a trojan you farktards.  It's detected as a generic heuristic ""trojan"" because of the way the crack accesses memory.  Don't believe me?  Run it in sandboxie and be amazed at how it does nothing but play the game."
,themadmedic,2013-03-31T19:05Z,"When I try to run it, I get ""The game filesystem failed to initialize, aborted now""
Can you help? :/"
