This game is Awesome, especially given it's size.

I may have posted this before, but this is the one you want!

The Best way to explain this is as follows...

  You wake up in a Hospital, and realise you have Psychic Abilities, including, but in no way limited to "Telekinesis".

The best way to use this file is to Mount the Image (.iso) file with a
tool like "Deamon Tools" or similar, or better yet, simply burn it to a CD-ROM Disk, and run it from there.

Enjoy,
  zzDJChris.
