On the Sunday, March 3 broadcast of the Alex Jones Show, we'll air some of our recent, most powerful interviews, including Alex's talk with former Congressman Ron Paul on drones, gun rights and more. We'll also re-air our exciting discussion with radio talk show host and author Michael Savage, analyzing China's economic enslavement of America, the federal attack on the Second Amendment and the ongoing effort to destroy the Constitution. Also, rocker Ted Nugent joined us this week to examine the federal moves to strip Americans of their right to keep and bear arms.

Note, today's broadcast consists of previously aired material.
