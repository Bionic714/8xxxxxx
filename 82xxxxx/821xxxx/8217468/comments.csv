,Falcon0483,2013-03-04T06:32Z,Can you put out a 480p version? This file is bloated and unnecessary.
,seed9754,2013-03-04T07:09Z,"Thank you very much for the HDTV version of this. Unlike some posters (Falcon) I'm not going to ask you for something then tell you that you put out bloat

Falcon - it's not bloated, some of us like this format and resolution. If you don't, that is fine but don't be such a judgemental fucking dick when asking someone else to do something for you.

Why don't you learn how to re-encode this in a resolution you like, or better yet, do an encode and publish yourself at whatever resolution you want."
,seed9754,2013-03-04T07:11Z,"Also Falcon, before you bitch about someone elses releases, how about contribute to the network and post something, some kind of content

i.e. stop being a whining leech"
