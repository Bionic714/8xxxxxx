I can't believe this.
I bought this game brand new from my local EB Games for only $2.
I to this day still don't know why it was so cheap, but am happy it was, else I
wouldn't have picked it up.

It's a very good Flight Simulator, and I hope you like it too.

To use the file, just mount it, or better still, burn it to a CD-ROM Disk
and then install it.

Then just enjoy it :-)
