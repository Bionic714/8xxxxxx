,moremetalthanyou,2013-03-04T08:35Z,Thanks for the AVI. I fucking hate MP4s.... they don't stream through XBOX
[V],MP4SUX,2013-03-04T09:23Z,"Good news is that AVI is still four times as popular as MP4. Just keep track of the number of DVD/BRrips encoded AVI & MP4. I get a 4-1 preference for AVI.
.
But ""The Scene"" has to shove MP4 down our throats (not even the professionals use MP4).
.
And with the number of MP4-related errors, this cannot go on forever.

,Analias,2013-03-05T12:30Z,"moremetalthanyou I used to hate them with a passion too, as my xbmc'd xbox wouldn't play them. To fix the problem I just downloaded the latest build I could find, and viola, mp4's play fine. Most of them that is."

So, extra work just to get back to square one ... almost, but not all of them.

Really curious about the streaming thing. perusing the EZTV forums, I caught a bit of people finally catching on to the fact that ""Gross Pixelation Errors"" that LOL heaps upon us daily tends to cause streaming devices to crash at the point of pixelation. I just thought it showed ""damaged is as damaged does"". But apparently, my esthetic complaints take a back seat to actual inferior operation.
.
Much like a gang tat - ""Scene"" RGs have their own little foibles. Only LOL pixelates, up until this last ""Talking Dead"" only ASAP mismatches audio and video frame rates (that was EVOLVE of all people) and, of course LMAO is famous for the ten second wild glitch that destroys sync in a number of nuked (and should have been nuked) ""Daily Shows"". Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't XOR the only RG that used to put out damaged AVIs? The fact that the particular type of file damage is isolated to a single RG indicates that if they got their act together, they could solve these embarassing ""MP4 related"" nuke-able offenses and leave me with nothing to rant and rave on about. I could be lurking once again.
.
For instance, LOL does plenty of shows that NEVER pixelate - so how about giving SVU and about a dozen other shows to those who can do it right? LMAO really should give ""The Daily Show"" to someone who can stay up late and not ... trip over ... whatever gives the exact same glitch to someone who never has those kind of errors? Mix and match and problems solved. They're never going to be able to push the ""Quality"" line while their reputatins go down in tatters due to actual physical damage. Pixelation loses the ""bit rate / better compression"" war every time. A wrecked Ferrari won't get you where a moped will.
.
Well, except for that ""because it's too dam CPU intensive"" reason why AVI is still four times as popular as MP4. Don't be fooled by a forced mandate giving the illusion that MP4 is the better format. Rippers get to choose and they choose XVID / AVI more than 80% of the time.
.
All ""The Scene"" has to do is lift it's ill conceived mandate and we'll have FQM presenting us with fine XVID / AVIs once again. I got time, I got my own corner forum and I aint going nowhere - and neither is the regular truckloads of damaged MP4s that show why a monopoly is as bad for ""The Scene"" as it was for the Soviets.
