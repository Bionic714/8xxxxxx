[V],redfoxygames,2013-03-06T19:28Z,"it's a interesting fact. but 85% of comments on my games sounds like this ""great upload"" i understand that you are free to expose your point of view but you don't have any rights to make some kind of fake afirmations. A lot of people apreciate my work and if you are not satisfied I reccomend to you to buy the games "
