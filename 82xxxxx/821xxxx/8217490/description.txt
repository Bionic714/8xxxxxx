Even the swordsmen charged with protecting Kyoto needs
some time to unwind themselves. The second Yuugi roku
spin off takes place in the early summer, where romance
and the sounds of festivals fill the air. Someone is
aiming for the statues in a nearby shrine, and suspicious
people have been lurking around. The men are off to
patrol the area to prevent theft, and Chihiro is to
follow one of them around. Play the mini games and see
how the men spend their time during (relatively) peaceful
times, get closer to them and decide who to go to the
festivals with.
