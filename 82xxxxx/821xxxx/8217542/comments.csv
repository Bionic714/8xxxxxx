,chancet,2013-03-05T08:36Z,"I experienced a 1080p movie for the first time on The History Channel, watching this.  I found it totally worth getting to a good television for.  :)

If anyone has seen a 1080p copy of this film, let me know!  I'd love to see it again like that!"
[T],MrUnpopular,2013-03-05T18:03Z,I'd recommend you purchase it on iTunes or blu ray.
