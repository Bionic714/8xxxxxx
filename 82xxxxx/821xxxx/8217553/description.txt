HISTORY OF THE DECLINE AND FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE
by Edward Gibbon

Part One: Volumes 1-3 (of 6)

The 6-CD Naxos Audiobook set, reduced to MP3 (256 kbs)

Read by Philip Madoc (and Neville Jason who functions as "narrator")

This Naxos set is very much abridged, but it flows well and should encourage people to pick up the books and start reading!
