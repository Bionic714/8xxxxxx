O&O DiskImage Professional

To protect themselves against unintended loss of their data, most companies create images of the system and data drives of all their network computers, and store them on high-performance servers. Many employees, however, like those in the support or sales departments, do a lot of work using their notebooks. If they accidentally overwrite important customer data or sales figures, or when a system error suddenly occurs, putting things right again will not come cheaply. Creating images of data and systems, on a regular basis, will prevent annoying circumstances like this from taking place and can help you avoid longer downtimes or time-consuming restorations!
