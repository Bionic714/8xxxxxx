While studying in Aligarh University, Anwar (Rajendra Kumar) falls hopelessly in love with a veiled woman and is unable to get her out of his mind. Anwar meets up with the wealthy Nawab Buland Akhtar Changezi (Ashok Kumar) so that he can use his influence to secure a job. Nawab asks Anwar to teach his sister, Husna (Sadhana) poetry, to which he agrees, and eventually finds that she is the very same veiled woman he feel in love with. What follows is a series of misunderstandings that lead to mistaken identities and misdirected romances. Soon, Husna too falls in love with Anwar and Nawab approves of this alliance and makes arrangements for their wedding. But when Nawab finds out that Anwar's sister is a lowly courtesan by the name Najma (Nimmi), he calls off the wedding. Nawab, under the pressure of debt, arranges Husna's marriage to the wicked and wealthy Munne Raja (Pran), who is all set to auction Nawab's mansion. With the odds stacked against them, will Anwar and Husna triumph in their love?
