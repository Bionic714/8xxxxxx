,jonaslorik,2013-03-05T04:45Z,Let's see if this is good... :)
,Death2Dipshits,2013-03-05T05:41Z,Why would I want english subs for an english show??
,pfa2000,2013-03-05T07:03Z,"@Death2Dipshits. There's plenty of folks out there who understand English pretty well, but struggle with regional accents. They read better than us English speakers so English subs help them out. You don't need them, but someone else might. Imagine a Polish guy watching 'Snatch', or anyone else for that matter. 'English' is a pretty broad description for a language. "
,jyufer06,2013-03-05T07:28Z,"@pfa2000. I agree with you 100% not only for dialects, especially when watching some british shows, but also for some parts that are spoken too low to hear or too fast to understand. So thanks @waldorfx! and of course EZ for a great UL"
,Sikkwolf,2013-03-05T09:29Z,I think all english subtitles should be framed in ebonics. 
,bananabre,2013-03-05T11:47Z,"Deaf people also can't hear the English, so they need to read it, or watch the tv show with a translator sitting beside the screen doing the sign language."
,ViolentC,2013-03-05T12:55Z,"Audio 9/10
Video 9/10
Show 999999/10
Can't wait for next week."
,STONEDSTONER,2013-03-05T14:16Z,retard americans are the only people that have trouble with other english accents
,lovecat66,2013-03-05T20:38Z,"Do you have History Channel - The Bible S01E01 and S01E02 aired MAR04,2013 ? If yes, could you upload it ? THX !"
,trixi50,2013-03-05T20:39Z,"Also sometimes person (me actually) can't make out what the hell a person is saying, and it's so fab to have subtitles to just be able to see.  Anybody have any ratings?  What does REPACK mean?  It's kinda putting me off!"
,The.Terrible.Puddle,2013-03-05T22:21Z,"As incorrect as Hollywood.
Show: 0/10"
,Lirix1g,2013-03-05T22:44Z,"Kind of boring for a first episode.. and kind of disapppointed at how the vikings are transcribed.. but will watch the next one to get a better idea, I think it have potential but definitly need to get some actions because 45min of girl talk for a first episode is SHIT!"
,BertilGM,2013-03-06T01:19Z,this show got some potencial...
,jonaslorik,2013-03-06T04:13Z,"Both episode 1 & 2 are out atm, just search for it.

I think it's a great show from having watched them, episode 1 alone is kind of pale though, they should've put 1&2 into a longer pilot episode. anyway, cant wait for the rest. :)"

,trixi50,2013-03-07T18:20Z,"Well I still don't know what REPACK means really...but there is nothing wrong with this file

,Clonbalt,2013-03-08T20:29Z,filmed entirely in Ireland....
,ubiknik,2013-03-10T00:08Z,Real Vikings ride super heavy motorcycles that leak a lot of oil and swat cars that get near them with chains.  I don't know about all that language stuff but I guess I can see what this so called  'History Channel' thinks Vikings ahrt ta be.
,ubiknik,2013-03-10T00:13Z,IS CONAN (the barbarian) GOING TO BE GUEST STARRING SOON?? ..I heard he hung out with the vikings (before they got motorsicles).  !
,ubiknik,2013-03-10T00:19Z,O.K..Vikings basically are very cool. I saw them on Monty Python once!
,Dr.Ameer,2013-03-11T19:15Z,also translators use those english subs =)
,lizardomanson,2013-03-12T12:33Z,"You are the retard stone, retard and moron. There are deaf people that watch videos and need CC or subs plus for your information, not all english is 100% understable. For example the Brits."
,sad-sam,2013-03-14T04:23Z,"The.Terrible.Puddle you are so wrong.  This show is great.  It's based on a partly mythologized figure, so don't take it as pure historical fact.  The technology, clothing, customs and general portrayal of the people is almost dead on.  This is a great show about the beginning of what we call the Viking Age, during shich Ragnar Lodbrok was an important figure.  It's nice to see a ""historical drama"" that take the historical part a bit more seriously.  

Show 10/10 (so far)"
,fatahal,2013-03-19T01:25Z,"thanks for the upload eztv, and thanks waldorfx for the subtitles"
