,Biothanatos,2013-03-04T09:14Z,"thanks, been studying Voegelin for 25 years; sure, upload what you can - I've got most of what floating around free, but there are still lots of gaps."
[T],pharmakate,2013-03-04T19:49Z,"@Biothanatos -- If you've been reading him for 25 years I guess you may be starting to understand him. I can only aspire to that state. But I have 14 other books of Voegelin's I'll post soon, and maybe 8 or 10 books about him. I'd kill to find a nice scan of Anamnesis, though."
,Asymov,2013-03-07T06:09Z,"I am unequivocally interested in any other works of Voegelin you care to share.  (I am presently working on a concise literary work concerning governance [but with the focus being to proffer a philosophy of practicality], thus my interest.)

Admittedly, I have abstained from reading most works concerning the topic (including Voegelin's), to eliminate the possibility of plagiarism.  Nonetheless in addition to this collection of works I will conduct a comparison POST completion of my work.  (To date, I have not been disappointed with how my work both correlates and differs, the resulting distinction being satisfactory [and expected] after completion of several propositions in my work.)

I ditched TV years ago to pursue a work in philosophy.  You could say, 'Yes'--I am interested.

Thank You."
,Asymov,2013-03-07T06:20Z,"Q:  Is Anamnesis not included in the IV Volume:  The Ecunemic Age?  Or was Anamnesis merely extrapolated from or transliterated in the IV Volume?

I ask because you stated you possess a poor scan of the text (and I would like to know if I should be searching for a separate reproduction of Anamnesis to commit to my virtual library)."
,Asymov,2013-03-07T06:44Z,"The cover images for Volume 3 and 4 appear to be corrupted.  (Of course, it could be something exclusive to my connection.)

I will attempt to acquire again."
[T],pharmakate,2013-03-07T06:51Z,"@Asymov - Anamnesis is not part of Order and History Vol. IV. It's a separate work, though no doubt it's included in one of the Collected Works volumes. I have a version of Anamnesis in html and a pdf derived from the html; it's perfectly readable but is not attractive. I'll be uploading most of what I have tomorrow."
,Asymov,2013-03-07T06:56Z,"The cover images for Volume 3 and 4 are intact (it appears my connection was at fault).

Thank You."

,Asymov,2013-03-09T05:47Z,Thank you for your prompt response.  I'll be perusing your new upload.
,Mertonoia,2013-03-12T14:05Z,What a treasure!
