,mcskwayrd,2013-03-04T10:52Z,"I have been replacing all the good movies from my HDD collection with the versions you have been uploading recently. Your releases are fucking great! Quality AND taste! I had a few requests. Fido's (2006) blu-ray is out. Could you rip it? Also 1080p versions of Blood Simple (1984) and Raising Arizona (1987) and any other Coens' movies you want. And lastly The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover (1989)

Sorry for so many requests but take your time. There's no hurry. I had an accident in November and now confined to bed. Movies provide some solace. Haha at least my taste of movies has improved as a result :)"

,highresjunkie,2013-03-27T05:43Z,"Normally 1800-1900 is enough bitrate for a 1080p, but when you have a source that has a lot of grain in it like this (shot in 16mm) you have to increase your bitrate some because of the grain. Same goes for movies like Der Untergang and Clerks. Jalucian's encodes of these are better."
