Half a century ago, Brazilian composer and musician Antonio Carlos Jobim (1927-1994) introduced bossa nova to a worldwide audience with ''The Girl from Ipanema.'' This musical collage of countless seamlessly edited excerpts of concert footage covers decades of events all over world. And we see a huge parade of artists, including Frank Sinatra, Dizzy Gillespie, Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan, Judy Garland, Sammy Davis Jr., Oscar Peterson, Diana Krall, Henri Salvador, Chico Buarque, Gary Burton, Sylvia Telles, Lio, Nara Leao, Milton Nascimento and the maestro himself Jobim. There is no commentary; the music speaks for itself. Picture postcards, private photos, official documents, posters, album covers, and sheet music complement the concert footage.
