The show:

In each episode of Fast N' Loud, motor mastermind Richard Rawlings and mechanical prodigy Aaron Kaufmann search the far flung corners of Texas and surrounding states for forgotten and derelict classic cars to buy and restore at their Gas Monkey Garage in Dallas, Texas. While 'in Rome,' they'll sometimes get in with the local customs and characters - the all American, full throttle road trip with attitude. Ultimately, Richard and Aaron will work days and nights to finish their cars to make auction. But will their blood, sweat and beers translate into cold hard cash?
