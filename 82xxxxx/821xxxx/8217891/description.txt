This is not my torrent, I downloaded it from another site, I have 100% and will
be seeding along with other peers as the torrent is still reasonably active.

The only other version of this movie on tpb is 8.57 GiB, this compression has
pretty good (not excellent) video, and is complete.  The optional English srt
subtitle files do not look good/complete.
