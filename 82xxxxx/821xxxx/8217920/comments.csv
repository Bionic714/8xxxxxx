If not - first delete in Keychain «com.tapbots.Tweetbot.AccountTokens», then install and launch Tweetbot 1.0.1, autorize and upgrade to 1.2."

,7117,2013-03-07T00:59Z,"..and this file was 11.31 MB (pre-cracked)
why your file is 4.9MB  only?"
,payeco,2013-03-13T07:33Z,"@7117 Because this is the dog, which is compressed. Once you extract the app it's 11.5MB according to Finder."
,rspeed,2013-03-13T09:55Z,"This may sound a bit odd, but can you guys just not use this? Twitter are dicks and they set a hard limit on the number of users that can connect to the service using each program (call API tokens). So unlike most software, by not paying for this you're actually preventing TapBots from making money from the sale since they will eventually run out of tokens."
,7117,2013-03-13T22:55Z,"@payeco
