,kangminwoo17,2013-03-05T14:10Z,If you want proof that it works then go to youtube and watch My gameplay video by searching Scroll Krensky (my youtube username) and watch the gameplay of Dead space 3 (if you want please give some likes and subscribes it will be really appreciated).
,kangminwoo17,2013-03-05T14:11Z,adding on the the youtube comment thing from me my gameplay videos are MAC OSX 10.8.2 gameplay  and I am playing in OSX so don't think I am playing in windows while watching my gameplay.

If you're having trouble seeding, try a different torrent program and see if that works."
,BombaAriba,2013-03-07T17:18Z,Thanks for this upload. You can seed by having your torrent program running in the background and letting it upload.
