,gru_zloto,2013-04-07T02:24Z,"True, no audio for the last three minutes, and there is almost no credit time, so those three minutes are wasted..."
,ChasUGC,2013-04-17T19:35Z,"Yep. the audio goes out the last two minutes. I'm glad I'm not the only one. I just hope there wasn't a gun shot at the end. I have to download another version with the missing audio just to find out. Sorry, if my comment is a spoiler, but you don't know if you can't hear it. Yer Slippin' YIFY. But, still, you're the best."

Dude, that movie needs a rework, the audio stops at 2:37:12.

Comes as a big surprise actually, never had any problems with your other torrents, and I've already got a lot from you. So I guess it's one just of those glitches which happen to everyone from time to time."
