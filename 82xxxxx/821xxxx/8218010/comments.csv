it's considered a classic sci-fi movie,
it's brilliant."
,Noddy462,2013-03-24T12:06Z,This is 'hardsubed' which kinda sucks
,Brisket90,2013-04-17T03:41Z,thanks
,Brisket90,2013-04-17T04:50Z,"By 'hardsubbed', do you mean that you are unable to disable subtitles? I would have to disagree, I simply turned them off in the audio options in VLC. No problems there. "
,tall70,2013-04-22T04:56Z,"@PineappleStarz, it's one of those who says, because i don't like it, it's no good, lol, It does not meter. You can't rely on peoples emotional opinions about movie or music. There may gonna be 90% of comments saying how bad it is. You may still enjoy it."
,tall70,2013-04-22T05:54Z,"Well, i had many movies from this uploader, but this is first movie with audio crackling every chance it's got. 48khz stereo. Whats the deal? If anybody has proper explanation, please enlighten me. Once a while some movie does it and i have to redownload from somebody else. But last time was long, long time ago, i believe one of the Transformers movies."
