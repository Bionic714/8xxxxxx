,module409,2013-05-30T01:28Z,"Extremely slow download. Going into ""advanced"" and updating the tracker never helps, no matter how many times you do it. Lowering the number of upload slots and connections doesn't help, either. For those who want to say that will never help and only make it worse, you are wrong. It usually made it download faster, for me. This exact same happened, with Life Is Sweet 1990 4.37 GB By UNVEIL. That torrent took 3 hrs 7 min. to download. This LEGION torrent source is CtrlHD. It was altered from the superior H264/MKV to XviD/AVI, which WAY more table top players accept. Regardless, I deleted the Legion torrent and got the CtrlHD one. After updating the torrent several times, it's now downloading/fluctuating speed from 650kB/s to over 1.5 MB/s. I've never seen so much fluctuation. At least this doesn't need over 11 freaking hours to get. Can comment on quality, when I watch it on my 42"" flat screen. "
