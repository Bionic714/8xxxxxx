In my experience, when ever I install chrome through this method, always auto update fails.

It is better to install via bullshit official installer. :P"

i operate a linux kernel system.  chrome for the linux kernel traditionally has many problems with adobe flash video playback fluttering and skipping.

i am a native windows user, but using linux in this case on a lower quality machine.

windows runs on this system, but slowly. flash playback is flawless on a windows install on this system, however it drops frames.

in linux, frames do not get dropped, but the overall flash video playback is slow and sluggish.

in linux, there is ""chromium"" a faulty opensource release of chrome, which does not update the flash plugin; updating anything in linux can take more than its worth sometimes to the end user, so we run WINE in linux...

with wine, i can operate a windows version of chrome, which will have fully correctly working flash support.

you try watching redtube and having it drop frames left and right.  amen for those who share files like this.  you benefit more than just windoze users."
