LOVE AND OTHER HORRORS by KODY BOYE

DESCRIPTION: Love is a fire that fuels the world. From the kindness of a friend, to the affection of a lover, to the calamity of a great disease or the purpose of a letter passed from one person to another, a simple emotion can be told in so many ways and in such basic forms.

In LOVE AND OTHER HORRORS, enter the realm of love and the monstrosities it can offer. Step into a post-apocalyptic wasteland where robotic angels have been sent to search the Earth, where mannequins have come to life and fish can talk due to accident. Meet a vampire who bears a gift other than immortality, a girl who gains a power after nuclear fallout, a psychopath who bears the forbidden lusts on his computer and a blossoming madman who has a penchant for his own bones. And finally, witness the story of two boys who turn into men, of a creature who clings to life and of a man who, in the final moments of his wifeΓÇÖs life, recants his love and all he has to lose in her passing.

From the horrific, to the absurd, to the romantic and even the touching, LOVE AND OTHER HORRORS contains sixteen stories and over 50,000 words of fiction.
