THE DIARY OF DAKOTA HAMMEL by Kody Boye

DESCRIPTION: Dakota Hammell was an ordinary teenager until he ran away from home at the age of sixteen, but after being brutally beaten, raped and left for dead, there seems to be little hope in his lifeΓÇöthat is, until a man claiming to be a psychologist walks into the alleyway heΓÇÖs lying near-dead in and offers him a second chance at life. John tells Dakota he can stay with him as long as he wants, but thereΓÇÖs a catch: For each day he stays, he has to write a journal entry about his life, his problems, and his potential future. With little choice, Dakota agrees, but is wary of the situation, as past experience with strangers has shown to have negative effects. But when things with John begin to work out and life becomes nothing out of the ordinary, his heart finally begins to open and his journey can finally be told.

A story of hope, of healing, and ultimately, of friendship, The Diary of Dakota Hammell offers a brief glimpse into a life of fractured teenager who has lost everything but his ability to write.
