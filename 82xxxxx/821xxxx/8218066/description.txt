Plot:
Gothic And Lolita Psycho is a fun, comic book style action revenge film(sort of a low-rent Kill Bill without Tarantino's genius, of course; but if you feel like killing an hour and a half with a cute actress(Rina Akiyama-voted best butt in Japan a few years ago) this Japanese revenge blood and dismemberment fest is a thrill a minute.

After witnessing her mother's killing, Yuki(Akiyama) spends her time seeking revenge on the bad guys with well choreographed fight scenes and a cool black leather outfit. The only disappointment is no nudity, only much blood spouting from necks, arms & legs and every imaginable body part.
