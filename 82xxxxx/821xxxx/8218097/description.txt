It's a bike club. It's a brotherhood. It's "THE DEVILS RIDE" premiering Tuesday, May 8 after "DEADLIEST CATCH" at 10pm e/p on Discovery. For the first time Discovery goes inside the world of motorcycle clubs with the members of San Diego's Laffing Devils. "THE DEVILS RIDE" sports a diverse crew but one bonded by a commitment to each other and the club. Meet Laffing Devils president Gipsy, who must balance the club's growing ranks with pressure from older members to maintain the status quo. An ex-Marine who served in Iraq, Gipsy credits the club for helping him deal with the emotional scars of war. Then there's club VP, Billy the Kid, who waits in the wings wondering if he'll have the chance to lead the Laffing Devils. And younger member Snubz breaks all the biker stereotypes with his degree in finance and a full time corporate job. (Source: The Discovery Channel)
