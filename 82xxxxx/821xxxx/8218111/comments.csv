,jc4321234,2013-03-06T01:08Z,"You're full of shit, don't be a stupid arsehole.  It's episode 8"
,uneedabiscuit,2013-03-06T21:46Z,LOL.. Sorry youre right.. I was wrong.. That was a little unnecessary.. just another little internet punk that gets bigger behind a keyboard
,MSSHJM,2013-03-07T00:32Z,Thank you!!
,jc4321234,2013-03-07T04:14Z,"@uneedabiscuit You're unnecessary.  You leave a bullshit comment and then don't even bother to come back and correct yourself until I tell you that you're full of shit. I'm tired of morons like you that do that... You're welcome by the way

@msshjm cheers mate"

,uneedabiscuit,2013-03-08T10:12Z,"Sorry. I don't live on Thepiratebay waiting for you to respond to my comment.. Also, I did say I was wrong AND apologized.. Get a life!"
,uneedabiscuit,2013-03-08T10:17Z,sorry I don't live on thepiratebay waiting for your response. I said I was wrong and apologized..  (now you make another dumb comment) 
,deejdave,2013-03-08T23:01Z,not for nothing I would be a little pissed if the first comment on my torrent was a complete lie as well.
,OhioStateFan79,2013-03-09T03:14Z,I can't believe I am commenting on Snooki and Assface but according to IMDB episode 7 is Between a Rock and a Hard Place. Episode 8 is Taking the Plunge. this show is rated 2.8 lol 
,thecat18,2013-03-09T05:24Z,Thanks for sharing.
,jc4321234,2013-03-09T10:12Z,"So you came on here to take up for your friend ""uneedabiscuit?"" Here's a reality check you brain dead piece of shit: IMDB doesn't have the full listing for season 2, that's why there is no season 2 category for the show it just says ""unknown season"". Are you too stupid to notice that?  There is no episode number listed next to it either, so you're just making shit up. Here's some reliable sources for you next time you think you're smart.

,chrissy74,2013-03-13T15:59Z,"This is the RIGHT episode and title to it! Episode 9 is ""Taking the plunge"" where we saw last wk that Jenni and Roger are going to skydive ect,.Hope everyone understands:) and no im not being sarcastic!!"

,Kalika1,2013-03-15T18:25Z,"jc4321234 : I don't comment on torrents very often, but after reading all this attention grabbing bullshit from ppl who obviously can't do more than ONE google search to CONFIRM that THEY ARE CORRECT b4 trying to tear a new asshole in the ONLY uploader who has been kind enough to take time out of his surely busy schedule to upload free TV ep's for us, I had to say something. If there is a problem with an upload, KINDLY mention it to the upper so it can be corrected & then THANK them for their time & effort in the 1st place, which you clearly didn't put in yourself, or u wouldn't b dl'ing HIS torrent! Throwing a tantrum like a 2 yr old isn't gonna get you anywhere, which a few of you apparently haven't learned yet. Oh yah...& once again...CONFIRM U R CORRECT FIRST!! Because 1/2 u commenters look like complete invalids when you're trashing him for a NON-EXISTENT issue, this episode is indeed correctly labeled in case you haven't figured it out yet.
 jc4321234: THANK YOU for all your hard work in up'ing these ep's that no one else has taken the time to do, it's greatly appreciated! & don't let these idiots who don't know their ass from their elbow get 2 u, they're trolls trying to prove to others how mentally deficient they r, must b a contest going on or something ;)"
