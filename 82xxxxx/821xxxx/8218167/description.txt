In the first episode of a brand new landmark six-part series on BBC Two, composer Howard Goodall presents his own view of the very first steps humankind took towards making music.

The series charts from year dot to dot.com, with Howard suggesting that music has always been a crucial part of human existence. Archaeological evidence has shown that music, although there is no sure-fire way to know exactly what it sounded like, was just as important as a component of life in the Upper Paleolithic Age as it is today. In the Age of Discovery, Howard also charts the development of 'Gregorian' chant and advises that the style started with a handful of monks singing the same tune in unison, without rhythm and harmony. Over several centuries, medieval musicians painstakingly put together the basics of what is now known as harmony.
