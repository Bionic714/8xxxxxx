In 2012, Norfolk Southern celebrated its 30th anniversary and honoured some of the railroads in its history by repainting 20 locomotives in fallen flag liveries. 

The General Electric ES44AC featured in this Heritage Pack was the first AC locomotive class purchased by NS and are regularly used to haul long coal trains. The locomotive is part of GEs Evolution Series, which means it produces fewer emissions than its competitors but still maintains a mammoth 4,400 horsepower and 75mph top speed.

The fallen flag liveries featured in this Heritage Pack are:
- Conrail 
- Central of Georgia Railway 
- Interstate Railroad 
- Lehigh Valley Railroad 
- Monongahela Railway 
- Nickel Plate Road 
- Norfolk and Western Railway 
- Norfolk Southern Railway 
- Pennsylvania Railroad 
- Southern Railway 

Also included are Hopper Ballast Wagons, Van Autoparts Boxcars and Hopper Low Sided Gondolas, along with four Quick Drive consists for each locomotive and a selection of double header consists. 

Each locomotive in this Pack is Quick Drive compatible, giving you the freedom to drive the ES44AC on any Quick Drive enabled route for Train Simulator. Please note, there are no scenarios included with this Pack.
