In the second episode of a brand-new landmark six-part series on BBC Two, composer Howard Goodall presents his own view of the period in music between 1650 and 1750, in which many of the musical innovations we now take for granted were invented.

In an age when Newton put in place the basic laws of science, Howard argues that musicians did the same thing in music. He says it is no wonder in an age that also saw great advances in clock-making, that much of the music of this period sounds like the whirring, clicking and ticking of an intricate, magical machine. In addition, Howard suggests that the paying public had arrived on the scene, and music was therefore to change, profoundly.

This was the age of Corelli, Vivaldi, Bach, and Handel. Vivaldi developed a form of concerto where a charismatic solo violin was pitted against the rest of the orchestra. BachΓÇÖs music was composed to glorify God and to do so, not least in his monumental St John and St Matthew Passions, he wrote some of the most subtly complex, heartfelt music of all time. Handel, most famously in Messiah, brought all the techniques of the preceding hundred years to a brilliant pitch, in a work that was both crowd-pleasing and sacred.

The Sound of Music is accompanied by complementary programming on BBC Radio 3: The Sound of Music in Fifty Works and Story of Music Question Time.
