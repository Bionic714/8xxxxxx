In the third programme of Howard GoodallΓÇÖs Story Of Music, composer and presenter Howard Goodall presents his own view of the age of Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Mendelssohn, Schumann, and Chopin.

This was an era, from 1750 to 1850, in which composers went from being paid, liveried servants of princes and archbishops to working as freelancers who were required to appeal to a new, middle-class audience.

This period saw tremendous social upheaval, which included the American, French, and Industrial revolutions. And yet, until 1800 or so, composers for the most part wrote music that seemed oblivious to the tumultuous social changes unfolding all around it.
