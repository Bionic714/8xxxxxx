In the fifth episode of Howard GoodallΓÇÖs Story of Music, composer (and presenter) Howard Goodall presents his view of modernism in music and how the birth of recorded sound changed the way music was heard, played, and sold, forever.

Howard argues that the death of Richard Wagner in 1883 led to a series of developments that in many ways were in opposition to his monumental ambitions. In France, the music of Gabriel Faure, Erik Satie and others emerged and the symphonies of Gustav Mahler invited all forms of music, including folk music.

Howard suggests that Folk music was beginning to make an impact on musical form and texture. When MussorgskyΓÇÖs music came to the Paris World Fair in 1889 it astonished non-Russian composers, especially Claude Debussy. When Diaghilev and Stravinsky collaborated on a series of ballets, the results of using Russian folk forms with revolutionary rhythms, astonished, terrified and scandalised the audience in equal measure. Howard notes that with monumental works such as the ground-breaking Rite Of Spring and the extraordinary dissonant and erotic operas of Richard Strauss, an era of Modern music had begun.
