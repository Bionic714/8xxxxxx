,xcrutiate,2013-03-06T11:22Z,"So how do you make these things work? I have a legit rw, do I need a cracked one or something?"
,sunnyzafar,2013-03-07T06:22Z,"Not working. Error ""Cant load Class 66 EWS"""
,paul_kj,2013-03-08T06:43Z,"Hey guys, this file was not working for me too at first, so what needs to be done is you need to update your game from version 25.1 to v27.5a
 which is available on rutracker via torrent, its a 1.5 gb file, and once thats installed you can install this rwp file through the utilities app, mind you it will be in Russian, and it will work then, wish the upload had doled out this simple advice upfront, I figured this out the hard way, and I thank the uploader for uploading these wonderful addons which we all enjoy, there's no way I can afford any of this dlc, so thanks uploader!!"
,xcrutiate,2013-03-08T10:38Z,"Thanks Paul, but what if you have a paid version of RW? Will it not work then?"
,paul_kj,2013-03-09T05:04Z,"@xcrutiate , I honestly have no Idea as I have not spent a single buck on this game, all is pirated lol.. , but you can check out the rutracker site for their version of railworks and I used google translate which comes up with pretty bad tranlation, but still I could figure out something, they have a good and descriptive forum, hope that helps."
,xcrutiate,2013-03-10T05:08Z,Thx Paul. Will check it out!

I am great fan off your add on of railworks 3. You are doing great job as it is not possible to afford the DLCs. 
I have version 25.1 b of Train Simulator 2013. If you could tell how to upgrade to version 27 or higher I would be grateful. PS I have a skidrow copy of TS 2013.
Waiting for your reply at the earliest.
Thanks."
,sunnyzafar,2013-03-17T05:57Z,"@paul_kj, thanks for your fix. Can you please upload the link on rutracker to update RW to version 27.5a?"
