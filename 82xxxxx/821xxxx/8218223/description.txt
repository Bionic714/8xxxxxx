The EWS Class 66 V2.0 for Train Simulator is a re-worked model of a previous version, with an updated and improved interior and re-modelled exterior. Available in EWS livery, the model features accurate brake control and centre-sprung brake lever, accurate engine and horn sounds, JGA aggregate hopper wagons and OTA timber wagons. 

The model also comes as Quick Drive compatible, giving you the freedom to drive it on any Quick Drive enabled route for Train Simulator. Also included are scenarios specifically for the West Coast Main Line North route (available separately and required to play these scenarios).
