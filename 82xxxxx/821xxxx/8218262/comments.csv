,Dmoney604,2013-03-05T02:27Z,"if the ""future"" means a year or two....sure... not sooner thats for sure.."
,TheOriginalCoda,2013-03-07T23:05Z,"I dont think you got equipment that can play back 48fps dude. After you buy new TV then you gotta wait till theres a 48fps BD standard, and your bd player gets an update. How likely is that considering those barsted manufacturers that dont give updates so you'll buy new stuff every year?"
,Dreadlokz,2013-03-10T13:44Z,"48FPS prob only web-dl versions, maybe. Downloading this one and if a 48fps comes out, i'm gonna check it out with a 60fps pc monitor.
Tyvm!"

While the movie plays fine, if i skip forward the movie suddenly freezes. But only the movie freezes and not anything else cause I can shut vlc with no problem and I can use other programs as well. Is this a problem with my pc or is it the file?"
