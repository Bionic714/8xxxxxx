Trip to Egypt is a FREE EP by R&B Singer/Songwriter Star Murphy that is an all expense paid vacation through her mind hosted by Grand Hustle/HoodRich's DJ MLK and DJ Wheezy. She spins her life story of love, lessons learned, conflict and resolution throughout the mixtape. The EP elegantly unites the classic soul of yesterday with the hip sounds of today's R&B and Pop. It features RioVille, Memphis' own Don Trip, StarLito (Formerly All-Star), and has production from Key Wane, RioVille, and Ducko McFli. Star Murphy gives the fans her real name "Kourtney Murphy" to give them a more personal feel about her journey to Egypt
