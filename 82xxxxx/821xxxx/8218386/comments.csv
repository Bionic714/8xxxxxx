I know this is off-topic. But, I must have to ask you; I'm in need of that.

I need SQL Server 2012 Enterprise SP1 (KOPiE's best :D)..

I saw your previous SQL 2012 torrent, but I need SP1 integrated. If you have, please please please upload it.

THANKS a LOT"

,amit375,2013-03-09T11:36Z,not the final retail version infact install.win file showing date 26/7/2012 its a preview version dont download it
,amit375,2013-03-09T16:24Z,"i've downloaded this torrent n when i saw the ""install.wim"" file in the ""/sources"" folder, its showing date 26/7/2012. on this date windows 8 wasn't realese either. i think this is the pre windows 8 version not the final retail n ofcource not the updated one either, so download it on their own risk, its wasted my bandwidth. uploader should've think twice before uploading this kind of torrent. there is only 1 windows 8 which is release on 26 oct 2012 download it and update it.
