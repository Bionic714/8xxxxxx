GDR (General Distribution Release) & RTM (Release to Manufacturing/Marketing) are different versions.

GDR contains security and critical stability issue fixes  for improving reliability and performance in battery life, Windows 8 apps, Start screen, audio and video playback, and driver compatibility(very important)

 While using Windows 8 RTM version ... in My computer (AMD Athlon X2 3GHz processor & 4 GB RAM...)
my computer hangs a lot... first I thought there is some problem with computer hardware ..
so to check that I installed Win 7 SP1 & it is working flawlessly without hanging .
then I googled about it & found that RTM version is not final version.

If you are using Win 7 now, check above step & you will find that it's GDR & not RTM .."
,PlzLogIn,2013-03-09T16:28Z,"Read this people, it clarifies everything up (in other words download this torrent then do the following to make it GDR):

Windows 8 RTM and GDR Meaning:

RTM- is short for Release To Manufacturing/Marketing (ready for general availability)
GDR- General Distribution Release (containing security and critical stability issue fixes).


There is no difference between RTM and Retail Channel release. In fact, the retail channel build was compiled a day before the RTM build.

This is the update (Windows8-RT-KB2756872) which was released on 10th Oct 2012 makes it GDR release.

Further, MS has no plan in future to integrate these updates/patches to the windows 8 ISO to make it one like it was done in Windows 7. all patches and updates will be always available on online.
the current version of windows 8 Pro x64 bits after updateds and patches is 9200.16424.amd64fre.win8_gdr.120926-1855
but yes, people are making it one after integrating these updates and patches (customized ISO) using MS Assessment and Deployment Tools.(edited). This means there is no ISO of windows 8 with all the updates including the gdr to dwonload from a microsoft unless some People make a cusomized ISO with updates and Patches.

so either you use RTM or so called retail, makes it no difference.

This Update is huge about 160MB for 64bit and 97MB for 32bit system, contains fixes for improving reliability and performance in battery life, Windows 8 apps, Start screen, audio and video playback, and driver compatibility.(edited)

I made this post to all the People who is still confusing from a copy of windows 8 RTM,Leaked last August and the one Released last October.its the same build and its no difference. To make it GDR released u have to install the update i mentioned above .

If still not satisfied from my post re-install windows go to my post . and follow the instruction on how to know your current build and os
Using "" REGEDIT "" u see like this 
9200.16424.amd64fre.win8_rt.120725-124 means on 25th July 2012 at 12 hours 47 minutes. this is win8 reach rtm.
After installing update Windows8-RT-KB2756872-x64 . your build become gdr
U see like this 9200.16424.amd64fre.win8_gdr.120926-1855

The value above on a red highlight indicate the value the last 10 digits denotes date and time of the build
120926-1855
yymmdd-hhmm
means: 
12 = year 2012
09= Month September
26= date 26
18= Hours
55= minutes
so this build is compiled on
26th September 2012 at 18 hours 55 minutes. "

,PlzLogIn,2013-03-09T16:59Z,"So do I have to install this using a USB/External HDD, it can't be burnt onto a DVD??"
,thegarrett,2013-03-09T19:09Z,"@PlzLogIn

you can burn this on DVD.  because it's less than 4.3 GB. 
use nero or ultraiso to burn this on DVD.

But many people prefer USB installation , because it's having great reading speed as compare to DVD.

use this link & download  - it's microsoft usb tool for usb installation.
http://images2.store.microsoft.com/prod/clustera/framework/w7udt/1.0/en-us/Windows7-USB-DVD-tool.exe

but use a blank usb because this usb program will format your usb drive & make bootable for installation ."

,theonenext2you,2013-03-12T12:54Z,"Thanks for the upload.

I just have a question. As far as I know, windows 8 enterprise uses either KMS or MAK as a license and this activator act as the KMS. 

So it would means that I have to use the activator to re-activate windows 8 enterprise every 180 days. correct?"
