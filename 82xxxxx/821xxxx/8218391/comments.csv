,Kelisen,2013-03-05T04:36Z,Nvm was using the wrong file.
,Glenn_K9,2013-03-05T15:41Z,Same problem can't seem to get the activation crack to function.  
,ChrisGTR,2013-03-05T16:43Z,I can't get it to work either. Anyone have a code that works or a way to run the crack?

,Sgriffith61,2013-03-05T19:47Z,This is crap. Activator does not work. 
,Grodann,2013-03-05T20:55Z,"Same problem, the activation thingy doesn't work..."
,Grodann,2013-03-05T21:01Z,"Here are my three main problems:
1. The activator itself doesn't work.
2. I can't run the .VBS script for some reason (error code: 800a0046) 
3. When I launch QEMU it just pops up and then closes in a blink of an eye.

Can anybody help me? I need this badly for my studies and can't afford buying the real thing =/"
,Grodann,2013-03-05T22:44Z,"SOLUTION!

If you've encountered any problems with the included crack then I highly recommend downloading this Toolkit.

First of all, run as administrator (IMPORTANT!) then select the office button as the green text says. Under the Product Keys tab select Office 2013 and pro plus on edition and just hit install!

You are so welcome!"
,iToastie,2013-03-06T06:13Z,What's the link to the toolkit?
[V],bubanee,2013-03-06T07:12Z,whats the link... just leave out the beginning of the link... i'm sure we can figure out http :)

,antde2001,2013-03-08T06:57Z,Does anyone know if the kms activated version will successfully connect Outlook to a server or will only  a legally purchased copy do so? My outlook doesn't seem to be able to connect.
,vikrant47,2013-03-08T13:19Z,"can anyone tell the difference between RETAIL, VOLUME, SELECT, ENTERPRISE, AND PROFESSIONAL EDITIONS. 
i have ""Office Select Edition 2013 15.0.4420.1017 VL"" . 
which edition is the best?"
,orion8_2012,2013-03-08T15:31Z,"vikrant47, instead of looking for the best, why not get the version that works!"
,mom2jna,2013-03-10T18:55Z,downloaded successfully but could not install on Windows 8
,guccicar,2013-03-12T23:35Z,Whats up with just posting keys?
,brandonmorgan1234,2013-03-14T04:21Z,Works great. Used the Microsoft.Toolkit.(2.4.1).(Windows.8.and.Office.2013.Activator) to activate. And daemon tools lite to mount iso 
,brandonmorgan1234,2013-03-15T04:45Z,Says it is activated but keeps crashing now...
,eurobred,2013-03-21T05:05Z,can we update?
,eurobred,2013-03-21T05:14Z,can we update??
,Newb787,2013-03-27T03:32Z,I don't like these....I may just have to goto 2010 or 2017. These activators mess up my legit windows and tells me that it is not legit even though it is. 
,tracksuit,2013-03-27T09:43Z,i just mounted with daemon tools lite and ran the exe and it worked...i didnt need to use an activator.
,themistoklis,2013-04-04T10:49Z,"Works fine with activator, thank you."
,jumbo3220,2013-04-14T07:02Z,"installed without a problem on my Windows 7 Ultimate SP1 ,working fine..but seems bit slow to respond some action compared to office 2010.

Activated successfully from Microsoft Tool Kit 2.4.1

i didn't try the activator came with this.

Thanks uploader :)"
