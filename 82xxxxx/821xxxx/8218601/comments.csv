,CapPanda,2013-03-04T18:34Z,Thanks Unpopular all the other up-loaders seem to have missed the fact that two episodes aired the first night.
,hanksantana,2013-03-04T18:45Z,"I know you're a trusted uploader, but can anyone confirm this early release as legit? My computer is on it's last leg, I don't want to risk a virus"
[T],MrUnpopular,2013-03-04T19:05Z,"100% legit. Never done a fake, never will."
[T],MrUnpopular,2013-03-04T19:06Z,"@CapPanda No only one episode aired last night, the second one premiered online today."
,darksouleater87,2013-03-04T23:29Z,"Meh i prefer to wait, the only time that I watched some preari was the second episode fo the second season of GoT, I prefer the non-webrip video, but thanks anyway!"
,mhuitt,2013-03-05T02:40Z,Yes it's real. I just got through watching episode 1 and 2 on Comcast online.
,caffinate,2013-03-05T07:14Z,"It's the real deal, but the video quality is pretty terrible (but watchable with pretty heavy artifacting).  I'd only bother with this if you feel you can't wait, or intend to view it on a relatively small screen."
,zdubinit,2013-03-05T13:38Z,thank you!
