,bboyham,2013-03-05T21:10Z,Does this game have the forza 4 check that can ban you if it detects you don't have the whole game? Or just freezes after a while playing?
,Surovirusov,2013-03-06T13:56Z,"Works perfectly,god bless you thenoobish."
,Miku-chan,2013-03-06T21:23Z,"do not work because not enough space on the disc .. i choose truncate, but xbox do not read this disc. I checked in abgx:
Warning: This iso is short and this iso is too small, stealth check failed.
Help . ;/"
,Miku-chan,2013-03-07T17:40Z,"I put the disc in the drive and xbox don't reading this. xbox says ""Open Drive"" ;// Other games work..So it's not the fault of the laser. "

,Serwantes0123,2013-03-08T17:17Z,Hey just want to ask if it will be on RF ty.
,hoperpoper,2013-03-10T22:36Z,"abgx log says verification failed... I guess it'll need manual patch, anyone has done this yet??"
,phuitro,2013-03-13T11:21Z,"Ok, I've waited for this game so bad and it's funnily enough the first time that I encounter a problem when burning a game.

I already wasted 4 DVDs with different settings : 
-if I use burnermax, the dvd is unreadable.
-if i use truncate, the xbox doesn't recognize the dvd as miku-chan said.

I registered on this site just to say this because I don't know what to do anymore, please help me.

I use imgburn, clonecd might work better since asakato succeded."
,phuitro,2013-03-13T12:01Z,"It did work with clonecd, awesome. :)"
,fallowy,2013-03-13T20:43Z,"Hey guys! Last time, I've played my xbox 1,5 year ago and I don't know which number of LT+ is required for play in this. When I upgraded my console for Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood, it was LT+ 2.0 or something like that. Can anyone tell me what LT+ I need now? And sorry for my bad grammar, because I'm really bad in this (polish faggot ;_;)"
,PeteyP94,2013-04-17T00:22Z,"will imgburn work just aswell if i use a verbatim disk? otherwise clonecd may be my only option.

thanks :)"
