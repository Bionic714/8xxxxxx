Go to the pause menu

Change saving slot

lolwat
Ign review has been up since 2 weeks. And there a highly advertised game must really suck to get under 8.

That said, the game is quite good, and looks great on PC, especially indoors. Those trees still look kinda lame.

I downloaded it and all works well (albeit a bit slow) My computer exceeds the minimum requirements for sure but I am having gameplay issues. It seems to stall out for about 5 seconds every minute or so during action sequences and I have tried adjusting my graphics hoping something would resolve it but nothing has. Anyone experiencing this? Maybe it's just the cracked version or something. I don't know but it is seriously immersion breaking.

The game is pretty well optimized, except the 'special hair'.
On my config I can max everything except: hair on normal, depth of field on normal, SSAO on normal.
These 3 settings have big hit on performance, and except the hair, the other 2 are useless to put on high.
I can even set 2xSSAA instead of FXAA antialiasing, and the game still runs at over 40fps, and the ssaa looks really good.

In other words, the pc version shows it as polished like it should and it's worth buying original."

It pops up with those concentric circles and I've just had to guess what key it is that it wants me to press. It shows when I have to hit left and right just fine, but anything else and I have to guess. Once, it just showed a symbol of a hand and by the process of elimination I found that that meant I had to tap W.

,MiniST,2013-03-09T01:48Z,"Ok, I had the problem with ""Failed to Initialize Direct3D with current setting Options"" when pressing Play and the Options in the launcher crashed it. Basically you have to turn off ExclusiveFullScreen. Don't know where there is an option to turn that off in Windows 8. So basically, you have to go into the registry under HKEY_CURRENT_USERSoftwareCrystal DynamicsTomb Raider . There, you have to create a subkey under Tomb Raider called Graphics. In Graphics you need to create a DWORD called ExclusiveFullScreen and set it to 0. There will allow to you go pass the Play problem. People have been saying to edit the registry and find such and such values. If you can't get pass the launcher, the game doesn't create any registry values, so there is nothing to edit. After you get pass the launcher and go back to the Tomb Raider registry, you will see a whole bunch of new values there."
,AegisFate,2013-03-09T03:22Z,"@MiniST
Should make a tut on how to do this. The average user will probably somehow fuck this up big time but thanks so much for posting how to fix this. I got as far as finding the location where the graphics registry should be in regedit but wasn't sure what I should do after there, that makes sense to me though."

THAT WORKED! This fix must be spread! SPREAD SPREAD SPREAD!"
,AegisFate,2013-03-09T03:56Z,"A slightly easier to understand version of the fix above.

Okay, so I had the problem with ""Failed to Initialize Direct3D with current setting Options"" when pressing Play and the Options in the launcher crashed it. Basically you have to turn off ExclusiveFullScreen and there isn't really way to do that except through this method because the options screen would just crash the launcher!

FIX: Press the windows key + R to bring up Run and run 'regedit'. So basically, you have to go into the registry under 'HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Crystal Dynamics/Tomb Raider' . There, you have to create a subkey under Tomb Raider called 'Graphics'. In Graphics you need to create a DWORD called 'ExclusiveFullScreen' and set it to 0. (Should already be set to 0).
This will allow to you go pass the Play problem. 

People have been saying to edit the registry and find such and such values. If you can't get pass the launcher, the game doesn't create any registry values, so there is nothing to edit. After you get pass the launcher and go back to the Tomb Raider registry, you will see a whole bunch of new values there.

,Saitekman,2013-03-14T01:56Z,"Ok hope this helps some, if it doesn't then you need to learn some basics of mounting and copy and paste techniques.

1. Download Torrent (and fuck all of people that tell everyone else to seed... Geezus.. people will seed if they can telling them seed makes people say fuck off and not seed)

2. Mount the sr-tombraider with mounting software, I use Daemon Tools cuz I roll like that.

3. Once mounted install game

4. Next go to the mounted image by doing the following.  START > COMPUTER > Next look for the Tomb Raider that is mounted, it will be a new virtual Drive like E: > Right Click > Open in New Window

5. See that SKIDROW Folder? 

6. Copy All of those files and put it into your original Location Usually here for Win7 ""C:Program Files (x86)Square EnixTombraider

7. It will ask you if you want to Replace say yes

8. This is option but I like to do it just encase. Tombraider will probably have a shortcut on desktop. I like to delete that one and create a fresh one from the new Application Tombriader icon. 

9. Next go to your Firewall settings and block The Tombraider exe file. It might try and contact steam etc. 

10. Now Run the game from the Icon on your Desktop and you should be good. 

Good luck"

,Featherawr,2013-03-16T19:05Z,"Okay so I fixed the problem with Steam opening.

At least for me after upgrading to Windows 8, when ever I try to move a file to a directory that requires admin privileges, even after clicking ""continue"", what ever it looks like it's copying over and shows the pretty graphs but then it doesn't actually get moved to the new directory.  Because most of the files are meant to be overwritten I didn't notice anything different.

So the reason is because the Tomb Raider directory didn't have the crack, so if you're getting this problem make sure the crack is in the Tomb Raider directory at ""C:Program Files (x86)SQUARE ENIXTombraider"" or ""C:Program FilesSQUARE ENIXTombraider"" depending on whether your OS is 32-bit or 64-bit."

Still having the issue where the game crashes after clicking ""Play"" in the launch menu. Updated NVIDIA drivers (314.22), so both old and new drivers didn't fix issue. Downloaded Update 1. Did the graphics fixes (tesselation off, exclusive full screen etc) still not working. Anyone who has solved the issue please post or pm

Thanks!"

,pennknig,2013-04-09T21:58Z,"Seriously,,,,,,,,
This game was only mildly entertaining (for me) as it failed to capture my attention for what a prequel should of been.
I found that the game play was mostly a lot of running about looking for hidden objects, the battle sequence's were short and enemies were easily  overcome, even the 2nd play through on HARD.
I had suffered with the low FPS bug (17-24FPS) even though I have ATI. I had to close/restart several times to get back up to 70+FPS,,,,,not entertaining at all, and very annoying! 
3 Updates,,,,,Ya,,,BS on that!
Even a free game like Black Mesa that looks as good, and runs at full specks, has no bugs that I can recall.

Time for game developers to stop making/producing shitty software  and relying on hardware to make there shit run. 
Time for proper coding and less relying on the late$t hardware."

,moorees,2013-05-12T09:14Z,bigfile.000.tiger corruption errors may be from using old extraction software. Try using the very latest winrar (version 5.00 beta 3) or 7zip (7-Zip 9.30 alpha). If that doesn't work and you are on 64-bit windows and still having problems try using the 32-bit versions of winrar and 7zip.

@wcrouse747 download SuperISO, create a virtual disc drive, mount the ISO to the virtual disc drive(this tricks your computer into thinking you have an actual copy of the disc in your computer), open the disc in your ""My Computer"" menu, double-click the setup or install .exe file, then follow the rest of the directions in the torrent description up there ^^^^^"
