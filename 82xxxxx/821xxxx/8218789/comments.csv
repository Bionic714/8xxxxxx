There is the proper episode 10 that as far as i can tell makes this a complete set. I'm cross checking everything now."
,axprodigy1,2013-03-05T17:19Z,God I'm Having a derp day. Ignore first comment altogether. Second comment is correct but it replaces s01e08 in this set. Sorry for any confusion folks.

,axprodigy1,2013-03-05T22:07Z,You have them labeled correctly yes but upon downloading and verifying episode 8 and episode 11 are in fact the same episode.
