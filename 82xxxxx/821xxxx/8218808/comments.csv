,mantispraying,2013-03-04T18:35Z,Only 457kb? Seriously? I thought the crack would be at least 50MB 
,clemlenain,2013-03-06T22:07Z,"hey thx for up
Can't get the game to work , i'am not new to cracked games and did everything ok , but when i click tombraider nothing happens...
I can see tombraider.exe running in taskmgr for a few seconds and then it desappears and the game doesn't launch...
Any idea ? "
,ktos1989,2013-03-09T09:42Z,clemlenain I have the same problem and I am asking the same question.
,piratenumber11,2013-05-23T23:02Z,"I also have the same problem, tried the nos team version as well, but it is probably just skidrow used copy with the crack in it already. But what is weird is that I think those things are not really cracks since the exe does not get replaced - but I am no expert, just someone who has done these things at least 50 times and this is the first time when I cannot do anything about it"
,piratenumber11,2013-05-25T21:36Z,"I just found out that the issue is with DirectX being outdated (I had version 6 on my pc) and the game requirements state 9 or higher, so this might have been the issue."
,piratenumber11,2013-05-25T22:44Z,"hmm nope, updating DirectX did not solve my ""nothing happens problem"" If anyone finds a solution, pls, let me know"
