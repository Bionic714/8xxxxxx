Princess Mononoke English subtitles
for use with the original Japanese soundtrack
v1.0

-----

These subtitles are synched to the following file:

Mononoke.hime.1997.HDTV.720p.2xAC3.x264.mkv
(4.29 GB, 1280x720, dual AC-3 audio)

I wasn't happy with the subtitles that were included with the above mkv, so I spent WAY too much time putting together my own.

Included are instructions on how to embed them in the original mkv, and my e-mail so you can send any feedback, comments, corrections, complaints, recipes, manifestos, and really bad jokes.

Enjoy!
