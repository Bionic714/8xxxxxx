Where is the exe? Or is this all that is needed? "
,plagasx,2013-03-05T04:14Z,I believe the Exe in Tomb Raider is already unprotected so no crack exe is needed.
,OmarKH,2013-03-05T14:04Z,"This is the only crack that saves right now, right?
but does it support windows 8? and does it unlock the DLC?

Thanks"
,limelight908,2013-03-06T00:42Z,Had trouble installing this but then watched a guy called gligar2tennyson on utube. He does amazing tutorials and his videos helped me crack this game!
,suntgata,2013-03-06T07:12Z,Saves Work Perfectly. But anyone else getting crashes after some time of playing?
,yomama2013,2013-03-06T09:37Z,save not working for me
,AegisFate,2013-03-06T21:11Z,"Anyone having a problem where when the run the tombraider application and click play it says ""Failed to initialize Direct3D with current settings""?"
,xcrimsonprophecyx,2013-03-07T00:11Z,"None of the cracks I've found on here have allowed me to save the game. It's almost as if there is a folder association missing - the game will allow you to save but it doesn't know where to save to. So every time you go back into the menu and try and resave...your data isn't there.

But at the same time you get a ""save successful"" message. It might be the crack but it's more than likely the version of the game I have downloaded if others have it working and none of these cracks work for me.

I'll have to look into the problem and post any pos progress I make toward a solution."
,skunky99,2013-03-07T03:15Z,Please keep an eye out for Sim City.  I blew $80 on a game I can't even play.
