,aquanash,2013-03-05T08:09Z,Looks like crack might be bad.  I can never get past the cutscene part where you come out of the cave and have to press a button before the guy strangles you.  No matter what you press you always die.
,MLO89,2013-03-05T08:50Z,I turned off Tessellation and TressFX and the crashing stopped on my 680. Now I have to narrow it down between those two. Gotta be a driver thing as the game runs butter smooth maxed out.

,Janou_23,2013-03-05T14:23Z,to everyone who's complaining about the slow speed  maybe u guys should stop limiting ur upload speed and then u will get a decent download speed and then we don't have to listen to ur whining  
,virtualmatrix258,2013-03-05T14:48Z,"0.1kbps...fuck it, I'll download elsewhere. Nobody can seed because the first cunts that downloaded it have shitty upload speed. If you're so cheap not to buy a game, why not upgrade your internet? That's what I did..."
,MAA11792,2013-03-05T15:20Z,"Thank you. It works like a charm, but the game itself.. sucks on ice."
,MarQu1s,2013-03-05T15:31Z,"Anyone complaining about slow speeds needs to start using DDL instead of torrents, especially for newly released games such as this one because:

1) there's always too many leechers hence the awful speeds

and 2) tons of DDL links have just been posted which means there's guaranteed to be working links out there that are easy to find

So if you're sick and tired of downloading at less than 100 kB/s and want to max out your connection like I do at 3.5 MB/s, all you need are these three things:

-rpnet (may look too good to be true, but I can assure you it isn't)

-IDM

-filestube

BTW, I am in no way affiliated with any of the above, I just want to help those who are unaware that there are way better alternatives out there.

...thank me later, and thank you ez for being one of the best contributors on here."

Great graphics, great controls, high tension story of survival, and just overall a very solid Tomb Raider game. I'm really really enjoying what I've played so far.

Thank you so much, extremezone, for the upload. I've been waiting a long time for this! So once again, thank you!!

I'm going to go ahead a BUY this to show support for the great work done over at Crystal Dynamics. Played all of their other great Tomb Raider games from start to finish. Well done, CD!"

,civoniz,2013-03-06T13:35Z,"As Nvidia revealed:

    “We are aware of major performance and stability issues with GeForce GPUs running Tomb Raider with maximum settings. Unfortunately, NVIDIA didn’t receive final code until this past weekend which substantially decreased stability, image quality and performance over a build we were previously provided. We are working closely with Crystal Dynamics to address and resolve all game issues as quickly as possible.
    In the meantime, we would like to apologize to GeForce users that are not able to have a great experience playing Tomb Raider, as they have come to expect with all of their favorite PC games.”"

,AegisFate,2013-03-09T03:31Z,"I had the problem with ""Failed to Initialize Direct3D with current setting Options"" when pressing Play and the Options in the launcher crashed it. Basically you have to turn off ExclusiveFullScreen. Don't know where there is an option to turn that off in Windows 8. Press the windows key + R to bring up Run and run regedit. So basically, you have to go into the registry under HKEY_CURRENT_USERSoftwareCrystal DynamicsTomb Raider . There, you have to create a subkey under Tomb Raider called Graphics. In Graphics you need to create a DWORD called ExclusiveFullScreen and set it to 0. There will allow to you go pass the Play problem. People have been saying to edit the registry and find such and such values. If you can't get pass the launcher, the game doesn't create any registry values, so there is nothing to edit. After you get pass the launcher and go back to the Tomb Raider registry, you will see a whole bunch of new values there.
I just figured this fix out so bare with me on the instructions if they're not 100% clear.
Post feedback!
Worked for me!

Let it install :)
After install, find the folder in program files (or program files x86 for me) that the installer ""executed"" or installed.
Copy the CONTENTS of the SKIDROW folder (not the folder itself, the stuff inside it!) and paste into your game folder (not installation folder!)
It will ask to copy and replace, so copy and replace ;)

If not working ask why, and look at torrent description and re-download some stuff that it tells you 0-0"

Going to be one of the games of the year without doubt.

Download and install when without a hitch, DL speed very good. (Ignore the idiots saying it's slow, they just don't now how to set up their torrent client properly)

Only problem is..... the crashing. I does crash a fair few times. 1 minute it won't crash for 2-3 hours of gameplay, then the next minute it will crash the whole system twice inside 15mins. It's annoying but tolerable, the game is so good it's worth it.

If you have problems with the game crashing like I did, try these 2 things, they solved it for me.

#1 - If you have an overclocked graphics card, GPU or VRAM doesn't matter, restore it to default. I had my card OC'ed quite a bit and although I know 100% that my system is stable this game just doesn't seem to like a good overclock.

2# - Disable Tessellation."

,darkm12,2013-04-05T00:18Z,"Just a heads up..

I d/l'd this from a reputable private tracker and after playing the game once I experienced lots of Nvidia driver crashes (TDR errors).  It turns out I picked up some malware called iehighutil.exe (aka ieutil.exe) which uses your GPU to mine bitcoins and can also run your card until it fries.  I run good AV/anti-malware and nothing picked up this yet (it's probably new).  It was easy to remove by deleting C:Temp files or C:Temporary files and then searching the registry for all ""iehighutil.exe"" entries and deleting them.

I thought I had a busted vid card or bad PSU, but it was just bullshit malware that apparently inserts itself stealthily under pirated games installs.  Watch out!"
,terrysilver,2013-04-05T20:50Z,"does anyone know where the save file is? bcs if I have to clean my laptop to factory settings I don't want to have to restart the whole story, I will like to play the game where I left off at when I reinstall the game. or do I have to restart the whole story?"
,tonivh666,2013-04-06T19:42Z,the game works just perfect. thnx
,Banyana,2013-04-12T20:35Z,"I've downloaded this twice, and each time I get a ""Bigfile.000.tiger"" corruption error while trying to install it.

A few other people in the comments have had this problem, but I don't see any sort of fix. (It stops the installation altogether, so it's not an error i'm making)

Anyone know what to do? I'm on Win 7 64 bit if it helps :3"
,hydra570,2013-04-13T04:04Z,"This is a great torrent!
But i'm having problem playing it.
I put the cracked files into the main folder and block tomb raider in the firewall. But every time i launch the game, it'll just open up steam to try to connect.
Can any one tell me what did i missed out to play the game?"

 Its not the torrent, its your operating system/configs or your virus protection/firewall or your not following instructions correctly.  If you have problems with the torrent go to youtube and type "" how to download and crack game torrents"". You will find several how to videos with step by step instructions. If your still having problems slow down and follow the directions closely.
 If your still having some kind of error messages or problems start reading at the second paragraph of this comment. I hope this helps anyone with problems. Peace to all!! and please support the software companies that provide these games. Thanks again EZ"

,moorees,2013-05-12T09:06Z,"@Banyana

If anyone is having installation corruption after you did a Force Re-check in utorrent then try this: The issue may be your extraction software. You MUST use the latest winrar (version 5.00 BETA 3) or 7zip (7-Zip 9.30 ALPHA). If that doesn't help then try the 32-bit x86 versions even if you are on 64-bit windows."
,_n3ur0_,2013-05-14T18:47Z,"working perfectly on gtx680!
for all those who got: 
1. installation errors - use 7zip, it way better than other similar progs.
2. nvidia driver error - try updating drivers, if it doesn't help - google smth like ""How to get a clean install of nvidia drivers?"""

,pmchelp2,2013-05-19T01:20Z,"Works great! check out gameplay on my channel, go to youtube and search GoodToKnowGamer"
,pennknig,2013-05-22T17:38Z,"FarCry 3,,,,,much better game than this, find out for yourself, just DL it and give it a chance...........
Close, very close though, the biggest difference, the deal maker/breaker,,,,FC3 map is all one map, it doesn't have to load sections of its map like TR, and that makes it infinitely travelable."
,Ch3mtr4il,2013-05-25T17:14Z,is the multiplayer working ?
