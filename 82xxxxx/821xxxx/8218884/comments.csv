,logan-x-art,2013-03-05T00:36Z,A bunch of goddamn fairy tales made for weak minded morons...
,slee406,2013-03-05T01:14Z,"So then I guess they made it for you, since your statement proves what a weak minded moron you are."
,heeddabaw,2013-03-05T05:21Z,By asking God to Damn Logan you must believe he exists!!  :)
,chancet,2013-03-05T08:38Z,"Be nice peoples...  It's a shame the freedom coming from a lack of comment moderation-ability on Pirate Bay results in so much hate...

I experienced a 1080p movie for the first time on The History Channel, watching this.  I found it totally worth getting to a good television for.  :)

If anyone has seen a 1080p copy of this film, let me know!  I'd love to see it again like that!"
,hayesy316,2013-03-05T09:34Z,"LOLZ DA BIBLE IS STUPID HERP DERP.

But seriously, thanks. This sounds interesting. For the record, I'm an atheist (as if it matters), but the Bible is an important cultural document."
,bragazar1710,2013-03-05T15:09Z,thanks!

,vi37n0w,2013-03-06T09:27Z,This was the most watched show premiere in the channels history. Having grown up in the church I do not need to see another re-hash of the bible. Without even seeing the film I be all my money in my pocket versus all the money in your's that this show even tries to introduce or explain parts of the bible in a new way that balances the crazy factor of believing this book of tales...
,dennukavi,2013-03-06T09:47Z,oh common..logan-x-art would have rated Porn Movie 10/10..
,vicvod,2013-03-06T14:18Z,"""There are no atheists in foxholes"" which is so true if you have been confronted by an armed enemy. When it's logans time to go, he'll be crying like a little baby, praying for salvation. Thanks for the great upload ettv."
,ringknocker,2013-03-07T23:53Z,"Thank goodness the History Channel has recognized the Bible as a true historical document.

I will pray for those that need enlightenment."

,udumazz,2013-03-08T05:45Z,"logan
Now there's a different opinion....
We are now enlightened....
As a person who does not have faith in a God, I would never call myself an atheist because of bigoted pricks like you.
Live and let live. And don't stroke your own ego.
Thanks for the up! "
,nhughes5,2013-03-08T19:35Z,"A9/V9 Nice quality. Thank you uploader.
Commenters: You need to address the quality of the video instead of discussing it's merit or meaning. Others don't care about your personal opinions."
,Therrito,2013-03-09T00:39Z,"@GMT THANK YOU!! :-D

@logan-x-art I'm sure Satan has the fires of Hell stoked and is eagerly awating your arrival."
,isepiq,2013-03-10T04:25Z,"There is NO apple in Genesis: Forbidden Fruit was sexual intercourse.
There is NO talking snake in Genesis: It was the most clever mamal of the field. It is turned into a snake AFTER Sex with Eve.
Eve has two babies, not twins, one from the Beast, Cain, and one from Adam, Able. I don't blame people thinking the Bible is a Fable when it is not translated or taught correctly.
Sorcerer and Withc: Pharmakie.  Drug Dealers.
Holy Spirit or Ghost:  Holy Mind.
Evil Spirti:  Evil Mind.
The Bible is not a Fable when you have real knowledge instead of propaganda.
This copy is A:10 V:10  Very watchable on the big screen tv."
,gyhser,2013-03-11T05:12Z,"""Is there anyone who ever remembers changing their mind from the paint on a sign?
Is there anyone who really recalls ever breaking rank at all for something someone yelled real loud one time?""

Just relax, Piratebay is not the forum for any of these debates to have any significance. "
,Jack0ff,2013-03-12T03:38Z,i cant wait for Deuteronomy episode: 50 shekels for rape
,DogNo7,2013-03-15T05:43Z,"It is always interesting to see ""open minded"" progressives try to intimidate free thinking people from investigating things for themselves, thinking about it, and coming to their own conclusions.

Open minded thinking is allowing anyone to think freely for themselves, not trying to shove your anti religious dogma down people's throats (minds, actually).

On the other hand, people that embrace allowing people to think for themselves will always have my respect, regardless of what their views happen to be."
,chaiyont2,2013-03-18T06:11Z,DogNo7: Nice comment. Thanks for posting it.
,alCIAda,2013-03-21T06:32Z,"Thank you for the upload.  

@isepiq
Eve did have twins, they were bi-paternal twins, meaning that each twin has a different father.  She was fucked by the Seraphim and then ran to Adam and Fucked him!"
,andrew1av,2013-03-23T15:01Z,Thanks !!!
,e46fanatic,2013-03-25T01:58Z,"""There are no atheists in foxholes"" does not mean anything except that people are afraid of death, and in that moment they are open to anything.  I think God is real, but all religions are bullshit.  The Bible was written by man hundreds of years after Jesus died and was influenced by politics and the need to spread morals and cleanliness.  Why would anyone dedicate their life to such obvious bologna and believe their opinions to be higher than those of other faiths?  ""Christians"" hold an extremely wide variety of beliefs and interpret the Bible in many, many ways.  Anyone that claims to know the truth is simply a liar, and if they believe they are right, then they are just ignorant.  "

,z1ide,2013-03-29T17:31Z,Thanks =D
,masterchin,2013-04-12T05:17Z,I dont understand why people have the time to search for this movie just to come comment talking shit about others who like this movie... Get a life
,injectr,2013-04-29T19:42Z,"Isnt it strage how the Catholic Church removes sections of the bible that turn out not being true.  WTF is up with that.  The Bible was huge at first, now is way smaller.  "
,injectr,2013-04-29T19:43Z,"Oh, and the reason I came here is to download this for Co Workers.  Not my cup of tea. They are the ones who started bashing me for not believing in the divine."
,e46fanatic,2013-05-01T08:32Z,The Bible is the most commonly stolen book in America.
