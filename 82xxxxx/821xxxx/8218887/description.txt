All six episodes of the controversial 1969 ITV sitcom starring Spike Milligan. Written by Johnny Speight, the series was apparently intended to highlight racial issues, but it received so many complaints for being racist that it was pulled after only six episodes. Set on the factory floor of Lillicrap Ltd, the series sees a blacked-up Spike Milligan playing an Asian immigrant called Kevin O'Grady. Eric Sykes, Norman Rossington and Kenny Lynch co-star.
