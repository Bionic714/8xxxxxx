,dontlikefake,2013-03-05T19:48Z,what is the point of putting this on piratebay if the uploader is not going to seed this. i have been waiting for someone to seed this for the last 24 hours and still no one seeding this.it says there is five seeders which there not even one.. i really think this is a fake torrent or its dead one

Should go now without problem"
,dontlikefake,2013-03-05T23:58Z,since the time after when i left my last comment. there still are no seeders.. i think that the problem is at your end. try checking the settings are ok.. is there anyone else having the same problem waiting a long time for the download to start??
