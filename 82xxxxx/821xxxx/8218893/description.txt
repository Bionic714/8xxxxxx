Others:
If you start a new game press TAB + Q to change model, you will see a green arrow instead of the real model. Just make a save game and press TAB+Q again. When you are using Ryo model you can't change your clothes or make haircuts. For the new missions search the little flag on the radar (with white and black). For those missions you don't have to make save game because the game automatically saves after each race. If during a race one of your oponents dies (car crash or fall in water...) the game might crash. Just load the game again and hope your oponent will drive better :) On some of the races you will have nitro. If you want to start the racing missions from the beginning again put the files from folder "BACKUP MISSIONS" in "cleo" folder. (Optional)-you can use the savegame from folder "Bonus" and put it in "My DocumentsGTA San Andreas User Files" (next to gta_sa.set). If you want to play the original missions use TAB + M (some of them crash)
