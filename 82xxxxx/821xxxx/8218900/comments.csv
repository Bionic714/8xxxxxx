,limelight908,2013-03-06T00:43Z,Had trouble installing this but then watched a guy called gligar2tennyson on utube. He does amazing tutorials and his videos helped me crack this game!
,clemlenain,2013-03-06T09:22Z,"hey thx for up
Can't get the game to work , i'am not new to cracked games and did everything ok , but when i click tombraider nothing happens...
I can see tombraider.exe running in taskmgr for a few seconds and then it desappears and the game doesn't launch...
Any idea ? "
,coolguy555,2013-03-06T11:36Z,Good Speed... Hope the game works
,gulisa,2013-03-06T12:56Z,fail speed...damm fuk.....fukin leechers should be all banned
,princelestat,2013-03-07T15:01Z,so it took me fourteen hours to play though overall a good game and crack there are a few glitchy spots when you fall through floors and where the frame rate drops during button mashing event intead of just mashing the hell out of it try rythmicly pressing it in a slow manner
,princelestat,2013-03-07T15:03Z,oh and thats a 100% playthrough all relics documents skills gear and challenges everything works 
,Drofsned,2013-03-19T06:56Z,Turning down the music volume option doesn't do anything. Got a fix?
