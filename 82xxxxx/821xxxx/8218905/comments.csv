,pjones452,2013-03-05T03:16Z,thanks man!
,SBonesE8,2013-03-05T03:17Z,"how is the quality of the 3d? was this relaesed 3d in theaters? dont rememeber,an surely its better if not a conversion"
,pjones452,2013-03-05T04:49Z,it was released in 3D but this is the slowest dl ever
,j_purvis,2013-03-05T06:17Z,I have my computer going to my 3d TV. Haven't tried it yet. Can anyone recommend a good 3d media player?
,rooboy64,2013-03-05T08:40Z,i think best 3d player is powerdvd make sure you find newest version as the 3d got better on it.
,th3_on3,2013-03-05T08:43Z,This is what I was waiting for right mutha effin here. Something told me to see if someone leaked this yet. I might not even buy it now. This was going to be the last 3D movie I purchase ever! hmm..decisions decisions.
,alastor222,2013-03-05T12:46Z,Slowest torrent ever!!!
,SBonesE8,2013-03-05T15:36Z,"if u wanted to buy,maybe its even higher quality,id venture.guess it depends if u have a huge screen.
sure 16 gb is going ot look great tho

as for a player,yes pwerdvd12 is what i got,tho (an maybe this is my comp[uter,) sometimes audio seems to lag behind in 3d or real hi rez stuff over the ourse of an hour... weird i wish i knew what to tweak.
this happene in spartacus 1080p torrent from russia(an why isnt spartacus in 1080 here when i checked?,took 2 hours to find)

well looking foward to this.should be done in 1-2 days i left it going overnight an got 80% done so if its slow learn how to better your utorrent.

ps to all the people who complain about speed an scream SEED!!  i hate u an so do others
i had cable guys come out 3 times when finally i got a cool guy who explained how the other 2 installers were lazy an incompetant.he went up on the outside pole actually an ran a  whole new line to the house,an new line thru the wall.removed all the extra,overly old wire from bs install 6 monthes ago.bandwith jumped to more than is even advertised for speed i was paying for.

most of you do not even have a great internet connection an u dont know it(an sometimes its based on area a bit an not much can b changed)
butbitching about seeding is BS go do something else an when its done its done dont fiend out for free contenet like a  crackhead 

i will seed.an watch the lotr trilogy also its amazing(if u live ina cave an have never seen somea the best movies ever)"
,RenzoHodw,2013-03-05T16:09Z,I can take the spanish audio version and add it to this version without losing sync?
,gungrave4ever,2013-03-06T04:04Z,"PowerDVD sucks; audio becomes unsynced (gotta keep pausing the movie every five minutes to let it resync) and it's bulky.

Stereoscopic Player is small and the audio stays synced, though you gotta tweak settings depending on what kind of 3D output you have."
,pjones452,2013-03-06T10:20Z,This is great quality thanks for your hard work brother!
,pixeltistic,2013-03-06T12:01Z,i got 50mb internet and downloading since yesterday.. its not even on 15%!! unbelievable?
,snowteo,2013-03-07T12:01Z,"Downloading for 5 days now !!!
YIFI we need you :("
,darcon9672,2013-03-07T21:41Z,YIFI torrents suck yea the video quality is great but audio sucks 2 channels come on get with the times i wont dl anything unless it has 5.1 surround and YIFI already said no to 5.1 
,CaptNuggz,2013-03-07T23:15Z,"I'm just wondering, with PublicHD doing all of these great HD 3D torrents, why are all of the files in MKV format? My PS3 doesn't play them, my 3DTV can't play them, and my DVD/DivX player can't play them.

How does anybody actually watch these torrents in 3D?"
,darcon9672,2013-03-08T01:12Z,what format doesnt bother me if it dont play i just convert it to one that does with a little research you can find free programs that will do it one of the ones i use is   freemake video converter its free and it works
,RenzoHodw,2013-03-08T16:26Z,Can i take the Spanish audio and add it to this file without losing sync?
,snowteo,2013-03-08T22:26Z,"I tried to transfer it to my usb flash and it says that it is too large
I tried to transfer it to my 500 GB external hard disc device and it's also says that it is too large for the transfer !!
Any ideas ??"
,snowteo,2013-03-08T22:28Z,"I convert the file to 5,50 GB avi format and it still says the same thing :("
,thaitran,2013-03-09T01:13Z,snowteo make sure your hard drive or usb is ntfs
,frankiep626,2013-03-09T02:13Z,"For those that do not have 3D TVs.  You can go to:  http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7744910/Aiseesoft_3D_Converter_v6.3.12_Including_Crack_[iahq76]  and use Aiseesoft 3D Converter to convert this (after Downloaded) to a 3D Anaglyph File (Red Cyan 3D glasses) which will play on any TV in 3D.  BUT, be sure to convert the file over to a .vob file with for PAL.  Do NOT use the NTSC settings for this.  All files go out of sync when using .vob NTSC.  I found out the hard way....Trial and error.  To burn to a DVD, just use NeroVision to build a DVD file and then burn it to disc with Nero Burning ROM.  

This is my resolution for anyone that wants to view SBS files in 3D that don't have the equipment (i.e. 3D TVs and 3D Blu-Ray Players).  "
,snowteo,2013-03-09T12:02Z,"""thaitran"" that was the problem...
Thank you !"
,electrond,2013-03-09T13:59Z,Text is not working on this version but thanks for the upload 
,hmv_ind,2013-03-09T14:49Z,"@j_purvis
You don't need any 3D media player if your computer is connected to 3DTV. Just play the video file in say, Media Player classic or VLC (both players will show two squeezed side by side frames, hence the name 'half side-by-side'). Switch on 3D feature in your tv. Since this movie is in H-SBS format, select the 'side by side' option in your TV, and you're done!"
,hmv_ind,2013-03-09T15:02Z,"@snowteo.
Format your flash drive in NTFS format, then copy the file."
,snowteo,2013-03-09T15:16Z,"I tried this one my friend and it doesn't work
The tv needs to read the format of the movie and change it for itself with the ""3D button"""
,xtrapeque,2013-03-17T12:17Z,only 23.976 frames? in the cine has 40fps
,MarvTigre,2013-03-17T19:59Z,"@xtrapeque AFAIK there were 4 versions realeased to the cinemas - 2D@24fps, 2D@48fps, 3D@24fps and 3D@fps

Here you can read why 48fps is not all that great: http://movieline.com/2012/12/14/hobbit-high-frame-rate-science-48-frames-per-second/"
,MarvTigre,2013-03-18T17:12Z,"There's a 4 sec gap at about 01:33:42, which causes subs to be out of sync from that moment on. 
Personally, I will just cut it out of the movie.
For those who can't be bothered - properly adjusted ENGLISH subs... ... ... and here I was trying to give you a link to subs, but TPB did not allow any of them... so... after 3 attempts, this time *I* can't be bothered. If anyone know which services are allowed, let me know, I'll upload you the subs :)"
,mr.Jbird,2013-03-20T23:29Z,says 16:9 ratio but its not. its cropped. why oh why do they do this so often now? why would anyone want to miss part of the picture?
,JMit,2013-03-21T11:41Z,"Amazing 3D quality. I liked it even more than Avatar, this is a new standard for me.
I had trouble converting DTS to AC3 because of the 4s gap, it only worked with HdBrStreamExtractor. It extracts and converts to AC3 and I just had to remux with mkvtoolnix."
,xtrapeque,2013-03-27T08:05Z,"@MarvTigre ok, I said it because I have boxing at 60 frames, But the explanation of the real and the unreal has convinced me

Thanks"
,SBonesE8,2013-05-04T15:27Z,"so isn't playing normal side by side in say splash player then using tv to  make it 3d worse then using say,powerdvd 12? I heard it was but unsre how?
also powerdvd 12 wont synch the audio correct,me an 4 others have said this.COMEOUT WITH POWER DVD 13!!!
theyre selling it at tigerdirect for $100 whats the holdup?
if power dvd 12 wont work lets get it moving along now or at least recommend another quality player that wont artifact the movie plenty(or at all) an will make it 3d with proper audio please!"
,lagerhose,2013-05-04T18:54Z,why is the file size so large compared to the one from YIFY?
,iam1ofu,2013-05-06T23:13Z,aoloffline! Thanks for the movie!! waited for this for a very long time! I watched in the cinema but in 2D! This 3D version does it justice! 
,lagerhose,2013-05-08T09:45Z,"the one from YIFY is less than 3 GB

this one is 16 GB. WTF?!"
,VigilanceS,2013-05-09T16:19Z,"@lagerhose

Because this torrent actually has a decent Bitrate and won't be fucking shit quality like YIFY.

YIFY is nice if you have a terrible connection or really slow download speed and still want to watch HQ stuff. But just download this and his and compare, you'll either be amazed at the quality difference or if you don't then you're stupid."
