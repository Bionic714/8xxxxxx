Book Description
Everything you need to know about developing hardware-accelerated 3D graphics with WebGL!

As the newest technology for creating 3D graphics on the web, in both games, applications, and on regular websites, WebGL gives web developers the capability to produce eye-popping graphics. This book teaches you how to use WebGL to create stunning cross-platform apps. The book features several detailed examples that show you how to develop 3D graphics with WebGL, including explanations of code snippets that help you understand the why behind the how.

You will also develop a stronger understanding of WebGL development from coverage that:

- Provides a comprehensive overview of WebGL and shows how it relates to other graphics-related technologies
- Addresses important topics such as the WebGL graphics pipeline, 3D transformations, texturing and lighting
- Teaches you how to write vertex shaders and fragment shaders for WebGL
- Includes a lot of useful guidelines, tips, and tricks for WebGL performance optimizations

Professional WebGL Programming is the first book on the market to delve into this fascinating topic and it puts you on your way to mastering the possibilities that exist with WebGL.
