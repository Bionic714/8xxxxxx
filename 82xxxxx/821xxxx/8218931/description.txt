A group of teenagers look to save their town from an invasion of North Korean soldiers.

This Encode has been tested and wont work on Windows Media Player or Quicktime, however it does work on VLC Media Player (http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html)
And Also works using MPC-HC (http://www.codecguide.com/download_kl.htm).
I reccommend using http://thumperdc.com/forum/advanced-video-playback-a-white-paper-t70686.html for best video playback.

Any comments on quality appreciated.
