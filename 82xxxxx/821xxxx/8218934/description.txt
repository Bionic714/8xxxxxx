Matthew Houck has a highly distinctive artistic voice and a refreshing, rolled-sleeves approach to his work. 2007's Pride a spare and haunting work of country, southern gospel and forlorn folk-ish drone first caused ears to swivel in Phosphorescent's direction. He followed it with To Willie, then 2010's Here's To Taking It Easy, an enthusiastic plunge into country rock and rolling Americana. Now, his sixth album Muchacho flashes yet another color in the subtly shifting Phosphorescent spectrum.
