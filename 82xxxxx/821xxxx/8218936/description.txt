 : "A tender and satisfying novel set in a time and a place lost forever,     :
 : Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet gives us a glimpse of the damage   :
 : that is caused by war--not the sweeping damage of the battlefield, but the :
 : cold, cruel damage to the hearts and humanity of individual people.        :
 : Especially relevant in today's world, this is a beautifully written book   :
 : that will make you think. And, more importantly, it will make you feel."   :
