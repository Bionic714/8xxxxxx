The film deals with an individual's ordeal       
in the face of an indifferent establishment.     
It revolves around the payment of an             
electricity bill for a farm pump-set.            
Velu owns a small sugarcane field and has        
immense faith in the establishment, in this      
case, the Electricity Board, to condone a        
delay in payment of his electricity bill.        
But when the power is severed he and his         
wife Sita are devastated. Friends and            
well wishers raise their hands helplessly        
and can only offer suggestions for restoration   
of power. Help comes finally from the most       
unexpected quarters.
