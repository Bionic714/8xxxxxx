,freethought78,2013-03-05T00:29Z,"I agree, the game is worth the $8 that the author wants. Also the author has claimed that if you pre-order you will recieve a steam key once the game releases on steam. It's already been greenlit."

I got the cash, except I dont have a credit card, and there is no other way to buy it in our country. Tough luck for me. So, a decent torrent would be lovely."
,ARGmartin,2013-03-07T05:22Z,"Well im sorry it did work. I found out that in order to solve ""Gnomoria stopped working"" problem at launch you need Microsoft XNA Framework. So go to: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=20914 download and install Microsoft XNA Framework


Cheers thx uploader"
,freethought78,2013-03-07T19:08Z,"Thank you for the additional info, I was not aware that XNA framework was required as I already had it installed. Hopefully your comment will help others who run into the same problem. Thank you for supporting the authors of this software by generating interest through the torrent community."

It's a great way for players to truly try out the game without the limitations of the demo version. I'm thoroughly enjoying v0.8.31 so far. I've always been lazy with too much micromanagement and the latest patch really helps with that! :D "
,freethought78,2013-03-14T05:36Z,"Thanks for purchasing the game, and thanks for recognizing my efforts as well. I've just upped 0.8.31 for the community."
