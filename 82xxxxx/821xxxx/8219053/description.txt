        Kings aren't born; they're made. Method to the Madness of      
        Jerry Lewis takes a contemporary look at a true living         
        legend through in-depth and candid interviews with Jerry       
        Lewis, never-before-seen film footage and contributions        
        from some of Hollywoods biggest names: Alec Baldwin,          
        Chevy Chase, Eddie Murphy, Carl Reiner, Quentin Tarantino      
        and more. Director/Producer Gregg Barson explores the          
        superstar comedian from a fresh perspective. Barson is the     
        only filmmaker to be granted unlimited behind-the-scenes       
        access to Jerry Lewis, resulting in unfiltered reflection      
        on an 80-year career in show business. Plus, travel the        
        world with the ever-vibrant and charismatic man himself as     
        he continues his comedic reign at the ripe, young age of       
        85.-
