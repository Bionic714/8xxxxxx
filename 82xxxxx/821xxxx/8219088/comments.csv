,chrisroberts3,2013-03-04T21:28Z,Will DLC work perfectly with this update? 
,AtraxS16,2013-03-04T23:48Z,"Thank you for this upload.
The patch works OK, but there is a problem with the savegame, I don't have it anymore, I can only start new game...
I have located the savegame in Program Data/Orbit, but don't know where to copy those files. 
Does anyone know?"
,OmniNegro,2013-03-05T01:46Z,"Use common sense and move your saves out of the location you found them, delete that directory entirely, then start the game and make a new save. 

Then just search for the filenames they would have. Once you find one with the right filenames, check the date on them. If they were made just after you saved, they are the correct ones. And you should be able to copy the old saves in and continue playing."
,poririn86,2013-03-05T11:11Z,What previous update do we need? The 1.04 patch only? or all previous updates? from reloaded?
[V],Gh0stNet,2013-03-05T14:15Z,"@chrisroberts3:-

@poririn86:-

,brianxxx,2013-03-05T17:07Z,"For protecting your saves...either back them up manually or use the FREE program GameSave Manager. Google it! 

It will not always detect games correctly because games found here are do not always run like the retail versions...so you might have to do custom add. Easy to use program...but it is still up to up to make sure you are backing up ALL the necessary files. Again...GOOGLE if you don't know."

i unlocked 1.04 and installed 1.05(this one), and my ""pre-unlocked"" saves showed up again, tried starting a new one but sadly no dlc"
,Machine4578,2013-03-05T19:24Z,"i installed this update. cracked it.. reused my uplay_r1_loader.dll from v1.04 with the ""special"" username. and the DLC is STILL PLAYABLE!!!"
,ezloopz,2013-03-05T22:49Z,"thought about that, was worried about missing some ""code"" or whatever from 1.05 if i did.. cheers o/"
,Aesman,2013-03-10T12:36Z,The old save game work with this update????
,Dargonplay,2013-03-13T08:48Z,"Can I install this on Far Cry 3 V1.01 Or I need to download all the others updates in order to install this one?

Or this one pull together all available updates in a super comfortable patch that makes people happy?"
,sunset_rider,2013-03-28T00:26Z,"Absolutely no problem with saved games.
You have to install 1.04 before this though."
