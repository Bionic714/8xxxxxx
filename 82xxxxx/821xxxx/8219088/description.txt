savanna setting. Players will assume the role of protagonist Jason Brody, a
tourist who has been stranded on an island chain in the grips of violent
local conflict for years

Jason has been separated from his girlfriend and, in his search for her, he
will have to deal with a wide cast of mostly unstable characters who have
been on these islands for some time
