[T],Max-Upload,2013-03-04T22:30Z,I'm sorry to say that the pdf version did not convert properly (converter error)and I already uploaded the torrent use the calibre converter in the description to convert the epub or mobi format to pdf. If you feel very strongly against this with enough users asking I will re-up the PDF. Sorry for the inconvenience.
