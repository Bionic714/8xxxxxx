Xsplit has stopen working and shuts down
i am useing windows 8 and the download from xsplit to install"
,cowboy36,2013-03-06T23:06Z,never mind i fig out what i was doing wrong i hadnt copyed the Makahost.dll yet
,deadretreat,2013-03-07T01:36Z,"has a worm in it, keeps trying to connect to amazon ec2 cloud but i have it blocked with peerblock so yea check for yourselves dont trust anything from makahost"
,cowboy36,2013-03-07T06:27Z,can anyone else comferm that there is a worm in this
,katmandu69,2013-03-07T16:13Z,"The MakaHost.dll is a dll that checks for updates on the crack. Basically when the author of the crack updates his crack among with a new version of XSplit, it will check it and ask you for download. No need to worry about."
,ZenoNiQ,2013-03-08T15:46Z,"New crack version available,  it always try to connect amazon cloud 5 port's ..."
,Lightning-kun,2013-03-12T18:22Z,I cannot use the ''Hide from Screen Region'' function on General Settings...
,katmandu69,2013-03-14T00:03Z,"@Lightning-kun I guess you are using Windows 8 ?Hide from Screen Region function does not work, for now, on Windows 8 since aero theme cannot be disabled."
,r3mnants,2013-03-14T23:07Z,"Is there a updated crack for this version that isn't beta? I just updated and this is my version.
1.2.1303.0101"
,ZenRo,2013-03-15T22:27Z,"Thank you very much for the fast upload!
Works very well too!"
,jochaang,2013-03-21T03:49Z,"i can confirm that installation works and the crack also does work along with the premium benefits. my anti virus (norton) didnt catch anything yet, so this torrent is ultimately safe."
,jochaang,2013-03-22T04:37Z,"update: this version has this ""xsplitcore.exe"" error that happens every freaking 10 seconds and is really annoying. not a good version to use"
,jochaang,2013-03-22T05:07Z,"update 2: nvm, the xsplitcore.exe doesnt happen to me anymore, just uninstall and re-install the program + crack, and the prob should be fixed"
,anime_23,2013-03-29T21:09Z,"I'm encountering a problem with this... D:

I've installed XSplit with the included installer, then I copy XSplit.Core.exe and MakaHost.dll, as instructed. I've also uninstalled and re-installed XSplit according to the comments here.

It still didn't work. I'm also on Windows 8, if that could be a problem. Any help? ; - ;"
,P1trs,2013-04-18T17:56Z,"tested only for local recording so far, but seems OK
thx"
,gamewin1,2013-04-21T11:03Z,"i livestreamed with it, and its okay. but sometimes i get an error when i refocus on the program (ie i do something in firefox but then go back to xsplit) and its really annoying. and on 2 occasions, i installed it on friends' computers and they both acted up. (skype and teamviewer would start acting up) but it didnt happen for me. wonder why."
