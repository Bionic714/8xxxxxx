There are not many artists that can unite the beautiful, bare & naked with a burning intensity in the same  fashion that singer/songwriter Sophie Zelmani continues to do. Her debut came in 1995 and throughout the  last 16 years she has consistently released bodies of work that soothe the body and the mind imbedded in a shroud of melancholy and mystery. This Stockholm born singer has with the sparsest means entranced her admirers with music that reaches far under the skin - to a place where each breath can resound with the  power of an earthquake. To make the quiet intense is something that Sophie and long time producer Lars
Halapi have made their signature sound. (sophie-zelmani.com)
