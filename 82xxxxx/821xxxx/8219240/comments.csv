2HD is an amazing group. Show some proof of what you've capped before slamming someone else.  I notice you've uploaded a grand total of ZERO torrents to this site. 

The problem is that Slice doesn't broadcast in HD.  The scene hates non-HD channels. Can't blame them.  It's like 'why bother?'.

,thundercat123,2013-03-05T04:53Z,"quality is poor. I will seed but the quality stinks, not watchable."
,sup1990,2013-03-05T18:32Z,"it's not unwatchable, if you have vlc player change the ratio to 4:3."
,uneedabiscuit,2013-03-05T21:09Z,I didn't upload this to discredit anyone who uploads.. I really only upload shows when they have not been posted a day or two after they aired.. I ended up finding this on Filestube. I know the quality sucks.. but Im all about instant gratification and couldnt wait. LOL
