,Necrosaro,2013-03-05T20:53Z,"Quality is pretty low compared to the first 2.  First 2 appeared to be around HD, this one is standard quality and full screen is almost unwatchable to me."
,Necrosaro,2013-03-06T00:33Z,Quality is low IMO and almost unwatchable compared to the high quality ones posted before.
