,arctictpb,2013-03-05T17:24Z,"@drew1972 - The plan is to post as many GrandAm and CTSCC races as SPEED airs.  As soon as I can review this last race to make sure SPEED has not cut off the feed or preempted it for something else then I will post it.

Glad to see there is at least one other GrandAm fan out there."
