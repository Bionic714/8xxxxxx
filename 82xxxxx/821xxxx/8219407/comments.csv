Seems to be working fine (although I didn't have any projects to do at the moment so can't really fully test it.), but yeah it seems to run and work just fine.
Running it on Win8 x86 and it has a ""Metro"" style first interface.

My Firewall didn't even warn me about it trying to connect to internet at all, so if you've configured it right, you shouldn't have any problems."
,photonquest,2013-03-20T03:52Z,"hey chingliu, i just registered to tell u that while the torrent is good, the serials dont work..

1 - Install using the serial:
801C-2091-6HH9-3512-50KA-1XPU-TUM6-053P

2 - Go to 'Nero ControlCenter'

,FXQC,2013-04-07T20:52Z,"During installation when prompted for serial,  ChingLiu's keys dont work.

@rafa17rocha serial does work..
EXCEPT/BUT
i ended up with a valid Nero v11.0.15600 

All ""Nero Platinum 12.5.01300"" found anywhere else are all ChingLiu's file uploaded by different uploaders.

thx anyway"

Goto 'Nero Control Center'
add serial :
