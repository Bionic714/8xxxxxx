They are watching, they are waiting, they are already here...
Discovery's Compelling, Imaginative, Breakthrough New Series ALIEN MYSTERIES Arrives March 3. 

Discovery Canada and its award-winning international production house, EPI (Exploration Production Inc.) has completed production on the all-new breakthrough CGI series, ALIEN MYSTERIES. Premiering with two back-to-back episodes on Sunday, March 3 at 8 p.m. ET/PT- and backed by a robust multi-platform promotional campaign - the shockingly imaginative original Canadian series candidly chronicles first-person accounts of UFO sightings, alien encounters and abductions. In each episode, dramatic reenactments recount stunning real-life unexplained alien experiences, taking viewers on a thrilling - and sometimes terrifying - journey. Their bizarre, life-altering encounters are vividly depicted using new state-of-the-art CGI and green screen techniques and created by Toronto-based Acme Digital Pictures. As well, each story features scientists and researchers who probe the question - how is this possible?


Discovery's ALIEN MYSTERIES is a fantastically creative and imaginative new take on some of the most enduring UFO mysteries from the last 50 years. Each story is backed up by credible witnesses, investigative reports, and tangible evidence such as physical markings, photographs, radar reports, and videos.
