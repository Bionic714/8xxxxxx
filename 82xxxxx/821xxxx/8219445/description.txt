 : Jayne Anne Phillips's reputation-making debut collection paved the way for :
 : a new generation of writers. Raved about by reviewers and embraced by the  :
 : likes of Raymond Carver, Frank Conroy, Annie Dillard, and Nadine Gordimer, :
 : Black Tickets now stands as a classic.                                     :
 :                                                                            :
 : With an uncanny ability to depict the lives of men and women who rarely    :
 : register in our literature, Phillips writes stories that lay bare their    :
 : suffering and joy. Here are the abused and the abandoned, the violent and  :
 : the passive, the impoverished and the disenfranchised who populate the     :
 : small towns and rural byways of the country. A patron of the arts reserves :
 : his fondest feeling for the one man who wants it least. A stripper, the    :
 : daughter of a witch, escapes from poverty into another kind of violence. A :
 : young girl during the Depression is caught between the love of her crazy   :
 : father and the no less powerful love of her sorrowful mother. These are    :
 : great American stories that have earned a privileged place in our          :
 : literature.                                                                :
