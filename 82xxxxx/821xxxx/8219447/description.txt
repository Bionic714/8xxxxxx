 : ayne Anne Phillips has always been a master of portraiture, both in her    :
 : widely acclaimed novels and in her short fiction. The stories in Fast Lanes:
 : demonstrated the breadth of her talent in a tour de force of voices,       :
 : offering elegantly rendered views into the lives of characters torn between:
 : the liberation of detachment and the desire to connect.                    :
 :                                                                            :
 : Three stories are collected in this edition for the first time: in "Alma," :
 : and adolescent daughter is made the confidante of her lonely mother;       :
 : "Counting" traces the history of a dommed love affair; and "Callie" evokes :
 : memories of the haunting death of a child in 1920's West Virginia. Along   :
 : with the original seven stories from Fast Lanes--each told in extraordinary:
 : first person narratives that have been hailed by critics as virtuoso       :
 : performances--these incandescent portraits offer windows into the lives of :
 : an entire generation of Americans, demonstrating again and again why Jayne :
 : Anne Phillips remains one of our most powerful writers.                    :
