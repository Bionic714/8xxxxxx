And no more vamps for me thank you very much, I've seen enough of those and got bored with them.
I got at least 200 BD-s waiting to be encoded, also Transformers Trilogy and  Star Wars The Clone Wars S1-S4 all 1080p...Deliver Us From Evil 2009,  Hitchcock.2012, Legionnaire (1998) with ENG DTS 5.1, Chasing Mavericks 2012, Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988), The Sweet Hereafter 1997, The Hobbit An Unexpected Journey 2012, Rocky Balboa 2006, On the Waterfront (1954) , Blue Velvet (1986), Away We Go (2009) ......so you see there will be enough to chose from."
