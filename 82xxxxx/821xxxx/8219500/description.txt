Passionately in love from the moment they meet, idealistic chef Yann and single mother Nadia share big dreams for their future as a family. As Yann grows close to Nadia's young son Slimane, he impulsively buys a secluded restaurant in the French countryside, taking on risky loans to help finance the purchase and renovation. When progress on the project stalls and debt begins to accumulate, it strains Nadia and Yann's relationship. With the promise of a job in Montreal, Nadia leaves Paris for Canada, temporarily leaving Slimane in Yann's care while she gets settled. But things don't go as Yann or Nadia planned, and their choices forever bond them together.
