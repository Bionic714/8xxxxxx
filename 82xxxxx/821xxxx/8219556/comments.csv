,Casey96SS,2013-03-06T21:34Z,"Again, totally appreciate the upload! I've listened to this rip a couple of times now. Maybe it's my ears but it seems like this one is missing some low end/bass compared to X and Y. Also the cracking and popping seems pretty noticeable compared to your other rips. Not complaining, just thought you would want the feedback since it seems like your are trying to give people great quality music to listen to. Thanks for your hard work!"
[V],24.96,2013-03-07T05:48Z,Thanks for the feedback I agree some are better than others -- hopefully more good ones than bad! Thanks again!
