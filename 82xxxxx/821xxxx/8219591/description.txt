Season 2 Episode 2 of 8

Mozambique Actor Robson Green journeys to Mozambique to take on some of the African country's best anglers, including Duarte Rato, who has an international reputation for catching huge fish in the tropical waters of the Bazaruto Archipelago. He also challenges a champion fly fisherman who has seven world records to his name, before going up against a professional skipper to land a tigerfish - but the last time Robson tried to hook one, it took him two days. Will luck be on his side this time?
