720p version by the other guy is better than your 1080p by miles."
,johnj1969,2013-05-30T14:24Z,"xidio or is it xidiot? Fair enough his rips dont have proper milth-ch audio,but yify caters for probably 75% of DLers on here with small storage space & who dont let compressed files or 2-ch audio bother them,as long as they are getting good quality S & V as far as they are concerned. I admit i'm not one of them because i have a decent enough set-up. 

But WTF do you think you are telling the guy he sucks along with all his friends here who put time into us getting releases gratis & before any HDTV service or Bluray/DVD copy comes out? If you dint want the DL go & tell your mammy. This place can do with-out the likes of you- Really..."
