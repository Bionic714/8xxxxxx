,AegisFate,2013-03-09T03:32Z,"Ok, I had the problem with ""Failed to Initialize Direct3D with current setting Options"" when pressing Play and the Options in the launcher crashed it. Basically you have to turn off ExclusiveFullScreen. Don't know where there is an option to turn that off in Windows 8. Press the windows key + R to bring up Run and run regedit. So basically, you have to go into the registry under HKEY_CURRENT_USERSoftwareCrystal DynamicsTomb Raider . There, you have to create a subkey under Tomb Raider called Graphics. In Graphics you need to create a DWORD called ExclusiveFullScreen and set it to 0. There will allow to you go pass the Play problem. People have been saying to edit the registry and find such and such values. If you can't get pass the launcher, the game doesn't create any registry values, so there is nothing to edit. After you get pass the launcher and go back to the Tomb Raider registry, you will see a whole bunch of new values there.
I just figured this fix out so bare with me on the instructions if they're not 100% clear.
Post feedback!"

No viruses, installs and runs perfectly. After installation, a browser window is automatically opened that allows a patch to be downloaded as well. You don't HAVE to get it to run the game, but you have that option.

Maybe it can be the greatest competitor for goty

I tried everything from this page http://crashwiki.com/tomb-raider-crashes-blackscreen-restart-options-crash-unpacking-direct3d-crash-graphics-and-textures-glitches/

Nothing. I have installed the last patch(i think is the last) : v1.00.722.3"
,euphoria4949,2013-03-21T15:49Z,"@gtafun - OK, have you run 3D on any other games on that PC???

,gtafun,2013-03-21T16:11Z,"@euphoria4949 - I can play Skyrim with ATI 5570.

No,i don't know if i run the latest Catalyst.

Can i download it for free from somewhere?An how?

My version 3D is : 8.14.10.0708

My version Catalyst is : 2009.1019.2131.36819"
,euphoria4949,2013-03-21T17:36Z,"@gtafun - Ok, well the first thing you should do is download the latest Catalyst drivers from the AMD site, just Google AMD drivers and select your graphics card and operating system.

Secondly, when you say you can play Skyrim, do you mean in 2D or 3D???
Because what I read from that error message ""Failed to initialize 3D with current settings"" was that your card can't handle the game in 3D, i.e. maybe the setting need to be on the lowest possible to be able to run in 3D.
3D puts a massive strain on any card and with the greatest of respect, (I'm not bashing your PC), but the 5570 is a low-end budget card that is more suited to older games that don't require huge amounts of processing.
That's why I was asking if you had run a hugely complex game like Tomb Raider in 3D before on that card.

Again, I'm not slagging off your PC, I'm merely trying to offer realist help and advice."
,gtafun,2013-03-21T19:58Z,"@euphoria4949 - You seem to know a lot of this stuff,mate.Thanks for the advices.No offense (of course.

To be honest,i don't know if i run Skyrim on 2D or 3D.

I just updated my drivers and i can run the game,finally(i didn't play it though,so i can't tell you if i have any problems in the game).

So,if anybody has the same problem as me,just remember to update your drivers.

Thanks,mate,again."

,Pro4208,2013-04-28T04:12Z,"Just wanted to thank the entire @nosTEAM genuinely and completely. This torrent, along with every other torrent I have used from you guys (Deus Ex, Prototype 2, Sleeping Dogs, Mass Effect 3), works flawlessly and is incredibly easy to install. 

Even though it takes a little longer to download than some of the more popular torrents (due to lack of seeders) it is more then worth it. Not having to dick around with installing DLC, blocking shit in firewalls, etc. makes your torrents the best.

Please, keep up the good work!"
,roan1430,2013-05-05T17:54Z,need seeds plz only 100 kbps

Try downloading the update patch off of the nosTEAM website, they nearly always fix these sorts of problems.  If that fails, reinstall (or redownload and reinstall, if necessary) and see if that takes care of it.
Failing those options, I can't offer any advice."
,piratenumber11,2013-05-23T18:25Z,"Could someone, please, help me? I have tried two things: installing according to the instructions, and unraring rar 2, but none of those work. When I click on the shortcut, or the app in the directory, I only get loading on the cursor, but nothing pops out - no loading screen, no error... nothing happens. I tried running as admin. I have no idea what else I can try (I checked my antivirus for quarantine and it is not blocking the game)"
,softbanana,2013-05-28T20:20Z,This will take me foreva'!
,Rickyboy1992,2013-06-05T03:04Z,I just beat this game. It works flawlessly. Multiplayer does NOT work like every other torrent I've downloaded from noSTEAM.  But I only got the game for the SP.
