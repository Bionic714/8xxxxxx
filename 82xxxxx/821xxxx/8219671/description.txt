Tomb Raider is an open world game that combines action-adventure, elements, platforming, exploration, and survival mechanics. 
During a Twitter session with fans, Karl Stewart said that the game's campaign will last between 12 and 15 hours.
Along with the main story, players will have the chance to do multiple side quests, explore the island, revisit places, and search for challenge tombs. 
It has also been confirmed that fire will be a major tool in the game along with a bow and arrow and a gun.
Lara travels on the ship Endurance commanded by Conrad Roth. 
When the ship is struck by a violent storm and split in two, Lara and many other survivors are stranded on an isolated tropical island in the Dragon's Triangle. 
Lara has to find food and water to survive, fighting off the more dangerous animal inhabitants and trying to trace the other survivors. 
But a darker threat awaits as she is forced to harden herself against killing people in order to fight a group of malevolent mercenaries who seek to kill her and her companions.....
