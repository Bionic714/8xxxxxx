,Dudesyeah,2013-03-09T05:02Z,"For some reason Laura croft is invisible and all I can see is her hair. Also, most of the screen is black and the environments are fucked up looking. is there a fix for this? I am running windows 7 with a nvidia gs 7900, 32 bit with four gigs of ram.

I have looked around on the interbutt but have not come up with anything worth value. Please help if you can."

If you research a little harder, you will find out that the game has problems with Nvidia cards.

PS: Recommended settings is already calling for a 4870."
,Gedankenzement,2013-03-13T05:41Z,"This reboot turned out to be a huge disappointment for us old Tomb Raider fans. It's like Far Cry 3 (the constant gore, the upgrade interface, the ""safe points"", the save system, heck even the island setting!) with some acrobatics thrown in to justify the use of the franchise name. Lara looks like a female Rambo with an english accent. The atmosphere and exploration have been replaced by a downright annoying, insanely verbose system of banal ""pickups"" that fail to deliver even a tiny fraction of the satisfaction that secrets in the classic titles delivered. The list of flaws is really long (camera constantly locks during gameplay and is nauseatingly shaky during the cut scenes (another silly misfire of realism, lol), repetitive building architecture, object clutter, etc. On top of all I had a graphics problem with dark polygons on the surface of murky water bodies in-game, while playing with an Intel 4000 IGPU (i5-3570k, Win 8 - tried every possible setting combination).

Uploader, thanks for keeping me from wasting my money on this crappy title."
,osanosan,2013-03-13T15:09Z,"does anyone actually able to make it work? I always get ""session not found"" in joining or creating game."
,_OoO_,2013-03-30T17:32Z,"Working like a charm
looks like a great game

Thank you so much bro"
