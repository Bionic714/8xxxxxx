Thanks for the kinds words!

@ everyone

Please don't hit and run.  I have been seeding this for many many hours, uploading nearly 30GB and there still are only 3 seeders (including me).  CMON PEOPLE PLEASE SEED!  I am about to upload another torrent, so you will be on your own."

,caveoh,2013-05-02T17:04Z,Finally a torrent with seperate subs! I already downloaded the whole series from another torrent and i couldnt play my own subs cause it already had english subs encoded. I hope this will solve my problem! Thank you for your effort and time uploading this!
