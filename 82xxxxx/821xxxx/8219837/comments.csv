,websterphreaky,2013-03-05T19:33Z,"ALL you have to see is who stars in this to see it's a piece of shit (Casper Van Dien, Bryan Head, Keith Meriweather - all losers)

You'd have to be desperate to download this crap."
,piratewithalongpenis,2013-03-05T20:51Z,"i cant believe 10,000 people are downloading this joke of a movie, why don't u go out and get a job instead of wasting your time"
,PHonda,2013-03-05T21:13Z,"I didn't have any intention of downloading this but I had to click just to read the comments, I'll have to check back in a day or two for some saucier stuff.  This movie will obviously suck, it's named '500 MPH STORM' and stars Casper Van Dien lol  Starship Troopers was a long time ago"
,Lewrid,2013-03-05T22:43Z,"Nothing says ""OMG HORRIBLE STORM"" like a clear blue sky in the background 75% of the time."
,markone12,2013-03-05T23:41Z,"I registred , just to tell how a big garbage this movie is..."
,DrugSquad66,2013-03-05T23:42Z,sounds bad enough to be fun. click
,serenitynow77,2013-03-06T00:58Z,Would rather eat shit then watch this fucking thing.
,KaraSakal,2013-03-06T01:33Z,The cover and title are more than enough not to make me want to watch this.

@snusenx
You can see the wire holding up his feet at 1:15:57, and this is the only thing worth watching in this great movie

,flameguster,2013-03-06T08:40Z,To those who think the movie's shit.... try gettin high before u watch it... and its funky as hell!!
,salientone,2013-03-06T08:52Z,"@bazg1973  - Americans are the stupid ones? You clearly were checking out this movie, that's why you commented, in ENGLISH, commented in ENGLISH you bull dyke flit boy..and why did you comment in ENGLISH? I can tell you, because the world doesn't get anywhere speaking your language...and why is that...wait for it...because any knowledge your country has, it gleaned from us back when you were still playing in the dirt. Here's a little secret, Americans don't care if people are anti American because you do not fucking count, I mean you do, but in small ways like we need you to cut our grass, and take out our trash, and do the shit jobs we do not want to do while we drive our fancy cars to our fancy house and skim across the headlines about the sorrows of your countries while getting to the import part of the news like where is the best vacation spot this year...You know what this right? It's the place I take my kids to play, you know, the place where your kids will be working and serving mine. Bet you won't be vacationing here fuck nuts, and why is that? Because you fucktards can't leave....you aren't free men, you are your governments possession, in short, you are someone's bitch. "
,Aceaer,2013-03-06T10:10Z,"@salientone it may not have occurred to you but other places in the world speak English as well, such as the UK for example, home to ""England"" thus the title of the language ""English"". For anyone not from the States reading this guys' comment, we're not all like him."
,village1diot,2013-03-06T10:57Z,"I always laugh when people bash us Americans. Sometimes the bashing is deserved, other times not so much. But whatever, it is what it is.

But then we get people like salientone who get so offended they they make us all look stupid. Please dude, do us fellow Americans a solid and just STFU.

lol @ frickin rednecks."
,rockerforever,2013-03-06T12:49Z,"why dont you upload some better   piratewithalongpenis if you think this is so crap,people might have been working long shift and want to relax with a movie,maybe you with a small penis dont have a job or??"
,CrAAdle,2013-03-06T13:46Z,I'm pretty sure the producer of this movie will commit suicide after reading all these encouraging comments and feedback :) Rest in peace my friend.
,sagesagesage,2013-03-06T14:44Z,"Terrible poster artwork - check
Retarded movie title - check
Casper Van Dien - check

Yep it's a huge pile of shit."
,jameskrueger2nd,2013-03-06T16:10Z,"More wire at 1:16:10 and 1:16:13 wire holding his chest

This is the most funny part of his comment. Since USA isn't even 250 years old. I lol'd."
,serenitynow77,2013-03-07T00:04Z,@sallentone you are a dead shit. Your little rant about english is hilarious and does nothing more than show everyone how fucking stupid you really are.
,omfgigod,2013-03-07T03:50Z,Yeah as soon as i saw Casper i decided against it.

,Jack_Reacher,2013-03-07T05:49Z,"@bazg1973 ...  Wow, you're not very bright are you?  Sort of like ""the porch lights on but nobody's home"", type of stupid.  

Where you from anyway?  Fucking Ethiopia?

Thanks Scene!"
,wtfname,2013-03-07T07:00Z,"Question:  Do you really think they spent the entire $300,000 budget on this film or did they use the money to buy beer?  My guess is they were all Drunk!"
,macey75,2013-03-07T09:17Z,Who IS Casper Van Dien??? Never even heard of the dude.
,BBQSource,2013-03-07T13:58Z,"@crAAdle What are you kidding, the director has been coked out of his head since he started filming the thing, he's probably out on the street offering rimjobs for a 600mph storm sequel.

@salientone; If you just kept your mouth shut you wouldn't sound like a deranged mongoloid who knows nothing about his own history and placement in the world."
