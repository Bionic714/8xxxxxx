School is over and summer has begun in the dead-end seaside
town of Rainmouth. While Jamie's friends seem to be happy
working in the local pie factory by day and looking for sex
by night, Jamie is bored out of his mind, running his
pot-head mother's B&B. He's desperate to get out of there.
But when he meets beautiful, smart and sexy American traveler
Juliana at a party, he's smitten - the world is not so small
after all. But soon after Juliana's arrival, strange things
start happening. One of the local teens goes missing at a
party. Then, another. Jamie is warned by an enigmatic stranger
that a werewolf is in town - and preying solely on virgin flesh!
The only way to be safe seems to be to pop your cherry.
(But that can't be true... can it?) As the locals are picked off
one by one, the boys fear that a werewolf is indeed after them.
And for all their talk, it turns out none of them have ever had
sex before... Pretty soon, everyone is dying to get laid.
