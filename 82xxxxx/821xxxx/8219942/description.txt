In 1959, Alfred Hitchcock and his wife, Alma, are at the top of their creative game as filmmakers amid disquieting insinuations about it being time to retire. To recapture his youthâ™s artistic daring, Alfred decides his next film will adapt the lurid horror novel, Psycho, over everyoneâ™s misgivings. Unfortunately, as Alfred self-finances and labors on this film, Alma finally loses patience with his roving eye and controlling habits with his actresses. When an ambitious friend lures her to collaborate on a work of their own, the resulting marital tension colors Alfredâ™s work even as the novelâ™s inspiration haunts his dreams.
