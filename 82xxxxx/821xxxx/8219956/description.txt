School is over and summer has begun in the dead-end seaside town of Rainmouth. While Jamieâ™s friends seem to be happy working in the local pie factory by day and looking for sex by night, Jamie is bored out of his mind, running his pot-head motherâ™s B&B. Heâ™s desperate to get out of there. But when he meets beautiful, smart and sexy American traveler Juliana at a party, heâ™s smitten – the world is not so small after all. But soon after Julianaâ™s arrival, strange things start happening. One of the local teens goes missing at a party. Then, another. Jamie is warned by an enigmatic stranger that a werewolf is in town – and preying solely on virgin flesh! The only way to be safe seems to be to pop your cherry. (But that canâ™t be true… can it?) As the locals are picked off one by one, the boys fear that a werewolf is indeed after them. And for all their talk, it turns out none of them have ever had sex before… Pretty soon, everyone is dying to get laid.
