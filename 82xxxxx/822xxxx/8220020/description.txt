"Hush Hush"

Carrie is thrilled when the junior-senior lock-in 
provides the perfect cover for a night out in 
Manhattan with Larissa and her Interview 
co-workers - until a surprising encounter turns 
her night upside down. Maggie and Mouse confront 
Sebastian about his feelings for Carrie and tell 
him he better make a grand gesture if he stands 
any chance of winning her back. Harlan finally 
convinces Tom to go on a double date, with 
surprising results. Meanwhile, Maggie tries to 
find the courage to tell Walt about Simon before 
Donna LaDonna does.

Evolve... or die.

Enjoy :)
