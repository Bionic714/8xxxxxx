...and of course, there is a request:  I'm looking for the 20-issue 1975-78 ""Batman Family"" Giants, and haven't come across them.  Many thanks, and many more if you can possibly find the 'Family'."

[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-05T14:23Z,"riverchase, you're welcome.

that story in which magneto killed zaladane was uncanny x-men #275, near the end of the chris claremont & jim lee run. (that's the turning point where mags became a villain again, in time for the x-men #1 issue the following year.)

#275 is collected in the trade ""x-men: crossroads"", which coincidentally i posted last month as part of: http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8093837/"
