,Straydog1st,2013-03-17T14:15Z,"Two weeks after installation on Win7, the patch stopped working the licence expired and became useless. On XP still works OK."
,Straydog1st,2013-03-17T14:44Z,"I downloaded this on the first day, installed and worked OK, but for two days now the patch is not effective, back to trial and expired subscription. Uninstalled with Revo, cleaned the registry and reinstalled. No way. Will search for another torrent. This is on Win7. I have another installation on XP and it still works. I had Avast 7 on Win7 before for a long time with the same patcg and never had a problem."

,POGMOHON,2013-05-27T15:08Z,"larnportyx,
I did all that, buy when i got to the pasting of the crack it would not allow me, it said i didn't have permission or that the disc was full?
I don't know???"
,POGMOHON,2013-05-27T15:10Z,"larnportyx,
usually when i replace something with a crack, i have to remove the original one first, if you know what i mean.
Should i remove something?"
,lamportyx,2013-05-29T13:57Z,the crack does not replace anything!just follow the instruction.
,POGMOHON,2013-05-30T01:36Z,"Hi larnportyx,
Finally got there, pasted the crack, re started and clicked the XP add on, but still at trial stage, 25 days to go.
Any suggestions?"
