,Xandror,2013-03-13T23:11Z,"This has 2 copies of the film running at the same  time divided left and right, IE its unwatchable garbage. You can crop it but then it will be a nice square for you. Go elsewhere for a watchable copy"
,thedustyfox,2013-03-15T00:19Z,"@Xandror - you need a 3D-compatible monitor/TV to watchh this movie, it will interlace the two images into one, nothing wrong with the torrent."
