Notorious criminal Pasha (Amrish Puri) has been sent to jail by the former inspector general of Police Shrikanth Mathur (Shammi Kapoor). An enraged Pasha decides to get even with Shrikanth and hence asks his trusted protégé Jackie (Jackie Shroff) to carry out a plan to get him released from the prison. As directed, Jackie abducts Shrikanth's daughter Radha (Meenakshi Shashadri) in the garb of a police officer. Radha is made to believe that Jackie and his gang of goons are her protectors and are keeping her in the jungle for her safety as her house has been taken over by bandits. As the days passed, Jackie gets increasingly drawn towards Radha and eventually both fall in love with each other. Radha discovers about Jackie's truth but still stays by his side. She even makes Jackie surrender which leads him to spend two years in jail. Radha meanwhile returns to her home and narrates about her love to her brother Damodar (Sanjeev Kumar). Thwarted plans of his release makes Pasha angry and he vows to take revenge from Srikanth and Jackie. Will Jackie and Radha meet? Will their love be accepted by all? What will Pasha do to extract his revenge?
