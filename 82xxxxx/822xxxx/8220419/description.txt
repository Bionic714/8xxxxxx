We started the Book of James with a straightforward and powerful call to ΓÇ£be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger.ΓÇ¥ We were challenged to actively pursue listening instead of being focused on speaking, looking at the connection between listening and anger. We ended looking at Jesus and were reminded that we are crucified with Christ (Galatians 2:20) and that our call is to daily take up our cross and follow Him (Mark 8:34; cf. Luke 9:23).
