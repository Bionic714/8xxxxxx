[V],dhjudasx,2013-03-05T07:51Z,I've uploaded over 20gb of this movie already ... and no one is bothering to continue seeding :( (mind you I had it uploading over the entire weekend starting Friday morning through kat initially upped there. Most cases only seems people at TPB keep seeding for me.
,Han_GooN,2013-03-06T10:33Z,Thanks dhjudasx... great 1080p rips!! yeah i'm 1 of your fans...  i download almost your rips... only the dark knight rises have a little issue... but it's not about the quality of the scenes.. it's bout the audio... it's only stereo.. the other rips works with 5.1 channel..sorry if out of topic..

Can you run a force recheck on that movie..

I personally have played it back on 3 different surround sound units and it 2 channel stereo and the 5.1 surround both work flawlessly for me. A few people i know that have gotten it have also stated the 5.1 work fine. No differently than my previous encodes.

I'm curious as to why all of them would work for you but that one in perticular."
,Han_GooN,2013-03-09T17:23Z,"hahaha... yeahhh... me either... all harry potter, batman begins, the dark knight, all transformers, LOTR trilogy etc from your rips works flawless!!

i already downloaded from other bdrip uploader for the dark knight rises for the comparison.. and the 5.1 channel works... so i'm guessing the problem it's not from my player..

fyi.. i'm just a user and i dont understand about ripping movies... 

and i'm using media player classic for watching movies... it's that the problem?

last but not least... thanks for your reply.."

You could get VLC a run and see if it still exhibits the same symptoms.... ?"
