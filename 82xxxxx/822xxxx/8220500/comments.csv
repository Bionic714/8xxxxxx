,Antonio2763,2013-03-06T01:48Z,thank you
[V],psspss,2013-03-06T03:46Z,"depends what mode you use. and soft
some make better use of the cores then others
also some can use the cores in video cards as well

I do single pass constant bit rates for 1008bits if do 2 pass you can expect to double the time 
dont want to get TNE started up again do we
about always using 2 pass 
afg does constant quality hence why most of the time theirs is 100mb bigger

i7 laptop.. desktops are said to stlll be faster though dont know"
