Documentary looking at the life and work of soul and pop diva Dusty Springfield, singer of such classics as You Don't Have to Say 
You Love Me and Son of a Preacher Man who was equally famous for her trademark panda eyes and blonde beehive.

Using archive footage and interviews shot in the UK and the US, it charts her progress from plain Catholic schoolgirl to 
glamorous star and ventures behind the extravagant image to reveal a complex and vulnerable character. 

The programme features interviews with fellow musicians from a career spanning four decades including Elton John,
 Burt Bacharach, Neil Tennant, Lulu and Martha Reeves.

Dusty's protective inner circle of friends have never spoken about her on camera before.
 Dusty's personal secretary for her entire solo career, Pat Rhodes, her manager Vicky Wickham, 
ardent fan-turned-backing singer Simon Bell and others talk about the highs and lows of the woman they knew and loved.
