Since people on the Penny-Arcade forums kept asking for this (and the links toetc expired), here is a torrent of the complete archive of "Downloadable Content, The Penny-Arcade Podcast".

It was a podcast where Gabe & Tycho (Mike & Jerry) basically just turned on a microphone and recorded the process of creating some of their Penny-Arcade comics; and is full of untold hilarity. It lasted from 2006-2009, and died when they started filming Penny-Arcade: The Series. The archive got broken on their site when they redid their site a few years back and removed from iTunes around the same time; hence the torrent.

It contains 40 MP3 episodes of varying audio quality and length, but generally run ~20-40 min. All are hilarious.

I had uploaded this toand they expired, but was asked to upload it again on the forums. The mods and Penny-Arcade themselves seemed to ignore or not care that I had re-uploaded it, so I assume this to be okay. But as a PA fan, I will take it down if they ask me to.

Enjoy!
