,WasAtWoodstock,2013-03-11T04:03Z,"When this happens, generally it means that the uploader made some minor edit to one of the folder files after the torrent file was created.

This torrent cannot be fixed. The only thing that nicklas can do is to create a new torrent and upload that.

Now most of this torrent is good. As a last resort one could grab the flac file, which is good. (And also back.jpg and scan0002.jpg.)

After a new torrent is upped, one does not need to download all of it again!! After the new torrent is up, one should delete the torrent, but not delete the data. The new torrent will see the old data. It will check it. And it will then complete in a minute or two."
,kenncomm,2013-03-13T04:02Z,To niklas; standing by for fix...TNX! To WAW; nice bit of info...who'dathunk they(torrents) are so finicky......great album btw.
,nicklas1212,2013-03-17T17:17Z,"i reupload the torrent for those of you who werent able to complete to 100%
