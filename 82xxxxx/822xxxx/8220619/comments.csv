,osquu_94,2013-03-07T15:53Z,I'm stuck at 77% and so is also every other peer; don't download! 100% is not available and therefore this is a waste of time

,Levaka,2013-03-09T07:30Z,"Pff... Downloaded it and seeding as much as I can, but I really disappointed. I've installed disc 2, inserted disc 1 and waited for new cars pack. But there is NO NEW CARS! It seems that is usual forza 4...
Someone who downloaded it, if you find new cars, please, tell where they are."
