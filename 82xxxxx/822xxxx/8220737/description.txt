SEED PLEASE!


Hear the sigh, a silent song
A moment of calm before the storm
My heart so violently beats along
Leading me to want to end it all
I weep, for the dream in a grave 
The one that made all lips go blue
I read the words on torn down walls
Reminding me how much I loved you
I weep, for the dream in a grave 
The one that made all lips go blue
I leave bleeding yet another day
The one that made all lips go blue
It's all for you
It's all for you
Weep, for the dream in a grave 
The one that made all lips go blue
I leave bleeding yet another day
The one that made all lips go blue
It's all for you
