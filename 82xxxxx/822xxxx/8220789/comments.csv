The last couple weeks all of u regular uploaders have been repeating this pattern of putting up many multiple copies of the exact same x264 and then waiting a day or two or three until anyone bothers putting up xvid.

,GohanHD,2013-03-06T04:38Z,Use VLC player to play the videos the program does not use much overhead so even on real old machines they should play fine.
