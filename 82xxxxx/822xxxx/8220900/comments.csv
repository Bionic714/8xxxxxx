My bandwidth is quite slow and barely good enough for the initial upload so im counting on you guys to continue supllying the masses. It is very nice to see 3 week old shows download at top speeds, barely taking a couple of minutes to finish. Kudos to all of you seeders - you do the grunt work

I was on the leeching end of these c2c shows here on tpb for years and i've picked up the torch for now. Its a tiny effort for each of us to maintain a lasting free archive of the greatest radio show on earth :) I'll supply it from the honeyhole and with a bit of initiative we could have monthly and yearly packs created. Hint hint someone make these packs pls "
