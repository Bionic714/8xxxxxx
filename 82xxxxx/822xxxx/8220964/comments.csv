The wheels came off last Tuesday, thought a couple days downtime ... became ""maybe Sunday"" and now, I honestly don't know. Lotsa sob stories not to bother you with - but I miss this, I miss all of you.

Hope to be back soon, meanwhile messages from the universe tell me flow with it and recharge (wait for soldering iron, t6 & drive board for the drive that has ALL that I've posted - long story).

Possibly one of you whom I've been double daring to step up might for a bit?
