Ep 16: The Real Housewives of Paris, Part Deux

PREMIERE: Monday March 4, 8:00 pm

The women explore Paris: jogging by the Seine, shopping on the Champs Elysee, and visiting Notre Dame cathedral. But when Kim is late for a cooking class, they fear something terrible has happened. Kim is irritated by Lisa's possibly faux concern and encourages Kyle to confront Lisa about their troubled friendship -- which she does, on top of the Eiffel Tower.
