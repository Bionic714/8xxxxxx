 : Thirty years have passed since eleven-year-old Paul Tracy watched his      :

 : winners emerged. Now the news that his father is dying brings the memory of:
 : that day flooding back. Deciding that it's time to face up to what really  :
 : happened on that baseball field in 1973, father and son make their way to  :
 : Calico Rock, Arkansas, where either redemption or rejection awaits them.   :
