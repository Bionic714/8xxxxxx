,Dimmis80,2013-03-05T13:10Z,Good day friend Gondy.Nice game dude.Btw i wrote the other day about any news or info on game or games that u found on Chicago Bulls-Michael Jordan but u did not answer like u always do.I don't get to be pushy and i thought that u were busy or something but i have to ask again did u find any.?Btw that game with Michael against the cavaliers it was so awesome i just want now more.Ok the today players like Lebron-Durand or Mello rules and i enjoy your games but Michael is above them and i just want his games in my collection if u can find.??And the quality was very good..

I'm sorry if I didn't respond to you message before, maybe I didn't see it. Yeah, I found some classic games of Bulls and I'll do my best to post them here. Really, I don't reply much on the message here in TPB as I am more active at KAT (sorry, I didn;t meant to spam here).

Cheers fellas.. :D"
