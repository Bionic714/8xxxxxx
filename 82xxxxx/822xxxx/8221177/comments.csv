,Moonlit_Wolves,2013-03-05T12:29Z,"What do you mean with:

Sound Language (Russian)

Am I unable to change it to English?


I'm confused because above that line you write:
Language: Russian / English (selectable in the game settings!)

So then how is this exactly?

Sorry, for the question, I'm just unsure.."
,Azila,2013-03-05T13:32Z,"Moonlit_Wolves @ when u setup ..u will see three button ""Cancel"" ""Option"" ""Next"" ...click next to change language u want to use ...that all"
,Moonlit_Wolves,2013-03-05T13:46Z,@Azila Thanks :) Then it should be no problem. Loading it now :)

,Azila,2013-03-05T14:52Z,this full mp+sp ..just rip some language except eng-rus only ..
,scudamour,2013-03-05T16:58Z,"Ok, I've installed it and it loads up fine. But the audio language is in Russian. The only thing you can change is the language of the subtitles.

So I don't know what Azila is referring to when he says ""click next to change language u want to use"". I don't see that option anywhere. 

So just to be certain, is there any way to change the audio language to English? Or is this solely for Russians?"
,darkcobrabws,2013-03-05T17:21Z,"Ok i might just be stupid but when i start the setup i get 3 buttons with gibberish and they act like

""Next"" ""Quit"" ""Flip the tomb raider image and display more gibberish"""
,darkcobrabws,2013-03-05T17:24Z,It never asks me for language either before installing
,scudamour,2013-03-05T18:07Z,I'm getting this one instead: http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8220175/Tomb_Raider_SE_2013_DLC_RePack_MULTi13-z10yded
,Moonlit_Wolves,2013-03-05T19:08Z,"ATTENTION: This ""REPACK"" is only in Russian...

The only English is the writing in the menu and the subtitles."
,Moonlit_Wolves,2013-03-05T19:19Z,"ATTENTION #2

I've fixed it so that the game is in English.

If you want to play the game in English, then all you must do is delete the following 2 files from the installation directory.

1. bigfile_RUSSIAN.000.tiger
2. title_RUSSIAN.000.tiger

Once you remove them and start a new game, it should be in English. At least for me the opening cinematic is in English. However I don't know if these will lead to any crashes, it does work like this though.

Please give me feedback if this works. Thanks!"

,ScrubLife,2013-03-05T22:45Z,"Russian audio only.
Tried removing files as Moonlit suggested, but it only leads to a crash.
No setting in the launcher or setup. And in-game is text changes only.
Either get another release or hope someone uploads language files"
,EniXBlaze,2013-03-06T08:56Z,"I think I figured out how to get this torrent's audio work in English. Just install the game first then:
1/ Get this torrent: 
https://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8218890/Tomb_Raider_SURVIVAL_EDITION_STEAM_FULL_UNLOCKED

2/ Only download the following files:
bigfile_ENGLISH.000.tiger
patch_ENGLISH.000.tiger
title_ENGLISH.000.tiger

3/ Move the following files in INSTALLED game's folder to another location for backing up purpose:
bigfile_RUSSIAN.000.tiger
patch_RUSSIAN.000.tiger
title_RUSSIAN.000.tiger

4/ Put the newly downloaded files (ones with ""ENGLISH"" in their name) to the installed game's folder.

I'll report soon if this works."
