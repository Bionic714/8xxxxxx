Joginder Pal kills a police constable, and Mr. Saxena becomes the only eye-witness to this murder. He comes forward to testify and as a result Joginder gets arrested and charged with murder. Joginder's father Mr. Pal is Saxena's best friend and pleads with Saxena to change his witness statement, but Saxena refuses to do so, and as a result Pal's son gets convicted and sentenced to death. Pal swears to avenge his son's death and destroy Saxena's family. Years later, Saxena's sons, Ramesh (Shashi Kapoor) and Suresh (Kiran Kumar), have grown up. While Suresh, the younger son, is serious, studious, and business-minded, Ramesh is the opposite. Pal's son, Prem (Narendra Nath), befriends Suresh and gets him addicted to the world of girls, drugs and alcohol. He falls in love with one of the girl's and wants to get married to her. Ramesh and his parents oppose this and Ramesh even threatens to kill the girl. Shortly afterwards, the girl gets killed, and a drug-induced Suresh immediately believes Ramesh to have commited the murder. In rage, Suresh abducts Ramesh's to-be bride, Sheetal Batra (Rinku Jaiswal). Now both brothers must fight each other until only one is left standing; much to the delight of Pal who orchestrated the entire treachery . Will the Saxena family survive the devious plan of Pal?
