,kevinkhor,2013-03-06T05:56Z,Would recommend waiting for patch before downloading. Game is glitchy and stops story progression

,kronik123,2013-03-08T07:12Z,"Hey guys, for those who are having problems with the game locking up and sending you to your desktop, Under OPTIONS select the ADVANCED tab, and untick ""Tesselation"" especially NVIDIA users. Game plays great all the way through..."
,kronik123,2013-03-08T07:14Z,NVIDIA released a statement saying the game co. didn't release the code to them so they had no time to address the issue. Hope this works for you...
,lili9000c,2013-03-09T13:06Z,"I get ""AppId is not configured"" does anyone know how to solve it?"
,MIKUFY,2013-05-17T18:12Z,"I cleared the whole game and it works fine without problems. Im pretty new to this so may I ask a question @Cr@cker ,- It is possible to play this online? My game just say ""cannot connect the tomb raider servers"". Or would the game ""find out"" its cracked?"
