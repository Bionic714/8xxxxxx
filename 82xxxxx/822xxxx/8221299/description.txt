This was a request by Byowulf25.

This is a talkie version of Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge
with the original VGA graphics. Sound is compressed in the OGG 
format.The files were compiled from the Special Edition with 
this tool:

You need ScummVM to run this game.

WHAT IS SCUMMVM?

ScummVM is a program which allows you to run certain classic 
graphical point-and-click adventure games, provided you already 
have their data files. The clever part about this: ScummVM just 
replaces the executables shipped with the games, allowing you to 
play them on systems for which they were never designed.

If you don't already have ScummVM, visit
 
http://scummvm.org/downloads/

to find the correct version for your device/system. 

INSTALLATION:

Just extract MI2_Ultimate_Talkie_Edition.zip anywhere you want, 
add the extracted folder in ScummVm and start the game.
