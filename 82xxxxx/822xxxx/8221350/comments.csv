The movie exploits the holocaust in order to garner sympathy for Israel.

It further seeks to justify Israeli crimes against the indigenous people of Palestine.

By creating an implied connection between Arabs and terrorism, this movie seeks to absolve Israel of all responsibility while garnering sympathies for Israel, despite the fact the Israeli government itself has withheld money from holocaust survivors, many of whom live below poverty line in Israel."""
