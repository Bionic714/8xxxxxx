ALERT! YOUR PC PRIVACY IS AT RISK
Did you know that Windows maintains an ΓÇ£unseenΓÇ¥ history of all of your PC activities, including files you have opened, websites visited, e-mails sent, logins and passwords, etc? It is important to understand that even having taken steps to ΓÇ£deleteΓÇ¥ files, cookies, search terms, browser history, etc., your data and activity remains on your PC ΓÇ£unseen. This leaves a history of all of your PC activity available to anyone who may currently have or someday gain access to your computer, be it family, employer, colleague, legal, PC maintenance, shared network, wireless network, or hacker sources. In addition, when you are on the Internet, you may have downloaded intrusive devices such as cookies, bugs, and spyware onto your computer. The intrusive devices may strike at any time. These problems raise not just privacy concerns but serious security issues as well. 

ACT NOW! PROTECT YOUR PC PRIVACY 
To truly erase this information off of the hard drive requires a deeper professional ΓÇ£cleaningΓÇ¥ of your computer that is provided by History Sweeper software. History Sweeper is very simple and quick to use, and can provide you with the peace-of-mind of knowing that your personal activity and information will remain private and protected.
