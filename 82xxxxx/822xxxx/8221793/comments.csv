,MAA11792,2013-03-05T15:57Z,Thank you. However there are still no performance enhancements. Bloody console-port.
,THANGDL,2013-03-06T02:34Z,Thank so much!!!
,KevinZOMG,2013-03-13T20:55Z,Will this work if I have a legal version on Uplay? Basically just update without having to use the crack?
,SteaminWillieBeamen,2013-03-16T04:32Z,I let the game auto update itself all the way to 1.05 and just used the crack in this folder and it worked out great! Thanks 4 da upload brah!
,soultwig,2013-03-19T03:15Z,do you need all of the updates or just v1.94?
,soultwig,2013-03-19T03:16Z,v1.04*
,MaximilianKohler,2013-03-23T18:30Z,@soultwig you shouldn't need any previous updates. The latest ones usually contain all previous ones.
,kainada,2013-03-29T11:33Z,"When I attempt to install the update it tells me that it could not retrieve the version number and that installation will be aborted.

Anyone else had this issue?"
,ask1997,2013-04-02T03:16Z,installs automatically to steam fake foler in c help !! can't even install previous updates
,ryumartin,2013-04-05T05:19Z,"I'm not sure about there need previous updates. But I have already install patch 1.02, 1.04 (RELOADED)  and 1.05 eventually.

The game worked fine now. Thanks for upload."
,420dopemaster,2013-04-07T02:08Z,@MAA Far Cry 3 was a good port and runs well. If you're having performance problems it's because your pc is rubbish.
,GObonzo,2013-04-10T15:14Z,"game runs great, just have gotten audio pops and blanks every so often. only game out of 150+ that it happens with. no reply from ubicraps"
,Sam_Raimi,2013-05-07T19:56Z,"I've tried every update, patch available.
I'm running only @ 14-24 fps on LOW settings, 1024x600 Full Screen,,,everything turned off and dx9.
I have an ENVY 17.5""-3090NR 3D, my bios is up to date as well as AMD CCC v13.4 / TriDef 3D Ignition 3.6.23.....
This is pathetically written software to run like this on a new lappy with top specs,,,
I should get easy 60 FPS on 2D and 24-35 on 3D.
I can't get more than 24 MAX, 17 Average from this game.
Fucking ubisoft, french mother fuckers, shitty software writers.
The English should of put all your ass's back on a boat and set you packin back to France, or killed each and every one of you.
Go stick your dicks in some poutine.,,,,,"
,aremic,2013-05-12T23:17Z,"Can someone please help me or tell me if you have a similar problem.
 I can't change the difficulty!? After this patch and the ""Ziggy's Mod"" (if you haven't tried that mod go to the far cry 3 nexxus, its great), the gameplay options are too far down the screen and cut-off. The last option I can get to is the one that resets the outposts and it's so far off screen I can only see the yips of the letters.
 The fucking game changed the difficulty on me when I killed myself to start something over and now I CAN NOT for the life of me put it back to warrior difficulty.
 I tried windowed mode and lower resolutions in the off chance that it might show the rest. And the slider bar moves but still everything's cut off."
,aremic,2013-05-14T19:43Z,If anyone has the same problem I've found a solution. Use the arrow keys to navigate down to the difficulty option. You still can't see whats selected but a pop up on the left will tell you you're on the right option. Use the right arrow key to raise the difficulty and the left to lower it.
,MrTTAO,2013-05-28T12:54Z,"The instructions are wrong, previous update and previous cracks are NOT required."
