Florida alt-rock outfit Go Radio (featuring former Mayday Parade singer Jason Lancaster) make their driving full-length debut on Lucky Street. Working with producer Tim OΓÇÖHeir, who worked with All-American Rejects and Say Anything, the band follows the mold of those groups, fusing a pop-punk influence into its guitar-heavy sound, adding a sense of urgency to the music without sacrificing melody. The result is a kind of plaintive alt-rock thatΓÇÖs able to be uptempo without necessarily being upbeat, giving the album enough drive to grab listeners' attention and enough emotional weight to keep them interested. With hard rocking jams like ΓÇ£Kill the BeastΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£Fight, Fight (Reach for the Sky)ΓÇ¥ in Go Radio's repertoire, Lucky Street definitely makes for a promising debut from the Tallahassee quartet, and will definitely be of interest to fans of LancasterΓÇÖs from his Mayday Parade days.
