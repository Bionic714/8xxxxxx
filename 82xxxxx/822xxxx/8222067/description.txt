Whats New In v 4.20 ?
**********************************************************************************
general compression algorithm is optimized for better
utilization of several processor cores. While some speed gain

is possible even in single processor mode, best results

are achieved in multi-core environment.

**********************************************************************************
Speed gain depends on data type and average file size.

Several cores are utilized more efficiently when compressing

large files.

b) we had to increase memory requirements to achieve higher

compression speed. General RAR compression algorithm allocates

about 120 MB comparing to 40 MB in WinRAR 4.11;

c) RAR text compression algorithm cannot utilize several CPU cores

efficiently, so its performance in multiprocessor environment

is much lower than for general algorithm. Also its decompression

speed is much lower than in general algorithm regardless of

CPU number. So we decided to disable the text algorithm by default.

***********************************************************************************
If you need maximum possible compression ratio for plain text data

regardless of speed, you can enable the text compression

in "Advanced compression parameter" dialog. Press "Compression..."

button on "Advanced" page of archiving dialog to access it.

You can also change this option permanently in default compression

profile;

********************************************************************************* 
Fastest" (-m1) compression mode also supports several processor

cores now. In 4.11 it could use only a single processor core.

RAR general decompression algorithm speed is slightly improved,

though not to same extent as RAR compression. RAR decompression

is not able to use several processor cores, so its performance

does not depend on a number of cores.
*********************************************************************************
Changes in ZIP compression:
**********************************************************************************
now ZIP compression supports several processor cores resulting

in noticeably higher performance in multi-core environment.

Single CPU ZIP compression is also faster than in 4.11;
memory use for ZIP compression is increased to about 15 MB.
