,fear_09,2013-04-08T11:41Z,"I downloaded all the 720p HDTV episodes of House Of Cards you've uploaded so far, and all of them are working flawless except this one. I'm using Media Player Classic with the Combined Community Codec Pack. When i open this episode, it gives me nothing but a black image throughout the entire episode.
Any help would be appreciated."
