i believe the reason so few ppl leave a comment is that you have to sign in to the site to do this
I've been downloading so far without doing that and this is the first time I've commented 
I've wanted to comment but never registered before now.. 

Is there some way the site could allow ppl to leave a note of thanks without going to the trouble of registering?"

Anyway thanks for this upload and your efforts."
