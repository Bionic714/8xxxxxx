My first NBA game my father took me too the Cow Palace where we watched Wilt give the finger to the crowd for booing him. A few minutes later they went nuts when he dunked from the foul line.

 Now I am confined and can't even get a game on tv because of ridiculous  black out policies.  No kidding, I live 50 miles from Oakland and not a single game is televised here. Have I mentioned they r sold out every night last 10 years.
So thanks for real ."

,Bmack7263,2013-03-07T09:37Z,"Nepotu, thank you for  the kind words.  Another story. I went to see my first baseball games at seals stadium. The old PCL. league. in the early to mid 50's we would sneak into the stadium by distracting the ticket taker. located on 16th and Bryant. Hills Brother had a big processing plant right behind the 3rd base seats. the stadium only seated about 15,000,they were all great but uncomfortable seats. I watched Stan Musial play in a exhibition game in about 55. He roped a triple in right center. He was faster than we thought. maybe the most elegant player I ever saw. watching Musial for free with the powerful fresh smell of  coffee being roasted across the street on a cool day one spring. can  you  imagine ?
Hey Napotu, my friend don't forget my GSwarriors, I am counting on you. Smooth sailing pirate dude!"
