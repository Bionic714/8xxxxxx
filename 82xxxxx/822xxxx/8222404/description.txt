Gal Costa is blessed with a voice that at once soothes, energizes and pleases in a lyrically tuneful way. It's no wonder she is so popular. This recording is a collection of lovely and lush songs, a perfect accompaniment for a sunny Sunday or to brighten up a cloudy morning. Even on the faster, brassier numbers like the first cut, E Luxo So, Costa massages you with her breathy seductiveness. Perhaps not as brilliant as the great samba masters, this is nonetheless a prize of a recording that my wife and I have enjoyed many times, while sipping coffee and reading magazines, etc. It never fails to please, even after repeated listening. An excellent purchase.
