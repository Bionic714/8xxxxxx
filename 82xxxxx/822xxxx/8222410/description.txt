Understanding the physical properties of foods is important as they are used in process design, product and process optimization, product development, food quality control and food process modeling.

This book provides a fundamental understanding of physical properties of foods. Basic definitions and principles of physical properties are discussed as well as the importance of physical properties in the food industry and measurement methods. In addition, recent studies in physical properties area are summarized.

The material presented is helpful for students to understand the relationship between physical and functional properties of raw, semi-finished, and processed food in order to obtain products with desired shelf-life and quality. Each chapter provides examples and problems, which teach students to analyze experimental data to generate practical information. In addition, the material in the book may be of interest to people who are working in the field of Food Science, Food Technology, Biological Systems Engineering, Food Process Engineering, or Agricultural Engineering. The book also can be used as a reference by graduate students and researchers who deal with physical properties.
