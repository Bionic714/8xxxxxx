And Robot.and.Frank.2012.LIMITED.720p.BluRay.X264-AMIABLE would be nice too!"
,rcoldks,2013-03-09T10:46Z,Sorry I meant The.Intouchables.2011.720p.BluRay.x264-NODLABS.

,rcoldks,2013-03-10T14:11Z,It's actually because of the hardsubs.
[V],GoodFilms,2013-03-10T22:47Z,There is already a version without subtitles.
