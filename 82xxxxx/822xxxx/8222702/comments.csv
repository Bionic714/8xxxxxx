,FrancoHarris,2013-03-09T16:39Z,"Thanks Zen Bud and Anoxmous for another great one! 
I'm pretty sure this is the director's cut. In otherwords the long version? 
People will want to know because there's a lot of controversy. Not everyone likes the newer, longer version."
,beedog11,2013-04-17T11:54Z,Thanks!
,scooterboobie,2013-05-21T23:35Z,"This version is approx 2 hours and 2 minutes long in spite what the description says!!
When played in VLC the total time is shown as 4 hours 8 minutes, but after 2h2m the film does end, which ruined the film for me completely, as I didn´t expect it to end so soon. This is the shortest cut version there is, and by far the worst. Go for the 167 minutes version!"

Did you read this above yours comment!

""Not everyone likes the newer, longer version.""

I am one :)"
,anoXmous,2013-05-27T08:15Z,"@scooterboobie 
But you are right the info is wrong it is the 124 min (cut theatrical) "
