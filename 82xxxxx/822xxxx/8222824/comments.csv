,gulisa,2013-03-05T20:26Z,all god damm leechers should be fukin banned
,lalikcz,2013-03-05T21:44Z,Seed :((
,phat_71,2013-03-05T22:20Z,"What kind of idiots are you to complain about the number of leechers the first day it`s released? A leecher is any person currently downloading, meaning anyone with less than 100%, meaning just about fucking near everyone until some of us start having the full file and are able to seed. It`s normal that on day 1 there are practically no seeds..."
,nklh4x0r,2013-03-06T00:15Z,Is this survival edition?
,OmarKH,2013-03-06T07:36Z,"Can I install language packs on this one, just like the skidrow version?
And does it save?"
,garfieldfofinho3,2013-03-06T15:47Z,"hey namoski 
the page of the tomb raider multiplayer patch is not showing up 
Not Found (aka 404)"
,vicki_v,2013-03-06T20:45Z,"the ratio for seeders to lechers right now is fucking 1:6... the dloading is so bloody slow never goes more than 10 kb/s... and that is very pissing off!!! :-(

any way thanQ for the torrent blackbox... i have dloaded a lot of ur torrents... thanQ :-)"

,DarkIceCreAm,2013-03-07T00:00Z,"Does not work,runntime error another shity realase from ghost he shoud lose the skull"
,Raydensdaddy,2013-03-07T00:32Z,Just had to comment after I saw dude said it doesn't work.  It works perfectly you don't even have to crack this.  It's running beautifully even on my Radeon HD 7770 on ultra settings.  Game is gorgeous and haven't had a problem yet at around now 3-4 hours gameplay.
,Raydensdaddy,2013-03-07T00:36Z,I think this might be the best looking game I've seen yet aside from Crysis 3.  Turn V-Sync on triple buffering with ultra settings it run's great.  Yes you can save the game and I think it might be survival edition because when you first start the game you have to click ok for around 20 fking notifications about unlocked content.  Another beautiful release from Black Box!  Great game I will probably buy for multiplayer.
,Raydensdaddy,2013-03-07T00:39Z,:D
,DarkIceCreAm,2013-03-07T02:05Z,"I can be nice-looking,but this realase is still broken and DO NOT WORK"

,Razielnapo,2013-03-11T17:38Z,"Anyone mind enlightening me why this torrent is 3 Gb smaller than the Skidrow release? I just am hesitant in downloading the smaller file in case smth is missing.I'm not worrying about it not working,but i'd hate missing some of the components"
,redwall64,2013-03-12T14:50Z,"I need help. Everything runs pretty smoothly when I run it (except during the loading screens when it gets weird, but it also gets past it so idc), but I get stuck after the opening scene.. actually, during: I get stuck at the part where Lara just fell into the water.. : Any ideas? Could this just be a problem with my computer?"

,jakedilla,2013-03-25T22:03Z,i really wish people would explain in the description what they removed/compressed to make the game so much smaller... guess it'll just be a mystery
,meerMSA,2013-03-30T04:06Z,Hey blackbox can u upload sniper ghost warrior 2 rip version....
,genocide44,2013-03-31T08:58Z,seed dont hit and run
,cgt0412,2013-04-01T08:51Z,Works flawlesly.. Thanx
,thefearmaster,2013-04-13T05:34Z,"nothing is removed guys XDD blackbox are known to compress the files so its much smaller than the original downloads like : ""tptb"" and ""skullptura"" 
i tried other downloads they uploaded and they're legit and working 
-mafia 2 
-hitman absolution
-tomb raider
-resident evil 6
and all of them work fine without even a single problem"
,SentientWatermelon,2013-04-13T21:14Z,"@Razielnapo
That's just Blackbox for you.Their compression is always 30-50% smaller than other popular torrents with the same content."
,Criminai,2013-04-18T21:36Z,"It works for me, but it does something very strange every now and then usually before a cutscene. My screen flickers a bunch of jibberish for about 5-10 seconds and then it gos away. It's hard to explain but that's the jist of it.. Other than that, the game runs fine. I recommend not using tressfx though. I5 3570 @ 4.2 Ghz and Nvidia gtx 660 ti."
,nerohero,2013-04-28T03:59Z,"Great torrent, Gh0stNet! The game runs great most of the time, but every now and then there is a small bug, such as part of the menu staying on the screen for a few seconds after closing it but I've only encountered that twice in two hours of game play. Also, I can't play the game for more than 30 minutes to an hour at a time because the game freezes up and shuts down, which isn't a HUGE problem because I can just restart from the checkpoint.
