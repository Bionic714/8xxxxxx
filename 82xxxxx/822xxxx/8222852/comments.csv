,culatr,2013-03-05T23:58Z,"@clasicom - I'm assuming you can read, because you can type (or you had someone type you're dumb ass question for you) so how about you click the imdb link and figure it out for yourself....Lazy fuck"
,paul36,2013-03-06T02:41Z,"@culatr hey hey hey. The IMDB link isn't linking correctly. You can't expect people to actually do a search on that website, can you? LOL"

,DrMD,2013-03-07T10:40Z,"Within the first frame, you'll see what a waste of time this crap is but by then you will have already downloaded it, so unless you like very bad, well they're all very bad, the ""let's film our nightmares, ghost stories, and camping trips"" type movies stay away from this."

,killermany,2013-03-07T14:01Z,the worst horror movie ever so don't waste your time as a lost mine  ;(
,salazam1,2013-03-08T00:46Z,"This movie had some decent character development, but it went nowhere with it. Story sucked ballsaks full of ballsaks. Monster picks them off one by one, predictable as shit. Watch the trailer you've missed nothing.
