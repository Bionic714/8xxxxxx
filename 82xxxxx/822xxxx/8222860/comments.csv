[H],LemonJ-Lo,2013-03-06T17:42Z,"I downloaded and read through parts of it.  I stand by my original comment.  The author explicitly states her method does not cure genital herpes, which is indeed (at present) an incurable virus infection.

What her methods do is simply suppress the external symptoms of the disease.  The infected person is *still* infected, *still* contagious, and will *still* spread the disease to unsuspecting partners, who will no longer be able to observe any signs that the carrier is giving them the disease."
