From Wikipedia:

The Batman Family was a DC Comics comic book series which ran from 1975 to 1978, primarily featuring stories starring supporting characters in the Batman comics. The term is often used to refer to the extended cast of characters of comics books associated with Batman.

The Batman Family title ran 20 from 1975 to 1978 and featured solo and team-up stories starring Batgirl and Robin. The series additionally featured reprints of Golden Age and Silver Age stories. Many issues of Batman Family featured Batman supporting characters such as Alfred, Vicki Vale, the Elongated Man, Man-Bat, the Huntress, and Ace the Bat-Hound. Writer Bob Rozakis introduced the Duela Dent character in issue #6 (July-August 1976) and revived the original Batwoman in issue #10 (March-April 1977). Batman Family converted to the Dollar Comics format with issue #17 (April-May 1978).

DC published several other "Family" titles concurrent with Batman Family. These included Superman Family (1974-82), Super-Team Family (1975-1978) and Tarzan Family (1975-76). All of DC's "Family" titles contained mostly reprints, and featured a higher page count (and higher price) than a normal series. Batman Family's final issue, #20, ran with no advertisements.

Merger with Detective Comics

In 1978, after the DC Implosion, it was decided that DC Comics' long-running flagship title Detective Comics was to be terminated with #480. However, the decision was overturned following strenuous arguments on behalf of saving the title within the DC office. Despite being the better selling title, Batman Family was instead folded into Detective, converting that book into a $1 68-page giant as of Detective #481 (Dec. 1978/Jan. 1979). This arrangement lasted 15 issues. With issue #496 (November 1980) Detective reverted to its traditional size and price -- thus effectively canceling Batman Family for good.
