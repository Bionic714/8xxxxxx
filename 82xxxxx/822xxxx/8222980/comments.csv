,hotslized,2013-03-06T09:32Z,"Yify rips always the best!,ty yifs."
,XuelsJenk,2013-03-06T14:30Z,"Damn leechers, everyone is stuck at 72.4%, if your gonna download at least stick around and seed so other people who are willing to seed can do it,"
,mike953100,2013-03-06T21:30Z,"@libertycity

You're telling me haha.  Video really is fine with all YIFY movies as x264 works miracles.  If he just added higher quality to the audio; even 2.0 @128Kbps would be fine and only add 10's of MB of size, but he/she is a bit too stubborn I guess."

,HKCannibal,2013-03-07T05:35Z,"They are complaining about the bitrate of audio and video, all releases are YIFY downsized as much as possible, or think it's pure magic that bluray is a file of this size, and also for this reason that people make their downloads, good quality (nothing exceptional), and a small size.
There are several releases that work with higher quality, I will not quote them here, and whoever falls for a file with bitrate higher rates, either by having a qualified sound system, or any other reason."
,ToneZone,2013-03-07T07:26Z,Cinavia protected?
,teenigma,2013-03-08T09:21Z,Thanks :)

,rajusahrauniyar,2013-03-09T17:13Z,All Nepalese pray for Yify !!!
,BD175,2013-03-10T00:08Z,"YIFY releases are rubbish, they can't do audio and haven't learned there is more than stereo available."
,joser116,2013-03-10T15:40Z,Audio totally sucks. Worse than DVD. A few extra MBs wouldnt hurt YIFI. Thank you though for brigning all those movies to us though.
,joser116,2013-03-10T15:41Z,"Everyone wants a higher quality audio and a lot of people want a higher bitrate/better video quality. A few extra MBs wouldnt hurt. Yes, you have a whole bunch of movies, but its QUALITY over quantity."
,susulock,2013-03-11T00:26Z,"What the FUCK is wrong with you YIFY?  Why did you remove the audio for the 2nd half of the end credits?

And still fucking 96kbps audio. Alexandre Desplat will spit on your grave."

pretty good movie overall"
,jbetts042,2013-03-13T05:31Z,"i love how people complain about something that they aren't paying for anyways. If you want DVD or BR quality it's very simple get your ass to the store and buy it!!! And none of these files would even be available if people like this didn't take their time to encode and upload them.  Thanks for all your uploads, much appreciated!!"
,Woesaka,2013-03-13T17:39Z,"Quality sucks a lot at the end, when everthing is dark. You can count the pixels... 

A: 9/10
V: 4/10 (because the end)
M: 10/10

,Dramat,2013-03-13T18:37Z,"...another propaganda product from propaganda factory - Hollywood. 9/11 was an inside-job to justify never-ending ""war-on-terror- which is base to give a way peoples freedoms and rights. Another False Flag operation enforced with all US propaganda machine. Pity people fall for it like a flies for shit..."
,pritytony,2013-03-15T08:18Z,TO YIFY ....... THANK YOU FOR ALL YOU DO HERE IM A SICK BROKE MAN WHO GETS TO ENJOY THE LITTLE THING IN LIFE BECAUSE OF YOU ......also i dont post any comments but you my friend deserve appreciation a/10 v/10 as usual !!
,osriccc,2013-03-15T18:03Z,Dudes at YIFI... start making a little bigger copies. These ones look like upscaled DVD rips. You can take former HD Lite's releases as example.

,death007,2013-03-18T03:28Z,"YIFY, i appreciate your effort but, you should not post the dimensions of the video like RESOLUTION...................: 1920*1040 for example, when they are indeed not that resolutio. You can not count the black bars on top and bottom of screen for widescreen as part of the picture.  I have a galaxy s3 phone i watch movies at work on it, 720p and up videos fill my screen completely, but your videos always have the black bars on top and bottom making picture very small, not the dimensions you claim."
,CLVSSIC,2013-03-20T12:40Z,YIFY da gawd :)
,jstrov,2013-03-21T01:57Z,When I look for a new movie that has just recently been released on dvd on the bay i look for your name first because i know the quality work you do and always enjoy your rips thank you.

,Brahj,2013-03-23T16:17Z,"mynameismickael he has been burned alive, we located his ip in a remote cabin in the Catskills, boxes of kiddie pron all over made it hard to find him in a compartment in the floor the led down to a cellar.  We burned him alive in the cabin and deleted his comment."
,Brahj,2013-03-23T16:18Z,"Deleted his comment from his soul that is, baptized by fire."
,MFINN23,2013-03-23T16:26Z,@mynameismickael Why are you so mad that someone wants to stop oppression?  :D  Gotta love the mindless drones that hates anyone who wants Israel to stop their war crimes.
,Brahj,2013-03-23T17:45Z,ISRAELI PSYTRANCE 4EVER!  BURN THE GOVERNMENT AND ISRAELI RELIGION BUT DON'T TOUCH THEIR PSY TRANCE OR LSD & MDMA LABS!
,zgrillo2004,2013-03-24T01:45Z,Does this have the Cinavia protection? because I want to play this on my bluray system via USB
,zgrillo2004,2013-03-25T21:06Z,"@shomonex Take your fucking virus site somewhere else, shitstain!"
,vampzcore,2013-03-31T19:37Z,thanks!!
,Sanyi001,2013-04-05T03:36Z,"Confirmed, it does indeed have Cinavia protections. Thanks anyway"
,xandao2,2013-04-15T06:27Z,"Thans, the movie is... FANTASTIC......"
,LukeBongwater,2013-04-19T03:00Z,Yify.... I just want a say thank you for alll your work... I lost a ton of stuff to a external HD faliure and you have been my savior man. 
,stijr,2013-04-27T15:32Z,U my man are the limit of awesome!
,cris12821,2013-05-18T23:30Z,"Every video I've ever got from Yify, Has never been a let down,   there all good quality and good audio.      If it aint Yify... that Ill wait untill it  is.     

Keep up the good work,  we all love  you"
,diabollos_666,2013-05-25T05:19Z,"This isn't true 1080p, the definition is of a lower quality than 1080p. I have a few true 1080p movies and they are around 8gb a piece and they look glorious, you can count the actors pores on their faces. It's watchable but it isn't high-def like stated. I have downloaded several of this YIFY's movies, and they are all poor quality. I will never download another one of his movies again. If you want true HD movies, exclude any of these YIFY rips from your choices because they look terrible, on every one I have downloaded I can see pixels and the resolution is only slightly better than an SD DVD rip."
