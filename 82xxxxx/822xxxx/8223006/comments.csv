,nickweta,2013-04-05T06:29Z,Fake as fuck. Go die.
,nickweta,2013-04-05T06:33Z,Nvm Avast was being dumb. It works.
,nickweta,2013-04-05T06:39Z,"Nevermind, there still seems to be a virus as the keygen will not run even in sandbox"
,sahallaba,2013-04-06T10:01Z,"Nothing wrong with the keygen (CORE keygen). I have used CORE keygens for years without virus infection. Some antivirus is just to paranoid. Anyway, Try the serials I listed "
,JetWhoreBattlefield,2013-04-16T07:03Z,"Good speed and software thank you sahallaba

keygen is suspicious but you can use key provided by the uploader in the description.

and i also blocked mathtype in firewall to prevent cd key confirmation"
,molteriet,2013-04-20T03:13Z,"Thanks sahallaba!

I am currently having a problem with the MT Extra font because i apparently have an older version installed. Some of the MathType symbols are therefore unavailable to me. 
When i open the fonts directory, i cannot find the older version in order to remove it, and when i try to reinstall it (/program files/MathType/Fonts/TrueType), it says that it is already installed and asks if I want to replace the existing version. I press yes, the font installs but the issue remains. Does anyone have any ideas?"
