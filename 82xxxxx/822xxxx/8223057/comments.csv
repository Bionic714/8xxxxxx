,lunatyk16,2013-03-10T16:16Z,"I have big problem with game. I download a game, but now I cant save this !!! And when I go to main menu i have only ""new game"" option, I cant continue my  play !!!  "
,NickNs991,2013-03-12T19:25Z,"Quad Core or Dual core it doesn't matter - installation still stucks on TombRaider.exe at 18.342KB.
Here is solution: 
1. Unrar game from Installer.exe(KaOs folder),and wait cmd to stuck at TombRaider.exe 
2.Download FreeArc 
3.Close KaOs installer,go to installation folder,and open KaOs1.arc using FreeArc.You will find TombRaider.exe - First,delete old TombRaider.exe from KaOs installer,and extract ""new"" TombRaider.exe from FreeArc 
4.Download Skidrow crack,and extract Steamclient.dll,steam_api.dll and SKIDROW.ini to installation folder.(otherwise game won't start)
5.Start TombRaider.exe (you'll have to click ""OK"" dozen of times to move download content when game loads,but it's ok,there's no crash).Enjoy."
,NickNs991,2013-03-12T19:50Z,"Ok,it seems that my last comment didn't proceeded,so i'll try to explain it shorther:Start KaOs installation and wait until cmd stuck at TombRaider.exe.Download FreeArc,then close KaOs installation,delete existing TombRaider.exe,then open KaOs1.arc with FreeArc,you will find TombRaider.exe - extract it to installation folder.Then search for Skidrow crack,and extract Steamclient.dll,steam_api.dll and Skidrow.ini to installation folder,otherwise game won't start because of missing files.That's it."

,sujeet26,2013-04-07T12:01Z,"for me ,it's also stuck at tombraider.exe (19mb) .after waiting 2 hrs it still stuck at that.so ,i closed it down and found extracted tombraider.exe is 17.9 mb only.
@NickNs991 
there is no  KaOs1.arc file in tombraider folder .it is in format of kas-tombrSEK.r01 & kas-tombrSEK.rar.
using freearc ,kas-tombrSEK.r01 contains *.pak files only."
,sujeet26,2013-04-07T14:19Z,"ok after stopping  the extraction in between ,i got the i found KaOs1 file and extracted TombRaider.exe ,steam_api.dll ,steam_3dm.ini ,3DMGame.ini ,Steamclient.dll files back to tomb raider folder.
the game has started for now."
,RadKiddo69,2013-04-07T20:21Z,"I have the same problem as @lunatyk16, I started a game, and after the autosave icon went away, I exited the game, re opened it and the continue option is not working. Any suggestions?"
,sujeet26,2013-04-07T20:44Z,"i also suffered the problem of save game bug.but i solved it after trying so much.
1.download this update ""Tomb.Raider.v1.0.722.3.Update-SKIDROW""
2.backup save game (only save*.dat ) from ""C:Users***AppDataLocalSKIDROW203160Storage""
3.delete the storage folder and also unckecked  the read-only and compressed properties of skidrow folder
4 .install the update 
5.run tombraider and close it
6. move back your save file to storage folder

now continue button works and i can resume my save game and also menu shows extra water splash effect."
,RadKiddo69,2013-04-10T03:56Z,"@Sujeet26, I followed your instructions but the continue button is still not accessible. Has anyone else found a solution?"
