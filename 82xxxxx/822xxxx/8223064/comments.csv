,ScorpioPirate,2013-03-08T16:49Z,"Hi guy's :)
Just run the: gja.utility.apk 
it's the apk file to Android install, sorry for the misunderstanding to read the info here :) "
,whitelist,2013-03-30T18:13Z,"Hi ScorpioPirate,

gja.utility.apk is iGO Primo utility. It does NOT install iGO Primo app. This utility is usefull only when iGO Primo is installed.

But how to install iGO if no other apk file is included in this package except that utility?"
,aklekot,2013-04-19T15:36Z,"You're right, whitelist.
There is no proper apk file so no way to install.
Thanks for afford, Scorpiopirate, but this upload is uselles. "
