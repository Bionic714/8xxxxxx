1. Loyalty To The King
2. Chin Up, George Bailey
3. No One Is An Only Child

As far as I know, these are the last songs Horizontal Orange ever recorded. At least, it's the last thing they ever released before disbanding.

I've also uploaded the music by their side-projects. Just search "The Opal Shore" and "Here I Am Send Me".
