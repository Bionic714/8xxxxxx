Five mismatched teenagers are stuck with each other for the day when they are forced to spend Saturday at school on detention. Gradually, though, unlikely friendships form. John Hughes' seminal high school comedy set the template for a number of 1980s teen movies, while Simple Minds scored a huge hit with their theme song, 'Don't You Forget About Me'.
