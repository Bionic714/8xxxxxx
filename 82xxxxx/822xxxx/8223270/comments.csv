,glintings,2013-03-05T23:31Z,Any idea if this is the real deal?
[V],Nepotu,2013-03-05T23:39Z,"Yes, is real deal."
,piratechief,2013-03-05T23:43Z,@glintings - Of fucking course it is. This is Nepotu we're talking about. He's a fucking great!
,glintings,2013-03-05T23:54Z,"Ok, so pressing stream in uTorrent shows me video of Xabi Alonso and di Maria warming up before the match.

I think we're good lads!"
,glintings,2013-03-05T23:55Z,"Sorry guys, didn't mean to offend. 

Cheers Nepotu!"
[V],Nepotu,2013-03-06T00:10Z,"Thank you, piratechief, my good friend! No problem, glintings. Cheers to both of you!
This torrent is in russian. I put another one in italian/intershum, 1080i. If you want to, I can upload a 720p russian version."
,monty.fb,2013-03-06T00:16Z,Please upload english version as well. Cheers!
[V],Nepotu,2013-03-06T00:44Z,"It takes too long to create my own torrent (for the english version), because I have a shitty bandwidth. I'll try if no one will do it"
