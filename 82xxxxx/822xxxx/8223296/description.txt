In January 1972 a newly formed grassroots band The Flatlanders (comprised of the nucleus of Joe Ely, Jimmie Dale Gilmore and Butch Hancock) travelled to Tommy Allsup s Odessa, TX studio at the urging of a local radio DJ. The 14 songs recorded on reel-to-reel tape arguably marked the birth of alternative country music. In celebration of their 40th anniversary together, the esteemed founding fathers of Americana will release a collection of these recordings as The Odessa Tapes via New West Records.

Thought lost for nearly 4 decades, The Odessa Tapes pristine recordings capture without any polish the special blend of country, folk, roots and cosmic energy The Flatlanders pioneered. A DVD featuring a candid new interview with The Flatlanders discussing the myths of the early days of their career and booklet with unreleased archival photos will round out this deluxe package.
