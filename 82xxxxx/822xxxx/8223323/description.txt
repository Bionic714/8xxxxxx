Here it is, the second and final part of my MajesticCasual torrent.
Part 1 included these are now all the songs on the channel released
up until the day of upload. Like last time, all songs were ripped
on highest quality, after which they were converted to 256kbps.
Due to errors, dupes n stuff, you can count on, at most, 10 songs
missing in all, which isn't too bad for the 620-ish songs in total.

As always, have fun with the torrent, and if you like it, SEED!
