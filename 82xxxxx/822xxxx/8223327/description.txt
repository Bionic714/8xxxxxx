 : When Mitch McDeere signed on with Bendini, Lambert & Locke of Memphis, he  :
 : thought that he and his beautiful wife, Abby, were on their way. The firm  :
 : leased him a BMW, paid off his school loans, arranged a mortgage, and hired:

 : Ray--doing fifteen years in a Tennessee jail--already knew: You never get  :
 : nothing for nothing. Now the FBI has the lowdown on Mitch's firm and needs :
 : his help. Mitch is caught between a rock and a hard place, with no         :
 : choice--if he wants to live.                                               :
