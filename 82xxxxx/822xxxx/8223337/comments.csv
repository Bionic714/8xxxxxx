,dandalis,2013-03-06T00:14Z,is MP ripped ? cuz i dont need that shit and its waste of HDD space.
,Taliyuna,2013-03-06T00:28Z,"this is pirate bay how can you even ask about mutliplayer! 
and its not shit the multiplayer is great if you play with friends"
,barabusignasius,2013-03-06T07:48Z,"@ Taliyuna....They were asking if multiplayer was removed (ripped) because being that this IS the Pirate Bay multiplayer usually can't be accessed therefore it is a waste of bandwidth and drive space.  This is what RIP means in torrent land. It means something has been removed from the files to save space, usually languages other than english and multiplayer."
,baroku,2013-03-06T10:35Z,"Is it multi language? If not, can I just simply download my language files and add it here, or I need pure SKIDROW-version?"
,flapane,2013-03-06T10:56Z,They could have bothered writing what stuff has been ripped... 
,dandalis,2013-03-06T13:10Z,"@Taliyuna multiplayer in this game is terrible, i wouldnt even play it if i had a legit copy of the game."
,Taliyuna,2013-03-06T16:30Z,"I apologize guys we just tried the game it IS horrible ....
single player only pirate bay FTW !!! "
,barabusignasius,2013-03-06T17:42Z,@ Taliyuna...You're a moron.  
,barabusignasius,2013-03-06T17:48Z,@ flapane.....The torrent doesn't claim to be a rip.  Probably just a repack.  
,Cyph3r19,2013-03-07T02:25Z,"According to 300mblinks comments section, this repack includes the MP but has the languages removed.

Thanks and cheers upper."

,alphageko,2013-05-02T07:05Z,Guys BlackBox takes games and repacks them in a smaller file than anyone else. The games are also pre-cracked so you install and play. that's just how cool those guys are.
