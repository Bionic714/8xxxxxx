,HooK_43,2013-03-12T03:24Z,@TorDigger..... i first tried the portable one from the bay and it didnt seem right so i did yours and im getting the same numbers on the issues i skipped the defrag and on the spyware and malware i have 252 issues so after the scan i hit optimize and its now been working on spyware and malware for over 2 hours.....is this normal cause it was taking a long time on the portable version and it doesnt seem right to be taking this long to fix and on the portable and this one as it was scanning my antivirus pulled up 2 threats but did not quarentine them and they are coming from OPENVPN witch i have not installed yet cause i dont understand how to use it yet 
,chop007,2013-03-21T20:16Z,"Naa bro, nothing wrong, this A.S.O is a piece of crap, it takes forever to complete fixes. Used to be good but now I just use either Tuneup Util or Advanced System Care. The best used to be System Mechanic but nobody can crack it anymore I guess."
[V],HighCode,2013-04-04T10:52Z,"Thanks TorrDigger, I got an issue though, Eset deleted some files from TMP file while ASO was scaning see the picture >  http://i.imgbox.com/adbdrxeu.jpg
What is this supposed to mean?"
[V],HighCode,2013-04-05T09:07Z,"Anyway, it seems chop007 was right, this program is indeed useless,  it kept scanning for over 24 hours then the ""Skip Step"" doesn't work, program freezed lol. It's probably the worst program I ever came across with. I got win 7 64 with 4x i7 processors 16 GB ram and I haven't got too many files on C: drive.
Thanks TorDigger."

,scythe06,2013-04-20T02:33Z,"Great torrent, but this program is an utter piece of shit. If you have an OS you got from the bay don't download this. Actually no one should download this."
