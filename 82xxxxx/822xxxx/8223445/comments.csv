,Ritesh9,2013-03-25T01:59Z,"Thanks for upload. After installing this, Programs and Features displays ""SQL Server 2012"". It does not show the word Service Pack 1 or SP1 and windows update shows an update SP1 for SQL Server 2012 (KB2674319). Please, tell me where is the SP 1 in this iso?"
,rpgmaker,2013-04-29T23:28Z,"As Ritesh said, when you first execute the installer an overlay dialogue appears that has ""SQL Server Service Pack 1"" on it but when the wizard starts it informs you of an ONLINE update (the sp1) to SQL Server, I didn't install it in order to see if this had the SP1 integrated as it seems to suggest. Needles to say, after you install this there isn't any indication of it having the SP1 installed, in fact, the offer of installing the sp1 update (through a download) by the wizard seems to suggest that this doesn't have such update integrated. The OP should clarify this, in the mean time I'm going to suggest to download this torrent instead: http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7087475/Microsoft.SQL.Server.2012.Enterprise-KOPiE

Other than this torrent is good, it doesn't need a serial but the extra 1.5gb is cause of concern if we can't say it has the SP1. What is taking all that extra space?"
