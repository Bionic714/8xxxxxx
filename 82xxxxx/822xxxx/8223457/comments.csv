From the DLC FAQ:

When Can I Play the Citadel DLC?

You can play the Citadel DLC any time after stopping the Cerberus coup attempt on the Citadel and before beginning your attack on Cronos Station.

Should I Have Everything Else in the Game Done Before Playing Citadel?

There is no right or wrong time to play the Citadel DLC, once it’s unlocked. If you play the Citadel DLC with everything else unlocked (just before attacking Cronos Station), the new DLC content will all be unlocked. If you play the Citadel DLC right after stopping the Cerberus coup attempt, the DLC content will unlock naturally over the course of the main game.

Does the Citadel DLC Affect the Ending?

No, not beyond the possibility of adding new war assets to increase your Galactic Readiness score. You may of course continue on to play the endgame after completing the Citadel DLC, but there is also a natural “stopping point” that should make it clear where the DLC content ends and your return to the main game begins."
,MirandaAI,2013-03-06T11:51Z,"I'm getting the ""missing binkw32.dll"" error after trying to start the game. Any help?"
,NASH_BPRD,2013-03-06T12:21Z,"Ok I can't seem to get this to work. And I  know it's just me being blind.

,rcoldks,2013-03-06T12:47Z,"Guess the comments don't like some characters.

,agyagasztal,2013-03-06T14:09Z,"For those who unable to launch, mind that the default install directory might not be where you installed the game. For example: I have ME3 in Program Files/EA/Mass Effect 3/ while this DLC/update will default install to Program Files/Mass Effect 3/
Make sure you install it where your game is!"
,agyagasztal,2013-03-06T14:18Z,"Took me 3 re-installs of the game to realize it installed this into a different folder ':I thus messing up the registry, thus causing it not to run.

,rcoldks,2013-03-06T17:41Z,"@afrazium, I have a similar question if someone can please help. What is the installation order for all the ME3 RELOADED releases?

Mass.Effect.3-RELOADED - main game, including From Ashes DLC
Mass.Effect.3.DLC.Unlocker-RELOADED - to unlock the already included From Ashes DLC
Mass.Effect.3.Extended.Cut.DLC-RELOADED - extra ending stuff and revised Effective Military Strength minimum
Mass.Effect.3.Leviathan.DLC-RELOADED
Mass.Effect.3.Omega.DLC-RELOADED

How do the updates Mass.Effect.3.Update.v1.2.5427.16-RELOADED and Mass.Effect.3.Update.v1.03.5427.46-RELOADED and Mass.Effect.Update.v1.04.5427.111-RELOADED figure into this? Are they still required when this release apparently includes the 1.05 update?

Is the DLC Unlocker still required or will any update do the same job? 

I've read a ton of comments on this site including some appreciated installation guides, but none really explain how to easily install the whole package."

,Smislov,2013-03-07T16:01Z,"Quessir

First delete,reinstal,this DLC. If you use crack from this image then you must use a old crack again. You must be sure about instalation of this DLC,chose right directorium and in that dir you will copy new crack after instalation of DLC. You probably installed in the wrong folder and then you copied the crack to the wrong place. Now is a little tricky to get back to the old state of things, but not impossible. Uninstall DLC,not game,and use crack to rigth place,bin,win32...and there you will find exe file ."

,94TwinTurboZ,2013-03-10T08:52Z,"OK PEOPLE I HAVE THE SOLUTION. 
The main thing is the installation directory. For me it was d/games/masseffect3 when you install it, if you click on masseffect3 as the final part of the installation directory it wont work. The installation process creates its own folder called Mass Effect 3, so in a sense you have to install it one folder up. You should be prompted to continue from a screen that says ""you already have a folder called Mass Effect 3. Do you wish to install in there  anyway"" or something similar. You say yes. Then apply the crack into the binaries/win32.. So for me I installed the game into D:games/MassEffect3 so then I would install the DLC into just D:games NOT D:games/Mass Effect 3. "

,DCKK,2013-03-13T17:38Z,"For those having problems:
1 - check if you installed it in the correct location, for example you can install this anywhere you want, after that cut the contents and paste it where it belongs, it might be easier this way because by installing you do not know which is the main directory, i for example tought this had only the dlc folder, instead this has content up to the mass effect folder, so install this somewhere where you can look and explore.

2 - Remove the patches dlcs included in this torrent, i have no idea who made this torrent, but making it citadel + patches is a huge mistake, especially when the patches can cause trouble.
Go to Mass Effect 3BIOGameDLC and change name/delete the folders ""DLC_UPD_Patch01"" and ""DLC_UPD_Patch02""

3 - do not use the craked version of the exe in here, after deleting those 2 folders you will be able to use older exes, Google for an exe that works

--------------

Next time you upload a dlc for the game, do not attach patch updates if they are not necessary, do not put an exe that gives more problems then the ones it solves and do not make an installer to something that ain't necessary.
You need ONLY 2 folders, one for the dlc and another for the metadata.
No patches, no exes and no installers are necessary.

The most recent updates (patches and exes) causes several problems to players, namely broken romance scenes and ashley bugged power.
Can cause also crashes ingame when using certain interfaces.

By using this exe and removing those freaking patch dlc files you will be able to experience ALL the content in mass effect without the bugs introduced later on.

Happy gameplay."

3) ONLY COPY THESE FOLDERS --- CookedPCConsole + DLC --- Copy these into the BIOgame folder in your Mass Effect 3 game folder.

How do I get this to work properly? For some reason the DLC does not want to use my character's LIs, and I can't find anything on the web on how to fix this.

Thanks! And great torrent, btw@"
,DCKK,2013-03-25T17:59Z,"@shinder
That mission does not include miranda.
what you saw was after the missions, in wich you can interact with miranda in the casino and in the appartment.

@fapfaps
You do realize that you only need the citadel folder and metadata, if you aren't getting the dlc then repeat the proces and make sure you have atleast played and finished the citatel main game mission (where cerberus invades the citadel)
Otherwise, use a different exe (delete/add content if necessary)

@furious
By checking the dlc folder (each dlc uses 1 folder), if you have 5 folders then you have 5 dlcs installed (wich may or may not include the bugged patch dlc files included in this torrent)

@sierra
Download from another torrent, the one that says (dlc files only) you do not need the installer, the patch dlc files or the exe for that matter.

@somd
Download the dll, use google."
,mikedongs,2013-04-04T21:50Z,"hey, those of you complaining about missing DLL files.... this is NOT a stand-alone game! that's the problem. you must already have the standard Mass Effect 3 game installed, because it provides those DLL files.

(the following is a general note, not ME3-related)

oh and getting DLL files from those DLL download sites is almost ALWAYS a bad idea. you really should figure out why a DLL is missing, because this almost always means you are missing other components. research the DLL name to see what should provide it, and get the whole thing.

for example, ""msvcr100.dll"" is provided by the MS Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable so you would download that instead of the DLL on it's own from some other site."

,reptile83,2013-04-21T18:13Z,"For people having problems with the binkw32.dll. 
Make sure you have the game installed first. I got this torrent, installed it tried playing, got the binkw32 issue, fixed it, and then nothing would happen. I would start the game and nothing would load. Clearly most of you knew this torrent is just the DLC, but I didn't. So in case there are others like me...this torrent is just the DLC you still need to get the game which is like 12gigs.

If you have the game and still are having issues with binkw32 try this guy: http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7089572/Mass_Effect_3_(RELOADED)_missing_.dll_files_fix"
,hesh94,2013-04-25T19:30Z,"works perfectly without any problems either in the installation or while playing the game.
it's advised to play the dlc after completing every priority mission and side missions and before going to assault cerberus headquarters.
thanks Mr.Stifmeister great work as always"
,Serenifly,2013-04-29T21:12Z,"Btw, does anyone know where to get the Alternate Appearance Pack for ME3? I haven't seen it included in any of the torrents"

For those having problems:
1 - check if you installed it in the correct location, for example you can install this anywhere you want, after that cut the contents and paste it where it belongs, it might be easier this way because by installing you do not know which is the main directory, i for example tought this had only the dlc folder, instead this has content up to the mass effect folder, so install this somewhere where you can look and explore.

2 - Remove the patches dlcs included in this torrent, i have no idea who made this torrent, but making it citadel + patches is a huge mistake, especially when the patches can cause trouble.
Go to Mass Effect 3BIOGameDLC and change name/delete the folders ""DLC_UPD_Patch01"" and ""DLC_UPD_Patch02""

3 - do not use the craked version of the exe in here, after deleting those 2 folders you will be able to use older exes, Google for an exe that works

--------------

Next time you upload a dlc for the game, do not attach patch updates if they are not necessary, do not put an exe that gives more problems then the ones it solves and do not make an installer to something that ain't necessary.
You need ONLY 2 folders, one for the dlc and another for the metadata.
No patches, no exes and no installers are necessary.

The most recent updates (patches and exes) causes several problems to players, namely broken romance scenes and ashley bugged power.
Can cause also crashes ingame when using certain interfaces.

By using this exe and removing those freaking patch dlc files you will be able to experience ALL the content in mass effect without the bugs introduced later on.

Happy gameplay.""

Just wanted to repost this because THANK YOU! Last thing I had was Omega, and after installing this my game completely wouldn't start, but this makes sense. I probably was missing 1-2 patches. Got my old .exe back from the old installation on my husband's PC and everything worked again!"
