Warning:
This is not a typical, sappy, love story. This is an all-consuming, soul-crushing, tear-your-heart-into-pieces story. ItΓÇÖs intense, gritty and raw, dark and disturbing, and it doesnΓÇÖt happen overnight. This is an epic love story that knows no boundaries and has no time limits. It grows and developsΓÇöwith hurt, sacrifice, and heartacheΓÇöover the span of a lifetime. 

Eva Fox is the princess of the Silver Demons Motorcycle Club. Growing up with bikers in the club lifestyle is all that she knows. When sheΓÇÖs a young girl, Eva meets the reason for her existence. Deuce West is the sexy, biker bad-ass of the HellΓÇÖs Horsemen Motorcycle Club. Like Eva, he was born and raised in the clubΓÇöbut thatΓÇÖs where the similarities end. Their first meeting is innocent, but as Eva matures into a woman, their chance reunions evolve into a fit of lust and love. Fate continues to bring them together time and time again, but their twisted journey is filled with pain, betrayal, and bloodshed that could tear them apart. Eva sees in Deuce what he cannot see in himselfΓÇöa man worthy of loveΓÇöand Eva spends her lifetime proving to him that her undeniable love is the one thing he canΓÇÖt live without. 

This is Eva and DeuceΓÇÖs story. 

It wasnΓÇÖt easy. 
Nothing worth doing ever is.
And love is worth everything. 

Seed and enjoy!
