This pack is now out and it only took exactly 1 month to create all these. Each are cbr formats, I do not do single jpg's because it looks like crap and will cause a clusterf**k of folders. To read just get a cbr reader, they are free and light to download. If you want more manga uploads comment on this pack, if I get word that people want more I'll spend another month doing pack 2. I tried to add as much info as possible in description. All these are either M [mature] or A [adult]. Read nfo for placing requests. Seed and enjoy - zombiRG
