,KidChess,2013-03-06T07:10Z,"Since these type of material (UCL Playoff Games) are very time-sensitive (Anticipation, going around without spoilers, etc.), please leave your torrents seeding :-). And increase your uploads if you can as well.

There have been times that I haven't uploaded after I've finished downloading but I will leave it on from now on being on this side of the deal for such a while.

Thank you D4E for the upload!"

,misteryleet,2013-03-08T00:36Z,"Demonoid4Ever is the best source for full matches. I vote he gains full authoritative position in match uploads with the help of the skull and bones.

Waiting patiently for the English commentary match: Steaua Bucharest v Chelsea (Round of 16 1st leg)

Thanks as always demon!"
