I deleted the others before creating this one because I was having problems getting it to work.  I'm seeding via Transmission in Ubuntu, though TPB says 0 seeders.  I have no idea if it's working or not."
,HellHarv,2013-03-06T03:13Z,"I'm also trying to download the torrent from TPB via Vuze in Ubuntu.  0% progress downloading after half an hour, so I guess it really isn't working.

ANYWAY, below is a copy-pastable URL for where I found the damn thing in the first place.  I just wanted to get it out there.
