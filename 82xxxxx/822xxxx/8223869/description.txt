Sharda (Raakhee) and Nima (Rekha) are sisters living with their widowed father. Sharda gets married to Balraj Kohli (Shashi Kapoor), a businessman, and they have a son, Sagar. Nima also marries a wealthy young man. But Nima's husband dies in an accident immediately after the marriage. Sharda, unable to see her sister as a widow, becomes mentally ill and is admitted to Pune Mental Hospital. After 14 years, an inmate strikes Sharda on her head, and she loses consciousness for several days. When she regains her senses, she remembers everything that happened 14 years ago, but is unable to recollect her life in the mental hospital. Her psychiatrist discharges her to the care of her husband and family. Sharda comes home and finds that everything is about the same, except that her son has grown up and is about to be engaged. She sees Nima still wearing a widow's garb. A few months later, Sharda sees Nima clad in a married woman's attire, and starts suspecting that everything is not what it seems. She then finds out that Balraj had married Nima and also had a son with her. As details come flooding back to Sharda, she experiences paranoia & is unable to trust anyone. She feels alone, lost, helpless, and distrustful in the midst of her loved ones, as no one is what they claim to be.
