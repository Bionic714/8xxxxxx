      Release notes     
                 
      

 Release has no audio. 
 
 This film was originally released as a single part. In 1979, Brakhage 
 revised some of the Songs series, including "23rd Psalm Branch". It was 
 presented on the BluRay Anthology as two parts, and so it is presented to 
 you that way. The year is set to 1967 for both parts because the film was
 originally released then. The 1979 re-release was just that: a re-release.
 
 Enjoy!
