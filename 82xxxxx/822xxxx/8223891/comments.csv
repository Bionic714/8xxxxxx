at that day i'm using winrar"
,thellblade,2013-03-14T15:33Z,"this BREAKS University.  Agreed with above, I can confirm that the fixes does prevent classes from being scheduled resulting in a blank timetable.

the store downloads from admz0r ALSO contains fixes which break the same game ... which means there is no solution online now"
,pallas795,2013-03-14T15:50Z,"SO just to be clear, the world and building files are not included in the mega merged .package files right? the ones labeled ""1-20, 21-40, etc?"""
,Pluup,2013-03-16T00:47Z,"If you are not getting classes in the University Life expansion while using the files from this torrent, it could mean that your Story Progression is not enabled. Open Sims 3, enable Story Progression, Drop out of University, Close Sims 3, clear all of your cache files, reopen Sims 3, and the next time you enter University you will have your classes. "
,morriganrane,2013-03-16T01:42Z,"If you have issues with classes and Uni, do not install the Sims 3 Store Fixes file. It needs updating, watch for an update to the file here

This collection is also missing the two Stairs that were added to Barnacle Bay later. If you want these you need to look for a BarnacleBayDD.sims3pack"
,renzore101,2013-03-16T22:12Z,if anyone obtains an update on that fix that doesn't break university please pm me any updated info

So does this mean that I will have all of the lots to place too, like the gothique manor that comes with the spell book?"
