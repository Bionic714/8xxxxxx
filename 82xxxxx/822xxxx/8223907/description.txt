"Double Down"

Ryan, still pained from the breakup
with Simone, (Piper Perabo)
backslides into his old gambling
habit, though sternly warned by
Lauren to steer clear. But when he
receives the life insurance check
for his deceased wife, it's more
than he can bear and he starts making
bets on anything and everything
Meanwhile Anne meets a stunning
young bookstore clerk, Brittney
(Annie Heise) who turns out to be all
beauty and no brains. Lauren comes to
Ryan's rescue by fleecing him at
poker and in the aftermath, Ryan
bonds with Anne over their respective
lost loves
