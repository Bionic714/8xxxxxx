,jenstl,2013-03-06T06:08Z,Mine will be finished in about 30 mins to an hour but @rbell14 typically you unzip those files and the setup will be in there. I will keep you posted
,Echalaine,2013-03-06T06:16Z,@rbell14 Extract the 001 file to get the iso.
,TheSeedingLeech,2013-03-06T06:16Z,"@rbell14
Sometimes you'll download a large file and find that instead of the single file you wanted, your folder is full of .001 .002 .003 ... These files are part of a split iso."
,Kal_Torak,2013-03-06T06:24Z,Those are partial rar files.  You unzip the first one and it combines them all together into a single file

shit"
,Xano089,2013-03-06T14:27Z,"Here is some help to anyone bobbing their heads and confused. Unzip the first file in the folder that you get, just the first one. Now you have something with a .iso extension in that folder, look for it if you don't see it. Now you take that and load it into Daemon tools, do not understand what that is? Please google it. It's a free tool. Now you will either be prompted to run it by your computer or by the Daemon tools, run it. VOILA it will be ready for setup.

Step 2 or something: Now you need a keygen and crack. IT's IN the file!! Just go to my computer, then you'll see that Sims university is loaded in your drive, so right click on it and go to OPEN. Now you will see a bunch of files, find ""Fairlight"". Everything you need is in there. 

It works, i promise, just do that and you'll be ok :)"
,murilla,2013-03-06T14:30Z,"Thank you!

Just finished installing, great stuff as usual.

The crack is in this torrent After you mount, just open the ""drive"" and find the fairlight folder for my personal favorite ever keygen and the crack. You don't even really need a crack either, I just use Nraas's nocd mod."
,murilla,2013-03-06T14:32Z,@Xano089: They can also use Virtual Clone Drive.

This is amazing considering the game came out yesterday!
The torrent was really slow at first, but then picked up at a decent speed.

So guys, REAL DEAL and easy. Remember to seed. Arrr arrr!"

I've got 2 (TS3W and TSLhost.dll) when I copy and paste them in Thesims3university/Game/Bin they don't overwrite anything (quite unusual) then when I click on TS3W it says 'Error' and when I Click on TS3EP09 it asks for the dvd after loading. Can someone help me please?

,Pluup,2013-03-06T22:02Z,"I really hate these 001 002 etc files. Anyway, if you're stupid like I am, open WinRAR (assuming you have it). Go to OPEN and manually go to the place where this torrent downloaded. You may not see anything in the folder cause the program is looking for .rars or .zips. In the lower right drop-down menu, select ""All Files"" so everything is shown. Select ""flt-s3ul.001"". The program will now show what's inside the 001 file. (which is an .iso file) Right click that file, and select ""extract"" (or something like that) The .iso will be extracted to the folder with the 001 002 etc files. Mount the .iso onto DAEMONTools (assuming you have it too, lol) and load up dat .iso. Make sure you browse the insides of the .iso to get the crack. It's INSIDE the .iso file. (the crack is in a folder called ""Fairlight"". Goodluck guys. Also, put the crack files into THE SIMS 3 FOLDER, NOT University's. "

,Indiecisiv,2013-03-07T03:07Z,"Hey everyone having the ""please insert disk error""... my fiance was having the same problem all day. I solved it in about 5 minutes xD... just start the game from the cracked file itself in the sims 3 folder. The TS3W file after you crack it."
