 Game information:
 =================

 Are your Sims ready for the time of their lives? Heading off to college  in
 The Sims  3  University  Life  opens  up  new  opportunities,  from  social
 connections to career growth. From class activities  to  major  -  specific
 objects, your Sim will find new ways to learn! And  university  isn't  just
 about hitting the books. Join a protest, flirt at a bonfire party - there's
 a lot to explore outside of lectures at the student union.


 Features:
 =========

 * Achieve Academic Excellence. Learning is more fun than ever with new
   major-specific objects. Your Sims can broadcast their own radio show
   as a Communications student or bone up on anatomy using the skeleton
   as a Science and Medicine major. Your Sims can also learn through
   class activities, lectures at the student union, and joining in
   social activities.
 * Get Ready to Party!  Text books and study groups are a big part of
   college, but sometimes Sims just need to party! From hosting
   bonfires by the lake to doing juice keg stands at a dorm
   party, there are lots of ways to have a great time and
   let loose.
 * Make Connections and Network. Grow your social networking skill
   through texting, blogging and streaming video. This builds your
   affiliation with the three social groups on campus - the Nerds,
   the Rebels and the Jocks. Building your cred with these groups
   offers unique advantages, from earning dream jobs to a
   coveted extra trait.
 * Actions Matter.  Just like in real life, your Sims' decisions are
   deeply interconnected. For example, a Fine Arts student benefits
   from the Avant Garde trait, and develops their Street Art skill
   and cred with the Rebels by tagging and spray painting. Just
   don't let your Sims get caught by the cops!
 * Reap Benefits After University Too!  Help your Sims reach the top
   job in your career path more easily with faster promotions and a
   higher entry-level job for university grads. If your Sim becomes
   a legend with their social group, they may even land a dream job
   as an art appraiser, sports agent, or video game developer!
 * Explore the Campus and Town.  From striking out at the bowling
   alley to flirting with the barista at the Roasted Toasted
   Beans to browsing comic books at Keith s Komics, there's
   a whole new town and campus full of places to explore.
