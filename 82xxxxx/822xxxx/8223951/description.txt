This album is a collection of badly produced demo tracks I recorded when I was bored. The album is divided into 2 parts, comprising of distorted white noise in the first half and vocal improv on the second half. In closing it's quite shit actually.
Genre: Avant Garde: Experimental

Album Notes
Album notes? I didn't put too much thought into my music. Flatulence sounds better than the music I make.
