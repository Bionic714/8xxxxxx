,sconnell80,2013-03-07T02:03Z,"Well I have the games on my computer, but I can't play them. I tried to play solitare and hearts, then tried chess, but nothing will open up. Any clues?"
,Halloweenpsycho,2013-03-07T06:57Z,what is it doing exactly? just not opening or giving a error?
,sconnell80,2013-03-07T11:11Z,You click on the game or games and nothing happens. No errors or anything trying to pop up.
,Breaksense,2013-03-07T22:02Z,Ever thought of looking for them in the Store? They are free and updated + new games.
,Halloweenpsycho,2013-03-08T00:49Z,"@Breaksense

,Halloweenpsycho,2013-03-08T00:50Z,"@sconnell80

,Halloweenpsycho,2013-03-10T21:48Z,"Hey all..i apologize in advance..i am not feeling well at all..i see some are having issues installing windows 8..Please Note: The issues described such as black screen or asking for drivers or not loading at all upon reboot..If this is happening..First not all pc's are windows 8 compatable or ready...One you can try updating bios..But to those with limited experince in doing so, it is possible to brick your system if you are not careful when updating bios, and i don't want to see anyone go through that so please be very careful, and or ask for help and i am sure someone can help you with the process..Bricking doesn't mean your system is fried, you can unbrick it but a slight bit of knowledge in flashng your system is required..This may or may not solve your issue..What you should do is locate the info on your pc such as make of the motherboard, manufacture..Like intel, Asus, etc..Check that the board is able to run windows 8. If you are experencing these issues and the bios update does nothing for you, then more than likely your pc is not capable of running windows 8. You can revert back to windows 7 and you can use my torrent if you like it contains all versions of windows 7 64 and 32 bit from starter clear up to Ultimate..WIth all oem for all pc's..Menaing when you run my torrent it will load the correct screens and info for your computer again intel, asus, etc.. my Windows 7 torrent is located here..https://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8058081/Windows_7_Sp1_Halloween_Edition_%5BAll_32_and_64_bit_versions%5D
Also includes latest Daz loader mad props to Daz for the loader..I know it sucks but trust me you are not missing anything not having WIndows 8, as it is just basically windows 7 with a few adds..But everyone likes to have all the new stuff i understand..Once i get over being ill i will be back on to keep updates coming for windows 8. Also to those having a issue and if i have not got back to you, please be patient i am not ignoring you as i will get to you as soon as i am feeling better. Also i want to say thank you to all of you trying to offer your help to those that are in need..Power to the people and the community..May TPB live on for ever..ANd a special thanks to all those for the support you have given to me for my torrents, with out you i am just another person sitting on the couch in lala land.. :) You all rock..

,digigod,2013-03-14T06:43Z,"Great work Halloween! Yr windows 8 wrked prfect first time on my machine. I'm downloading games from you too, as ms site too painfully slow! Cheers again :) "
,digigod,2013-03-14T08:04Z,"PS. I didn't have to update bios or do anything special... but, I DID extensively research all possible ramifications before commencing install. And I recommend all you NOOBS, read, read, read B4 you do anything as major as upgrading yr OS. You'll find everything you need to know on Google, including tweaks and apps to restore the 7 start menu and start button etc..."

,ecoSt,2013-05-26T21:26Z,"sorry, my last comment was for the windows 8 start orb and not this... though this lacks seeders"
