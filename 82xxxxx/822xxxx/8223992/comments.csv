,prophet1776,2013-03-06T06:17Z,"So, is it going to be the norm from now on that all major uploaders are going to only upload the major shows all in the exact same x264 rip and any other format waits til the next day?  I mean, really?  So now every major uploader races to beat each other to get up the exact same format of the exact same rip of the exact same show?"

,mwalsher,2013-03-06T07:53Z,"No, prophet is correct, why the hell should the SAME FILE be upload multiple times? All it does is fragment the swarm because when you are uploading/downloading it, you cannot get/share with people from other swarms even though it is the SAME FILE. Duh."

,prophet1776,2013-03-06T08:23Z,"Plus, anyone stuck still on android 3 or less like a lot of us homeless who can't afford the newest and best devices need a usable codec.  It is not cool of the uploaders to try and forcefeed us a single codec which isn't even the most widely accepted format for all platforms.  

@ epictoad, try formulating anactual response, something epic like your name implies or maybe change your handle to something more appropriate like tinytadpole5150."
,BoonesFerry,2013-03-06T08:28Z,prophet1776 -- your ignorance is showing.
,thaghost1,2013-03-06T08:30Z,lol ^
,thaghost1,2013-03-06T08:30Z,"Aww, I pointed at the wrong comment."
,redhare,2013-03-06T08:59Z,ETTV thanks for whatever you care to offer. There are plenty of conversion programs that people can use to get a preferred format. I could understand complaints if they were coming from your employer or the person who pays your rent but do us a favor and still get complaints????????

,Toby196,2013-03-06T13:18Z,"Thanks, ettv.

And to the asshat comparing his situation to that of the homeless because he's stuck with an Android 3, do you realize you're crying about a file that you're neither paying for, nor being forced to download?  Life's tough, huh?"
,stlrzfan,2013-03-06T14:05Z,Love the mp4 format. Thank you! Don't feed the trolls...
,tanyag,2013-03-06T15:11Z,"I think the upload is great and stop whining, "
,mwalsher,2013-03-17T14:53Z,"What a bunch of idiots. First of all, prophet isn’t *comparing* his situation to the homeless, he *is* homeless (he said so in another page of this exact same release by a different person).

Second, as I said, it is stupid to have a bunch of different people releasing the exact same file because it fragments the swarm. If you want an MP4, then fine, but have ONE PERSON release it. If someone else releases the same video as an MP4, then it should be a DIFFERENT file (a different encoding), NOT THE SAME FILE.

Duh."
,mwalsher,2013-03-17T14:56Z,"…you guys realize that ettv isn’t RIPPING or ENCODING the video right? 2HD did and ettv (and eztv and a whole bunch of other people) are just uploading it. That’s fine if each one is uploading it to different places, but for all of them to upload the exact same file to the same place is pointless and actually harmful.

If you want this file later on, there may not be as many sources, so you could search for the hash to find more sources in more places, but then you would miss out on the sources from the other swarms that have the exact same file. Double duh."
