,extracube,2013-03-10T10:31Z,"By the way, what do you guys think about Uriah Hall?  On the one hand, I don't like him.  He's a real jerk.  If he wins it all, and he could, I will think ""oh man, couldn't have gone to a bigger asshole.""  On the other hand, you kinda have to respect his separation from the group, his rebelliousness, he refusal to be a part of all the chit chat, the party stuff.  Also, the cameras don't show everything.  Anyhow, still I just don't like something.  Something is really wrong... But I respect the rebel, a little.  Hard call. ??"
