,Raikalo,2013-03-06T07:14Z,I tried to wait until Zygor stopped patching and releasing updates to death before I uploaded one so we wouldn't have to keep manually updating.
,Domn,2013-03-06T08:08Z,Great work! as always!
,almasyseifer,2013-03-06T08:08Z,"i made an account so i can thank you for uploading on patch day.

I don't know what to tell you other than to go to your character select screen and hit the addons button, then check ""load out of date addons""."
