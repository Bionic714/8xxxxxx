Retail-quality vector pdf.

There are several versions of this edition of Plato on tpb; this is the best. It's not a scan and does not appear to be a conversion from any other format. As far as I can tell it's flawless.

There are many translations of Plato on the market. Of the complete editions in English, there's Jowett, which is archaic, and the edition edited by Edith Hamilton, which is good but now a little out of date. The Cooper edition represents the best current scholarship. And for what it's worth, it was required in my Plato seminar a few years ago, and I liked it.
