Summary: Based on a true story, student activist and Mexican-American Paula Crisostomo (Vega), tired of being treated unequally, decides to take action and stage a walkout at five East Los Angeles high schools in 1968, to protest educational conditions and complain of anti-Mexican educational bias along with some 10,000 students. Paula Crisostomo (now Romo) is not Mexican- American--she is Filipina-American. She and her husband, then boyfriend were roommates of mine in college. We are very good friends and I see her often.
