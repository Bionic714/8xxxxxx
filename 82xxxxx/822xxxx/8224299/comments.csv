,narlene,2013-03-10T10:03Z,"I downloaded it, mounted it fine, installed it, and went to play... it tells me no disc. 

Where is this ""fairlight folder"" that I need to copy into the Sims 3 folder? Please help me I want to play. "
,MisterAwesome23,2013-03-10T14:43Z,So this is The Sims 3 + The Sims 3: University Life ?
,adorija,2013-03-11T17:00Z,It says no archive...what is the problem?
,Shawk132,2013-03-11T20:16Z,"For those who can't find the Fairlight folder. If you unrar the file flt-s3ul with either winRar or PowerIso or any other program which can unrar, you will see that among all the files there will be a folder called Fairlight, copy it's ""Game"" content into the installation directory and you should be good to go. Hope this helps!"
,adorija,2013-03-12T16:36Z,When I tried to copy says there is not enough space on SIMs 3EPO9. You need additional 18 MB to copy this files. What is the problem? I tried to uninstall and could not do it...
,adorija,2013-03-13T20:51Z,Thank you!!
,totamariee,2013-03-14T08:50Z,"Downloaded and seeding already, but PLEASE someone help me here. 

Every time i try to install it tells me i have to update (but in the launcher it says i'm fully up to date) 
When i let it update in the installation it ends up crashing, then i cant launch the S3 launcher what so ever, and have to system restore!! How the hell do i get around this please?!"
,vflaten,2013-03-14T09:43Z,"I've done everything right, but it still doesn't work..
Mounted with daemon tools - installed the game - cracked it. Once the game has loaded, it comes up that the game can't find the disk. Very annoying, and I don't know what the problem is. Any help, please?

I'm still seeding, so others can download faster :)"
,RAPHAEL-,2013-03-14T16:30Z,"Anyone know how to solve the No Game Disc upon startup error :*(
all other pirated expansions are working fine"
,RAPHAEL-,2013-03-14T16:40Z,"@vflaten
I was also getting that but just fixed!!
delete the crack and recrack it with the same files, then start the game with no internet connection
worked for me!"
,vflaten,2013-03-15T00:08Z,"I'm starting to get really pissed here, haha.. It won't work! I'm mounting it, and it works just as if there were a real cd there. It's really weird, cause the S3 launcher says that the game is installed.. But when I get to the main menu at the game, it says there is no cd. I seriously don't know what to do."
,vflaten,2013-03-15T00:19Z,"Omg, I don't know what I did right now, but it works. :o Thank you! Still seeding :)"
,TOAL9601,2013-03-15T00:36Z,"Do you need the sims 3 razor 1911 downloaded

,TOAL9601,2013-03-15T03:45Z,Can somebody give me a thorough explanation of how to install it with the keygen and how to copy the cracked content. Pls and thank you
,hondac3,2013-03-17T19:10Z,"I have a question, if I download this, does it come with the maps, or do I have to buy them?"
,kathykat63,2013-03-22T11:46Z,"Not so sure if I like this expansion pack.  The celebrities will not speak to my Sim because of job, skill or celebs are jerks.  Now there is some click thing with Geeks and Rebels.  My Sim had to go streaking to earn Rebel Points.  Maybe I haven't given it a fair chance because I just installed University Life.

Thank you extremezone!  Works flawlessly.  [:  "
,kathykat63,2013-03-22T13:18Z,"T@TOAL9601
Just my opinion, but I think this is the easiest way to go.  Google search 'DAEMON Tools Lite'.  It is free and suggest doing a custom install and decline toolbars, setting homepage to, or similar things.  Once you have Daemon Tools Lite, the software will recognize .iso and a few other formats and you should see the Daemon Tools logo on the .iso after the download is complete.  

The word that confused me was, 'mount' the .iso.  The .iso pretend a DVD.  Daemon tools creates a new CD/DVD drive that you will see going to 'Computer'.  Double click the .iso and look at 'Computer' where it shows your hard drive, DVD, USB storage.  If you see the title for Sims3EPO9 (I think?) and you have successfully 'mounted' the .iso.  If not, right-click and you should see an option to load or mount to drive (D:), for example.  

Once you have mounted the iso, double-click on the disc drive to see the files.  Run the setup to install open the FAIRLIGHT folder. When you get the serial prompt double-click on 'keygen', generate, copy the generated key, paste it to the serial prompt.  

(C:) > Program Files (x86) > Electronic Arts > The Sims 3 > Game > Bin

Right click on the TS3W.exe and send to Desktop to launch the game.  Copy the .dll and overwrite the existing one, I think...  I like the NoCD game mod by Nraas Industries.  Google their website.  They have lots of faq's, tip & tricks and some interesting game mods.

Hope I was able to help and got the instructions right.  If not, someone please correct me."
,andrew09211,2013-03-23T18:44Z,"theres no need to crack any games, just mount the .iso sims into a virtual drive and it works great, I have  not cracked any games and it works perfectly. 

just use powerISO"
,SirDomaX,2013-03-24T13:25Z,Some more seeds please :)
,frogygrin,2013-03-24T13:27Z,"So I get this

,anorexist,2013-03-25T21:47Z,It crashes on the loading screen... Help?
,anorexist,2013-03-25T22:20Z,EDIT: Got rid of my Mods folder and it worked just fine.
,andrew09211,2013-03-26T00:39Z,"PEOPLE PLEASE, DO NOT COMPLICATE YOUR LIFE, YOU DO NOT NEED TO USE ANY CRACK , I HAVE NOT CRACK ANY OF THE SIMS I HAVE INSTALLED AND I HAVE ALL THE 18 EXPANSIONS, ALL YOU NEED IS TO GET ""(powerISO) FREE
MOUNT THE .ISO LATES INSTALLED EXPANSION INTO THE VIRTUAL DRIVE, AND THAT SHOULD BE ENOUG TO BYPASS THE CD CHECK. 
LIKE I SAID, I HAVE NOT ISTALLED ANY CRACK AND IM PLAYING RIGHT NOW 
email me if you need help, andrew09211@hotmail.com "
,mrcrogman,2013-03-26T02:41Z,Does anyone have a mood hack or something similar to a trainer for this expansion?
,Shoobox,2013-03-26T06:32Z,"For all the people with common sense, you do not need to keep the iso in virtual dirve or anything there is a legitimate cd bypass called 

NRaas_NoCD for ea sims 3, google goes a long way
or go to modthesims website to get instructions on how to use the NRaas_NoCD

Google 
mod the sims 3 NRaas_NoCD its that friggn easy!

 follow mod the sims website instruction, I have every possible thingf you get get from sims from iso to maps to store items, you do not need virtual drive to play the game"
,sadiemm,2013-03-26T20:02Z,Does it works with Mac or not?
,nikss14,2013-04-05T08:32Z,does this work on Mac??? 
,frogygrin,2013-05-01T11:32Z,seeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed pls!!!!
,hehe1312,2013-05-06T23:31Z,"Ok, so I had this problem about not being able to install sims when I mounted it. When I forced it to start install I cant update it. So Here's the problem. restart your computer and I'm sure it will work! :)"
,madkillerabdo,2013-05-09T18:43Z,"For the people who get the Disc Authorization Failure. Copy the crack in the BASE Game directory, not in the University Life expansion folder. :) "
,LazarusBamph,2013-05-30T23:42Z,"Remember to go into the folder where the keygen is at.  Then go Game > Bin.  Copy the contents, and bring it to the Bin folder in the original The Sims 3 folder (NOT the TS3 University Life folder).  Overwrite the stuff there and open it up; should work.  So yeah, you would need the original Sims 3 game to play this expansion."
