Black For More (1993) [DVDRip]

Actresses: Debi Diamond [Facial] Lacy Rose Micki Lynn Nicole London Actors: Eric Stone St Julian. Jox Sean Michaels Description : Julian St. Jox is a successful lawyer and tavern owner, or so he tells us. But he acts more like a pimp, and his bar is always closed. Julian welcomes pals Sean Michaels and Eric Stone to his closed tavern, where all partake of the women Julian keeps around - Nicole London, Micki Lynn and Debi Diamond. But Julian treats tbe girls like sex objects and they leave him. Sean Michaels Julian Tells That He Should Get back with HIS Wife, as the Little Play morality ends. It's an interesting tale, but a Lot of Cash Markman's Dialogue does not seem to ring true. Most of the videos of black life directed by Michaels are usually more realistic in speech and tone. The sex likewise is erratic. There's some cross-cutting between Michaels / Lynn, St. Jox / Diamond and Stone / London which viewers could find disconcerting. Also, the Nicole London / Micki Lynn lesbian scene is unexpectedly cut short. There are tons of interracial videos out there, and while I wouldn't term this one bad, it certainly isn't great.
