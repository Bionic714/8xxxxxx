,aarque,2013-03-06T16:52Z,"The *key* that allows the gauges and locked components to work is most likely in the registry. Another way to get gauges is to use an aftermarket product like ISG which I saw offered here. (http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7874949/%5BFSX%5D__Ernie_Alston_-_Integrated_Simavionics_Group_1_%28ISG1%29_v1.8) It is a set of assignable gauges and users upload specific panel config's, perhaps there is even one for this 777 already at the website.

fskillerX has gone way beyond the call to provide this share and he has done the absolute best he can, the rest is up to the pirates."

,el_kab0ng,2013-03-08T04:15Z,"@camus_to
Did the enable file have a readme that you removed? The cache for the original upload of the file indicated there were instructions on it's use.

@virtualanarchy

From your previous posts it appears one needs to follow the steps below:

1. Install the 1.0 base pack exe.
2. Run the enable button app (instructions lacking on when and where to run this during the install process. The install process deviates to ask for either a captain sim provided code or to generate one. It seems when the enable button runs and you select the 'choose code file' option, you can move past this.)
3. Replace the installed files with the ripped once fskillerx has been generously providing us.
4. Run FSX and happy happy joy yourself to death.

Results: Because it's unclear if we need to use the original 1.0 ripped files when replacing what the installer installs, then install the 1.1 service pack, THEN install the effin ripped files from this torrent, who the hell knows if its supposed to work or not. In my case, it didn't. No wheels, panels, etc.

I hate to ask this again, but if someone could provide some clear guidance on this, we'd all be alot better off and not have to continue to jerk off to the sexy ads to the left and right of this posting."
,el_kab0ng,2013-03-08T04:43Z,"Apparently we need the contents of what's in his HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREWow6432NodeCaptainSimx772 registry entry (assuming he's running Windows 7). 

And before you claim these are machine dependent, think again. The CS707 was cracked using reg keys, not a binary, so we know the reg entries are not unique to the system it was cracked on.

Specifically, we need to know the following values from HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREWow6432NodeCaptainSimx772:

RegCode =
RegName =

If you have more than just:
x770 and x772 (like an x771, x773 or x774) we need to know that as well.

I think we're close, guys."
,rmeleby,2013-03-08T06:21Z,"Those registry positions should only apply if he is running x64.

If he is running x86, they'll be under a different location"
,youdown1211,2013-03-08T10:31Z,"@el_kab0ng
to share the regcode and regname is difficult for fskillerX
if we know that we can install directly"
,rokket_1990,2013-03-08T11:24Z,"@el_kab0ng 

The RegName you ask for is simply the serial number...!
So, don` t wait for that, except if someone is brave enough to provide his...

Anyway, the serial contains always 17 digits (numbers and capital letters combined), if that helps...

But, I think the only way that could make this bird work is to modify the content of the gauges. I bet that the serial number is alredy somewhere inside those activated gauges. So we need a tool that edits them. In other words, we need a serious cracker. 

That`s the way all previous cs planes were cracked, not just with a serial number…"
,Kantonnn,2013-03-08T11:43Z,"YOU DON'T NEED THE INSTALLER TO GET THIS (partially) WORK, READ THE DESCRIPTION.
Just copy all files to your fsx folder.
AND DON'T FORGET, to copy gauges files who are located in :
SimObjects/Airplanes/CS_B777-200ER_GE/panel
copy all gauges files except ""panel.cfg"" into your gauge file in the main fsx foler

You don't need enable button or any installer, just copy the rip files.
Then it will partially work, with black screens and no gear.
We need a real cracker, and crack these gauge files to get this fully working.

Do you know a person who can do that ? Who cracked the pmdg 737 ?"
,turontado117,2013-03-08T12:36Z,yes the guy who cracked the ngx is komu i think.
