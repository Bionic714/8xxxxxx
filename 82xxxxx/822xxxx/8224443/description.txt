Sorry again simmers
i rip all files from folders below 
                the Captain_Sim folder 
                    SimObjects
                       Airplanes

                            CS_B777_PAX
                            CS_B777-200ER_GE
                            CS_B777-200ER_PW
                            CS_B777-200LR
                            CS_B777-300_PW
                            CS_B777-300ER_GE
                            CS_B777F

the .GAU files are into YOUR FSX FOLDERSimObjectsAirplanesCS_B777-200ER_GEpanel
and not in main GAUGES folder.

hope you can crack it or maybe this bird can fly
enjoy dear SIMMERS
