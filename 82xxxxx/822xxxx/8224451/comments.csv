,misteryleet,2013-03-08T01:30Z,"Demonoid4Ever is the best source for full matches. I vote he gains full authoritative position in match uploads with the help of the skull and bones.

Waiting patiently for the English commentary match: Steaua Bucharest v Chelsea (Round of 16 1st leg)

Thanks as always demon! "
