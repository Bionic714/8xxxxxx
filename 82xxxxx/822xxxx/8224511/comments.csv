,binderguy1,2013-03-06T12:06Z,"As I was too!!!  Thanks for the ul, STFmaryville!
Much appreciated.  :-)

Just hope that someone else comes through for the FAUST miniseries and one-shots (by AVATAR Press) for ul.

Hope those Leechers haven't screwed this torrent up too badly!"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-06T15:44Z,"you're both welcome. i've only found a few of the spin-off issues, and they're kinda hard to find ... actually this core series was hard to find until Morningstar took it upon him/herself to start getting this series back out there, and at HD resolution.

and don't worry, i'll be seeding this fully for at least a week, so the torrent will stay healthy. nice to see so much interest."

,combinationskin,2013-03-07T01:22Z,"Wow! one of my favorite series. I drove around town back in 91 to grabbing back issues once I had discovered issue 9. 

Nice to have in digital format so I can reread. .

Thank you STFmaryville!"
