A new Phosphorescent LP and that can only mean one thing: that youΓÇÖll be listening to a beautiful record. Muchacho sets its stall out pretty much from the off with a veritable salvo of velvety, sepia-tinged tracks, choc-full of harmonies and cloying mid-tones and rich textures. Sun, Arise (An Invocation, An Introduction), Song for Zula and Ride On / Right On envelop the listener in a warm, soft world, one where itΓÇÖs safe to share your innermost thoughts. And it doesnΓÇÖt stop there, some tracks moving towards a pure pop sound, indeed on A Charm / A Blade it seems the mask has cracked to reveal the wearer: Houck seemingly joins Abba ΓÇô that easy, hopeful melody contrasted with a bittersweet subject, the lashings and lashings of choral vox, the happy clappy beat; the gameΓÇÖs up. 
Now, normally I run a mile from too much comfy feel good music, but Phosphorescent is something different. For one, Matthew Houck can play the ΓÇ£feelingsΓÇ¥ card better than most. And thereΓÇÖs enough in the lyrics ΓÇô and in some of the frankly baffling song titles - to suggest that heΓÇÖs not someone who just relies on his way with a pretty melody: ΓÇ£kill you with my bare handsΓÇ¥, or ΓÇ£I can be the devilΓÇ¥ ΓÇ£IΓÇÖve been fucked up, IΓÇÖve been a foolΓÇ¥ spring to mind, and then there are lines about smashing things up, losing his temper etceteraΓÇª In that respect itΓÇÖs classic Country & Western: the loner boy growing up the hard way and learning humility through lifeΓÇÖs simple lessons.
Before you start retching into a bucket, it must be said that Houck also has a brilliant knack of making the most mundane event sound like something life changing: it may be tear jerking stuff, but to be fair to him, itΓÇÖs believable; you donΓÇÖt think that any of the emoting is for effect. But most of all itΓÇÖs that warm, cracked voice that lifts his music out of the ordinary. He sings in a manner that just takes no prisoners, and what with a rich dollop of harmony thrown in pretty much everywhere, itΓÇÖs difficult not to be won over, especially when the music dovetails with the message, as in the brilliant A New Anhedonia or the The Quotidian Beasts, which blossoms out into a tough, increasingly impassioned confessional. 
So in retrospect, itΓÇÖs nothing weΓÇÖve not heard before, and thereΓÇÖs been a lot of this winsome, elegiac 60ΓÇÖs / 70ΓÇÖs country rock in recent years. I also donΓÇÖt subscribe to the consensus that simply making a beautiful record is a good thing: at times youΓÇÖd like to hear something a little sparser or rougherΓÇª music like this can suffocate, but thatΓÇÖs only a minor quibble. You could say, if you wanted to pick a fight (the wrong one IMHO), that Houck treads very safe ground. You canΓÇÖt really argue with any of the songs, or the way that Phosphorescent sings them. ItΓÇÖs pretty bloody impressive, this LP.
