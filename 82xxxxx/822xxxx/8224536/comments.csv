BTW: did you have any luck on my request of the Gold Key UFO Comics?  I found them, but they do not download as the torrent is like 3 yrs old!  The titles are:  UFO Flying Saucer  and UFO and Outer Space.  read them as a kid and would love to have them again!


Also, this torrent's share ratio has reached WAY over 10, so it's up to all you downloaders to keep seeding this so others may enjoy"
