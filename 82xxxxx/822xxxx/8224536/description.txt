Issue #7 of Prize Comics, published in December 1940, featured Dick Briefer's 'New Adventures of Frankenstein' This is considered by many historians as 'the first real horror series'. Frankenstein continued its run until Prize Comics #52 in April 1945. Briefer eventually morphed him into a humorous character.  He also had his own Comic from Prize which also was humorous in tone, but toward series end it did return to it's Horror roots


This torrent includes the complete run in Prize comics (A good read for the other features as well, my personal favorite is the Black Owl) and as many complete scanned issues of the Franestein comic as I could find.  There should be no incomplete comics in this torrent
