Who are the men and women who bring bloody death to innocent civilians? Why do they do it? What are their methods? And how do they justify it? This emotionally charged four-part series provides unprecedented interviews with dozens of bombers, gunmen, hijackers, kidnappers, and radical leaders as it scrutinizes key terror campaigns that changed the course of modern history, right up to the destruction of the World Trade Center. These powerful interviews, intercut with grim newsreel film and video footage and peppered with photos from police and news archives, make this series an unforgettable viewing experience.

3)  In the Name of Revolution 
For modern revolutionaries the world over, Cuba's Che Guevara literally wrote the book. This program examines radical political movements in Germany, Italy, Peru, and Colombia to see how Che's theories have fared in practice. Former gunman Peter Juergen Boock, of the Baader-Meinhof Gang; former gunman Valerio Morucci, of the Red Brigades; a former Shining Path insurgent; and Raul Reyes, second-in-command of FARC, talk about their roles in their factions' ideological wars. Giovanni Moro, son of the murdered Italian statesman Aldo Moro; Peruvian Truth Commission member Carlos Tapia, former leader of the United Left Front; and Peru's Minister of Justice Fernando Olivera Vega provide additional insights.
