Christian Bale:
The Inside Story of the Darkest Batman.
by Harrison Cheung, Nicola Pittam.
--------------------------------------

Christian Bale is at the height of his fame playing most successful Batman and winning an Academy Award for "The Fighter". His real-life Alfred, a man who served as his publicist and assistant for 10 years, tells the inside story of the reclusive star. During the London press junket for "The Dark Knight" in the summer of 2008, Christian Bale was infamously accused of assaulting his mother and sister at the five-star Dorchester Hotel. Six months later, a recording of Bale's four-minute rant on the set of Terminator Salvation was leaked and the star's irritability began to define him. But beyond his notorious temper, Bale, an Academy Award-winning actor for his role in "The Fighter", is known for his ability to physically transform himself for roles in "American Psycho", "The Machinist", and as one of Hollywood's most revered and bankable characters - the quintessentially American anti-hero, Batman. In "Christian Bale: The Inside Story of the Darkest Batman", Bale's former publicist and assistant Harrison Cheung - his real-life Alfred - shares an inside look into the little-known personal life of the intensely private and reclusive actor.
