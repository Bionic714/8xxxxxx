,jboydgolfer,2013-03-07T00:14Z,"Save Yourself the time , and Bandwidth. This Torrent is GOOD, but the game is TERRIBLE. I'm a HUGE arma fan, and have been for a while. It kills Me to say it, But unless they make some HUGE changes they have a fail on their hands. TERRIBLE."
,Spunkybd,2013-03-07T00:45Z,"@jboydgolfer  Your an idiot.. this is an alpha.

They said quarter 3 2013 for full stable game.

Until then shut up.."

Pretty good for an alpha. Poster above is a dumbass"
,falcon187,2013-03-07T00:50Z,"Guys, please realize that this is an ALPHA.  This means that huge changes are in order still.  This game is no way to be completed and released tomorrow.  Please give the game a chance.  They make changes every day.

If you are going to download this torrent please show your support towards these developers and purchase their game when it is fully completed.  These guys are on our side.  They want to release a good game thats worth your  money"

,ben865,2013-03-07T02:09Z,"I swear, some people are complete idiots.

A couple things you have note here.
1. The game is in alpha. That means there are going to be bugs, maybe some gamebreaking ones.
2. Of course the download will be slow. Look at the seeder to leecher ratio.

Anyway, thanks for the upload. Can't wait to start playing, especially since the multiplayer is working on this torrent. The only reason I'm not purchasing this is because I don't have any money. As soon as I get $32 however, I will be buying this."
,ouslecas0,2013-03-07T02:12Z,"Buy this GAME Arma is one of those games WORTHY of money Plz if you have the money sometime, Buy it. id love to see this game and its engine more polished for this and future games.
such a rare find to find a game thats actually worth every penny."
,rooock,2013-03-07T02:26Z,"the way torrents work is that the leechers should be able to download off each other.

hence, slow speeds are not making too much sense,

or did I get it wrong? "
,Depardieu,2013-03-07T02:27Z,"Is there a crack or something I'm missing? I start the .exe and nothing happens or it re-directs me to the ArmA III community screen, can anyone help me out?"
,plagasx,2013-03-07T03:20Z,"People stop trying to be the good guy here.

I'm downloading this to test performance. If it's still terribly optimized like the previous ARMA's then I'm not buying it unless some serious performance improvements have been made..."
,Shoobox,2013-03-07T03:35Z,"confused, 
this Alpha is 4.62gb .
where as the other torrent Alpha is 7.03gb.
at 1gb 8 part rar files on the 7gb torrent arma 3 alpha
 I'm confued on the whole 2gb difference in the 2 torrents,
 unless one is a copy of the already installed files.
a

As far as supported the game.
LMAO i'm not paying $33. dollars for an alpha
and $50 for a seperate preorder full version, no matter how good the maker is."
,ben865,2013-03-07T03:53Z,"@Shoobox
When you buy the alpha for $32, you're preordering the game. Alpha and Beta access is just a plus."
,RichardRichardson,2013-03-07T03:56Z,"@Shoobox
The $33 is for the alpha, beta, and the full game when it's released."
,Shoobox,2013-03-07T04:35Z,"@ben865
thnx for the info
 now to figure out the difference in the sizes of the scene releases"
,aibonlengket,2013-03-07T06:44Z,"for people that just knew the game and arma gender, please keep your comments to your self or bug off! 

this are the people that put down good games and sincere developer. this dev deserve our thanks and paycheck. 

If you can't say anything good out them, then this game is not for you. delete the game and don't give opinion. don't say a word. 

I'm absolutely going to buy this game. the invitation is not yet release. so this is a good time to try stuff on your rig. If you can't buy it, then give them support. say great things, so more people would try and possibly buy the game. think of it as an advertisement. something to give back, can't afford it, then give them your time to advertise. "
,BileesD,2013-03-07T08:28Z,Nice upload but i will buy this one
,nerohero,2013-03-07T12:59Z,"Just want to say something, if you can't wait for another week to get the exact same thing legally free you're a very impatient person.
The only difference between the free alpha and the paid alpha is that the free one does NOT have mulitplayer and mod support, and it's obviously going to be a week shorter. "
,Slopery,2013-03-07T14:18Z,"Thanks, played OFP and ArmA II in the past, but i don't know if i still have the patience and time to play games anymore, so i will give this a try before buying it."
,Shoobox,2013-03-07T15:24Z,"All these people complaining about people complaining, and yet can't say anything about verifying the ISO size of the alpha.

Steam Version: 0.5 | File size: 8 GB.
SO is this compressed into an ISO?

@nerohero
Please post link where it says Alpha to be released for free in a week."
,kingdogss,2013-03-07T16:59Z,game sucks big time. i wouldent pay a penny for this game...
,XeNoise,2013-03-07T17:24Z,"I get an error when starting arma3.exe, it says it has no access to the destination (c:program....)"
,dubsnax,2013-03-07T17:33Z,"@Shoobox When you preorder Arma 3 you receive keys for friends to play the lite version of the alpha which is missing the multiplayer and mod support. The alpha-lite will be available on the 14th of March.

,dubsnax,2013-03-07T18:15Z,Well I just gave the multiplayer a try and spawned in as a seagull. One of their antipiracy measures no doubt. 
,talkhtw5,2013-03-07T20:27Z,Can we have a Dayz DLC? Can we use it? Or download it?
,Shoobox,2013-03-07T21:24Z,"@dubsnax
The alpha lite release as a steamgift till june the 18th. swtf does that mean, someone has to gift you, or steam sends you a invite for a gift."
,Shoobox,2013-03-07T21:29Z,"SO.. no its not exactly free unless you can get one of the steam codes.!!!

People need to start putting all the info out there before coming on the scenes saying"" Oh its free in another week,""  give the whole info people!
To clarify to others who thinks its a free download for Alpha lite here is a comment pulled straight from arma 3 website.
Last but not least, Bohemia Interactive also intends to release a free, limited version of the Alpha, named Arma 3 Alpha Lite. The Alpha Lite will be available one week after the initial Alpha release, on Thursday March 14th, and does not include a multiplayer component and modding support. Access to the Alpha Lite is invite-only and can be obtained from people who have purchased the Arma 3 Alpha"
,moeburn1,2013-03-07T21:46Z,"Works 100%, Win7 64bit here.  No crack needed, as it is pre-installed.  Everything works but the multiplayer, although I am able to view the servers in MP, the game crashes when trying to connect to one.

With my low-medium performance PC, I get an avg of 20-30 fps on standard settings (cept textures, set to ultra), AA and Postproc off:

,moeburn1,2013-03-07T21:47Z,"and no, FADE is not activated on this.  I can aim and hit targets just fine.  Either 3DM cracked it (unheard of), or it just wasn't included."

,mikrosis,2013-03-07T23:20Z,"@aibonlengket

,CMS93,2013-03-10T12:10Z,"@moeburn1 I never liked how unfriendly for PC ArmA is, not like its cousin Operation Flashpoint (well, at least Dragon Rising). But they did ok with this third release. Make no mistake I was always a huge fan of ArmA series, since the beginning. But lets face it, it could be a lot easier to play, for example, having to do almost every action with that middle mouse menu, it's one of the most annoying things about ArmA."

,RandomBS,2013-03-12T16:07Z,"@LeliGamer, in Arma 2 (not sure about 1) if you had a cracked game and FADE detected it, you'd randomly transform in a seagull. It's also used as spectator in multiplayer matches. Pretty annoying for us pirates but great antipiracy feature."
,azisco,2013-03-12T22:14Z,"Ahh FADE was hilarious, one of the few anti-piracy measures that actually made pirating the game too much work for me to bother. And now I've bought the game for DayZ, so I guess Bohemia won that round!"
