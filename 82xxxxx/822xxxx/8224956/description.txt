CYBER FORCE CONTINUES IN ITS GROUND-BREAKING RELAUNCH!
The massive corporation CDI continues to engineer technologically enhanced humans. Opposing CDI is a lone group of rebels. Will the public perceive the newly formed Cyber Force as resistance fighters battling for public good - or terrorists who must be stopped?
Not content in pushing the envelope just in terms of story and art, Top Cow will be the first major US comic publisher to launch one of their biggest properties with top tier creators concurrently for the traditional print market and exploding worldwide digital market for FREE. That's right, thanks to the support of fans through Kickstarter and participating comic shops, you can get the first FIVE issues of CYBER FORCE at no cost.


Thanks goes to Tarutaru for this release.
