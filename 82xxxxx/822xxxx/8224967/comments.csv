[V],RubrumPopulus,2013-03-06T20:17Z,Yep! Marcos Martin is awesome.  His most full issue interior work was the latest Daredevil series.  He was the original rotating artist with Paolo Rivera.  Before that he did a lot on Amazing Spider-Man.  He was one of the artists rotating with Humberto Ramos on the Big Time story arc.  His layouts and composition are always outstanding. :)
