,rubydoo,2013-03-07T19:32Z,It's missing dll files. Nice waste of time. 
,SonicAngel,2013-03-10T11:23Z,This didn't work for me... After installation and copy of crack the game just doesn't load. I click the file and nothing happens...
,JohnSmithJones,2013-03-17T10:08Z,I can't install. When I run the setup.exe it says it's missing disc 3. Re-check does not fix it.

bink32.dll
nxcooking.dll
PhysXExtensions.dll are all missing from the .ISO
I tried downloading them but every .dll does something certain and it has to be correct, unfortunately the game did not work even once I found and located the .dll's
So how did you get a green Skull?"
