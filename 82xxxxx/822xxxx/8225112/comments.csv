The EVOLVE proper cuts the promo out.

EVOLVE's NFO file: ""2hd left promo for graceland 4150-4505""

2HD's NFO file: ""Given the location of that Graceland PROMO and the fact that it aired at the conclusion
of the episode itself and not during a break as a typical commercial promo would, was to give viewers a 
sneak peek. Similar to the Xfactor with the Britney video and the Bachelor with the OZ promo. The fact 
the episode was scheduled in all TVGuides to run til 11:05 means that should be considered show 
content and kept. EVOLVE is resorting to some lame propers""

See line numbers 208 209 210 (222)
In the spirit of this portion of the rules, 2HD included the Graceland Promo as it was part of the End 
Credits of the show, rather than at one of the regular commercial break points.
My interpretation (as an outsider) of the Scene's TV Releasing Standards, 2HD's verion is not in violation,
and EVOLVE did not need to proper 2HD's release."
