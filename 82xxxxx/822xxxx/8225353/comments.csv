,lv2bll54,2013-03-08T02:55Z,which one of the 32 & 64 bit versions of the crack do i use. my os is 64 bit but my program looks like its 32?
,nox150690,2013-03-08T03:38Z,"@lv2bll54 , the cracks are for the type of OS you are running, so in your case, you would use the 64-bit crack."
,lv2bll54,2013-03-08T05:26Z,Yeah bro i had to  reinstall the complete game then it worked perfectly. Thanx for the help son.

,nox150690,2013-03-15T20:55Z,"Quick update: I have had a massive corruption of one of my Hard Drives, which is why I have not been replying recently, obviously this means that a great deal of work was lost, but it also means that I will not around for a few weeks, as I need to re-write all of the programs that I have made over the years, as well as get a new Hard Drive to replace the old one. Hopefully the information on this page, and the other pages, are enough for users to know how to install the updates. I will be back soon,

,s1kkdawgg,2013-04-08T18:55Z,"Hi there, I have managed to install blackbox sims 3 and the updates but when I try to install this update, it creates a total different directory. It's not like the previous updates. What am I doing wrong?"
,s1kkdawgg,2013-04-08T19:16Z,"can you post a video tutorial on how to do this. I've tried and no luck, it installs it as a university life update."
