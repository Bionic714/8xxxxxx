  Electronic means to making music are, for most of their operators, still quite a novelty. Sure, there are DJ types whoΓÇÖve been smashing bytes together for generations and a handful of enterprising indie acts whose laptronica bridged the gap between the digital and the meat world with varying degrees of success, but for the most part, bands who play instruments havenΓÇÖt been quite as comfortable with the world of programming.

The Firebird Band joins the ranks of a rare few artists ΓÇô most notably Blusom and Joan of Arc ΓÇô that are over electronic musicΓÇÖs novelty. With The City at Night, the band blends its organic and electronic parts so seamlessly that itΓÇÖs downright impossible to separate the two anywhere in the mix. Where everyone from your friendly neighborhood industrial act to electroclash and dance-punk hipsters have thrown guitars on a lumpy mattress of big beats, samples and weird noises, itΓÇÖs always been an uncomfortable union: HereΓÇÖs the rock, hereΓÇÖs the techno ΓÇô make sure they donΓÇÖt mix.

The Firebird Band gets the metaphorical peanut butter and chocolate all mixed up on The City at Night with vast soundscapes where atmospheric electronics loom large in the background while processed noises and tweaked guitar sounds play with voices and traditional guitars without making a fuss over it. The bandΓÇÖs songs are so blended, layered and atmospheric, itΓÇÖs nearly impossible to separate any individual elements from the song as a whole, not because of poor production, but simply because The City at NightΓÇÖs songs are so tightly crafted everything must be taken on its own.

ΓÇ£Obsessive CompulsionΓÇ¥ opens the album with synthetic squeaks and squawks, and then forceful beats and singer Christopher BroachΓÇÖs staccato delivery quickly join it. ItΓÇÖs a mix of gritty, here-and-now songwriting and introspective programming that splits the difference between Kid A and Danse Macabre. In ΓÇ£Los Angeles,ΓÇ¥ The Firebird Band opts to concentrate more upon atmosphere, as a wall of distorted, tricked-up guitars provide little more than noise-pollution atmosphere that fogs dance-floor beats and BroachΓÇÖs deadpan delivery, only to break into minimalist chunks of spooky programming. ΓÇ£TokyoΓÇ¥ sets aside much of the bandΓÇÖs programming for a song thatΓÇÖs essentially just voice and piano, with murky atmospheric bits making the minimal arrangement all the more haunting.

The City at Night is an album thatΓÇÖs more about atmospheres and mood than song-based indietronica acts. Then again, it isnΓÇÖt nearly as textured and atmospheric as albums by Radiohead or Blusom, acts infatuated by a ProTools rig. The Firebird Band definitely knows its way around a virtual mixing board, however, which makes its venture into elecro-rock an interesting one, even if it doesnΓÇÖt toe the dance-punk or post-rock lines.
