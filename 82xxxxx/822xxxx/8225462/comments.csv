[T],Tyr3ll,2013-03-14T12:51Z,"Did you follow the exact procedure as described from our previous torrents about ?
All previous version must be uninstalled first as offline
reboot and stay still offline.
Install any new version and rebbot still offline.
After second reboot,load anyDVD for the first time and disable ""check automatically new update"" (the all still offline)
close program as well as in your taskbar...
Place crack in AnyDVD folder and replace your actual trial one.
Close anyDVD folder.
Stay still offline and restart or reload anyDVD and you should get full retail version and thus if all is ok,now,you can reconnect to internet so.
Retry bro,it works for me as described here...
