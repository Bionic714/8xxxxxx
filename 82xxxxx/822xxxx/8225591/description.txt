  Sandwell District official and NYC techno legend, Dave Sumner, aka Function presents his hugely anticipated debut album thru Ostgut Ton. As is well reported, it's taken him 16 years to reach this point, but to be fair, he's already had a hand in one of the biggest techno LP's of the last decade in 'Feed Forward', and laid out more than enough killer solo 12"s and gear with Portion:Reform to assuage any indictment of laziness. And far from lazy, 'Incubation' is a predominantly gymnastic affair, albeit with a moody cinematic bent. Scene-setting sci-fi vista 'Voiceprint' sets the tone for a super sleek and rugged collection equally adept at rocking a club or turning your bedroom into a blacklit techno fantasia. There's the stoic kicks and cavernous rendering of 'Against The Wall' to get you in the groove, and the teasing vortex of 'Counterpoint' to prime you for the rippling tribal sweat-off, 'Modifier', and a gorgeous slab of Millsian dystopia on 'Incubation (Ritual)', and a sexier balance found in 'Voiceprint (Reprise)', balanced against slower tempos and tactile texturing with the sublime 'Inter (Album Version)' and the Morphosis-like needlework of 'Psychic Warfare', all lending a finely crafted ebb and flow to the story, skillfully rendered by a mixdown from feted engineer and producer in his own right, Tobias Freund.
