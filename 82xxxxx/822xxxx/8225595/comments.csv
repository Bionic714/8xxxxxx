,Alamantharis,2013-03-10T07:41Z,"Haven't tested the full DLC yet but I received Hackett's e-mail after Citadel Coup.

Install instructions are as follow (from what I can remember).

Put DLC_EXP_Pack003 and DLC_EXP_Pack003_Base in your Mass Effect 3 DLC folder.
Put DLCEXPPACK3COMB folder (found inside of _metadata folder in the .zip file) inside _metadata folder (DO NOT JUST OVERWRITE _metadata folder with the _metadata folder found in the .zip file). "
