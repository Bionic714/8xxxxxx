Oh Wild Child, youΓÇÖre just as sweet as pieΓÇª and quite possibly one of 2011ΓÇ▓s breakthrough bands. There is no denying that Wild Child is a cut above the rest and all the while it seems to come so easily for them. Their debut album, Pillow Talk, is set to release on October 25, so if youΓÇÖre in search of a fresh new poppy indie-folk band with all the bells and whistles, well then Wild Child is yours for the taking (but please purchase their album, of course; support the cause!).

Wild Child began when Kelsey Wilson and Alexander Beggins met a few days before a six-week tour and found that they were both in the midst of a breakup. This prompted them to write ten songs while on tour and then, once back home, continue to compose more. Heartbreak works wonders for the music industry.

That brings us to what Wild Child has developed into today: a six-piece orchestral band including ukulele, violin, cello, drums, keyboards, and a multi-instrumentalist who compliments their songs with bells and a xylophone, among other things.

IΓÇÖll confidently go out on a limb and say that Pillow Talk may very well be named one of 2011ΓÇ▓s ΓÇ£Best OfΓÇ¥ albums. The vocals and harmonies are flawless and gorgeous, the strings are ridiculously catchy and dazzling, the keys add a brilliant substance, and the drums do a fine job at guiding each song (and your feet). This 15-track album is one of anthemic proportions; itΓÇÖs impossible to not sing along. After all is said and done, Wild ChildΓÇÖs talent is undeniable." -- Review by Christiana Bartolini on Indie Shuffle
