Trivia - Series 2 [RTE Ireland] (2012) PDTV XviD 


Back for a second run, David Pearse resumes his role as obsessed team captain Lawrence, Keith McErlean plays his best friend Adam, and Janet Moran is Molly, the first season's new recruit to the quiz team who became Lawrence's girlfriend.

The second season of Trivia begins with a funeral. The deceased is Kevin McKenna, the owner of the Flick Shack video shop and the only employer Lawrence Duffy has ever had. His death has come at a tricky moment for Lawrence who is now in a committed relationship with Molly; they're in the process of moving in together.

Molly has firm ideas about their immediate future. She calls it 'The Plan', and it goes like this: she will get qualified as a paramedic and pursue a real career with real opportunities, while Lawrence will continue to . . . be Lawrence. His only real responsibility is to keep them (and Aisling, Molly's daughter) afloat while Molly goes through training.

Unfortunately for Lawrence, Kevin's widow, Maura, has other ideas . . .

"It's been a pleasure to revisit it," says David Pearse when I get hold of him on the proverbial blower as ask how it was to go back to Trivia. "It's good to be back, and especially when it's with such a good bunch of people - a good bunch of actors, and director, and everybody else. It's like a family reunion, almost."
