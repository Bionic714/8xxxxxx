 You are an excellent uploader.
 I am from India and having a guess by your name expect you to be from India too.
 I am new to TPB and want to become an uploader.
 Do I get some payment by uploading a file here?
 Please advise.
 Any one other is also welcome to respond.
 Kind regards> "

As for the Noob who wants to get paid for uploading, you obviously do not understand the scene.  My suggestion is that you check out the site Forumw.org  (Oh yeah, I forgot that site died because the owner wanted to charge for access and some of the Admin's were jerks)  Sorry dude, it is just that scene members DO NOT do what they do for pay....."
