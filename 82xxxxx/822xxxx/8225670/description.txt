GRAND-AM Rolex Sports Car Series Race#2 - Austin Texas - March 2, 2013


This 2hr 45min race was run at the Circuit Of The Americas near Austin Texas. It is a brand new track just opened in Fall 2012 with an F1 race. The course is 3.41 miles long and 20 turns.

This video is in the form of a .ISO file intended to be burned to a blank DVD of 4.4GB. It is in Blu-Ray format BD5 so it should play well on any external Blu-Ray console connected to a large-screen HDTV. All of the commercials, station breaks, and on-air promos have been deleted so the race action flows very smoothly.
