,riverchase,2013-03-07T00:49Z,any word on the phantom stranger for this week?
,BabiesDontNeedSpleens,2013-03-07T06:20Z,"Thanks.

I have a request, if you have time. 

i'm looking for some of the Dark Horse comics The Thing horror adaptation/continuation. I'm not sure how many there are, but i know they made a few. 

all I see is FF's The Thing.

Many thanks"
,BabiesDontNeedSpleens,2013-03-07T06:27Z,"Thanks.

I'm looking for dark horse's The Thing: Thing for Another world runs - i think there were two series, maybe more, but i don't recall, and The Thing: The Northman nightmare.

TNN is up, but with 2 seeders, never on. If you could help, it owuld be much appreciated. "

BabiesDontNeedSpleens, wikipedia lists 4 thing miniseries but oddly doesn't include northman nightmare (guess it hasn't been updated), so that makes 5. i'll look for 'em later today if i get a chance."

http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8230245/THE_THING_-_THE_NORTHMAN_NIGHTMARE_%282011%29_%28Nothing-Novus%29_REQUES

i'm afraid the latter is much better quality than the former, but i'm pretty sure they're all there in two compilations."
