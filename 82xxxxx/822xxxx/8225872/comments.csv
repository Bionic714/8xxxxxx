[T],ShoReleases,2013-03-06T20:14Z,"@crisytaiser, sound quality isn't bad at all. I don't know what player ur using but it's pretty good with VLC and WMP. & it's all in sync!"
,mikeike65,2013-03-06T21:04Z,@crisytaiser Thanks so much for telling us something that we dont give a shit about.
,oeqmxji,2013-03-06T21:04Z,"It does play normal in VLC. No issues. Audio appears to be AC3.

I could not get it to work with WMP though, maybe my codecs are older, audio would not work at all actually. So there is something different about it. No worries though, thanks!"
,Sharkeee,2013-03-06T21:10Z,"Confirmed...nothing wrong with the sound. Great quality, especially for the size of the file. Thank you ShoReleases!"
,haleya,2013-03-06T22:57Z,Great torrent thank you! Could you also download the latest episodes of dance moms?
,everx7,2013-03-07T02:25Z,"actualy crisytaiser is absolutly right about the sound, its quite bad. Did watch every episode of this show, with vlc, but this one has the worse audio, from all, i think u guys have some hearing problems or something if u cant hear that the audio is fcked, ye is in sync but thats all whats good about it, nevertheless thx Sho"
,ptv83,2013-03-07T16:23Z,"SUBpar sound quality when you can get it to play in VLC.

K-lite mega pack wouldn't play the sound in media player classic,

VLC wouldn't play it the first tme, but played the sound the 2nd time i opened the file.. playon(which uses VLC) wouldn't transcode it to either the xbox or the WII U

Windows media center wouldn't play the sound past the first 1.5seconds on the xbox360
definitly something odd with the sound encode"
