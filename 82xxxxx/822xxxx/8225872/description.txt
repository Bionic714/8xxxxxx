Air Date: 2013-03-05

We find out what goes on in Adam's head as he takes control of the show and gets to do whatever he wants. First he tries to teach Tanner and Rut how to play football--with an automotive twist. Then he reveals his own concept car designed to protect you against the worst things on the road--other drivers. Finally, he gets behind the wheel of the legendary Ford GT40 and puts a bizarre twist on the classic Le Mans race where Ford beat Ferrari, with an unsuspecting Rutledge at the wheel of the Ferrari.
