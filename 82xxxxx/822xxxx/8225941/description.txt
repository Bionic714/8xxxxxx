============================================


- Custom installer compressed (1xDVD9 or 2xDVD5). No serial is needed to install or to play and you can tell the installer to shutdown the computer automatically when the installation is finished.

- The game is updated with patch 1.21 (main menu shows v1.1.1.6156) and cracked, both 32 and 64-bit. Yeah, not only 32-bit files are included, but also 64-bit ones to run the game the smoothest way possible. Even more, you can play using the original (non-cracked) files with a mini-image. Everything indluded.

- Multiplayer works in both LAN or official servers (though in the latter case you need a valid key).

- Voice and text are in English and Spanish. The installer will give you the chance to install one or both (and, in this second case, let you choose later using a cmd menu).

- A trainer, a fantastic pdf guide and the libraries the game requires are also included.

- Nothing has been deleted. The game is full.
