War is declared ! 

Have the mascots of your favorite free software titles battle it out in the Wormux arena using dynamite, grenades, baseball bats and other bazookas... Exterminate your opponent in a 2D environment with toon-style scenery. 

Each player controls the team of his choice (penguin, gnu, firefox, wilber,...) and must destroy his adversary using more or less casual weapons. 

Although a minimum of strategy is required to vanquish, Wormux is pre-eminently a "convivial mass murder" game where, turn by turn, each member of each team attempts to produce a maximum of damage to his opponents. 

Wormux is free Open Source(under GPL license) and free (no cash). 


Top install Wormux under Ubuntu Linux just use the Synaptics packet manager ;)
