After ten years of wrangling, Luaka Bop is set to release 'Nobody Can Live Forever: The Existential Soul of Tim Maia' a fifteen track survey of Maia's 1970s recordings, completely remastered, commemorating what would have been the Brazilian musical legend's 70th birthday on September 28. The release is the fourth in the label's World Psychedelic Classics series, known for unearthing long neglected masterworks by Os Mutantes, Shuggie Otis, and one of the first compilations of African psychedelia and funk.
