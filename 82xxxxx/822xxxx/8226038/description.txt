Once again in the opening slot for Dave Matthews Band, the Mule pulled out all the stops for the crowd at Riverbend Amphitheater. Slackjaw Jezebel left no doubt that the Mule is a force to be reckoned with. My Oh My made its first appearance in a while, but the undeniable crowd pleaser was the beautiful intertwining of When Doves Cry and Beautifully Broken. Short set or not, the band delivers an outstanding show every night, and this was no exception.
