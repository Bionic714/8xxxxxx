This is the background for the documentary.  Turkish Chamber of Commerce paid for a DVD to be distributed with TIME Magazine Europe. Within the DVD there were material that denied the Armenian Genocide. 

Time Magazine had not reviewed the DVD before distribution and was horrified when they found out the blunt and crazy official Turkish lies about historical facts. 

Besides printing a letter condemning the appalling Turkish attempt to fabricate lies about the Armenian Genocide, TIME Magazine Europe distributed this documentary free of charge to their readers.

,Kidon01,2013-03-06T22:18Z,"This documentary is thoroughly vetted by TIME Magazine and all available renowned historians. 

This is the background of the documentary: The Ankara Chamber of Commerce included DVDs, denying the Armenian Genocide and bluntly fabricating historical “facts”, with their paid tourism advertisements in the June 6, 2005 edition of TIME Magazine Europe. 

Time Europe later apologized for unwittingly promoting the historical distortions and lies promoted by the Turkish Chamber of Commerce. 

In order to give their readers the true story regarding the Armenian Genocide, TIME Magazine Europe printed a full-page announcement denouncing the Turkish lies and included in their  February 12, 2007 edition of Time Europe a DVD of THIS documentary by French director Laurence Jourdan, in addition to an interview with Yves Ternon"
