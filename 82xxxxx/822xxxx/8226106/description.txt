Model Comments: I am from Denver, Colorado! Born on the east coast however, in Baltimore, Maryland. I'm really glad that I can call myself a Colorado girl though. I love traveling and living in different places, in fact, at the end of the month I'm moving to Philadelphia and my family lives pretty close to there so it will be cool!┬á I started modeling and loving the camera when I was in about 9th grade. I loved taking pictures of myself, the classic mirror shots. The classic arm out holding the camera ones. Then I realized there was such thing as timer on a camera. So I started to use that. I kept in shape through high school, mainly with sports such as volleyball and dance. Finally, through dancing at a studio highschool, I was asked to be in a dance magazine and modeled for the first time there. It was sooo much fun! I knew then I wanted to model.┬á When highschool ended, I moved from CO springs to Denver. It was a big step out all on my own but I have enjoyed it and learned so much from it. I'm over Denver now though. It's too small. It introduced me to soo much stuff I love though. I love riding bikes and I love being in the big city. Running in the mornings through the city and watching it wake up is a fantastic feeling. Denver is also the mecca of electronic music. I absolutely love going to shows such as Skrillex, Datisk, Pretty Lights, and Big Gigantic. Those are among my favorites right now and what I currently listen to. Also, I go go danced at a club for a little bit and would love to entertain some more. All of these things, running, bike riding, dancing and sometimes even the gym are all part of my fitness. They target different things and they are what keep me in shape. I don't avidly have a schedule to work out, because I'm too busy, but when I dance and run and stretch, my body craves it and loves it. 

Model Comments: My agent in Denver, who I'm no longer with, actually referred me to a fine art nude photographer and that is how my nude "career" took off. I was found through modelmayhem by the agency I'm with now and came to LA! It has been awesome, working and finally doing something I love and making a living off of it. Although, not my ideal fashion career, but it's a start to something new, and hell, maybe I was destined for it. Right time, right place in life. Boyfriend doesn't mind, just no dicks for this chick! Haha. Dad is okay with it. Eh, mom and stepdad don't know, but once they find out, I won't even care!┬á┬á I hope to someday be making it big and branching out to do many more things. After all, what is New York and L.A. full of but opportunities? The vibra king was immaculate. First time everrr for squirting. Didn't even know my body could do that. Now I kind of want to do it more. =D
