EXORCIST 2 : THE HERETIC [HD 720p DTS] - Original Uncut Version

A 720p preservation of the original version of John Boorman's most disreputed film, a shipwreck for some, a masterpiece for others.

"I like the first Exorcist, but The Heretic surpasses it. Maybe Boorman failed to execute the material, but the movie still deserved better than it got."
- Martin Scorsese
