This is the mixed versions of the albums, which is great actually, because the unmixed tracks are already available in a different torrent here on TPB, and on top of that, if you youtube the tracklist you can even grab all the normal songs free from YouTube.

This is all that remained unreleased, so grab this, and add it to the other torrent to have all the stuff you would get with the iTunes purchase :)

DUB ON BRETHREN!"
