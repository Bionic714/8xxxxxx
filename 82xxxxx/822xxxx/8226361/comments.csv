,ptv83,2013-03-07T16:25Z,"""SUBpar sound quality when you can get it to play in VLC.

K-lite mega pack wouldn't play the sound in media player classic,

VLC wouldn't play it the first tme, but played the sound the 2nd time i opened the file.. playon(which uses VLC) wouldn't transcode it to either the xbox or the WII U

Windows media center wouldn't play the sound past the first 1.5seconds on the xbox360
definitly something odd with the sound encode""

is a shame because it's a really good episode and the only other release is well over a gig in size :/"
,_GKG_,2013-03-13T19:19Z,Sound is really messed up ... doesn't anybody have a decent 480p/avi encode of this?
