,Sassano,2013-03-07T15:01Z,"guys, if not work. download and instal this file first: DmC.Devil . may.Cry.Update.1.incl.DLCs-RELOADED"
,samani27,2013-03-07T19:18Z,i have update 1 .... i want only dlc... where i will get that??? blood palace and other dlc? plz give me link? i dont want to download again full update pack its very huge 3-4GB
,blaqwave,2013-03-07T19:52Z,"I have both DmC.Devil.may.Cry-RELOADED and
DmC.Devil.may.Cry.Update.1.incl.DLCs-RELOADED, but it crashes after choosing Vergil's Downfall, does anyone know why?"

,Luthor126,2013-03-07T22:22Z,how to choose dlc in game?

,Xeks07,2013-03-08T01:18Z,"This game just keeps crashing the more you play it.
Does anyone other than me have this problem?"
,n1x4,2013-03-08T01:27Z,"Works perfect with 1.2 update + ALL DLC/Skin packs.. 

Do NOT run the '.exe', instead:

> extract it with winRAR 
> copy contents (DevilGame dir) to your DmC install dir
> replace existing crack with one from 'Crack' dir
>????
> profit

I renamed the 'intro movies' b/c I hate them and I recommend you do the same so no cause for any fuss  there."
,blaqwave,2013-03-08T04:32Z,"@tmq321, I don't know how the others made the dlc work with DmC.Devil.may.Cry.Update.1.incl.DLCs-RELOADED only, I thought I should give a shot and download the update 2 even if people are saying only update 1 from reloaded should make it work, and now it's working. I downloaded from here: skidrowgames*net/dmc-devil-may-cry-update-2-cracked.html , but this thepiratebay*se/torrent/8152317/DmC_Update_2-CRACKED seems to be the same file, but uncompressed :)"
,Chronorider,2013-03-08T07:08Z,This one is just as bad as the rest. After it crashing directly after clicking Vergils Downfall. I read and installed the update 2. Now it lets me get through clicking on vergils downfall and waits until it starts to load the game to crash. Is there no working version? Why post trash then?
,winshot,2013-03-08T11:23Z,Can anyone upload only the crack and pass the link...? 
,Luthor126,2013-03-08T14:49Z,i installed in wrong folder first time but now it works perfect. thanks for this one.
,samani27,2013-03-08T17:17Z,"i have update 1 and all 3 dlcs,then also this is not working... if u dont have update 2 then dont download this..."
,Jacko2410,2013-03-08T19:17Z,works perfect
,dokebu,2013-03-09T03:16Z,"works perfect!

for those who did not make this torrent work:

1. use the base game RELOADED version or any other steam version

2. install this update: https://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8146245/DmC_Devil_may_Cry.Update.2-P2P
(NOTE: this is update 2. Contrary to others, Vergil's Downfall needs update 2.)

3. install bloody palace update, use this one:
https://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8171412/DmC_Devil_May_Cry_Proper_DLC_Pack-P2P

4. install Vergil's Downfall, copy the crack content and viola! It works.

,carlito7,2013-03-09T03:35Z,"this DLC keeps on crashing, i installed it correctly and it does work... well kinda, i can get to play it and all but on the first mission it crashed like in 3 different places, had to open the game quite a few times after crashing, and in the 2nd mission it keeps crashing right at the beginning, after the first enemies pop up and you have to take a right to the floating platforms-bridge, i can't get past that, it always crashes, anyone else having that problem?"
,omega_jss,2013-03-09T03:39Z,"dokebu: it worked indeed on the 1.2 with bloody palace as u said (vergil is fucking badass, by the way), but I LOST THE DLC COSTUMES AND SUPERDANTE... any idea on how to fix that? anyone?"
,Exletion,2013-03-09T15:11Z,"Alright, so I also loaded DmC.Devil.may.Cry.Update.1.incl.DLCs-Reloaded the this DLC does now work, however, I had the previous costume pack installed which apparently is not compatible with any of the Reloaded DLC. I can't stand playing as the original Dante anymore after playing with the classic Dante skin. Does anyone know if there is a costume pack DLC compatible with Reloaded suff?"
,deveon2,2013-03-10T07:58Z,"For people having issues with DLC packs gone missing here is the fix 

Every DLC has unique ID which is stored in the steam_rld.ini file found the ""DmC Devil may CryBinariesWin32"" folder. 

File will contain lines like 
DLC001=223790
DLC002=229080
DLC003=223792

each code represents a new DLC pack. 
I think one of the DLC code over writes overwrites the other DLC code due to which the skin pack goes missing. 

The fix is pretty simple the bloody palace crack containing the steam_rld.ini has 3 DLC's you just need to update it and add the DLCcode for skin pack.

SO all you have  to do is add this line in the final steam_rld.ini once all the updates and DLCs are installed 

DLC001=223790
DLC002=229080
DLC003=223792
DLC004=223793

This is added just below the app ID which read like 

AppId=220440

,kokalica,2013-03-10T17:24Z,"Look guyz,let me help you. I was trying to make it work for whole day and finally i made it. You need update 2 CRACKED,it's this one http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8152317/DmC_Update_2-CRACKED. When you download and extracit it,u'll get Devil,Engine and Binaries folders. Just copy and paste Devil,Engine and Binaries into your DMC instalation folder. It will replace the old ones. Go into game and see if u've unlocked the Bloody Palace and weapon skins,if u did then it's all ok. As for Vergils Downfall,extract it,u'll get Vergiles Downfall folder,Crack and autorun. Copy Vergile's Downfall folder into DMC/DevilGame/Published/Content where your wepons folders are. Delete your desktop icon and put the new one,u can find it in Binaries,Win32 ----> DMC - DevilMayCry,right click on it,send to desktop. Crack it with the crack that u got with Vergile's Downfall ISO and also copy the autorun into Vergiles'downfall folder. Right click on you desktop icon,start as administrator and when u start the game,u should have 2 options,DMC and Vergile's downfall. Choose Vergile's downfall and have fun :) Hope I wasn't to complicated with the explanations :) "

,cherrydee,2013-05-28T19:03Z,"Ok so after 4hrs of installing and uninstalling i got this working

1. download the 3 torrent (update 2-p2p, properDLC-p2p, and vergil's downfall)

2. go to safe mode

3. extract the update 2-p2p using 7zip. copy and paste the contents to DMC folder. 

4. cut the patch 1.0-1.2 and paste on your desktop.  open it with notepad and type 
@setlocal enableextensions
@cd /d ""%~dp0""
on the topmost of the codes then save

5. cut the file again and paste it back to DMC folder.

6. run the update and it should work

7. extract the proper DLC. you should get 2 folders. paste it on DMC folder and allow to merge.

8. mount the vergil's downfall ISO. extract it anywhere. then after that, go to that folder and you should see devilgame/published/content/vergildownfall. cut that and paste to your DMC/devilgame/published/content folder

9. copy the vergil's downfall crack files and paste it on your DMC/binary/win32 folder. open steamrld and be sure to have:

DLC001=229080
DLC002=223792
DLC003=223793
DLC003=223790

DONE!"
