Wolves and The Mire (Becky Cloonan)


Wolves:

As a lone hunter tracks an elusive beast through the forest, he reflects on his life and past love through a series of flashbacks bringing the story to a climax that is as romantic as it is savage. This powerful short story begs for multiple read throughs, never giving concrete answers, but (like the best enigmatic endings) leaves your own conclusions satisfying.

The Mire:

The much anticipated follow up to 2011s WOLVES, THE MIRE is a self-contained story set on the eve of a great battle, when a humble squire is tasked with delivering a letter to a seemingly abandoned castle at the heart of an ill famed swamp. Met with mysterious apparitions on the way, he slowly unveils the truth behind his journey as his past is re written over the course of the comic.
