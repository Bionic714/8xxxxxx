If your looking for more irish stuff check out sharingirish or my other torrents on TPB, stay away from the other private irish site previously known as CT, its run by a right muppet who renames other peoples files to put them into his pay only VIP section and never credits the original cappers, most of the stuff on his site is either sourced elsewhere from sites like sharingirish or ripped from RTE player in the lowest quality! I should know, i used to moderate there until i realised what was going on, so stay away from there and help keep irish torrents FREE forever! :D
