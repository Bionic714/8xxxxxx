,Doc_Grant,2013-03-07T21:52Z,"I used ESET Smart Security 6 to setup a firewall to deny all TCP & UDP connections to and from Program FilesVueScanvuescan.exe

Then I set up web access protection to deny any connections from *hamrick.* (their website). That got it to take the serial and customer number with ""OK"" in all the fields rather than the ""Tsk, tsk :)"" that normally pops up if you try to enter one of these serials without blocking the internet access first.

Then it says it's activated as Professional edition, but when I go to scan something it still layers the watermarks over the image and asks for activation to get rid of them (de-activates itself again). I'm not that familiar with firewalls or how to look at an application's outgoing and incoming internet traffic. 

Anybody get this to work?

Key.txt just says ""First block this app with firewall!"" at the bottom."
