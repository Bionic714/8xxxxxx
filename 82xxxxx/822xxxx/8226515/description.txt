From the Infowars web site :: On the Wednesday, March 6 edition of the Alex Jones Show, guest host Mike Adams covers a number of important issues, including the death of Venezuela's Hugo Chavez and Attorney General Eric Holder's declaration that it is legal for the government to murder American citizens with drones.
