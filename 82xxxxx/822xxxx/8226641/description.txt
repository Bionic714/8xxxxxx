Helheim #1 [Oni Press]

During the age of the Vikings, savage wild men and dark creatures beset a small settlement. A brave war party stands as guardians of the helpless villagers, but they are no match for the horrors rising up around them. One of the warriors, a young hero named Rikard, will pay the ultimate price in battle ΓÇª but his fight is far from over. A gothic horror story of witchcraft, night creatures, and the undead.
