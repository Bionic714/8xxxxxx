Pádraic Nally [RTE Ireland] HDTV 720p x264 AC3 DeViL303

In October 2004, John Ward - a 42-year-old father of 11, a small-time criminal, and a Traveller - was beaten 20 times and shot twice resulting in his death.
Padraig Nally, a 61-year-old farmer from Mayo, was tried for his murder and found guilty of the lesser charge of manslaughter.
On 11th November 2005, he was sentenced to six years in prison, then he was freed in October 2006 after he was acquitted of the manslaughter.*
The case - Nally admitted to killing John Ward - divided the country and many racist jibes were aimed at the family of the victim, while the media heaped insult on top of the man's death by (in many cases) excusing the killer's behaviour. Padraig Nally testified that he lived in fear of the victim and attacked John Ward while
he trespassed on the farmer's property.
Ann Costello, a community worker with the Galway Traveller Movement, was interviewed by the Sunday Business Post after Nally's second acquittal. She said,
''Travellers are very concerned about this verdict and feel powerless. Political leadership has been absent on this issue, and it is time Travellers got reassurance
- at senior government level - that they will be afforded the same protection as every other citizen.”

* (Padraig Nally was freed in 2006 after the Court of Criminal Appeal ruled that Mr Justice Paul Carney, the high court judge in the original trial, erred in law by failing to allow
the jury the opportunity to return a verdict of not guilty).

If your looking for more irish stuff check out sharingirish or my other torrents on TPB, stay away from the other private irish site previously known as CT, its run by a right muppet who renames other peoples files to put them into his pay only VIP section and never credits the original cappers, most of the stuff on his site is either sourced elsewhere from sites like sharingirish or ripped from RTE player in the lowest quality! I should know, i used to moderate there until i realised what was going on, so stay away from there and help keep irish torrents FREE forever! :D
