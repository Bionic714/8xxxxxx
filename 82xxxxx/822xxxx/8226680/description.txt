Unlike the "old" Latin America, today's Latin America is both readily accessible to smaller North American companies and is being transformed into a bustling business environment. However, for those without a native, in-depth understanding of the emerging changes within today's Latin American marketplace and a grasp of the cultural implications at hand, doing business in Latin America can still be challenging for smaller U.S. exporters and importers.

Doing Business in the New Latin America: Keys to Profit in America's Next-Door Markets, Second Edition serves as an insider's travel guide and trader's manual for understanding the region's market environment and best export sales opportunities in each of its countries.

Part I familiarizes readers with Latin America in general, profiling its nations from a business perspective; Part II explains how Latin American business attitudes developed from a historical perspective. The third section of the text focuses on the all-important art of makingΓÇöand keepingΓÇöthe deal.
