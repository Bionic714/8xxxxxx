[T],MrDowntown,2013-03-07T04:43Z,Anyone read this? Any good or just flashy to sell a few copies?
,Calel1234,2013-03-07T09:10Z,"MrDowntown, it's ok so far. But there's far too little in the first comic to majorly pull you in because they don't tell you much at all. I'll give it a chance and read a few more of them. "
