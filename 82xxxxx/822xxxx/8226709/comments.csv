Worse than the picture, more stalling."
,SMOAK-inc,2013-03-07T09:11Z,It's Korean just fyi. Will wait for better copy (one without hardcoded korean subs or cropped out korean subs.
,GOML,2013-03-26T15:48Z,"Its actually Chinese, not Korean just FYI."
,PapaSteve87,2013-04-06T01:12Z,"Just FYI, there is no such language as Chinese. There are many languages and dialects spoken in China, but Mandarin (Putonghua) and Cantonese (Guangdonghua) are the two languages that mostly dominate the country. Mandarin in particular. The subtitles in this movie are in Mandarin."
