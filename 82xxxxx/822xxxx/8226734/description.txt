Summary:

WELCOME TO THE APOCALYPSE

In DeuceΓÇÖs world, people earn the right to a name only if they survive their first fifteen years. By that point, each unnamed ΓÇÿbratΓÇÖ has trained into one of three groupsΓÇôBreeders, Builders, or Hunters, identifiable by the number of scars they bear on their arms. Deuce has wanted to be a Huntress for as long as she can remember.

As a Huntress, her purpose is clearΓÇöto brave the dangerous tunnels outside the enclave and bring back meat to feed the group while evading ferocious monsters known as Freaks. SheΓÇÖs worked toward this goal her whole life, and nothingΓÇÖs going to stop her, not even a beautiful, brooding Hunter named Fade. When the mysterious boy becomes her partner, DeuceΓÇÖs troubles are just beginning.

Down below, deviation from the rules is punished swiftly and harshly, and Fade doesnΓÇÖt like following orders. At first Deuce thinks heΓÇÖs crazy, but as death stalks their sanctuary, and it becomes clear the elders donΓÇÖt always know best, Deuce wonders if Fade might be telling the truth. Her partner confuses her; sheΓÇÖs never known a boy like him before, as prone to touching her gently as using his knives with feral grace.

As DeuceΓÇÖs perception shifts, so does the balance in the constant battle for survival. The mindless Freaks, once considered a threat only due to their sheer numbers, show signs of cunning and strategyΓÇª but the elders refuse to heed any warnings. Despite imminent disaster, the enclave puts their faith in strictures and sacrifice instead. No matter how she tries, Deuce cannot stem the dark tide that carries her far from the only world sheΓÇÖs ever known. - Goodreads Summary of Enclave (Razorland #1)
