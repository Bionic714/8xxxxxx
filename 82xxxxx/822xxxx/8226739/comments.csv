,jmaster6918,2013-03-07T23:43Z,Is this the 48 FPS version?
,brbear,2013-03-08T14:54Z,"There isnt a home video format capable of 48fps.

It's unlikely that a BD rip is going to be 48fps."
,jmaster6918,2013-03-08T22:20Z,"thanks brbear. that's too bad though, I really enjoyed the HFR version in theaters "
,electrond,2013-03-09T14:49Z,Any subtitles for this one? Havent found any other 3D version of the Hobbit were the subtitle works. Thanks for the upload
,BlueSky86,2013-03-11T21:27Z,Pls. Seed!
,sakkispb,2013-03-12T17:53Z,"Can you please post some info about the movie? 
Audio/Video format..."
,USMLE1,2013-03-14T00:52Z,"3D playback doesn't work with PowerDVD12, side by side image in 2D and flickers heavily in 3D. "
,escozul,2013-03-14T10:07Z,"Guys don't get it mixed up. This is FULL OVER UNDER version. Not side by side or half side by side. Of course it won't play on powerdvd with side by side selected...

Look at the screenshots and read the description... we need peeople to seed this one cmon..."
,USMLE1,2013-03-14T22:31Z,"It won't play correctly as 3D in Powerdvd even with autodetect source format on, there is a dual image and it flickers heavily. "
,mr.Jbird,2013-03-20T23:00Z,thats probably because powerdvd sucks. try windvd. i havent finished dl yet so not sue if thats the pob. can anyone tell me if this is full screen? i cant stand movies being cropped. i dont understand why anyone would do that but is seems to be common these days
,mr.Jbird,2013-03-26T21:18Z,"ok this copy is bad. dont bother downloading. thanks for the effort but if your gonna upload a full disc why convert to .mkv just use anydvd and create an iso of the disc.. wouldn,t have needed to spend hrs converting it.."
,Snaptrap,2013-03-27T07:01Z,Over under? Seriously???! I think I'll just buy the actual BD.
,DaBigLebowski,2013-04-06T08:23Z,seed
,markes12344,2013-04-08T22:22Z,"Excellent work. 
Simple usage. 
-ImgBurn create image of complete folder
-Power ISO Mount img to virtual drive (other img mounts may work)
-Open VLC media player. 
--Media-Open disk
---check Blueray, (!!Not DVD or other circle marks!!!)
----Enjoy

Tested DVD working and playing superb quality in A/V

Just can't get to the menu of the dvd selection. haven't sourced this out yet. so no screen selection, options, or extra fun (bloopers, deleted scenes) "
,pr0xyw0rm,2013-04-17T07:59Z,"@Snaptrap 
The actual 3D effect is Top/Bottom not Side by Side. The 3d you see in theaters is Top/Bottom.  "
