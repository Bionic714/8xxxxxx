This is the long awaited update of Mr. Skousen's original and popular work, The Survival Home Manual, last printed in 1982. It has a new title and is a near total rewrite--expanded from 300 pages to 700 pages. This book is intended to give you all the information you need to implement a high security and self-sufficient residence or retreat, from initial design strategy to shelter construction details. Mr. Skousen's design specialty is building high security, totally self-sufficient homes that are completely off-the grid. This massive volume shows you how to accomplish the complex process of integrating all of the security and self-sufficiency systems into a conventional structure. His unique multi-purpose, high security shelter designs allow a person to install a concealed safe room within a conventional home that offers complete live-in protection from tornadoes, hurricanes, fire, intrusion and nuclear fallout. These are self-contained with independent electrical power, water, food storage and communications and compact living facilities--all with convenient access from inside your own home. His voluminous lists of specific product and equipment recommendations, along with sources, will save you months of research.
