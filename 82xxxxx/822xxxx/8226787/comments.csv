just wanted to say: Thank you so much for seeding this work over the last few weeks. At its peak, it had 36 seeds. Honestly, I can't even begin to say how proud I was about that.

In the future I will be uploading many more free literary works up here, once again with the 'bitcoin option' there for anyone with too many BtC's hanging around.

As a direct contrast to this work 'Frustration of Purpose and other Gothic Tales for Late Nights and Fireplaces' I plan to produce something with a very much different flavour to it. Like Alice In Wonderland, I dream this series of stories will be read to children, but also enjoyed by adults. 

The title of this will be 'Frustration of Porpoise and other Lovely Adventures for Sunday Mornings and warm cups of tea'.

TPB- you're the best."
