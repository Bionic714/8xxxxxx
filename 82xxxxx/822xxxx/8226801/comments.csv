,Verdicat,2013-03-19T09:11Z,"Hi Thanks so much for uploading and to the seeders. 320kbps, quality sounds ok, however its hard to truly ascertain as the volume is very low, even with everything turned up full. I have earbuds and its low enough to hear conversation in room. Will try another, thanks anyway, regards."
