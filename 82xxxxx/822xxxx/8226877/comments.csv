,phelpz,2013-03-07T02:37Z,Thanks for the upload.  This was a decent show.  A lot of these shows are rehashes of the same things over and over.  This one is not.  The first episode was pretty interesting.
,SerSpec-V,2013-03-07T06:29Z,Thanks. I'll check it out. 
[V],psspss,2013-03-07T06:44Z,"i have heap more stuff to share.. just takes time to ediit and source it..

i hope some scene cappers do the next stranded and haunted collector for us tonight as far as I see no sources out still"
[V],psspss,2013-03-07T07:18Z,"excellent series... dont know why some comment bad rating for it... else where.. drips

ep2 very interesting... gov is hiding lots huh

if ufos are real I want to know before i die.. bloody govs spying and hiding the truth on loads of stuff from dotcom to ufos

just wish we had more ufos flying over our country.. its much less corrupt then usa and migth get the truth out finally"
[V],psspss,2013-03-07T09:39Z,"one of the better ufo series discovery has done.. its a bit like ufos over earth which they should start up again following mufon investigations

also see the UFO alien abductions collection I just added theres similar stories to these in it you might like"
,falafelface,2013-03-07T22:50Z,"Its dramatizations are presented in the same kind of way that other show, I forget the name, where the actors are live but are in a green screened projected matte painted environment although not acted in the same campy humorous way as that other show but in a serious manner. 

Better so far than the usual 'realty' crappy paranormal shows"
,shawnaldo,2013-03-11T05:31Z,"As long as it's not another one of those ""RUNNING AROUND AT NIGHT WITH FLASHLIGHTS"" shows, I'll be happy. So tired of that Bigfoot/Monster/Ghost/Alien/Whatever Hunters/Quest Bull shit shows."
[V],psspss,2013-03-13T06:31Z,"hmm I love those shows.. destin truth was good and it had 2 times caught a ufo in a couple of episodes one being a big triangle craft blocking out the stars as  flew over the jungle

but no this show is a bit like Mufon UFos over earth series with some dramations"
