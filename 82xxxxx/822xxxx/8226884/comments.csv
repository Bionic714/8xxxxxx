BSG was filmed with film grain on purpose - the original miniseries was shot on photochemical film. The cinema-verité style of the show purposefully mucks up the image with static and grain to give it a wartime-documentary feel.

On the first blu-ray disc for each season of BSG following the miniseries, Ronald D. Moore gives a brief introduction touching on this subject plus there's a message from Universal stating:

""The Blu-ray release of Battlestar Galactica accurately preserves the artistic intentions of the creators. The stylized visual elements within certain scenes are intentional and faithful to the broadcast presentation of the television show.""

Although the methodology used to achieve this look differs between the miniseries and the full seasons (photochemical film for the miniseries and digital HD video with grain added for the full seasons,) the intended look is the same for both. Grain in dark scenes is completely and 100% normal. The same type of grain effect can be seen in movies like Beasts of the Southern Wild (shot in 16mm) and Clerks. It is NOT an encoding setting or bitrate issue. This is how it's *supposed* to look."
