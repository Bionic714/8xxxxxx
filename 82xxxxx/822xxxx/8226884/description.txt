Notes:

This is the 2003 miniseries in 720p resolution which preceded the four season show which was a remake (and improvement) of the original series from 1978-79. I have included a second selectable audio track for the Director's Commentary. The primary audio is 2 channel Dolby stereo @ 160kbps and the Director's Commentary track is 2 channel Dolby stereo @ 96kbps. This a two-part (and thus two file) miniseries, which is why some of the above stats have double entries.

Please note that my bitrates and file sizes are optimized for those who store and watch movies on their computers. The bitrates are high enough to look perfect on "normal" sized monitors and low enough to keep download times short and the file size small enough for those who have limited hard drive space to work with. If you plan on watching something on a large HD screen, you're going to need one of the larger file size, higher bitrate torrents. The larger the screen you'll be watching on, the higher the bitrate has to be to maintain picture quality. If you have a large screen, you'll need to experiment too see what bitrate it takes to maintain a quality picture for your particular size screen.

So far as I can tell, this is the only torrent of the miniseries in 720p resolution that's a reasonable file size *and* contains the second audio track containing the Director's Commentary, so please seed for as long as possible, preferably until reaching a share ratio of at least 3:1.
