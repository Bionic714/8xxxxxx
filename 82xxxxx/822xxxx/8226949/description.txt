Show description:
Canadian Screen Awards 2013 Pre-Show hosted by Sean Majumder and Martin Short.

CAPPER NOTE:
There were some glicthes during the broadcast of the pre-show, with some segments repeating and even stuck on a loop. I edited to the best of my ability. If any glitches remain, this is how it was broadcast, not a bad encode.

The pre-show did not have a proper ending.  It went to commercial and suddenly came back to the main show.

I was certain scene group 2HD would catch this.. but it's been 3 days and nothing has shown up.  So... here you are!
