Canadian Screen Awards 2013
Airdate: March 3, 2013


Show description:
The Academy of Canadian Cinema & TelevisionΓÇÖs new CANADIAN SCREEN AWARDS recognize excellence in film, television and digital media productions.


CAPPER NOTE:
There was no official welcome announcement at the beginning of the awards show.. it came back from commercial, and in flies Martin Short to open the show.

There's a few cracking/static noises in the broadcast. Not many, but a few here and there.  They were in the broadcast, not an encoding issue.

I was certain scene group 2HD would catch this.. but it's been 3 days and nothing has shown up.  So... here you are!
