Do you dare find out what's happening behind the counters of your neighborhood fast-food joint?  Then grab a bucket and dive into one of the creepiest graphic novels of the year!  
Supersized:  Strange Tales from a Fast-Food Culture is an entertaining-and at times gut-wrenching-series of stories focusing on America's ubiquitous and potentially destructive fast-food culture.  A perfect companion to Super Size Me, the graphic novel will bridge the gaps between humor, fact, and heart, while peering behind the scenes of the fast-food world.
