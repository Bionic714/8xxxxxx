From the Animal Collective Mixcloud sessions, in anticipation of their "Centipede Hz" album release, this is the 1st Transmission, mixed by Panda Bear.

Each week a member of the bandΓÇöPanda Bear, Deakin, Avey Tare and GeologistΓÇöwill take turns hosting their own show. TheyΓÇÖve also curated a mix of friends and collaborators to guest spots throughout the transmissions. This weekΓÇÖs show was hosted by Panda Bear and featured guest DJ sets by Black Dice, Sublime Frequencies and Haunted Graffiti. It also premiered the new Animal Collective single, TodayΓÇÖs Supernatural, and two new Panda Bear instrumentals.

In his mix, Panda Bear rides a wave of sample-based hip-hop by seminal jazzheads like J Dilla, Madlib, and 9th Wonder (on Little BrotherΓÇÖs ΓÇ£Say It AgainΓÇ¥), peppered with new school electronic jams by the likes of Zomby and AraabMUZIK. The Sublime Frequencies hour is a transmission of foreign radio from Damascus to Bangkok and everywhere in between, surfacing musical gems that may never have been heard if it werenΓÇÖt for this set. You can listen to the entire first show on a live loop at radio.myanimalhome.net.
