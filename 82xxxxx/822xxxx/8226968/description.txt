Release Description

Designing a website is indeed a job that takes a lot of time
if you wish to build something really nice looking, but there
are a lot of software solutions out there meant to help you
in this regard.

WYSIWYG Web Builder is an application created to be used
mainly by beginners because you don't have to be proficient
in HTML to use it. Everything can be controlled with your
mouse, so there's no problem if you're not into coding too
much.

The application supports most things you usually see on the
Internet such as forms, banners, Flash video players,
captchas, images, buttons, YouTube content, photo galleries
and so much more.

Of course, it all comes down to the users and their needs
because WYSIWYG Web Builder can rise up to the expectations
and help in any regard, as long as it's addressed to web
designing.

The interesting thing is that the program even comes with
PayPal eCommerce integration, which means you can place a Buy
Now button on your website, or all the other PayPal
utilities, such as View Cart, Subscription, Donation and Add
to Cart.

Just as expected, since we are talking about a rather powerful
application, there are a lot of other handy tools in there,
such as the page weight viewer to see the size of the page
elements, sitemaps, link checker, search index and extension
manager.

That being said, WYSIWYG Web Builder is certainly a product
that is worth trying. The strong feature pack and the ease of
use make this software suited for all users and the output
meets modern standards, so it may very well be considered one
of the top picks in its category.
