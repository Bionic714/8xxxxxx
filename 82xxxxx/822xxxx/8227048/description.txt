This is a DTS 5.1 conversion created from a remastered lossless FLAC source utilizing a test version of the SPEC method (ArcTan mode) as found on www.surroundbyus.com.

Only playable on home theater equipment and PC software capable of decoding a DTS signal. Otherwise, you will hear static.

Notes and disclaimers:

It is not recommended that you downmix these tracks to stereo, transcode them in any way, or make any changes other to them than how they are presented here.

If you are not a fan of stereo-to-surround conversions, while I do recommend giving the SPEC mixes a chance, if it is not your intention to do so, please respect those who do get enjoyment out of these mixes and do not troll or flame on my, or anyone else's, posts.

Had this sitting around and, though sheer trial error, found an anomaly in which I was able to reach some pretty crazy levels of vocal and instrumental separation, and just ran with it. If you're going to own one Dolly album, unironically, this would be it. Much better in surround than it has any right to be.
