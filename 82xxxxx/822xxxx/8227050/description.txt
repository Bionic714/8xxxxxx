Artist: ABC
Title: The Lexicon of Love (SPEC DTS-MA 5.1 by DKA) (SBU)
Release Date: 1981

This is a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 conversion, in AVCHD format, created from a hi-rez vinyl rip source utiiizing the SPEC method (ArcTan mode) as found on www.surroundbyus.com.

To play the full lossless 24/96 stream, you must utilize a Blu-Ray player and receiver capable of decoding a DTS-MA signal. Those without a DTS-MA receiver will still be able to play a 24/48 core DTS stream.

For those who cannot play a disc in AVCHD, there is brief document included in this torrent as to my own process in extracting mono wavs from discs like these in order to create a disc in another multichannel format.

Notes and disclaimers:

It is not recommended that you downmix these tracks to stereo, transcode them in any way, or make any changes other to them than how they are presented here.

If you are not a fan of stereo-to-surround conversions, while I do recommend giving the SPEC mixes a chance, if it is not your intention to do so, please respect those who do get enjoyment out of these mixes and do not troll or flame on my, or anyone else's, posts.

Second time I've done this album. The first was one of my more popular and well-regarded conversions at the time. What's different here? First one was pre-SPEC, this uses the best vinyl rip of the album available out there, and you're getting it in lossless DTS-MA this time around. Worth a new listen.
