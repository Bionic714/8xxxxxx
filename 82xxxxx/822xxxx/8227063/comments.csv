,emii__,2013-03-07T05:07Z,"thanks for taking the time to upload each update, my thanks to you! you are the best, is a very useful addon, and not all people have the money to buy it, really thanks for sharing! :D"
,bcxanth,2013-03-07T06:37Z,"Is this just the trial version?  Because what I downloaded with this torrent only has the trial version guides in it.  If I overwrite my current zygor with this the version number changes so WoW recognizes it as updated, but none of the guides for the new content get added."
,freecia,2013-03-07T07:24Z,"Yea, this upload is borked but I'm sure a new one will be up in a bit.  I can't tell you how pleased I am that Raikalo is keeping these coming.  "
,van46,2013-03-07T09:00Z,Thanks Raikalo!
,ludedeedz,2013-03-07T10:18Z,"This version says that it's a demo version, 6015 version works as intended when you enable out-dated."
,bondfan102,2013-03-07T12:10Z,Thanks ^_^
,koordir,2013-03-07T17:50Z,"Thanx as always Raikalo rules! However, this upload is nog complete. 11,41MiB? 

I would go for 4.0.1015 until a new release is uploaded..."
,Raikalo,2013-03-07T19:10Z,"Must've been a bad build, apologies for that. I'm uploading the fixed version of .6034 now."
