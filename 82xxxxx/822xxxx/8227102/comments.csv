,phelpz,2013-03-07T05:43Z,Is this real?  It's been up for an hour with no comments yet.  No one else has episode 6 uploaded yet.  Please comment and let us know!
,tdawg2345,2013-03-07T05:54Z,"no skull, no download"
[V],QborT,2013-03-07T06:16Z,"it's legit.  If you are unsure just check a release listing sites like sceper, vcdq, rlslog, or any of the others."
,jibbajabbax,2013-03-07T06:39Z,"Dear ""tdawg"", a rather obtuse method of determining what or what not to download.  I prefer to use my own common sense in determining what or what not to download, based upon the substance of what is included in any individual torrent.

Fear not, Mr. T has pity."
,ubiknik,2013-03-10T02:02Z,The plot description describes episode 5 and this came out before all the other episode 5s. The poster who said 'it's legit'  and the upper gots some 'splainin' to do cuz this was commented on by the uploader as well BUT NOT CONFIRMED AS EPISODE 6 -noone else has episode 6 so how did jibberjabber get it???
,ubiknik,2013-03-10T02:06Z,nevermind. I was seeing 5's and thought they were 6s -good thing I'm not playing blackjack
,ubiknik,2013-03-10T02:09Z,Of course I meant seeing 6s and thinking they were 5s. either way my bad. THX! Hey anybody see that great 'call me batman' video on the Pirate Bay!? ...it made me spew chunks
