The inmates at the ASYLUM continue with a new breed of horror. This anthology features "Jacked In" by Frank Forte where a programmer gets double crossed by a greedy girlfriend and he gets his sweet revenge. Part 1 of Tim Vigil's new "Survival Extinction Z" a post apocalyptic horror tale (with Joe Vigil and Jeff Vigil). Part 2 of "Ruined Earth", Billy George's tale of giant worms and armageddon. In "Ecce Homo" by Darren Sellars and Patrick Shanahan, a race of creatures, almost machine-like in their brutal efficiency break free from the confines of a two-dimensional world and begin a relentless assault, wiping any and all resistance from its path. In " Transformation" by Marcin Ponomarew, a desperate man takes an injection. In "The Connection" a mad doctor tries to find the source of another voice inside his head, by Forte. Another tale of The Doctor and Boris and the horrid inmates. A great collection of disturbing tales for the discerning horror fan.
