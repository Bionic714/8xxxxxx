Frank Fizzle wishes his writer father would have just a single original idea, but instead Jasper Fizzle sees himself as the new 'Royal Historian of OZ' as he insists on writing new OZ stories. When the failed writer discovers that Oz really exists, he makes an error in judgment that brands him a criminal in two worlds. Can Frank save the day and redeem the Fizzle family name, or will the drizzly ghost of the Wicked Witch of the West destroy them all?
