,uneedabiscuit,2013-03-07T06:27Z,Why has no one else uploaded tonight's episode? this is an awfully big file for a 40 minute show. Appreciate the upload nonetheless.
,mantikor777,2013-03-07T09:29Z,"@uneedabiscuit - your realize it is HD - 720p, right?  There are several out there at 480p that run around 450 MiB.  Get one of those if you feel this is too big for you.  Don't complain about the one good HD file on TPB."
,humpahoe,2013-03-07T13:47Z,uneedabiscuit is a fucking idiot. how do these morons even find their way here?
,trixi50,2013-03-07T16:23Z,"humpahoe and mantikor777 - try being nice little buddies....uneedabiscuit is just asking a question. Since he was here before you, perhaps this was the only file at that time.  Use your fucking braincell and get over yourselves already."
,jmtdjmtd,2013-03-07T18:01Z,"yes, the idiots commenting here are humpahoe and mantikor777. the other guy just has different needs, and at the time this was the only upload."
