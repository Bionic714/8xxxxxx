Jason has been prophesied to take the throne of Thessaly.
When he saves Pelias from drowning, but does not recognize
him as the man who had earlier killed his father, Pelias
tells Jason to travel to Colchis to find the Golden Fleece.
Jason follows his advice and assembles a sailing crew of
the finest men in Greece, including Hercules. They are under
the protection of Hera, queen of the gods. Their voyage is
replete with battles against harpies, a giant bronze Talos,
a hydra, and an animated skeleton army, all brought to life
by the special effects wizardry of Ray Harryhausen.
