while it technically isn't a marvel now title with the trade dress on its cover, age of ultron will cross over into fantastic four, superior spider-man, avengers assemble, wolverine and the x-men, uncanny avengers and fearless defenders. so here's a link to that:

I wasn't so sure how I felt about Marvel NOW! after Avengers vs X-Men came to its pretty lame conclusion, but I'm very pleased with the way the Marvel Universe is unfolding right now. :)"
