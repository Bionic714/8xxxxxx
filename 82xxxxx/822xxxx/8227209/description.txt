Kung fu master Chen (Lau Kar-leung) is tricked and his hands crippled
by the villainous gangster and brothel-keeper Tuen (Lo Lieh), who also
forces his sister (Kara Hui) into prostitution. No longer able to
practice the martial arts, he becomes a lowly street entertainer,
performing with his beloved trained monkey Ah Mao. Monkey (Hsiao Ho)
is a petty thief and meets Chen and the two begin an odd friendly
relationship until Tuen's men slaughter Chens pet monkey, causing
Little Monkey (Hsiao Hou) to try and take revenge for him. Monkey is
trained by Master Chen and believes he is strong enough and leaves
Master Chen. He goes into the streets and fights Tuen's money
collectors. He easily defeats them all and soon he is led to Tuen.
Monkey confronts Tuen initially and gets beat, Miss Chen helps
Monkey escape but is killed by Tuen, forcing Chen to take revenge
for his sister. Monkey returns to Master Chen shamefully and tells
Chen about the meeting with his sister. Chen gets angry and goes to
fight Tuen but Monkey reminds him that his hands are crippled and
the Monkey Fist won't be as effective. Chen, reluctantly, agrees and
trains Monkey more and then Monkey comes back to the brothel to fight
Tuen again. He gets pass all the men but gets trapped. Chen appears
and saves him and they fight side by side. After that, Monkey engages
combat with Tuen and soon gets the advantage. Tuen, seeing that he
can't win tries to escape but Monkey doesn't let him and takes his
hands. He smashes them into glass to cripple them, the same as what
Tuen did to Chen. After that, it seems Monkey is done but then he
says he also wants to avenge Chen's sister and kills Tuen.
