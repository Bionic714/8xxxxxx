This was recorded for Tara in 1978 I think. Tara sold the rights to Carsten Linde's record company Wundertute in 1989 and they added the bonus track of "Bonny Woodhall" which Mick Hanly in 1977. Dónal Lunny produced it and I don't remember too much about it. It was recorded in Windmill Lane Studio, Dublin just before Planxty got back together for the "After the Break" long, long tour.
I was really lucky to be able to get such a star cast to play on it.

Not sure it was a great idea to stick the first three tracks together, segueing from one to the next. I like them all but it meant that, later that year, Dónal and I were playing them as one long piece in Germany and Holland. Changing instruments and banging hardy gurdys off microphone stands as we tried to keep the mood going for about 12-15 minutes.

"Longford Weaver" was one I used to do with Paul Brady. There's a great live recording of us doing it in Rotterdam somewhere. I was going to do "Ballymoney" with Dónal on bouzouki and me on mandola and Paul on guitar but Paul got a notion to play piano. Trouble with pianos is that their like elephants in the room, they just don't need or want anything stringy like a bouzouki to be playing with them! (Unless you happen to be Leroy Carr and Scrapper Blackwell)

"The Romanian Song (Blood and Gold) is nice, though I think I should have sung it myself. It's in 5/16 as it was supposed to be. Anybody who recorded it subsequently didn't quite get that and recorded it in 6/8. Pity...

I like "Rainy Sundays" very much. Ah Vida! What ever happened to you?
I had been impressed by a band called 'Metropolis' and decided to use the musicians from it on this track. Keith Donald had just been to the dentist to have a tooth out and his mouth was a bit numb - not the best preparation for playing the soprano sax! You'd never know it, listening to him play though.
