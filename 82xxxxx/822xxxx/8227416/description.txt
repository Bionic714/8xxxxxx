OUTLAW TENNIS

Step onto the tennis court with the cast from the Outlaw series of games. You can choose one of 16 playable characters with different attributes, and then you can participate in six gameplay modes, including exhibition, tour, and drills.

Everything you need to play the game is here, PCSX2 v 1.0 + BIOS + Plugins.
I have included my setup pix to help you out.

As a bonus I have also included a small pool game called: Billiards Xciting(PAL)25mb compressed.

if you're playing these on PC, it really won't matter what bios region you select, but if you have any issues just pick another bios.

Extract with 7zip, or Winrar and follow the simple instructions, pretty much common sense for most PC users.
