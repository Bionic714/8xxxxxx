Stop tagging your re-encodes with ""Blu-ray"" fooling people, call it ""BRRip"" instead. And it was so hard for you to leave a THX comment at my release and to mention in description the source-
Also you're so welcome to use my subtitles on which you worked so hard.
http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7902130/James.Bond.Complete.Collection.1962-2008.1080p.BluRay.x264.anoXm is your other pathetic ""Bluray"" re-encoded from my http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7784749/James_Bond_Complete_Collection_1962-2008_BDRip_1080p_DTS_HighCod release...and many more. Not once you said a thx, If you want to show off with Blu-ray torrents encode them from Blu-ray, not from encodes.

He can't stand critisism so imidiatly had to his crap to my torrent http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8229300/The_Veteran_2011_BDRip_1080p_DTS_multisub_HighCode
I didn't link here my torrents to make publicity but to show folks what the source is.
I don't expect from a moron to say thanks for downloading my torrent, nor to mention in your description what the source is but be genuine and tag your torrents as BRRip, not Blu-ray."

Thx for this excellent rip :)""

Lol, you do enjoy licking your own ass, that's why you need multiple accounts to fool your ""costumers"".

BDRip (or Blu-ray) is encode from BD (Blu-ray Disc)
BRRip is re-encode (from BDRip) and stop fooling people, end off story!"

THXfor all greats rip over so many year !

Highcode rips is useless because off hers encoder settings it wont be able to play it with regular standard players! :(((

Keep UP the good work :)"
,bobbyGa,2013-03-08T18:27Z,"@highhorse 
who gives a fuck if they are re encodes or not. 

We download them cause they are great quality and not very large in size.  Some people may prefer your version, but personally I don't have the storage or bandwidth for your 35GB version! even if it's Star Wars.

we're all on the same team here guys.."

,onlyHD,2013-03-08T19:12Z,"@HighCode :It's a known fact that 99% of the movies around here are re-encodes. Compelling to change the name of torrent description is childish. If that is your wish then, contact the moderators and request them to create a new category so called 'BluRay' and 'brrip'.

 Act like a VIP pirate and don't be a troll. You are around TPB for like 10 months. But it's been more than a year Zen started to upload anoXmous rips and anoXmous has been uploading in TPB more than 8 months before you could do your first one. So before accusing them take some time, calculate the facts by reading their comments and you will get to know they are not same user.

And finally it's all ""free"" and stop ""criticizing""."
