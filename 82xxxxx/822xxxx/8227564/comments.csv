also if have a better nonSUB version of the SciFi channel old docu perhaps share it as the one I found is also only 240p !!!

a few LQwebrips are 240p sadly but watchable on laptop atleast.. 

(USE VLCs video sharpener.. really makes a difference also)"
[V],psspss,2013-03-07T09:09Z,i meant arent seeding them in above descrption 
,SativaCyborg,2013-03-07T09:48Z,"I usualy dont log into my account on here, but I just wanted to say thanks for all the torrents you put up man. I'm a huge ufo/ghost/monster/ect buff and I think I dl just about everything you put up and seed them for days. Just wanted to say thanks and let you know geeks like me really appreciate it!"

I must admit im enjoying the congress presentation

wish someone would leak all the 2012 congress ones by now and maybe some 2013
its all about money though not releasing the info freely"
[V],psspss,2013-03-07T10:12Z,"sadly not many download my ufo collections any more.. their loss

I noticed the coast to coast ones werent favoured

im really only listen to 10 myself.. and some are funny and weird but some are very good indeed

the one called web predictions sadly i see the end was chopped so I have a new copy to put up in the next ufo news bundle..

it dont say but covers the Needles ufo incident.. a very good listen.. all thats in it though just the web predictions clipped.. I will rename it a little to include the ufo discuss next time"
[V],psspss,2013-03-07T11:11Z,"hmmmm now wondering those ghost lights by stan are nano tech spy probes...

kinda suggest maybe ghost orbs etc could be alien tech or cloaking tech as I talked about in a comment in another torrent :) very interesting presentation.. I dont believe hes faking stuff seems to much evidence trail going on but
still why isnt some investigators hire the house over the road and filming the place no stop :)"
[V],psspss,2013-03-07T11:45Z,"the stan movie be worth getting.. dont think its leaked? but shows a clip here

,falafelface,2013-03-07T16:57Z,"Thanks for all the 'weird' stuff.
As far as Coast to Coast stuff, its always great to have all the daily current radio shows available, but compilations of past shows might be a bit of overkill because there's already so much content. idk"
,NaNaMoose,2013-03-07T18:49Z,"Thanks! Please keep bringing us the weird, unexplained & paranormal!"
[V],psspss,2013-03-08T00:10Z,"come on people seed.. some are leeching.. as I seede over 4gb now 100 percent plus and its still not seeded out..

this is a big hit on my data cap.. 20gb left for 12 days.. dont think its going to last my ufo bundles might have to wait until reset"
[V],psspss,2013-03-08T01:33Z,"
Is it not funny (strange) how ufo investigators and out spoke ufo people and people researching free energy often die in weird accidents and deaths

[V],psspss,2013-03-08T01:35Z,"best ones to watch first Abducted, and stan romanek
and touched (audios drifts out middle and end but drifts back in.) and dairies and confessions are good

still getting to the rest myself"
[V],psspss,2013-03-08T09:45Z,"
i see another 10 jump on to grab it.. think they a bit late and may not get it now as most of the http tracker seeders have gone from 14 to 5
not everyone connects to udp sharers"
,gza6,2013-03-08T12:04Z,Thanks for these Documentaries Psspss you have to approach anything paranormal with an open mind. I've never experienced anything paranormal but I'm fascinated by it and don't judge people who tell convincing accounts of what they have experienced. Hoaxers however are easily identifiable and can go fuck themselves for all I care Lol. Interesting stuff way better than scripted reality shows. I'll keep seeding for as long as I can.
,doctorhjorth,2013-03-08T15:54Z,Thanks for all your great Work! wash the most of it :) gretings from denmark
