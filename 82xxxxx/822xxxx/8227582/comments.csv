[V],TheExecutive,2013-03-07T10:32Z,No cue file is needed to hear all the tracks in succession.
,Bill50x,2013-03-07T11:36Z,"I never save the cue-files, what's the use oft them? Usually both tags and filenames indicate trackorder, isn't that 'nuff?"
[T],rjordan21,2013-03-07T12:09Z,"^^^ I think people look CUE files these days to validate the files.  I ran the folder through Audiochecker:

,WasAtWoodstock,2013-03-07T23:44Z,"Which version is this? It has 17 tracks. The Wikipedia link provided shows a 14 track and an 18 track version.

Or in other words, which country is this from? Is this the German edition?"
[T],rjordan21,2013-03-08T11:52Z,"^^^from that same link....

""The DELUXE EDITION will include three additional bonus tracks (four on the Japanese edition).""

14+3=17"
,diamonddogs,2013-03-14T21:37Z,"Thanks for the deluxe version in FLAC,it sounds awesome."
,majstorKvaris,2013-03-23T14:27Z,"Great torrent, thanks!

Still keeps me wondering how could we have Deluxe edition of ""The Next Day"" a week before its launch. :)"
