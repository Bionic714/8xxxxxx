,winrrpgx78,2013-03-11T11:08Z,I also needed to get part 3 of the update to get the game to work.  With just these 2 the game kept crashing on startup.  Everyone's setup is different I guess.
,PTycoon,2013-03-15T14:27Z,If its crashing just reinstall then copy these files :3 it must work if not then something is wrong with ur comp i beat the game 4 times :)
,Texasboi88,2013-04-01T03:10Z,maybe I did it wrong but this fix fucked up my game. I am unistalling and going to re-install the game. I was looking for a update because of a glitch in the game. on the boat in the beginning I end up kinda walking on water and cant see half the boat of get where I  need to go
,PTycoon,2013-04-12T17:30Z,"If u use other cracks on same game thats can be a problem,but i beat the game and i found only some small in development bugs like tree collider nothing like this what u said..."
