Thank-you for your kind words!

To everyone: It would be great if you could seed for a while once you have the full collection. I'm currently uploading at ~100kb/s and we seem to already have about 30 people leeching. Also, I will try to keep this seeded for at least a month, but there will be times when I will be without Internet (mainly for school). Even if you are getting unbearably slow speeds, keep the download going, though, because there will definitely be at least a 7-8 hour continuous seeding period overnight every day. Share the love!"
