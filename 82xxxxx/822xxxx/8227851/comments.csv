Can you tell us the required firmware (OFW and CFW) and game id (something like BLES01138)
I think these information should be included in torrent summary."

Works perfectly on Rogero 4.30 from internal HDD.
From external HDD it takes some time loading songs and stuff."
,babak160,2013-03-09T01:03Z,"The games works fine while ingame but
before ""Press Start button"" if you leave the game for 10~20 min it will freeze in loading screen.
can someone else also check it out?"
,negro_diva,2013-03-10T07:41Z,"The game does indeed load properly, but there will be a loading screen of indefinite duration when attempting to play ""World's End Dancehall"" (ワールズエンド・ダンスホール). 

Hopefully this gets resolved soon as it unlocks ""Unhappy Refrain,"" ""Sadistic Music Factory,"" (unlocked by successfully completing the first 30 songs including ""Unhappy Refrain"" and ""World's End Dancehall"") and ""Continuation of Dreams."" (unlocked by successfully completing ""Sadistic Music Factory"")."

The ""Install Data"" option did not fix this."
,kenneth20748,2013-03-14T02:36Z,I was kinda wondering about that too. If I should move it to the internal HDD because external load times are the worse. I'm on the latest Rogero and Multiman btw.
