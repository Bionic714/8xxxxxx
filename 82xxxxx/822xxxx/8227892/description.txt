A group of damned souls discovers how chess is played in hell, when two succubi, Chalyss and Menyssan, decide to have a game for fun... with the souls as pieces!
They soon learn that pieces are eaten once captured. And to their dismay, Chalyss' side quickly realizes that their succubus is a complete beginner, not at all on Menyssan's level, as she is a very seasoned player! They have to help her out in order to not end up in her rival's belly.
