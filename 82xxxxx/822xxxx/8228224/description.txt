 : Set in the fictional town of Port Bonita, on Washington State's rugged     :
 : Pacific coast, West of Here is propelled by a story that both re-creates   :
 : and celebrates the American experience--it is storytelling on the grandest :
 : scale. With one segment of the narrative focused on the town's founders    :
 : circa 1890 and another showing the lives of their descendants in 2006, the :
 : novel develops as a kind of conversation between two epochs, one rushing   :
 : blindly toward the future and the other struggling to undo the damage of   :
 : the past.                                                                  :

 : An exposition on the effects of time, on how something said or done in one :
 : generation keeps echoing through all the years that follow, and how        :
 : mistakes keep happening and people keep on trying to be strong and brave   :
 : and, most important, just and right, West of Here harks back to the work of:
 : such masters of Americana as Bret Harte, Edna Ferber, and Larry McMurtry,  :
 : writers whose fiction turned history into myth and myth into a nation's    :
 : shared experience. It is a bold novel by a writer destined to become a     :
 : major force in American literature.                                        :
