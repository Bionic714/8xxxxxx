 : In this disquieting cyber thriller, Joseph Menn takes readers into the     :
 : murky hacker underground, traveling the globe from San Francisco to Costa  :
 : Rica and London to Russia. His guides are California surfer and computer   :
 : whiz Barrett Lyon and a fearless British high-tech agent. Through these    :
 : heroes, Menn shows the evolution of cyber-crime from small-time thieving to:
 : sophisticated, organized gangs, who began by attacking corporate websites  :
 : but increasingly steal financial data from consumers and defense secrets   :
 : from governments. Using unprecedented access to Mob businesses and Russian :
 : officials, the book reveals how top criminals earned protection from the   :
 : Russian government. Fatal System Error penetrates both the Russian         :
 : cyber-mob and La Cosa Nostra as the two fight over the Internet's massive  :
 : spoils. The cloak-and-dagger adventure shows why cyber-crime is much worse :
 : than you thought--and why the Internet might not survive.                  :
