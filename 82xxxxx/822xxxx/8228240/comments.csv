,NeverAce,2013-03-07T16:19Z,"Ignore my post, Something must have happend during the install, reinstalled it and it works."

,Chiitah,2013-03-07T23:36Z,"So is the Keygen working okay for you guys?

All it does for me is quickly flash up a MSDOS program which shuts itself.

So I wanted to make sure it was working for you all and it's just me?"
[V],esharoth,2013-03-08T07:55Z,"It works on Windows XP/Vista/7 and I see no reason for it not to work on Windows 8 as well. 

What OS are you using?"
,Chiitah,2013-03-09T00:06Z,"Vista - but that's okay I just wanted to make sure it worked for others.  I've seen various versions of this file at different sizes so I didn't know if it got cut off or something.

If it normally works for other people than it probably really is just me - my PC is doing funky things recently.

I'll run the file on another PC here and write the code down from that one, but thanks :D"
