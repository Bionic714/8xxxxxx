 : Imagine an England where all the pubs are quaint, where the Windsors behave:
 : themselves (mostly), where the cliffs of Dover are actually white, and     :
 : where Robin Hood and his merry men really are merry. This is precisely what:
 : visionary tycoon, Sir Jack Pitman, seeks to accomplish on the Isle of      :
 : Wight, a "destination" where tourists can find replicas of Big Ben (half   :
 : size), Princess Di's grave, and even Harrod's (conveniently located inside :
 : the tower of London).                                                      :

 : Martha Cochrane, hired as one of Sir Jack's resident "no-people," ably     :
 : assists him in realizing his dream. But when this land of make-believe     :
 : gradually gets horribly and hilariously out of hand, Martha develops her   :
 : own vision of the perfect England. Julian Barnes delights us with a novel  :
 : that is at once a philosophical inquiry, a burst of mischief, and a moving :
 : elegy about authenticity and nationality.                                  :
