The Daktaris, whose name means "doctors" in Swahili, were an Afrobeat revival group based in Brooklyn. The group no longer exists today, though some of its members have gone on to be part of Antibalas Afrobeat Orchestra.
As Peter Franklin of Abidjan Musique says, "The Daktaris is a well-disciplined army of two hundred African Bull Elephants marching relentlessly up your business to the beat from Funky Drummer."
