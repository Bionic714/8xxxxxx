,Nightwing1945,2013-03-07T15:44Z,"Thanks again STF, appreciate all the work you do....

2 thoughts/requests:
Now that Lady Death 22 suddenly showed up this morning, it might be nice to put 18, 19 and 22 out together for people to complete their LD collection.

Also, a random request:  I'm looking for Ultimate Civil War: Spider-Ham and having no luck.  I found one in Spanish, but no English.  If you have it or can find it, I would greatly appreciate it.  

Thanks again."

Nightwing1945, i'm hoping LD 22 will bring our friend back and blackcanary can finally fill the 1,000,000 requests for ""the missing issues"". lol

i'd rather get 00-25 and torrent them all. and i should probably get back to work ...  ;-)"

Nightwing1945, the reason why Spider-Ham was in the Marvel Zombies torrent is because he accidentally crossed over into Earth-2149 (the Marvel Zombie universe) and became ""Undead Ham""."
