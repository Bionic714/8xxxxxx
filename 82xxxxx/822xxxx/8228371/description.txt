P.S: The scratchy and the popping sounds on the song "You're All The World Me" means that it is on a vinyl record. And its supposed to sound like a song from an old movie. As so explained, I just don't want some nasty and crappy comments. Thank you so much!

Say thanks! And don't forget to seed and comment! :D
