Mere Apne is a 1971 Hindi film produced by Romu, Raj, and N. C. Sippy and written and directed by Gulzar. It was Gulzar's first directorial venture and was almost a frame by frame remake of the National Award winning Bengali film Apanjan, which was directed by Tapan Sinha.

Anandi Devi (Meena Kumari) is an old widow who lives in a village. One day she is visited by a distant relative, Arun Gupta (Ramesh Deo), who persuades her to live in town with him, his wife Lata (Sumita Sanyal), and a small child. She later realizes that they were looking for a maid which results in her expulsion from the house and befriending a child beggar who takes her to his dilapidated home. Being good-natured and caring, she slowly earns the title of 'Nani Ma' (maternal grandmother) among groups of youths led by Shyam (Vinod Khanna) and Chaino (Shatrughan Sinha) who were in constant fight with each other. The movie ends with her death from an accidental gun fire in one such clash.

This movie has some melodious songs:
"Koi Hota Jisko Apna"...Kishore Kumar
"Haal Chal Theek Thak Hai"...Kishore Kumar, Mukesh
"Roz Akeli Aayi"...Lata Mangeshkar
