NOTE:

 After releasing three EP's through the Record Makers label, Kavinsky has emerged as one of the biggest artists of the French electro scene. "ightcall", with over 30 million total plays, is currently smashing the French sales and airplay charts. "Nightcall" was produced by Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo of Daft Punk, and was the lead track from the soundtrack of the hit neo-noir crime film Drive. The brilliant debut album from Kavinsky, Outrun, was produced by rising French DJ/producer Sebastian, and is set for a February 25th release in the UK on Mercury Records.
