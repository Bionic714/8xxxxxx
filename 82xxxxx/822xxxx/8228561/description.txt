Hi,
I'm preparing to upload a huge travel guides collection (more than 20 GB).
Here is a preview for the torrent, which will probably be ready on Monday or Tuesday. This is only the folder of the guides to Spain, which includes books from the following series: DK Eyewitness Travel Guides, Frommer's, Hunter Travel Guides, Lonely Planet, Rough Guides, Petit FutÃ© and Golden Globe Journal.
To see the file list click on the number 46 located on the right side of "Files:" , underneath Other > E-books.
