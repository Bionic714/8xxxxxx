SAS Ultimate Guide to Combat

'I'm not going to teach you how to survive in snowy mountains with only a tea bag; this book will teach you how to fight and survive war in the 21st century.'--Robert Stirling, from the Introduction

In the tradition of John 'Lofty' Wiseman's SAS Survival Handbook comes a new combat handbook from a seasoned speical forces soldier. Whereas Wiseman initiated hundreds of thousands of readers to the survival techniques developed by the SAS in far-flung covert ops in Burma, the Middle East, Africa, and elsewhere, Stirling's focus is on fighting techniques for the contemporary soldier.

Stirling, a combat veteran of Northern Ireland, the Bush Wars in Africa, and Afghanistan, provides a fully-illustrated training-manual for combat readiness. This is the stuff they don't teach you in boot camp, but they damn well should. Stirling writes in a aggressive style that will appeal to the warrior in every reader. He also serves up first-hand anecdotes and advice drawn from operations that went well--and those that went wrong.
