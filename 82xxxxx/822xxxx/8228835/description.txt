Description:


Modification, very ... No, me very much gameplay. Remove children 
from the screen! This modification to its name, because the game 
brings MEAT AND krovische adds different types of fatalities (!), 
The ability to shoot the monster heads (and not only the head!), 
Lots of effects and change the sounds, some sprites and, most 
noticeably , the gameplay itself. Now, weapons require reloading, 
with a shotgun can shoot alternately every barrel - this and more 
causes that play becomes more complex, the game becomes more 
interesting, the game becomes more brutal!
