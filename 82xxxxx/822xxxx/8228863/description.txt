POtHS says: This is good for all ages.

Description:

Using a chronological presentation from Genesis to Revelation, God's Story is an outstanding and dramatic introductory overview of the entire Bible.  The stories and prophecies of the Old Testament lay a firm foundation for understanding the life of Jesus Christ in the New Testament.

It combines the effective method of storytelling, the use of artistic masterpieces, live footage and special effects.  God's Story is a production that bridges age groups and cultures and it is good for evangelizing or disciplining.  The Bible characters are brought alive by multi-talented Walt Disney starts, Actor Dean Jones and Artist Norm McGary.

 
Seed long and Prosper with Blessings from our Father. I have prayed to The Father, Bless all that Seed Long. (I have 4 year old active seeds out there, must be working for some folks!)

Ephesians 5:11
11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove (expose) them.
