,blogcb,2013-03-26T16:49Z,"It sounds like some of you have completed the download.  Could you confirm?  I've been stalled at 73% for several days and just waiting for the download to finish.  I'll be happy to keep my seed active for a while to help others complete the download, but at the moment, my files are incomplete.  Appreciate if anyone who has 100% of the download could seed it for the rest of us.  Thanks!"
