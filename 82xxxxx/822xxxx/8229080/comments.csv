**3/5/13 Patch**
And another patch!

Major Fixes
• Fixed startup crash caused by certain webcams that appear to Windows as controllers with hundreds of buttons.
• Fixed jittery high speed cutscene objects (like cars) when Hifi Sim is enabled.
• Fix bug with Overkill achievement not unlocking. This should unlock retroactively for anyone who already completed it.
• Fix bug with Protector achievement not unlocking. This should unlock retroactively for anyone who already completed it.
• Fix bug with beast Master achievement not unlocking. This achievement will need to be re-completed, but not incremental progress will save correctly.
• Fixed instructions to display proper controls in Rockmore UI.
• Additional optimizations."
