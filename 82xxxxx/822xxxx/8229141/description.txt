***COMPATIBLE WITH PATCH 5.2***

NOTE: 4.0.6018 (last upload) didn't work properly, my apologies for that. I verified this one myself.


Zygor Guides v4.0.6015, released March 6th, 2013. (Horde and Alliance)



Install instructions: 

1) DO NOT USE THE OFFICIAL ZYGOR LAUNCHER FOR ANY REASON.

2) Extract the .zip and drop the ZygorGuidesViewer folder into your WoW/Interface/Addons folder and overwrite the current installation.


Mac-Only install instructions:

1) Put the ZygorGuidesViewer folder in Hard Drive/Applications/World of Warcraft/Interface/AddOns.

2) (Optional) Open World of Warcraft, login, click the Addons button on the Character Select Screen, make sure Zygor is selected, and check the "Load out of date addons" box.



These uploads work just fine; if you are having problems it is on your end and not mine. Thanks!

Guide Viewer
* Fixed "secondary mode lines overlap".

* Travel fix: updates properly again when changing zones.
Other Guides
* Initial Isle of Thunder guide step modified to suggest doing Kirin Tor / Sunreavers dailies, if realm doesn't have the Isle stages unlocked yet.
