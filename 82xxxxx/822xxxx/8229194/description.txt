Land captured, the galaxy is on the brink of destruction, and only you can fix it. The cost of failure - oblivion. Your role - Captain Shepard, a character that you create yourself. Only you control how events will unfold, what the world will be investigated, and who will participate in the alliance, which you may gather, once and for all eliminate the threat of the Reapers. You drive this war, at its discretion: you can attack head-on, spraying enemy fire or a cunning plan to make a surprise attack. Collect versatile squad of professionals or browse the lone wolf.
