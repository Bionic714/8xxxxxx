[V],joshua13,2013-03-08T04:00Z," ""Obscenity has not really been about sex.."" I've read a bit on this subject. That thesis is certainly true in some cases, but it is an absurd statement as a generalization. To prove it requires knowledge of intent by the creators, which is rarely available. The science does not support this. Conclusions based on it are suspect at best. Further the fact that we have banned something in the past or present is no argument for continuing to ban it or  the concepts alleged to be embodied in it. The history of censorship is a sorry one, and the effects of lessoning it, have not led to the imaginary harms prophesied."
