[V],dhjudasx,2013-03-08T00:50Z,Troy is encoded i think here. Maybe i'll put it up soonish. Don't have forrest gump yet.
,Dzte,2013-03-08T13:26Z,Thanks again dhjudasx.I'm glad to get response from you on such a short notice.Keep up the good work.............you are a legend...you are the reason  why I'm switching from 720p to 1080p. You provide fantabulous quality in a relatively small size with two audio streams. RESPECT..  (˘⌣˘)ノ♥ヽ(ˆ⌣ˆ) 
[V],dhjudasx,2013-03-08T17:02Z,"thanks...

I'm still debating if i should drop the 2 channel AAC stereo and just stick with 5.1... someone told me that apple had updated a few devices that will not play it fine.. and one other device i had here that wouldn't play it will not after a firmware update."

I have read your comments on other posts as well and I would say rather stick 
to it(2 CH AAC) untill you check it yourself. You've a great experience and 
richer knowledge all cause of your fine research in the field. 
I found that appleTv supports Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound aka ac3 or DTS, although on apple's website
http://www.apple.com/appletv/specs.html 
Supported Audio Format includes AAC 
HE-AAC (V1), AAC (16 to 320 Kbps), protected AAC (from iTunes Store), MP3 (16 to 320 Kbps), MP3 VBR,
 Audible (formats 2, 3, and 4), Apple Lossless, AIFF, and WAV; Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound pass-through"
