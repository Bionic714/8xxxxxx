,BasilBrush,2013-03-07T20:10Z,The torrents are also cross posted to the NordicXplained blog (just google NordicXplained) and the JungleBoyNX twitter account. If TPB goes down you can still get the torrents from those places. TPB normally goes down on a Sunday evening due to the high amounts of internet traffic.
