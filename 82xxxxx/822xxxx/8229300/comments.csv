Thanks for linking your crap, at least people can understand who is the moron and why.
Zen_Bud re-encodes my and others's encodes then calls his ""releases"" Blu-ray"" LOL.
For those who don't know (including Zen_Butt) Re-encodes should be tagged as BRRip and not Blu-ray! But he likes to sell his donkey as horse on the market, it sells better lol.
I hope you'll be treated by those who downloaded your crap the same way you treated me, not saying a thx but calling you a moron."

People who watch those two re-encoded packs (James Bond & Star Wars"" will find out...when the last line in the subs will show up ""SubRip: HighCode"" lol. 
You just make a complete fool of yourself not admitting the re-encoding from my packs ha-ha.
You can't build a simple sentence, just insult using capital letters and copy/paste links, proving what an uneducated twat you are.
No  wonder you can't encode from BD because you're too thick for that :-)"
