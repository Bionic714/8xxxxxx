Wildest Arctic
Wildest Arctic explores four extraordinary areas of the arctic giving a unique insight into what life is like for animals trying to survive in these incredible habitats. The cameras capture life over the course of 12 months in the frozen forests of the Taiga, which contain one third of the world's trees. They also explore the arctic tundra, one of the coldest, driest places on the planet and home to hundreds of thousands of caribou. In later episodes, footage shows what life is like in the Arctic circle for the 'Ice Bears' and 'Ice Whales' and explores the country of Iceland; following the seasons and discovering the natural beauty of this country's rugged landscapes and hardy wildlife.




2)  Taiga: The Frozen Forests 
Containing one third of the world's trees, the frozen forests of the Taiga truly are the "lungs of the planet". This great forest spans right around the globe: across North America, Scandinavia, and extending across Siberia to the shores of the Pacific, sheltering some of the Earth's most majestic animals, and some of its most secretive.
This episode follows a year in the Taiga Forest. Our journey starts in the depths of winter. In the bitter cold and silence of the frozen forest, it is hard to believe that life can survive. All the animals that live in the frozen forests are specialists in dealing with the ice and cold. Wolverines roam far and wide in search of food, using circling crows and ravens to locate food. Lynx silently creep up on agile snowshoe hares and an Amur Leopard and her cub - the world's rarest big cat - face an uncertain future.
