[T],TeamExtreme,2013-03-08T05:54Z,"I would recommend not re-uploading or using the old Anjo Minecraft launcher because it was made over 2 years ago and is far out dated. The Anojo launcher is over 2 years old and was made back when Minecraft was in its beta, This is why you get the out of memory errors and your game keeps crashing.

The Anojo launcher was not made to run in an .exe which is why you cannot allocate the correct amount of ram or use a bat file with it."
