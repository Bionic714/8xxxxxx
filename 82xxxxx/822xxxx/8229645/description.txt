Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site :: On the Thursday, March 7 edition of the Alex Jones Show, guest hosts Aaron Dykes and Paul Joseph Watson discuss Rand Paul's historic filibuster in protest of drone strikes on American citizens (on U.S. soil) with no due process, mainstream media's attempted cover up of the massive DHS ammo buy and the latest Syrian crisis in which U.S. funded rebels have captured 21 U.N. peacekeepers. We'll also have an exclusive special report on Bill Gates from Melissa Melton, a talk on abortion and assault weapons bills from David Ortiz, and a review on various ways the federal government is wasting taxpayer money from Jakari Jackson.

Though still on vacation, Alex Jones called in today in the second hour with a 30 minute rant. [starts 5 minutes into hour 2]  He said he would probably also call in to tomorrow's broadcast that will be hosted by Katherine Albrecht.
