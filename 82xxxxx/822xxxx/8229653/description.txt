A couple of years back I got this and was asked to keep it to myself since it was a "master". I compared it to the one I had before and found it to be ever so slightly better but I honestly don┬┤t think at all that this is a mastertape, I also haven┬┤t a clue why I should keep it to myself since this show has been making the rounds for years. I remember some talk a while back about a real master that was supposed to blow any other versions away, but so far nothing has been released. I have heard numerous versions of this show through the years and this is the best I┬┤ve heard. If anyone has a better version, or that elsuive master, please post it for everyone┬┤s enjoyment as a reminder of how good this band was.
