after 2 years of playing around in the studio with new sounds and techniques, the album, laughing buddha bass, is finally ready to go! please feel free to download a copy and share this with your friends. go on, dont be shy, it was made with and is given with love.

the first part is 74 minutes of deep space dub music, subsonic rumblings, glitched out melodies and frequencies from other dimensions.

the second part of the album is something quite unusual. with this recording you can learn the ancient meditation technique of feeling the touch of your breath, called anapana sati. you can put the mp3s onto your phone or laptop and listen with headphones. once you are comfortable with the technique you can use the meditation timer on track 2 to practice whenever the opportunity arises. mediation is a very practical exercise that help you to move from a mode of thinking to a mode of feeling. the benefits of this in your daily life are unbelievable.
