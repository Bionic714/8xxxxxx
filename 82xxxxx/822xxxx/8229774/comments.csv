,Chartsandgrafs,2013-03-08T04:08Z,"Thanks for this one, man.  Sliver was totally unexpected.  I never even realized Nirvana filmed a video for that song.  Two versions of In Bloom also rocks.  Thumbs up on this history of pop and rock music lesson!

Would you mind filling one more request?  I'm looking for any and all White Stripes (The Hardest Button to Button especially) and Strokes videos (Hard to Explain especially).  I'll put you at the top of my Christmas card list for those.  I'll even refrain from pestering you for a full month."
