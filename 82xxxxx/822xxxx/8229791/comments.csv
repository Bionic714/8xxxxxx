1. The aspect has been messed up, the top and bottom have been cropped off to force it to look like widescreen. Go look at a fullscreen version and see just how much picture has been cut off of this. Plenty of it has been cropped off.

2. A filter or something they used cause ALOT of color bleeding in the shape of blocks over the picture. Heres a screenshot to see what I mean. Look at his face for example and see all the blue bleeding over and colors out of place.

That cubed color bleeding is all over the entire movie.


If it werent for those 2 major factors right there, this would be a great copy, it looks good other than those 2 things."
