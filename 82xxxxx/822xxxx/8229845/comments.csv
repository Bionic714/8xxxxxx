,koltbolt,2013-03-16T05:33Z,"When a movie opens on a plot fudge and in the 1st sequence that allows a complete stranger/non relative in to a hospital room to see the child that was hit by a car, you kind of know the callibre of the film you are watching. Hospitals would never strangers in to the childs room, I mean this woman could be suicidal....  Oh wait, was't she just about to blow her brains out before the accident???? Gonna take a lotta faith to believe this crap. "

,ChasUGC,2013-04-22T22:56Z,"This is one of the most touching movies I have ever seen in my life. The ending scenes tell how this is based on a true story. You see the original black man and white woman together.

I know that in this day and time, a story like this may be hard to believe. But, if you open your heart, like you do when you hold your child, you will see that love is truly unconditional and boundless.

Thanks for the upload, scene4all.
