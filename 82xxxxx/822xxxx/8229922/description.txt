This 1961 episode was a TV sequel to a radio sketch that the cast
had done 15 years earlier, when Jack wrote a silly love song entitled,
"If You Say I Beg Your Pardon, Then I'll Come Back to You" which he
tried and failed to get published many times. This joke was again used
as the premise of the Peter, Paul, and Mary episode two years later.
