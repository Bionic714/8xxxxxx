It's telling that Richard Marx broke into the music
business singing backup vocals for Lionel Richie 
and writing songs with Kenny Rogers and Chicago, 
for he kept to the straightforward, 
middle-of-the-road approach of those acts once he 
became a recording artist in his own right--not 
that there's anything wrong with that. 
A dependable hitmaker throughout the late 
'80s and early '90s, Marx scored with rockers 
("Don't Mean Nothing," "Should've Known Better"), 
and ballads ("Right Here Waiting," 
"Endless Summer Nights") alike. 
Greatest Hits collects those songs as well as the lion's 
share of his high-end chart action--of which there was plenty, 
proving that a devotion to craft sometimes pays off better than fickle inspiration
