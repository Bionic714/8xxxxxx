,orginal76,2013-03-08T17:33Z,"Hello. Sir, can you give us a new Zaxwerks plugins for After Effects. Thank you."
,armavista,2013-03-08T22:39Z,"Thanks!
Too bad the packs and Max for live are not included.
Therefore i would not tag it ""Suite"".
Can someone share the complete Ableton Live Suite?"
,pwulfe,2013-03-09T04:42Z,"Max 4 Live is a free dl on their website, just go get it, you don't need a torrent -.-"
,pwulfe,2013-03-09T04:52Z,nvm i now understand what you mean by max wasnt included
,Shorouk,2013-03-13T22:02Z,@ironearth Thank you so much man !
,rainbowfied,2013-03-19T18:21Z,"DOES THIS HAVE MAX FOR LIVE?
HOW DOES THIS COMPARE TO THE 64BIT VERSION
CMON GUISE, SRSLY FOLKS"
,simox6660,2013-03-20T23:12Z,"Download and find out, it's free!!!!"
,Guitarmarc47,2013-03-24T22:56Z,this is bullshit and doesn't work for 32 or 64 bit and Max isn't there either...don't bother wasting download time for nothing......
,Insanexyz,2013-04-04T15:26Z,"Don't believe Guitarmarc47, the dumbass. Both the 64-bit and the 32-bit versions work and Max for Live is a free download on the Ableton website."
,oldmate13,2013-04-10T04:50Z,how come i cant save projects or export audio?
,obediate,2013-04-18T07:13Z,"So guys, new here, do i just drag all the stuff into my program files or what? i tried that and it asked me to authorize, be cool is someone could give me some specific instructions :D"
,obediate,2013-04-18T08:11Z,"Nevermind, figured it out, one more question though, all my categories folders are empty, eg audio effects, what do i do about this?"
,jpaganas,2013-05-02T23:19Z,"Hey, saving and exporting are deactivated. How do I activate it? because honestly that's like 90% of the reason i downloaded it."
