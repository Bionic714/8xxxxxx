With some luck it will features some scenes that Victor Hygo never even dreamt of when writing it, like Jean Valegan being a black belt and kicking ass through out and just maybe getting his hands on a gattling gun maybe at the end of the film and killing bad guys by the hundreds!"
,swine666,2013-05-20T18:49Z,"Oh and and forget to add, that after all that went down and all the guys that die, Jean Valegan saves Kosette's life just so that she can became a slut just like her mom and get knocked up with another baby so that it can start all over....and so the long day wears on!"
