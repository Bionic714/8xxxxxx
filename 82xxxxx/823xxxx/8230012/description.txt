A serial killer stalks Chicago.
A gorgeous cop is on his trail.
And someone else is watching, someone who will decide who lives... and who dies.

The Angel of Death in Chicago oversees all people in the city, making sure their deaths fit their lives. But when a gruesome serial killer strikes, the Angel must make a startling choice. He falls in love with the cop on the killer's trail, and has to choose between divinity and humanity. But to do that he must face the biggest terror of all - who he really is.
