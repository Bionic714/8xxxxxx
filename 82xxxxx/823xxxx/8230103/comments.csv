,macomaniac,2013-03-08T06:15Z,"IMHO, the «Waste of Time» doesn't consist in the fact the app. is not 'cracked', but in «Waiting Something Useful' from that crap. Numerous are the complaints of guys who have innocently deleted, using that very harmful tool, vital 'System-files' of their OS and are condemned afterward to re-installing their system. The obsession of 're-gaining space' on a Mac disk has not to be satisfied that way, but rather through un-installing useless apps. and transferring amounts of documents on External Hard-Drives. 'Cleaning' an OS has nothing to do with deleting system-files, but in performing 'Maintenance' of the system. For such a task, the free app. 'Onyx' is all one has to use on a regular basis."
