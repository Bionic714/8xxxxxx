[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-08T02:13Z,"degu2012, TPB is for everyone. you post whatever you feel like posting. i think new compilations of the ultimate titles are great contributions. you could also do the ultimate comics iron man miniseries. do some more torrents whenever you feel like it."
,Oneiromancer12,2013-03-08T02:19Z,"Can you upload Joe Casey's Wildcats 3.0 and Automatic Kafka? It'd be greatly appreciated.

Also, Judas Coin OGN by Walt Simonson would be a great upload...just saying :D


Thanks for all the awesome comics!"
