,arcirl,2013-03-08T09:55Z,"Alright so everything seams to have downloaded right. I extracted the files onto my C drive, and then i installed the setup.msi. It installed fine, but the program will not start up for me to finish installing or turn off the updates."

,mercuryhk,2013-03-12T05:38Z,"Thanks Ching, no problems with installation! I thought this was suite though? how do we get all the sounds, even the intro version has more than this"
,thedman93,2013-03-12T08:45Z,"I keep getting an error about the installer not being able to access a pitched down steel drum. I've tried installing several times with no luck. Help?

Win 7 x64"
,SolFire7,2013-03-13T05:43Z,"@thedman93

before you extract the setup .rar file make sure your directory is no longer than 260 char..
ie. rename/shorten the file/files that .rar is in

hope this helps

,Sibling7,2013-03-13T17:25Z,"Thanks everything worked great, i definitely recommend JBridge, get the DL through Piratebay, works without a hitch, run Jbridge, select the 64bit option, make sure u go into your 64bit plugin folder, and make a new folder called bridge, (do this before hand) then Jbridge will ask you to select your 32bit vst folder, select it, and then it will ask you to select the new folder, go and select that bridge folder you made, then when your done....go into that bridge folder and just cut and paste everything into the 64bit folder.....hope thats not confusing! and if youve used ableton before you know how to scan for new VST's your done!!"
,ZombieVaccine,2013-03-15T20:37Z,WORKS PERFECTLY. Thank you Ching_Liu and R2R for this awesome torrent!
,piratebay_pete,2013-03-16T00:23Z,"To those having problems with missing files and failed installation, do the following:

1. After torrent finishes downloading, RENAME the torrent folder from 

""Ableton Live 9 Suite 9.0.1 (64 bit-R2R) [ChingLiu] "" 

to something short like ""setup""."
,barcapuyol,2013-03-18T00:46Z,Does this work 100 procent ? is it full version or is it just a trial version ? do you get the whole sound library when you download it ? please answer me dear firends!
,Rubikz91,2013-03-18T21:25Z,"If you are unable to install because of a failure locating the detuned drum or such error message, do this:
1. Delete the Ableton 9 setup64 folder you made from the extraction of the winrar folder (DO NOT DELETE THE ORIGINAL RAR FOLDER!).
2. Double click the Ableton 9 setup64.rar folder
3. The new window opens, drag the Setup folder to you desktop and run the Setup from inside it.
4. (It will probably tell you in the installer that you need to rename the start menu path. Just add a number 2 or whatever after Suite.)
5. Enjoy"
,kurac84,2013-03-19T09:29Z,"So I installed this without uninstalling my live 8, the problem is next...every time I use x64 live 9 with x64 plugins it uses more CPU than live 8 with 32 bit plugins. It takes so much CPU I get audio clicks and glitches, drops out...
I have to set my latency to 512, which makes it impossible to play, but that too does not improve things much

I got win7x64 cpu x4 3.4 ghz and 8 gb ram, also rme soundcard

PLS HELP!!!!!"
,rainbowfied,2013-03-19T18:20Z,SO DOES THIS HAVE MAX FOR LIVE OR NOT
,KonamiCmd,2013-03-19T22:29Z,"Can someone please post some coherent and comprehensive instructions? I'm getting really antsy to try this, but I'm waiting for someone to explain in an intelligent way how to do the installation process seamlessly without any hitches. Btw, thank you Ching_Liu for the upload. "
,Track-AddicteD,2013-03-21T15:42Z,"WHY THE FUCKING FUCK SHIT FUCKING FUCK ARENT MY PLUGINS SHOWING UP???? IVE TRIED FUCKING EVERYTHING, IM NOT A NOOB AT THIS SHIT EITHER, I CAN'T BE THE ONLY ONE WITH THIS ISSUE? ANYONE????"
,meekrab124,2013-03-23T19:53Z,"This is great n all, until the trial runs out. Where in the fuck can i get a cracked version?!"
,meekrab124,2013-03-23T21:46Z,"Doesn't have all the sounds, and doesn't seem like a true crack, just a trial version that you disable the updates for. "
,anipse,2013-03-27T18:47Z,"@Track-AddicteD

Me too. Happened the same thing."
,omgkilden,2013-03-31T21:18Z,"Seems to work fine, except the delay compensation.

Try and send something to one of the return channels. Do they fall out of sync?

Over here it does... Maybe I have to go back to 8. :/"
,anonimos1980,2013-04-08T18:52Z,where i find convolution reverb and new drum synthesizer instruments inside to ableton ?

,swopyl,2013-04-14T21:15Z,"I got it working finally.

Seems like it downloaded the update before I unchecked ""look for update""

uninstalled it, reinstalled it. Works fine :)."
,Thetic2,2013-04-15T15:06Z,Thanks swopyl.
,cloversativa,2013-04-28T22:35Z,"Works fine. Doesn't need crack. Just remember to turn off the Updates before you do anything! Thanks for the torrent, Ching_Liu!"
