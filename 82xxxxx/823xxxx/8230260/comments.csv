,ukjmtbe,2013-03-10T16:08Z,From this download my ISP sent me a waring from 20th Century Fox about Copyright Infringment.   A warning that required my ISP to terminate my service if repeat offenses occur.  
,joegi50,2013-03-11T07:33Z,"20th Century Fox and greedy studios cannot prove about your torrent. The only thing they can see is you browse Pirates or torrent site with IP address from your service provider or Pirate itself. It means next nothing. Challenge them.
Unfortunately, you have to pay $35 to dispute because these cronies bought politicians. It is criminal activities to monitor your link without court warrent. "

,Dorell,2013-04-19T01:05Z,"Here’s another well-known fact about President Abraham Lincoln:
The Emancipation Proclamation freed the slaves, right? Well, no.
The Proclamation, issued by Lincoln on January 1, 1863, proposed
freeing slaves in the Southern states only—it didn’t mention ending
slavery in the North. Even Lincoln’s secretary of state, William Henry Seward,
saw the irony in this and stated, “We show our sympathy with
slavery by emancipating slaves where we cannot reach them and holding
them in bondage where we can set them free.”
Before he issued the Emancipation Proclamation, Lincoln threatened the
South by saying if they didn’t rejoin the Union, he would abolish slavery.
They didn’t, and he had to follow through with his threat—but it was
an empty threat because the South had already seceded and Lincoln had
no authority over it. Lincoln’s real reason for the Proclamation was made
very clear in a letter he sent to the New York Times:
My paramount objective in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not
to save or destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any
slaves, I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all slaves, I would do
it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone, I would
do that."
