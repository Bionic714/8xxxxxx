I was just curious when I seen it marked 9 books because there are only 8 books in the Nina Wilde/Eddie Chase  series. Temple of the Gods and Return to Atlantis are the same book Return to Atlantis is just the US name and Cult of Osiris is named Pyramid of Power in the US. 
He did just release a new book The Persona Protocol. It's not part of the series but still a great book. "
