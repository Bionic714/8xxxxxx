1931: Scheherazade at the Library of Pergamum
Long Live the Queen

Scheherazade is a game made by makers of Academagia, a stat-driven interactive novels fill with text and stats. Older example of its genre is King of Dragon Pass. The contemporaries of it are mostly Japanese Interactive Novels. The game is about a girl in 1931, having adventures "Capers".

Long Live the Queen is nearly the same, but made by different game developers. About a young Princess in preparation to ascend the throne. You will pass the days to learn skills, experiences adventures, learning forbidden magic... all in preparation for the day of crowning.

The both of them are really hard to find because usually games of that genre has heavy elements of sex thrown in, but both these two dont have that. So they dont attract much attentions from the usual suspects to do a crack or torrent. It's a bloooooooody long times for full version of the games to appear on Net.

Anyway, try these, they are free. If you like it, consider buying it from the developers to support them. They are both indie developers so your support mean a lot to them. It's not like they are AAA studios with money to burn.
