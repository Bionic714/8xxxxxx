This episode from late in the 1963 to 1964 season was actually
Johnny Carson's second appearance on Jack's show, after guesting
some 9 years earlier. The joke about him being a CBS page in 1952
is a false premise because he had his own TV show then "Carson's Cellar".

I also included a bonus clip from You Tube : ex-Jack Benny Program 
radio cast member Phil Harris roasting his old boss in 1969 !
That particular Friar's Club event was emceed by Johnny Carson.

Phil also appeared on one of Jack's TV specials in the early 70s.
