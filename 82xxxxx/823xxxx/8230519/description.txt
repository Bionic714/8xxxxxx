Three armed robbers, Harry Rawlins, Terry Miller and Joe Pirelli,
die when the security van that they are robbing catches fire in
the Kingsway Tunnel in London. Their widows, Dolly Rawlins,
Shirley Miller and Linda Pirelli, find their husbands' plans for
the robbery and decide to stage it themselves. They enlist the
help of a fourth woman, Bella O'Reilly and succeed in making off
with the cash. Then Dolly learns that her husband didn't die in
the robbery. And now he wants his money back...
She uses Harry's famous "ledgers", a cache of books detailing all
his robberies over the years, to find the details of the failed
robbery, and, enlisting the help of a fourth woman, Bella O'Reilly
(Eva Mottley), they resolve to pull off the raid themselves. At the
same time, they discover the "fourth man" in the raid escaped -
leaving their husbands for dead. Dolly must contend with the police
and the gang, as well as her fellow widows, agitating for vengeance.
Widows concluded with the widows successfully pulling off the raid,
and escaping to Rio. In the final scenes, however, they discovered
that the "fourth man" was in fact Harry Rawlins (Maurice O'Connell)
Dolly's husband.

Widows was followed by Widows 2 in 1985. The second series saw the
widows return from Rio to track down Harry Rawlins, revealed at the
conclusion of the original Widows to be the surviving "fourth man"
from the original raid. Harry is determined to pay back the widows
for staging his raid, and the widows have a score to settle with
him for running out on their husbands. For this second series,
Debby Bishop took over the role of Bella, after Eva Mottley had
died from a drugs overdose.

Widows 2 was followed by She's Out in 1995. The third (and final)
series began with Dolly Rawlins' release from prison after serving
a nine year sentence for the murder of Harry, her husband. She
teams up with several other parolees and make plans to stage a
train robbery on horseback. Dolly's new companions in crime were
- Ester Freeman (Linda Marlowe), Julia Lawson (Anna Patrick),
Gloria Radford (Maureen Sweeney), Connie Stephens (Zoe Heyes),
Angela Dunn (Indra Ove) and Kathleen O'Reilly (Maggie McCarthy).
