Keiko, the daughter of a legendary sushi chef, runs away
from home when his Karate-style regimen becomes too severe.
Finding work at a rural hot springs inn, she is ridiculed
by the eccentric staff and guests, including the employees
of a pharmaceutical firm there on a work retreat. But little
do they know that a disgruntled former researcher has also
come to the inn with a plan for revenge, using a serum he
developed that can awaken the murderous instincts of ordinary
sushi, turning it into bloodthirsty monsters! Keiko must use
both her sushi training and her martial arts skills to save
the others and defeat the flying killers. Director Noboru
Iguchi known as the "Japanese Quentin Tarantino"; starring
Rina Takeda of "High Kick Girl" and "Karate Girl"...
