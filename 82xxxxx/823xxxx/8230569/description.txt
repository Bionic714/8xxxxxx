The Village That Never Sleeps is a furry visual novel project currently in development.

This is the playable first demo, a proof-of-concept build if you will, simply to demonstrate the intent of the final project, and to build interest in the project. 

This demo follows Vincent, a cat from the big city, who is moving to the town of Woodcrest in search of work, and to reunite with his old college buddy, a Coyote named Diego.
