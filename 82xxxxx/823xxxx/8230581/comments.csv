,mhtorrent,2013-03-10T02:38Z,Thanks for the upload blackcanary.  Great series.  It was actually Willingham's attempt to finish the storyline he had going in Elementals but wasn't able to finish.
,LyokoMx,2013-03-15T03:17Z,"Hi blackcanary, another request (please) apparently there is no (live) torrent with the Amazing Fantasy v1 #16-18 written by Kurt Busiek, hope you have them. Thanks in advance."
