[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-08T16:11Z,"here are a few project suggestions if you need any. take your time and seed what you've already u/l'ed ... it's a lot of comics!  :-)

,Nightwing1945,2013-03-08T18:23Z,"....and thanks degu for all the great stuff so far, keep it up!!"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-08T19:06Z,"thanks Nightwing1945, jeez why didn't i search for that?! lol"
,degu2012,2013-03-08T23:54Z,"hey i haven't really got that much spider-man i'm afraid stopped reading it around ""the other"" storyline (what a load of bollocks that was) so i'm not the best option for spidey i'm afraid. will be upping new mutants later today."
,tdurden83,2013-03-09T04:18Z,fukn nice upload. thank u degu.
,dbranson17,2013-03-09T18:24Z,why aren't any of you scumsuckers seeding this?!
,dbranson17,2013-03-09T18:29Z,"@degu2012
when you do these fantastic collections (thanks, btw) you've gotta zip them into a single archive so the self-involved lurchers can't pick and choose issues and then bail without seeding after they've got what they wanted..."
,degu2012,2013-03-09T19:41Z,"@dbranson17, hey i know this is taking its time to d/l but if i zip the files then i'm just going to end up with muppets complaining that i've zipped them. i put these up here in this format for the specific purpose of people being able to pick and choose. the decent and proper users of thepiratebay will show proper etiquette and seed so bear with it and you'll get it eventually. i'm going to be seeding this for another month(apart from the occasional break to d/l the walking dead lol)  but i hope you all enjoy this anyway."
,tdurden83,2013-03-12T20:20Z,"I'm still seeding the whole torrent too. I liked this collection better than the one I had, so I downloaded it all. it took a little longer to finish, but I had plenty of stuff that I haven't had time to read to keep me busy"
,MagicMaker,2013-03-14T02:57Z,"Thank you thank you! With the way Marvel's series go, it can be really hard to track down all the appearances of your favorite heroes, so a batch like this is a godsend. I really appreciate it!"
,Shogun970,2013-03-23T12:16Z,Thank you so much :)
