,Theigor1337,2013-03-24T17:49Z,What is the difference with unrated and normal in this movie? Any hot stuff? ^^
,mohawkm,2013-04-18T19:06Z,"Very good quality on video and audio!  

I'm not sure it's true 720p, though.  This fits on a dual layer dvd.  Would that play any less clear than a bluray of the same size?  It plays crystal clear on the 15"" media player on my computer, but more blurred when full screen at 23"" on my monitor.  I can just imagine when I view on a 42"" TV.  If this is just my newbie issues, please ignore, but I'd appreciate any feedback.  Doing my best to seed also with my crappy upload speed.  "
