,amitverma,2013-03-08T07:10Z,"Comes like a fresh breeze for this weekend!!!
Thanks man, you are an ICON :)"
,nginx,2013-03-08T07:18Z,Please do the 1080p encode and use atleast 2000kbps bitrate. Any lower bitrate and it looks horrible for 1080p.
,jaysync29,2013-03-08T09:46Z,"Awesome... Thanks man..
was waiting for this.. "
,jaysync29,2013-03-08T09:47Z,Can u upload Django unchained??? thanks 
,elvecinodearriba,2013-03-08T10:18Z,"YIFY is on a roll the past 2 weeks, maybe the Blue-rays arrive to him faster after the Oscars. I will wait to 1080 though for Lincoln and Les Miserables. Great work man!"

,highresjunkie,2013-03-09T17:00Z,"Here's a quality low file size 1080p since YIFY hasn't posted one yet:

http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8234939/Lincoln_%282012%29_%5B1080p%5D_x264_-_Jalucian"
,highresjunkie,2013-03-09T17:02Z,"@nginx: Unless you're watching on like a 50"" screen, thats not true. 1800 bitrate is plenty enough to look flawless on a computer sized monitor. None of YIFY's 1080's show any flaws and most of them arent quite 2000. Plus, there's several other settings that affect quality. It's not all bitrate bitrate bitrate. That's a very sophomoric understanding of encoding."
,zeneeth,2013-03-10T22:38Z,Thanks.
,hifi447713,2013-03-11T05:17Z,1080p

,FentonSpadrig,2013-04-13T15:07Z,"Nice quality.

This is a crappy movie however. I guess that all patriotic americans really love this one. I, however, can not really see the goodness in this. Its pretty boring and really fucking bad... "
,tiz2,2013-04-27T19:52Z,"A: 5 v: 5, Not really hd, too low bit rate"
,veezjunk,2013-05-24T02:35Z,"Lincoln gets shot at the end!

HAHA spoiler"
,lior146,2013-06-06T23:39Z,Fox is all over this file and sending legal notices. Consider yourself warned.
