Fourteen works by Eric Voegelin. Most are pdf, but quality varies widely.

1. Anamnesis - Converted to pdf from html; html file included in the torrent; minimally formatted.
2. From Enlightenment to Revolution - new pdf, based on older scan; I've cleaned up the previous version considerably.

The following are from the Collected Works - Quality is near-retail unless stated otherwise; in almost every case I've made improvements to the pdf as I found it, usually at least by adding the contents to bookmarks.

3. The Authoritarian State (CW4)
4. Modernity Without Restraint (CW5) - Alas, this important volume, which includes The New Science of Politics, is a very poor scan; it seems to be a web-rip and pages in the last section are seriously defective; many are simply missing. I've included it anyway for the sake of completeness. The first two sections are at least readable.
5., 6., 7. Published Essays, 1934-1965 (CW9, CW10, CW11)
8. Selected Book Reviews (CW13)
9. History of Political Ideas, Volume 5 (CW23)- This one is another conversion from html, and the html file is included here as well as the pdf.
10. History of Political Ideas, Volume 7 (CW25)
11. Hitler and the Germans (CW31)
12. The Theory of Governance and Other Miscellaneous Papers 1921-1938(CW32)
13. The Drama of Humanity and Other Miscellaneous Papers 1939-1985 (CW33)

Also included is one article:
14. The Philosophy of Existence: Plato's Gorgias

I have not included The New Science of Politics (except as part of the badly formed CW5) because existing scans that I've found are all defective -- missing pages and marred with underlining, etc. I'm repairing the book now and will upload when I'm finished.

I'll also be uploading some books about Voegelin soon.
