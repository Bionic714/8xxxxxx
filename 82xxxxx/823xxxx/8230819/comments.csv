,fasurvivor,2013-03-08T09:49Z,"thanks

are you gonna upload Twilight Saga 2008-2013?"
,bandwagon,2013-03-08T16:52Z,"Is this film worth 11 GBs? Or should I download the 720p?

Thanks for the upload!"
,demotrix,2013-03-09T20:40Z,"This is great, all your torrents are great. Keep the good work coming. Props."
,Dreadlokz,2013-03-10T13:33Z,Tyvm!! Seed~
,joegi50,2013-03-10T19:34Z,"Thank you BOZX. It is simply great from you. Friendly reminder: if it is possible, please use full screen, not widescreen. We all have HDTV and great content deserves beautifully done encode and fast torrent from BOZX "
,highresjunkie,2013-03-12T14:06Z,"Bandwagon, there are 1080s of this that are 2-2.5gigs. Why BOZX chooses to make his bitrates so unnecessarily high is anyone's guess. Maybe his target audience are all the people who can afford 60"" HD screens but NOT afford to buy bluray discs. That would make sense, considering how large that group must be....lol Unless a source is unusually grainy, a video bitrate of 1800-2000 is all you need to maintain picture quality on a 1080p on a ""normal"" sized screen (meaning any computer screen or standard size television.) I really wish I understood what people were thinking when they go overkill on the bitrates like many of them do. Do they have a specific reason for this, or do they just not understand that its overkill?  Anyway, I came here to say something else and ended up responding to someone else's comment first. What I came back here to say was this: 

There's something very fishy going on with this file. It plays fine, but if you try and re-encode it to a more reasonable size, the last few minutes get cut off and don't encode. I ran it twice to make sure, but with chapter markers left on, and turned off. If you try and re-encode this, the movie ends about 10 seconds before the closing credits, just before it fades to black after Lincoln's last speech. IDK if this was a copyprotection measure that somehow got duplicated when it was encoded or what, but it's very strange. If anyone plans on re-encoding after downloading, this is NOT the torrent you'll wanna use."
,jalucian,2013-03-12T14:14Z,"joegi50 - That isn't possible without butchering the film. The aspect ratio is chosen by the people who make the movie (it's shot that way) and the only way to alter a widescreen to a full screen is by hacking off the outer thirds of the picture and stretching the rest of of it to fill the screen. I never understood why people don't seem to get the widescreen concept. It's not that you're seeing LESS because there are black bars at the top and bottom - you're seeing the whole thing. When you see LESS is when you hack up a widescreen aspect ratio as you're requesting in order to ""fill out"" the top and bottom. Full screen aspect ratios are NOT desirable because you have a decreased viewing area. In my experience, the only people who prefer full screen over widescreen are the people who don't really comprehend aspect ratio."
,heartlesspoet,2013-03-13T00:46Z,thks for upload
,___k,2013-03-13T02:07Z,"highresjunkie: BOZX encodes don't show banding or pixelation on a good quality screen. Watching them is a pleasure, where as lower bitrate encodes (I.E. YIFI) are often very visibly of inferior quality, which is distracting when immersed in a good story. However, they are more compatible with a wider variety of devices...

As they are both consistently in the top seeded uploads for any video, they both seem to have their place & fans."

Yes I have 60"" 2000$ TV. 

Your name should be ""lowresjunkie"". "
,sleepy180,2013-03-15T03:05Z,"@highresjunkie

You're crazy. There are plenty of people like that, including myself.

I have a 65"" panasonic plama TV that I use to watch these on. I only buy blu-rays if they are my favorite movies. I download these high bitrate movies because they look better for when I watch a movie for the first time.

You see downloads like YIFY that are advertised at 1080p that look like absolute shit or dont have 5.1 audio. Thats great for people watching movies on their phone or 17"" monitor, but not for anyone else.

Keep up the good work BOZX, there are people who support your work. People who despise YIFY and their so called 1080p shit rips."
,highresjunkie,2013-03-15T14:41Z,"Sleepy180, thats just it. I would guess that 80% or more of the people downloading are watching on normal sized TVs or computer monitors. The fraction of people watching on huge screens is virtually negligible. YIFY's encodes as just as flawless as BOZX's when viewed on the kinds of screens that the vast majority of people use. Someone like YIFY is actually a more valuable contributor because his encodes are perfect for most people, where this guy's are not since they are an extreme waste of hard drive space and bandwidth. Listen, if a handful of people are glad that these ultrahigh bitrate encodes exist, fine... but please don't try and act like this is what MOST people want or need because it just aint so. YIFY has the right idea - MOST people don't need bitrate overkill or 5.1 audio, and MOST people appreciate keeping the file size to a minimum without sacrificing any quality (which is true when viewed on normal sized screens.)"
,highresjunkie,2013-03-15T14:45Z,"And Lebada3, youre a fucking idiot. One doesnt need a huge screen to see a difference between 480p and 720p. I don't even own a TV and watch everything on computer, and I don't settle for anything less than 720p. Apparently youve never noticed the size difference in the viewing window when you watch a 480 compared to a 720 on a computer? The 720 will fill up most of the screen and anything of lower resolution only takes up about 1/4 of the screen. Ignorance is the only thing that would cause someone to say something that stupid."
,SiLENT_RiP,2013-03-16T03:57Z,"To all of those bitching on one side or the other, please STFU. If you can't take advantage of real HD video then don't download this torrent, go get another, lower bitrate rip. I do that often for films I don't expect to like enough to buy, and there is nothing wrong with that.

For those like me who have large screen TVs (I have a 73"" in my living room) and that want to see close to true 1080p, uploads like this are pure heaven.

To each their own, and stop bitching about other folks not being just like you. We're all different and have different needs, so I'm just happy I can snag a 700Mb quick rip OR a 6-8Gb 1080 rip, depending on my wants at the time.

If you're really unhappy here, even with all the choices you have, then kindly STFU and go elsewhere.

I promise we won't miss you."
,newline1,2013-03-20T17:58Z,please people seed all i got is 114.7 only please help :(
,Ronalds550,2013-03-25T07:03Z,"@ highresjunkie 
 Please stop going around to every torrent page and talking shit about how people who upload the highest quality videos are evil people because of how much HDD space is needed and that they are forcing you to download it by posting it. Just because 80% of people downloading don't really care doesn't mean that the other 20% (whatever %) should have to deal with lower quality stuff just because you cant see the difference or think it can't be that big of a difference...

If you don't like the higher quality stuff then go for the 2GB versions. The whole point of uploading higher quality videos along with other quality levels is to give you a choice. And going around talking shit about it when you can just go download what you want is dumb, annoying & immature.

- Oh. And thanks BOZX for the upload! :-)"
,letitbe123,2013-03-31T15:36Z,i have 55 sony brava and bozx uploads looks better than anyone yify is great but bozx  for me
