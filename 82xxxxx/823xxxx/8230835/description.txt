Summary:

When Thomas wakes up in the lift, the only thing he can remember is his first name. His memory is blank. But heΓÇÖs not alone. When the liftΓÇÖs doors open, Thomas finds himself surrounded by kids who welcome him to the GladeΓÇöa large, open expanse surrounded by stone walls.

Just like Thomas, the Gladers donΓÇÖt know why or how they got to the Glade. All they know is that every morning the stone doors to the maze that surrounds them have opened. Every night theyΓÇÖve closed tight. And every thirty days a new boy has been delivered in the lift.

Thomas was expected. But the next day, a girl is sent upΓÇöthe first girl to ever arrive in the Glade. And more surprising yet is the message she delivers. 

Thomas might be more important than he could ever guess. If only he could unlock the dark secrets buried within his mind. - Goodreads Summary of The Maze Runner (Maze Runner #1)
