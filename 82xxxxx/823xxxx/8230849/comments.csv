,chrisroberts3,2013-03-09T13:36Z,What version number is this? Version 2.1 or is it lower? 
,420mutt,2013-03-12T18:20Z,"Thanks alot for the upload.  Makes installing this a breeze without having to install all those HUGH ASS patches.  It's version 2.1.  A note when installing the option to install the HD Pack, it looks like it's not there but at the top of the list where you select options to install, you will see a tick box with the word ""messages in it"" that is the HD Pack.  Make sure to check it if you want the HD Pack installed.  Hope that makes sense and thanks again for the upload!   :P"
,spiraloof002,2013-03-13T06:13Z,does this have all the dlcs? 
,420mutt,2013-03-13T17:27Z,"Yes it has all of the DLC with it.  You may get an error when unraring it(something about long file names), but it still installs and plays great!!!  Thanks again for the upload!"
