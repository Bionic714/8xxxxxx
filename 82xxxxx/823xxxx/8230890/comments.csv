,bluejay21,2013-03-13T22:57Z,"For those that ask why YIFY's torrent sizes are so small, it's because the quality is way worse than torrents of bigger sizes. Just fyi."
,FureeTutawk,2013-03-14T06:45Z,"@bluejay21 ... DUH! lol. Hey, if I had a huge widescreen HD TV with all peripherals I wouldn't be a cheapass downloading decent, watchable torrents for free. On the other hand, some people want huge giant files of extremely high quality because they are SELLING them. Make your own if you don't like it ;-)"
,mawriz,2013-03-14T10:01Z,How's the audio guys? What are the sound specifications?
,pragette1,2013-03-15T20:53Z,"audio: mpeg aac, english, 48000 Hz.
Everything awesome, great subtitles.

Thank you for uploading this great movie.
Hollywood did an amazing job. One reason why this movie is so great is of the just incredible songs/lyrics of the original musical!

You need to shut up and realize that the world does not revolve around you. Who cares if you don't care for YIFY's small-sized 720p torrents? Judging by the seed and peer counts, there's CLEARLY a market for his rips. And who says these people are ""uninformed""? Most of us know what YIFY's rips are; we know they're not true HD, but they're still better than DVDRips (there's a huge difference in picture sharpness, I've made comparisons myself). I, for one, usually download YIFY rips if the movie doesn't have to be in true HD (in my opinion), like getting a YIFY rip of The Perks of Being a Wallflower, and then getting a true HD rip of Avatar. His rips helps me save hard drive space.

What's so hard and painful about ""searching truly HD material,"" anyway? You claim that YIFY torrent peers are ""uninformed"" when, clearly, it's the other way around. YIFY rips are mostly in the 700 MB to 1.5 GB range (the latter for films like Les Miserables). If you want ""truly HD material,"" sort the torrents' order by SIZE, genius. It's not that hard.

P.S. This is my first comment. Your comment pissed me off so much, it reeked of entitlement, I just HAD to create a TPB account."
,GODSEL,2013-04-26T16:40Z,Thumb up for YIFI and exon47 for your comment ;)

Spoiled the movie didn't I? Haha! Fuck You!"
,mb_webguy,2013-06-05T19:04Z,"@Kona_Guy:  No one likes an asshole.  They're always full of shit.

By the standard scene naming convention, ""Brrip"" specifies the *source* not the quality.  You could have a 480p Bluray rip, if you ripped it from a Bluray, which would be better than a 480p Dvdrip because it started with a higher-quality souce.  But it would still be a 480p video.

The video quality is primarily determined by the resolution and bitrate, which directly relates to the file size.  The standard naming convention includes the resolution but not bitrate since the latter can be roughly estimated from the file size, even if it's not specified in the info. If you think a 1.3GB video is going to be Bluray quality just because it's labeled a Brrip, it's only because of your ignorance of both the scene and video encoding."
