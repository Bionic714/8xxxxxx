The recipes are described in American and European measures (lb/oz and cups, Kg/g and spoon or metric system) making it easy for anyone to read and follow the recipes. The illustrations are very nice and the recipes cover both Vietnamese and Cambodian cuisine: many are simple to make and already brings great satisfaction to your palate. Some are more complex (making stocks can be an adventure) and very flavorful as well as inspiring. By the way, for the stocks, don't be so impressed: preparing one day the pork ribs (needing to boil first in water), save the water for a later stock for a delicious soup. Same for chicken (all stocks preserves great in the freezer anyhow so don't be scared of playing).

From a few combinations, I started to make recipes within the spirit of the cooking of the countries so, this book is very educational beyond speaking of the introductory overview of the Vietnamese and Cambodian cuisine and ingredients).

It provides a fantastic education about typical ingredients and the culture of Vietnam. The recipes have all been delicious so far and we have made quite a few. Nothing is too difficult and I was easily able to find the ingredients. I did have to go to the Asian market for one thing, but otherwise all were readily available
