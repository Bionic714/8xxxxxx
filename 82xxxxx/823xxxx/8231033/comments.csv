,libertaswv,2013-03-12T07:10Z,"i hate saying this, and i don't note it too be insulting. Sincerely appreciate the up.

After encoding/watching, i would have to agree that there are some a/v issues. It's a bit grainy/fuzzy throughout, and there are several points at which it got worse for a moment or two. The sound is a bit rough, and it fuzzes out on the high ends, especially when females are singing (like especially when hathaway sang). 

I should note that i have the file on another drive - 1 i can't access at the moment, so all of this is based on my encode of it. Burned it to watch at a friend's using an older version of ConvertX. I've never noticed a difference between the file and the encode (apart from obvious problems related to misburns/defective discs), but it's worth noting i s'pose.

Oh, and this may be down to either the encode or some issue with my tv, but the subs came out giant (half screen size) and super thin. I use subs all the time, and that's never happened - but i can't say for sure it's a bad sub file because i only have the burn to go by. But it's never happened with thousands of other subs in the past (had plenty of bad subs, but never half-screen size thin ones).

Alright... Sorry for rambling, just wanted to be clear.
