down multiplayer versus game. Dollar Dash will have you shouting for joy,
as you make a dash with the cash. You must attack, defend or outrun your
competitors in any of the three game modes (Dollar Dash, Save the Safe or
Hit'n'Run) using unique and comedic tactics.

Stand out from the crowd by customizing your character, upgrading your
favorite weapon, earning perks and unlocking achievements. You can't stand
