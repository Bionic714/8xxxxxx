"A Savage Symphony - The History Of Annihilation" is the ultimate value pack for every Destruction fan. Featuring the legendary Wacken 2007 show (with all current and former band members and the songs performed on 3 drum kits!), the DVD also contains an extensive history part. For the first time Destruction grant inside to the "inner core", with all former and current members commenting on the history and what it felt like to be part of the Thrash titans. As a bonus, a "behind the scenes" tour documentary, lots of video clips and other extras perfectly round out this amazing release.
