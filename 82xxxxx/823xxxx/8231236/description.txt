Until 31st of March you can find my releases on torrent sites like 1337x, after that I will only release my music in the "Special Edition Group" on Everyone can enter the group and is allowed to invite other Electronic Dance Music-lovers.
If you are interested in spreading my releases on torrent sites......just hop into the group, grab the stuff and make torrents of it. After 4 years non-stop 
releasing every weekend.......I`m done with it....... Releasing on torrent sites is too much time consuming for almost no appreciation. I have spend a lot 
of money to enjoy people all over the world.......Releasing in the group onis reducing the costs and way easier. It`s up to you now........Headdock Trance
