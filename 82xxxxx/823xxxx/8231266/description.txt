Canada 1812: Forged in Fire

History Documentary hosted by Craig Smith, published by High Fidelity in 2012 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

It may be the most misunderstood war in history. When Americans and Canadians needle each other over a few beers, both sides say the other started it. Canadians say the Americans were trying to take over Canada. Americans say they were trying to fight British oppression. Both sides claim victory. The facts, however, seem elusive. 

The War of 1812 gets very real and very personal with eqhd┬Æs six-part series. It points to spots on Canadian soil where blood was spilled and reveals heroes tragically unknown to our nation. 

The tale starts with personal stories, giving audiences a chance to go deep. It encourages the best experience of all: a personal one in the very spots where this nation took shape.

The shows are character driven, while showcasing current historic sites and infusing them with their natural history. The story flashes into the past with graphic novel artwork, making the story more dramatic and beautiful ┬û and the 3D effect even more arresting.
