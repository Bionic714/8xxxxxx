[...]

Of the album's seven tracks, each member contributes two, except for one by
Schuller. The overall mood is one of dark mystery and beauty mixed with a bit
of danger (and humor) supported by a pent-up, controlled power which can
explode at any time. While each of the tunes has a different kind of
architecture, the structure surrounding the freedom, along with its
development, is very audible.

The music is so strong from the first pedal point notes and bass squeals of
Ullmann's "The Shining Star," that the stage is set for high drama, creating
its own reality. The excitement reaches a fever pitch with the central, and
longest track by Fonda, ”Next Step," which begins with a driving rhythmic
pattern on the drums that is picked up by Fonda. Ullmann enters on bass
clarinet to play the eerie theme and the band is off. Toward the end, Fonda
takes a vicious solo on which he can be heard grunting and vocalizing his
lines—a truly inspiring track.

As he states in the notes, Stevens has every reason to be proud of Poetry In
Motion. It is a triumph from any angle.
