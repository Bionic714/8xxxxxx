Wildest Arctic
Wildest Arctic explores four extraordinary areas of the arctic giving a unique insight into what life is like for animals trying to survive in these incredible habitats. The cameras capture life over the course of 12 months in the frozen forests of the Taiga, which contain one third of the world's trees. They also explore the arctic tundra, one of the coldest, driest places on the planet and home to hundreds of thousands of caribou. In later episodes, footage shows what life is like in the Arctic circle for the 'Ice Bears' and 'Ice Whales' and explores the country of Iceland; following the seasons and discovering the natural beauty of this country's rugged landscapes and hardy wildlife.




3)  Tundra: Desert of Ice 
Covering 1/5th of the earth's surface, the arctic tundra is one of the coldest and driest places on the planet. The piercing sub-zero temperatures and powerful winds of the arctic tundra challenges even the hardiest of creatures. Life here must adapt or perish.We discover the delicate balance of the seasons that allows life to thrive in this extreme environment. The short arctic summer thaws the permafrost surface layer triggering an explosion of life, attracting animals from far and wide including one particular visitor all the way from the Antarctic, the Arctic Tern.
