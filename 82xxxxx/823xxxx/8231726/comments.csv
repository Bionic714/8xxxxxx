,gh0timan,2013-03-22T23:07Z,"AcePredator: There are several ways to open/read epub files.  Firefox has a plugin EPUBReader, as does Chrome with MagicScroll.  There are also ebook readers/managers like calibre and mobipocket.  I'm not sure what Mac or iPad users do, but Android has some good ebook readers. Right night, I've been using Cool Reader a lot, but I've also got Aldiko as a backup.  Google ""ebook reader"" with your operating system to find out what other people are using.  (i.e. ebook reader Windows 8).  Good luck!  :-)"
