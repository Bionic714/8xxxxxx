,pixienet,2013-03-09T23:52Z,"How well does this torrent handle mods? The last goty edition i downloaded crashed so often only after a couple mods, while alot of friends had theres running fine, granted they bought theres. Is this any better or am i carrying that risk regardless?"

The DLL file can be found below.  Download it under the advanced users tab (as the zip file) and extract it to your Fallout 3 installation directory.  Retry installing the 1.7 patch and you should be good to go, that's what I did!

,iHustleu,2013-05-02T04:33Z,How to you install patch 1.7?
,Aeglith,2013-05-05T04:06Z,"So I downloaded this, and all of the DLCS.
I put said DLCs in the correct place and downloaded the Warhammer 40k conversion mod.
The VSS Anchorage building has a ton of missing meshes to the point where it is completely unplayable, there is no pod, floors, walls or the elevator.
I disabled the mod and attempted to do a new game after reinstalling the DLC, again from this torrent and still no meshes.

Anybody wanna help?"
,GiantWombat1991,2013-05-17T16:56Z,Works great! Follow the instructions and you'll be fine. 10/10
,starfish102,2013-05-23T06:13Z,"For moonfire_star and other who are having trouble starting a new game, most likely your computer is using intel HD graphics card...If so, an easy fix is to download this file here at http://fallout3.nexusmods.com/mods/17209/?tab=2&navtag=%2Fajax%2Fmodfiles%2F%3Fid%3D17209&pUp=1, and follow its instructions. That should stop all of that crashing. :)"

,slinckkey,2013-05-27T21:25Z,"followed install instructions. when i try to play the game, gives me ""the ordinal 5360 could not be located in the dynamic link library xlive.dll""

,raiden311,2013-06-02T13:32Z,"the dlcs keep unchecking each time i pressed ok on the data files :|, my other bethesda games never do that"
,godofpogos,2013-06-03T23:46Z,How do you download the 1.7 patch? I'm downloading the torrent right now!
