,ozc,2013-04-07T16:54Z,"Does this include the Advanced Shop Management System? If not where can I get it?

I usually get Mitchell OnDemand but no one is torrenting it 2011."
,ozc,2013-04-08T02:13Z,"These three files are dated different and seem suspicious. 
""ALLDATA Repair - C.exe""
""ALLDATA Repair - M.exe""
""ALLDATA Repair - R.exe""
I suggest you don't run them!

Installation notes:
►When you do install ignore the keycheck until it's finished installing then close it.
►Repeat for the next two patches.
►Replace the ACE.EXE then run the program.
►Locate data disk to add them (see alldata website for details)  

As far as I know that's all you need to do.

If anyone can locate the Manager portion for this please share. I need to create invoices."
