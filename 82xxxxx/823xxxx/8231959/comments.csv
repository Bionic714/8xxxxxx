I'm seeding on 140kbps for the next couple of days"
,potvinsuks,2013-03-08T14:19Z,"Good stuff snakeye!  Also, people, go on their website and download light sets from their ""Enhanced"" section for particular add-on airports if you have them from aeros, simgiants, flytampa, tropsim etc. airports.  From tinkering with this, Ive managed to keep settings high, like (pole to pole @100) even with UTX lights up, and I havent noticed any FPS hit. "
,sososo93,2013-03-08T14:57Z,thanks dude :)
,bournejsnm,2013-03-08T15:15Z,"This is truly immersive and amazing, Thanks SnakEye and the person you uploaded on behalf of! a req: for Virtavia a4 skyhawk plzz
thanks again"
,potvinsuks,2013-03-08T16:15Z,Enjoy it. I think it provides a big bang for your buck.  Just please keep in mind to purchase this as I did.  It seems like they are not the biggest company out there and we should support the FS comm.
,boinga,2013-03-08T17:39Z,some news around Captain sim products?
,antyant,2013-03-08T18:16Z,"Hi friends,
thanks very much _SnakeEye for the download.
I have a problem and I would like to ask for some help. After installation, during the backup process, and after pointing the installation file, I receive a message ""add-on file missing ""tbb"" and the hole procedure stops there.
Can anybody think of something to help?
Thanks again anyway"
,ihabsamirmoh,2013-03-08T18:18Z,THANKS FOR ALL THANKS FOR SNAKEYE THANKS TO potvinsuks GOOD JOB

,lantonovdelagpe,2013-03-08T19:58Z,"@_SnakEye

Hey guy, I have some add-ons for FS to upload on TPB, but I've  never posted a torrent yet.
So can you help me please ?"
[T],_SnakEye,2013-03-08T20:36Z,"Sure lantonovdelagpe.
just drop me am email at mymail4745@gmail.com."
,Espana25,2013-03-08T23:06Z,OK but this support Bloom as UTX does and one more question how about this product getting mixed up with UTX Europe and UTX USA ? ...any affects on the UTX night lighting due to this or not ?
,potvinsuks,2013-03-09T00:10Z,"Espana...Yes it works w UTX lights and GEX textured lights all together with no FPS hit for me (I-7 3.80 ghz, NVDA GT530- W/Kostas tweaks.)  I dont use Bloom so I cant say.  Just make sure you run UTX lights before you run this to make sure.  I usually have City lights at 2 and highway set at 3 with the city lights a pure white and the highway lights either a baby blue, dark yellow, orange or whatever color you prefer.  It says 200 is standard for poles, but I have mine set up at 100 which makes the lights even more dense with no issues.  These lights give the night scenery a nice realistic touch, and its for lower flying.  Meaning,  once your up over around 5-8000 ft, they start to dissapear."
,lodestar738,2013-03-09T00:33Z,"Thanks!
Any chance of VOX ATC 6 and Coolsky DC-9?"
,Espana25,2013-03-09T03:09Z,"Alright that was some very useful information there by ""potvinsuks"" thanks man,yeah i was actually thinking if these overwrite the places which has already been taken by UTX lights or they still appear differently on the land all together and yeah i tried bloom in the older version of these lights it did not support it like UTX does ,and do let me know what settings should i use if i have both the UTX versions installed thanks again!"
,potvinsuks,2013-03-09T03:53Z,For me to tell you what settings for you to use would be bad advice because I dont know anything about your pc and how your FSX is set up.  Best advice to give you would be to try out all the settings between UTX and this and see what works for you. UTX lights are far more FPS heavy then this.
[T],_SnakEye,2013-03-09T10:37Z,"VoxATC v6.05 is here:

There is no OK button to select which folder to save the backup in. I am totally stuck at this point>>> HELP."
