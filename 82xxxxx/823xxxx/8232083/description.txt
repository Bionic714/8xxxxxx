Food factors are considered to be critical for human health promotion and play an important role in the prevention of life-style related diseases. One of the major challenges in this context is to determine the multiple factors associated with the causes of these diseases, as well as to develop a method of detecting changes in the initial stage and to establish a diagnostic approach that can be used in prevention studies of food factors.

This publication features chapters on genomics, proteomics, bioavailability and safety, antioxidants, life-style related diseases and on chemoprevention and cancer. Basic scientists with a focus on food factors, clinicians planning a prospective preventive study of food factors in life-style-related diseases, as well as company researchers studying health promotional effects of food or food ingredients will find a wealth of information in this book.
