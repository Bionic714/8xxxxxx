,Phunduit,2013-03-08T20:33Z,"That's awesome. Thanks.

Would you have a link to V1 and V2 of Wild C.A.T.S.?

Also been hunting for a full run of Stormwatch PHD if you have one or know of one?"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-08T20:56Z,"you're welcome Phunduit. like this series, the first two volumes can be found in http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/6874943/ and stormwatch phd is in http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/6744356/ . as you can see, pretty much every wildstorm title is included in the MTCDC torrents.

by the way, on this version 3.0 torrent, i forgot to mention that i included a bonus ... that grant morrison / jim lee screw-up ... #1 was the only issue published of volume 4."
,Oneiromancer12,2013-03-08T23:13Z,"Mr. your actions are even more heroic than those that appear in the comics that you upload. It is greatly appreciated!

Is Automatic Kafka available?

By the way, there are three badass 80's DC series that lack a proper torrent: Dr. Fate (DeMatteis run), The Question (O'Neil and Cowan) and The Spectre (Mandrake and Ostrander). If you upload these, you shall have my complete faith devotion, sir XD"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-09T01:03Z,"well devotion is one thing, but somebody yesterday offered me cake!  :-)

i found kafka for you but haven't had time today to up the torrent. i will a.s.a.p."
,Oneiromancer12,2013-03-09T01:10Z,Then I shall offer you two cakes! Three cakes! Infinite cakes! A möbius strip-shaped cake!
,darkwish77,2013-03-09T01:17Z,can somebody be kind enough to upload the volume 1 and 2 only? 
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-09T01:46Z,uTorrent + magnet links = you can download just the issues you want ...
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-09T01:53Z,"Oneiromancer12, s'alright. i had some homemade cookies today. it's nice to know you think it's worth infinity cakes. wait ... infinity cakes ... was thanos the villain in that? here's kafka:

,darkwish77,2013-03-09T03:45Z,"stf, i just click the get this torrent link. before i can choose what file to download but now i can't anymore. its only here on tpb i'm having that problem."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-09T06:03Z,"that's very strange, that's exactly what i do and it still lets me pick and choose. i use uTorrent 3.2.3, but any up-to-date torrent software should be letting you choose single files.

i'll do those wildc.a.t.s torrents when i have time. this week i've been collecting all the impact comics. i haven't had much time for anything else, that's why i link to the MTCDC."
,darkwish77,2013-03-09T14:07Z,"no worries, i've already download the link you provided. i guess its maybe i'm using a mac. but its still strange since i can choose what file to download before. it's only here at tpb i'm having this problem."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-10T00:20Z,"you might want to ask someone at suprbay.org (the forums), it has many people with vast knowledge of tech problems, especially compared to me.

that's just baffling!"
,alienoar,2013-03-10T03:56Z,"try clicking magnet link, wait for metadata to download, then pause, go into torrent properties, and deselect files you don't want. that's how I get around it"
,alienoar,2013-03-10T03:58Z,different torrent clients behave differently with magnet links from what I understand. I use Transmission (on linux) and it does not let you choose files when starting a magnet link
