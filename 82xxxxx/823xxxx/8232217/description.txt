Training your mind to concentrate is one of the most difficult, but one of the most rewarding, tasks that you will ever undertake. This book is a guide through this difficult process. There is no royal road to mastering yor mind, but this book at least sets out some good guide posts.
My only quibble with the book is the author's fascination with his Indian Guru, and his acceptance of the Indian Hindu belief structure. This is not a serious enough quibble to harm the utility of the book. I reccomend it to all who wish to make their mind their tool.
