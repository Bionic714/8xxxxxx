Storm from the East:
The Struggle Between the Arab World and the Christian West by Milton Viorst
Modern Library, 2007, 197 pages.

...
One clear lesson of the centuries of struggle is that both these civilizations possess enormous inner strengths. For the West to imagine it can impose its values on the East is a huge miscalculation. For the East to imagine the zealotry of its warriors can intimidate the West is naïve. Another lesson is that neither has the power to choose the other’s course. Though the confrontation is likely to go on, both sides can profit, by lowering the stakes, from an extended lull. Notwithstanding its military superiority, unless the West accepts the East’s right to determine its own future, the bloodshed that currently marks the contest will continue. Both civilizations will clearly be the poorer for it.

That is the message of this book.
