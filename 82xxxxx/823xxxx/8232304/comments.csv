- 1.2 (update #2)
- dlc costumes (classic dante, etc...)
- dlc weapons (bone, gold, samurai)
- pre-order perks (like super-dante and item finder)
- bloody palace"
,manakaRL,2013-03-09T14:13Z,"all included, except bloody palace."
,manakaRL,2013-03-09T14:17Z,"If anyone want to add bloody palace , just download update 1 include dlc RELOADED, then 
download vergil downfall RELOADED again and finally crack it with the files within the crack folder ( a bit messy but that worked for me , since after update 1 vergil downfall will be overwritten )"
,omega_jss,2013-03-11T03:57Z,download again!? what's the point of repacking the game!?
,Jiraichi,2013-03-15T16:38Z,what is the song in this setup?
