Storyline:
The adventure follows Bilbo Baggins, who is swept into an epic quest to reclaim Erebor with the help of Gandalf the Grey and 13 Dwarves led by the legendary warrior,

Thorin Oakenshield. Their journey will take them into the wild, through treacherous lands swarming with Goblins, Orcs and deadly Wargs, a mysterious and sinister figure known

only as the Necromancer, and a creature that will forever change Bilbo's life...Gollum. Alone with Gollum, Bilbo Baggins not only discovers depths of ingenuity and courage

that surprise even him, he also gains possession of Gollum's "precious" ring that holds unexpected and useful qualities...A simple, gold ring that is tied to the fate of all

Middle-earth in ways Bilbo cannot begin to know.
