,sammydemo669,2013-03-08T18:37Z,there is a virus in this torrent. do not install! my av popped up during 2 seperate tries. do not install this crap! thanks asshole!
,harrisrwe,2013-03-08T21:33Z,"No virus, it probably see's the registry modification as one. I found this on a forum and reposted it in case it got taken down. I've been playing all day"
,dude1022,2013-03-08T21:45Z,There isn't a virus you nub. maybe you should do some research on what av see as viruses before you go bitching people out. good torrent
,Jbn0s0rus,2013-03-20T17:28Z,"The ""regsetup.exe""  is a virus, don't run it! The game runs just fine without it, just use ""start game.cmd"""
,harrisrwe,2013-03-22T14:17Z,"Hmm, it wouldn't run without me installing the reg files first...I'll check it out and see what it actually does. I can guarantee it isn't a virus. I've installed this on 3 machines so far and haven't gotten any notifications."
,harrisrwe,2013-03-22T14:30Z,"Alright, I scanned the ""regsetup.exe"" with malwarebytes and it didn't find anything. However, I re-downloaded the torrent on a 4th machine and it did run without it so I guess it isn't necessary. Sorry for the mix-up!"
