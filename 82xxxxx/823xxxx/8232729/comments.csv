,mangoelectro,2013-03-08T19:59Z,does this work with the trial you can download from the ableton web? i've already had installed 32 bits and tryed the patch but no luck... still waiting for the file in the torrent to finish...

Please seed guys and if you notice this torrent is ever taken down, we leechers need to upload again to return the favor that was bestowed upon us. Its even more wrong for us not to pay, leech, then not at the very give back through uploading. Be easy and get money my people."
,wadewestwhy,2013-03-09T00:41Z,"wow it doesn't work for me.

patched it successfully and its still asking for authorization, and like many other ableton cracks, this one doesn't have an .auz file.

,pustur7,2013-03-09T01:43Z,"IT'S WORKING FOR ME
i downloaded everything and i got 
-1 .dmg for the ableton program
-1 .dmg for the patcher (the IO thing)
-1 instruction

when i opened the patcher it generated an authorization file that i used to start live and now i got it fully functional! so i don't know why you guys can't get the authorization file, but i got it. just read the instruction and follow it (i opened the instruction file with text edit BTW)

now, i opened live but max was not there, not a problem because i downloaded it without problems.
now i have max but i don't have the new effects (like the glue compressor or the LFO modulator)
where can i get them?"

@rodentdp you just go to ""max for live"" on the ""categories"" section. It should say something like: ""max hasn't been downloaded, press this link"" and it will redirect you to an ableton website which will automatically download max. 

Even though some music packs are for free, does anyone know where I can download the ones that are not free? "

,CaptainJackMix,2013-03-11T03:32Z,"This is incredible, thank you so much.

The torrent:
Great package. The crack worked for me without problem; I dragged both apps onto the desktop like it said, and after the .auz was generated I put the Live 9 app into my Applications folder. After launching Live I dragged the .auz into the window asking me to register and it thanked me for registering. I am running a 64-bit Mac (Core 2 Duo) and have never previously installed anything from Ableton on this machine.

As for the application:
I had hesitated in the past to try out live, mostly because the environment wasn't familiar to me - I already had purchased Logic, so why bother? But after spending some time with this, I understand. It's feature set is incredible. This little program has so much capability, both live and in the studio. To have it all in one package just feels like icing on the cake. Even if it's interface seems odd to you, I recommend trying this.

Even though I'm in no position to be spending money, I've decided to shell out on Push + Suite 9. The controller seems promising.

Thanks you ChingLiu for allowing us to try this fantastic product."

,spacefood,2013-03-11T10:31Z,"Thanks Ching_Liu. I was getting the message ""The Authorization file is invalid on this computer"". But I got it working now. 

Here is what I did wrong: I was opening the Ableton-live-suite-9.0.1.dmg file (and the box would appear suggesting to drag it into the application folder). I was dragging that file directly into the patch console instead of dragging it to the desktop first.

Yip, didn't follow the instructions. Hope this helps someone."

My only question is about how to get max for live to work. It says ""Max is either not installed or is installed to a non-default location."" I click ""download Max/MSP from cycling74.com"" but it requires registration, whereas with live 8 I got a prompt to download max for live as soon as I clicked Authorize.auz.

All you do is go to your preferences then go to the ""file folder"" tab and there should be something that says ""download latest version of max from cycling  74.com."" It will take you to the website where you have to create an account with ableton, then ask for a serial. But you dont need it because a download would be triggered automatically. Hoped this helped"

OH! One more thing. Personal warning to those of you using a lot of 32-bit plugins. They will not work in this version of Live. So if you are really attached to your plug-ins, keep your old installation of Live 8 available.
.
Also, when you're activating Live 9 (while still having Live 8 in your system) instead of Double-Clicking the .AUZ file, drag it to the Ableton Live 9 Suite.app file.
.
But personally, I just deleted Live 8... out with the old, in with the 64-bit! It runs smoother and quicker anyway.
.
Cheers, & thank you Ching_Liu & Team I/O for an excellent release."

,jimmay,2013-03-13T06:43Z,"It DOES work. You go to the ""Max for Live"" panel in Ableton Live 9, and select to download it.

It will take you to Ableton's website, and ask you to either log in, or register.
.
Just type in ANYTHING into the registration section. Put a random (valid) e-mail address and password and it will let you in.
.
The next page is the Serial Number page -- DO NOT put your serial number there... just wait. The download will happen automatically on this page.

Then install, and you have the latest Max for Live."

Open System Preferences, go to the Security & Privacy panel, go to the ""general"" panel, and change the ""Allow applications downloaded from:"" setting to ""Anywhere"".

Then the application will launch.

,FireStorm50,2013-04-06T17:59Z,"For all you STUPID losers complaining about why it's not authorizing (you know who you are), this is how you install:

1 - Copy/Paste ableton_live_suite_9.0.1_64.dmg and LivePatch.[io].dmg to the Desktop
2 - Open ableton_live_suite_9.0.1_64.dmg and drag it onto your applications
3 - Open LivePatch.[io].dmg
4 - Go to your Applications folder, find ""Ableton Live 9 Suite"", drag and drop the application onto the LivePatch window
5 - Go back to your desktop and open ""Authorize.auz""
6 - NOW you can open Ableton and it is now authorized

I don't really know if all of you guys even have eyes or don't know how to read, here's my recommendation, got back to elementary and learn how to read"

,sevy000,2013-04-12T12:20Z,"Nooo! they scrapped the Max download before I could get to it. :(

Thank you Ching_Liu for this noble deed of yours."

,jon1831,2013-04-13T19:26Z,will this version react to any other version of ableton live 8... ? anyone?
,blas_,2013-04-18T09:26Z,"Here is how my process went. I downloaded it. Dragged the app the to the desktop. I opened the patch app. Dragged the live app. to the console. The authorize.auz came to the desktop. After that i dragged the auz. file to the Live app. and the program now said that authorized successfully. Cool, right? but wait. after, i shut down my computer. I turned it on again. so i open up Ableton Live 9 app. and surprise, surprise, ""please take a moment to authorize your software."" WTF "
,MrPigface,2013-04-19T07:51Z,"What this lovely person below forgets to mention is this. Once you open said 'LivePatch window' double click the LivePatch icon (Grey i/0 Icon) in the center and then DRAG Ableton on to the Red Smartpatch window that plays wonderful music for you while you wait for it to Authorise. voilà! 0_o

Thanks again Chingliu !"
,Prophxcy,2013-04-20T10:06Z,"Hello there. I made an account just comment on this. I did the installation successfully just as the instructions say

After getting the first authorization i close live , open it again and ""please take a moment to authorize your software"".


Please be homies anyone and let me know if there's a solution to this.

,teethrayban,2013-04-23T16:56Z,"Hello everyone :)

I have a problem with this: There's nothing in the Instruments, Sounds, Drums...etc panels on the software, whereas the files ARE in the Live.app/Contents/App-Ressources/.
Can somebody help me?

Thanks!"

Problem fixed, it actually doesn't work if you don't use Ableton in English"

,blas_,2013-05-03T08:31Z,"This is dumb. After a day of only installing it, I open it and it tells me that I need to authorize. Wtf? Already authorized the first time and it says that it was successful. Why is it asking me again? And then when i try to click the authorize file it says that it's not valid anymore."
,hitri,2013-05-06T13:20Z,if you have any previously installed version of ableton remove and then install 9 as instructed! it worked for me! tnx for uploading! ;)

,hitri,2013-05-07T12:56Z,i use the Archive Utility app for zip or rar files. if u still have problems with authorization just patch live again and authorize again.
,hitri,2013-05-07T12:58Z,this is link to archiver http://en.softonic.com/s/archive-utility:mac
,amplexorJ,2013-05-07T17:59Z,"@babtistedu12 Well said. I think most people don't even know what dafuq an .nfo file is.... and if someone can't even get something as simple as this app to work, what makes them think they can actually use it HA"
,amplexorJ,2013-05-07T18:01Z,Thanks for the awesome upload guys :) Works Great!!!
,easmith4,2013-05-09T04:03Z,"everything went fine and it authorized correctly, and then i restarted my computer and opened live suite again and it said i wasn't authorized. then i tried to authorize it again and it said it was invalid. does anyone know why this is?"
,gonkey,2013-05-15T20:02Z,livepatch won't work on 10.5.8 - anyway someone could recompile it for 10.5?  Anything compiled starting with 10.6 uses a command that 10.5 won't understand and we keep getting the unexpected error.  I saw a couple other people with the same issue.  thanks!

,kyuun,2013-05-18T19:04Z,"Whenever i use Authorize.auz, ableton sends me an error message reading: ""This authorization file is invalid on this computer.""
it seemed to work the first time i clicked it, i had no problem saving the first time it opened, but after i closed it and re-opened for the first time, it acts as though it is not activated."
,ehousehead,2013-05-23T02:22Z,"NOTICE!!! IF YOU ARE GETTING THE FOLLOWING ERROR ""This authorization file is invalid on this computer."" You may have had automatic updates and/or send usage data turned on which will throw your authorization. Simply uninstall, and reinstall following the directions below*. As soon as you get it up and running turn those features off. 
*1 - Copy/Paste ableton_live_suite_9.0.1_64.dmg and LivePatch.[io].dmg to the Desktop
2 - Open ableton_live_suite_9.0.1_64.dmg and drag it onto your applications
