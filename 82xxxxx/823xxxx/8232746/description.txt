  With Metals, Feist responds to the surprise success of 2007ΓÇÖs The Reminder with a whisper, not a bang. She treads lightly through a series of disjointed torch songs and smoky pop/rock numbers, singing most of the songs in a soft, gauzy alto, as though sheΓÇÖs afraid of waking some sort of slumbering beast. Whenever the tempo picks up, so does FeistΓÇÖs desire to keep things weird, with songs like ΓÇ£A CommotionΓÇ¥ pitting pizzicato strings against a half-chanted, half-shouted refrain performed by an army of male singers. But Metals does its best work at a slower speed, where Feist can stretch her vocals across fingerplucked guitar arpeggios and piano chords like cotton. ΓÇ£Cicadas and Gulls,ΓÇ¥ with its simple melodies and pastoral ambience, rides the same summer breeze as Iron & Wine, and ΓÇ£Anti-PioneerΓÇ¥ breaks down the blues into its sparsest parts, retaining little more than a sparse drumbeat and guitar until the second half, where strings briefly swoon into the picture like an Ennio Morricone movie soundtrack. TheyΓÇÖre gone after 30 seconds, though, leaving things as quiet as they began. Like the rest of the subdued track list, ΓÇ£Anti-PioneerΓÇ¥ is unlikely to find itself featured in an iPod commercial, meaning FeistΓÇÖs days as a provider of hip, trendy TV jingles may be over. Still, thereΓÇÖs a soft-spoken power to Metals, even if its songs are more liquid and atmospheric than the title suggests.
