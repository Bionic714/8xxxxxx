People other than chefs and florists grow their own vegetables and flowers indoors as well. A sunroom or screened porch are great locations to grow your own vegetables, herbs or flowers.

Just come home with some fresh mozzarella, pick a ripe tomato from the plant in your sunroom, snip an aromatic basil leaf off your kitchen wall, and be enjoying a fresh made, 100% organic, totally pesticide free, Italian salad in less than a minute! Now imagine doing this in January. That's the joy of indoor gardening.

Indoor gardening is good for you. Plants are more than just decorations. They clean the air by filtering out chemicals and producing oxygen. In crowded urban areas with poor air quality, growing an indoor garden has been shown to notably reduce indoor pollution. No matter what you grow, as long as you keep your plants healthy, they'll keep you healthy in return.

In this book you will learn about all kinds of indoor gardens and how you can get started growing your own plants right away!
