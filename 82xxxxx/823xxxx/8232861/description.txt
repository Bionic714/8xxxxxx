This is not only a "how to" book describing one method of building your own suspended spiral staircase, but more importantly a book of self reliance and self determination. This book gives a person a procedure to accomplish something for themselves. It describes not only a staircase that serves as a tangible and utilitarian project in one's home but also releases a person's inner self and inner expression to build something of a more aesthetic nature. A true feeling of worth and accomplishment comes with building this project.
