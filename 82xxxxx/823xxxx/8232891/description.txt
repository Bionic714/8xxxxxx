Even if you have no garden at all, and merely a doorstep, patio, rooftop, balcony, or deck, you can grow potatoes in very small spaces. Learn which type of containers potatoes thrive in, producing bigger harvests than you'll ever get from a bed in the ground. Learn how to select and plant potatoes that mature earlier than others, giving you a quick food harvest even in a short season climate with cold winters.

Be More Self-Sufficient

No other food crop allows you to do so much with so little as the potato. In fact, this is the most productive food staple you can produce at home.

Yet you can grow enough potatoes on your doorstep to feed a person for days.
