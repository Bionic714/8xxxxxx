Wynton Charles Kelly (1931-1971) was born in Brooklyn,NY to Jamaican parents.

His importance to jazz is beyond question...not because of fame in the minds

of record buyers but from the unanimous high praise he receives from

the musicians he collaborated with.  This collection of Blue Notes documents

his breakthrough.




"...And his touch - so full and heavy.  I mean he could play one of those funny

old beat-ups [sic] pianos and it sounds like a grand the way that note comes

out; you hear it ring as if he's playing a horn or something...." HANK MOBLEY
