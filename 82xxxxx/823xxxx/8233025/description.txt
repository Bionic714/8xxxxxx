It can be difficult to assess whether or not the descriptions and photos of the saw bench, simple constructions of storm windows, floating floors and movable wall sections - actually are of interest to others.

When I nonetheless take my chances and use the above as subject of a book, it is all due the fact: The house has become significantly warmer and more comfortable to live in. Each activity - based on simple construction with the use of recycled or low-cost materials - has paid off.

WhatΓÇÖs more: The day we vacate the place - the floor boards, storm windows, extra window sills and wall coverings - are easily dismantled. There has been no damage to the building's original design and materials. In itself a good point and worth bringing forward.
