,Djghost13,2013-03-08T20:14Z,can anyone confirm that this version works/saves?
,iam6UN,2013-03-08T20:45Z,"@Djghost13,
well...kinda I can. At least for me...I was playing with this patch since yesterday - looks fine, except some new bugs: changing display settings in game causes display resolution corruption - needs a game restart to solve this. Also, this patch don't solves ""lense flares""; ""blood splatters""; ""water drops distortions"", etc. effects which must be in present on screen - devs are still working on that...with ETA somewhere in next week. Apart from all of that, it kinda works fine ;) - but once again, for someones particular PC's setups the new bugs might occur in some other ways...like the devs was saying."
[V],blaze69,2013-03-08T21:28Z,"Confirmed Working.

Saved game Working .

Haven't seen any Performance difference tho"
,clemlenain,2013-03-08T21:40Z,By any chance does this fix the issues with nvidia optimus ?? This game can't run because it uses my integrated video card ant not my dedicated videocard on my dekstop....
,russianhornybear,2013-03-08T21:52Z,"some improvements in FPS/ rendering for tressFX feature? For example ? 5 - 10 fps? :)
Look like fixes only for not very supported by game Nvidia and Intel (integrated HD?) cards."
,iam6UN,2013-03-08T22:13Z,"@russianhornybear,
I have a 7870 OC gpu - for me, the FPS's, at my chosen game settings, goes from average 40-42 to 50-55 :) ...and wuthout tessellation corruption at certain objects with use 4xSSAA. Apart from ""changing display settings in game"" bug, I dont have any other ;) "
,russianhornybear,2013-03-08T22:26Z,"Tested on ATI card :) Nothing new... if TressFX hair and High Precision turned on ,game just not playable :)
Everything else same.Without patch game works great on ATI cards ."
,russianhornybear,2013-03-08T22:34Z,"@ iam6UN
yup 5 fps + with patch  
I hope 13.3 driver can fix this :) For me on 7750 60 fps if hair and high precision turned off "
,mudslag,2013-03-08T23:55Z,Does this fix the save game issue where it stop/wont save?
,Djghost13,2013-03-09T01:26Z,Works but I dont see any real performance enhancement but then again ive been @ 60 fps stable for most of the time (vsync) Tressfx and high precision still just completely kills performance though
,Agoniizing,2013-03-09T06:45Z,"Everytime I try to run the patch it says ""Binkw32.dll is missing from your system"". But I do have the binkw32.dll file on my computer. Does anyone else have this problem?"
,dubai1991,2013-03-09T08:51Z,does it work????
,chrisroberts3,2013-03-09T10:26Z,Also make sure you get latest Beta/Legacy drivers from Nvidia if you have a Geforce card. It will fix some of the crashes in TR2013 + speed improvements. Both companies are however working on proper patches for the game
,dubai1991,2013-03-09T11:50Z,tesselation crash is fixed.....but still no such performance increase...
,lontrus,2013-03-09T12:24Z,"it corrupted my save game but i was in the beginning anyways so no big lost there

didnt fix anything on me and freezes the game even faster then before

if only it would crash to desktop but no i must do hard restart every after 10min of game play"
,lili9000c,2013-03-09T13:02Z,"I get ""AppId is not configured"" does anyone know how to solve it?"

When u will open the skidrow folder in the mounted folder then u will get 3 files named;
1.SKIDROW
2.steam_api.dll
3.Steamclient.dll

copy all these 3 items in ur main installed folder
