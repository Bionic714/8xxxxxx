Mindset: The New Psychology of Success 

World-renowned Stanford University psychologist Carol Dweck, in decades of research on achievement and success, has discovered a truly groundbreaking ideaΓÇôthe power of our mindset.

Dweck explains why itΓÇÖs not just our abilities and talent that bring us successΓÇôbut whether we approach them with a fixed or growth mindset. She makes clear why praising intelligence and ability doesnΓÇÖt foster self-esteem and lead to accomplishment, but may actually jeopardize success. With the right mindset, we can motivate our kids and help them to raise their grades, as well as reach our own goalsΓÇôpersonal and professional. Dweck reveals what all great parents, teachers, CEOs, and athletes already know: how a simple idea about the brain can create a love of learning and a resilience that is the basis of great accomplishment in every area.
