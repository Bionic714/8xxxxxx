Introduction
Imran in Islam is regarded as the father of Mariam (Mary). This surah is named after the family Imran (Amram), which includes Imran, Saint Anne, Mariam (Mary), and Isa (Jesus). 
The surah is believed to have been revealed in Medina and is either the second or third of the Medinan suras. Almost all of it also belongs to the third year of the Hijra with the possible exception of verse 61, which mentions Mubahalah and therefore might have been revealed during the visit of the Najran Christian deputation which occurred in the 10th year. 
Verse 7 is notable for several reasons. It states that:
- Some Qur'anic verses are to be understood by others
- Some verses are allegorical
- It includes a disclaimer against misrepresenting the allegorical verses as factual.
- It states that a set of people are to be consulted, those firmly rooted in knowledge.
Shi'a understand those firmly rooted in knowledge to be Prophet Muhammad's household. 
Sunni understand them to the Muslim jurists (Arabic: ulema).
