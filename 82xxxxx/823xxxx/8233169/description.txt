The organs and mechanisms that allow the human body to function are the subjects of this informative and insightful series. Covering everything from anatomy to physiology to the possible diseases and disorders of several major regions of the human form, these books allow students to learn in detail the systems that are germane to day-to-day activity. Diagrams and illustrations complement the text and help the reader visualize the workings of major organs and structures.
