There's just one problem: it's nowhere near loud enough. Very enjoyable but missing a *lot* when the loudness is so limited. Otherwise the transfer is really well done. 

Thanks again to the OP and the seeders."

Especially on songs like Squonk or Los Endos, once in awhile you want serious LOUDNESS and you won't get it from this recording. 

But you'll still LOVE what you hear."
