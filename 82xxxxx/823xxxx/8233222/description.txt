 : From best-selling and award-winning author Kevin Brockmeier: a new novel of:
 : stunning artistry and imagination about the wounds we bear and the light   :
 : that radiates from us all.                                                 :

 : At 8:17 on a Friday night, the Illumination commences. Every wound begins  :
 : to shine, every bruise to glow and shimmer. And in the aftermath of a fatal:
 : car accident, a private journal of love notes, written by a husband to his :
 : wife, passes into the keeping of a hospital patient and from there through :
 : the hands of five other suffering people, touching each of them uniquely.  :
 :                                                                            :
 : The six recipients--a data analyst, a photojournalist, a schoolchild, a    :
 : missionary, a writer, and a street vendor--inhabit an acutely observed,    :
 : beautifully familiar yet particularly strange universe, as only Kevin      :
 : Brockmeier could imagine it: a world in which human pain is expressed as   :
 : illumination, so that one's wounds glitter, fluoresce, and blaze with      :
 : light. As we follow the journey of the book from stranger to stranger, we  :
 : come to understand how intricately and brilliantly they are connected, in  :
 : all their human injury and experience.                                     :
