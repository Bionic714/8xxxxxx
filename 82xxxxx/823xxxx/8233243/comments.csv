We're going on a holiday in May. Who here knows how to set uTorrent so that it will automatically download the latest YR eps? We're trying to organise someone to do it for us but this is proving to be a difficult ask. 

i'm afraid that when we get home most of the older eps won't be seeded any longer.

Thanks"
