  Richard Marx's second album is almost as strong as his first, even if it shows that his songwriting has a tendency to slip into sappy, saccharine clich√©s. Nevertheless, it contains some major hit singles -- "Satisfied," "Right Here Waiting," "Angelia," "Children of the Night," and "Too Late to Say Goodbye."
