[V],thenoobish,2013-03-08T22:10Z,I might have been wrong about the unrared filesize. It seems like Duplex have ripped away the extra content from the disc..

*Important* You can only play this game on a PS3 with CFW system, (example:Rogero CFW 4.30 v2.05) not on a regular system with Sony's official firmware - Google Rogero CFW 4.30 v2.05 & then install it on your PS3 then install the latest multiman software program on your new cfw ps3 *Warning* this game has 4GB+ files -if you have the space on your internal HDD fine (no problems/u can play from int.HDD) by FTP'ing into your HDD internal game folder - if not FTP game into your internal hd00/GAME folder then use Multiman to transfer it to your external HDD - Using MM internal File Manager- Multiman will automatically split the 4GB+ files so that it can be played externally. Then you can delete the internal version of the Game. Play the game with a disc inside the PS3 using BD Mirror enabled/With Disc & test Permissions & it'll work! "

,dadoRR,2013-03-15T13:07Z,"For the people not being able to play this after the duplex logo:
In other torrent REVANTE explained how you can play this and I can confirm that it works. All you need to do is: 
Edit archives file with notepad in USRDIR
changed 17 to 15 in the first line, and then removed the following lines
EXTRASCIN1.PSARC
EXTRASCIN2.PSARC
MP-RESOURCES.PSARC
MULTIPLAYER.PSARC

Works 100% and of course it is a EPIC game. Enjoy people, I know I will :)"

,jeankibass,2013-03-25T08:34Z,Hi alithegamer and everyone... I was in the same exact problem like you on CFW 3.55... and solved copy the entire game via FTP to the PS3. Try that...
,jeankibass,2013-03-25T08:36Z,By The Way... I almost get fucking nuts in the process of discover that little detail.
,alithegamer,2013-03-25T15:37Z,"@jeankibass THANX a lot for the reply dude,,, i really appreciat that you are the only one who replied in here. I tried to ftp it but after seeing the TIME WHICH IT GONNA TAKE (more than 10 hrs) i decided to quit the idea... its to risky to keep the ps3 ON for constant 10 hrs... i will try the us version instead,,, thanx once again.. thanx a lot."
,jeankibass,2013-03-25T17:56Z,Hi again alithegamer. Check your network devices and setup. For me only take like 25 mins copy the 35GB of GoW BCES01741from the PC to the PS3 using Filezilla. I asure you that the game work. I already finish the game the last saturday.
,jeankibass,2013-03-25T20:28Z,"If you are doing the FTP copy via Wireless that is the motive because can take so long. Make the copy via Wired connection. Wired the connection from the PC to the router/switch. And wired from the router/switch to the PS3. The real particular problem with the GoW Ascension is the file EXTRASCIN2.PSARC that is bigger than 4GB supported on file systen FAT32 on the External HDD. For some reason only two games that I know (I got almost 200 and all were downloaded...) won´t work after make a copy from the External HDD to the Internal HDD. This is one of the two games. Something on the PSARC file get damage in the copy process. The alternative in this cases is using FTP copy. By other hand, if you try use a PSARC Extractor on this game in particular won´t work too. Sorry for my English. Is not may main languaje and has became a little bit rusty."
,alithegamer,2013-03-26T08:47Z,"@jeankibassthanx once again, first of all even my english is not that good, i m a muslim and my mother tongue is URDU, and your english is damn good. second thing how come you are getting so fast speed in ftp. and third that i have got the working copy from a vendor and now its working i quit downloading it... all the games have worked properly even ARMY OF TWO CARTEL is near finish. but only this one and METAL GEAR RISING are not working still cant get it why this is happening??????????????"
,jeankibass,2013-03-27T02:09Z,Hi Again alithegamer. I got that speed using wired conection on my 1Gbps LAN home network. I have the PS3 slim version of 160 GB. That version of the console has a 1 Gbps LAN port. My notebook have a 1 Gbps LAN port too. And the router that I use is a D-Link (Model DIR-655) that also have 1Gbps Ports. So the conexion between the PS3 and the Notebook go completely on 1 Gbps. You have to give me more information about the problem that you have with the MGR.
,jeankibass,2013-03-27T02:13Z,"Don't use Wireless conection if you gonna do any FTP copy to/from the console. a good webpage of recent games and eboots is this one: ""http://mega-ps3.com"" The only detail is that the site is on french languaje."
,jeankibass,2013-03-27T02:41Z,If you know any good webpage too I will appreciate...
,jeankibass,2013-03-27T02:46Z,What version of Firmware did you use to upgrade your PS3 to 4.31? Custom or Original Firmware?
,alithegamer,2013-03-27T06:53Z,"thanx once again for the DETAILED reply, the configuration of your all machines is far much higher than me.. i have only 10/100mbps possible connections, so no need to ask anythng else about your speed thing. lol, "
,alithegamer,2013-03-27T06:53Z,"and i have got the MGR from the same vendor and now it also working FLAWLESSLY i am surprised why didnt duplex versions worked on my console, and i was on 3.55 kemaw from that i have update to rogero 4.31 and ofcourse its CFW. i visit ps3hax, ps3news, ps3scene, sites for some informations, i really am thankfull the concern that you showed, "
