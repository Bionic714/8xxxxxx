Vengeance is born in the fires of betrayal in this prequel to the best-
selling God of War franchise. Six months have passed since Kratos stood
over the bodies of his wife and child, his hands stained with their blood

avenge them, Kratos broke the blood oath that bound him to Ares, but oaths
to Olympus are not so easily broken... Sentenced to an eternity chained

of the Furies. He will be tested as he seeks freedom, redemption for his
sins, and the clarity to avenge his family.
