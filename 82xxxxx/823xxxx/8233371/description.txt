Slick, fast-paced action thriller in which a mundane office worker is transformed into a lethal assassin. Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy)'s life is one of dull routine. Trapped in a dead-end office job, unappreciated by his boss, and cheated on by his girlfriend, Wes has accepted that he's never going to amount to much in life. But all that changes one day when he meets the enigmatic Fox (Angelina Jolie), a member of a secret society of assassins named The Fraternity who want to recruit Wes into their ranks. Dealing out death as ordained by fate itself, the society's leader, Sloan (Morgan Freeman), tells Wes that the father he always thought was dead was actually one of their top assassins, and that following his recent murder, he must now avenge his father's death by releasing the dormant powers he has inherited. Although reticent at first, Wes quickly warms to both the task and the icily-sexy Fox, as he discovers his natural aptitude for the job at hand whilst despatching the bad guys with supremely energetic efficiency.
