,antde2001,2013-03-09T04:05Z,Quick question. Does this only require you to burn to a blu-ray and play or does the PS3 need any modification? Any hints will be useful. Thanks 
,alithegamer,2013-03-09T07:32Z,"@antde2001 where are you living dude? it needed a JAILBROKEN ps3, and it works form harddisk. no bluray buirning,,, if you dont know about jailbraiking GOOGLE it... and please dont try to do it yourself if you are not familiar with all these stuff, and if you ps3 version is about 3.55 then simply forget it... NO HOPE FOR YOU SO FAR..."
