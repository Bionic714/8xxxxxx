,klingen91,2013-03-08T22:30Z,Skidrow page is 8 gb
,uran1001,2013-03-08T22:31Z,"ty for sharing mate, since downloading via those bshit links that skidrow gaved is pain in the arse. ur a mini hero :D cant wait for crack RAWR"
,mido009,2013-03-08T22:31Z,i already downloaded it from there
,Verl1290,2013-03-08T22:32Z,..
,halffinger,2013-03-08T22:35Z,"it must have been really hard to get all the .rar I got pissed off trying to get them and I couldn't,hope to see a crack soon."
,wayoff333,2013-03-08T22:38Z,"Can't install it, connects to origin servers"
,DarthTauri,2013-03-08T22:41Z,"You know, without a crack this is quite useless to the torrenting community... what i have heard about the game it may be impossible to crack."
,sld445,2013-03-08T22:41Z,looks like this is not going to be cracked maybe ill try to buy the first pc game in my life!
,cedricberube,2013-03-08T22:41Z,"so, this is the new simcity and we have to wait for the crack."
,Don_Bianco,2013-03-08T22:48Z,"This file is the correct size that it is on Skidrow's website. Its probably legit, but there's no crack yet. We might have to wait a few weeks or even months for it to be cracked."
,klingen91,2013-03-08T22:50Z,Its the same fake 
,klingen91,2013-03-08T22:52Z,Tomorrow i gonna buy it. Have fun to wait for it
,iBen95111,2013-03-08T22:55Z,Now all that has to happen is for us to get past 1%
,beLIEver8,2013-03-08T23:02Z,Skidrow has a crack up now. It's just damn near impossible to get around the spammy surveys. Guess we'll have to wait until a legit crack comes out.
,LiquidQC,2013-03-08T23:06Z,"No there probably won't be a crack for this because its an online game but there will be private servers sooner or later, just like how there where private servers for Diablo 3 and The War Z."
,Don_Bianco,2013-03-08T23:07Z,Anyone give it a shot yet?
,klingen91,2013-03-08T23:10Z,Download this for what? No crack
,Don_Bianco,2013-03-08T23:15Z,"So what if there's no crack, if this is legit, it'll save you time once there is a crack. I'm not going to buy this game until the server problems are solved, right now it's a waste of 60$"
,Cainn23,2013-03-08T23:15Z,"Maybe it will be cracked, maybe it won't. The important thing is to not purchase this game. If you do, you are supporting EA and all future games requiring an online connection to play. Even single player. Speak with your wallets."
,Dexric,2013-03-08T23:17Z,"@beLIEver8
So there's no reason the LIE in your name is capped?"
,Don_Bianco,2013-03-08T23:18Z,What the hell is going on with the comments on this site the past few days.
,MhaveNN,2013-03-08T23:19Z,"Reply to: Can't install it, connects to origin servers.
You can install it, but you can't play it because it will connect to origin servers hence there's no crack yet and this game is ONLINE only. No clue why but they didn't add a single player which sucks."
,PixelatedMadness,2013-03-08T23:26Z,"@klingen91. For what you say? Well old chap, that is simple, you can download this right now and then apply a crack once released.

Also, for all you imbeciles, this is quite simply a mirror of a legit game, it does not contain any crack and without a serial-number you can forget trying to even launch this."
,klingen91,2013-03-08T23:27Z,60 dollar? On Sweden the procent is 35dollar

Download it and wait for crack you retarded fagot"
,godziothc,2013-03-09T00:01Z,"im really tired of everyone saying ""skidrows site"", i mean every torrent there is a comment like that, there is always another comment explaining that scene groups DO NOT use websites of any sort to distribute their work, NEVER...but i probably just wasted 2 minutes of my time anyway"
,bigdrago,2013-03-09T00:22Z,So.... is this real or just another fake?

,Don_Bianco,2013-03-09T00:33Z,"It's real, there's just no crack/private server yet so its unplayable. Still worth the download though, so when the crack does become available, you'll just have to get that instead of a big file. If this were fake, like all the others, it would have been removed awhile ago :)"
,Don_Bianco,2013-03-09T01:05Z,Hate that people leech but don't seed....
,wayoff333,2013-03-09T01:06Z,Thanks for the awesome reply @don_bianco :)
,mordin999,2013-03-09T01:17Z,"Its probably legit, but still a waste of time. Simcity is DRM online only game, like Diablo3 and people still waiting for it be cracked..."
,veselinve,2013-03-09T02:00Z,put the crack on the simcity folder
,CMAY96,2013-03-09T02:18Z,why does pirate bay keep deleting simcity torrents

,Deeh1901,2013-03-09T02:38Z,"Cool, the download just doesn't start."
,folkman87,2013-03-09T02:45Z,we need seed with more than 6.1%. anyone?
,folkman87,2013-03-09T02:49Z,this link to the crak is unavailable
,folkman87,2013-03-09T02:54Z,the second one is working. sorry.
,csillesa,2013-03-09T02:59Z,"Actually got to download the bypass, but am having trouble getting the modified .par file, damned hosting site won't let me download it even if I went though with their so called 'survey'.  Sad."
,klingen91,2013-03-09T03:05Z,stop trying to start the game you have to wait for crack....if its coming any crack at all
,lucassouza1996,2013-03-09T03:07Z,"I started the download 10 minutes ago, 6,5 % of the game was download (254 MB), that give me a average of 423 kbps of download speed, I think it's very good :)"
,Don_Bianco,2013-03-09T03:18Z,"The amount of seeders keep going down, but the leechers keep going up. You guys are stupid, if you only leech, you'll never finish the download."
,NZ-Wanderer,2013-03-09T03:40Z,"Why the hell make us jump through hoops to get that small file? - half the time those ""do a survey and we give you the file"" never work.
Can't people actually be nice any more."
,Don_Bianco,2013-03-09T03:46Z,"@NZ-Wanderer the one i clicked didnt ask me to do a survey? It was a 120 second wait, then it downloaded in browser right away."
,magimat,2013-03-09T03:46Z,anyone can confimr that this bypass actually works? sound like a fake to me.. but who knows!
,NZ-Wanderer,2013-03-09T03:53Z,"Yea, don't bother trying to get that bypass file, even tho you may get to complete one of the things they want you to do the damn site doesn't unlock the file..
So DON""T even try, its just a waste of your time..
If I mamage to find it elsewhere I will upload it to a FREE site that doesn't require you to do all kinds of shit, but I cannot find it so far."
,NZ-Wanderer,2013-03-09T03:55Z,"@Don_Bianco sorry to say but I got redirectd to a page which requires me to do one of 4 things (install junk) to get the page unlocked which contains the file..
If you have the file, can't you just upload it to a file sharing site? :) or give it to one of us to share around :)"
,Don_Bianco,2013-03-09T03:56Z,"@Nz-wanderer dude, i used this one, there was no survey, and my anti virus didnt flag it. http://bayfiles.com/file/IYo3/T3jVIy/simcity_origin_bypass.zip"
,doctornickau,2013-03-09T04:00Z,http://bayfiles.com/file/IYdJ/qDu9Hu/simcity_origin_bypass.zip is a fake. Anything with surveys and some simcity torrents have been total rubbish. 
,NZ-Wanderer,2013-03-09T04:00Z,"Yup, I got that file easy enuff, BUT you try running that EXE dile inside the file, it opens the program, BUT then tells you you have to go on the internet to download another file (par one) that's when you get taken to pages which require you to do stuff :("
,Don_Bianco,2013-03-09T04:02Z,"Ohhhh shit okay, I see what you mean now."
,mikedongs,2013-03-09T04:04Z,"Guys, if you ever see a ""crack download"" link pointing to bayfiles.com *DO NOT FOLLOW IT*

They arent real, ever. It's just another bullshit site that tries to trick you into downloading other bullshit and install adware all over your machine. (in this case, bayfiles tries to trick you into installing iLivid, which is a useless download manager that shows you ads all day long, as if there aren't enough ads in the world already.)

And if  you go to ANY site claiming you must complete a survey before downloading something *JUST LEAVE* because NONE of them are legit. Also, if you look, they all say ""if it doesn't download after completing a survey, just take another survey and it should go.""

That means it's fucking fake. Let me repeat for the slow people: *NOT ONE DOWNLOAD-FOR-A-SURVEY WEBSITE IS LEGIT*!!!"
,NZ-Wanderer,2013-03-09T04:07Z,Soo unfortunately it looks like everyone here is back at square one waiting for Skidrow to give us the proper files :) 
,Don_Bianco,2013-03-09T04:08Z,"Well no, this is a real game download, we just can't play it till it's cracked :)"
,Kyzaca,2013-03-09T04:25Z,Fuck my life.
,britton27,2013-03-09T04:42Z,"This is great that some one posted the game finally (it was out on the 5th on another site) but there is no point in downloading it. Why? 

Because chances are since it uses online activation this ""retail"" copy will not work with any released crack. This one's not going to be as simple as copy and paste some hacked EXE file. 

IF it is ever cracked, an entirely new installer system will have to be created in order to bypass the Origin software that forces you to use it to activate the game. Think about that before you jump the gun and waste your download/upload bandwidth on this torrent. 

This game will have similar protection like Diablo III and to date there is no crack or hack to simulate the online mode 100%. 

-two cents"
,040147,2013-03-09T04:43Z,hold on guys im actually working on a crack i think im going to be done by 1:45 am if everything goes well ... and im not lying .. u can believe what u want

,mikedongs,2013-03-09T05:43Z,"040147: uh, yeah okay. so have you reverse engineered the entire SC5 server protocol now? have you written not only a crack, but also a program that causes the required gameplay elements to occur that normally are handled by the EA servers?

mmm. 1:45am eh? yeah right dude, good fucking luck. doesn't sound like you know what you're doing if you think you can do it that fast."
,shotgecko,2013-03-09T05:53Z,"Guys, seeing as people who have actually purchased the game can't even play it, it's going to be a while until pirates can. Don't just download things thinking you're one step closer. If you want it that badly, just buy it. "
,040147,2013-03-09T06:10Z,mikedongs/ not really ive been working on it for days ... yes it its hard to do and im not working alone ... at least theres some people trying to do something here ... u dont have to be rude  and i said if everything goes well we could actually have a crack ... we are hoping for the best so we can all finally play this game
,040147,2013-03-09T06:12Z,its really hard to do but not impossible
,Machine4578,2013-03-09T06:15Z,the only way there will ever be a crack for this game is if EA decides to make an offline patch.. similar to what Ubisoft just did for HAWX2..
,mman360,2013-03-09T07:30Z,"@040147

I hope you speak of truth. Will need to redownload or just download the crack.

,MadRevolver,2013-03-09T07:44Z,it will be good*
,Kamadas,2013-03-09T07:50Z,pls more fakes Im getting bored.
,mlmariss,2013-03-09T08:22Z,"1. There is no uncrackable game, like with Ubisoft, where it was connected to servers..it just took a bit more time and new solutions to find..

2. Yes, my upload speed sucks and still i'm gona leave it so You can get it. As soon as more of You will have 100% game, speed goes up.

3. If it's usable or useless - we will know only when some work-around solutions will come out.
I'll better have the Game before crack comes out.

4. I don't recommend to buy this game. Check official forums, there are a LOT of cries and complains in there..MANY of them claimed that this is the waste of money.. I'm just warning You..

5. If You don't want - I'm not forcing You to download it :) I'm just another source for the *.rar'ed version that is on internet.

There were tons of games that required the Internet connection and were still cracked by either notifying the player that his/her connection should be disabled (so the game doesn't connect to the servers) or by simply disabling the internet connectivity requirement in the game (where the game notifies that it cannot connect, even though your internet connection is on).
It CAN be cracked, it's just a matter of when. IT guy here."

This on-line only game content parts has proven to be the safest way for greedy game companies to have their games crack-proof. Had to be the greedier one's, E.A. and Ubisoft.

LOL

1. Game saves cities on EA Servers not on your computer.
2. The glasbox engine is on EA Servers and the game cant run without GBE.

So Crack? Maybe. NEXT YEAR!"

now WTF has Cities XL have to do with this ffs""

since simcity still does not work and after reading the comments that say probably not crack prompt output and apparently the game is bad, if not stupid to have animations like a dinosaur destroying buildings, I thought it appropriate to share the link of a torrent in the pirate bay about Cities XL, an excellent game that currently works.

... sorry for writing this text in English if it contains grammatical errors, I used the google translator."
,Opteron82,2013-03-09T21:34Z,"@Wazzaper

The problem is that there is no game like this.

GBE works and runs simcity on EA servers...so basicly to make a crack you have to get GlasBox engine wich is not implented in the game and only exists on servers ;) Simple as that.

I have the game and only downflaw is the size of cities...servers are running now almost smoothly...EA have some more work to do but besides that the game is good ;) i like it"
,Opteron82,2013-03-09T21:39Z,"@gumertag

Well Cities XL has a problem on using multiple cores. Cities XL is a solid game but can never be compared with SC.

Why so many users dont like SC is because of servers and not the game itself. As EA was so stupid that they never saw a mass going online for a game we have waited 10 years.

The game itself is fantastic and playing it in multiplayer with other people just makes it more fun.

I'm playing it like crazy...since the download (7th in Europe) i havent stoped ;)"

The only thing simulated on the server is region stuff. 90% of the game is still on the client, and afaik, the region ""simulations"" are very lightweight.

The game was definitely not Spore. I got the game (Leaked) 3 days before it was released right here on the Pirate Bay. It never had always on DRM, though it did have an online community where you could download creatures and stuff that those who didn't register the game couldn't get.

I think you are mixing up Darkspore with Spore. Though, "

Yes, it's hard to emulate everything and it probably might just exhaust crackers to the point of abandoning the project, but it's doable. Most of all, I will never, ever buy anything from a company that puts singleplayer content online. And anyone who does buy those kind of games lacks any kind of self-respect and is setting himself up to be a bitch of the gaming companies - just a puppet without any opinions or will that'll buy anything like a good little slave.
