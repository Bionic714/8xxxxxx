,TheBrenton,2013-03-10T09:57Z,"Judas i Suggest you get yourself an special .nfo file along with your encodes and a seedbox for not getting your own Connection so busy and at the end an official website to release your encodes there and your fans can give you donations if you got shorthanded.
that will be awesome!
i know you've heard it so many times but we think every1 can be happier that way :) ."

like sherlock holmes a game of shadows..

men in black trilogy.... i've a huge list.."
[V],dhjudasx,2013-03-10T20:25Z,"As for the website and stuff..... sorry no.... can't do it....

And as far as donations go..... The only thing i could potentially do is create a wishlist of blurays on amazon lol.

but i'd still terrible to accept gifts/donations for this stuff."
