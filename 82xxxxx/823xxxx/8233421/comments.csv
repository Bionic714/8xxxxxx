  Ya'll a bunch of fucking super NOOBS!!!!
For christ sakes read the notepad file with the clearly eligable instructions.  I downloaded this today and installed it on my Windows 7 64 bit with no problems at all.  Maybe you should follow the directions before posting stupid comments that make you look like a bunch of piss poor novice NOOBS! LoL you are jokes, why the hell are you even using Pirate Bay if you don't know how to follow simple instructions on installing cracked software? For real guys, dont down play this fine software provided by TorDigger just because your a bunch of complete newb idiots.  You guys are the clowns of PirateBay lol everyone point and laugh at the lame Noobs! HA!"
