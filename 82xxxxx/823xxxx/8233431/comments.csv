,rockdood27,2013-03-09T04:38Z,@Shifty_Shellshock You may be gay if you have the username shifty shellshock.
,shadowwraithe,2013-03-09T04:48Z,"Shifty_Shellshock - Is an ignorant comment like that really necessary? Some people, including straight men, appreciate movies that have actual storylines, well written scripts and may not contain gratuitous violence. For you to feel the need to make a comment like that shows that you're either ignorant, insular, moronic, bigoted, or, more likely, a combination all aforementioned attributes, and quite possibly a closeted, redneck, homosexual who makes such comments, due to a deep-seeded insecurity with yourself, resulting in a need to says such things in a pathetic effort to prove to yourself, and those around you, that you are not what in fact you really are. 
Go back to tipping cows, shagging goats and cheap beer until you can make a comment that is relevant."
