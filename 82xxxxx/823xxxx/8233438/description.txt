The Caribbean, in the turbulent 17th Century. The mighty kingdoms of
Spain, England, France and the Netherlands fight over the colonies.
And there you are, a young sea captain whose only goal is to become
the most powerful man in the New World. To achieve that goal, you may
choose one of the two available campaigns: will you become an
Adventurer or a Trader?

If you chose the way of the Adventurer, lead an unforgiving campaign
for the conquest of the seas: invasion, piracy, bounty hunting,
raiding; do whatever it takes to build your own empire in the
Caribbean. And of course, trade will have a less important role to
play in your rise.

The way of the Trader is, on the opposite, mostly about developing
your riches and your economic power. To be the most powerful Trader of
the New World, you have to create trade routes, build industries and
develop the economy of the colonies.

Of course, in Free Play mode, you can mix both of those in any way you
want, letting you create your own unique and exciting story.

For the first time in the acclaimed Port Royale series, you are not
alone in the beautiful and seemingly so peaceful seas of the Caribbean.
The Multiplayer mode allows up to 4 players to play through LAN or over
the Internet. Develop a successful trading company, lead your ships in
beautiful 3D naval battles and force your opponents to their knees!
