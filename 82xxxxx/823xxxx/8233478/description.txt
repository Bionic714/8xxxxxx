Wildest Arctic
Wildest Arctic explores four extraordinary areas of the arctic giving a unique insight into what life is like for animals trying to survive in these incredible habitats. The cameras capture life over the course of 12 months in the frozen forests of the Taiga, which contain one third of the world's trees. They also explore the arctic tundra, one of the coldest, driest places on the planet and home to hundreds of thousands of caribou. In later episodes, footage shows what life is like in the Arctic circle for the 'Ice Bears' and 'Ice Whales' and explores the country of Iceland; following the seasons and discovering the natural beauty of this country's rugged landscapes and hardy wildlife.



4)  Iceland: Land of Fire and Ice 
Iceland is a land born out of fire, sculpted by ice. This unique island is home to some of the planet's rarest and most spectacular creatures and it harbours some of the most extreme environments on Earth. On the highly volcanic Mid Atlantic Ridge, new land is forged every day in Iceland's heart of fire.
In this episode we follow the seasons and discover the natural beauty of Iceland's rugged landscapes. We reveal the remarkable wildlife of this unique island from the hardy Arctic Fox to the largest breeding colony in the world of the charismatic Atlantic Puffin.
