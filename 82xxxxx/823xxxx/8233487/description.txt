This book is not so much a "how to" as it is a "because why." Why I built my solar home off the grid explores the several reasons for returning to a more self reliant and self dependent lifestyle. With the current political, social and economic turmoil in addition to protecting the planet we live on, this book explores the many benefits living off the grid can provide.
