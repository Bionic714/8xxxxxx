James Louis Johnson (1924-2001) was born in Indianapolis, Indiana.  His technical

ability with the slide trombone enabled it to take a place in the front line

with jazz soloing instruments like the trumpet and saxophones in the daunting

BeBop "idiom."



    This upload comprises (2) distinct volumes of the EMINENT JAY JAY JOHNSON

    on BLUE NOTE



    Volume #1 is an RVG (Rudy Van Gelder) reissue (2001)


    Volume #2 is a plain old Blue Note digitization (1989)




Interesting trivial note:  Volume #2 booklet says that Wynton Kelly was born

in Jamaica and the booklet notes from my previous upload says he was born in

Brooklyn.  No "biggie" either way....hearsay has filled our minds with much 

dubious info....the music itself never "lies"
