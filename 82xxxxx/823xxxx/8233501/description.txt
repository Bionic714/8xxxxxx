Natural Disasters Happen... Are You Prepared?

Yes natural disasters happen... sometimes it seems like something happens every single day somewhere in the world. Some events are so severe that people are still recovering from them years later. Some last just a few days or weeks, then life goes back to what most of us consider normal.

Have you ever considered how you might take care of yourself or your loved ones if a disaster strikes in your area? Do you know whether you would have food to eat or even clean water to drink when it's desparately needed?
