Sound City - Real To Reel is a brand new collection of all-new all-original songs, each one composed and recorded exclusively for the film within its own 24-hour session on that console after it was reinstalled in Grohl and his Foo Fighters' own 606 Studios. The new tracks - featuring an amazing and idiosyncratic cast of collaborators including Paul McCartney, Grohl's former Nirvana and current Foo Fighters bandmates, Stevie Nicks, Rick Springfield, Trent Reznor, Joshua Homme of Queens of the Stone Age, Rick Nielsen of Cheap Trick, Lee Ving of Fear, Corey Taylor of Slipknot, Brad Wilk and Tim Commerford of Rage Against The Machine and more - passionately exemplify SOUND CITY's celebration of the human element of musicianship and recording in an increasingly digital world.
