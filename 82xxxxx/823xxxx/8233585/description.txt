I Bought this album when it first came out in 1999 and I was totally blown away. If you like Trance then you would love this album. My favorite Disc is the second one, Arrivals but the first one is very good too. I hope people out there can enjoy this very hard to find music. Seed and share this great music and leave a comment if you like it. Im a new uploader and any feedback would be greatly appreciated.
