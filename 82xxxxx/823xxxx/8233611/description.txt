The visual half of The Knife's 2006 live DVD/CD combo package, "Silent Shout: An Audio Visual Experience". I didn't make this rip and it was the best quality I could find, but luckily there's so much craziness going on visually that it's not very noticeable.

If you love this as much as you should, please consider showing The Knife your support. They deserve it far more than most.

Once again, enjoy!

Oh, and don't forget: their new album "Shaking the Habitual" comes out on 08 April 2013!
