Remember way back when
when this all began

We kept our computer on overnight
and we won the Pirates fight

Before starting your foreplay.
You simply turn off your display,
Then you would screw

Knowing  ThePirateBay grew
Just by leaving on my CPU

and our precious torrents would survive
But, to much surprise 
more and more would deprive 
by not keeping our torrents alive!

What happened.... it was all free?
Until a larger degree
of us were blind to see,
it wasn't all about ME ME ME!

Walmart is ready to say
""$29.99 for that BluRay.
and $12.99 for a CD, OK?""

Sorry The Pirate Bay, 
what can I say...

I was hoping others would seed
So I didn't feel the need.
You know, I had to download at max Speed,
so I didn't give anyone a chance to seed
I guess that's what they call greed,
Biting the hands that feed

Songs & movies are leaving me Broke!
I wish I didn't treat it like a joke, 
Seeding is easy as a keystroke
Now I have my heartbroke.

You know I am not lying
So here is some bad rhyming
A warning, just to keep reminding
that Yo, most torrents are dying!

We can still Succeed
if we all double down and Seed
at the minimum, or even Exceed
the 2:1 ratio creed

I will indeed
copy and past my plead.  
Hope you have agreed
and will take the lead
to seed seed seed,
regardless if you have highspeed
or something slower then a ten-speed.
Thank you, and God-Speed."
