That man had huge balls to take on the music industry and to reveal who fake and crooked the Juno Awards are.  It is completely controlled and voted by record company people, and Tom had to nads to tell it like it is.  Of course that's his real talent.  He can sing a song and make us all think he's singing of the place where we grew up.  And in typical Canadian style, is remembered and cherished more after he passes away.  I'm proud to say he is one of the finest Canadians and very happy that he lives a little over an hour from my house!  I hope new people DL this album and enjoy true Maple Leaf GOLD!"
