Who the fuck is Citizen Useless?
Formed in Jakarta in 2006 by the collective pooling of blue-collar sweat and beer-vomit. Citizen Useless was inevitable as there was nothing else for this bunch of guys to do other than make loud distorted music, drink scotch and the local Indonesian "anggur-merah", and masturbate to thoughts of half-naked punker bitches wearing 3-week-old underwear.

Citizen Useless' blend of high-intensity music, distorted guitars and intense live shows,  have been compared to Gorilla Biscuits, NOFX, Reagan Youth, U.S. Bombs, Warzone and Agnostic Front. Their first live demo CD received praise when it was release in 2008 and their first full-length studio CD was launched in August 2009 to much applause. Through tireless D.I.Y. efforts and unbending commitment, this motley crew of misfits hope to one day be personally satisfied with what they are doing. If not, they all plan to give up music and become bajaj drivers.
