I hope everyone who needs this kind of info will find their way to it, here or elsewhere! I am in the process of curing myself through natural means ( a big hell NO to synthetic prescriptions for me!) of a stubborn thyroid condition I have had for years,  and I know that Iodine will be a key part of that! Thanks again so much!! god bless.."
