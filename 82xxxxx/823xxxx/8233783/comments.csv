,Oneiromancer12,2013-03-09T06:17Z," But, you know, if you upload those 80's DC gems that I mentioned, your heroic status would go from remarkable to god-like... just saying :D"

,Oneiromancer12,2013-03-10T00:54Z,"Pfff, that's nothing compared to this. Anyone can jump in a parachute, but just a chosen few can upload The Question, Dr. Fate and The Spectre *wink*"
