,mystikal_87,2013-03-10T20:18Z,Can anyone verify the keygen works? Keeps telling me invalid install id
[V],scene4all,2013-03-11T02:24Z,"The keygen works just fine, you need to use the License Manger to activate the app. Click Start > All Programs > onOne Software > Perfect Photo Suite 7 > Documentation and select License Manager. Now the License Manager should pop up, select ""Phone/Email License"", copy the Installation ID from the License Manager and paste it into the keygen and click generate, in return the keygen should give you a valid Unlocking Key, copy it and paste it into the Manager and click Install License. Now it should say Product Successfully Unlocked!"
,mystikal_87,2013-03-11T13:48Z,"why didn't I RTFM -_- 
Thanks!"
,slasken69,2013-03-13T16:11Z,"Make sure you don't disable internet while doing the activation. I disabled my internet connection and I kept getting ""invalid id"" but once I started the internet connection again and following ""scene4all""s advise it works."
,totemr,2013-03-23T04:31Z,ok I am running Windows 8 64bit. I usually have great luck with xforce cracks but this one is not working. I have an internet connection and a pretty fresh install of my OS. The Generator tells me the Installation ID is not Valid I see I am not the only one having this issue. I tried restarting and still not working. 
,totemr,2013-03-23T04:44Z,Ok I got it working sorry about the previous comment. Thanks Xforce works like a charm everytime
,SpaceOctopus,2013-03-25T06:51Z,"Ok, I've tried everything....and I just can't seem to get it to work. It generates a string that is longer than what the window accepts, and it never accepts the unlock key.

BTW, if keygen keeps telling you it's an invalid installation ID, just put dashes inbetween every 4 numbers like 1234-1234-1234 (it took me a bit to figure that part out....it wasn't mentioned)
Oh and thanks so much for this, even though I can't get it to work, it sounds like it does for others and they might have just changed something. xforce rules "
,SpaceOctopus,2013-03-25T08:00Z,"Grrr...I can't believe how simple the problem was. Ok if you're having problems....like I retardedly did, you HAVE to run the License manager from the program files folder, not from the program itself. It's the only way to make it work. :) Thanks again, you guys rule!"
,diamonddogs,2013-04-18T11:28Z,"Followed instructions to the letter,says successfully unlocked.But when i open program click help and click about,and it says licence trial."
,diamonddogs,2013-04-18T13:36Z,"Just uninstalled and reinstalled,but this time i disabled anti virus and internet,but still shows licence as trial.
Although prior to putting unlock code it says unlimited licence then when i put unlock code in says successfully unlocked,but still says licence trial when i open program and click about.
Grateful for any help."

,diamonddogs,2013-04-19T10:40Z,"@fozler,Thanks for the link,works a treat."
,ha.beijer,2013-06-01T12:36Z,"1. Go to the program files OnOne folder
2. Run license manage.exe
3. copy the ID which is in 1234-1234-1234 format
4. copy and paste in keygenerator

dont use the 1234567890123 ID which is provided when starting up perfect photo suite 'for online/manual activation. That nr. does not work."
