,Kanyu88,2013-03-10T02:15Z,"acrackin It has to be a 6 digit x 3 code to be accepted, it wont accept it as a 5 digit x 3 code."
,Kanyu88,2013-03-10T02:26Z,"Okay, got it finally...

Use ""License Manager"" which is in the Documentation folder.

When you enter your installation ID it has to be in this format with the dashes in place.
XXXX-XXXX-XXXX"
,49538678,2013-03-10T05:45Z,scene4all...... Thank you. It worked like a charm.
,big_windows,2013-03-11T16:56Z,"OK, got it activated now - it was the xxxx-xxxx-xxxx format in the keygen. Thanks to all!"
,tomswiftx,2013-03-12T22:14Z,"I tried reformatting the license code, but it won't accept anything but six digit combinations WITHOUT dashes. Then I tried the license manager, which said invalid code.  So I get bad installation ID.

What am I doing wrong?  This is the Mac version. Thanks!"
,sarabear1,2013-04-11T00:11Z,So wait this software is only for Mac?????!!!
,sergiorodrigo,2013-04-21T00:38Z,"ok... first of all... English is not my first language but i try my best... 
For everyone has ""Bad Installation ID"" the ""solution"" is simple... from @scene4all thats right, but READ CAREFULLY... Use the License Manager to activate the app. Select Phone/Email License, status will show Evaluation Mode, copy the Installation ID from the License Manager /YOU WILL SEE 18 DIGITS WITHOUT DASHES/ and paste it into the keygen/YOU HAVE TO WRITE THE SAME 18 DIGITS WITH DASHES, FOR EXAMPLE: XXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXX / and click generate, in return the keygen will generate a valid Unlocking Key, copy it and paste it into the License Manager and click Install License and it should now say Product Successful Unlocked!"
