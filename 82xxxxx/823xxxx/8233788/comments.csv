,MistA01,2013-03-11T21:04Z,"X5 version crashes during rendering too.  Open a browser page to cover the program and it won't crash.  It's a graphics driver problem,  probably AMD.  Great upload,  btw"
,spen007,2013-03-20T15:10Z,Excellent! Quick & easy install on Windows 7 Ultimate (Brazilian Portuguese). Great job! Thank you!
,MistA01,2013-05-09T02:35Z,"Fixed the crashing.  If anyone gets this program,  here's how to fix it from crashing.  Google for a file called atimpenc.dll,  download it and copy it into both system32 and sysWOW64 folders inside your C:Windows folder.  Fixed mine and the program works flawlessly."

Indeed, scene4all is trusty as a trombone.
Heartfelt greetings and thanks to X-FORCE and scene4all all the way from the East!
