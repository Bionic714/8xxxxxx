A comprehensive survey of two thousand years of Christian voices for peace.

From the Sermon on the Mount to the twenty-first century, this broadly ecumenical reader recounts the Christian message of peace and nonviolence. Through testimony by the confessors and martyrs of the early church, the voices of medieval figures like St. Benedict and St. Francis, as well as Erasmus, the Lollards, Anabaptists, and Quaker abolitionists, up to modern peacemakers such as Martin Luther King, Jr., Thomas Merton, and Dorothy Day, Christian Peace and Nonviolence presents a coherent story in which the peace message of Jesus is restored to its central place.
