This Is An extremely, insanely good Progressive Trance Mix that I came by in the early 2000's. It was given to me by a coworker In original CD and I rip it on MP3 but eventually I lost the original CD somehow and I have no idea who mix it or who the artist is. But I can tell you for sure that It is indeed very good and Is one that I listened dozens of times. If you like Trance you won't be disappointed.
