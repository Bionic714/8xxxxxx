"I guess you call them Surfified-Psychobilly-Horror-Rock. With heavy guitar riffs and a swingin' upright bass, these Boise natives know where the bodies are dismembered and the pieces buried. Think Motorhead meets Mad-Sin, with a little Johnny Cash, Buddy Holly, GG Allin & Misfits. Their live show has left 'em speechless throughout the Northwest. Along with their sidekicks, Side Show A-Go-Go, they have been a non-stop touring machine, making ground meat out of audiences far & wide." - Amazon Editorial Review
