 : Former hacker Kevin Poulsen has, over the past decade, built a reputation  :
 : as one of the top investigative reporters on the cybercrime beat. In       :
 : Kingpin, he pours his unmatched access and expertise into book form for the:
 : first time, delivering a gripping cat-and-mouse narrative--and an          :
 : unprecedented view into the twenty-first century's signature form of       :
 : organized crime.                                                           :
 :                                                                            :
 : The word spread through the hacking underground like some unstoppable new  :
 : virus: Someone--some brilliant, audacious crook--had just staged a hostile :
 : takeover of an online criminal network that siphoned billions of dollars   :
 : from the US economy.                                                       :
 :                                                                            :
 : The FBI rushed to launch an ambitious undercover operation aimed at        :
 : tracking down this new kingpin; other agencies around the world deployed   :
 : dozens of moles and double agents. Together, the cybercops lured numerous  :
 : unsuspecting hackers into their clutches.... Yet at every turn, their      :
 : main quarry displayed an uncanny ability to sniff out their snitches and   :
 : see through their plots.                                                   :
 :                                                                            :
 : The culprit they sought was the most unlikely of criminals: a brilliant    :
 : programmer with a hippie ethic and a supervillain's double identity. As    :
 : prominent "white-hat" hacker Max "Vision" Butler, he was a celebrity       :
 : throughout the programming world, even serving as a consultant to the FBI. :
 : But as the black-hat "Iceman," he found in the world of data theft an      :
 : irresistible opportunity to test his outsized abilities. He infiltrated    :
 : thousands of computers around the country, sucking down millions of credit :
 : card numbers at will. He effortlessly hacked his fellow hackers, stealing  :
 : their ill-gotten gains from under their noses. Together with a             :
 : smooth-talking con artist, he ran a massive real-world crime ring.         :
 :                                                                            :
 : And for years, he did it all with seeming impunity, even as countless      :
 : rivals ran afoul of police.                                                :
 :                                                                            :
 : Yet as he watched the fraudsters around him squabble, their ranks riddled  :
 : with infiltrators, their methods inefficient, he began to see in their     :
 : dysfunction the ultimate challenge: He would stage his coup and fix what   :
 : was broken, run things as they should be run--even if it meant painting a  :
 : bull's-eye on his forehead.                                                :
 :                                                                            :
 : Through the story of this criminal's remarkable rise, and of law           :
 : enforcement's quest to track him down, Kingpin lays bare the workings of a :
 : silent crime wave still affecting millions of Americans. In these pages, we:
 : are ushered into vast online-fraud supermarkets stocked with credit card   :
 : numbers, counterfeit checks, hacked bank accounts, dead drops, and fake    :
 : passports. We learn the workings of the numerous hacks--browser exploits,  :
 : phishing attacks, Trojan horses, and much more--these fraudsters use to ply:
 : their trade, and trace the complex routes by which they turn stolen data   :
 : into millions of dollars. And thanks to Poulsen's remarkable access to both:
 : cops and criminals, we step inside the quiet, desperate arms race that law :
 : enforcement continues to fight with these scammers today.                  :
 :                                                                            :
 : Ultimately, Kingpin is a journey into an underworld of startling scope and :
 : power, one in which ordinary American teenagers work hand in hand with     :
 : murderous Russian mobsters and where a simple Wi-Fi connection can unleash :
 : a torrent of gold worth millions.                                          :
