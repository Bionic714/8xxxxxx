  A solo effort from Chris Carrabba, Swiss Army Romance was essentially acoustic emo. Aside from using an acoustic guitar, however, Carrabba sticks to the usual emo tropes , with personal lyrics that impressionable teenagers would find easy to relate to. His voice is powerful and heartful, and he displays how beautiful an acoustic guitar can sound, but he does brush against the samey sound that many emo artists encounter. What makes Swiss Army Romance stand out are the excellent songs, spotlighted by "Screaming Infidelities" and "Living in Your Letters."
