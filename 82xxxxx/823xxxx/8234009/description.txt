All episodes except Season 1 Ep. 10 

The quality is pretty bad. I'd say vhs but it's all I could find. The file size is rather large for a half hour show. Season 2 has 23 episodes but on episodeguide.com it says it should only have 22. 
 
I wish the quality was better but it's all I could find. I've been looking for this forever but couldn't find it anywhere. Not on dvd or vhs or anything. So I figured better this than nothing. If you find better copies let me know. Enjoy.
