Do you have the latest scans of Edison Rex or The Manhattan Projects or know where to find them?"
[T],MrDowntown,2013-03-09T04:40Z,All currently released issues of both those series are on TPB. MP #10 comes out next week and no date listed for ER #6
,eespi,2013-03-09T04:55Z,I see.  Thanks!
,wetbeak,2013-03-09T11:26Z,thanks for your efforts.. do you have any hints for a newby on how to perform a successful search . i have problems all the time. unsuccessful searches 'til someone helpful shows the way.
[T],MrDowntown,2013-03-11T02:33Z,"For comics go to the scroll box and select other>comics. use a specific keyword to narrow searches but not too specific because sometimes people spell things differently. For example Batman Lil gotham and Batman L'il gotham etc. if you search lil you wont get l'il, if you searched batman you'll get a thousand results and gotham youd probably be best. For which of multiple copies, the most seeded, you can also click on 'uploaded' to see what are the most recent uploads to find the newest issue of something. hope that made sense"
[T],MrDowntown,2013-03-11T02:38Z,"So for the example above search for edison or manhattan, and select other>comics in the drop down box and you should see all issues of those series that have been uploaded.

and try variations: spider-man then spiderman, then spider* Asterisk means (etc)"
