 VERA MESMER, the Los Angeles-based alternative rock band featuring ex-COAL CHAMBER bassist Nadja Peulen and former REVEILLE guitarist Chris Turner (a.k.a. Christopher Mesmer), will release its long-awaited EP, "Orphans", on November 8. Produced by Turner, mixed by Sean Beaven (MARILYN MANSON, NINE INCH NAILS) and mastered by Maor Appelbaum (SEPULTURA, HALFORD), the CD tells the story of how Chris and Nadja met and takes the listeners on their mystical journey.
