"Broken"

After three years of searching for 
Amelia, Lucy's frustration and fury 
peaks. When she takes matters with 
Calvin into her own hands, he offers 
an unthinkable deal for Amelia's 
return. As Martin and Jake search for 
Lucy, they enlist Trevor at Breakwire 
to help. Meanwhile, Guillermo is 
reeling from his recent sins in 
Mexico, and he makes some 
life-changing decisions after running 
into a defeated man hiking through 
the Arizona desert.
