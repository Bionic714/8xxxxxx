 : Paris, 1937. Andras Lévi, a Hungarian-Jewish architecture student, arrives :
 : from Budapest with a scholarship, a single suitcase, and a mysterious      :
 : letter he promised to deliver. But when he falls into a complicated        :
 : relationship with the letter's recipient, he becomes privy to a secret that:
 : will alter the course of his--and his family's--history. From the small    :
 : Hungarian town of Konyár to the grand opera houses of Budapest and Paris,  :
 : from the despair of Carpathian winter to an unimaginable life in labor     :
 : camps, The Invisible Bridge tells the story of a family shattered and      :
 : remade in history's darkest hour.
