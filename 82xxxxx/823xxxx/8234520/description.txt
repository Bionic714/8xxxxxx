Ever play the classic microsoft pinball back when they had it on windows xp, and the version before, and yet after upgrading to vista hated how you no longer had access to it? Well now you can! this RAR file has all the files from that game, nothing has been moded or anything, it has been 100% tested and works with Vista, 7, AND WINDOWS 8!!! hope you all enjoy this
