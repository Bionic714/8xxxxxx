,highresjunkie,2013-03-09T08:17Z,43 gigs? Is this a joke? As if your 10gig version wasn't overkill enough? lol 1080's look just fine even when compressed down to 2gigs or so on everything but the very largest monitors... I cannot understand why you crank up your bitrates so far past what is necessary...
,OmniNegro,2013-03-09T09:14Z,"I believe the size is that big because it is a lossless copy. It is not a lossy transcode like most others. And there *ARE* reasons to do this. If you want to transcode something to your own specifications, having the unaltered originals like this is what you must do. Otherwise you get transcode anomalies stacked on top of more transcode anomalies.

Most of those 2GB transcodes were made from the original Blu Ray disc. If they were a transcode from a 10-12GB transcode from the original, it would retain a fraction of the real quality that it would have if you went directly over from the originals to your intended size.

This has everything the original has. The audio, the subtitles, every last thing."

This is the ENTIRE BluRay in FULL unaltered quality.  If your internet is too crappy to download files this large then get better internets or stop complaining"

Even at the risk of suffering just repeating the other posters, I feel you need to be shamed into understanding what this is.

This is a replica of the blu-ray disc.   The full quality and image with every special feature etc included.

If you were a TRUE ""high def junkie"" as your name suggests, you would understand and appreciate what this is.

As others have stated, there are plenty of compressed 720p versions more to your liking.  Go get those instead."
