It took until March of 2013 for me to finally hear all of the albums and projects on my list from 2012, and to then narrow that down into my top 100 songs for the year. It was a great year for Hip-Hop!

I put this list together to share great Hip-Hop and a lot of slept-on gems with the masses and to emphasize the fact that REAL Hip-Hop is very much alive. If most of these artists and songs are unknown to you, I highly recommend you give it a listen. You won't find many commercial Hip-Hop artists or songs that were on the radio on this list.

I've attempted to highlight a number of different projects and artists, but more or less, it's a collection of my favorite Hip-Hop and Rap songs of 2011. It is, of course, very subjective. There was a tremendous amount of great music, and it was very difficult to narrow this down to 100 songs and near-impossible to order them. I had to leave off songs from a lot of very good projects and albums. I could have easily turned this into a Top 200 list! But I'm happy with it, and I hope you enjoy it.

Songs are judged based on lyricism, production, concepts, overall sound and vibe, and a combination of all of those. The only rule I have when making the list: No more than 3 tracks from a single project. Other than that, it's just the best of the best.

I've provided some insight into why certain songs were included throughout the list, as well as a more in-depth description for the Top 10 records of the year.
