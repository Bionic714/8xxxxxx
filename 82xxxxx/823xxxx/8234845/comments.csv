,Secretz.R.Us,2013-03-10T02:02Z,"Wait, what? Did I read right? This can be used on an external HDD? If so, you are truly my hero, Hero!"
,ryussf,2013-03-10T12:35Z,Has anyone recently tested this to see if it works?
,Evi1d33d,2013-03-11T01:12Z,"Doesn't work on 4.30, just shows the DUPLEX logo then goes back to XMB. Unless someone can post settings confirming that it works, I'm calling this a dud."
,revente,2013-03-11T01:52Z,"Works for me on rogero 4.30
Had to edit the archives file in usrdir folder with notepad and change the top numberfrom 17 to 15 and I delete 4 lines with filenames not present in that folder. Im writing that from my phone but if i recall properly filenames you have to delete are: extracin1.psarc extracin2.psarc mpresources.psarc and mp-english or something like that"
,yarrmateys45,2013-03-11T02:16Z,"something wrong with this.
Using the EBOOT and PARAM.SFO that are in the USRDIR. it doesnt work.
Just loads the duplex logo and quits to XMB.

I tried switching external data, BD mirror, and direct boot, but didnt work either.

Anyone got this to work on rogero 4.30?

I might try getting the original eboot and param SFO from elsewhere to see if it works."
,Evi1d33d,2013-03-11T02:34Z,"Alright, got the bloody thing to work. Just like Revente said, modify the ARCHIVE file in USRDIR with notepad."
,yarrmateys45,2013-03-11T02:41Z,"thanks revente! you're the man.
I saw your comment after I posted mine.

I did like you said

Edited archives file with notepad in USRDIR
changed 17 to 15 in the first line, and then removed the following lines
EXTRASCIN1.PSARC
EXTRASCIN2.PSARC
MP-RESOURCES.PSARC
MULTIPLAYER.PSARC

now works with no issues!"
,stoffinho17,2013-03-11T02:53Z,"Open the file ARCHIVES in USRDIR with notepad. Remove this lines in the file:

EXTRASCIN1.PSARC
EXTRASCIN2.PSARC
MP-RESOURCES.PSARC
MULTIPLAYER.PSARC

...and change 17 to 15. Now it should work :)"
,stoffinho17,2013-03-11T02:56Z,RE yarrmateys45: I also saw your comment after I posted mine. I can confirm that it's working.

,bigboss316,2013-03-11T14:42Z,"just follow the instruction above (thanks revente) and make sure you have ps3 disc in your bluray drive, this is not discless folks, i'm using rogero 4.30 btw and latest multiman release (4.20.04) i've been playing for hours now, no glitch or whatsoever, good copy! thanks to the uploader you save me a lot of bandwidth."

,uceramti,2013-03-26T06:24Z,"Works on Kmeaw 3.55 
To transfer the game over FTP (install a FTP server found on Google, put the FTP file on a USB stick, plug it in the PS3,  the file should have a .pkg ending. Install FileZilla on your PC, google a bit how to make a connection.


I did as mentioned above.
Locate the Archive file in USRDIR
Open Archive file in Notepad (right click open in Notepad)
Remove (delete)
EXTRASCIN1.PSARC
 EXTRASCIN2.PSARC
 MP-RESOURCES.PSARC
 MULTIPLAYER.PSARC
 Change 17 (in my case it was 19) to 15.
Save the Archive in.

Transfer the whole game BCES01741 to Hdd0/GAMES folder. it will take a while 15 mins+.

Go to PS3, close the FTP connection after the whole game is transfered.

Start Multiman, you should have the latest version, google it and update it. Same process as installing FTP software on your PS3.

Under Games, you'll see God Of War, press Triangle /_ , choose settings, set permissions. Let it work for 10 seconds.
Choose INTERNAL on the left menu.

Press Start.

You'll be thrown to XBMC menu, the original PS3 menu.

Game God of War will be visible on the menu.

Start the game.

You'll be asked to install version 1,03, click O to cancel.

The game will start.

Remember, no eboot fixing.
You need to have a game (any kind of game) in your PS3, it might not be necessary.
Newest version of Multiman.
You have to set game to INTERNAL.
The game must be on your internal HDD (hard disc drive)  Might work on external, haven't tried.

Follow the steps, dont miss anything, worked for me right away.

Ohh, I encountered an other small problem, if you dont have any space left on your HDD, the game will quit automatically due to auto save wont be possible.

Hope this helped the rookies."
,nikkid33,2013-04-25T03:20Z,"ok sorry everyone i am new to this whole thing, exactly what is 'seeding'?

,Alexnader78,2013-05-02T19:58Z,"Got it to work with a disc in the drive, installed on HDD, with rogero 4.40 and after modifying the ARCHIVES file.

Is there any way to get it to work without a disc inserted ? with the other EBOOTs or something ?

Other than that, perfect."
