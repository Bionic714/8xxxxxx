,WuzzlePopple,2013-03-22T17:43Z,"Thank you so much for uploading this.
I seen that it was released.
I also see you have no seeders but 2 leechers, so I will seed extra longer than I usually do.
There's usually seeders on torrents I download."
,WuzzlePopple,2013-03-22T17:52Z,"Just start the seed again for me and then I can start helping you out.
This torrent is kinda new, so their might be a lot of people who don't know this is up or even released, yet."
,WuzzlePopple,2013-03-23T00:38Z,"OK, stuck at 77.7%. I only got the first 3 episodes and also the last 3, ep#30, 31, and 32.

The rest I need seeds to complete.

I can keep seeding the 6 episodes I do have though.

,WuzzlePopple,2013-03-24T02:40Z,Thank You! I got it all. Now seeding.

,WuzzlePopple,2013-04-14T22:44Z,"Hi pablito90s. My computer crashed and now this torrent is gone, says this torrent error: check data error (cyclic redundancy check).
I did get all the cartoons and I did seed for awhile until that happened but somehow can not figure out how to get it back to seeding, just keeps coming up as a red bar and error. Sorry about that :("
,RyeRoiben,2013-05-02T02:33Z,"I am stuck at 54.3% - Can anyone seed this?
I am on my laptop now, but I plan to move the files to my tower and seed the hell out of this.
I recently rediscovered this gem from my childhood and I'm excited to watch it!"
,pablito90s,2013-05-07T08:40Z,"@RyeRoiben I seeding ...
@WuzzlePopple no problem"
