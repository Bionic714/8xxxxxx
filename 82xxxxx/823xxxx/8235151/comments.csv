,Dimmis80,2013-03-10T12:14Z,"Hey mate jmanwf.I have a problem with the videos.!U know i watch the episodes in my TV with a digital media player ""AC Ryan"".I put them in an external HD and then i conect the HD in my player and i watch them like that.The problem ocures in the final 3-4 minutes of the episodes because the video goes to fast and i can't watch it!I don't push the button to go faster it just hapen at its own and if i push the pause button and again ther play  button it wont help.Nor if i go back in the minutes and play again the vid.All my other videos movies,series and stuff goes very normal and stuff so i don't think its my Hardware problem.!So do u have an idea what is happening or what is the problem.??"
