Sadowitz does not release any dvd or audio discs,  which is a pity,   this means he has no material available to his fans,   which makes no sense really,   so he shouldnt complain about people sharing what theyve got online,   as the alternative is nothing at all.  

I suggest he makes a live dvd and sell it ,   as most people will want to see what a performer is like BEFORE they go to a show,   of course if he intentionally wants to reduce his fan base,  then it has certainly worked,  but they why moan when shows are half empty ?

you cant have it both ways .   either promote, or dont moan.    and Im sure all the hours he spends eliminting youtube uploads etc ,  could me much better spend promoting himself.

the guy is clearly a C*NT it seems !
