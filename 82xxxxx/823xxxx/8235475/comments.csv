,cetme308,2013-03-10T21:14Z,You're welcome!  It actually started as a way to get the files to a Dr. friend on the other side of the world...  I had no idea it would be so popular.  I just wish my upload speed was a bit faster.
,hentaiw,2013-03-13T10:42Z,"dear sir, i love ur collection, and want to help seeding.
my D drive is the destination for torrent, but i need to move to drive J after finishing, for enough space in D to get new part. How can I change seeding souce from D to J so I can continue seeding old parts ???
and, thanks, u are a gentleman and scholar"
,pringles9,2013-03-13T19:02Z,"Assuming you use µTorrent:
Stop the torrent. Move the folder from drive D to J. Right-click the torrent in µTorrent -> Advanced -> Set download location (or delete only the torrent and re-add it). Point it to the new location and start the torrent. It should automatically do a hash check on the files to make sure they're complete."
