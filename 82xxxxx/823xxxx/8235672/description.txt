Packaging plays an essential role in limiting undesired microbial growth and sensory deterioration. This book provides a comprehensive review of both current and emerging technologies for the effective packaging of muscle foods.
Part one provides a comprehensive overview of key issues concerning the safety and quality of packaged meat, poultry and seafood. Parts two and three go on to investigate developments in vacuum and modified atmosphere packaging for both fresh and processed muscle foods and the packaging of processed, frozen, ready-to-serve and retail-ready meat, seafood and poultry products, as well as advances in sausage casings and in-package pasteurization. The final section explores emerging labeling and packaging techniques, such as environmentally-compatible, antimicrobial and antioxidant active packaging for meat and poultry, edible films, smart packaging systems, and issues regarding traceability and regulation.
