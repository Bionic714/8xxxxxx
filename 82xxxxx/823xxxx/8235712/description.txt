It's always a good day for a funeral at St. Mark's Middle School. Andy & Charlie, two altar servers, don't just get to miss class anytime a parishioner kicks the bucket, they cut out early and play hooky as soon as the service is over. Eventually their irreverent personalities will put them in situations that are too big for them to handle.

Remember to seed so others can get the same enjoyment of the movie that you've got.
Keep in mind I can not give full speed to all, so if you're one of the lucky ones, help seed.
