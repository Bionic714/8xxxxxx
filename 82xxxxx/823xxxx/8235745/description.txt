Winner of the 2012 International BAFTA Award, Borgen is a hit Danish drama series about the fight for political power and the personal consequences for everyone involved.
The second season returns two years into Birgitte Nyborg's term as Denmark's first female Prime Minister. Politically, she has succeeded in earning the respect of her allies as well as her enemies, but tensions between parties are mounting, and Birgitte is forced to make more and more shaky compromises. The growing pressure causes her to doubt whether she can maintain both her position and her integrity.

The ambitious and idealistic television journalist Katrine FÃ¸nsmark is now working as a star journalist at the Ekspres, where editor-in-chief, Michael Laugesen, challenges her journalistic morals. Kasper Juul continues his professional role as the cynical spin doctor for Birgitte Nyborg. Privately he is trying to make peace with his inner demons and keep them from sabotaging his relationship with a new girlfriend.
