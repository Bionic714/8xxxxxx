,stfu_or_die,2013-03-10T03:12Z,"Hard to tell if it is good or shit. Right off the bat I thought shit, but then saw that it stars Mickey Rourke. This Kellan Lutz chump is apparently only known for Twilight movies, and can't act at all from 2 or 3 lines he has in the trailer. Can't find a review anywhere. Tough to decide, maybe someone with some competence will watch and can leave a worthy review."
,freeegatee,2013-03-10T03:57Z,Thank you very much.
,AkaPhsyco,2013-03-10T06:36Z,"Dear people who upload stuff on here:

Thank you and all that for being the backbone of the pirate revolution and yada yada yada-
can you just put the friggn IMBD link in please??? I mean, fuck. ""Screen caps"" and ""alt screen caps"" and ""seed data"" ""directors dogs' name"" - - do we really need any of this shit in the description? NO
So can we just put the fuckin IMDB link in so I can just click on it without taking the 13 seconds required to c and p the title and google search the shit? I'm sure we all got a lot of whacking it to do and ain't time just precious?

TY ty TY

Much Love,

Thanks again extremezone"
,ht0fff,2013-03-11T04:48Z,"@LegoLazze learn to read, you stupid shit. 

I can see that there are no subs included, so telling me I need subs despite the fact that there are no subtitles available anywhere makes this comment useless.

Which makes my comment the truth and yours just a rant.

,ht0fff,2013-03-11T08:40Z,"@thatshitcray are you really incapable of reading? my original post was accurate. I just used the f-word and everybody thinks it's personal.

Instead of telling me to shut up, maybe you can be a little be more productive and post the link to the subtitles."

Google won't find subtitles for this movie. If anyone CAN find subtitles, please post a link, thanks."
,ht0fff,2013-03-12T03:03Z,"@gvltd well, another useless advice. Did you actually try to search before posting this comment?
I searched with Google and on 4 different subtitle sites directly.
Why do you think did I post a comment in the first place?"

A straight to video does not usually mean any quality acting and it ends up being one of those don't waste your time downloading/watching. "

You feel like you've missed the first 30 minutes of the film when it starts!  Actually not a bad flick for the first half of the movie.  Then, as usual it turns to shit, Hollywood crap, car chases and worse.  It's like the guy made a 45 minute movie to fill an hour and a half time slot.

But thanks, Zone!"
