,jinvonoe,2013-03-09T14:43Z,"@brandonNINTENDO That's great. More power to you. I'm sure there's a government subcommittee somewhere that tracks all ""first"" and ""second"" comments all over the net and promptly award them with the National Award for Preemptive Discourse on national TV. I hear they also have a shiny gold medal to go with it."

,nikosva,2013-03-09T17:16Z,"@jinvonoe // I guess ""first"" refers to the 1st uploader for this movie, so no need to be obnoxious"

,Clig,2013-03-09T19:05Z,"This movie looks good. Too bad the spoken language in this film IS NOT English, according to the trailer, so I will not be downloading it. I'll wait for an American version."

,Lardzor,2013-03-09T21:54Z,"@nikosva: Maybe, if it (and every other 'First' post) wasn't the very first post on a thread. No, just like there are some people who have to have the last word, there are some people that have to have the first word. Even if it has absolutely no value."
,baldwheel,2013-03-09T22:50Z,"You halfwits saying this movie looks good, did you not see that Eric Roberts is one of the lead actors?"

,jenerik1,2013-03-10T05:29Z,"=spolier!!!=

So, let me get this straight, this is a movie where Peter Greene plays a corrupt and perverted cop who kidnaps a guy, dresses him in a BDSM mask and chains him in the basement...

Zed is dead, baby, Zed is dead.  "
