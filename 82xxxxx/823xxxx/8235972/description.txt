  "Login" is a Hindi feature film about three   
  different individuals and how the Internet    
  and social networking sites affect their      
  lives. True to its caption Connected online   
  but disconnected in life, the film portrays   
  how everyone is glued to Internet and hence   
  getting away from their true selves.          
  Going online and browsing networking sites    
  is not a bad thing. In fact, if used in the   
  right perspective, it is a great tool to the  
  human kind. But fraudsters, perverts, and     
  bad-minds to exploit and take undue advantage 
  of the same use the very same Internet. And   
  the victims in most of these cases are        
  innocents. What if these elements creep into  
  your personal space? Will you feel tempted    
  and fall prey? These are the questions that   
  Login tries to introspect.
