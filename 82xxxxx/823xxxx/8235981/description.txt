Lobo is one of those talented artists from the Seventies that everyone has heard of, but can't place. His most famous hit was, "Me And You And A Dog Named Boo", a number one hit with a romantic breezy feel with simple chords and lyrics. "I'd Love You To Want Me" was also a big number with Robert Johnson guesting as back-up falsetto vocalist.

The rest of the album is a smart selection of love songs and low key poetic verses of the typical Top 40 genre, but presented extremely well. "A Big Red Kite" is masterful in it's simplicity and mood and "A Simple Man" contains Lobo's earmarked guitar work. A special selection is "Rings", a huge 1971 hit by the group Cymarron that Lobo sings with the same magic.

If you like one of the songs on this collection, you'll like them all. It's first rate seventies pop.
