YIFY works hard...obviously..but the ""Product"" is 100% ""McTorrent"".

Once Uh-Gain..the absence of Real ""Artistry"" in Torrent File ""Production"" leaves OUT ACTUAL ""subtitles"".

Yify torrents literally ""Never"" possess hardcoded English Subs for NON English speaking scenes.

Now for ""The Mummy"" its not a big deal..older film etc..but for films like ""Premium Rush"" ..""Argo"" et al the reality of ""Artist UL'ers vs. McTorrent UL'ers"" becomes apparent.

""Subs"" is NOT the ""Same As"" ""Constant 'ON' English Subtitles As If For Hearing Impaired"".

No! They Aren't!

Who wants to watch a movie with subtitles 'On' for the whole film just to be able to understand the plot critical non-English moments?

Truly Sorry but it's Sloppy Work.

McTorrent's should be labeled as such just like 'Junk Food'."
