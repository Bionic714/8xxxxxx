I can't say why that problem on your phone.
But after 20 testers have use it without problem include my-self, it run perfect without problem.
I think you have to wait until the final comes :)

Have fun :)"

,cowidster,2013-03-15T11:09Z,"It's working. Thanks ScorpioPirate.

BTW how to download new map? I only have old map, copy-paste it from my old sygic, how to renew it?"
,Fan.Feed,2013-03-20T14:12Z,"Your effort is appreciated. Although the app reports itself as 12.3.0 Still newer than the official versions. Now waiting for the Maps to finish downloading before commenting on the working part of it. But, I am sure it would work flawlessly."
