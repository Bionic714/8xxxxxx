[T],[D],2013-03-09T17:27Z,"Like always, it extracts in the wrong place.
It will extract in a 'tomb raider' folder inside tomb raider folder. Just copy and paste in proper folder.
And then modify skidrow.ini to language 'english' instead of russian.
It adds quite a few important fixes, and much better looking and performance to tressfx hair."
,djh816,2013-03-09T17:27Z,"Works great.

FOR ENGLISH: Edit skidrow ini in text editor to say english instead -_-"
,Performer81,2013-03-09T17:38Z,It also works with the nosteam release
,djh816,2013-03-09T17:39Z,"Edit: I lied, game still crashes after few minutes of play as usual. Intel integrated graphics and NVidea 560ti."
,aldwin123,2013-03-09T18:00Z,is it just me or does the glitches for intel gpus still exist? Because it didnt fix the black patches in the water for me
,djh816,2013-03-09T18:03Z,Same crashing issues. nvid 560ti and integrated intel.
,DragonFun,2013-03-09T18:14Z,makes game Russian 
,DragonFun,2013-03-09T18:20Z,also after applying patch on game folder and applying skidrow files in the exe doesnt change version.
,DragonFun,2013-03-09T18:56Z,scratch that last one games patched but i still cant get the block and tackle
,MiniZaggy,2013-03-09T19:12Z,still crashing with nvidia. need to change the langage in the skidrow.ini file
,ballsack99,2013-03-09T20:18Z,"still crashing on Nvidia.....just as much or more than before! damn, thanks anyway"
,chrisroberts3,2013-03-09T21:38Z,Now it crashes with Nvidia Geforce 600 series cards like never before. What kind of fix patch is this shit? 
,lontrus,2013-03-09T22:23Z,"I dont know but for me the game dont freeze anymore...
maybe it was this update or maybe cause i turned shadows off in options

if you guys who game still crashes then try to turn shadows off and if then the game dont crash maybe it helps

i have intel E8600 and geforce 9800gt everything is ultra and shadows is off with resolution 720p "
,ftskamins,2013-03-09T23:42Z,you are playing the game in dx9 mode...different story...
,Stemborer,2013-03-10T10:54Z,@HeroMaster does this patch work with Tomb Raider SE 2013 DLC RePack MULTi13-z10yded that you posted??
,lontrus,2013-03-10T11:27Z,"well it worked for someone who had gtx 560ti with shadow off and no crashing thats why i tried and my game dont freeze anymore ... it frozed every after 10-15min of game play

just try to turn off shadows and try if it works"
,dandalis,2013-03-10T12:04Z,"those who have Nvidia and gettings crashes - turn tesselation, TressFX hair and exclusive fullscreen off, also lower ambient occlusion and AA to get smooth fps."
,Carlozero,2013-03-10T20:14Z,dosent fix my damn issue with my 360 gamepad i can't use the camera to look south west it just stops up now thats freaking annoying
,theokein,2013-03-10T21:04Z,"Does this works with the REPACK version ""Tomb Raider SE 2013 DLC RePack MULTi13-z10yded""? 
Please confirm. Thanks!"
,hollisb,2013-03-10T23:33Z,"I beat the game with no patch, to get rid of the crashes just turn off tessellation. I'm not going to download this due to the mixed review in the comments. "
,erikdravn,2013-04-29T02:07Z,"To fix the Russian language just edit the SKIDROW.ini file.

Is there anyway to host a private lan based multiplayer?  Would LOVE to do so if possible."
