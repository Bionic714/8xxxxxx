,unholychild,2013-03-10T17:26Z,"Awesome, thank you"
,peryko,2013-03-12T00:22Z,"Please, how can I get these to work?
I copied files like you explained, but I can see these games, what category they appear in?
What do I have to do? I haven't been able to run them. Do I need to run the Bioshock game or what?
Thank you in advance."
,fireman644,2013-03-12T02:13Z,"Once you've transferred them to your HDD.  When you play either Bioshock or Bioshock 2 they will show up in the menu as downloaded content.  Also, you can check the SYSTEM blade and go to STORAGE and see the content in each of the games corresponding folders.  Hope this helps!"
,CovetingMonster,2013-03-12T04:05Z,"Ok this maybe my fault.
Just to make it clear to everyone 
I dont think this is the full bioshock game
I think its only the addons. adlease thats 
what i got when I got it on my system.

~Thank You"
,fireman644,2013-03-12T20:19Z,This is just the addons!!
,fireman644,2013-03-15T03:25Z,How's it working for everyone?  Any complaints?
,novax2776,2013-03-19T17:30Z,"could you elaborate on where the files go (foldder names) on the drive, such as content/000000000000/xxxxxxxx/0000002?  Never used Horizon or modio, always just ftp'd into the drive."
,fireman644,2013-03-28T22:59Z,"Horizon is your best bet.  I've never used FTP since Horizon is just drag and drop.  That's it!  Just like using Windows my friend.  Just remember to rehash and resign before you put them on your drive and you're good to go.  Although, since these are DRM free I'm not sure you even have to do that.  The Horizon website is an excellent resource to find all the information you need on transferring files.  Hope this helps!"
