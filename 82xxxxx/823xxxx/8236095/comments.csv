,Namorax,2013-03-09T17:39Z,My guess is sending this to korea was part of the UN punishment of kim jong
,extremedownloader,2013-03-09T17:52Z,"good or bad copy??
really wanted to see this movie so any feedback is greatly appreciated"
,oobaka,2013-03-09T19:45Z,"Video is poor (maybe a 6) with hard coded korean subs
audio is, at best, a 7"
[V],Horrorspoke,2013-03-09T19:51Z,Well my personal opinion is that mine is better. But hey-ho! each to their own!

,srnm123,2013-03-10T02:54Z,Gay awesome movie! Not fact!
,zakimar5,2013-03-10T03:19Z,"I like Cruise enough in some roles, but he's not a tough guy. Even Jason Statham or that loser Daniel Craig can't pull off tough guy. Clive Owen on the other hand can."
,ptv83,2013-03-10T03:50Z,"jack reacher in the book is a Chris Hemsworth or Dwayne 'the rock' johnson type of built guy.. not tiny little tom cruise.

if you've read a single page... the movie will bug you.. if not just turn your brain off and relax for an hour after a beter copy comes out.

Horrorspoke, how the shit can your copy be better? still xvid and 300mb smaller in size.
same encode format, same source, but smaller size=less than maximum potential quality .. add in you cropped the screen to cut out the subs and you've lost part of the movie.. much much more of the movie than the subs were covering infact.

Horrorspoke.. don't spam peoples torrents, that's extremezone's thing :barf:"

It wouldn't even look good on an old tube tv.  Choppy, severely pixelated, and has Asian subtitles embedded.  You could reduce the thing down to 300mb and it would look the same.  No idea why it's 1.29G.

* a little bit of distortion in the audio, but audible.
* a few Korean characters here and there, but you get used to them after awhile.
* video a little murky, but good enough to view.
* decent story - good enough to watch once. because of perhaps the requirements for the character, there weren't any real, couch-jumping emotions required by the fudge-packing Scientologist."

One of Cruise's best movies. At least he isn't just beating on people like Stallone, Schwarzenegger, Willis, Seagal, Van Damme and those other OLD men always do. And it exposes the truth about how Americans raped even children in Iraq.

Wait until more people have accepted the format you love today as much as they loved XviD a couple of years ago. Until then stop bitching. I come here because I can't afford to update my technology every other week. 

Somebody else has the format you want if XviD isn't it. Apparently most people seem to think it's good enough or he wouldn't ul it and so many people wouldn't dl it.  "
