Have fun!

Game info:
During battle, different body parts can be targeted to
disable the enemy. For instance, attacks to the legs
will slow them down, while blows to the arms will weaken
their attacks. By strategically striking key areas of
the body, players can strip the enemy of their ability
to fight. There are 2 main characters in Last Rebellion,
Nine (male) and Aisha (female). Nine is a Blade, whose
specialty is physical attacks, and Aisha is a Sealer, who
uses magic spells to attack & seal enemies. The player
can switch back and forth between the two during the
battle. Since Nine and Aisha share a single, the player
must strategically choose which character to execute
their attacks first. Because of this, Last Rebellion is
no ordinary RPG with another mindless battle system.
The player must be aware of which enemies they are
fighting against, and use their experience and strategy
throughout the game.
