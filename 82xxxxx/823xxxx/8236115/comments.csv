,tyl3rdurd3n,2013-03-09T16:25Z,Would be nice if a 1080p 'open matte' version was uploaded.
,tyl3rdurd3n,2013-03-09T16:26Z,720p here: http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7593834/Titanic.1997.720p.OPEN.MATTE.BluRay.x264-HDChina_[PublicHD]
[T],[D],2013-03-09T17:22Z,"The open matte is from the 3D disc, which means it comes with modified brightness and colors, and with a much worse encode."
,tyl3rdurd3n,2013-03-09T18:19Z,"I think I'll choose the full-screen viewing experience even if it's bad quality, if there is in fact a trade-off here. 

In my opinion the open matte 720p version looked pretty good. I'd say even better than the regular 720p encode that I watched first. But that's okay if you can't upload. :)"
,44414,2013-03-28T09:17Z,Is this d 194mins version? cos the one I have has a resolution of 1920*836 and a runtime of 186mins...
[T],[D],2013-03-28T10:39Z,194 minutes.
,44414,2013-03-28T13:51Z,Why does the copy I have run for 186 minutes... Is it because of the fps or any deleted scenes?
[T],[D],2013-03-28T17:27Z,"If yours is 25 fps, then it would be about same runtime.
However, 25fps would be wrong framerate for this, there are no bluray discs for this movie in 25 fps, the one encoding it must have been clueless.
PAL no longer exists in bluray world, 25 fps is used only for stuff that has been shot originally like that, and sometimes by some obscure lame distributors in germany and UK."
,44414,2013-03-29T05:15Z,You're right about the fps...Well then I think I will d/l this copy then... Thanks for d effort :)
,drol073,2013-03-30T09:41Z,Can somebody PLEASE explain to me what this 10 BIT ENCODE means & how is it different from a 8 bit encode in terms of quality & compatibility?
[T],[D],2013-03-30T16:01Z,It's not compatible with hardware players (like externals) and has a bit better compression than 8bit. That's it in short.
,icepax,2013-03-31T15:29Z,"@[D]: ""PAL no longer exists in bluray world..."" Half truth! NTSC and PAL standards don't apply to High Definition (HD) content but may apply to Standard Definition (SD) content on Bluray Discs (like extras, opening logos, trailers, FBI warnings, etc).

PAL is used in Europe, UK, Australia and other places (over half the world). NTSC is the American competing standard. To say that PAL is lame means you don't understand anything at all about TV standards, film standards or video distributed regulations.

You need to research a bit more before making such grandeur statements and half-truths..."
,icepax,2013-03-31T15:35Z,"Also, European Bluray players will play NTSC content but US Bluray players will not play PAL content..."
,joegi50,2013-06-01T07:14Z,Thanks D for the higher AV standards
