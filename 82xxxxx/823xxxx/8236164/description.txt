The Leisure Suit Larry: Box Office Bust video game gives gamers an all-access pass to the glitz, glamour and gorgeous women of Tinseltown. In this 3rd person adventure game, Larry takes a summer job working on his uncle Larrys movie lot doing odd jobs and trying to uncover a mole from another studio who threatens to air the studio's dirty laundry in the tabloids. Leisure Suit Larry: Box Office Bust is a rollicking, innuendo-laden lampoon of Hollywood that features open world sand box game play that includes exploration, platforming, racing and puzzle-solving to complete missions. Additionally, the game features an all-new Directors Game that allows the player to create their very own "Larry Feature." True to form, Leisure Suit Larry Box Office Bust features sophomoric comedy and bombshell babes thanks to the writing talents of Allen Covert and an All-Star cast of actors and actresses, including Jay Mohr, Dave Attell, Shannon Elizabeth, Carmen Elektra, Patrick Warburton, Jeffrey Tambor, Nikki Cox, Peter Graves, Jane Lynch and Josh Keaton as the voice of Larry Loveage.
