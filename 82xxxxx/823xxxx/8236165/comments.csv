Karolus and LEvEL got all creds for this sub."
,highresjunkie,2013-03-11T12:15Z,"qusawa, youre an idiot. YIFY does not do ""crap."" Elitist jackasses like you try and act like anything that isnt 5.1 surround is substandard. What idiots like you apparently fail to realize is that probably over 90% of people downloading movies here do not even HAVE a 5.1 surround system, so 2 channel audio is STANDARD. Only elitist assholes would try and act like anything thats not 5.1 is crap. Get over yourself. There's not a damned thing wrong with 2 channel stereo since thats what MOST people require."

,mat5roj,2013-03-15T13:48Z,Excellent quality. Thank you for the movie.
,coykoi,2013-03-19T16:23Z,"lol at someone named ""Highresjunkie"" defending YIFY's work.

YIFY sucks because his video quality is substandard and low tier even for small 1080p rips and his audio is suckish. anonxmous is the place to go for small sized rips with good quality."
,ftk,2013-04-04T17:07Z,"Amazing stuff Zen_bud! thanks. Big fan of your downloads after I was shown how good small size files can be. Would you be able to do a Bluray rip of Daniel Day Lewis movie THE BOXER?

Thanks!"
