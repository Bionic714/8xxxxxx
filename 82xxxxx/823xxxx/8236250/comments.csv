Nice Picture..not too much ""crunchiness""..HOWEVER..Utterly Useless McTorrent as regards the actual ""Film"".

Sadly..the mortal fatal flaw in YIFY torrents is here Displayed To Extremes.

ZERO Hard Subs.

So okay..hey...turn English Subs ""on"" and ""off"" every five minutes OR simply GUESS at the huge..much more than usual ('Argo'..'Premium Rush' et al) non-English speaking scenes.

In Mummy 1 the ""Ancient Egyptian"" is at minimum 25 minutes worth of the film.

MORE for Mummy 2.

And Mandarin Ancient or Otherwise for Mummy 3 is ABSOLUTELY Plot Critical and..Non-Existent.

Also..guess what? Subscene does NOT have easy subs for these scenes.

Sorry.

But this one really shows off a critical issue with Torrents in general (no hard subs) but especially the ""More Is Better"" McTorrent ideology..where ""volume"" supplants quality.

And I repeat..its a shame actually because the images are pretty good for the file size..but sans subs? They are almost Unwatchable."

,Alrik88,2013-04-26T06:22Z,or you could just stop being a whiny little bitch and leave the subs on all the time like everyone else. Amazing the little things you miss without them.
