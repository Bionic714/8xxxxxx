This book illustrates the building process using ICF's (Insulated Concrete Forms) from start to finish. More importantly it reviews the problems encountered using ICF construction and the solutions to eliminate these costly errors. The book goes on to show how the author used these blocks to build his home with very little help except when pouring the concrete.
