,brianxxx,2013-03-21T04:26Z,An idiot? For not believing in fairy tales and relying on facts and science and wanting proof? I guess things like that scare you huh?
,studio11,2013-05-03T17:35Z,"bigbullzi you fucking religitard. You can't even spell Christopher correctly. Following your logic, anyone who questions the status quo is an 'idiot', yet believing in something without proof (in this case, a sky fairy) is a sign of intelligence?

You personify the notion that people who join cults are feeble minded people of low IQ. Now fuck off and let the adults speak, you daft cunt."
