Alan Ball's hit HBO series, the sensually sizzling story of the lives and loves of vampires, mind readers, and all manner of creatures, continues in this ongoing series! Now that the "Shake For Me" storyline has come to a close, we take a closer look at ALCIDE HERVEAUX and what makes this brooding werewolf tick, in this special one-off story!

Thanks goes to Son of Anarchy for this release.
