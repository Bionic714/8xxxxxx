{ Two Montana saddle tramps head to Nashville to open up a detective agency. At first, the agency begins on a lark, but soon they get involved in a case involving a kidnapped singer. }

This is the only copy of the movie that became a series I have. Even though IMDB gave it a rating of 5.1, I did not want any more of what became a short lived TV series. 

This is a DVD rip to MKV .h264-audio with 1 pass in English and even though it is Digitally remastered, it still is not as good as today's quality movies. My own personal rating of this movie is less. 

The only reason I am uploading this movie is some one asked for it. Don't know why and did not ask, but some movies are better left to a persons memory. This is one. So I am only going to seed this for a very short time and 1 time only and only at 100kbs. 
 
Your welcome to continue seeding afterwards for as long as you want, but once I have uploaded to the person who asked for it, I will quit after seeding 5X the size.

Don't let the cast or IMDB fool you. This is not a good movie.

THE DVD DID NOT HAVE ANY SUB-TITLES! NO SUBS!
