Here's the latest version:

,Green.Banana,2013-04-06T15:52Z,"Maybe if you could explain why it ""sucks"", your claim would have more veracity.  "
,whatthefuckpassword,2013-04-11T03:12Z,"Why make a ""scene"" release of 1.09 when 1.10 is already out?

The official torrent consists of 1 DRM free installer, this ""VACE"" torrents contains 6 files, and an unnecessary custom installer.

Suck my veracity."
