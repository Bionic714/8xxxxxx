How Much is Each Persons Share of the Budget and Debt?

The 2012 final budget came to $3795.547 billion which, when divided by the population at the end of 2012 (312,780,968), comes to $12,134.84 per person.

So the share to a family of four is $48,539.36 for running the government.

The debt stands at $16 trillion so each personΓÇÖs share is $53,333 and will grow this year by $4,333 (rounded). Thus a family of four now owes in debt $213,332 and by the end of this year, that figure will grow to $230,664.

So the total, true cost of running the government and the share to a family of four is $279,203.36. I think weΓÇÖre getting screwed.

With the debt slated to continue growing at a rate of $1.3 trillion per year with no end in sight, how soon before we go the way of the USSR?
