Infovox 2.2 International Language Pack - Acapela


This is my favorite Language learning Software. By highlighting any text on your computer, it can read clearly in the language of your choice, teaching you the pronounciation. It also is useful for the blind and disabled.


PERSONAL NOTE

This is for informational purposes only. This Language Pack V2 Appears to no longer be in production but is too high notch not to perserve. 

Those who do not want to be forced into the version 3 upgrade, no longer can access these language files online from Acapela. Not everyone likes the new version and some perfer to avoid it the upgrade, staying with Infovox version 2.

This is a pack for those who have lost their former languages due to a system crash. If you have previously lost your language packs and do not want to switch from Infovox 2 to Infovox 3, you would appreciate this program.

DESCRIPTION

Infovox Desktop 2.2: A Straight Talking Interface from Acapela

Infovox Desktop is a high-end text-to-speech product designed to allow visually impaired people as well as those who are illiterate, dyslexic or who suffer from age related health concerns, to vocally access written information or other accessibility applications using a screen reader. 

In an increasingly technical world, users with disabilities are often faced with a number of challenges. Rapid innovations in technology can lead to isolation and frustration. Conversely, advances in the digital age can hugely facilitate daily living where interfaces designed specifically for accessibility are concerned. Infovox Desktop is one such interface. 

Infovox Desktop speech synthesis can read aloud any written information with very natural and pleasant sounding voices. Users can simply listen to a written text, access their PC with a screen reader, surf the web or control the typing of a text using simultaneous oral spelling.

Infovox version 2.2 ΓÇô what is new?

This latest version of the Infovox Desktop is now fully compatible with both Windows XP and Windows Vista. AcapelaΓÇÖs product complies with the main requirements of these operating systems to make the integration of the Infovox DesktopΓÇÖs accessibility applications both easy and effortless.

Already available in 20 languages and 45 different voices, Infovox Desktop 2.2 adds 4 new high quality voices to its portfolio: Peter (UK English), Rosa (North American Spanish), Louise (French Canadian) and Alice (French). Two voices especially adapted for children have also been developed: Nelly (US English) and Kenny, voices that allow young users to choose a vocal persona that is better suited to fit their own identity.

With this latest version, Acapela clients will be able to purchase more voices for the same price, as licensing is now per language and no longer per voice. By purchasing just one license, clients will be able to use all of the voices available for a language. The American voice Heather is also provided free of charge with any language license.

Multilingual voice packages have also been created to meet the demands of Swiss (German, French, Italian and US English Heather) and Belgian users (French, Belgian Dutch and English Heather).

Additional features also include brail text on the software DVD, demonstrating once more AcapelaΓÇÖs desire to facilitate the end userΓÇÖs experience as much as possible. Using the productΓÇÖs Lexicon feature, customers can personalise the pronunciation of any word, group of words or even complete sentences to meet their own requirements for optimum comfort and ease of understanding.

With AcapelaΓÇÖs speech solutions, any written information can be read aloud, creating a full dialogue interface and freeing users from screen dependence. Assistive technology such as Infovox Desktop is opening doors for its users to an increasing number of living and working opportunities. Acapela has a long history of focusing on accessibility issues and remains deeply involved in improving the daily life of thousands of users.


DISCLAIMER

By default they all have 30 day trials. I do not recommend anyone using the common online crack for infovox 2 before adding these languages to gain unlimited access to all of these languages. I do not encourage that. Even though this would be quite easy to do with these files, this is for information purposes only and is meant to be downloaded only by those who previously had these languages on their computer previously, lost them due to a crash and are trying to restore their program to the way it was before. 

Yes, I understand how easy it is for you to crack this, but I need you to agree to only download this for informational purposes and nothing more. Only download this if you already have the program.


REQUEST

This is my first torrent. Please seed! Pretty Please! I need a lot of seeders to get this off the ground. Many torrent programs have a schedule under tools, where you can set up your computer to seed and download automatically each night while your sleeping.
