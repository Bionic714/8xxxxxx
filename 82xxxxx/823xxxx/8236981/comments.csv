,ferothul,2013-03-09T22:19Z,"Here is what I have gathered is going on:

-SkidRow is indeed working on a crack for the game.
-The amount of data transferred between the server and the client is apparently greatly exaggerated by EA, in regards to the always online feature.
-As such, it will be possible to crack. 
-There is currently no crack as of March 9th.
-This torrent is taken from the unofficial SkidRow website, which a site that is generally trusted.
-This torrent has no crack and will function when the crack is released. 
-As far as I know, there is no virus in this torrent. 
-The other uploaded torrent is practically the same thing."

,ferothul,2013-03-10T01:00Z,"This is not like Diablo 3, it is an entirely different situation. 

Diablo 3 required you to emulate servers in order to play it, however it is looking like SimCity does not, since SkidRow are cracking it. 

And yes, those who are sucking the game's cock and saying it's worth $60 are, in my opinion, quite likely EA shills. When you go look on Amazon reviews, where you are required to first purchase the game in order to review it, you will see that the game is receiving unanimously bad reviews. On places where no such requirement exists? You'll find people with poor grammar commenting on it. It's been proven that EA hires Chinese people to viral their game. It's not much of a stretch to imagine they'd hire some Chinese folk to come on here and say it'll never be cracked and that it's worth $60. 

And as for the crack that people are asking if it is legitimate, it is not. It will be uploaded on the Pirate Bay within an hour of it being made available. Do not download it from anywhere else, and be sure to check if the uploader on TPB is trusted. If he is not trusted, check the comments, or wait and see if it gets removed/gets a bunch of seeders/leechers on it. 

As others have said, a good rule of thumb is that if a site makes you take surveys, the service the site is providing is not a legitimate one."

Every game that does not have any sort of always-on DRM or any DRM requiring internet connection has never had any server issues at all. There are people who pirate out of principle, because people who have payed for the game are getting their asses spread wide open by corporate cock.

,Mercer99,2013-03-10T02:10Z,"EA is full of shit. This game can and will be cracked. Their claim that the engine is processing on their servers is incredibly retarded. A game tends to use the CPU for engine calculations and such. The requirements for this game in terms of CPU are a simple dual-core, not too high. But consider the fact that servers often don't have an incredibly good CPU installed, coupled with the sheer amount of players at any one time to run parts of the engine on? They'd spend more money getting servers that can handle this kind of crap than they'd make out of the game's sales. Don't fall for their shit and don't buy the game. The crack will come, it is inevitable."

,mr2smokinu,2013-03-10T05:34Z,"The game came out on March 5, 2013. I understand everyone wants to be able to download and play this game.

Lets try and have some respect for those who make this possible. SkidRow, Reloaded, ect... they all take their knowledge of these games and programs and make them playable without having to purchase it.
If they really wanted to, they could take that knowledge and use it only for themselves. Make games work they want and say, ""great"". I think it says a lot they are willing to take the countless hours cracking a game and then share it with everyone. They don't even ask anything but ""thanks"" in return.
I know one thing, I can't get my car, computer, or anything around my house fixed and working for nothing except saying ""thanks"" to the repair man. I gotta shell out some money that I worked for.
Just be patient and wait for the crack to come out. It takes time, effort, and an act of good will to make it available.
If you want a game right when it comes out... then I would say, buy the game. But if you want something for nothing... you're going to have to wait. Just like those new fancy devices that come out... You can either shell out big bucks to have the latest and greatest, or wait a year or two for them to be out for a while and come down in price or buy a used or refurbished one at a discount.
Don't forget, expansion packs come out... and you can always add those to your purchased copy."

Btw for everyone saying this can't be cracked (paid EA shills) you are wrong. The statement by EA that most of the game's calculations are done on their servers is bullshit. People have been able to play the game for 20-30 minutes even if their Internet is out before being booted by the game. Plus while the simulation is complex it's not anything that a modern gaming rig can't handle. Only regional play and shit like achievements utilizes the servers. But I play SimCity by myself and the cracked version probably wouldn't have been able to connect to multiplayer servers like most other games so I see a singleplayer crack as inevitable.

,kazin223,2013-03-10T13:04Z,"Just be patient, the crack is coming. Simcity isn't the first big name game to try to DRM the living shit out of itself, only to STILL be cracked because the more bullshit publishers like EA pull, the harder the crackers work just to stick it to the greedy fucks.

@EA-Agent It's been years since I paid for a game that had the EA, Activision, etc logo. They're greedy assholes, prioritize making a buck and mainstreaming everything so the only innovative games we can find are low-budget Steam games.

The same people that release ""Same Day DLC"". Really? We're already shelling 60$ dollars out to buy a game that doesn't even have all of its content unlocked until after we shell out another 5-15$?

I'll happily(HAPPILY) skim over games like Diablo 3(Which was ass. Want a real Diablo sequel? Play Path of Exile, which is F2P, BTW) and even Simcity if I have to(Which I likely won't), if it means your damn company burns to the ground and all your developers and publishers get blacklisted from any other companies because they don't want that bad karma infecting their products.

I can't wait till passwords are generated by a person's DNA, it'll be claimed to be uncrackable.... which is funny, because the moment they invent a way to copy memories bad guys will know the password easily.

Firstly, interesting to know that you have the intelligence of a 15 year old, because only a 15 year old is pussy enough to let companies rip them off by charging games for more than their worth, and then they also give you shitty customer service as well they will try to sell you parts of the game in DLC like bottled water. The greedy ones are the corrupt bastards named EA. Heck not every pirate is a thief at all, since they may have bought the game but a cracked version is infinitely superior to the shit EA did.

Furthermore, facts are facts, studies have been done and the vast majority of the people pirating do not have the money. You say ""save money then""? Problem is, when you are poor like the majority saving money for video games is the most retarded thing you could do. Especially if you have family, because then your video game habits hurt them.

Then, to destroy the last shred of your post... if someone doesn't have a job, what exactly would be so horrible about that? I'm sorry not everyone gives a fuck what people like you will say about their lives, at least they don't suck up to some boss' nutsack day in and day out just to earn money so you can go in a circle your entire life. Nor do they let people push them around, cause their not bitch asses. Also, at least they have more time to do what is truly important, to enjoy life. What is the meaning of life? To live it, not suck up to some boss' nutsack in a circle jerk of unhappiness lol

@cptdan79: Because then when the crack is made, we will already have the game and we will just need to download the crack separately which will take a quick second.

,ravupadh,2013-03-10T19:28Z,"I don't think this game's DRM is anywhere near as sophisticated as Diablo 3's because people have been able to play the game for 30 minutes after being disconnected from the Internet before being booted. And contrary to what they'll tell you, most if not all of the city's simulation is done on your machine. The only thing the servers are needed for is things like achievements or multiplayer but cracked games can't usually play multiplayer anyway so it doesn't matter. So this game will eventually be cracked. The one problem I see is with the saves because all of the saves (even singleplayer) are stored on EA's server. If that means we can't save, then oh well. The game is shit anyway. I played the beta and it is vastly inferior to the previous SimCities. No terraforming, no subways, small cities, non-contiguous cities, no modding, no ploppable highways, among a host of other things. Plus besides the server connectivity issues the game has some major bugs like Sims walking in circles forever or pathfinding bugs where Sims will take the shortest and most congested route instead of the fastest. Really an unfinished and broken game that Maxis didn't have time to do some QA on because of EA breathing down their neck I'm guessing."
,IronicParticle,2013-03-10T19:34Z,"@ravupadh; plenty of people have played the Beta, and many have said updates fixed loads of issues by now... and I doubt they'll stop fixing bugs anytime soon. Games are always buggy early on, most games have day 1 bugs that NEVER get fixed by official means. However, I doubt that will happen here with this game. As for the gameplay issues? EA is probably going to add all that stuff through DLC, low and behold it'll all be cracked too."

,ravupadh,2013-03-10T20:02Z,"@IronicParticle It's not just the beta that was broken though. I've read that the full game has massive bugs that will give you major headaches. Like for example if you set up a nuclear power plant the first sims that will work there are ones without a college degree and they'll cause a nuclear meltdown. Or sometimes things like water or Sims won't travel to other cities when they're supposed to. And there's also the possibility of losing your entire region if EA's server has a problem. Granted any game is going to have bugs on day 1. But these game breaking bugs should have been fixed during the beta. As for the DLC, I would not expect them to go the way of the Sims 3 and pump out loads of overpriced DLC with content that was already in the previous games. In that case, even if I do eventually end up buying the game I will not support that practice and will pirate the DLC."

Back for round 2 eh?

WRONG, the increased prices are on ALL GAMES DAY 1! Tell me again how people pirate something before it exists, without a leak? The increased prices are just because piracy exists, not because the game itself will be pirated. Not every game has been pirated, but yet every game has such prices. Then, there is loads of evidence it is big businesses themselves that have spread piracy, by promoting torrents in the past before it was such a big thing.

Now, you are proving you are just an indbred redneck moron by not only bringing up Romney, but showing your support! Herpity derp, totally legit opinion bro -_-

Nevermind, a game is digital... meaning it's endless, they can make infinite copies. They get BILLIONS of dollars for the work of 1 copy... then they just copy it effortlessly. So for all intents and purposes, they deserve 60-80$ dollars... and maybe 1 dollar per copy of the original... not billions. That's WAY BEYOND gross overpayment. Even more so now, because it's all digital, they want to make it so physical copies no longer exist so they make even more money by not using physical resources.

DRM NEVER WORKS. What is worse, is the big businesses KNOW it too. Proven because they acknowledged it with steam, they should be aware ANYTHING can be cracked. So, it's them who is fucking up their customer's enjoyment.

Piracy does more good than it does bad, it gives those greedy bastards infinitely more money than they deserve... It gives people in countries with no access or ability to play, the access and ability to play. It spreads art, etc, etc.

Facts are facts, the 1% are corrupt, evil greedy bastards. The evidence says they are manipulating everything to get more, from us, where the hell else would you think it comes from? Their asses? That's not how economics, nor basic math works.

you paid for this game, sucking the balls of your nigger overlords. Which FYI, I am using the original definition. Nigger USED to mean, ignorant person... the white man, wrongly considered blacks to be ignorant. This is the original definition, unfortunately for the 1%... their the niggers."
,nignug,2013-03-10T23:09Z,"@Bahb420 haha nice try bitch. first off, im not black, go ahead and keep calling me nigger, you might as well call me a spic or a chink too, I could care less. 

Now to retort. What you don't seem to realize is that we have absolutely no problem with the actual people behind this game. It is the giant corporation that we dislike. EA has been pulling shit like this for years, and making millions. EA seems to release more DLCs than actual games. Did you know that EA and DICE actually said at one point that they would never charge for DLC, ever? Well, that didn't last too long, did it? 

My problem doesn't lie with the hardworking, educated programmers and developers, it lies with the money hungry bastards who run the company. EA literally takes amazing companies and eats them alive, only to shit them out later. They became big because they were smart about their investments. EA at one point(long long ago) was liked by a lot of avid gamers. Once their customer support when down the drain, people got sick of them. Now they release a highly anticipated game with online only DRM that requires you to connect to a server.

That actually brings up another point about these assholes. They have so much money, yet they turn off game servers after about a year or two. This usually happens with their sports games. If you try to play an EA sports title online that was released in 2011 or earlier, you won't be able to. This is because they don't feel like paying the $100 to keep them running for a year.

I think EA really just need to get their heads out of their asses. They can either do that or lose more customers, which I know for a fact is happening at a fast rate right now. Countless people have already demanded their money back for this game.

So, Bahb420, go ahead and suck EA's dick all you want. The only thing you will receive is more shitty DLC and overpriced games. "
,IronicParticle,2013-03-10T23:16Z,"Bahb420

Just like, I'd tell people to buy something if they have the money. If not, it hurts NOTHING to pirate, and there is no such thing as a victimless crime.... well technically there is, but honestly such laws are unjust obviously.

Your logic makes no sense... making DRM stronger, is like spreading oil over your asshole for people to take it... Because DRM, does nothing other than bring a challenge to hackers that they will inevitably overcome.

DRM makes pirates more likely to pirate something. Much like making marijuana illegal, just makes more criminals instead of actually solving the problem. Now loads of people who would normally buy it, will pirate it because it's got too many problems. Usually DRM fucks up customer's experiences and the only ones sucking up to EA's balls are the VERY FEW people to have no issues.

If they didn't have DRM, they'd actually have better results. More people would buy it because it'll actually work, and of the people who will pirate it without needing to crack it? They harm nothing and will buy it when they do have the money. So, stop blaming it on pirates, the facts are against you.

You see, the majority of humans are more moral than you may think. Statistics say ONLY people who can't afford it, pirate it. Statistics also say it harms nothing except a few very rare cases, but that has nothing to do with Piracy as a whole. Of course the companies aren't victims, their the true criminals, the true immoral ones. They just care about more money. Art used to be free, because artists used to only care about their art."
,IronicParticle,2013-03-10T23:23Z,"Also, to expand on something... I meant, statistics normally say ONLY people who can't afford it pirate it. But increasingly there is reasons for actual customers to pirate too :l"
,ravupadh,2013-03-10T23:25Z,"@Bahb420 Always online DRM doesn't stop piracy. It actually enhances it: http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20090528/1123165044.shtml

Only good games with a supportive user interface like Steam (which has sales and an offline) will stop piracy. But again most pirates wouldn't have purchased the game anyway even if they didn't pirate it. And many pirates are actually the biggest video game consumers because they want to try the game out before the buy it."

What nignug meant was that no matter what, its the hard working developers that suffer. Even if BILLIONS buy their game, not a percentage of the money will reach the developers. I worked on several myself in Ubisoft Singapore, and have some friends in DICE, Visceral and Crystal Dynamics. 

The pay for us developers is constant. We get paid about the same amount for every game we work, no matter how successful or horrible the game turns out. If anyone says that piracy hurts us developers, then they're mostly wrong. The only set of developers you might be hurting by pirating games are the indie devs, but they, most of the time, have other jobs as well for cash and make games just for the fun of it.

As a developer, I promote piracy. It gives everyone an opportunity to experience our work, without the stupid price tags that our publishers force on them. If you like it, then by all means, go ahead and buy to it show your support. 

Remember though that every dollar from the sales go to the publisher and not the developers. By the time the game comes out, we'll already be working on another project.

,Neowarex,2013-03-11T14:57Z,"Simcity series were good especially Simcity 4. However, although the online features are honestly great, there are big issues with the new Simcity that I simply will not support such as:

Crazy stupid DRM which is/will definitely bite everyone in the ass because:

- The servers will not be maintained indefinitely so one day the game will simply not work unless they release an offline mode in the future
- Those who have to move often and don't always have Internet access will not be able to play the game which is just plain stupid.
- This means you paid for a game which won't work in 10 or 15 years unlike Caesar III and many other games that I can play 15+ years after it was released.

In addition there are many things that are BIG fails in my eyes in the new Simcity:

- Small cities, 2km by 2km, nowhere near the complex development that you can get with Simcity 4
- Some features are only available in multiplayer such as an International Airport.
- Inability to terraform regions to respond to your needs and desires.

This means that they made a game which could be great but with the limitations due to their server limits and design decisions do not work to their full potential.

I was seriously going to buy this game to play with 2 of my friends, however we have mutually agreed that due to those issues we will not be buying it until EA fixes all those issues, which probably will be never. I like gaming on my laptop but I also travel quite a bit which means I don't have access to a wifi connection 25% of the time which is quite a bit in my opinion.

I am very glad that we didn't buy the game since when hopefully a crack comes out, we won't be limited by servers."
,Dimmis80,2013-03-11T16:20Z,@Neowarex mate thanks for the info and stuff.U have a point there and i angree with u.I was planing to buy it in April if a crack wont come out untill then but with so much problems and the stuff u told us about i think the game wont worth the 50 euros they ask about..!!Btw i am hoping for a crack but if the game is like Diablo 3 it will never crack or it will take months or even year.!!!!I don't wont to be pacimistic but with diablo 3 blizard won the war with the scene releasers and stuff and the game is out 8-9 months less or more and still no crack or working proper servers.!!!But i want to ask u @Noewarex about simcity just to be sure and to know what to wait about that if simcity is the same thing like D3 difficult to crack or even never..!?I hope it wont be the fuckin case.!??

,nlips,2013-03-11T18:19Z,"All cracks which require you to fill out a survey are scams and viruses. No exceptions. Anybody who says otherwise is promoting it for a nefarious reason.

The surveys first ask for your email address and require you to check a box that says you agree to get spam. THEN you get to another page where you're required to put in your phone number and address and make a phone call to verify your survey.

I'm curious to see how much spam my dummy email address gets from this. I wasn't stupid enough to do the phone number part.

And I seriously doubt you'd end up with a functional crack after all that. If Skidrow hasn't cracked it yet, you can bet your ass the survey-scammers haven't either. "

,Amythiel,2013-03-11T20:19Z,"The only way to make this game pirate-able would be for a crack team to create a server emulator. That is not an easy job as they don't have access to the server emulator itself to reverse engineer it.

The servers aren't just there to check if you've got a legal copy of the game. Stuff gets precessed on the servers that is not processed on the client, much like D3.

If the emulator is made it will suck horse dick for a long time, much like D3's server emulators suck it to this day. It will never work like the real thing."

,IronicParticle,2013-03-11T21:34Z,"Amythiel,

Where the hell are you getting your info? Everything I've heard so far is that a lot of the processing happens on your computer, not with the servers. it's nothing like D3.

Now, the one thing that will probably require a server is saving... but even then, maybe not because we don't know how saving works with this game and it's engine. There may very well be a way to crack that too.

But to compare it to D3 is a load of horse shit."

It's Maxis who deserve my money, they worked to make this game, why do EA get the larger share? Unfortunately that means that Maxis won't be getting my money for the game because of EA, when a crack is released, which it will be, I will be downloading it. I've enjoyed the past SimCity games and I want to give this one a go regardless of the countless bad reviews, but I'm not willing to lose out on a purchase. I simply cannot afford to do that.

So before anyone goes righteous on my arse, I'd like them to think over what I said and tell me it doesn't make sense. If I enjoy the game as much as I enjoy SimCity 4 I'll pay for it, if I don't see myself playing it again after a couple of days it's probably better removed from my computer."

No one cares even if you are a fucking millionaire. You're the only tard in these comments who bought the game and seems to enjoy it. Congratulation you are part of the 1%. The 1% of morons who don't understand how to save their money. Instead they give all of their hard earned money to dipshits who are rolling around in your cash.

on the other hand, skidrow's site does not require a survey to download, just because it says skidrow, doesn't mean that it really is.
find the freaking site, put some effort into it, don't just go to the first result you find.
and this game will eventually be cracked, ea's way (offline patch) or the emulated server way.

,dreadpiratebay,2013-03-15T06:03Z,"@Bahb420
I am sure that the people who made the game have been paid for their years of work.  I am sure that profit from sales is now going directly into EA's coffers.  

And, I am also sure that the profit from this game will go to a bunch of absurdly overpaid executives, who will hold pointless meetings to decide how they can use DRM to break the next SimCity game.

The point is, we do not support DRM which ruins the game for paying customers.  By giving EA money, we are supporting their dubious business decisions of shitting all over their customers.

If the game doesn't sell very well, do you really think the franchise will be over?  EA can see the flak they are receiving for their obvious lies and DRM.  If it doesn't sell well, they will probably patch the game to make it playable offline.  

That is all we want.

We don't want to see SimCity stop working in two years time because EA switched off their servers.  We don't want the game to be inaccessible to those who don't have a solid internet connection.  And we don't want dubious Origin software scanning our personal data from our computers.

I can only speak for myself.  I do not presume to speak for TPB.  But, I don't want to steal SimCity.  I just want to see EA do the right thing.  That is all.  


Now, I know I am feeding a troll who has nothing better to do, but I am in the mood for an argument right now ;).  SO Bahb420, if you want to speak shit, insult people, make backwards racist remarks and act like an idiot, then go ahead.  Your ignorance amuses me.

And yes Bahb420, do I have to repeat that I have ""tried to talk sensibly with an irrational person"".  I am right now and it's pointless!

Ha ha, have fun with your awesome investment.  May your servers be friendly :).  ha ha ha"
,nlips,2013-03-15T07:23Z,"Best thing about pirating is that, if you genuinely are a person who can't afford the game, then it's actually totally a victimless crime. EA doesn't notice one fewer copy of Simcity in its warehouse. No game store can find any missing copies. Every single item produced is still present and accounted for. Every single penny of profit they were going to make, they STILL make.

If on the other hand, you are capable of buying the game, but decide not to because ""hey I can get it for free, why should I pay for it"" then the anti-piracy arguments carry some weight. That is a genuine missing sale. If you were unable to pirate, you would have spent the money.

I've spent years when $60 would literally have broken the bank. If I spent it, rent would not get paid. Or, more likely, I wouldn't have had the $60 in the first place. The charge would have been rejected. I pirated the SHIT out of games during that time.

But now... things have picked up. I'm slightly more honest. I'm much more of a ""try before you buy"" kind of guy now. And I LOVE giving money to the little indie companies -- they come up with some good shit.

If Simcity is as good as they say... I will buy it. But not without being able to give it a test drive first. "
,ravupadh,2013-03-15T07:24Z,"@Bahb420 You do realize that the developers (Maxis) won't see a penny of the profits, don't you? When a publisher sells a game, it reeks in all of the money from the sales. The devs have been paid already and most of them have moved on to another project. I am not going to give EA my money especially since this game isn't even worth $60. Forget about the server issues and always being online. The game is broken and glassbox is a poorly designed engine. I knew something was wrong ever since I played the beta. Sims go to a different house and job each day. Pathfinding is horrible since Sims will take the shortest and most congested route instead of the fastest. Service vehicles love to travel in herds causing massive traffic jams in which they get stuck and before you know it half of your city is on fire. Besides, they took out way too much stuff from SC4. Small maps, no terraforming, no mods, non-contiguous cities, no subways, and non-controllable highways? No thank you. This game is only worth ~$25 to me at this point. Besides, I don't feel like giving EA my money so they can go and rape another franchise and put more always online DRM in their games."
,skullzero,2013-03-15T07:57Z,"Everyone, just download Cities XL, it's much better and there aren't a million bugs with offline and online gameplay.

It does look tempting.  It has some OK reviews, is not made by EA, and is only $30.  I just wish they had a try before you buy option."
,tikonash13,2013-03-15T09:11Z,"THIS GAME IS incomplete, do not have the comfort you could by a city like simcity4.
EA has an example .... the sims, you buy the game and one  month later, leaves a expansion game, spent $ 60 today and spent one month later another 40 to play the game just a litle more completed, and so until they reach the 15 expansions.

so keep buying .... and be happy, and in my view sim city will be the same thing, because you'll find that the game needed something else for the players continue to play, and there hahahahahahahaha!!!! a new expansion!!!! obvious you want play,

do you like that? start a new city over and over again? just becouse is a'' new'' higway''? In so they want to waste your money in their schemes ...

the game online, to play, you have to buy it, and the expansions surely come ... and you buy again...

So after multiple updates, different operating systems and 3 different pc's, the game is still crashing and EA can't seem to fix it.  Sorry to say it, but I don't see them making SimCity 5 bug free and I'm not willing to spend more money on their games after they ROBED me like that. FUCK EA GAMES!!!

I've gotta disagree with you there.  EA received a massive backlash (from paying customers) for SimCity's release.  They even admitted that they were wrong.  If you read some of the comments out there, and see some of the petitions going around, you will find that it is not all about piracy.  

I (and many others) don't care about whether it is free.  I just do not want to support EA.  I will not reward a company for screwing its customers.  They think that they can do whatever the fuck they want, and customers will just keep crawling back; paying to get fucked over.

All I want is SimCity to be fixed.  I want to use it offline.  I don't always have internet.  I don't want the game to stop working in two years when they switch off the servers.  And I want them to actually deliver on their pre-release promises (i.e. actual multi-agent system, rather than the random guesswork they have used here).

So, either they fix all of that, or they wont see a cent for me.  And if it doesn't get cracked here, then I guess I will miss out.  But I will not support EA when they fuck their customers."

Gaming companies (normally the bigger ones) will do things to show they care.. Which covers their ass later on to not lose all costumers. EA will not stop DRM ever.. Its a antihack method and it works.. People who pay for the game to want it will get it, people who pirate will get frustrated and either wait out for a crack that might not happen, or buy the game... After some time, they decide the servers will be dropped (Which will never happen if you look at the fact that D2 servers and StarCraft are still kicking strong even after D3/StarCraft 2 was released), They will make the game playable without the servers just to keep the costumers happy..

The court systems are just now starting to remove torrents (But not really remove as to block for some providers). It is not illegal to run a torrent site one bit. Pirate Bay for example does not share copyright files, they only share a way to get them.. In all honesty, the people connecting to the torrents and passing bit of copyrighted files around are the ones committing the illegal issues.. Do not be surprised that in the  future that more then just a handful of people will get hit with a federal lawsuit.

,AweDRay,2013-03-18T00:13Z,"Well, some modders have found a bit of code that forces the game to shut off after 20 minutes of disconnection. Definitely, if this code was commented on and modified, then our crack is not too far away.

,SimTask,2013-03-18T00:26Z,"Just because they have a offline mod now, does not mean the crack will be easy... The crack will need to emulate your pc as a server or someone needs to make a private server for it.. They wont be able to stop the fact the game needs to be connected to something"
,jonjonjonj,2013-03-18T02:45Z,why does it need to be connected to a server? a maxis engineer said there are no calculations done on the server and people already proved that it can run offline. the whole point of the crack will be preventing it from connecting to a server so you can play offline. for single player there is no need for a server emulator. i don't think anyone is expecting a cracked version with multiplayer. at least i'm not all i want is single player. if you want multiplayer you should go buy the game because i doubt that's happening. one problem is the game saves/loads on the server so they need to find a way to make it save/load locally.
,onder55,2013-03-18T09:54Z,"Guys don't you think that if cracking this game would be easy, it would be already done? The game needs 10+ Gb hdd space and here you download 3.8, isn't obvious that something is missing? If there will be emulated servers like with Diablo 3, we will have to wait pretty long time and then download enormous amount of data just to play it. With reviews of SimCity from critics I decided to screw this game and play something another instead like Civilization... And recommend you to do the same. This is waste of time and money."

All DRM aside, the game is built to utilize a ""cloud based"" game engine located on a server to do 90% of the work.

The only way to ""crack"" this game is one of two ways, both are virtually impossible:

1. Somehow create a fake username/password that will validate on EA servers.

2. Somehow steal the source code of the game engine residing on the server.

There is no chunk of the game that is inaccessible locally on your computer, so there is no way to actually ""crack"" the game."

Also, FBI was popping people left and right for the private hacked servers.... That was for D3.. Wonder how many people will put that much effort into SimCity.. A broken game.. I do believe this will all happen and there will be private servers for this game... But not until the game is patched out to where its not broken.. Before that, people are not going to put in the effort or risk to do so"
,sirpip2,2013-03-27T23:12Z,"@hybridmoments82 That's actually not true.  This game most definitely can be cracked and will be soon enough.

This sort of DRM is nothing new.  Adobe has been using something similar for years.  You get around it by configuring your local DNS to resolve the EA server domains to localhost, then creating an emulation server that runs on localhost.  SimCity wouldn't be able to tell the difference.

Only catch is:  Somebody has to write it.  And that takes time.  I would urge patience.  Also, don't let scammers like Skidrow con you into downloading fakes and installing malware.

NEVER forget this rule of thumb:  If a download requires you to complete a ""survey"", it is fake and you should walk away immediately.  Also keep in mind that it's not uncommon for these scammers to post multiple fake comments in order to make people think they'll actually get what they're looking for if they fall for the spam surveys.

Don't be fooled.  Wait a few days/weeks and the crack will come.  Just make sure it's NOT a Skidrow release as they're no longer safe."
,sirpip2,2013-03-27T23:16Z,"@Bluster No, he's right.  The Skidrow release IS a fake.  I've confirmed this myself.  I'm sure there will be a legitimate crack soon enough, but we'll have to be patient.  As Sim said, right now the game is so buggy that it's really not worth cracking, anyway.  

Once those idiots at EA get their shit together, I'm sure we'll see a crack emerge.  It just won't come from Skidrow."

I'm sorry, but the evidence against them is pretty staggering.  I was as shocked as you are, but all indications are that this is coming from Skidrow themselves."
,sirpip2,2013-03-29T03:29Z,"@Mingwhatever (et al):  Yes, I'm aware that ""[nocrack]"" is in the title.  I can read.  That's not what I'm posting about.

Skidrow claims on their website that they've cracked this and that, to download it, you have to fill out a series of surveys because they deserve to be paid for their work.  Furthermore, the torrents they have posted (both the ones claiming to be cracked and the ones not making that claim) are password-encrypted with instructions to go to those same survey sites to get the password.

If you don't believe me, look it up for yourself.  It's all right there.  Look at all the one-off user accounts that have been spamming these comments with links to those spam survey sites.  Look at all the one-off user accounts posting fake success stories about the non-existant crack.

I'm focusing on this torrent, despite the ""[nocrack]"" in the title, because it is by and large the most active (1188 seeders at present).

Unless this is some elaborate hoax designed to frame Skidrow (and even if it was, how come they haven't refuted it yet?), the evidence is pretty hard to ignore.

So, I'll say it again:  Save yourself the headache and don't download this or any other SimCity torrent from Skidrow!  I have yet to be able to find a single one that's legit.

And whatever you do, do NOT go to these survey sites!  There's no crack waiting for you at the end and they won't give you the decryption password, either.  What they will do, however, is probably make you the victim of identity theft if you're foolish enough to enter your real personal info on those surveys.

Sorry guys but this kinda stuff really pisses me off.  Assholes like this undermine everything we're trying to do here to promote data freedom.  If my annoying comments can spare even one person from these predators, it was all worth it.

Those of you who are offended:  I welcome your anger.  It fuels me like gas for a car and the tears of dying puppies for Dick Cheney.  =)"
,sirpip2,2013-03-29T03:34Z,"Oh and for those of you having trouble with the comments bug, you don't have to post a comment to get around it.  Just click to a previous page until you see them.  For example, I was able to load the latest comments just now by clicking to page 32 (from 35, which was empty; as was 33 and 34).

I think the bug has something to do with how the comments pages are calculated.  The algorithm is evidently expecting fewer comments per page than there actually are, resulting in a number of ""extra"" pages at the end containing no comments.

You are moron. Skidrow DOESN'T have any official page, site, forum etc. It's cracking group, they don't crack for money, but for fame. Cracking scene is as old, as protected games, and not even once, anyone from cracking scene asked for money, or, like in this case, filling surveys.

I respect that you're not acting hostile as most would. So thank you for not making this an all out rage fest. The others will rage, no matter what.

However, I must ask you of which website you refer to. There are many websites that claim to be skidrow's official website. However, it is IMPOSSIBLE to google Skidrow's REAL website. In order to gain access to the real official site, you have to be a part of the scene or be a trusted friend of the scene. You will then be allowed on the proxy servers and be able to visit the site.

I know this because I personally know someone from one of these scenes (not Skidrow, won't name for anonymity sakes)."

,eragonnnnn14,2013-04-22T18:11Z,"@Aliasgon
And what's about that patch? It actually changes nothing in the way simcity work (still online saves and exit game after disconection)."
,DTH_KZR,2013-04-22T22:12Z,"@eragonnnnn14

It fixes a fuckload of problems and glitches, thus making the game is (finally and somewhat) stable (and making it crack worthy)

Oh well, let's wait

AGAIN"

,AweDRay,2013-04-25T14:45Z,"The 2.0 patch fixes nothing major. Everything that was broken about the game before the update is still broken.

Now that I think of it, why are we waiting for the crack for this game, or even, buying it? It's broken to bits, and isn't worth the full $60 price. I'll get it for $25, at highest."
