2. Yes, the dub is quite awful like most dubs from Korean movies but still some folks prefer it over the original + subs.
3. Enjoy!"
,Getabrain,2013-03-09T22:08Z,"For those who can read, this is THE Korean version with subs and THE ONLY WAY to see such movies:

,Thepieman,2013-03-10T00:05Z,subs are so annoying. Id much rather dubs

People see it clearly in title and description ENG 1080p.
They don't need your help, don't worry, they can search, they know better then you what they want. Get a brain!

@Thepieman
I'd add that the dub in this movie is not so bad and all that DTS 5.1 delivers cool surround sounds. Sometimes one misses what went on relying just on Eng subs, especially those like me who are not native English speaking, and home translated subs are often odd translated lol."
[T],[qusawa],2013-03-10T08:45Z,I get audio out off synk anyone else?

I read your comment here

!. If I'm a lunatic and my encodes are not good why the fuck are you downloading it? you're two-faced cunt.
2.  Before you come with your problem you may say ""thx"" if you got some manners, especially as ""trusted uploader"" you should know that.
3. It seems you never synced audio in your life. 
You should watch scenes with shotgun, door slam etc and not actor's lips since this is dub and bad dubbing, you dumb fuck. Why don't you stick with your beloved anoXmous's re-encodes (tagged as Blu-ray), good luck with your 480p which are so great with AC-3 , 192 Kbps, 6 channels  lol."
