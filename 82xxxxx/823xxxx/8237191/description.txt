SPORT: Six Nations Rugby Union - Scotland v Wales
On: BBC 1 HD
Date: Saturday 9th March 2013 
KO Time: 14:30

Live coverage of the opening round four fixture of the 2013 Six Nations tournament. Scotland and Wales suffered demoralising defeats at the start of their respective campaigns, but both teams then hit back with impressive wins a week later. The visitors - the reigning Grand Slam champions - are slowly adjusting to being led by Rob Howley, while normal head coach Warren Gatland is busy putting his full focus on assembling a British and Irish Lions squad. When the two nations met in Cardiff last year, Wales kept their nerve to carve out a ruthless 27-13 victory, as three tries in a devastating 14-minute spell early in the second half broke the resistance of Scotland, who had impressively gone in level at the break with three points apiece. Commentary by Andrew Cotter and Jonathan Davies.
