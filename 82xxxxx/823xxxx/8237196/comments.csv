big.brother.canada.after.dark.s01e10.march.9.2013.dsr.x264-cbm.mp4

SHAME ON YOU for renaming the file and taking credit for cbm's hard work.

You're making yourself look bad by stealing the credit. 

I will post this comment on every single one you upload until you start giving credit where credit is due.  cbm is fine with you sharing the files, but DO NOT RENAME THEM.

,gnap_gnap,2013-03-10T06:17Z,"Nice use of grammar, spelling and punctuation skills. I will not 'fuck off'.   You'll see a similar comment EVERY TIME until you give the proper credit to the capper.  The capper does ALL the work and deserves ALL the credit.

OK sure, you didn't add 'verovenlo' to the file name.. but deleting the capper details from the filename is still wrong.  

Renaming files is a dickhead thing to do. I'm shocked you do it, as you've been around awhile and aren't a newbie (I forgive newbies). Think about for a minute.. the cappers spend HOURS and HOURS working on making the files.. you spend maybe 5-10 minutes creating and uploading a torrent file.  Who do you think deserves the credit?

I'm sure you're calling me an asshole...and I don't care what you think about me. I'm the type of person who thinks credit should be given where it's due.  If you continue to rename the files, you can expect to see a similar post in every upload.
