"Justice Leagues" was a storyline which ran through six one-shot comics published in 2001 by DC Comics, which introduced a revamped Justice League of America. In the arc, alien invaders, working through a human-seeming agent known as the "Advance Man", used Hector Hammond, a telepathic supervillain, to cause the world to forget the existence of the Justice League of America. When Hammond discovered the Advance Man's true motives, he attempted to reverse the process, but was only able to transmit the partial phrase "Justice League of A--" before being incapacitated by the alien emissary.[1] It was found that the individual members of the Justice League were instinctively creating new crime-fighting organizations beginning with the "Justice League of A" to fill the void. Each issue was supposedly the first of a new series featuring one of the alternate teams, although they were just one-offs.
