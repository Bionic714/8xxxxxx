,danieldarko,2013-03-10T07:30Z,"I downloaded the 64 bit version of the program and installed it before the 32 bit one came out. I decided to go with the 32 bit version instead because it is more compatible with all my plugins so I am now trying to install the 32 bit version and am getting this error message: 

“Ableton Live 9 Suite” is damaged and can’t be opened. You should move it to the Trash.""

I uninstalled all traces of the 64 bit version and am still getting this error message when trying to install the 32 bit version.

Any advice would be appreciated.
"
,jaguar13x,2013-03-10T08:11Z,@danieldarko not shure if this will work but you can try install the 64bit again...then delete just the App...not all the other live stuff...then install the 32 bit...
,Rocc13,2013-03-10T08:15Z,"I'm having the same problem where I get the message """"The Authorization file is invalid on this computer"".  I think the mistake I made was accidentally double clicking .auz file when it downloaded to the desktop.  Is there someway to undo this?  I tried uninstalling and reinstalling but got the same message.  I even uninstalled Ableton 8 but that didn't work either.  Do we need a new patch?  PLEASE help!  And thank you very much for this crack!!!"
,danieldarko,2013-03-10T08:16Z,"I figured out what the problem was with that error message. It was the OS not the application. To resolve the issue:

Open System Preferences, go to the Security & Privacy panel, go to the ""general"" panel, and change the ""Allow applications downloaded from:"" setting to ""Anywhere"".

Then the application will launch.

Works perfect now. All good."

,Rocc13,2013-03-11T02:01Z,@Ching_Liu BINGO! That worked! You're the man!!! Thank you so much!  One last question for you.....how do we go about getting Max for live & the glue compressor installed?

,Rocc13,2013-03-11T13:36Z,"@Ching_Liu nevermind regarding the plugins....I'm an idiot....just had to go into the prefs and enable third party plugs.

I think the glue compressor should already be under the audio effects tab. it's there on mine, but it might be because i already have the original glue compressor, don't know why that would happen though... you should check to see if it's there"

shortly, i installed that 9.02 version from macupdate page and pathing it well and no problems yet. ofcourse you can stay with stable 9.01 version
your choice. cheers :)"
,ivurz,2013-03-21T00:57Z,"yeah i saw that the file it's live 9 beta 9.0.2, i installed and works fine, my impression about 9.0.1 to 9.0.2 is that i guess (maybe i'm lying to my self) 9.0.1 runs more smooth in the workflow but i will use both, I'm really happy because i purchased suit8 two years ago and now i really no have money to pay the update, its about 299 dollars so it's too much for me at this moment, but thanks 7117, by the way, i have like 10 packs (only run on live 9) that i want to share because they have very good sounds, samples, they are official because i downloaded on my account on ableton.com, how can i upload all and share. =D"

,ambient404,2013-03-24T13:36Z,"Hey, I just tried this twice, i had gotten it to install earlier today but it was the 64-bit version and i need the 32 bit version to work with my plugins. When i tried installing the 32 bit version its saying ""Patched Partially"" and that is the best i got. Has anyone else experienced this yet?  I will try one more time."
,ambient404,2013-03-24T14:21Z,"Ahhhhhhhhh! Help, I think my Ableton is possessed, ok i finally got the torrent installed and wanted to get max as well so i download max and now the screen keeps popping up that says the folder has been deleated,  its not letting me exit out of preferances or close ableton or even restart my computer."
,maurechi,2013-03-24T22:27Z,"excuse me, I was able to patch and authorize it, i even shut down my computer and open ableton again and It worked fine. But now, suddenly I opened it and I need to Authorize it again (and of course, I can't)      I already deleted it and installed it a couple of times and authorized it well, but soon or later when I open the app it asks me to authorize AGAIN.    
I've done what you said (doing everything from the desktop, but still doesn't works)"
,xangurial,2013-03-28T00:34Z,"Hi, having same problem as Maurechi. I installed and patched and it was working fine for me for the past couple of weeks. Just this week whenever I open it, it asks me to authorize again. The current fix I've done for it is to delete the program and reinstall, then when I open it i turn off my internet, open the program, then once it's open, I turn my internet back on. HOWEVER, that seems to not be working anymore. I got the demo of jbridge for mac and am going to attempt to use the 64-bit version. Has anyone download Ching_Liu's 64-bit and had the same problem? Also, I looked at my current version and it says 9.0.2, so maybe it's just having issues with 9.0.2. I saw ivurs and 7117 talking and i guess 9.0.2 is in beta and unstable compared to 9.0.1. Will have to also try downloading 9.0.1 and seeing if it doesn't create this problem. Let me know if anyone fixed the issue. Cheers"
,xangurial,2013-03-28T01:35Z,"Alright, I did a little research about the error with Live 9 asking for authorization after a while. I may have found a fix. Looked through the Ableton forums and I guess they are updating 9.0.1 to 9.0.2, and as stated before, 9.0.2 is in beta, therefore it's not corresponding with the patch (obvs.) so someone said to turn off automatic updates in your preferences. 

So basically:
-Unistall live 9
-Reinstall a fresh install
-Run patch and to be on the safe side, turn off your internet in case it updates to 9.0.2 when you first open the program 
-Open program
-Turn off automatic updates in preferences by going to licenses/maintenances and turning off ""get software updates""

Then close and reopen and it should still say 9.0.1. I just did it and it works like a charm.  "
,EmbRi0n,2013-03-31T09:03Z,Thank you!
,nbmatt,2013-04-02T04:02Z,"I thought it went without saying that your default choice when using pirated software (whether it be via a crack or keygen or initially-legit serial or generated auth file like this) you should make sure to set it to not check for updates automatically, and especially not install them automatically. That's pretty much the first setting I change when I'm done installing software I've downloaded.

I'm not sure exactly what residual software Live leaves behind if you use their uninstaller or just drag the app to trash, but if you find yourself unauthorized for some reason and need to *fully* uninstall it, I suggest using something like AppCleaner to remove all files Live has around your computer. I suppose you can exclude the Library and any Live Sets/media from that (or back it up beforehand and restore that backup after removing everything)."
