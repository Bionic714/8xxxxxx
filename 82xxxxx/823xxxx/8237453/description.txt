
Compiled from the web with credit to the author. 50 tips with in depth discussions on how to improve your writing.

Articles taken from a website called "poynter" for journalists and writers. The articles are really old, so they are archived and you cannot find them by normal searching (i.e., "googling").

I really liked the way he presented the information. I think it's indispensable. I wanted to make the articles easier to read for myself and thought I'd share. 

The author thought about making them into a book, but there hasn't been one yet. If there happens to be one, I will take down this torrent and go buy the book... Until then, I'll just keep sharing.

Hope you enjoy! :)
