I take no credit for this.  I just made PDFs for the jpeg scans of this torrent:

The comic "Crime Patrol" was officially renamed "Tales from the Crypt" starting from issue 20. It was previously named Crypt of Terror for 3 issues (17-19). All the Crypt related issues are in here. They are in rar files, WITHOUT a password. But they are all in singular JPG files.
