Thanks TV team for giving us the lower quality of everything else already out there! :) Cheers!"
,bundyone,2013-03-10T00:47Z,"tman2610. Is easy, just dont download it. Or wait for the dvd and purchase it."
,pwnt_soup,2013-03-10T01:41Z,"yeah its easy to bitch at free stuff ain't it? but to be honest other up loaders do put more effort into their posts, with little things like imdb links and screen shots or even some info. so yeah, thanks for the upload. TVTeam wins for sheer amount of uploads but does fall short in info and details, nobody's perfect..."
,tman2610,2013-03-10T01:59Z,"First time I've ever complained about anything on here in years. I upload on other sites and just noting on here, that TVTeam promotes their own site only. Just an observation. I've asked them a few times why they can't put something in their description besides their own torrent site. It would be helpful is all. Its a webrip, korean subs, not cropped, overall vid is 7 for a webrip, and audio by hive/cm8 is clean. Thats all I'd have to say if it was my up or if it was one of the other 16 copies exactly the same that TVTeam took it from. "
,far_kit,2013-03-10T01:59Z,"Yes top and bottom cropped 
sample a bit blurry 
audio is good, 
sample is in sync, but I'll wait for a better copy thanks"
,tman2610,2013-03-10T02:02Z,"and I do appreciate their ups because they are heavily followed so plenty of seeders and leechers to drip from, however they get credit from others work because we all know we have to look at the other ups to see the actual screens etc, then jump back to tvteams up to get a decent speed since they have more following due to sheer number. allows us to get a better dl speed off the other peers, not because of tvteam but because of peers."
,Namorax,2013-03-10T03:07Z,"no one puts up half the torrents tvteam does, for what they are I appreciate their work. when you put worth 1/100th of the work they do you can bitch, til then, stfu"
,mibmib007,2013-03-10T11:32Z,tman2610 go buy it when it comes then instead of being a little bitch about it...retard

exemplary. You have been missed. Live long and prosper my friend.

Quote from NFO: Note..: didnt have much time the last 2 month,
having some private problems, will be bumpy
next month too i guess.

From sample, considering the R6 source: v10 a10
Easily the best out so far."
