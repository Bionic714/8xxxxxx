A repost of a an old category theory torrent, along with a few books I've added to that library. The library is disorganized and a bit crufty. The original curator included an extensive section on abstract algebra (good!), and a section on functional programming languages, such as ML, Erlang and F# (scratching my head, here.) I may repost a cleaned up version of the library.

Best,
