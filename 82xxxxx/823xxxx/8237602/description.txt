    In the early 2000s, a garage rock or post-punk revival achieved the airplay and commercial success that had eluded garage rock bands of the past. This was led by four bands: The Strokes of New York City, The Hives of Fagersta, Sweden, The Vines of Sydney, Australia, and The White Stripes from Detroit, Michigan, christened by the media as the The bands, or "The saviours of rock 'n' roll".

           "Juicebox" is a second track and first single from The Strokes' third album, "First Impressions of Earth", released in the US in October 2005. Julian Casablancas was quoted in Spin Magazine as saying this about the song: "I remember people saying this track's ugly, I think it's got a great personality." Their first single in over a year, "Juicebox" marked the Strokes' second single to reach the Top 10 in the UK and also their highest charting single to date. The song also became their first and only single to chart the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, at #98.  The video for "Juicebox", directed by Michael Palmieri with cinematography by Christopher Doyle, features comedian David Cross as a DJ in a radio station in New York City. The video caused some controversy because it contained an abundance of sexual content, which caused Palmieri to do major edits on the video so that it would be less explicit.
