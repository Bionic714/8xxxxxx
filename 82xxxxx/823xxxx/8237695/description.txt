 Encode:
 Asian Rip was ok, just way too bright, colourless and contrast was wrong.
 Also, had hardcoded chinese subs but they are small, at the bottom and nearly all 1-liner.
 So I decided this one time only to crop the bottom sub-line off to get rid of them for good.
 not much lost in this case so its ok.
 that asian rip had some nasty hardcoded watermarks from the source site within the first minute,
 1 min in the middle and 1 min near the end and they were even highlighted in blue, what a bummer.
 zooming in would lose too much video, having them stay looks awful too, so i decided to cut the
 movie in pieces and play with the black borders at these 3 spots only. so you wont see that
 watermark, you wont lose video either, it will look like the aspect changes.

 Fixed the aspect, brightness, contrast, rgb and the colours, looks great now

 for the audio, nearly sounds like studio, still needed a syncthrough and cleaning up.
 all in all very watchable now and will do me till retail in 2 month.
 enjoy


 Note..:
 didnt have much time the last 2 month, having some private problems,
 will be bumpy next month too i guess
