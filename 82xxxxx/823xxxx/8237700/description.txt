This the first book of short-stories, sketches and vignettes by iconoclast American writer Ambrose Bierce (also known by the pseudonym "Dod Grile" in the 1870's). It is an acerbic satirical book which was completely ahead of its time and that still can shock and amuse all kind of readers today. Give it a try if you are interested in forgotten classics that deserve to be better known.
