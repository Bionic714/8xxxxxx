An oldie but goodie, like an old home movie for those of us living and/or working on the political left in Chicago in the late 1960s. It's actually an important film, for reasons described below.
Best viewed by anthropology, history, political science and sociology buffs. Good for nostalgic viewing:"those were the days when 'The People' got involved." It could be frustrating for folks who weren't involved, since so many of the film's characters are familiar to those who were "there", but are not well-identified by the film's makers. American Revolution 2 was a "medium is the message film" (thanks, Marshall McLellan):much chaos with some cooler heads attempting to prevail and sort things into a coherent consensus of philosophies and plan of action. It was a very radical experiment back then to get a group of Black 

Panthers and a group of Appalachian whites meeting toegther to try to move forward as a cohesive group toward common goals. In Chicago, at least, these 2 very diverse groups of citizens being in the same place was more a recipe for disaster than a plan for anything good. Then-"prevailing wisdom" and American culture had "Afro-Americans" organizing "their own people", and southern whites doing the same thing.
The pity of that "methodology" (segregation) was that all of these individuals wanted and needed the same things; ie, decent housing, food, decent jobs and wages, etc. To try to focus all this energy together toward the same goals was what was so special about this attempt and the filming of it. This film is a textbook viewing for any student of the Chicago scene prior to/during the "Battle of Balbo", as the demonstrations involving 1968 DNC delegates came to be known. American Revolution 2 contains one of my all-time favorite lines from a film, but decency prevents my quoting it here. This is an important contemporary history film. Don't blow it off because it seems "amateur" or dated
