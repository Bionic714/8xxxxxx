,roseandthorne,2013-03-10T11:14Z,"heck i DID buy um the crusaders, and most of the wave 1 of impact! at newstands (well food lion actually) and from what the teasers for wave 2 hinted it would have been better (sighs)"

I was wondering if it's possible to ul The X-Files: Season One series (Space was the only one I've seen so far) and the X-Files: Afterflight GN?"

http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8241616/

i'm going to u/l the wildcats volumes, partially against my better judgement
, but a few different users have asked me for them, so look for that monday or tuesday.

Mothra67, you're welcome. i hope he enjoys them. fly was my favorite.

roseandthorne, i honestly don't think wave 2 would've been better, and partially that's because the ""post-knightfall and post-reign of the supermen"" dc comics went way too grim in 1993 and 1994 ... i also don't think the artists (like on crucible) were as good as the original artists. mike parobeck and tom lyle were awesome, what the hell ever happened to them?

arrowgreen426, you're welcome.

binderguy1, i'll look for them again but IIRC the last time i looked, i had a hard time finding many of the topps x-files comics, including ""season one"". i will look, though."
