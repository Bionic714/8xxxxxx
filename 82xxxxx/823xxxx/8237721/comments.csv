SimCity is one of the bigger games released in 2013. the crack will definitely come along. the guys @ skidrow or any other scene will definitely come up with a solution. if not - they will tell us themselves that it's uncrackable. don't believe that DRM only bullcrap. there are no rules which could not be broken.

The problem that is that your save games aren't stored locally, so even with a crack there is no way to save. You can't even properly save online. Only the latest version is saved, so you can't go back to an earlier one."

,fr3akyninja,2013-03-27T06:36Z,"@killzaw, Simcity is running a DRM which is just one big server, that lets you save online and only online, this game isn't supposed to be cracked, it will take time for the crack to come from someone with a skull, i.e. extremezone, Mr.stifmeister, people with green or purple skulls are the people to download from. Just my point of view."
,sirpip2,2013-03-27T13:09Z,"Everyone, do NOT attempt to download the SKIDROW version!  Contrary to their claims, they have not, in fact, cracked SimCity 5.

They have it hosted on a website that forces you to take spam surveys before it'll let you download.  Once you fill out the surveys, it does give you the .rar file promised, except that it's only 10 KB in size and isn't even a valid archive.  Instead, it's just a text file that contains the numers, ""71717171717171"" repeated over and over again.  In other words, it's a fake.

They also have a torrent version of it, but they've locked it down with a password that they say they'll give you if you complete the surveys.  That's a lie; if you fill out the surveys, you still won't get the password.

Bottom line:  Skidrow has officially destroyed their credibility by betraying our trust.  I'm very disappointed, as I've always considered them to be an excellent source for pirated material.

If you see any Skidrow torrents for this release on here, DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT!  You'll just be wasting your time.  I can't even begin to tell you how angry I am about this.  They've betrayed all of us.  I will never make the mistake of trusting them again, and I suggest you not do so, either.

Skidrow is officially DOA now.  They should no longer be considered a legitimate source for pirated software.  Fortunately, there are plenty of others who haven't abandoned their ethics, so I'm sure we'll see a legit crack soon."
,sirpip2,2013-03-27T13:13Z,"As far as the DRM goes, Adobe uses a similar mechanism.  You can easily get around this by altering your DNS records so that the EA server domains resolve to localhost.  You can then run a server that mimicks the EA server so that SimCity won't know the difference.

Of course, somebody actually has to create that first.  It can be done, though.  Just give it time.

And agian, IGNORE THE SKIDROW VERSION BECAUSE IT IS A FAKE!  As of the time of this comment, there is no crack available for this game yet.  Skidrow claims to have one but my research has shown this to be a lie on their part."
,IMPAQT,2013-03-27T15:42Z,"@sirpip2 - Ummmmm, SkidRow is NOT DoA. Skidrow has no official website for posting games and cracks. Those shit websites u see using skidrows name are all fake posers trying to pretend to be skidrow. When a skidrow release comes out its usually on IIRC or some similar sharing community. Dont be a tool."
,blackmasiao,2013-03-29T10:25Z,"@sirpip2 you are probably downloading from a fake skidrow site, there is no crack and those surveys are noob proof. you know when there is a survey in a crack site, is fake!"

,weltall2,2013-03-30T10:43Z,"The game does not worth 40$. It worths at best 20$. The reason is not that it is buggy or ""small"" compared to SC4. It is because later one DLC will appear and in order to enjoy more features people will have to pay cash. As for the crack, it might eventually appear, but it will be in a long time, when Maxis will decide to close the servers and make SC offline."
