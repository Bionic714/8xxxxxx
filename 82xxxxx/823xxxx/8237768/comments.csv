[T],MrUnpopular,2013-03-10T05:42Z,Cheers mate! Enjoy. :)
,jungcookie,2013-03-10T07:33Z,Thank you:)
,cindy25,2013-03-10T08:08Z,"thanks, please upload Marvin Marvin and See Dad Run on a regular basis.  those r hard 2 find, and the quality of those is really bad even after converting



KESThai: you can set the bit rate when u convert this  to avi, and it will be fine; use freemake and size to 169
"
,KESThai,2013-03-10T10:05Z,"cindy25: why would I convert? And you won't improve quality by trying to increase bitrate. You just increase the flaws. You're trying to get a quart from a pint pot. Impossible.
