SPORT: Six Nations Rugby Union - Ireland v France
On: BBC 1 HD

KO Time: 17:00

Live coverage from Dublin as Declan Kidney's Ireland host Philippe Saint-Andre's France. Last year's Six Nations clash between the two nations was a hard-fought 17-17 draw in Paris, a rare stalemate after the initial match had to be postponed because of freezing sub-zero temperatures in the French capital. Ireland have not beaten France since February 2009, and that 31-20 victory is their only triumph against Les Bleus in 13 attempts. Commentary by Eddie Butler and Brian Moore.
