This book is all about the single most powerful move that humans can make to promote health, reduce obesity, lower the cost of health care, nurture our fragile environment, conserve our energy resources, feed the world's steadily growing population, and greatly reduce the suffering of animals in factory farms all over the world. As Dr. T. Colin Campbell says, "It turns out that if we eat the way that promotes the best health for ourselves, we also promote the best health for the planet."

Like a blinding flash of the obvious, the single most viable solution to all of these issues is an aggressive move in the direction of consuming much more whole, plant-based foodsΓÇönot necessarily becoming vegetarian or vegan. This book clearly explains how and why we began eating the wrong food for our species and provides helpful guidelines for getting us back on the road to vibrant health and effortless weight-loss.
