,potvinsuks,2013-03-21T05:05Z,Just installed this and everything went smooth pierce.  I highly recommend the Playsims/Horizon VFR Generation X of Ireland to go with this.  It's volumes 9 and 10.  Couldn't find 10 but I installed 9 which covers the East side of the country where this (Dublin) is and it worked seamlessly.  http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7885550/[FSX]_-_Horizon_-_VFR_Generation_X_-_Vol.9_Ireland_East_(Scene)
