in providing this quality release. And who said the Green Skull stands for nothing :)
A sincerely appreciated effort."
,grant1863,2013-03-12T01:38Z,"I disagree Bynx.  I started listening to this audiobook in Shelby Foote's own voice a few years ago.  I couldn't listen to more than a half hour.  His southern drawl is very hard to understand, in my Yankee opinion.  :)"
