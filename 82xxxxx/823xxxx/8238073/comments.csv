,Lardzor,2013-03-10T09:22Z,"And the winner is... Temporal Smoothing Filter !!!
I looked at the sample.  The added frames are just an average of the before and after frames."
,Lardzor,2013-03-10T09:50Z,"If the encoder had any competence, he would have used Virtualdub with THIS temporal filter which uses motion tracking instead of just averaging adjacent frames:

*High quality motion-based frame interpolation has been used to recreate the 48fps
viewing experience of the movie since the BD features only the 24/1001 fps version.
The frame interpolation is based on a slightly modified version of the well-known
Interframe() script. Interpolated frames have been also sharpened to match more or
less the level of sharpness of the original source frames. This is NOT the real
thing! Frame interpolation is not perfect and will never be! May and will contain
traces of ghosting and haloing! Don't complain about it, you have been warned! If
you want the real deal, buy the 48 fps master or go to the cinema!

*The encode runs at 48 fps, so it uses twice the bitrate of a normal 720p encode.
Due to the frame interpolation, each frame is preceeded and followed by a ""fake""
frame, which hurts the coherence of the source, thus affecting x264's prediction.
For related quality considerations, bi-predictive frames have NOT been used. 2pass
has been used to keep the file size of this long movie in a sane range."
,marin85,2013-03-18T12:20Z,"@Lardzor: I have seen such poor noob trolls like you everywhere. If you knew what you were talking about instead of pretending to, you would have known:
1. Interframe uses SVP, which does use motion tracking; averaging is done where it is done in order to minimize artifacts, but is it only PART of the whole process.
2. Speaking of artifacts, MSU FRC produces so many artifacts that the Hobbit loses all its beauty and just looks plain horrible.
3. Speaking of MSU FRC, it is so slow and unstable with Avisynth that it is unusable, even if it were any good.

So, next time, before you question the competence of the encoder, get your hands dirty with the source instead of talking BS."
,sean2e1958,2013-03-20T08:42Z,So the simple answer is its's not 43fps?? would like to know cos I'm downloading one thats 26 gb....

,Lardzor,2013-03-23T05:39Z,"I would like to apologize.

I was wrong, and I'm not as knowledgeable about encoding algorithms as I'd like to be. 

I just downloaded the sample and looked at several frames and it seemed from the severe ghosting that the interpolated frames were just a blend of the adjacent frames. 

My previous posts were made with that erroneous assumption. I knew there were much better filters available than what I thought I was seeing, and I thought the MSU filter was one of them.

After looking at the samples again, it is clear that there is more being done than just blending adjacent frames.

If the Interframe script was used, then it does call the fvpflow plugin which does calculates motion vectors to generate it's results.

My bad, I was wrong. Sorry."
,marin85,2013-03-26T16:42Z,"@Lardzor: I am sorry for my harsh reply, too, but it was very discouraging (to put it mildly) to read something like what you wrote before.

Anyhow, I am glad we cleared the matter. No bad feelings."
