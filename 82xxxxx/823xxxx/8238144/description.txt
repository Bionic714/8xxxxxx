Plot of 'Ek Ghar'
Rajanna and Geeta arrive in the city in the fond hope of building a cosy little home. When they discover just such a house their happiness knows no bounds. Things are fine till, one day, a workshop opens up next door and brings with it a wide variety of sounds. When the noise crosses the bounds of tolerance, Ranjanna is indignant but cannot do much, until he discovers that his wife has achieved the impossible task of getting the shed vacated, but only by yielding to the demands of the police inspector. Rajanna now wants to take Geeta away from the environment. He seeks the help of the workmen who had earlier occupied the shed, but discovers that their slum is being demolished to make way for a multinational.
