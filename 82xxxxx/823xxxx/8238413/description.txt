A female serpent watches helplessly as her mate is shot and killed by a man and five friends. She watches as they attempt in vain to search for her mate's body.

She kills one of the six men the very next day, and yet another the next day. Then when she is ready to kill the third man, she finds out that he is wearing an amulet that protects him from all snakes. She decides to wait and bid her time, She knows she has time on her side, and she can use her powers to change to any human form, for she can be anybody she wants - wife, seductress, mistress, damsel in distress - all of which spell out to one thing - death for the remaining four - at any cost
