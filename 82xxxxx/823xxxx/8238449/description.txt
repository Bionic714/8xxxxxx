The Anthology of American Folk Music is a six-album compilation released in 1952 by Folkways Records (catalogue FP 251, FP 252, and FP 253), comprising eighty-four American folk, blues and country music recordings that were originally issued from 1927 to 1932.
Experimental filmmaker Harry Smith compiled the music from his personal collection of 78 rpm records. The album is famous due to its role as a touchstone for the American folk music revival in the 1950s and 1960s. The Anthology was released for compact disc by Smithsonian Folkways Recordings on August 19, 1997

The compilation was divided by Smith into three two-album volumes: Ballads, Social Music, and Songs. 

Smith s booklet in the original release makes reference to three additional planned volumes in the series, which would anthologize music up until 1950. In 2000, Revenant Records worked with the Harry Smith Archive to recreate and release a fourth volume, organized around a theme of work and entitled Labor Songs. It includes a selection of union songs, and anthologizes material released as late as 1940.

Harry Smith s Anthology of American Folk Music, Volume 4 is a two-disc compilation of twenty-eight American folk recordings originally released on 78 rpm records between 1927 and 1940, issued in May 2000 on Revenant Records, catalogue number 211. Compiled by experimental filmmaker and notable eccentric Harry Smith as the fourth album of his Anthology of American Folk Music set from 1952, it was never completed by Smith himself.
