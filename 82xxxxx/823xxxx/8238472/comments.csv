,garannodou,2013-03-11T09:21Z,"Oh wow. A few weeks ago I was thinking how cool something like this would be. I'll definitely give it a try when it finishes downloading (seems like it'll be a long download). 

One question. Does this include the First Night and Last Night episodes of Night and the Doctor?"
,DonovanFE,2013-03-11T09:47Z,"Yes, it does."
,SnoGryph1,2013-03-28T09:10Z,"Wow, what a lot of work.  And here, I was thinking you'd just put the River Song eps in *her* chronological order.
Kudos and Thank you!  :)"
,struggler420,2013-03-30T17:28Z,"OK I was vaguely curious about this, so I dl' it just to have something different to watch while waiting for the new ep. I liked the concept of taking the timeline of River Song and rearranging into what would be correct order for her. So last night I watched part 1 and I have to say, I'm really impressed with the obvious time and care spent putting this all together in such a cohesive manner, which, considering how un - cohesive the entire show is, seems like a lot of work. Going from Demon's Run to Demon's Run full circle like that is bloody genius, though. I really enjoyed seeing that full journey from start to end and how it ended in the same place. Thank you, Donovan, for your dedication, curiosity, ingenuity, and your clear understanding of warping time to make it fit where you want it. I finished the dl, am currently seeding at over 250kb's, and can't wait til tonight to watch the rest of this."
,SnoGryph1,2013-05-20T13:02Z,"Thank you so much.  This is really very well done!  I LOVE River Song, and I HATE the whole star-crossed lovers thing she & our favorite Doc have going on.  I've wanted to see the whole story from her point of view, and here you've done it, and with excellence.  Now you have a new bit to add, since ""The Name of the Doctor"".  :)
The subtitles, explaining where--or rather when--everyone is in relationship to Demon's Run is great.  I have one suggestion: that you put place names, too (if it's not immediately obvious).
Thanks again, Donovan!"
