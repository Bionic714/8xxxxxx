I find myself just skipping and skipping over most of it."
,melbcro,2013-03-10T14:22Z,Great episode! So many former SNL stars on this episode!
,Getabrain,2013-03-10T18:18Z,"I agree with you trace535. SNL without Kristen Wiig, it's like Christmas without a tree. However I found this episode with Timberlake rather good..."
,sultan14,2013-03-10T19:23Z,thats boring.
,mattman21,2013-03-10T21:19Z,After farley died It hasn't been worth a watch really.
,ZombiesNBaconFlavorBrains,2013-03-10T22:04Z,Fantastic Quality! I love this episode! Thank you so much!
,firexninja,2013-03-11T05:18Z,thank you!
,Death2Dipshits,2013-03-12T04:21Z,You must be a fucking moron if you think ONE cast member is the life or death of SNL...
,jesusman82,2013-03-12T07:27Z,great episode.. the dating game thing was top notch..top 25 in 37 years
,funseeker521,2013-03-12T17:13Z,"Can't believe there are such narrow minds that you can't see beyond one funny guy twenty years ago. If you are truly a fan, you can recognize that these kids are just as talented. As the previous ensembles.  THANKS for the DL!!!"
,fabriciojose,2013-03-21T02:08Z,Thank you!
,zakimar5,2013-03-24T06:56Z,"SNL has always needed some CORE funny people to carry the other losers on the cast.

Eddie Murphy, Chris Rock, Belushi, MacDonald, Hammond, Sudekis, Fey, Farley, Lovitz, Hartman are the exceptions. Look how many cast members were booted out after one or two seasons."

Thanks for the upload"
,zakimar5,2013-03-26T21:07Z,I can't wait to see if Timberlake comes back to make fun of Bush (either one will do) when they are dead.
