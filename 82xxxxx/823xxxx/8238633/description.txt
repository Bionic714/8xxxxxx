Marking the one-year anniversary death of Lori Lemaris (later revealed as a lie) Clark and Ronald prepare a memorial for Lori in the form of a song of poetry. Clark tells the story of his first love to the poet. He'd met Lori in college when her wheel chair speeded down a hill, which he stopped by using his laser beam on the wheels. She flung into his arms and it was love at first sight. They went on dates but Lori always cut them short. Clark fell hopelessly in love and proposed but Lori couldn't accept. She knew about his powers and she herself also had a big secret that would make a union between them impossible.
