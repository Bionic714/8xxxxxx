,tdurden83,2013-03-11T06:16Z,"thx man, great episode. can someone plz tell me if they are still planning on canceling this show? that was the last I heard, but i'm hoping someone has heard otherwise"
,Future_TV,2013-03-12T00:37Z,@tdurden83 They are still moving forward with the cancellation. Pretty shitty. This is the 2nd to last episode. 
,black.hat,2013-03-12T17:06Z,"What?!? I hadn't heard about the cancellation, so this is real bad news to me. I might have to make these remaining few episodes last a while...  :-(

On another note, I have to thank @loadstone2k12 for even making it possible for me to see this show in the fantastic high-definition glory that it was meant to be seen. It made the breakdown of my TiVo so much more bearable. Keep up the good work.

And thanks to those who seed and make the transfers happen so fast."
