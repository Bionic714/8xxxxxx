Probably never, since EA has that DRM thing, which requires you to connect to EA servers all the time. No offline version avail."

Good picture however towards the end it becomes slightly unstable. The sound is good but out of sync by .2 of a second which is fixable with VLC however with about 5 minutes to go it goes out of sync again, nothing too major just will need to be adjusted. Other than that i would say one of the best copies out to date.

Cheers "
,ScottyD7421,2013-03-18T13:34Z,Oh i forgot to mention that it has small hardcoded Chinese subs on the bottom of the screen but they don't really interfere with the overall watching process.
