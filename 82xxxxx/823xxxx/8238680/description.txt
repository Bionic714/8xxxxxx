Dave Smith founded Sequential Circuits in the mid-70s, and in 1977 he designed the Prohet-5 - the world's first microprocessor-based musical instrument and first completely programmable and polyphonic synth, which set the standard for all synth designs that have followed. He designed numerous instruments at Sequential, and subsequently at Yamaha and Korg. As president of Seer Systems he developed the world's first software synthesizer in the mid-90s.

Dave is also generally known as the driving force behind the generation of MIDI specification in 1981 - in fact, he coined the acronym. In 1987 he was named a Fellow of the Audio Engineering Society (AES) for his continuing work in the area of music synthesis.

In the last few years Dave has returned to the hardware instruments with the Evolver and Poly Evolver synths, which combine real analog electronics with digital processing to create yet another new world of unique instruments.

This includes a 90 minute complete history of Dave Smith from Prophet to MIDI to the PolyEvolver and roundtable discussion with Dave Smith, Roger Linn and Tom Oberheim.
