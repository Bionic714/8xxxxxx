The only album of this forgotten US heavy psychedelic band was released in early 1969 on tiny LHI label owned by the famous artist/producer Lee Hazlewood. This record mostly contained a trippy and quite intense music with lots of Hammond organ passages, loud and fuzzed-out guitar parts & solid drumming. It can be easily described as a stylistic combination of Vanilla Fudge, The Doors and especially Iron Butter?y. It worth noting that the title track lasted nearly I6 minutes and its structure was very similar to In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida. Unfortunately, the album (and also single with cover of MacArthur Park) went almost completely unnoticed. Soon after the band changed its name to American Eagle and in 1970 released an eponymous LP for Decca Records.
