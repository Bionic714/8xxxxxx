@yify:

Is This a copy of The Exorcist (The Version You've Never Seen) 2000 version blu-ray rip."
,Shifty_Shellshock,2013-03-10T16:05Z,Do you know what she did? Your cunting daughter
,rajakumar,2013-03-10T17:49Z, please seed very slow download 0.2kb/s max.
,assmanvendetta,2013-03-10T21:05Z,you are a god
,FrozenApe,2013-03-11T00:26Z,"Rajakumar, the reason why it's slow is because Pazuzu has possessed the torrent. Get your holy water ready to bless your puter after torrent finishes in 12 days. The Power of Christ compels you! "
,onlyHD,2013-03-11T17:05Z,"Hey FrozenApe, what the fuck is your problem. Why don't you use your 1200 gram brain to think before leaving a comment. Don't be a racist you dumb ass. Did any body asked your opinion about christ or holy water. STFU."
,ADK93,2013-03-11T18:07Z,have you got in brrp 720p?
,rajakumar,2013-03-12T04:49Z,"
@onlyHD:

Thanks for your support."
,FrozenApe,2013-03-12T16:06Z,"OnlyHD, your mom says hello and asks you to get a sense of humor along with an IQ raise of 60 points. Now go back to WOW and eating cheetos. "
,torrentjl,2013-03-18T17:49Z,"@ FrozenApe

Great comeback dumbass.

Respect people's religion, that is what onlyHD was getting at. Additionally, even though it might take 12 days to download, respect the torrent, YIFY took the time to encode and upload the torrent. If you don't respect it or complain about the downloading process, simply don't download it."
,bitloks,2013-03-21T09:50Z,"I didn't see anything racist inFrozenApe's comments. Nore anything against any religion. What I did see was a clever quote from the movie dumb-arses.
Grow up and grow some skin thicker than cling wrap!

Also Bitloks encoded this and uploaded it to the Yify web site.
He is also seeding it from his own seedbox. So if it's dowloading slow it's your end that is having the issue."
,FrozenApe,2013-03-22T20:20Z,"onlyHD, torrentjl, and rajakumar are probably 11 or 12 year olds that never have never even seen The Exorcist. That's why those crybabies complainers did not get my pun. 

It simply never ceases to amaze me the IQ level of some of the punters that show up here on TPB.

Now you WOW playing, cheetos eating Nobel Prize Potentials can go back to your regular scheduled programming. THE POWER OF CHRIST COMPELS YOU!!! 

Your mother's in here, OnlyHD. Would you like to leave a message? I'll see that she gets it."
,Robo88,2013-03-24T18:02Z,"I tried VLC, KMPlayer, Media Player Classic, some codecs (CCCP) but still the video blocks my player for 2-3 seconds from time to time. [
I have a 3,5 Ghz quad processor, and no problems with other HD files.]
I think this is not properly encoded, because  some scenes of the movie are grainy.

,komrage,2013-03-30T15:51Z,Only english subtitle? why?
,Jedi.In.Training,2013-05-01T10:19Z,"Dear FrozenApple,
That comeback was ass.
You have no way of knowing if onlyHD is in fact a stereotypical WOW deadbeat. On the other hand, you DO have a 1200 gram brain (perhaps less) and you did make a non-funny derogatory remark. You powned yourself."

You ain't no George Carlin. Btw, that movie sucked so bad, I would rather spend 90 minutes staring at your mother's dirty asshole while she takes a runny dump. You powned yourself."
,Jedi.In.Training,2013-05-02T01:14Z,The comment I left at 10:27 pm is the final draft. My bad for posting twice.
,LuJr,2013-05-09T12:03Z,Great quality.. thanks so much!
