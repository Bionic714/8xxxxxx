I have tried and it works. Make sure you install correctly and try deleting your fsx.cfg. Beside that i really have no clue whats wrong. Am sorry :( "
,Niceify,2013-03-10T15:34Z,"Please seed guys.

Kantonn@ Try my method in the 'readme'

And try deleting the fsx.cfg. If not msg me another i see what can i help you with."
,K3nnyize,2013-03-10T15:39Z,Thanks to @sintez-2 and @fskillerX you guys are awesome :) 
,boinga,2013-03-10T15:44Z,where should I apply the crack files??
,Niceify,2013-03-10T15:51Z,Just copy and paste it in the FSX MAIN FOLDER and let it merge and replace 
,Niceify,2013-03-10T16:12Z,@Kantonnn Just install the 2 installer and dun take anything from the RIP version. Only install things from installer
,Dmitry_bravo,2013-03-10T16:19Z,It works Thanks!
,sintez-2,2013-03-10T16:26Z,"When install via ""enable button"" - some panel.cfg files are missing (for PW & LR models). Get it from RIP torrent"

,clintferns,2013-03-10T19:17Z,"Works Great...all versions...including the 300er and freighter.Remember to download the installers that are already uploaded on the bay.Thanks

Request the liveries for the aircraft from the captain sim website, as iam unable to access it...thanks"
,kabuto78,2013-03-10T19:36Z,all versions not work
,kabuto78,2013-03-10T19:46Z,"Control wheels blocked, MCP not work correctly.
Outboard and inboard ailerons not move.

,Eroxz564,2013-03-10T20:37Z,Well its working. Its just that you who not get it to work havent installed it correct dont blame the product...  But the aircraft has loads of problems so just wait for PMDG or wait for updates :P
,rmeleby,2013-03-10T20:57Z,Which activation method do we select for install?
,rmeleby,2013-03-10T21:33Z,"Well, it is a stunning visual model, but not much else to praise here.

Would get odd text flickering in the ND/PFD.

VNAV is really unpredictable, and would totally exceed every constraint set by the FMC.

Also had really poor FPS with the 777, and I have a rock solid build running the PMDG NGX beyond 35fps.

Glad I didn't buy this, and was able to try it out. Looks like I will wait until CS resolves these issues with vnav and graphics glitches, or until PMDG releases theirs.

Thanks for the effort everyone."
,aFgPilot,2013-03-10T21:33Z,"Hey  Niceify  thanks for upload! i have one question , do i need the other installers from fskiller or this is the complete and latest version?i mean does it include all variants of 777-200 and 777-300?"
,monaf89,2013-03-10T21:47Z,what is the order number please ??
,Niceify,2013-03-11T00:13Z,Guys. Choose offline activation and choose key from captain sim. And then use the enablebutton 
,Espana25,2013-03-11T00:25Z,OK for me everything works like a charm except the fact that the AP has really been creating issues for me sometimes its impossible to use AP even without the FMC or with the FMC settings done correctly the AP doesn't seem to respond and puts the aircraft to stall every now and then please let me know if anyone else is also having issues with AP!
,Capt.Jambo,2013-03-11T02:30Z,"Thanx a lot

PLUR"
,Capt.Jambo,2013-03-11T02:53Z,"I can't go through with the installation. I it asking to activate. Can some one please walk me through step by step. I would much appreciate if some one did.

PLUR"
,el_kab0ng,2013-03-11T03:58Z,"Thanks for the repack! The plane finally works now after install (such that it is). Unfortunately it's almost unflyable with such shitty VNAV programming by the tool bags at CS (pretty typical given their track record, actually). I can't believe anyone actually paid for this, though. "
,kingashi,2013-03-11T04:57Z,"@ Capt.Jambo

how do you get past the installation pls share the information...
thanks "
,Windgunner,2013-03-11T07:53Z,"To get this thing running you need to have the Enbale Button, which you can find in most PMDG cracks. It will allow you to advance the instalation in the serial part. Keep in mind you have to run it as administrator.

If you want the 773, you can have it as well, just go looking in the comment section of the other CS Boeing 777 torrents, at least the later ones.

I have every thing installed, even the freighters, and it's working as it should. The only thing i don't like about this plane is that it sometimes starts to rock the wings very harshly while on AP, when going through turbulence, but if you fly it manually, you can make it fly smoothly and you can turn the AP again in no time.

Hope this helps!"
,fskillerX,2013-03-11T08:40Z,thanks for you finally peoples can fly

,Niceify,2013-03-11T16:01Z,"Please stop throwing your temper around kid

You are just 1 dumb fuck. People got it working and you does not. Dun even bother ask nicely, in fact its free. So just suck it up. 

No offence but you seriously crossed the line.

,kabuto78,2013-03-11T16:18Z,@Niceify - fuck you asshoole

,aFgPilot,2013-03-11T17:24Z,@ Niceify did you get the 777F and 777-300 working? 777-200ER AND LR WORK FINE BUT I REALLY LOVE 777-300
,aFgPilot,2013-03-11T17:44Z,"@ sintez-2 COME ON MAN, FUCK IT MAN ,TELL ME HOW TO GET THE 777-300 TO WORK YOU ARE A CRACKER I KNOW ITS EASY FOR YOU"
,rmeleby,2013-03-11T18:49Z,"Kabuto - I don't understand what is so difficult. You run enable button as administrator. You don't have to do anything inside the Enablebutton app itself, just run it, and move it to the side.

Run the installer, select the offline activation method, then ""use key from captainsim"". Enable button will allow you to continue, even with nothing in the field.

It should install normally. Then you copy the Simobjects & Captain_Sim folder in the   csx772_1000_crack.7z file, and paste it into your FSX root.

It worked for me the first time. 

If it didn't, I sure as hell wouldn't be slamming the uploader/cracker because of my own ineptitude. 

Stop being such a baby and troubleshoot, instead of whining."

,liljo44,2013-03-12T01:20Z,"The 777 200 er and pw work well ,if someone could give the instructions to install the 777 300s and F it would be nice thanks for the bird."
,Espana25,2013-03-12T01:31Z,after getting the 200ER PW and the LR series i am really pleased and cant think of anything more of become more like greedy for 300 and all which can already cripple up what i have got working by trying to monkey around with the expansion as long as the real working thing doesn't come out for other 300 series and related expansions.
,maddog7777,2013-03-12T01:41Z,"In order to get the 300 and F to work, they had to have been activated. They will not work properly just installing them from the cracked base pack exe file included in this torrent. You can still install them, but you will not have access to most of the features that are needed to fly those planes. In other words, the 300 and F are useless at this point. "
,Taco92,2013-03-12T07:47Z,Works! Thanks!
,rmeleby,2013-03-12T13:02Z,"Tried another flight.

Yep, VNAV and even FLCH are pretty much just there for show. They don't actually function. Still ignores any constraint set by the FMC.

Also while climbing to FL300, there would be a lateral swaying motion, so it looks like LNAV is also FUBAR.

That is extremely disappointing. PSS had all of that working in 2005 on FS9.

I don't mean to detract from the effort of those who cracked this bird, marvelous job on that...

But this aircraft should still be in the Alpha development phase, not at 1.1, with a 60 Euro price tag. No. Thanks."
,Niceify,2013-03-12T13:32Z,"Just manual flying no vnav on this plane its SUCK! 

Anyway thanks for downloading ^^ "
,Espana25,2013-03-12T19:32Z,Lighting system and VNAV sucks big time on this thing i wonder who ended up buying this shit just because of some high detailed Exterior but with no realistic Interior this thing is no good than a nice model toy flying around! i would have never wasted my $124 on this thing ever at all seriously i am dieing to see PMDG 777 its gonna be a big time real thing not like this stupid plane also fuckin heavy on frames.
,almostatys,2013-03-12T22:56Z,"I bought original 777 about Captain Sim webshop,but this aircraft is very shit!!! This original aircraft has many bugs! I have v1.1 too,but the v1.0+VNAV fix is better than v1.1. The v1.1 is an unstable service pack! I hate 777 by Captain Sim!!!
I'm waiting PMDG 777."
,Espana25,2013-03-13T00:39Z,"Flight displays also doesn't show traffic,terrain and other related data even after turning on the TCAS is it just me or this plane is really coming out as a useless shitty toy and worse than FSX default planes.?????"
,rmeleby,2013-03-13T02:51Z,It isn't just you. Trust me.
,maddog7777,2013-03-13T23:04Z,"Unfortunately this is messed up! Not sure if it is the cracks or the bird itself. Instruments are there, but most do not work. The cabin view KLM that comes with it sucks and the plane itself is lacking the quality that CS767 has. I ripped the files to see where the issue is and I will try to fix it. "
,Espana25,2013-03-13T23:19Z,Alright! here's the news the shitty self of this plane has let me uninstall it of my FSX just in 2 days of useless fun.
,maddog7777,2013-03-14T00:12Z,"@espana25! No, there is something wrong with it. Some planes do not even show the landing gear. I am thinking it is in the installer itself and has bugs. Some of the planes have lights and some none. Some of them I can not even fly because my yoke has no control. So there is something wrong with this version as of now. "

,maddog7777,2013-03-14T05:50Z,"@jerdoxx! You call everyone douche bags, misspell and then you want us to check out your channel! What for? If you had read some comments, some did actually buy this and were having the same issues. They are not complaining about the torrent but rather the issues with the plane itself. It has nothing to do with people not knowing how to fly it! There are a lot of bugs in this release and it is not the person who uploaded its fault. Everyone has a right to his or her opinion. "
,zaib786,2013-03-14T05:59Z,Installed and reporting it as working fine for me using Win 7 x64 on a craptop only EFB has black screen all the time and nothing happens even after pressing PWR button over it might I need some charts in the folder dedicated to it. Any ideas? :o)

,alz403,2013-03-26T16:42Z,"Please could you explain a little more detail?, Only I have to open or run EnableButton?. The steps I follow are ... Run enable button, install 1000.exe, 1000.exe crack applied, install and apply crack 1100.exe 1100. The plane did not respond to any controls or flaps, spoilers and ailerons etc. or column. What am I doing wrong?

Thank you very much and sorry for my English."

I got 772 1000 opened, and then opened enablebutton all in admin mode-

I tried all options-
Instant onlone activation,
manual offline activation,
and else-
Can you explain how to install, please?"
,loserguy,2013-03-29T15:49Z,the -200LR and 200ER versions work perfectly but the 300ER and the -F versions miss the landing gears. I tried installing them both from the ripped torrent and also from their respective installers as provided by fskillerX but they just don't work. Is there a separate crack for the 300 and F versions?
,loserguy,2013-03-29T15:54Z,"And for all those struggling with enable button, its pretty straight forward.

Open the installer, proceed to the activation part. Now choose offline activation and then select the option which assumes you ""have the key from captainsim"". Now open the enablebutton!!!

You needn't do anything in the enable button interface. The ""next"" in the installation window should automatically get unlocked. Then proceed with the installation.

You don't necessarily have to press anything inside the enable button interface!! Hope this helps

1. right click on ""enablebutton"" and then run as administrator

2. run ""csx772_1000"" and install until finish (choose manual activation & then choose use a key received from captain sim)

3. don't input anything ! the next button should be active (if not, re-open ""enablebutton"" until next button is active)

,el_kab0ng,2013-04-12T03:33Z,"IMHO, more focus needs to be put on cracking the 737 series from CS. The 777 is a total piece of shit to fly and now that they are moving to the L1011 without correcting anything in the 777, it's going to be that way for quite awhile. There's a guy selling the 37 for like 3 euros on rutracker, so someone has to have this thing cracked by now and is just not willing to share."
