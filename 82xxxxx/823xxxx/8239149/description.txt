Although American, Jack Downing became Swedens pioneer of roots rock. In the 60s and 70s, in his adopted country, he issued a string of singles and an album compiled for the first time on A Force That Cannot Be Named: The Jack Downing Anthology . The released recordings - including the first-ever reissue of Downings' sole album - are supplemented by unreleased studio demos and live radio appearances, taking in the full story from 1966 to 1974. Disc one contains all the non LP singles, single versions of tracks, unreleased recordings, 1966-1973. Disc Two has the one LP from 1970, plus a major radio session from 1971 and two tracks from the recording live at the Tonkraft 1974. 

After arriving in Sweden in 1963, Downing formed The Other Side in 1965. Their debut single Like a Rollin´ Stone/ Out My Light opens the anthology. Both the Bob Dylan classic and Out My Light are lacerating garage-rocking Americana that became Downings' musical calling-card, setting him up as the leading light of Sweden s music. 

Jack Downing was a force, sweeping everything along with him. A character that could have been in Jack Kerouac's On The Road, he had his own, rambunctious take on Dylan, Hoyt Axton and Merle Haggard. The constant by Jack s side was keyboard player Dave Hynes (who also co-wrote with Downing), with legendary Swedish guitarist Kenny Håkansson also along for the ride. The groups Downing had backing him and Hynes were always strong so, in 1974, on Jesse Winchester's Isn't That So, the power remained undiminished. 

With a liner note by leading Swedish music writer Per Magnusson, whose article on Jack Downing was published in Ugly Things last year and did much to raise awareness, including input from Dave Hynes, A Force That Cannot Be Named: The Jack Downing Anthology is the definitive statement on this important figure.
