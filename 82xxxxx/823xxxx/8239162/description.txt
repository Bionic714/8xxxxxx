Memphis is well known as the birthplaces of the blues, the fount of southern soul - and the locale that begat rock 'n' roll. The city boasted a healthy rock scene well into the 1960s and 1970s, but few retrospectives have documented Memphis music in the psychedelic era when, as a major recording center, it was the nexus not just for local freaks, but those from neighboring Arkansas, Mississippi and beyond.
