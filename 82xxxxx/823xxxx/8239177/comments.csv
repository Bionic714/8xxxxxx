Quick question here:

What are the main differences between the 720 rips you put up the day before the tv show airs and these WEB DL DD5's that you always put up a day after the show airs? "

What I meant to say is:

What would you say are the main differences between the rips you upload the day that the show aired and the WEB DL DD5's that you upload the day after? "

HDTV rips mean they were ripped and encoded off the broadcast signal from a TV source. Web-DL means they were taken from a web streaming service that are usually available the next day.  Web-DL is superior in quality since it doesn't show the network the show airs on on the bottom right, or the TV rating on the top left.  Occasionally, HDTV rips will also have ads that pop up on the bottom of the screen advertising other shows."
