The first ever round up of all the singles, AΓÇÖs and BΓÇÖs, that Ian Hunter issued for CBS and Chrysalis.

Hunter split from Mott The Hoople in 1975 and started a solo career with 1975s Once Bitten Twice Shy, right through until late 83s Somethins Goin On, this 29 track release has all of Ians 45s including many versions that were specially edited from LP length.

The sadly missed Mick Ronson plays on a good few of the tracks and other contributions come from the likes of Queen, members of Bruce Springsteens E Street Band including Clarence Clemons, John Cale of Velvet Underground and The Clashs Mick Jones. (spincds.com)
