Four decades of the very best acoustic folk music from the British Isles. The Acoustic Folk Box is an exciting four CD journey through the inspiring and provocative first four decades of the folk revival in Britain. There have been other anthologies but this is the first one devoted to the acoustic thread and features the leading artists of the genre.

The package contains four CDS, 85 tracks in a roughly chronological sequence, together with a lavish 56 page booklet containing scores of photographs and illustrations and comprehensive notes on every artist and every track. The project was produced by the acclaimed folk historian, David Suff, who has written in depth scene-setting essays, describing the music and putting it in context. Of the 85 tracks, many are rare and have not been released before on CD and all have been carefully remastered to give the best possible sound.
