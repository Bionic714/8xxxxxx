Model Comments: Hey guys!! Well, to start off I am from AZ, have been here my whole life. I enjoy entertaining tv shows, working and having an awesome time with friends. I am kind of shy and sort of a nerd. Sometimes I would rather stay at home and watch a good movie than go out. I am pretty low maintenance and little things make me happy. I am very generous and don't expect very much from others. If a friend was broken down or needed help, I would be there in a heartbeat if I could! I love pets! I have a dog of my own and shes always hanging out with me. She is the best company! I really love art. Seeing it, and also doing it myself. I've been trying to work on being more active and my favorite gym activity is yoga! When it comes to others I am very understanding and never judge others. My friends and family will always mean a lot to me. I really enjoy people watching and seeing how people interact. It might sound weird but I think most people do it. Also, I love cooking and baking! Baking definitely comes to me more easily. I want to be a pastry chef someday!
