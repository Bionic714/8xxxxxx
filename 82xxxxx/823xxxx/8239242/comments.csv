How can i fit this onto a dvd disc?"
,sageman98,2013-03-10T17:49Z,"It's not meant to be put on a DVD.
Have you ever heard of BluRay?
That's why its called a BRRip."

I think you'll find there a thousands of BRRip's all over the internet that have been compressed to fit a 4.7gb dvd disc.It was a simple enough question!  "
,outback7,2013-03-10T19:17Z,Thanks!  Here's hoping this downloads faster than the 16GB+ one that supposedly has 900+ seeds.
,owenpie,2013-03-11T10:36Z,pottermouth you just answered your own question..if its too big re-encode it to fit a 4.7 GB DVD or even an 8.5 DL DVD. 
,pottermouth,2013-03-11T11:15Z,WHAT I MEANT TO SAY IS WHAT PROGRAM IS BEST TO COMPRESS?
,RenzoHodw,2013-03-12T00:43Z,What is the difference with the 16GB version
,outback7,2013-03-12T17:00Z,@ RenzoHodw - About 7 gigs.  :)
,RenzoHodw,2013-03-14T02:16Z,The same 3D that 16GB+?

There is a 4 second delay at the middle. Probably due to second disk. subtitles are not 3D. Download srt sub, adjust to compensate the 4 sec delay and convert to 3d .ass file."
