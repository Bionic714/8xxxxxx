Description

Redesigning the Church for the Age to Come is a charge to believing Christians to reignite their passion for serving Jesus.

Many know the truth of the Scriptures but the power of God resides in the application of these truths.

Living in an age where it is growing more and more dark, we, as Believers, must trim our wicks and brighten our intensity in order to illuminate the world by letting our lights so shine! I believe there will be one last great revival and it will be led by everyday Believers who are following as close to Jesus as they possible can! Join with those who once again want the Church to have the reputation as "those who are turning the world upside down!"

JESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.

Born of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.
