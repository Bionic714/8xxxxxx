,bokeatong,2013-03-11T04:25Z,When I was going through the lists of crossovers one of them did have to unlimited access listed but I just thought that it was a mistake. I'll look into it for the next version when/if I find more or if more are made.

,bokeatong,2013-03-11T07:17Z,None of this is fan made. These were all released in a shared effort by DC and Marvel.
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-11T10:42Z,"thanks again bokeatong. yeah all this was published, a lot of it when i was in high school in the 1990s. my favorites were incredible hulk vs. superman and jla/avengers."
