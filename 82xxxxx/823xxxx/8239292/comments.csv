Now I have written some programs to help me. But it still is a pain. I gather the task is overwhelming for others and they simply give up.

I process all downloads to put them into a common format and give them full meta tags (including disc numbering). This way when I share my collection with others it doesn't obviously look like I downloaded them all.

And I embed art (600x600, Apple's standard I believe). Sometimes each disc has a different cover. Having the tracks in folder by disc makes it much easier to embed such art."

When in folders by disc, it is still one large M3U. Simply right click on the main folder and select play... Your music playing software will play each folder in order.

Note I am not complaining that the tracks have no meta tags. When in folders by disc they are easy to add.

If you leave them in one folder you have to look at the track lists and figure out where the break points are in order to be able to get the disc number in the meta tag. And you don't have the original track number. Often the art will have information or a story about each track. Much easier to match the track with the art if the track has its original number."
