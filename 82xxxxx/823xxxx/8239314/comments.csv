But I am not able to register it. It asked for
LicenseID & Password, but found no possibility to get that from the keygen."
,terratec1234,2013-03-11T20:21Z,"@ peterth You choose your own license ID and password.

Although the keygen generates codes for UF13, the application remains in trial period."
,peterth,2013-03-11T21:54Z,"@terratec1234: in between I was able to start the offline registration, but - you are correct - the application ""didn't say"" registration successful. It remains unregistered."
,peterth,2013-03-13T09:29Z,"Have anyone successful UF13 registered?
And if yes - how? Thanks!"

1. Scroll down to the last line in the keygen (UltraFinder v13.x) if you have not already.
2. You should have provided a numerical License ID in the registration window.
3. Copy both User Codes and paste  them into keymaker.
4. Hit generate
5. Copy both Authorization Codes and paste them into offline activation window.
Unfortunately, I cannot get my name or a License ID in the about window irrespective of my providing the License ID and Password in the Offline Activation window but the startup Register nag is gone.
If someone can, let me know."
