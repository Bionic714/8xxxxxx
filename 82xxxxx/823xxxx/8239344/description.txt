The is the complete BBC series Red Dwarf,all 10 seasons along with Extras from each season(except for Season 10),the very rare 2 Red Dwarf USA Pilots (for NBC/Universal) and a desktop theme I stuck together from 2 partial themes.

All the Videos are XVID 360p (except for Season 10).The Desktop theme was compiled on a Windows XP Pro machine and works on both Windows XP Pro and Windows 7 Ultimate (X64 included).The theme is a self-extracting RAR file.Just install it to its default directory (Usually C:WindowsResourcesThemes) and it's ready to go.I didn't have time to make a screen saver so you can make it yourself.The choices of Wallpapers for this is limited,but if you want more,just use VLC Media Player and do some snapshots then copy them into the directory c:WindowsResourcesThemesRed Dwarf.2 of the wallpapers are cut out models for Red Dwarf and Starbug1.

I am a fan of British Humor,being a long time Monty Python fan.This series satisfies that as well as for some decent Sci-fi.The fact that it's funny as hell sure doesn't hurt any.

So have fun watching Lister,Rimmer Cat and Kryten as they try to figure out what to do.

I'm now a Dwarfer,BTW.
