In 1994, then-graduate student Anu Garg created A Word A Day (AWAD), a Web site and free e-mail service that delivers a new word every day, complete with definition, etymology, sample usage, and commentary. Each week features a different themeΓÇöfrom "Greek Mythology" to "Words from Film"ΓÇöand at the end of the week, Garg sends out a newsletter with enthusiastic feedback from the more than half-million AWAD subscribers around the world.

Inspired by his wildly popular Web site, Garg's first book, A Word A Day, became a national bestseller. Now, he presents a fitting encore: Another Word A Day is the second in a series of books in celebration of the English language, featuring words of all kindsΓÇöunusual, unfamiliar, intriguing, exoticΓÇöthat are in use today. Garg offers fifty-two delightful chapters grouped by theme, ranging from "Words to Describe People," "Toponyms," and "Words Borrowed from Yiddish" to "False Friends," "Words That Aren't What They Appear to Be," and much more.
