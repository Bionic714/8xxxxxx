Hey, The_Duck1, thanks for the share, and for making it a no-brainer, easy install!!! Worked great! (Been out of practice for a few years, since being introduced to TV's with USB input, haven't had to burn anything for a long time.)"

,Polyblendz,2013-05-19T05:16Z,"This aint the full version! Why is everyone on here say it is??? It doesnt have Nero recode, Kwik Media, Nero Vision it only has option to burn to cd and dvd but most features for dvd isnt there!!! THIS IS ONLY GOOD FOR THOSE WANTING TO BURN MP3's! No wonder the file is small!"
