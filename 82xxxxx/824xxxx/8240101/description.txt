 : So begins Matthew Garth's story of the fall of 1962, when the shooting of a:
 : young woman on Thanksgiving Day sets off a chain of unsettling events in   :
 : small-town Willow Falls, Minnesota. Matthew first sees Louisa Lindahl in   :
 : Dr. Dunbar's home office, and at the time her bullet wound makes nearly as :
 : strong an impression as her unclothed body. Fueled over the following weeks:
 : by his feverish desire for this mysterious woman and a deep longing for the:
 : comfort and affluence that appears to surround the Dunbars, Matthew finds  :
 : himself drawn into a vortex of greed, manipulation, and ultimately betrayal.
