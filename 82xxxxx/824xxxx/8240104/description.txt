 : Sonja Skordahl, a Norwegian immigrant, came to America looking for a new   :

 : House--only to find herself defined by her roles as wife and mother.       :
 : Destiny lands Sonja in the studio of Ned Weaver, an internationally        :
 : acclaimed painter. There she becomes more than his model and more than a   :
 : mere object of desire; she becomes the most inspiring muse Ned has ever    :
 : known, much to the chagrin of the artist's wife. When both Ned and Henry   :
 : insist on possessing Sonja, their jealousies threaten to erupt into        :
 : violence--as she struggles to appease both men without sacrificing her     :
 : hard-won sense of self.                                                    :
