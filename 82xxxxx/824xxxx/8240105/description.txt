 : On an icy day in January 1961, in Bismarck, North Dakota, a                :
 : sixteen-year-old boy walks home from high school with his best friend,     :
 : Gene. The sudden sound of sirens startles and excites them, but they don't :
 : have long to wonder what the sound could mean. Soon after seeing police    :
 : cars parked on their street, the boys learn the shocking truth: hours      :
 : before, Gene's father, Raymond Stoddard, walked calmly and purposefully    :
 : into the state capitol and shot to death a charismatic state senator.      :
 : Raymond then drove home and hanged himself in his garage.                  :
 :                                                                            :
 : The horrific murder and suicide leave the community reeling. Speculation   :
 : about Raymond's motives run rampant. Political scandal, workplace          :
 : corruption, financial ruin, adultery, and jealousy are all cited as        :
 : possible catalysts. But in the end, the truth behind the day's events died :
 : with those two men. And for Gene and his friend, the tragedy is a turning  :
 : point, both in their lives and in their friendship.                        :
 :                                                                            :
 : Nearly forty years later, Gene's friend, a writer, revisits the tragedy and:
 : tries to unravel the mystery behind one man's inexplicable actions. Through:
 : his own recollections and his fiction--sometimes impossible to separate--he:
 : attempts to make sense of a senseless act and, in the process, to examine  :
 : his youth, his friendship with Gene, and the love they both had for a      :
 : beautiful girl named Marie.                                                :
 :                                                                            :
 : Spare, haunting, lyrical, Sundown, Yellow Moon is a piercing study of love :
 : and betrayal, grief and desire, youth and remembrance. Using a brilliant,  :
 : evocative fiction-within-fiction structure, Larry Watson not only brings to:
 : life a distinct period in history but, most affectingly, reveals the       :
 : interplay of memory, secrets, and the passage of time.                     :
