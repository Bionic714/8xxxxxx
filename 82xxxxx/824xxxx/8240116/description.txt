 : In the tradition of The Memory Keeper's Daughter, a gripping, generous, and:
 : provocative novel chronicling the grief that follows the death of a        :
 : newborn-and that leads to a family's emotional reawakening.                :
 :                                                                            :
 : It begins with loss. John and Ricky Ryrie are stricken by the death of     :
 : their third child, only fifty-seven hours after his birth. Struggling to   :
 : regain a semblance of normalcy, they find themselves pretending not only   :
 : that little has changed, but that nothing was wrong before this baby came  :
 : so briefly into their lives. Yet in the aftermath of his death,            :
 : long-suppressed uncertainties about their relationship come roiling to the :
 : surface. A dreadful secret emerges concerning what Ricky knew about her    :
 : pregnancy and concealed from everyone, even John.                          :
 : And the couple's two older children, grappling with the tensions around    :
 : them, begin to act out in exquisitely, perhaps courageously, idiosyncratic :
 : ways. Ultimately, though, the grief that was initially so isolating brings :
 : the four family members to connect powerfully with the sadness and burdens :
 : of others- to the grief that is part of every human life and that carries  :
 : within it the ability to draw us together. And in the end, Ricky and John's:
 : marriage is stronger for the transformation their grief has allowed.       :

 : Moving, psychologically acute, and gorgeously written, The Grief of Others :
 : is Leah Hager Cohen at the height of her talent in what is sure to be her  :
 : breakout book, one that forces readers to ask themselves: What would I have:
 : done? The Grief of Others exposes the paradox that facing tragedy together :
 : can in fact awaken us to our better selves and take us from fear to a place:
 : of hope and optimism.                                                      :
