James Price Johnson (Jimmy) (1894-1955) "The Invisible Pianist" because the

supply of fame is insufficient to include the most important artists; influenced

all who came after, in the way Hendrix influenced electric guitar playing.

If not for Johnson, Fats Waller and Earl Hines would have been playing

a quite different music. Art Tatum may be another matter.


Strong statements backed up by great music.


These carefully restored Brunswicks and Deccas from 1930 and 1944 put Jimmy

in YOUR living room..."tickling" at your very own "rent party"..even if your

house is paid off.
