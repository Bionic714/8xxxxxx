Many thanx for all your great UP Mr.Stifmeister :)"
,stalker277,2013-03-11T02:43Z,"Stiffy, if you ask me you've missed the important bits:

""Guerilla Skin"" in-game outfit

Three in-game weapons from ""Hitman: Absolution"" for use in ""Tomb Raider"": The Silverballer, Agency SPS 12, and HX AP-15

These exist but only in the steam ed. I've already got skids... how to get those things above?"
