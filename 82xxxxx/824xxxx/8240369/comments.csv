,user101966,2013-03-11T15:13Z,"No, but I could create them by chopping scenes out of these ones and watermarking them with their logo ;). Oh, and adding annoying voice-over ads while the credits roll.

You don't want the science channel ones."
,user101966,2013-03-12T08:35Z,"Oh, and don't be fooled by the small file sizes. The quality is *as good*, if not better than those other (science channel) versions floating around the net, which are *twice as large* in bytes and 10% *shorter* in running time.

The person who encoded these (bless their hearts) actually understood how to encode an avi properly.

I thank him or her whomever he or she is."
