,theshop,2013-03-11T02:19Z,Do you need 1.1?
,susulock,2013-03-11T04:05Z,I half expected this to be the Directx 10 patch.
,susulock,2013-03-11T04:05Z,But alas.
,weller73,2013-03-11T08:58Z,"""The Hunt is On"" whether that means working multiplayer?"
,shmooflakes,2013-03-11T10:37Z,It just goes to a black screen now
,OmniNegro,2013-03-11T12:18Z,"Two comments here did not read this from the description...

""Note: Check .txt file for list of updates. This release does not require the
previous update. Released internal because EA's 2nd-worst DRM is left intact."""
,martin501,2013-03-11T12:35Z,Update the game.. but still 1.0.0.2000.. is this correct?
,rmc008,2013-03-11T16:23Z,"Yeah, do you need 1.1 or not? Why didn't he say so in the description? I understand it doesn't contain the previous update, but do I NEED it?"
,OmniNegro,2013-03-11T16:57Z,"@rmc008 it *DOES* say that you do *NOT* need the other updates in the description. I even quoted it. What the fuck are you talking about?

I will spell it out for you. It needs *NO* updates bedsides this one. None. Zero. Nada. Zilch.

Nonetheless I would not touch this due to the EA DRM being left in. That sounds to me like it is uncracked."
[V],Mr.Stifmeister,2013-03-11T17:14Z,"@rmc008: Are you kidding me? Srsly??
Maybe you should read the description before you tell anyone to write something.
Please read the NOTE part very slowly again and your answer will be there..."
[V],Mr.Stifmeister,2013-03-11T17:26Z,"@OmniNegro: Thanks.
And about that DRM, well... i dont care about that, aslong the game is working like it does right now :)"
,zagu123,2013-03-11T17:46Z,does it fix the black screen after the intro movie ?
,zagu123,2013-03-11T17:51Z,does it fix the black screen after the intro movie thanks :D
,asqw9,2013-03-11T17:51Z,Game runs fine with this update.
,brianxxx,2013-03-11T20:53Z,"Uhhhhhh....Stiffmeister...do you need the previous update for this to work???

LOL Just fucking with ya...I just love seeing the people who don't read go crazy! lol"
,bliapis,2013-03-12T19:16Z,does this patch allow me to kill Alpha Cheph in the end?
,MadRevolver,2013-03-13T11:01Z,"Do I need previous updates?
haha I am just joking too:P
Thank you a lot dude! I will download the game with this update and play it after Far Cry 3 masterpiece!"
,sourov,2013-03-13T15:48Z,"Does this crack fix the ""Dx11"" error?"
,Shadow416,2013-03-14T22:42Z,"so i tried this torrent and the scene4all torrent, same results (i know its the same torrent).

My game just doesn't run anymore lol won't even show up in the task manager. 

The task was simple so I'm sure i did it right...I posted this on scene's page as well...

I'm jus curious as to why this would happen? Only reason i wanted this update is because i thought it would fix the issue of me not getting past first level where you gotta hack the computer to open door...

LOL i really have bad luck. "
,Sleepmore,2013-03-14T22:56Z,"@sourov
No

Since the game is made for DX11, and DX11 is a HARDWARE issue, this means they would need to re-write pretty much the hole game engine (I think), in order for the game to work with DX10.

I bought a radeon 7750 2GB for about 90$. If you care about high grafic settings you can pay abit more for the 7770 1GB which most gamers say is way better. Ofcourse, if you are running a slow CPU like a P4 dual core 3.0GHZ you might want to upgrade your CPU/mobo/mem before you spend anymore cash on a good grafic-card, else this will bottleneck you instead."
,ashishrane,2013-03-17T07:30Z,After installing this patch my game wont open only.  I had to reinstall the game again to work. So please think twice before downloading this. It turns out that the game will open but nothing happens. It does not run.
,sixor,2013-03-22T05:43Z,working perfect 
,sixor,2013-03-22T05:44Z,"installed crysis3, installed this update, cracked ready to play on win8

,nurise,2013-03-24T13:02Z,Windows Defender says CryEA.dll is malware.
,TheRealGhostwish,2013-04-09T21:04Z,"So this got me into the second mission, but I've hit a problem. There's no ammo for the bolt rifle, which by watching a few youtube videos, I've seen is supposed to come fully loaded. Ideas?"
,TheRealGhostwish,2013-04-09T22:19Z,"I kinda wish you could edit comments.. anyway, if you run into the same problem as me above? Restart the level. Your save is still on the old version. Thank EA for that load of butt."
