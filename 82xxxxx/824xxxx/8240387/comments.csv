,Shadow416,2013-03-14T21:36Z,"uh...my game doesn't even open now :( I know i don't have previous update, and the note says I dont need it. 

i double click app and it just claims its going to run but nothing comes up doesn't even freeze lol

i double clicked update it extracted files to the directory of the game, so i copied over the crack to bin32, but nothing :(

any suggestions?"
,Shadow416,2013-03-14T21:37Z,"oh and to be specific i guess, the only other thing i downloaded besides the game is the crackfix that scene posted a while back though i don't see how that would cause problems.


I couldn't get passed first level, security door hack wouldn't open."

Patch works fine, it fixed the issue for me of invincible last boss (arms wouldn't open).

 Just make sure, you don't forget to change directory where the game is actually installed. And you shouldn't have problems.

I used it with nosTEAM's release.FYI."
