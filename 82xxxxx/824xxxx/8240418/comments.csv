you'd think that Eng would be a popular subtitles choice since it's the number one international language of the world.
too bad you can't even add the subtitles to this since the movie is a 19gb ssif format file. trying to manually add the eng subtitles to the movie in VLC doesn't work either it just freezes the fucking movie.
I know I should be grateful for downloading this right? wrong. who wants to watch a movie that speaks in a foreign language with no possibility of adding subtitles? fucking waste of time."
