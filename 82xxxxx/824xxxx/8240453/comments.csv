First love your work.

Regarding TeamViewer: The TeamViewer servers monitor all the remotes one connects to via the computers Mac address. If one makes what they consider too many connections to too many different computers, the dreaded ""Commercial Use Suspected"" scenario pops up.

So, while your TeamViewer One-Click indeed opens, many people are going to get, or eventually get, the ""Commercial Use Suspected"" situation.

I did indeed using yours.

No one has yet to come up with a way to crack TeamViewer for someone who wants to use it to connect to many different computers. And likely, a crack cannot be made since the connection has to go through TeamViewer's servers.

So folks, if you are just going to connect to a small amount of computers, and only those, using TeamViewer for free will be fine.

But if you want it for access and/or tech support to many different computers, TeamViewer will always eventually catch on and then hit you with ""Commercial Use Suspected."""
,AN0N_YM0US,2013-03-10T23:27Z,Everything seems to work fine. Only thing is the program takes you to the person who created the install package to their site to download more software when you install and uninstall the exe file. Not a big deal really. Other than that it's fully functional.
,oquatanginwann,2013-03-11T01:11Z,"Yes, every ""1-Click Run"" program The_Duck1 releases automatically opens up your browser and loads his site. And, I have found no way to turn that off. I presume it is a very small price to pay to get ""1-Click Run"" ""Registered"" programs that do not need to be installed, etc.

And again, to reiterate about TeamViewer: If it is freshly used on your computer, it works great.

But if you were using a version of TeamViewer that became suspected of commercial use, you will get that same error using The_Duck1's version. 

And if you use The_Duck1's (or anyone's) TeamViewer fresh--and of course it will work perfectly at first--to connect to many different computers, eventually TeamViewer corporate will catch on and then hit you with the Commercial Use Suspected crap.

They are logging (and counting) your connections via the computer's NIC MAC address."
