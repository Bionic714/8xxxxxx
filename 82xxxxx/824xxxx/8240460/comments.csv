,ZtorkX86,2013-03-11T05:49Z,"Oster@It's possible you might need a CD-key but you could always try a VPN in LAN mode, possibly with illegitmate keys from a key generator released around the time the NWN2 was released for the first time."
,Xigor,2013-03-11T06:11Z,Is there a mod to make it so that the armor look cool?

,brewen,2013-03-15T19:12Z,says invalid key when i try multiplay and i need to use the key generator under the start menu??
,brewen,2013-03-15T19:18Z,your individual serial key is not assigned to your game. Please use the multiplayer key changer found under the start menu??
