Even if you are not blessed with a large garden, growing tomatoes in containers or small spaces means that you are still able to enjoy the crisp sweet taste of home-grown tomatoes. In fact even with basic DIY skills you can either build your own tomato containers, or modify other existing containers to suit tomato growing ambitions.
The fact is though that all kinds of plants can be grown in small spaces or containers, tomatoes being the one highlighted in this work. Home grown tomatoes are a world away from the ones available in the supermarkets today, in both appearance and flavour. The watery bland tomatoes that are often on offer in the store, just cannot compare with the crisp firm juiciness of a fresh tomato plucked straight from the vine.
Do you have the space for a plant pot, and a nice sunny space to put it in? If so, then you too can grow your own tomatoes!
