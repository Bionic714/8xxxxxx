A woman and two men wander into a heavily wooded forest and spend the day and night exploring the surroundings. As they walk among the trees, the hills, and the streams, their exposure to the unspoiled beauties of nature, both inviting and forbidding, brings out a new side in the three friends, and they explore sexual and emotional sides of their relationships they never acknowledged before.
Visually striking and employing very little dialogue, Mesa Sto Dasos was shot using consumer-grade equipment - a still camera on movie capture setting and a laptop computer to record audio - and the limitations of the gear add to the film's unique look, with richly saturated color and a visual grain not unlike small-gage film.
