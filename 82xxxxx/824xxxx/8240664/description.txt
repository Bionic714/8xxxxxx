SkyriMerlin 1.6



...::: Description :::...

Based on Personalized Music by No_Aardvarks_Allowed (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/13286),
this mod adds some music from the soundtrack of the BBC Merlin series to Skyrim.
The songs have been manually sorted to appear in appropriate locations and situations and
edited for the sake of smooth integration into the game's original soundtrack.
The mod includes 65+ new tracks as of version 1.6. Future updates will include more songs.


New music has been added for the following:

-Dungeons (different songs depending on dungeon type)
-Battles
-Dragon battles
-Towns
-Taverns
-Castles (Dragonsreach, etc.)
-Skyrim worldspace (different songs according to the time of day)


By default, the new songs can be heard together with the game's original score, but you may
also choose to install the replacer version, included in the files. Read the installation
instructions for more info.


An optional replacement for the menu music and several accompanying menu backgrounds have
also been added. Please be aware that the backgrounds work on WIDESCREEN ONLY - unfortunately, 
the menu of Skyrim is built in such a way that our custom backgrounds do not display properly 
in non-widescreen mode.
