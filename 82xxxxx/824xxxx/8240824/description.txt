.: Plot :.
Top Gear is the best car show in Britain and is currently presented by Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May, with special appearances from the tame racing driver, The Stig.

The boys talk about anything from new cars to their engines, but don't be fooled, this is not another boring technical car programme. The boys have races and do crazy things with cars (anything from driving them into swimming pools to setting them on fire). Oh and there is always an earnest attempt to kill Richard Hammond every series...
