,jeff44135,2013-03-11T07:13Z,"audio is about .1 second off, and cuts out for the last 15 secs or so... not a perfect job, sorry eztv"

,amabubesi,2013-03-11T17:01Z,"Thanks EZTV!
But dl speed is terrible. 9 hours, 66% done, on a 10 meg line. "
,somebody_is_bored,2013-03-11T20:13Z,Great episode. Best thing are the credits at the end. I literally burst out laughing!
,amabubesi,2013-03-11T20:56Z,"Update: 13 hours, 81%. Zero dark thirty took 20 minutes... It's the government. We're obviously not allowed to watch TG because of stuff. Conspiracy's abound."
,ebud,2013-03-18T06:16Z,"T.Y. EZTV!
A: 6
V: 9
I wish for better audio for next season. ;)

And, aw, i miss the old days when they made 9 to 10 episodes per season... I'm guessing supercar business is not too well."
,ebud,2013-03-18T06:22Z,or maybe a big chunk of the budget went to Mexico and its consulate rep in London... XD
