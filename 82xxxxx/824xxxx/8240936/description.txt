### Story Line ###

In 1959, Alfred Hitchcock and his wife, Alma, are at the top of their creative game 
as filmmakers amid disquieting insinuations about it being time to retire. To recapture 
his youth's artistic daring, Alfred decides his next film will adapt the lurid horror 
novel, Psycho, over everyone's misgivings. Unfortunately, as Alfred self-finances and 
labors on this film, Alma finally loses patience with his roving eye and controlling 
habits with his actresses. When an ambitious friend lures her to collaborate on a work 
of their own, the resulting marital tension colors Alfred's work even as the novel's 
nspiration haunts his dreams.
