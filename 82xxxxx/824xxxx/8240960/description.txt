Gustav Mahler is best known as a Conductor (in his time) and composer of

immense symphonies and lieder (in our time.)



I've extracted these two esoteric Mahler compositions from a "complete works"

upload elsewhere.  Thankyou anonymous uploader for brightening my life!



Track #1 is wonderfully DARK/Minor





1) Piano Quartet  (Kremer,Hagen,Hagen,Maisenberg)  DGG 2010 compilation



2) Interlude from Comic Opera THE 3 PINTOS (Carlo Maria Von Weber)





Track 2 requires elaboration....Mahler was recruited by a descendant of 

Carlo Maria Von Weber to realize an incomplete work of their ancestor;

a comic opera: THE THREE PINTOS

A young Gustav Mahler had to break an enigmatic code to do the work.

Track #2 is the interlude music between acts #1 and #2...It is ALL Mahler

however he certainly tried to fit the style of the greater work for 

continuity's sake.
