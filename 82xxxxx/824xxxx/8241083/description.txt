* Sleep Cycle monitors your movement during sleep using the extremely sensitive accelerometer in your iPhone.

As you sleep you go through different phases, ranging from deep sleep to light sleep. The phase you are in when your alarm goes off is critical for how tired you will feel when you wake up. 

Since you move differently in bed during the different phases, Sleep Cycle can use the accelerometer in your iPhone to monitor your movement and determine which sleep phase you are in. 

Sleep Cycle wakes you when you are in your lightest sleep phase. 

Sleep Cycle was developed using proven sleep science and years of research and development.
