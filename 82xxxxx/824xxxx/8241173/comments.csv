,azulmarino,2013-03-30T21:00Z,How can I copy nomod scripts inside objects with this? Is there a user manual somewhere? Thanks
,ozc,2013-05-28T03:25Z,Scripts are ran server side and cannot be copied if they're NoMod. Some things like particles actively emitting can be copied but just the particle part.
