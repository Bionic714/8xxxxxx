I was watching the Jimmy Fallon Shows, and he collaborated three times with Justin Timberlake to make a three part series on the History Of Rap, where they mixed the most known and groundbreaking songs from the genre. I decided to collect them all (from various sources), add artwork, edit the release year, artist, album, boa boa boa everything properly, so I could share it with anyone! Great for DJs, fans, and anyone, really! Most of these are 192kbps mp3 files.

Anyway, heres the list of all the songs, enjoy and don't forget to seed!
