,GroovyJT,2013-03-11T16:08Z,"sorry, download still messed up...0 ks - 3 ks"
,LochDhueDude,2013-03-11T18:36Z,"A one off post that isn't being seeded properly?

Looks like a scam and maybe pista8 is an accessory..."
,sebolito,2013-03-12T17:59Z,dont understand why they are doing this...
,scooterhans,2013-03-13T14:37Z,Please seed it ... 
,scooterhans,2013-03-13T14:48Z,"Why do it says 0 seeders here, in my torrent it tells me there is 55-56 seeders.... but it still have no connections to the seeders and only download eith 0-0.3kb/s"
,scooterhans,2013-03-14T09:41Z,PM to onryou74: Why the hell are you putting this one online; when you doesn't seed? Are you freaking shithead? I'm out of here
,LochDhueDude,2013-03-21T05:15Z,"I retract my earlier, hasty statement! There is only one real seed and that is onryou74. Onryou74 either enjoys being ornery and wants to make sure all of the hit and runners are frustrated and all the leeches seed (my ratio is 3.74, currently) or onryou74 is an industry hack trying to bust pirates. I'm going to bet on the first premise, but I only p2p with encrypted peers making it hard to uild any case...

Thanks onryou74"
,LochDhueDude,2013-03-21T05:16Z,"build, not uild"
,rshame,2013-04-16T19:57Z,"Don't get it. It's been 2+ days downloading but it is stuck on 50.59% since the first half hour. I kept the computer running all this time but at no avail. Any help or suggestion, please? Thanks a lot!"
,Gypsiee,2013-04-19T02:20Z,Any Windows Cracks?
,74onryou,2013-05-03T23:40Z,"Could someone seed this please? I'm stuck at 65%, kinda lame. Thank you."
