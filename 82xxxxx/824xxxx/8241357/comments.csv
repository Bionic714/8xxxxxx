I know you're fishing for seeds, 
but this is NOT ENGLISH and is a .ts file

Spoken language(s): Russian


"
[V],Nepotu,2013-03-11T03:33Z,"I don't fish anything, man. It's simply an error. I mislabeled due the rush. You never wrong? And who are you to judge me? And, yes, it is a ts file. So what? You can see this with one click, before you having to DL.

Yes, people, this is in RUSSIAN (not english).

Sorry, guyz! 

Now I can go to fishing more seeders..."
,misteryleet,2013-03-11T04:19Z,"I apologize Nep. It was never my intention to call you out on such moot topics as wrong labeling.

I admit I am a rabid soccer fan and was disappointed I didn't get a english language file as the first torrent.

Again, I am sorry. I have relied on your participation in the past and will continue to support you.

You are absolutely correct in calling me out on my digression from the main and valid point of your constant valor, and mutual allegiance in the cause of free information.

If I could retract my comment I would. I stand corrected."
,ceyfin9,2013-03-11T06:58Z,"thank you Neo dont know how or y u keep doing it but i love u 4 it! Especially the HD Real Madrid games!!!2 die 4

just a quick question...
I can only play the ts files on windows media player (when using vlc/wmpc i cant get rid of the interlacing) but there is no audio whilst the video is perfect. Do u have any tips??

Thanks again, Dani."
[V],Nepotu,2013-03-11T10:40Z,"@misteryleet: Apology accepted. This is a real quality of a man, to apologize when he is wrong. We, all, wrong. Also, I apologize because I was pissed off by your remark that I was fishing for seeds (not because you prompted me that I labeled wrong the spoken language - your very correct remark). And thank you for your nice thoughts. We still friends, and, in the future, when you'll see any error in my posts, please, correct me! Peace, buddy!
@ceyfin9: I really don't have any tip for this, because I don't have the file to try some troubleshooting.
@Anyone else, could you help?"
