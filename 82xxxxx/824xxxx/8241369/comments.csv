Thanks!"
,yaysd,2013-03-11T01:41Z,"thanks for the upload, 
im really sad to see this show end , i really really liked it .

hope this episode will explain things and leave me with good feeling"
,Tylersays,2013-03-11T16:34Z,Being Human is over....and I do mean over - the U.S. version sucks zombie balls!
,hick9,2013-03-11T20:41Z,"The bad part is it's over and they kept it for this one last season. The worst part is they killed ""The Fades"" which was a better show, after one season ....just to keep this for one more season?"

BH fucked up when they killed off all the original characters and failed to replace them with equally compelling characters. 
The Fades was OK, but it was no BH, IMO."
