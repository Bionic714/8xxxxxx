,ghdsd,2013-03-12T00:07Z,WINGZZZZ!!!  Thanks so much.  Perhaps you read the dog next door is missing .. and I'm on house arrest.  So I'm so glad you are back!  I was so bored without you I started to download and watch Wheel of Fortune and subscribed to the National Enquirer. {shudder}
,Nimh,2013-03-12T07:42Z,"Hi ghdsd,  i have 3 pitbbulls (they dont bite) and im kinda short with cash right now.  

Can i move in with you and borrow $3000?  I'll pay you back the loan & rent , i promise."
,ghdsd,2013-03-14T01:07Z,"Hi Back NimH - sure .... as in Price is Right .. ""Come on down!""  I trust you to pay back the loan too, you have a nice font.  I don't care if your dogs bite, only barking INCESSANTLY right out side of my window bothers me.... like that sweet doggie that used to live right next door to me.  I hope you will enjoy Wyoming!"
