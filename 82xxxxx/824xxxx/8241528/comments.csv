,Calel1234,2013-03-11T06:52Z,Which pages are missing? I read the entire thing and didn't notice.  -_-
,muckymucks,2013-03-11T08:51Z,"Very considerate, STFmaryville. I don't check out those large torrents and miss stuff like this. Thanks for the up!"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-11T10:50Z,"Cale 1234, i dunno what that says about willingham's plot, 'cause it's pretty bad that you didn't notice pages of story missing! i actually deleted the older version, but it had about 25 out of a stretch of about 30 pages missing -- i think it was right in the middle of the book."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-11T10:52Z,"muckymucks, i randomly stumbled upon it when i was looking for a missing issue of justice league beyond. and this was in the same 0-day torrent."
,Calel1234,2013-03-11T12:14Z,"STF, I just checked out the comic and the missing pages were with Bigby and the girl. I assumed they had sex because that's what it alluded to, but it turns out there was a deal being had. The thing about a lot of these ""adult"" comics is that they include tons of gratuitous sex. It often doesn't further the plot and thought this was another instance. I'm not familiar with the Fables comics, but this looked like a decent standalone, so I checked this one out. Anyways, thanks for the upload. Now I at least know what really went on.  :P"
,Calel1234,2013-03-11T12:18Z,"Also found it weird that they never explained how he was actually alive and a werewolf. But once again, I just ignored it and kept reading. It was engaging enough that I didn't stop to question. "
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-11T17:32Z,"hey i'm glad to hear you liked it, and yeah that makes a lot of sense (thinking it was a cutaway for a sex scene)! hope you didn't take it the wrong way, i was being snarky about willingham's writing and not about you.  :-)

personally i have only read the first storyline of the main fables series, and part of the 2nd (""animal farm""). i have a long, long way to go before i read this one!"
,Calel1234,2013-03-11T22:30Z,"I've never read any of the Fables comics, but I think it's perfectly understandable and fine as a standalone. I'm sure knowing the other stories from Fables would help, but if you don't mind, I think it's quite fine without. "
,Hamster-X,2013-03-12T00:40Z,"Ooh, thanks for the fix STF! I haven't read it yet, so good to know it wasn't complete."
