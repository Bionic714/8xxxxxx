,kefskefs,2013-03-12T07:36Z,"mr2wingz.. you had virtually fully restored my faith with regard to my hopes of one day cancelling my horribly expensive and cable subscription... but alas, i cant cancel. i keep her connected for 3 things.. judge judy, jeopardy, and the people's court..  torrents of these shows are hard to find, and youtube uploads are usually not full episodes.... so when i found you a few weeks ago, i instantly added you to my bookmarks bar, and have since downloaded most of your submissions. but when you disappeared recently, i fretted. i fretted bad. i thought maybe something had happened to you.. my mind raced with all of the possibilities that led to your demise...... i thought maybe you found yourself in front of marilyn milian battling for your right to submit her videos for the masses.. or worse.. maybe you were sitting in stamford, ct on the set of maury waiting to hear the results of a paternity test. i was genuinely worried. but none of that matters anymore.. you're back, and i'm happy again. so, please, don't ever leave.. and please, continue post your magnificent quality trash tv torrents.. it's the only reason i come home from work every day.. not really, but it makes it so much better.. sincerely, thx."
