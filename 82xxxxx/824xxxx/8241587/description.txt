	Glitter (2001)
	with Mike Nelson and Mary Jo Pehl

	Video: Matroska H264 576x240
	
	(best I could find without wading through a landfill for a DVD copy;
	this is a Divx rip I got via ed2K(!) and converted. The very end of
	the credits are missing.)
	
	Audio: 1 Stereo AAC track ducked and with DisembAudio cues removed.


	If you enjoy this Rifftrax and don't already own it, please
