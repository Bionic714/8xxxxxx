Robot 13 - Collossus #2 / #3 [Blacklist]

It was the most unusual catch the fisherman had ever seen: a robotic creation with a skull for a head! ROBOT 13 has no idea what or who it is, nor where it came from. All it knows is that it has an instinctual and irresistible drive to protect mankind from mythological creatures of destruction. In this pulse pounding debut issue, you will witness this unlikely heros dredging from the ocean depths, and its life or death battle with a terrifying Kraken! Robot 13 does all he can to protect those who have discovered him, in the hope that in the process, he will discover who ... and why ... he is. It is only the beginning of this epic heros journey...
