,srnm123,2013-03-14T08:19Z,"ok, when all the obvious bad guys are barely getting away and the cbi people yell stop while pointing their guns... why never shoot the leg or the tire and save themselves footwork? Witty remarks appreciated"

Plus, ironically enough even though it is american TV, they don't feel their target audience wants to see real violence.  It's not supposed to be realistic it's supposed to be entertaining. 

 In real life if a small group of people with minimal combat training and no body armor went after deadly killers every week, they'd be killed too often and the cast would have to keep changing."
