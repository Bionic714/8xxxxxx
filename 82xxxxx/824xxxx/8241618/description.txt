"Call Girl"

When the Griffins find themselves in a 
financial bind, Lois is forced to find a 
job of her own. She gets discovered by a 
"voiceover" talent agent named Randy, who 
actually runs an adult-only phone line and 
pays his employees generously. As Lois 
settles into her new gig, she hears 
Peter's voice on the other end of the 
line.
