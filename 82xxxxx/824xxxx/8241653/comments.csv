Shut the fuck up, you stupid piece of shit. 

99,9% of the people do not believe in a 'god'. Only a stupid fool would believe in those crazy stories. You need to get informed!

,folderol1,2013-03-11T23:33Z,"Gentlemen, such hostility.  @EliteBeast thank you for the heads up.  I am that person (not atheist, but definitely not part of the Big 3).  @mikeike65 troll or just white trash?  Lose the vulgarity.  @Ignota did the troll touch a nerve?  Do you think that is what he wants to do.  Read it for what it is worth and move on, or are you a troll/white trash idiot too?   Don't bother answering, do you really think I'll come back here to read a response?  These are giggles all around for those that come after.  

Finally, to the eztv team, THANKS!!!!  Quality as usual."

,Phrasing,2013-03-12T15:43Z,A belief in a supernatural power is irrational and sadly an affliction that affects most of the population on the globe. But here's hoping for change!

,deathtoallorangatans2,2013-03-19T02:09Z,"I don’t believe in atheists.
Indeed, anyone with an IQ is not an atheist. All atheists are actually agnostics. This is because––setting aside faith for now––God hasn’t been proven or disproven.
There’s always room for God to prove his existence––He could come down from the clouds and announce himself in a reverberating voice––although even then there would be skeptics, especially in this technological day and age. But it’s just downright impossible to disprove his existence. That’s because this logic applies to anything: Anything is possible, therefore nothing is impossible––Anything can be proven, therefore nothing can be disproven.
I’ve just started what’s probably my #1 most favorite reasoning: that which I simply call ‘the Gamble’, or ‘the Risk.’
Similar points to this have been made by others before, such as in Pascal’s Wager, but I’ll describe it my way:
Simply speaking, to live as if the Catholic God doesn’t exist is the biggest, biggest gamble a person can possibly make in their entire life. It’s riskier than going to Vegas with your entire life savings. Because this gamble doesn’t risk your life savings: It risks the immortal soul that may exist inside of you.
Thereby, to live as if the Catholic God does not exist affords one absolute freedom to do as one pleases in this life, unrestrained by notions of right and wrong outside of those designed to suit oneself. If the Catholic God does indeed end up not existing, as demonstrated by that individual’s afterlife experience or lack thereof, then that person was able to enjoy a life without rules––albeit for only as long as one natural human lifespan. If, on the other hand, the Catholic God does end up existing, as demonstrated by the initiation of a state of torture suffered by that person in a negative afterlife, that person has just lost the Gamble. The hefty price of the loss: eternal torture.
On the other hand, to live as if the Catholic God does exist means remaining steadfast in avoiding any of the mortal sins according to Catholicism. If the Catholic God ends up not existing, as demonstrated by that individual’s afterlife experience or lack thereof, then that person was unable to do some activities desired during their natural human lifespan, for no lasting good aside from possibly leaving the world a better place. If, on the other hand, the Catholic God does indeed end up existing, as demonstrated by the initiation of a blissful life enjoyed by that person in a positive afterlife, that person has just reaped the ultimate reward afforded by the Catholic God: eternal bliss.
Nothing that we as human beings can do, say, or think, can change or even affect the probability of the Catholic God’s existence. God is or God isn’t. No human being decides it.
Claiming “I don’t believe in God” has just as much effect as claiming “I believe in God”: that is, no effect, aside from one’s own possible witness to others. Faith, and therefore lack of faith, is not something demonstrated by claims of mind or tongue. It is demonstrated solely by concrete action and inaction.
We are all of us free. We live with freedom. Free will. Free will isn’t only an aspect of being human. It is humanity. Free will makes us who we are––what we are. And it alone decides our fate, here, and, infinitely more importantly according to the Catholic God, in an afterlife. Free will is so important that, if we didn’t have it, none of this would matter. It would be unnecessary. All of this matters because we have free will. Because of the fact that we do have free will, free will not only matters: it decides everything. Both in this life, and in any possible afterlife.
Nothing that any of us say or do or think can or will influence the outcome, whatever it may be: God or no God, Catholic God or non-Catholic God. We have only to decide with our action and inaction––what we choose to do and not do––whether or not we’ll be counted amongst those who live free of the Catholic God’s will, at the risk of eternal to"
,deathtoallorangatans2,2013-03-19T02:10Z,"eternal torture, or amongst those who live according to the Catholic God’s will, with the hope of eternal bliss. You can do nothing but choose to either live the easy path with risk or live the tougher path with hope.
Pay close attention to this next statement, because it’s extremely important. It’s so important because the following statement blows atheism out of the water as if it’s nothing, and yet it’s completely true:
“It’s a fact… that God might exist.”
That may look like it isn’t saying much of anything. But, to the true atheist, it screams in deaf ears. This is exactly why I don’t believe in atheists: All ‘atheists’ are actually agnostics in denial. For them to suggest otherwise would be to paint a red and white target on themselves for anyone who understands this extremely simple concept to spell out to them.
Indeed, what real ‘atheism’ actually amounts to in practice is a person who refuses to believe that God exists, based on their own logic, which always must be mixed with denial of the real consequences of failure: no ‘practicing nonbeliever’ ever actually admits to the chance of eternal torture. But this is the fear that you are called to face head-on. For many a nonbeliever and false believer, this fear stands between themselves and truth.
To such people, the Gamble still applies as it applies to everyone. No one has immunity to the possibility that God exists, and no mortal sinner is immune to the Gamble. We’re all in the same human boat here. None of us has an elixir of natural immortality. And if we ever invent one, God can still and eventually would take the effects away, ensuring us all a place in the seat of personal judgment.
We can’t hope to change the outcome or even to affect it. The probability, for all intents and purposes, is like that of a true agnostic’s: 50/50. Whether you define yourself as an atheist, a no-religion, a Catholic, or anything otherwise, that probability, discounting for now the eyes of faith, remains the same. We can’t influence it. We can only decide for ourselves which life we’ll live.
In this case, ‘playing it safe’ isn’t the coward’s way. In fact, doing whatever you want to do is cowardly, like a baby suckling on pleasure. With all things considered, choosing to mortally sin is easy and enjoyable, yes, but also brave, because it’s also foolish. I call mortal sinners brave because I would not want to be doing what they’re doing, to be in their shoes at the point of death!
Will you commit mortal sin and be subject to the Gamble, or will you play it safe? This is the one thing in life––indeed it can even be the only thing in life––that you want to play safe. Take your risks elsewhere."
,ChrisTaro,2013-03-21T06:09Z,"It's also impossible to prove his existence but there is more evidence supporting his non-existence. You wasted so much time typing that... what an idiot. Religious fanatics, ruining the potential for the human race. "
,ChrisTaro,2013-03-21T06:12Z,"Catholics are only good for 1 thing, raping little boys! Damn good at it too I guess huh?"
,ChrisTaro,2013-03-21T06:19Z,"Catholics are good for only 1 thing, raping children. The rest of religion is good for 1 thing as well, lies. Don't fear death, our cells will turn back into atoms and be scattered to form new things, or maybe to become a piece of something older, there is no god. There is no evidence to support such existing, and no evidence against it. Sadly though all religious work is simply man-made, nothing divine going on there. Even those who write of Jesus never even met him, lol, people are so afraid of death they've created a believe that has kept the human race from truly progressing. Religious figures are the most corrupt and despicable characters I encounter. I spit upon any man of faith I encounter, especially priests of the catholic faith, disgusting wastes of human matter they are. They use children, innocent children, how horrible."
