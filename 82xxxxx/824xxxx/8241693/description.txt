  With the illuminated big head and all, Canadian producer Joel ZimmermanΓÇÖs Deadmau5 alias is a blast to see live, but you can also bring quite a bit of that tech-house-meets-slamminΓÇÖ-electro excitement home with 4 x 4 = 12. As bad as the masked one is at math, he's conversely just as good at making you dance, as this unmixed but almost non-stop set of big room tunes throbs and snaps with that Daft Punk sense of style. Rabid fans should be warned, though, that theyΓÇÖve already heard the big highlights, as tracks like ΓÇ£Some Chords,ΓÇ¥ ΓÇ£Sofi Needs a Ladder,ΓÇ¥ the wicked ΓÇ£Animal Rights,ΓÇ¥ and others had been previously released on 12ΓÇ¥s, but the remaining cuts are hardly filler. Unheard numbers such as the creepy ΓÇ£Cthulhu SleepsΓÇ¥ and the Wendy Carlos-like ΓÇ£Right This SecondΓÇ¥ help to turn a club-oriented set of tunes into a well-rounded album, and when the one-two punch of ΓÇ£Raise Your WeaponΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£One Trick PonyΓÇ¥ introduce the Mau5ΓÇÖs newfound love of dubstep, youΓÇÖve got just enough variety. Miss Sofi (Sofia Toufa) and Greta Svabo Bech contribute vocals, while producers Wolfgang Gartner and Michael Woods skillfully help with the knob twiddling.
