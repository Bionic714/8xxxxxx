Series finale! He pulls a knife, she pulls a gun. He sends one of hers to the hospital, she sends one of his to the morgue-- THAT'S the Hit-Girl way. Mindy's had it up to HERE with that thing called "restraint" and pays the mafia a long-overdue visit. Also: Red Mist faces his final super-villain training test.
