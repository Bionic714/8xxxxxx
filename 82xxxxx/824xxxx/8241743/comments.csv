,aarque,2013-03-11T16:08Z,"Geez you guys, the full 767 is all over the internet, it's not here? I know for a fact that I have the KC-767 and the UPS freight livery active, so I'm pretty sure I have the whole package, guess I will run a search and if it's not here, I will share it in a few days. I just took for granted that everyone had it by now."

Can anyone tell me why the Captain sim 767-300 isn't stable when the Auto flight system in engaged.
I bought a copy along with the 737-200 Classic and the 777-200 1.0;I already have the boxed verion of the 757-200 and they are all stable except the 767.
Does anyone share this experience with me."
