,Spyder110,2013-03-11T03:29Z,Hey why no seeds???
,eyonoria,2013-03-11T03:37Z,Cause it been up for 10 minutes ?
,mattman21,2013-03-11T03:40Z,"because it was just uploaded, there are plenty now."
,peri-lives,2013-03-11T03:51Z,Is this real? I thought the episode hadn't finished airing yet.
,moth1334,2013-03-11T03:53Z,"it's got seeds, it just doesn't list them for some reason."
,tflagger997,2013-03-11T03:54Z,That is just TPB's system.  Currently (20 min after this was posted) there are 4.4K Seeds and 16K Leechers.
,kellz0r,2013-03-11T03:55Z,"It just fuckin uploaded, it shows no seeds because the tracker hasn't updated yet. it likely has a hundred seeders already lol."
,Nimh,2013-03-11T05:02Z,"This so is so crap yet i can't stop watching. I like post apocalyptic themed scenarios but goddamn, lets lower Glen down a well. 

Rick's useless leadership over this ragtag bunch of morons is second to none.  Fuck them, they should all die and the show start afresh by following Cutty's group."
,imbolthead,2013-03-11T05:16Z,"Ty eztv...I love living on the West Coast, you guys get all this before us but i'll get to see it earlier than it should air here!! Sweet, ty again"
,Toby196,2013-03-11T06:02Z,"Thank you, eztv."

,Suck_It,2013-03-11T18:02Z,"This is odd, I've got an insanely slow download speed on this but eztv is normally the best. What's up? Does this have something to do with the dickhead ettv thing? (they want you to fill out forms or some shit so you can watch things)"
,ziuber18,2013-03-11T18:33Z,thanks eztv and thanks for the subs

Its a graphic novel so I am not sure that they can deviate from the path set down in the comic. Agreed, Rick is a bit shit though as a leader, although I think the idea is that he is carrying the weight of the zombie-apocalypse on his shoulders. 

The comic doesn't have as much talkie-talkie in it, less drama more zombie action.

EZTV always solid uploads!"
