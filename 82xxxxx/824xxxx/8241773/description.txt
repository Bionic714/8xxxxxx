This was originally Created by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby, but many other artists and writers worked on the various incarnations of this character, including my Favorite, Steve Ditko!

For me, the best incarnation of the character was the impulse version.

I posted this because DC is supposed to bring all the impact characters back, and I also just love heroes based off of bugs!
