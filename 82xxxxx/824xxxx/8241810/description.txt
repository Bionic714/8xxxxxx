On this live Sunday edition, Alex returns from a week of vacation with a lot on his mind, including the huge signs of awakening happening in this country, with Sen. Rand Paul making a bold move this week in filibustering Brennan's nomination and objecting to extrajudicial drones now threatening American lives and liberties. 

Meanwhile Afghan President Karzai's latest comments are further admission that the U.S. is sponsoring terrorism, including groups like the Taliban, to justify it's continued occupations at home and abroad. 

Incredible attacks on the 2nd Amendment are underway, with states now passing draconian legislation restricting firearms, while a new patsy is being crafted to blame the liberty movement for new terror attacks ahead of manufactured financial collapse and social unrest.
