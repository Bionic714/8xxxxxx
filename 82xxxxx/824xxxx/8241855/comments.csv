,ThePranger,2013-03-11T14:30Z,"hype7 - No, it didn't air last week - it first aired last night (Mar 10th).  History Channel is airing new episodes on Sunday (although the next episode can be watched on their website).

My DVR recorded it yesterday as a new episode and both the History Channel site http://www.history.com/shows/vikings/episodes and TVRage list it as the 10th.

Not sure where you got your info from...  "
