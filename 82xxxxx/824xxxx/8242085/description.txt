Captain Confederacy is an alternate history comic book by Will Shetterly and Vince Stone that was published between 1986 and 1992. It tells the story of a superhero created for propaganda purposes in a world in which the Confederate States of America won their independence.

The first storyline, published in twelve issues by SteelDragon Press, tells how the first Captain Confederacy, a white man, joins the rebellion against his country. The second storyline, published in four issues by Epic Comics, focuses on the struggle to control the politics of the North American countries, at a world super-hero conference in Free Louisiana. The new Captain Confederacy is a black woman, pregnant with the last Captain's baby.


This torrent contains the four-issue series done for epic Comics in 1991-92 and... AND the first twelve-issues published by SteelDragon Press. Cause I rock like dat.

Props to the creative teams and the scanners. Get it, seed it!
