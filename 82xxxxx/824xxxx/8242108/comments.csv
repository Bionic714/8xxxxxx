,jharbert78,2013-03-11T13:20Z,"thanks a lot. I live in the US and cant watch it anywhere, hooked on this show!"
,duckdown,2013-03-11T17:50Z,"2HD are a bunch of shit slackers.  Stupid wankers take forever to release the show, if they decide to do it at all. 

Thank you for upping this, gimpy!  "

duckdown - Settle down. It's not like you're paying 2HD for their work. 2HD release like 5-10 shows a day. Each one is a lot of work. How many shows do you do?  Looks like zero to me!

,duckdown,2013-03-12T01:21Z,"I capped for years, it's barely any work, and all modern groups use mergeboxes and segmenting now, it's more automated than ever before.  I used to have to cut my clips manually in VideoReDo or VirtualDubMod and then encode the whole show at once..  Now these guys are uploading and merging segments at a time using scripts and automating almost all of it.  

The point is, don't start a fucking show then cap 2 episodes and stop.  Then they go and do a random episode 4 and 5 with a lame ass apology in the NFO swearing it wont happen again, and look now.  They totally abanoned episode 6 again

2HD are just being a bunch of pre whoring douchebags trying to get their RLS count up in the db, picking and choosing shows at will"
