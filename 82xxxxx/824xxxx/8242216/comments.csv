Not a problem bro, in fact I will shift to another job and might hard to find time to upload torrents anymore. I hope you don't stop uploading NBA games as I don't know if I still can do it next month. But sure I'll do my best if I can..

Cheers bro and take care..."
[V],Nepotu,2013-03-12T02:05Z,"I'm happy for you, bro. I hope it will be better at your new job. I don't have one. We'll miss you, buddy. But if that will change and you'll comeback, please, let me know, and we'll share the ups. Or for anything else... I hope to talk from time to time. Cheers and take care, my friend! God bless you!"
