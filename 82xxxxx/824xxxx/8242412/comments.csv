,Bootsak47,2013-03-11T07:53Z,I will seed when I can..... I have 1.7mbs so If you have good inet and  need this game download and seed.....
,IndigoAK,2013-03-11T09:06Z,Is there a reason you decided to zip this and not even compress it?
,Bootsak47,2013-03-14T12:37Z,"First install reloaded mw3 in zip usingDaemon tools or something.....

Then copy contents of ""Mw3 update 1.4"" to Mw3 game folder....

Then copy contents of ""TeknoMW3"" to Mw3 game folder and create ""TeknoMW3.exe - Shortcut""

Then when you run you have the choice of singleplayer, online, settings,ect.... First run it will ask for player name.... enter what you want! And FOV.....65-90 I suggest 90!"
,Bootsak47,2013-03-14T13:04Z,And I tried to compress it but it stayed the same size.... I don't know why but maybe I'll have better luck on my next upload..... ;-)..
,Bootsak47,2013-03-18T08:18Z,"If you have problems unzipping, right sclick the .zip and uncheck readonly under properties..... Extract, change properties back to read only and SEED, PLEASE!!"
