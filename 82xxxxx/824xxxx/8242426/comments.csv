First of all thank you for the time and effort you spend on making torrents available to us. Great work.

There is just one thing that buggs me. In your file description you don't mention that the audio is AAC (wich they almost always are in all your torrents). This piece of information would have saved me a lot of downloading time since I can't use AAC. It will not decode to 5:1 and I really value the sound quality. 

Maybe others don't have a problem with this, then fine..!! But it would be a great thing to include the info in your file description

PS: Even better would be a DTS/AC3 solution if possible? Thanx again for your work though :-)"
