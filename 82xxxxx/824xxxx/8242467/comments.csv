First of all thank you for the time and effort you spend on making torrents available to us. Great work.

There is just one thing that buggs me. In your file description you don't mention that the audio is AAC (wich they almost always are in all your torrents). This piece of information would have saved me a lot of downloading time since I can't use AAC. It will not decode to 5:1 and I really value the sound quality. 

Maybe others don't have a problem with this, then fine..!! But it would be a great thing to include the info in your file description.

PS: Even better would be a DTS/AC3 solution if possible? Thanx again for your work though :-)"
,360_fanboy,2013-03-11T11:39Z,when will we have the 48 fps version?
,symon240776,2013-03-11T11:41Z,Thanks Yify! Legend!
,juampi_92,2013-03-11T15:54Z,"Hi YIFY, nice release.

I was wondering if it is too much trouble to get a wider version. Because this 3D version has the same wide as a FullHD movie, but the thing is that two images fit in one. So you loose image quality.

I'd be great if you could make a heavier version with wider resolution, so there's less loss of quality when the tv stretches the image.

Thanks a lot."

,RawBam,2013-03-13T08:39Z,@saadatkhan - You need a 3DTV (or monitor) and you need to turn on side by side 3D mode.
,ztnebi,2013-03-13T16:28Z,thanks
,dpsikolog,2013-03-13T18:31Z,Thanks a lot! 
[V],smbdownload,2013-03-13T20:03Z,"awesome up - thanks

and on another note - roherin...really nice comment - most people who have an issue or 'find fault' with uploads usually are not as appreciative for what is there but are just DEMANDING or being plain childish and rude when asking  for something more - I applaud you brother for your class- "
,michelledelis,2013-03-17T23:57Z,Just wandering why this happens because I am a new user to torrents. I downloaded this movie and it took a whole two days also when i played it it played showing a double image side by side so two screens next to one another. did i do something wrong
,3htthe,2013-03-19T00:01Z,"@michelledelis

It would be good if you read the TITLE of the torrent you're downloading. The two images are next to each other because that's how 3D works. I'm not exactly sure how people get it to work on home theaters, but if you don't intend on watching it in 3D I'd recommend getting a version that doesn't say 3D in it."
,amirrazorrr,2013-03-27T16:45Z,"i have a 3D screen laptop (VAIO) but when i play the movie with VLC player or windows media player it still splits the images into 2 side by side, how can i watch this with my 3D capable laptop?"
,seevee1969,2013-03-28T20:02Z,"Not sue if it's my LG TV but when the 3d function merges the images, the aspect ratio is a little off, making the actors seem tall & skinny (appears as 1.78:1 or 1920*1080 instead of 2.40:1).

,yleaturmom,2013-03-28T23:54Z,"Wow!  My first experience with a 3d torrent and it was a homerun.  How Yify can get this much 1080p 3d data down to under 3GB is beyond me, but it was phenomenal on our 40"" Samsung Smart TV.  Saved us over $50 from having to pony up to the theatres.  Tight Yif"
,yleaturmom,2013-03-28T23:59Z,"Also, if it would help anybody, we are networking the mp4 to our tv from either of two networked pc's using Windows Media Player on Win 7.  And if you have anything less than a 32"" display, the 3d effect won't be worth much, IMO."
,alangfp,2013-03-29T05:21Z,"People having trouble playing this 3D movie, PLEASE read it :

#1: The two sides of the 3D movie beeing ""stretched"" in one split screen still let the movie be completely watchable! (tested with many movies)

#2: Choose the side by side playback option as soon as in this case the 3D file was encoded with a side by side separation of both 3D images stretched in one! You must try L/R or R/L because your 3D video player may have different default settings.

#3: you have a 3D capable laptop/desktop monitor? make sure you have all the drivers up to date and is running the 3D player the manufacturer provided or recomends!
In my case I have a LG laptop with PASSIVE glasses! I personally like Power DVD 12 for 3D video playback! it's perfect and works like a charm for me! Also like Tridef btw!

#4 the movie isn't ""chopped"" or ""cropped""!! learn what aspect ratio means in the first place! Don't say stupid thing like: ""it's not 1080p"" wow.. do some google before you say things on the internet! geez..."
