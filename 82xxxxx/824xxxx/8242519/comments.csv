Besides if You have to install some ""special"" player to view it... it's usually some kind of scam/bullshit.

Tried Kmplayer (which i believe is also Korean product), and Media Classic Player... no dice."
,RafVne2,2013-03-16T02:56Z,"I was still curious, so instead of following the given link, I searched English version of the player, and guess what... it worked.

Player seems either be based on the KMplayer, or the other way around (they are very similar).
I don't know what codec it uses that the KMplayer couldn't play those files, but it does work so there you go... :)"
