,Mothra67,2013-03-11T22:48Z,"I have another obscure request:

back in the 70's and 80's Gold Key came out with UFO comics based on real sightings and abductions, they were even collected into Trade Paperbacks, similar to the ones they did for Star Trek.  any chance you canm find them and upload them to TPB?  I loved reading those as a kid"
,riverchase,2013-03-12T01:11Z,thanks for taking time out to upload these wonderful comics. I can't say thank you enough. 
,Bubbers83,2013-03-12T05:41Z,Any chance of a posting for each of the other series from this outing of Wildstorm?
,Bubbers83,2013-03-12T05:45Z,"Perhaps Number of the Beast, also?"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-12T16:13Z,"Mothra67, i've managed to d/l one solitary issue of UFO so far! i'll keep looking ...

Proteus11, riverchase, you're both welcome.

Bubbers83, i may get to all that eventually, but all of it's available right now if you search the MTCDC, such as http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/6666776/"
