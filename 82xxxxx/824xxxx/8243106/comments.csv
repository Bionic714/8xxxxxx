Uploader, please search before you upload (it takes five seconds) and if the file you have is already here and well seeded, do NOT upload your version. Duplicate files spread out the seeders and reduce download speeds for everyone. They also increase the clutter on this site."
,artie33,2013-03-20T06:50Z,can anyone advise what to do when after installation it requests a 25 character product key to activate online? thanks
,BongoNL,2013-03-24T13:05Z,thanks!
,cocknhens,2013-03-27T14:42Z,"This works perfectly.

Downloaded, opened, clicked install and it did it first time without the need for a serial.

It has now started to auto update from Microsoft as well.

Great job, well done."
,hunter852,2013-03-30T14:51Z,"If I update software from MS, will this still work properly?

Thanks "
