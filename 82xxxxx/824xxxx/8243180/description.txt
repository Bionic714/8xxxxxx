Secrets of the Stonehenge Skeletons
Stonehenge is Britain's greatest prehistoric monument and, for many centuries, has also provided perhaps our greatest prehistoric mystery. One man believes he has found the vital clues to solve this puzzle, and this programme follows him through a series of discoveries that rewrite the story of Stonehenge. Buried beneath the stones are ancient bodies, and a research team led by world-renowned archaeologist Professor Mike Parker Pearson has been granted special permission to analyse them for the first time. The results of that investigation overturn the accepted view on when Stonehenge was built and what it was built for, providing compelling evidence that it once united the people of Britain. The programme proves that the monument we know today was not the original Stonehenge and answers the mystery of its sudden decline.
