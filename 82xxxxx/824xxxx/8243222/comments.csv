The files are part of a spanned compressed file

If you uncompres the first file it will automatically do the rest and probably and create an iso or similar file.

If the files look like this

b-revopsON

you need to change your file setting to NOT hide extensions for known file types the compressed files should look like this

b-revopsON.r00
b-revopsON.r01

and so on ...
