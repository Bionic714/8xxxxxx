,Cantora69,2013-03-17T10:59Z,"Seriously, RJAA, if you're going to upload a torrent and do the whole thing in SPANISH...fucking say so. 

The good news is that it's just the installer and instructions that's in spanish. The game is in english, and you can choose the spanish language option in the menu if you do want it to be in spanish. 

Very self explanator installer, and for those with too few braincells to be able to do an install in spanish here it is:

mount DVD 1. Click on the self installer. Mount DVD 2 & 3 when asked. 

that's it. "
,Cantora69,2013-03-17T11:00Z,"also, rjaa, thanks for the great upload. just more info next time please! "

,yoyoballs,2013-04-11T07:24Z,im gettin an error with the dvd1 iso saying that the file is broken. anyone else had this? 
,yoyoballs,2013-04-13T03:12Z,"oh lol nvm, figured out the problem. but srsly, aint extractin by highlighting the whole thing the same shit as just extractin from da rar file?"
,JackSpencer,2013-04-17T19:48Z,"Works Fine for me. the only issue I had was ""Failed to initialize Direct3D with current settings"" which was easily fixed by unclicking the FULLSCREEN button.
 TONS of DLC pop  up when starting the game.
 Setup in Spanish but don't worry about it. Easy to figure out! Game is all English."
