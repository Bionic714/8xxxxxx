Features:

Smart / Resourceful Lara Lara must use her brawn and her brains to
overcome an impossible situation. The player must guide Lara through
physics puzzles, challenging environments, and a high-octane story to
overcome a harrowing situation and make it off of the island alive.

Combat - Tomb Raider is pushing the action genre forward with visceral
third-person combat and a deep weapon and gear upgrade system that Lara
will have to strategically employ to overcome increasingly difficult
enemies and environments, all with a unique Survival Action twist.

Dynamic Traversal it wouldnt be Tomb Raider without certain
signature elements. In addition to platforming, Lara will have to
explore large areas to earn experience points that will upgrade her
weapons and gear. One of the key elements of dynamic traversal is the
gear gating gameplay loop: over the course of the game, Lara will
continually improve her gear and will be able to reach previously
inaccessible locations that will allow her to upgrade her gear and
weapons even further.
