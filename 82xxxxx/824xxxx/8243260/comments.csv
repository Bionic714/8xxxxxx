I Cannot boot into win 8 at moment and cannot get into safe mode (you have to turn that on in command promt I found out but cannot get to it)

I am asking do you think this will work for my 'standard' win 8 edition to be able to boot off usb and then trouble shoot as websites show how from bootable usb of win 8  ??

Thanks for your time!"
