This Windows 8 64-bit PRO contains updates until January 5, 2013, and has composed defectoel. NET Framework 3.5 which saves the download.
Is multilingual, is installed by default in Spanish but if you want you can change it to English without downloading anything.
Windows Activation expire six months after you install it, but do not worry because when you activate expire for another 6 months so offline and fast (2 minutes approx.) And so on as many times as you want. If you leave an activator final download of the folder "Activadores_Windows_8" located by default in the Windows 8 desktop PRO.
Default is disabled automatic updates, so I recommend NOT activate.


I recommend you download it because it has a variety of programs [In a 2nd DVD], for its stability and for the time teahorra to install everything at once. Besides that have been added for possible installation programs commonly used by many users, and the start button [Changed Start8 to StartIsBack] which is installed in a totally unattended and vexatious Skip LID allows Windows Start , leaving escritorio.Los directly in programs that are installed by default with Windows are:
