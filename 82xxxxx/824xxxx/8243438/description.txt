What Are Binaural Beats?
------------------------------

Binaural beats affect our brainwaves directly and can alter moods, behavior, even consciousness. Playing tones with a slightly different frequency in each ear causes the brain to recalculate the frequency and to create a new frequency inside the brain, a frequency that doesn't actually exist outside of the brain. Binaural beats were first discovered over a hundred years ago. However, mainstream science took little interest in it until recently.

In the 70's researchers discovered an amazing phenomenon. When playing binaural beats, the brainwaves synchronize according to the frequency differences and move toward the new frequency. For instance, if we play a 230 Hz tone in the left ear and a 240 Hz tone in the right, the difference is 10 Hz. Thus our brainwaves will move toward the 10 Hz frequency. Brainwaves are categorized in five frequency types: delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma. Each type has different characteristics of mood, state of mind, behavior, and consciousness. By playing binaural beats, we can actually change our brainwaves to any state we desire. For instance, we can change an anxious personΓÇÖs brainwaves from the beta state to the alpha state, which is a relaxed state of mind.
