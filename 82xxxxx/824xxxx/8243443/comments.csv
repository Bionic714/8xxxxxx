I didn't DL the other 2 games as don't have time to watch them all at the moment. If that's where the ReadMe file is you're talking about.

Anyway, thanks again."

You might find it handy for next week. Enjoy the game EdoSensei m8 :)"

Ive stayed off the net this weekend as to not find out any of the scores. Cant wait to watch this one tonight. Thanks again mate :) "
