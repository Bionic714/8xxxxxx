SPORT: Six Nations Rugby Union - England v Italy
On: BBC 1 HD 
Date: Sunday 10th March 2013 
KO Time: 15:00

Stuart Lancaster's England host Italy as they continue their bid to become Six Nations champions. The Azzurri are traditionally seen as the weakest team in the competition, but proved with their opening-day defeat of France that they are no pushovers. Equally, the men in white will be determined not to rest on their laurels - especially given their superb recent displays against nations such as New Zealand and Ireland. When England went to Rome last year, they managed to eke out a narrow 19-15 win.
