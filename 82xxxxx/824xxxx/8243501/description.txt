How to play:
1) Burn disc images on CDs or mount them on a virtual drive;
2) Run Setup.exe on the first disc and install the game (but don't install QuickTime 4 when asked);
3) Run CK_Letterbox.exe to patch the game (fixes display issues);
4) Launch the game through its main executable or shortcuts with the first disc inserted (you will have to swap discs while playing).

! Notice
The game requires QuickTime to run and I suggest you use QuickTime Alternative instead of the old QuickTime version 4 which comes with the game. Run QuickTime_Alternative_322.exe to install it (you will have to uninstall other versions of QuickTime first). Newer versions of QuickTime might work, but I haven't tested it.

! Notice
The game ran fine for me on Windows 7 x64 with all the latest updates installed. I didn't have to use any special compatibility settings.

! Warning
There is a game-breaking bug which the developers of the game haven't fixed. When you encounter the error "cannot find file sunlight.tif", extract CK_Sunlight.zip to where you installed the game and overwrite the original file. This will advance your game to a state after the portion which doesn't work and you'll be able to continue playing.
