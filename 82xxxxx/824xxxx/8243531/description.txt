When Miami city officials call the sisters in for a meeting, Kim brings up her love of detective work, and next thing she knows, she's doing ride-alongs with cop cruisers! Kim's hobby goes even deeper when her friend Larsa recommends that she shadow a private eye. But this is more than just spying on cheating boyfriends, and Kim finds herself investigating a serious, life-threatening case! Meanwhile, when Scott's not tending to his own serious injury, he tries to encourage Kourtney to lose more baby weight. But will his comments be taken the wrong way and push Kourt to her breaking point?
