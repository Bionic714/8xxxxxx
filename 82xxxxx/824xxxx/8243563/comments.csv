,crapyro,2013-04-25T08:55Z,"Thanks. I admire your commitment to quality. That said, I personally wish there was a 720p rip of season 3, since IMHO the artwork in this show isn't quite good enough to warrant storing them in high bitrate 1080p. For this show, all 1080p seems to do is point out the flaws in the Flash animation. I'll probably downconvert them to 720p.

The 5.1 surround is excellent though.

Again, thanks, this show is excellent and under-appreciated... it's too bad it's apparently been cancelled..."
