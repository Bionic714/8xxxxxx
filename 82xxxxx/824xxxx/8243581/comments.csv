,grefranger,2013-03-11T18:35Z,"Dibya's 1080p web downloads are really good quality, thanks Dibya!"
,unodoughstres,2013-03-11T21:23Z,Seeeeed please. I will keep seeding all week. I wonder if 1080p is really worth it over 720...
,bcc123,2013-03-11T23:24Z,what is wrong with you people uploading the 2channel version instead of 5.1? stop doing this
,stibone,2013-03-12T05:01Z,wtf is with all these 2 channel Web-DLs? Pointless. Use the 5.1 track they come with! Why downmix. These AAC tracks are horrible. 
,byronbay,2013-03-13T14:02Z,Thanks but the quality isn't worth missing out on the 5.1 surround.. Why 2 channel!?
,bcc123,2013-03-15T06:06Z,"here's the 5.1channel audio version:

,M_Dudikoff,2013-03-20T23:46Z,stop whining.. fuckin nerds. LOVE YOUR WORK DIBYA..seriously tho
,ryan0991,2013-05-13T01:48Z,They're right. There is absolutely no reason to down-mix to two channel AAC. It's idiotic.
