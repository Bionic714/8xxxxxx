I'm one step from downloading this. i just wanna ask if the extras you put in this torrent is the same extras that's inside the The Bible series torrents?? Coz if it is, then i wont have to download them again. I'm kind of running out of my hard disc space so i need to cut off the unnecessary files. Please reply as soon as u can. I would really appreciate. Again, thank you for ur torrents. You deserve a green skull. God bless!"

I have been watching what you post with interest for a long time. I can see you are zealous for Jesus and I commend that. It seams like you desire to glorify God with all your torrents.
This particular ""prophet"" is teaching partial rapture theory, if I understand it correctly. It seems she is saying ALL post-tribers are lukewarm? or lovers of money? and that ALL post-tribers will miss the pre-trib rapture.
Did God really say that in the scripture? or did God say Christians will suffer persecution and tribulation?
We are speaking the words of Jesus when we say ""Christians will suffer persecution and tribulation."" In face Christians all over the world are facing these things NOW!
The real question is ""Does the apostle Paul teach a separate ""coming"" of Jesus for the Church, and another coming of Jesus for Judgement?""
Are you an impartial judge? and can you look at that question with a mind open to God's Spirit and God's Word? or has all the MAN MADE TRADITION blinded your eyes and deafened your ears? 
Be careful when you judge your brother and try to restore him, lest you fall into a snare!
Gal 6:1
Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted."
