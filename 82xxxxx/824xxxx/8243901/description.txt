El Concierto Acústico is the first live album by Puerto Rican rock band Fiel a la Vega, and their second album overall. The album was recorded at the Performing Arts Center in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico during the concerts the band held from July 19-21, 1997. It was released later that same year.

The album is composed of acoustic versions of songs from the band's debut album as well as cover songs of some of the artists that influenced them like Roy Brown, Silvio Rodríguez, Leon Gieco, and others. Brown himself made a guest appearance during his song "Boricua en la Luna". Other guest artists were Adean Cabán (son of Antonio Cabán Vale "El Topo") and Mike Villegas.
