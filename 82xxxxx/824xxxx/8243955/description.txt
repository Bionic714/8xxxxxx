Black Ops is a first-person shooter, retaining the same gameplay mechanics as previous Call of Duty titles. 
The player assumes the role of a foot soldier who can wield various firearms (only two of which can be carried at once), throw grenades and other explosives, and use other equipment as weapons. 
A player close enough to an enemy can kill with one knife blow. A character can take three stances: standing, crouching or prone. 
Each affects rate of movement, accuracy, and stealth. The player can drop to the prone stance from the standing stance while running, and can momentarily sprint before having to stop.
The online multiplayer mode of Black Ops usually revolves around two teams on a specific mission. 
For example in Team Deathmatch the team with the most kills wins, while in Capture the Flag, players take the other team's flags and return it to their own base. 
Additionally, there is Free For All in which players aren't separated into teams. Not including Downloadable maps, there are 14 different maps.
A zombie cooperation mode, titled "Zombies", is included in the game. Originally featured in World at War, it was revamped to be included in Black Ops. 
It is a four-player online and two-player split screen co-op mode (which can also be unlocked online).....
