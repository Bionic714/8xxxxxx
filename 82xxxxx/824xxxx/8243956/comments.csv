,epound,2013-03-16T15:34Z,Thank you (and for the other two as well).  I do hope Part II is coming?  (and Philosophical Fragments and Stages would also be wonderful).  
[T],penfag,2013-03-16T17:19Z,"@epound - Unfortunately, I haven't found copies of the other volumes in the ""Kierkegaard's Writings"" series and I've uploaded everything I have.  I was also left with that edge-of-your-seat, cliffhanger feeling at the end of Either/Or, Part 1, but what can you do?  Hopefully, more volumes will eventually appear!"
