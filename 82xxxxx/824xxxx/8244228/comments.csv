,clintferns,2013-03-11T20:04Z,thanks...does this include all packages ?
,maddog7777,2013-03-11T21:41Z,thanks! But this has already been out in the torrents. I got mine back on 2 -21 - 2013
,aarque,2013-03-12T02:24Z,"Ya no. For one thing, they are different sizes, the two torrents and for another, he is specifically trying to mirror the website: so, I'd say go for it. It will be a big loss when they are gone and I wish some other cool sites' content had been saved like this. Long live this torrent."
,maddog7777,2013-03-12T04:38Z,@aarque! I just downloaded this and it is the exact same thing. Nothing is different! Its no big deal posting it up again. I was just saying that I got the same torrent! Now I have two copies of the same thing. There is no law against having two identical torrents.
,bartschenk,2013-03-12T06:59Z,yes these are all the packets of World of ai
,aarque,2013-03-13T05:11Z,"well it is best to have only one torrent of any individual software. Consider if each leecher started a torrent...then they would all die, so...better to seed only one imo"
,boodee,2013-03-14T06:47Z,"WoAI is the best traffic add on for fsx, even when compare to payware traffic, it's a real big loss they shut down the project
thanks for reserving this wonderful add on"
,bartschenk,2013-03-14T11:07Z,you're welcome
,Rigault,2013-03-16T16:08Z,"But this add-on is not exactly for FSX, tks anyway."
,maddog7777,2013-03-16T23:29Z,"Thanks for sharing! But this one is a lot better and less confusing to work with.
