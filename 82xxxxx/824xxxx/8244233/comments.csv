Did you manage to get Dr. Fate or The Spectre (I'm not trying to hurry you, I'm curious because I have never found download links for those)"

,tdurden83,2013-03-12T03:56Z,"thx man! i'd actually searched tpb for this, to no avail, a couple months ago "
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-12T04:05Z,"good to know that these comics are reaching readers who enjoy and/or want 'em.  :-)

i had a rough day, we had to have one of our pets euthanized. so it's nice to sit down and read your comments while downloading some more.

Oneiromancer12, some guy in a gold helmet says to look out for a torrent soon ..."
