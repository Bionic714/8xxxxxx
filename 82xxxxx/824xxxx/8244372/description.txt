Little-T and One Track Mike - Fome Is Dape[2001]FLAC.Explicit-r3mnants

Description:
Fome Is Dape is the sole album from the Hip-Hop duo, Little-T and One Track Mike. It was released on August 28, 2001 on Lava Records,[1] and it features their one-off hit, Shaniqua.

The band describes "Fome" as "Dancin' in your house in your underwear, playin' air guitar to a stadium of teddy bears. Or goin' to work, headphones on, ignoring what your boss says, singin' along", and "Dape" as "An adjective synonymous with absolute glory, kinda like great, super-fly, hype, fresh, bigger than big, better than best".

Rearrange the vowels in the title and you have its true meaning, "Fame is Dope."




Note:
I could not grab the music video of Shaniqua because the video actually isn't on the CD. There is software that redirects you to a website with the video and that website doesn't exist anymore. If you have the high quality version of the video please leave a comment
