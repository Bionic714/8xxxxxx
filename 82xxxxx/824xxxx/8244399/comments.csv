This isn't an overly popular download so it wont kill your data allowance to just let it stay active in utorrent. I will continue sharing as much as possible but I'm not running a server here, I can't be online all the time! SHARING IS CARING!

And support the artists that make you happy. I'm a big believer in paying for the things you love. I share to try to expose this music to as many people as I can, show respect and send some $ to the artists if you can afford to. Sunk Loto CD's and merch are hard to find these days but you can buy the new album Venemous by Electric Horse, which some ex-Sunk Loto band members. I have a download of that album active too but please use it only as a ""trial"", if you appreciate the music it has only just been released, the album is readily available to purchase so if you have some spare $ do the right thing and support a small band that make fantastic music."

Have a listen, if you like it... well, I would hope morally you know what you should do."
