,WayneJ,2013-03-11T21:36Z,Not bad video is really small though
,HALL2013,2013-03-11T22:34Z,"It's not small. The video starts off black & white and small for the first 20 minutes until he gets to Oz. From the way the camera angle captures the screen when he gets there, I think it was purposely done like this as part of the movie. A: 8  V: 7"
