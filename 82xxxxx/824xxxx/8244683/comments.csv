,TheLathe,2013-03-15T01:21Z,"I'm looking right now like the Devil to find the right ones; but the ones I've found so far out not in sync.

I THOUGHT that I had the right one and I adjusted the delay because of an opening studio logo, but the damn thing is off later on in the film!

If I find the right one, I'll post the link here; if someone else does first, PLEASE post it here!

Thanks!"
