A couple weeks ago someone ""anonymous"" uploaded 93% of After Hours (1985) in 720p http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088680/?ref_=sr_1 It never completed. Was wondering if you had an HDTV rip of that one. Thanks again."

I'd like to request two titles in 720p HDTV...

Nayati's suggestions are actually quite good  : )

Cheers mate!!!"

,TheLathe,2013-03-15T21:33Z,"Hey Nomad!

Dude, this particular time I can NOT play this on my player.  For some odd reason you raised the level to 5 instead of using your normal 4.1  EVERYONE can play 4.1 on any device, but almost NO stand alone players can play the higher level.

I'm thinking that this musta just been a boo boo or something, since you normally use the MUCH more device friendly level 4.1

I hope you don't mind my mentioning it, but if you could PLEASE just go back to what you normally do, that would be awesome!

Otherwise, I won't be able to play any more of your FANTASTIC posts!   : (

Thanks man for understanding!

Cheers!"
,TheLathe,2013-03-16T01:25Z,"I went ahead and re-rendered it using UncropMKV which only took a couple of hours.  That way I was able to change the level to 4.1  Now it plays fine  : )

But, of course if I don't have to do that and can just play yours directly, I retain more of your excellent quality!

Cheers!"
[T],nomad_runner,2013-03-22T02:53Z,"Hey thelathe, sorry for the trouble, sometimes I don't double check my settings if I'm in a hurry. Glad you were able to still play it!"
