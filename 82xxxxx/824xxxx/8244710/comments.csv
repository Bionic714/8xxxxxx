I have set up my Dropbox as a web seed, so whenever I'm not home seeding you can still download it.

Cheers"

First of all, thanks!

Now, I think indigo standalone app works fine. I have no watermark. 

But do you happen to know, how to get rid of the watermark in cinema 4d? (plugin)"

I'm sorry friend, I can't help you! I use Indigo mainly with the Blender plugin. I have never worked with the Cinema 4D one"
