I am great fan off your add on of railworks 3. You are doing great job as it is not possible to afford the DLCs. 
I have version 25.1 b of Train Simulator 2013. If you could tell how to upgrade to version 27 or higher I would be grateful. PS I have a skidrow copy of TS 2013.
Waiting for your reply at the earliest.
Thanks."
