The Class 111 is a 2-car DMU (diesel multiple unit) with twin Rolls Royce engines and a 4-speed manual transmission, which is accurately recreated in this add-on to allow you to operate the gearbox yourself. With 23 sets being manufactured in total by Metro-Cammell between 1957 and 1960, the Class 111 is typical of the small DMUs which provided passenger services on rural lines like The Granfield Branch. This pack also includes the Class 02 shunter and 8F steam locomotive and The Granfield Branch for you to run them on.
