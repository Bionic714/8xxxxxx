As TS copies goes this is pretty good. Had me a little worried at the start but soon after i was liking what i saw (don't want to give anything away but keep watching for at least 20 minutes to see what i am talking about). 

Always a pleasure downloading your works HM. 

Cheers"

Some of us genuinely do not have access to a theater within 100 miles. No Joke! And the Theater is beautiful..built in the era of the original ""WoO"" but now pretty funky..so..thanks..

Also have to chime in on this..increasingly annoying and increasingly aggressive advertising/linking;

Look..if you're going to pretend to offer competing files its..pointless..if you have No Uploads to your name!

So we only need to link to a name to basically realize that the link for some ""recommend"" is..umm..'not in the spirit of this thing of ours' or worse..Nefarious.

,barabusignasius,2013-03-14T00:04Z,When people are starving all over the world It is immoral to spend hundreds of millions to make a film.  Buy paying the $10 ticket price you are encouraging this wasteful behavior.  By pirating the movie and cutting into their profits you motivate them to be more economical.   This farce proves that big budgets do not equal good movies.   Support responsible film makers.  Disrupt the irresponsible ones.   
,jfhjr,2013-03-14T00:17Z,Oh FFS - a CAM is NOT a TS! False advertising bitches. 
,lassik2,2013-03-14T01:05Z,"Just keep in mind that the first 20 minutes of the movie are meant to look old cinema style (aka ""like shit""). The quality of the actual movie once it's done with the old cinematic look is still kinda crappy though.

It's a Cam so you can expect that style of quality.

There's also a slight crackling noise in the audio that I thought was just part of the cinematic beginning but it's not. It continues throughout the movie. It's not extremely noticeable but for me, I use wireless headphones and it's pretty noticeable to me."

Those numbers are taking into consideration that this is a cam. The head of the actor is cut off in a scene, so other parts of the image are missing throughout the movie. The audio crackles a bit, I thought at first it was intentional, to kinda coincide with the black and white at the start, but it is in fact a flaw from beginning to end. But I knew this wouldn't be dvd or blueray quality so I didn't mind putting up with a couple minor flaws to watch this interesting prequel to The Wizard of Oz. Like how they tied it into the Disney classic."

He reminds me of a young Keanu Reeves, which is a bad thing."
