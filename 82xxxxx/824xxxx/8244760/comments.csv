,Chiller73,2013-03-11T20:47Z,Where's the fix for ridiculous lag even when using a high end vid. card/ system? I know the coding from Rebellion can't be this damn poor. Unplayable in my opinion...if its even worth it in  the first place.

,RMJ113,2013-03-11T21:33Z,"I

,ChiliNoMoreX,2013-03-11T22:19Z,"@Chiller73 
it wasn't devs fault...
scene release was not properly cracked and steam drm caused the game to perform poorly.

it might be fixed by now..."
,shanksjas,2013-03-11T22:25Z,Gona full hd graphic :D
,Resausk,2013-03-12T03:35Z,"Don't bother with the update, the Developers already mentioned this update is pointless."
