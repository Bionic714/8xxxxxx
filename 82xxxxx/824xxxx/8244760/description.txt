**     **RELEASE NOTES**       **
 ****************************** 

 Featuring a co-op campaign for 1 to 4  players,  Nazi  Zombie  Army  is  a
 horrifying new stand-alone expansion of  the  award-winning  Sniper  Elite
 series.
 In the dying flames of World War II, a  despairing  Hitler  unleashes  one
 final, unholy gamble - a legion of undead super soldiers that threatens to
 overwhelm the whole of Europe.
 You are Karl Fairburne - the sniper who shaped world history. You are  one
 of  the  last  living  souls  in  Germany.  You  must  team  up  or   die.
 American, German,  Russian  -  previous  military  allegiances  no  longer
 matter. Now it's just the living versus the dead.
 Only a Sniper Elite with nerves of steel and a steady aim stands a  chance
 against Hitler's Nazi Zombie Army!


 Features:

 * Battle through blood-drenched levels in a Berlin overrun by Hitler's
   supernatural forces.
 * Adapt to harrowing new enemies - occult commanders, roof-jumping
   snipers, undead suicide infantry and worse...
 * Test your sniping skills under extreme pressure, keep your cool, and
   keep a boomstick handy - just in case.
 * For the first time in Sniper Elite history, battle your way through a
   campaign built for up to four players.
 * Fight back-to-back with a German officer, a scientist and a Russian
   soldier.
 * Work together or face annihilation - plan your positions, set your traps
   and make your stand.
 * See every putrid lung burst, every rotten bone shatter with the return
   of Sniper Elite's acclaimed X-Ray 'kill cam'.
 * Experience the genre-best sniping ballistics and precise controls that
   made the series a best-seller.
 * Take into account gravity, wind, velocity, stability and more under the
   pressure of the zombie onslaught. You don't want to miss.
