,sisco955,2013-03-12T01:07Z,Where are you getting this 13th song from?
,drader,2013-03-16T05:44Z,The 13th song is a jam recorded at the Record Plant in 1970 (With Billy Cox & Buddy Miles).  Not sure why it's tacked on to this album but it's cool to listen to and gives the impression that this Hendrix guy is pretty good on guitar.  And hard working since his death.  I suppose we can expect a new Tupac album any day now.
