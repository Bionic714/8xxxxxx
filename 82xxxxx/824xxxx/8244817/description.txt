Hi this is Sean. This is the music I wrote for Anodyne (get it...here! or anodynegame.com, or soon, Steam!) ! Well, a lot of it, there's still some other junk sitting around on my hard drive or in "The Cloud", but that isn't safe for public consumption (maybe...)

So, if you liked it at all and can, feel free to purchase the OST at, or just buy a single track! Spread the word, remix it (and let me know if you do, remixes are really cool).

Maybe I'll upload FLAC later, but I'm probably too lazy.


Bye bye.
