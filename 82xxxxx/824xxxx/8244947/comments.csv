,highresjunkie,2013-03-12T10:42Z,"You skimped on the bitrate a little bit on this one. Your 720p had a video bitrate of 852kbps, so in order for a 1080 to have the same quality, it would need a video bitrate of 1908kbps, but this is only 1812kbps. Is having a nice round file size really that important? There are few encoders I respect more for their talent and contributions, but every once in a while I think you put just a lil too much emphasis on low file size."

,Dorell,2013-04-19T01:04Z,"Here’s another well-known fact about President Abraham Lincoln:
The Emancipation Proclamation freed the slaves, right? Well, no.
The Proclamation, issued by Lincoln on January 1, 1863, proposed
freeing slaves in the Southern states only—it didn’t mention ending
slavery in the North. Even Lincoln’s secretary of state, William Henry Seward,
saw the irony in this and stated, “We show our sympathy with
slavery by emancipating slaves where we cannot reach them and holding
them in bondage where we can set them free.”
Before he issued the Emancipation Proclamation, Lincoln threatened the
South by saying if they didn’t rejoin the Union, he would abolish slavery.
They didn’t, and he had to follow through with his threat—but it was
an empty threat because the South had already seceded and Lincoln had
no authority over it. Lincoln’s real reason for the Proclamation was made
very clear in a letter he sent to the New York Times:
My paramount objective in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not
to save or destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any
slaves, I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all slaves, I would do
it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone, I would
do that."
,AtotehZ,2013-05-28T22:46Z,"Percypp, Phatsaq, vmjyogi, RabbleFan. You suck! Excelguy, this IS 1080p. 1080p represents how many pixels that are in the rip itself. It has been compressed a lot, but it doesn't change the fact that it is 1080p. Get your facts straight."
