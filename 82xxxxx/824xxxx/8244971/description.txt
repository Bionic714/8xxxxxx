                              Drivers
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mass storage drivers added

AMD Catalyst 13.10 including control panel

Nvidea 313.96, plus USB 3 Drivers, Sata, intel chipset drivers

I opted not to use the driver packs as they are old and flawed causing BSODs.

Special note: In vmware on certain hardware, if you click on my computer and it loads

properties instead of explorer, you will only have to hit the shift button 3 times, ctrl button 3 times

alt button 3 times and it will now work properly. Has something to do with it activates sticky keys.

It only happen very rarely occasion first install in vmware.
