,quinnarty,2013-03-13T20:18Z,"Using ImgBurn to create backups of games you already own:
Dual Layer DVD ( Verbatim Brand )
iHas B DL DVD Burner

For those of you creating backup games,
XGD2 Games LayerBreak = 1913760
XGD3 Games LayerBreak = 2133520
Open your .dvd file in notepad and make sure that the layer break is set for either 1913760 or 2133520 depending on if the game is XGD2 or XGD3. 
To check to see which your game is, visit the XDG3 Website and search your game. 
If it has a Wave Number next to it, burn with XGD2 Layerbreak. 
If it says XGD3 next to it, burn with XGD3 Layer Break. 
I'm sure most of you already know to burn at 2.4x. 

I have a full guide if you ask for it.
This game is XDG2.

@QuinnArtyKno on Twitter if you have any questions."

You no longer need an ihas B version, you can use an ihas C, or D or other versions of ihas because they came out with Payload tool.

Also, depending on the type of media you have MKM0-001 or MKM-003 there are different burn speeds.

MKM-001 = 4X
MKM-003 = 2.4x"
