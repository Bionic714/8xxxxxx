,TheCrowdGoesWild,2013-03-12T01:37Z,"This is the size of file that every cam upload should be around, sick of seeing low res cam rips that are 2Gb+ on this site. As for the quality of this -

Audio - 9. it's line and very good quality, didn't even have to play with any audio settings in VLC to tweak it a bit.

Video - 8. Stays in focus, not blurry. A bit over exposed in places which can make the colours look washed out, especially the human skin tones. Dark scenes are ok, you lose a bit of the background in the dark but the main characters are easy to see. 

Overall it is very watchable and this will probably be the one people use until the DVDrip comes along in a few months time.

One of the best first cams that I've seen for quite a while

Thanks SSDD & Tykoon

,morphirr,2013-03-18T19:19Z,"@TheCrowdGoesWild totally agree all cams should be 700mb or smaller and not be 2.5GB which is a waste of bandwidth

thanks tykoon123 good up for cam"
