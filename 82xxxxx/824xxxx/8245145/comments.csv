,TheSourMango,2013-04-11T21:09Z,"Has anyone found any version of Quantum in even higher quality?
Not that this is bad but a 2hr movie in 1080p just doesn't take up only 1,6gig, your'e gonna need a higher stream to get the action caught properly :)

Thank you YIFY for great torrents, just asking for GREAT quality for my collection.
One does not simply encode a bond movie from 4,7gig (DVD) or 25gig (BR) to 1,6gig! If you know what i mean! :D

P.S. I'll probably upload a 2,5gig version in 1080p if i can't find it."
