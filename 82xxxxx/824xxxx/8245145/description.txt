Is there solace in revenge? Bond and &#x22;M&#x22; sniff a shadowy international network of power and corruption reaping billions. As Bond pursues the agents of an assassination attempt on &#x22;M,&#x22; all roads lead to Dominic Greene, a world-renowned developer of green technology. Greene, a nasty piece of work, is intent on securing a barren area of Bolivia in exchange for assisting a strongman stage a coup there. The CIA looks the other way, and only Bond, with help from a retired spy and from a mysterious beauty, stands in Greene&#x27;s way. &#x22;M&#x22; wonders if she can trust Bond, or if vengeance possesses him. Beyond that, can anyone drawn to Bond live to tell the tale?
