* Plot :

We start with some footage from the first film, showing flashes of Nell Sweetzer (Ashley Bell) being exorcised by Rev. Cotton Marcus (Patrick Fabian), leading to the climax with the satanic ritual, and Nell's brother Caleb (Caleb Landry Jones) decapitating Daniel (Adam Grimes) the cameraman. Apparently, the camera containing that footage is still lying in the woods.

Cut to a couple in New Orleans, Jared (Judd Lormand) and Steph (Raeden Greer), sleeping. Steph gets up, and something crawls into bed with Jared. When he sees Steph standing before him, the thing growls and claws at Jared's leg. The couple hides, but they look in their kitchen and find a demonic-looking Nell squatting by the fridge.

Nell is taken to a doctor. She's catatonic and has barely any memory of what occurred in Ivanwood. As she's given a bath, the nurse cuts a lock of her hair and keeps it. The nurse then continues to clean her when the radio begins to lose signal with a hint of white noise, and Nell later claims "He will kill us all".
