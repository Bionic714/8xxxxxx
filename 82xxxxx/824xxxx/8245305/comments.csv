,freegamesYES,2013-03-13T15:46Z,are you certain that this is owrking? the download is at 3 weeks... i downloaded the v153 and it only took 20 minutes so its not my internet
,eXoflow,2013-03-14T09:09Z,"@freegamesYES

Yes I am certain. The reason it takes so long time is that I uploaded it just a couple of days ago. It is not that well seeded yet. Just leave the download on, it will get faster and will probably only take a day or two."
,wet250,2013-03-16T19:58Z,The rar seems to be damaged. Can't extract a single thing. Perhaps you uploaded it and ended up corrupted. Ive downloaded the same thing over with the same result. (corrupted rar)
,kill4win,2013-03-16T20:09Z,Does the multiplayer work? 
,eXoflow,2013-03-16T21:56Z,"@wet250

I'm sure it is not corrupted, try downloading with another torrent client or try extracting with WinRar (if you're not already doing that)

@kill4win

Depends. On some computers it does, on some, not. It is a bug in the latest revEmu."
