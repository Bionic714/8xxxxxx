Retired janitor Hannes has led a simple but hardworking life. Nobody would call him enthusiastic or even very kind; his children remember affection being an annual event, like Christmas. After 37 years on the job, a future without the comfort of his janitorial routine looms large and heavy. After his wife Anna suffers a stroke and slips into a coma, his emotional world is turned upside down, forcing Hannes to summon long-repressed emotional resources to cope with the situation. Those around him are swept up in his tidal change, as their own unexpressed feelings rise. This feature directorial debut from Rúnar Rúnarsson is a delicately played, realistic reexamination of love through loss. Rúnarsson’s well-rounded characters infuse the film with life that feels both uniquely Icelandic and universal, showing how coming of age can happen at any age. Grainy 16mm stock and a soundtrack from Sigur Rós’ Kjartan Sveinsson give Volcano nostalgic warmth.
