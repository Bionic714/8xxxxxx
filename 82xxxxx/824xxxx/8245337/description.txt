(This is Take Two - my torrent creator botched my first attempt.)

You most likely know who Moebius is; if not, this torrent is a good place to find out. Epic Comics imported, translated and published a great deal of his work during the imprint's lifespan. This torrent contains, to the best of my knowledge, all of that work, PLUS a couple of limited series set in the 'Airtight Garage' universe in which Moebius provided the writing or plot, with art chores handled by others (Eric Shanower, for one). While a lot of these volumes are available and well-seeded on TPB, they are often one-book torrents, which requires multiple torrents and downloads in order to accumulate a collection. As part of my (almost completed, yay!) epic Comics Upload-Quest, the heavy-lifting has already been done for you here.

Here's a list of books contained here that I do NOT see elsewhere on TPB: 'Chaos', 'Metallic Memories', several 'Blueberry' books and the two 'Airtight Garage' sandbox mini-series, 'Elsewhere Prince' and 'Onyx Overlord'.

Thank you Moebius, thank you creative teams and thank you scanners. Get it, pass it on.
