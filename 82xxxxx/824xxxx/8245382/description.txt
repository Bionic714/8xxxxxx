Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site :: On the Monday, March 11 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex confronts the prospect of America being overrun with surveillance drones following yet another drone spotted within three miles of LaGuardia Airport in New York. He also dispels the double talk of the Obama administration as it promises it will not murder Americans with killer drones after previously stating it would target terrorists on American soil with the high-tech gizmos. He also covers an unearthed Bilderberg report revealing that a war in the Middle East appears to be in the cards as events in Syria and Iran continue to unfold. On today's worldwide broadcast, Jones talks with former stock trader and television host Max Keiser about the roller coaster stock market casino and the slowly disintegrating global economy as the global elite continue their move to consolidate wealth and power.
