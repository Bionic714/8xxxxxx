For those of you who don't know Dispatch, they are arguably the most successful indie band of all time. As of March 2013, they have released five albums and two EPs. The best way I can describe their sound is a mix between rock, acoustic, folk, reggae, funk, and hip/hop. Although just about every song they have ever released is great, they are most well-known for "The General."

This is the original Dispatch: Zimbabwe concert DVD. If you want to burn it to a disc, you will either need a DVD-DL or you'll need to use a program like DVD Shrink to compress video and remove unwanted titles/tracks.

PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE: If you like this DVD, consider buying it and/or other Dispatch DVDs/albums. Remember, they are an indie band, and they really rely on their fans to keep them going. They originally got big through people sharing their music on Napster, and they give so much back to their fans and to various charities. If you like their music, please give some back to them.

From Wikipedia:

Dispatch:Zimbabwe is a live DVD recording by American indie rock band Dispatch, recorded July 14 and 15, 2007 at Madison Square Garden in New York. The concert acted as both a reunion for the band, as well as a fundraiser, with proceeds from the concert ticket sales going to charities that fight disease, famine and social injustice in Zimbabwe.
