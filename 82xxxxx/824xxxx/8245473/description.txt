NOTE: I suggest downloading VLC Media Player to watch this release.  You can download it here:
           
http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html

A few important and simple keyboard shortcuts for VLC are:

Double click: Fullscreen
Spacebar: Play/Pause
V key: Enable/Disable/Change Subtitles.
G/H key: Subtitle Delay (-50ms/+50ms per tap)

NOTE: English Subtitles (.srt( are on by default.  If you do not want Subtitles, simply tap the V key or delete the Subtitles folder.  If you want the original .sub subtitles in any of the languages listed, Right Click, Subtitle, Open File, and then choose the appropriate .sub or .idx file from the Subtitles (.sub) folder.

NOTE: I do not have constant Internet access, so this upload may take a few days.  PLEASE BE PATIENT!

NOTE: I will also be uploading Season 3 DVDRip, since there are no legit/official uploads of it in DVDRip on TPB.
