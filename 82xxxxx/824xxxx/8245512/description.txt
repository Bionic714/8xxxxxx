This is a documentary of the 1998 reunion show of Israeli band Kaveret. It is not a very good copy and is not complete, but there is no better copy available at this time.

This is a VHS (taped from TV) to DVD conversion, with an attempt to improve the sound quality by mixing it with audio from the CD release of the same concert.

Enjoy!
