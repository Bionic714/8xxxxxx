,Ironmaiden2013,2013-04-27T16:22Z,"Extract, then open the folder where the emulator is and click the file ZSNESW. When the program opens, connect a joystic to your pc and go to config. on the menu, set keys at this menu. After you figure how to set the controller click on game then load. On the right side you are going to see all your computer contents and you can browse on that window the folders on your pc. Find the folder where the ROMS, Games are located and click on that folder, then on the left side you are going to see the list of the games. double click on the one you want to play and have fun."
