After losing thousands of vinyls and a high quality sound system in a flood a few years ago, I'm appreciative of the high-res vinyl posts.  Any time you can give additional info about pressings, ripper, equipment, etc., it would be appreciated.  I'm one who liked to collect different pressings of an album just to compare the subtle (and sometimes not so subtle) differences.  Thanks again and keep 'em coming!"
