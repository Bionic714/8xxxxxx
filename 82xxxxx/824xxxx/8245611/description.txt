Info cobbled together from several sources (mostly Wikipedia), says:

William Shatner's TekWorld (or Tek World) was a comic book series published by Epic Comics/Marvel, from 1992 to 1994. It is based on the TekWar novels.

Lee Sullivan, who was the principal artist on the series (providing the art for 16 issues and all the covers), had worked with Evan Skolnick on Marvel's RoboCop series, and it was Skolnick who recommended Sullivan to the editor Fabian Nicieza when they lost the original artist for the project. Sullivan was also allowed to produce the full line art because, he says, "I had found it difficult to provide pencils that anyone could ink well, and the results were much better."

Following a request from Shatner, the look of the series was adjusted to parallel the television series when it was in production. Despite being more closely tied-into the expanding TekWar franchise, the title was one of those which got cut during Marvel's financial problems in the mid-nineties, with the last issue cover dated August 1994.

The 21st century universe is centered around "tek"ΓÇöan illegal, addictive, mind-altering digital drug in the form of a microchip. The drug has the effect of simulated reality (as shown in the films and series), and taps into "the matrix" hyperspace. The protagonist, Jake Cardigan, is a former police officer who is framed for dealing in the drug four years before the start of the story. Having been sentenced to 15 years' cryo-imprisonment, he is released early. After discovering that Walt Bascom, the powerful head of a private security firm, arranged for the early release, Jake goes to work for Bascom as an investigator dedicated to tracking down the real Tek lords.

Praise to the creative teams, Shatner and the scanners. Make it so.
