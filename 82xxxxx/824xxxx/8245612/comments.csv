Where's the original Hebrew?"
,saddamlevine,2013-03-12T20:15Z,It's really fucking annoying to have the French dubbed over the Hebrew. Do the French think their language is so great that they have to mask the language of others? Can't they read subtitles?
,Dorhal1,2013-03-12T22:41Z,Can you PLEASE upload the Hebrew verision ?
,guillot44,2013-03-12T23:53Z,"I would have uploaded the original version, but can't find it anywhere. This one is from a French TV channel that translated it. Sorry about it.
Only French speakers will be interested, I know, but please don't blame me."
,snaporaxx,2013-03-13T13:09Z,merci beaucoup

@saddamlevine: who the hell do you think you are. why didn't you upload an hebrew version of Mindy McCready Baseball Mistress?
@guillot44: merci"
,saddamlevine,2013-03-14T01:40Z,@vluejdop: i didn't upload it because your sister came all over my keyboard while i mounted her on my desk
,good_man,2013-03-15T04:10Z,"north americans, you are all assholes. why don't you thanks the uploader? wasn't his fault that the video is french dubbed.
could someone please make subtitles for it?"

,saddamlevine,2013-03-17T17:03Z,"There's only two things I hate

Those who are intolerant of others

And the French"
,Eclairequ,2013-03-17T18:34Z,"@sadamlevine:  Actually, it sounds like ""hate"" is something you spend most of your time doing.

Stop being such a typical, paranoid fucktard. The guy posted a frigging movie; he's not making a comment about you, your language, or your culture.  Not EVERYTHING is about Israel.  You could also thank the poster for his efforts.

Thank you, guillot44."
,aflexa,2013-03-18T04:03Z,"Can anyone make any subtitle for this release?

@guillot44: Can you?"
,saddamlevine,2013-03-18T19:18Z,"Shagadellic, Eclairaqu....

The French also seem to take offense very easily"
,saddamlevine,2013-03-18T20:05Z,"The French are hypocrites.

They think they are the great purveyors of culture, but then they dub stupid Frence voices onto every other language in the world.

How would you like to watch Cocteau, Renoir, Godard - all dubbed with corny American voices and accents?"
,logan-x-art,2013-03-22T23:27Z,"...fuck the jews and fuck israel...

,MC26,2013-03-24T11:14Z,I looked around for English subs but I couldn't find any.  I think its great that the documentary was uploaded but I don't speak French.  Anyone have any luck finding subs?
,zenicaone,2013-03-27T22:03Z,"@saddamlevine

quick google search of his user name gave at least three results of three different persons (on FB twitter myspace etc) - you are not so smart after all 

anyway - anyone  has english subtitles for this movie ? - thanks in advance"
,saddamlevine,2013-03-27T23:39Z,"zenicaone, if you explore those 3 'different' hits it's easy to identify which one the above handle belongs to....never apply for a job as a detective"
,katDz,2013-03-29T19:33Z,@guillot44: Merci beaucoup!
,ixvortex,2013-04-04T21:23Z,"This commentary is funny as shit on a stick.

I`m not anti Semitic in the least, but you have to give Israel credit, they learned from the best about how to oppress another people and they do it well. LOL This has to be like watching the German Wehrmacht list their successes, minus the death camps of course. I`d like to have it in english, please.

Yeah I know, Americans are just as much fascist (Preemptive wars of mass murder for oil, concentration camps and torture) as Israel. Kinda ironic since Jews were one of the victims and America was the saviors of WWII.      
"
,saddamlevine,2013-04-05T03:17Z,"'This has to be like watching the German Wehrmacht list their successes, minus the death camps of course.'

I haven't seen it either, that's why I'm following this title closely.

However, I believe you're mistaken. The reason this movie is getting so much attention is that the various heads of the Shin Bet (Israeli secret service) critically state in the movie that they believe Israeli government policy regarding Palestinians is misguided. 

I won't address your other comments because you're clearly an ignorant fuck."
,ixvortex,2013-04-05T07:23Z,"Even Shin Bet admits Israel`s policies are wrong, but ""misguided"". LOL Who`s the ignorant fuck here? Israel has clearly learned how to make life impossible for the Palestinians. It is fascist behavior, much like the Germans, they don`t use a measured response, but take a toll more than ten or a hundred times what they receive. 

I will admit that the US is by far the worse fascist state(a least under conservatives), destroying Iraq, when they had nothing to do with 9/11 and Israel, with Mossad, was more than capable of taking care of Iraq`s WMDs. Always have, always will.  

I will probably watch this in a theater tomorrow, since I don`t have much of a chance to find one with en subs. "
,saddamlevine,2013-04-06T04:02Z,"lvortex, you are clearly one of the USA's fascists"
,ixvortex,2013-04-06T17:52Z,"saddamlevine, you are clearly one if the chosen people`s fascist. For your information, I am anti fascist and anti communist. The extremist of the world are fucking it up for the rest of us.   "
,saddamlevine,2013-04-06T21:53Z,"vortex....anti-fascism is just a label....from your initial comments about this movie - which were highly judgmental and presumptuous, clearly without you having either seen the movie or read much about it - it's obvious you have fascistic tendencies

to be a real active fascist requires some degree of power or access to power....hopefully you will never acquire either"
,ixvortex,2013-04-06T22:35Z,"saddamlevine---So am I a fascist or not? LOL Anyone who knows anything about Israel, knows they are fascist, as is the US. Any one who supports what Israel does to the Palestinians is also fascist. As for the movie, what I said was obviously speculation, based on a movie review and of course ignorant of any content. If that is fascist or not, I`ll leave to your uninformed opinion.      "
,HaVoC_850,2013-04-07T16:57Z,"It's the documentary about the Israeli Shin-Bet.

,ufalum88,2013-04-10T01:10Z,Please upload this in English...the Lord's language....  ;-)
,saddamlevine,2013-04-12T23:15Z,The movie is in the original Lord's language...Hebrew ; )
,MC26,2013-04-16T03:10Z,Nicely done :)
,MC26,2013-04-16T09:19Z,"Spent last hour scouring internet for this movie or English subtitles for this version.  No luck.  I think this is a limited release film in theaters, not even sure how they got this French release version but might have to wait a few more months for a DVD version to be ripped.  Guess I will go watch ""5 Broken Cameras"" instead. Same conflict, different viewpoint."
,Rambou87,2013-04-23T17:59Z,"Swedish TV aired it last night, in original language (Hebrew), with swedish subtitles."

,zenicaone,2013-04-23T19:17Z,"@Rambou87 

it can only be viewed with swedish ip

any way - we have swedish (maybe someone from sweden will upload) and french language versions so far anyone care to make english subtitles for world audience ?

Thanks in advance"
,MC26,2013-04-24T23:16Z,@Rambou87 @zenicaone That would be amazing if someone could translate the show to English.  Wouldn't be that hard to overlay subs but I don't speak Hebrew/French/Dutch.  Here is hoping for Spanish or a fast release date.
,dishmaya,2013-05-08T01:03Z,"The movie will be aired soon in Channel 1 here in Israel. If I'm not mistaken, they will air it as a mini-series with additional scenes that were not included in the movie. It won't take long 'till it's uploaded to Israeli sites, I'll try to upload it with subtitles when that happens."
,Bendico,2013-05-14T14:42Z,"The fact that the French dubbed this Hebrew documentary make me hate them even more than I already did.

Why can't the French do it like all the other nations of this world? 

All other nations only use subtitles -- they do not dub it. Jesus Christ, God forbid the French learn to speak more than one language."
,MC26,2013-05-15T17:54Z,@Bendico  Some people prefer not to have subtitles.  I think your just angry because some people can watch it and you can't.
,zenicaone,2013-05-20T15:21Z,@dishmaya - looking forward for you upload - thanks in advance
,HaVoC_850,2013-05-28T01:27Z,@dishmaya - waiting for your upload. Thanks in advance as well :)
,mbonaci,2013-05-31T20:33Z,"@Bendico FYI German and Italian TVs also dub everything. And I mean everything, even John Wayne, Godfather, ... 
Can you imagine e.g. Richard Harris in Gladiator without his voice? Or Christopher Walken, Jack Nicholson,  Steve Buscemi, ...

They try to soften the impact by using the same person for each actor to get people accustomed to the voice.

So in Italy the same guy dubs De Niro and Al Pacino for a long time and people were fine with it.
So birds were singing, fountains were burbling, Pope was praying and life was great.

And then the movie Heat came out :))

No, the voice-actor did not self destruct, he dubbed both of them by slightly changing his voice. Just try to imagine the ""meeting at the restaurant"" scene.

BTW, isn't this the very reason why Italians and Germans pronounce English with so much accent?

And one more thing, I think they don't have the slightest idea how spared they were while we were watching Terminator :)"
