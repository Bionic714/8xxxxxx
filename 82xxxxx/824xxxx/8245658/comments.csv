Quality good, no skips, hiss, etc. could be louder, but all there - best torrent Ive found yet.
A few songs good, most on album sound the same tho. I way prefer his old classic stuff, but thats just me - u be the judge. 
I wont be buying this, unless it ""clicks""(unlikely) and will prob delete if not purchasing. regards."
