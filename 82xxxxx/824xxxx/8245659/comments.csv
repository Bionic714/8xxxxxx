,likepend1,2013-03-18T09:38Z,"forgot to add:
This is a 100k map = NOT ROUTABLE!
(only the 25k maps are routable)"
,Tstart,2013-03-19T14:55Z,"it says ""100K"" in the torrent name ...

and in the description it says:

""Includes updated road content, by NAVTEQ (non-routable)"""

,Jcalvincat,2013-03-24T02:42Z,"Hi, I downloaded this. Now how do I install it on my computer. I tried to burn a disc imgage which it says the file is. The file that shows on my Win7 machine is gmapsupp which show as a disc image file but when burned it comes up blank. Thanks"
,Jcalvincat,2013-03-24T02:52Z,"Hi, I downloaded this now I need to install it on a Windows 7 machine. I tried to burn a disc image but it comes up blank. The file is gmapsupp listed as a disc image file. So what's my next move? Thanks"
,Tstart,2013-03-24T12:04Z,"it´s not for burning, and you can´t use it in mapsource.

it´s an image for you Garmin´s SD-card"
,Jcalvincat,2013-03-24T13:48Z,Thanks for letting me know. Presently I don't have an Garmin card. Maybe someone will upload the DVD version.
,Jcalvincat,2013-03-24T23:50Z,A follow up. I loaded this on a flash drive run Fast IMG Unlocker 2.1 on it and I can view it in Basecamp. I haven't tried to load to my GPSmap76s yet. Now if I could only get Bluechart V9.5 to show details in Homeport.
,Tstart,2013-03-25T07:56Z,"already unlocked so should be no need for Fast IMG Unlocker 2.1.
"
,Jcalvincat,2013-03-25T14:59Z,I didn't know all I had to do was put it on a flash drive I was trying to run it off the harddrive originally. I'm still figuring somethings out. I just know that it works for me now. Thanks
