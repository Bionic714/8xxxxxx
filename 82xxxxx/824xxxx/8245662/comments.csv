,Villa777,2013-03-14T02:09Z,"Hello guys

Why was it skip to 1306 instead 1305?

Now the seeds are working fine"
,airbusflyer,2013-03-15T13:04Z,"@Villa777
because there was no up of 1305. Actual version is 1306 so everything is fine according to the cycle."

,ClaudioCa,2013-03-29T02:18Z,MAYDAY MAYDAY! I did the update! And now i am stuck! I ve put the data folder into JeppFD/documents....restarted JFD but still demo charts :((( appreciate some helps! Thank u very much! 
,el_barto7,2013-03-29T05:01Z,"to ClaudioCa

temporary solution, as I can see, the new App has change their folders. copy TermCharts to JeppFD.app/DemoData/

then  copy the subfolders of Enroute/db_a/ db1 & sotre to JeppFD.app/DemoData/Enroute/Databse

The only thing is NOT working is the terrain colors for the enroute charts. so far every thing is OK

Goodluck!"
,ClaudioCa,2013-03-29T10:03Z,"To El_barto7

Thanks for your help but it does not work. Im using ifunbox, and its impossible to modify folders inside jeppFD.app. I think the only way is to downgrade to v2.0.0. I,d appreciate if someone share jeppFD v2.0.0 ipa. Thanks"
,radial111,2013-03-29T10:45Z,PC anyone  ???
,rafikihd,2013-03-29T16:46Z,It is not on Appstore anymore...
,ClaudioCa,2013-03-29T18:37Z,Hi guys! Alternative option for those who are stucked with JFD v2.05 is to use JEppTC with this cycle. At least we gonna have terminal chart. Great job anonymous and all of you. Bless u
,bobdjebel,2013-03-29T21:34Z,"To Mac users.
If you have a Time Machine, use it!! Delete JeppFD in iTunes and use the TM backup to restore jeppFD in version 2.0.0. That's what I do and it works."
,el_barto7,2013-03-30T00:49Z,"to ClaudioCa,

Use DiskAid, I've tested today the only thing that does not work, is the Terrain. everything else Works ok (turbulence, winds, etc, airport charts, etc)"
,precursor1188,2013-03-30T03:14Z,"For those who needs the old FD version 2.0 or 1.1 can download the latest 1307 ipad from here and the link to old FD:

,quangkevinatc,2013-04-01T10:49Z,iam looking forward to seeing the cycle 1306 for PC....anyone hepl me? Thanks
,krisf,2013-04-04T16:09Z,"Hi guys,

what i did to get it working on 2.05:

as previously mentioned, put all the data in the 
/JeppFD.app/DemoData folder.

terrain goes in terrain, jvm goes in jvm and make sure you don't use ""sub"" maps, so everything directly in the folder.
Once you open one map, 9example terrain) you can already see there are some files ther, delete those and search for the complete files in the downloaded cycle.
The only tricky part is the enroute databas, or the folder /JeppFD.app/DemoData/Enroute/Database
here you have to put the db1 and store folders coming out of the enr from this location:

Jeppview 1307 IPADJeppview 1307 IPADDocumentsappDataJDS EnrouteJeppesen Enroute2456359.08333Jeppesenenr

at least that is the one i used
When all done, respring ipad and you're good to go

If still not working let me know, i might have some more time on my hands too make a better tutorial, but i think this would be clear enough for  now...

btw, using itools, simply the best for exploring the ipad"
,rdz777,2013-04-08T17:39Z,"How did you manage to modify jeppfd.app folder? do I need to JB the iPad, to be able to do so?"
,s3rgi0b,2013-04-11T18:42Z,A new update came out is 2.0.6 Im guessing we shouldn´t update?
,leeodes,2013-04-18T20:11Z,How did you manage to change jeppfd.app folder? I have installed the itools and ifunbox and neither could modify that folder. thanks
