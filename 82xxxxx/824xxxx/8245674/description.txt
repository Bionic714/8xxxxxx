"The Great Unknown"

When Dorrit goes missing under Carrie's watch, 
Carrie lashes out at Sebastian, the one person who 
can help her find Dorrit. Mouse butts heads with 
West, a popular jock who, much to her chagrin, 
stole her spot as number one in the class. Walt 
surprises himself when he confides in someone 
completely unexpected. Meanwhile, Tom finds 
himself in uncharted territory when it comes to 
women and turns to Larissa for advice.
