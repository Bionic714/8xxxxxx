A Show of Hands is a live album by the Canadian rock band Rush, released in 1989.

The album was recorded in Birmingham (UK), New Orleans, Phoenix, and San Diego during the 1988 Hold Your Fire tour as well as in the Meadowlands (East Rutherford, NJ) during the 1986 Power Windows tour. The opening track "Intro" features the Three Stooges theme song "Three Blind Mice" playing in the background; the band used this jingle to open many of their concerts during the 1980s.

I Absolutely love this album by RUSH, it remains one of my favorite live albums released by them. All the songs here are performed flawlessly, the sound,the vocals, everything about this album is awesome. I have listened to this album at least 100 times if not more and I don't skip a single song. Even if you dont like RUSH or had never listen to it I guarantee you'll like it. This guys are insanely good. I just love RUSH so much. I hope you like it too and enjoy this awesome music.
