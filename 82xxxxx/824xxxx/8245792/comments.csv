seriously, Ichthypod_Crane, thanks very much for all that you have uploaded. i have loved your epic torrents."
,binderguy1,2013-03-12T03:29Z,"I'm most impressed by the nearly complete ul of Epic Comics title from the 80's and 90's.  Too bad the more recent titles weren't ul'ed.

Thanks bunches for this stroll down memory lane!

I do so look forward to seeing titles from Eclipse and First Comics; such as SCOUT, AZTEC ACE, and maybe reseeding of Jon Sable Freelance, Starslayer."

One request:  do you have a copy of Blood - A Tale?  The torrent here on TPB is mislabeled.

Looking forward to the First and Eclipse sets!  Those should be great.  I'll see if I have any series from those publishers lurking somewhere in my collection."

Binderguy1, sorry I can't help you with the later Epic stuff, but I left instructions on how to run them down in the comments on the Marvel Razorline torrent. Happy hunting!"
