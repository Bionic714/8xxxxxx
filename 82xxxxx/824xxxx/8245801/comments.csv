,Mutegrill,2013-03-23T18:10Z,"Unfortunately YIFY's ""Lady and the Tramp"" is cut down to 16:9 (virtually unrecognizable). Aspect ratio should be 1.33:1 and CinemaScope 2.55:1. Lock at the comparisent (the link) and see that there's 30% missing:

I would recommend you download neons version instead, wich has hte absolute correct aspect ratio of 1280x496 (correlating perfectly to 1.33:1 and CinemaScope 2.55:1).
