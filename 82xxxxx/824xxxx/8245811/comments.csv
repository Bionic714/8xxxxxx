Is America such a backward, uncivilized place that one really does need a gun for self-defense?"

yes, it is. our crime rate is lower than countries that are not allowed to have guns, because the criminals there dont have to worry about someone shooting back at them."

Are Britains so forgetful, or simply incapable of learning, that they believe making a weak ass mocumentary is going to disarm a population of free people(admittedly losing liberties daily), when their previous efforts to do so 230 years ago didn't quite work out the way they'd hoped? The end result will be the same. 

I'm absolutely in support of better mental health care for those that clearly aren't getting any. Lets start with all the crazy people that ""think"" a disarmed population equals a safer one. Second, exactly how does an unarmed civilian take a gun from someone? I'd like to personally partake in that experiment, thanks."
,Bendico,2013-03-13T10:39Z,"Yeah, it's not an addiction. It's normal to want a gun to protect yourself. It helps you protect yourself and your family against bigger assailants or a large group of assailants. Nothing wrong with that.

In many ways it removes the height/weight/numerical advantage."
,balanced,2013-03-21T12:25Z,So at this point I'm 40 years old.  I'm probably somewhere around halfway through with my life by now.  And in that 40 years I have not had one situation - not one - where having a gun would have been a good idea.  In fact there were a few situations where having one would probably have made things worse.  So I really can't comprehend anything people say about civilians walking around with guns it makes no sense to me from the perspective of the life I have lived so far.
