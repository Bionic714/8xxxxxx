-ZATOICHI, THE BLIND SWORDSMAN-
-------------------------------


Twenty-five Zatoichi movies were made between 1962 and 1974, all staring Shintaro Katsu in the lead role.
A twenty-sixth film, also staring Shintaro Katsu, was made in 1988.
All the films were shot in wide screen Cinemascope. The first two are in B/W, the rest are in colour.
In Japanese, Zato (a form of "Mr.") is a prefix commonly used when addressing a blind man.
"Ichi" is his family name. 

Set a couple of hundred years in the past, during Japan's Edo period (1603 to 1868),
the blind hero is a masseur who also happens to be an honest yakuza gambler.
Walking from town to town, his walking stick tapping away in an effort to avoid falling on his face,
Zatoichi is always looking for a little massage work and an exciting game of dice. Invariably,
what he does find is corruption, people in need and violence,
as the body count of the assembled villains grows with each wave of his blade.

Shintaro Katsu has put on quite a few extra pounds in his later films, which actually makes his role as Zatoichi even better;
his bedraggled appearance serves to humanize a man that could easily slip into superhuman, and therefore unreal, status.
It's this down to earth feel that makes him such a beloved character,
a kind, unpretentious hero that seeks justice behind an inept fa√ßade.


All movies are in H.264 encoded MP4 file format with hardcoded English subtitles.
