This five-volume series provides a comprehensive overview of all important aspects of modern drying technology, concentrating on the transfer of cutting-edge research results to industrial use.
Volume 3 deals with product quality and formulation. Biochemical, physical, and mechanical transformations which can occur during drying are described as well as methods for monitoring product quality such as process analytical technology. The preservation of desired product properties is disucssed in detail for foods and biomaterials, freeze-dried active pharmaceutical ingredients, and highly porous, fragile materials such as aerogels. Emphasis is put on particle formation and morphology as well as on particle formulation by spray drying and spray fluidized bed processes, including granulation, agglomeration, coating, and encapsulation. Modeling tools such as Monte Carlo simulations, discrete particle modeling and neural networks are presented all in conjunction with real examples from industry and academia.
