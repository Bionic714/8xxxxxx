,joegi50,2013-04-15T23:17Z,"Thank you Kyle. I hope you will release House MD All Seasons in HD formats. We do not mind to take time to torrent as long as the AV quality is great. 
Make sure you break them into 8 seasons so we can torrent few at a time.
So far there is none with so many revisions and different formats.
English subtitle is a big plus for all of use. "
,joegi50,2013-04-15T23:20Z,"Kyle..One more thing: compression to keep the small size is good but the audio is terrible.
Nobody has done a complete seasons before.  We are desperately waiting for you.
Thank you. "
,kyle170,2013-04-21T02:35Z,@joegi50 Thanks for the feedback.... I'll be doing a full 720p HD version soon. It will be around 3 months until I do so. Thanks again for providing feedback tho!
