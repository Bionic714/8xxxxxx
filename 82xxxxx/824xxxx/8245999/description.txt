I wanted a ultra compressed 720p version of House MD for my mobile devices and PC. So, I compressed and encoded all of the included episodes (All of season 1-3) and organized them very nicley. This was done more for me than others, but I will share my conveniences to you :)

I did this for you guys so that you may have a more organized and smaller version of the show at your fingertips instead of having to download 400GB.

**Please understand that, for the first week, seeds and downloads will be slow....but hang in there, the more of us there are, the better it gets!**
