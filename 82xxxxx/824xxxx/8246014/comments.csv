,nawzyah,2013-03-12T10:20Z,"Don't bother with this rip. It's bad.

The last second of each track is repeated on the next track."
,nawzyah,2013-03-12T10:23Z,"I lied, it's not on every track. It's only on track 3 & 6. But still, I'd find a better rip than this if I were you."
,djbryy,2013-03-12T15:53Z,"Thanks for the leak, yo!"
,minasat,2013-03-12T17:22Z,"It's a good enough rip.
Use goldwave or whatever soft to remove the repeated bits."
