After years as a country cop, Mattie (Pat Shortt) is teamed up with feisty female detective Sharon Kelly (Lesley Conroy) and struggles to adapt to the rough and tumble of city policing, but always manages to get his man, despite many comic misadventures.

Adding to his discomfort is the ridicule of smug fellow detectives, Tom and Felix, played by Alvaro Lucchesi and Sean McDonagh and the watchful eye of Superintendent O'Mara, played by Joe Taylor, who has his other eye on promotion.

Added to the mix is Mattie's demanding Mother, her friend Sister Philomena, his sophisticated flat mate Ross, and a rogues gallery of petty criminals, prospective girlfriends and giant chickens.
Programme One

A slip-up by Mattie means that he and Sharon miss out on the top job of guarding the minister. Consigned to rounding up two giant man-chickens, copious quantities of caffeine provide Mattie with the unexpected burst of energy needed to tackle the mystery of the cream cake and save the egg threatened minister.

Programme Two

A courtroom showdown sees Mattie out-wit his ex-girlfriend's solicitor only to draw the ire of the Super who begins to plot against him.

Mattie gets a new flat-mate and befriends a petty thief before stepping over the line while trying to sort out a dodgy mechanic.

Is this the Super's chance to send our hapless detective packing or will his partner Sharon save the day?

Programme Three

Mattie and Sharon are dispatched to deal with a particularly persistent shoplifter. Meanwhile, Mattie's interfering mother sets him up with a blind date, while Tom and Felix interview a man with a penchant for insulting the police. Mattie goes undercover with disastrous consequences for his fledgling love-life.

Programme Four

The death of an elderly business man looks like an open and shut case but Mattie has his doubts. To Mattie's (and especially his detective partner Sharon's) embarrassment, new flat-mate Ross proves to be quite the ladies man about town.

An exhibition of arty photos by two forensic snappers takes his mind off domestic life. Finally, a snoop around the dead man's furniture proves instrumental in proving Mattie's suspicions of foul play to be right on the money.
