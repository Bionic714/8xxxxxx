.: Plot :.
This new CW series is a spinoff from the hugely popular Aaron Spelling teen drama series Beverly Hills, 90210. The story centers on the Wilson family, who recently moved from Kansas to Beverly Hills and, like the WalshΓÇÖs did back when spandex and sideburns were all the rage, try to adjust to the ritzy California lifestyle. Annie Wilson (Shenae Grimes) and her brother Dixon (Tristan Wilds) attend West Beverly High, while their dad (Rob Estes) takes over as principal of the school. Their mom Debbie (Lori Loughlin) keeps busy by looking after HarryΓÇÖs recovering-alcoholic mother Tabitha (Jessica Walter).

Other characters include Naomi (AnnaLynne McCord), the resident Kelly Taylor (spoiled and rich, so more like Kelly T. in her early high school years). Ethan (Dustin Milligan) is the popular jock. Navid (Michael Steger) is an aspiring journalist who works at the schools daily newscast. And then thereΓÇÖs Silver (Jessica Stroup), the bad girl who has her own video blog.
