"Communion"

When paramedics rush in with a stabbing victim, 
Villanueva is stunned to realize that the 
patient is his own son, Nick. Now it's up to 
Sydney and Hooten to save the young man. With 
Ty's help, Sung attempts to restore a concert 
violinist's perfect pitch by removing an 
astrocytoma that is pressing on the musician's 
brain. And Buck receives a strange request from 
the donor in a failed kidney transplant.  

18/Slower+
Evolve... or die.

Enjoy :)
