[V],bubanee,2013-03-14T06:14Z,"@LMFMObros... 320 is a controlled bitrate known as CBR 
I use the V range as in V2 V1 V0 which is variable bitrate and takes more of the not needed out.
Variable especially V1 V0 are both better than 320. it's like the AVI to x264MP4... 
Smaller but yet better... that's why :)"
