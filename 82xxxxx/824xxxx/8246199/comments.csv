Regarding Wink - I once drove 800 miles, dropping everything, so I could hear Wink speak, in Canada.  I'd been that spell-bound by some of his writing.  No disrespect, but he totally didn't and doesn't get it.  Totally lost.  Unintentionally, like virtually all like him, he has re-made the Truth in his own image.  This is the single greatest book of Truth, Objectively (created Gandhi, MLK Jr, after literally Saving Tolstoy from suicide 1st) ever written:  http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/6523878/Gospel_in_Brief_-_Leo_Tolstoy_-_Made_a_young_lawyer_into_Gandhi The Gospel in Brief - Tolstoy. This week I hope to seed a good scan and an improved audiobook version."
