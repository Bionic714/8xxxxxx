[V],psspss,2013-03-12T05:22Z,"you get stuff faster from paid membership sites.. they ones that are public arent shutdown so easily it seems.. so yeh much I get often costs me I just nice to share it on publuc my conversions

and no I cant tell you where to look.. for obvious reasons.. Ive already answered many times how I convert stuff quickly.. it all depends on software with multicore encoding options and if you do 2 pass or not

2 pass is better if have water and fast scenes but constant always works for me and never notice a problem since most tv shows can encode fine on 800 but when use 1000 gives you more scope for faster scenes in it and wont pixelate as bad

mp4 take much longer to make it seems too.. pros and cons of formats and how you do it"
[V],rr-ne,2013-03-12T05:28Z,"I like mp4, so ill stick with evolve"
