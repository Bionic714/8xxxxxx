,izaDreama,2013-03-12T06:34Z,how is this real? even your own site (eztv.it) says this episode will be aired on the 17th
,Fonfon222,2013-03-12T07:22Z,@isaDreama: this is the low quality (512x288) that's pre-airing on the History's web site.  Low quality but perfectly watchable for anyone who doesn't want to wait one week before the HDVD release.
,izaDreama,2013-03-12T08:58Z,OH! i had no idea they do that. thanks for clearing it up

I wish it had been more graphic, but that's the wussie brits for you. 

I might just let this one ""age"" for a few days before I indulge myself so much in such a short time !"
