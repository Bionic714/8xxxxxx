So, here we are at Loch Lomond's fourth album, 'Dresses', and it's a spectacular, moving piece of work. Employing piano, cello, flugelhorn, vibraphone, dulcimer, banjo, belle plates and, perhaps most affectingly of all, some dazzling choral arrangements, 'Dresses' can be remarkably understated for an album flushed with so many orchestral characteristics.
