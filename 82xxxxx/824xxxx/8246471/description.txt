Jay Bolotin's eponymous debut was released in 1970 on the Commonwealth United label, and was met with boundless praise from the country aristocracy, with the likes of Merle Haggard and Porter Wagoner eulogising over his work, and Kris Kristofferson declaring the young Kentuckian "one of the three best songwriters in the country". This LP is a revelation, portraying a songwriter whose oeuvre is lodged somewhere between Townes Van Zandt and Leonard Cohen, with an extra dose of unearhliness thrown into the mix on the darkly reverberant 'Dear Father', 'Winter Woman' and the wonderful 'Jimmy's Got A Music Box'. Anyone interested in the history of alternative country should check in with this record, which arrives remastered and reissued for the first time since its initial very limited circulation. Highly recommended.
