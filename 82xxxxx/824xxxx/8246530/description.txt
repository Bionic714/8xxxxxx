It's till active & well seeded after almost 3 years

* I had the German DTS & sub for "The Voyage of the Dawn Treader (2010)" but it had several cuts through the movie between 3-7 secs, after I edited 3 I gave up and deleted. At 1H 26 min were about 3 cuts in 1 minute!
This was at least the third German bluray with lots of cuts through the whole movie I came across with.
We should boycott German blurays & DVD-s, don't buy, don't rent them. F*em bluray.de & amazon.de.
