The good:
 Supports 57 file formats; includes tools for ripping, burning, external recording, file conversion, and broadcasting; features are highly customizable; performs superbly; has a timer and alarm utility that can control other computer functions.

 The bad:
 No built-in MP3 encoding; playlists are misleadingly called "albums;" no device syncing option--not even with JetAudio MP3 players; interface can't be resized unless you switch skins.its apart i am using it for couple of years and i am satisfied with that comparatively VLC .at least it never blow your Laptop Built In Speakers lol


1-first of all install JAD6103_plus File. Which Is 11,904 Mb
2- Wait of 30 seconds atleast .
3- now Install Jad6_PLUS_VX_U file .the destination remains same as
 previously like Jet Audio .dont make changes on every thing set default.
4-Wait For 30 Seconds.
5-now install JAD 8011_Basic on 
Default Settings.

now the previous version is updated with latest version and the crack still works
with latest version you can view more formats and enjoy the full benefits of
Crown Jet Audio like converting making Albums audio trimming e.t.c.and if you wish to
update when its ask go ahead the crack still works . thanks
