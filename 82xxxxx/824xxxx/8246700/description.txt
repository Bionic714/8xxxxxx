ALBUM DESCRIPTION 

Day of the Dog is the second album by Australian hip hop group Bliss n Eso. It was released by Illusive Sounds in March 2006 as both vinyl and CD releases. The title of the album is a metaphor for Australian hip hop being the 'underdog' of the Australian music industry, and affirming that it is now time for it to rise up.
