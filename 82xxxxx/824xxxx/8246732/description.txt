FotoMagico lets you create professional slideshows from your photos and music with just a few, simple mouse clicks. It sports a very clean and intuitive yet powerful user interface. High image quality, fast performance, and user flexibility were some of the design goals for this application.

Create the most spectacular slideshows:

* Scale, move, rotate, zoom or pan around your images to highlight that 
  part that matters the most.

* Your slides fit together perfectly with the new, gorgeous transitions.

* Provide more meaning with subtle titles here and there.

Perform a breathtaking show:

* Your slideshow uses the best possible resolution of your presentation
   device.

* Use large displays, HDTV screens and other high resolution devices.

* Even on a VGA projector, your photos will look better with 
  FotoMagico.

Your audience will want to take it home:

* Burn DVDs of your slideshow with iDVD or Roxio Toast.

* Put your slideshow on the new iPod.

* Export in almost any QuickTime format.

Your audience will never fall asleep again.

What's New:

* Masks in the Stage are now correctly updated as various options like 
  size, position, zoom, or rotation are changed.

* Assigning masks via the popup menu now works correctly.

* Rotating masks used to be weird in some cases. Now it always
   behaves correctly.

* The zoom and rotation jog-wheels now behave correctly when
   working with masks.

* Resizing masks in the Stage by dragging the selection frame handles
   is now more reliable. Pressing the Shift key keeps a mask centered
   while resizing it.

* A mask selection frame is now drawn in blue, so it is more easily
   distinguished from a layer selection frame.

* The background and watermark layers are now once again displayed 
  correctly during authoring.

* Layout glitches in the Stage when adding or removing layers have
   been fixed.

* Ducking now respects manual audio fades with custom offsets.

* Ducking for movies now works again.

* Custom audio fades are now fixed when dragging or copying/pasting
   audio to a different location and those custom audio fades no longer
   work.

* File size limitations for uploading to YouTube have been removed.

* Make sure that the system doesn't go to sleep while an export is in
   progress.
 
* Make sure that pressing the spacebar key while we are editing a 
   numeric value in a textfield, actually starts preview playback instead
   of causing an invalid value error message.

* Make sure that deleting everything in a numeric textfield doesn't cause 
  FotoMagico to enter an invalid state. Instead revert to the previous 
  value.

* Made the file format more efficient for the OS X sandbox
   environment.

* A bug has been fixed where auto-expanded stacks (slides with 
  multiple layers) in the Storyboard occasionally failed to collapse again 
  when the mouse left the stack. Some users mistook this for an
  application freeze.

* Make sure that a full save is performed when the app is quit without
   first closing a document.

* The visibility and animation controls now display seconds tick-marks
   when a single slide is selected. This helps to position the fade-in or
   fadeout triangles more precisely.

* Various small fixes.
