This torrent contains the complete manuals, service bulletins and wiring diagrams etc for the Toyota Corolla AE101 and AE92.
It is Vol. 6 and Vol. 7 and comes as a 2 disc set.

UnRAR for two CD images which can be burnt to recreate the two CD's as delivered from Toyota. All text is in Japanese, but it's pretty easy to work out what you are looking at for most of it.
There are other volumes for the earlier AE92 and AE111 etc, but as I don't own these vehicles, this is all you get. :)

Details as follows: (machine translation)
