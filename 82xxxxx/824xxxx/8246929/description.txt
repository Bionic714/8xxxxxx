Ep 13: Lost Footage

PREMIERE: Sunday March 10, 10:00 pm
 
This lost footage special features supersized drama that did not make it into the season, including the never-before-seen early days of Reza and Lilly's friendship, Lilly's trip with Asa to see her favorite plastic surgeon, and an ultra-revealing look into the rumors about MJ's drinking problem.


Thanks to RKSTR for capping and sharing.

Enjoy!!!
