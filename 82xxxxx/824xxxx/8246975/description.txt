Bird's vocal style is probably comparable to Nelly Furtado and particularly K.T. Tunstall - She's able to use beautiful, quiet and tender notes, with higher snarl-like climaxes. Some of the songs on this album do sound slightly similar, but each is unique as well. 'Counting To Sleep' is a tense tale which builds up to a great climax. '6ft8' is just great, its got a really original composition and some lovely vocals.
The heartfelt and poignant 'The Circle' is another of my favourites and definitely one of the highlights of the album - I really love the guitar and Bird's intimate vocals on this album, as well as the climax. 'Blossoms In The Street' is a startling, radio-friendly song, very good. The loveliest songs on the album are certainly 'You Are Mine' and 'All For You', two love songs which are both simple yet deeply heartfelt.
