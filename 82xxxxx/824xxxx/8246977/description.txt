Winner of the prestigious Palme d'Or at Cannes in 1975, Chronicle of the Years of Embers portrays Algeria's struggle for independence from French colonial rule. The story follows a peasant's migration from his drought-stricken village to his eventual participation with the Algerian resistance movement, just prior to the outbreak of the Algerian War of Independence. It was also selected as the Algerian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 48th Academy Awards. A little better version than the original rip. Thanks to the original uploader! There's a slight difference in the A/R of the two files (712X328 - 624x326)that was already in the original rip
