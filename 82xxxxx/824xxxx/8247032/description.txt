In the film we see a man and a woman who casually met in hospital. 
She is a lawyer who has left the husband, and sees another man, while her former husband still loves her.
He, an actor of the Petersburg TYuZ, is a gay translator who, after the random meeting with her, is pursued by her image which frequently pops up in front of him. As a consequence, his relationship with a young boy no longer satisfies him.
Both he and she lose sight of the meaning of life, because of their own inability to see others and to see love, as perception relies on proximity instead of distance...
