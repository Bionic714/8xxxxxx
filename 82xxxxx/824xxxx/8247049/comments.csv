,MissAnaMatronic,2013-03-12T20:48Z,"I agree, Alyssa for president! no just kidding, Alyssa should win that damn crown grrrll. All T No Shade. And Coco is a fierce competitor, knowone can touch her when she performs, she isn so high energy, her two lip syncs she tore the house down. Those two are my little under dogs now, I intitally liked Rolaskatox before they started calling them selves that. I thought Detox would win and Roxxy was fierce now I dont agree on that so much, and Alaska is just so loveable and funny and sweet with a great eye for fashion, though I do think the eye is borrowed from Miss Needles but none the less I think both clown fuckers are just great talented human beings. Though the more I watch Detox, the more I am bored by his persoanlity which doesnt make his great costumes pop and quirky great lip syncs with his jaw movements, but he was my first pick for weeks but I have totally flipped and I have began to really dislike Roxxy, strangely enough. Roxxy and Detox do end up forming a relationship,i heard it from Ru in the preshow interview that two queens would get togethger this season or fall in love and two guesses on thats gonna be. Ro-   -Tox, I left out the Laska in the middle there so now they can call them selves Rotox, its a pretty strange love connection coz Roxxy is so damn loud and rude at times and Detox is quieter and seems to eat it all up, its weird how opposites can attract. though this is all my humbles opinion from a hugely dedicated fan mind yyou who owns and watches every season every few weeks over and over. I love Raven and Pandora Box for all time Queens. This seaosn really is lacking in personality a bit and went all for looks, they were right fishyiest season ever=boringest seaosn ever, though I still love it but when your pretty you seem to be lacking in personality that old adage has come true a little bit for seaosn 5. Go back to getting all size and shapes queens next time Ru. I have a secret fantasy of getting a sex change to be a man so then I can dress up like a girl and work as a drag queen, they wouldnt except a real physcological woman as Queens but Michelle Visage calls herself a queen so I guess I can too. Ha"
,MissAnaMatronic,2013-03-12T21:26Z,"Will Untucked be uploaded too or do I have to watch it all fuzzy like on logo tv.com. I dont live in America either people, you just download a hide my i.p address program, free and u can watch tv shows on the U.S sites that we cant get access too. Changed my life being able to watch all the shows I want streamed right from the american channels websites. We Australians dont play our shows on our websites, we are crap! "
,strgaza,2013-03-12T23:07Z,"can someone please upload the bonus scenes of the episode?people outside of the US (and trust, we are many..) cannot view them otherwise..."
