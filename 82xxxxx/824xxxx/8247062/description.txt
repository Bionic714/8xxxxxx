PREMIERE: Monday March 11, 8:00 pm

The ladies' trip to Paris wraps up with a boat ride down the Seine River, and an unlikely bond forming between Kim and Brandi. Back in Beverly Hills, Lisa begins planning her housewarming party/vow renewal with flamboyant party planner Kevin Lee, and Kyle scurries to prepare for her boutique opening. In a changing room during the big event, Kyle and Kim discuss Kim's erratic behavior in Paris, and Kyle wonders if she'll ever be able to trust Kim's sobriety.
