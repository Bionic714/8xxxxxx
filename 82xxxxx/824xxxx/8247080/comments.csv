  Not everyone will survive. An ancient alien race, known only as ""Reapers"", 
  has launched an all-out invasion leaving nothing but a trail of destruction 
  in their wake. 
  Earth has been taken, the galaxy is on the verge of total annihilation, and 
  you are the only one who can stop them. The price of failure is extinction.

  You are Commander Shepard, a character that you can forge in your own image. 
  You determine how events will play out, which planets to explore, and whom 
  to form alliances with as you rally a force to eliminate the Reaper threat 
  once and for all. How you wage this war is completely up to you: go into 
  combat with guns blazing or use cover to plan a more tactical assault. 
  Utilize your squad to full effect or take a lone wolf approach. Rain death 
  from a distance or go toe-to-toe with enemies using devastating melee 
  attacks. Mass Effect 3 will react to each decision you make as you play 
  through a truly unique experience of your own creation.

Thanks."

,Qronja,2013-03-31T20:42Z,"Well looks like I'm wrong, the DLC weapons are also there, but with an unbelievable bug: They don't come to your inventory as they should, instead, you have to buy them in game from Kassa Fabrications."
,dontpKaniC,2013-04-01T17:27Z,"What do you mean ""some DLC's work""? Do all the main DLC's work? (Omega, Citadel, Javik, Extended cut...)"
