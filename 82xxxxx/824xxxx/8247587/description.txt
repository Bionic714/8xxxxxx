Extra 1 : Hospital - Face of Courage

A plastic surgeon at Duke University Medical Centre in North Carolina operates on a man whose face was crushed at work. After five years and sixteen operations, his injuries have never healed. The bones in his face are infected and, if unchecked, could eventually reach his brain and kill him. Surgeons rebuild the patient's face using a muscle from his back.
