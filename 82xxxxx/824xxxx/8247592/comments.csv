[T],mikesanderspqrs,2013-03-12T17:12Z,"It'a a pleasure. I'm just so pissed off that I upload these CDs, loads of seeders in first couple of hours, then hardly any. In other words selfish bastards grab & do no sharing.
I've uploaded tons of CDs recently, and loads more are coming over next few months (I can only upload so much at a time cos of upload bandwidth. To see what I've given you, click on my username above."
