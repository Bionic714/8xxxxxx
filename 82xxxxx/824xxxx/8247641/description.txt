Storyline:
In 1979, the US Embassy in Iran is stormed by protesters who then take everyone there captive. But 6 members manage to get out and go to the Canadian embassy.
After a few months, the 6 are still there. And it's only a matter of time before the Iranians discover that 6 members of the embassy staff are missing.
So the CIA must find a way to get them out. And so far they can't come up with a way. Tony Mendez, an ex filtration expert comes up with a plan.
He will go in as a producer scouting for shooting locations for a movie and that the 6 are part of the production crew.
So he goes to Hollywood and with help from a friend, makes it appear that he is a producer. And the movie they're producing is called Argo.
Eventually he goes to Iran to tell them what they have to do.
