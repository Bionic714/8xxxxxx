,highresjunkie,2013-04-11T23:43Z,"I really appreciate how you include extras. Ive seen you do that with Lincoln 720p, Monster 720p, The Millennium Trilogy 720p, The Hunt for Red October 1080p and Django Unchained 720p. This is something most encoders do not do. Are there others that you've included extras with that I didn't list here?"
