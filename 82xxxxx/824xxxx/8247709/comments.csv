Just wanted to say thanks for all you guys do; you are absolute quality and I know the other guys/girls feel the exact same way.  Top notch.

Could you potentially post the new episode of Inside Combat Rescue?  Pretty sure part 5 came out tonight and I can't think of anything i'd rather watch.

Cheers"
