A story of the freewheeling passion of youth set in modern day Nepal. It captures the candid journey of love, dedication, kindness, creativity and compassion of four strangers, all geared to actualize their due dreams. As they near achieving their ultimate target, they no longer think about the challenges of every day obstacles but push their selves to break free from the shackles of their limitations and in a process touch the souls of many others.
