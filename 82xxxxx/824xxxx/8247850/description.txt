Ep 10: Reunion Secrets

PREMIERE: Monday March 11, 10:00 pm

Serving up never-before-seen moments from Season 1, Lisa Vanderpump and the SUR team speak candidly with Andy Cohen about the fights, fun, hook-ups, and heartbreaks that you didn't get to see, like Stassi and Kristen's bikini blowout, the secrets of Tom's hair, Jax's Speedo stuffing, the definition of "crymax," and Lisa discovers who on her staff wears "padded knickers."


Thanks to RKSTR for capping and sharing.

Enjoy!!!
