Q: Is this activation permanent?
A: The short answer is Yes. Technically this activates office for 180 days, but since it automatically reactivates it, you shall never have to re-activate. It will activate you for 180 days, than another, and than another, and another, and so on for eternity. There is no user interaction with this constant reactivation process, so rest assured that you won't have to worry about activation ever again.
