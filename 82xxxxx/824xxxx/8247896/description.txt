 : father and a loving mother. Her life would still be perfect--with only the :
 : tiny cracks of an angry junkie for a brother and a charming drunk with     :
 : shady underworld connections for an uncle to mar the otherwise flawless    :
 : whole.                                                                     :

 : But that's not what happened. Instead, those inconsequential decisions lead:
 : her to perform a good deed that puts her in the right place at the right   :
 : time to unleash a chain of events that brings a mysterious package to her  :

 : Suddenly forced to question everything she knows about herself and her     :
 : family, Ridley wanders into dark territory she never knew existed, where   :
 : everyone in her life seems like a stranger. She has no idea who's on her   :
