DMC is the next installment in the gothic Devil May Cry series, featuring a short-coiffed, fully aggressive Dante. Fans have been vocally negative about Dante's new look and aggressive attitude, but developer Ninja Theory hopes to breathe new life into the franchise without alienating longtime fans. Players string combos together using Dante's twin handguns and sword, along with angelic and demonic weaponry. Paths are locked off with supernatural obstacles until you clobber all the demonic aggressors in the area.
