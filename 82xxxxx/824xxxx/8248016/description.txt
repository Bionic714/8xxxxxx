From Wikipedia:

Doctor Fate is the name of several fictional characters in the DC Universe who are a succession of sorcerers. The original version of the character was created by writer Gardner Fox and artist Howard Sherman, and first appeared in More Fun Comics #55.

When the Justice Society of America was created for All Star Comics #3, Doctor Fate was one of the characters National Comics used for the joint venture with All-American Publications.

Aside from the annual JSA/JLA team-ups in Justice League of America, DC featured the original Doctor Fate in other stories through the 1960s and 1970s, including a two-issue run with Hourman in Showcase #55-56, two appearances with Superman in World's Finest Comics #208 and DC Comics Presents #23; an appearance with Batman in The Brave and the Bold #156; and a solo story in 1st Issue Special #9, written by Martin Pasko and drawn by Walt Simonson.

The character featured in a series of back-up stories running in The Flash from #305 to #313 written by Cary Bates and drawn by Keith Giffen, with Pasko taking over as writer in issue #306, aided by Steve Gerber from #310 to #313. In 1985, DC collected the back-up stories, a retelling of Doctor Fate's origin by Paul Levitz, Joe Staton & Michael Nasser originally published in Secret Origins of Super-Heroes, the Pasko/Simonson story from 1st Issue Special #9, and a Doctor Fate tale from More Fun Comics #56, in a three-issue limited series titled The Immortal Doctor Fate.

Following 1985's Crisis on Infinite Earths, Doctor Fate briefly joined the Justice League. A Doctor Fate limited series was released soon afterwards, which changed the character's secret identity. DC began a Doctor Fate ongoing series by DeMatteis and Shawn McManus in winter of 1988. William Messner-Loebs became the series' writer with issue #25.
