This galaxy is ancient, and its first intelligent life
was the civilization we call the Endless. Long before
our eyes gazed upon the stars they flew between them,
though all that remains of this people is what we call
Dust. A substance found scattered or in forgotten
temples, it once gave powers to admirals and galactic
governors.

,BeechPilot,2013-03-18T14:52Z,"Thanks for the Updates. Great Game !
Somehow, I have some issues after installation, that I find programming variables like ""%ModTime"" or similar instead of text. This happens already after the 1.0.60. 
Something to be considered before installation ?
Is my Visual C++ redistribution out of date or too recent ?"
