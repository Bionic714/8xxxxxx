,Serenifly,2013-03-13T00:00Z,Ha. Starcraft is currently downloading a 4GB patch. It's likely that this is really HoTS. It seems buying the game really only spares you downloading a large amount of data and properly integrates the expansion into the menus.
,Morphello,2013-03-13T00:39Z,"@ferothul, This is a stand alone copy of the game, patched to the most current point, with everything the original game contained, minus the campaign and cut scenes, but with the new heart of the swarm campaign and cut scenes.

,Hades85,2013-03-14T22:09Z,for those of u that think its fake cause the uploader mispelled u are totally wrong. its a perfect working copy. everything installs fine and if u already have a battle.net account just log in and play. it loads it up as if it were a digital copy. that is if u have a legit copy of wings of liberty. if not well then yer on yer own there. regardless just disable yer net connection and u can play offline campaign mode with no trouble. I am waiting for the cracked version before I play it but my friend that has legit copy of wings of liberty used this and hes able to play it just fine with no problems.
,waterbong,2013-03-15T01:31Z,"This is legit and installs ok but without a proper crack is still useless.  It auto updates to 2.6.  Offline mode is NOT AVAILABLE for the starter edition which is what this is.  If you disable your internet to keep from auto-updating the game will not launch.  Period.  It hangs at ""Updating Blizzard Launcher"".  If you enable the internet to launch the game then disable it before logging in to Battle.net you get auto-updated to 2.6 and get the ""Offline Mode Not Available For The Starter Edition"" message.  If you just leave the internet up altogether you get popups wanting you to upgrade to be able to play the campaign.

@Hades85
No you cannot just disable your internet and play the campaign in offline mode.

TLDR:
This is legit but still needs a crack as the OP stated."
,waterbong,2013-03-15T02:12Z,"OK after getting the crack provided by vaskots I was able to get it to work in offline mode.

1. Run crack
2. Enable net to launch game or it still won't launch
3. Disable net before logging into Battle.net
4. If done correctly Offline Mode will now work while the net is still disabled

However, I'm still not seeing a campaign for HotS.  I have 3 options under WoL which are New Campaign, Load and Tutorial.  I only have one option still under HotS which is Watch Movie.

I've tried the Save Game file from Vaskots but it tells me my version of WoL is not authorized to run it.

So at this point I'm not quite sure what to do.  Hopefully we'll get a good working crack shortly."

,Bakemyday,2013-03-17T04:14Z,"Hello fellow PirAtEs!!!

This is LEGIT and it works on ""Windows 8 Pro - 64Bits""

Steps on how to install:

1.1) Download this torrent

1.2) Download the Key generator from Razor911 aka ""sc2_keygenWOL.rar"" 324KB

1.3) Download a save file from HoS  aka ""Heart of The Swarm SAVE.rar"" 1.63 MB 

1.4) Download a downgradable patch aka “sc2 hots 2.0.5 downgradable EN-GB.rar” 105 MB


If you don trust me check ""sc2.nibbits./starcraft-ii-licence-generator-works-with-all-versions""    its from nibbits ... they are well known ...moving on!!!


1.5) Download Winrar or similar software

And we are done Downloading..lol..get into the next step


2) Yes, keep internet connection ON

3) Open the file - ""SC2-200-D1"" with Winrar and starting extracting to a ""place you like"" ... Sugestion = Same folder ""StarCraft II - Heart of the Swarm""

4)Now, open the Folder you extracted and run ""StarCraft II Setup"" ... press yes/install ... let it upgrade and download the missing data ((yes..you will still need to download extra content, like World of Warcraft)) 

5)while waiting to install, create a ""battlenet account"" for free

6)when instalation is 100% finished ... press NEXT, enter the game, use your Battlenet account

7) exit game and TURN OFF internet connection

8.1) Extract and Open sc2 hots 2.0.5 downgradable EN-GB.rar and REPLACE the folder UPDATES from the one inside  “Computer/Local Disk (C:)/Program Files (x86)/Starcraft II”

8.2) Same steps, this time REPLACE folder “Base24944” from the one in “Computer/Local Disk (C:)/Program Files (x86)/Starcraft II/Versions” – Also make sure the last folder starting with “BaseXXXXXX” is “Base24944”  ((if there is a number above..delete it))

9) Open sc2_keygen.rar and run keytro1.4x.exe, a video will appear, wait 8 seconds and press F2, wait 5 seconds and exit the program, if you enjoy see the video a little longer XD

10.1) Open Heart of The Swarm SAVE and move the SAVE file into Documents/Starcraft II/Accounts/number/Saves/Campaign/

10.2) Run the saved file + enter battle net account + off line mode … loading will start!!!

11) When mission is loaded press F10 -> END ->Restart Mission to see the cinematic and start from the the beginning

12) ENJOYYYYYYYY ---> Yes, Custom games and replay features work

REMENBER … this is my noob temporary solution … buy game if you like, blizzard is a god among games builder!!!!

PS: Everytime you start the game (from the saved file..as you save it) you can during the middle of the game to TURN ON the INTERNET. However, if you lunch game with NET ON ..it will update. IF that occurs, game will not work, just replace the “updates and Base” folders again.. and voilá!!"
