Heart of the Swarm, as it says on the box, is an expansion to StarCraft II and, as such, will require the original game in order to play. The singleplayer campaign for the game continues the story of Wings of Liberty, focusing this time on Kerrigan and her erstwhile Zerg.

Multiplayer, meanwhile, gains new units (including Terran Hellbats, Zerg Swarm Hosts, and Protoss Tempests) and some existing units have been updated with new capabilities. Additional features, including group and clan systems, unranked matchmaking, and global play (a relaxing of the regionlization that separated gamers in the previous release) look set to further revamp the multiplayer functionality.

"With Heart of the Swarm, our goal has been to expand on the multiplayer action and cinematic storytelling of Wings of Liberty," said Mike Morhaime, CEO and cofounder of Blizzard Entertainment. "Combined with features like unranked matchmaking and our new leveling system, this expansion elevates the StarCraft II experience for players of all skill levels."
