This torrent doesn't provide anything exceptional.Books in it are easily available in Internet. So I am grateful to those uploader ,whom I don't know in person and the real credit goes to them.

One last request,try to buy books instead of downloading,if conditions permit you.Otherwise,the art of writing books will fade away in course of time.
