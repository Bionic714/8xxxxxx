This album is brilliant. Its lyrics and music arrangements are excellent!! Lucio Dalla, from Bologna, Italy is one of the most important author/singer of Italy today.
I have this CD since it was first released and it is always a pleasure to play it again and again. Although it's a shame you cannot hear some of its samples. All of the songs are excellent specially: "Henna", "Rispondimi", "Domenica", "Cinema" and specially the genial "Treno". A highly recommended CD, if you can find it.
