Imagine mathematics, imagine with the help of mathematics, imagine new worlds, new geometries, new forms. This book is intended to contribute to grasping how much that is interesting and new is happening in the relationships between mathematics, imagination and culture. With a look at the past, at figures and events, that help to understand the phenomena of today. It is no coincidence that this volume contains an homage to the great Italian artist of the 1700s, Andrea Pozzo, and his perspective views. Theatre, art and architecture are the topics of choice, along with music, literature and cinema. No less important are applications of mathematics to medicine and economics. The treatment is rigorous but captivating, detailed but full of evocations, an all-embracing look at the world of mathematics and culture.
