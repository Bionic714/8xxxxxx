I Actually own box of first season, but either dvd player is not reading disc or it's freezing playback on other ones, cause some little scratches. Gees i'm tired of this media type. They came up with Blu ray ""disc"" player again, i just hope it's not gonna be some gay 1TB pink beam disc player next time, lol."
