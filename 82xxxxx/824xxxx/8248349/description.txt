When his brother Jack suggests to have Dolores murdered, Judah is faced with a big moral dilemma: destruction of his life or murder. Meanwhile, documentary filmmaker Clifford Stern is trying to make a film of a philosophy professor, but instead heâ™s commissioned to make a portrait of successful TV producer and brother-in-law Lester, who to Clifford represents everything that he despises.
