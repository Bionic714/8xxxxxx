,nikitan1,2013-03-20T22:31Z,".. sorry, but I dont agree, for the following reasons: DHT doesnt work for everybody, even if enabled + sometimes these 2 default trackers of TPB are not reachable + sometimes ISP blocks known trackers + sometimes the connection is heavily censored, so it is needed to use a VPN, so its needed a list of working trackers.. and so on, do you need more reasons?"
