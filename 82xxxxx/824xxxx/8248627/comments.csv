,bert16,2013-03-16T04:40Z,In the past what I didn't like about this uninstaller is that it didn't create installation logs like some others do. Has this problem been fixed?

Seems to work great but there's a bit of a learning curve and here's some tips:

When you choose the super Uninstall option the program gives a message something like (whatever) has been completely removed from your computers, however the uninstall wizard window remains open.... it's STILL WORKING even if it APPEARS to be stalled.. if you watch it for a couple of minutes you'll see the files it's scanning on that dialog box.... just let it works, it doesn't take but a couple of minutes on XP Pro.

IF you stopped before (whatever) was completely uninstalled OR you attempted to uninstall manually or via another uninstaller (and thus the offending program isn't listed), just reinstall the same version of whatever program you're trying to uninstall if you can get it or even another version of the offending program THEN run the uninstaller again in the Super Uninstall mode."
