Everything Live is an edited recording of the Welsh rock band Manic Street Preachers 

performing at the Manchester NYNEX on 24 May 1997. Accompanying the album Everything Must 

Go, it captures the band's triumphant comeback following the mysterious vanishing of their 

iconic lyricist Richey Edwards and their transition to a major band. On the Tenth 

Anniversary Edition of Everything Must Go, bassist Nicky Wire cites the concert as the 

moment he knew that the band had "made it".

The recording was released as a VHS video on 29 September 1997, and has only been reissued 

on DVD in Japan. This is it.
