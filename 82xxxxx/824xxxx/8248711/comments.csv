 Game information:
 =================

 Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2 is the only multi-platform,  first-person,  modern
 shooter exclusively designed around the sniper experience.  It  takes  the
 bulls-eye precision of  its  predecessor  to  new  and  exciting  heights,
 offering more diverse sniper challenges;  a  rebuilt  AI  system  and  the
 thrilling ""one shot, one kill"" precision that made  the  original  a  huge
 hit, selling 3 million copies worldwide. Taking advantage of the  advanced
 capabilities of the CryENGINE3, Sniper:  Ghost  Warrior  2  also  delivers
 striking graphic environments.


 Features:
 =========
 * Motion Sense Trigger System: an innovative first in which the way the
   player touches the controller influences the on-screen shot. Like in
   real-world sniping, in-game shooting requires a steady squeeze of the
   pad's trigger so that when the round is fired, the rifle is more
   accurate. Jerk the trigger and the round is thrown off, thus missing the
   target and alerting a highly motivated enemy to your presence.
 * Realistic Ballistics: the hallmark of the Sniper franchise is the
   realism of its shooting dynamics. Wind speed, distance, gravity and
   bullet-drop all play critical roles in the performance of your shot.
 * Refined Shooting Mechanics: a proper breathing technique to steady your
   heart rate is as important as calculating the time on target of your
   round, and the best snipers control both their heart and their head.
   From acquisition of target until the slow steady trigger pull, a sniper
   must pull together everything to achieve the ideal ""one shot; one kill.""
 * Improved Enemy AI: the Artificial Intelligence (AI) system was
   completely re-tooled and designed from scratch. Much of the improvements
   were made possible from the switch to the CryEngine 3. Expect everything
   from flanking movements to frontal assaults as the enemy tries to engage
   you in close quarters where your rifle is less effective.
 * New Target-Rich Environments: Sniper Ghost Warrior 2 adds new urban
   environments like Sarajevo and treacherous mountain terrain to go along
   with jungles that are as lush and deadly as ever.
 * Various Difficulty Levels: To diversify gameplay and make it accessible
   to the widest group of gamers, CI Games is introducing three difficulty
   levels that totally change the nature of the game. You decide how to
   play - either relax and be the ultimate predator or test your skill and
   experience the game on Expert Mode.
 * Bullet-Cam: everyone's favorite feature returns to reward expert shots
   and show the battlefield from a totally new viewpoint. See what the
   transfer of kinetic energy - a bullet's true stopping power - can do to
   the enemy from 1000 meters or more!
 * Bullet Penetration: concealment doesn't necessarily mean cover. In
   Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2, bullets behave as they would in real life and
   are able to dispatch enemies hiding behind various types of covers. You
   can also try to line up your enemies and let a single round take out an
   entire squad. Wait 'til you see that on Bullet Cam!
 * Expanded List of Sniper Rifles: Try out the world's most advanced sniper
   rifles, each of them meticulously recreated so that they accurately
   simulate the modern weaponry found on today's battlefields.
 * New Gear: own the night with the introduction of thermal and night
   vision optics, plus a pair of powerful binoculars critical for locating
   the enemy before they spot you.
