,arielmansur,2013-03-13T00:04Z,"davideassis it must be because of directx, you have to had direct 11 to do that :)"
,saidinho,2013-03-13T00:53Z,"works perfect and very short too....,but awesome"
,rusmafia,2013-03-13T01:43Z,"works great, no virus only alot of Carlsberg and Tuborg.... cant wait for my steam pre-order on 15.03.2015 to be released.. , so a big thanks to FLT.... HEY GAMEMAKER, YEAA U, how'a'bout you rls the game on steam when its already pirated ....

Well gamemakers, dont give a c.r.a.p Inc.

Remember to add everything to HIGH+ in grafics, if ya pc can handle that, way more better, but, it pisses me off that in the start SP mission, your buddie just runs and runs, i guess GAMEMAKERS forgot to see how MOH2010, BF3 did singleplayer missions... could be alot better, but again, stunning grafs  4/5 .... Looking forward to MP team Coop and possible DLC .

Yes iam a pirate, but i support game developers who kick more than stunning ass .

Enjoy ya game"
,paulboscu,2013-03-13T02:21Z,"hey the game works great except the frame rate freezes once in a while for a few seconds,and yes my system can handle the game on medium settings.any ideas anyone?"
,standstill2142,2013-03-13T04:40Z,thanks man
,paulboscu,2013-03-13T07:42Z,"Found a possible fix for the problem i'v been having,thought I'd share,perhaps help somebody else:Just change the desktop resolution to whatever resolution you use in-game before starting the game,as soon as I did that the frame rate issue disappeared."
,Bunnies,2013-03-13T08:12Z,"When I try to run the game, Steam tries to open. It says that it must be online in order to run, but I have it blocked in my firewall settings. Anybody else run into this problem?"
,Bunnies,2013-03-13T08:14Z,"Ha, nm. Might help if I copied the files to my Bin32 directory. I followed the installation instructions to the letter, they just failed to mention copying the files. Should've looked harder before I posted a comment."

Multumesc mult. L-am instalat si functioneaza perfect."
,paulboscu,2013-03-13T16:03Z,"@davideassis

In the graphics settings go to the advanced section and manually set the options there to very high the apply the settings.It doesn't seem to matter if in the basic menu the setting is set to high because the options in the advanced section seem to stick.At least they did for me as I used this metod to change the settings to medium."

,Magestrix,2013-03-16T22:56Z,"@davideassis I think your graphics card needs to support DX11. Most people have the latest DirectX, but like Crysis 3 - if the card doesn't support DX11, it might just not work.

Just a thought."
,paulboscu,2013-03-17T12:11Z,"@ Magestrix 
No this game does not require a DX 11 video card,I myself am playing it on an Nvidea 220 GT on medium settings without any problems."
,Magestrix,2013-03-17T13:33Z,@paulboscu I am aware of that. But it was the Very High graphics option I was refering to.
,Belisiario,2013-03-17T13:53Z,What's language of game?

,weeee123,2013-04-01T03:50Z,Why is everyone seeding less then 5kb.  Seed 50 atleast it will help everyone download faster and seed to you.  It doesnt kill ur download speed if u set it to 50 it only affects it at like 300 but you should do that unless ur finished.  Everyone who is downloading this if you just set ur seed speed to atleast 50 we would finish so much faster.
