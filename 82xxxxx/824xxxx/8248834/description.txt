Game information

Sniper Ghost Warrior 2 is the only multi-platform,  first-person,  modern
shooter exclusively designed around the sniper experience.  It  takes  the
bulls-eye precision of  its  predecessor  to  new  and  exciting  heights,
offering more diverse sniper challenges;  a  rebuilt  AI  system  and  the
thrilling "one shot, one kill" precision that made  the  original  a  huge
hit, selling 3 million copies worldwide. Taking advantage of the  advanced
capabilities of the CryENGINE3, Sniper  Ghost  Warrior  2  also  delivers
striking graphic environments.


Features

* Motion Sense Trigger System an innovative first in which the way the
  player touches the controller influences the on-screen shot. Like in
  real-world sniping, in-game shooting requires a steady squeeze of the
  pad's trigger so that when the round is fired, the rifle is more
  accurate. Jerk the trigger and the round is thrown off, thus missing the
  target and alerting a highly motivated enemy to your presence.
* Realistic Ballistics the hallmark of the Sniper franchise is the
  realism of its shooting dynamics. Wind speed, distance, gravity and
  bullet-drop all play critical roles in the performance of your shot.
* Refined Shooting Mechanics a proper breathing technique to steady your
  heart rate is as important as calculating the time on target of your
  round, and the best snipers control both their heart and their head.
  From acquisition of target until the slow steady trigger pull, a sniper
  must pull together everything to achieve the ideal "one shot; one kill."
* Improved Enemy AI the Artificial Intelligence (AI) system was
  completely re-tooled and designed from scratch. Much of the improvements
  were made possible from the switch to the CryEngine 3. Expect everything
  from flanking movements to frontal assaults as the enemy tries to engage
  you in close quarters where your rifle is less effective.
* New Target-Rich Environments Sniper Ghost Warrior 2 adds new urban
  environments like Sarajevo and treacherous mountain terrain to go along
  with jungles that are as lush and deadly as ever.
* Various Difficulty Levels To diversify gameplay and make it accessible
  to the widest group of gamers, CI Games is introducing three difficulty
  levels that totally change the nature of the game. You decide how to
  play - either relax and be the ultimate predator or test your skill and
  experience the game on Expert Mode.
* Bullet-Cam everyone's favorite feature returns to reward expert shots
  and show the battlefield from a totally new viewpoint. See what the
  transfer of kinetic energy - a bullet's true stopping power - can do to
  the enemy from 1000 meters or more!
* Bullet Penetration concealment doesn't necessarily mean cover. In
  Sniper Ghost Warrior 2, bullets behave as they would in real life and
  are able to dispatch enemies hiding behind various types of covers. You
  can also try to line up your enemies and let a single round take out an
  entire squad. Wait 'til you see that on Bullet Cam!
* Expanded List of Sniper Rifles Try out the world's most advanced sniper
  rifles, each of them meticulously recreated so that they accurately
  simulate the modern weaponry found on today's battlefields.
* New Gear own the night with the introduction of thermal and night
  vision optics, plus a pair of powerful binoculars critical for locating
  the enemy before they spot you.
