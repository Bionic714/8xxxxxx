,Traviss63,2013-03-12T21:49Z,I have Sirius but I never get to listen to the whole show in the car unless I'm taking a long trip. Thank you so much for all the effort if it weren't for you (and your team?) I wouldn't be able to get my weekly Stern fix. Wushdishmeen? It means you're the shit! Thanx a bunch

He cuts out all the Sirius bullshit and keeps only the show -- no commercials! Perfect to put on your iPad if you want to listen to it later -- works in a car too :)"
