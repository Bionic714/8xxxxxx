There are SACD iso's out there that would yield a better 24/88 (or /172) quality."
,jkjk0001,2013-03-13T04:16Z,numerous experiments and blind tests show that people can hear the difference only up to 256 kbps. higher than 256kbps sounds all the same.

,Zarnivups,2013-03-14T08:15Z,"you prolly cant hear any difference from crappy mp3's and flac's on your crappy cheap pc speakers, but try to listen to the music on a proper stereo setup"
,Rab13,2013-03-30T10:06Z,"Jeep,  there is a huge difference between 16 bit and 24 bit at 48khz ...48DB of dynamic range to be exact which = a higher quality file with less quantization errors in the digital conversion.  It'd be nice if you weren't such a whiner and you thanked the guy for the uploads rather than complaining about it... you should go buy them if you want 96k yah jerk off.  

in regard to the 256k comment that's just retarded too... there is a huge and noticeable difference between 256k and 1411k, the numbers alone are a red flag here and when a file is converted from 1411 to 256 much of the low end is what is sacrificed to get the file down in size.  

Now finally thanks for the upload! "
,Rab13,2013-03-30T10:10Z,"FYI Zarnivups,  FLAC files are not crappy they are losslessly compressed wav files so once decompressed they are a wav file once again with no loss in quality.  It's kind of like how you can zip something into an archive folder then unzip it with no change in the file.  

Anyway thanks again for your uploads "
,Zarnivups,2013-04-01T09:54Z,"I know very well that FLAC are lossless, the crappy was about the mp3's. Enjoy the DM albums."
