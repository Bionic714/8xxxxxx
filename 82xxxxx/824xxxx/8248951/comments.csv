,bjornagainswede,2013-03-13T07:23Z,Will this work on WIndows XP????
,adaoraul,2013-03-13T20:35Z,"@7117 I'm not forcing you to download, stupid!"
,ClubQBall,2013-03-13T21:59Z,"@adaoraul - While what you said may be true ... you should've STILL done a search on how many other uploaders have posted THE SAME EXACT GODDAMNED THING.

All you're doing is wasting even more of TPB's bandwidth."
,DefconOne,2013-03-14T13:34Z,"I'm with ClubQBall on this one. 

It helps us all if you check first."
