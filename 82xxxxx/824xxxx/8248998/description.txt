Hapgood translation.

This is Tolstoy's translation of the original Greek texts of the Gospels which he did, seeing a psychology, a theory of Life, that would save him from the suicide he was otherwise determined to commit, all other theories of life, all other psychologies having failed him.

NOTICES:  Read with high quality ScanSoft voice Daniel.  Don't like that?  Don't download it.  Don't complain.  Don't get in the way.

Had this book not been written:

1.  TOLSTOY:  Tolstoy would have committed suicide, rather than writing this, and a series like it, from his 50th year until is death 32 years later. 

2.  GANDHI:  We would not know the name Gandhi.  The young law student would have been an anonymous lawyer in India for the rest of his life.  Instead he read Tolstoy's follow-on book to this, "The Kingdom of God is Within You," see this site UnviolentPeacemaker, and, well, the rest is history.

3.  MARTIN LUTHER KING Jr: As a seminarian at Crozer Dr. King was first acquinted with nonviolence reading Tolstoy's "The Law of Love and the Law of Violence" (see this site UnviolentPeacemaker), also a follow-on writing to this "The Gospel in Brief."  Dr. King became a passionate student of Gandhi, the man that Tolstoy created, all starting with this book.
