,phase700b,2013-03-13T23:32Z,"Sorry, I misunderstood what you were looking for."
[V],HighCode,2013-03-14T00:09Z,"Lol, I encode to quality not to size. A longer movie obviously needs bigger size then a shoter movie.
A 16/9 (1920/1080) movie again needs bigger size & higher bit-rate then a 1920/816 or 192/800 movie.
I misunderstood the comment as well :-)

,TheLathe,2013-03-14T07:32Z,"Just curious...

But, if you are already transcoding the Audio, why not keep the entire DTS core @1500...?  Why chop it down to half that...?  It can't possibly take up THAT much more room with a file size this big.

I'm truly just curious why you would not just keep the full DTS core?

Thanks High Code!"
,TheLathe,2013-03-14T07:38Z,"For example, here is a post of this film from the Blu-ray I think; the size is 7.95 Gigs, which is common, and the fellow here used the entire DTS core @1500 and his file size is almost half this one.  

Don't get me wrong, like you said yourself here on this thread, the QUALITY is of the utmost importance, and I fully agree with you!  But, shouldn't that also be true of the Audio...?

Here is that post:

For me personally, I almost ALWAYS try to go for rips with the full DTS bit rate if possible; seeing half that rate here would make me personally go for the one I copied here to get the full sound, since the excellent .264 codec on 2 passes does such an outstanding job with the video.

Please keep up the good work; I just wanted to mention this to you about the Audio.

Thanks!!!"
[V],HighCode,2013-03-14T09:38Z,"I trans-code from the full dts-hd, not from the core, meaning DTS-HD to wav (huge file) then encode to DTS 768.
DTS-HD MA tracks vary between 2.5 GB-5 GB.
You make some tests yourself, mux in mka (without video, just 2 audio tracks) my DTS 768 & the dts core 1500 from an other torrent and switch between the sounds while playing. 
The smaller the size the better for me at least, and in most cases I don't detect quality difference between DTS-HD vs DTS @ 768. I backup my movies by uploading them here lol, I already lost 3 external drives and only could save the files from one drive. Not ones I had to download my own torrent from here (to watch with a friend) because I lost my copy. I make these remuxes because I encode the huge BD-s first to empty space on my HDD-s quicker. These small remuxes are on waiting list to be encoded after I finished with the 30-50 GB BD-s.
Finally if you got a hyper super surround system & player & speakers I suggest you rent or buy the BD-s instead of wasting here your time and mine."
,TheLathe,2013-03-14T22:04Z,"Heh, now now, no one is wasting anyone's time.  I took great pains to express my appreciation for your work.  I'm sorry that you lost your HDD's, that must be a total bitch for sure!

I am NOT being critical of your methods at all, but I was just asking you that since I've noticed that most the people here use the full DTS core (you notice that almost all here use the Audio @1500) and the fact that your file size would be considered pretty big anyway AND the fact that there MUST be very LITTLE difference in size between  750 and 1500, I was just ASKING if there was a specific reason why you did that since most here do not.

Now, if you were one of the guys who ripped all their BRs to like 2 and 3 Gig files, I wouldn't have bothered you about it.  But dude, you are rendering a NICE healthy 13 Gigs here my friend; I'm only saying that using the full DTS core @1500 couldn't POSSIBLY add that much to your file size.

BUT...  If for some reason that is the way you want to do it personally, then I respect that and I honestly do NOT mean to complain.  But, for those specific reasons that I mention above, I just couldn't see why you would go out of your way to save such a small amount of space if you are going to all the trouble to render such excellent full quality video sizes, that''a all   : )

Now, don't take it personally; I was just asking....

I ALWAYS thank you profusely for all your work here!"
,TheLathe,2013-03-14T22:14Z,"I also wanted to compliment you that you use the full 1920x1080 and you didn't chop the black bars off to save a little space.  That way, I can play it as an actual Blu-ray on my stand alone OPPO player with the right AR!

Thanks!"
[V],HighCode,2013-03-15T04:35Z,"Ok, I'm glad you appreciate my time and effort..
Here are the reasons why not many add DTS 768:
- Very few folks tested/compared DTS tracks on their systems so they think ""the higher the rate the better period""...and will never make tests because are too lazy,  they trust in theory more then in practice.
- Some who are convinced that on their system DTS 768 will do just fine and would prefer it 768 to DTS 1500+ but they don't know how to or have no time to trans-code it,  too much hassle, too much CPU and time consuming.
- Some of them would prefer DTS 768 but then private hd sites wouldn't welcome his torrent with applause. But I don't give a fuck, this is how I like them and share them with those who are happy to have them as they are.

Two of my mates encoders/uploaders don't even have a 5.1 system at home but they add DTS 1500+ in their torrents just to avoid bad mouth-criticism and because it is too much work.

DTS-HD makes a difference only if you listen very loud, but then most of us have neighbours so honestly I don't see why the whole fuss about it.

Music is much more sophisticated and needs much higher bit-rate then mainly dialogues & some car engines from most movies  (excluding action and sci-fi with special effects of course).
 But interesting that mp3 320 is perfectly fine for 99% of the people. "
,TheLathe,2013-03-15T08:46Z,"Very interesting...  Well, you've clearly given this a lot of thought and I agree that a person should really TEST, like you say, in real terms how something actually looks or sounds on their system and not just go by the 'higher number'  That is an excellent point.

I certainly didn't know that you actually had to take EXTRA time and effort just to achieve the 768 rate as opposed to just copy and pasting the 1500.  Quite interesting.  Well, you must certainly feel pretty strongly about that if you actually go to all the extra trouble and time to transcode it!
: )

Thanks again.  Oh, and to repeat what I just put on your 'LAWNMOWER MAN' post, EXCELLENT choice!

Cheers!"
