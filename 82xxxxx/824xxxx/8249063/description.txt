Book 1 - Going Under by Georgia Cates 
Jessie Boone is a self proclaimed bad boy and doesnΓÇÖt march to the beat of anyoneΓÇÖs drum, but his own. Growing up in less than desirable circumstances has made him no stranger to the hard knock life and his determination to leave it behind is fierce. When he finds himself transferred to East Franklin High School, he sees his opportunity to use his athletic ability to snag a college football scholarship, but Forbes Henderson, the player Jessie means to replace isnΓÇÖt giving up his spot willingly. In fact, Forbes is willing to go to extreme measures to retain his place as first string quarterback. When ForbesΓÇÖ malicious plan to injure his replacement fails, Jessie is furious and determined to show him he messed with the wrong person; not only is he going to take the position of first string quarterback, heΓÇÖs going to take his girl, too. 

Claire Deveraux is perfection at itΓÇÖs best. She is beautiful, intelligent and unaware she just became Jessie BooneΓÇÖs conquest as revenge against her boyfriend, Forbes Henderson. Like her flawless performance as the perfect daughter and student, ClaireΓÇÖs production of being the perfect girlfriend has everyone fooled, except Jessie Boone, and she fears this tattooed bad boy will see her secret desire to explore his crude threats and promises to rock her perfect world. If she decides to give in to one uninhibited moment with Jess. 

Book 2 - Shallow by Georgia Cates 
Payton Archer's best friend, Claire, strives to be perfect in every way. Payton doesn't and this is her story.

Nick Hawke likes his car fast and his girls even faster. He blows through females quicker than his muscle car races down the "The Strip" in Collinsville and he wouldnΓÇÖt have it any other way. Determined to avoid the devastation he has watched his father endure in the aftermath of his mother leaving, he believes there is no room in his life or his heart for a relationship lasting more than one night. He seeks happiness in things that wonΓÇÖt let him down...fast cars, adrenaline and one night stands. To his absolute dismay, all of that changes when he unexpectedly runs into an old friend and is introduced to Payton Archer, the first girl he ever wanted for more than one night. ThereΓÇÖs only one catch...she is completely immune to him and his smooth talking ways.

Payton Archer is looking for what Claire has with Jessie, but she has given up on finding it...at least until she leaves for college in the Fall because she is certain that is where she will find the perfect guy to fit into her perfect world. She plans on Summer being nothing but three uneventful months of fun, but it turns out to be anything but ordinary when Payton is introduced to Nick Hawke, one of JessieΓÇÖs old Collinsville friends. She is shocked by her immediate and intense attraction for ΓÇ£HawkeΓÇ¥ because nothing about him is what Payton is looking for. Sure, heΓÇÖs hot and sexy but he comes from Collinsville and that is definitely not on her list of prerequisites. Everything about him makes PaytonΓÇÖs heart speed because he is exciting and dangerous, but his fast car and the dangerous chances he takes aren't what scares Payton the most...itΓÇÖs the way Nick Hawke makes her feel every time he looks at her. Can Payton find that moment of total fearlessness and make the decision to leave the safe, shallow end of love to risk going under completely?
