"IΓÇÖm finding Sphoxie to be quite challenging, but in a good way. It makes you think before jumping off a platform, and you have to think of ways to avoid being hugged to your doom. If 3-D platformers are your thing, then you donΓÇÖt want to miss Sphoxie." - appadvice.com

"The first thing that caught my attention were the graphics, which mix 3-D with the pixelated look. The game is powered by the Unreal Engine, so the 3-D is actually done very well. Everything from our spiky friend to the colorful and vibrant environments, to the cubed enemies, will look great on your Retina iDevices." 4/5 appslooking.com 


In Sphoxie you must help our little spikey blue spherical dude get back home after a portal sucked him to a strange cube world.
