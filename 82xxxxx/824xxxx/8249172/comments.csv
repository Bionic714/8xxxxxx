They're not old enough to watch it now, but I intend on saving these until they are.  I will definitely seed!  And if you have any more, PLEASE upload them as well."

I also have two other old school-typish dvds:
-40 years of sunny days (part 1 and 2)
-Sesame Street, 20 years and counting.

I will also be purchasing old school vol 3 which completes that set.  Look for all to be released over time."
