Remember that good old days? This Extreme 3D was my first 3D software.

Mar. 1, 1996 
Macromedia =Extreme 3D, the successor to MacroModel. It should be 
shipping by the time you read this. Extreme 3D is a polygonal surface modeler that uses spline-based modeling and familiar 2D drawing tools to create its models (see screen 4). Although it's billed as CAD-accurate to 15 decimal places, the strength of Extreme 3D is really in organic modeling. The accuracy and drawing tools in Extreme 3D are serious competition for the other programs in this mini-roundup, but the program's interface in the Beta 3 version I reviewed seriously hampers it.
