ISBN: 1585426520 | 2008 | EPUB

The Art of Being: 101 Ways to Practice Purpose in Your Life helps readers become inspired and stay inspired, with motivational and uplifting writings that can be read daily, supported by "Mindfulness Practices," or action steps to make it simple. Ultimately, the understanding at which the reader will arrive is that spirituality, the "art of being," is actually a lifestyle, a way of walking our sacred earth every day. The Art of Being is a user-friendly manual to guide you to become acutely aware of how to live more mindfully on a day-by-day, hour-by-hour, moment-by-moment basis and thus create more peace and happiness in your life-and in the lives of those around you.
