Sorry for my rants script kiddies like you fuckin tools piss me off...Symantec is garbage i swear half of you idiots cant use google and the other half cant read."
,pneuma11,2013-03-19T20:42Z,"Symantec uses a garbage mutating heuristic called bloodhound which is trash i might add... If you actually watch what it does: it isn't much. The two leading algorithms are from kaspersky and trendmicro and they are still trash... And viruses, worms, trojans those little pesky things you are so worried about are virtually ineffective in today's cyber environment. Malware is what you get infected with... Non-in the wild scripts... That people with a little bit of coding knowledge can write in notepad++ so take your symantec and shove it up your ass!"
