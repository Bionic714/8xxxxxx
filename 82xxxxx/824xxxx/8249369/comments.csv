,ryxanmar,2013-03-15T18:51Z,Is this the full version or the demo? Because I appear to have demo limitations.
,Kagamine313,2013-03-15T20:37Z,"It's the full game, If you installed the demo beforehand maybe uninstall that and it will become fixed. If all else fails just purchase the game from steam."
