You've got to be some sort of cunt to come on here spoiling the result.YES carlos7667 I'm talking about you!!!"
,malanaice,2013-03-13T06:52Z,"played the video a bit while its downloading....commentary is in arabic or something. In vlc it does show two audio tracks, english also there but even after selecting english it sounds arabic. Will let part 1 finish downloading completely and check."

,Happy_In_Kaohsiung,2013-03-13T10:13Z,"Here is an .avi rip from Sky Sports 2 last night,full English commentary as you'd expect from Sky Sports ;-)  http://fenopy.se/torrent/ucl+barcelona+v+ac+milan+03+apr+2012/ODEwNzUyNA"
,Happy_In_Kaohsiung,2013-03-13T10:20Z,And it downloaded in less than 2 hours.Happy Days! :-)
,Happy_In_Kaohsiung,2013-03-13T12:42Z,"Fucking bollocks.Ignore the link,it's from last year,even the torrent file says 12/3/2013.

I'd got all showered and settled down to watch it,didn't notice anything wrong until I saw Ibrahimovic in the Milan line up!

Absolutely GUTTED."
[V],Nepotu,2013-03-13T14:14Z,"Well, I supposed the ripper's (ro7man) description was right (english version). I didn't watched this version (only the spanish version). So, this might have dual audio streams (arabic and english). Check this out!
Why do you need so bad an english version? The spanish version is very good quality, 720p and 50fps.
I don't promise anything but I'll try to up a smaller english version if anyone else doesn't until then."
