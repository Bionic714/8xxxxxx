i was looking at uncanny x-men 1 variant covers. does anyone happen to know if hastings sells the variants they have as exclusive at a marked-up (high) price, or are they getting variants for customers with a pull-list at their stores?

the reason i ask, hastings is technically the only comic shop in my town ... but i actually buy comics at one of the shops in the big city."
[V],RubrumPopulus,2013-03-13T04:23Z,AFAIK They sell them not much over cover price in their retail locations.  Between 5 and 10 bucks depending on the comic.
