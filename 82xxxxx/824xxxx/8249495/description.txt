The Little House That Stood was released on March 5, 2013 and is a Veggie retelling of the Three Little Pigs and the Parable of the Wise and the Foolish Builders. When the three pigs come to town searching for a building contractor, they find that Larry the Cucumber builds with hay, Mr. Lunt builds with sticks, but only Bob the Tomato follows plans from the Master Builder's Handbook. The lesson is about making good choices. The video also includes a bonus story about what happened before Humpty cracked (originally titled "The Good Egg of Gooseville").
