Six friends, who've known each other from childhood,
break into the tower block they lived in as kids,
now deserted and condemned, to rig-up a pirate radio
station, get high and party. When one of the group
goes missing, her friends begin to search the dark
interior of the tower and soon realize that they are
not alone: a resident psychopath lurks in the shadows
and is hunting them down, taking them out, one-by-one.
