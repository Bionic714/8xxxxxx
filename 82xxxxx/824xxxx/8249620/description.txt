Plot:
The basketball coach Clyde and his wife Stephanie divorced a couple of months ago and their
teenage daughter Hannah and the girl Emily 'Em' live with their mother and spend the weekends
with their father. One day, Clyde stops his car in a yard sale and Em buys an antique carved
box and becomes obsessed with it. Em finds the hidden lock and releases an evil spirit that
possesses her. Soon Clyde discovers that Em has a problem, but his annoying ex-wife and her
boyfriend Brett do not pay attention to him and get a restraining order against Clyde. Clyde
seeks out Professor McMannis and when he sees the box, he explains that it is a Dibbuk Box,
where a fiend is trapped inside. He also explains that the box should not be open; otherwise
the person will be possessed by the spirit. Now Clyde travels to a Jewish community in New
York and the rabbi's son Tzadok returns with him expecting to exorcise Em to save the girl.
