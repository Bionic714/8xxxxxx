My collection of Kobe songs from over the years while waiting for Ghetto Thrilla to finally be released. Most of these are internet strays, some are from albums, some from mixtapes, and some just ripped from YouTube. Hopefully there's some tracks you haven't heard before! Most of CD2 is group ripped mp3's from various artist releases.
