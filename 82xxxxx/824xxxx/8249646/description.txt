Baseball - the crack of the bat, the dry leathery smack of the ball in a fielder's glove, the shouts of the hot dog vendors ringing over the roar of the crowd nothing brings Summer to the life more than a day at the ballpark. The wonderful stones collected here recall those thrilling games of yesteryear, when the bases were loaded, the count was full, and one run would win the game. Stories performed by James Mio. 1) The Red-Headed Outfield - A hilarious story of three unique outfielders, one crazy, one cranky, and one able to move like the wind. Their potential to win ball games is phenomenal, if only their coach could get control of them. Runtime - 35:57 2) Old Well Well - The touching story of a legendary baseball fan, known in ballparks throught the league, who has one last dying wish - to see his nephew, the rising star outfielder play in one game. Runtime 24:40
