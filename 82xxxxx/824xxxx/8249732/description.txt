ΓÇ£Songs From a Ghost TownΓÇ¥ is a short, sweet, 34 minute bluegrass ride that kind of sounds like the ΓÇ£O Brother Where Art ThouΓÇ¥ soundtrack if the artists werenΓÇÖt trying to make music that sounded like it was written in 1939. ThereΓÇÖs nary an electric guitar to be found, the singer sounds like he was ripped straight out of sweet home Ala-bam, and thereΓÇÖs more banjos going around then you would see at a family reunion for the backwoods sister-rammers in ΓÇ£Deliverance.ΓÇ¥ Only one track ΓÇ£The OutskirtsΓÇ¥ threatens to enter hippie wank territory, the remainder is comprised of songs that make you feel like youΓÇÖre walking around the sets for ΓÇ£To Kill a MockingbirdΓÇ¥ or ΓÇ£Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.ΓÇ¥ It has that downhome southern comfort feel, and is perhaps most astutely represented by breezy jams like the sincere ΓÇ£Whiskey,ΓÇ¥ and the nostalgic ΓÇ£One Way Street.ΓÇ¥ The majority of ΓÇ£Songs From a Ghost TownΓÇ¥ holds up well, but its greatest redeemable factor is the presence of ΓÇ£At Your Window,ΓÇ¥ which is arguably one of the top 10 bluegrass songs ever written.
