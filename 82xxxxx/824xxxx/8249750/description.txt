This version is 24 bit FLAC in mixed sample rates, some at 44.1KHz, some at 88.2KHz, the same quality as was mixed in the studio.  If you're not an audiophile you may prefer the 24bit 44.1 version or MP3/AAC which will be uploaded soon.  If you wish to burn CDs from the files we'd recommend the 16bit 44.1KHz FLAC version coming soon.  We like to promote better than CD quality where we can and hope you enjoy the experience.
