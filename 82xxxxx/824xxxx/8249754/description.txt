Trampled By Turtles consists of four members: Dave Simonett (guitar, vocals and songwriter) Erik Berry (mandolin, guitar & vocals), Dave Carroll (banjo & vocals), and Tim Saxhaug (bass & vocals). Each person has very different musical influences and talents. From Punk and Phish to classics like The Stanley Brothers and Bill Monroe, it is strange how Trampled By Turtles came to be. Only Dave Carroll grew up in a family that played bluegrass music. Erik BerryΓÇÖs mandolin is more high tech than most traditional bluegrassers might take control of, but the electric sound is mesmerizing. He originally got into bluegrass while working for the college radio station hosting a three-hour folk music show every Saturday for two summers.

This album has songs like ΓÇ£Burn For Free" teetering between moments of rock and moments of folk. ΓÇ£Codeine" is a nice ditty about pain reliever love. Dave sings, ΓÇ£Codeine, your the nicest thing IΓÇÖve ever seen - for awhile - You hold my hand as I step into the room - All these people will be fading soon." In ΓÇ£Blue Sky And The Devil" the song says, ΓÇ£IΓÇÖm leaving Virginia back to where I belong - I canΓÇÖt remember the last time I gone - ThereΓÇÖs blue skies and women and liquor so strong - Angels and Devils to carry me on." They make the traditional theme of bluegrass encompass the lyrics as well.
