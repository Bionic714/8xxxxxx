ItΓÇÖs probably no shock for Todd Snider followers to discover that he was/is heavily influenced by veteran gonzo country singer/songwriter Jerry Jeff Walker. Snider has been carrying on WalkerΓÇÖs scraggly Texas-styled country/Americana tradition since he started, without specifically acknowledging itΓÇª until now. He and some musical friends along with co-producer to the stars Don Was, kick back and sling out 14 Walker tracks that range from the iconic (ΓÇ£Mr. BojanglesΓÇ¥/ΓÇ£Railroad LadyΓÇ¥) to the relatively obscure (ΓÇ£Vince Triple-O MartinΓÇ¥) with the same laconic/scrappy vibe that has defined WalkerΓÇÖs own music over the past 45 years. ItΓÇÖs clearly a labor of love but should also help WalkerΓÇÖs tunes (and extensive career) get discovered by SniderΓÇÖs younger, hipper fan base.
