I finally got some good internet back and I have hundreds of issues of comics from the early 80's into the 90's I would like to scan and share. What dpi is a good setting? It seems no matter which one I choose on my scanner each image comes out to be over 10mb in size. Any suggestions? jpg, png?!? Thank You :D"
