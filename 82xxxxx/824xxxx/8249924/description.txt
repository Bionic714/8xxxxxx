I haven't found the Spider-Man Megazine series from 1994-95 yet, but I did grab 5 out of the 6 "2nd wave" of Megazines that came out in '96. These two feature Miller's Elektra-centric issues from Daredevil, and these Megazines acted as a prelude to the first-ever ongoing Elektra series by Peter Milligan and Mike Deodato.
