Tim's self-titled, all-acoustic solo CD draws material and inspiration from the Anne and Frank Warner collection of American folk songs, the early American hymnody of the Sacred Harp, and a host of other historical and personal resources. This collection of songs about love and death, joy, despair, redemption and, ultimately, hope confirms his prowess as a stunningly intense vocalist, versatile multi-instrumentalist (guitar, fiddle and banjo), and true believer in the timeless spirit of American music. The CD was recorded in one five-hour session using no overdubs, providing an undiluted dose of Eriksen's passionate voice, instrumental skills and deep respect for musical tradition. Eriksen's star is currently ascending with his role as arranger and vocalist in the Christmas 2003 blockbuster historical film, "Cold Mountain," which is bringing his love of "shape note" singing to a new and receptive audience of critics and music fans.
