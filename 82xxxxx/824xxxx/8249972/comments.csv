,benenya,2013-03-13T07:13Z,"fucking went to shit the last 15 minutes of the show. audio must have been ten minutes out of sync. What a shitty way to go. Now I have to find another torrent just to finish the last few minutes of the episode. YAAAAAAAAY, great job."
,Pavlov1988,2013-03-13T07:58Z,"Not a huge deal guys. 
yeah eztv, i hit up your torrent every week and it's always class, but s04e10 got a little messed up. if you open in vlc, it'll open two seperate windows, like the program is trying to correct the audio/video issue. 
got to find a new source. sry."
,Tuckle,2013-03-13T12:12Z,"@Benenya:  Rather than complaining in a rather abusive way, try to remember this:  Someone else has gone to the effort of putting this up for other people to download, you on the other hand are getting a FREE tv show.  Next time, feel free to upload your own version (which you have never done) or STFU and enjoy.  "

,mwalsher,2013-03-13T21:03Z,"@Tuckle, it being free or automated is not an excuse. If it is bad/broken/incomplete/etc., then they should not upload it at all. People are right to complain that they just wasted their bandwidth on it; not everybody has free, unlimited bandwidth! If the releasers won't/can't check their stuff, then they should quit and leave it to someone who can and does instead of tricking people into wasting their bandwidth on it and polluting the search results."
