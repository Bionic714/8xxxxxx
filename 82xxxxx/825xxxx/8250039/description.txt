1972, George Brown, a wrongfully imprisoned fugitive and black panther sympathizer, together with 4 other accomplices, hijacked a flight from USA to Algeria to join the black panthers in exile, along the way collecting the highest ransom ever paid in an airline hijacking, 1 million dollars. 2008, during the most symbolic elections in American history, Rashid finds out about George and sets off for Paris where George has been living for the past 35 years. Through his eyes and George's words, we look at the human aspect of the struggle for civil rights, the evolution of racism and revisit a period in history where conflict seemed to be the only way to reach freedom and equality.
