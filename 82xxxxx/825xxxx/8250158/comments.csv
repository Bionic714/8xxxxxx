,tarball8,2013-03-13T06:13Z,"This file is messed up.   Opens two windows in VLC, one for Direct 3D.   Even in windows media player the is goes into bizarre massive uncorrectable audio sych problem at 35:00"
,Mr_Heisenberg,2013-03-13T06:19Z,^This is the corrected version.........
,bawbzor,2013-03-13T07:04Z,The last 10 minutes or so are screwed up. Video does not match audio. 
,cadhorn63,2013-03-13T07:41Z,"I just downloaded this exact file (from here, this page) and opened it in VLC, forwarded to 35:00 and played a bit, skipped forward and played a bit, etc.  The sound is in sync.
@tarball8 and bawbzor: are you sure you downloaded this exact file?"
,Mr_Heisenberg,2013-03-13T07:58Z,"One more time, this IS the corrected version, hints ""REPACK"" in the title. Great episode too, thanks."
,Pavlov1988,2013-03-13T07:59Z,"Not a huge deal guys. 
yeah eztv, i hit up your torrent every week and it's always class, but s04e10 got a little messed up. if you open in vlc, it'll open two seperate windows, like the program is trying to correct the audio/video issue. 
got to find a new source. sry."
,Toby196,2013-03-13T08:46Z,"Thx, eztv."
,Toby196,2013-03-13T09:00Z,"Just downloaded and skipped through this file real quick, and everything is synced up as it should be.  Great work on the Repack.

I think the other commentators are confusing this file with another file."
,TQTQTQ,2013-03-13T10:08Z,"Thank you.
:-)"
,yaboo_56,2013-03-13T10:55Z,Furked up video ! as they have said it  opens twice.
,Tuckle,2013-03-13T12:09Z,"Amazing how many ""special"" people are out there who don't realise this is the REPACK.  As in, it has been fixed, there are no errors, it works fine.  The other eztv version (which IS still on piratebay) has some minor problems.  Either way, you're getting a free TV show that someone else is taking the time to upload...."
,bawbzor,2013-03-13T12:50Z,"Sorry for confusing ""Justified S04E10 HDTV x264-EVOLVE [eztv]"" with this one. I didn't realize all the mouth-breathers on here would jump down my throat."
,igoturback,2013-03-13T15:57Z,"these assholes copy the same one and postit like they did it , its all fucked up at the end.. 3rd fucking one different names  same crap tape  "

,mernastr,2013-03-15T03:34Z,works great; i watch using MPC-HC and addic7ed has the repack subtitles.
,Mr_Cha-whoo,2013-03-16T02:17Z,"Thanks for this and all eztv. Always great. I might be going out on a limb, but is this not the greatest frigging show on TV?"
,analogkid6103,2013-03-17T09:55Z,"Listen to this fricking whining you would that he sent a fuckin virus or somethin. give the shit a rest go read a book,if ya can. thanks ez for havin more patience than me."
