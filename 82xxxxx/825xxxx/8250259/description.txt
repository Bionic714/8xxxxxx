Known for the unique spin they put on bluegrass and Americana music, this Duluth, Minnesota, quartet consistently stuns audiences with their tweaking of tradition that includes a never-before-heard mix of punk, alt-country, rock and pop. "Trampled By Turtles are a drummer away from sounding like the Pogues of bluegrass ΓÇö so fast and loud and melodically severe," writes City Pages.With their new recording, Trouble, under their belt, the group expands into new territory: From the exuberant pop strains of "Still in Love With You" and the roiling, dark underbelly of "Who's Calling?" to the baleful "Salvation," TBT up the ante once again. While TBT haven't eschewed their roots ΓÇö traditional music forms are the bedrock of their sound ΓÇö they never allow their take on tradition to become mere mimicry. Producer Rich Mattson (Ol' Yeller, Minnesota Music Award Producer of the Year), assisted in making Trouble stand out from the rest of the pickers and slingers out there, incorporating drums, violin and cello ΓÇö the latter featuring Jessy Greene (Wilco, Jayhawks).
