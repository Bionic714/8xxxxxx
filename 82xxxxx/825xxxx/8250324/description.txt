WORKDONE:

Fixed the brightness,contrast levels whilst lowering the intes to low
the glare thats in the video.
Then Changed the rgb colours and lowered the sat,to make the colours less powerful.
Didn't bother with the smoother and sharpness filters as i don't think it would make that
much difference to be honest.

Audio was totally remastered...first changed all the EQ bands and lowered the ones that had too
much noise,then used a click and crackle filter i use for cleaning on LP's...before finally using
a hiss removal and resaving as mp3.

EXTRA NOTES:

Well i was hoping this day never came,well not yet anyway.....but after a decade of doing this,its time to hang up the old
fingers and eyes :(
But for one last time i would like to thank all those i have had the pleasure of talking to,which has been many over all these
years.Its been a blast and i will sadly miss all this.
However it was all just fun at the start and was done just for that alone and a test of what could be done to the sources....but
last couple of years theres been alot of backstabbing and just pure hate from a new generation of users....
And on top of that theres been alot of grps,sites,users all falling victim and some doing hard times and what for ...some bloody films :(
So with all that ....i'm outta here !!

To all friends and its been a pleasure ......THANK YOU :)
