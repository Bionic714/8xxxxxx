,aiigghht,2013-03-14T10:57Z,"picture is average for 720p and audio is very average

volume fluctuates and the ball hitting the ring or net sounds are way louder than everything else which makes it pretty annoying to watch.

Thanks anyway ill suffer through it since gondy10 didn't upload this game."
