The Bottle Rockets' first two albums were two of the most influential and popular records of the alternative country movement, setting the stage for their third album, 24 Hours a Day, to be a popular breakthrough upon its 1997 release. After all, alt-country was beginning to emerge from the mainstream and establish itself as one of the cornerstones of adult alternative radio. It's too bad they dropped the ball with 24 Hours a Day, then, since it could have been the one that made their career. It's not that the album is bad -- it's just not great. There are a couple of good moments, such as the propulsive "Perfect Far Away," but much of it is simply solid, craftsmanlike country-rock that sounds like it could have been done by any alt-country band. While that means the album is listenable, it also means that it's a disappointment, since The Bottle Rockets have the potential to be much more than just another alt-country band.
