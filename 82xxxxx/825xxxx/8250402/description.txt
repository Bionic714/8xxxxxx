Plot: A small-time magician arrives in an enchanted land and is forced to decide if he will be a good man or a great one. 


WORKDONE:

Fixed the brightness,contrast levels whilst lowering the intes to low
the glare thats in the video.
Then Changed the rgb colours and lowered the sat,to make the colours less powerful.
Didn't bother with the smoother and sharpness filters as i don't think it would make that
much difference to be honest.

Audio was totally remastered...first changed all the EQ bands and lowered the ones that had too much noise,then used a click and crackle filter i use for cleaning on LP's...before finally using
a hiss removal and resaving as mp3.
