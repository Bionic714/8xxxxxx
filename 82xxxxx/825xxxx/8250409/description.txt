Canada has a way of popping out a gem when you least expect it. Sadly very few make it past the first album and only the lucky few ever make it on a level deserving of their ability. It can take a band from Canada many years to break the US market (Barenaked Ladies, par example). The better bands usually only ever reach underground or cult status and rarely make it over the border, save for a few mini-bus tours. The Weakerthans are an obvious example, having yet to attain anything like the international acclaim they surely warrant.
