,vi37n0w,2013-03-13T14:01Z,"This needs an episode like the behind the sceinces Amish Mafia. There is no way the loaded (you could see the damn belt of ammo...) M60E2 machine gun in the first season much less show a squatter, in a perfectly clean set of clothing, hide his face so he could later play squatter in a coat with a gun. The only thing he is was arrested... The editing is either very clever or this really is like watching Bomb Patrol or Combat Rescue. These guys & girl have epic balls."
