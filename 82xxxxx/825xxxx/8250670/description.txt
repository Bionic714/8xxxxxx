The next upload is one of our recent release: the ENG scanlation of a Polish classic comic book: Funky Koval Part I - Breathless.

"Funky Koval is a 4-part Polish science fiction/detective story/political fiction genre comic book published in People's Republic of Poland in the 1980s. It gained a cult following and is still recognized as one of the best Polish comics." (Wikipedia)

I would like to highlight the fact that this English scan was not based on the Polish original, but on its Hungarian translation made by István Nemere in the 1980s. I myself am not fluent in Polish, therefore I had no chance to compare it with the original, but I reckon there shouldn't be too big differences.  But for one thing, the Hungarian text methodically referred to the Drolls as "furcsák" - "strange ones" and I decided to stick to it for the moment in the English text, too.

This is the V1.0 version, before proof-reading. 


Book Two will hopefully be finished at around June 2013, unless somebody else does it before me.

As for Book Three and Four, these unfortunately have not yet been published in Hungarian, so I would need the help of somebody with a good understanding of Polish to help me out. If interested, just leave me a message here or directly, please...

Thank you.
