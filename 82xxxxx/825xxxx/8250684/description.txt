The Chinese New Year of the Water-Snake was welcomed with a matching title, the next in the line of Classic Hungarian Comic Books translated to ENG,

The Time Spiral


A science fiction adaptation of a Soviet-Russian author, Martynev, written and drawn by Ernő Zórád. The coloured album was originally released in 1985 in Hungary.

I would like to say a big thanxXx to data9724 and LoonyLuna for their technical advices on how to enhance picture quality.

This is the V1.1 version, before proof-reading and after reducing the size into one .cbr file only. No split .rars this time!

Anybody would give a try to proof-read this title, just let me know! ThanxXx!

The next swatura scanlations from Zórád will be an adaptation of Bullwer-Lytton's The Last Days of Pompeii.

Check SWATura torrents for other hard-to-find classics!
