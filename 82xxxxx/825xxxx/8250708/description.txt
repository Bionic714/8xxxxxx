Let us continue with yet another Classic Hungarian Comic Book translated to ENG.

A comic book adaptation of a popular Hungarian author, István Nemere's Science Fiction: The Secret of Dome City.

The story is about three teenagers, Lars, Don & Ariel, as they are on their way to the Moon, to take their entry exams to the Academy training astronauts.

The original comic book was published in Hungary in the mid 1980s, and although it was planned to go on for some time, it only lived to see 2 albums - due to Communist censorship issues. According to urban legend, the comic book said somethings it was not supposed to talk about.

The artist, József Haui is not among the most well known comic book authors in Hungary either, and at least to my knowledge, he only made a handful of titles so far.

The adventures of the 3 young astronauts have seen 3 comic book adaptations, the first of which ('Az űrkalózok fogságában') was drawn by another artist, Attila Fazekas. This story was published later on in Czechoslovakia  and Poland as well.

In the ENG scan, I tried to stay as close to the style of the original, as I could. For some it might seem a bit dull, but then, so was Communism, according to many...  

Enjoy!
