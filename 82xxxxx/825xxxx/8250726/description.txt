With their 1999 release of Greatest Hits 1984-1987, Reggie and the Full Effect managed to pull off one of the catchiest releases to ever combine metallic hardcore and '80s synth-pop. And thankfully, their follow-up album Promotional Copy doesn't stray too far away from their original formula. The humor and the Moogs remain as this Get Up Kids/Coalesce side project happily sings some of the corniest love songs that never get old.
