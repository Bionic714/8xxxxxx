,MissAnaMatronic,2013-03-13T14:54Z,"Yay, after my ten millionth try looking all day it's finally came up to download, Logo was just too unclear for my liking watching it via web streaming.  Awesome, Tuesday is my absolute favourite day of the week, I even have RuPaul's Day written in my calender. I am finding the show is really getting better now and heating up, they got rid of the riff raff and now we can really get to know each persons character, all the girls with the IT factor. Especially when Alaska was feeling left out when Roxxxy and Detox wouldn't take the 'Can I get an Amen' singing challenge seriously, Ru Caught on to that and tld her to drop the funny stick and show some heart too, and I think Alaska really could shine if she comes out of that Rolaskatox group and stop hiding under their wing and become her own person, because she would have to be really smart and kind behind the shits and giggles, you can tell and you have to be smart to be that quick with the funny one liners she always seems to get out at Ru,but thats why Ru never see's whats under the funny extertior. She isn't as smart as Sharon Needles but she is a pretty good knock off version. I wouldn't mind seeing Alaska win, I like the queens with kind hearts like Jinx and Coco and Alaska, they tend to be a little more sensitive and that appeals to me and they have talent for days. I love Alyssa's face though and all her funny theatrics so I am gonna say I want them for top 4. I completely have done a 180 from my original favourite of Detox and I thought Roxxy was fierce but now there little relationship they are developing and Roxxy's cattiness and rude/loudness drives me crazy so Ive chopped those 2 off my chopping block. But I am just going on personality mainly so I guess Detox as just a queen is one of my personal favourites just on stage. Only time will tell what will play out, all T no Shade here grrrl."
