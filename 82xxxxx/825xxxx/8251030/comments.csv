,Machine4578,2013-03-13T11:35Z,"thanks iam6UN!!

,iam6UN,2013-03-13T12:07Z,"...little example/ cvars:
r_dimshadowresolution 1024
r_dimshadowforcehighquality 1
= All shadows in game uses resolution of 1024 + Soft/ Dynamic Edges ;)

@Machine4578,

,ben7530,2013-03-13T22:38Z,"I think this game would STILL be a dud even if Carmack himself custom designed a 128-bit OS for it!

If you want a game with this ""flavor"" (post-apocalypsy, w/ vehicles), try Borderlands 1 or 2..."

And how to start mods, from mods dir ?"
