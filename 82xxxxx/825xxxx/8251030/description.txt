RAGE by idSoftware [2011] version 1.0.35.4669 64-Bit patch/ executables
cracked via Luma-64bit steam Emulator with DLC unlocker.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Full patch notes:

- No idea. Search the official forums.


Kinda short patch notes:

- Greatly increased overall ingame performance due to full utilization of 64-bit/ multi-core CPU's and Windows OS. (Previously not supported - 32-bit only)

- Fully unlocked console commands and ingame cvars for deeper customization of the game. (Custom tweaks for: Enhanced graphics, textures, visual effects, shadows; FOV for char and vehicles; UI tweaks, etc, etc...)

- Support for the RAGE-SDK Tools. (RAGE SDK - around 35Gb for download/ 50-60Gb for install/ 8-16Gb RAM recommended - Search the Internet for that ;) )

- Full support for user MODS. (Search the official forums/ other places for free user mods...or create your own WASTELAND via RAGE-SDK ;) )

Stuff you should and must know (I command YOU to read those !!!):
