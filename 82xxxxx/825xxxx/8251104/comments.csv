It includes only the DLC files, that's why it is so small."
[V],Gh0stNet,2013-03-13T10:43Z,not a fake. he has just uploaded the files which activate dlcs in sleeping dogs 
,XHaloXX,2013-03-13T11:42Z,"thank you very much! not fake, @Gladiolewf, dont say fake without seeing what are the files, fuckin asshole."
,ziggygod,2013-03-13T16:52Z,"After installing the DLC and applying the crack, I now get this error when starting Sleeping Dogs. ""Sorry, this program cannot run under a Virtual Machine. - buddha.dll"". Anyone know how I can fix this? Thanks."
,KevinPaul06,2013-03-13T17:04Z,Is it just me of the Year of the Snake pack is full of glitches? And how to start the mission of Wheels Of Fury? Anyway thanks for this!
[V],Gh0stNet,2013-03-13T18:40Z,just to tell u guys you need game updated to latest version to play Year of the Snake so if u want to play the game with all the dlcs then use my upload
,2Squirt,2013-03-13T19:44Z,"Gh0stNet's version of the game is the only one on PirateBay with the latest update (v2.1.437044). I recommend it.
Year of the Snake will however work on the old v2.1 update."
,2Squirt,2013-03-13T19:47Z,In order to start the Wheels of Fury set of missions look for the orange car icon in Kennedy Town (somewhere below the car shop).
,Machine4578,2013-03-14T02:14Z,"@2Squirt
the movie files were updated for the Year of the Snake DLC along with other important files with the last update v2.1.437044, so the Year of the Snake DLC may not function properly, even though it may load.."
,Kewee123,2013-03-31T00:02Z,What version does this work on? Does anybody know? Some of them worked for ver1.3 for me but not the ones that I wanted.
