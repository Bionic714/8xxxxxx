,hadouken1000,2013-03-14T09:06Z,Will this need other previous updates?
[V],Gh0stNet,2013-03-14T10:15Z,just make this clear this is not an update but the whole game which is updated to the latest version and after this no new dlc or updates is going to be released so think of this as a GOLD Edition of sleeping dogs so seed this torrent well !!

thanks Gh0stNet!!!"
,nazgull2k10,2013-03-19T00:36Z,"game is still glitchy and bugged to shit.  I crash at LEAST 3 times an hour, even with my top end PC and all updates on win7 64.  

Its completely fucking annoying.

Also, google search to remove the Gold and Silver packs, red envelope pack and the triad and cop packs.. otherwise the game is an absolute waste of time and boring to play."
,THANGDL,2013-03-20T02:27Z,Thanks!!! IT works perfectly! i've been interested with YEAR OF THE SNAKE.
,sjtay,2013-03-20T06:38Z,"The DLCs are great its all there. Only problem is, my game keeps crashing. Sometimes after 5 mins sometimes after an hour. It always freezes and then my AMD Display Driver will crash and restart. Leaving my game with a black screen but with sound.

I played this game before but on a previous version (p2p or Kao5) and it worked fine. But now, using this version i keep crashing.

Does anyone know how I can stop this? I'm using ATI Radeon HD 4870 and I have tried using the latest Catalyst drivers and even a lower driver when my previous game worked.

Any ideas?"
,sjtay,2013-03-20T06:44Z,where did my comment go?
,THANGDL,2013-03-20T13:04Z,"@sjtay !
- First: Is your PSU (power supply unit) strong enough for VGA card to work when playing Sleeping Dogs.v2.1.437044 with High Resolution Texture Pack?
- Second: Try download latest version of graphics driver."
,sjtay,2013-03-20T16:26Z,not using the texture pack and i've set everything to minimum. i am even using windowed mode. my ati drivers are at the most recent. direct x is also updated. so i am baffled.
,forlani101,2013-03-20T21:37Z,"The game works flawless and buttery smooth on the extreme preset with the exceptions of anti-aliasing turned to normal because with aliasing on extreme it cuts frames down to 30 or so. Just a hint for anyone who ticks the extreme preset and wonder why your frames are low. Just adjust anti-aliasing and you should be good to go or at least that's how it pans out on my system. All DLC works as intended also. Thanks for the great upload Ghost!

Here are my pc specs as a guide for anyone who has a similar setup as me to know what kind of performance to expect.

- Asus Z77 Sabertooth Motherboard
- i5 2500k OC@ 4.2GHz CPU
- 8gb Gskill DDR3@1600MHz RAM
- 64gb Samsung 830 SSD + Samsung 500gb HDD
- 1 Single EVGA Gtx 660Ti Superclocked 3gb Model
- Running Game @ Resolution of 1080p@60FPS
- Running latest Nvidia Beta Drivers 314.21

Hope this helps. Enjoy!"
,br0seph_,2013-03-21T02:17Z,"erm, whys it crash so much? "
,randir12,2013-03-29T22:46Z,"The game works along with all the DLC, but I'm not sure the high res textures are working. Switching them on and off makes no difference, and I can tell they aren't working because I already own the game on Steam so I know how it should look."
,Lulzovich,2013-03-31T17:23Z,"I can't start the game, I double click on the icon, it opens up, the cursor appears for a second and then it's all black, nothing happens. I've tried different compatibility modes, as well as running it as an administrator, but none of that seems to work. I've tried updating directX, Runtime and all that didn't help.

Pls, help a noob out ;_;"

,jinkazama69ers,2013-04-08T15:09Z,um for all of those who dowloaded this what version is this sleeping dogs

Thanx...!!! :D"
,veryangrychair,2013-04-30T14:31Z,"Well, this ain't working for me on W8 Enterpries x64. I bet the upload is just fine, but something is causing it to crash upon start. ""HKShip.exe has stopped working"".

Anywho, thanks Ghost."
,sleven06,2013-05-08T01:57Z,PLS TELL me that this one the menu is not in russian...
,sleven06,2013-05-08T03:41Z,"finally a version wht English menu ty ghostnet, u tha man...an for everyone that say that it crash, i played about 1h30 an no crash at all.perfect torrent."
,devilspriest,2013-05-09T10:04Z,my game keeps chrashing when i try to load my save games. it worked flawless yesterday when i started the new game and played for 7 hours but now it wont load my saves without crashing. HELP!!!
,wontquit,2013-05-12T21:35Z,"The game & all DLC work perfect.  HD texture is included.  In options/display turn it to ""Extreme"".  I tried it, looked amazing but dropped down to like 9 fps. lol

Anyone with a crashing problem...for fucks sake but it on a PS3 or 360.  Anyone that's ever played even a PC game especially a torrent one, knows that the game may crash now & then.

Thanks Gh0stNet!  U da' shit"
,AlphaQ23,2013-05-20T10:41Z,"I'm having a bit of a problem. I keep getting the dreaded ""Out of Frequency"" And I followed some steps to look for the displaysettings.xml but I can't find it in the folder.

Does anyone know how I can either find the settings file thats not in the data or fix the out of frequency another way? (I can't afford to upgrade my computer quite yet)."
,skarvika,2013-05-20T22:59Z,"I'm having the same problem other people seem to be having. The company logos show, then the Sleeping Dogs logo appears. I press a key to begin, the autosave message pops up, I hit ""ok"" and this is where it should take me to the main menu...but it doesn't.
It's just a black screen with the Sleeping Dogs cursor...
Any help?"
,skarvika,2013-05-20T23:18Z,"FIX FOR BLACK SCREEN:
I had chosen the default location when installing the dlc, which created a new Sleeping Dogs folder with the dlc data inside, and I hadn't noticed that all I needed to do was copy+paste this data over into my main Sleeping Dogs folder. I think the problem was that the game was trying to read data that wasn't there.
So check your dlc install location, it may have created a new Sleeping Dogs folder."
,IAINTTELLIN,2013-05-22T20:37Z,You are the most sexiest man ever. I will gladly suck you off and let you butt rape me any which way you like it
,Barrytoo,2013-06-02T22:53Z,"Anyone confirms this is working on Windows 8 x64?
When I start the game I get: ""HKShip.exe has stopped working"""
