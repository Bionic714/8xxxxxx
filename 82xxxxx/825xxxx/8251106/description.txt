A rar file of my complete HomeDistiller site as of about 2002

Download for offline reading on how to design and safely operate stills to distill your own spirits - vodka, whisky, gin, moonshine etc.  Covers all the theory, design calculations and guidelines, plenty of photos, how to brew the wash, distill (pot still or reflux), and then flavouring and aging the spirits.  Also read up on the legality - unless you are in New Zealand this is likely to be illegal for you.

The live website and forums have now moved on quite a bit since I saved this set, however you cannot download the current versions.
