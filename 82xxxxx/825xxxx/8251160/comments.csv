I installed this using the v9 CD, which seems to work, but a v10 install CD would great!

I've managed to emulate all of the dongle calls and trick the program into believing that a real dongle is attached (check the Key ID under Help).

I also have the registry dumps required if you'd rather use Brain's HASP emulator or Multikey. This way you can use an unpatched file, because I cracked the secret table required to fully emulate the dongle."

No HASP emulation, registy mods, etc  BS like with version 9."
