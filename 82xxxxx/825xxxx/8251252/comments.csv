I really appreciate that the issues that were watermarked were labeled as such.  (What's up with that?!!?)  Saves me the time and bandwidth as I just skipped them.    "
,wetbeak,2013-03-13T13:35Z,"hey turtle, just a theory    -r.e. watermark ; maybe the creators want you to buy a comic occasionally ! stop your bleating."
,turtlex,2013-03-13T15:12Z,Wetbeak - I've got no problem with creators/companies putting watermarks on their work... I just object when a scanner does it.  That's what happened in this case.  They added their logo to every page.
,cool-arrow,2013-03-13T16:26Z,"The watermark really isn't all that obtrusive.  And if it bothers you so much, perhaps you should just, you know, buy the books."
,Extremist,2013-03-13T20:09Z,"Hey guys, chill out! He just said it was nice they were marked so he could skip them! If you think comments are so obtrusive, maybe you should skip reading them!

I didn't know about the watermarking, so I'll skip them too, just a personal preferance.

Oh, and thanks again for posting, shipjolly!"
