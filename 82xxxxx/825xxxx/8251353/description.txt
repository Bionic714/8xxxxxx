The Galleons are a 6 piece Indie-Folk band from Brighton. Their melodic, spell-binding music cuts a dash between traditional British Folk and modern Indie. Equally at home playing in a darkened, candle-lit cellar as they are in a sunny (or more often rainy) festival field, their music takes the audience from catchy, foot stomping folk-rock to mellow, mysterious lullabies and back.

In the past year they have played at an array of festivals across the UK and been invited back to all of them! Played a number of live radio sessions including the BBC, recorded their debut album, sold out venues such as the world famous Stables and recorded in a dungeon!

Each listener seems to compare them to a different artist. This year so far they have had; Low, Tunng, Fairport Convention, Belle & Sebastian, The Grateful Dead, Arcade Fire, Pentangle and Bonnie Prince Billy.
