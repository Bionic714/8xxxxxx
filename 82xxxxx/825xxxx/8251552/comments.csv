Track 2"
[T],mikesanderspqrs,2013-03-14T11:34Z,"Thanks for info. I'm usually very fussy about this because many oldies compilations include some tracks that are not the original recordings. I'm a 60s man and I know what every song from the 60s should sound like, so I test them first. I do know a lot of the 50s though. I've made more enquiries and it appears this Tommy Steele recording appeared on the album that was released at the time of the single. Perhaps the master tape of the original single is shite?"
