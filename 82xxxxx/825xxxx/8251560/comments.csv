Very good work  !!
I used to upload and i know it's taking time !"
,Josh-rko,2013-03-15T08:26Z,Thanks for uploading the games. Muchly appreciated =]
,torqq,2013-04-21T04:07Z,"shemy, just wanted to say thanks for all the rugby over the years. I'm South African and moved here to the US like 5 years ago. You've been my only source of rugby.

IIRC, last time you stopped uploading I think you apparently ended up in the hospital or something. Hope you're all good man. If you are alright then I hope the reason you've stopped isn't that you have been discouraged by some negative comments or anything.

All the best..."
,queeg4000,2013-05-12T11:56Z,"Shemyaza - ever so grateful for you uploads over the last few years, our only source of Super Rugby. Trying to find a copy of the 2010 Sharks v Reds game (round 8 I think). Any chance you still have a copy?"
,Senirockz,2013-05-26T15:10Z,"Hello Shemyaza, you are doing a great job. Keep it up my friend !"
