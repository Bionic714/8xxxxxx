,chrisroberts3,2013-03-13T15:22Z,Does it have Microsoft XBOX 360 Gamepad Controller support or is it only old school Keyboard and Mouse? 
,motley666,2013-03-13T18:37Z,"Keyboard and mouse is not old school, it's the proper way of playing games."
,chrisroberts3,2013-03-13T23:28Z,"Some games are better with a Keyboard and mouse such as FPS games. I didnt mean anything bad with old school, i just meant that some still prefer that instead for Gamepads. Lucious is that type of game that had been better had it had gamepad support as it is a platformer. In the end every Windows PC game should have Gamepad AND Keyboard and Mouse option so everyone can play their games the way they prefer. "

,PiratusLongus,2013-03-14T15:11Z,"Thanks again Wanderer, appreciate all the work you do...."
,motley666,2013-03-14T21:24Z,"Ok ChrisRoberts, but Lucius is not a platformer, it's an adventure/action of sorts."
,Xigor,2013-03-16T05:04Z,Is this the fully patched game? I remember quitting at the gardens where that police officer was (nighttime stealth) because he would always catch me.
