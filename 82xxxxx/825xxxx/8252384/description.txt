Live at Leeds is a live album by The Rolling Stones, released in 2012. It was recorded at Roundhay Park, Leeds on July 25, 1982. The album was released exclusively as a digital download through Google Music on October 16, 2012. The concert was the band's final show of their European Tour 1982 and was also the band's last live performance with band co-founder and pianist Ian Stewart. 

The song list on this collection is nearly identical to that of Hampton Coliseum (Live 1981), another Rolling Stones live album released earlier in 2012 which documents a show from the 1981 U. S. leg of the same tour. This recording includes the song "Angie," which does not appear on the Hampton Coliseum recording, but misses two songs which appear on the Hampton album: "Waiting on a Friend" and "Let It Bleed."
