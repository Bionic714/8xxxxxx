                                 Release Notes

SEEDBOX SUPPORTED!!

German sergeant gets involved in anti-Hitler conspiracy, and saves the life of 
an American colonel. 

Not a very good summary from IMDB.  This is the much-maligned sequel to 
Peckinpah's Cross of Iron, with the further adventures of Senior Sergeant Rolf 
Steiner, played here by Richard Burton.  Burton is a pitiful Steiner with none 
of the stoic cynicism exhibited by his predecessor, James Coburn.  In fact, 
Burton was nearly at the end of his career (and life) when this film was made, 
and his alcohol-ravaged body can barely do some of the stunts it was called upon 
to do (like walking....).

Nevertheless, the film is somewhat of a rarity.  It was produced in West 
Germany, and orignally released in German as Steiner, das eiserne Kreuz, 2. 
Teil.  The running time for the German version is stated as 115 minutes, but the 
copy of the German version that I have is only 105 minutes.  This English 
version is 93 minutes.  If anyone is interested in seeing the German version, 
please let me know, and I will put it up.

This film, nonetheless has many great actors, including some of the stars of the 
first Cross of Iron film.  Corporal Amseln and Corporal Krueger, both make 
return appearances.

Stars: Richard Burton, Rod Steiger, Helmut Griem, Klaus Loewitsch, Michael 
Parks, Dieter Schidor, Robert Mitchum, Curd Juergens, and many more!  An all-
star cast!

Although this was ripped from a DVD, one can plainly see the DVD was made from a 
processed video.  The quality is quite good: A=10 V=9.

As a special bonus, I have included a film marketing photo from the original 
Cross of Iron.  This photo is a platoon photo of Steiner with the original 
platoon.  It would make a great wallpaper or if you print it our on photo paper, 
it is great for framing!

Enjoy!
