,steve1995,2013-03-13T16:00Z,"Thanks for uploading, GunningHawk!

Anyone know what the name of this volume is? It's annoying having an untitled volume in my collection. 

I suppose we will be finding out soon enough, this being the sixth one."
,Unreal234,2013-03-13T16:19Z,Thakx dude.
,tdurden83,2013-03-13T16:38Z,"thx for this up. no doubt, they have marketing for this series down to a very profitable science. I will give them credit for those compendiums though, those were a hell of a deal"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-13T16:55Z,"steve1995, it's still untitled on amazon (they're taking pre-orders), so i suspect the title hasn't been finalized/announced."
,wtb300,2013-03-13T18:04Z,thanks for the upload gunning. this will do till vol 18 is released
,dickfart55,2013-03-13T18:46Z,thank you for the upload. been waiting all day for this :)
,DieGo2SHAE,2013-03-13T21:47Z,"Thanks!

@steve1995, Volume 18 is called Abandon All Hope =)"
,jennysparks,2013-03-14T10:29Z,Thanks GunningHawk90!
,pow.r.pop,2013-03-14T18:01Z,"Thanks Hawk.

About the comic though, I just read it and this shit is getting ridiculous. The Ezekiel character and his ""Pet"" are stupid and unbelievable. And what the fuck are his people wearing ? Who's the next bigg boss going to be ? Donald Duck ? "
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-14T22:19Z,@pow.r.pop how is he stupid and unbelievable? he's in the comic for about 4 pages. can you decide from that?
,rjw8181,2013-03-15T03:34Z,opens a blank page......
,eyezworld,2013-03-15T14:24Z,All I'm getting is blank page when opening with Comic Rack...

,kornspell,2013-03-23T07:04Z,I also get blank pages... 
,pow.r.pop,2013-03-24T04:09Z,"Come on ! ....A fucking Tiger ??? !!!

And a how many ""Kings"" are there ? With Knights on horses ????

This turning into some stupid bullshit"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-25T19:28Z,"there are over 200 zoos, and they say there are over 5,000 tigers in captivity, in the u.s. so why couldn't a powerful or influential survivor rescue, steal, or have one as a pet? same for horses. i don't think their makeshift armor looked much like forged steel, i thought it was police body armor like rick's group found at the prison. as for kings, i think there are about 10 living in the world today. again, power and influence is one way an american survivor could convince others to call him ""king"". if you save me from a zombie horde, i'll call you mr. sweetdaddyturdass if you ask me to.

honestly pow.r.pop, i just like reading your troll comments on TWD torrents. you obviously love the series despite your bitching -- otherwise, why the hell are you still reading it every month?"
,thadmacracken,2013-03-26T02:54Z,Thank You
,pow.r.pop,2013-03-27T07:28Z,"Oh ! I love this comic , no doubt. And that is why I get so pissed off when we are forced to pretend that some dude is able to tame a tiger and tell it to ""SIT, SIT BOO BOO ......GOOD DOG"" 

Boo Boo gets mad when ......DO I NEED TO GO ON ??!! 

This is retarded !"
,pow.r.pop,2013-03-27T07:32Z,"As soon as the outbreak happens , I will get to work on an army of land crawling sharks wielding chainsaws on their heads, .....but it's ok because they are my pets and respond to my commands .........Because I'm so cool. And  REALLY Fuck head !!!!!!! WHATS THE BIG DEAL ?? 

Come on dude, this shit is stupid (-_-)"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-27T12:48Z,"well pow.r.pop i guess you shouldn't buy the comic if it's becoming too stupid... oh wait, you don't buy the comic anyway, lmao.

people domesticate big cats all over the world, yeah it's dangerous -- look at roy horn -- but it happens. if you feed them, you can train them, just like a normal cat. it's just that the consequences are much worse if they get pissed.

second, you're ignoring that the different survivor groups now that they're maybe 2 years into the outbreak are going to develop differently. herschel's farm had a barn full of zombies. woodbury had a stadium with gladiator fights. but a guy saving and keeping a tiger is too much for you? people would do whatever they wanted to do, once there were no rules other than ""survive"".

and again, you've seen these characters for 4 freakin' pages. you know nothing, other than your 1st impressions."
,pow.r.pop,2013-03-27T19:16Z,"Ok , ok...

I'll give it another shot next month (lol)

But if beast master has anymore animals at his command, you are going to think of me when you read it.

And you are going to secretly say to yourself ""Damn ! That troll was kinda right, this shit is getting silly"""
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-27T19:37Z,lol beastmaster! ok deal. #109 had best have no more stupid shit.
,Killher,2013-03-30T19:19Z,How about you pricks stop talking about the story line like some fucking housewives at a reading party. Do you think I fucking read this for the goddamn pretty colors?
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-31T06:10Z,"personally i think you fucking read it so you don't have to get a goddamn job, have a girlfriend, or otherwise leave your basement"
,1ProTeam,2013-04-04T21:23Z,wow i love this :DDDDDDDDDDD
