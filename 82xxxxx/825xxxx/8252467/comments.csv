,zazuba91,2013-04-15T18:56Z,"I don't know how to edit... so I'll just leave another message. I use WinRar to open the files because I didn't know how to open .cbz/.cbr files and when I googled it it said to just rename the file and open it with a decompression program.

This method has worked for all your[talking to the uploader] previous torrents and on others as well, but I can't get it to work for this one... So again, please, if anyone has any helpful clues so I can read this book, let me know!"
