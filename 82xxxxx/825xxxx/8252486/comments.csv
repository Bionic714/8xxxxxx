I'm really happy for me :P and also for all those people around the world who don't have enough speed or bandwidth and are now able to watch masterpieces in small size and killer quality. All thanks to you :)

Hoping you do the other requests too.

Sharing art which matters is our small way of keeping it alive in exchange for the ineffably wonderful gifts it bestows upon us ;)"
