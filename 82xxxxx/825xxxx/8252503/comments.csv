,grandpawww,2013-03-14T09:49Z,wheres brookes solo? and the part with mackenzie doing cartwheels?
,thatcitylove,2013-03-14T22:28Z,"grandpaww:

yes i agree, that part is missing. thanks for the upload, didn't know if it was in two parts because it was a two hour episode special but most was here."
,MMM-MMM-MMM,2013-03-16T08:32Z,"there are important scenes missing... as mentioned above - Brooke's solo, and Mackenzie getting busted for doing cartwheels when she is meant to be injured - fairly major parts of the overall story... the rest of the cap is good. Hope to see the full version"
,DanzsaC,2013-03-16T16:50Z,@grandpawww I was thinking the same thing! And the part where apparently Abby was rounding on Nia for McKenzie's cartwheels or something...?  O.o
