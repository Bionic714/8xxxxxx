Sebsky Tools is freakin' ANCIENT, man.  This is total shit ... unless you're using Avid / ProTools and FinalCut on a PPC-era Mac.

For fuck's sake, even the site itself itself is dead:

(shakes head) Whatever floats your boat ..."

Sebsky Tools was a Freeware application consisting of five utilities, each aimed at helping to move editing projects between Avid Media Composer made by Avid and Final Cut Pro made by Apple Computer.
The 5 utilities are:
* fcp2ale – converts batch lists exported from FCP to ALE shot logs which can be imported in Avid. This makes it possible to move bins containing clips from FCP to Avid.

* ale2fcp – Converts ALE shot logs, exported from Avid, to batch lists which can be imported in FCP. This makes it possible to move bins containing clips from Avid to FCP.

* Batch Add TC – Can add timecode and Source ID (reel name) to QuickTime files exported from Avid, reading timecode and reel name from a corresponding ALE file. This makes it possible to maintain timecode- and source information when moving media from Avid to FCP.

*bwf2qt – Converts Broadcast Wave Format (BWF) audio files to QuickTime and optionally extracts metadata and place it in a batch list that can be imported in FCP along with the QuickTime files.

* TC Player – Its possible to manually add and delete timecode and source information to QuickTime files.
