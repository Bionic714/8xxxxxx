Harlan Coben (born January 4, 1962) is an American author of mystery novels and thrillers. The plots of his novels often involve the resurfacing of unresolved or misinterpreted events in the past (such as murders, fatal accidents, etc.) and often have multiple plot twists. Both series of Coben's books are set in and around New York and New Jersey, and some of the supporting characters in the two series have appeared in both.

Coben has won a number of awards from the mystery fiction community for his work. He won the 1996 Anthony Award in the "Best Paperback original" category for his d√©but novel Deal Breaker, which also received an Edgar award nomination in the same category. Fade Away was also highly acclaimed, winning the 1997 Shamus Award and Edgar Award for "Best Paperback original", being nominated for the Anthony Award and Barry Award in the same category; and picking up a Dilys Award nomination also.[8] The following Myron Bolitar novel, Back Spin, won the 1998 Barry Award and was nominated for both the Dilys Award and the Shamus Award also. Coben's 2001 stand-alone novel Tell No One was very well received the following year. It was nominated for the Anthony Award, Macavity Award, Edgar Award and the Barry Award also. (From Wikipedia)
