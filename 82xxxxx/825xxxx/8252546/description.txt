The following list gives an overview over the features. PLEASE NOTE that features marked with "*" vary between different phone models!

- Burst: shoot a set of pictures as fast as the phone supports
- Bracketing: take up to 10(!) different exposed images (can be used for HDR stitching with other apps)
- Anti-shake: take pictures exactly in the moment when the phone is not moving

Settings (excerpt)

- Disable shutter sound
- Fullscreen viewfinder*
- Back/front camera (front camera does not support video recording yet)*

IMPORTANT LIMITATIONS
- For video resolutions greater than 720x480 set focus mode to "Continuous" if available. Else recording might start delayed (app looks as if it hangs for some seconds on the Samsung Galaxy S2)
- Zooming and picture controls can only be modified BEFORE video recording
- Changing from continuous autofocus to some other focus mode can be very slow
- Sometimes the direct HD video preview in the video player (started from CameraPro) shows only a black screen. When the player is started manually the video play back is fine.
- If updating from CameraX fails, uninstall CameraX before installing CameraPro.
- Video recording on some HTC devices and on all devices with Android 2.2 and older is only partly supported
HTC/Distorted Pictures:
- Some still picure resolutions on some HTC devices are distored (e.g. 16:9 resolutions). Enable the "HTC fix" under settings to fix.
LG/Viewfinder orientation:
- On some devices the viewfinder orientation is wrong (e.g. LG P500). Enable "Orientation fix" under settings to fix.

What's in this version:
2.4.4
- Added histogram (can be disabled under Settings)
- Added option to completely hide individual menu items (under "Arrange menus")
- Added beep sound for self-timer for the last 5 seconds (Android 4+, shutter sound and volume must be enabled)
- Bug fixes
