The complete collection of The Film Crew, containing all four films.

For those who don't know, The Film Crew was a project that was a sort-of hybrid of MST3K and RiffTrax, in that Mike, Bill and Kevin did appear as themselves, but there were also sketches during breaks in the film as well as receiving their movies from a higher up again, though this time it was an obscenely wealthy employer calling in their film assignments from various bizarre and exotic locations rather than the Mads.

It ended after 4 episodes when, while waiting for quite a long while for further installments to be issued from Shout Factory, they went on to start RiffTrax and left TFC behind them.

But do please enjoy. Just be warned... the first episode contains sights that cannot be unseen. lol
