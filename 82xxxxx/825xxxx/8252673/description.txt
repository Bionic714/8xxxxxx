In the past he was serving the Ishin Shishi, a group of patriots who fought to return power to the Emperor, fought hundreds of battles and claim many lives. But after finishing all the fighting, vows never to kill, and decides to move to anonymity to devote to travel the country as a hobo helping those in need, as penance for all the deaths he caused. Ten years later, in 1878, arrives in Tokyo where Kenshin meets Kaoru (Emi Takei), who invites him to stay at her dojo until you return to wander. However, the past that Kenshin tried to leave behind soon return to take revenge against him.
