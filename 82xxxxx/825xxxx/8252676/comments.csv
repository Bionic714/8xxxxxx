You wouldn't have any of Morton Smith's own books, would you?

Anyway, this whole thing reminds me a bit of the debates over whether Walter Hooper wrote some of C.S. Lewis' works that he published under Lewis' name."
[T],penfag,2013-03-13T19:05Z,"@pharmakate: I'm very much fascinated by forgeries and hoaxes although my interest is more literary than theological. In any case, there's a good general discussion of literary and scholarly fakes in the Carlson book.

I've got a copy of Morton Smith's ""Jesus the Magician"" (Harper & Row, 1978) [PDF, 5MB] that I can upload if you're interested."

Are you familiar with the debate about Idries Shah? Apparently he published a version of the Rubaiyat supposedly based on a secret Sufi source that only he knew about and whose existence is in doubt."
[T],penfag,2013-03-14T21:55Z,@pharmakate: Done - see http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8257733.  I'd never heard of the debate surrounding Idries Shah and his brother until you mentioned it and I looked it up on Wikipedia.  Very interesting indeed!
