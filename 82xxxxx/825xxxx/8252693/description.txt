San Pedro, a visionary and hallucinogenic brew derived from the mescaline-based Trichocereus pachanoi or 'cactus of vision', is one of Peru's most important and powerful teacher plants. For thousands of years this brew has been drunk by spiritual seekers and those who need healing, and it has cured a wide variety of physical problems, including cancer, diabetes, paralysis, and pneumonia, as well as emotional and psychological issues such as alcoholism, heartbreak, and grief. Those who work with it say San Pedro brings us closer to God. Remarkably, however, while other South American teacher plants such as ayahuasca have been well reported in the literature, there has been no book specifically written about the shamanic use of San Pedro - until now. The Hummingbird's Journey to God provides wisdom for the whole of mankind.
