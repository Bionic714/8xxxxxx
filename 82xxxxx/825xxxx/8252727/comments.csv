Her tweet about her rehiring was pretty tame but I hope she privately gave DC a piece of her mind!
Her run has been amazing I only hope such an important issue with a 'guest' writer can keep up.
Thanks STFmaryville!"

i stumbled upon an editorial essay by brian cunningham yesterday in the stan's soapbox trade paperback and brian wrote:

""And the 'Soapbox' where he had to eat crow over the mistitling of Epic Illustrated, showed me that... well, sometimes even The Man had to eat crow, just like the lot of us!""

keep eatin' that crow, brian cunningham. just keep eatin'.  :-D"
