*This spin on the facts is hilarious. Editor Brian Cunningham actually fired writer Gail Simone, but then when the fans got pissed, DC hired her back. In the meantime Fawkes was hired, then let go so she could come back. Editor-in-Chief Bob Harras has used this "guest writer" shit publicly, but he's a terrible liar.  --STFmaryville
