:: Movie Info ::

Vishwaroopam is a 2013 Tamil-Hindi spy thriller film written, directed and co-produced by Kamal Haasan who also enacts the lead role. The film has Pooja Kumar, Rahul Bose, Andrea Jeremiah and Jaideep Ahlawat in supporting roles, the film features soundtrack composed by Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy, with lyrics by Vairamuthu and Kamal Haasan while Javed Akhtar translated them for the Hindi version titled Vishwaroop

Development of the project commenced after the release of Haasan's Manmadhan Ambu (2010) when several of the crew were brought in from the United States to lend their technical expertise. The direction was taken over by Haasan from Selvaraghavan and reports indicating a comparison with several English films surfaced during the production. The first teaser was revealed in April 2012 and first theatrical trailer was revealed in June 2012. Vishwaroopam is the first Indian film, and second film worldwide after Red Tails (2012), to utilize the new Auro 3D sound technology. The film is also the first of its kind to release via direct-broadcast satellite, also known as direct-to-home (DTH).

The film released worldwide, excluding Tamil Nadu, on 25 January 2013 while the Hindi version was released on 1 February 2013. Legal controversies regarding the film's portrayal of Islamism arose as several Muslim groups protested the film's release in Tamil Nadu, resulting in an official ban being imposed on the film in the state for 15 days by the Madras High Court. The ban resulted in similar decisions being made in Sri Lanka and Malaysia while release was delayed in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Karnataka. Despite the fragmented release, Vishwaroopam garnered generally favourable reviews from critics, most of whom had downplayed claims of the film being anti-Muslim. Heeding to the requests of Muslim groups, scenes perceived as controversial were removed. Vishwaroopam finally released on 7 February 2013 in Tamil Nadu
