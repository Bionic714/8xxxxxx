,Pr0nogo,2013-04-19T15:23Z,"Decent quality for the audio files, but the soundtrack is terrible. There's one or two decent pieces in the collection. The rest is garbage. Unless you collect specific music files, don't bother with this one.

Not an attack on the upload itself, moreso a review of the soundtrack."
,randoml,2013-05-19T03:20Z,"@Pr0nogo The soundtrack is a masterpiece. If you do not like it, why the hell would you download it, anyway?

One of the best soundtracks of 2013, IMHO."
