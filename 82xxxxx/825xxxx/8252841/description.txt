  M83's lush, expansive sound already made their albums feel twice as big as they were, so an actual double album from Anthony Gonzalez and company was inevitable. However, on Hurry Up, WeΓÇÖre Dreaming, he doesnΓÇÖt use that extra space to top the widescreen nostalgia of Saturdays = Youth; instead, he fills it with songs that cover more sounds and moods than any of M83's previous work, resulting in a collection of impressionistic moments rather than a grand statement. The album begins with two songs that reaffirm Gonzalez's flair for the unapologetically epic music that makes him a rarity among artists in the 2010s, electronic or otherwise. He recruits Zola Jesus' Nika Roza Danilova for ΓÇ£Intro,ΓÇ¥ and her unusual mix of frostbitten edge and vulnerable warmth channels the huge emotions Gonzalez favors perfectly. Meanwhile, ΓÇ£Midnight CityΓÇ¥ΓÇÖs sleek neon tones show just how far heΓÇÖs traveled from Saturdays = YouthΓÇÖs ornate sound. However, the albumΓÇÖs first disc goes even farther afield with the tender piano instrumental ΓÇ£Where the Boats GoΓÇ¥; ΓÇ£Raconte-Moi Un Histoire,ΓÇ¥ where a child imagines a world where everyone turns into jungle frogs over bouncy synths and guitars, and ΓÇ£Soon, My Friend,ΓÇ¥ which ends the first half of the album with symphonic grandeur and Beach Boys harmonies. Hurry Up, WeΓÇÖre Dreaming's second disc sounds more traditionally M83, from the triumphant-yet-heartbroken ΓÇ£My Tears are Becoming a SeaΓÇ¥ to the thrilling rush of ΓÇ£New MapΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£Steve McQueen.ΓÇ¥ Despite the sprawl of the albumΓÇÖs size and sounds, Gonzalez holds everything together with wide-eyed enthusiasm. He handles most of the vocals here, singing with a yelp that evokes Howard Jones on ΓÇ£ReunionΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£OK PalΓÇ¥ -- and while this album is as indebted to the ΓÇÿ80s as Saturdays = Youth was, it somehow feels less steeped in nostalgia. Gonzalez displays his uncanny knack for making unfashionable sounds fresh again with ΓÇ£Claudia LewisΓÇ¥' un-ironic slap bass and ΓÇ£SplendorΓÇ¥'s childrenΓÇÖs choir; it takes guts to use these sounds and brains to use them well, and fortunately, he has both. Unlike Saturdays = Youth's wall-to-wall epics, Hurry Up, WeΓÇÖre Dreaming offers ebb and flow, with interludes like the dreamy ΓÇ£Echoes of MineΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£Klaus I Love YouΓÇ¥ tipping the albumΓÇÖs balance toward atmosphere instead of pop songs. More than any of M83's other albums, Hurry Up, WeΓÇÖre Dreaming feels like a destination to explore; while it may not be quite as striking as Saturdays = Youth, it delivers a welcome mix of classic sounds and promising changes.
