,MrBigSeeder,2013-03-14T01:44Z,"thank you beechyboy! was thinking i might end up missin this one, you saved the day! BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM BABY!"
[V],psspss,2013-03-14T02:28Z,"this is really a screen cap by looks not a webrip ?
I saw player buttons? correct?

webrip using tubedigger 2.2.4 (after that no good
as he removed the code to hack adobe streams due to hulu threats)"
[V],psspss,2013-03-14T02:31Z,"i normally use tag.. scrncap,xvid if not a web stream cap

others I say HQwebrip if bitrate is 1000 or higher

and MQwebrip for > 600bit rate 

and LQ for anything less than that"
,Metazip,2013-03-14T04:14Z,"I only get audio, no video"
,abacus23,2013-03-14T06:37Z,"Video Works.  Good quality!
If your video does not work.. use VLC.. or check your video codecs"
,q2323,2013-03-14T11:07Z,thanks
[V],psspss,2013-03-14T11:38Z,"theres a xvid up by ny2 but yes the video and audio work fine in vlc.

I did convert it to xvid but sadly Im ran out of data to share my version like i normally do

when it did convert i must admit the converter cliched for some reason.. it found something it didnt like so maybe why its thrown some downloaders here

NY2 should be fine.. if have problems"
[V],psspss,2013-03-14T11:42Z,hmm ny2 has vanished.. I add my version for people having problems playing mp4s.. cant afford the data as its costly for me
,beechyboy,2013-03-14T13:53Z,"Your right psspss. It is acually is a screen cap.I use Screen Recording Suite. It get's a better output than a downloader. It outputs .wmp @ 1500 kbps then I convert down to 1000kbps .mp4 for smaller file size. I could convert to .avi instead, but .mp4 seems the standard these days?"
[V],psspss,2013-03-15T04:33Z,"but if the web stream is 1000bitrate captureing it at 1500 wouldnt improve it. i know some sites give streams of 1500 but most give sh1t 800 .. or less

did you try tube digger.. it works great.. you might have to right click and refresh if dont load or play etc the first time minor bug in it.. you wont get the play button or ads that way as well

in fact you could take the mp4 it rips and edit out the tags without re-encoding it,, mkvmerge is handy or haalia codec pack mp4 editor name fails me at mo"
[V],psspss,2013-03-19T00:39Z,"some sites may not work with tube digger though..

if all else fails turn it to REC MODE and set the player going and leave it allow it will dump all mp4 and flvs into the folder as they are played and buffer works all the time but you have to basically watch while recording bit like a screen cap"

I see some want to kill the show but i like it
enter fb this
People-against-Spike-TVs-Savage-Family-Diggers/193110227460512

i think the titles are messed up reading about?
but I dont know.. with spike and alike website its no wonder show was moved to sat's as well "
[V],psspss,2013-03-19T09:50Z,"titles seem correct to me.. tv.com has it wrong
think they included a pilot or something as they call this one ep8"
