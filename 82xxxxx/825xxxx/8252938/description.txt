I HAVE JUST MANAGED TO FIND THE COMPLETE SERVICE OR WORKSHOP MANUAL FOR THE NEW HONDA CBR 250R [2011] MOTORBIKE.

AS FAR AS I AM AWARE THIS IS THE ONLY "FREE" COPY AVAILABLE SO FAR ON THE INTERNET!!

IT IS 499 PAGES IN TOTAL AND IS IN .PDF FILE FORMAT

PLEASE BE AWARE THAT IT WILL ONLY BE AVAILABLE FOR A SHORT TIME SO YOU MUST SEED THIS TORRENT TO MAKE IT AVAILABLE FOR OTHERS.

ENJOY AND HAPPY RIDING!!

[I MUST GIVE 100% THANKS AND CREDIT TO "600k2" FOR MAKING IT AVAILABLE FOR ME TO START WITH]

THANKS
