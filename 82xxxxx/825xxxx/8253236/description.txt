The film is based on a real life group of con  
artists who pulled off many clever robberies   
during 1980's, they robbed famous businessmen &
politicians by pretending to be the CBI or     
Income tax officers, on the pretext of         
conducting raids they would take away all the  
black money hoarded by them, the film also     
takes its concept from the real-life daring    
where the same group posing as CBI officers    
executed a daylight income tax raid on         
the Opera House branch of Tribhovandas Bhimji  
Zaveri in Mumbai, and disappeared with         
jewellery worth lakhs. The movie is set in the 
early 1980's.
