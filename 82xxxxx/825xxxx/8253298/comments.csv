,nic198419,2013-03-13T22:57Z,Thank you so much!!
,huskymark,2013-03-14T02:24Z,"Your videos quality are horrible, how can some one actually enjoy this episode with such a poor quality?"
,jc4321234,2013-03-14T03:13Z,"You don't know what horrible quality is, mate.  This is a rip from MTV.com and the only way to get it is in 8 separate segments in flv format. Then they need to be put together an converted to avi.  Quality is gonna be lost when that's done.  So do better and don't download from me. Nobody else puts up copys of this show so good luck...wanker"
,simatha,2013-03-14T13:36Z,Huskymask if your looking for quality why you watching Snooki & Jwoww haha
,huskymark,2013-03-14T22:12Z,"Cause I like garbage shows :D
btw quality doesnt have to be lost after converting to .avi, use  avs video converter 6"
,jc4321234,2013-03-15T03:04Z,"I used AVS v 8.1 with the H.264/AVC, 768 kbps; Audio MP3 , 96kbps profile. Also tried it in Wondershare Video Converter as well with the same results.  There's another option I'm gonna try that might be better quality.  I'm gonna do a reupload "
