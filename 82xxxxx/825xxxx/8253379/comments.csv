Not too sure if it's legit or not, but from the looks of Taylorswiftfreak's other torrents it is. 
I'll seed for a little while once finished. 

Thanks for the upload."
,kundak88,2013-03-13T21:33Z,Can not unpack zip file...
,kurtbra,2013-03-13T21:52Z,"The DLC is working, but when I copy and paste the dlc and update files, my original save from the game doesn't work anymore.

''save slot 1 appears to be damaged and cannot be used''

 I had to create a new save to be able to play the DLC. Anyone know how can I solve this problem?"
,kadulja7,2013-03-13T23:12Z,"Same thing here. Unable to use any of the 3 save files I already have - otherwise a legit download.

Think I'll wait for the fix though, because I can't get past the first 5 minutes of the DLC due to how strong enemies are ( even on normal difficulty ), it's easy to see that this was meant to be played with completely upgraded weapon sets and everything, so this is practically unplayable until save file fix appears."
,Insomneac,2013-03-13T23:29Z,How could anyone not trust a Taylor Swift Freak?

,kadulja7,2013-03-14T01:41Z,"Paperkut, you're dumb. The only thing that doesn't work here is loading your save files.

Anyway this torrent fixes that :

,Nimnot,2013-03-14T02:08Z,"okay, installed update and dlc, and both working with previous saves now.  My only problem is that it is now laggy as hell.  The cutscenes and gameplay are suffering from some sort of fps issue.  Any ideas?"
,Warborn4,2013-03-14T09:04Z,"kadjula7, that version doesn't work either. I tried getting it and it damaged all my saved files as well."
,kadulja7,2013-03-15T01:29Z,"Correct, my bad - everyone was typing on some forum that it worked with that specific torrent so I jumped ahead of the horse. Does anyone have a working save file to share that works with this version ?

Much appreciated."
,Proper_Acid,2013-04-29T17:53Z,Luckily i backed up my saves hope there is some fix soon.
