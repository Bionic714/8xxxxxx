Ep: Fiddler's Inn - Nashville, TN

Air Date: Jun/11/2012


A Nashville hotel has been on the rocks for three years despite the fact it's across the street from the Grand Ole Opry. The owner claims he's been hit by the recession, but the real problems are a gift shop that takes up the entire lobby, filthy rooms, and a lack of identity, and Anthony comes in to make some changes.


Don't forget to say thanks! ;)

Enjoy!!!
