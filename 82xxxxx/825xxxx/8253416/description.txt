 : Was the twentieth century the most violent in history? Are religions or    :
 : tyrants, capitalism or communism the cause of most human suffering? Has    :
 : violence increased or decreased over the course of history? In this wholly :
 : original and remarkably ambitious work, 'Atrocitologist' Matthew White     :
 : considers man's inhumanity to man across several thousand years of history.:
 : From the First Punic War and the collapse of Mayan rule, to the reign of   :
 : Peter the Great and the cataclysmic events of the Second World War, White's:
 : epic book spans centuries and civilizations as it measures the hundred most:
 : violent events in human history. While skeptical of any grand theory for   :
 : the causes of human violence, White does share three big lessons gleaned   :
 : from his careful statistical analysis: one, chaos is more deadly than      :
 : tyranny; two, the world is even more disorganized than we realize; and     :
 : three, wars kill more civilians than soldiers (in fact, the army is usually:
 : the safest place to be). If we study history to avoid the mistakes of the  :
 : past, then there can be no more important place to start than this         :
 : eye-opening and entertaining book.                                         :
