 Description:

Zoe Sophia is a girl who likes adventure and finds it during an exciting and event-packed vacation to Venice to visit her great aunt Dorothy Pomander. Zoe Sophia, along with her dog, Mickey, sees the sights, explores the city, and is involved in a suspense-filled search for her lost pet. Watercolor illustrations capture the essence of these two peas-in-a-pod, their enjoyable relationship, and the beautiful landscape of Venice, Italy.
