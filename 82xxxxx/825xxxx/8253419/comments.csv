,kicksaw,2013-03-13T21:55Z,"No it's not. Save file location is changed. You need to move it to other location (don't know where, sorry). Also - you can disable CloudSaving in config.ini if that don't help"
,kicksaw,2013-03-13T21:57Z,"Save is now stored in the cloud, but it can be disabled. Go to the address C:  Users  * username *  Documents  Klei  DoNotStarve and open settings.ini, and in line DISABLECLOUD change false to true.
     If you need to get save from previous versions of the game, they are located at C:  Users  * username *  AppData  Local  FLT  Steam  211670  remote

,kicksaw,2013-03-14T00:15Z,"Can't find hotfix anywhere (i hope it is included in that file, but not sure). In hotfix they added craftable signs, also fixed too big amount of yellow spiders and few crashes. I try to upload it as quickly as i find it anywhere - my one account was banned on steam (screw you, greenluma! forgot to relog) so cant access DS anymore from steam ;)"
,Easipak,2013-03-14T00:18Z,"Can anyone tell me if it's connecting to the internet or even steam? I want to use Cheat Engine, that's why... I'm cheating on Steam and I don't want her to know! ^^"
,kicksaw,2013-03-14T00:39Z,"No, game is standalone. No steam required, no connection too."
,Teddyatya,2013-03-14T09:32Z,"I can't vhose between characters, saveslots, and the game son't save the game. every time I click on the play button, it genereates a new world. Is it just me, or someone else have the same problem? And how can I fix this?"

and paste it in
