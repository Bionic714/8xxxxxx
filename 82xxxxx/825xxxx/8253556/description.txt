Summary:

WORLDS KEPT THEM APART.

DESTINY BROUGHT THEM TOGETHER.

Aria has lived her whole life in the protected dome of Reverie. Her entire world confined to its spaces, she's never thought to dream of what lies beyond its doors. So when her mother goes missing, Aria knows her chances of surviving in the outer wasteland long enough to find her are slim.

Then Aria meets an outsider named Perry. He's searching for someone too. He's also wild - a savage - but might be her best hope at staying alive.

If they can survive, they are each other's best hope for finding answers. - Goodreads Summary of Under the Never Sky (Under the Never Sky #1)

Note: Mainly for a young adult audience, and recommendable for those who enjoy apocalyptic fiction along with young love. A critically acclaimed book you're sure to love! Book 3, Into the Still Blue, will complete the trilogy sometime in January, 2014. I'll be sure to reload this torrent once I acquire it.
