Description:

Reo-chan, a first-year girl, gets dumped by her boyfriend because she's not skilled in the home economic traits he believes women should have. Her ex tells her that she must apply to a "housework" club before he will reconsider going out with her. Therefore Reo-chan has little choice but to join.

Here's the catch: the only members are four gorgeous bishies. The other first year in the club, Irinaka, competes with her a lot. As the story progresses Reo and Irinaka get forced into a lot of interesting situations together and in the meantime become closer and closer.
