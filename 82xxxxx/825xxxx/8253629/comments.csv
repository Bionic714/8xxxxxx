,bonnerdude,2013-05-11T18:15Z,I'm having a installation error. It tells me to insert disc 1 every time i get to the tenth part in the installation.
,bonnerdude,2013-05-11T18:31Z,Nvm i figured it out. Next time on the instructions please say that u need to copy the files onto the hard drive before setting up.
