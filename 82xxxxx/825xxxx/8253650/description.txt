openSUSE is a free and Linux-based operating system for your PC, Laptop or Server. You can surf the web, manage your e-mails and photos, do office work, play videos or music and have a lot of fun.

openSUSE 12.3 is released bringing the best which Free and Open Source Software has to offer. Much attention in this shorter-than-normal cycle went into details and stability. This includes deeper integration of systemd and improvements to package management as well as a move to 1gb images for the live systems. New are UEFI and experimental Secure Boot support, stable ARMv7 and experimental ARM 64bit images, the KDE Plasma 4.10 desktop, a touch of cloud with OpenStack, Postgresql 9.2 and MariaDB and the latest development tools and libraries.
