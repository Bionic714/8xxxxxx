This sound track was converted from .APE audio format to MP3 format @ 128kbps using freeware Super audio converter.

The original .APE/Cue files are included in a separate folder of this package.

The single Mp3 track which was created by Super was then divided into 9 separate tracks at a bit rate of 128kbps each using Roxio's Sound Editor.

The original un-split MP3 track of the whole album is included with the separate tracks.

Enjoy!
