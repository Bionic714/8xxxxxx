               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Ashampoo WinOptimizer  is an easy-to-use suite of tools for maintaining and optimizing your Microsoft Windows computer. It keeps your Windows installation free of unnecessary garbage and running smoothly while other computers just get slower and slower. Over 100 improvements were incorporated into the new WinOptimizer  by contrast to its predecessor WinOptimizer.

This results in more speed and therefore improved efficiency especially within system maintenance and the adjustment of Windows. The cleaning modules registry optimizer, Internet cleaner and drive cleaner, for example, reach a plus of up to 500% in results. In real time the new live tuner pools all available resources in exactly those places where they are urgently needed. Existing processor cores, Windows priorities and assigned usages of applications are customized, in order to ensure a trouble-free workflow. The resource-saving live tuner runs in the background - just a mouse click away.

Its so easy to tune Windows! Just answer a few special questions about your personal requirements concerning your Windows system and our tuning assistant will automatically choose all suitable options. The concept of the all-in-one user interface has been developed further for the Ashampoo WinOptimizer .
