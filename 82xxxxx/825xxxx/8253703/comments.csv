,ShadzWins,2013-03-13T22:56Z,"Very fast download, thanks!"
,D_A7,2013-03-13T23:40Z,"How do you start the damn dlc ?

I copied everything and when i enter the game there is nothing about dlc. I can load last save or choose continue story which surprisingly loads part after you just crashed with shuttle."
,emp_logtrap_walmart,2013-03-14T00:01Z,"Its pretty simple copy just folder named dlc into your game,then copy the update into your game folder,after that finally copy the crack and run it.

when game starts load your last saved game,if you have finished the game click on play DLC.

Simple have fun.works perfect thanks ghost"
,emp_logtrap_walmart,2013-03-14T00:06Z,works
,Jman2919,2013-03-14T03:31Z,The DLC works thanks! but it damaged all my saves and I have to start all over again. Anyone have any idea how to fix this?
,Jman2919,2013-03-14T04:36Z,This DLC is real but like every other dlc for a torrented game it uses a different crack than the original game so you can't use your saves with the dlc. To retreive your saves once you finish the dlc you have to re apply the original crack you used to crack the original game but then you won't be able to use the dlc
,Warborn4,2013-03-14T08:52Z,Save data damaged. I can't load my previous saved games that already have the game beaten. Ideas anyone?
,epic_seeder97,2013-03-14T14:35Z,will this work on a repacked version??
,D_A7,2013-03-14T15:15Z,"I finally made it work and then i was disappointed how short it was, it took more time to download.

Definitely not worth buying"
,muszek666,2013-03-14T16:04Z,"I copy everythng to my game folder, but in the game i can't find where to start"
,Furyfied,2013-03-14T16:20Z,Does this require Origin or can it be played without it?
,Hugo12317,2013-03-14T16:43Z,"Working THX bro, proof video in progress:)"
,Wywy83,2013-03-14T20:00Z,Anyone had it working with previous saves ?
,Bluntbows,2013-03-14T21:35Z,"1.7MB/s DL speed. Nice!
I think i'm the only one here who hasn't had any problems using saves. 
I'm able to load up everything right into the dlc with no problems."
,Darken070,2013-03-14T22:15Z,I cracked the game and started it but the play DLC option is greyed out. Anyone else having this problem?
,Evil_Z,2013-03-14T22:29Z,"Does this work on retail version of Limited Edition DS 3?  I tried coping some of the files, but it doesn't work. "
,muszek666,2013-03-14T22:30Z,@Bluntbows where i can find it in menu?
,Bluntbows,2013-03-14T22:36Z,"@Muszek 
Upon opening the game, choose which ever save file you want.
Click solo campaign.
Then click downloadable content. "
,muszek666,2013-03-15T00:45Z,"@Bluntbows I can't choose that, damn.

I copy everything to my folder like in instruction"
,muszek666,2013-03-15T00:50Z,"@Bluntbows I can't click on this, damn

I copy everything to my folder like in instrution."
,kadulja7,2013-03-15T01:15Z,This blows so fucking much. Anyone have a save file that works with the crack included ?
,indiyet,2013-03-15T03:25Z,gracias!! Funciona!!
,426Mopar,2013-03-15T05:46Z,"worked 100% for me and I didn't even loose my old save data. just follow the instructions given. if something doesn't work or you lost your save data then YOU did something wrong... lol
Some people are complaing at how short it was, who cares? you got it for free haha I personally enjoyed it. But I guess not everyone can be the same "
,kadulja7,2013-03-15T06:53Z,"Seriously people, it's not something _WE_ did wrong, it's incompatibility between different cracks that's causing save files to not work.

So instead of telling us we did something wrong, PLEASE, if this torrent worked for you and you kept your save file, please DO share your save files with us, as playing Awakened without previous save file is impossible."
,Evil_Z,2013-03-15T07:10Z,"I and few others did exactly what was stated in the instruction, but still doesn't work. I wish the instructions were little more thorough and offered help for those who are having problems getting it to work..."
,MaxMousepb,2013-03-15T09:23Z,not only did this damaged my saves it doesn't even work.. play DLC is greyed out
,426Mopar,2013-03-15T09:43Z,"ok fine, Im honestly new here
what could I possibly do here?
If you have already played and beat the game its self and your save files wont work with Awakened, I dont know what to tell ya. mine worked fine. "
,426Mopar,2013-03-15T09:44Z,"and playing with previous save files is not impossible, as I said, mine worked. didnt have to download anything other than this and the game from a different torrent"
,426Mopar,2013-03-15T09:50Z,"my email: 426.hemi.elephant@gmail.com
tell me what I can do to upload shit here, as I said I am new here
I am not going to upload any good shit though. gonna beat  it on casual and give decent weapons. yall niggas gotta play yourselves lol"
,epic_seeder97,2013-03-15T10:05Z,make sure u run the dlc from the solo campaign menu and not from the main menu
,426Mopar,2013-03-15T11:21Z,"@epic_seeder97
Exactly
this is one thing left out in the instructions, but I kinda figured it out on my own"
,impek,2013-03-15T12:29Z,"Question:
Is it possible to play co-operative on this crack?"
,426Mopar,2013-03-16T03:17Z,"@impek
I am pretty sure you cant
but maybe Im wrong. I have never tried"
,levin123,2013-03-16T14:49Z,the game is working but it doesn't detect my save game
,impek,2013-03-16T18:21Z,"@426Mopar
Well I just downloaded it, single player campagin works on my last saves but co-operative campaign does not work - clicking on it don't do nothing."
,426Mopar,2013-03-17T00:30Z,"@impek 
Im not surprised. I never tried co-op. It seems interesting but I figured it wouldnt work. Im just going to buy the game soon anyways."
,dqz,2013-03-17T08:30Z,Crashes on start. What should I do?
,efg69,2013-03-17T15:01Z,So if I install this DLC before starting the main campaign will I be able to play it normally and then continue into the DLC or do I have to finish the game with the original crack first? I have the Reloaded version of DS3.
,Mimicric,2013-03-18T23:17Z,"Saves made in original game with 3DM crack are incompatible with a new one.

Epic fail"
,MaxMousepb,2013-03-19T03:06Z,Is this stupid I mean if this is 3DM how come my 3DM cracked game saves are not compatible? 
,MH20,2013-03-19T20:59Z,"Shits fucked up, the original exe runner wont let me play the dlc so i have to swap the cracks but that doesnt work with old savs but shows the dlc. with the original one it doesnt, any ideas? have to admit the attached updater doesnt run, says ""activation.dll run failed"" or smth."
,pravilaudavila,2013-03-19T22:02Z,"amazing . my old save is not working and i see no dlc to play , so this just ruined my game , just fuckin great "
,pravilaudavila,2013-03-19T23:00Z,other crack is working with my save but no dlc
,jlocust,2013-03-21T07:47Z,"This Awakened DLC works flawlessly with my ""Reloaded version of Dead Space 3"" uploaded by ""extremezone""... http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8105472/Dead_Space_3-RELOADED 
The save files worked without a problem... Just make sure you run the replaced DeadSpace3.exe crack in this torrent as admin (right click - run as admin) and you shouldn't have any issues ... It is required to have finished the original campaign and I launched the dlc chapter by going to chapter select on the main menu and scrolling all the way to the right to the ""A1"" chapter and begin... Back up your save files just in case but there is absolutely no issue... For those having problems on other releases make sure your launching the exe as admin... Just finished the DLC, started with all my previous gear from the end of the original game and was able to continue after beating the DLC with items I found/created in the DLC chapter... AWESOME UPLOAD... 

1. COPY THE ACTUAL ""DLC FOLDER"" TO TOP LEVEL OF GAME DIRECTORY 2. COPY THE CONTENTS(not the actual folder) OF THE UPDATE FOLDER TO TOP LEVEL OF THE GAMES DIRECTORY (replace all). 3 COPY THE .EXE FILE OVER TO TOP LEVEL OF GAME DIRECTORY(replace)... MAKE SURE YOU ALLOW TO REPLACE ANY FILES WHEN ASKED... PRESTO! PERFECT."
,jlocust,2013-03-21T07:55Z,Again the actual DLC FOLDER to copy over is = [DLC] Dead Space 3 Awakened/DLC-Awakened/dlc 
,enjoi67,2013-03-21T17:10Z,"This torrent does indeed work, you've just got to follow jlocust's instructions because that's what I did and the DLC is available for me to play with my saves. Keep in mind you have to select Solo Player,  THEN downloadable content; you can't select DLC from the menu after loading a save. Good luck."
,MH20,2013-03-21T18:34Z,"once i replace the crack it wont run my savs so nop, and i have reloaded :("
,kadulja7,2013-03-22T09:47Z,"You people commenting on ""how to get it to work"" are starting to piss me off.

Either upload your working save files or spare us the trouble, seeing us who played original 3DM release have uncompatible saves with this release, which no ""correct installation"" or ""download this version of DS3"" will fix. Either share your save files if they're working or don't bother posting at all."
,reyasl,2013-03-22T21:36Z,"agree... i don't want to play the game again.. be kind and upload the save files ^^ repidshare,megafire etc"
,MH20,2013-03-22T22:36Z,agree with second guy above ahhaha. but i wanted to run it from beginning on harder difficulty hmm. 
,efg69,2013-03-23T16:42Z,"Just finished the game and the dlc using the crack from the dlc and it worked without any problems. Guess it's the easiest way to avoid those save game compatibility issues. Btw I liked this dlc more than the actual game it had more scary moments, too bad it's so short."
,hopedeny,2013-03-25T16:09Z,i have a solution. dont use this torrent. ive never seen so many conflicting stories about something working or not. this is simply poorly put together. For those of you that got it working... heres a fucking cookie. im not a fucking idiot so keep your condescending comments to yourself.
,hopedeny,2013-03-26T17:41Z,ok it works. saves are still fucked and starting the dlc without previous saves... this shit really wants you to die. anyway. 2 hours and 2 minutes. thats it. fucking absurdly short.
,JustinJNB,2013-03-29T08:06Z,"For anyone having problems here's how you do it.


1. Copy the actual folder ""dlc"" into your game folder.

2. Copy over everything INSIDE the update folder. (Don't move the actual update folder just copy everything inside it and paste it in your game folder and overwrite.)

3. Copy everything INSIDE the crack folder to your game folder and overwrite.

4. Select the ""download content"" on the campaign page NOT the first page in the game.



ALL my saves worked and I started the DLC with all my guns, suits, etc.


NO viruses also."
,kadulja7,2013-03-30T13:42Z,You're a fucking retard JustinJNB.
,JustinJNB,2013-03-30T15:00Z,Not a fucking retard when it seems like I'm the only one who can get their saves to work.
,reyasl,2013-04-01T18:39Z,justin if your saves work please be kind and upload them on something to can dl them ^^
,JustinJNB,2013-04-06T06:24Z,"reyasl, I'll upload my save as soon as I figure out how to.  Never uploaded before."
,JustinJNB,2013-04-06T06:29Z,"reyasl,  here is MY save.

I don't have it 100% complete BUT this is the save I used to play the DLC.

,mrblackheim,2013-04-16T05:01Z,"I have Dead Space 3 Limited Edition and this doesn't work with my saves... I mean, I tried the DLC and it worked perfectly but my saves are crapped out.. I put the old deadspace3.exe and the saves worked but no DLC. So any ideas would be really appreciate it. Oh, I did the process perfectly. "
,tsoutsouras,2013-04-22T19:29Z,"Τhis DLC works fine with old saves and everything,  I just followed the instructions given by previous posters and it works 100%. "
,anab0lix,2013-04-23T01:52Z,"Thank you!!!  THIS WORKS WITH NOSTEAM's Dead Space 3!!

Thank you JustinJNB.  Follow his directions and it will work.
"
,Proper_Acid,2013-04-29T17:00Z,It doesn't work fucking bullshit i did everything that was told can i can't find the damn Awakened chapter!
,Proper_Acid,2013-04-29T17:47Z,"JustinJNB you are an asshole i doesn't work stop lying you cunt, the DLC button inside the campaign is GREY nothing can't click it, and in the select chapter theres nothing either!"
,Proper_Acid,2013-04-29T17:51Z,The DLC is corrupt guys don't download getting error inside the game luckily i backed up my save game.
,RAMEN00DLE5,2013-05-15T00:59Z,"Goddamn. More shit talk in this thread than any other I've ever seen. That's cool n all but seeing as how I just thought I would fuck about and see if I could find DLC (I figured not with the way they got the shit linked to Orgin and whatnot) for this game and blow my balls, it just may be possible? So what is the real deal here?"
,RAMEN00DLE5,2013-05-15T02:04Z,"Just wanted to post that this upload absolutely IS legit (no shit, Ghost has a green skull after all) and if you having probs just follow Justin's moron proof directions a few posts up. "
,entiupid,2013-05-16T06:25Z,Just installed. Followed JustinJNB's steps and all is good. My old saves worked. I'm at the first cutscene and i'm gonna play now.. oyah..
,Viva_Free,2013-05-18T18:24Z,"I can confirm that the instructions provided by jlocust on the second page actually works but there is one small mix up with them, or a mix up on my part.
He said to actually copy over the whole DLC folder. Some (like myself) might copy over the entire torrent folder but you actually have to copy the fold named ""dlc"" in the torrent. and as @enjoi said choose dlc from the solo play menu after loading you save file."
,araragi-senpai,2013-05-21T22:41Z,The dlc worked fine for me except for the saves. I followed JustinJNB's instructions but the game still kept on saying that my saves are corrupted.
