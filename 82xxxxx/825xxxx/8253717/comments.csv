,karty,2013-03-14T18:14Z,Could some one confirm whether this working without any glitches?
,EnTek9252,2013-03-15T00:02Z,"It works, but it does give the ""thanks for playing fair"" comment but only on your computer and not on the other one.  Also, remember to stop the TeamViewer 8 Service before running the patch.  Also, remember to run the patch as admin.  WORKS GREAT!!!"

,masterjf,2013-03-19T17:19Z,Missing one file
,EnTek9252,2013-03-24T03:24Z,You guys have to know how to install it which you apparently do not.  Are you stopping the service before you replace the files?  IT DOES WORK if you do it right.
,almaseya,2013-03-29T08:29Z,"this is best cracked teamviewer ever i used working fine 
thanks a lot "
,oquatanginwann,2013-04-01T23:05Z,"It will not stay working. None of them do. In a week to ten days, you will get a pop up that says Trial Expired. It will work perfectly before that.

Every connection you start via TeamViewer goes through their servers. They log your MAC address and other things. 

No one has yet come up with a TeamViewer that can stay working successfully.

Even the free TeamViewer Portable, which does not install a Service or write to the Registry stops working, where you get the Commercial Use Suspected pop-up. It used to be you could then simply change your Ethernet card's MAC address to begin again. But that has stopped working as now TeamViewer Corporate is using more than just your computer's MAC address."
