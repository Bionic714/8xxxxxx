The Legion of Super-Heroes say goodbye to Saturn Girl and Lightning Lad, who have just recently gotten married. Soon after their departure, an alien known as Arma Getten invades the Legion headquarters and holds R.J. Brande ransom behind an unstable energy shield, demanding three items for the Legion to retrieve. Left with no choice, the Legion accomplish their goals of getting the heart of a star, a stolen trophy and the crown of the Graxls. However, they don't give it to Arma Getten and actually fight him when his threat of the unstable energy shield was found to be a lie. They defeat Arma Getten, who flees, and they take all the artifacts and burn it into a sun so it can never be used as a weapon.
