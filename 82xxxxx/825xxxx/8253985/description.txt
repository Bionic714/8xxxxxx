DINOBOT WAR!

Happy reunions are in short supply as Grimlock seeks out his Dinobots in a desperate attempt to salvage something from the mounting carnage in Iacon. But as far as they're concerned, he's a traitor who has brought shame on the Dinobot name -- and if they're going down, he's coming with them!
