,crossebby,2013-03-21T10:48Z,"@ roho94

I am downloading KAOS stuff from years, not even single one is fuckedup. Thats how excellent their rips are. U won't be facing any issues with the rip unless U have some messy computer.

@pRemok

give me few hours I almost done downloading I will tell U then."
,crossebby,2013-03-22T05:20Z,"Ok, I finished downloading here is the details

Took 1 hours to extra and install (just click the install.exe and select the destination it will do the job). 

After extracting the game weigh 7.03GB. I started the game and everything working fine. 

For the specs I got xeon 2.33Ghz dual core, 2GB Ram, gtx260. U must at least have dual core processor(quad core will be fine), other wise U will see flickering while game play becoz of high CPU usage, this game little bit demanding on the CPU side. U can play at 720P if U have medial end graphic card.


I just finished 2 missions will comment on the game later. Thanks gansuk I luv U man. Will seed as long as I can.

,crossebby,2013-03-22T18:21Z,"Its a gud shooting game took me about 8 hours to complete the game, the graphics are bit over exposed(it suits the game ) most people find them weird. And its a short story with few sniper rifles. Ok for first time, to me its worth $10 I give 6/10.

U need gud CPU at least dual core or U gonna see lot of flicking or freezing frequenly. Gud luck. I will seed "
