Small hard coded Asian subs.  But very watchable"
,OzConan,2013-03-14T08:02Z,Best Copy so far..much better than all the other R6 releases. I would say Video 8.5/10 and audio about the same. No distortion in this one and small asian subtitles. Perfect until blu ray or screener gets out
,Juhko1985,2013-03-14T17:09Z,English subs anybody?!
