,manu1608,2013-03-31T07:40Z,now why would there be just one comment after 300 downloads?
,manu1608,2013-03-31T10:42Z,"there is no video in this file.
NO VIDEO."
,jalucian,2013-03-31T20:06Z,"First of all, that's a lie, or you're mistaken. And secondly it's not over 300 downloads, it's over 300 SEEDS. The number of actual downloads is exponentially higher than that. There wouldn't BE over 300 people seeding it if there was ""no video in this file."" And the reason there aren't many comments yet is because this torrent was just recently posted and acquired seeds extremely quickly... which doesn't happen if there's a problem with the torrent. You clearly didn't give this much thought before you posted. I just can't figure out if you're mistaken for some reason or just being deliberately dishonest."
,dyslexikchicken,2013-03-31T20:37Z,"manu1608 sounds like an ignorant newb. He demonstrated he thinks that ""seeds"" mean ""downloads"" and for some reason thought there was only one ""file"" in this torrent. There are 4 files, one of which is Ted [Unrated] (2012) [720p] x264 - Jalucian.mp4 which is the video. Not only does the video in this torrent work, it's probably the best quality to file size ratio of this movie that I've yet seen. Jalucian does quality work and has uploaded what looks like close to 40 torrents so far. It shouldn't be too much longer until there's a skull by his name, so saying that there's no video here is asinine. Go troll somewhere else, or at least educate yourself regarding torrents before you say anything else that isn't true, manu1608."
,jalucian,2013-04-01T20:10Z,"One other possibility is that manu1608 tried to view this on a small device like a phone or iPad. You have to look for encodes that are device-friendly because most of them won't work on devices, because they do not support the settings used to achieve maximum compression for retaining quality at low file size. Most devices cannot play anything encoded with more than 1 reference frame, and you can't get really good compression with a ref=1 so most encoders don't use that profile. As it says in my notes, my encodes are optimized for those viewing on their computers. Perhaps I will change the notes to specifically say no hand held devices, but I have a feeling many people don't read the notes closely anyway. "
