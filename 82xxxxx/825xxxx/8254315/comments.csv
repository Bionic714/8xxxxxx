[T],rjordan21,2013-03-16T02:20Z,sorry but this sounds really really bad........
,twistedneverland,2013-03-17T02:30Z," @rjordan21 remember this is an Analog Vinyl Record recorded in an HD Digital format unprocessed, unedited, untouched etc. . 

This is a faithful capture of the original vinyl recording, it is recorded at the records absolute peak with a little bit of headroom to prevent any clipping or distortion. It has not been edited or re-equalised other than through the normal pre-amp stage. Some up loaders will sit there and re-tweak everything to sound more sweet or modern to todays digital listeners, I don't believe in doing that. I leave everything as is. I love vinyl so I keep everything the way it was intended by the studio, artist and disc cutter. I don't have a million dollar turntable or cartridge but it's a pretty decent setup.

This is not a high definition recording in a technical sense because vinyl is not a digital format it's a physical analog format. 

Each record is thoroughly cleaned before it is played back and recorded to prevent static, hiss, pops and crackle sounds. I won't ever record a vinyl record that skips or is severely damaged because that would be pointless. 

To get the best out of these tracks, listen to them on a high quality HiFi system, through your computer with high end headphones otherwise you're not getting the full experience. 

You also may just dislike this album, artist or the sound in general because you may prefer the CD mastered version, If you compare this version to the CD version the LP has better vocals, deep bass and a generally clean cut sound. The CD whilst it still sounds great, has a bit more bass compression and the high frequencies are a bit sweeter and more exagerated. 

Thanks for your feedback and sorry you dislike the upload"
[T],rjordan21,2013-03-17T23:44Z,"After your well thought out response I decided to stream your files to my HiFi and give them a serious listen.  I'm sorry to say my initial comment stands.  I'm well aware of the benefits vinyl inherently has over any digital source but....
with these files they don't compare to the digital.  Bruno's double tracked intro is much easier to make out on ""Just the Way You Are"" and the deep synthesizer note that begins the chorus is almost missing here.  Also, check your speed.... your TT is running fast.
Listen. I don't want to sound like an ass. There aren't many vinyl uploaders here and I applaud your efforts.  Thanks for putting so much effort and time into what you're doing... it doesn't go unnoticed....but, check your TT setup for correct speed man (or woman).

Thanks, I look forward to the next one....  "
