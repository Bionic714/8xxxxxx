"Sing Like a Larry Bird"

Increasingly comfortable exploring the world 
outside of their gated community, the Bird-Kersees 
ignore the Weavers' concerns and decide to go to 
into the city to see a Broadway show. Inspired by 
the experience, Larry decides to put on a musical 
of his own, which goes well until Dick literally 
missteps. Instead of going to Marty and Debbie for 
help (as they have done many times before), the 
Bird-Kersees risk exposing their true identities 
when they call 9-1-1.

18/Very Slow
Evolve... or die.

Enjoy :)
