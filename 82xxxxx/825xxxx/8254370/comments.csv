,binderguy1,2013-03-14T03:09Z,"Thanks for the ul!

Can you believe that I still have these 3 issues somewhere in my long boxes?  I should get rid of them, but don't have the heart to ...

Guess I'm still holding out on the hope that Millar and Harris will still complete this series.  :-("
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-14T03:23Z,"i didn't even know this series existed. what happened, harris get pissed off by millar or something?"
,blogcb,2013-03-14T03:30Z,"@binderguy1: Sounds like Harris has no desire to finish it.  He blames Millar, but with these things, who knows the real truth.  I agree it would wonderful to see the series concluded.  Great stuff."
,binderguy1,2013-03-14T04:03Z,"@blogcb: or they have separate projects which keeps them from finishing War Heroes? Like you say, who knows?

@STFmaryville:  Don't think I've ever seen complete set of John Byrne's Next Men series (#0-30; #1-9; #40-44; 2112), have you?"
,Ogurek4,2013-03-14T04:34Z,"Thanks for all of your uploads STFmaryville... You're awesome!

I'd also like to request John Byrne's 2112 and Next Men. I've only been able to find bits and pieces of the entire collection..."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-14T04:55Z,"i don't have any JBNM scans but i'd like to read them all. i've actually never read any of the releases after the hiatus & publisher change ... last year somebody on demonoid posted a torrent with the complete run, but there aren't many seeders ..."
,Shark011,2013-03-14T21:26Z,"STFMartville: TY sooo much! Acctually I didn't know War Heroes didn't end, but thanks anyway. BTW: Anyone thinking of making a collected torrent for Before Watchmen?"
,Shark011,2013-03-14T21:48Z,"Got another request btw, anyone got a collection of Dark Horse Batman Run?"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-14T22:01Z,"you're welcome Shark011.
and i don't doubt one or more folks will collect the before watchmen comics into one torrent. however, comedian #6 is late.
p.s. what? j.g. jones LATE? honestly i thought it would be adam hughes...
p.p.s. and there was an ""epilogue"" one-shot announced but apparently never solicited? so who knows..."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-14T22:03Z,and you'll have to help me out on that last thing. what is dark horse batman?
,Shark011,2013-03-15T12:27Z,"I'm thinking about the batman run Dark Horse comics had in the 90ties, containing stories like batman: Venom and Batman vs. predator if my memory serves me right. A bit dark and gritty batman. Think you can help me out?"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-15T13:08Z,"yes you're right, dark horse and dc did batman vs. predator ... also you're thinking of batman: legends of the dark knight, it was from dc but not dark horse. :-)

you can find batman vs. predator and its sequels here, http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/5301901/

and here's a torrent with all of the legends series, http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/4131453/

venom ran in #16-20. great story. i also recommend the first 15 issues, and #28-34.

hope this helps!"
,Shark011,2013-03-16T14:57Z,Fan-friggin'-tastic! Thank you so much! 
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-16T23:18Z,You're welcome
