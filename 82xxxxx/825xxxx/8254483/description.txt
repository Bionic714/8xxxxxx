Newest version of Gnomoria as of March 12, 2013

VERSION: 0.8.31
FIXED:
Armor that can't be used, remaining on the map after a goblin left. These shouldn't appear anymore and are deleted when loading old saves.
Crash with smelt jobs where the item was no longer available
General Kingdom Worth calculation fixes
Items not reducing Kingdom Worth if a goblin dropped it, picked it back up and then left the map
Items sometimes adding their value to Kingdom Worth a second time when a gnome dies
GENERAL:
Adjusted enemy spawn strength formula such that slightly higher Kingdom Worth is needed for each stage
Adjusted gnomad formula so that more gnomads arrive earlier and less later
Automatically generate crafting jobs
Reduced mant worker spawns by 20%
Reorder tabs in workshop UI to be consistent with other UI. Default tab is still the crafting tab.

Note: 
You must have XNA installed to play this.
You can find it easilly by googling it.
