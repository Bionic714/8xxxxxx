2010 | ISBN: 1420090976 | 300 pages | PDF | 4,8 MB

ItΓÇÖs been nearly 40 years since the last book on infrared heating for food processing was published, and in the meantime, the field has seen significant progress in understanding the mechanism of the infrared (IR) heating of food products and interactions between IR radiation and food components. Infrared Heating for Food and Agricultural Processing presents the latest applications of IR heating technology, focusing on thermal processing of food and agricultural products.

Coverage Ranges from Fundamentals to Economic Benefits

With an emphasis on novel application, the text includes chapters that address such topics as:

ΓÇóInfrared heating system design
ΓÇóDrying
ΓÇóBlanching
ΓÇóBaking
ΓÇóThawing
ΓÇóPest management
ΓÇóFood safety improvement
Where applicable, this readily accessible guide reviews case studies to address specific industrial issues and the economic benefits of IR heating. Infrared Heating for Food and Agricultural Processing is a well-organized resource for food processing engineers and also quality control and safety managers in food processing and food manufacturing operations.
