The End Times of Bram and Ben #3 [IMAGE]

A 4 issue mini series by James Asmus and Jim Festante, drawn by Rem Broo, that deals with a sort of apocalpyse in which one day every good person is raptured into heaven and vanishes from Earth. One of the title characters is raptured by accident and sent back, leading to crazy consequences, mostly that he abuses the situation for his sake.
