Fifth upload. Worked out what I was doing wrong, 28 shots of vodka can really fuck up your reasoning. 

Anyway, only album this band released, which is a shame, I was surprised not to find it anywhere on here either. Noone remembers them, noone seems to have heard of them. The whole album defines a period in my youth though and I do believe it's a good album.
