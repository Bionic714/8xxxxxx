,almeida024,2013-03-18T09:59Z,"Yes, Quickmilt is correct. My apologies. I merely opened the movie, rated the audio and video and then closed it. 

I now watched the full movie. 

Profanity has, for whatever reason, been edited out. A massive silence when someone swears. 

And the movie ends 5-10 minutes before it should. Even though the gist of the movie is filmed, it would not have hurt to put the end of the movie in. "
