A Tábua De Esmeralda is a 1974 release by Brazilian artist Jorge Ben.
It was ranked by Rolling Stone Brazil as the sixth greatest Brazilian album of all time.
"A Tabua de Esmeralda"--Portuguese for the Emerald Tablet--references a key text in alchemy, whose varied goals included turning base metals into gold and discovering elixirs of immortality and eternal youth. Eternal human concerns, to be sure--figuring out how to make common things valuable, and how to enjoy them for as long as possible. And Jorge Ben Jor's lyrics (according to Google translate, anyway) reference alchemists and their craft, and theories about earth being populated by ancient alien astronauts, but also touch on the more mundane but equally marvelous areas of magic and mystery--the lure of love and obsession, two forces which musicians never tire of describing in all their strange familiarity.
