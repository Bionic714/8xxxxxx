===============================

Axewitch was created by Anders Wallentoft (vocals) and Magnus Jarl (guitar). They were soon joined by Tommy Brage (bass guitar) and brothers Mikael Johansson (guitar) and Mats Johansson (drums). This was the original line-up.

Axewitch won a contest where the first prize was to record in a studio. At the end of 1981, they recorded their EP, Pray For Metal, released in late 1982.

The EP was not a success, but the band continued to play gigs and, in 1983, released its first full length album, The Lord of Flies.

After their second full length album, Visions From The Past, all members except Wallentoft and Jarl left the band. They were soon replaced, but the band's popularity was diminished.

Axewitch released another album in 1985 before eventually breaking up in 1987 with many members coming and going and never releasing any new material.

At the time, Jarl went on to create a band called Sleazy Rose and ex-drummer Mats Johansson joined some of the former Mindless Sinner members to play in a band called Skinny Horse. Anders Wallentoft went on to another band called Regent.
