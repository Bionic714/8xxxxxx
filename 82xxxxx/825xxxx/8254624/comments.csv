,fellmann,2013-03-15T21:01Z,"As i expected. As usual, First 2 EP was good, then they start include ""experts"" who can explain a lot, comparing technology for traveling to the stars with human tech - just as we are smartest assholes in the galaxy. Start to smell like another disinfo series ! BTW - Thanks for upload ! :)"
