But when Violet meets a new friend who seems to be the answer to all Calie's prayers, they will both learn first-hand that even the best of friends can carry their own deep, dark secrets. Meanwhile, in Wonderland, the hunt for the Red Queen and the suicide king continues as they arrive at the Temple of Purity, where even the madness of Wonderland may not enter.
