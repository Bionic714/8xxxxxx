,Jnxd1,2013-03-14T12:19Z,"Be sure to support the band! This is an independent release from the band themselves and funded entirely through Kickstarter. If you like the album spend the $1USD and make sure the band can keep making more music! 

Also, go see them on tour and buy some merch. You buying that shirt is usually gas money for them to get to their next gig! :)

,Ragetoast,2013-03-16T06:41Z,"Thanks, dude. They deserve this to be uploaded. I think they earned a couple of thousand dollars more than they should have off of this."
,DerangedS,2013-03-19T06:34Z,Thanks for the torrent. I bought a shirt but was stupid and didn't even go for the $1 digital download. Figured someone would eventually put it up. Downloaded fast and so far is sounding great.
,ThaWulf96,2013-03-21T00:03Z,np mate. yeah I got a hoodie and shirt and added 5 for the deluxe DL like 5 days later when I went to see if it was funded and was like fuuuu doesnt come with mp3
