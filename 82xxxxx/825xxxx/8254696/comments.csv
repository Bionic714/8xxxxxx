,Mertonoia,2013-03-16T17:49Z,"@pharmakate - In an embarrassment of riches I'd like to request anything you might come across by or of Simone Weil. I believe ""The Need for Roots"" and ""Letter to a Priest"" are already here, which leaves ""Waiting on God,"" Quotations, and a handful of biographical pieces."
[T],pharmakate,2013-03-16T23:07Z,"@Mertonoia - You can't possibly realize how odd it is that you'd request Weil now ... after not thinking of her for years, suddenly I've come across her repeatedly in the past few weeks. And this happened just as I started thinking women writers were under-represented in my torrents. Several of her essays had a great effect on me in my youth.

So. Simone Weil it shall be.

(BTW I'm not done with Merton yet ... just taking a little break.)"
