"Reminiscent of dusty field recordings and the kind of primordial folk heard on The Anthology Of American Folk Music, Some Say Leland is earnestly committed to its version of American roots music, singing lyrical tales of wandering troubadours and weepy odes to hunchbacks over a dry creek bed of banjos, accordion, and brass. While it's tempting to relate them to early 20th-century revivalists like Squirrel Nut Zippers, Some Say Leland's antediluvian bent is far from a gimmick: Its palpable affection for the cleansing power of folk should delight fans of fellow modern-day traditionalists like Will Oldham or Andrew Bird." - The Onion
