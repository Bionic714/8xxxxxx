[V],TheExecutive,2013-03-14T23:29Z,"Thanks for Randi Rhodes and Thom Hartmann.

How about giving Randi or Tom a break and upload Ed Schultz every day instead ?  Ed is cutting back on his MS NBC schedule down to just Saturdays and Sundays now, but his radio show will still be Monday through Friday with a day or two off here and there."
