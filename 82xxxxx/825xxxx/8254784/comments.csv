,maddog7777,2013-03-14T09:55Z,@aarque! Is this one any different then the installer one I downloaded about a month ago that is the 1400 and that has the 1500 update by DCrack? It comes out the the same size with the updates and was not sure if this one is different.
,maddog7777,2013-03-14T09:58Z,@aarque! Sorry I downloaded it in January. It has the installer with guages and ace file and then the cs767_1500 update and 762_1500 update. I just wanted to know if this one is different since I did not experience any issues with the one done by DCrack

,clintferns,2013-03-14T19:52Z,hey ..thanks...will try and see if i can get it installed...req proatc x..if anyone can upload it here if possible..thanks..cheers !!
,aarque,2013-03-14T20:32Z,"As to the source, I got this and many of the shares I offer from Flightboy, he likes to use the warez site and upload to file share sites. He works hard, but the links always die and he goes to great lengths to protect the files, for example, he distorts the file name to hide from search bots (as if) which makes it really hard to do my own search when I know I have something and want to bring it here.
Anyway, have no idea how it relates to the January version, I ran a search, didn't find any matches, so I made a torrent."

,Capt.Jambo,2013-03-17T00:26Z,"Thanx for sharing.

Thing is FMC is black, no thing on it. there is nothing wrong or right with instaling since there is nothing to it, instal run reg file. Anyone has any ideas on what can it be?

Thanx"
