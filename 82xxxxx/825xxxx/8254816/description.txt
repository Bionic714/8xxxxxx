Notes:

This film has a grainy look to it similar to Beasts of the Southern Wild, so I'm assuming it may also have been shot in 16mm. The "graininess" is a product of the type of media used to shoot the film and is NOT an encoding issue. The film is supposed to look this way. The file size here is larger than most of my other 720p resolution torrents because grainy sources require higher bitrates to maintain all that extra detail in the video. Be wary of other versions of this that may have smaller file sizes because they are liable to have pixelation and visible blocking in darker scenes due to insufficient bitrate. 

Please note that my bitrates and file sizes are optimized for those who store and watch movies on their computers. The bitrates are high enough to look perfect on "normal" sized monitors and low enough to keep download times short and the file size small enough for those who have limited hard drive space to work with. If you plan on watching something on a large HD screen, you may need one of the larger file size, higher bitrate torrents. The larger the screen you'll be watching on, the higher the bitrate has to be to maintain picture quality. If you have a large screen, you'll need to experiment too see what bitrate it takes to maintain a quality picture for your particular size screen.

Please seed for as long as possible, preferably until reaching a share ratio of at least 3:1.
