From the author of Falc√≥n (as seen on Sky Atlantic) comes a new series set in the dark heart of London.

Charles Boxer, ex-army, ex-police, has found his niche in private security. His speciality: high-stakes kidnap resolution. But it's a rootless life that doesn't impress his teenage daughter, Amy, or her mother, Detective Sergeant Mercy Danqah.
