,brutal_product,2013-03-14T12:17Z,"You only need a VPN (Tunngle) to play online. It works on home LAN.

RMJ113, you are a fucking idiot on so many levels. You're even an asshole to play with on Tunngle. You're fucking loud, obnoxious and rude. Fuck off."

,iztari,2013-03-14T17:57Z,"@RMJ113 & brutal_product,

Both of you are newbies, rude and inconsiderate of other peoples feelings. Just grow up or shut-up. If you want to have a say here, start sharing stuff before you diss other peoples shares. "
,brutal_product,2013-03-14T22:43Z,I defended this upload. I only stated that it doesn't require tunngle to play on a home LAN. Learn to read.
,Godofchaos95,2013-04-01T07:19Z,So any can comment whether it works? Any issues?
