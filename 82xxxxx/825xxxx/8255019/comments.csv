,DJrorok,2013-03-22T19:31Z,Does not work. none of the accounts work.
,11770,2013-04-24T00:56Z,@DJrorok if you didnt run the game by following the readme then it will indeed not work
,11770,2013-04-24T00:57Z,"@SebbeSebb yes, its an earlier version, thats why it has less levels."
,Pantea_RO,2013-04-29T02:16Z,"Game runs perfectly, read the readme file before. Only downside is that there are only 13 levels; great game still. Download and Enjoy!"
,iored94,2013-05-06T21:12Z,"I'm getting a popup error saying:

Server Error
Could not bind socket. Address and port are already in use.

I read the readme and did everything it said."
,Hyaitus,2013-06-07T01:54Z,"Doesn't work. 

I run reg.bat.

I run start.bat.

I get some ""Could not bind socket"" error, I proceed anyway. I tried all three accounts given and nothing.
