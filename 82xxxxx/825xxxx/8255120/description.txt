The Cuban Missile Crisis of October 1962 was the point at which the world came closest to all out nuclear war. (Unbeknown to all of us at the time, the only other time the world came that close was in November 1983, during the NATO exercise ΓÇ£Operation Able Archer.ΓÇ¥ There are three programmes in this upload:

01 The Photos
The programme talks to the CIA photo analyst whose job it was to prepare a briefing on the crisis for President Kennedy. Includes an extract from an original recording of the initial briefing to Kennedy.

02 The Missiles
The programme talks to a couple of Cubans close to the crisis.

03 The Showdown
The programme talks to American and Russian eyewitnesses, including KruschevΓÇÖs son, Sergei. Includes an excerpt from an original recording of a conversation between Kennedy and BritainΓÇÖs PM Harold Macmillllan.

All three come from the always reliable BBC World Service series ΓÇ£WitnessΓÇ¥. I have to say that I found them fascinating.
