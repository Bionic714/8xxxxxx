Flight Lt. Ken Rees (spelling uncertain) was a pilot who had been shot down over Norway and was held in the POW camp at Stalag Luft III, famous as the home of ΓÇ£The Great EscapeΓÇ¥. Ken was in the tunnel when the escape was detected and thus avoided the fate of 50 of his fellow escapees who were shot by the Gestapo. He is the last of the would be escapees who is still alive.

As IΓÇÖve noticed before, the attitude of these old soldiers is quite extraordinary.
