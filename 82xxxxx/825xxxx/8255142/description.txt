This is the re-upload for Zygor Guides version 4.0.6090, released March 13th, 2013.

The last torrent had an issue which caused seeding from my end to freeze at 67.8%. This torrent fixes the issue. My apologies.

* Loading a guide now starts it in unpaused mode, so it'll start completing immediately.
* Ctrl-clicking the &lt;- arrow now restarts the current guide at step 1 (no more "skip manually to beginning" mayhem!)
* Improved instructions on how to handle Arcanital Mara'kah's protection fields in the Ally Scenario 1 boss fight in Thunder Isle.
