First published in July 1964, Batmania was a comics fanzine published by Bill "Biljo" White, produced for "Batmanians" as the unofficial "fanzine for Batman fans."[1] Appearing under the motto "For Batman, we accept nothing as impossible," White's fanzine was released a year after sales on the two Batman titles ΓÇö Batman and Detective Comics (DC Comics) ΓÇö had "dipped alarmingly."[1] With editor Julius Schwartz replacing Jack Schiff, and "assign[ing] his favorite writer, John Broome, to raise the level of the stories, and his most popular artist, Carmine Infantino, to upgrade the visuals," White's fanzine helped revive interest in the character.[1] Schwartz returned the character to his roots, removing much of the "gimmickry" and members of the then so-called Bat-family ΓÇö Batwoman, Batgirl (Betty Kane), Ace the Bathound and Bat-Mite in particular ΓÇö for a "new look" debut of mid-1964 with Detective Comics #327 (May 1964) and Batman #164 (June 1964), a mere matter of months before White's fanzine debuted.

The title ΓÇö "no doubt inspired by the Beatlemania that had swept the U.S. earlier in the year" ΓÇö released by long-term Batman fan and firefighter White from his home in Columbia, Missouri, swiftly became one of comics fandom's most important fanzines.[1][2] White was himself an "aspiring artist showing considerable potential," who had once written to Batman-creator Bob Kane and produced a regular cartoon during World War II called "The New Bunch."[1] Involved in comics fandom from its earliest days, he contributed to issues of Komix Illustrated, Masquerader, Star-Studded Comics and Alter Ego (A/E), among others.[1] (When Roy Thomas took over A/E, White "served as art editor".)[1]

Batmania had the tacit approval of DC, after White sent a copy of his first issue to renowned fan-friendly editor Julius Schwartz, who liked it, and even gave it a plug in the pages of Batman #169, causing the membership of the fledgling "Batmanians" group to grow "nearly 1,000-strong".[1] The first issue was in such demand that White:

    "kept printing up more and more copies, until the ditto masters gave out ΓÇö and I still couldn't satisfy all the requests. It convinced me more than ever that there was a large body of fans who enjoyed the adventures of Batman and Robin as much as I did."[1] 

This was I think the first Batman fanzine, but I am not postive on that;
This is Super Rare and very very hard to find, as each issue only had at most 1000 copies!  you should see what they go for on Ebay and other comics related auctions! I got as much of the series as I could, but am still missing 2 issues, 17 and 18, if you got them LMK!
