,sacatamatos,2013-03-14T23:33Z,I am not receiving AUDIO with this download. Seems I have ever codec Mac uses for mp4's but they sure ain't working for for this one. I hope this inquiry isn't too simple for all you bright kids to bother with. But I'm not a very sophisticated user. Thanks in advance
,Fonfon222,2013-03-15T01:33Z,@sacatamatos: I'm sorry but I'm not the one who have made this capture and I don't have a Mac neither; so I cannot really help you on this nor can I provide a solution.  There are converters around; maybe one could do the job of converting the sound to a format suitable for Mac?
,Fonfon222,2013-03-15T01:38Z,@sacatamatos: Here's a second suggestion: the VLC player from VideoLan.org (free) is capable of playing multiple types of file without any external codec on the Windows; maybe it has the same capability on the Mac.  You should give it a try.

works perfectly for this torrent. Thanks for your interest. "
,Fonfon222,2013-03-15T16:24Z,@Sacatamatos: glad to see that the solution with VLC worked for you.  Do you have this problem with the sound on the Mac only with the episode #8 or with all episodes of season 2?
