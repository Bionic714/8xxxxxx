Encoded the entire series of the 90's Spiderman The Animated Series into high quality MKV h.264 format with English audio.

Finding this series in a good quality encode was so hard it was rediculous. Most of them looked like crap and barely watchable. There was one that was a set of 80-100MB MKV files but the video quality for those wasnt all that great either, though it was the best copy available that I could find untill now. I can promise this is the best quality version available with hardly any competition out there because it was just that hard to find a very good looking version.

I ripped this series from the PAL DVD releases and converted it to NTSC aspect ratio. 

For playback all you need is the proper codec if you dont already have it. 
Combined Community Codec Pack (which I prefer) or the K-Lite Codec pack should give you all you need and more to play these back.

You should be able to hear audio just fine if you have one of the mentioned codec packs above. If you cannot hear any audio and do not want to install a codec pack for some reason, then you do not have and need the nero aac audio codec. As of today it can be found here.
