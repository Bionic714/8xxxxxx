Gallipoli

War Documentary hosted by Jeremy Irons, published by Cinema Epoch in 2008 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

Academy Award winner Jeremy Irons and Golden Globe nominee Sam Neill narrate this account of the historical battle. It began as a demonstration against the Ottoman Empire by Great Britain and her allies. Nine months later it had become one of the fiercest and most controversial battles of the First World War. Produced over six years and in seven different countries, "Gallipoli" is the story of ordinary men forced by history to do extraordinary things. The courage with which they faced hardship and the sacrifices they made are brought to life through their own words. Newly uncovered diaries, letters, and photographs from both sides; interviews with international experts; on-location landscape, underwater, and aerial photography; 3-D computer animations; and dramatic re-enactments of trenches and battles make this docu-drama not only the newest film on the subject but also the most comprehensive.
