Not only did you honor my request, you did it so quickly!
Thanks so much for this! You made my day! 
Dig your choices for 80s and 90s movies. 

I do have more requests for you to consider...
One more sentimental fantasy. 
And an underrated 80s action film with a budget!

Peggy Sue Got Married
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091738/

Action Jackson
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094612/?ref_=sr_1

The latter has the same director as, Stone Cold.
Another cool torrent you recently uploaded.

Thanks again for everything! Have a good one!
