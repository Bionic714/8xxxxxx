I think it's an automatic translation from Russian, but it's easy to follow.

To make it work in Lion you have to give full access permissions to the directories in /Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/

ReFX Nexus v1.4.1 (Content+Official Banks+Skins) - Mac OSX | 9.5GB


ReFX Nexus - capable of many things, but only the more able you are - from complex storm sounds to powerful dance leads and Gregorian choirs. Its function is freely programmable arpeggiator, flexible Trance-Gate, optimized 4 gigabyte library of over 650 presets, built-in effects, including reverb Arts Acoustic and small requirements for computer resources.
Extras. Information:
