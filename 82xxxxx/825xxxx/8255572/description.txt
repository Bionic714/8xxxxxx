Two BBC 10 min documentaries.


1) A Scottish soldier tells of the ignominy of surrender to the advancing Germans and his horror of the summary execution of one of his comrades. ΓÇ£The Forgotten HeroesΓÇ¥ he describes he and his fellow captives as in a voice which retains its bitterness at their being an overlooked element of the Dunkirk legend.


2) A sergeant (who went on to work for the BBC) remembers his impressions of the retreat. His shame at ΓÇ£liberatingΓÇ¥ jewellery and furs, and disposing of his rifle ΓÇô for which he had no ammunition left ΓÇô are palpable, as is his horror at seeing his comrade swept into the wake of their rescue ship. The picture of him being rescued naked twice is not quite the image we have of the rescued soldiers!
