,rgregb,2013-03-15T07:36Z,"Thanks for uploading these, (PLUS season 1) I just found this show a few days ago and watched all of this season, now going backwards.
Only downside are the teams that score to win rather than honestly, (tough with 250K on the line but Manu and Pete could discard scores that are obvious bullsh#@)"
