Super songs from the "flower power" years of the late 1960s, all original recordings & in glorious lossless (FLAC) format.
This compilation should have a 3rd CD in its set ("Great Britain"). I've lost that, but if I find it in the future I shall upload it separately.
It has been previously uploaded on TPB, but in crappy 192mp3.
