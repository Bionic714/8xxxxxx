,Cad45,2013-03-19T13:47Z,"There seems to be a problem on closing Tomb Raider 2013 even after the current latest patch has been installed... When you close the game and check the system processes, you can see the game TombRaider.exe is still open and using at least 350MB of RAM. When you try to kill the process you get an error message, any fix? "
