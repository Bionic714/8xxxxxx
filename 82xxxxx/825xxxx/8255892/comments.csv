,darkgamerX,2013-03-14T15:34Z,Not working properly on win8 64. Video card does not have enough memory error message. 600 series GPU. It worked first launch with a low frame rate (20 something FPS) now it wont start at all. Sucks because this is one of my favorite games of all time 
,ZtorkX86,2013-03-14T15:53Z,"Try checking compatibility mode and disable themes and desktop composition. I believe admin rights and disable mouse display is already checked, if not then check those too, they might help because of its age. It works great here, Windows 7 64-bit."
,nignug,2013-03-14T16:25Z,"YES! Fucking thank you. Been trying to play this game forever. My friend had it on Dreamcast. Never got to play, many thanks."
,darkgamerX,2013-03-14T16:29Z,ZtorkX86 win 7 compatibility mode worked so thanks for the advice. The game still runs at an extremely low frame rate. On the tittle screen im getting like 18 fps. I made this game run flawlessly at 1080p 60fps on win7 64bit last year. I think this has something to do with win8 because resident evil 1 runs the same way.
,barabusignasius,2013-03-14T17:20Z,Wow blast from the past...Thanks!!!   David Bowie is in this game and wrote and performed a few songs just for it.
,Xigor,2013-03-15T03:39Z,Does this work? I remember last time I installed this game whenever I quit it would half the screen or something forcing me to restart my laptop.
[V],esharoth,2013-03-15T12:22Z,"There are still problems with the game on some PCs, maybe they will sort them out and release a patch."
,jax42,2013-03-15T13:56Z,Thanks for this one
,ZtorkX86,2013-03-15T15:05Z,esharoth@Hopefully and please keep an eye on the patches if they do. ;)
,nignug,2013-03-16T09:21Z,"Spoke too soon. The game becomes unstable in the Tetra factory. About 3/4 of the way through I keep getting killed randomly even when I have full health. It is impossible to pass the level, even on easy mode. I just keep dying in the same general area out of nowhere. Was a good game up until that point. Oh well."
,melloyello33,2013-04-04T16:11Z,"A patch has just come alive. It would be awesome if you could upload it.

Thanks!"
[V],esharoth,2013-04-07T21:38Z,"It's a really small patch, under 1 MB. You can grab it from here:

bayfiles.com/file/Nkn9/GnTRaD/patch_omikron_-_the_nomad_soul_2.0.1.8.exe"
,melloyello33,2013-04-08T11:40Z,"Thank you very much, esharoth, you are the man!!

Unfortunately I've tried everything since yesterday to download from Bayfiles but I just can't, it never starts downloading the file. It is really frustating. 

Would you be so kind to make a torrent of it? Or anything else? It would be very much appreciated. 

Sorry for the incwonveniences and thanks a lot again mate!!"
,xdbs,2013-04-08T17:14Z,"I would also have to kindly ask for the patch. It seems this patch is for people that have graphic issues with high end video cars. People with 1.5gb of memory or more. 

Bayfiles isn't sending the file to me as well, is there any chance you could upload it at your convenience when you get a chance?

Thank you very much."
,melloyello33,2013-04-08T17:42Z,"Well, Bayfile finally seems to work. I've downloaded the patch succesfully after a lot of attemps (I really lost the count). 

Thanks a lot, esharoth!! Thanks for everything :)"
,xdbs,2013-04-08T18:30Z,"melloyello33

Is there anyway you can upload it to a different place or something of the sort? I would like the patch as well, and bayfiles is not working for me at all."
,russianhornybear,2013-04-22T18:55Z,"If someone have unsolvable issues just play on Dreamcast emulator :) Game overall better ,32 bit color ,etc. Downside only a limited area of town you can see but this cant be a big problem :) console limitations."
,russianhornybear,2013-04-22T18:59Z,"Forgot to say , on latest versions of Dreamcasst emu this game broken so best will be old version from emuparadise site NullDC 1.0.4
:)"
,GanjaStar,2013-04-30T16:07Z,"Any chance for an alternate patch link? I cannot open bayfiles at all.

thanks in advance"
,boubouk,2013-05-01T15:14Z,"The link is wrong, i replaced .com by .net and it worked.
http://bayfiles.net/file/Nkn9/GnTRaD/patch_omikron_-_the_nomad_soul_2.0.1.8.exe"
,GanjaStar,2013-05-02T16:19Z,"thx boubouk, working fine now"
