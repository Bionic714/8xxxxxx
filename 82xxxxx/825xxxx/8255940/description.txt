This is one of my favorite live albums from Iron Maiden.All the songs performed from Dance Of Death album sound better than the studio versions like Paschendale and Dance Of Death.I had the opportunity to see Maiden in this tour at the Tacoma Dome in Tacoma, WA. This album is awesome and I hope that you enjoy it like I do. Please seed and support the band in way way you can.
