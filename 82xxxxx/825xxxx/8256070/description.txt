Faced with no other choice, Kyra decides to do what she does best: poison the kingdomΓÇÖs future ruler, who also happens to be her former best friend./DIV But, for the first time ever, her poisoned dartΓÇªmisses. DIVNow a fugitive instead of a hero, Kyra is caught in a game of hide-and-seek with the kingΓÇÖs army and her potioner ex-boyfriend, Hal. At least sheΓÇÖs not alone. SheΓÇÖs armed with her vital potions, a too-cute pig, and Fred, the charming adventurer she canΓÇÖt stop thinking about.
