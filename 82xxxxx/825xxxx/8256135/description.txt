From the powerful opening a cappella melody "Sing Sing" to the raw, folk/blues-infused tracks "Just Another Day" and "Again By You" to her stunning rendition of the Etta James' classic "At Last," welcome to the rsound of the young new singer/songwriter/guitarist Serena Ryder. Ryder's confident, full-bodied three-octave range and witty, insightful lyrics belie a musical maturity far beyond her years. 

Growing up in a small Canadian farming town, Serena Ryder spent untold hours of her childhood listening to music with her mom, everyone from Rita Coolidge and Linda Ronstadt to the Beatles and Roger Miller. She started performing at age 7, with her first stage gig at a local bar singing Buddy Holly songs to a crowd of old-timers. Since then, she has taught herself to play guitar, and has written loads of her own songs, and has captivated audiences across Canada and Australia. Now it's time for the U.S.. to fall under the spell of what Rolling Stone France called "a truly magnificent voice"
