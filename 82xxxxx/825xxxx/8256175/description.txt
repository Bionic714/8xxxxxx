Recorded when legendary Chicago blues harpist Walter 'Shakey' Horton visited the UK in 1968, Southern Comfort is a superb showcase for his talents, as well as those of bassist Jerome Arnold (the Butterfield Blues Band), drummer Jessie C. Lewis (Otis Rush) and trailblazing guitarist Martin Stone (Savoy Brown and Mighty Baby).
