It's late, but done.  Because of all the problems with the source captures, I almost didn't do this season...  but my friend, Cindy, kept harpin' on my equus africanus asinus, so I jumped through hoops, learned another Unix encoding tool, and completed it.  The hardest part was getting good audio, as one source kept providing stereo audio where somehow they managed to, from 5.1 audio, put the center channel on the right, and one of the rear surround channels on the left.  &gt;.&lt;  I averaged 2.7 downloads per episode to get good audio to go with the video.  Thankfully I was able to avoid MKV for all but 4 episodes, as re-encoding those takes nearly a day (at 720p), while a 1080p MP4 takes about 20 minutes.

So, here they are, all 13 episodes, of the third season of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic.  Playable on most portable devices, smart TVs, and all computers.
AVI, Xvid 23.976 fps, 848x480, Stereo Normalized 44.1/128

The bonus is non-standard AVI, H.264 30fps, 640x360 Stereo AAC, so it may not play on a large number of devices.

So, until the fourth season, which is rumored to be a full 26 episodes again... or if Cindy wants it, Equestria Girls.

Enjoy,
