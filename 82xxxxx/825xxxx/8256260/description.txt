 Mauro Mancia, Psychoanalysis and Neuroscience
ISBN: 8847003342 | edition 2006 | PDF | 433 pages | 3 mb


The papers collected in this volume have the aim of integrating the contributions from two disciplines: psychoanalysis and neuroscience. Recent great developments in the latter offer the opportunity to build a bridge to psychoanalysis, providing an anatomo-functional basis for some of the functions in which the psychoanalytic theories of the mind are rooted.
