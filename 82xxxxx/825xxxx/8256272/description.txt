Tyler, Texas based newcomers FIT FOR A KING just might represent how that metaphor applies to a band. By forging ahead on their own path, making music well beyond their years, making it from the heart, and laying waste to their peers in the process, FIT FOR A KING have created a thing to marvel at - an impressive independent campaign that exemplifies the way ΓÇ£the gameΓÇ¥ should be played by an upstart band.
