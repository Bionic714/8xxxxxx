For those of you who are already fans of Mr. Burr, his new record O Ye Devastator is finally here. For those of you unfamiliar with Doug Burr, we think this will be a great treat for your ears and soul. Burr resides in the beautiful city of Denton, TX, and is by no means a stranger to making music. O Ye Devastator is his 3rd release with Spune and Velvet Blue Music, which is the proper follow-up to 2007ΓÇÖs much adored, On Promenade. Between these 2 records Burr recorded a project called The Shawl, which was a shimmering and heavy laden vision of the Psalms.

Doug has been building a steady fan base through his shows, his songs appearing in TV shows, and an ever increasing amount of press. Of course, opening for St. Vincent, Richard Buckner, and Great Lake Swimmers has helped as well. He began polishing most of these songs last year while on tour with Son Volt. Doug has explained the theme of the album to be American roots music rendered as sweeping scenes and story lines, antique, revelatory, and futuristic in scope. After a listen through the album, we think youΓÇÖll understand what heΓÇÖs talking about.

Burr returned to producer Britton Beisenherz and to Ramble Creek Studios to translate his live sound into studio recordings. The result is a natural sound, earnest and real. Basically, itΓÇÖs the foundation that BurrΓÇÖs career has been built on. The players that make up the rest of the band include Roberto Sanchez on drums, Todd Pertll on pedal steel and banjo, Glen Farris on keys, banjo, and guitar, and Britton Beisenherz on bass and guitar. The cross section of gentle guitars and banjos to dirty distorted guitars and driving percussion always find BurrΓÇÖs melodies in perfect step, though it also leaves us all with a sound that is hard to describe in print. Something we really feel is a great thing!
