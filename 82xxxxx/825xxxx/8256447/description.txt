Spectral Dusk, the sophomore album from Canada’s Evening Hymns, focuses on the loss of core member Jonas Bonnetta’s father and coming to terms confusion, frustration and emptiness that comes from losing a loved one. The record is in essence a heartfelt love letter from a son to his father filled with memories, heartbreak and healing. Spectral Dusk is a beautiful album and a few standouts include the contemplative “Asleep in the Pews”; the teary, broken steel guitar on “Moon River”; the string arrangements on “Irving Lake Access Road”; the anger on “Family Tree”; and the tender hymn “Song To Sleep To.” If you are new to the Evening Hymns, this is a wonderful intro and gorgeous, heartfelt album well worth seeking out. – Written by JFelton
