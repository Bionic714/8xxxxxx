Editorial Reviews
Review
"In this excellent and timely addition to the series, Bronson (humanities, York University, Toronto) pulls together 18 international scholars and writers who examine both Stieg Larsson's novels and the movies based on them. Main characters Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomkvist each receive a section devoted to essays on identity politics, feminist dimensions in culture, and other salient and philosophical concerns they personify. Larsson is treated in a third section of essays, with the final two sections taking on secrets and ethics. Contributors include Karen Adkins (philosophy, Regis Coll.), Ester Pollack (journalism, Stockholm University), Andrew Terjesen, who has contributed to other volumes in the series, and James E. Mahon (philosophy & law, Washington and Lee Univ.). They take up such specific considerations as Lisbeth's sexual identity, Mikael's investigatory methodology, and the ethical nature of social institutions; of course, each essay suggests philosophical assertions that can be and are argued against as well as for, making for a heady and welcome whole. You'll learn how Aristotle and KantΓÇöamong othersΓÇöcan be illuminated through the "Millennium Trilogy." VERDICT This volume belongs in both popular and scholarly collections." [The book is not an officially licensed product of the Larsson books or the movies.ΓÇöEd.]ΓÇöFrancisca Goldsmith, Infopeople Project, Berkeley, CA (Library Journal, November 15, 2011)

Would Aristotle read Larsson's mystery books on a beach?

Can revenge be ethical?

What's the deal with all that coffee?

Drawing a thin moral line between their own actions and the criminal schemes they seekto unravel in the international bestselling Millennium Trilogy, tattooed and troubledcomputer hacker Lisbeth Salander and disgraced middle-aged journalist Mikael Blomkvist form the most unlikely pairing of heroes in popular fictionhistoryΓÇöand one of the most compelling. Drawing on some of history's greatestphilosophical minds, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and Philosophy gives fresh insight into the complex ethical framework of this sleuthing odd couple and the key epistemological themes driving Stieg Larsson's ingeniously plottedtales of crime and corruption in Sweden's dark underbelly. Topics such as theAristotelian arguments for why we love revenge, Kantian theories explaining why so many women sleep with Mikael Blomkvist, feminist readings of Lisbeth Salander, andLarsson's views on skepticism offer a huge helping of metaphysical morsels that will more than satisfy the intellectual appetite of devoted Larsson fans everywhere.
