The latest Iron Maiden live album, En Vivo! Was recorded in Santiago, Chile. For those who know Maiden well you know they love South American Fans, specially Steve Harris. He said one time at an interview that he would play only in Central and South America if he could because the fans there are incredible and very energetic. This concert specially the video captures that in detail. They perform very good songs from their latest Final Frontier album plus some classics. I hope everyone enjoys this great album and please don't forget to support this great band and seed do others can enjoy too.

UP THE IRONS...

IRON MAIDEN Is the best band ever... I Love it.
