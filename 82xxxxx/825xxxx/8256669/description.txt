Aqua Mail ΓÇô new email app PRO v1.2.2

Requirements: 2.0+

Overview: Integration AquaMail is a new email app for Android 2.1 and higher.

Easy automatic setup for popular email services (Yahoo, Hotmail, Gmail, and more).

Support for many other email services via standard Internet email protocols: IMAP, POP3, SMTP. This includes many corporate email servers, such as Lotus Notes and Exchange, provided that the administrators enabled IMAP/SMTP.

Integration with Tasker (change settings, trigger mail check).

Integration with Enhanced SMS & Caller ID, Light Flow, Cloud Print.

Lots of settings to configure the application just the way *you* would like. Separate settings for WiFi and mobile connections.

This is the Lite version, which is limited to two accounts, no identities, and adds a promo signature to all outgoing messages with a link to the program's web site.

You can add more than two accounts, use identites, and remove the signature by purchasing the Pro key here on Market at any time.
