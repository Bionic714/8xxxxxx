------------------------------

Pairs of celebrities on terrifying car journeys: as the first series showed, it's a formula with a happy mix of jokes and jeopardy. Thanks to all your comments for the first Series, we decided to present you the second part of Most Dangerous Roads In The World. Mostly it includes the roads that you have suggested as well as other well known and popular dangerous roads. Have a great time checking these!


1)  Siberia 
Good friends and fellow comedians Ed Byrne and Andy Parsons brave temperatures as low as minus fifty to drive across Siberia's infamous Road of Bones. Along the way they encounter all that Siberia can throw at them from terrifying roads of ice and deserted gulags, to the surprising welcome of the people who inhabit this freezing wilderness. Ed and Andy soon learn the rules of road in this remote region - never turn the car engine off and refuel on the go but the further they get along the road, the more they realize they are out of their depth.

2)  Ho Chi Minh Trail 
Sue Perkins and Liza Tarbuck drive the legendary Ho Chi Minh Trail, a network of dangerous roads hacked through mountains and jungles of Laos and Vietnam. Its role in the Vietnam War has left it one of the most perilous roads in the world as it is littered with unexploded bombs. Sue and Liza face a gruelling drive to some of the least explored sections of the trail, with both terrifying and hilarious consequences.

3)  Ethiopia 
Comedians Hugh Dennis and David Baddiel drive over 2000km of Ethiopia's death-defying, bone shaking roads, in a quest to reach Aksum, known as the home of the Ark of the Covenant. Along the way they have to compete with truck drivers high on local drug khat, a calamitous breakdown and a shortage of fuel in the middle of the night. At times, it seems like David and Hugh will need a miracle to get them to the end of the road and the holiest place in this deeply religious country.
