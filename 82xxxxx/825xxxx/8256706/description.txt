
Islam was spread by the swords and by the guns when illitrate Muslims conquered third world countries and carried away with their treasures of gold and other goods. The third world were comprised of primitive people who were animists.

Islam was spread with the conquest of the third world by the Jihads.

Muslims have the belief that as of now, the world is a house of war Dar al-Harb & till it accepts Islam it will remain so. Thus, the duty of every Muslim is to turn this "house of war" to a "house of peace" Dar as-Salam.

Now how do they achieve it? The Quran provides them with a solution. i.e kill non Muslims if they refuse Islam.

"Muhammad said, ΓÇÿYou are commanded to carry out jihad against the unbelieving infidels until they submit to Islam' " (Qur'an 47:4)

Qur'an (8:12) & 107 other verses in the Quran echo the same message of Jihad.

Muslims are also given the assurance that if they kill non Muslims they will get eternal rewards.

Quran (9.111): Allah hath purchased of the believers their persons and their goods; for theirs (in return) is the garden (of Paradise): they FIGHT IN HIS CAUSE, AND SLAY AND ARE SLAIN: a promise binding on Him in truth, through the Law, the Gospel, and the Qur'an: and who is more faithful to his covenant than Allah? then rejoice in the bargain which ye have concluded: that is the achievement supreme.

Verses like Qur'an (4:74) & many others speak of eternal rewards.

So basically Muslims don't care even if they die while doing their Jihad because Allah has promised an eternal reward for them. Muslims that follow Islam are very faithful towards their religion & they believe that whatever is there in the Quran is for real.
