Relation theory originates with Hausdorff (Mengenlehre 1914) and Sierpinski (Nombres transfinis, 1928) with the study of order types, specially among chains = total orders = linear orders. One of its first important problems was partially solved by Dushnik, Miller 1940 who, starting from the chain of reals, obtained an infinite strictly decreasing sequence of chains (of continuum power) with respect to embeddability. In 1948 I conjectured that every strictly decreasing sequence of denumerable chains is finite. This was affirmatively proved by Laver (1968), in the more general case of denumerable unions of scattered chains (ie: which do not embed the chain Q of rationals), by using the barrier and the better orderin gof Nash-Williams (1965 to 68).
Another important problem is the extension to posets of classical properties of chains. For instance one easily sees that a chain A is scattered if the chain of inclusion of its initial intervals is itself scattered (6.1.4). Let us again define a scattered poset A by the non-embedding of Q in A. We say that A is finitely free if every antichain restriction of A is finite (antichain = set of mutually incomparable elements of the base). In 1969 Bonnet and Pouzet proved that a poset A is finitely free and scattered iff the ordering of inclusion of initial intervals of A is scattered. In 1981 Pouzet proved the equivalence with the a priori stronger condition that A is topologically scattered: (see 6.7.4; a more general result is due to Mislove 1984); ie: every non-empty set of initial intervals contains an isolated elements for the simple convergence topology.
