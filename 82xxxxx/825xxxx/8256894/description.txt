Oz Books

Oz is fairyland originally created by L. Frank Baum as stories he told his four sons and their friends.     

There are forty Oz works that are considered "official" Oz works.  The authors of these works are referred to as "Royal Historians of Oz".
 
Baum proceeded to write 14 Oz books, the first of which, ΓÇ£The Wonderful Wizard of OzΓÇ¥, was published in 1900.
Ruth Plumly Thompson took over as a Royal Historian of Oz in 1921 with The Royal Book of Oz (originally authorship was wrongly attributed to Baum) 
and proceeded to write an Oz book a year for nineteen years until 1939.
Several authors wrote the final seven books of the official series.
