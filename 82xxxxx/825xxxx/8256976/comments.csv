,MadRevolver,2013-03-14T21:06Z,"the most people never check for the hotfixes. They download the release and they never check again. but I check! and you upload them because you are an awesome human being. Thank you a lot for your time to make it playable for us, the puny mortals :-)"
,kicksaw,2013-03-14T23:26Z,"Well, if there is game breaking hotfix, like this one then why not upload it :D

If that could be only ""added sign, and reduced amount of yellow spiders"" fix i think i could skip it. BUT if it repair critical things like crashes or lost savedata then i suppose it's my duty :D"
,kujek,2013-03-15T23:12Z,Works like a charm. Thanks for the updated game. A pity it doesn't have coop mode.
,iaureee,2013-03-27T23:52Z,"when are you uploading March 26 2013 - Doorway to Adventure with the hotfix, it has some very sweet changes, especially the lighting rod that i need so much."
