A game prequel to the film series featuring the sinister ex-criminal from the films Pitch Black and Chronicles of Riddick. The game features an advanced graphics engine which makes extensive use of normal mapping and other advanced texturing techniques in a first-person shooter/adventure game starring Vin Diesel as the titular anti-hero. The character Riddick has heightened sensory abilities that allow him to see and hear beyond normal human ranges and these abilities are engaged whenever he's crouched in "stealth mode." You'll have the option to use different combinations of stealth, action and even the environment to your advantage.
