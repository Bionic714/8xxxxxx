A Real Dead One is a live album by the British heavy metal band Iron Maiden, recorded in 1992/93 at concerts across Europe, and released on 25 October 1993. This album features songs from the very beginning of the band's career (1975) through the Powerslave era (1984), while counterpart A Real Live One only contains songs from the post-Powerslave albums.

When Iron Maiden re-released all their albums in 1998, this album was combined with A Real Live One to form the 2-disc A Real Live Dead One.

The album cover was made by long-time Iron Maiden cover artist Derek Riggs, and depicts Eddie as a disc jockey in Hell, playing old Maiden tunes.

"Hallowed Be Thy Name" was released as a live single. On the Billboard Music Charts, "Hallowed Be Thy Name" hit number 50 on the Mainstream Rock chart.

Another great live album from Iron Maiden, I love this one because it has songs from Paul Di'Anno era singed by Bruce Dickinson and also has a very cool version of Transylvania, an Instrumental song by Maiden. The only drawback from this album is that Adrian Smith wasn't in the band at the time but still is very good. Enjoy and seed please.
