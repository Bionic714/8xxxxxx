A Real Live One is a live album by the British heavy metal band Iron Maiden, released in March 1993. The album tracks were recorded at 9 different venues in Europe on the Fear of the Dark World Tour. This album features songs from the Somewhere in Time (1986) through Fear of the Dark (1992) eras, while A Real Dead One only contains songs from the pre-Somewhere in Time albums.

When Iron Maiden re-released all their albums in 1998, this album was combined with A Real Dead One to form the 2-disc A Real Live Dead One. The album cover was made by longtime Iron Maiden cover artist Derek Riggs, whose contribution to the Fear of the Dark album were rejected. "Fear of the Dark" was released as a single.
