"Move On" is the story of a flawed hero, played by Mads Mikkelsen and his journey throughout eight different countries in Europe. After stepping off a boat in Rotterdam he receives a mysterious silver suitcase. Delivering it from north to south is going to be his very last job, he assures. But what sounds like a simple transportation happens to become a thrilling chase with a secret counterparty and his own past.
He doesnΓÇÖt know what is inside the case, but his chasers seem to. And they are willing to do everything to take it from him. On this action-packed odyssey borders between friends and enemies seem to disappear. Not knowing whom to trust and whom to fear he starts a romance with a young woman (Gabriela Marcinkova), he meets on his way. But is she really just the charming pick-up she seems to be or is she after the case, too?
