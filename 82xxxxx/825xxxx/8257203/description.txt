IN MEMORY OF CLIVE BURR 1957-2013



Rainbow Theatre, London, England, June 20, 1980


There's a bootleg of this show called "Before The Exile", which does not include Transylvania and Strange World, that's why this version is so called "Complete Exile".

This show was filmed for a live video but the band had to play the set twice because they had issues recording the first set, so the songs listed are not the official ones.
