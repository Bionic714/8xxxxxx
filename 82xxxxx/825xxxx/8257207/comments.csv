,minibos,2013-03-18T12:29Z,"Don’t you get it it’s called paid marketing.

The developer of this game is small obscure company, they already made two previous games and charged people a lot of money for it.

But now the got a bit smarter ( Sega/sports interactive/fm 2013) smarter, so the approach a individual within the SKIDROW scene, and pay him some money to crack the game, but nuke it in some way (e.g. the save game can’t load) so the people can try the game but can’t actually play it.

What will happen is that a lot more people will actually get to try the product which is ridiculously expensive 49.00 Euros, some of the people will get hooked up, and will actually buy the game, pay a lot of money for a faulty product.

This is nothing more than paid marketing, same thing happened with Football Manager 2013"
