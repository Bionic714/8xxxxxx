,Mno74,2013-03-16T07:58Z,"@oudi1988 Look at answer to GopherTEE

More Info:
This does NOT work on 4.30 OFW or 4.31 ofw
or ULTRA SLIM or PS3 SLIM with a serial in 3000`s
This only works on CFW 3.55 4.21 4.30,
SGK`s cfw 4.31v3.2, v4.0, v4.1, v4.2, v5.0, v5.2
Have QA installed on cfw 3.55 for less brick"
,Mno74,2013-03-16T08:01Z,"this cfw is not for everybody, I do not recommend installing it unless you have a hardware flasher.

 my understanding is it is designed for french jailbreakers.

 if you are a beginner go with rogero or rebug.

 it is interesting because it is a true 4.31 cfw from what I have read, it is however of no use to me, I speak english and don't want to test it because I don't have a hardware flasher. "
