,Gyurci80,2013-03-14T22:52Z,"Sadly,cracking Sim City is harder than thought..."
,sh0rtz,2013-03-15T00:47Z,anyone unable to saving/loading games? ive tried several things and still cant solve it :/
,djaponja,2013-03-15T03:08Z,"@sh0rtz yeah,i have that problem too.the save is there because when i play the new game and go save,it wants to overwrite the previous save.i just can't access the save =("

,tambu90,2013-03-15T05:42Z,thanks men
,goingmad1,2013-03-15T12:15Z,Nuked crack. As usual with shitrow releases...
,Arbiter89,2013-03-15T14:00Z,"I'm having the problem as well. You can't save the game with the current crack, and there are still bugs. Fixed crack when?"
,Liman_Bot,2013-03-15T14:22Z,"Masters.of.The.World.Geopolitical.Simulator.3-SKIDROW ]--[ bad.crack_not.working.on.xp.or.7 ]
Scene notes :/ Wait for crack fix."
,Torcidas50,2013-03-15T18:00Z,I can't open game....I need ACTIVATION CODE!WRITE DOWN PLEASE
,Arbiter89,2013-03-15T19:04Z,"@Torcidas50

You didn't copy the crack."
,Anonymous961,2013-03-15T19:24Z,anyone having an antivirus alert abt buddha.dll ?
,Vermon,2013-03-15T23:32Z,Hopefully Skidrow will make a crack fix for profiles and saves......
,Durara,2013-03-16T07:13Z,What about Cities XL Platinum?
,Durara,2013-03-16T07:27Z,Can you/will you upload Cities XL Platinum?
,whitehairdemon,2013-03-16T09:02Z,Works great. Make sure you allow 7z to extract completely. 
,Arbiter89,2013-03-16T09:23Z,"When's the crack fix going to come out? Surely it can't be that hard, shitrow."
,Arbiter89,2013-03-16T09:27Z,"New errors, it seems the game has no music while playing. There is music in the main menu, but absolutely no music in the gameplay. Additionally, you cannot load savegames. Please fix."
,Arbiter89,2013-03-16T09:27Z,"@whitehairdemon No, it doesn't work great, because you cannot load the game you saved."
,PunyTit,2013-03-16T13:23Z,"This game is partially a wannabe of the SimCity, but global. Game's graphics are awful, it's boring to death and the overall feeling is that the game was created in 2003, and not in 2013."
,Arbiter89,2013-03-16T14:13Z,"@PunyTit

You're fucking retarded. The only thing this game and SimCity share is that they're both strategy. If you have no interest in it, don't come into the comment section to complain and fuck off to your Always On DRM pile of shit."
,Stavros0141,2013-03-16T16:53Z,illuminati simulator?
,jpweb72,2013-03-16T19:01Z,"i like this game more that simcity is a petty that the crack doesnt save

I cant even buy this game coz there is nowhere to  be found on the stores "
,ventouziarhs,2013-03-16T23:16Z,"everytime i go ""hire a minister"" game crashes.."
,Arbiter89,2013-03-17T15:01Z,Fixed Crack when?
,Nicolas55,2013-03-17T15:43Z,"The game is good, well improved from Rulers of Nations, according to forums. I hope Skidrow and the others won't just move on after releasing the faulty crack, but will develop a crack fix soon."
,whitehairdemon,2013-03-17T16:11Z,Can't load saved game ... what a pity.
,dufuqisit,2013-03-18T02:05Z,I cant find the crack in the skidrow folder
,dufuqisit,2013-03-18T02:38Z,I cant find the crack in the skidrow folder
,minibos,2013-03-18T12:22Z,"Don’t you get it it’s called paid marketing.

The developer of this game is small obscure company, they already made two previous games and charged people a lot of money for it.

But now the got a bit smarter ( Sega/sports interactive/fm 2013) smarter, so the approach a individual within the SKIDROW scene, and pay him some money to crack the game, but nuke it in some way (e.g. the save game can’t load) so the people can try the game but can’t actually play it.

What will happen is that a lot more people will actually get to try the product which is ridiculously expensive 49.00 Euros, some of the people will get hooked up, and will actually buy the game, pay a lot of money for a faulty product.

This is nothing more than paid marketing, same thing happened with Football Manager 2013"
,Vermon,2013-03-18T14:43Z,"So it's up to us to find a group that would make a crack. 50 Euro, that's a fucking joke! I'd pay 10 and many more ppl would too. Game popularity would rise and devoted community would keep their pockets full. But they chose to have a bunch of ppl who like the game so much that 50 Euro is nothing to them. Maybe they'll use that money to repair their site. Only ""Buy"" works properly."
,MVultra,2013-03-18T18:35Z,@minibos - Well said.
,whitehairdemon,2013-03-19T09:03Z,Agreed with minibos. It's out-house game security testing & free trial. 
,damislav,2013-03-19T13:37Z,please make a crackfix!
,euquero,2013-03-19T16:54Z,"I can't even play it... I enter the game, the intro appears, I skip it and the main screen of the game doesn't appear. I even let the intro go until the end and nothing.
What can I do?"
,jpweb72,2013-03-24T01:13Z,please make a good crack
,XxZnerKxX,2013-03-24T13:40Z,"This game doesnt have a crack that allows ppl to save the game!

This is targeted marketing guys,totally.
The game is most probably ""leaked"" at full will,and hopes for frustrated players to buy the full game..

No Use To DL before working crack is out !
U will only get pissed when you made some progress,and understands the saveoption is not working.

cheers"
,d0cput,2013-03-27T10:02Z,don't wanna being an assclown or something.. but the game has poor graphic compare the old one and it's sometimes flooding my memory to 2gb usage which crashing my seven64...
,edthatch,2013-03-28T06:14Z,"Got a ""monitoring Kidz"" spyware file from this, not  false positive either. That's a first from extremezone. Am I the only one?"
,noproxy,2013-03-30T03:19Z,"Actually, if it is improved ""rulers of the nations"" then it is a great game, very deep and enjoyble, but as people here saying it is with no crack so i'm not downloading it, but for those who like real time strategy game, this one is unique and very good one (if they take care of the bugs and improve some thing in RON)."
,Nicolas55,2013-03-30T09:25Z,"It would be a great game, if it was cracked. Sadly, it is now safe to assume that the Skidrow team has moved on, left the crack unfinished, fuelling the allegations that they made such a ""teaser-crack"" on purpose."
,CodieLM,2013-04-06T03:36Z,"I don't know if anybody has found this out, but the way to save and load your games is to run the main _start.exe as an admin! It worked for me. I hope it does for you!"
,DefeatedYMIR,2013-04-06T19:12Z,"@CodieLM - If that is the solution, I am going to smack myself in the face for not thinking of that. I guess I have to re-download and try it. I doubt it will work, but if it does I will write another comment."
,Chratos,2013-04-06T19:20Z,did not work for me. What operating system do you use?
,DefeatedYMIR,2013-04-06T21:04Z,"Yup, it doesn't work."
,jpweb72,2013-04-06T22:27Z,CodieLM i did try that several times and never worked i using win7 64 bits and you?
,Nicolas55,2013-04-07T11:17Z,"CodieLM: does not work for me either, you got my hopes up high"
,Vermon,2013-04-08T12:08Z,It doesn't work for me either. I think we've just got trolled.
,DefeatedYMIR,2013-04-11T17:00Z,Don't expect anyone to make a fix for the save issue. What a shame. If only the developers didn't charge an insane amount of money.
,noproxy,2013-04-12T09:24Z,"i'm just suprised how come no one provided a crack for this game?

why cracks now only skidrow cracks? and very shitty ones, barely works if it worked in the first palce."
,8899liava,2013-04-21T14:25Z,"Worked for me, it has how ever starting as a Trojan with Norton Insight scan although it was not when I first downloaded it 1 months ago. Have not been let down yet with extremezone but I would proceed with caution."
,fliter16,2013-04-25T01:59Z,"Norton says buddah.dll is gen.2 trojan

I tend to believe it since Norton will sometimes get a false positive on that particular trojan when it comes to a trainer, but this is a .dll we're talking about.

Since the consensus is that the game is full of bugs and the patch doesn't work, there's no way I'm even going to attempt this.

Shit game, fake/virused crack.  Admins please remove this for the good of all."
,iored94,2013-04-27T02:31Z,"Oh god filter.

You're fucking retarded"
,Strale84,2013-05-14T21:33Z,"its anyone knows how to seve the game,any fix?"
,killswitchzz,2013-05-26T07:49Z,U guys have obviously never downloaded from Extreme before. ITS A FALSE POSITIVE.
,noproxy,2013-05-29T18:52Z,"the crack doesn't work....you can save any thing...it is like a demo.

unfortunately no other cracked copy around...it seems no one wants to play this game."
,noproxy,2013-05-29T18:53Z,you can= you can't
