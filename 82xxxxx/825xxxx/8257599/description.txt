No need to install,
No need to put serials and cracks to get the full version, (already done it for you).
No unnecessary registry changes. 
No boring installation of tool-bars in your browser or other unwanted things.
You can even run this torrent from USB-Stick.
These are a few things that makes a '1-click run' version a, better version.

DVDINFOPro is a DVD information program written in Visual Studio V2010 C++ for Windows XPSP2, Vista, Windows 7 and later. It provides information and useful tools for DVD media. Both DVD-R/RW and DVD+R/RW types are supported. It follows in the tradition of DVDInfo, my first dvd application that was very successful. This new version is a result of listening to users criticisms, requests and suggestions, and applying this to the new version.

This program provides information & tools for:
 - Blu-ray and HD-DVD
 - DVD-R/RW
 - DVD+R/RW burners
 - DVD-R DL (Double Layer) burners
 - DVD+R DL (Double Layer) burners
 - DVD-ROM players.
