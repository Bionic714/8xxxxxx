Laurence Made Me Cry is the persona of Cardiff based; lo-fi folk/electronica songstress, artist and multi-instrumentalist Jo Whitby. With her debut EP being released back in 2011, Jo Whitby soon decided that she wanted to record an album and thus ΓÇÿThe Diary of MeΓÇÖ was born.

After raising the money to record the album by using the ever so popular method of crowd funding, Jo recorded ΓÇÿThe Diary of MeΓÇÖ in her bedroom in Cardiff as well as her parentsΓÇÖ house on the other side of Severn, over in Bristol. Whitby writes plays and sings on almost every track on the album bar a few in which she drafted in a handful of talented artists to collaborate with including Salwa Azar (vocals and lyrics: ΓÇÿPaper ChainsΓÇÖ), Ash Cooke (guitar, synths and voice: ΓÇÿBetween DestinationsΓÇÖ) and Paul Foster a.k.a Dementio13 .
