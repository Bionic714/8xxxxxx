THIS IS NOT Sonicstage
THIS IS Sonicstage Mastering Studio with Audio Filter on it 
Big difference :)

Glad it worked for you :) I am sure that sound quality will be amazing in your minidisc gear :) Enjoy the soul of Music :)
& yes minidisc is too expensive, I have 2 but in my country it have no value & will never sell them although they give me 1000$ for one :) Minidisc is a unique experience.
all the best :)"

Hello Jacob, Glad that you are musican & know the fact that Minidisc sound quality is far superior & versatile ! 
I don't have decks only portable minidiscs : MZ-N707 & MZ-E900 & my ears never heard better sound than from them.
For 1200$ I think you are lucky owner of an ES Minidisc deck : JA555ES maybe  :)
Really like that I was in some help to someone :) & writing in french I think you know that I speak french maybe :D
Anyway, thank you for your feedbacks, they surely will be helpful to many people.
De rien mon ami, c'est un grand plaisir & all the best :)"
