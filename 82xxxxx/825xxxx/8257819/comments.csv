Tom 'Primeur' Beaujoulais (TPB) (just a nice charade)"
,beaujoulais,2013-03-16T13:52Z,"..coming back to the expression 'charade':
'Big man - pig man' comes out of Pink Floyd's disc 'Animals'. Are there vids available? Same with early Genesis up to 'The lamb lies down on Broadway'? I deeply love this music. Tom"
