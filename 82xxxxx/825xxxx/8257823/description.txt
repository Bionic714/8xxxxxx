Why This Book Is for You
I talk to so many people ΓÇö audience members after I play a concert, friends,
colleagues, people who see me carrying my violin case on the subway ΓÇö who
all tell me the same thing: ΓÇ£I wish I knew how to play the violin.ΓÇ¥ Violin For
Dummies is for all of you (and for all the people I donΓÇÖt know personally, but
who I know are out there) who have the same desire.
Even if youΓÇÖve never picked up a violin, let alone tried to play one, this book
tells you what you need to know to make some music. I take you from the
first moment you look at your instrument right on through the stages of an
exciting journey to playing the violin. And the journey is fun ΓÇö I guarantee it.
No matter how skilled you are with the violin (or even if you have no skills
yet), this book has something for you. If youΓÇÖre new to the instrument and
want to play, you can follow the chapters in order. If you have some violin
background and are looking for some tips on sharpening your skills, you can
zone in on areas where you want some advice and skip over the places where
you know how to manage.
If youΓÇÖre a more advanced musician, or even a music teacher, you may want
to use Violin For Dummies for reference. I give you extra teaching ideas, and
you can find some new tricks and approaches to playing that really work
