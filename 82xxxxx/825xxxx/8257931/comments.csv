,j19m84,2013-03-19T16:47Z,Hi. Are there any instructions on installing the update? I have the late 2011 MacBook Pro and when tried to install the update the entire partition got corrupted and all of the data was lost. I tried running repairing disk and recovery but nothing worked. What did I do wrong? How do i fix it?

,DevinBedari,2013-04-25T06:15Z,"Okay, for the first-timers:

1. This is OSX Mountain Lion 10.8.3 that has been downloaded directly from the app store. FatFreddy733 says that nothing has been modified.

2.If you want to make your own ""Hackintosh"" from this file and you have access to a MacBook or iMac, then follow this guide

http://www.tonymacx86.com/61-unibeast-install-os-x-mountain-lion-any-supported-intel-based-pc.html

3. If you do not own/have a Mac, then you're screwed. This is the wrong torrent for you. What you're looking for is the Snow Leopard retail dvd. Without it, you cant create a ""Hackintosh"". Once you install Snow Leopard, then come back and download this."

,mac-koy,2013-05-22T20:03Z,I am currently running mountain lion 10.7.5 on my late 2008 aluminum unibody macbook. Can I install this os x 10.8.3 directly without installing mountain lion 10.8?
,freeboy3,2013-06-02T01:32Z,"Hi guys,

Can I upgrade my 10.7.5 lion with this?
Just mount, open ""Install OSX Mountain Lion.app"" and press Next,Next,Next... ?

There will be no problem atfer install, right? No restrictions? No issues?

Thank you!"
