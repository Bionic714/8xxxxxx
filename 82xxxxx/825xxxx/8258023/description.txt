Notes: PC played a strong set from
10:00 to 11:00 before the EAS who came
on at 11:30 and played almost 2 hours.
Show was well attended though not sold
out.

Recorded with mics in back of SBD with
clamp on mic stand at ~7.5 feet.
Received a SBD feed and ran 6 channels
into Tascam DR-680 with Big Box/V3 preamps.
The sound at the venue was good. Sounding
of the recording is good. Crowd noise can
be heard though is minimal.

Thanks to PC/EAS Bands members to make
this all happen. Also, thanks to
Cervantes crew for all their assistent
and mix.
