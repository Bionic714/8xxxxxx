,Relm50,2013-03-16T17:28Z,YESS! I LOVE YOU DUDE! Just what i needed. can you make an updated version every month or so? they add 2 songs a week so i want to stay updated :)
,Relm50,2013-03-16T23:22Z,"Oh btw the Genres are tagged wrong. 11 out of 12 albums are tagged as dubstep but they're not, they are trance, house, electro, drum and bass, drumstep ect. check Monstercat's Youtube channel to see the proper tags. try to fix this in your next upload. thanks!"
,Flinjager,2013-03-18T00:24Z,Does this include the album mixes? With a file this big I don't want to download it and it not have them. 
,IPASuperior,2013-03-19T00:42Z,"Lol. Sorry @Relm50. :P

You can just re-tag them.

And I can try. I prefer to just wait for a new album and the upload it. XD

And yes @Flinjager.

It includes all the mixes from 005 to 012 (minus the albums like 009 I think that didn't have mixes)"

,camason24,2013-04-13T03:38Z,"So many amazing songs :D
Thanks!"
,DMDesigns,2013-04-23T02:00Z,THANKS! :O There are no covers :P Also 009 the tracks don't sound 320 at all :L They sound muffled and bad. Gonna have to find it somewhere else. Thanks for the rest though! :D 
,IPASuperior,2013-04-24T05:54Z,"Ok. Just realized that 009 isn't 320kb/s... :'( Stupid.

So, I'll just link you to one. :3

Sorry again. "
,Mookbutt,2013-04-30T06:59Z,"I actually just came on here to mention that the 009 album is DEFINITELY NOT 320, and I saw the last two comments.

I did a spectrum analysis on the track 'Nightfall' by ROGUE, and the WAV from Beatport, converted via LAME to 320.

I don't even want to know what the source of this entire album was, but it couldn't even be a 128kbps CBR encode, because the cutoff rate for that format isn't even at 10kHz.

Anyway, thanks for your upload. I've been anxious as gtfo to get many of these tracks until I can afford to buy each album.

tl;dr, 009 is a transcode, sounds like balls, grab the copy IPA linked, monstercat blows my tits off, buy their shit, best edm netlabel at the moment etc etc etc"
