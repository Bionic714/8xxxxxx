Hard Truck 2: The scene is laid out in modern times. The place is somewhere close to a massive mountain. A network of roads, connecting small towns covers the region. Each town has a depot that puts in orders for goods, as they are consumed by the townsfolk. The cargo is delivered by trucks. The player is one of the long-haul truckers who runs about the region looking for a gainful order and peddles wares from town to town. The profit depends on the shortage of the merchandize delivered, so the quickest player makes the most.

As the game goes on, a successful driver can upgrade the truck or change it to another one, and then is able to buy another (and another, etc.) truck and even hire a bankrupted rival. The strategic goal of the game is to monopolize the delivery business.

This is the Original United States Release of Hard Truck II, not King of the Road.
