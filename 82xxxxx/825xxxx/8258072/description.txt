Chrome Sparks makes great music, check out his bandcamp page:

This comes with all of his releases except for two singles from one of his EPs (no use in having the songs twice).

All of it is in 14100 kbps ALAC (Apple Lossless Audio Codec), downloaded straight from his bandcamp page. The ID3 tags were fixed to look good in iTunes.

Releases:
[2010] Wait for Heartbeats (Single)
[2011] Remixes
[2011] My &lt;3
[2011] Still Sleeping (Single)
[2013] Sparks

His music is distributed by bandcamp for a "pay what you like" fee, so you can freely download the songs if you choose, or if you can pay for it if you want to support him.

Happy listening
