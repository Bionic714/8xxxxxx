,IndigoAK,2013-03-15T06:37Z,Have you seen the website for this game?  It's not really surprising that it's broken.  There were games in the 80s with higher UI budgets.  Whoever designed their interface should lay off the Adobe Fireworks.
,jpweb72,2013-03-16T00:40Z,please post a crack whit working saves we cant load the save games

,minibos,2013-03-18T12:28Z,"Don’t you get it it’s called paid marketing.

The developer of this game is small obscure company, they already made two previous games and charged people a lot of money for it.

But now the got a bit smarter ( Sega/sports interactive/fm 2013) smarter, so the approach a individual within the SKIDROW scene, and pay him some money to crack the game, but nuke it in some way (e.g. the save game can’t load) so the people can try the game but can’t actually play it.

What will happen is that a lot more people will actually get to try the product which is ridiculously expensive 49.00 Euros, some of the people will get hooked up, and will actually buy the game, pay a lot of money for a faulty product.

This is nothing more than paid marketing, same thing happened with Football Manager 2013"
,jpweb72,2013-03-18T21:13Z,So that means that some one in skidrow is a saleout or traitor and should be banished from the group
,damislav,2013-03-19T13:40Z,minibos is stupid troll this game is more than just a game its complex simulation
