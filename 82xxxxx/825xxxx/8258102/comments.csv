,tt1234,2013-03-24T23:10Z,"Hi Judas, I read your analysis of coding approaches over on your Skyfall torrent.  Can you answer a question for me please.  With VCL playing on the computer I often have to turn the volume up to 150% or even 200% to get good sound quality on the TV via HDMI.  What is VCL doing when it turns the volume above 100%?

I like to copy the file to a USB drive and play it through the LG DVD player, which can play all sorts of computer files.  My problem is that many files, which are good on VLC, have terrible sound quality.  I can turn the volume on the TV way up but it doesn't sound right.  Please can you tell me what's going on and what I can do about it."
[V],dhjudasx,2013-03-26T01:01Z,"really it's hard to say...

vlc's above 100% just adds boosted gain/volume to the source audio... which can usually start introducing clipping and distortion depending on the source material.

If you are having to do that, then the device playing back the audio was never designed with full audio experience in mind and basically needs a super strong audio signal to work with.... which is generally a bad idea lol. TV speakers are outright terrible anyways... they have been designing tvs for the last say 8 years with no serious thought of people actually using them strickly by themselves, they've been pushing for people to buy dedicated stereo/surround sound systems of some sort to do the audio work and just disable the tv speakers altogether.


As for your lg player.... frankly I've had nothing but horrible experience with LG products specially their smart tvs and there totally unpredictable playback results. I have found they tend to use poor low end components and processing power to handle high compression codecs. Some of my rips for example even for most of the people that ""experience glitching or corruptions"" almost all of them are using an LG tv.

I'm betting it's just the product.... some Samsung bluray players are really picky on what it'll play too... but if I can.. it does fine....

The BEST way to play my rips is via usb on smart tvs for stereo audio only..

if you want 5.1... the best is via through a ps3 or computer or compliant device that uses a physical HDMI connection to the amp/receiver."

Did not reach the end of Skyfall... don't know why the critics raved about it, it was just James Bond chasing round as usual."
