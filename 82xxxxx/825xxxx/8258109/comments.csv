 - Can I install DLCs with this?

 And thanks :) "
,Kelaro,2013-03-17T10:33Z,I can't find update 1.03 anywhere on it's own - any chance the uploader could release 1.03? I have just downloaded 1.04 but can't use it until I get 1.03 :-(
,Liman_Bot,2013-03-18T23:27Z,"To make it work with the BlackBox release u'd need to know alot about registry entries and stuff,and it'd be very hard to doo cause you could brake the game at any point,better get the SR version patch it up to 1.04 and install the dlc,and then finally enjoy :D"
