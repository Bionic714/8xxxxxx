,SARmedic,2013-03-15T07:41Z,"TheCrowdGoesWild as I do just that.

From the sample, and for a CAM:

V=7.5
A=7

Video was a bit dark and a tad blurry, but very watchable.

Audio was quite clear but had the cursed echo that you get with cam copies, but again, very watchable.

It may be a bit lower in the ratings department for some of you but I understand that its a cam copy and rated it as such.  "
