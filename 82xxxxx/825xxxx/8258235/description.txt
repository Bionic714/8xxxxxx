A group of sadistic outlaw bikers rumble into Las Vegas for kicks and to raise hell and chaos. But they soon get more then they bargained for when they run up against a neo-Nazi group, as well as casino Mafia wise-guys, and a wannabe vampire.

A biker exploitation movie that doesn't have that many bikers in it at all.
That's exploitation.
