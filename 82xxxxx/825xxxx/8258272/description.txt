Australian documentry set in a Sydney Hospital Emergency Room.

As promised over 12 monhs ago, here is season 2.

The Australian government is currently rolling out the fibre optic National Broadbond Network. I got this connected yesterday, so my uploads for you should be heaps faster.

However I now have a monthly usage limit and will not be able to seed for as long as previously.

So please seed.
