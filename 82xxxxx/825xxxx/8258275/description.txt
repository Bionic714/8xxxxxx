CD 4 of the 6-CD set 'Listen'. Ripped into Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC) format from the original CD using dBpoweramp.

Some samples (excerpts) of tracks from this disc set: http://www.allmusic.com/album/listen-7th-edition-6-cd-mw0002417053

VLC media player and many others play FLAC format by default. 

Installing the free K-Lite Codec Pack (Basic) will allow you to play FLAC files in Windows Media Player, if you aren't already able to: http://codecguide.com/download_kl.htm 

Songbird (http://getsongbird.com/desktop/) is a pretty good free program for organizing and playing your FLAC music library.
