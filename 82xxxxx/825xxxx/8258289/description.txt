Biografi
AOC is a band with focus on creating a cohesive mix of music that has both the crushing, heavy and hardhitting elements of thrash metal as well as the melodic aspects of various other genres.

AOC was founded in the summer of 2012 from the remnants of Croan by guitarists Allan Frandsen and Henrik Mortensen and drummer Thomas Bo Andreasen. After a couple of months Henrik Weide joined on vocals and Ronni Bech on bass.

AOC is in it for the long haul, we love what we do, and you can expect a lot more coming from us in the future!
