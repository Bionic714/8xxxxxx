Commercials and radio announcer removed using Sound Forge 6.0.
NOTE: The audio sound in this recording has "not" been altered. Just the commercials
and announcer removed. The last segment which included 2 songs by Ugly Kid Joe
is not included. This has never been officially released!

Most Ozzy collectors probably have more than one version of this concert from previous bootlegs.
Excellent recording which aired back in Nov/Dec 1992.
Enjoy!!
