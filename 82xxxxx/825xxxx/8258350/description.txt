ADDITIONAL NOTES

This has only been tested on own Assassins.Creed.III-SKIDROW release
as RELOADEDΓÇÖs release is nothing more than a dupe!

We decided to implent and emulate the latest version of the Ubisofts
orbit launcher, to enable every offline function, that their orbit
service gives users who actually owns the original. Simply to offer
emulated functions that noone else in the scene currently offers

YouΓÇÖll notice it when you see it!
