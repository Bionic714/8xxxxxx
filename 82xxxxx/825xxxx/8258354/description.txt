ΓÇ£It is a great example of the well-directed and acted independent slasher movie.ΓÇ¥ ΓÇô Buried Dot Com

Flicker opened in limited release in theaters across the US over Labor Day Weekend in 2009. Many of the people who saw it drove from cities and states that had not booked it. Thanks in large part to its trailer being available on Apple's site and iTunes, untold thousands of people were made aware of the movie and its soundtrack.

ΓÇ£I especially appreciated that filmmaker Aaron Hendren did something different with the whole 'survival horror' subgenre and didn't give us just another Texas Chainsaw Massacre retread. Flicker comes highly recommended!ΓÇ¥ ΓÇô Fatally Yours

Flicker is now available on DVD, and the soundtrack is available where you buy music.

ΓÇ£Katy Houska is perfect as Pretty, who starts off as a normal girl but after her harrowing ordeal starts to fray at the edges until she triumphantly is reborn as an ass-kicking machine.ΓÇ¥ ΓÇô Fatally Yours

Flicker is the feature film about a weekend camping trip to a small mountain town. Pretty and Jack wake up in the middle of the night to discover that their friends are missing. A bloody tent, homicidal cops, creepy locals and brutal elements create the world that Pretty must escape.

ΓÇ£Pretty goes through a transformation into an ass-kicker in one of the more daring performances I have seen by an actress in an indie flick.ΓÇ¥ - The Video Graveyard
