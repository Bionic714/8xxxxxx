More sex and death from iconoclast Kim Ki-young in this bizarre and beautifully shot ΓÇÿScope drama. It takes the form of an investigation by a resort promoter and a newspaper editor of the strange death of an Iodo islander turned ecology reporter, who disappears overboard on a trip back to the island. Unfolding in flashback, it relates in mock mythological terms the fate of the island, populated almost entirely by Amazon-like female deep sea divers and their shamans. Atmospheric, ghostly and oneiric, itΓÇÖs a Freudian mind-boggler, filled with male sexual anxiety, culminating in one of the most shocking copulatory denouements in the movies.
