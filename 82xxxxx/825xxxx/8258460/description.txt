After arriving in small town, drifter Tai Ming (Dragon Lee) begins asking around for work. With convoys being robbed frequently, Tai easily gets a job providing security for a transport company. But when his shipment is stolen, he must recover the lost goods. Packed with plenty of intense fights as well as comedic moments, this South Korean actioner pays tribute to the incredible work of martial arts legend Bruce Lee.
