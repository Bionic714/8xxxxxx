House of Krazees was an American hip hop group from Detroit, Michigan. The group was composed of the rappers R.O.C. (Raps On Contact), Paul Methric (Hektic) and Jamie Spaniolo (Mr.Bones). House of Krazees performed a style of hardcore hip hop known as horrorcore and was active from 1993 until 1997. Methric and Spaniolo later formed Twiztid.


This torrent has every HOK album completely remastered (except Outbreed and Collectors Edition but both albums are included in the torrent) along with a "Krazee Collection" which features remastered songs that I was working on to make a "Cryptic Collection: HOK Edition" that never saw the light of day).

This is the best quality if these albums you will find until Twiztid and ROC release a HOK boxset in the future.

Albums Include:
Homebound
Home Sweet Home
Head Trauma
Season Of The Pumpkin
Outbreed
Collectors Edition
Krazee Collection
And I threw in the Mr.Bones solo album "Sacrifice" remastered as well.

This torrent is great for fans of Twiztid and/or horrorcore rap.

Enjoy the music.
