Eddie 'The Fat Man' Jackson and Courtney 'The Field Marshal' Brown were labeled 'Kingpins' in an era where their names reigned supreme in Detroit. Accumulating more than a million dollars a month in heroin sales, these childhood friends lived lavish, privileged lifestyles, that today's nickel and dime street hustlers could only dream of. Surrounded by some of the greatest entertainers of that time including, The Temptations, Red Foxx, Richard Pryor, The OJays and writer Donald Goines to name but a handful, their customer base was a virtual who's who. After countless Federal and local investigations, paid informants, accusations of police corruption and Grand Jury appearances, The Fat Man and The Field Marshal were finally sentenced to double-digit prison terms. Amazingly when the men were released; their spirits weren't broken. Detroit had made them 'Kings of the Heroin Game' and not even steel bars could strip them of that well deserved title! The pair were- and still are legendary! This is their story... one that Federal Officials don't want you to know about!
