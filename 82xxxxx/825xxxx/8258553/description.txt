From the exercise physiologist of Tyler Perry and Mario Lopez comes PrayFit, a whole person fitness system designed to strengthen body and deepen faith. At its core, PrayFit is about effort: giving your best in two areas that are vital to well-beingΓÇöfaith and fitness. The underlying approach is simple: Make a daily appointment to spend quality time with the Lord and to exercise. 
 This 28-day plan guides readers of any fitness level to begin a workout routine that can be done at home with little to no equipment, to make small but effective changes in their diet and to grow in biblical knowledge and spiritual strength. As they follow the specially designed meal plans and workouts, readers will see the physical results of their efforts almost immediatelyΓÇöand as they reflect on the daily devotional reading (contributions from Pastor Jimmy Page, VP of Field Ministry and National Director of Wellness for the Fellowship of Christian Athletes) and Scripture verses, they will begin to understand the eternal dimension of giving their best. Living GodΓÇÖs promised abundant life isnΓÇÖt only about faith . . . though thatΓÇÖs where it starts. PrayFit is the best way to claim that promise both inside and out.
