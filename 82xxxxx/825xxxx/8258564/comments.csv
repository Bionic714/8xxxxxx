,speghead,2013-03-15T03:20Z,Just spreading the word on this method to play HOTS offline campaign. 
,CipherRo,2013-03-15T03:43Z,"Thanks, I was thinking about waiting for a scene release but your help in easing the process made me want to try this method. Congratulation, UP"
,rimo94,2013-03-15T04:17Z,"well.. my computer is xp
keygen always crash... "
,rimo94,2013-03-15T04:19Z,"There's a problem in my computer win xp
keygen error occurs... have no idea to solve it"
,yohoyoho23,2013-03-15T06:15Z,"Does this include the save? Luckily I got it last night when it was up but it seems to have been taken down now.

Anyway, putting in my ""thumbs up"" that this works. I used the linked site myself earlier and was just playing campaign up until now. Best part is Blizzard gives us almost everything you need just for having WoT lol. Youll need the crack if you dont own WoT AND make sure you save before exiting."
,speghead,2013-03-15T07:46Z,This is just the downgrade files.  Everything else needed is at the link.  
,jos3_riv3ra,2013-03-15T08:42Z,is this for EN-GB or EN-US? Thanks.
,speghead,2013-03-15T09:07Z,This is for en-us. you can find en-gb at the link
,Atlasy,2013-03-15T12:15Z,"It doesn't seem to work for me. I did every order. Even  tried in the registry but it doesn't work. I have WIN 7 64 bit.
I have bought WoL when it was released. I inserted the save file, blocked my internet, downgraded my version, used the keygen. But when I start the game, and cancel it. It says that for online play I need 100% of files or something like that. And it won't let me in the game 'till I fix my internet and connect to patch servers. Fuck that! It'd essetinally be what I have done backwards. Could someone help me out?"
,ironymon,2013-03-15T12:34Z,"ahh, i'm torn between waiting for a scene release or trying out this crap on my legit wol copy... I'll wait."
,speghead,2013-03-15T16:37Z,"if you have legit WoL then ya don't need the keygen. Using it might change your license.  Also, make sure you fully delete the Updates and Base24944 folders before you copy over the new ones.  You should not be overwriting any files."
,XTrojan,2013-03-15T19:15Z,"Is WoL needed for this, or is there any guide anywhere how to install this?"
,ironymon,2013-03-15T19:24Z,What if my sc2 game region is global not eu us or en? I'm based in eu though...
,Serenifly,2013-03-15T20:01Z,"@XTrojan
*sigh* How about read everything

Check the link above. You either need a working copy of WoL or the WoL starter edition. Patch 2.0.5 then includes HoTS. But you need to do everything explained at that link (though the cache file copying is only needed for skirmish plays, not the campaign)"
,rabint37,2013-03-15T20:30Z,Tried this with my existing WoL and it works perfectly. Only problem is the save file that was posted before works until the end of mission one and then the game just stalls
,genoro,2013-03-15T22:02Z,"rabint37,

just try to select RESTART MISSION from the game menu after you had started saved file. After that, you will complete first mission and go ahead."
,Serenifly,2013-03-15T22:40Z,"@rabint37
That's a bug in the regular game. Nothing to do with this.

Starcraft makes an autosave after every mission. Just go to the autosave screen in the load menu and select the last one. It will load fine and continue with the next mission"
,dirtnasty74,2013-03-15T23:38Z,"Keygen crashes, updated drivers and I downloaded net 3.5 sp1"
,dirtnasty74,2013-03-15T23:57Z,"@lovter
That is not legit. "
,evilqwerty1,2013-03-16T00:58Z,"Has anyone actually got this to work?  I have a true copy of WoL; I did a fresh install and let Blizzard update to full 2.0.6; I followed everything correctly and rolled back to 2.0.5 (which shows up on the offline login screen) and copied and pasted the save file. 

However, the campaign load screen is different from the one shown on the link speghead provided.  I have to choose between WoL or HoS campaign first.  If I click on WoL, I can play the campaign since I have a true copy, but if I click on HoS, I can only watch the movie.

It's a little hard to explain but basically, I can't see an option to play the HoS campaign after I copied and pasted the HoS save file.  Anyone encountered this?"
,evilqwerty1,2013-03-16T01:02Z,Or has anyone actually got this to work other than rabin37?
,BrannD,2013-03-16T01:02Z,Omfg... It's working. I thought it is another fake crap. I mean that method with downgrade. 
,Serenifly,2013-03-16T01:43Z,"@evilqwerty1
Load the HoTS save from the WoL menu. The HoTS menu doesn't work, true. But you can still load the save from the other screen."
,evilqwerty1,2013-03-16T02:16Z,"Thanks Serenifly, yes it works!  

One thing I really want to emphasize is have SCII blocked from internet altogether.  I accidentally started SCII after rolling back to 2.0.5 for 2 seconds and I have to download the full update from Blizzard again before I can roll back to 2.0.5 and play... took a whole night.

Great torrent!  It only sounds complicated but it's actually quite simple!"
,Alphario,2013-03-16T02:53Z,"I did everything that it says to do, but when I try to start the game the ""play"" button is greyed out and won't work unless I'm online"
,pancakepizza,2013-03-16T03:33Z,"I did pretty much every single step with a real, bought WoL license, even removed it from my registry and replaced it with a generated one, and whenever I open SC2 it just trys to patch it, even with it blocked. What do I do?"
,lucarido,2013-03-16T03:50Z,SC2 won't let me start the game with updating? If If I turn off my internet completely it won't let me start the game?dx
,FurryCreatures,2013-03-16T03:54Z,I just used all of the files and instructions from the link that was provided. And it worked. I have a legit copy of WoL though. 
,paulboscu,2013-03-16T03:58Z,"@ FurryCreatures

That's just the thing,this only work with a legit copy of WoL.The ppl who don't have one will just have to wait for a proper scene release."
,Serenifly,2013-03-16T04:16Z,This also works with a cracked copy of WoL. You just have to go through some additional steps like running the key generator.
,mrgum,2013-03-16T04:53Z,WORKS!!!
,illidan_hunter,2013-03-16T12:40Z,Does it also run the full Wings of Liberty campaign?
,paulboscu,2013-03-16T13:03Z,"Does anyone have any idea when a proper scene release of this game might came out?I mean it's been 4 days since the game got released and no group has manged to crack it yet,why is this so hard to crack?"
,QuiZr,2013-03-16T13:44Z,Any chances to plPL downgrade? :)
,agentmi6,2013-03-16T14:50Z,"@paulboscu

Yeah its long comparing to Wings of Liberty release, WOL was released the day after."
,BrannD,2013-03-16T14:58Z,"@QuizR Będzie ciężko. Zrób to w enGB, wiesz fabuła, jednostki itp nie mają strasznie skomplikowanego nazewnictwa. Też wolał bym grać z polskimi napisami ale pozostaje się cieszyć tym co mamy. A powiadam Ci... Warto. :)

Pozdrawiam!"
,evilqwerty1,2013-03-16T16:00Z,"One of the reasons why some of you can't play offline is because you have to sign in online once before they actually let you play offline.  So before you crack it, sign in once like the instruction says, then crack it and disable internet."
,zeca.pt,2013-03-16T16:12Z,thanks! +100
,alenka.k,2013-03-16T16:58Z,"There's need a power of -=Razor1911=- to crack HotS, and a patch will not be created this month I think. Therefore use this Downgrade+old keygen."
,garyoak9,2013-03-16T20:02Z,"evilqwerty1, I did log into battle.net but then it still failed to work because it came up with another error saying failed to extract data from archive. "
,gubaguy,2013-03-16T23:51Z,"Why cant this just be a simple ""download, install, play""  i dont want ot jump through 50 fricken hoops to play the game...

Also, this doesnt work for me anyways, when i try to install the FTP version of SC2, it demands a key to install, so... yeah, thanks for making it so i cant use it."
,Arbiter89,2013-03-17T08:39Z,"@gubaguy

If you want a simple installation then buy the game you ungrateful little shit. These guys work their ass off trying to find a way for us to play without paying any money, and you feel entitled to an easier installation? Fuck you and everyone like you."
,jos3_riv3ra,2013-03-17T12:10Z,Done with the campaign. Thanks :D
,emdeec,2013-03-17T16:41Z,"LOL.. 2 things I discovered..

If the game keeps wanting to just update the launcher and won't start from the desktop shortcut.. use SC@SWITCHER.EXE which is located in the Support dir instead. It will still try and connect to a server (block this exe AS WELL!), but if you cancel it right away it will start. If you don't and let it run a while it won't start, but will the next time.. usually.

Also.. if your ""connect"" button is greyed out ingame (before you can actually play), remember.. it wants the e-mail address you registered on battle.net with.. not the nym you chose. Soon as you type that in correctly.. the button will activate."
,led2,2013-03-17T17:15Z,"@evilqwert1

Same thing happen to me, i didn't block the connection and it gave me problems.  but instead of redoing everything, i patched it back to 2.06.  Luckily a made backups of the update and base folder so i put those back in and let it update itself and it was almost like a fresh 2.06.  from then i just downgraded it back just as the instructions on the site and it works again.

though i do get an error sometimes when i run the game.. i just try loading the game up again and it works.

the game is amazing, i love level where u start as a larva haha"
,icarus1314,2013-03-17T17:30Z,"in custom game, the new units from HOTS is not avaliable ...."
,emdeec,2013-03-17T18:33Z,"Can some of you (who have it up and running) check something out?

Go to options>gameplay>expansion level and open the drop down box and see if under Wings of Liberty, it says ""(Starter Edition) HotS""; which would lead one to believe that the 2.05 patch DOESN'T have the whole expansion in it.

Thanks."
,paulboscu,2013-03-18T03:08Z,Holy shit this works!Thanks to whoever uploaded this fix.
,rite_jazz,2013-03-18T09:39Z,"emdeec,

hv u tried to use win explorer to check
starcraft II install folder / 

do u see *Swarm* there ? 

just to summarize how to get the HOTS in my PC:

1) install WOL
2) Download & install the StarCraft-II-Setup-enGB
3) above, I believe will download the HOTS to your PC, let it finish 100%
4) If you have the above, continue the steps in the link given, i.e. the  sc2.nibbits.com/.....

You probably shouldn't try this with any battle.net account that has legit games on it.Create a separate account to try this just to be on the safe side."

,paulboscu,2013-03-19T14:50Z,"@ UglyDucklingxyz 

You have to download WoL Starter Edition from the blizz servers,let it update to 2.0.6.,the use this torrent to downgrade to 2.0.5. Just click the link in the description of this torrent,that should tell you everything you need to know.

@ Pandryl
This worked for me and a lot of other people so it should work for you,however it is not 100%."

Instructions are simpler than it looks:
- download starter edition from Blizzard
- download keygen, HOTS saved file, and 2.0.5 rollback file
- login in to SC2 through game officially with internet connection once downloaded, create a player name
- log off, turn off internet.
- run keygen
- copy rollback files
- copy HOTS saved game file

VOILA! Done! Now can play offline!

,UglyDucklingxyz,2013-03-25T00:17Z,"Doesn't work for me.

I downloaded the starter edition, the game said it was up to date, i ran it, logged in with my battle.net user name and then quit. Then I turned off my internet connection and started the game again, but I get stuck on a window that says ""Updating Blizzard Launcher"", which fills to over 50% but then doesn't do anything. Looks like it is trying to establish a connection. If I close this window the game doesn't start. 

Not sure if I did something wrong or if Blizzard got wind of this method and changed something. Anyone else having this problem?"
