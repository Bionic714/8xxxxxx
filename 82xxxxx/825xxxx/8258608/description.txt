A mentally disturbed professor checks himself into a hospital where he meets other patients suffering from schizophrenia as a result of extramarital affairs. He comes across a story about a man who was killed by his mistress ΓÇô a prostitute named Myung-ja. Apparently Myung-ja was raped by a married man who incidentally suffered from impotence, but the assault turns into a prolonged love affair. After much contemplation, Myung-ja asks her man to be his concubine. Surprisingly, the manΓÇÖs wife agrees to it and even arranges Myung-ja to live with them in exchange for curing her husbandΓÇÖs potency. But what no one has yet to see is that something horrific is heading their way. ΓÇöYesAsia
