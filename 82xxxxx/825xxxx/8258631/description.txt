Justin Timberlake - The 20/20 Collection
The Tootie Edits


Includes:
Suit & Tie (3:08)
Don't Hold the Wall (4:03)


Justin Timberlake, along with fellow producer Timbaland, can come up with some unique, intriguing and infectious beats. But Timberlake likes to make long songs which oftentimes include alternate portions of the song that are reprises, if you will, of the song in question. These portions can be seen as drawn-out, unnecessary and uninteresting. Like them or not, they abruptly change the feel and mood of the track, and, in my opinion, it's for the worse.

These edits address these issues. These could be considered more "party-friendly" versions of their respective tracks on the album.

Note: The "Suit & Tie" edit eliminates Jay-Z's performance entirely.
