I've waited a long time to see this on Blu-ray; I'm glad that you were able to snag the Italian BR.

And, NO...  I'm not gonna say anything about the DTS...  : )

Thanks, excellent choice!

Beautiful job!  Played nicely on my OPPO; looked and sounded excellent!

I've been waiting for this one for a LONG time.

Thanks mate!!!"
