,bloominoctober,2013-03-15T14:06Z,"Thanks! As scienceho said, seems to be quite a few missing/late comics this week.  I still haven't found Threshold 003 (DC New 52), and I've been looking for Spawn 228 since it released last month, and not Spawn 229 is out (and nowhere to be found either).

Thanks for all the uploads and to all the uploaders anyhow!"
,bloominoctober,2013-03-15T14:23Z,"And, of course, now that I posted about the titles I was missing, I find Spawn 228 (at magazine3k.com). Figures ..."
,Nikoli1129,2013-03-15T15:48Z,"Thank you for your work.
While we're all talking about books that we're missing, does anyone know where I can find ""Atomic Robo: Flying She-Devils of the Pacific"" #5?"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-15T15:50Z,"you're both welcome. 

i didn't perceive any uploaders missing, 'cause all the usual suspects were posting stuff wednesday and yesterday. and it's true that a few scans seem to take a day or two, but really... it's pretty awesome that we get so many comics before the l.a. and seattle shops even open!  ;-)"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-15T15:54Z,"Nikoli 1129, this is the 3rd damn time i've posted this link under one of your comments. https://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7901801/Atomic_Robo_-_The_Flying_She-Devils_of_the_Pacific__5_%5BRed5%5D
sorry to be rude, but i don't know why the hell you don't type atomic robo in the search box... the issue's been available on here for months."
[T],MrDowntown,2013-03-25T13:45Z,"@bloominoctober and others,

Please DO NOT post links or mention ANY source sites as that is an excellent way to get them SHUT DOWN"
