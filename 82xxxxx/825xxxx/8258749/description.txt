Disklens is a Spotlight alternative that lets you quickly and easily find anything on your Mac.

WHAT'S NEW:

Bugfixes:

* Typing an innocent apostrophe (e.g., jeanne d') into the search field 
   would immediately blow up Disklens. Many thanks to Denis for 
   reporting the issue.

Improvements:

* Quotation marks around search terms are now accounted for, i.e., a  
  search for "hello world" will look for that exact phrase.

System Requirements:

Intel Mac, OS X.7.4 or greater

Processor type(s) & speed: 64 Bit CPU
