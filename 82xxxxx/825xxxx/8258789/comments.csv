Buddha be praised!!! 
Lets hope those are the actual packs (and nothing is missing) from Suite's Full Version. 

Eternally grateful. If you ever need anything, send me a msg. I'll help if i can. 

Cheers"
,Ikkepop,2013-04-08T23:46Z,what's the point of adding Max if it's a 30day trial ... that can be downloaded of the site : / 
,Ethnod,2013-04-09T07:28Z,For what OS is this? Will these work on Mac?
,ocktam,2013-04-11T00:25Z,"It´s only trial version, no cr4ck inside :("
,skylyne,2013-04-18T02:55Z,"Ikkepop:

The point is for those who wish to have it for longer than the trial period. Some people may not need it for longer than that, but some want to keep it for longer."
,HeywoodFloyd,2013-04-18T17:53Z,"ironearth, you are the man !

i confirm they install perfectly & without any limitation !

Thanks , that's what i was looking for !
If you know how to catch other packs like these, let us know !"
,RayDick,2013-05-19T20:27Z,So does this authorize max for live or is it still the 30 day trial?
,Moltres_Rider,2013-06-03T22:17Z,THE MAX IS ONLY A 30 DAY TRIAL!!!
