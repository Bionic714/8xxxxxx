Very Best of Cole Porter album by Cole Porter was released Jun 15, 2004 on the Hip-O label. Undoubtedly released to coincide with the soundtrack to the 2004 Cole Porter biopic DE-LOVELY, this songbook collection features some of the mid-20th century's finest song stylists sinking their teeth into the urbane composer's meaty catalog. Very Best of Cole Porter songs In contrast, the DE-LOVELY soundtrack offers contemporary popsters tackling Porter's material-- whether you want to hear "True Love" sung by Ashley Judd or Dean Martin is between you and your clergyman (or therapist). Very Best of Cole Porter album Regardless, it's impossible to argue with Louis Armstrong's deliciously lascivious take on "Let's Do It," Helen Merrill's breathy, sultry interpretation of "Anything Goes," or Eartha Kitt's downright decadent delivery of "Let's Misbehave." More prurient topics aside, to hear Fred Astaire's elegant, perfectly phrased version of "Night and Day" is to instantly comprehend the marriage of sophistication and pure emotion at the heart of Porter's finest work.
