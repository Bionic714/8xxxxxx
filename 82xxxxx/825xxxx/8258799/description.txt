Cody DiekhoffΓÇÖs wryly aphoristic, darkly amusing country-folk songcraft evokes icons like John Prine and Steve Earle while it fits in with the top tier of current-day Americana artists like fellow Chicagoan Joe Pug. Recorded under DiekhoffΓÇÖs performing name Chicago Farmer, his new album Backenforth, IL is just out and it tells a catchy bunch of tales. In a big city, his misfit characters would be called nonconformists ΓÇô in a a rural area, theyΓÇÖre more likely to be considered smalltime criminals, and heΓÇÖs got a soft spot for them.

The opening track, Everybody in This Town is the musical standout here. It sounds like the Wallflowers backing John Prine, with a Joe Day organ break thatΓÇÖs beyond gorgeous, something that keyboardists will be nicking years from now. Drawling over it, Dieckhoff contemplates the rougher side of smalltown life and how everybodyΓÇÖs business is everybody elseΓÇÖs.

The next track is Working on It, a swaying honkytonk tune with some tasty dobro. A song that breaks the fourth wall might not be the first thing you would think of in country music but this one does, and it works. A stoner folk tune with bite, The Twenty Dollar Bill at first seems like itΓÇÖs going to turn into a sentimental tale about missing the old folks but takes quickly an unexpected turn thatΓÇÖs too good to spoil here.

With its bubbling pedal steel and brisk bluegrass shuffle beat, Backenforth is another song that at first sounds a lot more happy and laid-back than it turns out to be. The swaying, all-acoustic 200 Miles Away is a mystery story, with a country-blues feel like the stuff thatΓÇÖs been coming out of Brooklyn lately. The best tale of all of them here is The Jon Stokes Prison Break Blues, a scampering account of a smalltime crook who busts out of jail, with some unexpected punchlines ΓÇô itΓÇÖs a story worthy of Woody Guthrie.

The edgiest song here, another one that brings to mind Woody Guthrie, is Who on Earth, a scathing broadside directed at holier-than-thou hypocrites:

I got a ticket for a busted headlight
ItΓÇÖs 11 AM, sunny and bright
LimitΓÇÖs 55, I was doing 57
Now I donΓÇÖt know how IΓÇÖll get into heaven

And it gets better from there. The album ends with Backseat, a jaunty country-folk shuffle.
