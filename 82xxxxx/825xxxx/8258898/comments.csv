,defcon545,2013-03-15T19:13Z,Seriously? Uploaded almost 100GB already yet have only been able to D/L 4. Come on now..
,Skulzyy,2013-03-15T20:05Z,This needs some more seeders XD
,Groffse,2013-03-15T23:09Z,"Uploaded over 40 GB and downloaded 9 GB.
Please seed!"
,Angela1986,2013-03-16T00:36Z,Ppl need to stop being stuck up assholes and seed.
,DarkSamus75,2013-03-16T00:56Z,"@Groffse
If you have the November release this would let you update FAR easier by joining in at over 70% done.
However, I must say that I wasn't planning to release these to public trackers ever again (my GF hijacked my PC and released it) because seeding the November 2012 release was a horrible experience due to all the H&Rs.
If people prove to me they will seed then I will reconsider making this a regular thing when each new disc arrives.
But unless people seed I will be VERY unwilling to do it."
,DarkSonik,2013-03-16T06:58Z,I will be seeding. I'm at 54.6% and when it's done I'll most likely be seeding for a day or two.
,defcon545,2013-03-16T09:45Z,Seriously this is damn ridiculous.. I'm at a Upload to Download ratio of 38:1 right now. It should never be this bad.
,DarkSamus75,2013-03-16T10:24Z,"@defcon545
Just shows how many others are not pulling there weight."
,DarkSonik,2013-03-16T11:26Z,Only at 60.5%. I still plan on seeding for a couple days. 
,Groffse,2013-03-16T11:51Z,"@DarkSamus75
Would be really nice if you did!
I got an account on a private torrentsite, but TPB usually have bigger bundles/collections. :)"

i doubt because i downloaded the november version and not working at all!"
,Skulzyy,2013-03-16T19:18Z,"I'm now into my second day of downloading and apparently my DL rate is 500 kb/s while the upload is 1.5 Mb/s. Usually it's the reverse. Also, has anyone actually fully downloaded this and got it working? I need to know if it actually works so I wont waste my time waiting for it to finish up"
,DarkSonik,2013-03-16T19:31Z,@dilinwe it better work I've been waiting for like two days for this to download and I'll be seeding for a couple days as well lul

,DarkSamus75,2013-03-16T23:44Z,"OK, I'm pulling the plug.
In the past 10 minutes I've watched 15 people reach 100% just to disappear and not seed.
I'm not gonna play this game again.
Do not expect any future release to appear on public trackers again."
,DarkSonik,2013-03-16T23:51Z,"@DarkSamus75 People are greedy assholes..

I'll still seed at least. Fuck sake people, this is why we can't have nice things. "
,Skulzyy,2013-03-17T00:47Z,There are a solid 3 people seeding right now. We need more.
,TheCyberPunk,2013-03-17T01:14Z,"I'm currently seeding, it's going to take forever to completely install though."
,Dr_Dave,2013-03-17T04:18Z,I bought some of this shit for my daughter for her birthday. These fuckers made it so hard to do anything because of their copy protection shit... I'm just gonna get the pirate version now. Fuck em. Thanks guys. Will seed when online. FUCK EA! ;)

Ahhh, that damn 0x0175dcbb error.
Its a common error that effects even legit buyers.
If you Google it you will see TONNES of results appear.
Sadly I can't just give you a simple answer as it seems that different solutions work for different people.
Please Google the error and I am sure you will find something that works for you.
Sorry I can't give more help than that."

,Ravanche,2013-03-18T20:59Z,"Hm. Have the DLC files been decrapified? I did the full install, but the pay worlds and several of the store packs don't show in-game as buyable. Either that or (most likely) did I screw up somewhere?"

,valshiv,2013-03-20T13:15Z,Where should the disc be? I Am using the TSW3.exe or whatever its called to launch the game. Is that wrong?

It's just how bittorrent works.  It doesn't mean people are maliciously not seeding.  And writing ""seed"" x100 in a comment here wouldn't reach their eyes anyway.  

Get some groceries, and chores or homework done so that when it does complete, you can submerge fully into your new addiction."

point is, I need help on installing and i need step by step instructions. Forgive me for being new. but we all are at one point, right? 

So i open the rar file ""sims 3"" i figured thats what you start out with, and i've never bought the game so when the instructions said if im ""reinstalling from scratch"" i got confused, cuz i've never installed it period. Soooo... I'm opening the Sims 3 file and it extracts and then asks me to insert a blank disc in order to burn it to a disk??? is that true? So i need to go out and by a special type of disc now or what?

and then after that do i eject the disc only to insert it once more and copy it into my computer as if its the real sims 3?

Soooo what am I missing here? haha, also, i was going to skip that part and try to keep going, and I went to extract the Sims 3 Store Fixes and it is a .package file?? I googled to find a program to open it, and only came up with Linux? lol I haven't used anything with Linux since like 1998.

Should we install it?  Maybe different people using different options are where problems arise?

Seems like a great way to ruin the installation by calling home.

Yeah all of the expansions get merged into the game.  You use the core TS3W.exe to launch the game no matter which expansions you add.

Yasmin is making me want to stop seeding...

I ended up running the update again after installing every single  expansion, and it didn't do any good nor harm.  Expansion version numbers are still the same.

I agree about not installing everything.  it takes like 2 mins to get into the game because of all of the expansions & Stuffs I installed.  Try to skip any expansions you don't really want.

P.S.  you can get stuff off the Sims 3 exchange without registering by going to the webpage of the item you want, and Viewing Source.  Search the source code for ""sims3pack"" for the download link."
,DarkSamus75,2013-03-28T11:28Z,"@mytpbacct
Thank you for adding a very informative post.
Couple of things I do wanna add though...
Installing Origin is optional.
If you don't install Origin you can't use the loader to download updates. You can only install DLC.
However if you do install Origin it will check AND download updates for you.
Even better, you can install said updates without fear because the crack is update proof meaning it will still work.
I have been updating the game using Origin for 1 year now and have had zero concerns.
Secondly you can add expansions or stuff packs even new ones as they come out in the future."
,DarkSamus75,2013-03-28T11:31Z,"Oh, and when I install Origin I always leave it until the last disc (So that I am installing the newest one)
I wouldn't try to download direct from Sims 3 exchange, but you can indeed install any custom content you wish.
All DLC was current at the release of University."
,DarkSamus75,2013-03-28T11:43Z,"@davyeast
Sorry but the patches were removed to shrink the size of this pack.
you would need to get your update files from EA's.
So you would install the basegame and than move straight to finding the latest patch online.
You will also need to find out how to crack the Mac version online somewhere and get anything you may need.
This Bundle will be good for Mac if you download the discs, keygen? and guides.
Not sure about the Keygen. Again... you will need to do research, or just try it.
This Bundle was made thinking of shrinking it for PC users use.
Good luck, as it is still a fantastic start due to the ripped discs. (Download size wise)"
,deja_hen,2013-03-28T21:38Z,"Ok, so I installed the base game and the 1.50.56 patch. The base game works fine. But when I tried to install the Supernatural expansion pack I got an error that said this is an earlier version and the updated version must be unistalled first.

So my question is do I have to install the expansion pack before I install the 1.50.56 patch?"

Read the install guide more carefully guys.
You are all making mistakes."

Everything installs well.
My only issue is that I can play the game for about 30 min before it glitches and I end up having to shut it down.
Is it just my computer or is it possible its something in the files? "

Hello I am fairly new to pirates bay. I have downloaded your torrent It took a week even though my internet speed is around 20-25 Mbits per second, windows 8 user btw. I am having problems. I do everything as you specified exactly and im launching from ""ts3.exe"" it loads fine until the main menu where it says something about not having a cd. When i copy the nocd files it say nothing about replacing files which leads me to believe something is not right. I am looking forward to your input here is my email contact.leobuzzard@gmail.com"

You need to run ts3w.exe, NOT ts3.exe"

,DarkSamus75,2013-04-09T02:25Z,"@Brohanski
Can you please check the crack is in the correct place.

You should have a path in your ""My Documents folder"" that goes like this...

""Electronic Arts/The Sims 3/Mods/Packages""
In the Mods folder should be a file called ""Resource.cfg""
And in the Packages folder you should see ""NRaas_NoCD.package""
If either of these are not there that is the reason for the error you are seeing."
,Simone2709,2013-04-09T21:55Z,"I have the ""Resource.cfg"" and ""NRaas_NoCD.package"" at the right place, but when it comes to start the game and choose city i get a message; ""The Sims 3 game disc is not found"". I followed the pdf by step..."

,fatallace,2013-04-11T02:58Z,Hi - Im currently installing some of the expansions but im encountering a problem.. The thing is when installing and being asked for an Registration Code - The keygen only provides only a few code's for certain expansions. So i dont know if I missed anything in the package where it provides the rest of the code's for the other expansions. More specifically - Im trying to install the University Life but the multi key gen doesnt provide a code for that expansion.
