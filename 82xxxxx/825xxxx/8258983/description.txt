I recorded the opener, NEeMA. I had never heard of her before, but she was pretty amazing. I ended up buying her CD on the spot I was so impressed. Her new album "Watching You Think" was produced by Leonard Cohen, which might encourage some people to give her a try.

1. Intro
2. Elsa's Lullaby
3. Unspoken
4. Lost In LA
5. Ayìi Woòle
