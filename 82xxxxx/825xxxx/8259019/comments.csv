That was fast

Awesome"
,dEadEyEjnr,2013-03-15T11:19Z,Thank you so much! 
,Elephant34,2013-03-15T13:51Z,Audio balance is so bad it's unbelievable
,sansuix1,2013-03-15T15:27Z,"Yeah. You cant hear the dialogue.  

Unless you can fix the volume problem by using a program like Adobe Audition 6 with its Voice Volume Leveler edit feature DO NOT BOTHER DOWNLOADING THIS MOVIE / RIFF.

If you do have Audition 6, no problem.  You can fix it easily.

,trace535,2013-03-15T16:14Z,"Yeah, the riff voices are far too loud compared to the movie audio, and also why the 2 GB filesize?

Twilight movies are shit anyway, so 700MB at 640x272 would have been plenty enough."
,Sojuuk,2013-03-16T03:52Z,"I am in the process of rendering a better version, eta 5 hours till I upload an audio balanced version.  Warning, it will be 2gb plus because I don't tolerate low resolution even for shitty movies."
,sarcastos,2013-03-16T05:19Z,"""I don't tolerate low resolution even for shitty movies""
But you tolerate uploading extremely shitty files for your first and only upload?
Your toleration is all over the place."
,christo7,2013-03-16T07:07Z,"sarcastos, you're scolding the wrong person, dipshit."
,Snaptrap,2013-03-16T07:51Z,There are players that will balance the audio on the fly using audio normalizers. My sound card has THX Smart Sound which does the same thing.
,anoyed12,2013-03-16T11:11Z,"@trace535 exactly, it's not 720p, it's dvd rip even black bars on top and bottom are not cropped so it does not fill the screen on widescreen monitor. Horrible release.

on side note it's 2 gig because audio tracks is uncompressed wave file. By itself audio takes 1.2 GB"
,Sojuuk,2013-03-16T21:53Z,"I made a better version here:

,monnnster,2013-03-19T06:12Z,Why has the better version disappeared?
