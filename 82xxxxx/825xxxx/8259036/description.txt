Searching for Steele / (Irakin pyÃ¶velit)

Ahead of the 10-year anniversary of the Iraq invasion, the Guardian has just gone live with a 15-month joint investigation with BBC Arabic alleging that the Pentagon sent Ret'd Colonel James Steele, a US veteran of the "dirty wars" in Central America, to Iraq to oversee police commando units that tortured detainees for information on the Insurgency. The investigation also links General David Petraeus in the chain of command to this abuse.
From the summer of 2004 the Special Police Commandos were financed and equipped from a fund controlled by General Petraeus. Ret'd Colonel James Steele and Colonel James Coffman, two special forces veterans were assigned as "advisors" to this force, which eventually numbered over 17,000 men.
Colonel James Coffman reported to General Petraeus and described himself in an interview with the US military newspaper, Stars and Stripes as Petraeus' "eyes and ears out on the ground" in Iraq.
The Special Police Commandos came to draw most of their recruits from violent Shia militias like the Badr Brigades. The commandos who developed a fearful reputation, particularly in the Sunni community, also became involved in death squad activities.
