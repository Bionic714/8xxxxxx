There's also a booklet included. It's a bit blurry but what do you expect from Apple.

This album was $19 which I think is way too much for anyone to ever spend on a _digital_ album so I hope you guys appreciate it.
and if you can, please buy the CD. 

Also look out for Bartos touring this year.


I won't be able to seed very much, so please seed if you can.
