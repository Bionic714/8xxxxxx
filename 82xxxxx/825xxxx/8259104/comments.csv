,frkzoid,2013-03-16T01:09Z,Don't know how to rate it. The video stops at 7:09 for me on VLC. Probably not worth watching reading the comments so I'll skip this one. Thanks for the download anyway.

,tdurden83,2013-03-21T17:44Z,"is it shitty that they make such atrocious movies to make a quick buck? sure. do people who pay money to buy/rent them right as they're hitting theaters deserve what they get? fuck yes they do! I might have a tiny shred of sympathy for people who waste $ renting them at redbox AFTER the real movies have also been released on dvd, but even then it doesn't take a genius to puzzle out that these are knock offs. a fool and his money..."

,Devo21,2013-03-25T15:17Z,"Lol, seriously some people are thick as shit. First you clicked on ""Jack the Giant Killer"" not slayer, then you ignored the poster for the film which has some fugly monster on it not giants, then you didn't bother to read the first thing Neon wrote saying it wasn't the big budget film but a B-movie rip off.. yet you comment on here calling Neon a dick!! Open your eyes next time."
