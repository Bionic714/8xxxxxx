Pls can you make windows 7 ultimate x86 and x64 AIO? I want to put it in my USB. 
Thanks for your hard work."
[V],murphy78,2013-03-15T09:01Z,Patience. First I get the process right with the most popular versions each month. Then I work on AIO versions.
,apex2000,2013-03-15T09:15Z,Thanks
,mrthuvi,2013-03-15T10:53Z,"Thanks. murphy78. I'll be waiting for the AIO. You rock, man!"
,xXc00kiezXx,2013-03-15T13:11Z,i have a 32-bit computer(x86) and im wondering if i will be able to chose between 32 or 64 during the installation. my computer says its 64-bit compatible. any answer will be appreciated.
,mrthuvi,2013-03-15T13:39Z,"@xXc00kiezXx: with this version, no, you cant choose between 32bit or 64bit when you install. This torrent is the x86 (32bit) version.
But you can install 32bit or 64bit on your computer any version you like. Search google for the different between those two."
[V],murphy78,2013-03-15T23:00Z,"Basically you want to use x86 version for any computer with 4gb of ram, and 2 cpu cores or less. If you have 4 cpu cores and 6+gb of ram you want to use x64 version."
,ssgokou,2013-03-16T07:37Z,"People...He usually release the ultimate version first because it's obvious that it's easier to do because of its size. Thank you for this and now downloading. But my usual complain like your other uploads is that while there are lot of seeders, nobody's seeding! And don't tell me it's my internet, I can download other things at maximum speed. But the speed here is ridiculous. What a bunch of selfish people -_-

Anyway thank you again for this release and will wait for your Win7 AIO."
[V],murphy78,2013-03-16T12:59Z,"Yah for some reason I tend to attract a lot of people who don't like to help seed. Obviously there are also some good people who help seed a lot, but in general it seems like my torrents are leecher-bait."
,Nomadzx,2013-03-17T03:36Z,"This is Boot-able from a dvd?
Or only AIO to upgrade?

Thanks murphy78 , you are the best!"
,s.d.a,2013-03-17T06:32Z,One question. Can i use Ei.cfg removal utility in this windows?
[V],murphy78,2013-03-17T08:03Z,"ei.cfg is already gone, though it would still list both index choices being set to what it was set to.

You can install from boot, or upgrade from a previous x86 version of windows from this dvd."
,s.d.a,2013-03-17T09:51Z,"So even if i use this tool it won't make any difference,  and will automatically install the Ultimate edition? I am right? 
Just wanted a way to install any edition, if possible.

Thanks for answering."
