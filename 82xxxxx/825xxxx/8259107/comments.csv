[V],murphy78,2013-03-15T08:44Z,"I have included a little UEFI conversion tool that I made piecing together a few things. It can convert the iso to EFI mode, but it also splits the install.wim to 2gb chunks of swm version.

Note that it is very preliminary and NOT necessary when the install.wim is less than 4GB.  I have included it because some people may prefer the DVD to boot in EFI mode.

Please let me know if the conversion process doesn't work properly. I haven't had time to actually test the resulting file that it creates."

,izajasz,2013-03-15T13:18Z,"Did anyone test UEFI converter ? AS i understand , when You want to isntall win7 in UEFI mode You need to use this converter right? I am long searching for an updated iso of windows that actually installs 100% without problem while booting in UEFI mode. Murphy78 is it absolutely needed to use this converter You say You included ? Or it will boot when i choose UEFI: My DVD drive instead of Legacy boot ?"

,izajasz,2013-03-15T13:35Z,Did anyone test UEFI converter ? Does it work properly? I am long looking for windows 7 with all updates which can install in uefi mode.

,Val777,2013-03-15T22:08Z,"Very good torrents, guys SEED please.

I am not downloading this, but I am sure that it is worth it. SEED, support the guy.

But I have only one question, if you integrate all windows updates in this OS, then you integrate update KB971033 that blocks pirate activation?

Can you explain this to me, please.

Thanks, keep the good work."
[V],murphy78,2013-03-15T23:02Z,"I have not included kb971033, which is also not in the kbfile list that I posted.

With windows loader, it doesn't matter if you install it or not, though I would recommend against it."
[V],murphy78,2013-03-15T23:06Z,"isajasz from my understanding, to boot the dvd using EFI boot sector, you would need to rebuild the iso using the commands specified in my oscdimg line of the script in the tool.

For fat32 usb drive support you just need all the files to be less than 4gb max-size. So that's why I made the split also on the conversion tool. It's not necessary in THIS release because the install.wim is already less than 4gb, but you can play with it if you like."
[V],murphy78,2013-03-15T23:08Z,"oh... missed a question about needing to use converter if booting in UEFI.

That's a good question. You may need to prep your hard disk before installing Windows 7. I believe Windows 8 has built-in UEFI support during setup, but for Windows 7 I'm not sure how it works."

[V],murphy78,2013-03-16T06:58Z,Read the instructions guys. You have to change the filename in the 7z line. Of course it's not gonna work on win8 if you don't change the iso file to extract.

[V],murphy78,2013-03-17T03:36Z,"on the UEFI tool issue, try extracting the tool files to the same directory as the .ISO file. Then make sure the 7z call uses the correct .ISO name.

If that doesn't work, you could try just extracting the iso manually and running the commands manually. I mean, it's a pain in the butt; but nobody is really making any GUI stuff for this. I'm trying to help out the full-UEFI folks that don't have any legacy support."
,izajasz,2013-03-17T10:47Z,YEs. Screamingtrees is right. Im am sure i am pasting the correct iso name. I tried wit h2 diffrent isos (paths in the script were correct as i placed the script with the iso in same folder). An i get the error...

,screamingtrees,2013-03-17T13:57Z,"@murphy78, I tried both of your suggestions. the converter won't do anything, even if I try extracting manually and then deleting the part of the script that does the extraction. i would try doing the whole conversion manually, but I'm not sure how to. I'm using a computer that came pre-installed with windows 8. And I'm not sure I even need to use the conversion tool, but when I tried to follow the guide linked by izajasz to make the usb boot drive, and I get ""Failed to boot Windows"" in the boot menu. So I thought might as well try the uefi conversion to see if that helps"

,jcm5182,2013-03-19T03:57Z,Hello. I wrote the iso file to a DVD and did a clean installation on my laptop. When prompted I chose the Pre-Activated version. However once the installation was complete I am being asked for a Product Key. Where can I find this? 
[V],murphy78,2013-03-19T13:32Z,"jcm, that is because I didn't run it through a set-product key pass. I could have, but that would bring about more problems.

You can simply click the skip button on the key part. It will change anything you enter anyway with the windows loader oem key."
[V],murphy78,2013-03-19T13:36Z,"screamingtrees. I am trying to make a version right now for my AIO that searches for any .iso files in the current directory. I'm also adding a bit of current directory passing with ""%~dp0"".

[V],murphy78,2013-03-21T02:43Z,"maro, hard to say. When I upload stuff I usually seed for quite a while at 2.8MB/sec. I think I tend to attract a lot of people with low internet upload speed that don't help share the load.

On the UEFI issue. I'm sorry the version in this release doesn't work with people who haven't installed 7-zip 32-bit. I used that so people could try to convert but I forgot the 7z.dll. It never asked me for it because I had it installed and I guess it looks for the program files folder.

Also, it doesn't seem to like to split the install.wim. When you try to install, if the licensing terms are not on the first split, then it will not install.  I'm going to poke around by mounting and seeing if I can put the licensing terms in the boot.wim instead, so it can be split without failing install.

In my win8aio this month I made one that does a simple convert for the iso, but it doesn't split.  If I do manage to get a split working, it will probably also need to mount the boot.wim files and copy over license data.  I tried a simple autounattend to skip the eula, but it doesn't work. It still needs to read the information first.

Tis a puzzle, but I'll see if I can get it working after my win7aio."
,izajasz,2013-03-21T16:20Z,"I think the uefi doesnt work because of some updates that are installing with sysprep. I retyped the commands from the script manually and i made the iso with split files but it still didnt show as UEFI:  , and when i make uefi usb drive it boots with uefi but it locks up on the windows ""lights"" makeing the flag."
,laxer23,2013-03-21T17:01Z,"I'm having problems. I followed the steps very carefully a handful of times. I copied the iso onto my flashdrive.

If you have a driver floppy disk, CD, DCD, or USB flash drive, please insert it now.""

Is it saying I have a problem with my drivers (if so, how did it read the flash drive to begin with?)?

Open command promt
diskpart
list disk
select disk 1
clean
create partition primary
format fs=fat32 quick
active
assign
list volume
exit

Then I mounted the iso. 
Sent the files from the iso to my flash drive.
Copied the ""boot"" folder from efimicrosoftboot up one folder to become efiboot (I copied it, so there is still a boot folder in the microsoft folder).
Used 7-Zip to open archive on sourcesinstall.wim.
Copied the file ""bootmgfw.efi"" from sourcesinstall.wim1windowsbootefi onto my desktop.
Changed the name from ""bootmgfw.efi"" to ""bootx64.efi"".
Copied the new file, ""bootx64.efi"", and put it in the efiboot folder.

Then I put my flash drive in my desktop (the desktop I am installing windows on), booted from ""UEFI: SanDisk Extreme 0001"", and received the error I mentioned above.

Any help here would be appreciated."

,izajasz,2013-03-21T23:51Z,"@laxer 
Do not mount the iso. Format the usb drive as you wrote using diskpart then extract the iso using 7zip to the usb . Enter efi/microsoft folder and copy boot folder so it resides also at efi/ and extract or download bootx54.efi file and paste it into the efi/boot folder . Thats how i did it and it works perfectly :)"

,stewox,2013-04-01T10:47Z,"IMPORTANT:
@izajasz 

Doing the Bootx64.efi thing is for GPT format, you don't want to do that if you want MBR.

You guys have to research more to reconfirm what you're doing here are some links:

Those guides are old and do not know the existance of murphy's UEFI ISO converter so they all point for FLASH STICK 

ALSO you need to read the guides because for SSDs it's important to inject INTEL RST Driver for AHCI/RAID

http://www.tomshardware.co.uk/forum/314707-30-please-desperate-asus-p9x79-windows-help

http://www.overclock.net/t/1156654/seans-windows-7-install-optimization-guide-for-ssds-hdds

http://hardforum.com/showthread.php?p=1039181498

As the tomshardware guide says you have to put intel SATA into RAID mode even if you don't have raid. It will trick WIN7 and let you inject INTEL RST F6 drivers (iaStorA.inf). You can set SATA mode back to AHCI after install.

Extracting, moving, and renaming to Bootx64.efi is for GPT format as far as I've seen from this, so don't do that if you want MBR just make sure you use UEFI iso converter without splitting scripts for DVD. It booted up for me i have it running right now. But i can see more guides on the web kind of confusing ... check the overclocking.net link for a PROPER GPT/MBR guide it seems you can switch between either formats right there in command prompt."
,stewox,2013-04-01T10:49Z,"Also, forgot to mention, I think the SATA RAID workaround is fopr X79 chipset only, maybe not, but searched mainly for ASUS P9X79"
,madgame18,2013-04-01T18:01Z,hey murphy do you have email on wich i can contact you i have a proposal for you?
,stewox,2013-04-01T18:13Z,"UPDATE: Damn it seems like , i didn't use any of the CMD manual tools maybe there is some way to force MBR in UEFI mode.

This is something murphy could look into more easily, a way to disable GPT support and remove it totally so it will have to be MBR no matter what boot mode. 

If I find nothing on the web i'll do it my self (but if it takes too long i'll abandon)"
