,d4rkedge,2013-03-15T11:32Z,"Looking good, but SEED guys.. don't leech, 1/0.5 ratio at least.. kthx."
,XHaloXX,2013-03-15T11:41Z,"ghost, this torrent is dead, no seeders!!"
,XHaloXX,2013-03-15T11:41Z,"oh, this is new one, the one you uploaded yesterday is dead, this one has 7 seeds. thx"
,Pakundo,2013-03-15T12:21Z,But is there a way to make this work with a legitimate Steam install?
,XHaloXX,2013-03-15T13:15Z,"@Pakundo, you need to extract the DLC exe (try winrar), then copy the extracted contents to AC3 folder inside steamapps."
,Pakundo,2013-03-15T13:33Z,"So nobody knows if I can make this work with a Steam install, then?"
,Pakundo,2013-03-15T13:33Z,"Sorry, didn't see your comment.

Are you sure that even works?
I'm still downloading so I can't try it yet."
,Jman2919,2013-03-15T13:35Z,.
,Pakundo,2013-03-15T17:24Z,"Confirmed useless for Steam installations, this installer is meant for non-steam Uplay installations, with the proper registry entries."
,kaliver,2013-03-15T21:14Z,if only there were something called The Internet where you could ask for the proper registry entries and have other people post them for you
,asdf98,2013-03-15T22:12Z,"Fuck that shit , I've lost my save files >:("
,Sicrift,2013-03-16T00:58Z,ghostnet has a disclaimer about the save files on here! and a txt. and how to keep your save !  hate to say it but you should of read before you jump right in.
,Sicrift,2013-03-16T01:00Z,"i cant get any of these updates 1.04 to install. it stops near the start of the install bar and says error incorrect .source file. then closes. ? i'm stumped.  i'm sure its not this update, its something at my end..."
,asdf98,2013-03-16T09:46Z,Is anyone can upload the save files for the Infamy?

,carl4442,2013-03-17T10:33Z,"I'm using the RG Revenants 1.03 version (http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8167208).  How do I get version 1.04 installed? I tried running AssassinsCreed3Updater1.04_DIGITAL.exe, but that fails (presumably because the multiplayer files were ripped)"
,weedfuck123,2013-03-17T15:07Z,"Ha carl4442, try this one
You may try like this:
1. Run the update exe, wait until the welcome info comes out.
2. Go to your TEMP folder (press win+r and type %TEMP%), find extracted patch files, which may inside the folder called {9D15E813-0C26-41E7-ABC5-3EB06FF1B3CF} or something like this.
3. Delete Disk1deltaFilesmulti
4. Switch to installation, press next to start. 
5. there could be file named as ""multi"" in the temp folder. deleting that file will be fine as well."
,carl4442,2013-03-18T06:23Z,"@weedfuck123

,napoli666,2013-03-20T15:46Z,"I'm using RG version too, I was able to update to 1.03, then install and play The Infamy.
I used the same method to update to 1.04, and then installed The Betrayal, however I play, theres no sign of the DLC in my game.

,napoli666,2013-03-20T15:47Z,"* I've installed The Betrayal, however when I try to find it to play, theres no sign of the DLC in my game.
