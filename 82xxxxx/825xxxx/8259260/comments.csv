It's been a rough week here.
But your uploads give me something to look forward to at the end of the day. 
So long as you enjoy yourself, please upload more great torrents! 

I do have two more underrated 80s flicks to humbly request...

Black Moon Rising
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090735/?ref_=sr_1

It's got Tommy Lee Jones, Linda Hamilton and a rocket car! :)

The Company of Wolves
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087075/?ref_=sr_1

Modern takes on fairy tales don't have teeth, like this one!
Grossly overlooked gorgeous gem from Neil Jordan.
Hard enough to find on DVD. A 720p would be a treasure!

 Keep up the awesome work, Nomad!"
