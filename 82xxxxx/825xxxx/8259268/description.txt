L'aîné des Ferchaux (Magnet of Doom) (1963) (original title)
Jean-Pierre Melville

UPLOADER's NOTE: quite hard to find obscure Melville, more so in a DVD rip like this is. I have to thank the original ripper DIVADANIELA and recommend you to watch this and I'll give you a few reasons though I could keep going on:

• Georges Delerue noir like score
• fantastic USA sceneries
• Charles Vanel brilliant and emphatic performance
• Malvina Silverberg (oh yes, the gorgeous half naked red head Lina)
• Michele Mercier 
• a very young Stefania Sandrelli

Review: Surprisingly good, 24 July 2003 

Author: StevieGB from London, England 


I saw this at London's National Film Theatre a couple of nights ago. The print, the best they could lay their hands on, was scratched and the colour had faded to the extent that much of it was a pinky sepia. Also, I could find very few reviews to read beforehand (zero on the IMDB). So I wasn't expecting much.

And I was therefore very pleasantly surprised. The tale of an old crooked banker who absconds to the US with a young male golddigger really works. Charles Vanel (who was so brilliant in The Wages of Fear) and Jean-Paul Belmondo are a wonderful team, as a very spiky and spiteful Father/Son relationship grows between them.

As a travelogue of a journey from New York to the Deep South it's fascinating, and reminded me, of all things, of Easy Rider, which I very much suspect it may have influenced.

There's a few problems with it, mainly due to the fact the Jean-Pierre Melville never really got the timing right when it came to editing emotional scenes (especially at the end).

But if you're a fan of the early Melville movies, Le Doulos in particular, then check it out.
