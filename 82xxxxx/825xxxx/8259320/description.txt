Storyline:
A young woman in a small Mid-Western town goes to a traveling carnival one evening, where she is urged by a silent clown to visit the carnival's circus and see The Aerialist,
the show's star attraction.
She is entranced by The Aerialist, but during his act he misses a catch and falls to the ground.
She rushes to help him, but then the ground beneath them gives way and they fall through into the dreamlike world of Cirque du Soleil.
Separated, they travel through the different tent worlds trying to find each other,
interacting with the strange and wonderful performers and performances of Cirque du Soleil.
