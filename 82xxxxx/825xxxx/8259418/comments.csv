[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-17T14:51Z,"thecardmonster, pretty much every marvel comic is in one of the complete marvel chronology torrents, go to h33t dot com and search for them. it helps a lot if you know when an issue or series was published, as they are compiled by cover date (rather than alphabetically)."
,LyokoMx,2013-03-18T12:06Z,"Hi, I looked the Marvel Chronology torrents that you mention OMG it's awesome! But these torrents do not have reprint issues (or maybe I'm wrong).

I am looking for the Classic X-men comics (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_X-Men) that reprinted Uncanny X-men because these issues included all new backup stories.

There is no torrent out there with these and in the US these stories have never been repinted in one collection, only part of the stories on some tpbs (I know that in Spain and Argentina some of them were collected)."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-18T14:23Z,"they are included in the complete marvel chronology torrents. i checked CMC 1986, 1987 and 1990 and they were all there.

note 1: only the first 44 issues (1986-1990) have new material, and in addition to back-up stories, these issues sometimes have new pages, new back covers, and new panels and script changes on certain pages.

note 2: in april 1990, the title changed to x-men classic with #46.

note 3: marvel reprinted 8 of them in 1997 as x-men: lost tales 1 and 2, and 25 of them as x-men: vignettes 1 and 2 from 2002 to 2005.

hope this helps!"
