Video: All episodes courtesy of LB65 aka Loicb54. These are the highest quality sources I could find 'direct' and not from a flash video site (Vimeo, Dailymotion, Youtube, etc). 1080i/p releases used and downscaled to 720p at x264 high profile CRF22 (Did numerous comparison tests on a proper 1080p display at varied viewing distances and saw no quality difference between the 720 and 1080 copies. I believe it was mentioned that current airings in France are likely upscaled 720p and dubbed episodes stateside are 'expected' to be 1080)

Subtitles: All but episode 2 are pulled from http://codelyokoevolutionfan.webs.com/ . Episode 2 was hand transcribed and massaged from Vimeo video ID 57229395 which apparently comes from 'straighttoheart' on Tumblr according to the description.

I do not claim credit to anything but combining these sources together in a direct easy to access source and tidying/trimming things while keeping quality up to par. I also take pride in making sure compatibility is open. Encoding is done via Handbrake using the unmodified Main High Profile preset and embedding standard SRT subtitles. Majority of hardware players including some modern smart TV's should handle these."
