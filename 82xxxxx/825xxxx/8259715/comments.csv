One question: did Threshold 003 get pushed back a week, or is it just missing so far?"
[V],mdusanjay,2013-03-15T15:14Z,Congrats man..reach 1000 soon :)

,unnim2,2013-03-15T15:38Z,congratulations. and thank you
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-15T15:43Z,"thanks everyone!

Nightwing1945, dc's website, comixology, cbr and comiclist.com all indicate that it was coming out on schedule. i didn't see it at my lcs, but then again i wasn't looking for it (i could only afford 3 comics 'cause guardians of the galaxy vol. 2 ""broke the bank"")."
,BabiesDontNeedSpleens,2013-03-15T16:36Z,"Congrats on the milestone, and thanks for the UL. "
,degu2012,2013-03-15T17:33Z,what is the reading order for this? i downloaded this torrent - http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7386917/Crossed and was just wondering what its missing and with all the mini-series/spin offs(?) it's got a little confusing. all help much appreciated. 
,GP67,2013-03-15T18:46Z,congratulations. and thanks
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-15T18:52Z,"degu2012, read crossed 0, and 1-9. then family values 1-7, then psychopath 1-7, then badlands ... i'm not sure where wish you were here fits in (it takes place in isolated scotland), but if i had to choose i'd just read it alongside or after badlands.

if you only want to read the ennis stories, i believe those are crossed 0, 1-9, badlands 1-3 and this new one."
,degu2012,2013-03-15T19:02Z,"cheers buddy, and yes i was just after the Ennis stories not too keen on Lapham's writing its a bit too formulaic."
,degu2012,2013-03-15T19:16Z,and has anybody got #18 they'd like to share? there is a copy on here but its in PDF and i can't be arsed messing about with those.
,Calel1234,2013-03-15T19:30Z,Congrats and thanks for all your hard work!
,scienceho,2013-03-15T19:32Z,"Congrats on 500!

And degu2012, you can just read this now if you want. Only about 5% of crossed stories intersect, and even those are rarely important to continuity. Plus, Badlands is a collection of serials, and this is the first part of a new arc."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-15T19:35Z,"here's a torrent that has 18 included as .cbr
http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7889604/"
,degu2012,2013-03-15T20:33Z,awesome! thanks for that.
,thc-1138,2013-03-15T23:12Z,thank you!!!
,binderguy1,2013-03-16T00:07Z,"Thanks for the honor of sharing your 500th comic post with us!  I don't know how many uploaders out there has spent a good chunk of their lives posting these torrents at the bequests of others.  Kudos to you and them!

You know what you should do to celebrate?  Go out and have a beer (or 3) and then start on a ""More than complete Avatar"" torrents!  

I was going to suggest Marvel or Dark Horse, but that's probaby too damn many!!!  ;-)

Congrats, man!"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-16T01:27Z,"well i did go out and have pizza and soda! not for torrenting really, but it's been a bitch of a week.

sadly it might be impossible to do a complete avatar collection. i was thinking about the old avatar threshold anthology series today when i posted threshold from dc. it's hard as hell to find those old avatar series from the late 90s."
,binderguy1,2013-03-16T03:33Z,"No worries, there's always somebody out there who might go for it, if they have the collection.

By the way, I was wondering about something:  what do those Pink Skulls (or green) icon mean?  I've also noticed Yellow balloons, square icons under the title of post links."
,oskar5000,2013-03-16T04:30Z,"Thank you very much maryville, for all that you do and grats on the 500!"
,muckymucks,2013-03-16T05:15Z,"Congrats on 500 uploads, dude. Thanks for all you do!"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-16T13:54Z,"binderguy1, pink means trusted and is the 1st level of ""honors"" on tpb (i really don't see that i deserved it, but i'm honored). green is the next level, i forget what it's called. then there are moderators (icon says MOD)... i'm sure there are others, like you mentioned.

the significant difference, aside from being recognized for contributing which was really a kind gesture on their part, is that my posts are seen among the top 100 lists. well, and random visitors to the site -- if they're smart -- perhaps will feel secure in downloading a torrent from me."
,huffle,2013-03-17T21:04Z,Congrats!  And thank you!  And you're awesome!  :)
,holdensedan,2013-03-19T05:56Z,"Thanks for the upload and congratulations for the uploads.
It's good to see Garth Ennis back, the last story wasn't really up to scratch."
,thadmacracken,2013-05-26T04:45Z,thank you
