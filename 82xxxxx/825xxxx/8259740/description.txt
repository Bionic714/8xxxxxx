The first ever Crossed Annual promises a super-sized tale of extreme horror you will not want to miss! Simon Spurrier unveils a standalone story, that is a perfect starting point for new readers, exploring a black corridor from before Wish You Were Here! While the weekly www.crossedcomic.com features the whole cast, one character screamed out for a special one shot issue that tells his tale of woe. Jackson, the mad Scotsman who tears into the Crossed with the sort of efficiency only the truly insane could accomplish, was hard-as-nails before the outbreak. Then he got tougher. Spurrier and the stunning art of Gabriel (Ferals) Andrade deliver a grueling dose of viciousness that explores what it means to be insane in a World gone Crossed. There is no hope. There is no help. There is only the Crossed.
