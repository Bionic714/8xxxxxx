[T],TeamExtreme,2013-03-16T11:19Z,"@oneawesome

You can't. Minecraft is coded to run in that directory and places all the files there, even if you run it from another directory."
,wolfenstein4,2013-03-16T12:33Z,"Hi TeamExtreme when are you going to Update your 1.4.7 server to 1.5 server!!!

And one more question what are the Best recommended Specs for Minecraft!!!"
,wolfenstein4,2013-03-16T13:56Z,"TeamExtreme can you Please give me a link for this  
skin http://teamextrememc.com/server.html this Warriror skin i really want it but cant find it!!!"
[T],TeamExtreme,2013-03-16T14:21Z,"@wolfenstein4

Yes indeed we are.

 If you take a look on our forums, you will see we have a close beta. Our Beta server will replace our 1.4.7 server as our new 1.5 server in a few days.

What are the best specs?

Minecraft is mostly a CPU based game, using 1 core, so a faster CPU is better but here are the official specs:

    CPU : Intel Pentium D or AMD Athlon 64 (K8) 2.6 GHz
    RAM : 4GB
    GPU : GeForce 6xxx or ATI Radeon 9xxx and up with OpenGL 2 Support (Excluding Integrated Chipsets)
    HDD : 150MB

Hope this helped."

That skin is my personal skin that I edited, which is why you can't find it anywhere :P"

,ZoLyrica,2013-03-18T10:44Z,"@TeamExtreme Just a heads up, Chicago Data Center servers are shit and its going to cause a lot of issues with latency for people in NV most specifically and a lot of people outside of there as well. "
,zistoire,2013-03-19T17:32Z,I can't connect to other servers
,BuddDwyer,2013-04-05T17:39Z,"I can't for the life of me get this version to run mods. I have a good enough computer, I have 64 bit Java, the torrent works fine, when I install it clean and play it offline..I'm not worried about playing online either..I just want to be able to install mods but it always crashes. Always. "

,aytimothy,2013-04-16T15:57Z,"I can't log onto servers with ""online-mode=true"" in the configs. (NB: They're not my server)"
,aytimothy,2013-04-16T16:00Z,"Oh, @TeamExtreme
It's possible to run Minecraft from a different directory (as in the .minecraft folder in another directory).

This launcher is able to do it and yes, you can use it to play ""offline"" with a username. It works.
(Enter a username and random password)
And you have to install Minecraft using this torrent FIRST before using this program.
