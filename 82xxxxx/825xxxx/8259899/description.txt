Legion of Super-Heroes #295
Timber Wolf is feeling confused when his girlfriend, Light Lass, wants to leave the Legion of Super-Heroes to learn about herself. She asked Timber Wolf to quit the Legion and join her, but the Legion is very important to him as well. Expressing his particular predicament to his friend Blok, Blok decides to play an old holotape of the Legion of Super-Heroes on an adventure. The Legion goes to the Time Institute to view the origin of the universe and a member of the Guardians of the Universe prevents them from doing so, telling them mortal are not meant to view it. The Guardians then send the Green Lantern Corps to destroy the Time Institute so that none may view the origins of the universe. The Legionnaires within the Institute fight the Green Lantern Corps until they are transported to Oa, where the matter is finally settled: The Legion won't view the origins and the Guardians won't intervene. One of the Green Lanterns, Vidar, journeys back to Earth with the Legionnaires and while they use a time bubble to visit the past, Vidar goes into the Time Institute to view the origin of the universe. The Legion return in time to stop him and Vidar is forced to stop being a Green Lantern. The holotape gives Timber Wolf a clear choice in his mind about what he should do and he decides to stay with the Legion, letting Light Lass go. Blok, meanwhile, realizes that Vidar was actually Universo.
