just doesn't seem right
if i'm wrong again I'm sorry"
,some-young-guy,2013-03-15T15:33Z,"I'd be more concerned with the claim that it's a DVDrip when we are clearly out of Screener season.  Me personally, I'll just wait the couple hours for other trusted uploaders that I'm more familiar and comfortable with to share the torrent."
,xMovie_Buffx,2013-03-15T15:38Z,it's not the one playing at the cinema..it's Jack the Giant Slayer not the Killer playing at the cinema.
,kingbmw,2013-03-15T16:12Z,nice its a dvdrip as stated
,becca.74,2013-03-15T23:47Z,Every time there is a big blockbuster at the theaters someone in the movie industry always has to make a horrible movie with the same subject and almost the same exact name to con people into buying or renting it. Your uploader is not trying to deceive you. This is a genuine movie just not the one out in theaters.
