,galadhon,2013-03-15T21:23Z,"Wrong description.
Its not iMARS release.
iMARS release have 83 files.

Its a ghostnet uncompressed release"

[V],Gh0stNet,2013-03-16T03:42Z,such dumb people are u trolling like idiots i don't release games its only uncompressed that's all if u think otherwise then download from some where else 
,sangano420,2013-03-16T06:37Z,I know that last comment wasn't directed at me.
[V],Gh0stNet,2013-03-16T08:59Z,"@sangano420
 yes not at you but at _whoa_"
,galadhon,2013-03-16T13:52Z,"sangano420: iMARS is a scene group.
They dump the original disc and release it.
The iMARS GoWJ realease has 83 rar files + NFO + SFV to check integrity

The point is:
iMARS does not release uncompressed files.
the title ""XBOX360-iMARS"" is incorrect
The correct title for this torrent is:
""Gears.of.War.Judgment.XBOX360-uncompressed, based on iMARS release"""
[V],Drarbg,2013-03-16T14:08Z,LOL idiots :D
[V],thenoobish,2013-03-16T15:08Z,"The release name is correct. If you want the rars go and register on a private tracker.

Ghostnet gives the correct creds to the iMARS team.

This is just unrared to help out the people."
[V],thenoobish,2013-03-16T16:59Z,"whoa: I know much more about scenereleases than you do. You even thought ""P2P"" was a scenegroup. Ha!

Torrents get uploaded unpacked so people don't have to. We are trusted users who doesn't upload fakes or viruses.

If you want untoached scenereleases move along. TPB is the last place to get them.

We give the credits to the releasers by having their release name in the title.

Scenegroups hate p2p places. They don't want their releases to end up here. But they do.

I really don't understand why you are here. This is not the best place to get the releases in the way they were packed in 2000.

This is IMARS release! Period.

If I buy a ps3, and then get it out of the cartboard. Isn't it made by Sony anymore?

To have a title like galadhon suggested is just stupid."
,vonepic,2013-03-17T04:41Z,"Regardless of who or where this came from - this release is broken.  The file won't extract with iso360extract, it won't recognize is 360cm, and when manually loaded into winrar, it shows it has standard video_ts and audio_ts folders.. 

Me thinks someone accidentally ripped it in haste in a pc drive, and it ended up reading it as mixed media, and is useless to us."
,galadhon,2013-03-17T08:35Z,"thenoobish: TRUST YOURSELF!  (it's on iMARS NFO)

vonepic:
winrar does not recognize 360 iso format.
It's a XGD3 iso, you need exiso compatible with XGD3 (exiso version 2.7.0)"
,vonepic,2013-03-17T13:31Z,"Yeah, I just realized that, my apologies - it apparently won't extract/ftp over right unless you convert the iso or use a newer extractor.

I was able to use ISO2GOD to convert it to a fixed image, and from there it was placed on using 360cm... But, the game was VERY slow (laggy) while loading a profile, and then froze both times I tried loading it at the menu.. Any thoughts on that? "
,pissme,2013-03-18T12:24Z,the question is! Someone already burned it up? It's working fine? Just want to know that!

,Smallz94,2013-03-19T23:34Z,I think I have to wait for P2P Gears of war judgment to be verify. This torrent was uploaded like a month ago

,Smallz94,2013-03-21T11:46Z,Idk what to do with this error. Besides I don't really like the game. I matter a fact just borrow this game from my friend so I can play campaign. The multiplayer online versus mode also gives that error when finishing a match

,ClipperCigars,2013-03-24T07:56Z,"Why the hell are people ""still"" using truncate and overburn garbage that does NOT work? All you are doing is ensuring CIV will fail, thus the errors.

C4E and Ixtreme told everyone back in October of 2011, yes a year and a half ago for Christs sakes, that it was an outdated method and won't work anymore. The ONLY proper way to burn XGD3 games is using a PC burner flashed with BurnerMax firmware (or as of late, the BurnerMax payload app for alternate drive types). "
,zer0sec,2013-03-25T07:58Z,"Good work Gh0stNet. I wonder why no one posts the real scene release nfos here when adding a torrent? Gotta love them! Good info cause people might request one or the other additional upload ;)

There are several Judgement releases available:
