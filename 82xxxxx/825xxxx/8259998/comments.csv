,uheardmebitch,2013-03-16T05:13Z,the uploader has given you bucketloads of information you don't need to try and distract you from the one thing you might need to know. IT'S NOT IN ENGLISH
,W1F1Rex,2013-03-16T06:09Z,"yup they need a PB for bollywood and for the rest of Asia. I wish I could relate, but sadly I can't."
,UGotJosed,2013-03-16T06:18Z,"@uheardmebitch
Perhaps thats has to do with the fact that it is a Korean movie? Knowing that, my first assumption would be that they spoke Korean in it to. I see that you did not reach the same conclusion. "

M2 skip everything but the air combat scenes. in my opinion the story sucks"
,whnstn,2013-03-23T17:49Z,"yeah, cool shots of military hardware but the rest is models and cgi and silliness. Painfully awkward humor. If this is how South Korean military operates, we are doomed."
