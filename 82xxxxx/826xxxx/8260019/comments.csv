,nosTEAM,2013-03-15T16:10Z,@ Razzak18 - don't forget to post another comment after you have played this game 
,XakeFrost,2013-03-15T16:26Z,"Will download and check! Looks promising. 
I'll comment again after I install which might take a while seeing how my download speed is 256 KB/s)

Owch x_x"
,Machine4578,2013-03-15T16:29Z,its legit.. and I see you have my crack I posted on cs.rin.ru 2weeks ago :D
,XakeFrost,2013-03-15T16:32Z,"Sorry, I've given up. My download speed has an average of 12 B/s...

I might be patient but I'm not THAT patient."
,Machine4578,2013-03-15T16:39Z,there is also an update 1.01 out too
,Machine4578,2013-03-15T16:43Z,"I just noticed its not the crack I posted on cs.rin.ru... this crack is a cracked Uplay... the crack I posted goes directly in the game folder like the AC3 and GRFS crack from SKIDROW.. its just the trialsFMX.exe, Buddha.dll and orbit folder... much cleaner IMO!"

,DarthMond,2013-03-16T23:10Z,"Hello, I'm a HUGE P Bay lover/user/fan, but first time poster =/ Over these years, the P Bay community has been most helpful with posting comments, reviews, general help, etc.It's time I started returning the same.

I got the game working fine and hope this might help some people whom are not able to do so.

*I'm running win 7 ult*
1. Unrar file
2. Run ""setup"" (application file) from installer folder as admin. !! NOT !! the windows Installer file, as this is the  Japanese version.
3.copy-paste-replace crack content from ""crack"" folder to where you installed the game.
4.Run ""UplayInstaller"" (application file) as admin. from ""installer"" folder. - Trails Evolution Gold Edition/Installer/support/Uplay
5. BLOCK game from net.
6. you should now see a ""skidrow"" account on Uplay when you launch game and (fingers crossed) the game will run no probs...happy playing.


Hope it helps =)

My hat's off to the likes of nosTEAM, SKIDROWS and ALL the good people who put the time and effort in, to give us a quality package to ""try before you buy"" THANK YOU!!!

,DarthMond,2013-03-16T23:25Z,"P.S

A very enjoyable game...takes 1 min to know all the controls...takes ages to master those contols =/"
,projectdt,2013-03-17T04:38Z,"Okay I just finally got it to work on windows 8.

There was something wrong with the ""Installed_files"" text document. 

Install the game and copy everything except the ""installed_files"" text document from the crack folder into the ""Ubisoft Game Launcher"" folder in the C drive. 

Open up the ""installed_files"" text document in the Crack folder and change all the ""F"" letters corresponding to the hard drive to ""C"". After you change all of the letters to C copy the all of the text and paste it in the ""installed_files"" text document located in the ""Ubisoft Game Launcher"" folder.

launch the game from C:program filesubisofttrials evolution gold editiondatapacktrials FMX

this fixed it for me, hope it helps."

,pokerz,2013-03-17T15:54Z,"Hello, I have a problem with starting the game.

I tried to install the game with the instructions that were given by nosTEAM, and I also tried with the instructions that other users gave, but still I cant run the game.

When I try to start it with Uplay I get an error when I click on the Play button.
The error is: ""Unable to start the game. Please check that your game has been installed correctly...""
(The Uplay user is SkidRow)

When i try to start the game with trialsFMX.exe (as administrator) I get another error. This error is: ""The application has failed to start because its side-by-side configuration is incorrect. Please see the application event log or use the command-line sxstrace.exe tool for more detail.""

I would really appreciate if someone could help me fix this problem. 

Thank you."
,Machine4578,2013-03-17T17:03Z,"@pokerz

use the crack I posted.. and put it in the game folder.. run trialsFMX.exe and play!!
no need to mess with the actual Ubisoft Game Laucher files or folder.."
,Dave2110,2013-03-17T17:07Z,I installed once and messed it up so I tried to reinstall it but it won't uninstall now. Now when I run the installer it asks me to uninstall and then it says it can find the DLL:GameuxInstallerHelper and terminates the installer. Any ideas anyone?
,pokerz,2013-03-17T17:49Z,"@Machine4578

I reinstalled the game and extracted your crack into the game directory. Same thing happens, when I start trialsFMX.exe or Uplay."
,Machine4578,2013-03-17T18:04Z,"@pokerz

make sure you have installed the legit uplay.. as all of SKIDROW's uplay emu's need they reg entries just like SKIDROW's steam CEG emu needs the steam reg entries"

,-Roy-,2013-03-17T19:11Z,"OK guys listen up,

To run this game you will have to make sure every file in the Ubisoft Game Launcher folder is not read only. To change this, open the folder, ctrl-a and press properties. Here uncheck read-only. Next start the game using UbisoftGameLauncher.exe. Have fun!"
,HwRr1316,2013-03-17T20:05Z,"@Miatakias83
If you want to change the language, you have to reinstall the game. At the beginning of the installation set 英語 (english)


The game work perfectly. Thanks a lot.
Run setup.exe from Installer folder. 
Select 英语 for english language. 
Then copy all files from crack folder into Ubisoft Ubisoft Game Launcher and overwrite all files. Run UbisoftTrials Evolution Gold EditiondatapacktrialsFMX.exe
Uplay starts in offline mode. 
Then click on Play and thats all.
I hope this helps.
Sorry for my English, I'm from Czech Republic.

,CptDew1592,2013-03-17T21:38Z,you solved my problem roy thx
,LStryker,2013-03-18T06:39Z,"Game works fine without problems at all. Just follow the instructions and make sure you uninstall any version of Uplay you have and install it again with the installer provided.
However, there is something that you might want to consider:
-Uplay won't be closed when you're playing. Means if you are using a low-end PC, you'll lag.

I verified the game myself. Expect nosTEAM to release another version since he said ""official game is not released yet - some features are not available in game (yet)   but you can enjoy the game earlier :)"" "
,Miatakias83,2013-03-18T15:07Z,great thanks to HwRr1316 i did what he said and it works fine at least in windows 7 x64 follow the in structions of HwRr1316 to play guys.greetings from greece man     *liberation to arma 3 czech developers that are in greek prison... :)

,LStryker,2013-03-21T14:43Z,"@endpoint122, for the crack, you can find it in the game's Crack folder. You need to paste it inside your Uplay/Ubisoft Game Launcher folder, make sure you installed the version provided by nosTEAM in Installer/Support/Uplay."
,bronsongotn,2013-03-21T23:53Z,"Works great,the insatllation was a little tricky but all instructions you need is in  the comments above...you can change to english language of course,and its playable on win7 32bit.If you have two different drives(c and d)like me,the ubisoft folder will be anyway on C:drive if you installed the game on the D:drive!Like i said it's tricky! :)"
