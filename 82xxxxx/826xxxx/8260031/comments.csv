[V],psspss,2013-03-16T03:52Z,"too risky to do that.. since here net is expensive and most people have like 10-30gb caps lol

only 2 neighbors in range have wifi on with psk2 and no wps"
,q2323,2013-03-16T22:06Z,"very good series. thanks :)
where do you live psspss? we have no limits here in europe. 100mbit connection costs me about 20 dollars"
[V],psspss,2013-03-17T00:32Z,somewhere at the bottom of the world near aussie
