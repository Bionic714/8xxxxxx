No slang-worthy subject is too taboo for this collection of more than 15,000 definitions of words that allude to drugs, sports, contemporary society, and a seemingly unending supply of slang terms for sex and bodily functions. Fully revised and expanded, and with lively examples of usage throughout, this up-to-the-minute reference paints a vivid picture of our cultural and social preoccupations while bringing intriguing examples of eccentricity and irreverence back to the linguistic frontline.
