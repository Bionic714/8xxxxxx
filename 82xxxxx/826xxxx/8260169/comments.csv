,antiseed,2013-03-16T08:38Z,"""Plot: N/A"" - I think that pretty much goes for most horror movies...

furthermore, is it just me or have there been a lot of leaked horror movies lately?"

,imrank89,2013-03-16T12:01Z,"'A Resurrection' is the story of a down to earth high school psychologist who tries to help amentally ill student who actually believes his brother is returning from the grave for revenge on the students who killed him. He's a tough egg to crack and as he slowly feeds her clues into his brother's mysterious death, she has her sheriff's deputy fiance verify the less than believable and vague information. And before she can get his mind right, she unwittingly falls into his plot to keep her and the other students locked in the school until his brother can arrive at six along with the evil spirit that now inhabits him, keeping him alive until he can take his six souls and leave him whole again."

,uheardmebitch,2013-03-17T15:32Z,this was awful. why didn't he just tell the cops who it was when his brother got run over?? and why did they just stay at the school. if ur mildly retarded this movie will do fine. audio and video are good

,DrMD,2013-03-18T15:17Z,While the A/V is good the movie isn't with every victim doing the utmost to be victims and the lead guy from Final Destination looking old and worn out. I guess if there's nothing else on and instead of being waterboarded you could watch this.
,EmKeL,2013-03-19T19:17Z,"Not called ""The Resurrestion""..it's called ""The Siblings""...
It was an alright movie..
