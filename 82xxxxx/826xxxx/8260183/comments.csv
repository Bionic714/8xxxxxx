Do you check these files before you upload? the last 3/4 files I've got from you were fucked.

Thanks for the effort but its wasted if the games are unwatchable"

[V],Nepotu,2013-03-16T14:03Z,"I'm sorry for wasting your time downloading my files. It's practically impossible to download and check every game I upload here (30 or more every day). You waste your time watching from time to time a not that good unchecked video, but I don't waste my time every day searching and uploading for you 30+ videos for love. I have to work harder, no?"
,Bmack7263,2013-03-16T15:55Z,"I don't know where this sense of entitlement comes from but Nepotu  almost single handed is keeping these American football ,euro football, NCAA, NBA, NHL, and a lot more alive on TPB.

He has loaded thousands of sporting events. When he gets tired or insulted enough  and stops we will have to go back to Dr No or Survivor or the view .

Show a little respect. Nepotu deserves it and a lot more.

FYI VLC only."
