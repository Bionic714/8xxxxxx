,Bean-Bandit,2013-03-16T06:50Z,Do these serial numbers work? The last 2013 one I had the numbers were blacklisted and it became a trail version.

,awudu,2013-03-18T20:50Z,"I installed the x64 version but when I look at my processes in 'Task manager"" on Windows 7 x64, it says ""avgui.exe *32""
I don't know why it shows as a 32bit application.
