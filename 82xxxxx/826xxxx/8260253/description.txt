This book is more than a "How to" book. It is first of all an instructional method of building something tangible to keep out the cold weather, It is moreover a project to help any person become more self reliant and independent and an excellent project to help a person feel more productive and useful. I listed this book in the depression category because this kind of practical experience allows any person the chance to build something not only of practical value but something of aesthetic value as well. This kind of project can help any person feel more productive and useful.
