,Jordanlane,2013-03-16T18:32Z,What is a good PS3 emulator?
,stenku,2013-03-16T20:51Z,hey guys how to run the game when i chose a kh1 it returns me to xmb
,bropaps,2013-03-17T05:11Z,ok! thanks for the torrent and the heads up thenoobish!
,x3angel,2013-03-18T01:31Z,@Jordanlane at this time there is no PS3 emulator available to run actual PS3 games but google & keep your eye on rpcs3 which is an open source PlayStation 3 (PS3) emulator for the Microsoft Windows. Current versions can run only small homebrew for PS3. Developers are planning to make it to emulate PS3 on its speed in the near future.

,justinewinthrow,2013-03-29T23:13Z,I seem to have the same problem as stenku I installed the game on my ps3 and I get to the screen with 3 choices the first 2 on the left I just get kicked back to the xmb the last on the right is just showing me the 358/2 days vid clips I guess that is all it is and that is all I seem to be able to access. Any info would be great.

2. Copied from External NTFS to PS3 internal via multiman
3. Selected the game
4. selected the game from XMB
5. set the game screen with circle
6. Selected the game i wanted with ""O"" instead of ""X""
7. Pressed ""O"" again
