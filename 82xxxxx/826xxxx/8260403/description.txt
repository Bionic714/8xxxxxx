The fishing boat Matthildur, comes to the small town where the 18-year-old Ingalo lives with her parents and younger brother. A brawl breaks out between the townspeople and the crew from Matthildur. As a consequence Ingalo leaves home.

Ingaló is helping her father on his small fishing boat, but he's an obstinate character and relations between them are tense. After a dance in the village which ends in a fight between the local people and crew of Matthildur ÍS 167, a visiting fishing boat, Ingaló and her younger brother leave home. Ingaló stays briefly in Reykjavík and has a short affair with Vilhjálmur, a man in his thirties. Sveinn has found a job on Matthildur and Ingaló is taken on as a cook. The fishing is poor and when the vessel breaks down it heads for home port, where the crew stays in derelict living quarters for seasonal workers. Ingaló finds out that Matthildur's owner and big wheel in town is none other than Vilhjálmur. Already mocked by the crew for being unable to cope with life at sea, Sveinn suffers absolute humiliation at the living quarters. Inagló is torn between her protective instincts towards Sveinn and her attraction towards Skúli, the chief engineer on Matthildur. But Skúli himself has plenty of other things on his mind, among them the new local beauty queen.
