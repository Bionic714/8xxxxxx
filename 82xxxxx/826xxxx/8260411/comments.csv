It's called Jack the Giant Killer and it's a different movie. Check the imdb link in the info.

To the uploader: The image of this torrent belongs to a different movie, so you should change it."
,Amafule10,2013-03-15T21:20Z,"About the image: my mistake. The image is correct.
These people are good... They took the poster of the original blockbuster movie and just changed the text to ""Giant Killer"" instead of ""Giant Slayer""."
,NikolaTesla1,2013-03-16T01:40Z,Good info. man! Fake movie!
,dynamo8899,2013-03-16T06:05Z,"This upload is not fake, it's just a different movie. Just a clever ploy to make money off a major motion picture its not the first time either. Thanks scene for the upload , buy I'll wait for''Jack the giant Slayer''"

The image is actually incorrect. Jack the Giant Slayer was previously titled Jack the Giant Killer. The Asylum didn't change the poster to ""Killer""."
,streetra,2013-03-17T02:59Z,Great movie! Can you find the movie LUV starring Common? I cant find it anywhere.
,vegamax,2013-03-17T14:30Z,most of the time these movies exist well before their predecessors and are repackaged and released
