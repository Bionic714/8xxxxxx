YTCracker and Magitek have really done it this time. Not only have they unleashed a zombie queen, it's taken over the body of MC Router. Now it's up to the nation's nerds, robots, ninjas, pirates, and gangstas to step in and make things right. Run with Myf and High-C, a stoned-out odd couple, as they lead the fray, joined by a swarm of nerd rap celebrities. Can the merger of magic, science, and music make a difference? Will Florida triumph over the bath salt apocalypse? Contains adult language and situations, and massive drug consumption. Don't say you weren't warned.
