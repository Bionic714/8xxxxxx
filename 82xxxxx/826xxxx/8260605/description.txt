A fake CBI/income tax officer calls a local police officer to assist in the raid of a politicianΓÇÖs residence. The income tax team comb the house and uncover black money worth lakhs hidden in the ceiling, inside a vintage car, under GodΓÇÖs statue, etc. The embarrassed politician sits through the entire drama while the officers seal and take away his money. The police are left to hold the fort till the team returns. Except that the team will not return. And there were no CBI/income tax officers to begin with! This is all part of Ajay Singh (Akshay Kumar), P. K. Sharma aka Sharmaji (Anupam Kher) and their friendsΓÇÖ con job. They pretend to be CBI/income tax officers and raid the houses of politicians and wealthy businessmen. Not only do they steal insane amounts of money with the help of the local police (without having to shell out a part for the cops), none of their grand thefts get reported as the politicians and businessmen do not want to speak about their black money in order to keep face.
