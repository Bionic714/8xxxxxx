This is a physics game I developed for mac, I would like to place this game on Appstore and GooglePlay however, its very expensive so here I give you free.

If you like the game or what it can become you can support itwith just 1 dollar, I dnt need $500 this is the minimum limit indiegogo sets. I actually  would be happy to get 99 persons to pledge $1 so i can at least get the IOS developer license.

Thank you and share with a friend if you can.
