,teetertv,2013-03-23T05:24Z,"Hey brotha, I have this on dvd mint quality chapters and menues and tons more of all kinds of bands the same way, I was trying to tell you a while back, but am trying to find a way other than letting everyone else know here. I tried to upload some here and cant figure it out. as per what burner/player to use and then folders and all that krazy shit. so its a bit confusing to me. I have the time but not the knowing. you would love the stuff I have. !! wish there was a way to email u direct. but don't know whom to trust as per typing it in here. "
