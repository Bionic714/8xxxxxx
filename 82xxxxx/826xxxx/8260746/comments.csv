,viggen6666,2013-03-18T22:49Z,"By far the best build of Windows XP on the net, please pay attention to the oem Info, to make sure it's really Maherz doing"
,Antraxy,2013-03-19T05:43Z,If this is by far the best Windows XP then why is there no WMP11 no .NET Frameworks and no Recovery Console?
,viggen6666,2013-03-19T23:58Z,"Because Maherz has giving the freedom of any user to do whatever he wants to, some people like wmp 11, others never install .net framework, if you get a Win XP Sp3, you will not get these programs embedded on it, so raw XP with no extras"
,Antraxy,2013-03-20T18:28Z,"@viggen6666

That's a cheap excuses, updating only half of the stuff makes no sense.

He doesn't include WMP11 and .NET Frameworks because there is no nLite addon out for it so he has to do an addon by himself. And the Recovery Console doesn't work because he doesn't know how to use the tool DriverPacks BASE correctly."
