,leo_star20,2013-03-19T03:54Z,"Hey there MsFenmore, 

Just wondering if you can up the quality of the episodes and not have as much compression? If not do you think you could let me know the name of your other source when you can't get the CBS recordings? I like watching the eps in higher quality on my tv and with the proper end credits on them.

I live in Australia and thank you for your uploads. If you can point me in the direction of where I can get the higher quality ones that would be great :D"
