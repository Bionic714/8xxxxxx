Journey to the Center of the Earth
Inspired by Jules Verne's novel of the same name, this made-for-cable documentary follows a group of scientists embarking upon a perilous journey toward the Earth's core Journey to the Center of the Earth video. The "actuality" footage of the members of the expedition exploring subterranean caves and the like are juxtaposed with dramatized excerpts from the Verne novel, neatly comparing fact with fiction (though truthfully, the "facts," backed up by state-of-the-art technology, are far more fascinating).
