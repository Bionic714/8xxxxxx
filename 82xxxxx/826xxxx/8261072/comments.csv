,84thewin,2013-03-16T22:25Z,pspxxx delivers once again! Thanks so much for taking the time and effort.
,pspxxx,2013-03-17T06:35Z,Well Time Team Lovers...Today is Sunday...its not a good one cause its the last program of the series 20...and the last Episode of Time Team...ever(?)..Ok a couple of specials planned for 2014..not the same... Minority TV suffers again. Now its the chance of National Geographic/Discovery to steal it away from C4...
,thatlife,2013-03-18T19:05Z,"Thanks so much with these episodes. Especially since you didn't get caught up in the Episode 5 - 'Warriors' shenanigans!

As someone with no avenue to this show, I really appreciate the time and effort and generosity shown by you and seeders.

On to the Specials!!"
,shokan85,2013-03-19T08:57Z,"Tim Taylor, Time Team's producer, is developing the concept for a show called Dig Village. They have a YouTube channel."
,hubbabubba544,2013-03-21T22:47Z,"PPX, no there is one more episode left
that will be aired on Sunday."
,pspxxx,2013-03-22T20:24Z,Yes its a compilation of the 20 years they were on air....I'm just glad to have been able to get all the seasons and specials etc
