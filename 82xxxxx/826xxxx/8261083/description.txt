VMware Fusion is a software hypervisor developed by VMware for
Macintosh computers with Intel processors. Fusion allows Intel-
based Macs to run operating systems, such as Microsoft Windows,
Linux, NetWare or Solaris on virtual machines, along with their
Mac OS X operating system using a combination of
paravirtualization, hardware virtualization and dynamic
recompilation.

VMware Fusion 5 has been revamped to take advantage of new
technologies only available in Mountain Lion, Windows 8 and the
latest Macs to deliver a Windows on Mac experience never seen
before.
