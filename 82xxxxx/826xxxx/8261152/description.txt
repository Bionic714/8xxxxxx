Italian filmmaker Tinto Brass has received thousands of unsolicited letters, photos, and videos from female fans over the years, all recounting their most intimate sexual fantasies. In P.O. BOX TINTO BRASS, he reveals many of these exciting and explicit tales of desire on film, giving the viewer plenty of beautiful girls in sensual situations

A fast moving and varied account supposedly of female sexual fantasies but in fact revealing more of the longings and desires of the films director as portrayed by Tinto Brass. The style seems to vary between each episode and also seems to be filmed in a variety of period styles and fashions. Although made in 1995 it often has the feel of a period movie. Nevertheless entertaining and rewarding.
