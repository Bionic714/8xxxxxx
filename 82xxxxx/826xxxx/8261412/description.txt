Compliant with Xbox360/PS3/iPads/Mobile Devices/etc. devices that require the primary Audio stream to be AAC Stereo (many do not accept/work with AAC 5.1 format). Audio Stream 2 available to those that also wish to experience great 5.1 sound that goes right alongside great picture quality.

For those experiencing LOW VOLUME issues, try to playback the 2nd Audio stream in stereo mode, this should improve audio quality and increase the volume substantially.

If you wish to experience 5.1 audio on the original PS3 or Newer PS3, Just select the audio options and ensure the 5.1 stream/track is selected.

PC Users will have to use something like VLC that allows you to choose the 2nd Audio stream/track, Depending on your configuration, vlc should automatically enable 5.1 playback after the track change, but double check by selecting AUDIO ~ Audio Device ~ 5.1

Judas's Note:

This bluray has some interesting aspect ratio changes at the start of the movie. No it isn't my encode being messed up... it's how it was formatted on the bluray... the encoded material is identical to the way the bluray plays too. So don't worry ;)

I'd also like to point out that the bluray has totally crap video quality to begin with.... the encoded result is actually pretty much spot on. Just another example of a bad transfer to bluray.
