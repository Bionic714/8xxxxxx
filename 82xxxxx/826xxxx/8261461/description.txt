Second album from tech-house german duo Booka Shade from 2006.
Imho, axcellent album. I love every single track. That good that i decided to make my first torrent out of it.

I collected all the files from the internet and then uploaded them.
(files are in greater sizes, so they got to be better. :P )

note: mandarin girl has lower volume, don't know why.
note2: night falls is bit longer than original album version,but essentially the same. ;)

Enjoy.

Seed!
