,PBRipsaw,2013-04-11T15:00Z,"I just really want to thank you _SnakEye for uploading so much great stuff. You've single-handedly increased my enjoyment of FSX at least tenfold by now. You're awesome!

By the way, do you (or anyone else) know what's going on with JustFlight's Air Hauler? For me it's probably the single most important addon out there, yet there aren't any working cracks around for any service pack since version 3.3 (it's up to 4.1 since the 7th of June 2011) Surely I'm not alone in enjoying this piece of software?"
