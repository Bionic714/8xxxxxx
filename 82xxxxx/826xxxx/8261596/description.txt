 Created by the undisputed master of city scenery, Andras Kozma, this Manhattan X scenery is a direct successor of the very successful and award winning Manhattan scenery for FS2004.

Instead of trying to update that one the whole projects was redone using new standards to ensure it would be fast enough to be usable. Almost double the amount of buildings and using all new effects of FSX, Manhattan X sets new standards. Designed with helicopters in mind, the scenery can also be explored with small aircrafts or ships. Even if you like to fly large aircraft you`ll enjoy the views when you approach the nearby airports. FSX deserves Manhattan X !
