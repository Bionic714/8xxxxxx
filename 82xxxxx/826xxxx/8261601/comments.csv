,Rethur52,2013-03-16T00:52Z,You're the best noobish :)
,BoneMonkey,2013-03-16T01:19Z,XGD2?
,AoF,2013-03-16T01:46Z,5.99 GB? I trust the uploader but was curious to the file size since xbox 360 games are usually 7.29 GB+
,greg1972sg,2013-03-16T02:01Z,GOOD MY FRIEND THANKS BRASIL
,Rethur52,2013-03-16T02:11Z,Have you seen the quality of the game and who it's made by? You shouldn't really expect a large while size with this one or a decent game.
,Rethur52,2013-03-16T02:30Z,"Works great, looking at the title screen right now."
,Predator_xxx,2013-03-16T02:59Z,"Guys,its 5.99 cause its unrared.Unrar it and u will see the actual size and iso..."
,Lookin4Twinkies,2013-03-16T03:06Z,"I'm Downloading it right now, Do you think ill be banned for playing early? On Halo 4 Everyone who played early got banned. "
,Lookin4Twinkies,2013-03-16T03:07Z,@BoneMonkey Yes!
,aoptongsf,2013-03-16T08:45Z,"@Lookin4Twinkies, if you have to even ask that, you shouldnt own a modded xbox. tired of noob questions on every torrent!"
,mmapig,2013-03-16T09:57Z,Same shit as the first WD? Or maybe playable this time?
,ricky81,2013-03-16T10:42Z,obrigado pelo upload the noobish sempre o melhor. thanks man your the best .
,lyssavoid,2013-03-16T15:12Z,"This is my first download where all the files did not come out to be winrar files, Just to be safe how should i extract them because half of them are R##  (like R50, R51, etc..) files. Do I still just highlight them all and do an extraction? and whats the SFV file at the end? Do i extract that to? thanks"
,ONEmar,2013-03-16T15:49Z,"lyssavoid//

Just click the 1:st Rar-file and ""extract here"" and you should get the Iso and Dvd-file!"
,YungLyfe,2013-03-16T19:18Z,this game is not working for me it download and everthing but when i need to put it on iso2god to covert it i cant find it 
,Lookin4Twinkies,2013-03-16T19:21Z,@aoptongsf I was just wondering because everyone played Call of Duty Early so don't get a big dick :)
,lyssavoid,2013-03-16T20:15Z,"ONEmar//

Oh ok thanks! I just wanted to make sure so I don't end up burning a bad disc. And last question, is the reason why ABGx wont run the full stealth patch is because it's not online yet? I don't want to play it before its out, im just wondering why ABGx wont run it fully through. I also have the same problem when i try to do GOW: Judgement "
,fanfasnight,2013-03-16T20:24Z,"Very wierd...the game plays well the first part until i get in the car but then on the first load it gives disk unreadable , and im using xk3y never happend before in any game "
,AoF,2013-03-16T22:29Z,"This game is awesome, I see replay value here if they have co-op."
,5thel,2013-03-16T23:58Z,"5 burns 5 coasters..tried verbatims, memorex, Ihas, non Ihas..one got disc unrecognized, next 4 nonstop bad sectors. 1 disc left in my pack hoping someone got this working and can explain how. I've only experienced this with one imars release ever besides this one."
,quinnarty,2013-03-17T05:32Z,"Using ImgBurn to create backups of games you already own:
Dual Layer DVD ( Verbatim Brand )
iHas B DL DVD Burner

For those of you creating backup games,
XGD2 Games LayerBreak = 1913760
XGD3 Games LayerBreak = 2133520
Open your .dvd file in notepad and make sure that the layer break is set for either 1913760 or 2133520 depending on if the game is XGD2 or XGD3. 
To check to see which your game is, visit the XDG3 Website and search your game. 
If it has a Wave Number next to it, burn with XGD2 Layerbreak. 
If it says XGD3 next to it, burn with XGD3 Layer Break. 
burn at 2.4x. 
Game is not safe to play until it is released and is uploaded to ABGX360s database.

I have a full guide if you want it.

@QuinnArtyKno on Twitter if you have any questions."
,GK2000,2013-03-17T06:05Z,"http://www.xk3y.com/ 
I own one, works amazing. no.more disks ever"
,5thel,2013-03-17T06:38Z,"@quinnarty I've done all that as stated I've been burning games since Xbox 1 but this only the second time I've had this issue. Sometimes during the writing process I get sci-ii errors sometimes I get bad sectors at the verify stage. I tried with out verified and it completed but get disc unrecognized when is pop the disc in the Xbox. I have an I has burner, same issue. Tried without I has same issues. Tried with verbatims and same issues. Tried with memorex and same issue. Maybe just maybe this a bad rip considering someone with an xkey had an issue too."
,fanfasnight,2013-03-17T08:17Z,I have downloaded the other version of walking dead no error with xk3y anymore. Never had any probem with thenobish until now. TY anyway
,quinnarty,2013-03-17T15:38Z,"@5thel I'll let you know how I end up burning it i've never had a bad burn except for accidentally using the wrong layerbreak (xdg2 on xdg3,etc). I'll burn this as soon as it is released and let you know if its good."
,ONEmar,2013-03-17T17:39Z,"lyssavoid//

Both this and GOW is not out yet, therefore ABGX can´t patch them yet!"
,quinnarty,2013-03-17T17:52Z,"Right now I'm lookin at the .dvd and .iso file. 
Both look perfect and just like the dozens of others we have.

Everything passes verification when run except the xex stealth patch which is to be expected until the game is actually released.

Ready to burn as soon as release date comes.

@QuinnArtyKno on twitter if you have any questions. "
,5thel,2013-03-17T19:32Z,@quinnarty I sent you a message on twitter last night. Got another 3 pack of discs this morning just ended up with another 3 coaster lol. Considering it's 8 burns on two different torrent files (I downloaded the other as well)..I am genuinely starting to think this is definitely a bad rip at its core. I did manage to find someone who got it to play but like the other person above me here he also had xkey. I've triple checked everything. I even just burned two xgd2 games and a xgd3 game with no issue last night for a buddy. This is the only one I can't burn.
,unholychild,2013-03-17T22:26Z,Everything works great for me. Burned one copy for my son and using mine on xkey. Both work great. Thanks thenoobish.
,quinnarty,2013-03-18T02:55Z,@5thel I never got a message on Twitter @QuinnArtyKno if you message me i'll send u images of what all I've got and see what's different. As for now you might wanna try to redownload re-extract and rerun throught ABGX360 let me know what you find out I'll be burning it in 2 days on the 19th since thats when it will be safe stealth on live. 
,quinnarty,2013-03-18T03:00Z,@5thel got ur message now
,nox234558,2013-03-18T19:08Z,i have question i have falshed my xbox 360 and i checked the game with abgx and some people say i need an kprobe but i dont play online i just do it offline and i never connected xbox to online so am i good when i patch with abgx and burn with imgburn btw i have  sony﻿ optiarc ad-5280s so i dont use ihas burner and some people said i dont need an payload tool so am i good to burn ? im noob so can somone pls help me tnx :D
,Lookin4Twinkies,2013-03-18T19:39Z,@nox234558 You do not need the special burner because this game is XGD2. You should be able to play online at midnight tonight. 
,5thel,2013-03-18T20:10Z,Well i'm glad others got it working..may be faulty media on my end. I've been reading that verbatim have been increasingly faulty depending which plant your discs originate from. Will try another brand in the next 24 hours hopefully that fixes it plus by then i can run it through abgx.
,nox234558,2013-03-18T21:27Z,ty for answer do i need some special settings for abgx or should i just put on default with level 3 ? 
,Coliosis,2013-03-18T23:32Z,I hate to be the douche to ask this but can someone show me a how to for xbox burning? Thanx
,llFarQM8ll,2013-03-19T00:04Z,"Works fine on my rgh/jtag, they game itself is crap though."
,Smallz94,2013-03-19T00:32Z,"@Coliosis

I dont know what you mean but i am guessing you need help how to burn xbox 360 games. just search on youtube."
,Smallz94,2013-03-19T01:54Z,just saying but there is no reason to wait until tomorrow and verify the game because it is not going to have online playing. Just single player mostly. I searched up on youtube if there is a multiplayer and found info saying there is not going to be online for this game so I am just going to burn it now and just play on my offline account. 
,jakenator,2013-03-19T06:16Z,"Just to let everyone know, this game blows.....bad. The graphics are beyond horrible, the controls are clunky, and the story pretty much consists of you risking your life to drive to supposed safe locations only to find it fucked up by zombies. And I usually like most games lol. But thanks anyway thenoobish."
,GK2000,2013-03-19T15:55Z,works perfect using xk3y
,Smallz94,2013-03-19T23:44Z,Works perfectly with truncate method without ihas burner. :) the game is not that bad but I think that walking dead arcade game or whatever was that previous was better than this game because of the story and great impact of suspense everywhere you go. 
,DJ_SEVEN,2013-03-20T22:44Z,"This game is so FUCKIN bad that even your controller gets some Zzzzz

The graphics from the amiga were alot better, this is pure crap!

The story is written by a fiveyearold, sorry, my bad, its Blasphemy twards children to print that, cause they are way, way smarter then these writer / cowriter DICKHEADS.

Im so glad i did not buy this shit

zombie @ the ok corall, NOT, you cant use a firearm, cause then ""they"" will hear you, hahaha so its up to you, your drunk brother and a trusty fuckin hunting knife to take on the army of Zzzzz and that worx well, NOT again.

Z for story
ZZ for graphics
Z for sound
-ZZZZZ for gameplay!!!!

fuck this shit, im going for Giana next!

Thanx to the uploader though."
,chusteczki,2013-03-21T00:47Z,"First time I've had a successful burn that turned out to be a coaster truly awful game I'm off to bang one out using 24grit sandpaper as its about as pleasant as playing this utter utter horse cr@p 



But thanks for the up noobish"
,xxdocxx,2013-03-21T10:45Z,@smallz94 excuse my ignorance here but I'm just wondering how do you truncate a xgd2 game disc. I thought that truncate was when cutting off the end of an xgd3 game disc which has a 1gb  size difference. This is an xdg2 game right. 
,quinnarty,2013-03-22T19:08Z,"Using ImgBurn to create backups of games you already own:
Dual Layer DVD ( Verbatim Brand )
iHas B DL DVD Burner
After downloading this torrent and extracting the files with 7-zip, you should have 2 files, a .iso, and a .dvd.

For those of you creating backup games,
XGD2 Games LayerBreak = 1913760
XGD3 Games LayerBreak = 2133520
Open your .dvd file in notepad and make sure that the layer break is set for either 1913760 or 2133520 depending on if the game is XGD2 or XGD3. 
To check to see which your game is, visit the XDG3 Website and search your game. 
If it has a Wave Number next to it, burn with XGD2 Layerbreak. 
If it says XGD3 next to it, burn with XGD3 Layer Break. 
Burn at 2.4x. 
You actually do not need an ihas burner to burn this particular game since it is XGD2, so you can burn with a normal DL DVD Burner.

@QuinnArtyKno on Twitter if you have any questions."
,xxdocxx,2013-03-23T02:06Z,"@quinnarty is there really any need to fool around with layer breaks. ABGX will do all of this . every game should be run through ABGX. if the dvd file is either wrong or missing, then ABGX will fix or create one for you. the layer break is in that dvd file which in turn is automatically programmed into image burn. I have never had to mess around with a layer break in imageburn while burning any 360 game. you can also put the iso in imageburn and it will create a proper .dvd file. I don't know why your messing around with the layer break when its done automatically."
,bobbers602,2013-03-24T00:55Z,"I must confess I am somewhat surprised.  

Today is March 23rd, and the game gets released next Tuesday, the 26th.

This download cleared abgx stealth patch today!"
,abdul86,2013-03-24T04:57Z,DMI is unverified
,xxdocxx,2013-03-24T14:42Z,"@abdul86 just use this guide from ABGX and your DMI will be verified



How to manually patch SSV2 files:

-Find your game on http://abgx360.net/verified.php (THE XEX CRC MUST MATCH)
-Click on the little blue number on the very far right (NOT the Title ID)
-Download a SS and DMI combination. It doesn't matter which as long as they are from the same row and the SS Version is 2

In Options:
-UN-check ""Verify if stealth passes""

In Manually Patch or Extract Files:
-Check ""Patch even if stealth passes""
-Check ""Patch DMI"" then load the DMI file 
-Check ""Patch SS"" then load the SS file

If you want to save these settings for future use, press Ctrl+S and name it ""SSV2 Patching"" or whatever.

-Click Launch. If done right it should say that the patching was successful. 
-You can skip the Game CRC check during this part if you want.

-After patching, run it again on regular settings and it should look normal."
,eliokdc,2013-03-25T10:05Z,"HELP !!
So here's the deal, i recently bought my xbox 360s PAL, modded LT3.0 i've downloaded some games, i learned how to burn them with patching using abgx360 GUI and img burn, but this game does not have .dvd and .iso files instead i have 68 files, so what should i do ? 
Thank you guys"
,xxdocxx,2013-03-25T15:34Z,@eliokdc unrar it using WinRAR or what ever. the filed is compressed. 
,eliokdc,2013-03-26T08:39Z,@xxdocxx OMFG Sorry for that stupid question :o Thank you anyway..
,Panagiotis_1992,2013-04-04T12:36Z,"THE GAME IS PERFECT!!!!THANK YOU VERY MUCH,WORKS PERFECTLY!!!"
,DarkAngel-xxx,2013-04-08T17:01Z,Boring game.
,galaxybay,2013-04-13T10:37Z,"i have lt2.0… and thus it’s a xgd2 game , do i have to insert a topology for lt2.0 with xbox backup creator or i dont have to …….?????? please reply . coz in xgd3 game i have to insert topology for lt2.0 in order to make the game work.................................... and yeah should i set layerbreak to calculate optimal ?"
,salazam1,2013-04-15T09:18Z,"Jesus fucking christ. Why do the comments on every single game lately look like goddamn tutorial for burning discs? Is google broken or something? Review the fucking game, report if it works or not and GTFO.
If you're having problems, read some fucking forums.

btw, thanks @DJ_SEVEN for confirming my suspicions that this game isn't even worth the d/l"
