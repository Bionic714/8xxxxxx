To transport the reader to the highest level of mathematical awareness and to acquaint him with outstanding mathematical achievements. The foremost of them all is the pluralization of mathematics, i.e.,where we had geometry, we now have geometries, and algebras rather than algebra, and number systems rather than number system. It is intended for the intelligent layman who is in search of short and pointed answers to his queries but is little inclined to undertake detai led study of mathematical ideas and concepts.
