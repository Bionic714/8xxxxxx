Summer of the Chew Toy Soul (2011) - Tristan Newcomb

Alcohol-fueled regret and Nintendo 64 ΓÇô a marriage made in anti-movie heaven.  This is a film dedicated to any poor lad of the last thirty years who was unlucky enough to be that one miserable kid on the block without a video game console.  Or any Nintendo-loving child who suffered through the divorce of their parents by being tossed back-and-forth between their two separate residences like an old, stinky Nerf football that the dog chewed onΓÇªwhile their Nintendo console kept up its merrily oblivious song of Pikachuvian bliss.

But yet, from the point-of-view of the filmΓÇÖs functional-alcoholic father character, this movie is a riff on CamusΓÇÖ famous dictum: the only real philosophical problem is whether or not to commit suicide.  Once youΓÇÖve decided that particular issue, the rest of lifeΓÇÖs answers are, by comparison, simple.  The father just isnΓÇÖt quite up to making a firm decision on the suicide question.  Perhaps his Nintendo-loving son can assist him in making the wrong suicide choice for the right reasons?  Or is it the other way around?
