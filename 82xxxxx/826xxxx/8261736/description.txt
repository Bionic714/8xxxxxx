"The Fight"

Mike is surprisingly impressed with Ryan when they 
take Boyd to a baseball game and have a run-in with 
a tipsy Bill McKendree, who's been on a downward 
spiral ever since Mike failed to give him an Outdoor 
Man account. Meanwhile, when Mandy gets her laptop 
and cell phone taken away for failing history, she 
comes across Mike's old ham radio and starts some 
unlikely conversations with people from around the 
world.

Evolve... or die.

Enjoy :)
