Windows Home Server 2011, code named Vail, is a home server operating system by Microsoft designed for small office/home offices and homes with multiple connected PCs to offer protected file storage, file sharing, automated PC backup, remote access, and remote control of PC desktops. It was released on 6 April 2011following the release of Power Pack 3 for its aging predecessor Windows Home Server. Microsoft has announced that Windows Home Server 2011 will be the last Windows Home Server release. Windows Home Server will be succeeded by Windows Server 2012 Essentials.

Windows Home Server 2011 is based on Windows Server 2008 R2 and therefore only supports x86-64 (64-bit) hardware. This is significant, since the preceding Windows Home Server v1 was 32-bit. Coupled with fundamental changes in the structure of the client backups and the shared folders, there was no clear method for migrating from WHS version 1 to WHS 2011.
