"The Life We've Chosen"

AMANDA CAPTURES ALEX - Amanda holds 
Alex hostage and tells Nikita she will 
release Alex in exchange for Ari. 
Michael assigns Nikita and Sean to 
handle the exchange of prisoners, but 
Ryan adds Owen to the team at the last 
minute, which makes Michael 
suspicious. While in captivity, Alex 
befriends a fellow prisoner named 
Larissa and vows to break them both 
out of the jail, which ultimately 
conflicts with Nikita's plan, forcing 
Alex to choose between Nikita and her 
promise to Larissa.
