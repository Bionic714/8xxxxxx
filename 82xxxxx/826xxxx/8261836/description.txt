"New Plans"

Reba thinks her music career is about to take 
off when she finally gets to meet Mr. Bata in 
person, but her hopes take a hit when she 
learns that he wants her to write commercial 
jingles. Meanwhile, Sage changes his mind 
about applying to Stanford because he doesn't 
want to be away from June, and he's decided 
to pursue a music career.

18/Slower+
Evolve... or die.

Enjoy :)
