By far my favorite Tool album but unfortunately the CD is recorded like shit.  Ive downloaded many fan versions of the album that have been dithered around in an attempt to squeeze out better sound.  None of them, for me, were much better than the crappy sounding original CD. I found different vinyl versions and they were an improvement in sound but plagued with table setup issues resulting in fluctuations in speed.  Not good. So I decided to buy a vinyl copy and invest the time to record it myself. 

Finally I hear Dannys complex drumming more realistically and the decay of his cymbols fades naturally.  Justins bass lines dont disappear, Adams guitar is more immediate and vicious. Everything is easier to sort out and just.... better.  

Hope you enjoy.
