,jjoosshhy,2013-03-21T04:21Z,Works perfectly! Thank you so much!
,fernav71,2013-03-24T13:42Z,Does not work. Everytime I want to go to a web it redirects to a trial page (which is blocked following your instructions) so it's impossible to navigate :(
,msftdoll,2013-03-29T21:03Z,It worked! Thank you so much
,fnog,2013-03-30T04:36Z,"Trojan Agent, Isn't needed to make this work properly. Just make sure to delete the trojan before you run the program and it should be fine.  "
,lilmagi,2013-04-01T02:29Z,as @fernav71 said. It DOESN'T work. Keeps redirecting to a trial page (that is blocked by hosts).
,xk3nvel0x,2013-04-10T22:30Z,"fuck it... everytime i get this: http://img138.imageshack.us/img138/6392/hselite.png

I re-install it and re-use your steps but nothing... please give me a solution :) i will really appreciate all your tips :)."
,xk3nvel0x,2013-04-11T16:09Z,"I found a solution that worked for me :)
So:

1) Install hselite and do not open right now
2) Paste the hosts
3) Now run & connect it
4) Open a browser page and open 2 pages (e.g. google and youtube) to determinate the hotspot shield to redirect you to trial period activation. Now close the browser. I know it sound so stupid, but for me works. You need to do it to avoid: http://img138.imageshack.us/img138/6392/hselite.png
5) Now restart your pc
6) Open browser and download an ad block (for firefox i suggest ad block plus and ad block for google chrome, just google it ad block plus or open chrome store if you using google chrome)
7) Now run hselite & connect, ad block will block the ad content which redirect you to trial period start page (sure blocked by hosts file, but the page will be open as offline)
8) Enjoy it :) and sorry for my bad english :D

Hope work for you too !"
,fernav71,2013-04-14T19:50Z,"Instead of this useless crap you can use the free version, joint with a program called ""Adblock Plus"" 
Note: this is for Firefox, for IE or chrome I read there are some similar, just search for on google :D"
,fernav71,2013-04-14T19:54Z,"@xk3nvel0x : I didn't read you spoked about the Adblock above, but you can save time using the free version, not this useless trash. the effect it's the same and results faster ;)"
