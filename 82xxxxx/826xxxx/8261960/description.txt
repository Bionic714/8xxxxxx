GAME NOTES:
~~~~~~~~~~
One island.  Three races.  The place isn't big enough for all of them.

The sexy Sea Reapers use magic and cunning to their advantage in their
attempts to rid the island of the other races.  Kabuto, the "lumbering
mountain of pain" uses only brute force and raw savagery in combat.
Finally, the clever Meccs have as their ally technological advances
beyond the imagination which they use to defend themselves and in their
efforts to claim the island as their own.

Giants brings together real-time-strategy and action gaming elements in
a mix nobody has ever seen before.  The gorgeous graphics and depth of
gameplay are sure to make this title a smash hit for the holidays.
