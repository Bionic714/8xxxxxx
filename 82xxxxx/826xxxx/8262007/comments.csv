,BoonesFerry,2013-03-16T08:48Z,"Undercover Boss & CBS did it again...they made another schedule change.
Tonight was supposed to be a new episode, 4x12 -- ADT, but instead, they
aired a repeat of 4x02 -- Tilted Kilt (which originally aired on Nov 09, 2012)
Apparently LMAO & AFG were not aware of the schedule change.

New schedule:

4x11 -- Mar 08, 2013 -- Squaw Valley
Break
4x12 -- Apr 05, 2013 -- Fatburger
4x13 -- Apr 12, 2013 -- ADT"
,keithandrews,2013-03-16T21:36Z,I hate it when they change the schedule of undercover boss and wish they would have at least 20 episode season with less breaks.
