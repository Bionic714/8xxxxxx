"Ghosts"

During a rare rainy Los Angeles 
evening, Martin and Jake head to 
Breakwire to enlist the help of his 
old friend Dutch (guest star Keith 
David), a grizzled ex-Navy Seal. When 
the lights go out in the building, 
the storm is suspected, but all hell 
breaks loose when Guillermo enters 
the premises. As the intensity 
ratchets up and people turn up dead, 
Jake's ability to communicate with 
Amelia proves to be critical in 
defending his life

Evolve... or die.

Enjoy :)
