Thanks for the ul!"
,wetbeak,2013-03-16T04:34Z,"thank you. probably bored with requests but i am searching for something frank quitely did for a star wars story, do you know of any?"
,tedsclai,2013-03-16T08:48Z,FYI to those interested. Byrne stated in an interview that his The High Ways mini takes place in the same universe as Next Men and he is working on even more Next Men issues to come.
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-16T13:56Z,"yeah, the high ways is very good as well! i actually like it more, since it wasn't (somewhat) mired in 20 years of continuity"
,binderguy1,2013-03-16T15:37Z,"FYI, John Byrne wrote two paperbacks novels; Fearbook & The Whipping Boy.  The latter has characters that showed up in JBNM.

Talk about 6 degrees of separation! 

More NEXT MEN?!  Thought he was all done with it."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-16T23:13Z,"That guy's old and he probably has a good deal at IDW since it's creator owned. Sadly this is the only creator owned project he's had success with in what --- 35 years? Byrne says truly ignorant shit online but I feel bad for him, jerry or way, et all, when goobers like liefeld and Millar have been more successful in creator owned projects!"
,Oneiromancer12,2013-03-17T05:11Z,"Almighty STFmaryville, were you able to get The Spectre?"
,tedsclai,2013-03-17T09:31Z,STFmaryville if u ever come across DC Comics Presents: Brightest Day #1-3 would u please post them. I have searched for them and can't find them anywhere. Apologize if I have asked this before. Can't recall. Thanks for all that you do and just being awesome in general.
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-17T13:39Z,"Oneiromancer12, i am pleased to say that although i forgot all about spectre (and which one you wanted, the 80s volume or the 90s volume), the whole series is right here: http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/4915008/The_Spectre"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-17T14:46Z,"tedsclai, unfortunately i still can't find dc comics presents brightest day. i have doubts that they have ever been scanned... sometimes all-reprint comics like those are passed over by the scan groups."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-17T18:35Z,"here are the individual (original) issues of next men #0-30, thanks to our friend tedsclai!

[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-17T20:39Z,"wetbeak, as far as i have been able to find, the frank quitely star wars work was what i would call a pin-up in an art book from 2011 called ""star wars art: comics"" -- and for the life of me, i can't find a .cbr or .pdf of it!"
,BringThatBooty,2013-03-18T00:55Z,"STF, could you find Thunderbolts for me? I can't find the complete series anywhere."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-18T03:15Z,"BringThatBooty, sure. lotta comics to download before i can get all of them into one torrent. check back in a day or two!"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-19T22:33Z,"BringThatBooty, here ya go: http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8276762/"
