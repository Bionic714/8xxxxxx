The only WWE type DVD's I have bought recently is this:  WWE The Best of WCW Nitro Vol 2 BluRay which I have converted to mp4 and mkv. 

Would you like me to release it as: WWE The Best Of WCW Monday Nitro Vol. 2 (2013) x264 BDRip-SC-SDH ??? 

It is not in 1280 x 720p HD but it is 720x406 which is 16x9 DVD quality video with 5.1 AC3 Dolby Digital audio as the original WCW Nitro TV show video was only shot in SD video. I will only release it IF I see at least 15 comments here asking for it by Saturday Night @ 18:00 or 6:00 pm my time which is about 18 hours from now. So All you old school WCW fans speak up now or it will remain unreleased by me. Also the release would be 6.95 GB in 3 high quality mp4 or mkv video files. Which would you people prefer it in mp4 or mkv? Please leave a comment below with your answer wrestling fans."
