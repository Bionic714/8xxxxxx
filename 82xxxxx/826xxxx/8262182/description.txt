The first 5 albums from Sweatshop Union. 

The files are in "ogg vorbis" format because I prefer them over mp3s, as vorbis files are patent free and open-source and can produce sound just as good at smaller sizes than the patented mp3 format.

Some may complain that it is inconvenient as most (cheap) music players do not support the format. If you really want a portable music player that supports ogg vorbis, I would suggest the "Sansa Clip +" or the "Sansa Zip Clip." They are both really cheap and support various formats, they can also be "hacked" to play the Rockbox firmware which is pretty awesome in my opinion.

All files have been encoded from flac into 'ogg vorbis,' at the "q5" level encoding as that is the agreed upon value at Hydrogenaudio.org that achieves transparency. Meaning the average ear cannot tell the difference between these and the original cd (unless perhaps you are blasting them on speakers across your house or something).

I decided to upload these as an alternative to the flac uploads I've put up, as not everyone has the download speed or the bandwidth to spare.       

Note: Natural Progression has not been uploaded in it's flac format, just yet.
