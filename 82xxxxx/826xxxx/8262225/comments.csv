,ryballs,2013-03-16T15:16Z,Really? That's great! Thanks for the info. :D
,ctgg,2013-03-16T17:07Z,"Yes, but obviously, you need X11/XQuartz installed. Tested on iMac 7,1 with 10.6.3 and MBA 3,2 with 10.6.8."

Because it's exactly the same OS, except the fucking Mac App Store/Sandbox/Trojan removal and the, oh yeah! fullscreen awesome feature for most applications or games. It is not the place for this troll, is it ?"
