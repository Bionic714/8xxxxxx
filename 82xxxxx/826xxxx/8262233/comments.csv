,pro346pro,2013-03-18T00:50Z,Thanks been looking for this ! Shouldn't be too long and you should get a skull!
,jalucian,2013-03-21T22:12Z,That's what I'm hoping for! I'm trying to target movies that aren't well represented in small file sizes. Let me know if there's something specific you'd like done and I'll do my best to hook it up for ya.
,stvgl,2013-03-23T03:05Z,"Thanks a lot but why did you go for such a low bitrate? I know it's an oldie so bitrate plays a more minor role but still, it's a bit too low for my liking."
,stvgl,2013-03-23T03:13Z,"Also, I'd like to note that you shouldn't be too fixated on keeping the bitrate constant. If you compare something with extremely high action (like Unstoppable) with something that has ample brightness and slow scenes like Sideways - to get comparable quality they'd have entirely different bitrates."
,jalucian,2013-03-26T23:41Z,"Because 750-875 is all you need to keep the picture looking perfect on a computer-sized monitor. Your comment suggests that you didn't read the notes in the description, which explains exactly what you're asking. It states that my bitrates are optimized for those watching on computers, not large TV's. Also, the bitrate is not constant. It's variable bit rate using 2-pass encoding. The number listed is just the average bitrate. I round up to 900 to make sure that ALL movies look perfect on the intended size screen. Picking one bitrate that's high enough for even the most high-action films is simply easier than going through all the trouble of testing to see how low I can make the bitrate without compromising quality. The only reason my bitrates would be ""too low for your liking"" is if you're attempting to watch on a screen that's larger than my intended audience (computer viewers), or you simply have an arbitrary number in your head. There is zero pixelation when you view my encodes on regular sized monitors, and in fact, I've even heard that they look fine on larger screens - I just don't guarantee that. My bitrates are actually 10-20% higher than YIFY's, who is well known for his quality. In short, the only reason my bitrates wouldn't be high enough is if you're trying to watch on a large screen...which means you didn't read the notes."
,jalucian,2013-03-26T23:48Z,"Actually I rounded up to 1000 in this case, not 900, but 900 would have been more than enough with variable 2-pass. Perhaps I'll put the word ""average"" and ""variable"" in the stats to eliminate confusion. 

1800-1900kbps is plenty for high action films in 1080p on small monitors and on 1080's I round up to 2000. The bitrate equivalent to 2000 in 1080p in 720p resolution is 889kbps, which is why I usually go with 900kbps. Hope this answers your question."
,highresjunkie,2013-03-27T05:22Z,"Yep. People don't seem to realize that bitrates are entirely dependent and relative to screen size, and Jalucian is right. With a 720p, a video bitrate of 850-900 is all you need to look perfect on any monitor up to 21"" (I know this for a fact), and would probably still look perfect up to 27"" or so."
,jalucian,2013-03-30T02:55Z,"stvgl, If you'll look at my most recent torrents, I have changed the notes section (as I said I might) to reflect the fact that I use multi-pass variable bitrate encoding, not constant, and that my bitrates listed are just the overall avg bitrate."
,stvgl,2013-03-30T06:47Z,"I read the notes and understand all what you said. I'm using a 22"" monitor to watch movies and there's a world of difference between 1000kbps and 2000kbps, so what highresjunkie said about it being perfect on screens this size - simply not true. I suppose for people using laptop screens (up to 17"") for movies this is perfect.

While your bitrates are not constant, you do stick to one average bitrate for all movies, you said that it's the best way to go but it really is not as in real picture terms you will get very large differences in quality. You can ask about this in any professional video encoding forum.
Pixelation shouldn't occur anyway with h264 unless you encode with mobile profiles. It also makes sense to test by pausing the movie and look at the level of detail on faces in slow close-up shots. For the average movies, the sweet spot seems to be around 1800-2200 kbps for up to 27"" screens.

Yes, for the size it's good. Perhaps I just wanted a 1080p version type of encode like you used to do (Snatch was great, for example) with a higher bitrate."
,jalucian,2013-04-04T21:58Z,"Well using a bitrate of 890 (which I round to 900) gives the same quality for a 720p that 2000 gives for a 1080p, so there should be no difference at all in quality between my 720's and 1080's. In fact, the 720's should be ever-so-slightly better. The math bears this out:

1920 x 1080 = 2,073,600       [1080p]
1280 x 720   = 921,600          [720p]

2,073,600 / 921,600 = 2.25

As you can see, a 1080p has 2.25 times the pixels of a 720p, and if we take the bitrate of my 1080s and divide by 2.25 (2000 / 2.25 = 888.9) you can see that a bitrate of 900 for a 720p is actually slightly BETTER than using a 2000 bitrate for a 1080p. 

So if 2000 is the sweet spot for 1080s, then 900 should be the sweet spot for 720s. The math proves these should be equal. So I'm curious why you think that a 720 would need the same bitrate as a 1080 to have the same quality. It just doesn't work that way.

What brand and model is your screen, because I've had one person say that mine still look good on a 37"" screen and another say that Sneakers looked fine on a 50"" (that comment is still there if you want to look.) I'm not guaranteeing that mine will look good on a screen that large, but I do know for a fact that will look like they are supposed to on computer sized monitors, which should include your 22"". And I'm still puzzled that you think Snatch looked fine but one of my 720s didnt, since the math proves they should. Also, YIFY is well known for his quality, and his bitrates on 720's are actually slightly lower than mine by about 10-15% and my x264 settings are slightly more rigorous than his are, so I'm really curious about this.

Don't misunderstand me, I very much appreciate the input because I want to make mine as good as I possibly can and I can't do that without feedback. I'm just trying to figure out how what you're saying makes since in the face of the math and the visual testing and comparisons that I've done."
