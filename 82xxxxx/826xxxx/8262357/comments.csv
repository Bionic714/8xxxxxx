,KidAtomic,2013-03-16T11:01Z,Sounds like someone needs to get the K-lite codec pack. ettv is a trusted uploader.

,DNA216,2013-03-17T21:57Z,"@fredrickreed

you dont have the right codec, its not the file. ettv is a trusted uploader, never had a problem before. try d/l k-lite pack...or use a different player(gom, vlc, kmp...)

thanks for the up"
