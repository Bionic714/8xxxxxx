Contains Bendis' COMPLETE run on Avengers/New Avengers/Dark Avengers from 2004-2012. I've separated them into folders that makes for a very nice reading order, about 39 folders in all. Also includes all of Age of Ultron as of 3/15/13.

Also, while not written by Bendis, I've included the Dark Avengers/Uncanny X-Men crossover Utopia in the reading order. Also, whenever the Avengers books tied into another event not written by Bendis, I included the event as well.

Also included are other books by Bendis, including the start of his Marvel Now! X-Men Run

- Alias 1-28
- What If...Jessica Jones joined The Avengers?
- Daredevil: End of Days 1-6 (of 8)
- Daredevil: Ninja
- Daredevil v2 16-81(includes David Mack issues)
- Guardians of the Galaxy v3 0.1 
- Moon Knight v4 1-12
- Spider-Woman: Origin 1-6
- Spider-Woman: Agent of S.W.O.R.D. 1-7 
- The Pulse 1-14
- The Pulse House of M Special
- All-New X-Men 1-8
- Uncanny X-Men 1-3

Currently, all this is missing is the the six issues of Elektra v2 that Bendis wrote. I plan on releasing update packs for this every few months, happy seeding!
