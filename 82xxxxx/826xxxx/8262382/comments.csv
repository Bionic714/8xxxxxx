If you're using the new nvida 314.21 drivers, you need this patch to work with the drivers!"
,dubai1991,2013-03-16T05:25Z,thanks a lot
,SaTaNiK1,2013-03-16T05:37Z,You have to go into the SkidRow.ini file and change it from Russian to English but other than that it works great. Went from 10-20 FPS with TressFX on GTX 570 SLI to 50-60 FPS. Game is definitely fixed now.
,SaTaNiK1,2013-03-16T05:51Z,In the benchmark I get 50-60 fps with TressFX but in the actual game I still get the same crappy 20fps as always. Seems they optimized the benchmark but not the actual game :|
,plagasx,2013-03-16T06:37Z,YES! I can finally play this game! Thanks!!
,russianhornybear,2013-03-16T07:39Z,"With this patch and Catalyst 13.3 beta i can play with TressFX finally :) Thanks :) This patch  and new Catalyst was released at same time lol

@SaTaNiK1
Bench can do nothing with actual game. If hair turned on ,some objects near you ,you will get this 20 fps.And looks like  this game kinda bought by AMD so don't expect cool performance on Nvidia card :P"
,russianhornybear,2013-03-16T10:39Z,"Change language to ""English"" in Skidrow ini  if you dont know Russian xD Or just dont overwrite it"
,dandalis,2013-03-16T12:52Z,"with previous update i had 40+ fps, now its just 10-15 -__-"
,varso2012,2013-03-16T14:15Z,"Hi, ....is necessary install the other update? (i hate updates)"
,Djghost13,2013-03-16T16:00Z,pisses me off when a game runs like crap on the superior gpu. Gonna try this to see if it does help. 560ti sli btw
,sixor,2013-03-16T16:49Z,"torrent works, but it is in russian , you need to change what people above said

also noobs:
if you have nvidia disable tressfx, and update to latest beta driver, if still slow, kill yourselves for having such a crap gpu, runs awesome on gtx460"
,sunfy888,2013-03-16T19:32Z,"tressfx with ultra setting, improves to about 55fps!! NICE!! 

too bad i already have finished the game...:-("
,rupert3k,2013-03-17T03:05Z,"List of changes v.1.0.718.4...
isn't this v.1.0.723.3?"
,crunch1,2013-03-17T04:18Z,"Good question rupert3k, is this 1.0.722.3 as it says in the title? Or is it 1.0.718.4 as it says in the list of changes?"
,Barrytoo,2013-03-17T07:22Z,"Thanx 4 the update, keep it up :)"
,dulex83,2013-03-17T15:52Z,"Hi there.
I dont know wats going on but game still choppy and crashes with TressFx on.
I tried to run the benchmark and everything is fine getting around 50fps with everything on ultra settings and with TressFx. but when I start the game it lags ad then crashes. With no TressFx everything goes superb( and with tesselation on). Any suggestions?
Ive installed nvidia beta driver and this update.
Running on Gtx460 1gb.
Have to wait maybe for a new diver?
Thx"
,dulex83,2013-03-17T16:00Z,"Stll crashes with TressFx on. Dont know why. Installed update and new beta driver. In the benchmark everything runs great with TressFx and getting around 50fps but when i start the game it lags and crashes. Game runs superb with everything on ultra without TressFx.
playing on Gtx460 1GB.
Any suggestions?"
,osriccc,2013-03-17T19:08Z,"Does it fix the ""chaosbeach"" error? Does somebody know how to fix this one? Can't even start the campaign but the Benchmark Mode runs perfectly."
,sixor,2013-03-18T01:39Z,"DON´T USE TRESSFX WITH nvidia

that is all

get over it

nvidia has like 20 physx games, it was about time amd did something to fuck nvidia"
,Djghost13,2013-03-18T02:41Z,Tressfx works well with my nvidia gpus. Honestly tressfx acts unrealistic because it kinda jumps and clips all over the place. I recommend turning it off.
,oldgooseberry,2013-03-23T16:29Z,"This update works perfect with HeroMasters TR game upload.  You may have to edit one of the ini files to get english language back.

I'm not sure if it helped FPS any, but its run stable with everything turned to max except no AA... im using the SMAA injector instead with no performance drop.

FPS may be better when nvidia gets newer drivers out, I'm not sure if the beta driver they have is that great or not but download that anyways.  Tress hair effects have been working perfectly on my nvidia, but I think they will lag bad if you use standard AA, so thats where the SMAA comes in way better."
,exicee,2013-03-24T08:12Z,Nice! I just got a Steam Wallet card code for FREE! :D http://steamwalletcodes.com
,Performer81,2013-03-27T20:52Z,wheres the 730er Patch
,euphoria4949,2013-03-28T16:01Z,"Hi HeroMaster,

Do you know roughly when you will uploading the new Tomb Raider patch (v1.0.730.0)???

Thanks =)"
,MLO89,2013-03-30T18:22Z,Skidrow seems to have abandoned the patches as new ones have come out and are not being uploaded. If anyone wants to keep up with the patches go to cs.rin.ru forums to get them. They are patches without cracks but no further skidrow cracks are needed as all the previous ones still work. The latest patch is now 1.01.732.1 and I got it there.
