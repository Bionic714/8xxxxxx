,johnny4upload,2013-03-16T12:40Z,"@deadlyjack, this is clearly not fake, I download nearly all my tv shows from eztv. Trusted and always best quality!"
,Glyse,2013-03-16T21:01Z,"This file is compressed, and to inflate file you have to have a password. Now, to get this password you have to visit a site and participate in a contest to win an iphone 4, and if you do so, hopefully your anitvirus tells you that you are about to get fucked in the ass by some idiots. DONT BOTHER DOWNLOAD THIS SHIT."

,rupert3k,2013-03-17T01:50Z,"Fabulous MKV eztv quality as always.
Why would a compressed bogus torrent have thousands of seeds?
deadlyjack & Glyse are clearly a pair of industry paid naysayers.
If the industry could figure out how to solve the copyright dilemma we wouldn't need p2p but until they do Bram Cohen has our backs."
,Knjaz23,2013-03-17T08:06Z,"hey greetings EZTV! :)
can you send me a package of all episodes of spartacus season 3? and link to it...please, thanks
I´m your fan!
bye"
,eddide,2013-03-17T18:27Z,"thank you in advance :) I don't understand why some trolls would say it's password protected..? It's MKV, and it's eztv. When has ever eztv led you down"
,squash34,2013-03-18T16:55Z,why do people lie about these torrents..? are they mafiaa agents?
