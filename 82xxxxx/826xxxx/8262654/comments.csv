,EliteBeast,2013-03-16T07:13Z,I like Bill Maher as a comedian but John Stossel is better at real free thinking. http://thepiratebay.sx/search/stossel/0/3/0
,ajoiner85,2013-03-16T07:36Z,Just not Stossel when it comes to weather science... Or anytime free market values are inconvenient... Same ol'...
,ziggyff,2013-03-16T08:53Z,EliteBeast take your science challenged stupid right wing BS and stop selling it to the intelligent people here b4 I get you banned from TPB
,deadcow1,2013-03-16T10:02Z,"EliteBeast take your science denying minority hating , gun loving , jesus praising republican ass in the yard and play with sticks and dirt. The internet is not for you. We have porn here."
,EliteBeast,2013-03-16T10:58Z,"Even though John Stossel is on FOX Business channel doesnt mean he is right wing republican. He is Agnostic, Independent, Libertarian and doesnt believe in global warming like Bill Maher. He is more logical than any of you morons."
,EliteBeast,2013-03-16T11:03Z,Ive been Atheist all my life and these idiots automatically think I believe in God just cause I recommend a tv show I am sure they will like if they just download it and watch it.
,majik895,2013-03-16T13:31Z,Almost every scientist in the world have come to the conclusion that climate change is real but hey we should listen to you because..........
,soundping,2013-03-16T14:04Z,The internet is for Real Time downloading.. lol
,TheItalianJob,2013-03-16T14:46Z,"Thanks for the download ez.

,hijazi23,2013-03-16T15:12Z,@deadcow1 porn? bullshit! theirs no porn on the internet!
,EliteBeast,2013-03-16T16:07Z,"of course global warming is real but so is global cooling, its just a cycle the planet goes through but idiots like you think global warming is caused by humans and cows."
,CatOfTheCanals,2013-03-16T16:43Z,"Global warming is a natural cycle. However, the rate at which it is happening is much faster than what is natural. It is the methane from livestock, and the CO2 emissions from humans that is causing this accelerated action. "
,TinyYeti,2013-03-16T18:14Z,"EliteBeast, educate yourself.

And libertarians, at least the American ones, are nothing more than rabid capitalists foaming at the mouth whenever their little free-market delusions get challenged. Stossel's a fucking moron."
,TinyYeti,2013-03-16T18:18Z,"Look at the graph, and tell me how that spike is simply another natural warming cycle.

AGW deniers are the biggest fucktards on earth."
,ScarletteSpider,2013-03-16T19:37Z,"come on guys...you can't argue with ppl like elitebeast...they are soooo far inside ""the bubble"" that the reality the rest of us live in doesn't exist for them. So much so that is why the President is taking republicans out for dinner to tell them personally that he is offering 2 spending cuts dollars for every 1 tax dollar since even though its all spelled out on the Presidents website, the republicans don't know it until they hear it from his own lips. Thats how ridiculously thick ""the bubble"" and the minds inside it are. Elitebeast is suffering from ""bubble isolationism"" or what my grandpa used to refer to ostrich head stuck in the sand syndrome"
