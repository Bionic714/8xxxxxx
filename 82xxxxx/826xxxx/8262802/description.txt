Preface :-

This Festschrift is dedicated to Melvyn B. Nathanson by his colleagues, friends, and
students. This volume celebrates his many contributions to various areas of number
theory. MelΓÇÖs outstanding career as a mathematician and a public ∩¼ügure resulted in
many achievements both in science and in the public arena.
It is appropriate to quote here the tribute of the great I.M. Gelfand to Mel:
I remember Melvyn as a young man attending my seminar in Moscow. He partic-
ipated in my Rutgers seminar as well and taught us a lot of number theory. I enjoy
his love of mathematics and the way he thinks about it. I wish him all the best and
expect new wonderful results from him.
