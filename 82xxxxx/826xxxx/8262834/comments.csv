,bedtimefy,2013-03-16T13:22Z,will this version work with rs v3 languages
,Kartos,2013-03-17T16:02Z,In English?
[T],VasiaZozulia,2013-03-17T18:15Z,"@bedtimefy, @Kartos
Yes."
,mspropst,2013-03-17T21:03Z,"Not only do you happen to be one of the Trusted/VIP members, you consistently provide more Rosetta Stone torrents than everyone else. Lots of different language/levels and versions for PC/Mac. Thanks for giving us the most up to date version in 4.1.15."
,straightflushin,2013-03-19T19:22Z,"Thanks for the nice upload, as always, but is there any real benefit to using this version over your V3?

For example, I can still download updates for the language packs in your cracked v3, but I can't anymore with this version. And all of the online benefits (games, etc.) are obviously unavailable.

Thanks again for the upload!"
,dgs334,2013-03-19T22:44Z,it tells me to add a language and to do that i need a disk. What did i do wrong?
,cromer222,2013-03-20T01:52Z,"Awsome, thank you so very much. Now we just need some V4 languages. I hope to see latin spanish considering I am living in south america."
,shinonoh,2013-03-20T22:15Z,RS Japanese please. You're the best.
,Turk_2005,2013-03-23T08:20Z,"I disconnected my internet completely before installing.  Then I finished the first install (4.1.10), and blocked two instances of Rosetta Stone in both inbound and outbound sections in Windows Firewall.

I then started the 4.1.15 update program that came with this download, but the update showing up says 4.5.5.

What do I do?"
,Turk_2005,2013-03-23T08:21Z,Forgot to mention that I still wasn't connected to the internet AT ALL when I started the update program.
,DrKatz5,2013-03-23T13:23Z,Thank you VasiaZozulia. Any chance at Vietnamese language pack?
,phrgflyer,2013-03-27T17:55Z,"@VasiaZozulia  I installed as per the instructions and blocked the 2 TOTALe.exe files.  I have a problem, I cannot get past the create new user screen, it keeps telling me invalid email"
,Vanessa7504,2013-03-28T14:41Z,omg I Love you!! physically!! thank you so much VasiaZozulia!! 
,vendettav,2013-03-30T20:36Z,"Hey, for some reason this isn't working for me. I've followed the directs to the letter and I've even tried a few different things. Nothing seems to be working. could it be that they already patched this? If anyone can help out, it would be great. Thanks!

P.S. the message I'm getting is that the program is damaged, to see the publisher. "
,vendettav,2013-03-30T20:37Z,@dgs334 You have to download the languages as well as .iso and burn them on a CD using PowerISO. It's rather simple. Good luck!
,straightflushin,2013-04-01T04:08Z,"To those having issues, unless you're using a language disk that explicitly requires v4 (Like Russian levels 4 and 5), then just use VasiaZozulia's 3.4.7 version. It's much simpler, and you can download updates for your language packs.

Just search for the download here on TPB."
,straightflushin,2013-04-01T04:10Z,"Also, you don't have to burn anything to a CD or DVD. Just use Daemon Tools and mount the .iso file that way."
,miss00,2013-04-01T21:56Z,"hello VasiaZozulia, 
 can  i humbly request the full hindi language pack please , including all levels and trhe audio companions. 
thank you so much for all your hard work !!! "
,ZuneUn,2013-04-06T11:18Z,"Would you kindly upload Mandarin lvls 4 and 5, and also Russian lvls 4 and 5 ? Thank you for the great effort you've done so far."
,lvstreeter,2013-04-12T01:24Z,I can get it to work no problem but how do I activate? Without activation I can only get a few lessons. Please help !
,PRESIDENT_CHAVEZ,2013-04-15T23:50Z,I tried everything.  not working.  I have experience with cracks. 
,ruggiere,2013-04-17T00:14Z,"Deaar VasiaZozulia 

I have installed Rosetta Stone 4.1.15 as per your notice in your crack file and it works perfect. However, I got a problem when i try to install the English (American) level 1-5 language pack through deamon tools. it says error code 9118 and 9114. I have tryed many different ways like burn in CD or copy into a usb flash driver. But all come out with error code 9118 and 9114. Do you know what is the problem with it.  I run windows xp3 on my laptob. Thanks !"
,karina602,2013-05-08T18:18Z,"Wow. Thank you so much!!!
I'm so happy it actually worked for me.
I previously had the 3.4.5 version and it just updated all the languages and my profile."
,amy_amaral,2013-05-10T17:50Z,"the program doesn't work for some reason on my computer when ever I open it It just shows a blank grey window, cn someone help me with this?"
,jurstel,2013-05-22T13:11Z,"Hello Vasia. First thank you so much for this amazing torrent.

I'd like to ask you something and please answer to me.
I did everything you said step by step, I installed the exe, I didn't let the application run after installation, I did the update, I copied the files from Crack folder where my installation folder on my (C:) is, and I did block Rosetta Stone TOTALe.exe & Rosetta StoneTOTALe.exe from connecting internet but I still can't run this.

I'm get a blank grey window everytime I open Rosetta Stone TOTALe.

Please help me because I didn't do anything wrong I think. It would be really appreciated. Thanks!"
,juliepac,2013-05-24T19:04Z,"VasiaZozulia, your torrents are ALWAYS very appreciated! Thanks for the upload.
But I think we have a problem. I believe the crack is not working anymore. I tried to install a thousand times, following the procedure always. However it never works. Can anyone confirm successful installation after March? Thanks. "
,Fangheart,2013-05-28T07:05Z,I am having the same problem as phrgflyer. Should I unblock the .exes  so I can create a profile? Obviously this has worked for other people. if someone could confirm whether or not they got the program to work without blocking or had to unblock that would be very helpful. 
,cool1919,2013-05-28T08:31Z,working. thanks.
,j1zzle,2013-05-31T04:30Z,"Works great!

The first time I installed it, I was getting the grey screen like everyone else on the comments, but then I realized you are supposed to install the program with your internet DISCONNECTED. Make sure your internet access is cut off and then install the program and use the included update. Also block the program from accessing the internet with a firewall so that it doesn't communicate with the internet after you re-enable internet access for your computer.

The program itself works flawlessly and I was able to add a V3 Japanese language pack with no problems."
,walidov85,2013-06-06T18:42Z,"Hi guys,
I'm an old user of rosetta stone V3.. after 3 years of using the V3 i got a error message that made uninstall it. then i reinstalled it; thats when i got the weird grey blank screen even when i install any level of RS.
after a lot of unsuccessfull tries of making it work, i decided to try the V4. and i got it working fine without any complications.
Just keep yr internet off while installing it, install the updater, then copy the crack content and use it. (you may need to reboot after installing the main program).
But i still need to know if this version is safe to update languages version.
Thanks uploader for yr work. "
