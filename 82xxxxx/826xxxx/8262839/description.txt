Dracula (2012) aka Dracula 3D
 
The tale begins with Jonathan Harker, journeying by train and carriage from England to Count Draculas crumbling, remote castle situated in the Carpathian Mountains on the border of Transylvania. The purpose of his mission is to catalogue the big library of Dracula. At first enticed by Draculas gracious manner, Harker soon discovers that he has become a prisoner in the castle. He also begins to see disquieting facets of Draculas nocturnal life. One night while searching for a way out of the castle, and against Draculas strict admonition not to venture outside his room at night, Harker falls under the spell of three wanton female vampires, the Brides of Dracula.
