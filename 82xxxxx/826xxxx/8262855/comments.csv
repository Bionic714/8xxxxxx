,chem_101,2013-03-16T19:36Z,Thank you for letting me know about the delay!  I have turned off all my ways of being alerted of f1 for obvious reasons.  (spoilers)  THANKS!
,SerSpec-V,2013-03-17T03:22Z,Thanks this is great quality. The other F1 up-loaders could learn from you.
,harambasha,2013-03-17T17:18Z,"Thank you mr Tony!!

any chance to upload Oz race , it was very entertaining apparently but i can't watch F1 live because i m not that rich to afford Sky sports capitalistic prices. 
Why they don't offer only Go service subscription without tons of other channel packages FFS??
