Mango Soufflé is the first openly gay male film from India and is an eye-opening exploration of gay sexuality and relationships in a culture that is far from accepting.
In a departure from Bollyood style, marked by mostly English-language dialogue and sans musical numbers, this heartfelt drama begins when gay fashion designer Kamlesh, reeling from a recently ended relationship, invites a group of friends (of all sorts) for dinner for a special announcement. The situation reaches a boiling point when Kamlesh's sister arrives with her new fiancé, a man with an explosive secret. From there, the action whips into a frenzy as sexual tensions build and skeletons fly out of the closet.
