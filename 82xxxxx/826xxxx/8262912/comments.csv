,ChillyCrossFoot,2013-03-22T23:39Z,How do you install this? There's no Setup or Installation program. What the hell is this? A joke? There is NO setup or any way to run this. Its just a bunch of files!
,xXxArchangelxXx,2013-03-24T22:45Z,"If you would read some other post or some forums, there are multiple instructions on how to get this to work. Don't just come in here screaming ""There is no install file"". N00b. "
[T],Arrrrrrrrrr,2013-03-31T04:08Z,"First read this for how to mount the ISOs as virtual drives: http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/mount-an-iso-image-in-windows-vista/ .

Then read this for how to install the languages: http://www.ehow.com/how_6880919_do-language-files-rosetta-stone_.html . 

Depending on the Rosetta Stone install you used it may say the language files are already present but just install them anyways."

,thepilot0,2013-04-02T04:19Z,"Hey guys, I may sound like a n00b... but how do we get around the activation id? Thanks!"
,hn4898,2013-04-09T04:31Z,"so i downloaded the file and used daemon tools to mount the level 1 file. but i dont know how to install it usually when i mount it the autoplay opens and i install it but the mounted file just opens to files, no applications. what do i do from here?"
,pystoffdude,2013-04-11T02:57Z,"These are the language files only, you also need the Rosetta software, which you can also find here on TPB."
,dizzyface,2013-04-18T14:39Z,"how is it possible to get around the activation code? i got everything else set up and running, but it wont let me access alot of the content because i need an activation code, please help?"
,oobaka,2013-05-02T03:13Z,"Won't work without activation code.
