[V],psspss,2013-03-16T13:14Z,"recap of john bunces and episode (this was reported in a caption in under ice last year) so its very odd they are now reporting and aftermath now
on this episode

http://www.examiner.com/article/bering-sea-gold-loses-one-of-its-own-death-tonight

makes one wonder why he did it.. loaded gun and drunk and didnt know it was loaded?
or argument about money owing seems very odd"
,q2323,2013-03-16T13:30Z,"psspss: Yeah, definitely weird timing. His family said it was an accident, but who knows.

,livens01,2013-03-16T16:05Z,"I love how TDC used someones suicide/accidental death to try and bum up ratings. They have been stringing viewers along with this for awhile now. Hopefully his family at least got paid for using him like that.

Oh and thanks for the upload!"
