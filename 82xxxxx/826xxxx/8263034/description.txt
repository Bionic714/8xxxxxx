The Expulsion ethnic cleansings of the Germans after the Second World War

Immediately after the Second World War, the victorious Allies carried out the largest forced population transferΓÇöand perhaps the greatest single movement of peoplesΓÇöin human history. With the assistance of the British, Soviet, and U.S. governments, millions of German-speaking civilians living in Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and the parts of eastern Germany assigned to Poland were driven out of their homes and deposited amid the ruins of the Reich, to fend for themselves as best they could. 

Millions more, who had fled the advancing Red Army in the final months of the war, were prevented from returning to their places of origin, and became lifelong exiles. Others again were forcibly removed from Yugoslavia and Romania, although the Allies had never sanctioned deportations from those countries. 

Altogether, the expulsion operation permanently displaced at least 12 million people, and perhaps as many as 14 million. Most of these were women and children under the age of sixteen; the smallest cohort of those affected were adult males. These expulsions were accomplished with and accompanied by great violence. 

Tens and possibly hundreds of thousands lost their lives through ill-treatment, starvation, and disease while detained in camps before their departureΓÇöoften, like Auschwitz I, the same concentration camps used by the Germans during the Second World War. Many more perished on expulsion trains, locked in freight wagons without food, water, or heating during journeys to Germany that sometimes took weeks; or died by the roadside while being driven on foot to the borders. 

The death rate continued to mount in Germany itself, as homeless expellees succumbed to hypothermia, malnutrition, and other effects of their ordeal. Calculating the scale of the mortality remains a source of great controversy today, but estimates of 500,000 deaths at the lower end of the spectrum, and as many as 1.5 million at the higher, are consistent with the evidence as it exists at present. Much more research will have to be carried out before this range can be narrowed to a figure that can be cited with reasonable confidence. On the most optimistic interpretation, nonetheless, the expulsions were an immense manmade catastrophe

on a scale to put the suffering that occurred as a result of the ΓÇ£ethnic cleansingsΓÇ¥ in the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s in the shade. They took place without any attempt at concealment, under the eyes of tens of thousands of journalists, diplomats, relief workers, and other observers with access to modern communications, in the middle of the worldΓÇÖs most crowded continent. Yet they aroused little attention at the time. Today, outside Germany, they are almost completely unknown.
