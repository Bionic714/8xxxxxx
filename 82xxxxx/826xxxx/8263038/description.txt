In the first of a three-parter following the Duggars' trip to Asia, the family visit Tokyo, where they try to master using chopsticks and learn how to make sushi. Enjoy & don't forget to help seed! :)

Note - I can't promise I will be able to get my hands on this every week but will share if I am able to! :)

BIG thank you to WEBY for this cap & for uploading!
