,linasbj,2013-03-16T12:16Z,How can it be fake when it's clearly stated it's not a crack? Give that guy a brain transplant.
,eduazy,2013-03-16T12:17Z,80% of the work has been done (disable online mode) now we only need a simple crack that should be done already

,desmond13,2013-03-16T12:51Z,"I Have opened the .package file and analyzed the code... So far it seems legit, or in other words, at least it's not a virus nor malware... I have, however not yet tried if it actually works..."
,chuvaksimpson,2013-03-16T13:09Z,fake?
,SimTask,2013-03-16T13:11Z,"Quit calling it a fake.. This is not a crack... This doesn't really open up a crack.. Only real way to crack this is to use a private server.. Maybe someone can make it look at local machine to connect and save but thats more coding then one would think.. 

  Don't be surprised if there is no working crack for this game for another month or two"
,chuvaksimpson,2013-03-16T13:13Z,how to play the game if i have no crack version?
,k4m1k4z3_pt,2013-03-16T13:13Z,"Damn, still needs origin installed. I really wanted to check this out"
,kamilski,2013-03-16T13:34Z,Motherfucker!
,k0rmum,2013-03-16T14:36Z,"Don't call something fake because you can't fucking pay attention.

1) It's not a crack. NOT A CRACK.
2) You need to actually have the game (you know, buy it) to use this. So everyone who has pirated it and are waiting for the crack...IT'S NOT THE CRACK AND YOU STILL HAVE TO WAIT.
3) It's not the crack. Seriously. Did you torrent it? Yes? This won't work for you.

It's legit, but it's not the crack."
,eduazy,2013-03-16T15:08Z,"anyone knows how to avoid origin activation code? all the games have keygen or crack, why this game is taking so long? its annoying"
,Yamario,2013-03-16T15:21Z,Nice nice! keep going on!
,tikonash13,2013-03-16T16:19Z,who can i use that?
,klampflm,2013-03-16T16:41Z,"Please, can someone answer this: Is there a way to get the game without buying it and still play online? or is that not possible at all even if someone rips it? "
,egclocknload,2013-03-16T16:46Z,"This torrent is for PEOPLE WHO BOUGHT THE GAME.
"
,Ykalondr,2013-03-16T18:18Z,"To anyone asking. No there is no way to play the game without having a legal serial registered on Origin, you can't play without Origin and you can't use a keygen."

,sfaddic182,2013-03-16T20:50Z,fucking EA
,razor9555,2013-03-16T21:06Z,"@digimoon, whatcha mad about?
he said this isn't a crack, 
atleast he uploaded this and someone with some modding skills could made a crack from it, maybe.

my hope only is that they crack it, sooner the better, but simcity is really hard to crack"
,Serenifly,2013-03-16T21:13Z,"This has been reported in some website. It's basically the programmer debug mode.

But it appears that even it doesn't have a function to save the game offline. That more and more looks to be the biggest hurdle towards a crack. It's probably nowhere in the game."
,klampflm,2013-03-16T22:26Z,@Ykalondr: Thanks for the clarification!

,gungrave4ever,2013-03-18T02:24Z,"Yo, Fungusx50, before you start insulting other people's WTFever you're calling of theirs a freaking idiot, check your English (because your English is a freaking idiot, and so're you)."

,digibluez,2013-03-18T22:31Z,"Why do you people keep ripping off others with shitty ad networks,wasting time, and trojans ,instead of fuking EA over....and come up with real offline mode, its really simple in theory"
,Anonkar,2013-03-19T04:41Z,"digibluez how the fuck is creating an offline mode ""simple in theory""? You do realize the game DOES NOT SAVE ONTO YOUR COMPUTER AT ALL. All the saved towns go straight to the servers. To be able to make a workable offline mode they have to rewrite the code create some other measure to circumvent it. Cracking or modding anything code-wise is much harder than you are assuming."
,martinon,2013-03-19T14:42Z,"If people are able to create their own servers for World of Warcraft, then it should be possible for someone to come up with a way for this to work too :)"
,Anonkar,2013-03-19T22:19Z,"martinon I think it would be more trouble than it's worth to create a server setup from pirates. Although If they somehow emulate a server system through code like the assassins creed two crack. Then they could program the emulated server to save perhaps. I think that would be the best plan of action. Of course this is just a theory though, we'll have to see what the crack gurus come up with."
,ybriK,2013-03-21T09:23Z,Either you guys are a. Idiots who can't/understand simple English. or b. Mindless trolls who love wasting their time when they could've been doing something productive.

,Aabir11,2013-03-21T15:55Z,I have download the 'SimCity Without Crack' version.Please anyone tell me where I have to paste this thing.Plz.............
,NootYu,2013-03-21T20:53Z,"Aabir11, this is not a crack or a full offline mode or anything of this nature.

This is some work done pushing efforts to attempt to get offline features in the future.  

READ: To even use this you will need your legit Simcity game and Origin account.  This only takes away the offline prompt and and a little bit more.  You can not use this on a nonlegit copy of the game, nor can you use it to save your game offline.

BTW thank you for your bit of work SIcrift.  I hope in the future the community can help make this game better than EA would ever allow it to be."
,Aabir11,2013-03-22T05:09Z,"So NootYu,cant I play it now?"
,silentthunder,2013-03-26T00:33Z,"Aabir11, 
That had better be sarcasm or you are retarded.
Read the comment before replying to it, actually just go ahead and read the fucking description for the torrent and save yourself some time. Why do I even bother, im guessing you won't understand any of this anyways."
,MasterNoone,2013-03-30T19:20Z,"Could someone with the original game...install the game in a virtual machine, login (with offline mode, because of the timeout) save the machine state with the game opened and logged in and then change password (for your own safety) and share the vm files with us here on tpb? That way we all could play and save the game using the ""save state"" feature on vmware....Please I know it's asking for much but that would give everyone a chance of trying the game....If you can't do it please let this request be heard to someone who does."
,ryballs,2013-04-07T13:46Z,MasterNoone: No. Just no.
,Sivos,2013-04-16T17:50Z,"I don't really care about saving myself, just as long as I can try the game to see if I should buy it.  It looks good, but I have been fooled before.  If this works with a pirated version please tell me.  As long as I can play about 30 minutes to an hour, I'm fine with it."
