David Letterman's The Late Show always had a long tradition of
excellent musical performances -- indeed, it's one of the few
places on American network television where live music thrives --
so the question that surrounds the 1997 release of Live on
Letterman: Music from the Late Show isn't why, but why did it
take so long? There have been enough remarkable performances to
fill several CDs, so hopefully this disc is the first in a
series, but even if it isn't, there's plenty of great music on
this 14-track album to make it satisfying. Not everything here
will suit the tastes of every listener, but there are a number of
wonderful moments, whether it's one-off duets from Elvis Costello
and Burt Bacharach ("God Give Me Strength"), Lyle Lovett and Al
Green ("Funny How Time Slips Away") Jerry Garcia and David
Grisman ("Friend of the Devil"), Jewel and Flea ("You Were Meant
for Me") and Van Morrison, Sinad O'Connor and the Chieftains
("Have I Told You Lately That I Love You?") or dynamic
performances from R.E.M. ("Crush with Eyeliner"), Sheryl Crow
("Strong Enough"), Lenny Kravitz ("Are You Gonna Go My Way"), Rod
Stewart ("Reason to Believe") and Patti Smith ("Who Do You
Love"). The end result is one of the few soundtracks that is more
than a memento.
