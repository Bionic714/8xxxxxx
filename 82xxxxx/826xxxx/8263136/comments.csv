,MisterMeat,2013-03-16T15:28Z,"VERY Minor spoiler alert for those thinking about downloading this:

Tons of rain in Australia, Q1 was delayed 30 minutes. Track conditions were so bad that the FIA postponed Q2 and Q3 until before the race.

Therefore this download, while complete and 2 hours long, is basically 20 minutes of Q1 and 90 minutes of watching the track guys mop up rain. Plenty of decent commentary and pit row footage though."
