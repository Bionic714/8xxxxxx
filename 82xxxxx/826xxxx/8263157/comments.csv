,LaxerFL,2013-03-17T03:31Z,Sorry if the speeds are low. I'm the only seed until some other people complete the torrent and I max out a 1MB up. Stick with it and we'll get this torrent really going!
,LaxerFL,2013-03-18T18:21Z,"I think the quality is pretty good on all the episodes. The ones in Season 6 have lower volume then the rest but that's not really a big deal. Season 6 is ripped right from the DVD. Some are avi some are mpg some are mp4. I didn't want to reencode all of them but left it up to you guys to do what you want with em.

Lemme know if the quality is good and what not!"
