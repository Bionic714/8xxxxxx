His elder son, Rajesh, is a dedicated police inspector; and his second son, Amar, is a slacker, womanizer, and alcoholic. When an orphaned young woman, Reshma, comes to live with them, Amar gets intimate with her. When Rana comes to know of Amar's interest in Reshma, he warns him that Reshma is not suitable for their family. But Amar maintains an interest and is jealous to see Reshma in the company of Vikas, an employee at the farmhouse. A fight ensues between Vikas and Amar, and Vikas is killed.
