For others;

Picture is Beautiful..for me? DVD Quality..I see no ""crunchiness"" anywhere.

However..that being said..there are a few sound issues. Minor in a way..the ""Big Bass"" of the soundtrack when mixed with action scenes like explosions is a little more ...'bouncy'(?) for lack of a better description than usual or than I would prefer..but the picture is SO good that it kinda balances out..I'm a keeper/collector so this is for others like me..picture Perfect..Sound..is a ""maybe""..but I'm keeping this one..."
