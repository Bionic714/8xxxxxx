,Furious1964,2013-03-30T06:27Z,"Three things:

1) Will this fix the constant freezes I get when I play it on my gaming laptop? (It's above specs with switchable graphics capability).

2) Any virus warning from scanners is a false positive as A/V detects hacked .EXE files.

and...

3) @ rknb: You're an idiot, scene3all is a VIP and doesn't pass off viruses. ALWAYS trust VIP and Trusted Statuses and ALWAYS trust him, Extremezone, Mr.Stifmeister and others of their ilk.

And two final words you should be ALWAYS do, boys and girls: SCAN & SANDBOX."
