,Jim090,2013-05-07T13:40Z,"Hmm is it possible for you to upload the gamersgate version of the game Praetorians?
the one here http://www.gamersgate.com/DD-PRAEDGF/praetorians  ?"
[V],esharoth,2013-05-10T08:40Z,Well Praetorians is also available on GOG and comes with some bonus content. Is there anything special about the GamersGate version?
,Jim090,2013-05-10T19:14Z,"Ehm busted!, that's what I really wanna find out...As for the bonus content it's only the soundtrack and some wallpapers.I'm already seeding the soundtrack in higher quality than the bonus one, but  
I don't have the bandwidth to seed the installer on my own:( Iwould like to spread/seed both installers to find out which has less compatibility issues"
,Jim090,2013-05-10T19:20Z,"praetorians' gog version is already up, but I don't know if it's the latest version of installer from gog for this game....most gog games installers have been upgraded to 2.x.x.x version, and the one uploaded is 1.0.0.6 I think."
