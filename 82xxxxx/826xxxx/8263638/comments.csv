Can anyone give me suggestions about what registry entries to add so that I can run the DLC setup?"

,kronik123,2013-03-17T07:45Z,"Excellent UL, Only thing is the crack in this one doesn't work. You must use the crack from the ACIII Tyranny Of King Washington-Reloaded. Then it works gr8. Saves + No glitches. Tested on Windows 8 Pro x64..."
,OmniNegro,2013-03-17T13:21Z,"@kronik123
It looks to me like this *IS* the very version you mentioned, so there should be no difference.

Something else fixed it for you."
,XHaloXX,2013-03-17T15:06Z,"@Pakundo, you only need to extract the DLC.exe file, then copy the extracted file to your game folder. to extract the the exe file, use universal extractor, its free, or try to use winrar (rename the exe file to .zip) but im not sure if it will work with winrar."
