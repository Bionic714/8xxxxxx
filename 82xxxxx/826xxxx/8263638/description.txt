In Episode #2: The Betrayal, you gain the Power of the Eagle which grants
access to a unique set of gifts that enable lightning-fast reactions and
adds another dimension of stealth beyond even the previous chapters
Power of the Wolf!

Similar to the Power of the Wolf, Power of the Eagle has two different uses.
First, it enables Ratonhnhakton to soar from one location to another quickly
and invisibly as a ghostly eagle. You activate this ability by looking in
the direction you want to go - if the Power of the Eagle is available to
use, you will see a reticle appear with two wings.

Once you press the button to activate the ability, Raton will transform
into an eagle and streak towards the new location completely unseen!
Best of all, you can use this ability while running or jumping to
dramatically increase the distance of your jumps or even save yourself
from a nasty fall.

Of course, the Power of the Eagle would not be complete if it didnt include
some kind of offensive component as well. Consequently, we've included the
Eagle Strike, which will enable you to power dive into a foe, ending their
life with the swiftness of a deadly raptor! Will this extraordinary ability
be enough to ensure that Ratonhnhakton can stand against King Washington
and his remaining lackeys Israel Putnam and Benjamin Franklin?
