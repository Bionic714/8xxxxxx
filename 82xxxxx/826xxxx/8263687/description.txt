Very interesting interpretation of the works from legendary Polish folk group "Silna Grupa pod Wezwaniem", an assemble popular in Poland in the late 60s. Their works were on one hand hallmarks of cabaret, and on another with Polish rural folk tradition. The lyrics (by Kazimierz Grzeskowiak and Tadeusza Chyla) dealt with life in Polish countryside, folk rituals and peasant customs. But beyond a joke and a pastiche there was a lot of wisdom, reflection and timely insights. Seemingly slight texts smuggled valuable and significant content. This satirical-intellectual style seems so perfect for Kazik which always excel well in such convention. The album was produced by Andrzej Izdebski (Boys Band Trio, Sonus Akrobata) who was also responsible for arranging, recording, and mixing.
