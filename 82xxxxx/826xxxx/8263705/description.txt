James Dempsey was a tough New York cop who got himself into a lot of 
trouble by killing his partner during a corruption investigation. With 
things too hot for him in New York, Dempsey was seconded to London's 
elite SI10, where he was assigned to work with Detective Sergeant Harriet 
Makepeace, under the supervision of Chief Superintendent Spikings. Dempsey 
found British police methods slow and infuriating, and his new colleagues 
considered him a violent maverick, entirely too attached to his .357 
Magnum. The immediate antagonism between Dempsey and Makepeace was 
countered by a strong physical attraction, and while they fought 
continuously, they made a good, effective team.
