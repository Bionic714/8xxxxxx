Meanwhile the radio show continues!  Hope you can bring us that more often."
[T],480v,2013-03-17T02:27Z,"I'll try, but in all likelihood it won't be as frequent as the other two. Ed's time slot even at 9 am isn't very convenient for me. It's probably why I've never uploaded Stephanie. 

I don't want to promise anything though.. But I'll see what I can do. btw, Unless Ed can get more downloads than Randi or Thom, I don't think it's worth switching.

[V],TheExecutive,2013-03-17T02:36Z,"Yes, now that you mention it when I used to upload Ed Schultz when I used to subscribe to his podcast I had the same problem....."
[T],480v,2013-03-19T13:12Z,Aren't podcasts available anytime?
