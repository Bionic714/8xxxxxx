PCSX2 is a PlayStation 2 emulator: with it, you can run games originally released for the console directly to your computer! 

An emulator is a software that simulates the hardware of the other device. That is, for the PlayStation 2 games, the computer is like an island. Thanks to this, you can run the games of the device directly on your PC. 

The new version brings several internal improvements, such as a list of compatible games bigger, faster, an audio system more efficient, more responsive controls and more graphics settings available. Besides all that, this version is at least 10% faster than the previous ones. 

This emulator is very simple to install and use. 

Instructions: 

After downloading run the installer and follow the instructions, in choosing the bios point to the folder PS2 Bios and choose your bios, I preferred personally chose Europe and configure the video for DirectX 9 software. 

Enjoy!
