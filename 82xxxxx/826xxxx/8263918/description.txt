Mars Attacks Kiss #1


The weekly invasion continues here! In 1970s New York, four teens are handed the power to become godlike figures... unless some attacking Martians find a way to steal that power for themselves! A tale torn from the original 1976 Kiss comic, courtesy of Chris "God of Thunder" Ryall and Alan "War Machine" Robinson!
