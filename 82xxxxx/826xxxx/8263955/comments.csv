Can anyone help?

These (ENG) subs seem correct, but are timed incorrectly:

Does anyone know of any torrent with the ENGLISH .pgs file? Or, failing that, an accurate .SRT file for this release? (Most of the SRT files are laughably bad when it comes to the ""future Hawaiian creole/dialect""!)"

Time shifted English subs that seem to work correctly with this release..."
