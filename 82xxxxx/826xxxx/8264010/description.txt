Tackling the problems plaguing the U.S. health-care system, this accessible guide explores the pitfalls of contemporary medicine and medical treatments, concentrating on diseases linked to poor lifestyle choices, such as obesity and diabetes. While much of the health-care industry is centered on a blanket approach that addresses a general disease instead of the person affected by it, this guide suggests that personalization is the key to good health. It asserts that patients who make physical, emotional, and spiritual lifestyle changes to improve their diets, exercise regimens, and stress levels can help alleviate problems caused by lifestyle illnesses.
