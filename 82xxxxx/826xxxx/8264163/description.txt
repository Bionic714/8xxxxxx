How the squalid streets of 70s New York gave birth to music that would
go on to conquer the world - punk, disco and hip hop.

In the 1970s the Big Apple was rotten to the core, yet out of the grime
grit and low rent space emerged new music unlike anything that had gone
before.

Inspired by the Velvet Underground, a new wave of 'punk' rock emerged in
lower Manhattan including The New York Dolls, The Ramones and the Patti
Smith Group. Meanwhile, downtown loft parties held by gay New Yorkers
heralded the birth of disco, which would eventually spawn the ultimate
club for the privileged few: Studio 54. The swanky mid-town discos were
out of bounds to black New York so in the Bronx DJs such as Kool Herc
Grandmaster Flash and Afrika Bambaataa created their own parties
heralding the birth of hip hop.

With David Johansen, Patti Smith, John Cale, Richard Hell, Grandmaster
