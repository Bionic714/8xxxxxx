In this mild drama based on Siegfried Lenz's short story, a Serbian girl from Yugoslavia (Mirjana Jokovic) has traveled into Germany with visions of a freer, more romance-filled life. Along the way she encounters all sorts of people who are as unsettled as she and confirms for herself that this cannot be her home, and that her native land -- whatever its faults -- is just the place she really wants to be.
