Plot
   In 1865, as the American Civil War winds inexorably toward conclusion, U.S. 
president Abraham Lincoln endeavors to achieve passage of the landmark 
constitutional amendment which will forever ban slavery from the United States. 
However, his task is a race against time, for peace may come at any time, and if 
it comes before the amendment is passed, the returning southern states will stop 
it before it can become law. Lincoln must, by almost any means possible, obtain 
enough votes from a recalcitrant Congress before peace arrives and it is too 
late. Yet the president is torn, as an early peace would save thousands of 
lives. As the nation confronts its conscience over the freedom of its entire 
population, Lincoln faces his own crisis of conscience -- end slavery or end the 
war.
