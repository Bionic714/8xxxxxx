Within the United States the soaring cacophony of Rock, Rap and Hip-Hop may often prove to be the most rampant of movements among media concentration. When we think of Country and Western music, itΓÇÖs mighty hard to conjure imagery exempt of Dolly Parton, craggy dungareesΓÇÖ and then naturally, our innocuously slow friend, Cletus from The Simpsons. However, a fine young lady-resident of Coffeeville, Alabama gives the genre an all too needed kick up the ass... Quite literally!

Ashton Shepherd, this 24 year old package of fiery splendour, has communicated that exact spirit of revival through her newly released second album, ΓÇÿWhere Country GrowsΓÇÖ. She is seen to chisel sassy expression through a collection of amusingly garish songs thusly propelling her as a true veteran of the quintessential western sound.

ΓÇ£...deftly sculpting words and phrases like a seasoned master...ΓÇ¥ - Randy Lewis, The L.A. Times

Her worn-in rustic voice is instantly engaging, joyful, hopeful, yet also somewhat intimidating and tough-minded... What a parcel! This album is a flourishing transition from her debut, ΓÇÿSounds So GoodΓÇÖ, which in 2008 ascertained huge reception among the ΓÇÿDollywoodΓÇÖ and Country and Western faithful. However, ΓÇÿWhere Country GrowsΓÇÖ has definitely received a mixed bag of responses; with Kevin John Coyne of Country Universe rather scientifically slapping it with a C rating. He labelled the assemblage as "outdated". 

He also expounded that even as, "Ashton Shepherd is bringing country back to country... a dull vocal isnΓÇÖt improved by exaggerated twang. It just sounds forced."

I would champion that her latest episode is considerably better than the former. Illustrative of such fanciful progression comes in the form of ΓÇÿLook It Up.ΓÇÖ This jocular yet essentially empowering number is by far my favourite of the lot; with its regrettably catchy pulse and frolicsome rhythm. And if you were thinking you were all good, you are then opportunely bestowed with ΓÇÿIΓÇÖm GoodΓÇÖ, which augments the playful quality earlier. And the title track, ΓÇÿMore Cows Than PeopleΓÇÖ, yes a rootinΓÇÖ tootin fact of South Dakota, but more pertinently, is a fine humdinger worthy of toe tap or two.

I feel compelled to declare that I am writing this item whilst an episode of ΓÇÿOnly Fool and HorsesΓÇÖ reverberates harmlessly in the background. And it got me all pensive... Del Boy and Dolly Parton are really one in the same - Why? You intuitive brutes rightly enquire. Well allow me to elucidate. In short, theyΓÇÖre timeless characters and are both indeed manifestations of societyΓÇÖs prevailing expression. Par exemple ΓÇÿOnly Fools...ΓÇÖ proved so ingeniously comical, that the show became a national institution. By the same token, Dolly and her Country and Western compatriots, were so tremendously ingrained within American society, it never ceases to lose its appeal, even today...

Through ShepherdΓÇÖs grounded vocal and vivacious charm an air of familiarity and accessibility, evoking huge collectivism, is accordingly unearthed. In no way am I saying the albumΓÇÖs a pioneering stride in musical venture, my tastes are pretty conflicting, however; her balanced commercial nous would probably keep her afloat on a tepid country wave for some time IΓÇÖd imagine. There is room for this expressionist, and that room is firmly placed in the deep south of America... Alabama, sheΓÇÖs all yours!
