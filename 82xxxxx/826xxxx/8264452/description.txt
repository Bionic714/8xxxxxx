F1 2013 Melbourne, Australia

Coverage of the 3rd Practice Session for the Melbourne GP Live from SKY SPORTS F1 HD. To reduce SKY's LIVE sync errors with audio during add-breaks,
the commercials have been left intact as removing them can cause considerable encoding and playback problems as the live stream switches from Dolby Digital
to standard stereo output during add breaks and then back, which plays havoc with encoding the feed as AC3 Digital.

To keep file sizes to a minimum, the video has been scaled from 1080p source down to 720p. High Profile 3.1 has been used to cut down on encoding times.

All torrents for F1 2013 will be encoded to MKV format with 720p resolution & AC3 Dolby Digital Audio. These video files should play smoothly with the standard
media players such as VLC, WMP, KM Player, WMC, MP-HC.

**For those having mkv playback issues on Windows 7 or 8, I recommend Shark Codec Packs which are available free here:

***PLEASE NOTE*** The Qualifying Session was completely abandoned after Q1 due to heavy thunderstorms and has been re-scheduled to take place on
Sunday morning before the race. As there is NO actual result from the first broadcast and Sky also had a 40 minute interuption in their feed,
I will NOT be uploading this first qualifying session. Qualifying for Q2 & Q3 will be uploaded when it takes place Sunday.

Thank you
