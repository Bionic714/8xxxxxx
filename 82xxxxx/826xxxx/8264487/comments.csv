[V],dhjudasx,2013-03-17T05:30Z,"what will be next is likely 100% one of these movies in this list..

I am still planning on reuploading Final Fantasy VII Advent Children COMPLETE with dual 5.1 Audio (English and Japanese) because it's one of my highest rated torrent uploads and the most common request for it is to have Japanese audio too."
,221BBST,2013-03-17T07:30Z,"Nice, original language audio is usually preferable to the dubbed one. Hmmm, where is the list?"
[V],dhjudasx,2013-03-17T08:01Z,"strange... try that again .. not the first time I've tried to link an image and it just goes missing from the comment..
