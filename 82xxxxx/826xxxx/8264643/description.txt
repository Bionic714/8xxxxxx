Finally I have the complete ORBX North America with all published airports.
Three airport sceneryΓÇÖs I found on the internet somewhere else than TPB.
Therefor I will upload them for those of you who donΓÇÖt have them.
Airports in the torrent are:
FTX US WA56 Israel's Farm at Sedro Woolley v1.00
FTX US 3W5 Concrete Municipal Airport v1.10
FTX US 7S3 Stark's Twin Oaks Airpark v1.50

I think I made the torrent so you can choose witch to download in case you have any of them already.

In order to have them to display in best way you need already in TPB
Blue Central Rocky Mountains
Blue Northern Rocky Mountains
Blue Pacific Fjords
-and
Blue Pacific Northwest 
-with all the latest patches that you can get from ORBX homepage.

Please keep the torrent alive, upload twice as much as you download.
And be patient, I have a slow connection.
