this is just my compilation from various sources, the best quality I could find at that time.
they started filming in HD from 'Planet of the Dead', but for some reason I didn't download 'The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe' and 'The Snowmen' in HD :( but 'The Snowmen' is still pretty good, and 'The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe' is okay. so.... 


enjoy and SEED!
