,ScarletteSpider,2013-03-18T03:24Z,"for a cam, this is a reaaalllly good copy
A = 9
V = 7

On my VLC player, there was a place about 2/3rds the way through that the audio got out of sync with the video, but a 2.00 adjustment in the sync tools fixed that easy peasy.

Movie itself is very very good, makes a good explination of how everyone got to be the way the were by the time Dorothy and Tip shows up, excellent prequel story!"
,ScarletteSpider,2013-03-18T03:26Z,"almost forgot, also there is no ppl shadows anywhere throughout the movie, camera frames the entire screen so no chop off, no background noises from theater audience either! Well done uploader and tyvm for an excellent cam

If only the others did this well"
,ChasUGC,2013-03-26T04:32Z,Ignore the spammers. The quality was very good. No sync problems here either. v=8. a=8. Quite exceptional for a cam. M=6.

Also missing about two minutes at 1:12:47."
