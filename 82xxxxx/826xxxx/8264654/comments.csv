,DaBigLebowski,2013-03-29T02:50Z," ******    Star Trek Fans are suppose to be cool, nerdy, but more importantly SMART!  Based on the seeding of ALL STAR TREK torrents, it looks like we are a group that is greedy, selfish, with an every man for themselves mentality. PLEASE GET IN THE HABIT OF SEEDING.  Or in a future, there won't be any free downloads.  $49.99 for a box set?  or JUST SEED?  Come on Trekkies!!!!!"
,mtxbluethunder,2013-04-30T00:54Z,"From what I can tell, this looks good.  Just finished downloading.  I'll seed it at 1 MB/s for the next day or so."
,jambuttons,2013-05-01T05:35Z,"There is a lot of noise on this print. I don't know whether it's from the BluRay master, or shitty compression."
,highresjunkie,2013-05-05T10:02Z,"Shitty compression? Are you kidding me? The bit rate is over 10k! Total overkill unless you have a 50"" screen. Besides, I thought the bluray itself contained the entire season, which means this entire torrent should be under 50gigs. It's looks like the exact opposite of compression happened here... Someone tried to do a lossless encode and didn't know what they were doing and got outputs of larger file size than the originals. "
,TheLathe,2013-05-15T04:53Z,"Uh...

Seeing that the original Blu-ray set episodes take upwards of about 8 Gigs of space, um, uh, NO..., I don't THINK that the encode here is making them BIGGER than that...  : )

Actually, I would frigg'n LOVE a Lossless post of all the ST: TNG Blu-rays!

But, as to another comment about grain; yeah... I'm not one of those anal blindly fanatical film grain worshiping types.  Although I consider myself a true video and especially an audiophile, still, I personally would have appreciated maybe just a TAD more post processing to cool down the aliasing (especially on the bridge back panels) and grain overall.  Remember, this is SUPPOSED to be a very slick Sci Fi Futuristic looking show, NOT some old classic FILM that the anal-babies would consider sacrilege if ANY processing was even THOUGHT about!

Cheers!"
,TheLathe,2013-05-15T04:56Z,"Just a thought...

On BITSNOOP there are TNG posts where a SEASON is  about 200 Gigs!  I snagged a few S1 episodes from there.  'Encounter at Farpoint', the double length Pilot episode was about 17 Gigs and another single episode that I got was about 8 Gigs.  VERY nice looking though...

... and YES, I do in fact have a 50""...

... screen...  : )"
,Torrenad000,2013-05-16T04:46Z,"@TheLathe Dude nobody wants to hear your snobby ass comments on all the trek torrents. I own season 1 on blu ray and you see grain on certain scenes, it's not the encoding. These were filmed like 25 years ago on old 80's telivision camera's, keeping that in mind it's incredible how much they have cleaned up and restored these prints. Just look at the difference between these and the dvd copies, it's staggering. Btw i'm watching these on a 1080p projector at about 100"" in across, and they look amazing."
,Torrenad000,2013-05-16T04:50Z,P.S. If you were such a videophile you would buy the damn blu ray. 
,TheLathe,2013-05-16T05:43Z,"Heh heh, touchy, touchy...  : )

Noooo, I'm not trying to be a snob; I was just honestly giving my very first, UNEDUCATED, impression about how it looked, that's all.

However, after posting this I did about 3 hours of reading on a Trek board somewhere, where they went into a LOT of detail as to what they did and all the extensive work that went into restoring the show in HD.  I hadn't realized that the job was so daunting and enormous.  My eyes literally hurt after reading about 21 pages of posts...

I also read how the effects team that did S1 did a much better job and that the different team who worked on S2 due to cost and time constraints didn't end up doing as good of a job and there were some errors and missteps here and there.  Very interesting stuff and quite informative.

It's good to hear you say that you have watched it projected on a 100"" screen and that it looks great.  Wow!  THAT must be something!  : )

I guess this just must be the first instance of this kind of show from that period being restored that I have come across, so I really didn't know what to expect.  And NO...  I don't hafta go and buy the BR because nice, excellent people like BOZX here do an awesome job in their encodes where even on my LOWLY 50"" screen they usually look just great!

I guess what I am remembering is the CONSISTENCY of the DVDs pretty much always looking the same.  And then the BRs because of the original elements and such like you said, there are somewhat startling changes sometimes from scene to scene.  But now I understand why...

And YES, the upgrade from the old, fuzzy and faded DVDs is indeed truly amazing!"
,Torrenad000,2013-05-16T22:20Z,"Lol, sorry to get a little defensive i just wanted to make sure people know it's not the encoder's fault for the grain and artifacts you see. I'm glad to see you have been well informed my friend! Yeah season 2 does not look nearly as good as the first, but im glad they kept the restoration in house for the third season, and it looks as good as the first. And yes i download the great copies from BOZX too, i just picked up S1 on BR because the price has gone down considerably($78 bucks when it's new, that's bananas!) Anyway happy trekking!"
,TheLathe,2013-05-16T22:49Z,"That's okay mate!  : )

Appreciate the nice follow up note.  Man, I REALLY learned a lot from that reading.  I was so confused at the variance in some of the scenes that I specifically did a search for why the remastered STAR TREK: TNG was so grainy at times, and that's how I stumbled upon this really detailed site and then read until my eyes just about literally fell out!

BTW, if you don't mind my asking about a more general web based issue... HOW do you monitor pages like this where comments have been made on a post so that you KNOW when someone else has also commented on the same one?  I looked here on this site and I could not see any settings for this, so I looked for a Chrome add-on called 'Page Monitor' which basically does the job, but there are a LOT of false notifications for all the adds and stuff (God forbid I should miss any opportunities to enlarge my penis!)

I notice that MANY people on sites like this and others somehow are able to keep track of new comments on pages where they have made posts.  Is the way I'm doing it okay or can you suggest any better ways?

Thanks!!!"
,Torrenad000,2013-05-17T06:15Z,"Hey that's a good question, i don't know i just check       back on torrents which i've commented on from time to time out of curiosity. If you find out a better method let me know! It would be nice to send a notification to your inbox, similar to imdb or youtube."
,BOSS_MODE,2013-05-21T08:29Z,"ha, nerds."
,coltonpiratetpb,2013-05-22T20:14Z,The bad BR's audio delay is about 250 ms. I will upload an audio fixed version of Encouter at Farpoint!!! Don't go away!
,coltonpiratetpb,2013-05-22T20:21Z,Audio delay on the Blu-Ray's are 200ms ahead of the video.
,coltonpiratetpb,2013-05-22T20:24Z,Audio delay on the Blu-Ray's are 150ms ahead of the video on Encounter at Farpoint.
