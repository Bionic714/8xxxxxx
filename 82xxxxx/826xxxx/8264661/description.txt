
Bible Study SIN JAMES 4 17 Taught by Brett Meador

S1-604 by BRETT MEADORu James 4:17|November 18th, 2012

In this study we took a detailed look at sin, seeing that sin is objective, subjective and seductive. Some sin is defined clearly in the Bible as wrong. But James 4:17 shows us that if we reject what God has told us to do, this is also considered sin and will be different for every person. We also saw an example of sin in Eve in how she was seduced by the lure of sin in desiring to become like God, going outside His Word.
