This is the complete Pre-Release of one of the few self published Blu Ray titles.

This is Pure Ambient Video - no audio, meant to make your large screen rectangle into Art that will not repeat for hours:)

Remember the Hubble Space Telescope image of the Carina Nebula?

Here's a wiki link to that:

The reason I did this project is that so few have actually seen the wonder of this amazing high resolution image.
I downloaded the public domain image, cleaned up a bit'o noise, turned up the saturation, then panned a 1080P window across this huge epic image.

Full resolution took 12 scans of around 6 minutes each.
Amazing detail that I as a Space Nerd have never seen on any of the go to sites.

2 other "Tours" are included as well as outtakes and tours of other HST Images, Abstract Art, and in the interest of pure unabashed self promotion, some of my large format original images... also available soon:)

Hope you enjoy, despite the file size. This can be played on a jumbo-tron with the viewer 9 meters away.

Any feedback, positive or negative would be treated as cool.

Phase one is quite free, of course. Congrats for early downloaders.
