"Muscles" is a 1982 soul single written and produced by Michael Jackson and performed by American R&B/soul singer Diana Ross.

The single reached number ten on the pop singles chart (holding this position for 6 weeks) and number four on the R&B singles chart upon its release and was the first single from her gold-certified album, Silk Electric. The song, which was named after Jackson's pet snake and was written for Ross and her "desire" for a muscle-bound lover, also gave Ross her twelfth and latest Grammy nomination for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance.
