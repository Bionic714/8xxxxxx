Here are some more of .CDP files usable in Auran's/N3V Trainz series. I make these available as Auran/N3V does not have the right to distribute content that was not even created by them. They sell a product, and collect all the content or extras if you will, made by the buyers of their products and then create a Download Station to which if you do npt own a current version of their product you are required to purchase a time limited "ticket" to be able to download content that is not even theirs. 

So here are several assets for your usaage in most versions of Trainz. Just use the Content Manager to import CDP and the asset will be added to the database.

Thanx....please seed.
