Spend some close-up time with Nora Hall, one of the best carvers in the country, as she takes us step-by-step through the process of carving what is probably one of the quintessential icons of American furniture: the Newport shell. And when it comes to turning techniques, there are few better teachers than Alan Lacer, who shows us how to use the skew: one of the more useful tools for any turner.
