We take you to a unique shop in the Catskill Mountains of New York, where truly fabulous furniture is made from unlikely materials by Steve Heller, and to the backwoods of Kentucky for the first part of a series on Windsor chair-making by David Wright. Safety and efficiency are two really important concerns for every woodworker, and there is no one better qualified than Kelly Mehler to explain how to avoid kickback accidents on the tablesaw, or Dennis Collins to demonstrate a brand new approach to frame-and-panel construction. Whatever your woodworking bent, you need sharp tools. Almost no area of woodworking is so mysterious as sharpening, so let Harrelson Stanley share some of the secrets of waterstone use.
