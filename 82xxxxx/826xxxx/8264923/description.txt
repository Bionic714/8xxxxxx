In this issue, we take a close look at a cabinetmaking technique for producing frame-and-panel doors, shown by Marc Adams. And we focus on some traditional areas of woodworking that have been brought up-to-date in the contemporary shops of Brian Boggs, one of the leading ladderback chairmakers in the country. And Dwayne McKinley Colp, continues that theme by demonstrating a modern method of breadboarding. Dulcimer making is another area of traditional woodworking that has progressed far from the original nailed boxes, as Warren May shows us, although the exquisite carving produced by master carver Georgette Kadgen is rooted firmly in tried-and-true methods learned in Europe.
