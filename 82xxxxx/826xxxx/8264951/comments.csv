cropped at little, a little movement from the cameraman but all in all a good copy and the best so far"
,michaelrwatson,2013-03-16T22:46Z,"Does this have cam audio?? If so, then it's not a TC/telecine....."
,militsiya,2013-03-17T05:07Z,"This is not a TC or Telecine. Proof at 1 hour 39 minute 1 second

shadow of guess leaving theater appears in front of the camera.

It’s only a “cam” and has hard coded Japanese or Chinese subs.

Rated as a cam is poor: 6A 6V"
,professorjpj,2013-03-17T05:34Z,why does it look sooo dark??
,murphylaw2006,2013-03-17T08:45Z,"just checked out the sample its not a tc or ts imho,audio sounds ordinary through earphones but its ok through tv speakers and the video is quite good for a cam,its watchable which is rare for a cam"
,missworld,2013-03-17T12:16Z,"Why does it look so dark? Cause it's a cam you dose.

,michaelrwatson,2013-03-18T00:56Z,"WARNING: This is not a TC, as noted above. It's a good cam (video-wise), but with poor audio that is out of sync throughout.

PB Please NUKE THIS GARBAGE. (along with all the other ""TC"" releases) it is mislabeled."
,couteau,2013-03-19T22:51Z,"stop writing bs in the torrent tittles, i appreciate you upload them, but for fuck sake this is ridiculous"

,KillFnord,2013-03-20T16:24Z,I Have No Idea Why Or What People Like This Uploader That Like To Waste Others Time And Download/Hdd Space Why Upload Something You Know Is Just Plain Crappy Looking And Sounding Just Pointless Man..But Still Man Thanks For The Upload By Taking Your Time Out To Upload It But Dude Really Stop With The Crappy Uploads Don't Waste Your Time And Others. Just Keeping It Real.
,JuicyDrops,2013-03-23T07:57Z,"Thanks for telling us it had fucking subtitles you can't turn off!

,Brahj,2013-03-28T03:51Z,"@ looneyk:

lol bro i love it!  indeed, burn in a fiery car wreck foodurner, and then i'm going to come to your funeral kill all family members in attendance then abduct your corpse and perform a ode to a great daemon lord so your next birth is into a horrifying abyssal plane of the most excruciating hellish existence you can imagine with no chance of escape.

STFU, GTFO, & DIAF.  i like your message until the spam link u fucking cunt.  I see u post that shit all over the place give up fucktard."
,PHonda,2013-03-30T02:20Z,"@KillFnord  Here's an idea you rotten piece of smegma, why don't you go buy a fucking ticket to the movies.  The reason it's so bad dipshit, is because it's not out on DVD yet, you know how long it would take you to IMDB it and find that out.  All you have to do is stop sucking dick for a second and you would have plenty of time, really, i promise.  How about you thank the uploader because he uploads a ton of shit and he can only deal with the source he gets ahold of.  Better idea, why don't you go buy an HD video camera and start filming these in theaters for everyone and then take your personal time to use editing software to make it the best it can be and then upload it for all of us.  An even better idea would be for you to make a career move from McDonald's to a movie theater and spend every penny of your slightly above minimum wage earnings on some good equipment to make us awesome copies on opening night or before.  Now get that dick out of your mouth and get to it buddy!"

,DrTeeth707,2013-04-21T21:59Z,Why do people think that a shadow of a person on the screen means it's a cam? I have NEVER seen a film in a cinema where somebody has cast a shadow on the screen; that's in over 50 years!
,DrTeeth707,2013-04-21T22:02Z,"Why do people think that shadows on the screen are real? I have never, ever, seen that happen in real life in over 50 years. FFS, to cast some of the shadows I have seen the projector would have to be at ground level - get a grip people."
,Whodat506,2013-04-21T23:08Z,shit shit shit audio 3 video 5 movie 5 garbage go watch Jack Reacher
