,vegamax,2013-03-16T21:22Z,"haha no gl huh...in its defense all animation differences aside, it was just as awesome...even the finales snf snf"
,vegamax,2013-03-16T21:30Z,i wanna seed this so bad but im close to my limit and my server will have my head lol
,NeoTechni,2013-03-16T21:56Z,Have you finally started capturing in widescreen instead of cropping it? I always hated your releases for that. That and you still use avi...
,bob9001a,2013-03-16T22:22Z,"The only good thing about the end of YJ is it also means no more hideously awful releases by {C_P}. GO FUCK YOURSELF, YOU USELESS LOSER!"
[V],{C_P},2013-03-16T22:37Z,"Yes we use avi and doing SD releases.
And no we don't crop it down (except for those black bars that you seams to love having there).
Any more stupid question NeoTechni ?"
[V],{C_P},2013-03-16T22:40Z,"If we do so ""hideously awful releases"" why do you keep downloading them bob9001a ? "
,KaiserKid7,2013-03-16T23:44Z,"I'm actually happy to have these in .avi as I am old school, it just feels right to me, as for the quality it isn't the best, but you have to respect him for his works, and appreciate what he's doing for the online YJ community. Try not to be so rude guys as no one else really uploads YJ and be grateful. Thank you {C_P} ^-^"
,mass55th,2013-03-16T23:58Z,Thanks for the .avi.
,NeoTechni,2013-03-17T00:40Z,"Proof positive that there's no stupid questions, only stupid answers. I was polite to you, yet you treated me worse than the guy swearing at you. Maybe you should take the hints and fix the problems with your releases instead of pretending the problem is with us"
[V],{C_P},2013-03-17T01:48Z,"Your right NeoTechni, was way to ticked of when I wrote that comment, sorry about that.
But the fact still stand, we only crop of the black bars that you get when capping things from the SD channel. We DON'T cropping anything else. you should know that by now.
To everyone else, thanks for your comment :D"
,TNBG,2013-03-17T02:26Z,"Honest question?  I've been downloading your releases for the past year or so between Thundercats, YJ, GLTAS, Korra, and sometimes lone wars if I can't get in HD but why don't you do HD releases?  Is it because you don't get CN HD?  Anyway, keep up the great releases and hopefully Beware the Batman is actually good or CN pulls their head out their ass and changes their mind on YJ and GL for next season."
[V],{C_P},2013-03-17T03:04Z,"The person that capping dont have the HD channel or a HD cap card.
We can only hope that they do get around and do new seasons for both YJ and GL at some point."
,ImmaDLStf,2013-03-17T04:50Z,I'll miss this show :(
[V],GunningHawk90,2013-03-17T05:39Z,"{C_P},

Finally, I'm gonna miss this show :("
,Expedio,2013-03-17T06:24Z,Thanks C_P
,r3mzZ,2013-03-17T07:32Z,"I want a new season.. one that end`s with Savages death :D

...am I asking too much?"
,ScottyD7421,2013-03-17T08:29Z,"Thanks for the upload {C_P}, much appreciated.

And can i say it's about fraggin' time you manned up and told those ungrateful mutha fuckers who whine about your releases yet still download every week to go fuck themselves (well sort of). Good 2 c.

Cheers M8"
,Krulag77,2013-03-17T12:08Z,thanx
,Lobe44,2013-03-17T12:33Z,I will just wait for Loadstones release. Not gonna watch in 240p like it is 2002....
,LeBob,2013-03-17T14:11Z,"Thanks for sharing this with us - don't mind the haters, they are not contributing anything."
,AGENT_ENCORE,2013-03-17T17:04Z,wanted more!
,sthasan,2013-03-17T18:19Z,Thanks C_P your uploads are solid
,Drippar,2013-03-17T21:29Z,Wait.. is this the last season?
,halfday28,2013-03-17T23:18Z,"@ Drippar, last season and last episode.  CN cancelled because of poor merchandise sales.

Cheers for the upload CP.  Looks like I'm back to watching re-runs of Justice League and X-men animated until CN realeased another decent cartoon. "
,pontist,2013-03-18T02:11Z,I wanted to avoid watching one of these shitty {C_P} caps but it seems there are no alternatives. Oh well.
,namrepus1,2013-03-18T06:14Z,"Thanks for all of your uploads and time you spend for all of us, I enjoy watching these with my son. Much appreciated.

All the people bitching about quality and this and that why dont you upload these with better quality and such for us? No? Then STFU! Seriously. No need to bite the hands that feeds us. You guys may not like these but most of us do and we appreciate it. You dont like then dont download and dont even bother coming to his section if you dont like his uploads anyway........ must be women..... bitching just to bitch."
,netmafia,2013-03-18T07:04Z,RIP Young Justice. This is the last you'll see them. Stupid CN for cancelling for no reason.
,Archangelx00,2013-03-18T07:05Z,"A = 8
V = 7

There.  That's all ya really need to write, people."
,shawnmurthy,2013-03-18T07:55Z,NOT CARTOON NETWORK MARVEL STOPPED THE SHOW LIKE ALL OTHER GOOD SHOWS MARVEL RUINS THEM IDK Y BUT THEY DO
,sun1995,2013-03-18T12:28Z,i always watch http://thepiratebay.sx/user/loadstone2k12/ 's uploads cuz they are HD but i dont have a choice 
,sun1995,2013-03-18T12:29Z,wtever at least there's cp's upload 
,Matiladir,2013-03-18T14:02Z,"First, C_P, thanks for the upload. I appreciate the time and quickness.

Second, I agree with above. I normally go with loadstone2k12 as well for this. 

Third, it's 2013. There's no reason for a SD file to be low quality. I downloaded this just so I could watch it IN CASE a HD copy doesnt get released today 3/17.

A - 8
V - 7

Sorry, it looks like an ex-rental from Blockbuster. C_P, I noticed you said the capper doesnt have HD. While I dont have any torrents on TPB (because it's an open tracker), could I recommend finding someone who does and can release quickly?

Again, thanks."
,Lobe44,2013-03-18T17:39Z,Welp its Monday and no Loadstone release so I guess this is my only alternative. This 2013 FFS. Why do all of your releases look like they are ripped off a VHS from 1984?
,humza100,2013-03-18T18:20Z,Looks like Loadstones is up
[T],MrDowntown,2013-03-18T23:35Z,"Quality of video/audio was poorer than Id prefer.

Quality of episode. All I can say is ""Those Mother F#@kers! - Better renew this show."""
,Heromist,2013-03-19T04:50Z,"Cancellation of young justice is fucking bullshit...
i mean really, whats the point?
to put new things on?
Why cant they take the garbage thats on cartoon network and work something out?"
,Matiladir,2013-03-19T14:12Z,"Yall dont read?

Young Justice was canceled because of low merchandise sales. Wanna blame someone? Blame Mattel, they dont care about any toyline that isnt Matty Collector Exclusive.

Series 4 of YJ got such a sparse release, brand new figures, like Artemis is $100 on eBay. Superman is $30. But you can find Aqualad and Kid Flash on clearance isles for $3"

,Realalist,2013-03-24T18:23Z,I will forever miss this show. The creators said that the fight is not over yet and the tweets help. #Save YoungJustice
