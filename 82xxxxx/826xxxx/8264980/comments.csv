[T],vonRicht,2013-05-06T03:38Z,"NOTE: I've just found out, randomly, that this movie and 3 other of all my torrents ever uploaded that the soundtrack is encoded as DTS 1509 kbps instead of DTS-HD MA as I thought.

Everything else in the film file is working as my usual.

Sorry for the inconvenience and I hope you can live with ""only"" the DTS 1509 kbps

The 3 other movies is:

1. American.Gangster.Unrated.Extended.Edition.2007.Bluray.1080p.DTS-HD.x264-Grym

2. The.Thing.1982.Bluray.1080p.DTS-HD.x264-Grym

3. Phone.booth.2003.Bluray.1080p.DTS-HD.x264-Grym

Cheers
