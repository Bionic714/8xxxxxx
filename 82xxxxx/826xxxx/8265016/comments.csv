This movie was recorded from a Boston Massachusetts television station in the U.S.A. Please forgive me for stating American Movie Classics as the original source of this video. I wish the picture quality was better, broadcast television was strictly analog back in the early 1980's and analog video was prone to video noise also called snow."
