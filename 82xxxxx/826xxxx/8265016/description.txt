History:

I have failed to find a copy of this movie out there anywhere on the web, so I have decided to share the one and only copy that I have available of this motion picture.

Issues with this copy of the movie:

This copy has inferior picture quality and I will explain why this is the case. 


This movie was originally copied from American Movie Classics to VHS video tape back in the 1980's using ELP (6 Hour) speed.

I transfered it to DVD+R DVD disc using a Magnavox ZV457MG9 VCR/DVD recorder combo unit.

The result is a slight green discoloration on 2% of the right side of the picture and noticeable traces of Analog 'snow' in the picture quality.

Sound is perfect though.

Since this DVD image was divided up into 4 separate VOB files and was converted to  Audio Video Interface (.AVI) you may notice a slight blank black pause during this transformation since the AVI is a continuous stream.

The end result is the video with the following audio/video properties:

Video:

In Color

903 Kbps

320X240

Aspect Ratio: 4:3

29.970 fps

I hope that even though this copy of 3 Ring Circus is not of high resolution HD quality, it helps to fill everyone's library of Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin movies. ;-)
