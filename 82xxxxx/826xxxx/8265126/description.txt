Drugs Inc Drug Kings of New York
New York City is in the grip of a heroin epidemic, as a new generation of middle-class suburbanite dealers hooked on prescription pills switch to heroin, and venture down the Long Island Expressway dubbed the Heroin Highway into urban Brooklyn and Queens to get their fix. A customs agent questions a suspect attempting to smuggle 70 pellets of cocaine in his stomach. Mr. Fence sells over 35 kinds of high grade drugs to Manhattan's wealthy bankers and socialites.
Drugs: A multi-billion-dollar industry that fuels crime and violence like no other substance on the planet. Turning cartel leaders into billionaires, the illegal drug industry also provides vital income to hundreds of thousands of poor workers across the globe. While some users sacrifice their lives to an addiction they can't escape, others find drugs to be their only saving grace from physical or emotional pain almost impossible to overcome.
