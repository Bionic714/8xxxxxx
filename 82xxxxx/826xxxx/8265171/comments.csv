,Phoenix70,2013-05-12T07:38Z,"Felicia, get a video player like VLC and download the video codecs if necessary...
Peace and love, E:)"
,Phoenix70,2013-05-12T07:43Z,"If that doesn't do it, maybe your machine isn't fast enough to play HD 720p videos...
In which case dl the smaller 350mb avi videos, they will play on almost any machine...
Take care, thanx for the interest, E:)"

help?"
,Phoenix70,2013-05-19T23:26Z,"Hi there, okay just let it go until it is completed.
If you stop halfway, the videos won't work because it isn't being downloaded in order.
The torrents come in pieces until all the pieces are put together and a complete video is usable.
If you want to view a specific video before the rest are downloaded, then right click on that video in the second window and make the priority of that video higher than the rest.
Then wait for it to become 100% done.
You can then watch that one video.
But, don't move it until the whole torrent is finished or it will stop downloading.
Okay, have fun... E:)"
,TROLLRA,2013-05-30T01:25Z,PLEASE SEED!!! I've been downloading for two weeks and I am only 77% done...
