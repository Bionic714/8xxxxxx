,wintersbutterfly,2013-03-17T00:06Z,I started listening to the Foo Fighters just a few years ago. I like David Grohl. I had little knowledge of the bands relationship to Nirvana. I just liked their music. And when I began to realize who they where I began to understand how at least to me his music seems to embrace life.
,wintersbutterfly,2013-03-17T04:10Z,I finally am able to upload. Why I am unsure. I disabled Peer Blocker which I just recently started using. It doesn't explain why it wouldn't originally Seed. But is seeding. It embarrasses me to upload just tracks of me singing against another artists voice. But that is what I prefer is singing against another voice. I hope soon to accompany them with my guitar and piano. It will take awhile.
,wintersbutterfly,2013-03-17T04:23Z,And then again it seems to just stop. I am not familiar enough to know how to read the information BitSpirit or uTorrent. An I see numerous seeds an just wonder how they got there case i do not show them any downloads except maybe one or two when I first load the program.
,wintersbutterfly,2013-03-20T04:38Z,"I don't know that I'll put anything else up. I hope I didn't insult anyone about slighting the issues that followed Kurt Cobain's death. I have a friend who knows all the details that followed his death. For me it just really hurt when he died. It was like some of the color went out of the world. I don't think music is the same these days. For me when I was around in the 80's the music I listened to kind of defined. I don't see that much in music these days. I see it in the Foo Fighters and in Courtney Love and the Red Hot Chilli Peppers and few others. I wrote a line once that in the 60's rock defied the past. And in the drug music of 70's rock forgot the past. In the 80's Punk denied the future. And now...we have become that future.
I am going to post one last song and then I will wait until I can get my guitar and piano decent again. I was hurt so badly as a child. And it is so difficult to get these things back. "
