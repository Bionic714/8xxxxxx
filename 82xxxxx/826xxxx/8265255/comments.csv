,fixxxerKH202,2013-03-17T01:36Z,only went a few minutes in so far and it's shaky with some background noise. Looks plenty watchable to me though.
,fixxxerKH202,2013-03-17T01:37Z,forgot to say thanks for the work.
,dgcash,2013-03-17T01:40Z,a/v 3/5 - Not bad for a cam but the guy that recorded the video is a terrible mouth breather and it sounds like darth vader having an asthmatic seizure throughout the movie.
,dgcash,2013-03-17T01:41Z,Thanks for the up though.
,notuboo,2013-03-17T02:25Z,"It is a cam. Off screen and out of focus at times. Good audio for a cam with some echoing at a few spots.

Overall A7/V5 for a cam. It is watchable and the price you pay to watch it is....."

[V],globeplus,2013-03-17T13:38Z,"Lament to disapoint the users that thik that was me shooting the cam ... of course all of us expect the best cam recording as possible but sometimes unfornatly here and there the shooting maybe not so good as that ... in this case was the extra dispensable noise , some other cases is the walk of the people on the cinema or the angle of the shooting ... well all the recordings are welcome independtly of this things that can happen and what it is important is to watch the movies sooner as possible expecting of course better shooting cams or dvd rips soon as possible too , just free sharing videos watchers life ... see all of you around and happy movies to all of you ."
,ty2uppers,2013-03-17T16:14Z,"Thanx a lot Globe.. I have not d/l the file yet but will be. I'm sorry for all the freeloading ass wipes that download your files and then complain like they got ripped off. If they don't wont ""bad quality"" then they are the dumb asses for downloading cams. Any idiot knows that some or most early cams are not perfect. They are for people like them that don't wont to pay cinema prices. Thanks again for your work it is greatly appreciated. All of the scumbag complainers get off your asses and put on a pair of balls(borrow some) and pay cinema prices and use your fancy hd camera to record a good copy just so you can upload it for free for the rest of us.Bunch of idgets.."
,Binks92,2013-03-17T18:20Z,"Ok just finished watching, sry for the delay. Good video with some out of focus moments. 10 first minutes, he adjusts a lot and 5 last minutes there's a head in the bottom left corner. Overall still very watchable. For the audio, kinda good for a cam though we can hear the guy breath a lot of times.

Overall I give A8V6"
,ChasUGC,2013-03-18T00:14Z,"A=2, V=2. I like to watch a movie from beginning to end. I got dizzy after 30 seconds and had to quit. The sound here is very distorted and the video is out of focus and moving around too much. Still, thanks for the early release. I'll wait for a better copy though."
,igoturback,2013-03-18T03:37Z,"they take this garbage and put their tag on it.its the same crap one floating around ,at least try using a new card or tape"

[V],globeplus,2013-03-18T14:37Z,"Hi again and this comment is to make analysis in a couple of points ... first i would like to say that the users knows by now that reference to links to paid sites is strictly forbidden on this site , really different from many other torrent files sites that don´t mind to have torrents with codec files that people needs to register in order to watch the movie or links to this kind of registered sites  where the users also have to pay to watch , this site is without any doubt a real free sharing files site where the users don´t feel fouled trying to get torrents files to pass the time ... this is the truly spirit of sharing ...
The other points is to thank you who participate on this site thinking on this same way that i refered wanting only a free sharing file system freely to the users and the other is to suggest to who have some time something that can improve about 10 to 20% the noise reduction on the audio , using for example after audio extraction the Audacity (freeware) to use the function noise removal that in fact will reduce a bit the extra dispensable noise giving a little bit more clear audio to the viewer but this is just a suggestion for who don´t mind to spare some time improving the audio for this particular cam ...
Ok , that´s all from me on this comment and happy files to all of you , see you all around ..."
,wolfengod,2013-03-18T15:42Z,"I wanted to say Thank You Globe for spending your time and uploading the movie, as for the people complaining about the quality...then go buy a ticket and see it in the theatre or wait for the dvd. You get what you pay for :)"
[V],globeplus,2013-03-18T18:53Z,"I want to explain a little better what i meaned with the observation about the reference to paid sites in torrent files or links in comments , on this particular file was already at least 2 comments removed with the designated type of links and i tought that an observation about this procedure maked sense just to don´t give any doubts to the users that writed the comments with the links , normally the comment stay for a while until a dear piratebay moderator read the comment and remove him and i confess that i don´t know exactly if the infractors of this type of procedure got the IP blocked here at piratebay or not but the point is that it is not allowed this type of comment and like i said at least the removing happen with normality , please on this site evitate that type of comments because they are not welcome here and think for yourselfs if any of you like that to need to register in a paid site to watch a new cam video for example in a supposed free sharing files site , getting false torrents or clicking at links that only want to induce the user to register in paid sites to watch the wanted movie and everybody have to agree that it is not the correct philosophy for a free sharing files site . 

Thank you for reading and understand this comment and happy files to all of you ... "
