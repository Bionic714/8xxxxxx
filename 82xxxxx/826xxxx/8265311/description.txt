Therefore the magic is youΓÇÖre tweaking your photos with independent controls. This means that if, for example, you want to tweak the exposure you wonΓÇÖt mess up the photoΓÇÖs vibrancy, or if you want to tweak the sharpness you wonΓÇÖt affect the color etc. Experience the magic of independent controls ΓÇô fine tuning photos in seconds. You can also quickly select another preset to apply automatically to your photo or create your own custom one.

So Perfectly Clear Photoshop Plug-in is all about quick, easy and fast ΓÇô itΓÇÖs all about saving vast amounts of time and putting the fun, and yes profit, back into photography ΓÇª and itΓÇÖs also about getting high quality photos ΓÇô superior photos to any other method. The key is that Perfectly Clear ΓÇÿcorrectsΓÇÖ photos ΓÇô it doesnΓÇÖt ΓÇÿenhanceΓÇÖ photos. A corrected photo is superior to an ΓÇ£enhancedΓÇ¥ photo, and not by a little but by a lot, and hereΓÇÖs why.

There are multiple reasons why a Perfectly Clear photo is superior to other photos. Perfectly Clear reproduces what the eye sees by ΓÇ£adding backΓÇ¥ the eye function that a camera lacks. By better reproducing what the eye sees, Perfectly Clear photos elicit enthusiastic responses from participants, audiences and photographers alike. Photography is the art of eliciting emotion, and Perfectly Clear does it best.

"Cameras donΓÇÖt match human vision. They donΓÇÖt perceive and record depth and dimension information. And they don┬╣t record anywhere near as much "metadata" as we associate with our visual memories. Rising to these capabilities is a huge challenge. But ultimately, whether we realize it or not, we as users expect nothing less from our cameras than to equal what we see with our eyes, and we won┬╣t be satisfied until we get it. In this dawning age of images-as-language, the integrity of visual information, how well it reproduces our perception of reality, and the richness of context associated with it (who, what, when, where and why) are what determines the value of that visual information.
-Alexis Gerard, author of ΓÇ£Going VisualΓÇ¥, and co-founder of 6Sight imaging conferences."

This is only possible because Perfectly Clear applies 10 patented and patent pending processes in a very precise and rigorous way, replicating how the eye gathers light and overcoming the 15 ways your camera distorts your photos. Whether a camera is expensive or off the shelf, it still embodies limitations such as the single aperture which need to be overcome. Perfectly Clear makes its corrections while avoiding the pitfalls that all other editing and enhancement software introduce. And Perfectly Clear ensures quality through the auto ΓÇô correction applying a comprehensive suite of 12 corrections, yet it is ΓÇÿsmartΓÇÖ enough to only apply the ones that a particular photo needs to be improved.

Quality award winning photos demands the three things Perfect Photos need: accurate colors, perfect exposure emulating the human eye and preservation of color nuances and details.
