,executionist,2013-03-17T20:49Z,the french can't read idiot
,Noxxys,2013-03-19T16:34Z,"@saddamlevine @executionist Did you know that some (billion) people are not native English speakers or can't speak it at all? Then yeah, they want to watch movies in their language. You're both narrow-minded morrons (and probably rascist as well)"
,maabaa,2013-03-19T21:06Z,"No he's right, I'm French, we can't read.
We are wondering as well, why all the Hollywood movies are dubbed in English.. Anyone ?"
,saddamlevine,2013-03-24T00:24Z,"Maabaa, you fucking piece of shit. Hollywood movies are not dubbed in English. They're MADE in English.
How would you like to see French films like those made by Cocteau, Renoir and Godard with stupid American voices in English?
The French think they're so 'cultural'....but they're just arrogant illiterate fucks"

MaaBaa is probably not french. He can obviously read (in two languages if he is french). And his comment is entirely facetious. Read between the lines you narrow minded retard."
