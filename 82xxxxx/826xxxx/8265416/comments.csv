I figured out that you need to copy the exact folder into the OBB folder, not just the OBB file itself. That's how to fix the download problem thing.

Your directory structure should look like this:

Android/obb/com.square_enix.android_googleplay.FFIII_GP/main.102.com.square_enix.android_googleplay.FFIII_GP.obb"
