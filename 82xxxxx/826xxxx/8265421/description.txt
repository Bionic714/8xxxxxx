        Internationally acclaimed ventriloquist Nina Conti, takes      
        the bereaved puppets of her mentor and erstwhile lover Ken     
        Campbell on a pilgrimage to 'Venthaven' the resting place      
        for puppets of dead ventriloquists. She gets to know her       
        latex and wooden travelling partners along the way, and        
        with them deconstructs herself and her lost love in this       
        ventriloquial docu-mocumentary requiem. Ken Campbell was a     
        hugely respected maverick of the British Theatre, an           
        eccentric genius who would snort out forgotten artforms.       
        Nina was his prodigy in ventriloquism and has been said to     
        have reinvented the artform. This film is truly unique in      
        genre and style. No one has seen ventriloquism like this       
        before.-
