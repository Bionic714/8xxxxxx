After i Ran Sp12236.exe on each floppy disk, i copied them one by one to save time
for the user instead of typing agree and hitting keys alot lol,

these are unedited copies and work fine, you must copy to floppys, u can boot from cd rom after u go through trouble like me but end up with errors, you are forced
to use floppys, thanks to compaq... so hopefully if your new to these like i am
it took me 6 days to figure out how to get this thing running,
my maching is compaq workstation ap500 550mhz hp site said these should work with 
most of these there wasnt specific on model wise so i figured id throw mine 
in there just in case
