If this is indeed the last episode, I'm super duper pissed.
Quite possible the best superhero cartoon EVER"
,newton8573,2013-03-17T06:50Z,"Thanks for the upload

Horrible ending.

Spoilers ahead

What was with the hand holding the pre-bigbang universe ?!
Christianity reference?! I a sci-fi. Damn it. Leave my tv series alove you horrible religious persons! 

What about needing enough energy to open a time portal to heal a human:ish person ?!

Why didn't the ai deactivate the drones before healing since she knew what would happen. She is said to be smart enough so what gives?

WTF!
Talk about lazy writing!
Even i could have done a better job

The endings always make me disappointed because of this utterly horrible and cheap writing."

,K4YM1K,2013-03-17T21:58Z,"If you didn't get the hand holding the universe, then you need to read a whole lot more DC.
That's how the beginning of time is always done with them."
