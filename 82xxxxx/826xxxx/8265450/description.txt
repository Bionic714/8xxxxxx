 : conflict in Vietnam, the Falkland Islands and other danger zones, Hastings :
 : has a sober, unromantic and realistic view of battle that puts him into a  :
 : different category from the armchair generals whose gung-ho, schoolboy     :
 : attitude to war fills the pages of a great majority of military histories. :
 : He writes with grace, fluency and authority . . . Inferno is superb."      :
