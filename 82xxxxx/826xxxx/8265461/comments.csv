On the top of the installer, the third button from the left has abig letter ""I"" on it and also happens to say INFORMATION on it.
Common sense would say click this button if you haven't a clue what your doing.
If your technical abilities could not extend to figuring that out, then how the hell you expect to be able to install the software let alone know how to use it is beyond me."
