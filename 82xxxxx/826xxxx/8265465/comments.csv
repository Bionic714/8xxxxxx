,msftdoll,2013-03-17T05:13Z,This is a FAKE torrent! This is not the pro version! this is the free one on the app store. The current version of Titanium Backup Pro is 1.2.3. This is fake don't bother
,CashAndPotatoes,2013-03-18T16:11Z,Of course this is a fake. The latest version is 6.0.4 and this retard comes with 6.0.5. lol
,HerpDerpz,2013-03-23T22:53Z,It's legit. 6.0.4 and pro *cracked*. There's no key it just comes pro. The title is most likely a typo as the .apk says 6.0.4 and the description says it's 6.0.4.
,columbuzz,2013-03-26T19:26Z,"I can't understand why people call something 'fake' when they clearly haven't even tried it. This torrent is genuine. Installs version 6.0.4 Pro version (and not 6.0.5 ,must be a typo). Thanks uploader, and sorry that some people are simply can't appreciate free stuffs. "
,Lovecore,2013-03-30T13:35Z,"Yes, the 6.0.5 is a TYPO. I was in a rush to upload it. It is 6.0.4, check the files. Sorry about that!"
,corumuk,2013-04-07T21:27Z,"Upon installing, this version indicates it requires the following *new* permissions

'full permissions to all device features and storage'

not sure why it would require this, the app already has quite extensive permissions and the one above is not listed on the app's homepage.

i cancelled the install in the end, just to be on the safe side."
,corumuk,2013-04-07T22:49Z,"Ignore my previous comment. Checked it out some more and seems to be legit.
"
,msftdoll,2013-04-08T14:31Z,"you people are so dumb. of course i have installed it first before commenting! that's how i found out this is fake! this is legit titanium back up, yes. but this is NOT THE PRO VERSION! I installed it, i opened the LINK provided on the description, and it didn't match the app i just installed. i checked the unpayed version on google play and it said ""installed"". which means clearly, this is NOT pro version like what the torrent title says!"
,gOOglEy03,2013-04-11T14:21Z,Not the pro version. The latest version doesn't match this one.
,corumuk,2013-04-20T12:45Z,"Ok just to clarify, as there seems to be some mistaken information above.

This is version 6.0.4.
This is a patched version, i.e. fully featured. You can see this on the main screen once the app is loaded. The free version has a button in the bottom right which you can click to purchase the full app. This version doesn't because it's already the full version.
Also all the features of the pro version are unlocked such as one click restore of multiple apps etc."
