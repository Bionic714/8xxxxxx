,udumazz,2013-03-19T07:34Z,"Gee Oswega, if your that offended by some dumazz internet comment maybe you should leave the US. (in my most annoying whinny voice) He called someone a bad name....on the internets...should I move out of my country? YES, GET THE FUCK OUT!"
,AXWELL311,2013-03-19T18:42Z,Brendan Fraser is still alive?????
,CarlZeiss,2013-03-20T01:39Z,"udumazz - I'm sure he isn't leaving the country because someone called someone a nigger on the internet.  He's probably leaving because of people like you.  Dumbass.

,bil_gr7,2013-03-23T11:41Z,The movie poster is extremely misleading. Brendan Fraser is hardly the protagonist. The main character is an unknown actor called Martin McCann and strangely he is nowhere to be seen in the poster.
,BBQSource,2013-03-24T10:54Z,"@AXWELL311 I'm more inclined to think they just shoved a stick up his corpses ass and shook him about for 2 hours in an antique shop while filming, then tried to pass it off as a heist film."
,genuinedickies,2013-03-24T23:21Z,"How is Fraser in this? Don't think I've seen him in anything since Scrubs and before that it was all bad comedy... good actor, just never saw him doing movies with automatic weapons."

,SinBin16,2013-05-17T20:49Z,"hey leave crcfail alone..his comments are just misplaced rage due to a condition known as tinypenesa it affects 85%(ballpark estimate it may be greater) of all white males. Symptoms include: Being a Dickhead, Insecurity, Violent Outbursts, and Anal Leakage from the Mouth. See he read ""Small Time Robbery"" and it flared up the condition but there is a cure! Get yourself a midget bro...SMALL Hands P.S the movie not that good A8 V8 M3 thx for the upload tho"
