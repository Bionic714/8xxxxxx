I Downloaded the following torrent and added only the missing tracks that were not released via iTunes. The torrent is redistributed as it was, nothing else than the tracks was added (or taken, for that matter). The Artist, Genre and Album metadata correspond with the following torrent for consistency.

  25. The World Is Mind
  26. Children From The War
  27. Requiem For Destruction
  28. The Colonel

Wikipedia lists 30 tracks instead of 29. The missing one is "Freedom Fighters" from the Nemesis album. It was positioned after Ocean Kingdom, but the numbers were shifted for consistency. If you want it, download Nemesis.

NOTE: The additions were recorded with Audacity via ALSA + pulseaudio from the soundcard. The uploader's upload rate is extremely low. Some people with more bandwidth must seed if this torrent is not to die early, thank you in advance.
