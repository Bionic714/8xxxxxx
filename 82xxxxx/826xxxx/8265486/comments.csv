I'll be posting lil wayne's discography when I'm not a human being 2 drops along with hot boys birdman drake nicki minaj Big Tymers and tyga's discography. That's the the only lil wayne album Im waiting on. I'll be posting his official mixtapes in that torrent as well. Be on the lookout for it.

By the way, can you upload Nina Nesbitt's discography as well as the discography of 5 Seconds of Summer ? 

Another request : I noticed that tracks 23-26 are missing from Fearless (Platinum edition) do you think you can do anything about it ? The same exact thing happened in another torrent too, and I have been looking for these everywhere in order to complete my collection. 

If you could do any of the above, it would be amazing of you ! If you don't, it's ok, I understand. Thanks in advance ! Keep up the good work."
