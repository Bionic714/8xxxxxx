This is the only album from the 1970 duo "Attila", consisting of Billy Joel and Jon Small. By now, most people know that this album is usually made out to be one of, if not the, worst Rock album of all time, but we all know there's worse out there...a lot worse (I'm looking at you 1989's "Dylan & The Dead" and 1978's "Love Beach"). 

Anyway, I find this album to be kind of fun to listen to, especially "Amplifier Fire", so thought I'd share a decent quality version for everyone.

P.S. - Even if it isn't one of the worst Rock albums of all time, it surely ranks high among the worst album artwork of all time.
