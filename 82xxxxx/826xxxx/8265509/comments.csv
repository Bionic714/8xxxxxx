,samstripe,2013-03-22T07:50Z,Thanks!  I'll seed for as long as I can.  I have audio probs though.  There's no sound on disc 1.
[T],SCSA420,2013-03-23T06:55Z,"The sound is AC3 on disc 1 and 2 and AAC on extras.

Try this: To ensure that you can get proper playback be sure you have installed the K-lite codec pack full version or mega version both of which comes with Media Player Classic Home Cinema and during the installation setup make sure to select all audio and video file types which will configure it properly for .mp4 and .mkv playback. If you do not have it you can get it here below: 

http://www.free-codecs.com/download/K_Lite_Codec_Pack.htm 

Once installed you can playback .mp4 and .mkv files with the following players:

Media Player Classic or Windows Media Player. 

I hope that helps out or if you have a BluRay player (LG, Samsung or Philips) that can play .mp4 files they will play it fine as I have tested on my 3 BluRay players and my LG 3D Smart tv from my 16 GB USB flash drive as well as burning the files onto a DVD +R DL disc"
,samstripe,2013-03-23T11:50Z,thanks
