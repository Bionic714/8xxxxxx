,aarque,2013-06-07T16:18Z,"please can you say from where came this collection? Here are two 3d artists who publish models from your torrent and claim credit:

Both models were published before the folders in your torrent were .rar'd, which occurred on 3/10/2010; a fact that implies this collection was kicking around intact for some time. I would just like to know if either artist had any part in any of the models in this collection. I have seen the name ""Mike Kane"" credited in some of the artists' reviews.
