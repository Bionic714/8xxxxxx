,maiolo,2013-03-17T04:50Z,"hey loadstone2k12, can you please just correct the torrent name, i used to search for ""teenage mutant ninja turtles 2012"" for the episodes, and i wasnt finding this one.

thanks

PS:anyway i'll wait for the 1080p version"
[T],loadstone2k12,2013-03-17T06:15Z,"This episode is not yet available on iTunes, so we don't have a 1080p version.

I made a mistake when naming the files and I can't rename the torrents. I apologize for that."
,mark_mark,2013-03-17T10:04Z,whatever happened to the '720p WEB-DL x264 AAC' format?
[T],loadstone2k12,2013-03-17T12:01Z,@mark_mark I can't do until the episode becomes available in the iTunes Store.
,mark_mark,2013-03-17T12:21Z,"@loadstone2k12 oh, i hope you upload that format too. I much preferred that format.

BTW, I'm a huge fan of your uploads.

,Redstar2613,2013-03-18T17:30Z,"nastypants, it's the truth. 6791lm is not a troll just for telling the truth. ]"
,EdgeKamui,2013-03-18T20:01Z,Is there going to be a 720p.WEB-DL.x264.AAC.mp4 version?
,SheriffJR,2013-03-24T02:08Z,"Thanks for the upload.  Just a hint: I, personally, just search 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' and then sort the torrents by most seeders and the newest episodes always are towards the top.  So even if the title has the wrong date you'll find what you need.  So its really not even a big deal that the date is wrong, I didn't even notice.  Just saw the complaining in the comments."
