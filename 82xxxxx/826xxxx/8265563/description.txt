Writing in an approachable and anecdotal style, Tom Wright helps us to see the pastoral nature of these letters. Paul is anxious to see that those who profess the faith should allow the gospel to transform the whole of their lives, right down to the deepest part of their personality, and is concerned that every teacher of the faith should know how to build up the community in mutual support, rather than tearing it apart through the wrong sort of teaching and behavior.

Tom Wright has undertaken a tremendous task: to provide guides to all the books of the New Testament, and to include in them his own translation of the entire text. Each short passage is followed by a highly readable discussion, with background information, useful explanations and suggestions, and thoughts as to how the text can be relevant to our lives today. A glossary is included at the back of the book. The series is suitable for group study, personal study, or daily devotions.
