,Prokodile,2013-03-17T15:30Z,"Afraid I have to concur with linny for the XviD rip of this week's ep as well. I think proper a/v sync started off at ~-100ms, then jumped to 0ms, then 120ish ms, then all the way to 500-800ms, probably in between arc/ad break intervals. For some reason, this rip's framerate was unusual too at 29.97fps vs the more usual 23.98fps and there's visible jitter frames due to the lack of pulldown. Can't help wonder if it's all related to a recent change in recording setup or something like that :s...

Anyway, musings aside, many thanks for providing the rips, loadstone; much appreciated as always."
