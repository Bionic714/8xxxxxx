Based on the 1971 novel, which was in turn based upon a case of a real-life possession in a Washington Suburn, The Exorcist tells the story of a 12 year old daughter of a visiting actress who begins to exhibit out-of-character strange and frightening behaviour such as levitation and incredible strength. When all medical avenues have been taken the mother is sent to seek advice from a priest who is also qualified as a psychologist. He determines that the daughter is the victim of demonic possession and employs the help of a second priest to attempt to banish the evil spirit and save the young girl.
