[T],TxJag,2013-03-17T06:43Z,"@Hellhound123 more than likely I won't. As I'm planning a few big things in the coming weeks. So as far as requests go, unless I have an absolute interest than its probably not going to happen. I'm sorry."
,Hellhound123,2013-03-17T07:23Z,"Well thanks anyway. Keep uploading whenever you want, that's all any one can ask."
