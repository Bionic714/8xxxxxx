F1 2013 Melbourne, Australia

My apologies for the lateness of this 1st practice Session, but both recording and encoding problems has delayed things quite a bit. Nevertheless here it is... Finally :cheers:

Coverage of the 1st Practice Session for the Melbourne GP Live from SKY SPORTS F1 HD. To reduce SKY's LIVE sync errors with audio during add-breaks,
the commercials have been left intact as removing them can cause considerable encoding and playback problems as the live stream switches from Dolby Digital
to standard stereo output during add breaks and then back, which plays havoc with encoding the feed as AC3 Digital.

To keep file sizes to a minimum, the video has been scaled from 1080p source down to 720p. High Profile 3.1 has been used to cut down on encoding times.

All torrents for F1 2013 will be encoded to MKV format with 720p resolution & AC3 Dolby Digital Audio. These video files should play smoothly with the standard
media players such as VLC, WMP, KM Player, WMC, MP-HC.

**For those having mkv playback issues on Windows 7 or 8, I recommend Shark Codec Packs which are available free here:
