,Raz0rd,2013-03-17T12:54Z,Instructions are pretty wrong.. do i have to launch steam in order to play the game because when i launch it from the Junkies client the games launches goes in a Blac screen and then it Shutdowns any solution?
[T],aviara,2013-03-17T13:13Z,"You have a shortcut on you desktop, run the game from it"
,KineziSuGamad,2013-03-17T13:39Z,you dont need lunch steam Junkies client do it go to their website and look video turitorial step by step and you cant fail after you see that )
,ss3rj,2013-03-17T13:57Z,I have the same problem as Raz0rd. I did every step but no luck. When I enter the game the screen goes black about 5 sec and then... nothing! Ohh x(
,ss3rj,2013-03-17T14:01Z,for me doesn't work! :|
[T],aviara,2013-03-17T14:37Z,"W8 like max 1 min on that black screen, it will open the game, don`t close it don`t do nothing leave the computer in peace.... :) same thing happend to me when i tested it"
,ss3rj,2013-03-17T15:41Z,well i wait but game close after the black screen. 
[V],Gh0stNet,2013-03-17T15:47Z,"@toALL
the black appears and your game crashes because you have not generated a client.dll file for your self which is unique for every user  so when u download the game with junkies client u have to patch it (look for button on junkies client)(meaning generate a unique client.dll for yourself ) so that u can play it ."
[T],aviara,2013-03-17T16:27Z," @Gh0stNet 
Yes you are right 
@toALL,

For the game to fully working follow this steps: 1. Run ""JunkiesClient.exe"" from your CS:GO directory
2. Click on the ""Log On...""-Button and Login or Register
3. (Optional) Wait for your Turn in Queue
4. Click on the Patch
5. After finishing, click on the ""Patch""-Button
6. (Optional) Change your Nickname and/or Create a Shortcut
7. Start the Game via Shortcut or Launcher
8. Have Fun  "
[V],Gh0stNet,2013-03-17T16:54Z,"@aviara 
yes i know.people now a days dont read but always complain and expect that there game should work 

P.S if any one of u want the junkies client and want to download the game directly from there server then use this torrent http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8151680/Counter_Strike_Global_Offensive_Online_PROPER_CRACKED-Junkies 
and if not then download this torrent this will work too "
,Raz0rd,2013-03-17T19:16Z,It wasn't hard to add the part about client.dll right? jeez not everyone on the net knows where to search for help nad that is why the complain most of the time
[V],Gh0stNet,2013-03-17T19:55Z,"@Raz0rd
aviara made that mistake but look at my torrent description and people comments you will know they are complaining about the same dam thing "
,Raz0rd,2013-03-17T22:30Z,"After waiting few hours of that DAMN que line clicked patch it did something in which i have no idea what it was i clicked play.... black screen and CRASH.....

Seriously this sucks "
,johnnyl11,2013-03-18T02:43Z,junkies client is junk no matter how well you can read directions
,johnnyl11,2013-03-18T02:45Z,bunch of freakin liars. junkies doesnt work it's trash and so is this torrent
,Abaris777,2013-03-18T09:50Z,"I followed EACH instruction but when i click on the shortcut it crashes saying:
 This game requires Steam!

plz help"
,johnnyl11,2013-03-18T12:04Z,this is fake it does not work. the ones who say it does are liars. it loads a whole bunch of adware crap on your computer and all you get is black screen then crash.
,johnnyl11,2013-03-18T12:20Z, this guy has a whole bunch of crap torrents none of which have more than 60 seeders because they are all crap virus infected bullshit. he makes up names and makes comments on his own torrents to make you think the ones who say it doesn't work are just stupid or something. so if you want a bunch of malware go ahead and install this.
[T],aviara,2013-03-18T16:59Z,"For fully working this game follow this steps:

,airlonk,2013-03-24T09:14Z,"after several times trying finally it works!
the instruction is quite stupid and dumb.
this is how i do it
1st - install the game to CS-GO folder.
2nd - install Junkies Client to the same folder (CS-GO).
3rd - start Junkies Client and click ""update"".
4th - log on to junkies client (if you dont have any account you have to register at their site 1st).
5th - wait for your queue and please be patient coz it will take a while.
6th - after the updates are finished you may have to restart the junkies client again and click ""patch"".
7th - you may have to log on to junkies client again and wait for your queue again. as i said, please be patient coz it will take a while.
8th - after the patch is done then you may change your nickname or language. and then click play.
9th - the screen will go blank around 30second or more and then the game will start.

that is how i able to play it. 
if it did not work for you i am sorry.
maybe you just have to buy the originals"
,airlonk,2013-03-24T09:27Z,"sorry. i forgot to tell you that this torrent did not have the Junkies Client installer. you can download it here:
http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8151680/Counter_Strike_Global_Offensive_Online_PROPER_CRACKED-Junkies"
,Bebruss,2013-03-29T10:17Z,"When i try to log on to the Junkies Client it says there's an update then it fills the status bar and then takes me to the junkies client again, nothing happens and install/update button is not highlighted/unclickable

Please help"
,roshanraj,2013-03-30T12:03Z,"Just Made An Account Here To Tell You Guys That This Torrent is Working, Thanks a Lot Aviara
These are the Steps which I did :-
1.] Install the .exe file
2.] After Installation go to the installed directory, & search for JunkiesClient.exe
3.] Then Open JunkiesClient.exe (For Win7 users, Right click on junkiesclient.exe , Go to compatibility tab, & check the run as administrator, then Open).
4.] Then register yourself & then log in.
5.] Then click Install/Update, you would be in a queue, please be patient until your turn comes.
6.] When your turn comes, It will check the files and give the update if necessary for some files.
7.] After this, click on Patch, It will download the client.dll & all the other stuffs.
8.] After this enter you nick & create a shortcut. (For Win7 users, Right click on the shortcut icon on the desktop, Go to compatibility tab, & check the run as administrator)
9.] Double Click the Icon on the Desktop, Wait a few seconds, Then enjoy playing.
