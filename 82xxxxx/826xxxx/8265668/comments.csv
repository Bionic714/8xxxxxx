I will cap the UFC 158 Prelims on FX, but I won’t be able to cap UFC 158 for you guys unless you help me here. It’s $60. All I need is $10 from six of you, or $5 from twelve of you! I know we can do it, guys! There’s hundreds of thousands of people downloading my files each UFC event, and the reason is because you know I bring quality, so how about it? If someone donates the full $60 I will even do everyone a favor and cap the event in full quality 1080i for die hard HD fans! If I receive any extra donations, they will strictly be going to my monthly medication as I am not well  and suffer from many health issues and cannot afford to take care of myself, so you’ll also be helping me out big time! I will also use it for future UFC events if the amount far exceeds the PPV goal of $60! So if you’re not helping now, you’re helping in the future to cap UFC PPV! Have I ever let you guys down before? Be a part of spreading quality MMA! Send your donation by going to (check site for this part) and I will give you guys the best and fastest upload on the internet, as always! If the link doesn’t work, just send your donations to the email address (check site again)"
