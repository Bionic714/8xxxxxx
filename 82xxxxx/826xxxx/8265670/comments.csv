,Torporo,2013-03-17T03:38Z,"Thnx a bunch, yours is downloading nicely, unlike some other torrent of the Q2 & Q3 on TPB!"
,eption,2013-03-17T03:40Z,"@bmcghie it is legit, don't worry :) It's also the first torrent I post! I know how much that wait from yesterday's postponed race sucked!"
,bmcghie,2013-03-17T03:47Z,"Well the opening looks legit. Wicked, thanks! Nice quality as well."
,youwrong,2013-03-17T05:05Z,"Yup, it's legit."
,obsidianshadow,2013-03-17T05:17Z,"Yes, legit copy. Great quality, everyone seed as the last 10% was very slow"
,youwrong,2013-03-17T05:58Z,BTW thanks eption! Quality upload. Will seed to show my appreciation
,partsey,2013-03-17T10:09Z,What abt 1080p?
,ginbong,2013-03-17T11:04Z,Thanks for the upload. Great quality. There is no 15 minute build-up and no post pole interviews and usual Sky post discussions that normally occur on Sky broadcasts in this upload not that I know if they DID do post quali discussions.. Will download footy's version just to see if there was any post quali discussions as I love the former F1 driver's insights.
,driss_lahlou,2013-03-17T11:15Z,Thx for the upload .. plz you gonna upload the race ?
,ginbong,2013-03-17T11:34Z,"footy's upload does indeed go 27m50s longer after eption's cap ends and is 15 minutes longer before the start too. If video quality is more important than the expert discussions, this upload is for you as footy's is 352p only. I personally prefer footy's though."
