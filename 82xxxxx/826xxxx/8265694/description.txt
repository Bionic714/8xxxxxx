On the run, Jimbo is cornered in a local curio shop, where he takes hostage an assortment of colorful characters, including Maguire, who may be his illegitimate father. Surrounded by the Police, the SAS, and the Mobster’s crew, the young man must find a way out of his precarious predicament with the help of his oddball captives.
