[T],micron66,2013-03-17T10:31Z,"Question:

why is this encoded at 59 fps ? Tv shows are generally encoded at 23/25 fps.

For some reason all the matches that i download with 59 fps keep stuttering on my laptop,finally my whole system slows down and CPU usage shoots to 100 %.These are all 480p vids i'm talking about,not 720p.

Anyone know why ?"
