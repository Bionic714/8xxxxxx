ORIGINAL TITLE; Sette Baschi Rossi

ENGLISH WITH HARD-CODED GREEK SUBTITLES

Deep in the African Congo, revolution rages and explosive documents have fallen 
into the hands of nationalist guerillas. The Red Berets are the governments only 
hope of retrieving papers which could change the course of the war.

This is another of the lost Macaroni Combat films and deals with the Congo 
Crisis ('66-'67).  It's not too bad of a film, being something of a cross 
between Dark of the Sun and Zulu Dawn. starring Dale Cummings (Battle of the 
Damned), Ivan Rassimov (of various Eurotrash films of dubious distinction), 
Sieghardt Rupp (Der Bockerer, A Fistful of Dollars), Arthur Brauss (Cross of 
Iron) and a whole host of Macaroni Combat regulars.

Now the bad news:  This film is virtually impossible to lay hands on.  I have 
never seen it available.  This one has hard-coded Greek subtitles.  It is also 
from a DVD which was apparently made from a video.  The video itself has one or 
two tracking issues, mostly near the end of the film, plus some regular 
sparkling and a little color wash on the right hand side.  I had to crop the 
bottom of the film to get rid of spurious video trash.  It appears that whoever 
made this with the Greek subtitles blacked out a little bit of the bottom of the 
screen, probably so the subtitles that were there could be replaced with the 
Greek ones.  Thankfully the subtitles are sparse and mostly unobtrusive.

Now for the audio.  It's actually quite good but for an annoying crosstalk issue 
in the right channel.  If you have the volume high, during quiet parts, you will 
hear what appears to be a BBC documentary on gorillas at a low-level in the 
right channel.  The irony of this is not lost on me. ;-)  Can't be helped and 
there is a special place in Hell for the imbecile who allowed this to creep on 
to the audio track.

I therefore have to give the film an A/V rating of 7.5 and 9 respectively.

Due to the rarity of this one, I believe collectors will still be happy.

If you find a better copy out there or happen across a DVD, even in the original 
Italian, good lord man, put it up for the rest of us!

Thanks and enjoy!
