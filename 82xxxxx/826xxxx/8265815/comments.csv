AutoKMS and the default activate option in MTK does not support more than one Office install.

It WILL activate more than one Office, but you have to call all the right activation commands. The script covers it."

I've realized there are some things I prefer in Office 2010 so I would like to load that to my computer too.  If I download this torrent for 2010, will it conflict with the other?  Thanks a lot!"
