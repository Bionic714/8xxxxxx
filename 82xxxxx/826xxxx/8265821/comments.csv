[V],murphy78,2013-03-17T05:59Z,"TY.

If anyone wants to install both Office 2013 and Office 2010, you need to use the KMS Server Service from MTK and the script in the link I have in the description for activation. AutoKMS and the default activate option in MTK does not support more than one Office install.

It WILL activate more than one Office, but you have to call all the right activation commands. The script covers it."

,thegameksk,2013-03-18T03:03Z,Can anyone explain how exactly I update this? I installed and activated office fine but am confused as to how I go about updating. Thanks!
[V],murphy78,2013-03-18T04:04Z,"thegame, start windows update by using winkey+r then typing wuapp

Now click the ""Find out more"" button in the section where it says something about updating for other programs.

Now accept the terms and choose an update option. I recommend just installing important updates, then going back into settings in wuapp and changing it back to disabled so I can manually update things; but that's just a personal preference."

,frahuha,2013-03-29T02:05Z,"hey murphy, I've installed office and didn't need to use toolkit. When I run office, in options it says version is unlicensed but there's no mention of any expiry date. Is there anything more I need to do?"

,blueais,2013-04-05T15:22Z,"hi murphy... what about... if my windows is activated before, so.. whether activation of this office will have an effect on windows?, eg windows activation will be lost or must re-activation again? thanks a lot.."
,krixx,2013-04-07T06:52Z,"@murphy78

I Love Black Theme of Office 2010,

But Unfortunately Black Theme is not Provided In Office 2013.

Is There Any Way To Add Black Theme In Office 2013?
