Basically, what you have here is a beautiful MSDN ProPlus VL source
and it has an updates folder. You can't simply toss the exe files
from MS Download Center in the folder, but you can extract those files
with 7-zip and then copy the en-US and the none.MSP files to there.
You also have to add any proofing Spanish and French files or Update
nags you.

And that's exactly what I've done. These are all of the MSP files
contained in MOST of the KB exe files available for download. There
are still a few ones that don't have any MSP file inside, but
they are very small. The non-MSP kb files total about 1-2megs on
Microsoft Download. Those, you can do yourself. I cannot
pre-integrate those without making a fully custom install using
a bunch of registry settings, task settings, services, etc.
Basically, just not gonna happen; would be a mistake to even try.

MSP files added to Updates Folder:
access-x-none.msp, ace-x-none.msp, convintl-en-us.msp,
csi-x-none.msp, excel-x-none.msp, excelintl-en-us.msp,
groove-x-none.msp, grooveintl-en-us.msp, lync-x-none.msp,
lyncintl-en-us.msp, msmipc-x-none.msp, mso-x-none.msp,
msointl-en-us.msp, msores-x-none.msp, oart-x-none.msp,
onenote-x-none.msp, osetup-x-none.msp, outlfltr-x-none.msp,
outlook-x-none.msp, outlookintl-en-us.msp, powerpoint-x-none.msp,
powerpointintl-en-us.msp, project-x-none.msp, proof-en-us.msp,
proof-es-es.msp,visio-x-none.msp,
visiointl-en-us.msp, vviewer-x-none.msp, word-x-none.msp

You can activate using MS Toolkit 2.4.1.
Click the office button, then activation tab, etc.
If you install AutoKMS you will need to allow it through any A/V
programs. It has been blacklisted for being an insanely fast,
basically perfect Offline KMS Activator.  You can also use
KMS Server Service, which is a dropdown option if you click on
AutoKMS.  With that service though, you will need to create
a re-activation script and task. I have instructions on MDL at:

*ACTIVATE Office with the MTK first!*

You can delete the line with SLMGR if you don't activate windows
with this. It will just attempt to re-activate windows. This is
not desirable unless you also need to activate your VL version
of windows. If you want to also activate windows, you have to
install a gVLK key. You can do this by running the admin cmd prompt:
SLMGR /ipk xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx

Find gVLK keys online by searching for them. they're not a secret.

I recommend getting and using Advanced Tokens Manager to backup
any legit retail Windows or Office activations before attempting
to use any KMS activator.
