,enonumus,2013-03-17T07:20Z,"If any of you who said this was fake bothered to look at who uploaded it, and unless you're completely clueless about who reliably uploads the UFC fights every time, you'd know this isn't fake.  He didn't say it was the main card, nor did he say it was the prelims, he just said ""UFC 158 fights"".  Don't call a torrent fake if you haven't downloaded it and verified it yourself, especially when you don't even bother to look at who uploaded it and what their track record is.  NOBODY'S going to ruin their VIP status on TPB just to upload one fake UFC torrent, DUH."

Main Card here. Sorry, It was a typo."
