,Nimh,2013-03-17T06:34Z,"Beilzibob: look what Sec has said in the description.

He is currently encoding a smaller version, which is the reason, i take it, this high quality one is uploaded first.  

You're an unappreciative cunt."
,LaxerFL,2013-03-17T06:39Z,"""u can't play 720p on vlc""
What the fuck u talkin' 'bout Willis?"
,saffronsghost,2013-03-17T06:41Z,"Holy shit, you did it!  NICE!

,Strajow,2013-03-17T06:42Z,@beilzibob evrything you just said was complete garbage.. Thank you Sec!!
,gary43389,2013-03-17T06:42Z,"bielzibob, you're a fucking nimrod for not realising is takes time to re-encode the video at a lower res/smaller file size... just be patient, there will be a smaller one soon. "
,Quink666,2013-03-17T06:42Z,d
,biteme1011,2013-03-17T06:43Z,"bielzibob r u a fucking moron!? of course u can play 720p on vlc! and 1080p! I have used vlc player for 4 years and I almost always dl hd torrents, mostly yify, and I play them on vlc easily. it's the only player I use because it fucking plays anything! you can synchronize the subs and the audio tracks and do 100 other things with it. your a complete fucking idiot!"
,MrFisty,2013-03-17T06:44Z,"9GB all day every day, keep it going.

@bielzibob you must have a Commodore 64 if your VLC can't handle this."
,bad446999,2013-03-17T06:44Z,"just read comments, i was about to have heart attack about 9,15 gigs
ty for the upl"
,antidoosh,2013-03-17T06:44Z,"Hey bielzibob chill, Your getting this for free!  If you new secludedly you would realise that about half hour after the big file there will be a small file for people like you who still have to watch on vlc in non HD."
,Strajow,2013-03-17T06:45Z,..

,twistedm16,2013-03-17T07:01Z,how come when i download ufc events the night they happen the seeders will say 0 of 150 connected. why wont the seeds connect???
,nawzyah,2013-03-17T07:04Z,"This is the real deal. SecTPB wouldn't upload fake shit.

BTW thanks for this torrent."
,Hoirc88,2013-03-17T07:05Z,"Yes it's real all of Sec's stuff is good, just wait a little bit for the standard version if you don't wanna download a file this large."
,Death2Dipshits,2013-03-17T07:07Z,"I'm paying for my internet, not destroying my bandwidth limit for this... Only fucking morons or rich faggots think this is free."
,twistedm16,2013-03-17T07:07Z,
,twistedm16,2013-03-17T07:08Z,anyone who comments about who won the fight is a fucking asshole
,T0bIt07N4d0,2013-03-17T07:09Z,VLC uses it's own codecs. That could be your problem. Get the latest and use MPC...
,drader,2013-03-17T07:09Z,I don't know what sad version of VLC bielzibob but my VLC plays them pretty good.  Not surprisingly he's the same guy that is outraged about this torrent even being put up.  Luckily there are 500 people that AREN'T douchebags downloading it.
,RBH4908,2013-03-17T07:11Z,"Should change title to ""Prelims"" so people know Thanks"
,Bigsmiles,2013-03-17T07:15Z,Please don't post the fucking out come to the fights. bielzibob You prick.
,saffronsghost,2013-03-17T07:19Z,"I honestly hope you get hit by a car, bielzibob."
,BDIP,2013-03-17T07:27Z,Great Upload TY
,dbolic,2013-03-17T07:45Z,"bielzibob and Death2Dipshits are Bed Buddies, one watches the fight, but bitches about the size, and other cries about his bandwidth.
What douche bags.

Thanks Secludedly, downloading now, even if someone posted the outcome. I want to see the fight regardless."
,kjhgviyvoiyoi,2013-03-17T08:10Z,"Death2Dipshits 
Well.. Just visiting the UFC homepage tells you that when it comes to make smooth internet media they are like retarded. I wouldn't chanse my money on that page. But I can tell you that I mail ordered all the 30 first VHS tapes from UFC in the old days before internet. I would still pay for it if i got a trustworthy supplier for the shows. And I do pay when I have a chans to actually go to an event. You are retarded dipshits for being to tightassed to spend a fev dollars on getting a webmaster with at least a twelve years olds computerskills."
,nawzyah,2013-03-17T09:21Z,Slowest fuckin torrent ever............
