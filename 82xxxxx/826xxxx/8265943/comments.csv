I'm new to putting torrents out and I don't know how people get new torrents started by themselves? Do they all have much higher upstream then I do?"

,LaxerFL,2013-03-17T07:51Z,"I was just trying to be honest. It's just a live stream I capped and threw up on TPB so people could have the title fight as soon as possible. The other torrents are way bigger.
Was just trying to help :-("
,aarmyoc,2013-03-17T20:00Z,thanks for the upload. it is watchable. A8 V7
,nekropsycho,2013-03-17T23:17Z,"yeah thanks for the upload! definitely watchable. there were a few spots it lagged out a bit, but at times nothing was really happening. i'll agree with aarmyoc and say A-8 V-7

,LaxerFL,2013-03-18T02:23Z,"Not too shabby for a fraps'ed copy of a live stream I guess! I was just trying to get the main event fight out as quickly as possible for those that couldn't find a live stream to watch. I'm sure by now there are many other torrents with much better quality but this one served its purpose last night.
Glad I could finally give back to a community that has given me so much over the years! I just wish my upload speed was better... Apparently Comcast has some speed increases in the works; we'll see how long it takes them to roll that out in my area though!"
