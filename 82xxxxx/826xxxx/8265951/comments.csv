,Nimh,2013-03-17T09:09Z,"Benn downloading for 2 hours now and i'm only at 25%.    I started the download within 5 minutes of it being up'ed and ive been connected to peers in my country that have the same internet connection (ADSL2).  Alot of them are 50-80%. How? 

Why am i downloading so slow? My max upload is 25kBs, if i put it higher , my download speed suffers.  (ran tests) 

My real dload speed is 900KB/s , im basically dloading this at 20 - 60 kB /s .  With a rare peer that i get conencted to at about 280 KB/s.  

What the deal , can anyone tell me why? 
Cheers"
,extracube,2013-03-17T09:44Z,"Yah I'm downloading at avg 100 kB/s, sometimes drops to zero, then back up maybe 125, lingers at ~100.  Listed as ""connected to 8 of 8 peers"" even though tpb shows 1146 at the moment.

Something to do with this new craze called ""connectability.""  Apparently just because your client is open doesn't mean you auto connect to everyone -- have to take procedures to truly make it happen.  Unfortunately I'm not technie enough to know how.  Also I'm overseas (3rd world) where connections are even worse.  Anyways just my two cents."
,A_Dying_Baby,2013-03-17T09:48Z,"Thnk you very much sir!!
Right on the money!"
,SomeBoyFromVillage,2013-03-17T10:11Z,thnx!
,Nimh,2013-03-17T10:15Z,"@ Extracube: 

Thing is i'm connected to 6 seeds / 68 peers.  I can understand if its a new torrent , just trying to figure out how others with the same ISP (so i know they don't have any superior bandwidth) have been able to download so fast. 

I changed my upload to 50KB/s - no difference.

[V],SecTPB,2013-03-17T11:46Z,"Not guaranteed to work, but if you want faster speeds, try adding the following trackers to your tracker list...

Check my Twitter or Wordpress. The URLs are in the .nfo files. They're both ""Secludedly."""
