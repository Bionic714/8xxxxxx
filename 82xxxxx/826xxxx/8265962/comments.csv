,one_eyed_injun,2013-03-17T16:50Z,"This is just prelims and ends without finishing the Johny Hendricks vs. Carlos Condit fight. good quality tho, not sure if he just missed the end or thought it was complete."
,LloydChristmas7,2013-03-17T21:35Z,Just started watching. No Password so not sure what mrmouth has experienced.
,LloydChristmas7,2013-03-18T03:54Z,"Okay, let's clear up some confusion with facts:

1) Two AVI files; quality good enough

2) No password

3) Fights:

Mike Ricci vs. Colin Fletcher
Nick Ring vs. Chris Camozzi
Jake Ellenberger vs.  Nate Marquardt
Johny Hendricks vs. Carlos Condit (full fight, the rest of it is in the second file)
Nike Diaz vs. Georges St. Pierre

Thank you very much for the files Test_Verify."
