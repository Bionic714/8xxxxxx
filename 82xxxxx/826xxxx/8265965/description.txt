
Eighteen-year-old Matthew Kidman is a straight-arrow over-achiever who has never really lived life--until he falls for his beautiful and seemingly innocent neighbor, Danielle. When Matthew discovers that this perfect "girl next door" is a one-time porn star, his sheltered existence begins to spin out of control. Ultimately, Danielle helps Matthew emerge from his shell and discover that sometimes you have to risk everything for the person you love, as he simultaneously helps her rediscover her innocence.

 A teenager's dreams come true when a former porn star moves in next door and they fall in love.
