,dfarns,2013-03-18T09:52Z,"I'm having a problem with this file...on VLC only the audio plays, on WMP nothing plays, and on Media Player Classic also nothing plays.  WMP gave an message ""error downloading codec"".

Not being an expert on this, I'm stumped.  Anyone else having this problem?"
[T],Demonoid4Ever,2013-03-18T18:33Z,"@ dfarns, make sure you have the necessary Codecs and you should be able to play it with most players including WMP, you can download a codec pack from here
