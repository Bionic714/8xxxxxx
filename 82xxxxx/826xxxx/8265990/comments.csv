[V],QborT,2013-03-17T17:11Z,Keithhall  --  Yes. 
,tyl3rdurd3n,2013-03-17T19:08Z,"Okay, don't let the negative reviews keep you from watching this, like I did. It's actually really, really good and unlike anything I've watched before.  Certainly one of those movies that'll be later acknowledged as one of the best movies grossly misunderstood at the time it came out. Looking forward now to reading the novel."
,piratebuddha,2013-03-17T23:28Z,"I agree. I REALLY loved this film. Definitely one of the most grossly misunderstood and underrated films in movie history.
Sure, it's not perfect, it was a very ambitions project, but I rather support film makers who are actually trying to do something different than those doing the same old cookie-cutter bullshit and endless sequels."
,Aj1976,2013-03-18T08:48Z,will there be a torrent without the russian crap on it? anyways Bozx thanks for the upload
,HEzooL,2013-03-18T20:11Z,"What lowered the score for me was the bad prosthetic ""asian"" eyes on Jim Sturgess and Hugo Weaving. I mean, for the love of God, make it look believable at least. It's 2013, not 1998. Even people who never saw an asian person before, would find it laughable. Otherwise a good movie."
,monster.x,2013-03-18T21:51Z,"while the audio track is english, the video seems to come from a russian source, since all text/title is in russian"
,ofpirate,2013-03-18T23:18Z,non english region source video
,Revisionist,2013-03-24T16:00Z,"I was very dissappointed and feel mislead.  Usually both Bozx and PHD are trustworthy sources but this is indeed a Russian copy.

Dont know if its actually a Blue Ray or not but I NEVER download Russian or Chinese rips. The source info should reflect that this isnt a US or even European version. Thought PHD was a bit stricter on what they attached their name to."
