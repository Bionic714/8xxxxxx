                                     FEATURES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Develop

- Make your best even better -
ACDSee Pro's Develop mode is your non-destructive workshop where you can process 
your RAW images and apply adjustments to your JPEGs, TIFFs and other files. 
Preview your changes instantly, hide or reveal adjustments, and revert to your 
original images at any time. With the flexibility and power of ACDSee Pro's 
development tools, you'll bring out the best in your photos, quickly and safely, 
time and time again.

- Non-destructive adjustment brush -
Make non-destructive adjustments to select areas of your images using a versatile 
brush to precisely get the look you want. Subtly or dramatically correct exposure, 
add clarity, boost vibrance and more.

- See it in the RAW -

See incredibly accurate default color, contrast and exposure right from the start 
of your RAW processing workflow. A wide RGB color gamut preserves your camera's 
vibrant colors for true-to-life representation.

- Tune your images -
Get the correct white balance, color, exposure and tonal distribution for your 
RAW images in Develop mode. Add vibrance while protecting skin tones, and adjust 
saturation, brightness and hue on a color-by-color basis.

- Get it just right -
Non-destructively reduce red eye, adjust geometry, and fix perspective, distortion 
and lens vignetting with full control over pixel size and resolution.

- Reduce noise -
Rescue your high ISO images with ACDSee's improved noise reduction technology to 
get smoother and more natural results.

- Smarter sharpening -
Gain even more control over the sharpening process. The new Detail slider allows 
you to feather or soften sharpening halos, while the edge detection mask slider 
lets you focus the sharpening effect more to edges and textures without amplifying 
any pre-existing noise in areas with little detail.

- Create stunning HDR images -
Get amazing single-exposure HDR results from your RAW images using the Lighting 
tool, powered by ACDSee's patented LCE (Lighting and Contrast Enhancement) 
technology. This tool accurately and intelligently stretches the dynamic range of 
your photos, so you can make them incredibly realistic or atmospheric.
