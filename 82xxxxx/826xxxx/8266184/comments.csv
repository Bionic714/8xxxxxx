,fatcerberus1,2013-03-18T03:46Z,"Thanks Pyro!  Cherubim is awesome, it'll be nice to have it in 320kbps.  Carne Vale and especilaly Eternity Served Cold make it worth it all by itself.  At some point I may actually purchase a copy, that and Genesis Frog.  The Felt is still my #1 favorite, of course. :-)"
,netwat,2013-03-18T08:38Z,I am practically done with a FLAC collection...maybe I'll keep up with Pyrogoeth eventually to be able to upload it. Thanks for the work.

,Pyrogoeth,2013-03-26T14:19Z,"@Relinies
Sorry bro, not happening. This compilation is explicitly for the albums released by the music team; Homestuck and Homestuck Gaiden on bandcamp. Why would I collect Fans and Music 2 anyway? There's literally official torrents for it, it's a free album. XD"
