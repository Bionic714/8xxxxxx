,standishgal,2013-03-17T14:43Z,Thank you so much for uploading this show. I have really enjoyed watching it. Here's hoping they do another season.
,chuckufarley,2013-03-17T18:26Z,Thanks for the finally episode.  Dunno why the scene abandoned this fun series.
,Shurubell85,2013-03-21T00:41Z,don't download..this is ep 10 not 12 
,cindy25,2013-03-22T04:01Z,"can u please post this weeks Mr. D?

I found Murdoch 610 on another site, but it looks like the scene has forgot there is a Canada"
[V],err0001,2013-03-23T00:06Z,Sorry. I don't do Mr. D. That show is horrible - not a laugh to be had. Even worse than Good Dog/Good God. 
,luisbaeta,2013-03-23T21:25Z,Thanks!
,DngnRdr,2013-03-28T04:15Z,@Shurubell85.. There's about three different numbering schemes depending on which country broadcast it and the official sites for those countries have different broadcast order - this matches the Canadian broadcast order and IMDB (it also makes more sense compared to some of the other orders).
[T],iamgreat,2013-04-05T09:22Z,"chuckufarley, it turns out the scene Blu-ray rip of the German discs came out half way through the Canadian broadcast and well apparently by scene logic edited blu-ray trumps uncut hdtv so 2HD stopped. Word on these interwebs is that the most violent and explicit frames were removed from the German version because of it being shown on a channel readily available and for being shown earlier in the night than what the uncut version would require. 

cindy25, 
the scene groups do NOT cater to any of us; most exist with the basic principle that those not in their groups are some sort of evil/bad, especially those who use this site. 2HD got Murdoch Mysteries s6e10 from an on-demand service i don't have access to; the audio for the 720p file is AC3 5.1 448kbps, which is better than what iTunes nr conventional broadcast have for the show. My sentiments toward Mr D are less favourable than what err0001 expressed.

err0001,
thank you for these. i did come into Transporter rather late and have been enjoying it via your torrents. "
