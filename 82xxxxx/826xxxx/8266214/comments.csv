,fractaldelic,2013-03-17T17:22Z,"Wow how the fuck does this piece of shit scene4all have a VIP rating, yet spreads fud bullshit like this.

Also, whoever, ""NothingButKush"" is, is obviously a shill for this shady piece of shit scumbag group.

Spend all fucking night downloading this bullshit torrent, to wake up and see it's a password protected rar.  The readme file has this as follows:"

,nycplayer,2013-03-17T17:41Z,"Actually, the file with the passworded RAR was named with the wrong date 17th, not 16th. It seems to be gone now. Apologies, and in any case I never would blame s4a, they've got a good hostory with me. Obviously some asshole tried to trade on their rep."
[M],Q91,2013-03-17T18:06Z,"This Torrent is not a fake, as you can see, the torrent contains NO RAR files, and thus can't be password-protected."
,fractaldelic,2013-03-17T18:34Z,"Either the original upload was deleted, and this corrected torrent was uploaded, or it was an imposter and we got tricked, but either way this is real now.

What didn't work yesterday, works today; magic."
,Rush,2013-03-17T20:01Z,"@fractaldelic ,,,, click ""files"" says ""mp4"" WTF are you talking about idiot?  s4a has been around forever, show some respect or quit posting bullshit"
,Av3Fenix,2013-03-17T23:58Z,"scene4all actually does upload fake password protected files. I'm not sure if this one is the same I got, but it sure was the same name and uploader.

Here's the magnet link with a fake upload, and password protected uploaded by scene4all:

,upx3,2013-03-18T04:04Z,Why doesn't anyone just release the main event fight at a reasonable file size ?
,rowsol,2013-03-18T06:13Z,disappointing event.  mostly went to decision.
[M],BigNoise,2013-03-18T16:21Z,"@Av3Fenix - before you accuse someone, make sure you've got the facts correct.

fakers often copy&paste descriptions from well known users to fool inexperienced ppl.

when you've trapped on one, compare the 'uploaded by' and info-hash values before you comment.

for the magnet you've posted it was:

so NOT by scene4all, who never had any bad or passworded torrent on his account."
