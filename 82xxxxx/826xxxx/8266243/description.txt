Br√∂derna Mozart (The Mozart Brothers) stars Etienne Glaser as a highly unorthodox opera director. His plans to stage Don Giovanni in bizarre, inappropriate costumes, and to have orchestra members take singing roles, enrages the opera company that has engaged him. Glaser is motivated by the "voice of God"--God being in this instance Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, whose ghost commiserates with the innovative director from time to time. directed by Suzanne Osten, daughter of a leading Swedish film critic.
