9/10"
,highresjunkie,2013-03-17T19:37Z,"Dubbing ruins movies. In the future, please leave original language in tact with English subs."
,EliteBeast,2013-03-18T00:13Z,The majority rather have movies dubbed than read subtitles. If you want to read then read a book. Most people cant enjoy a movie if they have to read. Thats just the way it is.  The majority of the world is stupid and you just have to learn to live with it. Yify uploads movies according to how many votes it receives so therefore Yify is here to please the majority.
,Goce5,2013-03-18T01:00Z,@EliteBeast You don't want to read and the majority of the world is stupid? Actually dubbing ruins it for me. 
,k00bz,2013-03-18T03:55Z,"I agree, dubbing kills movies, subtitles are easy to read. If you can't read you shouldn't be complaining. Many good movies require subs (or at least the language comprehension to understand them).

English does not make the world go round."
,gratefulforthis,2013-03-18T18:23Z,EliteBeast is clearly a dumb westerner. 
,kjbersch,2013-03-18T20:36Z,Awesome Movie. Thanks YIFY
,vcdman17,2013-03-18T20:43Z,"What's dumb is people who feel the need to complain about the free shit they get rather than simply searching for the one they want more. Here you go, ungrateful assholes:

,TimoZi,2013-03-18T21:44Z,"Dubbing is horrible, it ruins films.

YIFY does brilliant bitrate optimized HD movie rips, and this is the first time I've seen them do a foreign film. Bitrate optimization means only one audio track. The english dub is the wrong choice. I think most viewers now want to experience the real film wit the real actors' performances.

I'm not complaining about free stuff, I'm just giving my feedback so if in the future YIFY continues to do foreign films (which I hope they do) they may consider user's feedback and make better rips."
,gramranger,2013-03-18T21:45Z,"Its not about being stupid, or epeen stroking assholes; a movie is an audio/visual form of entertainment, and if someone must stare at the bottom of the screen reading everything that is spoken, then the visual portion of the movie is sorely degraded.

If you want to read, grab a book. If you want to watch a movie in a foreign language not known to you, then either put up with dubbing, or go learn that language."
,FureeTutawk,2013-03-22T05:18Z,"I think dubbing can look funny, sometimes, but usually it's better than subtitles if it's going to be an entire movie in a language I do not know. This is not because I am too dumb to read. This is because I do not wish to watch the words and miss the movie. People who put their noses in the air about the whole thing puzzle me. Why are you superior for preferring to not see the movie while reading it? It's just preference. Let people have their preferences. I choose mine based on what is best for me, and my choices are never based on what snotty people say I should like. For instance, I loved the USA version of Let Me In so much that I looked up info about it to find that a foreign version was made called Let The Right One In, and immediately watched it as well. I loved it, too, but for different reasons, and felt it to be a bit more childish in imagery and far less developed with the dialogue, but still very great. Then what happened? A bunch of snotty people were arguing that the foreign one was better because... well... because it was foreign instead of American, that's why, So There. Y'all are in a serious need of a spanking ;-)"

,lonelysoldier72,2013-04-16T15:08Z,thanx YIFI for quality movies !!!!gracias che!!!
