The moron here is yourself!  If you're not happy with the free copies of the film that people are uploading, put your hand in your pocket and buy the damn DVD/BR!

If you feel that you can provide better uploads than those available here, feel free to do so; but in the meantime, SHUT THE FUCK UP YOU TOTAL FUCKING WANKER!!!"
