A collection of Psalms on Anglican Chant, from King's College Cambridge (I suspect that at least all Psalms marked II are from a torrent which exists elsewhere, but I can't seem to locate - if you know whence, please comment), Hereford, Lichfield, Durham, and Wells Cathedrals.
I'll post more music as I rip it from my gramophone record collection, or get it by other means...
