,SunMessiah,2013-03-20T02:10Z,I just finished installing this and so far it appears that all is well. Thanks to lolzob.
,slackeritguy,2013-03-21T03:36Z,"I get to choose from all Windows 7 version in the setup, are the updates deployed for all versions or just the Ultimate?"
,rezapx,2013-03-21T10:14Z,Thank you sir....
,U-235,2013-03-21T10:28Z,"@lolzob

Integrated March 2013? When installed it wants to update over 100 updates (several hundreds of megabytes), and some of the dates of those updates goes back in 2011 (!). And Internet Explorer 8.0 comes with it, not 10.0 as the description says. I'm not ungrateful, as this is ""free"", but don't say it's ""march 2013"" when it's clearly not.

Do not download this if you expect it to be a fully updated (march 2013) Windows 7 ISO."
,lolzob,2013-03-21T20:59Z,"U-235 talk crap ... you check before you speak ... 
IE 10 is integrated.
open IE press Alt+X and in ""About Internet Explorer"" you find the IE version"
,lolzob,2013-03-21T21:00Z,slackeritguy --- updates deployed for all versions
,slackeritguy,2013-03-22T02:51Z,"It doesn't seem like it, IE10 was only installed in the Ultimate version mate, I tried the Pro version, and IE8 was still the main IE there."
,U-235,2013-03-22T13:33Z,"@lolzob: I did check it. I would get screenshots if I could with a virtual machine but I installed another release instead as I was in a hurry. I was so glad that I could choose from Home Premium, Professional and Ultimate, so when I saw Professional I took that instead and took for granted that the updates was deployed to all versions, which you later told to slackeritguy.

Even though you did deploy to all the versions, it seems it failed, because there were lots of entries of errors and warnings in Event Viewer which seemed to be related to failed integrations (extractions?) of updates.

I'm sorry if I sounded a bit harsh, but like I said I was in a hurry at the time so it was a bit disappointing with over 100 updates on the Professional version. I hope you can understand that. I meant no offence. :)

@slackeritguy: Exactly, then I didn't imagine things."
,lolzob,2013-03-22T16:23Z,"yes you're right, all updates are integrated only in wondows ultimate"
,lolzob,2013-03-22T16:27Z,"I prepare a Windows 7 where I integrate all updates, all in one"
,U-235,2013-03-22T16:43Z,Thank you lolzob! :)
,slackeritguy,2013-03-23T03:24Z,"Thanks lolzob, and thanks for the support 235 (:.

This release, apart from that issue is impeccable, I'm already using it in my main rig.

Thanks."
,lolzob,2013-03-23T11:08Z,"I thank you for all.
this weekend I'll put windows 7 all in one
(all updates integrated into windows 7 ultimate, professional, home, starter)"
,slackeritguy,2013-03-23T19:02Z,"That's amazing lolzob. Thanks again, and no problem man, this is what I've been looking for quite some time now, monthly updates of Windows .isos, so thanks again.

Another question, will you be releasing a March edition of Windows 8?"
,rafalocobrx,2013-03-23T19:37Z,"THIS VERSION OF WINDOWS 7 IS THE SAME VERSION OF Maherz, WINDOWS THAT CONTAINS THEMES is MODIFIED, AND HAS AN ERROR IN THAT TIME TO INSTALL A PROGRAM NO ANY LANGUAGE APPEARS THE BAR AT THE BOTTOM, NOT recommend.

MORE SORRY YOUR WINDOWS 7 IS BAD"
,U-235,2013-03-24T00:55Z,"@lolzob: Sounds great, your Windows 7 release will stand out from the rest out there because your will contain all the versions to choose from which is great. Being able to choose from Home Premium or Professional instead of Ultimate is very good. Looking forward to more releases to choose from. :)

@rafalocobrx: Could you elaborate please? Being able to choose from different themes like ""Architecture"", ""Landscapes"", ""Characters"" etc is completely normal. What language ""issue"" are you talking about? If it's even an issue."
,lolzob,2013-03-24T01:01Z,"rafalocobrx ... do not think what you write? ...
I use this Windows and I had no problems ... tell me next month if you have problems ... after you have downloaded and installed Windows 7 Ultimate from me, not from maher or others"
,lolzob,2013-03-24T01:06Z,"slackeritguy, I will release soon a March edition of Windows 8."
,slackeritguy,2013-03-24T03:17Z,"Nice!!, btw man thanks for taking the time to answer all our questions, that's what really stands out here, the .isos are great, but the support is better (:"
,lolzob,2013-03-24T11:07Z,Answered difficult because now learn to write English 
,U-235,2013-03-24T13:18Z,@slackeritguy: Totally agreed!
,lolzob,2013-03-24T14:26Z,I hope you understand me.
,lolzob,2013-03-24T14:30Z,"6 hours to integrate all updates in windows 7
for example: 130 updates for Windows 7 HOMEBASIC
and are of all 4: HOMEBASIC, HOMEPREMIUM, PROFESSIONAL, ULTIMATE
130x4 = 520 updates for all + Virtual machine verification"
,lolzob,2013-03-24T14:32Z,I hope my worth the effort for this window 7 (4 in 1) !!! 
,slackeritguy,2013-03-25T02:52Z,"It'll be worth it mate!, and don't worry, your english is more than OK. Keep up the amazing job!."
,abhaykv.13,2013-03-27T10:48Z,"@lolzob
