Both of you need to chill. 

@ highresjunkie
if YIFY encoded it with only English dub then deal with it or just don't have it at all. He worked hard to release this movie to people.

@ deaderweterdog
some people like watching movies in it's original language, people find it very distracting to watch dub movies because the words don't match the actor's moving mouths. Just because you don't like having to read subtitles while watching a movie doesn't mean you have to talk crap about the people who can do it and even enjoy it.

I have watched both version and personally I like the original Korean language w/ subtitles. I find it detracting when the words don't match the actor's mouth motions. Plus Korean is a very interesting language, try watching the original version, you might find you like it.

If YIFY decides to encode an mkv version of the movie that includes both languages then he will release it. Otherwise accept what he gives us and be grateful for all his work."

I must say I would rather watch a dubbed version so I can do other things while watching without being afraid to miss anything."
,alveolate,2013-03-20T10:15Z,yea movie was great... but the dubbing wasn't. way too distracting watching koreans speak with cheesy hollywood accents.
