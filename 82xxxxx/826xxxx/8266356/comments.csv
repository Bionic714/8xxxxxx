I can't comment on the quality yet because I just started to download but if it is like your Q2 & Q3 torrent, it should be great. Love your description of this one. ;-)

I can't believe there are 1,282 seeders @ the present and zero thanks or comments!"
,IAMH67,2013-03-17T19:40Z,"You are welcome! Enjoy!

My Internet wasn't working properly and I had the torrents for all the session before anyone else on thepiratebay but couldn't upload them for the last couple of days. Today it finally started working so I can upload again.

If my Internet keeps working properly I will be able to upload F1 torrents for you all 1-2 hours before anyone else."

And exciting race too. :-)"
