The Biggest Loser Australia - The Next Generation - Series 8 Episode 1

This yearΓÇÖs The Biggest Loser is all about the Next Generation and tackling the cycle of generational obesity.

We will follow a number of parents with either their son or daughter. The duos will battle it out to lose weight and fight their demons as they face brand new challenges, twists, eliminations and, of course, transformations.

Returning is host Hayley Lewis along with favourite trainers - Michelle, Shannan and The Commando. There's a brand new Biggest Loser house, with four new gymnasiums, and a new weigh in set up.

The Biggest Loser: The Next Generation is sure to surprise, entertain, inspire and prove that obesity cycles in Australian families can indeed be broken. 

The Biggest Loser kicks off tonight when our teams board a bus - assumingly to the Biggest Loser House - but are instead informed they're about to make a public promise to themselves & each other.
