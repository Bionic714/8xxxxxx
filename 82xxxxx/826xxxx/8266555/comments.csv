,justknox,2013-03-18T07:08Z,"A/7(-3 For the heavy breathing of the camera operator. I recommend a bronchodilator like Albuterol)

V/5 Not always in focus. Several moments where the cam isn't aligned and heads of other spectators are clearly visible."
,Maximus_Decimus_Meridius,2013-03-19T08:37Z,"Yeah, There is a lot of camera movement, focus issues, and the damned Darth Vader breathing in this one. Plus, the guy cuts off the camera more than once and some of the movie is missing... I appreciate the effort, gonna wait for a better one."

Are you fat?  'Cause you sound fat."
