,milopeng,2013-03-17T15:10Z,pls upload wif the pre and post race thx a million
,Bidissy,2013-03-17T15:48Z,"@milopeng This is what I have got, if you want the long version there is one available here: http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8266568/F1.20130317.Australia.Race.720p.m4v"
,chem_101,2013-03-17T21:24Z,Let's fucking seed this thing!
,Sanyi001,2013-03-18T06:12Z,thank you for taking out the pre-race coverage!
,euphoria4949,2013-03-18T12:11Z,"[Question] - Will you be uploading the highlights at some point, and if so will it be in SD or HD???

Thanks for the upload =)"
,Bidissy,2013-03-18T16:15Z,"@euphoria4949 I'm not yet sure what I will and won't do. I only get files second hand so obviously what I do will depend on the source. I think I'll stick to the race and qualifying in a reasonably sized HD quality. If someone else has posted an acceptable (576 to 720p, 1 to 2 GB/h) release of the Sky or BBC cast I probably won't bother."
,gyrex,2013-03-20T00:51Z,Is it just me or is this missing commentary?
,zimmy41,2013-03-21T19:14Z,"Great, thanks so much! Please keep 'em coming as the season progresses!"
