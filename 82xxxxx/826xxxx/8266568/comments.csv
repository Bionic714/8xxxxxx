,le_turke,2013-03-17T13:40Z,fucking hell compress your shit
,smcgill1969,2013-03-17T14:21Z,"@le_turke - just like you have with all your uploads! LOL

Look, on a serious note, this is a 4.5hr HD720p file. I could probably knock this down to ~1.5GB @ 640x368 BUT I DON'T WANT TO! 

Serious motorsport fans are going to love this IMHO - if your not one of them maybe you need to go find another upload that suits your preferences?

I would encourage you to give it a go though... :)"
,Hollow7,2013-03-17T14:24Z,i made this account just to call you a fucking fag you stupid fuck for spoilers. what are you a retard ? you don't fucking write who won the race in the description
,kali_2,2013-03-17T14:28Z,"@ le_turke, stfu and don't  download it then! 
Ty for DL :)"
,Hollow7,2013-03-17T14:34Z,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
,kali_2,2013-03-17T14:42Z,"@ Hollow u noob, it says last time lol"
,smcgill1969,2013-03-17T14:50Z,"@Hollow7 - The description is not a spoiler, it's a verbatim copy of the program guide info from SkyTV - now unless you think someone at SkyTV has a time machine... 

Thanks for the comment though - made me smile! :)"
,eption,2013-03-17T16:27Z,"Thanks for that man, love the high quality! I only wish I had found your torrent earlier, as it didn't turn up on a simple ""formula"" keyword search :("
,kmfurdm,2013-03-17T16:52Z,"Thanks very much for the upload. 

I have a question though, not directed at the OP.

How can the downloads be so slow when there are 20+ seeds?  Is everybody out there limiting their uploads to damn near nothing?  It should be flying."
,kali_2,2013-03-17T17:02Z,I've finished the DL and will continue seeding with the speed at almost 2 Mb/sec :)
,kali_2,2013-03-17T17:14Z,@kmfurdm.. it's because some assholes like to put down the upload speed at like 0...
,kali_2,2013-03-17T17:15Z,I usually ban teh fuckers at once! from my client.
,kali_2,2013-03-17T17:26Z,It's epic:) and to you all with no seed..i just blocked you all from my speed upload loosers
,smcgill1969,2013-03-17T17:27Z,"@eption - Thanks for pointing that out, I'll amend the tags for next weekends uploads... :)"
,smcgill1969,2013-03-17T17:37Z,"@kmfurdm - I like to think it's because some downloaders just don't have the bandwidth available to allow fast uploads... I'm a glass is half full kind of person that way. 

Anyway, since uploading the torrent ~4 hours ago I've seeded over 32GB already - Come the end of the month my second line will be installed, so from  race 3 (China) onwards the uploads should propogate at twice that speed too!!!! :)"
,kali_2,2013-03-17T17:45Z,"heeh, I know that i have a good/fast speed.. I upload more TB that you can imagine.. but, when I see someone uploading like hell and not sharing....! I ban them !"
,kali_2,2013-03-17T17:58Z,"LOL, I've never banned so many noobs from a torrent like this.. and still banninig!"
,nick999,2013-03-17T18:20Z,"Many thanks for the HQ upload (and the spoiler laugh!)

Have you considered dividing the file in to 3 parts (pre-race, race and post-race) so people can start watching the first part of the show before the rest downloads?

Note that you are displaying the ID of the card used to decrypt the feed (the grey numbers that appear for a few minutes in the top right of the screen, for example at 2hrs 1min in) so it might stop working next week. A non-sky box or a delayed Sky+ chase play might be an idea."

,kmfurdm,2013-03-17T18:54Z,Well thanks gents.  I don't know why it's so damn slow.  I don't really ever seem to be able to average much more than 200KB/s down.  I should be in the 2MB/s range down which is what I get on the private trackers out there.  Everything is as it should be on my end.  Uploaded nearly 4GB so far.  Downloaded just under 3GB. :-/
,madh4tter,2013-03-17T19:23Z,"Many thanks for your uploads, the 'spoiler' was a good laugh too!"
,rc90029,2013-03-17T19:31Z,Thank YOUThank YOUThank YOUThank YOUThank YOUThank YOUThank YOUThank YOUThank YOUThank YOUThank YOUThank YOUThank YOUThank YOUThank YOUThank YOUThank YOU
,Bidissy,2013-03-17T20:06Z,"@smcgill1969 It seems like the tags don't work, search exclusively match the title string."
,MikeyMetal,2013-03-18T01:38Z,Can people actually seed this rather than just grab and run? I'm getting snail speeds here.
,ektakrome,2013-03-18T02:29Z,"Thanks for the spoiler, ass. I went and got rid of so many things on FB so they wouldn't tell me who won and then you show up with the ONLY file on the race and tell us who won. Really fucked up. Guess I won't even download it now. Can someone else please upload the next race, and in a better bitrate too."
,ektakrome,2013-03-18T02:31Z,"OK, so I listened to the other ass, and ASS-umed."
,smcgill1969,2013-03-18T10:13Z,@nick999 - Fantastic tip! -1min chase play recording from now on... :)
,smcgill1969,2013-03-18T10:14Z,@ektakrome - ;)
,SaintsCanada,2013-03-21T00:57Z,"I just created my account to thank you for this wonderful upload!  I'm a huge f1 fan, but due to my location and busy weekends, sometimes watching (especially in English) is difficult.  I love the British coverage, especially the long pre and post-race shows.

YOU DE MAN!"
