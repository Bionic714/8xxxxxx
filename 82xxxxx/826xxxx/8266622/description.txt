Air Date: 16 Mar 2013

Summary: When Tom Burns (Steven Weber) loses his job at advertising agency Rage because he isnΓÇÖt young or hip enough, he enlists the help of youthful con-man Dick Sweeney (Andrew Francis) to pose as a copywriter. Tom secretly generates the campaigns, and Dick presents them to Rage with his innate charm and confident attitude. The scam fools everyone including Rage CEO Reese Danzinger (Michael Eklund), Creative Director Derek (Hamza Adam), and even Art Director Harriet Fellows (Michelle Harrison). With the help of TomΓÇÖs ideas, Dick quickly becomes a superstar at the agency and is tasked with spearheading a Super Bowl campaign for a new client.

 As Tom and Dick find success in their professional arrangement, Tom begins to develop a romance with Harriet and works to improve his relationship with his daughter, Kelly (MacKenzie Porter). But when Dick falls for Kelly, it complicates their personal lives and threatens their working arrangement. As Tom and Dick lie to both women to protect themselves, their lies ultimately take a toll on their relationships and they must decide if maintaining their scheme - and the success and wealth that goes along with it - is worth the personal turmoil it causes.
