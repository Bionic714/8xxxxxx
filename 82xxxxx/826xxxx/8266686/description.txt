An Italian film director (Maurizio Nichetti) is invited to a tv studio to introduce his black-and-white neorealismo film classic, Ladri di Saponette (The Soapsuds Thieves, a takeoff on de Sica's Ladri di Biclicette). Appalled by the constant intrusion of tacky commercials (in color), which actually get mixed into the film when a local power outage hits the studio, the director manages to insert himself into the movie as well, so that he can put things right.
