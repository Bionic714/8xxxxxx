late 2010 mbp
10.8.3
2.4 GHz intel core i5
8gb 1067 MHz DDR3

best thing to do is set the graphics all to low, drop the screen resolution. the colors sometimes glitch where everything will look pink or blue tinted. the other problem is that the cross hairs on scopes and red dots do not work. other than that everything seems to work fine. been playing for 3 days now and am seeding 24/7. if anyone knows how to fix the crosshair problem please let me know... would really like to be able to use a sniper rifle."

,patwik,2013-05-21T06:34Z,"@noobnak, I have 3.4GHz Intel Core i7 with 8 gig RAM running 10.8.3 and when I click on the Far Cry 3 icon the app starts up but just sits there doing nothing. Is there anything I can do?"
,noobnak,2013-05-21T15:58Z,un-zip the file with archive utility
,patwik,2013-05-23T01:30Z,Thanks @noobnak but it isn't the decompression of the file thats the problem but the application itself doesn't run after I have decompressed it
