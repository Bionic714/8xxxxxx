You're a fickin RETARD. This movie REQUIRES SUBTITLES for the settings and for a few non-English parts, moron."

[T],CODYBOSS1969,2013-05-14T01:04Z,"Too low bitrate [424 KBPS] for video stream=too many artifacts

The stream is about 3 hours long, so the final size of this avi file should be about 1.2 Gb with over 800 kbps BVOP =max =4; Qpel=No;  GMC=NO [for compatibility] QF[Quality Factor ] about 0.160.

See for yourself a proper rip [avi] of the english version of Cloud Atlas:
