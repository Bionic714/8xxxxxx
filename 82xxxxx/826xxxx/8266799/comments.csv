your torrent

King Of Pop Michael Jackson 21 in one DVD

has no seeders and never has."
[T],prodallasosoft,2013-03-21T10:38Z,"These torrents were seeded for a 7 day period.I watched as my seeds slowly disappeared from my torrents, Since you have no prior experience creating or seeding your own torrents I will forgive you indiscretion. Even my leachers slowly disapear. Did you seed? double click or pull up propertys on any given torrent and check box to seed. Thank you for you helpand advice KESThai"

I jumped on this torrent within 24 hours of its creation and have never had more than 22% delivered to me. uTorrent shows many having exactly the same percentage. Leechers disappear because they give up on you for NOT delivering your torrent. As for my experience I have plenty in private torrents. Just because I do not choose to create public torrents here means I have no experience. 

You Sir are a total waste of time."
