Now, does ANYONE know where to get the English subtitles?  I've looked EVERYWHERE, but I cannot find them  : (

Please post the link here if you find them!

Thanks!"
,drtrance,2013-03-18T21:21Z,"@TheLathe:

Yeah, no English subs as of yet. I've looked everywhere too and no luck. Shame, because I was really hyped for this movie..."
,Johnnydingo,2013-03-18T22:47Z,no English subtitles ? are we suppoed to lip-read ? 
,S3nd41,2013-03-19T04:26Z,I'm looking for subs too...
,TheLathe,2013-03-20T08:53Z,"That's the French for you...  : )

Bloody B@stards..."
,TheLathe,2013-03-20T08:56Z,"I'm downloading a 500 Meg version of the film right now from some cheeeeeeezy RapidShare like site on the off chance that it just MIGHT have subs.  If so, I'll snag them and post them here.

(Don't get your hopes up...)"
,TheLathe,2013-03-21T20:34Z,"@ Johnny Dingo

Heh, I appreciate the enthusiasm and funny comment, but uh... (cough...)  even if you DO lip read, uh, guess what the language is STILL gonna be...?    : )

I gotta good laugh outta that one!

No subs yet people; let's say we all get together and kick the sh*t outta the French!!!! (Yaaaaay!!!)"
,TheLathe,2013-04-21T04:54Z,"Okay, I've found German, Hungarian, and Slovak Subtitles for this film...

BUT... No English...

C'mon mate, have a heart. Most of us aren't French... : )

Cheers!"

Praise the lord for that!

Just like those dirty, cowardly, stinky, vile, eternal peasants to leave out the subs.

DOWN WITH THE FRENCH! 
(and their smelly/hairy/hideous women too)"
,gabriel1475,2013-05-07T08:13Z,"Here's a thought lads. Since it's been available for quite a while now, and since it appears there is no one kind enough to put the English subs online, the only fix for those of you wanting to see it right this very moment is to download the free program Subtitle Edit, and use its translation feature for the German, Slovak, or other subtitles which do exist for this film.

It's a very simple program, and it's free. But the problem, as you can all guess, is that you are at the mercy of a typical translation program. I think it's powered by Google Translator.

So the subs will sometimes read like: ""Expediently, we shall attend. Poultry yawned for this, and notwithstanding hitherto accusations are deemed unnecessary by the gentry.""

It will probably be enough to get the general meaning, but the one or two times I watched a film with Google translated subs it was annoying as having a Frenchman at your table.

Well, almost."

,TheLathe,2013-05-29T03:33Z,"Heh, you guys are great!  : )

The bugger of it is that the reviews are saying that this is a really good film, so...

I can imagine what watching it with Google translated subs would be like.  But, good suggestion since we so far do not seem to have any alternatives.

Oh, and OF COURSE...  NO ONE who actually IS French and does speak English will BOTHER to provide these for us...  NOPE...  Never gonna happen...

Such a NICE people...

: )"
,TheLathe,2013-05-29T03:36Z,"Well, at least this IS good news!
