,anuk671,2013-03-19T19:56Z,"I installed but it's asking for an installed copy of Sims, how do i fix this?"
,SenoritaBaffle,2013-03-20T21:52Z,"I had similar problems with it saying ""the disk is not in"" and whatnot. I solved my problem when I copied the TSW.exe and the TSLHost.dll files, it had said that I already had a file under the same name: TSW.exe. So I replaced it and everything worked fine. Last time I did it I kept both files but with different names, which was what screwed up the whole thing for me. Hope it helped."
,ikoreo,2013-03-21T00:34Z,"I'm having the same problem as anuk, It says i need to have the sims 3 disk to install. How do i fix this?"
,jhayv014,2013-03-21T03:41Z,"There is this problem, i have downloaded it completely but when i start the Setup it does not continue it only say ""This product requires an installed copy of sims 3, instal sims 3 before installing this product"" please help thanks.."
,pseudonym21,2013-03-21T17:20Z,"Games4theworld, you legendary bastard. Works like a charm, first time, not a single issue. I love you, man."
,Orginalme,2013-03-21T22:59Z,Alright so I downloaded your fine torrent but when it came time to play the game it said disc could not be found all of my sims 3 games have been downloaded from you except world adventures and the base game so could you help me
,JongPoo,2013-03-22T07:53Z,"----> ""This product requires an installed copy of sims 3, instal sims 3 before installing this product"" "
,Comr,2013-03-22T08:16Z,If people are having trouble where it is asking for a CD that means you did not crack it or did not crack it properly. If it is asking for a full version of the Sims installed thats because this is an EXPANSION and not the full game. If you are missing d3dx9_31.dll then you must INSTALL/REPAIR Direct X9/11.
,mkkayiak,2013-03-22T17:30Z,"is this an expantion? 
do i need the sims 3 onstaled to playsims 3 university?"

,traitergurl,2013-03-25T01:16Z,seed plz its going incredibly slow
,M1nt3a,2013-03-25T05:34Z,"I downloaded it and I'm seeding but I'm afraid to install it because I don't want to bork my game with any glitches that are EA's fault. >_<

How buggy is this expansion at this point?"
,thetank77,2013-03-25T06:43Z,I recommend downloading the FLT version since with this version there is not iso for you to mount so you cant actually play the game since it will always ask for a disk. even when you put in the crack.
,andrew09211,2013-03-26T00:35Z,"PEOPLE PLEASE, DO NOT COMPLICATE YOUR LIFE, YOU DO NOT NEED TO USE ANY CRACK , I HAVE NOT CRACK ANY OF THE SIMS I HAVE INSTALLED AND I HAVE ALL THE 18 EXPANSIONS, ALL YOU NEED IS TO GET ""(powerISO) FREE
MOUNT THE .ISO LATES INSTALLED EXPANSION INTO THE VIRTUAL DRIVE, AND THAT SHOULD BE ENOUG TO BYPASS THE CD CHECK. 
LIKE I SAID, I HAVE NOT ISTALLED ANY CRACK AND IM PLAYING RIGHT NOW 
email me if you need help, andrew09211@hotmail.com"
,mrcrogman,2013-03-26T00:36Z,Does anyone know of a trainer that works with the university life expansion? Please reply with a legit link or trainer/hack.

,llikdaor123,2013-03-29T20:26Z,do all the expansion packs from games4theworld work with the sims without bugs?
,ValenVictus,2013-03-30T01:55Z,"I registered and logged in just to say this.

Guys if you're getting a new crack every time EA shoves out another unfinished buggy money grab expansion for ""The Sims 3"" just so you'll have the latest version and be able to download mods, stop it.

EA sucks, developers are treated like disposable property of the corporation and their art is destroyed by EA's greed and they treat the mod community like shit so don't even bother with cracks there's a MOD that will get everything working.

Use the NRaas_NoCD.package instead, while you're at it get the NRaas Master Controller you REQUIRE it to take care of long standing bugs that are super fucking easy to Fix that EA just won't fucking fix.

,Idalline,2013-03-30T16:36Z,Listen to andrew09211;  he is right. I did not have to crack anything either.

,murderouspie,2013-04-16T16:04Z,"FOR EVERYONE WHO IS HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THE CRACK/IS GETTING THE NO DISC ERROR: You have to apply the UPDATED crack! It's on games4theworld's website. This torrent works PERFECTLY fine if it's done right! Go to their website (NOT THEIR ACCOUNT ON PIRATE BAY) and find the download they have called ""The Sims 3 Ultimate Fix"" it's a zip file with some folders in it, and it has all the updated cracks for every expansion as well as an instruction guide. Follow the instructions perfectly and you'll have no problem running your game :) I made an account just to post this lol trust me it's not that hard! They should have included it in the description though"
,darahs111,2013-04-18T09:48Z,Is this the FULL game or just an addition to the Sims game? Please comment..
,s0usa,2013-04-21T16:13Z," SO MANY QUESTIONS BUT MY IS MORE IMPORTANT :D ....

JUST KIDDING

SO I INSTALL THIS EXPANSION PERFECT .

I DO ALL  THE SHITS YOU SAY AND HAVE RESULTS.

WORKS.

I GO TO THE SITE OF THIS GAME4THEWORLD AND DOWNLOAD THE SIMS 3 ULTIMATE FIX.

AND WORKS .

BUT STILL IS A PROBLEM EVERY TIME I GO PLAY . THE GAME WORKS 10 MINUTES THEM CRASH THE SCREEN GO BLACK AND THE GAME CLOSE.

I THINK IS THIS CRAP EXPANSION.

,skr618,2013-04-22T07:27Z,@andrew09211 does it work with daemon lite?
,countryraj,2013-04-25T21:31Z,"It says ""the sims 3"" is needed.
Do i need to download that game too ?"
,jJkiller,2013-04-25T23:10Z,ARE YOU KIDDING ME??!? A FINE DOWNLOAD BUT NO FRIKIN SERIAL CODE??
,koksispid,2013-05-05T16:29Z,The trick with Sims 3 games is to paste the crack of every expansion into the BASE GAME folder! You shouldn't be getting the NO-CD problem when you've done that. Hope I helped.
,pyfib,2013-05-06T03:10Z,fuck this torrent. it fucked up my sims 3 install.
,LukeBongwater,2013-05-20T21:46Z,"Ok...... so I figured all these expasions out... First install the sims and update it to v 1.50.56 using EA download manager/Origin, then go on the Bay here and find the crack for v 1.50.56 and crack it. After that just install all Games4theworlds expasions only installing the cracks for the ones thats make you install in the expasions game/bin folders... NOT the Sims 3 game/bin folder since you cracked it with the 1.50.56 crack. All the expasions that dont have expasion cracks just install the game its that easy.I have every expasion and all the store stuff up and running and it is the shiznit! easy as pie!"
,Marypossa,2013-05-21T17:38Z,"Hello, firstly, thanks for these awesome torrents, every single one has worked for me so far, well except for this one. I installed it all right, it seemed okay while i played, but once my sim travels to college, shortly after arriving the game crashes saying that there has been an unhandled error or something and the ""do you wish to debug it"" stuff. i'm on a Mac Mountain Lion. Any ideas? thanks!"
,SoftKitty87,2013-05-22T22:15Z,copy and paste the crack into Bin then delete TS3.exe then it wil work. keep one with TS3W.exe that came in crack folder.
,assburp,2013-05-23T01:06Z,"Alright guys, I made an account just for this!
So I found a way around some complications that people are having.

Step 1: Have Sims 3 base game (duh)
Step 2: Install whatever expansion you want using poweriso or daemon tools.
Step 3: Find where you installed the expansion too.
Step 4: Open the folder (ie. The Sims 3: University Life.
Step 5: Open 'Game' folder.
Step 6"" Open 'Bin folder'.
Step 7: Open the application that starts with TS3.

I found that by doing this I didn't need to use the crack on the main game and just open this up and it would launch the game with all saved games intact. Haven't had any complications with any of the expansions yet. If you need help with my steps above, email me at candyman34896@hotmail.com."
