I have been using Minitool home addition and it's a great program. It will be nice to have these added features, plus the bootable media to do things without Windows running giving you less limitations.

Thanks for all your hard work and time invested."

1. There is no pwbmb-setup.zip file. (as written in ReadMe file)
2. 'ISO Image Recorder' from the dropdown of ""BootMediaBuilder.exe"" created an iso file of size 344K, What is the use of this iso file and how will I make ISO image to burn it on CD/DVD ?
