*PLEASE NOTE: These file sizes are a little large...perhaps too large for some of you out there.  However, to maintain a good quality comparable to the original, this had to be.  The reason being is that there is a lot of grain in these older clips.  The only way to reduce the file size would be to either increase the crf (making it a lower bitrate), but that would make things more blocky.  Or to apply a denoise filter.  However that would smooth out the picture, losing the original grain and essentially the detail.  To me, the file size is worth it since this is such great t.v.

*PLEASE NOTE: These are some old clips.  So please realize that even though these are from dvd, don't expect pristine quality.  I did the best that I could, making the quality close to the dvd, but there are limitations with the source as one would expect.  Also, once in a while the audio will go tinny, etc., or you will hear a slight hiss...please note that this is on the original dvd's too and can't be easily removed. This is minimal and overall the audio and video are very good for what you would expect from video this old.

Please seed when you are finished downloading. It seems a good rule of thumb is to upload at least as much as you've downloaded (1 to 1 ratio)...thanks!

CRF encoding maintains a constant quality for all encoded videos.  It adjusts the file size/bit-rate as needed (every video is different!) to maintain the desired quality. "CRF"...file sizes never too little and never too big...sized just right to maintain a constant high quality across the board.
