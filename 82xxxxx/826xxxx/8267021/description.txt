Patch for: The Cave for Linux (c) Double Fine


BEWARE: THIS IS NOT THE FULL GAME! THIS TORRENT CONTAINS ONLY THE LINUX PATCH RELEASED ON FEB 23!



This is the updated Linux binary which fixes various sound and crash problems. You will still need all the other game files to play this game! 

This binary is compatible with the "The Cave LINUX-HI2U" release. Just decompress this file with "gunzip Cave.bin.x86.gz" and replace the main executable. Have fun!
