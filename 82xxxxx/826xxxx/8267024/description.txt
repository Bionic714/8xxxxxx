Crackerjack is really good comedy that simply makes you laugh. I won't tell you the story here - better to watch this movie as a virgin and just have a good belly laugh as you go along.  Suffice it to say that Crackerjack was my favourite Comedy of the year!

If you insist in comparing Crackerjack to The Castle, Dimboola etc., then Crackerjack is light years ahead of the rest -  in my mind better than Muriels Wedding and on a par or better than Crocodile Dundee.
ENJOY
