A collection of books that pertain to socialist/worker's-movement theory, history, movements or figures, with a focus on more recent works that aren't often available on public-domain archives. Not every book is explicitly socialist in outlook; there are a handful of books in here that just relate to important developments in history that might be interesting to a socialist (for example, [i]King Leopold's Ghost[/i], a study of the horrors of Belgian colonialism in the Congo Free State, or Judith Butler's [i]Undoing Gender[/i].)
