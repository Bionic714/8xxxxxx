New Universe is a comic book imprint from Marvel Comics that was published in its original incarnation from 1986 to 1989. In 1986, in honor of Marvel Comics' 25th anniversary, Editor-In-Chief Jim Shooter launched the New Universe line of comics. This was to be a distinctly separate world, fully divorced from the mainstream continuity of the Marvel Universe, consisting of its own continuing characters and stories in a more realistic setting. Includes all New Universe character appearances up to newuniversal that I could find. Also has all of newuniversal that I could find. If there are any problems with this torrent let me know please. Not sure if I did this right.
