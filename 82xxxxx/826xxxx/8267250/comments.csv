Thanks uploader :)  This is what I did complainers lol, (Step 1): If you don't know Spanish like me, get your android phone out or tablet(if you have 1) or get on another computer. (Step 2): Stop being lazy and Go to the android market and download.. type it this way..... Spanish English dictionary + made by ascend. or go to another computer and search for a Spanish translator there. (Step 3): use the translator to install windows 8 on your computer..DING, DING. Easy as that lol. And it didn't take long. After My installation finished the screen went black, so I wasn't sure if it finished or not but I restarted my computer after waiting 3 minutes and BAMM windows 8 started up just fine. P.S. this may not happen to your computer like mine. (step 4): After windows 8 start up connect your internet to your computer. (step 5): Go to this link  http://en.kioskea.net/faq/28761-windows-8-change-the-system-language  and it will tell you how to change your system settings to English. Now as you are doing so use the translator on your phone or another computer to get to all the steps needed to change your settings. ******* It's not that hard ppl. You just have to be smart about it. Let me know if you have any problems doing it my way. Its simple to do this if you are use to installing windows on a computer because you usually know what they are going to ask. YOUR WELCOME!"

,Telsiph,2013-03-27T18:21Z,"Do NOT download, even after the annoying process of going through the install in Spanish, successfully changing the regional settings to English (which does require a download despite what the uploader states) there are still two major issues.

1. The OS has still been installed in Spanish, and there are some prompts and opening menus that simply cannot be changed to English.

Also, do you know of a way to change the startup text from Spanish to English? For instance, at the login screen to your account you can see the ""Password"" box is in spanish. This is because each user has its own language settings, but I do not see the settings for the overall ""language""."

,Namostaztan,2013-04-01T18:32Z,"This is a fantastic torrent! As the name suggests it IS Windows 8.

Unfortunately I failed to notice the signs that this is indeed a Spanish version, because there are none. Not in the tags nor in the title. After downloading 4 Gigs of precious microsoft product, you'll still have 91MBs more in the form of a language pack.

Other than that this really is a miraculous torrent, since the title suggests the downloaded windows to be pre-activated. I was please to see that it isn't. If it in fact was, I once again failed to read the details as to how to achieve that during the installation.

All in all I'm happy to have downloaded this 4GB gem and I just want to say:
Nice job! All information regarding this torrent is correct!"

,miguerr,2013-04-23T23:31Z,"Hi there peeps! 

I'm gonna talk about changing to English language and the black screen of death.

This version is indeed in Spanish, although it is very easy to change to English...I think you need to pick your keyboard settings in English during setup for this to work, although i'm not 100% sure on that...anyways, when your computer boots after installation and initial setup (user, internet settings, etc...) do the following to download the language pack (~100mb) and change to English language:

1. Take mouse pointer to right hand corners (top or bottom) and a sidebar will slide out.

2. Click on Settings (last button, has a ""cog"" or ""gear"" wheel)

3. Click on Control Panel (second from the top or Panel de Control)

4. Click on Clock, Language and Region (third from the top on the right hand column) and then on Language (second option*

*Alternatively you can click on ""Add a language"" directly from the Control Panel window from step 3. (first option under the clock, language and region category)

5. Wait a few seconds and a option to download the missing english language pack will appear next to where it says ""Windows display language"", click on it and follow the instructions!

You will need to restart your computer, but if I'm remembering correctly a simple log out from your account will do...

Also, for those of you who got lost up there, here's another guide by Microsoft, it has different steps but it's basically the same thing, it uses the search function to get to the language window.

http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2607607

EASY FIX, GUYS!


Now, about the black screen of death, I've read about a whole lot of people on forums having issues with this, and there are different solutions since everybody has a different computer...For me the problem was the 1.video driver and 2. avast! antivirus...

So what I did what this:

If your computer boots to a black screen with a movable cursor the trick is to boot up in safe mode and uninstall/update the video drivers.

I read you can boot up in safe mode when computer is starting up by pressing SHIFT+F8 but there is also another way for those of you who can't seem to be able to boot from bios...

1. When your computer is on the black screen of death, press the ""windows key+L"" on your keyboard, this will Lock your computer.

By now you should be seeing a huge picture of something, probably a cartoonish rendering of Seattle with space needle and all.

2. Click on whichever part of the screen and it will slide up.

You should now be on the login screen

3. Click on the power icon on the bottom right corner and (VERY IMPORTANT!) press SHIFT on your keyboard and click RESTART (WITH SHIFT PRESSED DOWN)

This will initiate a quick boot into recovery mode...

After you are in recovery mode click on:

1. See advanced repair options (first option)
2. Troubleshoot (second option)
3. Advanced options (third option)
4. Windows startup setting (last option)
5. Restart

Here's a screenshot guide:
http://www.howtogeek.com/107511/how-to-boot-into-safe-mode-on-windows-8-the-easy-way/

After your computer boots in safe mode you should uninstall you video graphics program from uninstall programs in control panel, and reboot in normal mode, if this doesn't fix it, go into safe mode and uninstall video drivers from device manager and reboot, one of these should work and your computer will boot fine without the dreaded black screen...

Also, in my case the black screen came back after installing avast! 8 antivirus, and was fixed again after uninstalling it in safe mode...

Another tip: USE SYSTEM RESTORE POINTS!!!! at least at the beginning when installing new programs, make a restore point right before installing it and in any case you can just go back to the previous point, google it if you dont know how to do it in windows 8, it's REALLY EASY...For me the only problem was avast! 8 and the graphics driver...once i uninstalled and downloaded the newest version everything worked fine...

Also, this version of windows is not properly activated, there is about ~2-3 features you cant customize (p"

,vantyg619,2013-05-07T21:12Z,"2 Golden rules to follow while downloading this torrent :-

1.DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT.
2.DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT.

Now to less important things. The OS is in frigging Spanish. Even if like me,after wasting your time, bandwidth and what not, you somehow manage to install this, maybe justin bieber will start making good songs but language won't change for the OS.

only bad thing about this torrent is that it is actually activated."

kuego de que instala le dan al boton de activar , sacan los dvd o pendrive, reinician y listo.

,elblatter,2013-05-25T13:24Z,"It works a treat. Just have a little patience if you cant understand Spanish and use another device to translate screens during install (google goggles was great, just take a picture and it does it for you). First mount image to usb or dvd and install, then once installed you can go to Control Panel (move mouse to bottom right of screen and click Settings), the choose Add a Language and download the language of your choice (click options to activate it). Then once installed and enabled go to Language Preferences, then Location (bottom left) and select Administrative, then select Copy Settings button to change welcome screens, login screens and user accounts to chosen language too. Bam! everything is as it should be. Then download MSToolkit to activate Win. Update it as you want.. Fully working, no probs..... so far :)"
