,zippospam,2013-03-25T02:14Z,"Im getting this error after trying running the installer as Admin setting it as trusted software and the error keeps appearing
Note: For some reason the installer appears in japanese (most be my configuration) and the only language I could identify was spanish so the translation would be something like this
""it wasn't posible to recover the installation folder! the installation has been interrupted."""
