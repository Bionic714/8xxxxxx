,CommonsCarnival,2013-03-18T00:25Z,Thank you. Seems to work but I haven't really played-around with it. Be sure to block the program in your firewall as it will try to verify the serial as soon as you launch it.
,stevo7181,2013-04-04T15:41Z,im kinda new to this what do I do after download
,stevo7181,2013-04-04T16:15Z,work great so far. Instructions were in spanish but I figured it out thanks :)
,Joey249,2013-04-06T04:04Z,"Thanks it worked :)
Here are the steps translated into english:

1. - Disconnect internet access.
2. - Run the file ""disable_activation.cmd"" (run as admin in vista/7/8).
3. - Install the program with the data:

USER ....: www.mundomanuales.com
SERIAL ..: (any of these)

CD2AA-QZBHD-C3KJL-E9HRV-Q797C
HLCZF-HDCPL-KGB6W-ZSCAZ-VF6A2
EA5AC-CLMAM-A8W6W-EZLYM-LM58F
HLCZF-HDCPL-KGB6W-ZSCAZ-VF6A2
CD2AA-QZBHD-C3KJL-E9HRV-Q797C
GCABC-CHPs-BPMMB-XAJXP-S8F6R

PD. You can use the keygen to generate other data if you have problems with the current.

Ready!!

,xXCakeXx,2013-05-14T16:20Z,I will follow the instructions in the NFO file. But did anyone else tried the NFO file's instructions? Did it work?
,xXCakeXx,2013-05-14T16:23Z,"I've just found out that the disable_activation.cmd file does automatically edit the hosts file for you, like what the NFO file said. >__>"

,kelleytoons,2013-06-01T23:41Z,"Are we sure this will stay working?  It says you can use it for now until they *can* contact their servers, but that sounds ominous (as if perhaps a clock is ticking somewhere).

Anyone's stopped working?"
