,Kangarooo,2013-03-21T13:40Z,Its not English.... Installation navigation is english and many languages but installing can be only 5 lang like German and Frensh and something but its not English.
,CapPanda,2013-03-28T20:38Z,It says that one of the languages is en_US.  What are you even talking about?  More importantly if en_US isn't included? Just get the language pack from Adobe's website.  It free to download.
