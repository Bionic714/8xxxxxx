i read the instructions and got that this program works only on 64-bit. what about 32-bit? explain me please........

thanks in advance."
,hlebar4e,2013-04-12T09:21Z,"there is no 32-bit support, because the program requires tons of ram, as you can see, and 32bit windows can address up to 4 gb of ram, so there's no point in releasing a 32-bit version"
