Making him a name for himself with a stellar debut (2009ΓÇ▓s The Great Rearranger) and a weekly residency playing old-school country covers at Houston clubs, EllisΓÇÖ latest release is full of snapshots of a man growing more mature. Some of the songs are actually downright cute, with Ellis singing about the day-to-day aspects of life and love, such as painting a house with his woman (ΓÇ£Two Cans Of PaintΓÇ¥), driving back from an out-of-town gig to be with his woman (ΓÇ£CominΓÇÖ HomeΓÇ¥), and the strains of being in a relationship with the woman (ΓÇ£WhatΓÇÖs In It For Me?ΓÇ¥, ΓÇ£No FunΓÇ¥).

The album is very distinctly split down the middle, and Ellis gives listeners a taste of his influencesΓÇöboth folk and country. PhotographsΓÇÿ first five tracks are mellow folk songs with softly strummed acoustic guitar and subtle pedal steel, while its second half is made up of full-on country romps and ballads (helped along by drummer Ryan Chavez, guitarist Kelly Doyle, bassist Geoffrey Muller, and pedal steel guitarist Will Van Horn). The shift in styles is abrupt at first listenΓÇöand was likely designed to be played on vinylΓÇöbut is further evidence of how masterfully Ellis crosses genres.

Although PhotographΓÇÿs folksier moments bring to mind the sincerity and simplicity of early James TaylorΓÇöespecially on the impressive opener ΓÇ£Friends Like ThoseΓÇ¥ΓÇöEllisΓÇÖ classic country influences are apparent throughout. The albumΓÇÖs most countrified moment is ΓÇ£WhatΓÇÖs In It For Me?ΓÇ¥ (available on limited edition vinyl at his website and which you can stream here), a throwback reminiscent to any number of 70s-era country songs. And thatΓÇÖs the beauty of EllisΓÇÖ music: itΓÇÖs good enough to hold its own with the greats (he gives nods to ΓÇ£Lefty, Willie, Hank, and TownesΓÇ¥ on ΓÇ£CominΓÇÖ HomeΓÇ¥) while still appealing to a diverse audience. Where a lesser musician playing this style of music might come off hackneyed or derivative, Ellis instead brings a smooth, irony-free approach that lends honesty to his songs. And thereΓÇÖs not much more a listener can ask of an album.
