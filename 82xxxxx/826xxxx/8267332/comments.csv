Don't download, wait for the vinyl rip"

DR10 vs DR6 from the CD & this HD version (which uses the same master as the CD and is pointless because the songs were originally recorded at 24-bit/48kHz)

Vinyl DR10: http://www.dr.loudness-war.info/details.php?id=35893"
,gamerforever3,2013-03-27T19:56Z,"I add: vinyl rips at 24/96 is pointless too in this particular case and for most listeners, but the important thing is DR (dynamic range) of the master used."
[T],rjordan21,2013-03-27T22:53Z,It's all about the source...... regardless of bit length or sampling rate.
