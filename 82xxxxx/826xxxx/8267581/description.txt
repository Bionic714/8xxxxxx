After countless shows and loads of media attention, Kopecky Family Band is set to release the highly anticipated debut album Kids Raising Kids. With a seemingly endless run of touring over the last five years, the band has grown into one of the most exciting acts to come out of NashvilleΓÇÖs recent hotbed of indie music.

While co-founder Kelsey Kopecky is the namesake of the band, the six members take the family moniker to heart, each playing various instruments to produce a warm homegrown sound wholly their own. In many ways, Kopecky Family Band encapsulates their hometown of Nashville: emergent, vibrant, Southern, and deeply rooted in a musical background that creates a truly distinctive character. Just as their city has come a long way, the LP arrives as a culmination of years of hard work for Kopecky Family Band. From the sound of it, Kids Raising Kids may be the first big step towards an ever-rising future.
