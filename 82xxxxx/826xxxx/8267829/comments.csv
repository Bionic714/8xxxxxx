,katytron,2013-03-18T02:09Z,"A CLASSIC! I think that article helped me get in to comics though, weirdly enough. I realised that everyone was just like ""we do not speak about the 80s/90s okay""."
,cliftonenrico,2013-03-18T02:55Z,"first: i want to thank you for the great upload.

using at that time 
advanced computer technology???
i don't see it anywhere!!!!!!!!!"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-18T02:57Z,"there were good things in both decades, unfortunately for several years the bad things sold a lot more copies than the good!

anyway i posted that link and then found myself wasting another hour going through it again. lol"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-18T03:10Z,"about the lightning, that's what the white jagged lines in the background of the cover are supposed to be! look at the original cover here: http://image2.milehighcomics.com/istore/images/fullsize/60042367456.100.GIF

it probably isn't important, but this reprint came out 1-2 years after marvel bought malibu comics, in part because they had a computerized coloring process that marvel could use. this seems like an early example of playing around with computer graphic ""enhancement"" of the original cover art."
