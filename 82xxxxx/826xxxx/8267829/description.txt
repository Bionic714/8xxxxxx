ELEKTRA MEGAZINE 01-02 (1996) Complete 
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8249924/

These Megazine titles were published by Marvel from 1994 to 1996 and are reprint titles similar to the 100-Page Monster format (96 pages of comics + covers). Unlike the Monsters, which had a new Marvel comic combined with 2 or 3 reprints, these had 3 or 4 Marvel reprints in each issue. None of the 7 Megazines lasted more than 6 issues.

I believe that this is the only Megazine that didn't have new cover art. Instead, they re-colored the Rob Liefeld cover of New Mutants #100 -- and added some lightning -- using what was (at that time) advanced computer technology.

Another cool thing about these is the cover-2-cover scans include all the awful ads for other Marvel releases. (Even their house ads were terrible in the mid-90s.)

Unfortunately, the Hulk and Spider-Man Megazines don't seem to have scans floating around the Internet!
