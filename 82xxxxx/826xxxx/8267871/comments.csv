[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-17T20:30Z,that one's easy -- degu2012's torrent with ultimate comics ultimates #1-22 including #18.1: http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8230135/
,Ichthypod_Crane,2013-03-18T03:30Z,"I tried the Marvel CMC's for the Spider-Man Megazine but, since they are primarily reprints, only the front covers seem to be scanned in."
,Oneiromancer12,2013-03-18T03:36Z,"Thanks for the Spectre link! (although it's almost 8 gb and it only has 5 seeders, I hope it works.)

I know I have requested too much but I humbly ask for ""Sandman Mystery Theatre"" and ""Wildcats vol. 2"""
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-18T05:16Z,"Ichthypod_Crane, yeah. too bad.

Oneiromancer12, use uTorrent -- it loads the file list and you can de-select all the issues you don't want before downloading. that's a must-have.

wildcats volume 2 is on my list, and sandman mystery theatre, well a search gave me http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8209379/"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-19T00:47Z,"Oneiromancer12, i didn't get around to it, but look what Anonymous did: http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8273350/Wildcats_%281999-2001%29__1-28__Annual_2000_%28Complete%29"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-19T02:58Z,"well hit the brakes and call me a liar, but that damn torrent doesn't appear to have been seeded! damn damn damnity damn"
,bgg1175,2013-03-26T06:46Z,"I collected many comics from this time period but I'd never had the pleasure of seeing this one. 

Thanks for the upload. "
