Joystick Mapper is an application for Mac OS X that lets you map keyboard keys, mouse axes, mouse buttons and mouse wheel to any joystick or gamepad button/axis/hat.

In other words: This App will let you play any game or use any app with any joystick or gamepad, even the ones that are not compatible with joysticks.

Features:

Use any axis, dpads or buttons on your joystick to simulate keyboard and mouse;
Map any of the 4 directions from an Analog Stick independently;
Analog Shoulder Triggers can be used as buttons;
Smooth mouse movement;
Adjust mouse speed for analog sticks per direction individually, this can help with crappy gamepads;
Any "weird" combination you want:
Button/Dpad/Analog Stick/Analog Trigger --&gt; Keyboard/Mouse/Click/Scroll;
Ready-to-use examples, easily modifiable;
Compatible with USB and Bluetooth Joysticks;
(If it does not explicitly say "Mac compatible", please check compatibility. I have a list of tested gamepads here, please help expanding it)
Easy to use interface.
Requirements:

A Mac with OS X 10.6.6 or higher;
One or more USB or Bluetooth joysticks/Gamepads;
Just a little bit of disc space.
