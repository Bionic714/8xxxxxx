The single track Mid Hants Railway heritage route ΓÇô affectionately known as The Watercress Line ΓÇô runs for 10 miles from Alresford Station, through Ropley, Medstead & Four Marks and then finally to Alton Station where the railway links to the mainline.

All the stations feature custom assets including buildings, signal boxes, footbridges and at Ropley the restoration sheds. In addition smaller station signs, lights and even the 'You're approaching the Strong Country' art deco posters are included at Alton and Alresford.

The route features authentic signalling, including semaphore signals between Alresford and Medstead stations and the new colour light signals at Alton. At Ropley the signals are modelled on the yet-to-be-commissioned signal diagram, as are some of the signals at Alton, so you can experience the signalling before even the real train crews have!

Be sure to watch out for the AWS warnings along the route as all distant semaphore signals have permanent AWS ramps.

The line follows an accurate gradient profile, climbing out of Alresford at 1-in-80, which rises to 1-in-60 half way between Ropley and Medstead, then be prepared for a four-mile slog on the run back from Alton up another 1-in 60-gradient!

Ten enjoyable scenarios are included to keep you busy!
