,rayr_1,2013-03-20T16:52Z,Thank you. I use both OS's and can use this often.
,rayr_1,2013-03-20T22:56Z,I could not activate beyond the 15 day trial. It would not accept the serial as it always forces you to their web page for the purchase of a serial.
,hoizerl,2013-03-23T21:04Z,"@rayr_1 Maybe try to uninstall and reinstall it. When installing, enter the serial when it is still in the Installer app."
