Description:
Pale Folklore is the debut album of the American band Agalloch. It features an eclectic mix of acoustic folk reminiscent of Scandinavian bands such as Ulver, doom and black metal-esque riffs, growled, clean, whispered, and shrieked vocals, and a production style and atmosphere that borrows heavily from black metal. The lyrical themes focus mainly on depression, nature, folklore, and the supernatural. It features the roots of a post-rock influence which is greatly expanded on in AgallochΓÇÖs second studio album, The Mantle.
