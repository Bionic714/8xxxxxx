Description:
Something Wild is the debut album by Finnish melodic death metal band Children of Bodom, released in 1997. The album presents a darker and generally more experimental sound than the one present in their later albums, and contributed most to the infamous genre controversy of their classification as a death metal or black metal band at the time. A fair helping of black metal was still present, due to Alexi LaihoΓÇÖs stint (as lead guitarist) in Impaled Nazarene and his self-professed ΓÇ£roots being in black metalΓÇ¥.
