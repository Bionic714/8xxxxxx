Rock 'n' Roll is a 1975 album of late 1950s and early 1960s songs covered by John Lennon. Recording the album was problematic and spanned an entire year: Phil Spector-produced sessions in October 1973 at A&M Studios, and Lennon-produced sessions in October 1974 at Record Plant Studios (East). Lennon was being sued by Morris Levy over copyright infringement of one line in his song "Come Together", as part of an agreement, Lennon had to include three Levy-owned songs on Rock 'n' Roll. Spector ran away with the session recordings, later being involved in a motor accident, which left the album's tracks unrecoverable until beginning of the Walls and Bridges sessions. With Walls and Bridges coming out first, featuring one Levy-owned song, Levy sued Lennon expecting to see Lennon's Rock 'n' Roll album.

The album was released in February 1975, reaching number 6 in both the United Kingdom and the United States, later being certified gold in both countries. The album was supported by the single "Stand by Me", which peaked at number 20 in the US, and 30 in the UK. The album's cover was taken by Jürgen Vollmer during the Beatles' stay in Hamburg. The album would be Lennon's last until 1980; he took a hiatus from recording to raise his son, Sean Lennon.
