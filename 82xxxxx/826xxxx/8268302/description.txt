(I'm using Discovery Channel's Episode Order)

One of Russia's most popular hockey teams is on its way to Minsk, Belarus, for their first game of the 2011 season. Their Soviet built Yak-42D starts down the main runway at Yaroslavl's Tunoshna Airport. But instead of lifting off, the plane runs off the end of the tarmac, strikes a tower and crashes into the Volga River. Only the plane's mechanic survives the disaster. Around the globe, fans mourn the biggest tragedy in the history of the sport. Russian President Medvedev demands answers, and investigators are under tremendous pressure to find out what went wrong.
