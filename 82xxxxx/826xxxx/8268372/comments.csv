[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-17T22:03Z,"not to be a dick, but this torrent has spawn/batman from image as well as batman/spawn from dc, at a fraction of the file size (about 28MB for both): 
http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/5975634/Spawn__1-198_%28__Specials%29"
,KryptonX7,2013-03-18T14:29Z,"Well, you are a dick. Who the fuck wants to download a 4gb file for a few comics?"
,coyb85,2013-03-18T17:54Z,"you can select the files you want to download from the 4gigs when you add the torrent to your torrent client, and STFmaryville is just trying to help out cus this torrent only has one seeder..."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-18T22:10Z,"hey KryptonX7, this is what you wrote: ""After searching endlessly through the internet, there was no sign of an English version of this awesome comic."" well, it took me 2 minutes to find this awesome comic in another torrent, 2 minutes to download it, and 2 minutes to post my comment.

""searching endlessly"" my ass. learn how to use torrent software. you can download 1 file or 100 files from a large torrent, and it ain't hard to figure out.

and here's the important part. your scan sucks! you wrote ""Who the fuck wants to download a 4gb file for a few comics?"" well WHO THE FUCK wants to download a 350MB file for ONE MOTHERFUCKING COMIC?

and this, by the way, was me being a dick. now suck on it, bitch."
