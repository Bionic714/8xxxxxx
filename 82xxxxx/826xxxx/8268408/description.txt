Holy terror is one of my favourite bands of all time. And since I love listening to them since 1987 it's not something that is going away soon. As matter of fact I saw them live twice, once with DRI and once with Death Angel.

These guys make very technical metal. But where a lot of technical metal bands but with great artistical value, fascinating lyrics and amazing musicians and fantastic compositions.

Allas they never got a wide audience, probably since they we're too complex. They just never fitted in any category nor did they sound like any other band.

The music industry that just got attention for metal ignored them completely and promoted all the less experimental bands.
