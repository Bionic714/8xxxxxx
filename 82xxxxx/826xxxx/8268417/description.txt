Spoutcraft Version:

=What is spoutcraft?=
Spoutcraft is a client mod that enhances gameplay performance. You can easily customize the graphics with view distance, details, shaders etc. Spoutcraft also enables you to set up your own keybindings. Whether it be commands binded to a key, or change what buttons make you move.

If a server is using plugings that require spoutcraft (GUI plugins such as SpoutHelp, or item plugins like Guns+ or ManaBags) you must use spoutcraft to get the full potential. However, it is not required to play.

=============================Cracked by XiiCandySackiiX============================

Download the .jar file and place it anywhere on your PC. Double click to run and allow it to download the necessary files before playing.

This was cracked on Linux and runs fine. I tried it over on my Windows partition and it had a little trouble (I think it was my connection) it kept returning errors. However, after it finally downloaded all the necessary files it ran fine. 

Any problems, please post them down in the comments.
