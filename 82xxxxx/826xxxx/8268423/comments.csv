,lobo8WR,2013-03-19T00:13Z,"please, god, let this be the true high-def version i have failed like a dozen times to find.

download is excruciatingly slow.  twenty minutes and still 0.0%

seed, people!  seed!"
,lobo8WR,2013-03-19T00:25Z,seed please!
,bboywhat,2013-03-19T12:23Z,"there is something seriously wrong with either the screenshots or the encode...

and why didn't they cut the black bars? AR should be about 2.40:1

i wouldn't trust this...

get either of these instead:

[T],vonRicht,2013-03-30T19:49Z,Great with a version in the right aspect ratio. Seldom to find. Thanks!
,swafbro,2013-04-06T02:26Z,"How good is the audio of this one? Just fine, or great?

There is this 35 GiB version, also DTS 7.1:

http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8213837/The.Hobbit.An.Unexpected.Journey.2012.BluRay.1080p.DTS-HD.MA7.1-

The video is not 10-bit, but it comes with 4 audio tracks in 4 different languages.

So, can this 19.71 GiB come with better video quality and the same audio quality as the other one?

If someone would post the MediaInfo for this one, I'd appreciate it. Specially the video/audio % of total size."
,Struwwel,2013-05-01T18:02Z,Just the screenshots are messed up.  The video is fine
