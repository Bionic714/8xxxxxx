2013 Scottish League Cup Final St Mirren v Hearts (Kick-off 3.00pm 17-03-2013). 

Rob Maclean presents live coverage of the Scottish League Cup final at Hampden Park, where the Scottish Premier League teams face each other. The Buddies claimed a surprise 3-2 win over Celtic in the semi-finals to progress to this showpiece match, while Hearts triumphed over Inverness Caledonian Thistle via a penalty shoot-out after the match had finished 1-1 following extra time. Neither side has had much success in this competition, with Hearts last winning it in 1963 - their fourth overall victory - and St Mirren seeking a maiden success after finishing as runners-up on two previous occasions, most recently in 2010. With commentary by Liam McLeod and Billy Dodds, and analysis from Gordon Strachan, Jim Jeffries and Charlie Adam.
