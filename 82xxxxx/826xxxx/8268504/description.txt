Some Feelings Can't Be Masked

A life... dedicated to laughter and joy. Sounds pretty fulfilling, right? But for an ex-circus clown, all that laughter and those zany antics often mask the true longing that lies within. And, when the object of that longing happens to be the luscious Kaylani Lei, a clown's life ain't all it's cracked up to be.

Sometimes, the mask just has to come off.
