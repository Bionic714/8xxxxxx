Mind Games is John Lennon's fourth album, and was recorded and released in November 1973. Like his previous album, the politically topical and somewhat abrasive Some Time in New York City, Mind Games was poorly received by music critics. It reached number 13 in the UK and number 9 in the US, where it went gold. The album was recorded at Record Plant Studios, and was produced solely by Lennon.

The album was recorded at the beginning of Lennon's 18-month separation from Yoko Ono.
