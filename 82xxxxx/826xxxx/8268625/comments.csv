,Gwiggle,2013-03-18T11:36Z,Worth the download. Unmatched quality
,antipants94,2013-03-18T12:00Z,"unfortunately the 48fps is doubled from the original 24fps using motion interpolation

you can tell from the sample, the most obvious example is the artifacting around Thror's head when it's panning on him in the gold room

just letting you all know"
,Majklll,2013-03-22T19:25Z,"The subtitles doesnt work,and sound is slowed.. :/ any ideas..? Im using BS Player.."
,romper67stomper,2013-03-23T23:13Z,"I""m using Media Player Classic and every 2-3 mins, the sound drops out for 1 second.  Any ideas?  Otherwise MPC is brand new and it plays everything else flawlessly...except for this file."
,romper67stomper,2013-03-24T00:43Z,"I goofed around with the render settings and I""m beginning to think my PC just can""t keep up...time to trade the old 2 core in!"
,kiwij,2013-03-27T08:39Z,LOL 48FPS + Source = BluRay... THE BLURAY IS ONLY 24FPS!!! so basically your just doubling every frame.
,abdullah_mag,2013-04-15T12:26Z,"please seed, this is horribly slow.
as for the so called ""artifacting"", it's only the glare from the torches due to the camera's focus being on the foreground, i see no problem with the quality."
,abdullah_mag,2013-04-15T12:49Z,also you guys having problems might wanna try play this with VLC media player on a PC with a proper gpu.
,abdullah_mag,2013-04-15T18:27Z,for crying out loud SEED
,abdullah_mag,2013-04-15T18:42Z,"for a relatively new torrent, it is pretty dead.
Seed OP please, i will seed after i download, just let me finish it first."
,abdullah_mag,2013-04-16T18:06Z,FOR THE LOVE OF GOD SEED!!!!
,Zozur,2013-04-19T08:21Z,"For all the people who think this is interpolation, which has increased the fps, it's not interpolation, but actual rip of the original 48fps version of the movie."
,damouse1,2013-05-09T15:35Z,"Works lovely with MPC-HC. A lot heavier on the system than ordinary video of course. Some international characters in subtitles tend to be wrong though, like if they're all in cyrillic or something.

The movie company is probably not going to give us a  48fps 2D version, so this is as good as we'll get for now. Thanks!"
