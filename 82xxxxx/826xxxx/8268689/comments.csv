Thanks for the upload Mr footy =)"
,milopeng,2013-03-18T13:24Z,All hail footy! thanks for the hardwork! 
,rc90029,2013-03-18T16:11Z,"Thanks a lot footy,  as always the 50fps is much appreciated.  "
,Pakosan,2013-03-19T02:48Z,"PROBLEM!!

First of all, thank you very much.

The English track is the same as the Russian track. In other words, there is no English audio.

Can anyone confirm this and hopefully provide a solution?"
,rc90029,2013-03-19T05:53Z,"Pakosan, try media player classic.

I played this file using vlc and got the same problem, but then i got the skysports english audio when i played using mpc."
,rc90029,2013-03-19T05:55Z,"Also footy if its not too much trouble,  can you upload the pre-race / post-race from skysports hd?  

If you can't its fine.  

Regardless, thank you for all your efforts. "
,Pakosan,2013-03-19T10:08Z,"@rc90029

Thanks for the reply. I only have MPC installed so I'm out of luck on that one.

I tried using Handbrake to delete the non-English tracks but the English track still yaps up Russian.

I'm stuck."
,sush24,2013-03-19T11:28Z,"Thanks footy!

For mpc and vlc, right click, audio and choose your language. Both work fine;)"
,milopeng,2013-03-19T13:44Z,Pls also include the pre n post race thx
,PloC4,2013-03-19T18:51Z,"All audio tracks work just fine in MPC or VLC. Right click, audio, select track."
,chjbc,2013-03-19T22:13Z,"Hello footy, love your work. can you please upload BBC's highlight version as well? Thanks"
,FlankerB1,2013-03-20T22:17Z,"Well, I actually only need English audio, so I'll run this through mkvmerge to remove other audio tracks and keep only the English one."
,integls,2013-03-30T07:28Z,Thanks again mate!
