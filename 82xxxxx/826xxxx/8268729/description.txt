SPORT: Six Nations Rugby Union - Wales v England
On: BBC 1 HD
Date: Saturday 16th March 2013 
Time: 16:30 to 19:00 

John Inverdale introduces live coverage from Cardiff as Wales take on old foes England on the final weekend of the 2013 Six Nations. England ended a three-game losing streak in Cardiff when they won on their last Six Nations visit to the Millennium Stadium two years ago, but Wales were the victors in last year's clash when they triumphed 19-12 at Twickenham on their way to sealing the Grand Slam. Things did not go quite so well for the Welsh in the rest of 2012, but nothing stokes their fire quite like a visit from England, and a full-blooded encounter can always be expected. Expert analysis comes from Sir Clive Woodward, Jeremy Guscott and Jonathan Davies, with commentary by Eddie Butler and Brian Moore.
