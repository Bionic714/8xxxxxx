When US Navy personnel are confronted by an unknown alien structure during war-game trials, they quickly realise the enormity of the threat facing them. As the aliens unleash a terrifying barrage of destructive force on the Earth's population, Admiral Shane (Neeson), captain of the USS John Paul Jones, finds himself caught up in the fight of his life as he leads a fleet of ships into battle against the seemingly invincible extraterrestrial armada. Alexander Skarsg√•rd, Taylor Kitsch and pop singer Rihanna co-star.
