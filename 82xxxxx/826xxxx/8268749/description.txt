On: BBC 1 HD 
Date: Saturday 16th March 2013 
Time: KO 14:30

Live coverage of Italy v Ireland on the last day of the 2013 Six Nations. The Italians will be hoping to finish the tournament in the manner they started, following an incredible win over France on the opening weekend. However, they will have to defy history if they are to beat Ireland - they have not beaten them in 13 previous Six Nations encounters, including a 42-10 loss last year. For Ireland's players it will be a last chance to impress on the international stage before the British and Irish Lions squad is picked for the tour of Australia this summer. Commentary by Conor McNamara and Phillip Matthews, with expert analysis from Italian legend Marco Bortolami.
