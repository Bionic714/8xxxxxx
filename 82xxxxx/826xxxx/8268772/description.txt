Gabby Logan introduces live coverage of the final match of the 2013 Six Nations as France take on Scotland at the Stade de France. The French have endured their worst ever start to a Six Nations campaign to put the pressure firmly on coach Philippe Saint-Andre. However, they have only lost to the Scots once in the Six Nations era and never on home soil. In fact, Scotland have only managed two victories in France since 1969. Commentary by Andrew Cotter and Lawrence Dallaglio, with expert analysis from Andy Nicol.
