A Show of Hands is a live album by the Canadian rock band Rush, released in 1989. The album was recorded in Birmingham (UK), New Orleans, Phoenix, and San Diego during the 1988 Hold Your Fire tour as well as in the Meadowlands (East Rutherford, NJ) during the 1986 Power Windows tour. The opening track "Intro" features the Three Stooges theme song "Three Blind Mice" playing in the background; the band used this jingle to open many of their concerts during the 1980s. A Show Of Hands was remastered again in 2011 by Andy VanDette for the "Sector" box sets, which re-released all of Rush's Mercury-era albums. A Show Of Hands is included in the Sector 3 set.
