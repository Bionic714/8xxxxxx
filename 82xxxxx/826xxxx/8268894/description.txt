Live at Mile High Music Festival is a live album by the Dave Matthews Band from the 2008 Mile High Music Festival outside Denver, Colorado. In its first week of sales, the album debuted at #97 on the US charts. The concert featured many old songs such as "Don't Drink the Water", "Two Step" and "#41", as well as more recent songs such as "Corn Bread" and "Eh Hee".

This is the first album to be released by the band without saxophonist LeRoi Moore and the first to feature Bela Fleck and the Flecktones saxophonist Jeff Coffin for the entire set. Coffin stepped in for Moore after he was in an ATV accident.

Tim Reynolds also sat in as a guest for the complete set, as he did throughout the 2008 summer tour.

It was released on Tuesday December 16, 2008.
