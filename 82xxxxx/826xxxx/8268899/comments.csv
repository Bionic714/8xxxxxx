[T],tifon,2013-03-19T18:04Z,Hello. Disc 3 - 15 track error.
[T],mikesanderspqrs,2013-03-19T18:37Z,"OK, don't know what happened there cos log file reports no errors. It plays OK as an individual track.
You could try rebuilding it in mp3Tag."
[T],mikesanderspqrs,2013-03-19T18:49Z,"I forgot to say thanks for info tifon.
I cannot rebuild cos it'd damage the torrent link (I think?) and nobody would be able to download anymore from me."
[T],mikesanderspqrs,2013-03-19T19:51Z,"I've now corrected the error.
See:

as an addendum to this torrent!"
,WasAtWoodstock,2013-03-19T20:35Z,Thanks for the fix. I'm still seeding it and hadn't looked at it yet.
,kkaucher,2013-03-20T02:35Z,"There's no error in the copy I downloaded; it plays fine. No issues, FWIW."
[T],tifon,2013-03-20T07:34Z,"Thank you uploader, 15 track correct no error!!

VLC player OK!!!


WasAtWoodstock, tpb no upload?? Dem fantastic uploader."
,kenncomm,2013-03-21T05:55Z,"To all concerned: the problem was that the combination of folder titles and the name of the song together exceeded the characters allowed by windows. Shorten the song title, and it plays just fine."
