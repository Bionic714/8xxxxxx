,inthemistbythehills,2013-04-18T20:06Z,went out of sync almost instantly
,casper89,2013-05-12T16:09Z,@ZeRoLiMi This is a shit upload. Don't try and be a fucking hero by taking one of YIFY's fucked up uploads and trying to 'fix' it as you claim when really you're just an attention whore who thinks he can encode. Your upload is shit and I'd rather YIFY's out of sync version than your shitty upload which doesn't even work. Prick.
,ZeRoLiMi,2013-05-28T01:33Z,casper89 dude take it easy man! no need to get all but hurt! you don't have to use it but at the same time you don't need to act like a little bitch! I thought I make my own and use it! Its not out of sync for me but if it is for you then go ahead and get the other one and fix it and seed it instead of crying like a little bitch and complaint about it!
