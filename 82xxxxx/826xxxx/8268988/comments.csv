,dandalis,2013-03-18T01:12Z,"never mind, this patch more like downgraded my fps than upgraded even with latest GeForce driver..."
,Cad45,2013-03-19T13:48Z,"There seems to be a problem on closing Tomb Raider 2013 even after the current latest patch has been installed... When you close the game and check the system processes, you can see the game TombRaider.exe is still open and using at least 350MB of RAM. When you try to kill the process you get an error message, any fix? "
,pcbflare,2013-03-23T13:21Z,so does this work with black box release or not?
,euphoria4949,2013-03-26T16:33Z,"Going from v1.0.710 to this v1.0.722.3 made a massive difference to my FPS and overall smoothness of gameplay.
So, if like me you're running an Nvidia GPU and having low FPS and graphical issues download this update it's a big improvement.

My FPS benchmarks on ultimate settings with TressFX ON, (special hair), was around: 
62 min - 76 average - 91 max (v1.0.710)
Now with the update it's improved to:
98 min - 122 average - 142 max (v1.0.722.3)

Guess I should have downloaded an update for it a lot sooner =)

Thank you Mr.Stifmeister =)"
