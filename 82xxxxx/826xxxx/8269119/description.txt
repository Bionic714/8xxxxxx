Townes Van Zandt - 2000 - In Pain - Live
320kbps


The mid-to-late '90s found the walls closing in on renowned country/folk troubadour Van Zandt. As his physical and psychological travails took an ever greater toll on him, his performances became increasingly erratic, sometimes difficult to watch, as he often virtually self-destructed right before one's eyes. 

Fortunately, the too-appropriately titled IN PAIN--which features various European live performances from 1994 to 1996--cherry-picks the most intense, rewarding moments from Van Zandt's last haunted years. 

The ghosts gaining on the singer's soul give the songs an added weight. The harrowing struggle against existential pain in Nothin', written early in Van Zandt s career, seems here like a self-fulfilling prophecy. You Are Not Needed Now, Townes' ode to the late Janis Joplin, could be his own eulogy, eerily delivered in advance of his passing. Even the tender ballad Katie Belle Blues, written for Van Zandt s daughter, gains in poignancy given the darkened context in which it appears. 

There are several live Van Zandt albums, but when it comes to the latter-day ones, IN PAIN is as good as any.
