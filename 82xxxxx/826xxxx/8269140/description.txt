Season Two
Aired on DISCOVERY CHANNEL CANADA, January - March 2013


Series Description:
They've got an opinion about everything and can get out of a tight spot better than MacGyver with a paperclip! CANADA'S GREATEST KNOW-IT-ALL - is the ultimate brain-busting competition, featuring 10 of Canada's biggest self-proclaimed smarties, competing head-to-head in a supersized arena of grit and wit to prove just who is CANADA'S GREATEST KNOW- IT-ALL. Testing their superior knowledge, problem-solving skills, leadership, cooperation and game-playing strategy, this eight-part brains-and-brawn competition series is the perfect forum to test their mettle. They love to be right, despise being wrong, and are usually the loudest voice in the room - and they don't always play well with others!

NOTES:
Special thanks to CBM for capping the entire season.  The scene missed an episode or 2, so I am including all 8 CBM caps in this upload.
