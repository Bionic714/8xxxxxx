,Dable1,2013-03-18T05:34Z,This is the best XP that I've used compare to others. Thank you so much for keeping this updated. :-)
,davotglov,2013-03-18T07:53Z,can it be installed through Bootable usb ? i tried the 17-02-2013 one and got hal.dll error ..  i tried all the options there including editing the boot.ini file .. but no luck
,LuxLOL,2013-03-18T14:30Z,"You had no luck beaches you did it wrong you have to run the option 1 first and then the option 2 two times or you will run into this error.
You should also Read the latest Read Me file it is now recommend to use Rufus instead of WinToFlash beaches this one is more user friendly to make an USB Flash Installer."

,Trueblue1878,2013-03-18T21:54Z,"Sadly can't get this to work on my friends laptop.. he needs XP on it ASAP and don't have time to mess around. 
I burned it to disc and the computer wouldn't boot from it or detect it as a boot disc. Yes I set BIOS to boot from disc and yes I tested another boot CD an that worked..
I tried putting it on a USB stick using the Rufus program and directions from the readme.. and I get missing EULA file. I tried 4 different BIOS ID's in Rufus but no luck.

This is far too much messing around to install XP.. glad it works for some people but it shouldn't be this hard. "
,LuxLOL,2013-03-18T22:12Z,"A Windows XP can not fix peoples PC problems or mistakes and if you had read the last Read Me file then you would found this ->

(o) Troubleshooting:

* If you do a USB Flash installation and you get a message like this ""Setup cannot find the End User Licensing Agreement (EULA)."" then you should do this:
1. In Rufus click on the ""Format Options"" and then select the option ""Use Rufus MBR with BIOS ID:"" and then try all this options out till it works.
2. Before start Rufus disconnect all storage devices from your computer except the Windows one and remove all the drive letters from your Partitions except the Windows one (To remove the drive letters got to ""START -> Control Panel -> Administrative Tools -> Computer Management -> Disk Management- > Right-Click the Partition -> Change Driver Letter and Paths... -> Select Volume -> Remove"")."
,Trueblue1878,2013-03-19T01:35Z,"LuxLOL, I did read the readme.. as I said, I tried 4 different BIOS ID's.
I didn't try unplugging all my other drives because that would cause me a lot of problems with other programs which depend on those drives being active. 
As I said, its just too much hassle. I appreciate your work but it shouldn't be this hard to use.
It doesn't even work when I burn it to CD either.. it doesn't get detected as a boot disk.
I have gone with another one now ; http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/4535425/Windows_XP_Professional_SP3_-_Activated

And it seems to be working fine.. I would have liked your version but don't have time to get it working :( I have a couple of hours to get Windows, Security and Office on this laptop before my friends flight leaves so I wanted a quick install. 

But I will definitely try your torrent again when I have more time..

FYI I read some forum posts about Rufus and I think if you place the i386 folder on your C drive (C:i386) it fixes this EULA problem but I didn't have time to try.. but maybe someone else can get it working this way.

Cheers!"
,Trueblue1878,2013-03-19T01:41Z,"Here is the link to the post about the EULA and a possible fix http://reboot.pro/topic/17902-rufus-v130-has-been-released/?p=164639

Also guys try v1.2 if 1.3+ doesn't work."
,LuxLOL,2013-03-19T02:14Z,You can try WinToFlash if Rufus doesn't work for you. But way it doesn't boot from the CD is strange because no one every posted a problem like this and I myself install this on a lot of old PC's.
,Dr.BARTON,2013-03-19T18:34Z,"Nice share, thank you, bro!

Why'd you remove the Custom Windows XP Theme ""NeoGeniX LS v1.0""?"

,juanallaro,2013-03-24T19:50Z,"When I am booting to my new Seagate Sata drive, I tried USB, but no luck.  When trying to make a CD, the file size is too big with the added programs for a CDR.  I have Cheetah DVD burner.  Do I need to go under make a bootable Windows XP disk and then have it convert the iso file?

,sund4y,2013-03-24T23:07Z,Just wanted to say thanks. I used the older version with a burned cd method and it worked wonders. Trying the new one with rufus and for some reason doesn't work. Going to give Win2flash a shot.

 I just found out my PC has a 64 Processor so does any one have 64 bit Windows XP Black Edition any help would be great  Thank you"
,LuxLOL,2013-03-28T08:02Z,"You only need a 64-bit OS if you have more than 3GB of RAM. Installing a 64-bit OS on 3GB or less RAM Computer will only slow your Computer down because a 64-bit OS will take more RAM than a 32-bit OS.
If you need a 64-bit OS than you should use Win7 64-bit because WinXP 64-bit is not a good 64-bit OS."
