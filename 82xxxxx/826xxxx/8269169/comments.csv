I do have to make a quick comment about the description though, which I'm assuming you did not write yourself, so please don't take this personally.

Describing 'Master Control' as a ""villainous software pirate"" is not at all correct, and if anything it's Kevin Flynn who's the pirate. He believes programs should be free, Free as in beer AND free as in speech, while 'Master Control,' who is basically like today's Apple, or Microsoft, wants to control all programs. He wants them to do and think as he wishes instead of giving the individual program/user complete freedom.
This movie might be cheesy, but it's actually a brilliant metaphor for today's battle between those who fight for a free and open internet and the companies and governments who want to censor and control every corner of the web (and our lives).
It could even be taken as a metaphor for the fight against totalitarianism.
I probably put too much thought into it, but I really like this movie, haha."

,w00tbie,2013-04-21T07:44Z,"@piratebuddha true true, the whole Tron mythos is a human vs state metaphor. And the writer started working on the story in 1976, so it preceded the internet by many years. And now it's become even more relevant, considering humans are now immersed in what could be described as the grid, a network that could be either a conduit for free expression or a tool of control for the state. I see the story as one of the important myths of our times. Tron lives! "
