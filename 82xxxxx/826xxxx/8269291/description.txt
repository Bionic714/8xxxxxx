Show Description:
Based on the hit A&E format, Intervention Canada, is a one-hour documentary series that takes the viewer deep inside the roller coaster of addiction. The series provides an unflinching glimpse at the horrifying reality of the life of an addict, as well as the gut-wrenching toll their addiction takes on their family and friends. With the help of  interventionists Andrew Galloway, Maureen Brine, Joey Marcelli and Sue Donaldson, each episode culminates in a dramatic intervention where the subject must make a life-and-death decision ΓÇô continue their descent to rock bottom alone, or accept the offer of a clear path to recovery in one of Canada's top addiction treatment facilities.

Capper note:
Season 2 aired in 2012.
Unfortunately,this show has not been broadcasted in HD.
CBM capped the last 2 episodes of the season for me, many thanks!

Slice announced last month the show was NOT picked up for season 3, it is cancelled.

Although this is a spinoff of the American show INTERVENTION, this is completely Canadian.
If you like the American version, you'll like this one too.
