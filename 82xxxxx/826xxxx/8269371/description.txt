Notes:

These are excellent rips made from the DVD editions into Mkv files. The quality is superb, and all episodes are the complete and uncensored originals. They only lack the opening and closing titles. This is an advantage in order to watch many episodes comfortably and without interruption. The only flaw is that the opening & closing titles are totally missing. I personally coundn't find them anywhere except in YouTube.

If anyone would ask, I got these rips from an other torrent. After that I renamed the files, sort them into folders and added some extra features which I downloaded from elsewhere, such as the soundtrack album and the four movies.

VIDEO recommendation: In the nowadays average case of having a widescreen monitor or TV, now it'd be perfect to set your player (such as VLC) to an aspect ratio of 16:10.

AUDIO recommendation: For all non-Japanese speaking people, it is strongly recommended that you keep the original Japanese audio and help yourselves with the English subtitles. In case you use the VLC player, to set the Japanese audio track as default during a playlist, paste the characters μùÑμ£¼Φ¬₧ in: Tools&gt;Preferences&gt;Audio settings.

Enjoy!
