,wsimon98,2013-04-19T01:14Z,this is the episode that has been banned. it has the boston marathon and peter running everyone over. then later him as a muslim blowing up 2 bombs within a few seconds of each other. purely coincidence but still... FUCK Seth MacFarlane. gun grabbing piece of shit.
,wrecktem,2013-04-20T09:24Z,"Yup. This is the episode with the Boston marathon reference. Lots of similarities with the recent events, like even the muslim part matches up."
,ViolentC,2013-05-12T15:39Z,"Everyone should download this episode and show it to your friends and family. 100% Proof Boston Bombings was a setup. 100% inside job, they knew it was going to happen. This episode of family guy is proof. No such thing as a coincidence and Peter killing everyone to win the boston marathon and then setting off two bombs is beyond coincidence. I heard this episode was deleted from TEVO Machines and will never be aired or released on DVD. TPB is the only place you will find this. Seed forever. "
