,casidios,2013-03-19T10:31Z,Waiting an AVI version
,rick80,2013-03-19T15:04Z,"600 million .mp4 versions and not one .avi

There are millions of older media players out there that will only play .avi

Why do all the releases ignore this and continue to release .mp4

It's such a waste of time. Only one person needs to release .mp4 not 10 of you.

Release a .avi you chumps!"
,sillymilly77,2013-03-19T17:13Z,please avi version
,nerded,2013-03-20T22:11Z,"Instead of complaining about not having an avi version, why don't you take the time to record and upload it yourself?"
,pipp00,2013-03-20T22:37Z,"I, too, prefer AVI.  Why are some episodes done in AVI and others are not?"
,hevehitta,2013-03-23T20:46Z,"I have grown very fond of this show :)  

I don't mind mp4 or avi, I'm not sure I can tell the difference with quality between the two. Isn't mp4 just more popular now due to the iPad/iPhone?"
,demujin,2013-03-25T12:59Z,"Why is AVI better?  Just use VLC which will play almost anything you throw at it. Anyway, it's a 30 minute TV show, is file type really so important?"
