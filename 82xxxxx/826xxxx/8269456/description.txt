On this Sunday March 17 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex breaks down an unprecedented plan by the IMF and the EU to raid the bank accounts of Cypriots in order to pay for a bankster arranged bailout of the Mediterranean island nation. Thousands of citizens are making desperate runs on ATMs to get as much money as possible before they lose a big chunk to the global Mafia. The outrageous move will undoubtedly accelerate the economic crisis in Europe as markets adjust accordingly and depositors in Spain, Italy and Greece make bank runs to protect their devalued currencies from criminal expropriation. 

Alex also gets into the remarkable exchange between senators Ted Cruz and Dianne Feinstein on proposed gun legislation and the latest effort by the United Nations to force through its gun-grabber treaty.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
