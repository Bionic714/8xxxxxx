OKΓÇª. Where to start?
I am NO Teacher by NatureΓÇªso all I have is my personal Knowledge and the deep Will to teach you what I
know. But thatΓÇÖs no bad Starting-Point, hm?!
In the Folders you have now on your Machine, there are some very important Files we need to get Things
done!
They`re called:
- Instrument_info.nkc
- Instrument_imfo.nkx
- Wall-Registry-Template.reg
Now the next Screenshots and me will teach you what to do with them.
Don`t worryΓÇª its easy if you concentrate!
