[T],vonRicht,2013-03-18T17:54Z,"Btw forgot to tell in the above information that the included Commentary audio with Ridley Scott is taken from the Theatrical Cut of the movie, so it wil propably not synch that well with the Extended Edition of the movie. I haven't checked . But nonetheless it's included. :)

Furthermore the film summary above is the wrong one. My bad. Here's the right one:

In 1970s America, a detective works to bring down the drug empire of Frank Lucas, a heroin kingpin from Manhattan, who is smuggling the drug into the country from the Far East."
[T],vonRicht,2013-03-18T18:16Z,It would be NICE if Piratebay got their edit button function for uploads up and running again!
[T],vonRicht,2013-05-06T03:37Z,"NOTE: I've just found out, randomly, that this movie and 3 other of all my torrents ever uploaded that the soundtrack is encoded as DTS 1509 kbps instead of DTS-HD MA as I thought.

Everything else in the film file is working as my usual.

Sorry for the inconvenience and I hope you can live with ""only"" the DTS 1509 kbps

The 3 other movies is:

1. Martyrs.2008.Bluray.1080p.DTS-HD.x264-Grym

2. The.Thing.1982.Bluray.1080p.DTS-HD.x264-Grym

3. Phone.booth.2003.Bluray.1080p.DTS-HD.x264-Grym

Cheers

[T],vonRicht,2013-05-06T19:21Z,I will be uploading a new torrent of the film with DTS-HD MA audio in the upcoming future - a Promise!
