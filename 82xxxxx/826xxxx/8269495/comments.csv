,blint126,2013-03-20T22:15Z,did you check it out? really wanna dl if it's FL 10.10 BETA cracked.
,barms236,2013-03-21T06:17Z,"its cracked. copy the files from the crack/patch folder and overwrite the ones in the image-line/fl studio 10.10 directory.

a lot less bugs IMO than the 10.9 beta!!

,kyleditt,2013-04-05T01:50Z,"I downloaded, un-zipped and looked at the crack files without touching them; then I clicked the program to install and saw a dos box load. I ran the program again as administrator to check if that would force the program to run, it did not. I believe this was a virus, a trojan or some kind of way to log passwords or even credit card number. I do not use virus scan; if another person would like to test this go shall for it and comment with your knowledge so we may know exactly what this is or if I was doing something wrong. Thank you. 
I will shall check nearly everyday for a month to two so to see any comments from thus now on till then."
