"The Escape"

Desperate to escape Schiller, Marta makes 
preparations to flee the country with her 
children. But her plan is derailed when 
Irwin is released from prison earlier 
than anticipated. Far from feeling 
contrite about his time served, Irwin is 
full of new plans for the expansion of 
"their" business -- including making a 
deal between Schiller and a notorious 
marijuana kingpin. Meanwhile, simmering 
tension between Irwin and Andrei comes to 
a head when Andrei refuses to back his 
son's new ventures, and a coke-addled 
Mike stoops to staging a robbery of his 
own home to pay off debts.
