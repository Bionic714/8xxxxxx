,e8hffff,2013-03-18T10:55Z,Sick of them having Gays on as guests.  They talk crap and their sexual jives are off putting.  The other people usually have to bring back to conversation into normality.
,MailerDaemon0,2013-03-18T16:46Z,"@e8hffff: There's no one who's gay guesting on this episode...

The comediean made a single joke about having sex with the Govrnor then stabbing him afterword in parody of Andrea not being able to do that herself....

Your post is one of the most ignorant things I've seen since the last dumb posy here on TPB...  "
