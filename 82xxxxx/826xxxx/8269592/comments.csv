ULTIMATEHADES ALWAYS THE BEST CONTENT"
,Weho22212,2013-03-18T09:19Z,I was able to join my friend who has a legitimate copy. All you need to do with who ever is hosting is; edit the server.properties file (which is found in the same folder as the minecraft_server.exe file). Edit the file and change the online-mode option to false (instead of true). Restart the miencraft server and it should fix the problem.

Reinstall the game

Open the calculator GB in MB that will create the shortcut on the Desktop ..

as GB (1,2,3,4,6,7,8, ....) you have put the number in the calculator
GB and click calculator beside within

Now take the MB (example: 1 GB = 1024) Copy and paste the MB in the launcher
