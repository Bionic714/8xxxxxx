,NIT158,2013-03-25T16:09Z,"@rr-ne if you an an uploader too .. why would I tell you my secret ? ?

BTW ... I can give you a clue

source: 720p publichd -->MEGUI -->preset - slower "
,NIT158,2013-03-25T16:09Z,:) that's pretty much everything :))
[V],rr-ne,2013-03-25T17:20Z,"I've tried that encoder before, I didn't really like it, it was too complicated for me. Thanks anyways"
,NIT158,2013-03-26T09:33Z,"i've heard this before ..but actually it is not hard at all once you know what you're doing
then afterwards you'll get used to it"
[V],rr-ne,2013-03-26T18:39Z,"i use a very simple H.264 Encoder to convert The Simpsons eps that i upload. the conversion takes about 10 minutes..

The only thing i dont like about H.264 encoder is that it does not have a batching selection.

So if i ever wanted to convert more than 1 episode i would have to do it manually every 10 minutes and that would be so much"
,NIT158,2013-03-27T20:40Z,"h264(x264) is the best encoder till date
it provides really good compression without losing quality

It might not support batching but you can queue videos in it

come on dude yo need to work that much if you need a  45mb simpsons file"

,humantorchid,2013-05-11T16:24Z,"@NIT158 , I Think I Have Figured Out The Way To Convert Episodes Like This, Is It Ok If I Convert and Upload Episodes In These Format And Use Some Of Your Episodes In My Compilation? I Will Give You Credit For It."
,NIT158,2013-05-20T14:48Z,"you can do anything you want  @humantorchid

,humantorchid,2013-05-31T20:16Z,"Actually, I Miserably Failed... But Still, I've Added This Torrent And All Your Other Simpsons Torrents In My Compilation, And Have Given You Credit For it Too... Hope You Don't Mind."
