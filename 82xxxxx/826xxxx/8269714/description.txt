Ending the Silence on Climate Change-PBS Moyers and Company 031513 PTC

Remember climate change? The issue barely comes up with any substance in our current political dialogue. But bringing climate change back into our national conversation is as much a communications challenge as it is a scientific one.

This week, in an encore broadcast, scientist Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication, joins Bill to describe his efforts to galvanize communities over whatΓÇÖs arguably the greatest single threat facing humanity. Leiserowitz, who specializes in the psychology of risk perception, knows better than anyone if people are willing to change their behavior to make a difference.

ΓÇ£[A] pervasive sense up to now has been that climate change is distant ΓÇö distant in time, and distant in space,ΓÇ¥ Leiserowitz tells Bill. ΓÇ£And what weΓÇÖre now beginning to see is that itΓÇÖs not so distant. I have a nine-year-old son ΓÇö heΓÇÖs going to be my age in the year 2050. I donΓÇÖt want him to live in the world that weΓÇÖre currently hurtling towards.ΓÇ¥

The show also includes a short video portrait of photographic artist Chris Jordan, whose work helps us understand the scope of American consumerism and consumption.
