[T],momamedienta,2013-03-18T23:10Z,I tried to up it without zipping but there are apparently limits to the number of files allowed in a torrent and 460+ is just a few too many I guess.  This torrent is being actively seeded.  I will work on my collection of ebooks in epub format.  Look for it in the next few days!
