,darrentidd,2013-03-19T02:55Z,"OK, I've been solely downloading eztv torrents and sometimes they have EVOLVE at the end, and other times they have IMMERSE. Maybe I'm being an idiot here, but what's the difference?"
,topk,2013-03-19T19:11Z,"I second the question about EVOLVE/IMMERSE!
Maybe I'm autistic, but I like ordnung."
,Proper_Acid,2013-03-19T21:59Z,Seed for fuck sake its to slow!
,dr_huffrhurr,2013-03-20T01:06Z,@darenntidd - My understanding was that there are perhaps a number of different people who ripped these shows and that IMMERSE was one and EVOLVE was another. It never really bothered me before but thanks to you my OCD has kicked in and now I need to know as well  :/
,Pro2Type,2013-03-21T15:09Z,"For those who are wondering, IMMERSE and EVOLVE are two different capper groups. IMMERSE uses a low-quality video source for their releases, which is the reason why EVOLVE usually follows up with clean high-quality releases of the same episodes.

Because IMMERSE don't give a rat's ass about the crap they're uploading, EVOLVE seem to hate their guts, judging by EVOLVE's comments on other sites."
,war59312,2013-03-22T03:25Z,"IMMERSE is know for their suck ass releases.

Almost always have to be propered for one reason or another.

Probably the worse 720p HDTV group there is. Wish they would just give it up already."
,darrentidd,2013-03-25T04:51Z,"Hey, thanks for the answer guys! "
