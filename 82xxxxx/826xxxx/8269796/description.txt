Performances like this one are the reason I love the Dead!


Deadhead Comment:  
"You need to listen to this one start to finish. If you smoke, your bag will be gone.... You smoke cigs, you wont have time to during this one... You drink, you will feel drunk. This show is very mellow and yet has quick, energy filled songs in just the right spots. I would recommend this show to people who are not fans of '77....Not to mention, this show tells the future. I was listening to 'Fire On the Mountain' and all the smoke alarms went off.'
