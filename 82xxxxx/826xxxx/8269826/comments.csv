Borrowed a cracked steamapi.dll from Fairlight (checked it for viruses, none found) and used that in this release, so kudos to them."
,Junoh315,2013-03-27T15:36Z,"Thank you very much.  No viruses found by McAfee.  After I saw that other release (by THETA btw), I thought that a clean copy of Terraria was gone.  Thanks for proving me wrong."
,Darkprince01,2013-03-30T20:42Z,Thanks Man :) love this game
,ben556,2013-03-30T21:30Z,this bitch uploaded a fake torrent it doesnt even work it says terraria has stopped working before it even tries to open
,ItsWolfeh,2013-04-01T02:20Z,"I could not even open this either, when I checked task manager it was not even running, it won't launch."
,QBOSS82,2013-04-05T16:50Z,"If it does not work, check the installation folder and start the xnafx40_redist.exe it will help"
,ForbiddenSoul,2013-04-06T03:51Z,"""Playing Terraria is dependant on having both .NET 4 and XNA Frameworks installed on your machine. If you need to install these two components they can be installed by running
""dotNetFx40_Full_setup.exe"" and ""xnafx40_redist.msi"", located inside your Terraria directory.""

That is directly taken from the instructions the installer provides you with. You must do that if the game doesn't launch for you."
,darkfox01,2013-04-06T06:31Z,"excuse me, but it seems I have an error that looks like this http://imgur.com/b3sZzCS
