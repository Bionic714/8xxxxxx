My guess they show the 2 first episode the sam e night screwing up the schedule and last sunday (10) i had Dl ep03(not the preair) so it's time to air the ep04"
,kmb1989,2013-03-18T17:14Z,After the episode Airs on TV they put the next Episode on Hulu or History Channel website before they air it on tv the next week. so people could watch episode 4 online before it airs on the 24 and then on the 25th you can watch episode 5 etc.
,MulaManckBR22,2013-03-18T17:45Z,"Perfect Copy, This is the Vikings from History Channel 1x04 -- Trial... enjoy! Thanks DibyaTPB!"
,CapPanda,2013-03-18T22:16Z,"This is the Web Pre-Air episode.  With episode 4 they are now putting it online in HD due to the heavy popularity of the pre-air episodes.  Perfect copy by the way, thanks."
,Dlurker,2013-03-18T22:55Z,CapPanda thx for the info didn't know they preair HD now :D
,univ_code,2013-03-19T01:15Z,Is this 5.1 audio? Thanks.
,soviet001,2013-03-20T02:19Z,"Hmm... ok, but how do you get this in HD dibya? Even on Hulu+ the highest setting they give you is ""High"" 480p quality not HD. Is there some other popular paysite that offers the episodes??

Just checked Vudu also, no episode 4 there... I'm pretty sure you're not upsampling 480p, and anyway, your releases Dibya are always TOP notch so that wouldn't even be feasible in my mind :) So what's going on? Is it a secret?

Also, I understand this is a necessary publicity stunt for a show like this, airing on the History Channel, which not many look to for series -- still, it's a little unusual to present episodes 1-2 weeks in advance...

I haven't found a *single* press-release from History or anyone else about the matter, which is something you'd expect to find if this is such a publicity thing to earn viewers. I might have not looked hard enough, but regardless, shouldn't they try to have as much reportage on this fact that episodes are available ahead of time? Surely that would garner greater attention and win increased popularity!

Anyone seen/heard any coverage or promoting related to this anywhere...?


Oh, but yeah thanks again Dib, great releases for all tv shows, always so fast too! Scratch that, I meant to say *the fastest*. "
