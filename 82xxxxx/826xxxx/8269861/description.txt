thx guys

Encode:

last but not least, here comes a nice improved version of the Oz Movie,
i skipped the first cam around it was way too bright and had glare spots which were beyond repairing, waited for a good one
and finally THC came around and made my day, scenes at broad daylight were perfect and not overdone, but darker
scenes especially in the woods were too dark,also wasnt very sharp, but good to begin with.

since there is no way to make one setting for the whole movie i had no other choice than to cut the movie in loads of pieces
and treat every part as needed, brightness,contrast are adjusted now scene by scene without going over,
varies from +10% up to +50% on night scenes, 
added lots of sharpness to get the video cleaner, could have done a lot more if the source file were in x264, instead avi was used which cant handle a lot
without pixelation.
I also included 2 pics from the night scene where you can now still see
whats going on.

For the Audio, it was a nice line already, still heard some crackle here and there so ran it through some intensive filtering, sounds pretty nice now
The First half of the movie wasnt that perfect synced 150ms moved around back and forth all the time, so i had to resync it to get all lipsync.

Took me 2 Days to make it perfect

The Result is great and will do me till retail
enjoy

PS: the first 20mins of the movie are in 4:3 in black and white, same as in cinema, so not my doing, guess we have to live with that. :=)
