,PlstkSprk,2013-03-18T14:12Z,My question is... how is episode 4 available for download when episode 4 does not air until the 24th? Not that I'm complaining.
,nytstalk,2013-03-18T16:02Z,"@PlstkSprk The episode is already available on History's site, mate. This is a webrip, probably."
,buckeyeq,2013-03-18T17:59Z,"@plstkSprk What nytstalk said. At the end of every episode, they let you know next week's episode is available on History's site. "
