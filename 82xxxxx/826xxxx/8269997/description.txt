For much of the past decade Argentina has seen a commodities-driven export boom, built largely on genetically-modified soy bean crops and the aggressive use of pesticides.

Argentina's leaders say it has turned the country's economy around, while others say the consequences are a dramatic surge in cancer rates, birth defects and land theft.

People & Power investigates if Argentina's booming soy industry is a disaster in the making.
Filmmaker's view: Bad seeds. Monsanto's GMO boom rolls along like a juggernaut while those who profit turn a blind eye to the dangers and abuses.

More than 18 million hectares are covered by this GMO soya but itΓÇÖs not solely a matter of soya because over this plant on this huge surface more than 300 million litres of the pesticide Roundup have been used .

The dirty war to kill off campesinos to make way for the plantations, and doctors and scientists claim that babies are being born with crippling birth malformations, and that in recent years the incidence of childhood cancer has soared. These are regarded as 'historical' or just anecdotal.  But they are phenomena  that have coincided with the introduction of Monsanto's GMO seeds and pesticides.
