,bobbymagee41,2013-04-01T19:13Z,"You guys are complaining about people complaining. That is so silly. I too grew up with three channels and black and white TV. But as the one gentleman says, technology waits for no one. The reason for the comments is to tell people what it is they would be downloading, so please keep complaining or giving praise where due, that way I can make an informed decision to whether I want to download it or not"
