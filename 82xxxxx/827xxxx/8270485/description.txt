Mystery 360: Ghosts Behind Bars
Designed to keep inmates in absolute solitary confinement and restrict all contact between prisoners, Eastern State Penitentiary was a fortress built to lock away societies worst offenders. Most inmates during its early years descended into deep depression or madness. And since its closure in 1971, many have reported hearing eerie sounds throughout the prison, including voices weeping and tormented screams. Others have seen shadows dart in and out of cells. Now an unprecedented team of engineers from various scientific fields hunt for ghosts at Eastern State. Motion sensors are rigged, night-vision and infrared cameras positioned, acoustic triangulation systems set up, and 3D laser scanners shows the most detailed view ever seen of this prison. Find out if Eastern State is haunted or if it is all in our minds.
