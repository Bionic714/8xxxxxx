Art making is a wonderfully fun way for young children to tap into their imagination, deepen their creativity, and explore new materials, all while strengthening their fine motor skills and developing self-confidence. The Artful Parent has all the tools and information you need to encourage your childrenΓÇÖs creativity through art. YouΓÇÖll learn how to set up an art space, how to talk to children about their artwork, how to choose the best art supplies (without breaking the bank), how to repurpose and organize the piles of art created, and even how to use art activities to soften everyday transitions.
The more than sixty engaging arts and crafts projects included here are accessible and developmentally appropriate for one- to eight-year-olds, and theyΓÇÖre a far cry from the cookie-cutter crafts many of us did in school as kids. From bubble prints to musical chairs art, these activities allow children to explore art materials, techniques, and ideas as they grow more creative every day. With activities for downtimes, action art for releasing energy, and recipes for making your own art materials, this book is your guide for raising an artful family.
