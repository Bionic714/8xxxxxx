,led_zeppelin_2009,2013-04-04T21:05Z,Excellent & immaculate creation. Thanks a lot. However I would highly acknowledge & be grateful if you could provide me with the Webcam Software for Acer 5750G. I am using Win 7 (32bit). For some reason the webcam image is upside down & sometimes when it works it becomes sideways.
