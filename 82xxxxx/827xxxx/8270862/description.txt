Follow Me: The Yoni Netanyahu Story
July 4, 1976, Entebbe, Uganda - Led by Lieutenant Colonel Yonatan Netanyahu, crack Israeli commandos burst inside a non-descript airline terminal, killing stunned terrorists and evacuating 103 hostages. A lone shot sounds in the night, and Yonatan Netanyahu, brother of current Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, lay dead. Follow Me is an intimate story that penetrates the tough exterior of the only soldier killed in Entebbe. The narration for this compelling film was drawn from Yonatan Netanyahu's own letters and words, which unveil the complex character of this thoroughly modern young hero. Yonatan's words are deeply moving through his deep-rooted introspection, self-understanding, and heartfelt passions.
