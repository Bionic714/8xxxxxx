PLEEASE 
,a.kassa,2013-03-23T14:03Z,would be nice if downloaders cared about to seed
,a.kassa,2013-03-24T16:32Z,seeding
,NoWayNo,2013-03-24T18:55Z,I agree with you kassa it would be nice indeed nevertheless there's supposed to be 41 seeders atm but everyone is still stuck at 82.1%. Very strange.
,NoWayNo,2013-03-24T19:05Z,Apparantly they don't care since i see 41 seeders but noone is seeding. A lot of people are stuck for days now at 82.1%. Very strange.
