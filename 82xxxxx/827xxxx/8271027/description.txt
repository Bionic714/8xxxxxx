Debate of Professor Lawrence Krauss and Hamza Andreas Tzortzis: "Islam or Atheism: Which Makes More Sense?"

Details (from thebigdebates.com):
In the west, two powers are rising: Islam and Atheism
These two worldviews are at odds with each other, where Atheism claims to be progressive and based on reason and Islam claims to be relevant and reasonable. 

In this discussion we will be asking the question which of the two makes more sense?

This is no ordinary Atheism vs. Theism debate, rather it is the opportunity for you to understand the intellectual foundations of Islam and Atheism and explore for yourself, which is more rational. 
Islam vs Atheism
Is it really true, as some commentators claim, that Islam is archaic, irrational and incoherent or is Atheism just an emotional reaction to religious bigotry and hatred?

Joining us to discuss and debate this very important question is one of the world's leading Atheists and academics Professor Lawrence Krauss and international lecturer and researcher on Islamic thought Hamza Andreas Tzortzis.
