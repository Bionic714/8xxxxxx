,Violentos,2013-03-30T17:00Z,"@Alexowolff - If you can't figure out how to use Google search to find an answer to your question, I highly doubt that you have the mental requirements needed to rip, convert and post a file."

,stinki,2013-03-31T15:08Z,"awesome, but unfortunately these are missing crucial subtitles.. within the first ten minutes of the first episode there is an important conversation in dothraki, which is supposed to be subtitled...will have to grab them from another torrent.."
,stinki,2013-03-31T15:13Z,"some exceptionally well done english subs (full subitling or just the Dothraki!) are in here http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8099420/Game.of.Thrones.S02.Season.2.COMPLETE.720p.BluRay.x264.MIKY

,CarolR,2013-04-01T01:02Z,That website that idiot posted for season 3 ep 1 is one of those damn fill out all these ads first and then we'll email you the link type shit sites. I hope someone bans this assfuck for posting that site.
,jalucian,2013-04-12T08:54Z,"Whats up with not listing video and audio bitrates in the description field, or at least in an .nfo file?"
,MegasChara,2013-04-25T19:39Z,"According to the comments here, this is a legitimate torrent. However, my uTorrent client (3.3 build 29342) has completed its download and hashed successfully only to have all the files apparently be corrupted. How is this possible? Have attackers found a way to generate random garbage that hashes the same as real blocks?"
,faisal72,2013-05-04T08:40Z,"Fully Sync Subtitles with Dothrakhi parts.

,pearl15,2013-05-24T18:50Z,Can anyone care to post the full media info of any of the file?
