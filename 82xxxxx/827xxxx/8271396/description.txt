AZW3, EPUB, MOBI

The vote in the House of Lords as to who should inherit the Barrington family fortune has ended in a tie. The Lord ChancellorΓÇÖs deciding vote will cast a long shadow on the lives of Harry Clifton and Giles Barrington. Harry returns to America to promote his latest novel, while his beloved Emma goes in search of the little girl who was found abandoned in her fatherΓÇÖs office on the night he was killed. When the General Election is called, Giles Barrington has to defend his seat in the House of Commons and is horrified to discover who the Conservatives select to stand against him.
But it is Sebastian Clifton, Harry and EmmaΓÇÖs son, who ultimately influences his uncleΓÇÖs fate. In 1957, Sebastian wins a scholarship to Cambridge, and a new generation of the Clifton family march onto the page. After Sebastian is expelled from school, he unwittingly becomes caught up in an international art fraud involving a Rodin statue that is worth far more than the sum it raises at auction.

Does he become a millionaire? Does he go to Cambridge? Is his life in danger?

Best Kept Secret will answer all these questions, but once again, pose so many more.
