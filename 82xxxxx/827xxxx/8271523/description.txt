Hello Pirate Bay!

This is PowerUp to Maximum, well.. I'm the only guy there, so feel free to call me Matt instead.

So hopefully the torrent works and everything, feel free to comment and let me know if you're having troubles with it or anything.

I spent a year of my spare time after work hours working on this videogame, but I know not everyone can afford games.  I know a lot of people in person who can't afford games, and I know that piracy is a fact of life especially for Android.

I'm just one guy, doing what I love.  So hopefully by doing this I'll bring joy to someone who needs it, somewhere.
Please consider supporting my future games by buying it from the Android Google Play store (or iOS iTunes store even) for $1.99USD

I love making games and I'd like to continue making them.  Please consider helping me out.  I'm only getting started.


~Matt (PowerUp to Maximum)
