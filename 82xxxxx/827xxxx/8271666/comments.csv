,DemonLlama,2013-03-19T20:52Z,"Thank you for this!  I always wait a couple days after the episode airs just so I can get this 1080p version.  I very much appreciate your effort Dibya.

But, I was curious why it's in 2.0, instead of 5.1 for audio?  I'm ok with the 2.0, but I'd really prefer a 1080p+5.1 version.

Thanks again for your efforts!  :)"

,kiwij,2013-03-24T05:24Z,If you want 5.1 you have to get the 720p hdtv release.  I guess the problem is that itunes doesn't release a 5.1 version.
,fluffus,2013-03-25T04:47Z,"@Heterophobe  you posted a 5.1 version that supposedly ""sucks"" so I wouldn't through stones."
