,DangerHeart,2013-04-04T19:14Z,Has anyone gotten this working? Is there an English patch for it?
,maizotome,2013-05-13T20:24Z,"u need to use custom firmware, works flawless on 6.60 PRO-C2 [made by Hrimfaxi (Virtuous Flame, outmatch), neur0n (diautilio), 
Coldbird (gentleman.trilby), 
tpu, devnoname120]
there are rumors about english patch with 60% translate(menu/skills etc) but direct download of patched version gives a pure JPN iso, while torrent have 0 seeders(i mean english version patched torrent).

Graphics in this game is VERY beautiful, gameplay is nice, good RPG that u can compare with Phantasy Star Portable 1/2 and Tales of The World: Radiant Myphology 1/2/3."
