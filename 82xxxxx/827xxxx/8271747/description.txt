Made in Europe is a live album released by Deep Purple, recorded on the final dates in April 1975 before Ritchie Blackmore left Deep Purple. It was released in October 1976, after the group had broken up.

Made in Europe features songs recorded in concert 4 April in Graz, Austria, 5 April in Saarbrücken, Germany, and 7 April 1975 in Paris, France with the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio. According to the liner notes included on Mk III: The Final Concerts, though, the material featured on Made in Europe came, for the most part, from the Saarbrücken show. Additionally, this performance is said to have experienced extensive studio editing and/or overdubbing of crowd noise and applause. Certainly there is a tape-loop of applause, given away by a whistling fan.
