All the songs are in alphabetical order within the folders and not the order on the album.  Forgive the complaint but DSOTM just aint the same opening up with Any Color You Like???"

I Haven't been around a lot lately, so just saw your comment.

All the track information is there, track number, album information, etc.. It's just the filenames that aren't labeled with numbers, and I didn't do that 1 thing because it didn't really seem necessary...and I'm a bit lazy.

Anyway, every single bit of proper information is in each track, just not the filename itself."

Unless i'm missing something i don't understand how i would satisfy my quarterly urge for Dark Side in it's entirety.  The tracks in the folder are alphabetical and if loaded into vlc for example will play in that order and not as per the original album??

And by the way ..the concept of lazy cannot be attributed to anyone doing a mostly thankless job for no pay....all is sincerely appreciated."

Well I've always used Foobar2000 for most of my music. I label and convert everything from FLAC to MP3 there, and the track title always comes out as the file name for each song, so it's just a bit of extra work to add proper numbering in the file names and didn't really seem too necessary to me.

Either way, hope you've enjoyed this discography."
