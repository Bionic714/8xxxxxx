Yeah I know, there's already so many of these around, but I've thrown in a lot of extras in this discography of Pink Floyd. 

First off, all the studio albums are from the Discovery Box Set. Second, I've also included all 3 Immersion Box Sets (albeit without the DVDs). Third, all the "official" live albums are included here, including the 2 numbers from the "Tonite Let's All Make Love In London" album. Fourth, I've thrown in a number of Bootlegs, including "The Complete BBC Recordings (1967-1971)", "The Complete Rainbow Recordings", "Amsterdam '69", "The Syd Barrett Tapes", and many more. Lastly, included here are 2 high quality Vinyl Rips of the albums "Meddle" and "Dark Side Of The Moon", both in FLAC mind you since it would be stupid to convert them into MP3.
