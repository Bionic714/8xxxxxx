@Mr_Heisenberg and anoXmous:

Please reply me back; I have some questions to ask you.

1) The.Terminator.1984.Remastered.1080p is a 2012 MGM copy or 2006 Sony copy.

2) Terminator.2.Judgment.Day.1991.DC.1080p.BluRay is a new end copy of Skynet.Edition or only Director cut.

3) Terminator.3.Rise.of.the.Machines.2003.1080p.BluRay is a theatrical version.

4) Terminator Salvation (2009) 1080p is a (R-rated) Director's cut.

Thank You Sir."
,Mr_Heisenberg,2013-03-28T20:29Z,"@anoXmousy - That sucks man, hopefully it isn't anything serious!?  Thanks for uploading though, much appreciated.


@rajakumar  -  That would be a question for anoXmous or zen bud, usually the best way to find out what version is to look at how long the film is, i believe terminator 2 is the skynet version if i remember right but i could be wrong."
,Mr_Heisenberg,2013-03-28T20:31Z,anoXmous* lol
,rajakumar,2013-03-28T23:01Z,"
@Mr_Heisenberg:

Did u watch all quadrilogy (4 movies) of terminator in 5.1 DD. How is the quality of audio and video? There is no screenshots of this torrent to view the image.

In above comment says zen-bud is in hospital. so I don't know to whom to ask about my questions. Any one can answer my questions i.e either anoXmous or Mr_Heisenberg.

thanks"
