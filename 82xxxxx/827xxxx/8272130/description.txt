Some dude at ComicsReview UK says:

Aircel Publishing, founded by prolific all-rounder Barry Blair, began publishing at the start of the black and white comics bubble of 1985-1986 with strong, impressively airbrush-toned monochrome fantasy/adventure titles such as Samurai, Elflord, Adventurers and Dragonring; swiftly becoming one of the movementΓÇÖs major players and most prodigious publishers.

After weathering the worst of the industryΓÇÖs vicissitudes Aircel merged with Malibu/Eternity Comics in 1988 before the entire agglomeration was purchased by Marvel in 1994.

This original iteration of Warlock 5 (a rebooted second volume version came later, written by Blair himself) debuted in 1987 and instantly caught the comic-buying publicΓÇÖs attention, due in large part to its manic narrative style, luscious art and glorious blend of contemporary cultural tropes, fads and icons, happily poaching striking imagery from Cyberpunk, popular movies, rock and punk music scenes and role-playing gaming.

Conceived and crafted by Gordon Derry and Denis Beauvais the series posited a universe of multiple worlds in a splintered reality, each divergent slice shepherded by a supreme mystic being dubbed ΓÇ£warlockΓÇ¥.

Raw, frantic, hyper-violent, explosively imaginative and beautifully compelling, Warlock 5 is a fabulous forgotten treasure from a wild and crazy time, long overdue for a comprehensive review and reappraisal.


This torrent collects the entire 22-issue first volume of Warlock 5. Haven't seen volume 2 (Malibu, 7 issues) or volume 3 (SIRIUS, 4 issues). If you have them, please upload them!

All hail the original talent and scanners! Get it, seed it!
