1976: Maia converted to the cult of RATIONAL CULTURE, abandoned the drugs and red meat, and decided to write the lyrics for the songs about the knowledge contained in the book. RCA rejected the album Tim Maia Racional, Vols. 2 for the newly found spiritual content, but Maia bought the master tape from them and released the albums independently through label Seroma Discos, which would split its profits with the cult. While lead single "Que Beleza (Imunização Racional)" had some airplay, at the time these records were not well received, due to inadequate distribution, and the spiritual content alienating both the radios and Maia's fans.

The Racional album are now regarded as classics and saw re-release in 2010.
