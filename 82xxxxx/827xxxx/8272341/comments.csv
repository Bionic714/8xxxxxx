,ust2,2013-03-25T07:11Z,"@afrid
Sinbad is terrible just so you know, they should reverse the words and call it badsin since it's hell to watch. It should be available on Space's website though if you aren't in an ip blocked country."
,lovecat66,2013-03-25T09:12Z,"THX for ALL these great uploads eztv ! But where the Hell is Vikings S01E05 ? It should have been aired today, MAR25,2013 3.00am ?! "

,Big69Dawg,2013-03-26T00:55Z,No one has EP 5?
,gjones88,2013-03-26T06:43Z,I love you Ragnalstan!
,Hoirc88,2013-03-27T03:15Z,"For those of you that are confused, episode 5 is NOT out yet. These episodes are up to date, they are just being uploaded on here way before they air on actual TV. Episode 4 is up to date aired on TV 3/23 (way after this was uploaded). These are ""pre-air"" episodes, not really any difference."
,lovecat66,2013-03-27T18:47Z,"Hoirc88 : if these episodes are pre - uploaded, then obviously this positive time lapse is continous. So by now S01E05 should have been uploaded ! "
,sinjanju2,2013-03-27T23:06Z,"5 days ahed it meens preair is tomorow i hope. Cant waith for the rest!, gonna break and enter the stUdio and steel the rest Noow.
 JUST TELL ME WERE THEY ARE, I AM A PROFFESIONAL BURGLER"
,Hoirc88,2013-03-27T23:07Z,"No one ever said all of the episodes would be pre-aired ;)

You can check with the official History channel website for air times, it's all up to date."
,sinjanju2,2013-04-01T00:22Z,ok today sunday it was Vikings S01E05 but no one has recordit and uploadit it yet :) perhaps tomorow ?

,LeonDawson11,2013-04-20T02:57Z,"So how's the quality, people?"
,KadrianBlackwolf,2013-04-25T05:43Z,"I go to the link for the subtitles, but the page doesn't have a button to display/download the file.  Can someone check this please?"
,KadrianBlackwolf,2013-04-25T05:51Z,Are English subtitles available?  The link given earlier in the comments doesn't work.  The page has no download arrow.  Thanks!
