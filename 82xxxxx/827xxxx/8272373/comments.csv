Since i bought the GoG-version back then, just realizing that it isn't the one that runs under Vista/7.

The game was later released unter the label „Green Pepper“ with further fixes, the version which was released under the label „Purple Hills“ is the only one which runs natively under Vista/7 since the copy protection was removed (which prevent running under Vista/7).

So, it isn't the „Purple Hills“ version?
If it's the real GoG one, it isn't so it won't run under anything later than XP.
