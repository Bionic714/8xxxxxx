Synopsis:
---------
TV series (2011-Present). The story of A Song of Ice and Fire is set in a medieval fantasy world. There are three storylines in the series: the chronicle of dynastic civil war for control of Westeros between several noble families, the growing threat of the Others, barely contained by a huge wall of ice that protects the North West, and the trip of Daenerys Targaryen, the exiled daughter of the king who was murdered in another civil war fifteen years ago, who seeks to return to Westeros to claim their rights.
The third season premiere on March 31, 2013 in USA.
