Overview:

Port Royale 2 takes you back to the beginning of the 17th century, when the great colonial powers were competing for control of the Caribbean and when towns could rapidly expand (and collapse again) over a short period of time.

Take on the role of a young adventurer and, with bravery and skill, establish a large trading enterprise of great economic strength and military power. Trade goods between towns, set up production facilities, create cartels, accept all kinds of tasks and missions (merchants, diplomats and other), and set off on voyages to capture enemy ships and loot towns.

As pirates and military fleets threaten your trade convoys you may need to escort ships for your convoys, or you can turn the tides and hunt for pirates or capture the military ships, becoming more famous and expanding your own fleet as well as your stock of goods.
