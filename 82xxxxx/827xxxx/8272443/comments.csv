,hekler80,2013-03-25T01:05Z,"Feel sorry for you lot that think how this is a good British movie. My 12 year old cousin could have written a better dialogue and he has the downs...
 Directing is good, camera work..But thats about it.This guy couldn't act if his life depended on it..same goes for the rest.... Saïd Taghmaoui has some body of work behind him, but he was there obviously only for the paycheck coz he slurred his lines like he wanted to catch as little camera time as possible with these losers. You really have to have your IQ in the double digits if you think that this is a good movie..either that or you're quite young...  "
,hekler80,2013-03-25T01:32Z,"I forgot to rate it:
A: Shit + needs captions for the shit Engrish they speak.
V: Good enough for you to watch deadpan mugs of the ""actors"" as they try to display emotion and completely fail.

M: It's a shallow story involving 2 dimensional characters. So fucking sad, lol.  "
,namvc1,2013-03-25T07:08Z,"This movie wont mean much to a lot of people. It's a quite realistic look into the life of inner city London and the pressures that some kids face in their day to day lives. 
Considering the actors and the director are unknown it's a great debut for many. If your from overseas or even anywhere North of the M25 you will find it hard to understand the English here. What non UK residents often don't realise is we don't all speak the Queen's English. ....this is how a lot of the youth in London talk like for good or bad. 
It's street life ... this aint Hollywood ... It's LONDON ... Good movie hitting on some real and tough subject matter. "
,hekler80,2013-03-25T12:49Z,Just making excuses... Make a documentary if u can't write a script and have no access to serious actors!
,futai,2013-03-26T19:23Z,thx scene4all . thx again!
,vonwisdom,2013-03-27T01:38Z,"England for the English ,all these subhumans should be booted out."
,igniteyourass,2013-03-27T18:27Z,and ofc the tv ratings glorify this movie cus it has muslim criminals in it and wants this to be propaganda. -__- the jews are at it again
,thorrus,2013-03-27T23:38Z,"@vonwisdom
the only subhumans around are nazi scum like yourself ☺"

,namvc1,2013-03-30T06:14Z,there certainly are some dumb people that use this website. 
,henrywatts333,2013-03-30T16:47Z,"great upload scene!

Movie title does not fit movie, makes story misleading."
,BBQSource,2013-03-31T06:11Z,"@heckler87
Oh that's right your opinion is about as valid as what I flush down my toilet... Thanks for the review though, maybe someday someone on the internet will care what you say.

As was said earlier, for a debut film (director, actors etc) it was pretty damn good. Certainly better than some of the shit around at the moment.

The only racists in this world are the black monkeys from africa and asia, and also jews in israel, when a european says the correct thing to get lost from our white and CHRISTIAN EUROPE u talk bout nazis, u not belong here , why u shamed to sayt u are a black or asian or muslim, europe need a GOLDEN DAWN like in Greece, soon...."
,srkaren,2013-05-28T01:22Z,Dear MAJESTIC + scen4all  thank you so much for your generous giving of time and talents.  I so so appreciate you.  God bless you.
