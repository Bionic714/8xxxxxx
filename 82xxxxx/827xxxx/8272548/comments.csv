[V],thenoobish,2013-03-18T22:15Z,Thanks man. I was going to upload the unrared version but this game has over 6000 files in it so thepiratebay didn't let me upload it. This is the real game.
,Noseman123,2013-03-18T22:29Z,Any word on the PC version? I'm not really used to FPS games on console.
,rickydenim,2013-03-18T22:34Z,360 version coming soon?
,cc178700,2013-03-18T22:40Z,"Thanks for this!  I think more people are waiting for the 360 version though, hope it shows up soon.  Thanks again!"
,pin960,2013-03-18T22:40Z,"any idea when the xbox360 version will be uploaded? ps3 has got 2 games this week that come out next week, i tell ya ! ive never seen stuff upload for ps3 first before xbox 360"
,oudi1988,2013-03-18T23:02Z,you are the man 
,Cyph3r19,2013-03-19T00:26Z,"Also Mr.Stifmeister, keep a lookout for a 3.55 patch for us please :).

Really appreciate the share, recommend everyone who can to support these guys and buy it after ""trying"" it out :P."
,samengo,2013-03-19T00:53Z,Stifmeister my lord!Please release the XBOX360 version!
,Sonic_32,2013-03-19T02:14Z,I dont get it? is this the full game? doesn't it get released on March 26th?
,Sonic_32,2013-03-19T02:16Z,"I don't get it, is this the full game? doesn't it get released Mar 26th?"
[V],-wxm-,2013-03-19T02:57Z,"I thought scene groups always releases the Xbox360 version of the game first :/ 

Well either way, I be waiting for that, I CANNOT WAIT to play this game!"
,plagasx,2013-03-19T05:25Z,How do you play this? I thought PS3 can't be modded?
,cc178700,2013-03-19T12:51Z,"@ plgasx:  Google is your friend.  I wouldn't say things like that without at least doing the bare minimum research.  

Also, let's GO with the 360 release!  Why the HELL is PS3 getting this first??"
,MrRigo,2013-03-19T14:48Z,"I'm new to all this, so I ask:

Is it reasonable to expect a PC version to be uploaded before the actual 26th release? Cracked and all obviously."
,bropaps,2013-03-19T16:36Z,Hi guys i heard this game would have a 3d option.  Anybody who's downloaded the game please confirm.  thanks
,Xanage24,2013-03-20T00:55Z,"Dude come on, where is the 360 version? Your killing me..."
,pin960,2013-03-20T01:31Z,i cant believe the 360 version isn't out yet! and the PS3 version is!! if the PS3 version is out i know the 360 version is floating in the wings somewhere!!! please!!! release it!!!
,DoodleBop,2013-03-20T03:43Z,"MrRigo > Dream on, if the Clone DVD version is uploaded before 26th that's a miracle.

Then wait an additional week for the crack, thats how it's been going on recently. If you wanna play PC version, be patient."
,zashbot,2013-03-20T08:46Z,works perfectly on rogero 2.05 w/ multiman 4.13
,linkjoy12,2013-03-20T16:05Z,"What is going on with the PC releases.  Are the ADMINS of all the Torrent sites  (who run off of a secret torrent site).  And all the scenes who take care of the cracks and releases have a vendetta against PC releases now or something?  What is going on.  I remember when the scene released PC games a WEEK or TWO ahead of time. 

seriously i would love to know what is going on.

It seeems like this is what is happening.  I have been around the scene since I was very young, what is going on.  Is there an internal war with all the hackers?  How much we can keep a PC release underwraps?  That is EXACTLY what it seems is happening."
,linkjoy12,2013-03-20T16:10Z,Why is my post gone wtf
,weedginjo,2013-03-20T16:15Z,cant someone remove the languages and leave english only. it may affect the size
,pin960,2013-03-20T16:50Z,Please! Release the xbox360 version! Please!
,redbullzvodkouu,2013-03-20T17:20Z,yeah what's with the xbox version? can anyone answer?
,nox234558,2013-03-20T19:43Z,pls guys im begging for some gameplay so i can see how is the game i dont have cfw on my ps3 :/ 
,x3angel,2013-03-21T04:18Z,"Thank you @Mr.Stifmeister 

Transferred game directly to ext. HDD via USB - No FTP - Duplex Intro - the Game works perfectly with Rogero CFW 4.30 v2.05 with Disc 

@bropaps I have a 3D TV & I'm sorry to tell you that this is **** NOT a 3D game ****"
,samengo,2013-03-21T10:14Z,STFU weed!Not everybody´s native language is english you ignorant fuck!
,vent22,2013-03-21T16:53Z,"For some reason, I just saw PC torrents for this on other websites. Its contents has a 5gig iso, nfo, and a read me.txt i think. and alot of them dont have any seeders. Its called Bioshock Infinite Reloaded i assumed. it weird how its been taken down on this site.... It seems legit due to its iso file in it."
,Ironb0und,2013-03-21T17:00Z,When will it release for PC?
,linkjoy12,2013-03-21T17:02Z,i guess the scene has given up on releasing PC games ahead of time.
,LowFatPat,2013-03-21T18:39Z,"All those other PC torrents of this game are fake.
They have a fucking survey in them.
It pisses me off because I get really excited about them, and then BOOM. 

Survey.

Can someone answer about when this is being released on the Xbox?!"
,vent22,2013-03-21T19:37Z,"@lowfat

Well i just found a bioshock iso that is not a rar passworded and its in a reg folder..."
,vent22,2013-03-21T19:40Z,"nevermind, the pc torrent is a fake..."
,pin960,2013-03-21T21:23Z,Any word on the xbox360 version yet?
,linkjoy12,2013-03-22T00:42Z,don't hold your breath
,samengo,2013-03-22T10:36Z,"I´ve lost any hope,that the XBOX360 version will be released anyway."
,pin960,2013-03-22T11:29Z,"from what ive read on a couple forums, it should be tonight that we all get it.."
,linkjoy12,2013-03-22T12:11Z,"whatevs i have lost faith in the scene lately.  Seems it's kind of dying.  I remember releases came out sometimes 3 weeks before, including PC games."
,Xanage24,2013-03-22T13:03Z,"I've been driving myself crazy awaiting the 360 version for the last two weeks. Why is it that one of the most popular games of the year has not leaked for 360 by now? I guess this game is heavily guarded. With that said, I really do hope that when it does leak its worthy enough to purchase."
,pin960,2013-03-22T14:51Z,It will be!!
,codeboxxy,2013-03-22T15:29Z,Are you sure pin960? don't want to be rude but can i get a source?
,majuaraan,2013-03-22T18:14Z,"I bought the move gun just to play this, so worth it "
,PaulNo2,2013-03-22T18:18Z,"Thx for the hopes, pin960. I found myself coming here time after time for the last 3 or 4 days and sometimes just plain sitting here and refreshing the page, waiting for the 360 version to appear. I hope tonight I can quit this foolish routine."
,jakedilla,2013-03-22T19:35Z,"some of you guys really need to settle down lol... I can't wait for the game either but let's try to be thankful that we're getting it at all let alone before it's released and remember... FOR FREE!

Play the first two games while you wait like I've been doing =)"
,linkjoy12,2013-03-22T21:09Z,"well gamestop stores have there shipment of the 360 version so it's beyond me why it hasn't been uploaded.  and the preloading already started on steam.  So hopefully we will see something this weekend.

The scene is not what it used to be tell you that."
,jakedilla,2013-03-23T00:36Z,first world problems...
,honeybear95,2013-03-23T02:39Z,Can someone tell me how to burn this to a disc so it works after download
,Xanage24,2013-03-23T03:55Z,@honeybear26 Assuming this actually turns up. You need to have a compatible ihas drive along with the modified firmware called burnermax. This allows for a proper burn of an xgd3 title without random disk error issues while playing. Run the game iso through a program called abgx360 and finally burn the game with Imgburn. It is recommended to use verbatim dl for burning. Hope this helps.
,Xanage24,2013-03-23T04:01Z,"@honeybear shit my bad, im so hyped for the 360 version that i did not realize your asking directions for ps3. But ya idk, google it..."
,prokillerx321,2013-03-23T11:15Z,Hello can anyone teach me how to jailbreak my ps3 and play these [DUPLEX] games...=)

,Daestoga,2013-03-24T17:05Z,How the heck do the fake PC downloads get deleted so fast?
,nimrod808,2013-03-28T09:21Z,if i play this without playing the previous versions will i be lost like the metal gear solid franchise?
,nimrod808,2013-03-29T07:00Z,thanks stifmeister. works with oppoiso patch on 3.55 on external.
,WonkasWilly,2013-03-30T23:07Z,"@linkjoy12
uhh because PS3 > xbox duh

everyone knows that"
,doc_roach,2013-03-31T01:58Z,"Everything was going fine thru the beginning of the game until I get the Diablo and have to leave the first part of town through the two blue doors -- at that point, I get a Disc Read error ""the disc is dirty or damaged."" I've removed the DLC yet still get the issue. Has anyone else had this problem?

 Upon trying to recopy it to my external HDD, I get an error saying that a directory is corrupted. Not sure if it was an MD5/download error or not.

Any help is appreciated.

,souly420,2013-04-05T06:36Z,"YOU ARE COMSTOCK, ELIZABETH IS YOUR DAUGHTER.

Enjoy the game :) 

I pirate lots of games, however this game deserves your money for the hard ass work they put into it to. You do nothing but punish one of the very few game studios left out there who gives a fuck about quality over $$

Eat shit and die assholes"
,phoeniks314,2013-04-12T20:00Z,"@souly420

Eat shit and die you asshole, i finished the game but why the fuck you have to spoil it for others, is your little dick now a bit bigger? NO because your an fucking prick"

,THRobinson,2013-04-28T19:00Z,"What do you guys use for jailbreaking? I posted in the forum with no response. I have a PS3 that's 2yrs old, barely ever touch it (not much of a gamer) but figured I'd try some downloads, just looking for a good link to a site for jailbreaking... one that doesn't require me to fill in surveys for passwords and crap like that though. :)"
