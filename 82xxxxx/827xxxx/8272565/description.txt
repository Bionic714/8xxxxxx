Every move you make tells a secret...
This important book adds a new dimension to
human understanding.
Julius Fast teaches you how to penetrate the
personal secrets of strangers, friends and lovers
by interpreting their body movements, and how
to make use of your powers.
Why do you move the way you do?
Does your body betray your thoughts?
Can you enjoy love-making to its fullest?
Are you a 'closed' or 'open' family?
What are homosexual signals?
What body language does a girl use to say 'I'm
available. I can be had'?
A game that can be surprising, frightening,
adventurous or revealing ΓÇö but never dull.
'Provocative ... perhaps the most eloquent body
language of all is the silent language of love.'
