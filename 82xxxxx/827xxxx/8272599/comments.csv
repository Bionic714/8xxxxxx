,r34gtrgodzilla,2013-03-21T04:41Z,"Got the freezing lag, low FPS thing sorted, you just need to disable your SLI in Nvidia Control Panel, it's no use setting the game to force single card, you have to totally disable the setting through the CP.  Hope this helps a few people.  Thanks for the Torrent, much appreciated.  Pitty it's just a c lone from the console with no Graphical improvement."
,sucosa,2013-03-21T14:16Z,"@Kambei55 I have the same problem. I start to play the first stage and when i reach the second checkpoint, the game stops and the Uplay game report appears. 

I installed it in another PC and it works... so I assume is something with my hardware... I´ve a i7 920, gtx 275, 10Gb of RAM and Windows 8... The thing is that the PC that works (really slow) is an AMD A6 4500K APU with 4Gb of RAM and also Windows 8. 

If someone has any idea why is this possible I will appreciate it. Thanks!"

(Note that this will not happen with everyone, but there is a chance that it will).  I would stick to the current version until a fix is released on the scene."

Success

i had to google my way to delet this (because it was a rootkit) and i got this solution 
http://support.kaspersky.com/sp/faq/?qid=208280758

could you please illuminate me and tell me why there is a malware that is flagged as rootkit, that adds my pc to a botnet?

(also before i detected this malware y played the game, no problems, only a minor performance issues with the smoothness of the camara)

Between the performance issues and the Virut.CE, this game only lasted 1 day on my pc"
,deaderweterdog,2013-03-26T20:58Z,apreciate the upload but instead of several paragraphs about how great the game is and how like the others and all the awards and skills how bout just 1 sentance about what kind of game what type of gameplay i see something about bike customization and other than that nothing to tell me the type of game

,hondac3,2013-04-11T00:17Z,"Okay...where to start?

First of all, the install notes are your best friend.  It literally tells you exactly what to do.  If you read it...everything USUALLY works out.

However, that was not the case this time.  I did everything exactly as the install notes directed, yet when I try to play the game, not only did I have to change compatibility mode to Windows XP (I'm running Windows 7) but I had to actually lower the graphics to get above 20 FPS.  To put this into perspective, I ran Crysis on this same laptop on high settings at 60 FPS.  But that's not even the worst part.  I can deal with 20 FPS, that's not that bad.  What I can't deal with, is when you lower the graphics, the textures get COMPLETELY FUCKED UP.  It gives you a total of eight options to lower, none of them dealing with textures, if I recall correctly.  Anyways, it's still playable, but only if you're a desperate fanboy.  Uninstalled this piece after only 11 minutes of screwing around with the options and then giving up."

,8element,2013-05-04T19:33Z,Whats up with the shitty FPS? I can run Batman Arkham City at 35 FPS.
,tanishgu,2013-05-05T15:16Z,"Hey guys. 
So I followed the notes to the point, blocking out the game in my firewall. 
The thing is that I already had Uplay installed since I bought some original games from Ubisoft.
I clicked the Trials FMX, and the game popped it in my Uplay account.
The problem is that it's asking for a CD - Key.
Help? "
,tanishgu,2013-05-05T15:26Z,"Fixed the problem.
For all those getting the CD - Key thing, here's what to do:
Find the TrialsFMX file
Right click and go to properties
Go on compatibility
Select to run it on Vista service pack 2
Apply and Ok
Now double click the TrialsFMX file, and it should work :) "
,DuckManX,2013-05-10T22:01Z,Multiplayer works or not? Everyone says different shit and it makes me fucking mad.
,hell911,2013-06-06T05:57Z,"works perfectly.

for those who are getting error after clicking the ""Play"" button in uPlay..

just run the .exe file in windows vista mode, or other mode."
