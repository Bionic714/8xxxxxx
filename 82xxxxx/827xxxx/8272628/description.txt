Zentimo xStorage Manager is a program that facilitates the work with several USB devices, since it is able to rename the units, show the ability, or clearance properties of each one of them, launch portable applications or test read and write data.

The program, which has a modern and simple interface, is divided into four main sections:

Menu control: In this section we give each one of the devices the name you want and also visualize possible changes to the hardware.
Menu management letters: With this function we can assign a fixed point to each of the units we connect to our team.
Application Manager: With this option you can configure applications to run to connect a PC specifically to our program or launch those that are stored on a flash drive.
Benchmark: Utility to check the read and write speed of a drive.

If you frequently use various USB devices and want to manage them properly, you should consider the option to start using Zentimo xStorage Manager.
