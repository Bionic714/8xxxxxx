Norton security suite from Xfinity install and it will activate it's self.

No More key's or activation needed ever again.

Make sure u select not to report any anonymously data back to them after installing just to be on the safe side. but I've used this countless times and no problems activating the software nor has it let me down for antivirus or internet security.

It's been about a month or so since I've personally needed to install it. So comment asap if any one has a problem.
