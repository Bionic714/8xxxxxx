The city of Arcadia is the dark side of the American Dream. It's the land of opportunity, if you've got the money to buy it or the muscle to take it. The police are the best trained and equipped in the country, if you can afford their protection. Crime is under control, because crime is in control. For the corrupt and the ruthless, Arcadia is paradise on Earth. But a cold storm is blowing through the streets of Arcadia, a plague wind in black leather and torn cloth, a one-eyed, one-man judge, jury, and executioner whom the papers call "The X-Killer." He has set the new rules for Arcadia. Cross the line once, you'll receive a warning. Cross them twice, and X will mark the spot . . . where they'll find your body.

X Omnibus Volume 1 collects for the first time the audacious, critically acclaimed Dark Horse series that made "grim and gritty" superheroes seem like cuddly plush toys. Violent and morally ambiguous, X walks the thin line between heroism and obsession and shows that sometimes the cure may be worse than the disease. X Omnibus Volume 1 features over three hundred story pages by creators including Steven Grant, Doug Mahnke, Chris Warner, Jimmy Palmiotti, and Tim Bradstreet.

Collects X #1-11; X: One Shot to the Head (originally in Dark Horse Comics #8-10); "Welcome to the Jungle" from Dark Horse Comics #19, 20; X: Hero Illustrated Special #1, 2.

X Omnibus Volume 2 collects for the first time the audacious, critically-acclaimed Dark Horse series. Violent and morally ambiguous, X walks the thin line between mission and madness and shows that the devil you know may be better, much better, than the devil you don't.

Collects X #12-25; "Someone to Watch Over Me" from Dark Horse Extra #28-31, all never before collected.
