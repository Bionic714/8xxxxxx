This is an ISO of Microsoft Windows Server 2008 Foundation x64.

This is not the newer Foundation R2 release, but the older one based off of vista kernel.

I am uploading it as it is no longer available to purchase from dell, and it took me over 10 hours just to find the disc for a supplier without licenses.

This is a dell oem copy so when you install it on your dell server, it is already activated.

Note this does not included the serial number it is the disc ISO only.

ISO was made from Daemon tools free.
