A complete playthrough of Dead or Alive 5, captured in 720p60 using virtualdub+lagarith lossless codec+avermedia H727 capture card.

Is has been captured via HDMI (taking advantage of the avermedia software bug that makes it possible to capture encrypted hdmi signals). 

The game has been played without any previous save file or anything, so you will be able to see how some of the story missions are meant to be done. The captures has then been encoded with very high x264 settings to retain as much quality as possible.

This torrent is perfect if you want to re-watch the story, or parts of it, in maximum quality or perhaps if you need some advice on the story missions.

Enjoy!
