Chronological X-Men Pack 28 (missing from previous)

This is the first of five Chronological X-Men Packs that I hope to release over the next month.  This is kind of a filler pack to catch up on what I found to be missing from previous Chronological X-Men Packs, and ironically enough it is only chronological by year, unlike Packs 29-32 to follow.  Possibly I downloaded the packs I have from Demonoid, but my numbering is different  from the pack I see on h33t.  The previous packs that I had, ended with number 27, and brought the story up to around the beginning of Regenesis, hence my starting with 28.  In Pack 29 to follow shortly I will reprise those few issues of Regenesis and take them out to their full storyline, and continue with packs that bring us up to the present.  

My ground rules for inclusion are pretty broad.  IΓÇÖm trying to follow all of the mutants that we know and love where ever they appear.  So for instance if Wolverine, Storm, or the Beast are in an Avengers title, I include it, but if no mutants are included in a storyline at all I probably exclude it.  I consider Deadpool to be part of the mutant family, so youΓÇÖll see his stuff here also.  This pack deals with allot that could be considered (or is) non-continuity.  IΓÇÖm not sure why these stories might have been skipped over by previous posters, but as far as I am concerned more mutant stories are better than less.

These are not my scans.  IΓÇÖve been in awe of the folks that turn out such amazing scans and youΓÇÖll find most scans are tagged by their makers.   Let us hope that the sharing continues.

These issues are from the Marvel Universe with various authors and illustrators.
