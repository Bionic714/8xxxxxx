,hallux3,2013-03-23T01:44Z,"Answer to Sakstroy: 
Just becouse you read a book you have to believe it? How about giving it a try? MAYBE there is something in there for you, but do not tell this is for people who believe ANYTHING... That just tells us that YOU usually believe the books you read, and can not read a book on an occult topic out of pure curiousness... You seem 100% totally close-minded and I feel a little sorry for you... Am I spot on if I claime your book is the Bible and you are a Christian? 
I fpund most religious people have a very hard time see things from another persons point of view... Which is so sad..

Keep an open mind. If your brain is so weak it translates every written word to the TRUTH, then I am just so totally ashamed of you, and people like you.. (most, not all, but most of those who resonates like you are christians, muslims or jewish).. Its such a shame... I see more humanity and compassion in atheits and even semi-satanists... And it is no ones fault but yourselves and your institutions... 

(feel free to email me for critizism or a discussion, I would appreciate it)"

I clarify: I am an atheist so no religious prejudice for me, many years ago I read many 'occult' books out of curiosity, they are all nonsense, based on some people's imagination distorting or falsifying reality and scientific or historical knowledge, they are very successful with ignorant people who know no better or people thus inclined (masons, theosophists, etc.) who prefer free imagination to serious academic research and knowledge. That is, an entertainment for brainless or gullible people who will believe literally ANYTHING... Actually, religious people (any religion) are the best candidates to fall for this kind of nonsense.
