This video is for us who just love to have company of good friends and icecold Bavarian beer
Beer is the reason we get up each afternoon.
Cheers"

PS: Sometimes an icecold Caipirinha or a Desperados with a fresh green lemon slice seems to be an acceptable alternative, too. 

finally some lines out of Janis Joplin's song 'Me and Bobby McGee':
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose 
Nothin', it ain't nothin' honey, if it ain't free 
And feelin' good was easy, Lord, when he sang the blues 
You know feelin' good was good enough for me 
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee"
