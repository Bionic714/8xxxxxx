   RICK DANKO & JANIS JOPLIN - Ain't No More Cane (1970)(jam session on train)



          "Ain't No More Cane" is a traditional prison work song of the American south. The title refers to work assigned to prisoners sentenced to hard labor in Texas - to cut sugar cane along the banks of the Brazos River, where many of the state's prison farms were located in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
It has been recorded by Lead Belly, Odetta, Lonnie Donegan, the Limeliters on their album "14 14K Folksongs" (1963), Son Volt, and by The Band on the album The Basement Tapes. Bob Dylan also performed the song live in the early 1960s and his version is on multiple bootleg recordings taken from The Gaslight Cafe.The song, as "Ain't No More Cane On The Brazos", was also covered by the singer Ian Gillan of Deep Purple fame for his 1990 solo-album Naked Thunder. The Chad Mitchell Trio recorded the song on their 1963 album "Singin' our Mind". Other covers include The Black Crowes. 

        "Ain't No More Cane" is featured in the film "Festival Express", in which Rick Danko, Janis Joplin, Jerry Garcia, Bob Weir, and various other musicians drunkenly sing it on the train going to the next concert on the tour.
