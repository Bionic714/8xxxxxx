,thehoweller,2013-03-21T23:30Z,Hey guys. Wanting to start downloading PS3 games instead of buying. Can anyone point me in the right direction on how to go about jailbreaking a ps3 and being able to use these game torrents? Tried a few youtube videos and none have worked. Cheers
,x3angel,2013-03-22T01:45Z,@thehoeweller what firmware is currently on your ps3? If your @ 4.30 or less - then Google Rogero CFW 4.30 v2.05 - download the pup to a USB key & install over the firmware via usb - then install the latest multiman & that's it...there are over 25 websites dedicated to the ps3 scene I recommend psxscene & ps3hax

,x3angel,2013-03-22T19:24Z,"@thehoweller & others new to the scene Spanish Developer MiralaTijera has released the first 4.40 CFW. Following the recent OFW update from Sony. Rebug is also rumored to be testing their 4.40 CFW as well. This all has been made possible by the LV0 keys being leaked months ago, that new CFW's can arise shortly after a new update from Sony.  I haven't tested this yet ** so be forewarned ** try @ your risk!!!! Download/Source: elotrolado.net (Spanish Forum)"
