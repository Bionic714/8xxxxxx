Compliant with Xbox360/PS3/iPads/Mobile Devices/etc. devices that require the primary Audio stream to be AAC Stereo (many do not accept/work with AAC 5.1 format). Audio Stream 2 available to those that also wish to experience great 5.1 sound that goes right alongside great picture quality.

For those experiencing LOW VOLUME issues, try to playback the 2nd Audio stream in stereo mode, this should improve audio quality and increase the volume substantially.

If you wish to experience 5.1 audio on the original PS3 or Newer PS3, Just select the audio options and ensure the 5.1 stream/track is selected.

PC Users will have to use something like VLC that allows you to choose the 2nd Audio stream/track, Depending on your configuration, vlc should automatically enable 5.1 playback after the track change, but double check by selecting AUDIO ~ Audio Device ~ 5.1

Judas's Note:

There was a number of people REQUESTING a Japanese audio version of this film with the english subtitles. And since i didn't have anything else ready at the time... i figured why not for shits and giggles.

This is better encoded version of the film. HOWEVER KEEP IN MIND that this will not playback on ALL devices due to the dual 5.1 AAC tracks. If you wish to experience Japanese audio instead of english... you must use a player/device that is able to select the 2nd Audio stream/Track. A player such as VLC can do this.


For a 100% Compatible for all devices with only English audio Please visit my previous upload of this exact movie below.
