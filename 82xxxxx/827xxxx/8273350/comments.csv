[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-19T02:55Z,is this another freakin' batch of torrents from an Anonymous poster that aren't being seeded?
,jsnyder0419,2013-03-19T03:57Z,"They should be seeding, as far as I can tell."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-19T12:10Z,"my torrent client shows 200+ people trying to download it; i am stuck at 0.0% and so are all of them. similar complaints on about 10-15 ""Anonymous"" posts the past few days."
,UaskIanswer,2013-03-20T01:21Z,If TPB could tell us anything about a torrent's number of downloads it would be obvious which torrents were fake/broken from the start.  I guess that is something only a private tracker can do?
,dbranson17,2013-03-20T19:30Z,no... this is more of the typical garbage where scum-buckets are successfully downloading either all or part of the post and then skipping out.
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-25T16:54Z,"wrong. this was never seeded. i started downloading it less than 15 minutes after it was posted, never got past 0.0%"
