Joseph Rheinberger (1839-1901) is best known for his (20) organ sonatas.

His other works are almost forgotten, including these gems for Violin and 

Pipe Organ.  



As often is the case, my uploads are not in the database.  I botched the 

titling but pics are included so you'll know what you're listening to.

The Organ does not overwhelm the Violin.....extremely melodic
