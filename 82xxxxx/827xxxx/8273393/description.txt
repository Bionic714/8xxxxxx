"Scared to Death"

When a young woman appears to have 
literally been scared to death three days 
after watching a "haunted" DVD, Castle and 
Beckett delve into one of their creepiest 
cases yet. To make matters worse, Castle 
becomes convinced that he too is marked for 
death when he accidentally watches the 
cursed video.

18/Slower+
Evolve... or die.

Enjoy :)
