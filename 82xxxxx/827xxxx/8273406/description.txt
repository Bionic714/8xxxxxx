Monk is an immensely important figure in 20th century music, not only as a virtuoso jazz pianist, but also one of the most innovative composers of any musical form. Although far from comprehensive, the soundtrack nevertheless achieves a satisfying cross-section of Monk tunes, from the infectious clunkiness of "Pannonica" and "Trinkle, Tinkle" to the painfully beautiful blue tones of the aptly named "Ugly Beauty." Interspersed with narration, as well as unreleased rehearsals and snatches of unguarded conversation gathered during the making of the film, these selections do an admirable job of capturing the complexity of Monk's life and music in fairly limited space. The biographical data provided in the narration, along with the accessible selections, makes the soundtrack an excellent introduction to Monk's larger body of work, while the inclusion of out-takes and audio snapshots of the man himself makes STRAIGHT NO CHASER desirable even to Monk connoisseurs'.
