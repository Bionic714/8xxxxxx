,idrew2013,2013-03-19T04:18Z,"I'm thinking this may not work with windows 8? Anyone else with Windows 8 having an issue? I've tried installing 4 times, including making an actual disk and it keeps getting stuck at installing microsft direct x. If I try and cancel at that part, it won't let me boot."
,ImmaSharkk,2013-03-19T04:42Z,"Just downloaded/installed, but when I start the Uplay emulator and hit play, the game doesn't start and it seems like nothing is happening, but when I check my processes it says ""trialsFMX.exe"" is running. 
Can anybody help here?"

Just install and apply update, don't copy 'datapack' folder. And add all .exe files to firewall.
It works for me that way."
[V],extremezone,2013-03-19T13:34Z,"hell911 on tpb no, you can try to google ""248675E45481C10BBB8C30DFBBBA75AED7E067DC"" and find another public torrent sites profile that have private message function"

,ronthegamer,2013-03-19T16:21Z,"1. Remove the game from your system

2. Reinstall it

3. Update the game using update.exe 

4. Once the update is complete, open Uplay, go to settings and uncheck- allow uplay to use proxy connection..., check- Always start uplay in offline mode. Click close 

5. Copy the contents of SKIDROW folder to the game dir. and replace files when prompted

6. Block both Uplay and TrialsFMX using the firewall in your antivirus program.

7. Go to datapack in the game folder, right click on the TrialsFMX, select properties, go to compatibility, check- run this program as an administrator under the privilege level and create a shortcut for the application to your desktop

8. Play the game...

if this doesn't work, then god help you..."

,scanti101,2013-03-20T07:12Z,"I may have hit a snag. Trying to Uninstall and ReInstall but the Uninstaller encounters an error saying it cant find GameruxInstallerHelper.dll and wont uninstall the game, even though i have deleted the file that was installed in the first place. And when running setup it just opens as the uninstaller. Help?"
,Gome120,2013-03-20T10:32Z,"it says when i press play on the uplay it says i need the activation key', what is it ? "
,ibanz0r,2013-03-20T11:27Z,"So for all the noobs :> having issues wif this game, it is mainly to do with existing installations of uplay, if u already say have Assassins Creed installed or tbpfh, ANYthing that uses uplay, and u then encounter issues, that is why, keep at it, ull get it to work eventually, Say u uninstall Assassins Creed, this will leave uplay intact, so i dunno... maybe go into j0r conrtol panels, and make sure there aint no existing uplay installations goin on, furthermore, uplay can copy settins and config files that dont get removed  during uninstall, that the new install of yoru cracked uplays will prob try to associate / load up, SO... *deep breath* now u kno all this, go forth my noobs and conquor!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,Gome120,2013-03-20T13:19Z,after i removed uplay when i tryed to launch the game it said i need to download uplay launcher in order to play O.o

,Fluid56,2013-03-21T02:32Z,works great. thanks again.
,Fluid56,2013-03-21T02:38Z,"on second thought, i guess not. keeps crashing before the game actually launches. pretty sure it's on my end though, i'm gonna re-install it. the thanks still stands!"
,Fluid56,2013-03-21T04:45Z,"re-installing the game, following the additional instructions provided by ronthegamer, and running the game in Win XP SP3 compat fixed the issues I was having. "

,kardiirn,2013-03-21T10:15Z,"Hello Extremezone, i'm trying to remove sr-trialsege.iso, It say a programs use it , ""system"" , I tryed to unlock it with Lockhunter and it doesn't work... Can you tell me how to uninstall it please?"
,q2323,2013-03-22T00:05Z,"very bad install notes. 
GUY, INSTALLATION IS IN CHINESE, AND EVEN LANGUAGE LIST IS IN CHINESE. FOR ENGLISH, CHOOSE 英語 (THANK YOU EXTREMEZONE FOR MENTIONING THIS, BECAUSE I INSTALLED THE WHOLE GAME IN CHINESE, SO I HAD TO REINSTALL THE GAME LATER)
AND THANKS AEAGEsad FOR VISTA COMPATIBILITY TIP, BECAUSE IT DIDN'T WORK UNTIL I CHECKED THE VISTA COMPATIBILITY MODE.
extremezone, next time post a proper install notes!! thank you."
,JaYo1919,2013-03-22T06:09Z,This works!! Do the set up like ronthegamer said but for me.. I didnt copy the 2 files in the skidrow crack. But I did paste the orbit file into the ubisoft file. and everything works fine. BUTTT it messed up my tom clancy ghost recon game!!! good thing i had the Orbit files for that still... WIN VISTA 64 BIT..

,seaboundrhino813,2013-03-24T08:06Z,are there any leaderboards?
,MhaveNN,2013-03-24T12:59Z,"I installed the game properly in English - not Chinese, done everything in order.
But the game doesn't launch, I press the Play button Uplay but the game doesn't launch, it just stands like that.

"
,MhaveNN,2013-03-24T13:24Z,"Doesn't work, I tried with and without crack. With and without updated. Blocked exes in firewall, still doesn't work. Don't know what's the problem. 

Help?"
,Skorpino,2013-03-25T19:17Z," Launch the game with Uplay in the folder "" orbit "" thanks 
PS: Boring game ..."
,jaggy1963,2013-03-26T01:02Z,"for anyone having the jitters I have solved it for me. I uninstalled the game first time round cause I had terrible lag on it and reinstalled it on another drive in my machine.. not c drive as I had originally done. also this may help some of you. once you install the game before you do anything else go into your delete progams find uplay and delete it. the version of uplay you want is in the orbit folder that comes in the skidrow crack folder. theres also no need to use the exe provided to launch the game so you don't have to change its compatibility mode, I haven't.. all I did was launch the game using the uplay launcher in the orbit folder supplied by skidrow. the file you double click on is just over 16000kb.

it works perfectly now. incidently I also put in patch 1.02"
,comarol,2013-03-26T14:07Z,on every extremezone game theres always fuck wits complaining about it not working. I dont think ive ever had a game not work from ez. Noobs.
,notloc24-7,2013-03-28T04:24Z,"Never had a problem with extreme torrent besides this one. when i hit play on uplay it would say the game is running and not launch. Im prob doing something wrong i guess. but for those of you with same problem try HEROMASTER's torrent. i got it working no prob, and its a siick game"
[H],BlackTar,2013-03-28T12:28Z,"The .msi is in Chinese, setup.exe asks for language.

Got it working for Windows 8."
,AVI17AVI,2013-03-28T19:09Z, you Need to change the compatibility to windos XPsp3 and it works fine! GOODLUCK!
