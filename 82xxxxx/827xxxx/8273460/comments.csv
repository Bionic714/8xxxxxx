I think you guys are among the best there is and your quality is generally unmatched, HOWEVER, on this movie in particular, which has a ton of grain because of the film it was shot on, I can see some subtle quality issues. There are a couple of ways to handle grain in x264. One is to just increase the bitrate from what you normally use, and I see you didn't do that. The other is to give deblock negative values, and you didn't do that either (by you I mean Bokutox, the encoder.) The result is that the grain that we should be seeing sharply is a bit blurred because x264 is adaptive and does some deblocking even when values are set at 0:0 like yours are here. This is a common problem with movies with grain, but I really expected a team as good as you guys to have adjusted either the bitrate or deblock to account for it and was a little disappointed to see you hadn't. It's a shame too, because there aren't many good encodes of this movie out there for this very reason. So far the only really great encode of the theatrical version in a low file size is Jalucian's. Anyway, again, please don't think I'm slamming you guys cos 99% of the time your work is among the best out there. Hopefully if you see this comment you may consider what I had to say about bitrates and deblocking settings for future encodes you do that have grain in the source."
