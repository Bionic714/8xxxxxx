If this album was physical, I would buy it. But I'd rather not pay for a few files."
,benjamin014,2013-03-25T21:14Z,i agree if it was not an itunes download and was physical i would buy but the world of downloading from itunes is taking over so physical cd's hardly sell anymore compared to itunes download
