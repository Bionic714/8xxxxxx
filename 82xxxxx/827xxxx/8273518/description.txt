Information
------------------------------

David Suchet sets out to unravel the mystery surrounding the life and work of Agatha Christie. Since he first played Hercule Poirot on ITV in 1990, the actor has become closely identified with the dapper Belgian detective who first appeared in The Mysterious Affair at Styles, the novel which launched Christie's career as a crime writer in 1920. One of the best-selling novelists of all time, Christie remains popular with millions of fans 37 years after her death. Suchet asks what gave her stories worldwide appeal and why her enduring characters, such as Poirot and Miss Marple, so captured the imagination of her readers.
