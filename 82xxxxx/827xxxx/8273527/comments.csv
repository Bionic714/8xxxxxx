,catapiller,2013-03-19T02:55Z,"Alright.  It looks like this one is up and running as well.  For now Pack 28 http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8273045/Chronological_X-Men_Pack_28_%28missing_from_previous%29 is getting the greater uploading bandwidth.  Hopefully that will level out through the night.  Any one that can help seed over the next week or two will be appreciated.  These are my first uploads.  I know the files are good, but I may need to tweek my client a bit over the next few days.  Enjoy."
,taikokid,2013-03-20T21:56Z,do you have past x-men packs before 28? I collected the revised chronological X-men up to 18. would love to fill in some holes. Much appreciated if you can help or at least point me in the right direction.
