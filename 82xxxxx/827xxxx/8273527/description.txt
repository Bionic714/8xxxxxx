This Chronological X-Men Pack 29 is the true start of my compiled
collections.  IΓÇÖm a big fan of the previous Chrono-packs and 
really enjoy reading runs of comics rather than as they come out 
month by month.  Maybe the demise (?) of Demonoid brought about 
the end of the Chronological Packs I had been following.  Since 
pack 27 came out in 2010  until a few months ago I had resisted 
reading the X-Men and Avengers, at least until AvX wrapped up. 
I then embarked on the task of putting together my own collection 
from where pack 27 left off.  Since I havenΓÇÖt seen anyone else 
put up this material, and I went to all the effort, I figured I 
should share.  I have 3 more packs to follow that should get 
close to the current releases.  After that if there is interest, 
I could put out previous packs.

My ground rules for inclusion are pretty broad.  IΓÇÖm trying to 
follow all of the mutants that we know and love where ever they 
appear.  So for instance if Wolverine, Storm, or the Beast are in 
an Avengers title, I include it, but if no mutants are included 
in a storyline at all I probably exclude it.  I consider Deadpool 
to be part of the mutant family, so youΓÇÖll see his stuff here 
also.  I think the orders here work pretty well, but you can 
reorder stuff as you see fit.  If anyone has suggestions of issues 
I might have missed let me know.  IΓÇÖll try to work them in.

These are not my scans.  IΓÇÖve been in awe of the folks that 
turn out such amazing scans and youΓÇÖll find most scans are 
tagged by their makers.   Let us hope that the sharing continues.
