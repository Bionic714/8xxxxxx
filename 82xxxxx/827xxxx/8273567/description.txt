"The Doom in the Gloom"

When the Jeffersonian team 
investigates the death of a former 
Marine sergeant whose remains were 
found burned to a crisp, they 
discover that she was discharged 
after a fist fight with another 
Marine. When Booth and Sweets go to 
question the other Marine involved in 
the altercation, they learn that 
Deanna was obsessed with the idea of 
the apocalypse, which leads the team 
to a following of doomsday preppers 
who become key suspects in her death. 
Meanwhile, Sweets thinks he has 
landed his dream apartment but 
Brennan and Booth are not convinced 
that he will actually move out.
