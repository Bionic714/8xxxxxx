JUST FOR FUN! The most psychedelic experience you will have today is right here.

The Grateful Dead perform Dark Star - That's It for the Other One - Turn On Your Lovelight - 90 minutes of unbroken music, compiled from 2 CDs of Dick's Picks Volume 4, which was recorded by Owsley ("Bear") on 2-track stereo analog tape.

Sounds great, looks great.

Not for all tastes obviously; watching the film, following the music and reading the subtitles all at once can be a daunting task. 

Enjoy responsibly. Do not operate heavy machinery. Play loud.
