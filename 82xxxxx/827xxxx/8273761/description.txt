Crossed creator Garth Ennis returns to his stark vision of horror for a four part tale that pits a group of war hardened soldiers on a quest to wipe out the Crossed and reclaim Britain. In "The Fatal Englishman," these warriors stop running and take the fight to the enemy! There is no hope. There is no cure. There is only the Crossed.
