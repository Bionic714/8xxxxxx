,bk2020,2013-03-19T13:08Z,Does this work for Windows XP??
,thatguv,2013-03-19T13:32Z,"Followed instructions, doesn't work. Dont waste your time. Here is the error.

""The application has failed to start because its side-by-side configuration is incorrect. Please see the apllication event log or use the command-line sxstrace.exe tool for more detail"""
,rammer231,2013-03-19T13:37Z,Thanks Hero!
,PseudoPositive,2013-03-19T15:16Z,"@thatguv, I got the same problem but solved it by going into the redist folder & installing the vcredist_x86 it will install OpenMP & a few other things, should fix your problem."
,ziffel323,2013-03-19T16:52Z,why is this one half the size of the others?
,Dz_95,2013-03-19T22:08Z,"In game it stuttering like shit,but in menu just fine..how to fix this?"
,ArkAngel666,2013-03-20T00:18Z,"@ziffel323

It's a re-pack... ergo the entire game was installed, dismantled and repacked so that the things that can be compressed aren't mixed in with things that aren't or were already compressed and this allows those that are compressible to be, and this shrinks the overall size compared to the original rip. As the original way games are prepared, they don't care for compression as they have 4.7/8.9 or however many GB's on how ever many discs they choose to launch it with. Re-packs serve the purpose of torrents and providing smaller downloads so it's faster and uses less bandwidth."
,kaaru,2013-03-20T15:48Z,Same problem with Dz_95. Stutters and the graphics are messy.
,nicklas1212,2013-03-21T06:20Z,"if i change user while in uplay it cant reconnect anymore to skidrow profile to be able to play the game, or whats the password and user to access the uplay emulator?"
,Lala98,2013-03-21T16:38Z,I red that you can only play if you have win vista or 7
,wontquit,2013-03-22T14:23Z,"HeroMaster is amazing as always. 99.9% of everything he uploads works perfectly including this.

@thatguv - if there's an error you probably didn't install correctly or your computer is fucked up.  To tell everyone to not waste their time is a bold statement & ridiculous.  Just because you tried ONE fucking time to install the game & you fucked it up doesn't mean you should be telling everyone else to not DL this.

@Dz_95 & @ kaaru - I'm only running an Athlon 64 X2 5000+, HD 5670 GPU with 4gb RAM & everything is smooth.  If you have a decent PC try updating your drivers or turning off unneeded running processes.

Also, if you've DL'd the v1.02 update, try only installing HeroMasters torrent without the update.  I have the update but there seems to be no reason to install it because the game works great.

Thank you HeroMaster! without you I'd be either broke or bored."
,mikeike65,2013-03-23T22:54Z,"@wontquit Ditto brother
