"One Fine Day"

Ty and Tina receive a late night call from 
Afghanistan, where Corpsman Jacob Gold 
desperately needs help when his fellow Marine 
suffers a traumatic head injury. Sydney 
believes a happy infant's unnatural laughter is 
related to an undiagnosed neurological problem. 
And Sung and Hooten attempt to reconcile the 
husband and sister of a brain-dead gay patient, 
only to find themselves caught in the legal 
crosshairs of the situation.  

18/Slower
Evolve... or die.

Enjoy :)
