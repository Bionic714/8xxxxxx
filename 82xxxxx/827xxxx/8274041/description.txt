Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) takes the creation of client-side Windows applications to a whole new level. Developers moving from Windows Forms will find that the flexibility and richness of WPF makes it possible to create applications unlike any they could previously create. This course introduces the basics of working with WPF, starting with a tour of the basic controls, through data binding.
