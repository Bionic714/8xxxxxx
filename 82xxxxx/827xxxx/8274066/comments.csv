,Mertonoia,2013-03-19T15:20Z,"O....M....G! !  !  I hardly don't know what to say. You definitely possess angel-like qualities. Or, like Simone herself, saintly ones. I know, I gush. It's just that these, the Merton, and now the new folks you've introduced us to are truly my favorite things. I've carried them around wherever I've gone for years. Now, to have them in another favorite thing, always at hand....! Naturally they would come from a new favorite person. 

""Thank You"" doesn't come close, dear one."
[T],pharmakate,2013-03-19T22:14Z,@Mertonoia - LOL! What can I say in response to that ?? But I'm glad I could help out.
