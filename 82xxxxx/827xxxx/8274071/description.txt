Object Oriented Programming will help you improve your programming skill set by giving you a thorough understanding of OOP regardless of your programming background. The training uses a non-jargon approach to teaching the backbone concepts of OOP which have been field tested in years of university-level teaching. While Visual Studio and C# form the instruction environment, the course is language agnostic as possible so the concepts are easily applied to other popular OOP languages and platforms.

The history of programming
About Encapsulation, Inheritance and Polymorphism
How class properties and methods are used
About object state and property methods
The difference between rvalues and lvalues
