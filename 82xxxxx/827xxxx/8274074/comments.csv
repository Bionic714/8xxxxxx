,karolis30,2013-03-20T00:25Z,"@ wepman 
you need VLC player"
,Government10,2013-03-20T01:26Z,"You do not NEED vlc player to run this...

wat you will need, if you plan to watch it over wmp is a codec pack, google it.

i personally hate vlc..  and rather use wmp.

,guitargamer,2013-03-21T05:50Z,Government10 what are you talking about?? you are the kind of a person that confuses everyone...you hate vlc player?? well thats your problem because vlc player is the best media player for windows at the moment no need for extra codec packs or whatever VLC play every single file you want...so please dont compare Vlc with windows media player because wmp is the one that sucks pretty bad!!! and thats not a matter of opinion is just the way it is...in other words shut the hell up because we live in the 21 century where information is available to everyone so get out of the darkness...windows media player...hahaha
,TinTizzy,2013-03-23T06:47Z,I also like wmp better and I use k-lite codecs
,chantally,2013-03-25T22:19Z,"I am kind of a computer idiot, I know how to download music, movies, etc.. but I was reading the comments and I see that there are a few saying that they don't like VLC and I was wondering why. To me VLC is quite easy and I love that. As well, VLC plays EVERYTHING and WMP DOESN'T. But like I said I am definitely not a computer whiz so if someone can tell me about these codec packs please do. But having to use something else (ie. codec packs) wouldn't that be an extra thing that with VLC u don't have too.

Thanks eztv, as always u r the best
cheers from Canada "

,divinunn,2013-04-07T23:32Z,the only thing i ever had to do to view these is go to  utorrent.com and download Utorrent. Everything I DL whether from here or anywhere it goes to my Utorrent app and I watch it from there. You can also make sure you seed and how long bcuz is shows everything about the file before while and after downloading. Thx eztv! I'm also giving the show try after the whole fam has raved about how great it is. The better b right lol!
