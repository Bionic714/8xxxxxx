,SaraGetScared,2013-04-10T15:16Z,"So I downloaded this torrent, and everything was working fine til I got to the crack. I tried replacing the files in the crack folder with the files in the bin folder, but it tells me that there is not enough free space on the drive to put them on there..whats up with that? Im also operating Windows 8, so im not sure if it has to do with that."
,Dainakui,2013-04-14T00:00Z,"So I downloaded this and I accidently tried to play it before I got the crack in. A window came up saying that I needed to verify it. I closed out of it and added the crack. 

Now its not going past the welcome screen when I open it. How do I fix this? Or do I need to re-download and update the entire thing again? >_<

Help please!"
