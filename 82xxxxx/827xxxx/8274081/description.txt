The Sims 3 is built upon the same concept as its predecessors. Players control their own Sims in activities and relationships in a exact manner to real life. The gameplay is open-ended and indefinite. Sim houses and neighborhoods are entirely in one continuous map. The developers stated, "What you do outside your home now matters as much as what you do within." One of the biggest changes to the franchise is the use of rabbit-holes. Sims aren't allowed to go inside the majority of city buildings; instead, they simply disappear inside for a certain amount of timeΓÇöa feature known in video games as a rabbit-hole[citation needed]ΓÇöwhile the player is given several choices on what happens inside using a text-based notification.
