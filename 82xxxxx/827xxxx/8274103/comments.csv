No the phone does NOT need to be rooted. It only needs to be rooted if you want to app, BlackMart, to install apps automatically. Otherwise once finished downloading you have to install it on your own by simply pressing the ""download finished"" notification.

I'm looking for the games now."

I disable my auto rotation while in blackmart as it bugged, but otherwise everything worked great and I really appreciate the upload! "
