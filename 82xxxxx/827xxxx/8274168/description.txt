Six years have passed since Jake Fisher watched Natalie, the love of his life, marry another man. Six years of hiding a broken heart by throwing himself into his career as a college professor. Six years of keeping his promise to leave Natalie alone, and six years of tortured dreams of her life with her new husband, Todd.

But six years havenΓÇÖt come close to extinguishing his feelings, and when Jake comes across ToddΓÇÖs obituary, he canΓÇÖt keep himself away from the funeral. There he gets the glimpse of ToddΓÇÖs wife heΓÇÖs hoping forΓÇªbut she is not Natalie. Whoever the mourning widow is, sheΓÇÖs been married to Todd for almost two decades, and with that fact everything Jake thought he knew about the best time of his lifeΓÇöa time he has never gotten overΓÇöis turned completely inside out. 

As Jake searches for the truth, his picture-perfect memories of Natalie begin to unravel. Mutual friends of the couple either canΓÇÖt be found, or donΓÇÖt remember Jake. No one has seen Natalie in years. JakeΓÇÖs search for the woman who broke his heart, who lied to him, soon puts his very life at risk as it dawns on him that the man he has become may be based on a carefully constructed fiction.
