,MagiciansFR,2013-04-08T22:02Z,"nihilizm, I think something must be wrong. I see you seeding now and then, but nothing has changed in the last couple of weeks at least. Everybody is stuck at 93%. As best I can tell your seeding is not deong any good. Don't know why that would be???"
,MagiciansFR,2013-04-19T00:13Z,Still stuck at 93% along with everyone else.
,MagiciansFR,2013-04-30T21:17Z,"Nihilizm, any chance you could post this torrent again, this one is dead. I don't think anyone ever completed it, thus you had no help seeding. Something is wrong with this one, everyone has been stuck at 93% for over a month."
