,loanroamingtiger,2013-03-19T10:26Z,Doesn't work for me...
,loanroamingtiger,2013-03-19T11:06Z,"Scratch that - works with changed settings, but only windowed, not fullscreen."
,anti-shit,2013-03-19T11:10Z,Runs fine on 10.6.8 and 10.8.3 for me. XQuartz is of course required to be installed to run it.
,anti-shit,2013-03-19T11:14Z,"Full screen works fine for me as well *shrugs* 
Changing the in-game settings for full screen/windowed mode seems to work fine with the given wine config as well."
,loanroamingtiger,2013-03-19T15:24Z,"Yeah, in fullscreen I get glitches everywhere. Played through the 1st chapter windowed. Interesting...

How do you save though?

Cheers!"
,anti-shit,2013-03-19T20:16Z,"For info, I'm running this on 10.8.3 - just did a test run on another system with 10.6.8. I also am using NVIDIA graphics. That can make a difference in games running through WINE, which graphics card is being used. 

How to save? well the game shows you how - just hit Esc, select ""SAVE"" - then in the window in the upper corner hit SAVE in that and enter in the name of the save state you want it to be saved as - that's all. Works the same way with loading the saved states."
,anti-shit,2013-03-19T20:20Z,"Meh according to the wine db entry it just says everything works. Heh.

I'm not sure what to say regarding your full screen issue. Are you using the latest XQuartz version, and what's the graphics card you are using?"
,rusty-koathanger,2013-03-30T14:34Z,Plays great so far-nice work!
,Perpa666,2013-04-09T13:13Z,"Fullscreen mode does not work for me either, the game is all glitched-up and lagging. I've tried it on my MBP; i5 2,3 ghz, Intel HD Graphics 3000 (384 mb). Is there anything that can be done, or is my graphic card to inferior or something?"
,Perpa666,2013-04-09T14:06Z,"Problem solved! Open up the installed package, and enter the wrapper; Advanced > Tools > Winetricks. Run ""ddr = gdi"", located under Settings. VOILA!"
