For the last 2-3 years I have been listening to Sonix, Summer Solstice has always been the perfect fallback to everything. The track listing is great, the mixing is flawless, and a single upbeat mood is maintained throughout the mix. I GREATLY recommend checking out Summer Solstice if you are just passing by.

Another mix that lightly compares to the track listing and energetic tone of this side is Sonix's "Live at ETN 2005-04-03".

I would reccomend that you start these mixes with Live at ETN and end it was Summer solstice if you plan on running through these in one sitting.



MOST RECENT MIX:
Liquid Courage.
This is another great mix by Sonix mixed with liquid D&B in mind. This is a very relaxing, but energizing mix and i hope you too can enjoy it.

Trivia:
Sonix's longest mix is "Live on Radio Journey With Sonix Around The Globe In 12 Hours 2004-04-26" and the run time for it is 12 hours, 2 minutes, and 27 seconds.
I have yet to even hear of a mix that tops this play time.
not that i would be sure that i wanted it.
I suggest playing this when afk or sleep with the music playing.
