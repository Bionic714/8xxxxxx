really fun
maybe a bit faster would be nice
if you accept suggestion, for later stages having an ""upgrade system"" would be nice too
the more you play, the more points you get
then you use those points to increase initial flick force, the extra speed/height you get from the, etc
how do i send you money? you have paypal or something?"

Thanks for playing and giving your feedback, those are some good ideas and I will be taking them into consideration. 

As for donations: www.flickit.com 
there you can make your pledge and see my progress.
