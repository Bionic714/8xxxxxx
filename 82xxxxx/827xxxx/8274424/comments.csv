,core2lord,2013-03-19T10:00Z,Squad and their full (game download) updates...torrents shouldn't be a more effective (downloading the media) solution than their own server...
,numba6,2013-03-19T13:01Z,Could you upload the Linux version as well? They released a Linux version with 0.19 starting. It would be great if you did that. Thanks!
,DarkNewb,2013-03-19T13:06Z,"so Anonymous uploader is core2lord

good to know"
,ek7opa,2013-03-19T13:43Z,update the mac version PLEASEEEEEEE!!!!!!
,skn_scott,2013-03-19T16:31Z,Linux and OSX versions have been uploaded! How good is that!
,djaalog,2013-03-20T11:27Z,@DarkNewb What are you doing dude.. Anonymous uploader names aren't meant to be revealed --'

Kill yourself"
,.h.264,2013-03-21T14:56Z,"@DarkNewb Actually, my crew are the 'anonymous' uploaders of most of these 'anonymous' uploads. What're you going to do about it? Suck a dick fag. You can't intimidate us. It's like you've only got one secret leak at Squad and you're a bees dick away from catching them? 

Yeah, fuck that. Half your fucking dev team know management are fucking corrupt, you've even tried to personally fucking attack and take out two journalists now who were exposing you running off with the cash. 

As long as you're run by obsessive control freak psychopathic twats you're going to have your own team betraying your money grubbing ass by handing this shit out to the gaming community.

Not to mention Steam have already been flooded with complaints that Squad are another The War Z type company selling an incomplete alpha that hasn't really got anywhere in two+ years now because of the scum in management who are making sure the good guys behind this game are fucking dicked if they try and aspire to making more than just screwing consumers out of money.

Hell, they're even selling a $7 game for $22 on Steam now conning people for more money! Ridiculous!!"
,CanadianPsycho,2013-03-22T00:59Z,"Ha! HA! Darknewb got owned,I was going to buy this game off steam,but fuck that now!
Thanks Anon ;)"
,HanZie82,2013-03-22T06:10Z,"Saw this game on youtube and thought i's try it.
As always looked for some reviews first, at wich time i saw all the nonsense about the dev-team.
Thanks god for free downloading so i dont have to deal with those money hungry bastards.

And the way they react is the worst part (for them), it could've been saved by reacting profesionaly but no. They be dumb. "
,Puddl3s,2013-03-24T20:04Z,Can someone upload the OS X version? My mac runs much better than my computer and the latest version is not on the Bay.

Were you high when you wrote that comment? Like, legitimately out of your mind?

>selling an incomplete alpha

Apparently you don't understand the difference between selling an incomplete, broken game and selling early access to an alpha.

>they're even selling a $7 game for $22 on Steam now

So a detailed space & atmospheric flight simulator with the feature of building your own crafts from scratch and extensive modding support is worth 7$ to you? You asshole are why we can't have nice games anymore. You are scum even among the piracy community.

>conning people for more money

Because selling a game on Steam is clearly a con, yeah,"
,Dracky3k,2013-03-30T08:31Z,I love it when im browsing torrents and i come upon comment trail like this. thanks for my morning laugh guys
,ForCom5,2013-03-30T20:25Z,"^^^^^^^^^^
Winna winna chicken dinna!"
,Oswega,2013-04-01T22:20Z,"I have torrented this game before, when it is completely fixed ill pay 50$ for it, but until then it should be free on your site ksp."
,H3r4tKMND,2013-04-06T05:12Z,"@Oswega: They're charging roughly $20 USD for a demo. They need that money somehow.

I don't like it, but I already bought a copy because this is worth the cash. 

However, in order to get updates, I *have to* torrent because my firewall is setup to block .exe files, which screws with some of the patchers I have."

,Kom3dian,2013-04-17T04:26Z,"By far @DarkNewb is one of the most retarded ""people"" on this site. Why is he even here?"
,Sturmkrahe,2013-04-22T03:45Z,"Are you one of the folks that got suckered into transferring KSP onto Steam only to find that it was no longer portable, despite numerous community staff claims to the contrary? Well you're in luck! The Pirate Bay has you covered!

Perhaps you're considering getting this game, but don't want to deal with the non-portable nature of Steam or the 100KB/s download speed of the KSP store? Well you're in luck again! The Pirate Bay has you covered!"
,rocksbury,2013-04-25T05:04Z,"Love the game but seriously i do think they are stealing money.
I bought it way back when...6 months ago and to see the updates they have made with the team, modding community and funding they have i am not impressed.

they keep adding small effects, even planets i mean they only have a few around the one sun in 2 years.

I hope they add a real campaign type element or  incorporate the currency in game, add multiplayer or scoreboards...Something to show people they are making an attempt.
Like the modding community has added 500+ parts,ships,etc and they release an update with some removed and 2/3 new parts."
,pipirupirupirupipirupi,2013-05-08T21:22Z,"This game used to be free, and from what I've seen since I last played it, they've only added a few new components and dressed it up a little.

I'm sorry but It's not worth buying for $20 I wouldn't mind paying $5 or even donating to a kickstarter to get them going. 

I rarely pirate games, but when I do it's because they are no longer turning a decent profit and thus are not available in local stores or are unfinished/crappy games."
,Sturmkrahe,2013-05-14T00:59Z,"The game is 20 dollars because they outsourced their community interactions to team that closes any forum threads that question the game in any way.

I'd say go look on the forums to see my point, but there was a convenient database rollback right after complaints about the Steam version started pouring in."
,XDubstep,2013-05-18T17:56Z,"All right every one calm down, jeez, really if your here and your not getting torrents, just go away, really getting mad at people over the Internet does nothing at all, people should know this by now.  Anyway thanks for the Torrent downloading at 500kB/s pretty good for such a small file, would seed but changing Internet providers so i want a small bill this month, will seed later though. :P"
,bashpr0mpt,2013-05-19T16:11Z,"Hey, remember. You're talking about a 'company' that didn't like the review they got from me when I wrote an article covering their game; when I logged in next I was banned everywhere. I made an account to ask if that was reaffirming my comments in the article that they seem to have some crazy forum ideas (ie: I was banned for 'profanity' which was made a bannable offense the day I was banned and retroactively applied to messages weeks / months prior to it! ie: they made up a rule to silence a critic and didn't care about hiding it) and to ask whether it was because I called them out on every new release using stolen code from the modding community without paying them (to which they replied 'lol we're in mexico let them try and sue us') who then took their websites off line and tweeted repeatedly that 'bashpr0mpt is attacking our servers' to try and discredit me and turn their brain dead user base against me.

Check my Twitter stream if you want a break down of more details about why Squad are fuckstains, entirely unprofessional, and a pack of scammers who make The War Z's developers seem like keen businessmen. That said, they again claimed they were 'being attacked' when a torrent of their latest distro was released, they consider us torrenting their stuff as an 'attack'. Go fucking figure.

I should probably also mention that they're charging four times as much now for what fundamentally has barely changed in almost three years. Proof once devs have your money they're in no rush to give you the finished product.

Worst part is they claim they are broke! They reckon the free one click installed Wordpress website they're using as the space port (they stole off a guy who ran the prior version of) along with a one click install phpBB forum cost them MAGICALLY the exact figure that we accused them of having made from stolen code profits.

So they're not only lying scumbags, but they're not even putting any effort into their lies. Fuck you Squad. In twenty years reviewing games, I've never encountered such an unprofessional 'software development firm,' you should be ashamed of yourselves. You act like children, then throw a tantrum and take your game and servers offline while accusing ME of 'attacking' you? Still waiting on that proof, or at least a definition of what kind of 'attack' I allegedly caused bitches. :)"
,lolcable,2013-05-21T10:13Z,Thanks OP and Seeders.
,cesarcurado,2013-05-22T23:28Z,"Please, update to 0.20 as soon as you can!
and thanks for the great and fast torrent."
