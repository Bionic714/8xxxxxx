Don't let your status off ''capper'' get to your head, we all enjoy being kind talking back and forth to one another on here so seeing this just ruined it for me and ruined my usual long comment I like to leave people enjoy reading. Not everyone knows who you are and your quality so drop the ego a bit and act like a normal person and conisder those people who do want to know what they are downloading. I know when I am downloading off some random person if they include screen shot images I always choose that person over the other choices feeling like its less likely to be a virus/scammer. So I will leave you with this statement, one good turn deserves another, so thankyou for allowing me to download this from you, so now maybe you can show a little bit of humbleness from now on. Thanks."

,MissAnaMatronic,2013-03-19T14:23Z,"I bet my life on it your a teenage kid in his room, so grow up a bit, and just learn to be nice. Anyway unfortunately this torrent will not get any speed on it and is saying its ETD is 2 years and 38 wks and wont rise above 0.2 k/b or 0.3 k/bs max so if you want a faster download but just not in HD but in my opinion I think it is but just a smaller file coz how coulds it still be so damn clear and I am a stickler for visual. The 2 shows downloaded in 5 minutes so if you dont want to wait the 2 yrs until people seed, download these which I think most people have and thats why this wont seed. Also be nice FabuTrash, youve ruined my picture in my head of who you are as I downlaod from you all the time. I dont want to think of u as a dick. : (

,Grid1ock,2013-03-19T15:18Z,SEED please!!!... 
,WuzzlePopple,2013-03-19T15:53Z,"OH MY! The fuck off part is not offensive geesh,
maybe they were trying to be funny and have that diva attitude like rupaul has, but i don't find the discription offensive at all.

rockster will no longer be uploading this show.
I'm not sure who I was downloading this series from, but if it was rockster than I guess I won't be downloading it from him any longer.

I hope you will continue to share. I like you...

Thank you for this!"
,RPDRplus,2013-03-19T16:15Z,"It's ok, Ana, it was just a joke. Thank you fabutrash for doing this. We really appreciate it."
,meluckycharms,2013-03-19T16:16Z,"""I know tis the shit!""  Always wait for your upload, amazing quality.  MissAnaMatronic, the uploader is not trying to catch any bees, they are not getting paid for this.  They are taking the time out of their life to put these shows on here for us with nothing in return except maybe a thank you. There are other places to get this, but I for one really appreciate their work in uploading such great quality.  You're offended by something that was said to be funny, yet you are downloading and watching a show that is mostly queens being catty and mean to each other, having big egos, and saying much worse than this.  No disrespect was made to you personally or anyone else.  I also don't want to disregard what you may have felt by the comment;  I personally thought it was funny.  But as you said ""you get more bees with honey"" and we are the ones that need to be nice, we are getting something from the uploader, not the other way around.

Anyway, big thanks to fabutrash!  Looking forward to more episodes.  MissAna, have a great day and enjoy the show, that's what it's all about.  :)"
,j_makoto,2013-03-19T16:43Z,"Thanks once more. And people, instead of arguing if something's offensivo or not... just seed please!!! =D"
,mrjords,2013-03-19T16:48Z,"Welcome back Fabu!

And Ana - FUCK OFF and do your homework!"
[T],ShoReleases,2013-03-19T17:00Z,"RKSTR is still uploading this series, if u search for it properly then u'll get it or u could just go to my page."

,tallieee,2013-03-19T21:08Z,"Thanks so much for uploading! 

I'm afraid there's a problem, though--I've been stuck at 6.7% for several hours now, and I've seen others say the same thing. Do you mind double-checking your seed? Thanks again!"
,hazardoflove,2013-03-20T00:40Z,"@MissAnaMatronic - Chill out.  Whomever Fabutrash is, he/she does this for free.  They don't make money off of this, and they do it for our enjoyment.  So instead of griping when he says a bad word, just say ""Thanks"" if you download, and move on.  They don't HAVE to do this for us, and they're risking a lot by doing so.  You've been downloading since the first episode, so you know the quality,  and you don't know but maybe they were in a hurry and wanted to upload quickly and didn't have time for screencaps or samples.  So don't go off on a tangent when a bad word is used.  If you don't like it, then feel free to go to another uploader, amazon, or watch it on Logo when it's repeated.  

Thank you, and have a nice day!

PS - Thanks, Fabutrash, for the quality upload!

PSS - There is a tracker offline, so that may be why the Download is stuck/moving slow.  I'm not connected to any seeds in the swarm, but the download is creeping along.  Seed everyone!!!"
,javieRaloud,2013-03-20T02:11Z,Seriously Fabutrash you are everything! You don't know how much I enjoy watching this show in HD! Thank you so much xoxo.
,JorgePoty,2013-03-20T03:05Z,"Thank you fabutrash! I love you Your torrents are the best! 

PEOPLE, SEED! This is the best quality available on this site! The best torrent and the untucked comes together! SEED it, bitches!!"
,nerdpl,2013-03-20T08:38Z,Another perfect realease! Can't wait to watch it :P I love you fabutrash! I wanna have your baby ;D
,WuzzlePopple,2013-03-20T20:03Z,"RKSTR did upload the newest episode, but he also commented that he will no longer upload this show after e08."
,WuzzlePopple,2013-03-20T20:08Z,"oh, well, the comment is not there anymore, and now it says he is still going to finish posting. 
so, misunderstanding, thanks to all of you though for taking the time to upload my favorite shows."
