The nation may have fallen in love with baking but for many, homemade
bread seems a challenge too far. Britain's favourite Master Baker,
Paul Hollywood, is on a mission to share his passion for baking bread
in this new series. Over six weeks, he will reveal the secrets of breads
from all over the world and with a feast of mouth-watering recipes,
he'll show how even the most humble loaf can be transformed into delicious
dishes for breakfast, lunch and dinner.

In this first programme, we celebrate the history and traditional
flavours of great British bread. Paul explains the basics of bread
making by making a classic white bloomer, a gorgeous crusty everyday
bread that he transforms into the perfect portable lunch, and his
colourful roasted vegetable picnic loaf. We track the history of British
bread making from farm to miller, brewer and baker and Paul bakes his
ultimate ploughman's loaf, a rye, oat and ale round. For tea, there is
nothing better than a slice of Paul's honey glazed, fruit-packed
malt loaf. But his breads are no sideshow, so for a hearty family dinner
he bakes his medieval-style rye and wholemeal trencher, a stunning
centrepiece flat loaf piled high with watercress salad and sliced,
seared lamb leg steaks in a mustard dressing.
