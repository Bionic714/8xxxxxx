,bluesborn,2013-03-21T04:03Z,"never thought I'd get to the age where I'd start in on all the ""when I was your age"" blather but listening to the whining about quality when you can download a movie almost the same day it hits the theaters...well when I was your age..we used to get 3 shitty channels on tv(before cable) and half the time you'd have to climb up on the roof to adjust the antenna so you could watch ""hinter land hints"" or the fucking farm report. So shut the fuck up you GD spoiled brats and get the fuck off my lawn."
,Saitaina,2013-03-21T14:36Z,"Jesus, it's  cam rip, people.  You want better quality and no Vader breathing, go watch the movie.  

Thanks for the upload, needed this for a project."
,professorjpj,2013-03-21T15:09Z,"bluesborn I have to disagree!  We have a right to complain..  As things improve technology wise, and we become more resourceful, standards also raise, and  quality SHOULD be an issue!!   Yes, its ""free"", however, we all pay for internet access, and dedicate our bandwidth AND time to even get this stuff!   So I think we do have a right to complain.. Perhaps some people like you can watch a crap camera and it doesnt bother you, but I deserve better.. So yes, if its crap, people with higher standards lime me SHOULD complain!  We have the right!"
,wizardofoz79,2013-03-21T18:08Z,professorjpj no you do not have the right to complain. That would be like a starving homeless person complaining because he does not like the free food someone gave him. If that's the case sit there on your ass and starve. But me when i get hungry I'm going to eat.
,jailedheart,2013-03-22T04:10Z,you babies should stop complaining.. ITS FREE!! BE THANKFUL. You want higher quality? then pay for it and watch it in cinemas!!
,eternalsoul2012,2013-03-22T06:35Z,thx alot great work
,wika003,2013-03-22T08:00Z,"how about the quality??
nice share bro,"
,Calamakuya,2013-03-22T21:31Z,"Those retards whining about the quality of a cam, have my permission to go to the movies and watch it 3D if so they want. Just make sure you stop complaining on something you have no right nor the balls to.

Thanks you shawnmurthy for your hard work."
,TheCrowdGoesWild,2013-03-23T09:28Z,"@professorjpj 

You're a cock. Complaining about the quality of the stolen movie that you've just illegally downloaded is like complaining that the TV that you've just stolen from a house isn't big enough.

If you don't think that the quality is good enough then go to the police or your ISP, maybe even contact the publisher of the film and tell them that the illegal copy that you got is shit, see what they tell you."
,xxpandorxx,2013-03-24T16:39Z,lol ... I get a kick out of morons who complain about free illegal stuff. They hide behind their computers to post comments so others can comment on their idiotic posts lol... To bad theres no way to ban them from this site and their IP's.. Take the good with the bad I've always said!!!
,live2fight4whatsright,2013-03-24T19:15Z,"I've been reading peoples comments for years, and seen all the whining and complaining. It amazes me how immature some people are. Do I think that they could record a better quality video... yes. Or try and not breath into the camera.. yes but at least there doing it... right. We could have no choice but to go to the theater and pay.

professorjpj!!!!

To call you a dim-witted fool would not even begin to describe you or your asinine comments. To think that you are just entitled... is preposterous. Your gene pool should sterilized to prevent the continuation of brain dead fools like yourself. You display your Sh#$ for brains every time you open your mouth.

Bluesborn-

 You are absolutely right. If the kids today are the future then its in trouble  If your reading this then i'm sure you know exactly what i mean.

!!Thank you for your upload!!

!!Great Moaning throughout the movie. I'd hate to hear you breath when you have to walk. lol

!!!!!NOTE!!!! DO NOT GO to the link provided by riyad4747................... The site looks great but its a SCAM.. you enter your card number for a trail, after 5 days they charge you 50$"
,cairnlae,2013-03-24T23:40Z,"The guy that made the cam is either:
1. fallen asleep
2. fairly obese
or 3. masturbating.
all lame jokes aside, I appreciate the upload. And for the,obviously,14 yr old that thinks its his god given right to complain about the quality,you should be doing your history homework and learning what REAL rights are. You little twat."
,highmannblaze,2013-03-25T00:32Z,u know wat amaze me about some people they complain but never uploading..if u so smart then upload a good quality clip mate
,Wave_rider,2013-03-25T11:21Z,"This is just an utter fail of an attempt. 

Cam operator's heavy breathing and unstable hands, and EVERYTHING, are unbearable. Could tell it would be piss poor as soon as it started, falling all over the place like he was resting the cam on his bitch tits, directly under his vader mask. WOW.

This upload is CRAP. Don't waste your time!!

A/V for a cam: 2/1

Cam operator needs to pick another hobby, and I suggest that be...working out."
,charley0,2013-03-25T18:20Z,"Thanks, 5/10 for cam, *S"
,Shoobox,2013-03-25T20:50Z,"What is up with all these 1.3gb -1.5gb-2.0gb cams

I remember when 600mb or 700mb were a good size and have better quality than these big shitty sizes"
,lamportyx,2013-03-27T01:15Z,"All the people knows is to complaint, if you can upload a movie that has not been release yet, well then you must be real pro and rather a magician but there is no such thing as exactly like that, even magic is not real so then therefore you should be very thankful if some one have done there work even if it is not as good as you expected!"
,twatable,2013-03-27T02:09Z,"@cairnlae jokes, little twat made me lol"
,judy555,2013-03-27T13:48Z,Thank you sooooooo much!!!!!! Really great.
,fakenamington,2013-03-27T15:09Z,THIS IS TERRIBLE.  I actually JUST joined Pirate Bay so that I could comment on how TERRIBLE this is.  DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT.  JUST GO SEE IT.  IT SUCCKKKKSSSSSS.
,fakenamington,2013-03-27T15:10Z,HALF the screen isn't even in the picture!    It's TERRIBLE. 
,fakenamington,2013-03-27T17:21Z,"IGNORE THE LINK ABOVE THIS COMMENT, it is SPAM and they are trying to get your Credit Card #."
,fakenamington,2013-03-27T18:30Z,ALL the LINKS to OTHER MOVIES are FAKE!  They are trying to steal your Credit Card info. 
,ChasUGC,2013-03-29T04:18Z,Ignore the spam links. They are just trying to get your credit card info or your email address to spam you for all eternity.
,Bjakkz,2013-03-30T00:33Z,"I think of an blowjob when I see people complaining, whining like shits craping out from anus and fall in the toilet.. You want quality? blow me and I can get you some fresh quality"
,jeyjoloco,2013-04-01T01:48Z,"a guy snoring most of the movie, it is really annoying"
,Pdid,2013-04-01T16:11Z,"@Professor-You dont deserve anything. These are pirated films. There is no guarantee of quality. If so entitled to better quality, go risk jailtime and show us how it's done. If not, stfu. Thanks to Darth Vader and uploader for effort."
,bobbymagee41,2013-04-01T19:09Z,"You guys are complaining about people complaining. That is so silly. I too grew up with three channels and black and white TV. But as the one gentleman says, technology waits for no one. The reason for the comments is to tell people what it is they would be downloading, so please keep complaining or giving praise where due, that way I can make an informed decision to whether I want to download it or not"
,Wonlegged,2013-04-01T19:39Z,thanks man
,youngtimer,2013-04-01T21:18Z,very bad quality
,loki-5108,2013-04-05T03:30Z,"Don't follow the above links, they are BOGUS.

,Popekain,2013-04-11T21:52Z,"I rarely login here, only to give thanks for an amazing torrent usualy, however I just wanted to say
LMFAO@bluesborn that comment made me laugh so hard cuz i was thinking something similar... thanks for making my day hoss!"
,bobbymagee41,2013-04-15T07:24Z,when did the comment section become a damn chat room...you put in what you think the quality is and that's it   you don't curse people because the quality is shitty and they post it...are you retarded
,bfh700,2013-04-18T05:04Z,"Haven't seen this cam, but when i look for a descent one I always go to the comments to check out the A and V rating. Lately though all I am reading is whining. about illegal free shit..... DAMN! If your knowledgeable enough to critique it technically then FIX THA SHIT and re upload it!   "
,SelfExistingSun,2013-04-19T11:11Z,i read this shit while smoking a FATTY!!!! i hadn't laughed that hard in a while ty    A/V 4/5 cheers
,REDEYESWOLF,2013-04-21T07:15Z,"A:6  V:5
Not bad for a cam.

First off some of you are pissing over the fact that others are complaining about the quality and some of you are pissing over the right to do this. Well if your going to comment on the quality then a simple run down like I did it the beginning should be good enough. I mean no one cares what you think about the movie just rate the movie's quality and be on your way. Thanks a million, great torrent man."
[V],Sir_TankaLot,2013-05-01T07:11Z,thx
,Calamakuya,2013-05-22T20:40Z,"It really gets worst when the possible release date of a BRrip or DVDrip approaches. 

As of June 18, 2013 the DVD and BR will be available and maybe... just maybe we'll get a better copy on TPB.

Eitherway, those fucktards that are complaining about the quality of a cam release, are welcome to try and do better if they can, tho I kind of doubt they know anything besides talking shit.."
,Jake9977,2013-05-24T13:38Z,"O wow, despite that its quality is next to none, the guy filming it is breathing way louder than the movies audio. I honestly tried so very hard to ignore it but it's just too much! 2 of 10 (maybe a 1 actually"
