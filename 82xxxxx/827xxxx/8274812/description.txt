Unable to tie the knot with his prozac captivated girlfriend, Cuban Filmmaker Sebastian Cortez, finds himself 30-years old and never in love. On his quest to finding..."The One!", Sebastian turns to friend/tour guide Daria who introduces Sebastian to her sandbox of gay co-horts and the adventure of his life! From penis make overs, unlikely 3-ways to learning how to have the best climax, the unsophisticated but sexy Sebastian finds himself navigating through the uncharted waters of Hollywood, sexual politics and getting trapped between Mr. Big Time and...Toilet Man? Is this QUEER EYE FOR THE BI-GUY? Can a girl turn a straight man queer? Or is it just the endless margaritas talking? All these questions answered in this sardonic, hilarious and universal film about the pursuit of finding someone to permanently spoon with. A comedy for audiences of all persuasions regardless who is giving you that orgasm.
