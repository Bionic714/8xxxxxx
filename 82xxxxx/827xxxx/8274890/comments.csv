[T],pharmakate,2013-03-19T23:59Z,"@480v - I get that a lot. I think it has something to do with the way the trackers aggregate the seeder numbers -- it seems to count the same seeder more than once via DHT or whatever trackers are found. Or something like that. Obviously I'm no expert! But it'll sort itself out.

And hey, thanks for the Thom Hartmann Program!"
