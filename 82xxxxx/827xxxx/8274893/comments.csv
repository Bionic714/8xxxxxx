,dombedos,2013-03-23T00:48Z,"I could not either use the patch file.
I made a new one ; I made a new torrent, but without a permanent internet connection, I can't make sure I can seed regularly.
http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8289079

I can explain how I did it. Quite simple.
go to http://ipatch.org to download iPatch.
Launch iPatch. Create a new Patch with any original and modified files from your computer.
Save new Patch.
Edit new Patch application content and replace Contents/Resources with the similar folder provided in this torrent.
