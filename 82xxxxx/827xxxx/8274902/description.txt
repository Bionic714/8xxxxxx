Ep 18: A Shot Through the Heart

PREMIERE: Monday March 18, 8:00 pm
 
Adrienne throws an eye-popping party to launch her new vodka line, but her relationship with Paul worsens, even as Paul tries to impress her by dressing up as a tree. News of their separation reaches the shocked women as they head toward Lisa's housewarming party/vow renewal. Drama develops quickly, as Brandi confronts Marisa about talking behind her back. Things get uglier when Brandi's enemy Faye interrupts. Trouble is clearly about to ensue.
 
 
Next week is the finale followed by part 1 of the reunion.
