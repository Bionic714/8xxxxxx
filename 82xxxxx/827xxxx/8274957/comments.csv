,mentallyours,2013-03-19T15:22Z,"LeBron James had 37 points and 12 assists, as the Miami Heat overcame 43 points from Jeff Green to defeat the Boston Celtics 105-103 for their 23rd consecutive win. The visitors trailed by as many as 17 points in the first half against a shorthanded Celtics squad that was playing without Kevin Garnett (flu). The Heat fought back however, spoiling Green's career night with a game-winning jumper from James with ten seconds remaining. Boston came up empty in their final possession, allowing Miami to escape with the hard fought win.

,az25,2013-03-19T15:54Z,"@mentallyours i already knew what was going to happen, but some of us would like to have an element of surprise since not all of us get ESPN to watch this shit live. So, jackass, how about a little discretion next time?"
,MartinD1,2013-03-19T17:45Z,"Thanks a lot !!!
You're the N°1 source for NBA torrents.
Amazing game, Miami 23th in a row, that's just fantastic and I'm not even a fan !"
,calgeiser,2013-03-20T02:04Z,"holy shit, enough with the spoilers"
,aiigghht,2013-03-20T02:33Z,"The video keeps dropping out every minute or so on this one.

I came here to see if anyone had commented on the video to find out if this continued for the whole video. I didn't expect someone to be stupid enough to post the results in the comments but I guess some people are just bat shit retarded and there's nothing we can do about that.

,aiigghht,2013-03-20T02:44Z,"Video seems good, Only dropped out a couple of times early in the 1st"
,aiigghht,2013-03-20T02:49Z,"nope I was wrong, the video keeps cutting out every few seconds in the 2nd quarter, very annoying. 

any other game and I would have stopped watching"
,karkar88,2013-03-20T13:13Z,what in the heck with the cutting... F&*^*
