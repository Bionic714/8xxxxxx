,claiho,2013-04-05T17:17Z,"Torrent safety rule no 1:

NEVER EVER DOWNLOAD F**ING MOVIES IN RAR OR ZIP FILES! It's ALWAYS a trick and you are sure to regret it. Just search for another torrent, one that isn't packed. Then you will at least see the files."
[V],alexisthebest,2013-04-08T05:41Z,"@claiho 

Actually, that's not a rule. Just know what you can possibly be getting into if it's not a known uploader or you dont know the source of the file.

Scene releases are almost always packed in Rar archives. It's just common for them to be unpacked by the time they reach the public trackers like TPB. 

If you dont know about torrents, dont state random rules you go by.

Rule 1: Stay safe. Know what you're getting yourself into.

But as stated. Dont waste your time on this if people already have and have said so in the comments."
,ironymon,2013-04-24T11:52Z,"@alexisthebest

Wrong, If the uploader has no skull or is not trusted i don't even download. Only got fooled once. Fool me once, shame on me, fool me twice, i send an assassin after you, yeah they're cheap these days."
