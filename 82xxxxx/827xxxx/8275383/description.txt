KAI'S Power GOO With Windows XP Patch Fix
ASIN: B00061F3MS

System Requirements

Platform:MAC OS/Windows 95/Windows XP (Vista & 7 Untested)
Media: CD-ROM


This is KAI'S Power GOO which has been discontinued as it switched hands through 3-4 different companies. I know Corel was one of them among others. You can take any photo, namely a person's
face and rearrange it in various ways in Kai's Power GOO functions known as Nudge , Smudge, Smooth, Grow/Shrink, Mirror Toggle and several more. It would take great experience to do this
in Photoshop for instance. Plus there are over 170 more images on the CD .ISO 

You can use pictures from Scanners, Memory Cards, Video, Digital Cameras as well as make movies
in standard AVI, QuickTime or 'Goovie' format. GOO is used to create screen savers, T-shirts, Greeting Cards, Mugs, Calendars and what ever else uses imagery. This uses a easy to use floating interface for all ages.

For those readers who don't read titles or pay attention. This comes WITH the Windows XP Fix!
Many remember how it hated that's OS. That has been fixed finally! If it runs on Vista or Windows
7,8 hasn't been tested yet.

PLEASE SEED! PLEASE SEED! PLEASE SEED!
