Before Today is an album by Ariel Pink's Haunted Graffiti (the first time presented as a group), released on June 8, 2010, by 4AD. The album contains several homages to vintage rock and roll songs, such as "Bright Lit Blue Skies" which was originally recorded by the Rockin' Ramrods in 1966, and "Beverly Kills," which draws heavily on Ago's 1982 track "For You." "Reminiscences" is an instrumental cover of an Ethopian pop song, "I Remember a Man" by Yeshimebet Dubale. In December 2010, Pitchfork Media named "Round and Round" the best song of 2010. Pitchfork placed it at number 9 on its list "The Top 50 Albums of 2010".
