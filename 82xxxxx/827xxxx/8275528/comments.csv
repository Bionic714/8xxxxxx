,zlayall,2013-03-19T20:35Z,"Thanx, but the sound is out of sync, very annoying in the fighting sequences."
,gtroll,2013-03-20T04:52Z,if the sound is out of sync on any film you can very easily manually adjust it using the sync audio settings in VLC.... if you can't find them remember Google is your friend ;-/
,thedhelz,2013-03-20T05:25Z,english subtitle?
,budchap,2013-03-20T05:39Z,English Subs http://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/4875167/yi-dai-zong-shi-en
,Sumoki,2013-03-20T06:28Z,idk if i can watch a movie about Ip man without Donnie Yen playing Ip man.
,imfean,2013-03-20T13:46Z,This is a mandarin dubbed version. Anyone happens to have the original cantonese audio track? 
,Tanlic,2013-03-20T14:14Z,Can't possibly be as good as  IP Man starring Donnie Yen which me is the best MA film Since enter the Dragon..will download  anyway TY
,TruWING,2013-03-20T15:44Z,"Is this a movie about epic Starcraft 2 players? That would be cool.

(I know this isn't a movie about Starcraft 2 players durrr)"
,Tanlic,2013-03-20T17:39Z,"No disrespect to the uploader but what utter junk. Wire-fu at it's worst, impossible feats straight out of a comic book and an insult to Ip Man"
,awem,2013-03-20T19:06Z,the video quality is pretty bad for 1.4GB because of the reencoding. audio is heavily distorted and mono despite of what the description would have you believe. don't bother with this version unless for some reason you're desperate to see the film
,qq107,2013-03-21T01:10Z,"@condors369
Great quality~ but do you have the Cantonese (original) audio track for this movie? The Mandarin is quite poorly dubbed, unfortunately."
,squash34,2013-03-21T03:33Z,"chink hardsubs with english soft subs over them.

quite annoying."

,thereisnoother,2013-03-31T09:30Z,The English subtitles are not working for me with this one and I am using a digital media player which never has a problem with any SRT files. Weird. Too bad as I was willing to suffer through the double text to see this one. 
,cROMADO,2013-04-05T20:14Z,"Good quality, but have chinese subtitles in the movie. this is shit.

Boa qualidade, mas tem legenda em Chines no filme."

,ozeem301,2013-04-14T01:01Z,"in this movie: WTF master ip is immortal, not a scratch, unlike donnie yen version, ipman is more 'human' !, and I hate kungfu movie with flying mode on, using rope, cable, throwing people like toys, from now donny yen is still the best ipman movie i've seen"
