[T],MrDowntown,2013-03-19T23:47Z,"Ame-Comi Girls #24 is the most current issue, therefore its up to date on TPB, search Ame-Comi with Other>Comics checked in the dropdown box, then click on 'Uploaded' to order by recent"
[T],MrDowntown,2013-03-19T23:51Z,Its blurry due to the fact that its an early leak by (scanbro). The official HQ scans will be out tomorrow. Thats also why I am waiting on SSM until tomorrow

The Hellblazer fan in me is annoyed. This is shit."
