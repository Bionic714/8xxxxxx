,jungcookie,2013-03-20T05:31Z,"OMG! You're soooo nice. I look everywhere for this one also, only dead torrents out there.
Thank you again and again:)"
,bing52,2013-03-20T18:37Z,RayCort...really appreciate the upload !  Thank you !
[T],RayCort,2013-03-20T21:07Z,"@luissa, I will try to cap it on Sat, but conflicts with Hallmark movie, so may cap it on Sunday if i can remember."
,luissa,2013-03-21T16:08Z,thank you RayCort!!!! 
,lucyfan98,2013-03-25T04:34Z,Thanks Ray! You rock as usual!!
,cindy25,2013-03-29T01:51Z,is everything ok?
[T],RayCort,2013-03-30T15:21Z,"@cindy25, Everything is okay. FYI, I will no longer be uploading Hallmark and Lifetime movies to TPB. Too much work, little appreciation, and just not worth it anymore."
,jungcookie,2013-03-30T16:29Z,"How sad:( But anyhow  thank you so much for all your hard work. 
HAPPY EASTER"
,cindy25,2013-04-01T09:23Z,"r u uploading anywhere else? just wondering, because unpoular group also dropping TPB "
[T],RayCort,2013-04-01T11:48Z,"No, just not doing uploading anymore period. FYI, you can get Dog with a Blog S01E11 on itunes. "
,cindy25,2013-04-02T04:30Z,"i do understand how much work it is, just caught us by surprise.

I found the 720 version of dog with a blog on tpb, 

http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8303306/Dog_With_a_Blog_S01E11_Stan-ing_Guard_FHD_1080p_Web-DL_Luciana_G


and converted it to the usual size. I then tried to make a torrent, but ended up just posting it on a warez site

itunes is pretty much useless outside the USA, as is netflix, Hulu and even the network sites.  "
,HEAVEN13TH,2013-04-05T18:11Z,"RayCourt you have no idea how much we all appreciate your movies. If you think there is no appreciation then you have no idea. I also upload movies on a daily basis and there's times I want to throw in the towel myself and think the same thing as you. It's like I've done all this work and I do it everyday and for what? Who cares? Well I was dead wrong as I have members that would be lost without alot of these hard to find movies that we post. Members that really, really do care and those are the ones I still post for all these years later. Regardless.
Please, please reconsider your decision. :)"
,addoct,2013-04-06T04:05Z,"Hi Ray just got back from holidays and read your comments your efforts are appreciated but for the vast majority of the people that visit this site thanks is not a word in their language which is not right.

I hope you reconsider 

Cheers Mate"
,cindy25,2013-04-07T02:47Z,"@HEAVEN13TH

,KESThai,2013-04-07T09:28Z,"Sad to see you go RayCort. Your uploads were always welcome and much appreciated.
"
,luissa,2013-04-08T06:40Z,"It's so sad knowing that you are not uploading any Lifetime torrent :( I am really really sad because of it, I don't know how you can think that no one appreciate it I really really do! I am so sad because You was the reason that each weekend I type Lifetime on TPB and there was you and your amazing and so much needed torrents, I live in Mx and is very difficult for me to get Lifetime movies here, because they aren't allowed here and you was the only user who can help me watch them like right away! I beg you please please we need you and your amazing torrents plz plz plz I don't know how to thank all of your help, do you need anything I can do for you so you can still help me? please! Im a LMN and Lifetime addicted! I really need your torrents please please please!"
,keithandrews,2013-04-09T04:35Z,Dear Ray can you please reconsider and upload hallmakr and lifetime movies please or can some one else upload them please I have not other way to get them I appreciated all your post please come back need you post asap thanks.
,librattus,2013-04-09T06:07Z,"Please Raycort don´t quite!!! We need you!!!

We are people from different countries, we are always waiting for your movies every week.

The movies that you upload are really difficult to find, is not possible to us to get lifetime or hallmark in our countries.

We beg you!!!! do not abandon us!!!
We know that the work that you are doing is difficult we appreciate alot the effort!!!!"
,bing52,2013-04-09T19:44Z,RayCort...I sincerely hope that you reconsider your decision.  I really do appreciate your uploads and know that I would be lost without them !
,DeansPalley,2013-04-09T21:34Z,"I'm with the rest of your fans RayCort.  Please reconsider.  Your work is,has, & would be appreciated.  All the best my friend!!"
[T],RayCort,2013-04-09T23:35Z,"To the select few who did manage to show appreciation for my work with a kind comment each time i shared a movie even though it was not the best quality, to you I say Thanks. Sorry to disappoint, but really I think I am done for good. I mentioned I am one guy and not a team, so monthly bandiwdth became too much for me, and read ISP are monitoring torrents being uploaded, so for me its not worth the risk anymore. "
,jungcookie,2013-04-10T03:16Z,Ray...I'm really sad to see you go but do understand. You will be missed terribly by all of us
,cindy25,2013-04-10T07:36Z,"there might be a way to supply the files, without you uploading the torrent yourself.  

check with Mr unpopular

this would minimize the time and still get the movies  up

I have noticed Dirty Teacher was released this way"
[T],RayCort,2013-04-10T19:58Z,"@Cindy25, Sorry to inform you, but I am done, and don't want to mess with all the hard work, only to get a Thank from a handful of faithful fans. It is no longer any fun doing it, Sorry."
,addoct,2013-04-11T10:37Z,"Ray I discovered your Files on another site which is now gone I would just like to say Thankyou for all your hard work it has been appreciated in this household for the last couple of years .

Sad to see you go but It is understandable.

Cheers Mate all the best for the future."
,luissa,2013-04-13T04:45Z,worth it trying to convince you! eyy at least can you upload once a while like maybe 1 torrent a month we would be glad :) ok I know you are going to say no anyway but we love you a lot raycort if i could help you to keep it here I would do it no matter what because you make us really happy with Lifetime's specially lol :) Thank you for you friendship and kind support to share us all those amazing torrents!
[T],RayCort,2013-04-14T17:45Z,"@luissa, Sorry I just don't want to do all the hard work anymore. It is no fun anymore, and my montly bandwidth is limited now. so I had to stop uploading torrents. Maybe sometime, i will reconsider, but not anytime soon."
,HEAVEN13TH,2013-04-14T21:35Z,"Well Ray you have read all these comments. If that isn't gratitude then I don't know what is. You wanted a thank you and you got more than that. I run my own site and I know what it's like when you think everyone is just a leecher and people don't care, but they do. We don't realize that alot of people are lost without us. Especially considering there's only a select few of us that specialize in Lifetime/Hallmark movies.

@cindy25 please leave me an email that I can get in touch with you. Thanks."
,cindy25,2013-04-15T19:09Z,"@ HEAVEN13TH

PM me on the SuprBay forum "
,luissa,2013-04-15T22:13Z,I'M sad because today I typed Lifetime on TPB Browser and there wasn't any new torrent from my dear friend RayCort :( #weneedraycort there's no one like you! I am tired of Mexican tv all those clowns and stupid soap operas :( we need Lifetime movies!!! :( My boyfriend and I were so bored this last weekend because there wasn't any Raycort new torrent :( just wanted to let you know that we missed your movies :( we need you :''''(
[T],MrUnpopular,2013-04-21T04:41Z,"If any of you live in the US, you can learn to cap and encode TV yourself and share it. Just a suggestion. Then you can cap Hallmark and Lifetime. :P"
,Erik_O,2013-04-22T23:45Z,very disappointing raycort become so lazy... we all appreciate your torrents and now you just stop? this sucks big time and i hope you change your mind because there is nowhere else to get these unless you live in the US. 
,addoct,2013-04-23T11:14Z,"At Erik_O Words fail me Ray Cort has become what "" lazy"" no wonder he has given up uiploading with comments like those.


"
[T],RayCort,2013-04-23T13:29Z,"@addoct, exactly why I stopped because of comments that I am ""Lazy"" is just another reason why I just don't want to share with idiots."
,bing52,2013-04-23T17:21Z,"I can't believe what I just read !  Human nature really puzzles me !  Instead of being grateful to RayCort for the uploads he has provided for us, he is being insulted.  This 100% lack of appreciation really bothers me !"
,Erik_O,2013-04-23T19:06Z,"ok sorry raycort... i didn't mean to insult you. i really appreciate all your uploads, but still hope you change your mind. maybe you can upload a movie once a month?"
,cindy25,2013-04-26T04:15Z,"really missed u yesterday. found Remember Sunday here http://thepiratebay.sx/search/remember%20sunday/0/99/0

but the size was huge, had to convert but the freemake handled it.

MrUnpopular: I think 95% of those who dl these, and also your uploads r from outside the USA.

I never dl what is on cable (Survivor, Amazing Race, most USA series) but am forced to dl Daily show, most British, and most TV movies "
[T],MrUnpopular,2013-04-27T03:15Z,"@Cindy yeah you're probably right

@Bing see my response on /torrent/8387267 about your Hallmark movie that you requested recently please, I wanna know if I should privately give you it or not since the quality came out awful :)"
,addoct,2013-04-27T11:24Z,@Cindy Thanks for the link and I agree with you that most hallmark and lifetime D/L are by non USA people as I am one of those peops 
,jungcookie,2013-04-28T09:56Z,@ cindy25 Thanks for the info. I really miss RayCort.
