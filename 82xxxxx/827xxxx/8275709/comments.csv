,vasav,2013-03-19T17:42Z,is it working..??
,szepiz,2013-03-19T17:51Z,"its bigger of course, cuz its a pc version, consoles have low res textures,effects,shadows, so everything is is worse, and the pc version has high resolution textures,effects and the other things"
,Defroes,2013-03-19T17:57Z,8.34GB? in skidrowgames it's 4.85GB o.O
,winterlastsforever,2013-03-19T18:36Z,seeed please
,nignug,2013-03-19T18:37Z,"For fucks sake people. The other torrents file sizes are exactly half of this one. Those guy chose to repack it before uploading it. They are the same game. And szepiz, tha fuck are you talking about?"
,moeburn1,2013-03-19T18:48Z,"@szepiz they are both PC versions... both the 4gb and the 8gb one.

It is likely that one is an uncompressed bin/cue and the other is a compressed ISO.  This happens all the time with releases."
,moeburn1,2013-03-19T18:48Z,"by the way, this game is terrible.  Do not download."
,ItchyLala,2013-03-19T18:59Z,"No, it's not because it's the PC version.

The original source of the cracked PC version is 4.5 gb.

I already have it. Just wondering why most on TPB are so much larger unless they just decompressed the original and uploaded that, which is a bit fucking stupid.

,Exavio,2013-03-19T20:28Z,Does anyone have he requirements for this game?
,mikeskin,2013-03-20T00:05Z,"Hey thanks for the download man, and you four thousand leechers can eat all eat one big giant dick. Been downloading since 0-0 seed/leech and I come back to 282/4685 wtf lol "
,jurioto,2013-03-20T00:31Z,seed plz !!
,piratewithalongpenis,2013-03-20T00:45Z,walking dead game?  FUCK YA
,mikeskin,2013-03-20T01:20Z,Yeah I'm way too excited to play this (even if its bad dont care) for it to be going this slow. and when everyone was in the download process I was getting an ok 2-3 hundred kb/s and then everyone finished and ran off with the damn thing so now I'm at...12...tha fuck lol
,hall15tc,2013-03-20T02:07Z,Yeah.... So they made another Walking dead game except this time it sucks. I can't believe all of you people are playing this crap. The show is good but you people who soak up every little shitty piece of walking dead bs are making it hard for average people to enjoy the show without feeling like giant tools. 
,mikeskin,2013-03-20T03:12Z,"Hall you're not a giant tool if you don't enjoy the game but you enjoy the show, not sure how one situation even relates to the other but whatever. However you are a giant tool when you speak as if your opinion is the only one that matters by saying you can't believe people are playing something that you determine as crap. If people like it because its connected to the walking dead then who cares, quit pissin on everyone's parade"
,chesco1414,2013-03-20T04:27Z,"hey, can someone help on how to save, it is not auto either I played for a while, close, re launch BOOM, everything gone, game save and settings..?"
,e8hffff,2013-03-20T04:42Z,Does it use .Net to install?
,undeadoptic,2013-03-20T17:05Z,can someone pleassee help!!!!!!! i was playing got really far then i exited and i went to go hit continue and it just brings me back to main menu nothing saved please help on how to fix..
,Gros_Shadok,2013-03-20T20:21Z,"For me it's not playable.
1) I don't have the audio for the dialogues (but I've got the other sounds)
2) It freezes at the end of the first mission, when you select which type of road you want to use

So it's may not be the best release to download... may be try a 4 Gb one (I don't know if they will work better but at least you won't have downloaded 8 Gb FOR NOTHING !)"
,TacoFire,2013-03-21T01:36Z,did not work for me I load up game and it freezes on loading screen
,chesco1414,2013-03-21T03:44Z,"Just to let everyone who havnt got this yet, this game does not save so you better spend your entire day playing."
,Aphotica,2013-03-22T00:40Z,This game seriously sucks.
