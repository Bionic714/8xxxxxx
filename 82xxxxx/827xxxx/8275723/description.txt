Townes was touring Europe with his family, 9 year old will and his pregnant wife Jeanene. He was in good shape and working on a year of sobriety. This is the only film footage of an entire Townes concert known to exist.


uploaders comments...
I converted this with autoGK from a DVD source. It is a concert film at a club, so don't expect a digital hollywood feature.

It is my favorite Townes piece of all of the Townes torrents I have uploaded.

I had to go to usenet to find the DVD source. enjoy!
