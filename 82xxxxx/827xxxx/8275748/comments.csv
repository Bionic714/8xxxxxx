,Violentos,2013-04-01T19:15Z,What does this fix? Is it too much to ask the uploader to tell us what the file actually DOES? That's what the description portion is meant for.
,peryko,2013-04-04T13:58Z,"Violentos, I thought it is clear enough in description.
These files are to fix the game and make it run on CFW 3.55 and 3.41 PS3's
Of course it is working mates.
