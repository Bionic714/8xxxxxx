[V],HeroMaster,2013-03-19T17:55Z,"@ALL This is RaR file which is unpacked thats why the file Size is small, Team RELOADED have packed their rar files with small margin."

,Viciously,2013-03-19T18:40Z,"@herofag

Go learn English and then come here to reply or better yet, stay on your own fucking torrents.

@all

Nearly all private tacker sites have this or as you say, 4gB version.

Only a fucking moron would download the unpacked 8gB version."
,ultraTREE,2013-03-19T18:43Z,Does this include DLC like the other ones uploaded? I don't mind either way just wanted to know.

,Gros_Shadok,2013-03-19T19:20Z,"If it's a game, why is there, amoung the files, one which is called ""Read this before playing this Video.txt"" ?
Isn't it strange ??? (is it a GAME or a VIDEO ?)"
,k3rc4,2013-03-19T19:54Z,"you people mind seeding, pls?

[V],scenetime55,2013-03-19T21:07Z,I'm up with 4 mb/s maybe others need to keepd seeding to
,severed1314,2013-03-19T22:22Z,wow...what a pile of shit. 
,Dunge,2013-03-19T22:41Z,Hahah wow for the rar to pack up to 50% the game data files are probably filled with zeros.
,Dunge,2013-03-19T22:42Z,"Saying that as the ""official game data"", nothing wrong with this torrent. Just precising in case someone misunderstood my comment."
,Bozzanac22,2013-03-19T23:09Z,"and where is the SAVE DATA LOCATION ???

,Flecks,2013-03-20T03:39Z,"I get absolutely no sounds when characters talk, I can hear everything else fine, all the sounds effect and shit, but there's no voice whatsoever. How can I get to hear the voices?"
,chesco1414,2013-03-20T04:15Z,"Anyone know how to save or how it saves and please dont say automatically, because I not only lost all the progress but setting like controls are gone when re launch as well WTF?!"

thats some amazing compression, or some really crappy lame txt like data files in this game...

oh well, just thoughts for food..
I'm going to get me a snack, later..... ;)"
,k3rc4,2013-03-20T04:54Z,"srsly, start seeding, people.
I've been dloading whole day with damn 10 kb/s, like a joke..."
,myoPNESS,2013-03-20T05:06Z,SEED YOU BITCHES....FKIN 30kb/sec....you LEECHING LAME SHITZ
,Seedicle,2013-03-20T05:33Z,Its because of all the dumbass leechers. Thats why its so slow.. I thought there was something that punished leechers but it doesnt seem like it does anygood. Fuck you leechers.
,Seedicle,2013-03-20T05:37Z,Set your download and upload to unlimited. Thats what I do. Having your upload on unlimited kinda makes it dl faster too. But its still slow because of all the leechers...
,Jartus21,2013-03-20T05:44Z,I keep getting an application error every time i try to launch the game. I'm fairly new at this so any help would be awesome! Thanks.
,adrian_pn,2013-03-20T10:58Z,need help! when i finish the 1st bit of the game and then starts the opening movie(similar to the series) it crashes almost at the end and i'm forced to close the game... anyone has this problem too?? what can i do resolve this problem?? any crackfix coming out????
,kill100030,2013-03-20T15:13Z,why do i get appId not configured?
,TruWING,2013-03-20T15:47Z,"So I guess this game absolutely sucks. Its just a money grab because of the popularity of the TV show. And those are NEVER good for games.

I will not download this. Check out gameplay videos before investing your time into this junk game.

This is about the game. NOT the uploader. Thank you for all that you do. Keep up the good work! You have my support!"
,mikeskin,2013-03-20T16:24Z,"WING, honestly I think most people know that lol, but I'm assuming most people are getting it for the same reason I am, who doesn't want to crossbow a zombie as daryl? (if you're a fan of the show of course lol) It's a shame to see this perpetuate the licensed game genre since only like...2 games have managed to escape that hell with a good product. But thanks to good people like this feller/lady we don't have to spend our hard earned money on said cash grab so the way I see it, it's only a waste of time if you watch the download bar the whole way lol Definitely hope I worded this right because I mean no disrespect to you and your opinion since you actually voiced yours without being an asshole like 99.9% of people on here."
,mikeskin,2013-03-20T16:31Z,"Also thank you scenetime for the torrent. Had to bail on the one I started yesterday because it basically got to a standstill at 70% at 3kb/s and I hadn't even seen the 4g torrent so I was stuck at 70 on the 8g and it was basically telling me 3 weeks lol

I have this one going about 3-6 hundred kb/s and if all goes well should be able to play in a few hours. So again many thanks"
,xxela,2013-03-20T19:11Z,Thanks it works just fine and is not such a bad game after all
,GreaterHarpy,2013-03-20T20:03Z,"I've been getting the ""Can't Mount W32ART.POD"" error everytime I run it. Any ideas?"
,chesco1414,2013-03-21T03:45Z,"Just to let everyone who havnt got this yet, this game does not save so you better spend your entire day playing"
,ltcomdata,2013-03-21T05:06Z,"Hey guys, here is how you fix the ""no sound"" issue and ""no save issue"" (found these fixes by trial and error and by searching trough other forums). If you want the game to save, just run it as ""administrator"", to have voices in the game, go to where you installed the game, open this file ""steam_rld.ini"" and change the last line from ""English"" to ""Dutch"", like this: Language=dutch"
,wizzhop,2013-03-21T05:09Z,"This game is pretty interesting, it's not visually amazing and the controls take a little getting used to. Reminds me -a bit- of the action adventure walking dead series which i loved. I think it saves by chapter so you have to reach the next area before quitting. 

Anyone having problems with crashes, i had the ""AppID is not configured"" error; i downloaded this crack: http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8275877/The_Walking_Dead_Survival_Instict_-_Crack_Only

ONLY copy over WalkingDead.exe and Steamclient.dll. I used the original steam_api.dll that comes with this download.

Hope this helps :)

Thanks @scenetime55"
,wizzhop,2013-03-21T05:14Z,so there's no confusion -  in the above post i meant the original steam_api.dll that INSTALLS with this download. NOT the one in the crack folder of the iso.
,FBIOBSERVER,2013-03-21T15:03Z,"hey ltcomdata,thanks for your help with the sound issues,now its working ;)"
,Halbech,2013-03-21T20:35Z,"People keep saying it doesn't save. Mine saved. I played for 4 hours yesterday, and just barley got back on. Everything is like I left it. SO they must not be doing something right. 10/10"
,Ob165ion,2013-03-22T05:02Z,"This installs the malware 'iehighutil.exe'. You can find it at ""C:Temporary"".

Some of you might have noticed your video card driver crashing over and over lately."
,HwRr1316,2013-03-23T01:27Z,"Works fine, thanks a lot.
Virus free of course and nice compression."
,RickyLoveU,2013-03-23T05:14Z,"Hm... The game works perfectly but the games haves alot of bugs and glitches and if someone could please fix the save game issue, that would be great. the game doesn't save, i like, played for 1-2 hours and searched the farmhouse and went to the camping mission and the game didn't save at all."
,Halbech,2013-03-23T13:23Z,"THERE ARE NO SAVE GAME ISSUES PEOPLE! Tell me what you are doing, because I beat the game 3 times now, and everything is the same. IT SAVES"
,MoLiXs,2013-03-23T19:09Z,I'm having a problem locating the crack can some one please help me find it?
