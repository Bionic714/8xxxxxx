Looking for season 2, starting from episode 1 - English subs.

Thankyou for the upload, however haven't seen episode 1 yet, so episode 9's way off."

does this help you? subtitles for all season 2 episodes! can you make it happen??"
,pussiecatt,2013-03-31T14:26Z,"Hi

A (crappy) solution:

Download the subtitles for hatufim individually (.srt).
Download the Season 2 torrents individually (.avi or whatever extension).
Rename BOTH files so they're exactly the same, leaving the extensions.
Open VLC.
Go to File ~ Advanced Open File.
Box opens ~ choose the movie file through the browse option ~ then tick checkbox next to 'load subtitle file' and then choose the subtitle file through the browse option just underneath.
You can then choose the size of the subtitles and position on screen as centre/left/right.

I have done this for S2E1. I can hear the audio and read the English subtitles. HOWEVER, as the Israeli and Spanish subs are hardcoded, the English ones go over it which obviously makes it HARD to read. As I said, a crappy solution. 

If anyone knows of a *simple and *free way to remove hardcoded subs, then please post here. The other option is if one of the uploaders such as TVIS would be kind enough to upload without the hardcoded Spanish subs - then there's only the Israeli subs... I am unaware of how else to get around it.

My 2 cents worth...

thanks"
,protokay,2013-04-12T12:48Z,"I have re-hardcoded these english subs onto the season 2 videos that previously had spanish subs. With a black letterbox covering the spanish ones, and yellow text so it stands out from the israeli subs. I don't know how to upload a torrent though (can't seed, probably because of my connection). Happy to send these to someone to uploaded and share, whole season is 1.9gb."

,cindy25,2013-06-02T04:44Z,"I don't think the subs are srt, but sub

I have tried them several times and despite renaming will no show on a usb

the best solution is for someone with Hulu USA to download season 2 there"
