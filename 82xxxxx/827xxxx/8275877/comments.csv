,GnarlyCharlieOx,2013-03-23T02:21Z,"Is there any way to fix the save problem? I noticed a lot of people have had the same problem. When I try to continue it says I have to start a new game to use the weapon pack. I haven't added anything since I started playing, already had the weapon pack the first time, people are saying it just doesn't save so idk. It'd be nice to be able to save though :/"
