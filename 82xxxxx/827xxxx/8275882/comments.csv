A suggestion, If I may?

Could you include the total bitrate on your file descriptions?

Sometimes your great work makes it possible to ""upgrade"" a movie I already have in my library, and I'm finally beginning to realize the relationship between bitrate and image on the screen. Because my viewing is done on a 135"" projector screen. this affect is greatly amplified.

Not a criticism. Your work is awesome and greatly appreciated. Just a suggestion.

Peace and Love."
