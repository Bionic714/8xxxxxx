,myoPNESS,2013-03-21T04:53Z,"okay ive commented twice on this torrent its a great upload, everything works fine (if your pc can handle it, which shoudlnt be a prob for most cuz the GFX seriously blow)...however besides the saves not working...ive seen so many people talking about how this is a shit game...i of course dont believe anything anyone says until i try it....but i must say this game really is VERY shitty...clunky controls...most of the areas you go to are exactly the same just slightly altered car positions...the lighting and graphics are something of the playstation 2 era...activision has literally ruined any hopes of getting a worthwhile game. I was hoping for kinda a FarCry 3 in the walking dead universe...and ive never been so let down in my life...played about a half hour and deleted it immediately...If you're not really caring about GFX or gameplay that keeps you wanting to press forward...then you may enjoy this...other than that this is going to be (mark my words) one of the worst games of 2013....thanks activision...you seriously ate a bowl of dicks on this one..."

,McMerda,2013-03-21T08:52Z,"3 problems:

1) the files in the CRACK folder have some kind of protection on them and windows explorer cannot move or copy them. (the game seems to work fine in spite of this)

2) crashes. there seems to be no definite trigger, but occasionally when hitting esc the game crashes.  

3) autosave. some have said that the game does not save at all, but mine does. the problem is that it doesnt save frequently enough. 

other than these issues, its a fine game. it really makes your hands shake for a while after playing, and it is a very realistic feel.

fix the crashes, it will be an awesome torrent."

I'm having the same issue only my game wont load. The crack folder is set to read only and wont let me change it. I even tried under the hidden admin account built in to Windows 7.

On the bright side this did download at 1.5 megabytes per second. Now if only I could play it.

On a side note, is registration disabled in the US? I've tried to register a million times and it never took. It would always say e-mail sent and I would never get it. That is until I logged in using a Canadian IP, then it worked fine first try. Same e-mail address and everything. "

3. Changing resolution seems to increase FPS, but in my monitor it tell me its 1080p, so I think it's not really changing the resolution. Or maybe just upscaling some resolution to 1080p.

I like the game though, the graphics arent great but the game is fun and a lot like the show. Idk why so many people are hating on it. Lots of weapons and a lot of different options in the story like choosing who follows you and what roads to take and stuff.

I'd give the game a 7.5 out of 10.

,SavingSanity,2013-03-28T07:19Z,"I don't understand anyone is bitching. Yes it has some flaws but seriously? Get over it. It was a slow download but that was my fault, i had to change my bittorrent. But after that i got around 1.9 MBs. I had no audio problems... So far. As for the crashes, it happened a lot. But the crashes rarely happened once i logged off the internet. The crashes only happened when i switched from game to desktop. "

,jjbbdlz,2013-03-28T23:52Z,"hi, the game works just fine except for the character's voices, is the only problem I have, I can't listen to their voices, and I don't know why. Is anyone experiencing the same problem or at least have a solution? thanks"
,jjbbdlz,2013-03-28T23:54Z,"Hi, the game is just fine, except for tiny problem, I can't hear their voices, I don't know why and I couldn't find an answer on the internet. If anyone has a solution or is experiencing the same problem please help me!"
,pogsi,2013-03-29T13:25Z,not so good game very rushed in the making. i wished they had at least bring justice to the tv series.
,pennknig,2013-03-30T19:22Z,"POORLY made game, its rushed, unpolished and only runs at 30 FPS,,,,,,
If I had paid for this shit, I'd be really pissed off with the quality of the game,,,everything, and I mean EVERYTHING feels like it was done by the company's interns.........

I'm glad I'm a Pirate,,,,,,"
,Cyber43,2013-03-31T09:17Z,Very sad that 1 of the best characters in The Walking Dead has to be in such a shitty game..
,TrelosGio,2013-03-31T13:19Z,"So, I managed to do the patch without the file requiring some special permission to be copied and started the game. Idk bout u guyz but i liked the whole thing and all(never watched any episodes of the AMC series) and i was particularly happy with the game.BUT when the time to load my saved game came, i had no saved game xD. So i guess the game didnt save the shit i'd been doing for 3 hours. I felt so fucked up and i deleted it immediately.Good torrent tho. Fix the save problem somehow? I suspect maybe it's that file from the crack i couldnt copy? Anyways that's all."

,DaZekeMan,2013-04-01T06:56Z,"extremezone has been uploading for a while, he/she would not intentionally upload a virus and ruin their reputation. I highly doubt there is a virus here but I'll scan and comment the results."
,maker087,2013-04-01T17:36Z,"if you have the ""msvcr100.dll"" error while launching, just instal VCRedist (Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package).
you can download it from Microsoft or search for it in C:Program Files (x86)The Walking Dead Survival Instinctredist.

INSTAL X86 version !!!!  it doesn't matter if you have x64 VCRedist... it will not run."

,tekcomputers73,2013-04-08T08:48Z,Reports of steam_api.dll being a trojan are a false positive being reported by people. MBAM identifies this file as being perfectly fine.

,pennknig,2013-04-13T23:50Z,"@ myrandomusername and various others.............
You are too stupid to be downloading software from the internet.
You're using up vital air that the sick and old people need,
Go kill yourself.

I'm 51 YO, and have a degree in computer engineering from the University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada, am Microsoft certified, have 7 other various degrees and accreditation.

This DL is fine....................

Fucking 14 YO noobs using Norton, just because it on mom and dad's PC.............."
,swello,2013-04-14T14:15Z,"Hey Guys,
First of all, this torrent works great, easy install, and yes, one of crack files, the steamapi.dll is a trojan for most anti virus but i guess that were wrong diagnostics. So, you a have a good pc you can run this max, all on max resolution. Ty for torrent once more extremezone.
BUT, about the game: Survival instinct actually suck, no fun at all playing it, looks like a middle age ps2 game with crappy interface and shitty game mechanics. Don't bother download it if youre not a fan of the tv show. The walking dead game episodes were a lot cool that this. :D
Don't forget too seed anyway 
Cumps eveyone"
,pennknig,2013-04-24T04:09Z,"@ swello

The only thing that might save this game is a few expansion packs, following the story.
Otherwise, ya, this game is quite crappy............"

,setsudan,2013-05-09T19:35Z,"@nordick What the fuck are you even talking about? You are the definition of a noob. 
1 - Uploaders can't delete comments, it's a bug.
2 - ALMOST EVERY SINGLE FUCKING CRACK uses code that is very similar to viruses, hence the FALSE POSITIVES. 
3 - What the fuck does freedom of speech have to do with piratebay? Are you fucking retarded? 
4 - All you people are a waste of space and precious oxygen. You should not be alive. Fucking rejects."

,pennknig,2013-06-03T02:58Z,"@ wennen

I got to the end, restarted with the crossbow and knife, stealthed my way through, finished the game.
Restarted with just the M16 and knife, blasted my way through, finished the game again.
I was going to do the game again with just the baseball bat and the knife, but I'm so thoroughly bored with it, I just cant bring myself to start it again.
The only thing that might save this game is a few expansion packs following the TV series.
IT INCLUDES KILLING CHILDREN AND BABIES AS WELL!
WTF, do the game developers think we're stupid or cant handle the thought / actions of killing a zombie child?
Don't they realize we saw the TV episode when Sophia got taken out?! (S02E08-Pretty Much Dead Already)
Seriously though, a Zombie Apocalypse without any zombie children or babies? What happened to them all, they evaporate?
I wanna Blast, Knife, Electrocute, Decapitate, Dismember, Shoot, Stab, Bludgeon, Fry, Burn, Torch, Run Over, Stomp On and generally cause Zombie Children to go SPLAT!
Throw in some Zombie Cats and Dogs as well!
Just think of the mayhem you could cause if you catapulted a bunch Zombie Cats into the enemy's encampment.
See, your liking it already......."
