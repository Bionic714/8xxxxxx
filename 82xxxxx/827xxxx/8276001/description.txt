This "laid back" LP has serendipitous roots.  Les McCann's plan was to 

introduce his discovery, organist "Groove Holmes" on a vocal album with himself

(McCann) as leader.  The last track (#8) IS a McCann vocal, but the balance is

a very "groovy" party atmosphere jam session with Ben Webster, a guitarist

and a trombone player.  Groove lays down all the bass with his Hammond;

a "3 series*" tonewheel organ (with Upper Keyboard percussion*,)except

track #8 which has traditional plucked "pizz" bass.  


It took a bit of listening to determine the spare use of a LESLIE speaker on 

these tracks, a "single speed model;" likely a 21H.  Groove's solo on #1

has no trem or vibrato...just straight, unmodulated Hammond.  "Two speed"

Leslies (at least the ones around in 1961, if any) are always spinning...either 

FAST (Tremolo) or SLOW (Celeste)  The rotor on Groove's cabinet is not turning

at all during his track #1 solo, so..I'm quite sure it is a Fast/Off "single

speed" Leslie.  It's also possible that Groove's rig employed a second cabinet

without any rotors and that he switched between the two to get the "straight"

sound.


Groove's unusual solo 5 minutes into track #4 (Deep Purple) is the sound of

upper keyboard percussion without any other footages added to it.  This

creates a very thin solo voice but a great player can pull it off as more 

than a novelty effect.



I love these things...... my excuse for spewing that second paragraph.
