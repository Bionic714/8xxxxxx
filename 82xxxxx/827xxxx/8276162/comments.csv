,Tallyortoby,2013-03-19T20:54Z,A thank you or comment would be appreciated
,lasiodora,2013-03-19T22:07Z,You just renamed mp4 to avi without converting to a codec that uses avi container.
,Tallyortoby,2013-03-20T01:17Z,@lasiodora: instead of bs read the file specs and u'll see that i converted the file to xvid u twat
,Tallyortoby,2013-03-20T01:35Z,I took a mp4 file and actually took the time to convert it with XviD codec to avi... no just renaming cuz mp4 renamed will not work as avi u n00b
,wfleisch,2013-03-20T14:49Z,since no one is saying thank you for the xvid file I WILL THANK YOU.
,nevyn68,2013-03-22T07:54Z,"I'm sorry but this version is no where near ettv's.
A:7
V:3

Jerky and blury."
,Tallyortoby,2013-03-22T14:02Z,"@nevyn68: I did my best with what I had and 48 hours before ettv. I actually took the AFG file when it finally came out. Nonetheless it's not as jerky and blurry as you pretend. Maybe you should stop jerking off onto your screen.
Next time: DO BETTER or STFU"
