"Jose Beausejour has a refreshing approach to remixing music. He 
takes tracks from sources such as Notorious BIG and Ennio Morricone 
and applies his own unique style to present them in a way that the 
original producers could not imagine.Do not think that he is just adding 
a bass line and some new mid-range beats. Consider if you will a 
haunting melody being played by the likes of Sepultura but with the 
original artists vocals. If you thought that Metallica's cover of 'Ecstasy 
of Gold' was good then you really need to hear his take on this track. 
Simply brilliant"
