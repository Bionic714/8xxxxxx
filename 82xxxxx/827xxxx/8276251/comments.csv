,Ryushin7,2013-04-10T15:43Z,"I know this torrent is large, but if possible, please seed for as long as you can.  I've noticed that once people have gotten the torrent they disconnect right away.  This really impacts the swarm for everyone else.  I spent so much time making this available for everyone, it would be nice to allow others to share in my enjoyment.  Thanks."

I will seed like crazy.  I have already up'd 60 gigs and will continue to seed for the next month.

Is there a reason that this torrent doesn't seem to have any seeders at all?  I haven't seen one time in the last week that there is even one seeder showing on the tracker.  Maybe that's my mistake somehow.  At any rate, I will carry on as  I complete the whole torrent."
