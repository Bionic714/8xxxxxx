,Tiageros,2013-03-19T20:06Z,"Unfortunately, it's not being seeded. I really hate it when someone posts a release and then doesn't seed it until it gets out on the network."

,bobbythejobby,2013-03-19T22:23Z,AVG says steam.api is a trojan horse removed it and will try using the update 11 steam.api
,bobbythejobby,2013-03-19T22:34Z,"no good deleteing my comments m8 steam,api is infected instead of trying to hide it by deleting comments you should offer a solution or confirm wether the file is infected or not"
,ronza149,2013-03-19T22:35Z,"finally,with legendary settings I have reasons to play Skyrim all day once again!:D"
,Odjebiteus,2013-03-19T23:50Z,"@bobbythejobby
The download is secure, free of viruses and malware etc.. 
the fact that it reports to you as a virus is because some files/cracks use simmilar code .
In other words 98% of cracks your beloved AVG will report as virus and delete it immediately. :)

have fun cracking ^^"
,dansko2,2013-03-20T00:33Z,is steam.api really infected or just a false positive? or it isn't infected at all?
,bruno1988,2013-03-20T00:57Z,"This steam_api.dll is NOT a virus, you can exclude it in your anti-virus program."
,rxanp,2013-03-20T01:32Z,"there is no virus here... This upload is absolutely clean...
As for the update, it works perfectly fine, been playing for the last 3 hours... now all my expert level lockpicking isn't in vain and the dragonborn expansion has plenty of dungeons and caves...
have fun people, and again... this is completely clean..."
,ANIMOSITY74,2013-03-20T02:31Z,"well, I was reserved about downloading this due to the comments. then eset picked up the steam api file as a virus (but it did with an older one too - and the same named file on other games) so I tried it out in a sandbox. Works great. with SKSE and a bunch of mods depending on them being the right files... this is a good torrent, in fact the only one on TPB that i have seen by a trusted member."
[M],Hero,2013-03-20T03:10Z,bobbythejobby: uploaders can't delete comments.
,vokvok333,2013-03-20T04:42Z,any news on the 1.9.32.0. release??
,bobbythejobby,2013-03-20T11:26Z,Thanks for confirming this Odjebitus and sorry m8 seems my comment was not deleted but it was not visible yesterday for some odd reason just installed this update and its working like a charm thank you 
,crazyegg123,2013-03-20T12:18Z,Do i need previous update ? plz respond :
,Karlston,2013-03-20T21:32Z,"@crazyegg123
The updates are getting steadily larger. That's a good sign that each update is cumulative.  That is, each update also contains all previous updates, so no, you don't need to apply all previous updates, just the latest."
,crazyegg123,2013-03-21T01:04Z,@Karlston thank you.
,bhangs,2013-03-21T04:08Z,"MSE says

The.Elder.Scrolls.V.Skyrim.Update.12-RELOADEDCracksteam_api.dll

VirTool:Win32/Obfuscator.XZ

install or not?"
,coltraz,2013-03-21T05:19Z," I'm getting ""Please Update to the Latest Version of Skyrim"" every time I try to launch the game now. "
,Ign0tus,2013-03-21T05:43Z,"I don't typically download torrents anymore because I'm paranoid of being monitored here in the US now.. However, I did download this update 12 elsewhere. The steam_api.dll that comes with this update is the same dll that I already had, modified 1/31/12, so I just used the one I already had and it worked fine. You can try that if you are paranoid about it being a virus.

I too was/am getting ""update to the latest version of Skyrim"" every time I try to launch it. I suspect this is SKSE (script extender) that is causing it. UESP says that the 1.9.32 patch is a BETA patch on Steam. According to UESP, 1.9.29.0.8 was released to ALL users on March 18, so it is apparently the ""latest"" non beta version. However, the latest SKSE I downloaded says it supports 1.9.32. So either 1.9.32 is not in beta and UESP is wrong/not updated, or the SKSE people, stupidly imo, have SKSE set to detect 1.9.32 as the latest version even though it's still in beta. Some people don't want to run a beta patch. I downloaded the previous SKSE 1.06.11 from their page under ""archived builds"" and it launches fine. I'm going to look around to try to figure out if 1.9.32 is in fact beta or not. Regardless, I don't see 1.9.32 available in cracked form anywhere yet."
,Ign0tus,2013-03-21T06:02Z,"Just read on Steam forum that 1.9.32 is a live patch, not beta anymore. It wasn't an official post, but it's probably right. So if you are using this update in this torrent, 1.9.29.0.8 then try using SKSE 1.06.11 from the SKSE archived builds. That worked for me. The latest SKSE is for the official 1.9.32 patch, which isn't available in cracked form yet afaik."
,JustinJNB,2013-03-21T06:13Z,"@Ign0tus

Why does the steam_api.dll detect as a virus?

I downloaded it and everything works fine though."
,poupipoupipou,2013-03-21T13:59Z,Can someone get access to the legendary difficulty? It's updated to the 1.9.29.08 but nothing else than master...

there is legendary in both option diffeculty and skills"
,poupipoupipou,2013-03-21T15:09Z,"mmm i must have done something wrong, the update is done but nothing new in the options, even without skse..."
,DPerete,2013-03-21T15:13Z,"Need 1.9.32.0, any news about that??
Can't use SKSE with this version."
,DPerete,2013-03-21T15:16Z,"Actually the ""Archived builds"" of the SKSE has version ""1.06.11"", it works with Skyrim 1.9.29, this one. "
,dullboy88,2013-03-21T15:58Z,anyone not able to select legendary difficulty just change it in the .ini file and it'll work when you load your game. if you dont know its in my documents/my games/skyrim/syrimpref.ini... this worked for me
,dullboy88,2013-03-21T15:59Z,difficulty=5 in the gameplay section
,poupipoupipou,2013-03-21T17:55Z,thanks for the tip dullboy
