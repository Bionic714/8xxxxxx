,rosso99,2013-03-22T06:22Z,"Guys... I just listen a couple of times now , and... best work since Ultra. Really great."
,fall1en,2013-03-22T06:40Z,"I'm listening to this on iTunes for free at the moment. Have only heard the first three or four songs, but so far I don't mind it at all. 

It amuses me when people call something crap, because it's not to their taste. 

I'll be downloading this for sure, based on what I've heard so far. 

Thanks V3nom!
