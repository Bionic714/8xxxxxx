Any ideas?"
,Koca114,2013-03-20T01:17Z,Thanks a lot
,alex32571,2013-03-20T01:20Z,"@catkind, really? This game looks like a 2002 game and runs that badly? shit..."
,theshop,2013-03-20T03:10Z,"what does ""unused game titles from consoles"" mean?  "
,a490920,2013-03-20T06:31Z,"did anyone had problem with the graphic??i see grass everywhere in my game,even inside the room where he punch the mirror."
,karkar88,2013-03-20T09:59Z,"yeah what are the"" Remove unused game titles from consoles"" give us some idea please "
,hitmanino,2013-03-20T14:32Z,"Thx HeroMaster nice size.but i'm having soud issues,i can't hear when people are talking in game.."
,JeanEmmanuel,2013-03-20T17:05Z,"Me neither, if someone has the solution for the voices please tell us."
,Redante,2013-03-20T18:28Z,"""unused game titles from consoles"" means there were 4 almost identical video files with endgame credits for each console (425 Mb each). They were deleted.
As for the voices - you can open steam_rld.ini and change the last line to Language=russian. English voices will appear, but all the text will become in Russian :("
,goranbad,2013-03-20T18:34Z,steam_api.dll missing
,FatBoxx,2013-03-20T19:29Z,"It's probably a false negative but AVG does detect steam_api.dll as a trojan horse, just a heads up. I've downloaded other torrents from this uploader before with no problems so I chose to ignore it and it's playing fine."
,smoothingchupachup,2013-03-20T20:24Z,keep getting 0xc0000022 error when i try to launch the game.
,JeanEmmanuel,2013-03-20T20:29Z,"When I try to save the changes in the steam rld file, it says ""access denied"", how do I fix that ?
(thanks for helping btw)"
,winshot,2013-03-20T20:35Z,Any way to fix the crashes during gameplay? Damn thing crashes every now and then.... Sad thing is after it crashes you have to play that particular mission from the beginning... What a pain in the ass... Damn !
,JeanEmmanuel,2013-03-20T22:15Z,"Haha I tried to type ""french"" in steam_rld.ini for fun and ... it worked !

I have voices in english and text in french, good for me i'm french, thank you Redante for the tip !"
,auximenes,2013-03-21T09:16Z,"Game installs and plays perfectly. Additionally the game engine scales well so you can play it on many setups. An another note, mrGREEK360 deserves a permaIPhellban."
,auximenes,2013-03-21T11:35Z,The console credits video files weren't ripped from this repack even though they say they were. Regardless this game fucking pisses me off -- it crashes constantly if you use your inventory/ESC menu.
,Redante,2013-03-21T16:53Z,"JeanEmmanuel
Good for you. But I found a way to keep English voice and text. You just have to set Language=dutch in steam_rld.ini.

auximenes
The console credits video files were ripped. Just try to think a little. "
,winshot,2013-03-21T17:24Z,"For the crashes set your video options to low or ""off"" in every section and set the resolution to 1600*900 even though you have a good rig... There will be no difference in the graphics whatsoever.... This worked for me without any crashes to desktop....  Finally after completing the game, this is the worst game ever. Hope it helps."
,faacto99,2013-03-22T02:59Z,Steam_api.dll is missing
,NikolaTesla1,2013-03-23T13:58Z,"For crashing you can find fix on this link:
