,chastro,2013-03-24T02:01Z,"lboy88/You need reg.exe to update new install location in your registry. Then the game will work perfectly with the DLC contents.(You'll see the red nosteam text in the loading screen then the dragonborn quest npcs will visit you to trigger the missions.) If you don't update the registry and if you had skyrim installed else where, old skyrim will be launched by the launcher regardless of launchers location."
,chastro,2013-03-24T12:20Z,DudeWithSwag/Thats directx error. Install the latest version.

,kidxlcor,2013-04-01T05:08Z,"Made an account just to say this torrent worked perfectly. Only took about a day to download, followed the instructions which were pretty simple; no mounting or burning or moving cracks or any of that; just a simple .exe and it worked like a charm. All the dlc and highrestexturepacks show up, and the game runs without any flaw. Great job with this one nosTeam! I will keep this one seeding."

,zeca.pt,2013-04-04T22:58Z,"if your antivirus insta kill steam_dll  or sth like that, try to: 
-make an exception for that file; 
-change antivirus option so it asks you what to do when it detects an alert (it worked for me);
- ? unninstal your antivirus :p

even if you alt+ctrl+del and terminate the process, its possible that antivirus program can still detect and delete the file you need, dunno why... you need to find a way to make an exception or make it ask you what to do"

,bonethugnharmony,2013-04-11T19:36Z,"@^^nosTeam^^, your torrents have gone to shit bro. They are twice the fucking size of Razor911´s, and all re-packs, even with the DLC´s dude. Your torrents have gone to shit and the download speed is crap now. That´s too bad, you used to be pretty good and I could always blind download your games. I have them all except for a couple. The older ones are fine..but, I don´t like the fact all your new games take forever and a fucking day to download now. WTF. I end up going with re-packs and Razor911 or others. I am 4 hours from this game now with Razor911. I waited on you bro i´d be waiting 3 fucking days. WTF. Peace. "
,bonethugnharmony,2013-04-11T19:41Z,"Forget this one people, download speed is shit. no seeds and the seeds that are active become impeded. This 10GB makes no sense, even if it comes with the DLCs. I got the texture pack and the game and dlc´s for same space. Razor911 5.12GB and Texture Pack 3.15GB, with DLC´s. Same size as this, but more bang for your buck !!!!!!!"

,apocalypticanomaly,2013-05-04T21:30Z,"HOW TO FIX YOUR GAME PROBLEMS:

first, be sure that your steam_api.dll is an exception with your antivirus or it will be blocked/removed. 

second, be sure you run as administer for the install and launch.

and third, the largest problem i have seen from many with the game not launching, follow this:

open Run, type in regedit, open HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE and then SOFTWARE, if your 32 bit, then i believe you will see a bethesda folder there, delete it. if you do not see that folder under SOFTWARE, then open the folder WOW6432NODE and you should find the folder there. DELETE that folder, go to your game directory and run as admin the exe that says Enable_data. Then you just run the launcher and click install and you should be good to go."
,apocalypticanomaly,2013-05-04T21:32Z,"If you do not see the DLC in data files, or the launcher will not launch the game and just keeps reloading the launcher, FOLLOW THIS:

open Run, type in regedit, open HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE and then SOFTWARE, if your 32 bit, then i believe you will see a bethesda folder there, delete it. if you do not see that folder under SOFTWARE, then open the folder WOW6432NODE and you should find the folder there.
