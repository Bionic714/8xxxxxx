,SkeelZ91,2013-03-29T23:38Z,"works wonders! question though, will google play find out that you're hacking the game?.. 
I'm a bit scared I'll get a bill within a few days lol"
,Chaos5364,2013-04-01T18:22Z,"this game saves online. you can actually use this mod, play and buy whatever your inner gamer desires and then uninstall and install the regular app from google play and you will keep all you bought and built.

Google will never find out xD"
,seevee1969,2013-04-13T06:54Z,"Game is now updated to 4.2 by publishers, this no longer works (tries to update & kicks you out)"
