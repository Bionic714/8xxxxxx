,BruceWayneJr,2013-03-19T22:02Z,Didn't mind paying for this one. 
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-19T22:09Z,why not? 'cause i just looked and every issue's on here and there are at least 11 seeders for every issue.
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-19T22:13Z,"^^^ that was directed to deepak_rokz.

BruceWayneJr, i wholeheartedly agree. vaughan and martin are awesome (did you guys see his variant cover for nova #1?), and this is worth at least as much as the .99 cent DC digital weekly titles. it might be argued that this is worth more than some $3.99 print titles coming out tomorrow. i hope they profit.

,n3wtrin0,2013-03-20T02:54Z,"Thanks for uploading! After reading the book, I get the irony that they offered this as online only. So I decided to pay for it. You also get the chance to be printed in the 'Letters' section.
But they wanted my name, address, even my phone number just to pay for a comic book. Considering the themes of the book I found that a bit dodgy!"
,n3wtrin0,2013-03-20T03:02Z,">tfw yr fave comic writer releases new book
>tfw its digital/internet only release
>tfw its already on TPB
>tfw the book is about a future with no internet/privacy/identity
>tfw when u should've paid for it
>tfw you try to pay and the paypal paywall wants to know your name, home address, phone number,email and everything just to buy a fucking comic book, like your credit card details weren't enough
>tfw you realise the writer is trolling u hard core"
