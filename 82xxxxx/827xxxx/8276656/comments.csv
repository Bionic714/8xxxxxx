,WasAtWoodstock,2013-03-19T22:06Z,This is not an artist that I'm interested in. Too recent. But I am impressed with your scanning all the art. For some reason recent releases very rarely include art. Is it because the uploader is in such a rush to be first that they don't have time to scan?
[T],rjordan21,2013-03-19T22:56Z,thanks.....
,piratebuddha,2013-03-20T00:12Z,"@WasAtWoodstock Thanks. I can't speak for others but I try to scan the artwork If it's a CD I own, and specially if it's an artist on a major record label, cause fuck the RIAA. If it's an indie band than I just upload the music and hope people will actually support that artist and buy the album.
This I scanned because the album is exclusive to Target and not everyone has access to a Target so I wanted to make it a complete package for the die hard JT fans."
,kasterion,2013-03-20T01:06Z,"Nice, dude. I'm not a big fan of pop music, but my wife is."
,lcrooks,2013-03-20T02:11Z,thanks so much! you clearly demand high quality in your music!
,mematey,2013-03-20T03:53Z,"piratebuddha
This isn't for me, it's for my sister-in-law. She loves JT. I can leave it. 
So thanks for this great upload. My SIL will love it.

@WasAtWoodstock
you had some pretty great uploads yourself over at the D.  Nice to see your nick, and to see you're still around.  :)"
,WasAtWoodstock,2013-03-20T04:36Z,"@mematey. Under this ID I upped 522 torrents there. I am still seeding them, plus some others upped under other IDs. Unfortunately, with the D's tracker down, I can only get takers through peer-to-peer, and that isn't many. If I'm not downloading something here, then no peer-to-peer, and all the D's torrents are silent.

If their tracker comes back up, they will all spring back to life."
,piratebuddha,2013-03-20T12:32Z,"@lcrooks Most definitely! I believe that compressing music to shittly, lossy quality like mp3 is an absolute insult to the artist. "
,Euraw1242,2013-03-20T16:48Z,"Thanks man. If the album is hot, I'm gonna but it."
,vikas_1912,2013-03-20T20:03Z,"I have a humble request can u pls upload this in ALAC(apple lossless) format i cud not find it anywhere. Converting flac to alac will loose quality.
thank you"
,vikas_1912,2013-03-20T20:06Z,"can u upload in alac pls thank you,...."
,piratebuddha,2013-03-20T21:51Z,"@vikas_1912 I'm sorry but I do not use, or endorse the use of, Apple products. 
However, it is VERY easy to convert FLAC to ALAC, mp3, or any other audio format you prefer. There are countless free programs (and many pirated ones) which will do the job."
,WasAtWoodstock,2013-03-20T22:19Z,There is NO loss in quality converting lossless FLAC to lossless ALAC.
,vikas_1912,2013-03-21T03:49Z,thank you for reply and upload...
,nikkurubio,2013-03-21T13:28Z,Thank You for the quality upload piratebuddha!
,piratebuddha,2013-03-22T03:10Z,"Holy shit. 609 seeders, the second highest seeded FLAC torrent on TPB! When do I get my skull? ;)"
,MrPink77,2013-03-22T17:50Z,Thank you!
,eduardomurilo89,2013-03-23T00:38Z,Thanks! But where's the CUE Sheet? I'd love that!
,furthur11,2013-03-23T01:32Z,"Thank You for the up, Gawd I can't believe i'm downloading this. what my woman makes me do :)"
,piratebuddha,2013-03-23T12:54Z,"Guys, it's okay to like Timberlake. 
Sure, the music is cheesy, but the guy can sing his ass off, and he doesn't seem to take himself too seriously, especially if you watch him on SNL or Jimmy Fallon.
This is just my opinion, of course, but I don't think he's so bad."
,aldurbano,2013-03-23T19:24Z,Thanks!
,hardpedro,2013-03-23T22:02Z,"Tracks 9 and 12 ARE NOT lossless! I tried it now on AudioChecker! Why did you do this, piratebuddha?"
,piratebuddha,2013-03-24T00:53Z,"I ripped this album myself, the tracks are ALL lossless, but here is an issue with this album and audiochecker, for some reason it has been giving false negatives. You can read more on that here: https://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8252289/Justin_Timberlake_-_The_20_20_Experience_%5BDeluxe_Edition%5D_FLAC_2

It's not the rip, but there is something with the recording or mastering on the actual CD that throws audiochecker of. "
,WasAtWoodstock,2013-03-26T05:30Z,"""609 seeders"" And all of them that are in the US, and are using one of the ISPs participating in the ""six strikes"" copyright alert system, and not using a VPN, will be getting a notice. The system went live last month. They are focusing on new releases and future releases. Stay tuned by following http://torrentfreak.com/."
,piratebuddha,2013-03-27T23:50Z,"I highly recommend that any of you who liked this album check out the FLAC vinyl rip that @24.96 just uoloaded: https://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8305166/Justin_Timberlake_-_The_20_20_Experience_%5B24_bit_FLAC%5D_vinyl 
It sounds absolutely incredible. "
,Noplaying,2013-03-29T20:44Z,"Firstly, Thanks for the awesome upload.
Second, is there any chance you can get a hold of Justified? There are some classics on there, Cry me a River, Senorita for instance, Thanks again!"
,piratebuddha,2013-03-30T13:05Z,"@Noplaying I have Justified, I'll try to upload it tonight, or at least by the end of the weekend. I'll post a link to it here when It's up."
,Tylersays,2013-04-07T06:24Z,"@piratebuddha - Thanks for the most impressive music download I've gotten in quite a while! Cheers!
Also - I fully support, and join in you obvious disdain of Apple products.
They are an abomination on the music loving peoples of the world. It's the worst music ""simulation"" available in the world. 
And people eat that shit up!

Finally, strangely enough I agree with you on JT. I think. 
Of course I don't ""like"" his music, but I do find myself, much like Navin Johnson, subconsciously toe-tapping and snapping my fingers. 
And as a comedic actor, he's top notch. A real surprise.

Anyway - Thanks! "
,Imashime,2013-05-09T16:25Z,"@piratebuddha —THank You! This Album is really something, JT has done a fine job! Thank you for making is possible to enjoy his music... "
