,btsobo,2013-03-23T21:08Z,"@witttte Why you guys want something to be exhanged for your podcasts, instead of just putting them here? Wouldn't it be simpler to give the podcasts for free to wider publicity? Isn't it the IDEA of this site? Think about it."

,cerebro13,2013-03-27T00:51Z,"Alright I made an account just for this to help you guys SO FUCKING LISTEN UP.

There is a fucking easy way to get around the Project GO site YOU NEED AN EXISTING unsubscribed account, I haven't paid for about 2-3 months now and its working fine, its so fucking easy, just use the NoRedirect plugin on firefrox and add the following entry
^http://(?:[^/]+.)?simplepickup.com

This turns off the redirecting on Project GO so you wont redirect to the shitty sign up for project go page.

Here is the steps.

Download and install the NoRedirect plugin for FF, restart FF.

go to tool and NoRedirect.

click ADD on the right,

paste in this ^http://(?:[^/]+.)?simplepickup.com

tick source.

move  it to the top by clicking MOVE UP.

click OK.

go and log into your unsubscribed Project GO account.

click on any of videos, podcasts or any PG content.

then enjoy!
