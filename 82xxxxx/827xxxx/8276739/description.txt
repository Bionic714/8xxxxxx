I've wanted to see this movie again for years but was unable to find a torrent anywhere. In the end I simply bought the DVD and ripped it.

Please seed! I'm on a slow rural connection and need help to keep the torrent alive. As far as I know this is the only ripped copy in existence.

The DVD was a digitally remastered copy, although the film is shot on 1971 film stock so the quality will match that.
