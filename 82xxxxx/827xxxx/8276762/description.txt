This fills a request for BringThatBooty. I gathered most of these from 2 older compilations here on TPB, and then collected a lot of comics to finish it. I think I've managed to get every issue of Thunderbolts, "Fightbolts" (damn you, Arcudi!), Avengers/Thunderbolts, New Thunderbolts, Thunderbolts (the 2nd time - I choose not to call it volume 2), Dark Avengers volume 2, and "Marvel NOW" Thunderbolts (volume 2 or 3, I say 2).

The last two, of course, are currently ongoing. Unless they cancelled Dark Avengers while I was typing this.

I've thrown in every miniseries and spinoff I could find, and I'm not going to list them all. This torrent has the Annuals, #-1, #0 from Wizard, the Avengers volume 3 crossovers, and even a couple of uncensored art pages!

All credit goes to the original scanners -- including Zone-Empire, GreenGiant-DCP, Megan-Empire -- and original uploaders.

This was a labor of love. I was one of the people lucky enough to buy -- as they came out -- the team's first appearance in Incredible Hulk, the Tales of the Marvel Universe special, and then T-bolts #1. I was floored. I expected something good from Busiek & Bagley, but wow.

Looking at the entire run, I can honestly say this is one of the books from Marvel's last 20 years that has re-invented itself over and over, yet has only once or twice been bad (damn you, Arcudi!)

Busiek & Bagley, Nicieza & Zircher, Nicieza & Grummett, Ellis & Deodato, Parker & Walker, and now Way & Dillon... and each of those "eras" for the title have been good in different ways!

I am not going to describe what this title was/is about, because maybe someone out there will get that same jolt (pun intended) that I got back in the 1990s... justice, like lightning!

... please seed and share!
