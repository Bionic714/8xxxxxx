A Resurrection is the story of a down to earth high school
psychologist who tries to help a mentally ill student who
actually believes his brother is returning from the grave
for revenge on the students who killed him. Heâ™s a tough
egg to crack and as he slowly feeds her clues into his
brotherâ™s mysterious death, she has her sheriffâ™s deputy
fiancé verify the less than believable and vague information.
And before she can get his mind right, she unwittingly falls
into his plot to keep her and the other students locked in
the school until his brother can arrive at six along with
the evil spirit that now inhabits him, keeping him alive
until he can take his six souls and leave him whole again.
