Notes From Munckmusic.com: 

Regrettably, Gregg Allman had to skip this final Beacon show of 2012 due to a herniated disc that made it too painful for him to tickle the ivories. 
Frequent guest artist Bruce Katz stepped up on the keyboard and the 3 1/2 hour closing performance took off. 
A slew of guests sat in (John Popper, Junior Mack, Col. Bruce Hampton, Berry Oakley Jr. and many more) making this quite one for the history books. 
A speedy recovery to Gregg from all of us at MunckMix !!
