,almasyseifer,2013-03-20T00:20Z,thanks again for this. it's the first time the download is low thought 0.1kb/s people are not seeding once finished anyways i'll be seeding full speed till the next update.
,almasyseifer,2013-03-20T00:22Z,i also noticed this version is twice the size of the others is there anything particular about it or is it just not zipped?
,almasyseifer,2013-03-20T00:26Z,stuck at 93.2%
,almasyseifer,2013-03-20T00:42Z,99.8% stuck again
,Ziggy2by2,2013-03-20T00:46Z,"The reason it is larger is because it is being Uploaded through a new program I tried. Simply place all the files into one folder. Call it ZygorguidesViewer, and then place that into your Wow/ Interface / Addons folder :)"
,aposhig,2013-03-20T01:21Z,Ziggy are you going to post manaview tycoon please?
