Wow....consistently pulling over 10mbps from my seedbox.  You might want to check your connection or move up from a dial-up connection.  But if you don;t want to wait, feel free to buy a copy. :-)"
,letslovelikejesus,2013-04-12T04:28Z,"Thanks alot! Really good found footage movie, but the question here is... is it really a movie? I usually check the casting of each found footage movie just for fun hoping one day i will find one without any casting at all so it could be a real found footage. The thing is after this movie they didn't show casting and i can't find casting/crew for this ""movie"" anywhere, not even on imdb or wikipedia wich always have castings.. all i could find was the producer, writer and the guy who edited the footage. So could this footage be real? I'm not asking for a ""oh come on"", im asking for the real names of the characters in this movie to disprove this! :)"
