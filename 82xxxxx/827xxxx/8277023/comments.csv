,lky001,2013-03-20T22:59Z,"I totally agree with what has been said above. I can add more though. I've been a Sirius subscriber since 2005 but I canceled my sub last year when I found out Wush's uploads. Purely by accident. I've been downloading them ever since. As I said it many times already, he makes Stern show listenable. Before I'd be listening to the live stream in my car using crappy Sirius radio and miss most of the show because of all their fucking commercials, news, live reads and other shit. Now with Wush's edits I can put it on my smartphone and listen uninterrupted wherever I am. I can also fast forward right thru all the BS that I don't care about ... Haha. Brilliant! Thanks a ton, man!"

,Phillyjustice11,2013-03-22T15:30Z,Yes the Drops Special would be great. and Also can i get a link to your website please I will donate I hear you have HSTV thanks Wush!
