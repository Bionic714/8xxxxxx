,super777,2013-04-13T18:32Z,"@JayCapo - yes it works 100% - this is the old version of cubase le... that is based on the engine of cubase sx... basically the free version of cubase sx...  it will even work on osx panther, but there is a problem with the installer which prevents it from isntalling correctly.. i'm trying to track down a v1.07 cd of cubase le, because that version works on panther (10.3) and jaguar(10.2).. the only difference is the actual installer script.."
