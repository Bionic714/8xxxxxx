,misterburnz,2013-03-20T05:29Z,"straight up,

there is a reason this torrent has 10 seeders.

IT IS COMPLETE GARBAGE. The mechanics are awful, it will literally throw you in a world that immitates dead island, all the while you will be wishing you were actually playing Dead Island.

Small example. When you press the trigger to swing a weapon, typically there will be at minimum 2-20 different animations for swinging along with different styles/directions you may want. This game has literally ONE, yes #1, and ONE only animation for every single weapon. You find yourself constantly clicking the same button the 7-8 times it takes to kill a zombie, all the while watching your character hit them in the same spot, the same way, every fucking time. It is so boring and repetitive you will never want to get passed the first few chapters. 

Don't believe me, go watch IGN's gameplay videos on the frontpage. Laughable."

,dls1951,2013-03-20T15:19Z,"Game is total shit, complete waste of time."
,deni93,2013-03-20T21:28Z,"I just repair the problem. Playing the game without any problem. Game is complete shit! Dont download waste of time. Activation shame on you, you just tryed to make easy money. Only good thing is that actors are form series (Daryl and Merle). But everything else sucs graphic is pretty bad for todays standard game look like it's made in 2005. Gameplay is bullshiiit. You have to kick walker in head 3-4 times to kill him instead of killing him with one blow. This makes game so boring and annoying. It will be fun first 15 min but later it will be nightmare. And what's the point of cold weapons like bat, knife hammer etc. when they have same damage???? I expected so much more from this game and Activation even hardcore fans will be furios and angry. DONT DOWNLOAD IT'S NOT WORTH YOUR TIME AND SPACE ON YOUR HDD !!!!!"
,TacoFire,2013-03-28T02:26Z,deni93 how do you fix Appid? sure game is crap but it's at least free on this site and some people would like to know how crappy the game really is
