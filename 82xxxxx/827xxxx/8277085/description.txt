 After losing contact with his explorer friend Virgi,  our  fearless  alien

 scattered across forests, throughout ponds and in dark caves. Spidy  finds
 himself alone on an alien world and faces the epic challenge  of  tracking
 down Virgi, battling strange new enemies and finding  the  missing  pieces
