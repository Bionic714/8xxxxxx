Introductions to Traditional Astrology: Abu Ma'shar & al-Qabisi
Format:PDF

Introductions to Traditional Astrology is a joint translation of two classic medieval works: Abu Ma'shar's Abbreviation of the Introduction to Astrology, and al-Qabisi's Introduction to Astrology. It also includes numerous passages from Abu Ma'shar's Great Introduction (never before published in English), and other medieval astrologers on how to interpret traditional concepts: quadruplicities, dignities, relationships to the Sun, and planetary configurations. It includes lengthy accounts of planetary natures and conditions, longevity techniques, a review of predictive techniques, and valuable aids to students: a complete Glossary, description of primary directions, organization of Lots and planetary configurations, and the relationship to concepts in Antiochus and Porphyry.
