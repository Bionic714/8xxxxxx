,ziuber18,2013-03-27T00:47Z,"the installers should work just fine. If not you may try to install updates from backup folders - in this case you need to follow the instructions of the second part of the description.

If the installers can't retrieve version info then try reinstalling the game or try adding these reg keys:
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREWow6432NodeMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionUninstall{9D15E813-0C26-41E7-ABC5-3EB06FF1B3CF}]
""DisplayName""=""Assassin's Creed(R) III v1.01""
""DisplayVersion""=""1.01""
""Version""=dword:01010000
""MajorVersion""=dword:00000001
""MinorVersion""=dword:00000001"
,sait011,2013-03-29T03:19Z,I can not install update 1.02 required me version 1.01 update
,ziuber18,2013-03-29T15:42Z,@sait And your version is...?
,sait011,2013-03-29T20:25Z,I installed Assassin's Creed III - THETA (2012) PC [ENG / RUS] RePack probably 1.01 version
,ziuber18,2013-03-29T21:59Z,so you version should be 1.01 and update to 1.02 should do just fine. You may try adding the registry keys I've mentioned above.

,tulume,2013-05-17T04:23Z,"I am using  Assassin's Creed III - THETA (2012) PC [ENG/RUS] RePack. When i try to install any of the updates, it shows a error in some strange language. I tried your instructions of searching ""disk1"" in temp and deleting it. The first time i searched there were 3-4 folders which i deleted, but the second time in the ""run update 1.02 but DON'T HIT INSTALL YET"" part i don't find any ""disk1"" folder in temp. Yet the update shows the same error. Every update shows the same error."

,ziuber18,2013-05-17T12:16Z,"@tulume
You may try reinstalling your game or adding registry key I've mentioned above.

Also, if you try to install international update the message should be in english so you will have better understanding of what is wrong."
,tulume,2013-05-17T13:33Z,"@ziuber18 I did add the registry key you gave, but still there is no result. :-(  Even tried installing from the backups you gave, but it is showing, i believe, the same error. "
,tulume,2013-05-17T13:34Z,I will re-install and try.
,tulume,2013-05-20T00:32Z,"To anyone trying to install The Tyranny of King Washington or these updates on  Assassin's Creed III - THETA (2012) PC [ENG/RUS] RePack, i want to tell you it will not work. Reason for this is that  Assassin's Creed III - THETA (2012) PC [ENG/RUS] RePack does not use ubisoft game launcher, which is necessary to install The Tyranny of King Washington or these updates. It will work if it is R.G. Mechanics or Skidrow."
