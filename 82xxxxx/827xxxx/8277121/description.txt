Ok, here are the russian updates required to play 
The Tyranny of King Washington DLC for AC III.

Unpack and install them one after another and apply crack 
from whichever release you like.


I have included backup installers in case the ones from rar's
should not work.




IN CASE THE INSTALLERS WOLDN'T WORK
-WinKey+R and type %TEMP% and hit enter. Now search this folder for
 'disk1' and delete all folders that have been found.
-run update 1.02 but DON'T HIT INSTALL YET.
-Search temp folder for 'disk1' once again and delete content 
 of Disk1/deltaFiles/multi/
-Now you can hit install.
-Do the same with update 1.03.
-Now you can install Washington DLC's normally.


I can't seed 24/7 so you must be pacient.
Pacience my young padawans.
