Travel Documentary hosted by Dougie Vipond and Duncan McCallum and Cameron McNeish, published by BBC broadcasted as part of BBC The Adventure Show series in 2013 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

In the middle of winter, with 17 hours of darkness, 500 competitors head north of Inverness for one of the world's toughest mountain bike races, the Strathpuffer 24-hour marathon. And once again, this year conditions are testing - with ice and mud pushing the competitors and their bikes to the very limit.

Also in this month's Adventure Show, we discover how cycling managed to turn one man's life around and we are heading into the hills with Cameron McNeish, who proves that you don't need to spend a fortune to have decent gear.
