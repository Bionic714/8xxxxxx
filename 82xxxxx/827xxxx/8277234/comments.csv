,adrianyujs,2013-03-22T16:38Z,"@Kuyuuji: Hi, the different is hard subs and soft subs. Means this one is HardSubs, means the subtitle is integrated into the video. Another 1 is SoftSubs, meaning its RAW + Subtitle file, which means u can turn on/off subtitle while this one cannot be turn off at all."
