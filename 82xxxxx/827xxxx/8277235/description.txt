Set in 1943, World War II provides a vivid backdrop for the action of Jan Jakub Kolski's wonderfully lyrical Pornografia. The story concerns a game that two adult men, theater director Fryderyk (Krzysztof Majchrzak) and writer Witold (Adam Ferency), play to convince a sixteen-year-old girl and boy to fall in love. The girl, Henia, is the youthful, unsuspecting daughter of their hosts, the loquacious Hipolit (Krzysztof Globisz) and drunken Marysia (Graźyna Błęcka-Kolska), who have invited the men to wait out the war on their farm. Quiet and perfunctory, the boy, Karol, is unaware of their schemes, and Henia's proud, solidly mustached fiancé also fails to catch on, with tragic consequences. The story's irony — the men's insistence on winning this private, "pornographic" war to build sexual attraction between the teenagers and their absolute disinterest in the real one that wages around them — is conveyed through imaginative camerawork, an unforgettable, "sad-happy" soundtrack, and superb acting. Majchrzak and Globisz, in particular, give worthy performances as goofy but unyielding personalities.
