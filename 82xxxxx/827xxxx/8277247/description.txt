These are the original ebook packs released by the group known as The NERDs

The contents of this torrent is in the included plain text files Index 2012.txt
A list of the complete collection 2003-2012 is also included for reference.
A list of links to other NERDs ebook torrents is also included.
You can view these text files quickly by setting them to Priority High.

If you aren't familiar with NERDs ebooks, sample a single day from a smaller, more recent torrent by setting other files in the torrent to Priority "do not download".

The complete collection from 2003 through 2012 contains over 300,000 ebooks, is over 234GB RAR'd, would be double that otherwise and will not be posted in any other format.

These torrents are an expression of appreciation to the NERDs for making all these wonderful ebooks available, providing missing and broken files as needed and giving me their blessing to redistribute them here.

These torrents are being posted anonymously via VPN for obvious reasons.  If these reasons aren't obvious to you, then you shouldn't be torrenting.
