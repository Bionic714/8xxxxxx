,blakeh,2013-03-20T04:11Z,ok this one works perfectly thanks W!
,WDoubleYouW,2013-03-20T04:33Z,"@blakeh
Your saves should be fine. No need to reinstall the whole game all over again!"
,vokvok333,2013-03-20T04:40Z,any news on the 1.9.32.0. release??
,WDoubleYouW,2013-03-20T06:28Z,"@vokvok333
We generally wait for it to get out of beta before we release the update."
,vokvok333,2013-03-20T18:36Z,ok.
,vokvok333,2013-03-20T23:48Z,1.9.32 is not beta. waitinf for new update from reloaded. :)

,WDoubleYouW,2013-03-21T06:13Z,"@coltraz
Sounds like you need to update skse to 1.06.11
skse.silverlock.org"
,youngster86,2013-03-21T14:42Z,"This is the update 1.9.26.0.8 and the new Skse reqiure the latest update which is 1.9.32.0* and not the 1.9.26.0*, so if any skse use download this it is useless wait for 1.9.32.0*"
,Jeordie,2013-03-22T02:27Z,"There are archived builds for a reason youngster86, if you read the skse_docs.txt, you would of seen the skse and the run times section. Skse 1.6.11	 for version 1.9.29.0 of the game is what you need for this patch. 
Who knows when and if we will see a small incremental patch to .32."
,Jeordie,2013-03-22T05:57Z,"http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Patch Fixed issue with NPCs sleeping with open eyes
.32 is not a critical update anyway."
,youngster86,2013-03-22T10:38Z,It is not because of update its just to use last version of skse since all new mods requires it pretty much
