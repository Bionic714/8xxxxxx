Release notes:
This is a 7-zip self-extracting archive using advanced LZMA2 compression. You may extract with latest WinRAR or 7-zip if you prefer. If user account control doesn't allow you to extract directly to your Skyrim directory, simply extract to desktop and then copy and paste it into your Skyrim directory. This update is cumulative, which means you do not need all the previous updates to use this one. It includes all previous updates.

Automated RELOADED release included more steps to install than were necessary, and included an updated steam_api.dll crack that has been flagged by many as a virus. I am sure it is not a virus, but it is not necessary to take the chance, since the original steam_api.dll crack works just as well and is definitely not a virus.
