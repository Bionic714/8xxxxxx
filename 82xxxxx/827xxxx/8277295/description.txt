We all understand the importance of daily exercise in keeping physically fit. But mental exercise is just as essential to our health and well-beingΓÇöespecially when it comes to defending against forgetfulness, memory loss, and even dementia. These and other age-associated afflictions were once regarded as all but inevitable, but in fact, as this eye-opening, inspiring book shows, there is much we can do to protect ourselves as we grow older. With the right tools, we can all maximize our brainpower and keep our minds sharp, healthy, and cognitively fit throughout life.  
 
 Written by internationally renowned cognitive psychologist Shlomo Breznitz and technologist Collins Hemingway, Maximum Brainpower provides both an in-depth look at how the brain works and proven methods to increase its capabilities. Armed with the results of cutting-edge research, Breznitz and Hemingway champion in compelling detail the challenge and stimulus of continual change over the deadening effects of comfortable routine. They show how to separate good mental stress from bad, and demonstrate how hope and socialization can help delay or even fight off the worst symptoms of dementia.  
  
 Did you know that experts are often less mentally agile than jacks-of-all-trades? That mental exercises such as crossword puzzles and sudoku are of minimal help in building brainpower? That multitasking poses unique dangers to the brain by presenting us with an environment in which we never evolved enough to thrive? Breznitz knowsΓÇöand whatΓÇÖs more, he knows what to do about it.
  
 Filled with colorful real-life stories and fascinating psychological experiments, many published here for the first time, this revelatory work will help adults of any age build and retain their mental acuity. Think better, live better, be better with Maximum Brainpower. Really, itΓÇÖs a no-brainer!
