"Quick Hardening Caulk"

Jess comes to a conclusion about her 
romantic feelings for Nick and she 
struggles to tell him - until she's 
hopped up on pain medication. But after 
admitting her feelings, she finds out 
he may have been keeping something from 
her. Meanwhile, Schmidt becomes obsessed 
with buying a fish, which Winston sees 
as a metaphor for Schmidt's unresolved 
feelings toward Cece and Nick plans a 
bar promotion to impress the bar owner.

Evolve... or die.

Enjoy :)
