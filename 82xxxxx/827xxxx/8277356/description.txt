"Double Down"

Ryan's show is rated #1 but even this 
new, exalted status does not provide 
the personal happiness he wants in 
his life. Lauren explains that 
happiness comes from within and real 
joy can only be found by helping 
others. Ryan attempts to achieve 
inner happiness by helping Danny 
(Seth Morris) hook up with Sonia but 
she fancies the stranger, Carlo (Ben 
Falcone) instead. Meanwhile Owen and 
Anne snoop around the house of the 
strange Mr. K only to leave more 
disturbed than when they arrived.

Evolve... or die.

Enjoy :)
