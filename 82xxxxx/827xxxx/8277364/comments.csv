,taikokid,2013-03-20T21:55Z,do you have past x-men packs before 28? I collected the revised chronological X-men up to 18. would love to fill in some holes. Much appreciated if you can help or at least point me in the right direction.
,turtlex,2013-03-20T23:16Z,"Thanks for these uploads Catapiller! 

I have a question about the numbering of the stories... are you starting from #1 with each new year?  I have the old packs up to #843 (Road to Redemption).  How do these fit in with the old pack 28?  I noticed there is some overlap (though I could be mistaken).

Again, thanks for all of your hard work assembling these.  It's much appreciated!"
,catapiller,2013-03-23T02:08Z,"To taikokid and turtle.  I have the whole X-Men series chronologically back to the very beginning, with a possible small hole at some point that wouldn't be too hard to fill in.  I pretty much have all the titles as individual sets as well.  My packs run 1-12 and then 17-27.  That's why I started with Pack 28, and I found a bunch of issues that weren't included in previous packs that I ended up with over 2 gigs of issues to put in before I got chronological."

,lerath666,2013-04-14T04:22Z,"for the record, the ones on Demoniod, H33t, and here went all the way to 29.  there is SOME overlap between this 30, and the other 29. "
