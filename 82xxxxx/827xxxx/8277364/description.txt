This is Chronological X-Men Pack 30.  I have to say I was amazed at 
how many mutant stories were being published at the same time and 
even after AvX that completely ignored  AvX happening.  What a 
headache it was trying  to put all this stuff in order. This section 
of X-Men stories are great.  I have been reading the X-Men since 
around #100, (and I was like 10)  when there was only one title.  
The Byrne, Claremont, Austin days were hard to beat, but the modern 
X-Men of the last 10 years have been equally amazing.

I am a big fan of the previous Chrono-packs and really enjoy reading 
runs of comics rather than as they come out month by month.  Maybe 
the demise (?) of Demonoid brought about the end of the Chronological 
Packs I had been following.  Since pack 27 came out in 2010, until a 
few months ago I had resisted reading the X-Men and Avengers, at 
least until AvX wrapped up. I then embarked on the task of putting 
together my own collection from where pack 27 left off.  Since I 
havenΓÇÖt seen anyone else put up this material, and I went to all the 
effort, I figured I should share.  I have 2 more packs to follow that 
should get close to the current releases.  After that if there is 
interest, I could put out previous packs.

My ground rules for inclusion are pretty broad.  I am trying to follow 
all of the mutants that we know and love where ever they appear.  
So for instance if Wolverine, Storm, or the Beast are in an Avengers 
title, I include it, but if no mutants are included in a storyline at 
all I probably exclude it.  I consider Deadpool to be part of the 
mutant family, so you will see his stuff here also.  I think the 
orders here work pretty well, but you can reorder stuff as you see 
fit.  If anyone has suggestions of issues I might have missed let me 
know.  I will try to work them in.

These are not my scans.  I have been in awe of the folks that turn 
out such amazing scans and you will find most scans are tagged by 
their makers.   Let us hope that the sharing continues.
