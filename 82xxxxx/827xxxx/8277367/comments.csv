,Gacy8Gein,2013-03-20T07:34Z,"Skynet Edition is the one with extra scenes, and the longer ending, yes."
[T],vonRicht,2013-03-20T07:46Z,"It's the edtition with the shortened ending.

The extended special edition (which are 2 minutes longer) has the longer ending.

I was actually thinking about uploading the extended special edition, but....?"
[T],vonRicht,2013-03-20T07:47Z,"Skynet Edition has all 3 versions. 

The theatrical cut, special edition (this one - with the short ending) and the extended special edtion (with the long ending)"
,Chartsandgrafs,2013-03-20T09:50Z,"The ending which shows Sarah Connor as an old lady sitting on a bench in the park makes me want to slit my wrists.

I'm guessing this upload has that godforsaken ending?  Say it ain't so.    
"
[T],vonRicht,2013-03-20T12:06Z,"No it ain't so.

This version - The Special Edition - ends with a car driving down the highway at night with a Sarah Connor voiceover.

The Extended Special Edition - ends with Sarah Connor sitting on a bench at a park, very old, watching her family while there's a voiceover.

Hope this clears it up?! :)"

My Bad. I have this on Bluray, and i thought it was Normal edition / Extended Edition / Skynet Edition.

Thanks for confirming that this is the best version out there basically ;)

I especially like your HD rips with DTS-HD / TrueHD. 
Bookmarked :)"

No worries. I agree that the Special Edition of T2 is the best version released. :)

Glad to hear that you enjoy the uploads. Appreciated! :)"
