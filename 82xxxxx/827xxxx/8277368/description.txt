The annual Future Watch issue taps into the expertise of a panel of 15 NHL scouts and GMs to determine the top 50 drafted prospects in the game and ranks the 30 NHL teams on the depth of their development systems. We also rank the top 10 prospects for each NHL team and take a sneak peek at the next three NHL entry drafts. For hockey fans interested in what's next in each team's pipeline of talent, Future Watch is a unique and much-anticipated system report.
