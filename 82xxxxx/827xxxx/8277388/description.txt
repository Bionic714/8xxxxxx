ReleaseNotes:

This is the deluxe edition with bonus tracks. (The last 3)

Break the Spell is a gleaming showcase for frontman Chris Daughtry's powerful,
emotionally resonant voice and knack for relentless melodic hooks and big, anthemic
choruses. Produced by Howard Benson, who produced Daughtry's two previous albums,
Break The Spell gives the band room to evolve musically while aiming to satisfy its
many long-time fans. "Going in to the writing sessions, we said, 'Let's not try to
sound like anything. Let's just write, and see what happens,'" says Chris, who
co-wrote every song with either one of his band-mates (guitarists Josh Steely and
Brian Craddock and bassist Josh Paul) or collaborators such as Marti Frederiksen,
Busbee, and Bret James. "We came up with some pretty interesting tunes that sound
nothing like anything we've done before. Even though some of them didn't make the
album, the process stretched us and took us to new places. It was an absolutely
inspirational experience."

Album opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic.
HHI has no opinion with regard to the quality of the Artist.
We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!
