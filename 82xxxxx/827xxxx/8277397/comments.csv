,CollectorMan223,2013-03-29T15:01Z,worked great for me didn't need any key. and I've heard a lot of ppl say they cant uninstall after admin account is set up but I wonder if they tried a regular app uninstall or if they went to the advanced settings inside kaspersky to uninstall I'd say if a person did want to uninstall after have an admin account set up don't do a regular uninstall bc there's gotta be a reason the option is built in to the app but I dont know for sure haven't had a need to uninstall yet. Great work thank you SceneDL
,CollectorMan223,2013-03-29T20:18Z,Bad news Not blaming any one but the app creators but this app FUCKED UP GOOGLE VOICE COMMANDS on two of my devices to the point I had to do a factory reset on both of them!! :( this is the first time I've ever encountered this with an app.
