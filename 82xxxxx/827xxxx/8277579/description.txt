Overview
Could the war in Europe have been won in 1944 if the right strategies had been employed?

The post-Normandy battles, as the Allies struggled for seven months to advance from the Seine to the Rhine, were never less than complex and controversial. Even after sixty years, the questions remain.

In this account of the 1944 post-Normandy campaign, historian Robin Neillands examines the often difficult relationships between the Allied generals and the nature of Eisenhower's exercise of his role as supreme commander. With superb battle narratives throughout and clear analysis of success and failure at every point, the author casts a new and informed light on the long, drawn-out, and costly struggle for the Rhine.
