Actually, here's where the strings come in. Come Pick Me Up is Superchunk's finest effort in years; a bright, infectious pop record that rejuvenates the group's trademark sound with the addition of producer Jim O'Rourke's candy-colored orchestral flourishes -- without losing sight of the music's punk roots. Tracks like "Hello Hawk," "1000 Pounds," and "Pink Clouds" achieve a perfect balance between Superchunk's patented brand of hyperkinetic indie rock and O'Rourke's avante-pop aesthetics, while drawing upon the talents of Chicago underground notables including saxophonist Ken Vandermark, trombonist Jeb Bishop, and cellist Fred Lonberg-Holm to bring galvanizing new dimensions to Mac McCaughan's memorably melodic songs. A stunning and unexpected return to form.
