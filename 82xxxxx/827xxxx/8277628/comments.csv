,fr33m4n88,2013-03-20T23:28Z,"Ya, I just noticed that. All the s05e07 are all TvTeam uploads...hopefully 1 out of the 5 will work!"
,aiigghht,2013-03-21T01:01Z,"no problem downloading to 100%.

Also downloaded very quickly"
,yaycobD,2013-03-22T04:28Z,fantastico
,humpahoe,2013-03-22T15:38Z,what was the repack for?
,js99912,2013-03-27T05:08Z,"the repack is because this group lately has been seeding fake files on many popular downloads.

Fake are usually not a big deal, but this group carries a ""skull"" icon, so many end up downloading and seeding especially after it hits RSS and is auto downloaded thousand of times.  Then we end up with a file thats BS and a ton of seeds...

This is what TPB doesn't want, and TvTeam's skull should be removed....

AND the SOB's are even to lazy to paste IMDB links, minor, but a skull user should be benefiting this community..

TvTEam is no benefit, I only DL from this user as a last resort, TvTeam is not skull-worthy.

Hey I like free shit too, but this is TPB have some fucken class mother fuckers... ;)
