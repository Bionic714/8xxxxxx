[T],SCSA420,2013-03-20T20:31Z,"Guess what Knucklehead this file isn't mkv its .mp4 and it will work on any device capable of playing 720p HD mp4 videos which includes any BluRay players made by Samsung, LG, or Philips as well as Sony Playstation 3, iPad, iPhone, Samsung Galaxy S III, etc.  XviD and DivX .avi files are not as good of quality as AVC H264 or x264 .mp4 or .mkv files. In fact mkv is better because it can have DTS audio you can't get that with crappy XviD .avi files and .mkv files are playable on BluRay players made by LG, Samsung. Philips, Panasonic. XviD sucks. Get with the program Xvid .avi is like old now and x264 or H264 Advanced Video Codec is now the standard and is more efficient and better quality the .avi is. This isn't the 2003 XviD era its now the 2013 x264 AVC era so update your video equipment if you want to be able to play the newer stuff."
