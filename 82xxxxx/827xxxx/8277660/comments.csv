,maymay04,2013-03-20T07:46Z,theburningbush --- been happening to me for a few weeks now - have to re start your computer
,bochick,2013-03-20T09:18Z,i am also having issues downloading this
,xyko62,2013-03-20T15:18Z,I've tried rebooting and still no luck. There must be a problem with the torrent itself.
[T],theburningbush,2013-03-20T16:29Z,"11 hrs 15 min of ""downloading"" -- still at 0.0%. As for TvTeam's 480p version of this, it's 5 hrs 10 min of ""downloading"" -- still at 0.0%.

Meanwhile, I've successfully DL'd several other torrents.

maymay04: Restart my computer? Are you effing serious?

AND...a person over at KAT commented about this TvTeam torrent: ""having trouble downloading this!! Stuck at 0.0% for like 2 hours now!!"""
[T],theburningbush,2013-03-20T16:58Z,"I'm happy to report that although this torrent appears to be forever stuck at 0.0%, the one at https://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8277936/Chelsea.Lately.2013.03.19.Steve.Carell.480p.HDTV.x264-mSD is now slowly showing signs of life; it's all the way up to 3.0% availability right now...and climbing."
,bochick,2013-03-20T19:41Z,"i have made it to 30.2 % only 12 hours of torrenting later, the 480p one is still at 0% what the fuck is going on tvteam??? "
,maymay04,2013-03-21T04:04Z,theburningbush: is it necessary to be rude? i was having this problem with all torrents and i had to re start my computer and then they worked fine. it was just a suggestion.
