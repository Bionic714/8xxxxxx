I only upload this because I believe it is an improvement over the others on here. I just listened to them and I believe it is back when I had borrowed a friends keyboard when I first realized I knew how to play a little. The piano sounded so bad to me when I just played it that I wanted to post this.
In my poetry I try and follow what Browning said about poetry being a silent echo reminding the reader of something you wanted to emphasize. I like syncopation in good rock. It kind of brings a sense of falling apart. If I remember right it involves the bass and drums on a steady beat and the rhythm guitar off by and eight note or so which cause a feeling of being held together by a string. I try and use Browning's ideas of near rhymes to emphasis that sense of rhythm in a type of waning of consonance and dissonance. I am trying to do the same thing on the piano. I don't know if it works but I am learning.
