This is 73 episodes in total from 1993 to 1999, including the entire first week of shows. These are collected from filesharing clients, encoded in varying resolutions and formats (VLC plays them all), and many are impractically large! Please forgive me for they are relics and I did not encode them. Quality here varies from excellent to blurry, hissy VHS. Some episodes include commercials (probably a bonus for most people since the show is a nostalgia trip anyway).
