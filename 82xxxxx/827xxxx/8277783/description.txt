I present this file as is - I wish I had the full show but about 10 years ago I guess I thought it was a good idea to cut them down and store them on mini-DV cassettes where they have been sitting ever since. I think I also have '97 and '98 in this format which I'll also upload, plus a couple of full later shows including full BBC/Sky continuityΓÇª but due to my bandwidth I'll wait at least until each one is well-seeded before even beginning the process of importing/converting/sharing the next.

It'd be nice if this inspired others to share other shows they might have - perhaps even the full versions of these shows. As I said, my bandwidth isn't great, but rest assured, I plan to fully seed and continue seeding indefinitely unless a better quality/fuller copy of the shows in question come to light, so please be as patient as I would. Please direct any comments on the quality, content, and anything that was cut to myself around 10 years ago - you will need a time machine - there's nothing I can do nowΓÇª I only present these files because they're better than nothing, which is what I've found when I've searched :)
