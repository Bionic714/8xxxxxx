I have not deleted the sxs folder as I normally do for people who
want to add features offline such as netfx3 or hyper-v.

This has no Drivers added, no KB files added, No Features added.
This is a No Frills release so that people using UEFI to boot
on a fat32 usb drive can install. My typical releases are so
large because of all the KB files, that they need to be split
to be under 4GB, which is the file-size limitation of fat32.
Splitting large install.wim files causes problems with not being
able to find licensing information. It only looks in the first
split file.

To get around this, you need all files to be under that size,
including the install.wim. I have also added the UEFI boot
sector to this iso, so you can burn it to a dvd and boot with
EFI support. It may or may not work on a non-EFI system.
I did not design it for a non-EFI system.

To install using a fat32 flash drive in UEFI mode, first prep
the drive using the instructions I have included in:
UEFI Fat32 USB drive.txt

Then you extract the iso to a directory and copy the contents
to your USB drive. Do not copy the directory folder that you
created to extract to. You should have setup.exe, bootmgr,
and bootmgr.efi, etc in the root directory of your usb drive if
you have copied the files correctly.

You also need to prep your hard drive during setup if it is
in MBR instead of GPT mode. Read the text file.

The typical rules apply with regards to anti-virus excluding
any activators and pre-screening any updates to make sure people
don't complain about them breaking offline KMS activation.

I personally recommend disabling auto-updates and just installing
updates in manual mode using wuapp.exe. I also disable smart-screen
filter, but that's just me. You can do whatever you want.

I tested and verified this working on a fat32 usb drive install
using UEFI bios settings and GPT conversions.
