,wintersbutterfly,2013-03-20T07:22Z,I wont post anything more until I improve which may take sometime. I am unsure if it is peers or seeders I see in BitSpirit. But I have seen a lot of down loaders. I hope that was because they are decent. Thank you.
,wintersbutterfly,2013-03-20T07:28Z,Sorry same file...must be getting sleepy. I have two versions of this on my computer. I believed I posted the same thing twice. When I play I just like to mess with the chord sounds against each other. I think that is why I like to sing against another voice.
,wintersbutterfly,2013-03-21T06:01Z,I posted my Blog address on some other posts. It is just a WordPress Blog. If you visit it I have no way of seeing any IPs in my Stats...just the number of visitors and which pages the click on. As a visitor to TPB for years upon years I understand anyone reluctance here to visit a posted URL. But if you are interested it is safe. I received first place twenty years ago on my first short story I wrote in College and I have since received many local awards my favorite was a for a line in a poem...Punk Poetry wishes I was dead. I carry a mosh pit around inside my head. Anyway it isn't a normal Blog. It is just a way I found to publish my poetry and stories as a tribute in a world that ignores so many people.

,wintersbutterfly,2013-03-23T11:29Z,"I decided to stop posting here. I will keep posting new stuff as I get better on my SkyDrive connected to my Blog.
I have seen upwards of 200 or so people downloading in my stats on BitSpirit. I do not see that on TPB. And I assume it may be from other trackers or something. Anyway it will be easier for me to upload an manage files on my skydrive and it will be a little more conventional."
,wintersbutterfly,2013-03-23T11:30Z,Thank you for anyone that took the time to dl. TPB has kind in the past and I appreciate it.
