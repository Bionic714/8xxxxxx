DIABOLIQUE : ALTERNATE CUT [576p] (1996/2013)
A fan edit by Dr. Spirstein
Directed by J. Chechick
Starring Sharon Stone, Isabelle Adjani, Chazz Palminteri, Kathy Bates.

A husband, his wife, his mistress. All will plot. One will die.

The remake of Clouzot's 1957 masterpiece Les Diaboliques - now starring Academy Awards nominees S. Stone and I. Adjani - is presented here in a significantly revised alternate cut which follows a "less is more" principle.

The film is presented in a carefully restored black and white - as per the director's original intent - and is bereft of 23 minutes of weak and largely useless material. Inane dialogue, fruitless sub-plots and gaping holes in the story have been removed to present a more intense and potent thriller.

The ludicrously over-the-top ending has also been removed and replaced with a much more blunt ending which is more in keeping with the original Clouzot version.
