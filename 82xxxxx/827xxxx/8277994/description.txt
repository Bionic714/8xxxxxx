The Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare, written at the invitation of the Centre by an independent ΓÇÿInternational Group of ExpertsΓÇÖ, is the result of a three-year effort to examine how extant international law norms apply to this ΓÇÿnewΓÇÖ form of warfare. The Tallinn Manual pays particular attention to the jus ad bellum, the international law governing the resort to force by States as an instrument of their national policy, and the jus in bello, the international law regulating the conduct of armed conflict (also labelled the law of war, the law of armed conflict, or international humanitarian law).  Related bodies of international law, such as the law of State responsibility and the law of the sea, are dealt within the context of these topics.

The Tallinn Manual is not an official document, but instead an expression of opinions of a group of independent experts acting solely in their personal capacity.  It does not represent the views of the Centre, our Sponsoring Nations, or NATO.  It is also not meant to reflect NATO doctrine.  Nor does it reflect the position of any organization or State represented by observers.
 
The Tallinn Manual is available in both paper and electronic copies from Cambridge University Press (┬⌐ Cambridge University Press 2013). We have also made the book available for reading and research below.

We also recommend reading Professor Michael N. Schmitt's article "International Law in Cyberspace: The Koh Speech and Tallinn Manual Juxtaposed", published in the Harvard International Law Journal.
