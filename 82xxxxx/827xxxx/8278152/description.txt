About:
A retrospective collection of songs from the first three albums, all re-mastered (by Emily Lazar) and a couple of them re-recorded. It also features a new recording of the song ΓÇ£MeadowlandΓÇ¥ (previously only available on the Autumn Interlude demo EP) and the new song ΓÇ£AnthemoessaΓÇ¥. The original CD edition came in an exclusive slipcase with an embossed dragonfly, and all CD editions has a photo-booklet containing brief anecdotes about each song.
Amethystium is the soundtrack to a journey - between light and darkness, humanity and fantasy. A melodic fusion of ambient electronica and neoclassical darkwave, the music walks a tight-rope between otherworldly bliss and contemplative melancholy. Amethystium takes you on an emotive escape from the ordinary.
