When people think of the hip hop life, they think of the players - the men who shape the music and the blinged-out lifestyle that comes with success. The fact is the hip hop life is different for the women involved: the spouses, girlfriends or artists trying to define themselves in a world where men are still calling the shots.

VH1's new, 8-part docu-soap series "Love & Hip Hop" follows four dynamic women who are connected to the world of hip hop, whether it's through the men they love, or their struggle to be heard as an artist. "Love & Hip Hop" provides a dramatic, funny and sometimes heartbreaking look into the female side of the New York hip hop life as these four women try to claim their own place in it.

Chrissy Lampkin, girlfriend to hip hop star Jim Jones, and Emily Bustamante, girlfriend to rapper Fabolous, are waiting for their men to put a ring on it; however, both men suffer from a severe case of commitment phobia. Olivia Longott, the former first lady of G Unit, is done living in the shadows and is determined to make it on her own as a solo artist. Like Olivia, Somaya "Boss" Reese, a tall, sexy Latina, also has a fierce determination to launch her rap career and become a household name in the music industry. Will these four women have the endurance and fortitude to survive the chaos of the hip hop game and realize their dreams?
