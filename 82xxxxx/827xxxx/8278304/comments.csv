,mk.macabre,2013-03-20T12:02Z,"Thankyou for all your hard work and effort k3nd00d. I have been grabbing your uploads for well over a year now and they have always been both 100% legit and great quality. I am usually unable to comment on torrents here because being from the UK i have to visit here via a mirror site, for some reason disabling my ability to comment, however i have managed a bypass today specifically to say three things to you: 

1: Thank you again for your time and effort.
2: Please please please keep them coming in your tried and tested xvid .avi format. There are still plenty of us who do not like/use the MKV/X264/MP4 and such files.
3: A9/V9 ;)"
