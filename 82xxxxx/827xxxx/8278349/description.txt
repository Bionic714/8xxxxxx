Mageia 3 planning was modified to give us some more time ΓÇô for one beta release more, and to enable us to hunt more bugs. We finally had to face quite a lot of them during the QA tests of beta 3 isos,  and it took more time than expected to fix it. WeΓÇÖve been working really hard, and now we have beta 3 ready for you to start testing.
