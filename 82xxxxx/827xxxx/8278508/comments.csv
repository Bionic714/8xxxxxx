[T],480v,2013-03-20T11:47Z,I have some bad news... Apparently the source where I was getting Thom's show has finally decided to block access. I suppose it's only right. I always felt a bit conflicted about taking without permission and sharing. Oh well...looks like it's back to recording radio streams. No more 'Thom's need to know news' and free speech tv intermissions unless of course I add those in which I probably won't.
