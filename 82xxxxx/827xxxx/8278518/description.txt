A popular stand-up comedy track I first heard on Pandora Radio. This is the iTunes version (converted to 128 kbps quality MP3) of the single track "Love" by Drew Micheal from the CD "Comedians You Should Know". 

Drew Michael is a Chicago-based stand-up comedian. He's damned hilarious with dark humor, poking fun at himself and the concept of love. Check it out if you're a fan of comedians such as Louis C.K., Bill Burr, Doug Stanhope, etc. 

Enjoy! And don't forget to support the shared material you like in the form of legitimate purchase! =)
