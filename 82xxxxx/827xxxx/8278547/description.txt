This late '80's recording of Peggy Lee with a quintet reminds me of 

Billie Holiday's later efforts in that the singing seems somewhat lethargic.

Unless you are intolerant of musicians whose "sound" or material changes

over the years (artists are always doing that to us....think Miles Davis) you

may enjoy hearing this.  If not..delete, optimize, and keep looking for the 

perfect song.  



The commentator (included booklet notes) makes the point that she (Peggy Lee)

was great because she delivered both BLUES and "POP" with excellence few others,

if any, could reasonably claim.   The (DDD) sound is good...the quintet includes 

a guitar and vibes (percussion) on some of the tunes.  Mostly slow tempos
