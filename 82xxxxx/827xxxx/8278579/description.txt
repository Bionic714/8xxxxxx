Notes

High quality motion-based frame interpolation has been used to recreate the 48fps
viewing experience of the movie since the BD features only the 24/1001 fps version.
The frame interpolation is based on a slightly modified version of the well-known
Interframe() script. Interpolated frames have been also sharpened to match more or
less the level of sharpness of the original source frames. This is NOT the real
thing! Frame interpolation is not perfect and will never be! May and will contain
traces of ghosting and haloing! Don't complain about it, you have been warned! If
you want the real deal, buy the 48 fps master or go to the cinema!(thanks Marin!)

This release is in 2 parts,just like the 3D Bluray,this is so the audios & subs from the Bluray can be added to each part(if you require)with mkvmerge,without going out of sync,mkvmerge can then be used to merge the 2 files into 1(if you wish) using the append function.
