Our Food
Giles Coren embarks on a journey across Britain to discover how our landscape, history and climate shape what we grow and where we grow it




3)  Kent 
Giles and the team explore Kent. You'd think there could be nothing more British than the garden of England but food here also has a distinctly continental flavour. Giles gets a taste of what British beer was like before the arrival of hops from Europe, while Alys Fowler uncovers the real roots of English cherries. Lucy Worsley heads to Whitstable in search of shellfish and the team learn about the secret lives of the shepherds, or 'lookers', who watched their flocks on Romney Marsh
