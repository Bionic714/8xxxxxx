Thought it was strange there wasn't a Sega Saturn shmup compilation on Pirate Bay, so here you go...

Included:

Emulator: SSF 010 alpha R1 w/bios (newer versions are out but this one works best for me) 
	- google "ssf alpha" for information on how to use this emulator if you 	     have issues or want to try out newer versions	


Games:
- Batsugun
- Battle Garegga
- DoDonPachi
- Donpachi
- Galactic Attack
- Gradius Deluxe Pack
- Gradius Gaiden
- Metal Black
- Parodius: Fantastic Journey
- Sexy Pardious
- Shienryu
- Soukyugurentai
- Cotton 2
- Darius Gaiden
- Radiant Silvergun
- Thunderforce V

Some work  better than others. Mount the nrg files (they're essentially just iso files just renamed for Nero) on Daemon Tools (or whatever you use for your virtual drive) or the cue file if it is in cue/bin format.

Direct all questions regarding how to mount images or how to use SSF Alpha (and any other question for that matter) to Google.

Have fun and seed.
