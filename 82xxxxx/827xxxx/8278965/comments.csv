Hey bruss.

There is a problem with the ""setup.exe"". It says in the torrent discription that the installation would let me choose the language used in the game, it does not (triple checked it). The game seems to run with Russian (I think) as the default language when i start it. Have i missed a bit of critical information somewhere?

I can play despite of the problem, however I'd much rather have english text than cryllic.

On another note, the game seems to run fine and I've not encountered any major errors so far, other than the language problem that is.

Thx again for sharing, and any help would be much appreciated."
