,Kronical4,2013-03-20T21:37Z,"@gulisa Yeah your word means a lot coming from you, since I see that you have uploaded torrents to share to everyone...NOT! You are 6 out of the 9 comments here (including mine now).
 First you demand people to seed for you, like anyone gives a shit about you, or what you want. Then you go and bash on a trusted uploader. Black Box is a Scene Release, Gh0stNet is a uploader, learn the difference. If there is something wrong with the game that would be BlackBox, and they could of just taken out some resolution choices, being that BlackBox is about gutting a game to the lowest amount of size. If you want the full version then download the game at normal size or compressed, which i believe is 5gb or so. So next stfu or be more respectful to the uploaders. Cause I think whining demanding brats like you should get the BANHAMMER"
,forlani101,2013-03-20T22:40Z,"@gulisa! You're downloading a game for free which cost money otherwise and complaining because you know nothing about computers in general and want to put the blame on others for your own ignorance. I see you going far in life.

On a positive note, the game works flawless for me, nothing wrong with resolutions here as the dumb kid suggests. Just pure butter here! Thanks again Ghost for a great upload! Seeding!"

,Staford,2013-03-23T11:15Z,"I followed the instructions, and for some reason, the game won't launch at all. Any hints?"
,BeStelios,2013-03-23T16:02Z,"The game Sucks Hard I played it for 10 minutes..

,MaximumGamer,2013-03-31T16:48Z,"|Problems with resolution, can you fix it ? thanks !"
,pREMOk,2013-04-25T14:05Z,it works??
,pcgamer321,2013-05-01T04:31Z,"thanks ghostnet and blackbox. This torrent works fine.....i found no issues which are reported by some users about this game.No virus ,game is saving progress like it should and no problem with audio. There was a resolution bug which i overcame by clicking left/right arrow several times after which the 'undefined' changed into '1024*768' res value...solved.

Only thing i miss are the credits :( which is ripped. I'm totally enjoying the game."
,supermario5029,2013-05-08T16:16Z,"i think what this guy does is take the fuck out of the most important stuff out of a game and give it to us like that,also,this game is crap,but i just wanna try it out"
