No it isnt. I took care of that. 
I dont mean to be rude but I recommend you to actually download the file before making any smartass remarks."

So true~ Excellent quality...Many Thanks! However, Do you know when English subtitles are going to be available?... My French sucks.."
,edula666,2013-03-21T16:12Z,"Haven't tested them yet, but English subs @ http://subscene.com/subtitles/jagten-the-hunt/english/705378
Translation isn't perfect, by all accounts, but better than nothing for now :-)"
,AsifAkheir,2013-03-23T12:38Z,"Are the French subtitles accurate, or machine translated, like the English ones currently posted around the web?"
,songbite,2013-03-23T19:07Z,"I'm (almost) positive that the subs are from the bluray. So legit french. 
Most likely the source is the french br and Rough is known for ripping french stuff. "

Thanks. I downloaded them and am in the process of translating into English. No matter how bad my version is, it cannot possibly be worse the machine's translation (Which by the way is also from the French, not the Danish Original). I'll post link when I'm done."
,AsifAkheir,2013-03-24T10:25Z,"Okay, I've finished the translation. While it has flaws, it is actually a better film than I expected, now that the plot makes sense.

,AsifAkheir,2013-03-24T10:39Z,"I translated the machine subtitles into English actually spoken by humans. The film makes sense now.

This is for 24 FPS video 1hr 55 mins. It should work for this one. Re-title it to match exactly this title except for .srt extension and it will load automatically.

,rollacansada,2013-03-24T23:47Z,SORRY AsifAkheir but your translation SUCKS BIG TIME. It makes no sense and some jerk deleted the ones on Subscene. So I guess we all have to await someoene who can speak English properly to do them
,rollacansada,2013-03-24T23:49Z,"Sorry, but those ENGLISH subs are FUCKING HORRIBLE AND USELESS!"
,AsifAkheir,2013-03-25T01:06Z,"@ rollacansada
What media player are you using and how re you loading the subtitles?"
,AsifAkheir,2013-03-26T06:57Z,"More English subs here:
