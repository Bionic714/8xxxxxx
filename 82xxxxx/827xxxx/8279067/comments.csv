This is for 24 FPS video 1hr 55 mins. It should work for this one (runtime is the same). Re-title it to match exactly this title except for .srt extension and it will load automatically.

,AsifAkheir,2013-03-25T00:59Z,"@ Jespososo: Thanks.

@ rollacansada: are they not synced to this version?
I used the time and framerate synced to StyLishSaLH's version. You can advance or delay them in VLC. Tools > Track Synchronization > Subtitles/Video"
