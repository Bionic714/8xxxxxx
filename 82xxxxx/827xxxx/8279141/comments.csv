,Kcirred,2013-03-22T07:14Z,"In all honesty Grant's run started off very good in the beginning, I really liked it then it just started to get way too confusing. Stuff just stopped making sense chronologically, I would literally have to re-read the issue immediately just to know what the hell just happened not to mention Morales art at times just wasn't that good. All in all I wouldn't say it was a terrible read but it certainly wasn't a ""groundbreaking"" story It was just kinda ok to me and I may come back and read it later down the road."
