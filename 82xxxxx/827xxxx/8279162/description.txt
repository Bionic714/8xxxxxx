Greatest Hits Live 1988


Greatest Hits Live is singer-songwriter Carly Simon's 15th album, second greatest-hits album and first live album, released in 1988. All the songs are live versions from a 1987 HBO special taped on Martha's Vineyard called Live From Martha's Vineyard, which was released in 1987 on VHS and in 2004 on DVD.

The album is the soundtrack to Carly's 1987 HBO concert special, Live From Martha's Vineyard. Though it cuts three tracks from the finished concert- Give Me All Night, You Have To Hurt, and The Stuff That Dreams Are Made Of, it adds the song The Right Thing To Do, which didn't make it into the final cut of the concert. Greatest Hits Live was released on Vinyl and Cassette tape in early 1988, and on Compact disc in 1990. The album sold very well, going Gold immediately. In 1996, the album was certified Platinum by the RIAA, for sales of over 1,000,000 copies in the United States alone.
