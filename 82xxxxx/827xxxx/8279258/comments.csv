The only things I would change, from a reader's perspective, 1. I think if you want to be a writer and artist, don't be shy - be pros and put your names out there. 2. Not sure if it's intentional or not, but the panel borders aren't straight (hand-drawn lines, is what it looks like), it's distracting so I'd clean that one nitpicky thing up. Just a couple of opinions, hope you get a lot of feedback.

I'm gonna make my wife read it when she gets off work.

It's a tough market, but follow your dreams!"

We're doing everything digital -- my wife draws the figures and I do the layouts and backgrounds, all via drawing tablet -- but I wanted a hand-drawn effect on the panels rather than a pure, straight Illustrator line. Thanks for the feedback. Included this torrent and our web site, we've only gotten this in front of about 100 people so far.

Keep an eye out for more!"
