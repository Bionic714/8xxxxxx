Panther Scouts is a new webcomic launching this fall, about cats who go to school and are members of the titular cat youth organization. It's going to be funny, I promise.

This is the first of several digital ashcans, or maybe the only one, that will be coming out leading up to the proper launch of the series. We hope you enjoy it, and please share it around to anyone you think would be interested!
