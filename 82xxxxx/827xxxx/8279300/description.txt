From Wiki:


Deep Blue Something were an American rock band known for their 1995 hit single "Breakfast at Tiffany's".

The group was founded in 1992 in Denton, Texas, by brothers Todd and Toby Pipes; students at the University of North Texas at the time. The brothers enlisted drummer John Kirtland and guitarist Clay Bergus. Deep Blue Something originally performed as Leper Messiah, after the line from Ziggy Stardust.[1]

Bergus left the band before the band started recording their first album, 11th Song. The band independently released the album in 1993. Kirk Tatom joined the band after the album's release. In 1994, the band released their second album, Home via an independent label named Rainmaker Records. Home was re-released a year later by major label Interscope Records. The accompanying single "Breakfast at Tiffany's" reached the top five in the United States and number one in the United Kingdom.

According to Todd Pipes, the lyrics of the song were inspired by Audrey Hepburn's performance in the feature film Roman Holiday, but he thought that the Hepburn film Breakfast at Tiffany's would make a better song title.[2]

In late-1995, Tatom left the band and Bergus returned to his role as guitarist. The band worked on their sophomore album titled Byzantium with a planned release in 1996. However, the Deep Blue Something came into legal troubles over the copyright of 11th song and "Breakfast At Tiffany's".[3] As a result, Interscope put the album on hold. In 1998, the album was released only in Japan and some European countries. The album was currently available in the US.

In the wake of the Universal/PolyGram merger, the band parted ways with Interscope. They later signed with Azera Records, an independent label based in Phoenix, Arizona. Their self-titled album, which contains five tracks from Byzantium, was released later that year. Shortly after the album's relese, the band went separate ways.
