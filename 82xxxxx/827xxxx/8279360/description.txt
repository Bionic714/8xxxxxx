Sam Porter is a misanthropic fantasy novelist whose best friend is his pet dog Amis. While at a book signing in Totnes High Street, three people, whom Sam presumes are hard-core fantasy fans dressed in full costume, kidnap Amis. Sam fights them and during the fight, both Sam and Amis end up in an actual fantasy world - Lower Earth.

In Series 4, as they continue their search for the Sword of Asnagar, the Questers find themselves travelling through more dangerous kingdoms.
