[V],HighCode,2013-03-20T17:15Z,"I'll encode it to 1080p apx 5 GB and upload it tomorrow..
In about an hour/two I'll upload the BDRemux with multi separate + FRE, ITA, SPA tracks in torrent.
So maybe wait 2 hours and download the remux instead of the full BD. English DD-5.1 @640 KBps will be muxed in mkv."
