A large, creepy woman, she has long hair, wears a coat and carries shopping bags in both hands. He had never seen her before. But then, without warning, the woman starts stalking Hiroshi, shifting her attention from his next-door neighbor whom she had been visiting to Hiroshi himself.

This is an upload of the entire classic horror manga "Zashiki Onna".
The images are in .jpg format and are organized by Volume and Chapter Number.

Vol. 1.1 = Vol. 1, Chapter 1

(In this case, the manga is actually only 1 volume, but since it had more than 10 chapters the last 2 are listed as being in Vol. 2)

Chapter titles are not included, if you really want them you can (maybe) find them here:
