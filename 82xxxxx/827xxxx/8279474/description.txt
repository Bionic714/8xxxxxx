This is a collection of Donovan's albums from 1965 to 1976. These include 13 studio albums, 1 live album, and 1 compilation. I wanted to make a decent Donovan Discography, but I didn't have all of his other albums on hand, and some are pretty hard to get at a decent price (especially "Live In Japan: Spring Tour '73"), so sorry for not being an entire discography.

Enjoy!
