You can experience the lawless Wild West as gunslinger Colton White in the action title Gun. Traverse an expansive world where you'll encounter outlaws, Native Americans, corrupt lawmen, and army psychopaths.

Neversoft has emerged from its Tony Hawk days with a high-action Western. But what does the 360 offer that the others don't?

Experience the brutality, lawlessness, greed, and lust, that was the West. When life robs Colton White of all that matters, the only thing left he can trust is his GUN. From award-winning developer, Neversoft, and accomplished screenwriter, Randall Jahnson (The Mask of Zorro, The Doors), GUN follows Colton on his quest for discovery as he seeks to exact vengeful justice on those who have wronged him. GUN is a realistic epic action/adventure that lets gamers experience the brutality of the lawless West.
