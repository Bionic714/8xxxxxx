There are two completely different versions of this album. 

The 1980 version which has a couple more songs but poor production and is basically half-finished (that's the one on the other torrent.

This is the 82 version which in my opinion is much much better. The production is great and the songs are far more fleshed out (they're VERY different from the other version).

One of my favourite bands, and this is one of their best albums.
