Information
------------------------------

At the beginning of the 5th century, Imperial Rome is dying out but Greco-Roman civilization lives on. In the East, many cities will continue to experience flourishing prosperity for almost four centuries.
 
One city tells the story of this moment of history known as "Late Antiquity". It's name is Sagalassos, in Turkey. And therein lies a great paradox of history: when Sagalassos disappears, so too will the Last Romans.
