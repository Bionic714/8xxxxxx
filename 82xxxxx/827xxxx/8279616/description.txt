Kibo ("Brimming with Hope"): Recipes and Stories from Japan's Tohoku

This cookbook is a heartfelt and fascinating tribute to the food, traditions, and courage of the people of JapanΓÇÖs Tohoku region before and after the devastation of the earthquake and tsunami of March 11, 2011. It features traditional recipes such as Miso-Seared Scallops, Pinched-Noodle Soup with Pork, Salmon-Stuffed Kelp Rolls, and basics like rice, stocks, and sauces, along with sake pairings and essays on Japan in recovery from journalists and food writers.

 Kibo was written by Japanese culinary authority Elizabeth Andoh, who was in her Tokyo kitchen when the Great Eastern-Japan Earthquake struck. Over the following months she witnessed the strength of the people of the Tohoku regionΓÇöone of the largest miso- and sake-producing areas in JapanΓÇöas they struggled with the effects of the resulting tsunami and nuclear accident. She was inspired to write Kibo (meaning ΓÇ£brimming with hopeΓÇ¥) to not only tell the story of the food of the Tohoku region but also to document the experiences of its people, both before and after the disaster. This lushly photographed original eBook will honor the region and its rich culture on the first anniversary of the earthquake, with a portion of the proceeds going to Japanese recovery efforts.
