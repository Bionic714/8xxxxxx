Robert Glasper (born April 5, 1978 in Houston, Texas) is an American jazz pianist and record producer. His 2012 album, Black Radio won the Grammy Award for Best R&B Album at the 55th Grammy Awards. Glasper's music can be described as "experiments with space, rhythm and chord textures", creating a vast array of sound. He has said that he tries to make the music flow in a way more like a hip-hop beat, trying to always leave the music open for someone to rap over.
