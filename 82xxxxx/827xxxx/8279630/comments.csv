,bloominoctober,2013-03-20T18:06Z,"If this is, indeed, issue #7, then it's getting posted WAY early.  I suspect, based on the cover image, that this is issue #5.  :-)"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-20T18:14Z,"wrong file name by Zone-Empire, mistake wasn't mine but i didn't catch it. this book is freakin' great, by the way."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-20T18:16Z,"and here's the correct solicitation text:

Captain America (2012) #5

THE ODD WAR OF DIMENSION Z BEGINS! 

Zola's terrible experiments on the indigenous creatures give birth to a terrible new foe! No flesh escapes The Patchwork! Captain America vs. Jet Black, with the fate of Ian in the balance. A young Steve Rogers must help his family to survive their worst year of the Great Depression, but how far will he go?"
,BabiesDontNeedSpleens,2013-03-20T19:31Z,"Hey, I have a question and I'm asking you because I don't wanna sound like many perpetual complainers. Just trying to understand something. On Walking Dead 108, I too had problems with it. All blank pages. I Dled it three times to see. Had this only one time before in all the times using cbr. Saw u didn't from your comments. Any idea why some have that issue but not others?"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-20T20:41Z,"i think 90% of the time, it's something dumb on the user's part. and i don't know that comic rack has more bugs than cdisplayex, but my perception is that it does (based on the number of posts ""this doesn't display in comic rack"").

the legitimate problems, like yours when you're explaining that your problem is repeatable and a rare event, i have no idea where to begin. it could be your hardware, your operating system, your viewer software, your torrent client, the torrent file, or something about the transfer.

we just aren't tech support people."
,phoenixgenesis,2013-03-21T03:23Z,"Yes, this is issue 005. Also, both this issue and The Walking Dead issue 108 work perfectly in CDisplay for Windows and Comic Reader Mobi for Apple mobile devices. Comic Rack does not work for me either on TWD 108. Personally, I never both to use CR as I find its kind of a bloated program. You can always unrar (cbr) or unzip (cbz) the comic and load the individual pages on your big screen TV for viewing as yet another alternative or even read them in calibre."
,BabiesDontNeedSpleens,2013-03-21T10:32Z,"Thanks STFmaryville and phoenixgenesis,

ComiCrack is buggy sometimes, that is for sure. Thanks for the explanation.  Loaded another player and its good to go. The comment on CR being bloated comparatively shows now that I'm comparing. 

Anyhow, I appreciate the time for explanations and alternatives. I should've just slapped it into Calibre but got thinking on CR and what was up. "
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-21T13:41Z,"another problem is this: with many comics, if someone gets a bad or corrupt .cbr/.cbz, they can request, or just go and seek out, a release of the same comic by one of the other groups. (today there appear to be 4 groups: dcp, empire, minutemen, novus, and a few independent persons.) on the walking dead, despite the high demand, there never seems to be anyone other than Zone releasing the series. so if something is wrong with Zone's #108, i can't go find a minutemen or novus version of the same and post it ...  :-("
