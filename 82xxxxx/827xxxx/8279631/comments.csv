,TheRock Squirel,2013-03-24T17:55Z,"Sweet!!! Thank you Jerry
Was checking every week for this...
cheers mate"
[T],ajaxen94,2013-03-25T10:33Z,thank you jerry another surprise will carry on seeding as soon as my download finishes
,TheRock Squirel,2013-03-27T16:57Z,"hi Jerry...FYI, got a call today and have to travel on Friday 29th. As you know I am not a hit-and -run guy...I will continue seeding all Seasons 1-6  in a few weeks when I get back. Many thanks again for all your posts.
Cheers"
[V],TheExecutive,2013-03-29T00:08Z,"Thanks for the upload, but no thanks for seeding this so poorly!  14 GB is too large a torrent -- as with the U.S. banks it needs to be broken up.

This morning I wasn't getting 50 KB / second on download speed. Not it isn't topping half that.

Come on, people!!  Don't make me look for RapidShare links that I may never find...."
[V],TheExecutive,2013-03-29T00:16Z,"Thanks for the upload , but his is  the slowest torrent I've ever seen! Rarely are most of us seeing more than 50 KB /sec downooad speed.

Like the big banks, this needs to broken into smaller parts :  14 GB is too large."
,cindy25,2013-03-30T13:41Z,"u don't need to dl the entire torrent; I already had about half of the eps from another source. 

I agree its too big if its a private torrent, but here it does not matter"
,cindy25,2013-03-30T13:43Z,if anyone has problems getting the actual torrent bcuz of magnet links just google the torrent name and one of the mirror sites will show up
[V],TheExecutive,2013-03-30T23:17Z,"That's OK, Cindy.  I manage to complete the torrent when my friend came back -- twice to seed it to me.

So it only took less than 2 days to get 27 of those 37 episodes that I hadn't seen  vs. what would have otherwise been a full week!"
,cindy25,2013-03-31T19:35Z,"it is the most ridiculous torrent I ever downlaoded; 8 seeders, 23 leechers and the speed is rarely over 5 kb/s now

I don't blame the uploader, but all those getting this torrent who just refuse to seed at all"
[T],jerry7_57,2013-03-31T20:43Z,"Just a note to all potential Wagon Train season 6 downloaders. Please do not be discouraged by the presents of users who believe that by spamming someones torrent their download will mysteriously speed up. I guess they don't know that other users laugh at them for doing this and it gets them nowhere. For everyone else I would like to thank you for your support and keep an eye out for season 7, which will be coming soon."
,TheRock Squirel,2013-04-14T04:50Z,Sweet will be watching for season 7....thank you very much
,charthunter,2013-04-19T10:31Z,Uploaded 602GB of this torrent which is more than 42 times uploaded and still running...
,Swamppony,2013-04-26T09:41Z,Thanks so much! Will leave to seed!
