I cant believe all these producers trying to trick people nowadays in this way... imagine the poor people who actually pays for a movie like this and thinks hes paying for the good one hes seen on trailers =/"
,FelatioSucks,2013-03-20T19:18Z,"not heard of the other one but this sounds terrible. sadly i'll watch anything and everything by Asylum as they're usually terrible and i'm a masochist, so i'm really looking forward to this one. if only it stared Jake Busey it would have been perfect ;p"
,tdurden83,2013-03-21T06:17Z,"is it shitty that they make such atrocious movies to make a quick buck? sure. do people who pay money to buy/rent them right as they're hitting theaters deserve what they get? fuck yes they do! I might have a tiny shred of sympathy for people who waste $ renting them at redbox AFTER the real movies have also been released on dvd, but even then it doesn't take a genius to puzzle out that these are knock offs. a fool and his money..."
,bigghands,2013-03-21T23:39Z,"I can't understand why anyone would want to download this in addition to, or in place of the original ""good"" movie.  The only reasons I can think of are ignorance or someone who just has way too much time on their hands. Oh, and also someone who enjoys being tortured by really shitty movies."
,Hugh_Hef,2013-03-22T01:22Z,I cannot believe this piece of garbage movie actually made the top 100.... What a crock of shit! Who actually downloads torrents without reading the specifics? 
,rfvasquez,2013-05-28T23:56Z,OMG - that had to have been one of the WORST movies I have ever seen!  I can't believe Ben Cross associated himself with that turd.
