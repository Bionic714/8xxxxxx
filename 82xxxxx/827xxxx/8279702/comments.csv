I cant believe all these producers trying to trick people nowadays in this way... imagine the poor people who actually pays for a movie like this and thinks hes paying for the good one hes seen on trailers =/"

I might have a tiny shred of sympathy for people who waste $ renting them at redbox AFTER the real movies have also been released on dvd, but even then it doesn't take a genius to puzzle out that these are knock offs. a fool and his money..."
