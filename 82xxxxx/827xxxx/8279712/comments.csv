,luckyeve,2013-03-27T01:41Z,"I don't care about the fact that it's an Anonymous user, all I care is that I actually tried it, and all you need to do is mount the .mdx file with Daemon Toolz and you can play without installation, it works great, and it saves properly (to the contrary of the other release I had tried)."
,gozinya,2013-03-28T17:18Z,"Works like a charm! No install, no muss, no fuss...thank you!"
,demondp,2013-04-15T12:37Z,Thanks.
,Guichi71,2013-04-25T19:32Z,"The easiest way to play a cracked game: mount the file with Daemon tools or equivalent and voilà. The game works fine with all the DLCs and there's no virus or other scam. 

It also saves correctly (don't look for a save button, it happens everytime you find a new item or a camp) and I just finished it. Huge thanks!"
,d33zy,2013-05-01T10:25Z,"Well its noted that users with ""Skull"" are a bit more ""trusted"". Some files are tracked, you'll usually get a note in your email or a kall from your ISP stating they will terminate your internet and/or ban you... worse kase, a file with goto the Government and you'll be charge a fine. Yup, this is real. So yeah, some turrets only show up to katch ppl. So D/L'ing from Anonymous is ""sorta at your own risk""."
,d33zy,2013-05-01T10:27Z,P.S. Also a bit better to use an IP Blocker while you're using any BitTurret. I use PeerBlock.
,HolyGrimRipper,2013-05-04T19:09Z,The cut-scenes do not work properly?
,SkmanG,2013-05-30T17:51Z,Thanks man. No need to install too. Hype. Full DLC is an extra. Dope. 
,Roguetron,2013-06-08T08:23Z,"Need a little help here. When I started the game for the first time, the game crashes during the first cutscene (Tomb Raider has stopped working). Any ideas?"
