Whirlwind began in 1976 in the back room of Boogie DellΓÇÖs Unit One Rock ΓÇÿNΓÇÖ Roll club in Uxbridge, Middlesex. Boogie Dell is the one and only Dell Richardson of Radio Caroline fame and owner of Fury Records. In those early days the place was un- licensed and you could not purchase alcohol only listen to music.

For many, a band is usually associated with a singer and in the late Nigel Dixon Whirlwind not only had a great singer but an extremely photogenic front man. In Mick Lewis, who had been introduced to rockabilly after seeing his mate Lemmy (yes, the Lemmy who later went on to Motorhead fame) playing with his band at a local venue, Whirlwind  had one of the hottest rockΓÇÖnΓÇÖroll guitarists Britain has ever produced. Phil Foghorn Hardy (Foghorn due to his hollering and shouting whilst playing) was the man on the skins who gave the back-beat to the band in those developing days of the 1970s, when Revival rockΓÇÿnΓÇÖroll was in its infancy. The line up was completed by bass player Chris Emo.
