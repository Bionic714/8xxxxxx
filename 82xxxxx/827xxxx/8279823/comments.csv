,opixio,2013-03-20T20:14Z,"Thank you ! I have been trying to download from TvTeam the hole day and i was up in 33%, this copy took 2 min !"
,zmus,2013-03-20T20:50Z,same here! been stuck at 34% on the other one! thanks so much. please seed on this one people :)
,jc4321234,2013-03-20T22:46Z,Sure thing.  I'm surprised the majority of people on here would rather spend hours downloading an avi file instead of just downloading this flv file and using VLC to play it.  They're still only at 44% on the other one.
,Kalika1,2013-03-21T00:38Z,"Hey jc, FIRST: Thanks 4 the UP, always appreciate ur hard work ;) But I wanted 2 let u know that I'm watchin on my laptop & @ 9:14 it stops playing,not freezes..but stops like the file is done.. I restarted and went to just b4 the same spot...& same thing all 4 times I tried. If I start it again @ 9:20, it'll continue on(so far) but can't b my comp, as it's same thing @ same spot every time. Just thought I'd mention it in case anyone else is havin the same prob? "
,jc4321234,2013-03-21T00:58Z,"I can't recreate the problem on my laptop, the video plays all the way through for me in both VLC and WMP.  The only thing I can suggest is getting another codec pack.  I have the CCCP codec pack and have never had a problem playing any video.  You can get it here http://www.cccp-project.net/"
,Kalika1,2013-03-21T02:22Z,"Hey jc, yah, so far its happened again @ 14:50 as well. Thanks for the advice, much appreciated :) but I have to admit I don't know too much bout programs & codecs. I'm using VLC & it updates automatically when new codec packs are avail...is the pack u r referring to compatible with VLC? Thanks so much for the prompt replies too btw! Quite uncommon on TPB :)"
,Kalika1,2013-03-21T02:46Z,"jc, so my last comment disappeared lol,so again.. thanks so much for the advice & quick reply jc, pretty rare on TPB from the uppers :) I gotta admit I don't have much knowledge bout codecs & programs though so: I have VLC & it automatically updates itself when new codecs are avail...is the pack u specified compatible with VLC? Thanks again ;)"
,jc4321234,2013-03-21T02:59Z,Yes. I use VLC to play all my videos and never had conflicting codec issues.  Hopefully it'll solve the problem you're having with the video
,Kalika1,2013-03-21T03:02Z,"sorry hon, not tryin 2 spam, just figured out that it seems to be happening each time right when there would normally b a commercial break, then it plays fine all the way to the next commercial break, when it happens again...not sure if that helps u or not? or if it just proves I need another codec?"
,Kalika1,2013-03-21T03:23Z,"Dl'd the codec...but still havin the same glitches. All done watchin it now though, so no biggy, just thought I'd let ya know, thanks 4 all ur help :)"
,jc4321234,2013-03-21T04:06Z,"Anytime. Make sure you rebooted the pc after installing the codec pack.  I wish I knew what else the problem could be, cause like I said it plays flawlessly for me.  It's gotta be a conflicting issue with something on your end."
,m7nba,2013-03-21T18:04Z,Thanks man good upload!
,m7nba,2013-03-21T18:22Z,thanks
,Kalika1,2013-03-22T01:41Z,"Jc, (Didn't realize I had 2 reboot ;) duh) Still didnt fix the prob, but for sure must b somethin on my end cause I tried 2 manually update VLC and it updates, then crashes and won't ""take"" the update every time I try, so I'll have 2 keep an eye on it & take 2 my comp guy if any more probs. But thanks again so much 4 takin the time, just wanted 2 confirm 4 u that it is indeed me, not u, lol ;) "
,Tape66,2013-03-23T21:53Z,well dont download it coz it stops half way in when playing it pfff
