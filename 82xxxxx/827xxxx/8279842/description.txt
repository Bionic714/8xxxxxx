Reacting to what he saw as apathy in the Portland music scene, former Pseudosix frontman Tim Perry returns at the helm of his latest project, AgesandAges. Armed with dense, tent revival vocal harmonies and bright country-inflected pop arrangements, the band feels at times like a pastoral version of the Polyphonic Spree, capturing a sense of exuberance and earnestness that has the potential to disarm even the most cynical listeners. This unabashed approach to songwriting makes Alright You Restless a refreshing departure from the waves of murky, detached pop that came in vogue with the rise of chillwave, offering listeners a brighter, more joyous alternative to lead them out of the musical fog. A lot of the credit for this light, effulgent sound goes to AgesandAges' huge seven-member lineup. Despite having so many cooks in the kitchen, the arrangements sound crisp and spontaneous, giving the album a real ΓÇ£in the momentΓÇ¥ feeling that mightΓÇÖve been lost had Perry decided to make this a bedroom recording project rather than a full-band affair. As it stands, the band is able to negotiate its way to a sound thatΓÇÖs dense without ever becoming completely impenetrable, allowing all of the elements to shine through on songs like ΓÇ£So So FreelyΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£Tap on Your Windowpane.ΓÇ¥ In a way, Alright You Restless is an exercise in balance, maintaining enough ebullience to be engaging and uplifting without feeling theatrical or manic. This is a line that AgesandAges walk artfully, making their debut album one thatΓÇÖll leave fans hungry for a follow-up.
