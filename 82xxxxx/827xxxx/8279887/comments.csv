The Gnomoria alpha is now available on Steam through their Early Access program. It’ll continue to work just like it has been with regular updates, except now you can have Gnomoria in your Steam library and use Steam for automatic updates.

I’m currently working on getting Steam keys out to everyone who has already purchased through BMT, Desura and IndieGameStand. So have no fear! it’ll be on its way soon.

You can find Gnomoria on Steam here:
