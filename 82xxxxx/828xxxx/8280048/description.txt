One fine day, a local mafia leader Bhikshu Yadav

of college from its legal heirs. The groups of    횧
Pruthvi and Sashank unite together by forgetting  횤

by assaults of students, Bhikshu Yadav throws a    
challenge to defeat his team in Rugby play to      
win back the land for their college. The rest      
of the story is all about how Pruthvi leads
