Vikings! They came from the North and soon the legends would say that they did not know fear. For hundreds of years they were another name for terror. They sailed icy oceans and narrow rivers striking far inland without warning without mercy. However the truth about the Vikings is far more complex. Much of Europe s traditions technology and institutions come to us from these fierce men of the North. England Germany Russia along with their homeland of Scandinavia all bear the Viking s mark today.
