Retro/Grade is a rhythm game with a unique twist - time is flowing
backwards!  While it looks like a shoot 'em up in reverse, you must
un-fire attacks to the beat of the music while avoiding enemy fire
in order to save the space/time continuum. Otherwise, a temporal
anomaly will rip the universe a new time-hole! It is available now
for PS3 and will be released on Steam on March 20th!

The game features:

* 10 dazzling worlds with unique enemies, epic boss fights,
  and amazing effects
* A campaign with 6 difficulties and 130 different challenge levels
* 11 unlockable ships including characters from other indie
  games like Super Meat Boy and Octodad
* Over 50 minutes of chiptune inspired electronic music by
  Skyler McGlothlin aka Nautilis
* Navigate your ship with a guitar controller! (The PC version
  supports Xbox 360, PS3, and Wii Guitars. The PS3 version only
  supports PS3 compatible guitars)
* An unlockable DJ mode that allows you to mix the tracks
  in the game
