,PrinceVegeta1990,2013-03-22T03:56Z,"Please upload Black Ops 2, you're probably one of the few uploaders I fully trust, not to mention the compressed files are very attractive for how much bandwidth I have."
,smoozable,2013-03-23T02:49Z,kaos are you going to repack shogun 2 gold edition ?? since it contains all up to date DLCs and updates unlike skidrow fall of the samurai release ?? please respond it's not a request just a question ?

Direct-Download-Links.txt
somewhat of a give away; most people just put README, hope you get your skull back, you're one of my favs."
,Jeffbk1,2013-03-25T23:23Z,"these ""unused movies"" that were ripped were the middle of the game or were just credits?"

So I downloaded this torrent, ran the installer, followed the questions, and at he end of the command prompt I hit a key like it told me too, I hit W, and a new line had a message and closed. I don't know what to do next because nothing happens afterwards and I'm sad. Help? :("
