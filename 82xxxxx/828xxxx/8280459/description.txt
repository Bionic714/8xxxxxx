Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site :: On the Wednesday, March 20 edition of The Alex Jones Show, Alex examines the Chase bank glitch that left customers with zero balances, and breaks down why Sen. Feinstein's aggressive gun control bill may have intentionally been doomed to fail. 

Alex also analyzes the prosecution of Dr. Kermit Gosnell, a Philadelphia abortionist charged with snapping the necks of newborn babies with scissors, whose defense says he's being unjustly prosecuted because he's black. 

On today's show, Alex is joined by top researcher Rosa Koire, a veritable expert on the creeping takeover of cities and states under the paralyzing guise of the buzzword "sustainability," and author of Behind the Green Mask: U.N Agenda 21. 

We'll also hit on Obama's trip to Israel, S. Korea's cyber-attack and other key news items.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
