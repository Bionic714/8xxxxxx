Ten Years After is the debut album by the English rock/blues band Ten Years After. It features "Spoonful", a cover that the more famous British blues rock group Cream also covered. The album is also low on original material in comparison to the band's later works which were, in most cases, entirely composed of Alvin Lee's songs.
