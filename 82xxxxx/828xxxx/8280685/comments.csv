,abacus23,2013-03-21T04:34Z,"Please stop complaining PssPss, about      beechyboy's releases.    You never have anything good to say... All you do complain about the smallest thing about the releases.

How about you concentrate more, about labeling your releases CORRECTLY!!  You label many of yours the wrong season and episode.  You have never heard of a mid-season break??  I find it funny, that you think it is a totally new season, all the time.  Yet everyone else who releases it (including the scene, have the correct season/episode)

Start looking in the mirror, before bashing other peoples releases.

Bugger off!"
