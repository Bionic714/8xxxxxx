[V],HighCode,2013-03-26T06:48Z,"I was asked on other site why I didn't add Polish audio track, well, because it is a voice over the original track (hearing the ENG sound as well), 
not original dub made by professional actors.
I never add such crappy tracks in my torrents, they spoil the movie, use subs instead. 
Everyone can make such tracks at home, just record your own voice over the R + L + C channels lol, in Adobe Audition for instance. Cheers"
