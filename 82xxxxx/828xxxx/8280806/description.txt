Some of you asked for it, so all of you get it, it's the torrent of Jane Lui's freebies from March, 2013. It includes the following.

[MP3] Cover: Rainbow Connection
[MP3] Cover: History of Impersonations & HipHop Medley
[MP3] Cover: Crazy For You & Rain Mashup - Madonna
[MP3] Cover: Maroon 5 & Muppets Mashup
[MP3] Cover: Beauty & The Beast (shh..not on YT)
[MP3] Cover: Katy Perry, Mariah Carey, Peanuts Xmas Mashup
[MP3] Cover: Just the way you are - Bruno Mars
[MP3] Cover: I Feel It All - Feist
[MP3] Original: Honda Jingle Submission
[MP3] Original: Southern Winds, YT version
[MP3] Original: Illusionist Boy, YT Zurich version
[MP3] Cover: You Are Not Alone - Michael Jackson

It does not include Heaven On A Hill because that is only available for a limited time at http://janelui.com/ so if you want that you should rush over there while it's still free and hot. Don't worry if you missed it though, because it's more than likely to come out in her next CD release which will be with all her other albums on CD Baby.
