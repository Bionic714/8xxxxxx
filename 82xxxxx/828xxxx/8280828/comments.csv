No, he didn't, he freed Iraq from that bastard Saddam, one day they'll kiss his grave for the 
sacrifice he made...

[V],joshua13,2013-03-22T00:40Z,"iraq  may well be worse off now than under Suddam. They are not free, they are not safe, and they are more a threat to the US and the West than ever. There are ""filthy muslims' but there are far more who are just regular people, harming no one."

That you may think because under Saddam all seemed to be more quiet, there were many murders 'on the quiet', terror, torture, now they have freedom and with freedom come problems, let me have problems as long as I am free, I say...
