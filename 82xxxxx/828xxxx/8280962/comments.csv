,ivurz,2013-03-21T02:18Z,it worked?
,lvsh,2013-03-21T04:37Z,"We need more Seeders! Slow Downloads, pls help out guys."
,imnetec,2013-03-22T19:10Z,"But , what is the content ? all the alp packs ? is max inside ?

cause the latest crack suite version is whitout it ."
,lvsh,2013-03-22T20:24Z,"Most likely the original content, but we will never find out because there is only 1 seeder, probably the guy who uploaded it. 


@imnetec You can get max 4 live on the ableton website. Navigate to Max 4 Live in Ableton, and click download, you're going to have to login in, WAIT for the download to start. 

Futhermore, there are packs here, under the 32 bit version torrent download, read carefully, people gave links out to download M4L packs"
,ChillReb,2013-03-22T23:57Z,Click on Files/23 at the top for the list of files contained ... Though I agree about ever getting it ... i've gotten all of 32mgs in a day and a half ...
,Angeousa Q,2013-03-23T11:59Z,"Seriously no seeders? 121 Leechers, this is laughable."
,amex065,2013-03-23T16:06Z,come on real!!!!!!!
,imnetec,2013-03-23T20:03Z,"lvsh 

thanks for the information , downloading already .. ;)"
,mac.the.ripper,2013-03-24T01:42Z,"@lvsh,

Great if you share when your dl is ready..."
,Vader_1,2013-03-26T01:58Z,I will seed for 200GB but you guys have to keep this torrent Going! Lets all Work together! 
,Angeousa Q,2013-03-26T17:00Z,the seeders only have 21% none has 100% which makes this pretty much dead torrent.
,lvsh,2013-03-26T20:06Z,"@Guys, I wish I had this downloaded, pretty much is dead unless the 1 person who has this continues to seed until another person gets it..

If im able to download ill seed for the next 2 weeks, come on!"
,ektakrome,2013-03-26T22:53Z,"Is the lead person on this torrent even getting online everyday? I've never left a torrent I began seeding until at least I had seeded to a 3.0 ratio. And then I get back on a day or two later.

We need some SEEDERS on this. Come on Mr. Anon, get your self online. ;-)"
,pepe4,2013-03-27T02:34Z,How can i get Max for Live 6.1 x32 ?
,wharfrat22,2013-03-31T01:52Z,Seed Please...thank you.

,wharfrat22,2013-04-01T04:33Z,"7117, you rule! Thanks for the pointing that out and posting a link.  This torrent has been killing me.  "
,nbmatt,2013-04-02T03:00Z,"@7117: Thanks for that link, man! I was sad that this torrent couldn't pick up steam (although that's pretty much to be expected with such a big torrent). Once I manage to grab all the packs in those URLs I'll spread them out over a few separate torrents so they'll be easier to keep alive than one massive one.

Well, if I can remember to, that is, haha. "
,7117,2013-04-04T21:00Z,all greetings goes to   ''ireadonce ''®
