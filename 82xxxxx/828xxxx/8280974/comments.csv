[V],TorrentTracts,2013-03-22T02:48Z,"Hey cddude25.  Nice to meet ya.

Just glancing over your list, many of those titles aren't necessarily 2013 releases, right?  If that's the case, then the only way I would torrent them is if I had enough of any particular artist to create a discography.  I don't torrent individual albums anymore.

So maybe, minus the 2013 titles, you can highlight some of your more sought after titles so I can focus on those discographies first."
