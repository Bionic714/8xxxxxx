,AsifAkheir,2013-03-24T10:35Z,"I translated the machine subtitles into English actually spoken by humans. The film makes sense now.

This is for 24 FPS video. It should work for this one. Re-title it to match exactly this title except for .srt extension and it will load automatically.

,rollacansada,2013-03-24T23:38Z,"Sorry pal, your translation into English is pure CRAP. Makes absolutely NO SENSE!!"
,rollacansada,2013-03-24T23:44Z,"Sorry Pal, your English translation SUCKS!  IT MAKES NO SENSE
NO FUCKING GOOD!!!"
,AsifAkheir,2013-03-25T01:10Z,"@ rollacansada
Which video version (Frames Per Second) do you have? Which encoder/uploader?
What media player are you using and how are you loading the subtitles? "
,cinesimon,2013-03-25T21:28Z,"Better English subs here:

And rollacansada, you are a spoiled little brat.
How about you add something to the community instead of whining because someone's subtitle work is not to your childish expectations."
,AsifAkheir,2013-03-26T06:33Z,"@ cinesimon 
Thanks for posting the link to the other subs. The translator, traceone, must have had a more comprehensive French version to work with, or he may actually understand the Danish dialogue. Hats off to him - it adds detail and atmosphere to the one I did. I'm happy to have confirmed by him that my version is far from being what rollacansada claims it is. (I think he's just exercising his democratic right to have an unfounded opinion)"
,cinesimon,2013-03-28T02:53Z,A Asif - indeed indeed.
,cinesimon,2013-03-28T02:55Z,"Actually at the link I posted, a Danish person said he corrected the corrected sub even more-so - here's his version. Probably until a retail sub shows up, this is the best one.

,cinesimon,2013-03-28T21:03Z,"One last post, for those who want a decent 720p rip with retail English subtitles - look for the below release - the hard-coded subtitles are off the blu ray:

The Hunt 2012 720p subbed BRRiP XViD AC3-MAJESTiC"
