Who am I to ask them why?
This pit may live that pit must die?
They say but Sir its economics.
That's juggling by financial comics.
What maxim has the NCB?
The miner's lot or LSD
And further Sir it can be said
A pit must die if in the red
Be this so I must resent
This anti-social precedent
So until the happy day
When every pit can pay its way
You cannot Sir rebuke the tide
Or get away with Pitracide!
                      - Jock Purdon


This album is full of poignant, humourous and powerful lyrics. The songs conjure up many memories for me and are also very relevant to the political struggles of today.
