If you are updating from previous CS:S version, you must add to rev.ini (placed in game dir) strings:

[Loader]
ProcName = hl2.exe -steam -game cstrike -appid 240 -novid

And replace this string:

SteamDll = ./bin/Steam/Steam.dll

To this:

SteamDll = ./Steam/Steam.dll

Then turn off antivirus and run updater. Enjoy."
