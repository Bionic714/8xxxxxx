,Alyusha2214,2013-03-21T03:42Z,is this real?
,Maethren,2013-03-21T04:29Z,"probably real... but it's an mkv file, so I can't watch it... 2 mkv players and neither of them keep sync or play smooth video"
,KylleX,2013-03-21T04:32Z,"Slow download is slow, seed please? 2.3k dl atm."
,cypars,2013-03-21T05:09Z,it's real! good quality too
,ransit,2013-03-22T06:28Z,best vid player is VLC.  and just make sure you have NOOO other programs running in the background when watching.  most computers now a days can play them and keep sync.  sounds like you need more ram in your life! heh
