,sharpshot94549,2013-03-21T07:21Z,this would be great...if the game ever gets cracked...which is seeming more and more unlikely due to the always online BS from EA
,YuriSH,2013-03-21T08:49Z,"This guide has very bad quality.
Its Just scan in pdf. Text doesnt recognized.
Where are other formats, like EPUB and MOBI."
,chanthanuthly,2013-03-21T16:45Z,@szkod lolzz are you a noob in computer programming ?? xD you know what ? i've just terminated your cool legal software department!! xD such easy peasy piece :D
,youngdaddytc,2013-03-22T22:56Z,"Thank you for this upload Tairom.  as there is currently no alternative strategy guide, this is the best for now.  however the quality is lacking, like YuriSH said:  it looks like it came off a scanner then the photos combined into a PDF.  it's a bit fuzzy, and hard to read.  But while we await a crack and perhaps a better guide, this one is appreciated.  "

,mushrox,2013-03-25T01:19Z,What's with all the idiots spamming their ad links?  Are there really that matter stupid people going to them and going through the motions? O_o
,nisse_123,2013-03-29T14:57Z,"this guide (not the real printed one) is a joke.. low quality scans, some pages upside down, pages are in incorrect order

I have the printed one, but was looking for an offline version readable on the computer or AndroidPad (or Kindle), which is not included in this torrent.. Not worth the 2 minutes of downloading time.. Get the eGuide for $4.99 or the printed one for $20"
,Panzer-Front-Maniac,2013-03-30T09:02Z,"Okay, I know this isn't the right place to ask this but, Has anyone cracked this game yet?"
,ApesGrandson,2013-04-21T08:01Z,Horrible quality.
