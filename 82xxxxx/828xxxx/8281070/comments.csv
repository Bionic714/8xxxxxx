,leo491,2013-03-22T18:27Z,"eshborn, 
how did you manage to install without the crack?"
,pierce368,2013-03-23T01:57Z,I think its pre cracked because I didnt need to do anything except run it and hit next. All the scenery shows up.

but it is working i just put a different _PRO file in-there and it worked :)  

thank you great share"
,roume666,2013-03-23T18:55Z,Is there any chance of getting FlightBeam KPHX and LatinVFR Bermuda on here. As far as Bermuda there is one on here but it is a bad upload.. Thanks in advance....
,pierce368,2013-03-25T05:09Z,"The flightbeam scenery is tough because it uses the same addon manager as the fsdt sceneries. I have a bunch of the fsdt stuff purchased but it looks as if one can not simply upload the scenery and texture folders since they are pretty empty. They use a common library which is run by the addon manager and couatl. That is why you don't see any of the fsdt or flightbeam products here (gsx, kdfw, kphx) The ksfo one is simply the trial but am not 100% on that. As far as the Bermuda scenery, there is this one as well  http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8023795/LatinVfr_TXKF_Bermuda but I haven't been able to try it since it has 0 seeders and no comments."
