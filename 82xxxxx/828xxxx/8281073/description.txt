Steamfunk #0
Publisher:  Button Mash Productions
Publication Date:  May 2012

By Eric Doty and Luke McKay

Steamfunk is the first publication by Button Mash Productions inc. It's an all ages comic that includes a bit of steampunk, a pinch of diesel punk, western, and fantasy. Its biggest influences are The Wizard of Oz and Firefly. The "funk" in the title serves a dual purpose referring to the musical references throughout the story as well as the state of the world the characters exist in. The story will follow the adventures of a gutsy delivery girl, Deaux, as she unravels truths that she may not be prepared for.
