The *only* files you should use from the crack folder are the SkyrimLauncher.exe and TESV.exe. 

The included steam_api.dll and steam_rld.ini shouldn't be used IMO and I would suggest using the steam_api.dll from Update 9 or 10 and use that. The one i use is 118k in size and works perfectly with this update. The steam_api.dll in this release and the last Reloaded Skyrim update 11 is about 175k and gives off virus warnings. I'm using NOD32 btw.

I even had to swap out/delete the DLL and INI that are included in the crack for The Walking Dead Survival Instinct. It contains the same steam_api.dll and steam_rld.ini files and again, IMO, they shouldn't be used. I swapped my good steam_api.dll from Skyrim and used that and the game loaded right up and works fine.

These recent releases by Reloaded are starting to worry me though. There is no reason to include such a bloated and untrustworthy steam_api.dll or steam_rld.ini. Especially when an old steam_api.dll (118k) works fine and doesn't set off any alarms."
