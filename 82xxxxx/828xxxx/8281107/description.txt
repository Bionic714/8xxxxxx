Known for catchy tunes, impeccable dance performances, and those long legs, Girls' Generation has become one of the most successful Korean pop groups in Japan. Now, their first concert tour - covering six venues with 14 shows attended by a total of over 140,000 fans - is coming on home video! In addition to the Japanese covers of Korean hits like Gee, Genie, and Hoot, Japan First Tour Girls' Generation also features performances of original Japanese tunes from SNSD's first Japanese album, including Mr. Taxi and The Great Escape.
