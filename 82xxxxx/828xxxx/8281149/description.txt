*  The La's cover tune



Though he's describing the weather when he says it's as "hot as the devil's 
asshole," Pearl Jam vocalist Eddie Vedder could just as well be talking about this amazing show, one of the most remarkable from this tour. The bluesy "Of the Girl" starts the show, and is one of five tunes from Binaural in the set, including "Grievance," "Light Years," "Insignificance," and the first live performance of "Sleight of Hand" during the encore. The encore, despite what sounds to be a briefly dropped drumstick during "Black" and a noticeable lack of any bass in "Evolution," is one of the best the band has done, mixing crowd-pleasing favorites with an obscure cover like "Timeless Melody" by power pop one-hit wonders the La's. Whether the crowd is inspired by the excellent performance or the band is responding to the enthusiastic crowd, Vedder proclaims that "so far, this is the best crowd," a compliment he doles out infrequently. --Adem Tepedelen



This live show proves that the band are quite the juggernaut when it comes 
to the live arena. Over the 27 tracks Matt Cameron shows that heΓÇÖs the right man for the drummerΓÇÖs seat. Where Abruezze was sloppy, Cameron is a steamroller. Where Jack Irons was stiff, Cameron is loose. Tracks like the radio-worn "Alive" have incredible new life breathed into them in the concert hall, and you can feel the emotion of the crowd heighten when the band rolls out powerful versions of "Wishlist" and "Given To Fly." Vedder is most affective when heΓÇÖs almost at the end of his throat-tearing rope, as heard on the ferocious "Habit." Mike McreadyΓÇÖs more than large encore nod to Jimi Hendrix with "Yellow Ledbetter" sends the crowd home wishing that this show had never ended. ΓÇöTim Melton
