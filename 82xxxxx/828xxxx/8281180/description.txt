Doctor Who - 1970 - 1974
Entire run of the third doctor portrayed by Jon Pertwee. Most of the serials were taken from this torrent, "http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6699564/Doctor_Who_1963-1989". The rest are my own DVD rips with the exception of The Ambassadors of Death and Terror of the Autons. 

Episodes were reenoded with h264 @ 1000 kbps to make the size more manageable, 175 megabyte files versus the originals which were around 350 megabytes. Also some of the episodes were interlaced which i fixed. All the DVD rips have a resolution of 640x480 encoded with h264 @ 1000 kbps.
