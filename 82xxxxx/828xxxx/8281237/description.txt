Information
------------------------------

Ten years after the invasion of Iraq, retired headteacher, Geoff Dunsmore, travels to Basra to see exactly where his son Chris, an RAF reservist, was killed in 2007. Whilst there he aims to find out the impact of the war and occupation on the lives of the ordinary people there. Has the western involvement in Iraq improved things for ordinary Iraqi people? Accompanied by his local guide, Geoff hears firsthand what life was like under the dictator Saddam Hussein. He visits a rundown primary school that British troops tried to help during the occupation and hears from a man who claims 12 of his family were killed when American soldiers opened fire on his vehicles. For the most part, with the country still suffering from terrorist violence, the repercussions of the conflict have been devastating and long lasting. Yet on the streets of Basra Geoff also meets a group of young people who have grown up knowing nothing but war but believe that they can build a different future in Iraq today.
