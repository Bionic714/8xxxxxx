,HeinzErnest,2013-03-21T18:33Z,Can someone please comment on the movie.. Worth watching or crap?
,nexxun,2013-03-21T20:07Z,wicked comedy .. spoilers .. lookout for her teeth
,chihaiacosmin,2013-03-21T20:25Z,second hand movei. movie director must have 5 years old
,iversonali3,2013-03-21T21:06Z,"Movie is a total waste of time and bandwidth. Don't let the IMDB score fool you.
"
,iversonali3,2013-03-21T21:06Z,Take a look at the trailer on youtube.
,croachster,2013-03-22T00:52Z,The fact that this is number 1 on the top 100....WOW. Worst dry spell ever. It was cool getting everything earlier for Oscar season but dam this sucks.
,Poooop123,2013-03-22T01:14Z,Wwwooowwww.... this movie is absolute garbage. Pretty obvious the only people that have voted for this movie on IMDB were people involved in making it. Just another generic lame horror that's been done a million times already.
,KracKils,2013-03-22T02:00Z,"I attempted to resist getting this one but the IMDB rating has me curious. Worse case scenario it's a horrible movie.

Thanks"
,jex1138,2013-03-22T03:09Z,Yeh that 9.3 popped my curiosity for all of about 15 secs. Clearly IMDB should ban the parents of actors from voting.
,dlarrym1111,2013-03-22T04:14Z,"DO NOT trust that 9.3. That is based on the ratings of only 11 people!!!! 11, that it. . . Not much data to go on. I haven't watched it, but will wait to see what happens to that rating in the next few weeks. I have not heard of any of the cast or the Director or producers, so I will wait and see, OR NOT see. HA HA HA, I know a bad pun.
take care all"
,RizoT100,2013-03-22T05:36Z,WTF is this fucking total sack of shit doing at the top 100? :( total waste of time don't bother....NEXT PLEASE...thanx for the UL tho.
,darkko,2013-03-22T07:07Z,"this seriously is the worst dry spell EVER! 

what is this stank turd from a homeless man's crusty, diseased butthole doing on the top 100?!?

on that note, i watched the trailer and it looks pretty fucking awful. 

anyone brave enough to endure this brain enema care to report on it's worth?

take it sleazy y'all!"
,rdq32,2013-03-22T07:33Z,"9.3 on imdb out of 11 people!!
LOL
So I don't really take that as an accurate measure...
Post if this movie is good or not, please...."
,Pseudoplaydo,2013-03-22T08:02Z,Its always the shit movies that get early torrents. IMDB has a score 9.3 but with like 10 votes. Just internet self-boosting producers. Don't waste your time on this shit.

,madc0wdisease,2013-03-22T13:47Z,"Perhaps the Pirate Bay is one of those sites where you can pay your way to the top of the list?  I know if I had spent a bunch of money to make a movie and it wasn't getting a lot of attention, I would absolutely pay a bit more to put it at the top of the torrent charts and I try to convince people to go to IMDB.com to rate it highly."
,rustdroid,2013-03-22T14:30Z,Checked the trailer looks crap not going to bother with this one!
,ryumartin,2013-03-22T15:29Z,"I have already down vote 1 to this crap on IMDB, because there is no option that has point less more"
,smoker05,2013-03-22T15:44Z,Shit Movie !
,Kickyoash,2013-03-22T20:45Z,"Right now the IMDB score on this is higher than ""Pulp Fiction"" ?? LOL ..reviewed by 11 people , The director and his family !!!"

,Rush,2013-03-22T23:06Z,"The top 100 isn't based on how good a movie is or isn't, it's based on activity and activity only [seed + leech.] 

You all HAVE to be Obama voters...
Fucking MORONS.... Jaysus
"
,gsacmofo,2013-03-23T02:24Z,"LOL at the comments, I will heed warning and not DL.  And thank you Rush for speaking the truth, top 100 is for top seed/leech torrents not for movie artistic quality or anything all you bag of dicks out there.  Nonetheless thanks scene4all for your time, I'm sure the quality is excellent."
,skyspire,2013-03-23T02:56Z,"i agree this is a shit movie, i couldn't get past the first 30 minutes.. terrible B movie acting, bad script"
,caffinate,2013-03-23T02:57Z,"When the plot line starts with ""A Group of teenagers...."" you already know the movie is trash."
,darkko,2013-03-23T03:36Z,"""top 100 is for top seed/leech torrents not for movie artistic quality or anything.""

to Rush and gsacmofo, you donkey fucking dipships...

NO DUH! no one ever said the top 100 was based on artistic merit, so go lick the last bits of semen off your transgendered daddy's transplanted cock and spit it into your sister's infected cooch so you can inbreed half-tards who can continue the super duper intelligent comments you leave here on the bay. 

CHEERS!"
,gloin1981,2013-03-23T03:57Z,"If you want a descent rating go to rotten tomatoes

,Getabrain,2013-03-23T10:22Z,"For those who are uncertain between the high ratings (certainly from the cast) and the bad reviews, I found this movie totally watchable. The acting & the story are ok, it is a little scary but not so much. I give it a 6 rating."
,b15h0p74,2013-03-23T14:21Z,shit movie! Pic quality not god also.
,Rush,2013-03-23T21:39Z,"@darkko Well here's one, ASS CLOWN... [read em all the time] where the FUCK have you been? [Comprehension is hard]

,lightsg,2013-03-25T01:57Z,Terrible movie. It is like watching exorcist again. Even the logo of the movie is the same almost the same crappy image as the exorcist. Both of them are piece of shit. Wasted 10 minutes plus the download in my life time. 
,DrMD,2013-03-25T02:03Z,"A/V=9 M=4 this movie kind of lame following a trend of recent horror movies, the only thing they do scary is all of a sudden the thing you're looking at moves extremely quickly up to you, ""that all you got"" sheesh seen it!"
,maximumdistance,2013-03-25T15:34Z,"You who have now seen the movie should go and rate it on IMDB so those 11 people who put it at 9.3 doesn't influence people who are on the fence to actually see it.
I haven't seen it yet myself but I was going to when I saw the IMDB rating but then I saw the comments here and I probably trust you guys more than those 11 people so I won't waste my time on this"

,Obamaroid,2013-03-30T15:55Z,"It is apparent that many of you need to be downloading Sesame Street or a similar program to grasp a fundamental understanding of how to use language as an adult without appearing to be mentally retarded. This movie is a little better than a SYFY Original, but hardly. If Hollywood had an enema this would be the result, it is absolute shit. "
,Obamaroid,2013-03-30T15:58Z,"this movie is in the top 100 based on traffic, not quality, and sure as hell not because someone payed to have their POS movie placed on a top 100 list for PIRATED movies so 11 people would vote on IMDB. I have never heard something so fucking stupid before in my life ""madc0wdisease"". You must have mad-cow disease you fucking lemming. "
