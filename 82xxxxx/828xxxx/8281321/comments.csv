,N0va111,2013-03-28T05:35Z,"Zombies does NOT work.  Compaign does work.  Any1 know if there's any multiplayer abilities?  With or without st.e.am.

Basic directions are get it, figure out how to get giant dvdlike iso image on computer 'mounted'. Directions are inside that image, but basically install and copy over files from folder to where u put the game. then run t6sp.  sp = single player.  Pay 4 game if u enjoy and can afford it to support developers.
if you get stuck, don't immediately comment and ask, try g-oogling ur questions and learn.  It's a very common procedure."
