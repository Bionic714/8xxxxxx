[V],psspss,2013-03-21T08:36Z,"true someone will... I suspect it show up tomorrow or 12 hours time AFG will have one out

is it not another one of those goddified shows
and make believe science"
,oithatguyoi,2013-03-21T09:26Z,"its a great science show with Morgan Freeman hosting it !! i believe this new episode is about the Higgs Boson. it has nothing to do with god just science!! thanks for the reply !! And if i am correct i believe Morgan believes that mankind just made up god, so i dont think he believes in it either."
[V],psspss,2013-03-21T09:59Z,dont think so watch his ghost story and your see hes come from a very religious background.. also those pushing the big bang theory are all misguided.. this idea of a finite universe .. why cant the universe always exist and be endless.. its all based on red shift and distances.. and they ignore all the problems with it.. watch whats wrong with the big bang theory.. if you keep basing science on a false understanding it just gets to be more messy and wrong.. they try to fix their model with dark matter and energy for movement of gravity and galaxies

,oithatguyoi,2013-03-21T12:21Z,cool i'll check the link out !! i'm always opened minded to new theories and ways of thinking .. thats what science is based off of until proven !!
,oithatguyoi,2013-03-21T12:24Z,i found it on youtube so i will watch it there since no one is seeding ..
[V],psspss,2013-03-21T12:28Z,:O
[V],psspss,2013-03-21T12:32Z,my friends unified universe book is coming along.. v5 is on p2p still one seeder it says.. but hes rewritten it to make it more understandable.. he was doing a document for it but i never see him complete it. hes pulling together some of the other theories together in a complete model thats being ignored by main stream cos its goes against the god model... using fractual maths/density etc hes model fits with everything from earths spin to atom models and weather patterns and galaxy rotations. I see if I can get his new rewrite so far and upload it

more recent debunk..

also if you take an atom and slam it at faster and faster speeds surely its going to cause energy packets to spin off in all directions.. like if you hit a electron hard enough it will for a fraction cause it to spin the other way.. hence why anti gravity is BS as well. all the bS that we can detect these small particles.. with machines surely brings in ghost results.. what happens with the small fragments that could pass through the gaps in the sensors

its like taking a car and every faster speed and smash it break it up into smaller fragments.. oh here is a new particle.. nope its just a smaller bit of the blinker..

god particles.. what rubbish"
,oithatguyoi,2013-03-22T01:40Z,alright sounds cool .. let me know if there are any more documentaries i should check out 
[V],psspss,2013-03-22T02:30Z,"IM about to upload a new UFO bundle ive added some other alternative science in it as well

but I often put some other stuff like free energy and oddities in the UFO bundles and paranormal cos I feel theres some over lapping in all the sciences

but your see what Im saying.. Disc chan and his chan are very bias tv shows on science BBC sometimes gives alternative insights view points but thats kinda corrupted on main stream stuff as well.. 

the best stuff comes from fringe areas in the community

theres a great series I once upload called the Herectic which coverted PK energy to vitamin C
also floride deception is interesting most people will have these as they have followed my uploads since 2005:)"
[V],psspss,2013-03-22T02:32Z,"i mean covered PK to.. blah LOL tired again.. 4am bed time

also I shared pretty much every paranormal show from around the world only the usa main stream ones are down on p2p but hard to find UK, AUS/nz and canada ones I did

and I shared on Demonoid only so most of it gone now.. but half of it survived on tpb"
[V],psspss,2013-03-22T05:19Z,"just added

,oithatguyoi,2013-03-22T10:46Z,downloading your Are We Alone - Alien Encounters right now .. 
[V],psspss,2013-03-22T11:04Z,"are ok.. read the books too? not as nice as zombie watch a show though but atleast hes got photos /diagrams explaining the parts

Im beat.. Im going to relax and watch some of the rips myself.. in last 2 days. sorted out 20gb of stuff! and no time to watch myself.. 

so im tired and making mistakes now..

nite"
[V],psspss,2013-03-23T14:12Z,"I mean anti-matter above not gravity as well

as I said if you whack particles fast enough in to a atom you will sometimes interrupt the spin of it and stop it and even cause it to rotate the other direction
for a few billionth of a nano second

so why couldnt it look like new particles"
