He spent yesterday collecting space debris to sell.

He woke up this morning crashed on an Earth that shouldn't exist.

He has no idea how he got there, what he's doing, or what the bloodthirsty orcs who are screaming for his death are saying.

He's a prophet's pawn, a potential savior, an average guy cyborg of a 35th-century stellar colony.

He's Derek, and he really wants to know what's going on.


Reviewer:

"Cyborgs versus Orcs.

ThatΓÇÖs what I tell my wife that this book is about whenever she asks. Nanites, power suits, superhuman strength and intelligence versus hordes of raging orcs armed with crude weapons and dark magic. Okay, thatΓÇÖs not completely accurate. ThereΓÇÖs only one cyborg, at least until the assimilating begins, and while there are plenty of orcs, most of the fights are against the same one. So, maybe ΓÇ£cyborg versus orcΓÇ¥ would be more accurate.

Still, with a premise like that, thereΓÇÖs a lot of fodder for great stories, once you consider what else would be in a world that produces orcs and cyborgs: AIs and computers and starships, vampires and wizards and necromancy. And what happens when you combine them: orcs who can sense radio signals, flying humans created by technology? Robert Sier has managed to find a place for all of these things in his book, and the only question is with so much material, where do you begin."
