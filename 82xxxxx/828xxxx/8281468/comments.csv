,ChasUGC,2013-04-05T06:32Z,I wonder if this one gets all blurry at the end? Anyone?
,njvfc34,2013-04-09T10:12Z,"Good movie if you want to sit back and wonder what's around all the fuzzyness. Color Sucks, Fuzzy as hell,, Bit rate is good though. If you want to actually watch this movie, Wait for a better upload. I normally love Reaper but This one is horrible.... no offense man.... I love your normal uploads...."
