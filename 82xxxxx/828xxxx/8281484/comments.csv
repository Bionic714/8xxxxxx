I just want to appreciate all the work that you and PublicHD Team has done all the way through this and ALL the series ups.

I say this because for me that live in Latin America, even with cable television, I don't have the international CBS or other channels that theses series come to be transmitted. So TPB and PublicHD is the ONLY WAY AT ALL that I can watch these series... else I can wait about more than a year or more to see if the Warner Channel here in Brazil will transmit the series. And just for you to know, here, The Mentalist it still at season 4 to be transmitted =/

So I want to really thank you and all the PublicHD Team and the TPB to help us out there to find a way to 'see the light'.

Thank you!! :)

Ps: I will be seeding all the episodes at least 1.100 per episode."
