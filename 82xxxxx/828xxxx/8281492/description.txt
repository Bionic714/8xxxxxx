Streamline Job Processing with Rules-Based Automation
PRINERGY Rules-Based Automation is a licensable component for PRINERGY Software, offering truly intelligent automation. Rules-Based Automation allows you to specify simple but powerful rules that basically tell the system that if event X occurs, perform action Y. Rules-Based Automation runs in the background, and as soon as a specified event occurs, it immediately triggers the specified action. The possibilities are limited only by the number of events your system can ΓÇÿseeΓÇÖ and the number of ΓÇÿactionsΓÇÖ it can perform.

Rules-Based Automation allows you to create automatic rules for any existing manual event, business process, or daily step in your printing production workflow. As a result, you can organize all stages of print production, enabling your business to run much more effortlessly.
