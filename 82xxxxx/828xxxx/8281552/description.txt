Pictorial symbols are, in some respects, superior to words as a form of communication. If well-designed, they can be understood by people of all different cultures and can be recognized by children literally years before they learn to read. As a result, symbols are of the utmost importance to graphic designers and their ever-present challenge to create effective visual communication for their clients. This mini-collection of designs drawn from 1000 Icons, Symbols + Pictograms provides a catalog of ideas for designers to look to for inspiration
