,Nuhlie,2013-04-26T23:11Z,"For those who dl then see that ""w00t.exe"" (which is keygen) is missing, you have to disable all antivirus programs BEFORE you download as after you download the antivirus will automatically remove the .exe.

After you download, follow the readme.txt and then you can update to 1.75 without any problems.


Thanks cyclo for the upload"
