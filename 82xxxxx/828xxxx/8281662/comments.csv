,Hanne70,2013-03-21T13:24Z,"Where were you when the world ended? Josh McManus, a traveling salesman with a history of violence, was passing through a dusty West Texas town. The right man at the wrong time, Josh foiled a robbery perpetrated by The Barbarians, an outlaw biker gang led by a vicious man named Hawg.

Then it happened. An unnatural flash in the sky, followed by a crippling series of earthquakes, throws the entire world into chaos. Is it the long-awaited event called The Rapture? Josh doesn’t care. His only goal is to get home to his family, but he’ll have to fight his way through the Barbarians to do so. It will be a dangerous journey to the very center of his soul."

Wow! That's some awful shit :)

Mockery of these right wing hoo-doo weasels aside, i really do appreciate HeroMaster's efforts. Got several HeroMaster releases seeding now, in fact. 

Won't be seeding THIS [it's no 'Holyman Undercover' :) ], but i still sincerely appreciate the effort."

,charley0,2013-03-23T15:03Z,"I rarely write comments about the movie itself, however in this case, I watched the beginning and parts, and skipped to the end, and then deleted the entire film, it is nothing less than christian propaganda DISGUISED as sci-fi. "

,BBQSource,2013-03-24T10:44Z,"That cover is so misleading I can't even begin..

charley0 is almost spot on, this is just Christian propaganda, really badly produced Christian propaganda at that. It's not even disguising itself as science fiction.

Best recommendation was ""avoid like the plague""."
,mattman21,2013-03-24T14:52Z,"please don't bother watching this steaming pile of christian bullshit propaganda, unless that's your thing i guess.

What is it with Christians liking shitty movies/acting/writing?"

,libertaswv,2013-03-24T21:43Z,"it's called 'wingnut welfare', mattman. 

These people are so pathetically immersed in their own religiosity that they can't function in the 'outside' world. Can't get along with people... Can't accept anything that isn't equally soaked in the same delusion... Can't stop proselytizing (and getting shit for it)....So, they bail.

They bail on the rest of the world and live their lives exclusively with people like themselves. An ""artist"" (i use the term loosely, as none of these people are exactly the 'a' team) can tour...sell books... make movies... albums... book speaking engagements... you name it. The audience is always the same small religious minority (waaaay right wing christian), but it's enough to make a living. The audience is guaranteed loyal, and you can be as nutty as you want to be within the protected little bubble of your fellow nuts.

Like the uber-loon Kirk Cameron. The world at large might think 'Gosh... He was one boring, average actor... No wonder he never got any work after 'Growing Pains'.'  Members of the whackadoodle christian world though, might say 'Oh... Mr. Cameron? Oh goodness me, such a talent... I just LOVED his work in 'Left Behind' and 'Tribulation Force'

(lol @ 'Tribulation Force' ... soon as i read it i got an image of cameron dressed as the pink power ranger with a cross on his chest. Go, Tribulation Force, go! Tribulation Powers... Activate!! Form of.. An asshole!')

The audience for this crap LOVES supporting it. They breathlessly discuss how superior 'their' movies are to 'Hollyweird's' movies, and aren't they just wonderful for watching 'godly' movies/tv. Smug, self-satisfied smiles all around. There are even some wealthy christian nuts that buy up cases of contemporary christian books in order to send them - however temporarily - to the top of monthly book sale lists. Then they can ""honestly"" advertise their nonsense with taglines like 'Buy the runaway hit novel...straight from the NY Times bestseller's list... It's Insert-Crazy-Christian-Book-Title-Here!'

Sure, it's misleading and dishonest, but hey... As always... Anything one does in support of one's 'god' is a-ok and perfectly justifiable (according to them).

So... Not that you were really asking, lol... but that's basically it. It's not that they 'like' crap, technically - but they religiously support a whole industry of crap because they share the same magic man in the sky. Their audience knows that if they buy the shit they'll make more shit for them to buy, and working together they will all - artists and audience alike - 'spread the word' of their imaginary friend to all us poor, lonesome heathens. 

Sure, it was a book designed to centralize power and control the masses, honed over centuries, originally written by a bunch of ignorant, superstitious, misogynistic men in the middle east circa the bronze age, but hey... Wouldn't want to be devoted to any OTHER silly book written by ignorant, misogynistic men thousands of years ago. 'Cause that would be nuts. lol

If parents didn't inflict this shit on their kids from the time they're born it would die a richly deserved death, but... alas. Science, reason and decency are slowly gaining ground, but as long as this crap is tied up in kids love for their parents/families it will keep clinging on, cursing one generation after another. 

So... anyway... yeah.... 'wingnut welfare' ... that's how i've heard the sales/crap media thing described. 

ps - Just looked up 'Tribulation Force'... ""After the Rapture and the revealing of the identity of the Antichrist, a group of converts form the Tribulation Force, a secret society with the sole purpose of converting non-believers to Christianity. ""

Fuckin assholes."

Yes, it's an extreme-right, end of days, christian crap, underlying plot.  But, I kind of liked the movie.  Except for the sequel part at the end.  I would have to say no to that, and so a solid 3/10 on the iMDB since rapture loving christians expect me to pay for another one just to see what happens.  

I'd say skip it until the next one comes out and then, maybe give it a shot."
