,tarzanscousin,2013-03-22T03:16Z,"Installer is in Russsian, I assume...all I see are weird characters because I don't have the alphabet for whatever it is installed. I have no idea what it says so I can't install whatever this is, thanks for nothing."
,aprilmoon,2013-03-22T15:12Z,"So uploader is ""trusted"" but he doesn't respond to issues with his torrent? I start to suspect that he earned this ""trust"" badge posting someones else torrents without even checking them first."
,CivilShark,2013-03-22T18:31Z,"There's no english strings in the files, meaning it is by no means English/Russian. Too much of a hassle to try and correct everything to english, might as well download all the DLCs seperately."
,bonethugnharmony,2013-04-11T19:29Z,"FUCK RUSSIA AND FUCK GHOSTNET, WHY DOWNLOAD THIS PIECE OF SHIT WHEN IT´S IN ENGLISH @ 5.12gb, FUCK THIS 8.7....I GOT THE Razor 911 AND IT´S ONLY 5.12GB, THEN I GOT THE TEXTURE PACK @ 3.15GB. THAT ALONE MAKES THIS FUCKING TORRENT A JOKE. JUST LIKE ALL FUCKING RUSSIANS. THEY ARE USELESS !!!!!!"
