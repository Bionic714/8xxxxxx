The Delta Bombers are a bunch of wild youg guys (all early 20s) from the wasteland they call Las Vegas.

They scared the pants off of Dusty and his boys which was a sure fire sign that wild records had to sign them up for Wild records. and they all rock like the devil.Steaming and boppin Rockabilly!!!
