Kacey MusgravesΓÇÿ Mercury Records debut album is everything a new artist dreams her first record will be. ΓÇÿSame Trailer Different ParkΓÇÖ is well-written, edgy (yet familiar) and coated in ΓÇ£cool.ΓÇ¥ Musgraves is an original who at age 24 is surprisingly wise and adept at using her voice to share her experiences. 

The Texas singer co-wrote all 12 tracks on ΓÇÿSame Trailer Different Park,ΓÇÖ including her current Top 20 single, ΓÇÿMerry Go ΓÇÿRound.ΓÇÖ The strength of the lyrics on this album is difficult to overstate. Musgraves has a soft-spoken, introverted style that often falls back on familiar phrases or ideas and turns them into something new and brilliant. ΓÇ£Sticks and stones may build a throne / But youΓÇÖll be up there all alone,ΓÇ¥ she sings on ΓÇÿStep Off,ΓÇÖ a punchy little folk song about telling an ex to get lost.

The first five tracks are the heart of the album. ΓÇÿSilver LiningΓÇÖ sounds like a canΓÇÖt-miss single. Musgraves will be painted as some sort of bad girl because she sings about drugs and girls kissing girls (depending on interpretation) later on the album, but this opening track is absolutely uplifting. ΓÇ£If youΓÇÖre ever gonna find a silver lining / ItΓÇÖs gotta be a cloudy day,ΓÇ¥ she reminds us before similar country inspirations.

ΓÇÿDandelionΓÇÖ (ΓÇ£Just like him / You always leave me crying dandelionΓÇ£) is another poetic story wrapped in acoustic guitar and heartbreaking metaphor. Next is ΓÇÿBlowinΓÇÖ Smoke,ΓÇÖ her second single. Fans of Pistol Annies will embrace this story of wobbly dreams. Musgraves plays with the phrase ΓÇ£blowing smokeΓÇ¥ to offer several meanings throughout the shuffling, blues-tinged track.

ΓÇÿMy HouseΓÇÖ and ΓÇÿStupidΓÇÖ are the only real crank-it-up moments on ΓÇÿSame Trailer Different Park,ΓÇÖ an album that relies on more somber chord structures and melodies for effect. One wild moment might not have been a bad idea, perhaps in place of the sleepy ΓÇÿBack on the Map.ΓÇÖ However, an argument could be made that a splash of cherry red might have disrupted the pallet of grays, organic greens and yellows Musgraves has used to paint with such efficiency and passion.

The next to last track is ΓÇÿFollow Your Arrow,ΓÇÖ a song that is guaranteed to be the biggest controversy on country radio this year. ΓÇ£Make lots of noise / Kiss lots of boys / Kiss lots of girls if thatΓÇÖs something youΓÇÖre into / When the straight and narrow gets a little too straight roll up a joint / Or donΓÇÖt / Just follow your arrow wherever it points,ΓÇ¥ she sings.

ItΓÇÖs difficult to find a funny song with emotional depth, but this track hits on multiple levels. The singer has said in interviews that sheΓÇÖs pushing for it as a single, and if one is simply choosing the best songs to offer radio, itΓÇÖs a no-brainer. One year from now weΓÇÖll all know if a new female artist can get away with some of the things Musgraves says early in this song. Our fingers are crossed.
