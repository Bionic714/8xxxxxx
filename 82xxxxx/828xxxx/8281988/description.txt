Requirements: Bridge Commander 1.1, and WinRAR
   
Kobayashi Maru v. 0.9.1 is one of the best mods I've run across, though the nanofx 2.0 Beta plugin used has caused me problems, turning it off has fixed it.

People still play online though many have moved on to the 2011_10 version, this one still has it's play as one of the most compatible.

This is a full 0.9.1 mod, just extract to your Bridge Commander folder and overwrite when prompted; I advise that if you want to uninstall in the future you take the time now before overwriting to make a backup copy of your whole Bridge Commander installation.

If you get an error, trying Multiplayer, saying "Your Multiplayer folder
is dirty" then Remove the entire MP folder
("Bridge commander/scripts/Multiplayer/") and reinstall this patch.

Changes from 0.9:

-Improved Anti-File-Download protection.
-Fixed Galor/Keldon icon
-Fixed a few Mission4 (TKY) Bugs
-Disabled surrender
-8472 is now non-player ship
-Fixed Klingbase disruptor
-Reduced damage of Karemma beams
-Fixed the Ktinga turning rate
-Disabled Bridge in TKY
-Borg Cube: Phasers now single fire, higher repair points.
-Firepoints should no longer explode -&gt; Blindfire should no longer crash the game.
-Added Missing Neghvar documents
-Fixed Prometheus Phasers.
-Lots of other bug fixes
-Version number updated to 0.9.1
-Starbase220 Power corrected

Kobayashi Maru:

This is a Bridge Commander Mod pack.
Please read our Manual in the doc/ -folder.

Please note, that Kobayashi Maru does only support high Model settings.
Playing with Low or Medium Model Settings while NanoFX is activated will crash the game.

Server naming:

You do not need to tag your server with KM, the game tags itself automaticly.


Install:

Kobayashi Maru has to be installed into a clean 1.1 installation:
1. Install Bridge Commander
2. Install the 1.1 patch
3. Install KOBMARU

thats all
If something does not work, please take a look at KOBMARU-FAQ.txt in the doc/
Folder first before contacting us or a Forum.
