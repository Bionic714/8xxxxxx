The White Buffalo (Jake Smith) recently played a stellar performance at Bonnaroo and is riding an increasingly steady wave of word-of-mouth due to his consistent touring. Compared to artists from Ray Lamontagne to Eddie Vedder to Johnny Cash for his guitar-focused authentic songwriting, The White Buffalo has honed his craft in the bars and clubs whose characters inspired much of his music. He just wrapped a string of west coast tour dates previewing material from his forthcoming full length album ΓÇ£Once Upon A Time In The WestΓÇ¥ (due out October 25th, 2011 via Unison Music Group). The Portland Mercury said this about his new albumΓÇªΓÇ£On his forthcoming LP Once Upon a Time in the West [The White Buffalo] comes across as a weathered hero, a singer with a husky voice and a whiskey slur trying to right some wrongs along the way. He'll drink you under the table, then break a chair over your back, and you'll love every moment of it.ΓÇ¥
