Eagles of Death Metal frontman Jesse Hughes shows up with plenty of danceable grooves for the people via this 10-song slab of fun. Opening with ΓÇ£Complexity,ΓÇ¥ an easy-to-digest three minute platter that doesnΓÇÖt really add up to much more than Hughes tossing out some cool beats and dashing off the word ΓÇ£shitΓÇ¥ a few times, and closing with the rockabilly-ish ΓÇ£Swallowed By The NightΓÇ¥, Honkey Kong isnΓÇÖt more than some carefree rock ΓÇÿnΓÇÖ roll,
