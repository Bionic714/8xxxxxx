,Zipgun,2013-03-21T23:19Z,"I don't use public torrents nor do I ""steal"" if I like it I buy it if not I delete it. Yeah technically it's stealing but to me its morals. I only use torrents as demos.

Anyways..With that said. LOL Any ARMA or BIS sim is 100% NOT going to work with on any non-legit copy and I only need it to describe it by ONE word.

FADE... 

Hell its a great series and one of the only games or Simulator I should say I play. I bought the Supporters edition for $76 bucks as they had a glitch on the Alpha release day. Reg price is $91 but it includes a ton of extras which includes soundtracks, dvd's, maps and every arma and dlc ever released and of course the full game when it comes. Oh and 3 free future DLC's So good buy for us who got the discount ;).

But yeah with FADE (they call it something else now but I forgot but people just call it FADE) its the best and funniest anti piracy thing around. The game functions and all. But in a few minutes, your aim will be way off, major graphics degradation, some funny as hell stuff. And at least with ARMA II a message will come up and say something like"" you have a stolen copy and have been FADED along with some other funny lines"". 

So download to see FADE in action for yourself but NO ARMA or BIS game has ever been cracked. But you'll get a look at how the game's GUI looks and stuff and basically walk around the game world for a short time. But I'd either just buy the per-order like I did or watch a you tube vid. As this game will be unplayable. "

I guess you haven't tried this torrent yet because I've been playing it for two weeks with no problems. FADE hasn't been incorporated into the alpha. I'm sure it'll make an appearance in the final code, but as of now, pirated copies are completely playable. So much for your long, wall of text."
,sh1dowfax,2013-03-22T10:50Z,Is this the ARMA3 alpha release with 4 showcase missions and mp that was released a while ago?
,Pillmonster,2013-03-30T04:43Z,"@zipgun TL;DR 

Works fine thanks. If the final is actually playable on PC I'll buy it."
,stipes007,2013-03-30T10:28Z,sorry can somebody help me how to install...thanks
,dubsnax,2013-03-31T17:00Z,There was an update to the Arma 3 alpha on the 25th. Any chance we can get it uploaded Gh0st?
,benemii,2013-04-01T06:38Z,"yeah can you upload the update,or updated version? We need 0.52!  this will soon be useless for multiplayer."
,TuzoAnime,2013-04-08T04:53Z,We need an update. 
,sh1dowfax,2013-04-08T13:34Z,Please update 0.52 or is there a way we can do it i got a free alpha key but without multiplayer.
