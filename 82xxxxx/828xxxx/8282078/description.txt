After years of intense warfare against Eastern armies
Europe has become the last stand for the battered NATO
forces. On the verge of being driven into the sea, NATO
command embarks upon a most desperate measure. In the hope
of seizing what seems to be a well-guarded military secret
Operation Magnitude is launched. A small group of Special
Forces and Researchers are sent to a Mediterranean island
deep behind enemy lines. However, the mission is compromised
and the task force destroyed, leaving Cpt. Scott Miller
ashed ashore upon the hostile island. In his effort to carry
out the mission, he will face the dangers of modern warfare
an unforgiving environment, and the consequences of his own
decisions
