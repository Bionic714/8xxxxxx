               Game Description

=======================================================

In Star Trek Armada II you'll find some of the most
recognizable elements from the Star Trek universe:
leading fleets of star ships into war with six different
races to choose from, battling those familiar races from
the Alpha and Delta Quadrants, and carefully treading
the delicate balance between resource collecting,
defense and offensive strategies. 

In 30 missions divided into three campaigns, you can
experience the excitement of watching a story unfold
before your eyes from the perspective of the United
Federation of Planets, the Klingon Empire, and the Borg
Collective. Commanding the ships and stations of these
very different races, you'll be able to feel the
excitement of commanding fleets of ships into battle,
the thrill of conquering worlds and crushing your enemies,
and the cold efficiency of assimilation. As the commander
of an armada, you must make the hard choices that will
determine the fate of hundreds of vessels, thousands of
lives and many worlds. Are you ready, we'll see.
