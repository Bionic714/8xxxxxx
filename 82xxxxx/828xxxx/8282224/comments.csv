[T],mikesanderspqrs,2013-03-21T14:51Z,"Are you talking to me keywest33?
Because I've tons to upload & only limited upload bandwidth, I seed until my upload/download ratio is around 5 & there are at least 20 seeders. Then I will stop my seed and upload something new. I can't help it if there are selfish bastards who are downloading then stopping their seed. They don't deserve to use TPB."
