Congratulations! If youΓÇÖre reading far enough to look at this bookΓÇÖs Introduction, then
youΓÇÖve probably already decided to go for your Cisco certification. If you want to succeed
as a technical person in the networking industry at all, you need to know Cisco. Cisco has
a ridiculously high market share in the router and switch marketplace, with more than 80
percent market share in some markets. In many geographies and markets around the world,
networking equals Cisco. If you want to be taken seriously as a network engineer, Cisco
certification makes perfect sense.
Historically speaking, the first entry-level Cisco certification has been the Cisco Certified
Network Associate (CCNA) certification, first offered in 1998. The first three versions of
the CCNA certification required that you pass a single exam to become certified. However,
over time, the exam kept growing, both in the amount of material covered, and the difficulty
level of the questions. So, for the fourth major revision of the exams, announced in 2003,
Cisco continued with a single certification (CCNA), but offered two options for the exams
to get certified: a single exam option and a two-exam option. The two-exam option allowed
people to study roughly half of the material, take and pass one exam, before they moved to
the next one.
