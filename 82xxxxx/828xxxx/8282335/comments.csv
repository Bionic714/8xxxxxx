,dkibaruk,2013-03-21T14:02Z,Whats the difference between this one GECKOS and DTS?
,Hojew,2013-03-22T14:11Z,"GECKOS is a release group.  DTS is a sound company, specifically meaning Digital Theater Systems.  If you're referring to another torrent, there is likely no difference other than the uploader failed to credit the release group with the rip."
