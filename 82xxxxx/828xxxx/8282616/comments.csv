,Sweet25th,2013-04-08T06:30Z,Thanks for these awesome packages!  I only have one small request.  Would it be terribly difficult to add to your list of apps which ones are for Rooted and non-rooted?  I hope this isnt too troublesome and thanks again!  Will definitely SEED and keep my eye out for your upcomimg packages.
