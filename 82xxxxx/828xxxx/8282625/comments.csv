,Lonecat,2013-03-21T17:19Z,"Never heard of this one. Trying out. 

Also, I doubt SimCity's ever getting pirated. It's not just DRM, it's server-side progress saving. Unless somebody starts making private servers like in Diablo 3."

,92krle,2013-03-21T18:15Z,p.s. this game is pure sadness...

hey man, i got to find out why i was experiencing missing textures in Sonic and all stars game, because my video card doesnt support INTZ feature. this feature cannot be installed by software.

but they released a patch/update to support the older video cards, can you release that patch? please.

thanks man"

,King_Kazma,2013-03-22T07:34Z,"Thank you very much
 Extremezone you are my Hero ^^
Can you Upload :
StarCraft 2 Heart of the Swarm
Sim City 5
Than you are my God :D"
,iWINDOWS,2013-03-23T14:17Z,@ 92krle source for that statement?
,rockodss,2013-03-24T14:18Z,"@King_Kazma  no need to ask for new games...he ALWAYS upload them right when they come out and are working. If HoTs and simcity arent out yet, its because they are not cracked yet or properly working."
