Ep: U.S. Green Berets vs. Norwegian FSK

Air Date: 2013-03-05

Two battle-hardened veterans of U.S. Special Forces -- the "Green Berets" compete against a pair of commandos from Norway's super-secret FSK. And both teams compete against a "Rogue" wild card team comprised of two military contractors. Competitions include a hostage rescue drill, sniper rifle shooting, knife fights, and a mission to retrieve valuable intel from an enemy-occupied village.


Don't forget to say thanks! ;)

Enjoy!!!
