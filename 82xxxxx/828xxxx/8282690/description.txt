Ep: Shoes.Shoes.Everywhere.Shoes!

Air Date: Mar/20/2013

CameronΓÇÖs least favorite event, the annual Decades shoe sale, is fast approaching and Christos tries to hire a manager in time. But when crowds line up and around the block, big sales and big problems are inevitable. With Christos efforts to make the event as smooth as possible and CameronΓÇÖs constant snide remarks, the two butt heads on everything.
