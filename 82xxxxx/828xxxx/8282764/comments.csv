,txrabbit,2013-03-21T20:12Z,Never mind...I found it after some digging around the Internet.  Thanks again!
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-21T20:14Z,you're welcome... but what happened is you didn't check the 0-day pack that was posted the week 199 came out. http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8197993/
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-21T20:16Z,awww. you totally defused my snarky reply! lol i'm glad you found it. seriously though shipJ's 0-day week torrents include a lot of issues otherwise overlooked.
