,m00njaguar,2013-04-05T00:37Z,Thanks for putting up these albums in this year by year form- it allows collectors of Putumayo to get some of the albums that hadn't been uploaded yet by others- I look forward to seeing some of the newer records that Putumayo has released in more recent years as you get to them. THANKS!
