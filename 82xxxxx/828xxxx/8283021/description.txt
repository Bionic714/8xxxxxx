Eric Steckel + Bas Paardekooper & The Blue Crew 2009-12-16




The young but very talented and musical guitarist Eric Steckel this evening to see on stage at the Farm.
He will be accompanied by Bas Paardekooper with his band The Blew Crue!

The young super talent Eric Steckel from Allentown Pennsylvania, the blue absolute thrill of the moment.

While peers messing with the latest computer games, plays topgitarist all the stars of heaven.

By now increasingly able CD in the bins next to Jimi Hendrix,

Stevie Ray Vaughan and Freddie King. Eric Steckel is the discovery of blues legend John Mayall who took him on his European tour two years back.

 

Bas Paardekooper & The Blew Crue recently kept a fantastic performance in a crowded Podiumcaf√© Aynsley Lister and is also in the program.

Paardekooper is inspired by Stevie Ray Vaughan, Walter Trout and Jimi Hendrix and is best described as U.S. Bluesrock. In short,

the perfect backing band for Eric Steckel!
