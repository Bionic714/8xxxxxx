,coolfridge,2013-03-21T18:39Z,"Hey, bro! Thanks anyway. You were here before KILLERS and AFG.

...but is me or does anybody else notice that there's a weird bassline buzzing in the background? It's watchable but a bit annoying."
,coolfridge,2013-03-21T18:54Z,*is it me
,q2323,2013-03-21T19:01Z,"You're welcome. Yeah, it was wrong settings in screen recorder. I'm sorry :-) Shit happens sometimes"
,coolfridge,2013-03-21T20:10Z,"No prob. I'd appreciate if you can rip the next (and the last) episode with the right settings before delayed scene/HDTV releases. :)

As regarding Weed Country, check out theweedblog.com's post on the show (keyword: weed-country-another-non-reality-reality-show-on-marijuana, since posting links is limited). It seems not to be reality (duh, all the editing) but entertaining nonetheless if you're interested into the matter. Also: ""-- and another show filling the time slot in April called “Pot Cops”, we can be assured that the law enforcement will get their message across."""
,q2323,2013-03-21T21:13Z,"Thanks for info, I will check that out, today's reality shows are full of shit, but I thought this one, and Moonshiners might be real. You never know these days. :-) But I like the show anyway."
