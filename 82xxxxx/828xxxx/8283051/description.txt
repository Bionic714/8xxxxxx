Hello everyone

version: Pokemon3D version 0.27
created by nilllzz

Score: 9.4/10



Pokemon3D is a recreation of the old Pokemon games Gold/Silver by Nintendo/GameFreak (but, of course this game has nothing to do with them ;) You're the hero of the game, and as usual, you want to be the best Pokemon trainer of all time. So let's go, visit some grass and catch, battle and defeat wild Pokemon, explore towns and routes in 3D, collect items and Pokemon, play with a friend in LAN co-op and much more. The game is currently under development and features are added frequently.

Have fun

Just open the laucher connect to the game and have fun
