Sierra Dean - Keeping Secret (2013) [epub]

Something old, something blue, something deadlyΓÇªwhat else is new?

Secret McQueen, Book 4
ItΓÇÖs a nice day for a white wedding. At least thatΓÇÖs what Secret McQueen is hoping for, with her poofy-princess-dress marriage to a werewolf king looming closer and closer by the day. But as ever, nothing can be that easy for a vampire/werewolf hybrid for whom someone still harbors a death wish.
Summoned to the south by her werewolf uncle, who makes no bones about the fact her mate bond with Lucas doesnΓÇÖt pass muster, Secret learns her furry heritage looks more like a tangled vine than a family tree. Getting her royal uncleΓÇÖs blessing hinges on finding one of the missing twigs. Even with vampire sentry Holden Chancery at her side, she manages to land up to her neck in a swamp of trouble.
