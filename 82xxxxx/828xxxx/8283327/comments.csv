,UnviolentPeacemaker,2013-03-22T23:41Z,ps: I can't comprehend how you achieve such speed.  I wonder what scanning software you use?
,UnviolentPeacemaker,2013-03-22T23:57Z,"pps:  No details, but, I'm not expected to live many more months.  Do what you can to support some of the orphaned titles that you deem worthy, on my site.  OK?"
,UnviolentPeacemaker,2013-03-22T23:58Z,"Pls consider seeding some, is what I meant to say."
[T],pharmakate,2013-03-23T18:05Z,"@UnviolentPeacemaker - So sorry to hear about your situation, & sure, I'll be happy to seed some of your items, though I don't have the bandwidth to do much with movies.

Scanning: I use a Scansnap S1500 sheetfed scanner and its software. Takes about 15 minutes to scan the pages to .jpg for most books. Then I process the images with Scan Tailor and create the .pdf with Acrobat.  Unless the book is troublesome it takes about 90 minutes from beginning to end."
