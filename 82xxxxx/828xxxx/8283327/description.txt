back cover:

This collection of short essays from 1943 to 1969 bear witness to a quarter century of pacifist and civil rights activity. An abiding humanism is central to Dellinger's tactics and tenets; but better to resist oppression violently than not at all. Visits to and vindications of North Vietnam, Cuba, and Communist China are relatively scrupulous affairs, since Dellinger makes a point of seeking out opposition elements and asking embarrassing questions of the authorities. The bulk of the essays report and analyze movement developments right up to the 'Chicago police riot.' Dellinger closes with a comparison between the indictment of the Chicago 'conspirators'  and Hitler's attempt to discredit the Communists in the Reichstag Fire Trial. -- The Kirkus Service

A member of the Chicago 7 ... Dellinger remains one of its (the New Left) most eloquent spokesmen. A socialist pacifist, he accepts, as an act of faith, the inherent evil in capitalism and the effectiveness of nonviolent action in changing the existing system and in combating forces of aggression ... He sees the movement as stifled by the need to choose between liberal Establishment politics and overt revolution. Dellinger warns against a 'retreat into liberalism,' but cautions equally against a similar regression into 'pseudo-revolutionary "infantile leftism." ' ... Many will oppose Dellinger's politics, but they would do well to emulate his honesty and concern for humanity. -- Library Journal
