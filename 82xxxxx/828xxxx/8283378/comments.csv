,V8_Man,2013-03-21T19:58Z,"Hey Gingasnapz, How about you download VLC or re-encode it yourself and upload it or stop bothering TvTeam with something that you should deal with on your own... they're not your mother!!!

TvTeam has a lot to do and catering to every asshole that clings to old shitty formats isn't one of them.

  Thanks a million TvTeam and don't forget to ignore the morons :)"
