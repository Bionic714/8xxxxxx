Malware alert.
################
After download, the keygen.exe threw up a virus alert.

Win32:Malware-gen

Process closed.

Before anyone starts complaining this is a false-positive, I have also downloaded the following:-

http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8188031/CorelDRAW.Graphics.Suite.X6.v16.2.0.998.HF1.x64.Incl.Keymaker-CO

The keygen.exe in this package worked correctly.

If you need the keygen.exe, go to the alternative source and then return to use on this package.

NOTE:  I have never had issues with keygen.exe from CORE until this package.  

BE WARNED, BE SAFE.

I have now downloaded and tested the keygen.exe files from eight Corel packages on here and other sources.

All four CorelDRAW.Technical keygen.exe files triggered Malware alerts.

All four CorelDraw.Graphics keygen.exe files were clean.

I don't have a spare machine to risk testing the Malware files today.  Maybe in a few days."

MALWARE - IGNORE all of the above

**********************

Not a true error but a FALSE POSITIVE.

I've now tested keygen in two machines, both Windows 32-bit (XP) and 64-bit (7) with virus scanners off.

It's not caused any issues over the last 24 hours.

Apologies for the confusion, but it was still an issue when one keygen shows clean and another doesn't.
