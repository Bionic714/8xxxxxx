,Fan_of_Claudia_z,2013-03-23T23:55Z,"Thanks Ms F. I can't believe that YR gets usurped for Sport in the US. We used to cop this all the time when it was aired here in Australia by the network which also had the cricket. Episodes that were 3 years behind the US got pushed even further back, to the point where they mad a ""catch up"" series. Even then it was still a year behind.

We didn't know this til my wife's sister started sending her TV magazines (The Star, National Enquirer) and we're reading stuff about YR which hadn't happened yet for us... 

Talk about spoilers to the max!!!"
