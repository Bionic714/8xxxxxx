From the tales of Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, The Little Mermaid and Snow White comes Damsels!  As Rapa, Red, Talia and Heinrich journey through the Enchanted Forest toward Villeneuve, Rapa's memories begin to return in earnest.  The royal cavalcade is ambushed on the road to the kingdom, forcing Queens Talia and Rapunzel to fight for their lives.  Meanwhile Queen Belle, plagued by her conscience begins to wonder if she herself might be cursed.
