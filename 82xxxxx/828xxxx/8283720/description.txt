From the tales of Cinderalla, Sleeping Beauty, The Little Mermaid and Snow White comes Damsels! Transported magically to the northern Enchanted Forest, Rapa and Heinrich find themselves under the protection of an axe-wielding woods-woman. Out on the desolate Myvathen Mire our little mermaid seizes the chance to confess all to her beloved prince. King Oberon welcomes new recruits to his faerie army as the secret of what lies at the heart of the Enchanted forest, and what is at stake in the war to come, is revealed.

Thanks goes to Son of Ultron for this release.
