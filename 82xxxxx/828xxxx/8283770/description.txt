Synopsis:
In the early 60's, the famous Jewish magician Adam Stein (Jeff Goldblum) living in a mental institution for Holocaust survivors in the Negev desert. Charismatic, cynical and seductive, runs at will to other patients, defying the rules of the school head (Derek Jacobi). The arrival of a child who is believed dog will return to his painful past, when confined in a concentration camp was brutally reviled by a Nazi commandant (Willem Dafoe).

Production notes:
Paul Schrader, writer of Taxi Driver and Raging Bull, and works as director of Mishima, also distributed by Films-Sherlock, American Gigolo or Affliction, offers another powerful drama, intriguing and counter. A dark poetic fable that tells a universal story about twin souls trapped, linked by a deep need to be reborn and leave behind an era marked by crime and alienation.

Based on the controversial novel, "Dog Man" by Yoram Kaniuk, one of the most important works of Hebrew literature, ADAM RESURRECTED is a brave film that explores memory, history, the nature of human desire and the thin line between freedom from bondage, black humor of the tragedy, the reason of insanity.
