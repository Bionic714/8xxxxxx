Mask My IP is an online protection tool that can prevent your surfing habits and your Internet activities from being tracked by hackers or other cyber criminals through your real IP address. It has a nicely designed user interface that makes it incredibly easy to hide your IP address. When you are online, your computer has a unique identifying IP address just like your home address, alerting everyone to who you are and where you are located. When you shopping online or sending emails, your IP is associated with that activity, and it identifies you personally. Hackers and identity thieves may break into your computer, monitor your activity, steal your identity or other personal information.
