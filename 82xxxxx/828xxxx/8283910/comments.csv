,sniperx11,2013-03-22T12:15Z,Nice job as always.
,papayrus,2013-03-23T11:39Z,When I launch it says can't connect. I see it says server is down because a storm in NY but when will it be back up. Also is there some other good servers or something I can add to this or connect with this?
[T],TeamExtreme,2013-03-23T17:59Z,"@papayrus 

Just google cracked Minecraft servers."
,b0xen,2013-03-23T21:49Z,"Is anyone else getting stuck on a Loading done screen?

Multiple re-installs done with no resolution"
[T],TeamExtreme,2013-03-24T08:43Z,"@b0xen

,catat102,2013-03-24T14:58Z,"it is not working,why does it says can t reach server ?"
,ChesherPig,2013-03-26T20:23Z,"I downloaded the TeamExtreme Minecraft Cracker back when it was 1.4.5 and the update feature and everything else works perfectly. This is truly some great work these people are doing, I really have not experienced any problems and TeamExtreme is always trustworthy, 10/10"
,NeonWuff,2013-03-27T17:32Z,"Perhaps because of my own ignorance, I've failed to get it to work on Linux using Wine.  Would it be too much to ask for a cracked .jar?"
,billyolak78,2013-03-30T08:42Z,"how can I get on your server list

,catat102,2013-03-30T10:01Z,why doesn t 1.5.1 work i can t connect :(
,LnceHrdwd,2013-03-30T18:49Z,"When I'm not whacking it to the Sims, I'm playing Minecraft on TE. Great launcher! "
[T],TeamExtreme,2013-03-31T00:06Z,"@NeonWuff - we might in the future.

@billyolak78 - What do you mean? How can you connect to our server in the list?

@catat102 - Our server has just finished its beta stage and players may now connect."
,billyolak78,2013-03-31T08:13Z,"I mean, how do I get my server to be in your server list, like it shows in the multiplayer tab in this client"
,phoebe.a,2013-04-04T11:11Z,Will this work on 32bit windows? I have the latest 32bit java and am running on 32bit windows 7
,AlexM13,2013-04-04T22:48Z,"How is the update service supposed to work? Like, update in the background or does it request to download an update upon running it or what?

I currently have version 1.5 from you guys. It never really updated itself or anything, so now I'm just downloading the next version manually. Unless it already updated and I don't know it, but  it says Version 1.5 on the title screen, leading me to believe it's just 1.5 and not 1.5.1"
,AlexM13,2013-04-04T22:52Z,"Ah, it seems after updating it to this torrent's version and selecting ""Force Update"" it showed an update screen when launching. Guess it works now. It didn't work with the 1.5."
[T],TeamExtreme,2013-04-05T01:54Z,"@AlexM13 - There are to different updates systems in this launcher. The First is the launchers own updater which is automatic. This system only updates the launcher. The 2nd system is Manuel and can be found in the launcher options. This will update the game to the latest version.

@phoebe.a - Yes. It works with 64bit and 32bit."
,DTA420,2013-04-06T11:46Z,"When I hit launch it flashes to a black screen and stays there forever. I had your 1.4.7 launcher working a month ago, but my hard drive took a dump on me and i had to get a clean one. i know my computer is capable of running minecraft. the only thing i can think of is that im just missing some kind software somewhere that i had on my old hard drive that i forgot to reinstall on this one. I have a hp pavilion g7 laptop with an amd radeon hd 6520g graphics card, 4gb ram, and Java 7 update 17 64bit.
i have tried deleting minecraft completely from %appdata% then reinstalling it with no luck. I cant find answers anywhere so if someone could help me it would be greatly appreciated! "
[T],TeamExtreme,2013-04-07T00:56Z,@DTA420 - Try installing Windows Framework and making sure your video drive is up to date. 
,DTA420,2013-04-07T03:13Z,"I installed windows framework 4.0 and ran windows update which installed 11 more framework updates. Then i Checked for updates of my video drive, it said it was up to date. reinstalled minecraft, still got the same black screen.."

,deus223,2013-04-11T17:57Z,"I said it once I'll say it again, TeamExtreme is awesome for having a way to play minecraft online but if you truly love minecraft PLEASE support the developers and buy a legit copy of minecraft I know not everyone can afford it which is why this torrent is great but for those who truly enjoy minecraft and want to see it continue thriving then all you need to do is spend the $26.95 and never worry about cracked servers again."
[T],TeamExtreme,2013-04-11T18:51Z,"@deus223 - ""Worry about cracked servers?"" TeamExtremes V2's server is one of the best servers around in fact TEv2 has had 150/150 players since it's launched, there has not been a time when we have not been full.

There is not much difference between a an offline server A.K.A. ""cracked"" and an online server, ""premium"". The only difference is that offline servers use there own authentication system, handled by their server bypassing Mojang's system, hence offline mode.

Minecraft was built from being shared, in fact it was encouraged to pirate the game. with out Minecraft being p2p it would have not grown to the size it did. Do you think a game which had a $0 budget in adverting during the beta managed to sell over 1mill accounts without P2P?

Minecraft has always been a P2P game and always will, I have a LOT of players who have bought the game and when I say a lot I mean a LOT. If people like they game and spend enough time on it, there is a high chance they will buy it.

@Trollz0r6 - It means you need to update your video card driver. Google is your friend."
,Vesrom222,2013-04-11T23:28Z,Is there any way to get minecraft skins to work online with this?

,papayrus,2013-04-22T14:16Z,Where is the server list or you mean just the teamextreme server? Also got a question I am new to the game what mods should I use? Also is there anyway to backup the servers after I add all my favorites for transfering to another PC?
,zigzagelfy,2013-04-23T17:01Z,@Cleerrep not so slow anymore got over 4000 seeders and took me liek under 30 seconds to finish.
,Seven7r,2013-04-24T16:25Z,"Hello TeamExtreme, I have a question, in the login or launcher, why does pressing launch always take a long time and the ""Minecraft"" logo appears and takes almost 5 minutes to load. 
Specs are as follows:

i7 3770k
8 GB RAM
GTX 660 
Win 7 64-bit

I downloaded the newest Java for 64-bit and it still launches so slow. Any help is appreciated. Thanks!"
,drd37r,2013-04-25T09:44Z,"Help pls! I am getting an error upon launching the game :
""Bad video card drivers! 
----------------------- 

Minecraft was unable to start because it failed to find an accelerated OpenGL mode.
This can usually be fixed by updating the video card drivers."""

,Babality,2013-04-30T17:54Z,Works like a charm ! Ty again m8 :D

,Ipfree549,2013-05-02T21:43Z,"If anyone is just looking for a more versatile and customization launcher, just for single player, check out the ""Magic Launcher"" on the Minecraft forums.

It allows you to have individual profiles made for each .Minecraft folder with their own set preferences such as Java memory heap sizes and a opening on a set resolution.

I've used it to make profiles for my 20+ some different Minecraft folders, with the ability to select any of them with 1 launcher.
You may just fall in love with it!"
,youcifer,2013-05-07T01:38Z,"Personally I can't get the sound to work. Have searched Google and done all the usual fixes, but no luck so far :P"
,montynick,2013-05-10T01:12Z,"Most amazing server I have ever played on. Glad I found your 1.3.2 Torrent way back in the day.

Thank you TeamExtreme! You are amazing"
,pacolovac,2013-05-10T19:57Z,"NOTE to everyone: 
Download MagicLauncher and optifine hd 1.5.1 from minecraft forums. 
Use this Launcher instead of the default one, and add the Optifinehd 1.5.1 zip file inside the launcher. 
Now run the Magic Launcher and change the options you want (every one of them has an explanation what it does). 
This way game runs at least 2x faster and looks oh so much prettier.
Check the tutorials/beginners guide at Minecraftwiki if you're just starting a game. Survival mode can be tricky at start. 
No viruses, not bugs so far. Game runs great.
Rate my comment + so everyone can see this."
,Diagnosis,2013-05-12T10:21Z,"Any way to play on LAN? The cracked servers are to laggy for me and my friend : ].

,lucarido,2013-05-20T22:50Z,"Torrent works; but TeamExtreme are the most douchiest with their servers, only get this torrent for the singleplayer, they got no idea how to run multiplayer properly."
,pupnuts,2013-06-01T23:19Z,"I'm having an issue with checking my stats, my minecraft just crashes when I try. I've re-installed and tried using a different set of stats with a different username and I have minecraft blocked on my firewall. idk whats causing the crash."
,pupnuts,2013-06-01T23:24Z,"Weird.. I tried to open my stats to save a copy of the crash log, and it opened fine. Disregard my last comment... "
,MrEndusr,2013-06-05T02:03Z,Not 100% sure but this (or the 1.5.2) might contain some kind of toolbar called WhiteSmoke. Which was automatically downloaded with my torrent client around the same time as I downloaded this.
