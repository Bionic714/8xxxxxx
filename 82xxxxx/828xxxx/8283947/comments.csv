[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-22T12:38Z,"tdurden83, lol wut? click my user name, go to the right-hand side and click ""LE"" and it's still there, at the top of the list (""125 More..."").

it has been ridiculous though! i've unfortunately reached the end of a 6-month promotional price on unlimited bandwidth for my cable internet. unsure what's going to happen in april, so this was a good week to share a lot."
,tdurden83,2013-03-22T19:08Z,"That sux about ur bandwidth dilemma. I hope u can find a work-around that doesn't cost an arm and a leg. Thx, I found it again, but am I going crazy or did the torrent name change? I know at least some of my sanity remains intact because my client still shows it as ""bride of...""  Not that it really matters, but that's what was giving me trouble trying to find it. "
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-22T20:17Z,"oh yeah THAT.  you're not crazy, you remembered the torrent name but my post title was different. the torrents are named:

1. Graphic Novels, Hardcovers and Trade Paperbacks
2. More Graphic Novels, Hardcovers and Trade Paperbacks
3. Even More Graphic Novels, Hardcovers and Trade Paperbacks
4. Bride of Graphic Novels, Hardcovers and Trade Paperbacks

for TPB i tried to use more keyword /search engine-friendly titles. (if a new user searches for ""hardcover"" or ""marvel trade"" my stuff will be in the results.)"
