,jalucian,2013-03-27T05:25Z,"Ive checked every day since I uploaded this, and there's been over 20-25 seeds every time I've checked. You must have just logged on at a very unlucky time kadren170...lol"

love your work

2 Q? any chance of Anchorman 720p

is Django on the upcoming list?"
,jalucian,2013-03-30T23:56Z,"1) I can do Anchorman [Unrated] 720p, sure. 

2) I had already encoded Django Unchained, but the day I encoded it, YIFY released his, and since he seems to always get the most seeds I kinda decided there wasn't much point. YIFY was actually who inspired me to learn encoding, and I have been targeting movies that he hasn't done (a few, like Dogma for example, YIFY ended up doing after me) but we do have some minor differences: my video bitrates are about 15-20% higher than his and my audio bitrates are always 160kbps whereas his are usually 96kbps.

Do you still want me to upload Django even though YIFY has already done it? (Sorry for the long winded answer...lol)"
,vakabaka,2013-03-31T06:02Z,"Thanks for the reply, i appreciate it.

just Anchorman.

sorry, but can i request other movies the ones kinda forgotten?

I can't guarantee I can get access to everything, but I'll give it a shot. What were you looking for?"
,jalucian,2013-03-31T21:35Z,"And here's the 720p version, as requested:

,vakabaka,2013-04-01T05:33Z,"Stalker (1979) 

Mallrats 1995 (extended)

no pressure, thanks. "
,jalucian,2013-04-02T02:38Z,"Mallrats in 720p coming up tonight or tomorrow. 

Stalker (1979) according to blu-ray.com has never been released in 720 or 1080p, so I can't help there, but Mallrats is on the way!"
,jalucian,2013-04-04T22:01Z,"Here's your Mallrats in 720p you asked for:
