,jamzkie,2013-03-22T15:52Z,thank you so much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SEEDS people please! :))
,kristiej,2013-03-22T18:19Z,"Everyone seems to be leaving just after they finish their downloads.
Seems this will be my first and last torrent if people can't find it in their hearts to seed a little and help me out."
,Rax85,2013-03-24T20:27Z,"judging by the sample it looks great, just what i was waiting for, great quality with not too big size, will seed as long as i can after i download it.
please do extras as well."
,kristiej,2013-03-25T11:49Z,@Rax85: I will do the 1080p extras in about a week or so.
,lglenwoodc,2013-03-25T12:31Z,"This HQ work seems to always survive the ungrateful leaches. Nice work. Most of us are grateful for your effort, resources and skill.

Thank You  "
,isotope,2013-04-01T11:10Z,Don't get disheartened. Hit and run is usual in all torrents.
,expat_brit,2013-04-06T15:41Z,Does anyone know where I can find Portuguese subtitles for this torrent?
,kristiej,2013-04-06T17:10Z,"@expat_brit: search subscene.com and set the language settings as whatever you want.
I think the HDTV subtitles were in sync even though I can't really understand them :)"
,expat_brit,2013-04-07T14:41Z,"@kristiej: Unfortunately they're not in sync, and I don't know how to edit them and sync them.  Is there any chance you could rip them from the BR and upload them?  I would be very, very grateful!"
,expat_brit,2013-04-07T15:42Z,@kristiej:  No longer necessary!  The Portuguese subs from Game.of.Thrones.S02.Season.2.DVDRip.XviD-CLUE.REWARD work perfectly!  Thanks for taking the time to read my incompetent ramblings...
,kristiej,2013-04-07T15:48Z,"@expat_brit: I am sorry, you will have to download this: Game.of.Thrones.S02.Season.2.1080p.BluRay.x264-PublicHD if you want more subtitles. I don't have them."
,kristiej,2013-04-07T15:49Z,@expat_brit: lol ok :)
,jamzkie,2013-04-09T06:49Z,very slow download!!! PLEASE more faster seeds!!
,falyn,2013-04-12T03:09Z,"If anyone is worried about being flagged on a public torrent- I have season 1 in 720p x264 (14gb total, from publichd) and will gladly seed it to anyone willing to share it privately as well. I'll do this for season 2 one I finish downloading it. ISP's are going to get nasty- we need to make it harder for HBO to track us. "
,kristiej,2013-04-12T07:46Z,@falyn: HBO has clearly said they have no plans to send out warnings regarding Game Of Thrones piracy.
,link5a,2013-04-12T16:02Z,"@kristiej thanks a lot for your time and for sharing! I agree with you, they have the best and slowest settings I can find in Handbreak = best possible quality for this size. Perfect audio config as well, IMHO. If you don't intent to play this on a computer you should steer clear and not complain after, since I can't think of any other device that could play these files. BTW, looking forward for the extras m8, and keep it up!"
,osriccc,2013-04-30T16:19Z,"Perfect quality of video and sound for the size. Some slow computers will have a hard time with this, but it's a great, almost Blu-ray quality rip. Watched it complete in a 56 inch and GREAT. BUT I have to say, if possible, you could upload the episode 8 again. Around minute 19:44 the video breaks terribly for 2 or 3 seconds and then goes back to normal. It's not a computer stuff, it's a strange encoding error in the video. If you would be so kind to upload that episode and link us for this collection to be PERFECT. Seeding right now. People, this is the one to go. True Blu-ray rip with no hardcoded stuff, subtitles, chapters and complete credits, etc."
,Aim_To_Maim,2013-05-01T09:19Z,Thanks for the upload but 16GB and not even fucking DTS ffs!?
,kristiej,2013-05-01T10:22Z,"@Aim_To_Maim: These are 10 episodes of 50-55 minutes each in 1080p, not a 90 minute movie to have DTS in 16GB.

In any case, the DTS has been ripped to AAC almost transparently, so there should be no discernible quality loss."
,kristiej,2013-05-01T10:26Z,"@osriccc: Yes, about 2 seconds of the video in the 8th episode does seem messed up. I will see what I can do asap.
Thanks for your comment :)"
