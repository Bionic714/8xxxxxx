,Shoobox,2013-05-21T23:24Z,"Its sad too, you'll never get past 99.8%

sga.s01e11 is what is causing the series to finish downloading. he didn't upload them properly so you never get 100%
All the rest look good and actually are very clear on my 42""
my advice to there would be to find the sga.s01e11 with the same decent quality elsewhere to complete season 1"
