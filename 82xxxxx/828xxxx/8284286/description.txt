Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site :: On the Thursday, March 21 edition of The Alex Jones Show, Obama is outed as the head of Al Qaeda worldwide. 

Alex will also cover the unfolding situation in Syria as the U.S. "elects" a new Syrian leader, moves to support al-Qaeda and a gruesome video surfaces showing the beheading of a civilian by the so-called "rebels." 

Alex also analyzes the latest on efforts by the gun-grabbers to take down the Second Amendment and the Department of Homeland Security boss Janet Napolitano's refusal to answer questions on bullet purchases by the agency. 

On today's show, Alex talks with Jon Rappoport about the alleged assassin James Holmes, mind control, the CIA and MKULTRA. 

Alex also talks with New York Times-bestselling author and investigative journalist Greg Palast about the banker heist. Palast is the author of The Best Democracy Money Can Buy and Billionaires and Ballot Bandits: How to Steal an Election in 9 Easy Steps.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
