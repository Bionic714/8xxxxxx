Not sure about a Toshiba OEM, do you ""really"" need an  OEM edition?"

,trancua,2013-04-01T14:14Z,The serial key works for instalation only. To activate you need a tool like http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8145522/KMSpico_v1_Activate_Windows_and_MS_Office

I need a toshiba oem edition so I don't need these buggy activators ,,specially after daz (i respect that man very much) announces that there wouldn't be a windows 8 loader.
I think his windows 7 loader tool is the best ever.
But OEM editions make let u activate easily and it 's legal!!"
