,221BBST,2013-03-22T09:02Z,"Awesome! I've been replacing some films in my collection with your encodes. Taken is the latest one I've replaced so far. Thanks Judas!

Just so you know, I'm aware about your accident but I want to request if you can do these: Apocalypse Now (theatrical version), The Godfather trilogy, Les Miserables, and Argo. All of them are already released in Blu-ray with Les Miserables just released today. Of course, I can wait as I know it will take time to recover from your accident. Hope everything goes well. Godspeed!"

,ers2258,2013-03-22T22:13Z,"Thank You Judas. I am replacing movies as you release them with your encodes.
This one:
A=20 (10 just for the 5.1 alone)
V=10
Overall= Shit Man Just Superb!
Hope you are able to do more movies more often as I now watch for your works very closely.
Don't know what that accident of yours comment is about but if it is so then I will pray for you to have a speedy, successful and painless recovery period.
Uhm.. Taken 2?"
[V],dhjudasx,2013-03-22T23:34Z,"The incident had no impact on my personally/physically.. just damage to the vehicle... bills to pay to fix it.... as a vehicle is a requirement for me.

And yup.. taken 2 is up.. as you already noticed.

In terms of the back to the future thing... i'm still working on getting it all sorted. It's not currently on the upload list though."
