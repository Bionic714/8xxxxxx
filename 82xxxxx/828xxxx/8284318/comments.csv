,Dark_Phoenix1981,2013-03-28T23:35Z,"Thanks for the upload, Not sure if i have done somthing wrong but, when i try to create a flightplan with FMC i cant activate the route, the button is not there that would say activate, any help would be great, Thanks again"
,Boodak,2013-03-29T01:54Z,"As i remember there was an issue with FS measurement system setting with this airplane. If u set your FS to IMPERIAL units AP and everything works fine, i had trouble with AP and systems with METRIC units. So try and see with IMPERIAL unit setting in your FSX"
,Dark_Phoenix1981,2013-03-29T18:04Z,"Thanks for the advice, but unfortuantely is not the problem as i always use imperial unit measurements, this was actually the first thing i  checked, it is only the FMC that has a problem, like i said it is when i try to activate the route before excecuting there is no hilighted ""ACTIVATE"" button"
