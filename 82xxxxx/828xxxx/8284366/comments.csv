I keep the original quality [if it's possible] for both video and audio [so...no filters...no number of channels modified....maybe a little volume gain !!]

If the source is  ""a bit grainy"" then the rip it is also ...""a bit grainy"". 

P.S. To apply some de-graining filters requires alot more computing power for H264 720p ..... which I don't have !! 

Cheers."
