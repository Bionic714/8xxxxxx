I am not familiar with iTunes, but surely they must offer the tracks in a better format than joint stereo, which is the very worst of the 3 mp3 formats, and not actually real stereo at all and has much reduced high frequencies.
Actually, so called ""stereo"" isn't actually true stereo either, the only format with separate left and right tracks is Dual Channel, the only way to get a decent mp3 file."
