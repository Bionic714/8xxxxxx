Notes
Hardcoded Arabic subs at bottom of screen, below video. Website in upper
right corner of screen on video, and worse is large Logo watermark 
that appears in middle sometimes. But the good news is the video looks
decent, and the audio sounds great and is in sync. Thanks to MyEgy for
sharing! And don't worry, there will be plenty of encodes to come 
that are cropped, blurred and filtered :)

Greetz to all the groups, uploaders, seeders and sites :)

Enjoy!
