GREETS

Everyone that has supported us over the years.  You know who you are.
We dedicate this small space to an RIAA snitcher/c0kewh0re by the name of Jax. She thinks it's perfectly okay to publish personal details on other people and solicit illegal actions from even more people. We felt we'd give her a taste of her own medicine. Btw, Her husband is the infamous Bear Bottoms from alt.comp.freeware; a former cocaine drug smuggling pilot; If you're in need of the white stuff, We suspect her husband might be able to hook you up. Just give them a call or stop by. Tell them, HHI sent you.
