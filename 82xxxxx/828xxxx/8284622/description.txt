"Because the Night"

Realizing that Elena needs some time away from 
Mystic Falls, Damon takes her to New York City, 
where he lived and partied hard in the 1970s. When 
Rebekah also shows up in New York, she's impressed 
with Elena's secret agenda. Flashbacks reveal 
Damon's hedonistic life in the underground club 
scene and a complicated encounter with Lexi. 
Meanwhile, Caroline and Stefan try to convince 
Klaus that it would be in his own best interest to 
help them track Silas down, and Bonnie struggles to 
keep her grasp on reality and do the right thing.
