"The Short Happy Life of Rita Cadbury"

After learning Skip only needs to 
complete one more assignment to graduate 
college, Emily vows to do whatever it 
takes to ensure he receives his diploma. 
When Becca's ideas fall flat at a 
committee meeting, she devises a plan to 
make her voice heard. Elsewhere, Marshall 
takes extreme measures to get a few 
moments of solitude.
