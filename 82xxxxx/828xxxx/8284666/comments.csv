,Capn.JackSparrow,2013-03-22T11:59Z,"Today I was like, ""Hey Episode 7 comes out today""

Then i saw this torrent with 15,000 seeders.
And I was like ""Holy Fuck""

I had pancakes for breakfast and fried chicken for lunch.

I also got Skyrim today.
Some glitch made all my skills 51.

Today was a good day."

,m3nt4t,2013-03-23T20:32Z,"Wow, Capn.JackSparrow sounds like an autistic antisocial hermit living in his mom's basement. So, Cap'n, have you figured out The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime yet? :P

P. S. If you don't know what I'm referencing above, you're clearly streets behind... Lulz."
