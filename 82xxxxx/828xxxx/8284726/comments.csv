,clardx1,2013-03-23T17:39Z,Thank you for the blessings but do you have Alexis Spight new cd.
,alltojah,2013-03-25T09:28Z,I noticed that there is one song missing from the Glenn Packiam-The Mystery of Faith: 03-The Nicene Creed. Was this intentionally left out or an error...thanks again
[V],TorrentTracts,2013-03-25T16:48Z,"Alltojah, I would never intentionally leave out songs.  Ever.  Because, for all I know, maybe that omitted song would be the difference maker in someone's life to draw them nearer to the Lord.

Unfortunately I wasn't aware that the track was missing.  It came to me that way.  :("
[V],TorrentTracts,2013-03-25T16:50Z,"Clardx1, I snooped around for that new Alexis Spight album for you.  So far nothing.  Sorry about that.  I'll keep watch for it though, and include it in my 2013 bundles if/when I come across it."
