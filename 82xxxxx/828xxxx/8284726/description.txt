2013 - THE YEAR IN CHRISTIAN MUSIC
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Taking a couple of weeks off has set me back.  But I think I'm finally caught up with the bundles, and most of the new 2013 Christian Music I have to offer.  I will get to the requests and the discographies in the coming days ahead, Lord willing.  But I have a couple of other projects on the go, on other websites, that I must attend to first.

For those keeping score, our year to date count for 2013 is now sitting at 250 releases, including the offerings in this 9th bundle today.
