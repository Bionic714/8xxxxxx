To the downloaders who aren't happy about the watermark; maybe you learn to read and read the uploader comments before commenting on a DL. everything is said in the comment, so if you can't read anything, maybe you should go back to scool, and learn reading and respect. most of the complainers never uploaded anything on TPB  anyway and i'm pretty sure you just DL and run. no seeding for sure. so maybez you should just go fuck your moter since you are probably from this kind of family. since you don't want to wait for

This time it's actually about the movie, no hyperbole no shock language and no trolling. 

There are several things wrong with this release, the giant MYEGY watermark in the beginning is sheer idiocy incarnate and made the movie very difficult to watch. There is also the blurry quality and irritatingly large smudge mark in the top left.  but most trouble is the fact that there are two algorithms that run when you play this movie that don't have any reason to be present. 

These could be interlacing artifacts, they could just be from a sloppy editing job or fingerprints from the mp3 encoding source/process. They could also be malicious in any number of ways. Moving the file to a FAT32 partition will quash them, but not everyone knows to do that with their files. 

I don't suggest you download this copy. "
