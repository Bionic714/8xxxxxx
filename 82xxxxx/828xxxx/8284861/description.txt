Notes: Alright source was pretty damn good, but i dont think it was dvdscr, so
tagged it as webrip. Source had arabic subs near the black bars cropping solved
that problem. Resized, sharpened and fixed AR. There was a website watermark
through out, blurred it as best as possible, there is another BIG watermark that
appears now and then, i dont think it does any harm so left it
as is, enjoy!
