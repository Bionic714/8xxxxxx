This is a Chronological Collection on Hellboy, B.P.R.D., Lobster Johnson, Witchfinder, Baltimore, Hellboy Jr., and the Hellboy Universe in general.  About half of this collection is from a previous poster.  I havenΓÇÖt seen anything bringing these excellent stories up to the present, so here it is.  I was a bit worried that Mike had killed Hellboy off, thankfully the opposite is the case.  Hellboy is in for a whole new world (or perhaps more accurately underworld) of adventure moving forward.

These stories come from the graphic label Darkhorse.

Mike Mignola & John Arcudi are the main authors.  Other artists include Mike Mignola, Derek Thompson, Galen Showman, Jill Thompson, Richard Corben,  Guy Davis, Duncan Fegredo, Joshua Dysart, John Severin, Peter Snejbjerg, Ben Stenbeck, Karl Moline, James Harren, Tyler Crook, Tonci Zonjic, and Max Fiumara.

Issues run from 1993-2013 (20 great years)

The format of all the files is either .cbr or .cbz and the language is ENGLISH (with some German, and various Enochian type languages).

There are too many issues for me to list all the specifics, so IΓÇÖll just say ALL OF THEM.
