Sorry, but the link you gave didn't work for me and the photo you posted is not the same guy, just look at the shape of the nose.

,def.ault,2013-03-27T08:09Z,"Oh, and for the other pic: 

I never claimed it's the same man, or the same nose. ;) 

I just gave an example for a relatively famous black 'german' soldier."
,def.ault,2013-03-27T08:15Z,where are my comments?
[T],Flaccy,2013-05-20T17:57Z,This is just a bunch of pictures of niggers that sakboy sucked off.

No, sorry troll, they were sucked off by your German nazi heroes first, so desperate they were to find anybody to fight their losing war....
