It is INFURIATING to see how much suffering is afflicted onto these poor dignified people for no better reason than the soul-less, monstrous greed of world bankers and corporations.

Until such time as these institutions are dismantled, the world, including North America and Europe, will increasingly suffer more and more of this fascist police-state ""Democracy"".

You ain't seen nothing yet.  And if you think that burying your heads in the sand or hoping for the best is going to make it all go away, then you are in for a whole lot of BIG surprises."
