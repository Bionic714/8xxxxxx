,phisher1631,2013-05-18T18:32Z,"the problem w/ hurling insults about one's intelligence based solely on typed words, and I'm personally a prime offender, is that typos are a poor measure or indicator of true intellect. Fer instance, ignoring any hip new street vernacular, I don't believe theres an English word ""reall"", Im assuming they may have meant really, which if so demands the use of a ""?"", and iMbred pretty much speaks for itself, not literally of course, that'd require a mouth. Glass houses folks, glass houses.  And the ""fer"" was intentional so spare me the chatter."
