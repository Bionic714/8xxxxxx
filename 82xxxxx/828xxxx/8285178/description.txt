Storyline --=

Can love release our true self? A wealthy Cuban coffee exporter, 
Luis Vargas, advertises for a US wife; Julia Russell, from Delaware, 
sends her photograph, but the woman who steps off the ship is much lovelier. 
Luis marries her immediately and gives in to love. But Julia may not 
be who she claims: first a private eye shows up on behalf of Julia's sister, 
then the sister herself. By now, Luis has given his wife access to bank 
accounts, and when she runs with his cash, he pursues her, with the help of 
Downs, the P.I., perhaps to kill her. Pursuit may be part of a con game as 
well, and Julia's past explains some, if not all, of what remains of the 
story. A priest hears her confession.
