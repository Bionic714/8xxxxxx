"Top of the Hour"

Olivia finds herself in the middle of a 
media storm, but this time she's on the 
opposing side of the oval office when 
Fitz's pick for Supreme Court Justice is 
caught in a torrid affair with Liv's new 
client, high-powered CEO Sarah Stanner. 
Meanwhile, Olivia and Jake continue their 
flirtatious relationship, while Huck 
takes Quinn under his wing and Harrison 
and Abby try to figure out where they 
stand with their friendship. Back in the 
White House, Cyrus and Mellie continue to 
fight for Fitz's attention, but someone 
else may already have it.
