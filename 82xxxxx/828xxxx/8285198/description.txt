I didnt have any of the Japanese DVD's to rip so I found the best source I could find online and fixed it up to make it look better. ((You can see before and after images below the screenshot links)) It turned out very good and looks better than any other copy I have seen online.

Encoded the entire season 4 of Yu-Gi-Oh! GX which is Episodes 157-180 into high quality MKV h.264 format with Japanese audio and English Subtitles. This season was not dubbed so this torrent is subbed. ((Subtitles hard subbed by GX_ST))

Now you can enjoy this show in an amazing quality. I can promise that this is the best quality version out there as of today with confidence. I think this turned out pretty good, certainly better than before I fixed it up.

My Season 1 encodes can be found in my uploads as well
My Season 2 encodes can be found in my uploads as well
My Season 3 encodes can be found in my uploads as well

Like the original Yu-Gi-Oh! series?[/color][/b] I encoded it as well and it can be found in my uploads
Like Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's? I encoded it as well and it can be found in my uploads
Like Yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal? I encoded it as well and it can be found in my uploads

For playback all you need is the proper codec if you dont already have it. 
Combined Community Codec Pack (which I prefer) or the K-Lite Codec pack should give you all you need and more to play these back.

You should be able to hear audio just fine if you have one of the mentioned codec packs above. If you cannot hear any audio and do not want to install a codec pack for some reason, then you do not have and need the nero aac audio codec. As of today it can be found here.
