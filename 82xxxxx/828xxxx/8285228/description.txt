Red Ankh's chiptune infused Blue and Blue Two albums, as well as the Change of (Speechless) Reasons EP.  The styles of metal on Blue and Blue Two range from black to power to folk to industrial, and include some chiptune and drums only interludes.  A Change of (Speechless) Reasons is a twenty-three minute instrumental metal track that ranges in style just as much as the albums do, including bits of gabber, psytrance, and IDM.
