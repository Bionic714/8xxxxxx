,terrapin2012,2013-03-23T01:10Z,"unfortunately it isnt in the collection but i just purchased it on amazon.com and when it arrives(whenever it goes out and how it goes out, e.g 2, 3 day etc etc) i'll rip, torrent & upload promptly. great film too. deniro, pacino and kilmer shine in that flick. thanks for bringing it up as well."
