How are people supposed to become seeds that quickly when there are leechers just like them (people who just started downloading) orders of magnitude greater than the initial seeds? We're sharing the download bandwidth from the few seeds there are, thus giving us very little chance of seeding till things balance out in the next few days."

,MarQu1s,2013-03-23T05:54Z,"Anyone complaining about slow speeds needs to start using DDL instead of torrents, especially for newly released games such as this one because:

1) there's always too many leechers hence the awful speeds

and 2) tons of DDL links have just been posted which means there's guaranteed to be working links out there that are easy to find

So if you're sick and tired of downloading at less than 100 kB/s and want to max out your connection like I do at 3.5 MB/s, all you need to do is look up these three things:

-rpnet (may look too good to be true, but I can assure you it isn't)

-IDM

-filestube

BTW, I am in no way affiliated with any of the above, I just want to help those who are unaware that there are way better alternatives out there.

Im not on fucking meth lol. I can tell the difference between a scripted event and a bug. Im not a dumb person haha. Ada takes off at a very high speed and you lose her and it goes to a game over screen.  ANd nothing can be done about this, just like how leon dies after a cinematc in chapter 4 and the jake and cherry campaign is bugged and nothings can be done about those. You said you beat all the campaigns but everyone else is having problems so either your lying or you are playing a console version of the game or a non pirated version. "

Where most of you spoilt rat ass cretins love to bitch and moan about great games to the highest extent : 3

Loen Campaign: Dark and Mystery, Horror. 

Christ Campaign: Run and gun [ =

Jake's Campaign: Well, i haven't played it yet but this campaign ought to be interesting. 

My point is, this game should be for everybody. With so much more innovations, and new features to enjoy with. This game consists of variety aspects for everyone to enjoy.  
Yet, most of you dimwit pitbulls can't acknowledge such delightful aspect by hating the game across the board. It just saddens me to the fullest to see you highschool sweethearts bitching like spoilt kids because it's never enough, so to speak.

Although, me personally is having a mission bug, at the end of chapter 3 Leon Campaign. With the Boss fight. The BOW  while me and my partner are fighting this monster through the sewers  so to speak. At some point, the BOW just runs passed Loen and Helena and disappears while me and my partner are still drifting away  through the sewers filled with water?

It's WEIRD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And quite frankly, i don't think this error is fixable. So, what i did, is skip  to chapter 4-1 by using the save file editor program!

You surely have the fuckin microsoft antivirus, you have to turn it off I had the same problem, or another antivirus maybe, if you don't want to do that put it in the antivirus exclusions list, the antivirus will ignore it for a while, but they will recognize it again in the future, fuckin antiviruses!!"
,Eardo,2013-04-17T03:45Z,MrBroxh you have to do this with the steam.dll file

,Razor3982,2013-04-20T05:17Z,"Theres a virus in one of its .dll,. Ignored it, disable the Antivirus but the game doesnt start"
,Dorrsk81,2013-04-20T18:32Z,"While I'd normally be doubtful of a Reloaded crack containing a trojan, AVG has gotten much better about not giving false positives for software cracks over these past years, the the specific type of threat the RLD .dll file registers as is the wrong type for a false positive (Adware, which I've never had a false positive show as).  

Easy way to confirm the .dll file is genuinely infected is one of the crack-only torrents doesn't scan as infected for the same file. (it can make the game work and still infect your computer, it just means you now have Adware)  "

,4nt1trt,2013-04-27T15:02Z,"For those who have save problem:
1. Game wont save after CHECKPOINT: its not supposed to save game when you see checkpoint word on the top of screen, when you see ""saving..."" at the top of screen then your current position has been saved.
2. Game wont save anymore even when you see ""saving..."": this problem causes first time you installed the game and it will ask you for create save game, if you saw ""continue without save game"" or something your game wont save any progress.
3. Save has been lost after installing UPDATES: when you download update you have update setup and new crack folder after installing update and apply crack, BE SURE YOUR NAME IS PREVIOUS NAME YOU SELECTED BEFORE by opening steam_rld.ini and find username section and change it
E.g. When you use ""re6fan"" as your name, new steam_rld.ini have ""RLD!"" as your name so change it."

You freaking NOOB's of course their are Trojans and viruses in these torrents. Used with Pro grade AV/Spyware software. Why? Cause this is a PUBLIC SERVER! 

Where only noobs download crap, as its full of seeders or leechers with slow ass connections, full of all types of virus's  and  other spyware. And this placed is watched by the MPAA, RIAA or even FBI and every other anti-piracy nutz. Hell this place is currently in freaking court. LOL!

I only download legal torrents here. But 99% of the time I only use PRIVATE SERVERS where there are ratio requirements, NO fucking leechers and no 56k slowass connections to deal with and no prying eyes. And guess what same release but funny here it has trojan's but on private sites no trojan's.  Haha. Nope dude not false positives these torrents are indeed fucked or messed with.

But 90% of you have NO idea how to use a private server as why would you download as a site like this? And you're freaking connections are probably way too slow. My slowest rigs connection downs at 70MBPS and up at 20MBPS. And I use seed boxes as well.

I downloaded this game at my regular site in less that 10 min with no viruses and I seed 5 times at most. So NOOB's enjoy you're 24hr waits and spyware and other shit spreading through your crap PC's . :D"
,Glibert5700,2013-04-28T21:38Z,Can someone tell me if this includes mercanaries no mercy mode? I just want to know if it includes that mode.
,Repulsificator,2013-04-29T00:55Z,"To fix Mercenaries mode issues follow the Tunngle guide, just search Resident Evil 6 Tunngle, not only does it fix mercenaries but it enables you to play the game online too (I've used the guide to play campaign AND mercenaries with a friend on LAN)"
,Repulsificator,2013-04-29T01:22Z,To fix Mercenaries mode google Resident Evil 6 Tunngle and follow the instructions.
,tiz2,2013-05-01T11:34Z,"@ Zipgun: You're an idiot :) It's just a false positive, and only some lesser av programs picks it up. "

,4nt1trt,2013-05-11T09:57Z,"I think sending records data freeze depends on steam_api.dll
The original steam_api.dll in re6 directory before cracking wants steam installed on your system to enter the game
So install the game in another path then copy its steam_api.dll to your game install dir (backup cracked steam_api.dll) then run the game and pass steam updates then see whether mercs mode works or not."
