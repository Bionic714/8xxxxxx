This is a torrent of Visual Novels that I have gotten to work on my Android-based tablet. It includes titles such as Fate/Stay Night, Higurashi, Umineko, Saya no Uta, Tsukihime, and many others, including indie releases and even some Otome Games.

You know. For the ladies.

Each game has a separate rar or zip file (Except the few APK files floating around on top) so you can pick and chose which of the games you'd like to download.

For the games using VNDS Interpreter, just create a folder named "VNDS" on your device, copy the compressed files into that folder and extract them in the "VNDS" folder. Then, Install the VNDS Interpreter app and point it at the games.

For The Ren'Py based games, it's much the same process, but you should make a different folder called "renpy" and place the games there instead.

Here's a couple sites where I found VNs and the conversion programs for them.

Plus a cool site that has information about messing around with VNs in general... This is where I found the link to Katawa Shoujo.
