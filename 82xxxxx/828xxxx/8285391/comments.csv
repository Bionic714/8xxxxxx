I could close down the firewall and embrace the trojan as people recommend while saying its not really a trojan. But since this crack has the same file without the trojan, i do believe the other trojan is real and i rather go with this one :)"

,SpeeDyG606,2013-03-23T23:23Z,"I think he is right... i had weird issues with Rlded crack... this one works... but i dont know its the game or is there some kind of issue coz i dont have a main menu at all, game just gets settigns everytime and leon campaign just starts "
,Stefanovics,2013-03-24T11:53Z,it doesn't fix the issue of leon in chapter 4-4 when after the cutscene Leon dies anything you do
,NakanoSan,2013-03-25T07:37Z,"""The RELOADED steam_api.dll is a real trojan""

Yeah this ""real trojan"" allowed me to beat the entire game with zero problems."
,NakanoSan,2013-03-25T07:50Z,"@SpeeDyG606

Except these ""issues"" that you are naming are part of the game. You get the graphics options settings in the beginning of the game, and then you're thrown into the Prelude chapter right away."

Well, why are you here then ?"
,di3s3l,2013-03-30T15:44Z,"works and saves the game!!But i notice if u choose to continue the game u must choose the offline mode, otherwise the game crashes!"
,Violentos,2013-04-07T06:50Z,"Just be careful folks, when I applied this crack it deleted my save file or reset the location of it. I had to start over again."
,Dorrsk81,2013-04-20T18:28Z,"While I'd normally be doubtful of a Reloaded crack containing a trojan, AVG has gotten much better about not giving false positives for software cracks over these past years, the the specific type of threat the RLD .dll file registers as is the wrong type for a false positive (Adware).  

This .dll however scans as clean, so thank you for posting!  Easy way to tell the RLD file is genuinely infected. (it can make the game work and still infect your computer, it just means you now have Adware)"
