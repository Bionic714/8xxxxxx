,Pacinolp,2013-03-22T06:06Z,"Gj dude, very fast up!"
,BoredSoul,2013-03-22T06:23Z,"Thank you very much. Hopefully the game runs smooth on my GT 530. The Benchmark was terrible, though ... hardly optimized."
,ofekgabay,2013-03-22T06:24Z,is it work?
,ofekgabay,2013-03-22T06:27Z,.

,EdyMaster,2013-03-22T08:10Z,Portuguese (BR) language?
,anab0lix,2013-03-22T09:58Z,Are the cutscenes in Russian..?
,ddonindia,2013-03-22T10:12Z,Someone should repack this ..... 
,anab0lix,2013-03-22T10:58Z,"Please help seed!


I will seed after it is completed.

Thank you"
,anab0lix,2013-03-22T12:39Z,"FUCK Skidrow's site.  You have to do scam surveys to not even be able to download.
SCAM SITE"
,TheDragonReborn26,2013-03-22T12:39Z,"Torrent works great. Changing the language to your preference is simple but I got to the part after the helicoptor and saved so I could quit and change some things. It said it was saving my game, but now whenever I go back it doesn't have a ""load game"" option. It just has you choose your graphics setting and brightness and starts from the beginning . Anyone else having this problem."
,TheDragonReborn26,2013-03-22T12:51Z,"Well I looked it it up and apparently it doesn't matter if it said ""Save successful"" or whatever. You have to completely beat the entire beginning part of the game where it throws you right in before you get to an actual checkpoint that you can load from. So be prepared to spend at least a good 30-45 minutes playing before you can actually save your progress. Just a heads up. Again, torrent works great. Thanks Hero."
,anab0lix,2013-03-22T13:10Z,"Thanks for the update bro.
Is it in english by default?  

Still only about 32% done DL'ing."
,Alexsoteam,2013-03-22T14:21Z,Its is in english?
,anab0lix,2013-03-22T14:46Z,"Is this torrent good to go or are there errors?

Why was it repacked?"
,Papanatitas,2013-03-22T15:46Z,"Come on guys, 31 seeders out of 1k+?

Seed for crying out loud!

I'll keep seeding this game 1:1 as soon as I finish downloading. People should stop downloading and not sharing attitude. Not cool at all."
,anab0lix,2013-03-22T16:09Z,"So can you play co-op online?

And can you change the Russian text to english?"
,jumaru7,2013-03-22T16:39Z,Ok wtf it says press any key i keep on pressing the shet and it always takes me to the graphic settings and back to press any key what a fking joke is this? 
,jumaru7,2013-03-22T16:43Z,Okim in press any key screen i press any key and it takes me to the graphic settings and back again
,jumaru7,2013-03-22T16:44Z,Where is my damn comment
,jumaru7,2013-03-22T16:47Z,Pioskariolis mou svinei ta comments
,Rando_q1,2013-03-22T17:42Z,Ty for up.    how to change language??????????
,kiason,2013-03-22T17:45Z,getting this one but anyone got an eta on heart of the swarm
,anab0lix,2013-03-22T18:05Z,"I just installed.  Put nodvd files in to main Steam folder.

Clicked RE6 desktop icon. and it says failed to initialize steam.  FAIL. what am i doing wrong?"
,anab0lix,2013-03-22T18:24Z,"Nevermind I put ""nodvd"" files in the wrong folder.

Ok this is how it goes:
1.Install game.
2.Open Nodvd folder
3.Open steam_rld
4.At bottom erase 'russian' and type english
5.Take two files in nodvd folder and place in
""C:Program Files (x86)SteamsteamappscommonResident Evil 6BH6.exe""
6.Create shortcut of BH6 and place on desktop and rename RE6
7. ENJOY! :)"
,speghead,2013-03-22T18:49Z,"Works great! Like any other game, run setup.exe then copy over the cracked files.
It will be in russian until you edit the steam_rld.ini to say ENGLISH.  It is read-only file so you may have to save in another folder and copy it over. Thanks HeroMaster"
,speghead,2013-03-22T18:55Z,"oh and to get past the graphics options screen you need to hit OK , not ESC"
,anab0lix,2013-03-22T19:03Z,Online co-op does not work. Crashes every time.
,kaits,2013-03-22T20:21Z,"no audio for me  , can someone help please?"
,ribox60,2013-03-22T21:34Z,"Im little confused as to how to get this game to save, can some one please explain? Is this torrent no good? When u press ""any key"" at the start up it goes to graphic settings then starts the game right from the very beginning. Isnt there suppose to be a screen to chose which campaign  you wanna play? I dont if there is suppose to be a screen like that cuz  I never played the game on consoles. But bottom line is i would like to save, any help would be appreciated. "
,anab0lix,2013-03-22T21:59Z,"When you first start the game with Leon, that is like an intro part of the game.  You play for a bit with him and then eventually once you get to a cut scene the actual game starts and you get to choose what character you want to play with."
,Rando_q1,2013-03-22T22:25Z,crashes after i choose to play champagin with leon.... insta crash when going to loading.
,BoredSoul,2013-03-22T22:47Z,"It works fine. There's just one problems in  mercenaries. After finishing a round it freezes or get stuck ... It just says, sending records data. =/"
,ribox60,2013-03-22T22:54Z,"@anab0lix thanx for the info, you are correct. Looks like I didnt play long enough"
,Papanatitas,2013-03-22T23:13Z,"Working great so far. Running MAXED @720p under an APU A8-3850 stock 2.9ghz speed + an old HD5770 and 8GB DDR3 FLAWLESSLY.

Dunno why they gave so mehish reviews. This game is packed with lot of action and the QTE are not that often like they said. They nailed with this game. Grats uploader!"
,EdyMaster,2013-03-23T01:25Z,What are all the languages​​?
,steveosek,2013-03-23T01:54Z,works fine now. i'm in the tutorial. we'll see how it goes. 
,bandisto,2013-03-23T03:44Z,error a 53% at instal ...any idea plz ?
,Osceana,2013-03-23T05:33Z,"anab0lix, THANK YOU. Your instructions were really clear and helped me. Much better than the instructions in the description.  

*One note though: after I installed it I got an error: ""This application has failed to start because D3DX9_43.DLL was not found"". If you get this, you have to update your DirectX (even if you have the most recent one). Do it at this link: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35 . After that the game will work, but it takes a while to load up the first time (let it sit though, because the screen will just be black with a different cursor for a while, but it will load up eventually)..

THANKS!!!!"
,Rando_q1,2013-03-23T08:14Z,my mistake... works like charm..... new day refreshed brain:D nice game tho....
,anab0lix,2013-03-23T08:33Z,"Np bro, glad I could be of help.

I know that feel when you want to play something you've been waiting for and it just isn't easy.

I love how the game reads xbox controller and also has good mouse/kb controls.  

Game is great in terms of graphics, beautiful cut scenes, and story.  Game play eh, too many of those random buttons things.  Amazing how far they came with games though.

Just beat Leon's campaign in 5 hours.  Give the game 7/10 SO far."
,psychonecro,2013-03-23T14:23Z,"when clicking setup, i get a error screen with some russian and english text""(russian) Extractingtemporaryfile: The file gws.dll has not been found.""

,psychonecro,2013-03-23T14:55Z,nvm It wouldn't install because of my anti virus

,ronthegamer,2013-03-24T18:57Z,"ATTENTION TO THOSE FACING A BLACK SCREEN ISSUE AFTER LAUNCHING THE GAME


THIS IS HAPPENING TO MANY GAMERS APPARENTLY, SO YOU ARE NOT ALONE


IF YOU GET A BLACK SCREEN WITH THE LOADING CURSOR IN THE MIDDLE

THEN WAIT FOR 5-15 MINS, THE GAME WILL EVENTUALLY LOAD. 

ONCE YOU ARE PAST THE GAME VISUAL SETTINGS, EVERYTHING GOES NORMALLY (THE WAY IT SHOULD BE)



MINE TAKES ABOUT 5-7 MINUTES TO LOAD



IMPORTANT:

EVERY TIME YOU CHANGE THE VISUAL SETTINGS YOU WILL HAVE TO WAIT ANOTHER 5-15 MIN (DEPENDING ON YOUR MACHINE)

SO TRY TO CONFIGURE THE SETTINGS USING THE TEXT DOCUMENT IN YOUR DOCUMENTS FOLDER(CAPCOM/RESIDENT EVIL 6)

,lordramza,2013-03-27T05:45Z,"This Works Fine

,skurt671,2013-04-07T05:56Z,"I'm also having a problem regarding audio. I've installed and reinstalled as well as look online for a solution, but it seems that whenever I start the game, it's dead silent. The problem is specifically with this game, everything else is 100% audio.

Anyone that can help me out?"
