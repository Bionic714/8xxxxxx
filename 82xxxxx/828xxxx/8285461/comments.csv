Faye Kellerman Bibliography (she has a new one soon too)

Kathy Reichs (Newest Temperance Brennan due for release on August 27th, 2013)

A BUNCH of cleaned up torrents from what I previously uploaded: Conor Fitzgerald namely.

Jo Nesbø has 2 books out in the US this year but only one so far is getting released as an eBook (pissed royally about that lol)

Karin Fossum is getting updated as well. There is so much to do! "
