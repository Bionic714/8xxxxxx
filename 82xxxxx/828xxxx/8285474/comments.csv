,tingya,2013-03-22T11:49Z,"A/V=5/4 
Watchable"
,Lucixir,2013-03-22T12:29Z,"As I was leaving a comment someone left a A/V score of 5/4, which I feel is very undeserving.

This is one of the better Cams I have seen for a long time and would easily rate this:
A=7
V=7

There was no rating as I was waiting, and I just seen the new comment as I was typing mine out. The quality is very good, it is not too dark either and I didn't notice any focus issues. Granted not as good as a DVD but definitely 7/7 if not 8/8. Point is, for a pretty new show, not out on DVD, I have no issues watching this."

,Josh-rko,2013-03-22T21:27Z,Really good quality for a cam. And very watchable. Thanks I'll be watching this movie later on.
,TheAsset,2013-03-23T01:41Z,there's a black dude in the movie whose real name is Morris Chestnut...lmfao

Watchable  thanks LegendET. Seeding over night. i sleep about a good 6 to 7 hours so thanks and your welcome "
,thugzlyphe,2013-03-23T09:17Z,Yeah that guy is the Ricky from Boyz in the Hood. Which was a great movie btw.
,krimsonater,2013-03-23T11:16Z,"I had to leave a comment on this dl, cuz it's one of the best cam's I have ever seen. This is coming from someone who hates cam's. I mean I really hate them, well, most of them. The only one I have watched all the way through, lately, was the Mama Fixed Web Rip. This is much, much better than that. Don't know what cams these people that rated this have seen, but I defy them to name one better. only way these ratings make sense, is if they include 1080 as a 10. For the person that left the ""watcheable"" comment, what an ass you are."
,Dynasaty,2013-03-23T15:50Z,Prob the best CAM I have seen...very nice.  TY. 8/8

,BosuxRedsux,2013-03-23T19:50Z,thanks
,Kalika1,2013-03-24T00:39Z,"There seems 2 b mixed ratings for quality, as per usual, and while I have to say Thanks to Legend for the UP, much appreciated, this is definitely NOT one of the"" best Cams I've ever seen"". The audio is better than average for most cams,which is great, and when the video is actually in focus it's quite clear, but the problem is that it's constantly going out of focus, and at some pretty important points in the film, which is irritating to say the least. I'm not sure what movie Lucixir was watching, but it wasn't this one. There are intermittent focus issues throughout and the dark scenes are hit n miss: most are quite clear, but others combined with being out of focus are undecipherable. The other commenter was right, if you don't mind constant focus issues and some scenes too dark/out of focus to really see what's going on..then you would consider this ""watchable"".

Without focus & dark issues(for a cam):
A/8
V/8

WITH Focus/dark issues:
A/8
V/5

Lets be real here ppl, watch the movie all the way through before rating the quality, some ppl have limited bandwidth & rely on our honesty to choose what to D/L...it's not like the samples are gonna include the worst A/V parts of the movie. The Upper knows what he's posting, he's not gonna be insulted cause you're being honest instead of blowing smoke up his ass ;) Once again, thanks 4 the Up Legend, was worth watching, for me anyways :)"
,Johnsgirl,2013-03-24T01:52Z,I hope this movie is good. Are the screenshots real?
,Johnsgirl,2013-03-24T01:52Z,Are the screenshots real that are posted on this to review
,impala63rag,2013-03-24T02:02Z,"This is the best cam copy I have ever seen. Seriously, this guy deserves an Oscar for this cam recording! Even those those that will not watch anything but dvdrip's will be more than satisfied. 

V/9 A/9 for a cam
M/8 "
,payaso13,2013-03-24T04:51Z,Its already done lol ending sucks but still a great upload 
,SikDuc,2013-03-24T06:01Z,"Just like others mentioned... out of focus wayyyy too often and dark. Keep looking... this one sucks!

Thanks for the upload."
,DrMD,2013-03-25T02:06Z,"As soon as I saw WWE in the opening credits I knew it was a slippery slope downhill and boy did it roll,this movie has horrible acting and scenes never mind the audio/video quality which is better than the acting in this movie, resist downloading then watching if you can, I stopped then deleted after 20min."
,maxjasper,2013-03-26T00:18Z,Thanks a lot bro

,hotnutz,2013-03-27T22:12Z,thanks and for a cam the quality is great.one of the best cams i ever seen.movie was better than i thought it would be too.7s across the board 
,SinBin16,2013-03-28T20:02Z,"A-5 audio cuts out a couple times
V-5 blurred sometimes but watchable
M-3 Halle Berry's fine ass not so fine in this film but it's WWE films, need I say more..wish they'd stick to cable where they belong. Just my opinion "
,MailerDaemon0,2013-03-30T03:19Z,"Well... As long as you don't mind multiple focus issues and some scenes too dark/blurry to really see what's going on, you could consider this ""watchable""......

Overall its better than most of the cams out there, so thanks for the UP LegendET!!

V:6.5-7 (For a CAM)
A:4.5-5 (Sounds tinny overall and muffled in spots)

M: Not gonna go there except to say, glad I avoided it in the theatre and watched the new G.I Joe movie that just came out today instead."

,shadevice,2013-04-08T07:53Z,"7/7

Movie is good, better to watch with your lady friend though. Chick flick thriller"
,PltosChrm,2013-04-09T03:08Z,"     This is BY FAR the best cam I've ever seen.  It looks more like a dvd rip, honestly. Also, there's no  annoying things you'd usually see from a cam: coughing in the background, someone walking past the camera, the fuzzy rubbing sound of the taper moving the cam etc...  The only time I even realized it was a cam was in the end where people laughed at a funny part.  
     I generally HATE cams for those reasons, but this one is a lot different, and I would truly recommend this torrent.  From now on I;ll be looking out for this uploader and even though I still shy away from cams, I will check the screencaps, as the entire movie has the same visual quality as the thumbs -- no retouching just to get people to DL.

The movie was good too.  Halle Berry said ""I'm not my hair"" when people asked about her changing it to fit the role and she was exactly right -- she shows in this movie why she got an Oscar, and while this is not an Oscar worthy flick, it is well worth the watch.  Good acting throughout and Halle actually didn't have to carry the movie herself; everyone did a great job.

A-9
V-9 (not 9 ""for a cam"", but 9 in general.  This movie looks as good as, if not better than many rips that I've seen.  
M-8 Like I said, not an award winning film, but great acting, good plot, original story, and great pacing -- it was eciting from start to finish.

Great job, Legend! "
