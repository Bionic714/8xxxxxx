Shamrock City (2013)





Blending a sincere love and respect for the traditions of Irish music with a sense of melodic and instrumental adventure that suggests a clear focus on the future, Solas have established themselves as one of the finest Celtic folk groups working in the United States, with more than one writer describing them as perhaps the finest Irish traditional band extant.
