                  winter wonderland, and even Washington D.C. Duke Nukem
                  3D: Megaton Edition features polished OpenGL visuals,
                  native compatibility with modern PC and Mac computers,
                  Steam Achievements, and Steam Cloud support. Duke Nukem
                  3D: Megaton Edition will continue to receive feature
                  updates including Steamworks-enabled online multiplayer,
