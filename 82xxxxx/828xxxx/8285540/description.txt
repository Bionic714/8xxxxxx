Nashville singer/songwriter Josh Rouse is to release his latest album, The Happiness Waltz, on March 19, 2013 through Yep Roc Records.
Reminiscent of his earlier work, the album features a mesh between his throwback ΓÇÖ70s feel and an undoubtedly contemporary spin. After relocating to Spain and nine celebrated studio albums, Rouse has reunited with producer Brad Jones on his latest oeuvre, which explores his experience as a husband and father of two.
Josh RouseΓÇÖs work has encompassed many different moves and has spanned over 15 years. According to Rouse, ΓÇ£The common thread running throughout The Happiness Waltz is derived from a newfound wisdom that can only be the result of life-changing transitions. For Rouse, it is his loved ones who have provided the inspiration.
