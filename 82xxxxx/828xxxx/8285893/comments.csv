,nomad1980,2013-03-22T11:28Z,It will be hard to get this one right. You have to destroy the book as this is only a graphic novel. Someone could get the digital and do screen shots?
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-22T12:49Z,"i downloaded it because i wanted to defend the scanner, but it's pretty bad. i agree that this is a hard graphic novel to scan, but this could be a lot better. it's 76 pages yet there are 38 double-page scans, and page 6 or so is inexplicably rotated 90-degrees right.

anyway, i'm torn. scanner, if you read this, thanks for your effort but please read http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7951651/Novus_Scanning_Guide_v1.0_%5BNVS-D%5D  meanwhile, leechers, if you don't like it, buy the book. it's only $6.39 on amazon ferchrissakes."
,The-IT,2013-03-23T01:32Z,I'll wait for the digital version to be uploaded. Thanks
,TNBG,2013-03-23T19:11Z,Thank you so much!!
,lifedra,2013-03-23T23:24Z,It's not in the right order.
,AweDRay,2013-03-25T10:15Z,"Does anyone have an idea of whether the digital version will be uploaded here? I appreciate this copy as it is the only one available now, but I would like one in a proper order for my sister. Thanks, though."
,hbobby2,2013-03-26T20:40Z,very readable. especially for being out so recently. Thanks mister. ^_^
,evilkumquat,2013-03-30T21:22Z,"Yeah, it's not a very good scan but a lot better than Promise 3 that first arrived a year ago.

In order to read it properly, you need to:

1) Change the extension to ""ZIP"",
2) Extract the files to a temporary folder,
3) Rename the first ten files by adding a zero to the name (Page 0 into Page 00, Page 1 into Page 01, Page 2 into Page 02, etc.) - this will fix the page order problem,
4) Rotate the one page that was wrong,
5) Create an empty ZIP folder,
6) Move the corrected images into the new ZIP folder,
7) Rename the extension to ""CBZ"" and you're done.

Again, thanks to the original scanner, and what he has is readable, but without sacrificing the book or waiting for Dark Horse to release a digital copy, this likely will be the best version we'll see in a while."

Thank you for the intructions. I was going to wait for a better upload, but now that everything is in order again, I'm happy with this one.

Thanks again!"
