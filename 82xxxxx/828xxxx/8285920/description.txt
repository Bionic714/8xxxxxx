It is no doubt the best David S. Ware album in years, sounding like a kind of
home-coming, a very warm and coherent album, with a spiritual and mystic touch,
yet also very abstract in nature, fully improvised and with no discernable
themes. Ware is magnificent, but Cooper-More's participation is possibly the
most characteristic feature of the overall sound, rawer than Shipp, more
pounding, angular and rhythmic, in his own typical style, yet strongly
influenced by Cecil Taylor, more focused on dynamics and sound than on
harmonies.

Muhammad Ali, brother of the late Rashied Ali, plays a duet on this album,
"Duality Is One", that takes the Coltrane/Ali Interstellar Space reference into
a new generation. Muhammad Ali is excellent, also on the other pieces.

You could say this is a quartet album, rather than a David S. Ware album,
because he gives more space to his band members, but that was already apparent
in his other recent albums, with Parker and Cooper-Moore getting ample room to
perform solo or duo.

The quartet takes you along on a fantastic journey, full of intensity,
ferocious expansiveness to more meditative and spiritual moments and back, with
Ware's phenomenal playing alone making this album worth the purchase. The way
he can create something strong on the spot is remarkable, setting a whole scene
and atmosphere with a few notes, being expressive and lyrical while at the same
time keeping overall cohesion of the band, giving each improvisation its unique
and recognisable characteristics. This is not given to many, and with an end
result that is both beautiful and deeply resonating, it makes it even better.

Free jazz at its best.
