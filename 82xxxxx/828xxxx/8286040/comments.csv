[V],psspss,2013-03-22T11:16Z,"i converted to my xvid format and added a folder for it.. as I think more are coming well.. another episode.. as all these sci ones seem to be 2 parters

if you really want my conversions of the above link I can add it I guess but I have to watch my data caps again.. eaten through 1/5 of it already in a few days!"
,q2323,2013-03-22T18:55Z,"thanks..

,SerSpec-V,2013-03-23T02:07Z,"@psspss, get a 20dbi panel antenna and a high power usb adapter and you can pickup wifi signals from several kms away. It will pay for itself in no time. It works for me ;)  Thanks bud!"
[V],psspss,2013-03-23T02:30Z,"this is no america with fast nets and heaps of data
people around the country here dont have much

remember most routers are only 50mw.. its enough to only get a signal 20meter around their homes

also people here are more tech savvy... and more aware on data usage and security its not worth hacking internet routers"
,SerSpec-V,2013-03-28T01:34Z,"I know routers are only 50mw that's why YOU get the power to pick them up. Most people here have way more internet than they actually use. I have the 2nd lowest plan for cable internet and it's 10 Mbps and 60gig. The next is 90G, 100G, 175G & 300G. It's amazing how many people have 90Gig and don't even DL any movies/TV, that's where I come in to help use it up ha ha."
