,R3dRuM101,2013-03-24T15:25Z,Dead torrent.. please delete.
,kaizad1227,2013-03-25T09:33Z,I will reupload
,nwumo,2013-03-25T09:51Z,"Delete this torrent, no seeds."
,nwumo,2013-03-25T15:28Z,"Kazaid please seed at least to arrive at 10 active seeders, then we'll seed... Thanks! :)"
,scare99,2013-03-25T16:00Z,pls seed
,FWALS,2013-03-25T17:47Z,"There were 3 seeds at one point, but noone seemed to be getting anywhere..."
,FWALS,2013-03-25T19:33Z,"Is anyone beyond 5%? And when there's the seed, is anyone connecting to it?"
,duderox30,2013-03-26T02:47Z,i cant even connect.....we need to post this everywhere because almost all the players got black ops through torrent and have been looking for ward to this....all we need to do is let them know then we will be in buisness
,FWALS,2013-03-26T03:45Z,There is a problem with the ccc.de tracker. Possibly the issue?
,sasvarizoli,2013-03-26T16:09Z,"then why don't you use another tracker?
I have the old black ops (1.15) on my mac and the multiplayer doesn't work. I read on some forums that you need version 1.16 in order to play the multiplayer and the zombies part.
I really wanna play the zombies part! is there anything I can help you with?"
,FWALS,2013-03-26T22:02Z,"Dunno. How do we get this to work? Whenever there is a seeder, no one seems to be able to connect. Something wrong on the ULers end?"
,sbk06,2013-03-26T22:48Z,"I am stuck at .5%. like a lot of people, @kaizad1227, thank you for the upload it has been long awaited, but i think that there is something wrong with your upload. if you could re-upload and try to fix the problem it would be much appreciated. once again thank you for the upload :)"
,duderox30,2013-03-26T23:39Z,yes a re-upload seems like a logical next step. the only reason there are no seeders is because no one can connect
,josho1790,2013-03-27T03:55Z,Please SEED!!!!! it stopped at 0.5
,sparky1274,2013-03-27T04:48Z,"Hey guys I think this is a scam all of his other torrents have no seeders, or he does not know how  to upload torrents properly."
,duderox30,2013-03-27T06:48Z,are we just skrewed
,sparky1274,2013-03-27T15:08Z,Kaizad if this is not a scam then please seed until there are enough people finished that will seed.
,romano_b,2013-03-28T13:55Z,Only 0.005 available... what can we do to fix this ? maybe reupload ?
,FWALS,2013-03-28T19:29Z,reupload please

,FWALS,2013-03-30T05:23Z,"@kaizad1227
Would you be willing to send this file to me, and I could try uploading it?"
,kaizad1227,2013-03-30T09:00Z,"@FWALS 

Sure as long as you include KKW in it. 

But how do I do it?"
,sasvarizoli,2013-03-30T09:51Z,"you could try this

,FWALS,2013-03-30T13:08Z,"@kaizad1227

,sasvarizoli,2013-03-30T15:35Z,you can also send me the private torrent too so that i can help @FWALS seed the torrent. I have a torrent server at home so uptime is not a problem for me. my email is sasvarizoli@me.com
,BritchiV,2013-03-31T13:09Z,"make a reupload please :) stuck at 0,5% :(("

,kaizad1227,2013-04-12T16:31Z,i am super/constant seeding. i will seed 4 a year. u guys keep on downloading and seed after u r done
,FWALS,2013-04-12T23:02Z,could you send this to me kaizad1227 so i could try to reupload this?
,FWALS,2013-04-12T23:14Z,or maybe do an NAT/firwall test to see if your torrent software's port is ok? Maybe why noone is connecting?
,Rocha.MD,2013-04-29T15:57Z,"Heyy kaizad1227, please seed some more so I finish then I'll help you seeding."
,kaizad1227,2013-05-10T12:59Z,"Here is the reupload
