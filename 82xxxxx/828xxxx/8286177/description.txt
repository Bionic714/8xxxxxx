NOTE


SOURCE: NOT REALLY SURE TBH!
GOT THIS FROM blu3army FROM ANOTHER SITE THANKS BRO 
SOME SAYING IT'S A SCREENER AND OTHERS ARE SAYING IT'S NOT!
COULD BE A WEB RIP BUT NOT REALLY SURE 
THERE IS NO CAMERA MOVEMENT,NO FLICKER AND NO FOCUS ISSUSE SO IT IS NOT A GOOD QUALITY TS AS SOME HAVE STATED IT WAS, IT'S BETTER THEN THAT IMO BUT AGAIN TBH I'M NOT SURE AND HAVE NO PROOF!
EITHER WAY IT IS WHAT IT IS!
DARK SCENES OR LIGHT YOU CAN SEE IT ALL PERFECT!


OK BLURRED OUT THE LOGO ON THE TOP LEFT SIDE AND CROPPED OUT THE NON-ENGLISH SUBS ON THE BOTTOM BUT THERE IS STILL A WATER MARK (SEE 3RD SCREEN) FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE CENTER AND IF WE WOULD HAVE BLURRED THAT OUT IT PROBABLY WOULD HAVE RUINED THE WHOLE FILM SO LEFT IT IN!

I'M SURE NoZGT FROM *THC* CAN PROBABLY DO IT THO 

CONVERTED FROM AVC TO XVID AND AAC TO MP3 BEFORE WE DROPPED IT INTO VDUB SO IF ANYONE WANTS TO RE-ENCODE IT FEEL FREE 

ADJUSTED SATURATION DOWN ABIT AS WE THOUGHT IT WAS TOO RED AND PLAYED WITH INT,BRIGHTNESS AND CONTRAST A LITTLE BIT,RESIZED AND THAT'S ABOUT IT BUT I ALWAYS KEEP IT REAL FOR THOSE WHO KNOW ME AND NEVER MAKE SOMETHING OUT TO BE WHAT IT IS NOT! 
PEOPLE NEED TO UNDERSTAND IT'S NOT A COMPETITION!
MOST OF US DO THIS FOR ENJOYMENT
