,steveosek,2013-03-23T01:25Z,"What the hell. i install it, but for some reason MSE detected the steam .dll from the crack as a virus, but that's NEVER happened on any game i've pirated from EZ, any game using steam cracks, any reloaded game, nothing. so i make an exception in MSE to leave the file alone.

it gets worse. the menu reports are true. there is no menu. you see the words ""hit any key to continue"". when you do, you go straight to the display options menu. hit escape, back to title. hit enter, back to display options.

literally cannot do anything. "
,anab0lix,2013-03-23T02:02Z,"steve your a retard go kill your self noob.

Cracks give false reading as trojans/virus.

When you get to the settings screen you press OK aka Enter butter or A on the xbox controller.

RETARD"
,letslovelikejesus,2013-03-23T02:09Z,"Hey steveosek, yeah its a virus/trojan in the steam_api.dll file on reloadeds crack. Heres a crack with the included steam_api.dll without any trojans or viruses: http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8285391/Resident_Evil_6_Crack_Only_V2

And when you come to graphics menu just press enter instead of escape to start the game. But it seems like your not able to save the game though =/"
,letslovelikejesus,2013-03-23T02:18Z,"anabolix, no need to be mean to people just because you think your right.. infact, your wrong about the trojan, the link to the crack i just posted^ has the very same file that reloadeds crack has but without the warning of a trojan. This proves that it really is a trojan. Many people take advantage of crackers and put in trojans and then spread the word that the antivirus appz is wrong and that you should turn of your antivirus... if a doctor examined a girl saying she has aids, and you heard someone else say ""hey the doctor is wrong"" would you take off your protection when having sex with her?"

,ronthegamer,2013-03-24T18:56Z,"ATTENTION TO THOSE FACING A BLACK SCREEN ISSUE AFTER LAUNCHING THE GAME


THIS IS HAPPENING TO MANY GAMERS APPARENTLY, SO YOU ARE NOT ALONE


IF YOU GET A BLACK SCREEN WITH THE LOADING CURSOR IN THE MIDDLE

THEN WAIT FOR 5-15 MINS, THE GAME WILL EVENTUALLY LOAD. 

ONCE YOU ARE PAST THE GAME VISUAL SETTINGS, EVERYTHING GOES NORMALLY (THE WAY IT SHOULD BE)



MINE TAKES ABOUT 5-7 MINUTES TO LOAD



IMPORTANT:

EVERY TIME YOU CHANGE THE VISUAL SETTINGS YOU WILL HAVE TO WAIT ANOTHER 5-15 MIN (DEPENDING ON YOUR MACHINE)

SO TRY TO CONFIGURE THE SETTINGS USING THE TEXT DOCUMENT IN YOUR DOCUMENTS FOLDER(CAPCOM/RESIDENT EVIL 6)

,4nt1trt,2013-04-27T15:03Z,"For those who have save problem:
1. Game wont save after CHECKPOINT: its not supposed to save game when you see checkpoint word on the top of screen, when you see ""saving..."" at the top of screen then your current position has been saved.
2. Game wont save anymore even when you see ""saving..."": this problem causes first time you installed the game and it will ask you for create save game, if you saw ""continue without save game"" or something your game wont save any progress.
3. Save has been lost after installing UPDATES: when you download update you have update setup and new crack folder after installing update and apply crack, BE SURE YOUR NAME IS PREVIOUS NAME YOU SELECTED BEFORE by opening steam_rld.ini and find username section and change it
E.g. When you use ""re6fan"" as your name, new steam_rld.ini have ""RLD!"" as your name so change it."
,4nt1trt,2013-05-11T09:57Z,"I think sending records data freeze depends on steam_api.dll

So install the game in another path then copy its steam_api.dll to your game install dir (backup cracked steam_api.dll) then run the game and pass steam updates then see whether mercs mode works or not."
