,andrei.92brb,2013-03-22T16:48Z,Is a full game or update + dlc only ?
[V],Gh0stNet,2013-03-22T17:13Z,Only update and DLC
,D4rknecross,2013-03-23T14:36Z,Contains The 3.5GB Update???
,D4rknecross,2013-03-23T14:40Z,I Have Revenants Repack I Can Play With My Saved Game?
[V],Gh0stNet,2013-03-23T15:27Z,"@D4rknecross 
yes
@D4rknecross 
yes if it uses FLT crack and if any other then you will have to move your saves to FLT crack save location "
,Sokol80,2013-03-23T20:43Z,so this the patch that improved visuals in the game?
,D4rknecross,2013-03-24T03:25Z,THANKS A LOT SERIOUSLY
,GanjaStar,2013-03-24T13:26Z,"Seriously guys, shame on you for being such leacher cunts. I have upload speed of 30 kB/s

and yet my upload speed is maxed and my download speed doesn't go over 10kB/s.

No wonder there are private torrent tracekrs when only scumbags use public.

thanks to the uploader, but everyone else is a scumbag. downloading 3% for 2 days."
,711thorwor,2013-03-24T14:45Z,"Hi all
Is this multiplayer only mode? If so how do you use this DLC?
In that case it requires us to be online all the time while playing. 
Do I use tunnge or himachi to get this to work?"
,stingrayopp,2013-03-24T21:37Z,"after installing this updated patch file successfully, the game starts and says "" new content bug hunt was installed but some corrupt files of your content can not work properly "" --- what the hell is this warning ? please somebody give the proper solution. "
,Despara,2013-03-25T07:40Z,"Are you suppose to install this as a full game? I installed it and my picture quality drastically decreased. Looks like digital interference, it also has gone gray scale to some degree. I also can't access any of the files on their own for some reason. What method could I use to extract the files individually? This torrent just seems to be a failure. The up loader should have made the torrent only include the Bug Hunt DLC."
,FluxZone,2013-03-25T08:42Z,"Looks like everyone needs a lesson on how to file share. So here goes.

When you notice your download is going slow, it isn't because you are ""uploading too fast"" and limiting it or stopping it from uploading completely WILL NOT SPEED UP YOUR DOWNLOAD!

It's slow because other retards like you did the same bloody thing and aren't uploading to you.

And all you assholes who download entire torrents and just stop it from seeding straight away are the main cause of all this shit. 

Stop being so dumb/selfish"
,seraphon,2013-03-26T01:54Z,"To all the people leeching but not seeding:

You are what is wrong with this community, you are a fucking disgrace!"
[T],swebarb,2013-03-27T14:56Z,shut the hell up u damn cocksuckers it takes maybe time before everyone has downloaded almost 6gb and seeds back.. not everyone has highspeed nets today.
,piffnyc,2013-03-28T02:59Z,"if anyone wants to play online use tunngle . google it, you can play online in lan mode when you get it!!!"
,OscelotX,2013-04-01T09:44Z,Does this update work with the nosTEAM version? Thanks.
,Lonecat,2013-06-01T14:19Z,"In case anybody wonders again, no, this does not work with NoSteam version, only FLT version. Although the 'graphic improvement' isn't really an improvement and all..."
