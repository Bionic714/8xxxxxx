,iittopper,2013-03-23T07:40Z,it doesn't show main menu at beginning because you have to complete prologue first which is around 20 minutes . Still save game issue !
,iittopper,2013-03-23T08:04Z,"okkay i Save game issue SOLVED

when the game tells you it's checkpointing, it's not actually saving anything. That's just the point you'll go back to when you die. When the game flashes a typewriter and says ""Saving,"" then it's actually saving your progress. If you quit out of a game before seeing this icon, you'll have to redo everything from the last save point"

The problem is is that she takes off like a fucking rocket and Its impossible to catch up to her even if u use boost.  WIth This issue, and what people are saying about leons campaign at chapter 4( it crashes or something like that) leads me to believe these were programmed into the game so if it got pirated these issues will kick in thus making the game unbeatable as a way to fight off piracy.This has been done in others games  like the  never ending invincible  boss battle  in crysis 3 making it impossible to beat and the helicopter part at the end of far cry 3 were rockets nail u at every direction and there is nothing you can do about it making that game impossible to beat.
