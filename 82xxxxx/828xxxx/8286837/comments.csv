,flygirlie,2013-03-23T04:32Z,"Web of corruption thick with deceit
The language of destruction, the slughter of the meek

Under a serpent sun - we shall all live as one

No rest for the wicked, the children of god
The final retribution, the final curtain torn
Within us - the falmes of the end
Survival of the fittest, the hunt for the sacred game

Under a serpent sun - we shall all live as one

Children of chaos - born of the holocaust seed
Inherit the addiction, angels of genocide breed
Within us - the falmes of the end
Survival of the fittest, the hunt for the sacred game

Under a serpent sun - we shall all live as one

Sweetfleshed, hellbent creature
Artist of the fevered soul
Heavenly venomous rapture
Stricken numb by fear I fall"
