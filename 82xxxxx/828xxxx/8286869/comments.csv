I think the actual name of the DVD is:

PNYC: Portishead - Roseland New York

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133157/

I took the .iso of the DVD and ripped each song and extra into it's own video file. I also included the entire show in one big file as well if people prefer to watch it as a show.

I think the quality is damn good, audio is nice and loud without being distorted. My upload maxes out at 1.25MB/s so hold on through the slower speeds at first until some other people can seed as well.

Someone let me know if the quality is good and if there is enough interest in this band to keep this torrent alive!

Thanks,
Lax"

The audio track was converted to stereo AAC. There's also AC3 track but my AVR was silent and ffdshow reported it as stereo AC3. 

BTW video quality is worse than this release: http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/6701094/Portishead.Roseland.NYC.Live.1998.AC3.DVDRiP.XViD-CiA
(and that one has a nice AC3 surround track)"
