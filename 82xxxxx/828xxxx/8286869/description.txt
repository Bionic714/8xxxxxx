PNYC: Portishead - Roseland New York (DVD)


I took the DVD and broke it down into individual tracks, including all the extras. I also left the whole show, un-split, in the torrent for your viewing convenience!

All files are .mp4 format, DVD quality and resolution. The only copy I could find was an .iso of the the DVD and I just wanted the videos as separate files, so here it is for anyone else interested in it as well.

If you don't know who Portishead is, they are probably the greatest Electric, Techno, Acid Jazz, Trip Hop, whatever genre you want to call them, EVER!!! Beth is a goddess and this is music everyone should fuck to at least once in their lives! If you like this, get their cd called "Dummy". It is sublime!
