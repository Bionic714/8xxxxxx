,Skram0,2013-03-28T05:49Z,"@lizardomanson
You didn't look closely at the movie title. This is the 3D version."
,lizardomanson,2013-03-28T15:27Z,"I know now, but i will try to convert it to 2D because is the only release with Spanish language, there is another but is a whooping 27 GB or so."
,cubstudios,2013-04-13T07:49Z,yeah but how do you play this splitscreen movie on a computer? No one bothers to explain.
,uthacalthing,2013-04-14T19:13Z,"@ cubstudios & lizardomanson:

Whenever you see ""SBS"", that means ""Side by Side"".  It means the video file has been encoded specifically for 3D viewing, with each eye's viewpoint taking up one half of the picture.

To view it properly, you really need some sort of 3d-capable display, either a 3D TV (virtually all makes and models support SBS-encoded source video, just play the movie and the TV takes care of the rest), or a 120Hz monitor with NVidia 3D Vision, which comes its own 3D movie player.

If you're really set on watching a 3D SBS movie in 2D, you just need to figure out how to view one side of the video on its own.

Using the right media player, you could zoom in on one half of the picture and just watch that (VLC is probably your best bet, although I've never actually tried to do this), or if that doesn't work, run it through a re-encoder like VirtualDub and crop it down to one side or the other (doesn't matter which).

There's a couple of problems: firstly, you're losing half of the resolution, and watching, in this case, a movie that's only 960 x 1080 pixels.  Also, the aspect ratio will be halved too, so you have to stretch the resulting video (again, either using the media player settings, or rescaling the video when re-encode).

In other words, it's a big hassle.  You'd be better off downloading a 2D version if one exists - even 720p is going to look better than one half of a 1080p image, and the download will be a lot smaller too.

Hope this helps."
