,jumjumb,2013-03-24T10:51Z,"@uploader
something is going wrong here. no one can download even a Byte of the game. Maybe you should reupload this torrrent.   ...   :o)"
,plstc9mm,2013-03-24T17:49Z,"Needs more seeders. Been downloading for 2 days and nothing. Whoever created this, why don't you seed for a day or 2 so some of us can get the completed file so we can then share it out to others."
,Xentospot,2013-03-24T18:36Z,Another useless torrent. Did anyone manage to download it? It stays at zero for me.
,mehenn,2013-04-04T08:58Z,"This is the third goddamn time that this torrent has popped up again with no seeders and plenty of leechers, by an anonymous uploader. I'm beginning to think there's some ulterior motive by the uploader. Harvesting addresses or who knows. But it's impossible to be this incompetent at uploading torrents otherwise."
,mehenn,2013-04-05T02:39Z,for fuck's sake this is getting ridiculous
