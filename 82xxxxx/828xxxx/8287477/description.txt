    Burnout 3 rewrites the rules of the road with a new mantra: 
    aggressive racing required. Racing gamers and adrenaline junkies 
    are invited to get behind the wheel and experience unprecedented 
    speed and action. Use your car as a weapon and battle your way to 
    the front of the pack by taking down rivals and instigating 
    spectacular crashes. Live dangerously with a Crash mode featuring 
    45 segments, each of which rewards you for creating the most 
    massive pileups ever seen. Vie for first place with aggressive 
    driving or simply indulge your thirst for twisted metal and 
    breathtaking crashes. With stunning 3D graphics, addictive 
    multiplayer races, and over 70 cars and 40 tracks, Burnout 3 is a 
    breakneck, adrenaline-fuelled, arcade-racing experience.
 
    ... and much more!
