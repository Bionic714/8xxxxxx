,deadfingers,2013-03-25T00:47Z,"Stuck on ""sending records data"" after playing a mercenaries stage. :("
,McBar4321,2013-03-25T02:49Z,"First, Thanks nosteam the game works but I had to download a crack from reloaded cause it said steam.api.dll was missing...

When I open the game it says press any key to start, then goes to display settings and straight into the game.. 

I thought this game was local co-op? Did they remove this? (STEAM has it as coop and local coop..?) 

There is NO quit button in the game.. I cannot figure out how to quit, only ALT+F4.. Is this copy really bad or is it just the way it is? NO way to quit? WTF..

Well the torrent works with that other crack for me. I did not finish the first level, i quit out to try to play co-op.. loaded my game back up, completely had to start over. (like ninja blade!) Such a Shame cause the cutscenes are long and you can't skip them.. I heared it was a bad game but jesus....

Thanks anyway someone please reply if it has coop in the game and/or on this torrent.. (with a diff crack from skidrow I had to use.. ) UGH."
,McBar4321,2013-03-25T02:55Z,"Also, Why would I have to use a diff crack. Nosteam: All of your torrents have worked for me.   I installed it once and it said steam_api.dll is missing, then I right click part 1 and run as admin and install the game again and get the same error. My virus protection gave no messages.. Just had to use another crack and it worked.

To ALL: Sorry I must say on this game RE6 I would download reloaded's version. This one did no go well with me. Oh and I still can't quit the game.. LoL thats probly not your fault. THANKS anyway! Goodwork, keep the uploads coming."
,McBar4321,2013-03-25T05:19Z,"UPDATE: I just played the game again. After you finish the ""Prelude"" a menu unlocks and have many more options. Yes the PC version has split screen! The screens are smaller than your resolution. Hope I can tweak this somehow, very lame.

As for the torrent it's self.. If not working , disable antivirus before you install and run as admin so the crack will install I guess. I used another crack, worked for me, seems to be working good. 

The game: Well the melee attacking is complete garbage and I might never play it again. HA

THANKS!"
,balter,2013-03-25T16:34Z,"@McBar4321: ""disable antivirus..."" What a lame advice.

I guess most people could figure out that disabling the virus protection would help running a potential dangerous dll file. But why would you wan't to do so???

ffs.

,zaidiraq,2013-03-25T18:10Z,thank you very much nosteam i install the game and its work Without any problems thank you again nosteam for ur hard work

,freedom505,2013-03-29T22:52Z,"well i do not know what is going on with this download i have tried all al ready and it simply wont work, regarding sound there is none! downloaded everything from nosteam website and installed it tried to run the game did not work so guys i need your help!"
,N4lzC,2013-03-30T14:40Z,"- Somehow the crack files (which are basically some dll's) are detected as virus, so if you have enabled your AV during the installation, you'll miss those files and it wont let you start.
- Most of the cracks around the internet doesn't support multiplayer (I think the original which came with this torrent also don't) so for those, the only way to play is selecting the offline mode once you finish the prelude. Otherwise the game will crash when you create a session."
,N4lzC,2013-03-30T14:55Z,"- If you still want to play online, you'll need to find proper multiplayer cracks: h t t p ge.tt / 3rXwnAc / v / 0?c (no spaces) those works just fine. Have in mind that you'll LOSE any previous saved data.
- Steam is required and needs to be open while playing, now you ca play any of the online multi-player modes using your steam account.
Enjoy and thanks to NOSTEAM for the game!!"
