From Ploughs to Super Cars
Technology is all around us. From computers to cameras, cell phones to satellite navigation-our dependence on technology has never been greater. But how many of us ever stop to question how these inventions actually came about? Challenging the commonly held view, that they appear fully formed, out of nowhere, The Link reveals the surprising origins of some of the most important technological breakthroughs of the modern world. In this episode, Josh shows how the humble plough influenced IndyCar racing technology. It all starts more than 1,000 years ago in the English countryside, where heavy ox ploughs were a vast improvement over primitive scratch ploughs, allowing peasants to produce a food surplus and paving the way for the growth of cities.
