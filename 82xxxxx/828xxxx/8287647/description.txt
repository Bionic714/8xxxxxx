This is a collection of knitting and crochet patterns I have on my computer, as well as some charts mixed in there. A few of these are from torrents you may have seen, but most of them... I don't know or remember where I got them. Maybe Ravelry... maybe.

Also, this is my first torrent. EVER. Yay for first times.
