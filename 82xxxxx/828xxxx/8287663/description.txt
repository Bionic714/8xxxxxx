EPISODE 1: AFRICA

Across the Earth, there are traces of a long-lost world. From seashells 8000 meters above sea-level to species that seem to have jumped thousands of miles of ocean and rock formations that end in thin air - the clues are there to be found. We will piece together these clues to reveal the story of how our world came to be. In this three-part series we will go on an epic journey through a land that no longer exists; the long lost supercontinent of Pangea.
