I really like the game RED ALERT Retaliation and since its not available on PS2, i was wondering if there'll be a way you could help me out. I've seen people modifying Nintendo games to play on PS2(Super Mario), and would appreciate if it would be possible for the Red Alert, too. Thank You for all your uploads and for your time. Waiting, please."

a mod-chipped (Not FMCB) PS2, An Emulator,
or a Mod-Chipped Original PS1.  PS1 backup
games can also be run with a boot disc (Breaker Pro) or a game enchaner for playstation 1 consoles that are not chipped.

Probably the emulator is your best bet if you want a quick and easy way to play your games.

PS1 games are not that hard to find some rom websites have it for download or search for torrent files of the game you desire...

Underground gamer website will have you covered. It is a private torrent site, and you have to register and follow their rules.

Since you've uploaded a lot of games (and are still doing same), could you please help me with an upload of a copy of the game- RED ALERT(COMMAND AND CONQUER PS1), PLEASE???"
