Brian Hyland (born November 12, 1943) is an American pop recording artist who
was particularly successful during the early 1960s. He continued recording into
the 1970s. Allmusic journalist Jason Ankeny states, "Hyland's puppy-love pop
virtually defined the sound and sensibility of bubblegum during the pre-Beatles
era." Although his status as a teen idol faded, he went on to release several
country-influenced albums and had additional chart hits later in his career.
