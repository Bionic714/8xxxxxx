Lesley Gore (born May 2, 1946) is an American singer. She is perhaps best known
for her 1963 pop hit "It's My Party", which she recorded at the age of 16.
Gore's first hit was followed by many others, including: "Judy's Turn to Cry"
(US #5), the sequel to "It's My Party"; "She's a Fool" (US #5); the
protofeminist million-selling "You Don't Own Me", which held at #2 for three
weeks behind the Beatles' "I Want To Hold Your Hand"; "That's the Way Boys Are"
(US #12); "Maybe I Know" (US #14/UK #20); "Look of Love" (US #27); and Grammy-
nominated "Sunshine, Lollipops, and Rainbows" (US #13), from the 1965 movie Ski
Party. Her record producer Quincy Jones, responsible for all her hits from 1963
to 1965, would later become one of the most famous producers in American music.
