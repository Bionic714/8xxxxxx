From the Animal Collective Mixcloud sessions, in anticipation of their ``Centipede Hz'' album release, this is the 2nd Transmission, mixed by Deakin.

This week’s transmission hosted by Deakin of Animal Collective delves even deeper into psychedelia. Turquoise Wisdom, DOODcast, and Pantha du Prince join Deakin, and in their mixes each contributor takes us on a distinct aural journey through the most hallucinogenic sounds music history has to offer.
