But I wanted to ask you a favor, a request really.
Any chance you could upload the Smallville Series? I'm a HUGE fan, but can't find it in a good quality M4V format anywhere!"
,arctictpb,2013-03-24T17:39Z,"@sdrakulic - You are welcome and thank you for the support.

I will add it to my list of shows to get the Blu-ray discs, but I can not promise as to when I will get to it.  I have quite a backlog already and if I remember that show was on for 10 seasons, that will take some time to encode and upload."
,sdrakulic,2013-03-24T19:22Z,"Yes, it did run for 10 seasons. So I do realize it’s a tall order. But I wouldn’t be asking if I wasn’t desperate. I’ve been looking for these uploads well over a year now, even deeply considering dishing out the $500 on iTunes to get all 10 seasons. But I realize even that wouldn’t be what I really want because the files are locked. But I really do like the show.
But just because I’m desperate doesn’t mean I’m impatient. I’m willing to wait a good while, if I KNOW I’ll be getting them. I’ve been searching this long… what’s a little more?"

,sdrakulic,2013-03-26T04:44Z,What are some of the movies/shows you are working on at the moment?
,arctictpb,2013-04-07T06:49Z,"@sdrakulic - Sorry for the long wait to reply.  The list is pretty big.  Right now my personal main focus is on most mainstream American movie releases and motor racing such as AMA, MotoGP, WSBK, GrandAm, and IRL.  Although for posting purposes it will be mostly movies and motorcycle racing."
,sdrakulic,2013-04-08T22:14Z,So what is the likely-hood of you doing Smallville as well?
