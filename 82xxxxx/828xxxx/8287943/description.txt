Lake is a German rock music band that formed in the early 1970s under the name 

Tornados, changing their name to Lake in 1973. They mostly covered material by 

other bands in their early years, but released three singles, Come Down/We're 

Gonna Rock, King Of The Rock'n Roll Party, and Sailor. In 1975 they were joined by

remainder of their recording career.
