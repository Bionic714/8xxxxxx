The Three Best Performers In The World! For my 2010 comeback, I wanted to have in one movie the three best performers in the world, and I did it! Tori was about passion and love, the story is told through her eyes. Tarra, the European beauty, pulled out the animal in me and exposed my instinct, with Bobbi, it was about 'the game.' She's the one person who could match me move for move and understand what I like, what I want, what I need. I hope you love watching this movie as much as I love these three women. -Rocco
