THIS IS HAPPENING TO MANY GAMERS APPARENTLY, SO YOU ARE NOT ALONE


IF YOU GET A BLACK SCREEN WITH THE LOADING CURSOR IN THE MIDDLE

THEN WAIT FOR 5-15 MINS, THE GAME WILL EVENTUALLY LOAD. 

ONCE YOU ARE PAST THE GAME VISUAL SETTINGS, EVERYTHING GOES NORMALLY (THE WAY IT SHOULD BE)



MINE TAKES ABOUT 5-7 MINUTES TO LOAD



IMPORTANT:

EVERY TIME YOU CHANGE THE VISUAL SETTINGS YOU WILL HAVE TO WAIT ANOTHER 5-15 MIN (DEPENDING ON YOUR MACHINE)

SO TRY TO CONFIGURE THE SETTINGS USING THE TEXT DOCUMENT IN YOUR DOCUMENTS FOLDER(CAPCOM/RESIDENT EVIL 6)

,thefearmaster,2013-04-10T06:21Z,"ok guys here's everything you need to know :
first just some info to start with :

1- game works fine ^_^
2- it even works on a slow pc like mine ""win 7 32bit ,4gb ddr2 ram ,ati 4550 hd 1gb 

-first you mount the 1st cd then run the setup.exe  ,now wait for about 20 mins , so u might wanna go grab some beer or make some tea or fap to hentai or whatever floats your boat
-then after a while like after 70% if i remember it'll ask to insert cd2  so unmount the first one and mount the other one and it'll continue installing automaticly 
-then ...... THATS IT !!!! no crack file copying or anything ,its precracked 
- run the game from the start menu shortcut or make one on your desktop if u want
- now here's something you might need in order to run the game without a single problem :

1- make sure u have updated your graphic card drives , and have the latest Direct X version to run the game without crashes or glitches (( this game also supports Direct X 9 ^__^ yup rejoice win XP users woooooooo .
2- install Steam just in case this game need it , ""some games needs steam to run like Hitman Absolution"" 
3- disable your antivirus so it wont make the game lag or crash "" because it scans the game files or does background scanning which might cause problems like framerate drop and such 
4- close any unnecessary programs in the task bar to free up ram


answers for asked questions here :

Q- @lochin  : "" I got this problem too fatal error ingame d3derr_driverinternalerror :"" 
A- update your graphic card driver buddy and get the latest Direct X version , i had this problem with dishonored and never had a single crash from it after i updated ^^

Q- @semir1024 : ""I cant choose campaign I start with Leon chapter and i can't open main menu :( .
Please help! ""    
A- this is just the tutorial intro for the game :D ,yes you can't skip it ,just try to finish it ,its just like a 15 minutes introduction tutorial to get you set up to the game and get you familiar with it aaaaand yes you start with a buttload of weapons ,after you finish this intro level you'll get the starting title with "" RESIDENT EVIL 6 "" famous intro and ask you to select your campaign and so on then you can go out and see the menu and do your settings and so on

Q- my game doesn't save :(
A- chill ^_^ this game have a saving mechanism which is based on checkpoints "" pin icon appears at the corner of the screen "" and save points ""type writer icon"" which are triggered automatically after you reach certain areas at the game 

Q- does the game have single player split screen option ???
A- YES IT DOES ^_^ ,but i haven't tried it yet ,but i saw it in the difficulty select at the game menu 

if u have any questions post them in the comments below and i'll check them out and answer you ASAP 

have fun and seed


aaaand if you like the game , support the company and buy it ^_^
and seed for godsake XDDD ,am gonna seed for a while though"

,thefearmaster,2013-04-10T06:31Z,"oh one more thing 
if u wanna play on a slow pc or gain framerate :

disable AA in the graphics option and disable motion blur and lower the resoloution to like 
600x800 , you can lower it to 640x480 but the text sometimes might look crispy in loading screens only cause its a low resolution but its not a biggy and the subtitles is fine even at 640x480"

i again run it & it goes on....

the question is... do i have to face this at each & every checkpoint of the game ????

its killing me ....!!!"
,4nt1trt,2013-04-27T15:04Z,"For those who have save problem:
1. Game wont save after CHECKPOINT: its not supposed to save game when you see checkpoint word on the top of screen, when you see ""saving..."" at the top of screen then your current position has been saved.
2. Game wont save anymore even when you see ""saving..."": this problem causes first time you installed the game and it will ask you for create save game, if you saw ""continue without save game"" or something your game wont save any progress.
3. Save has been lost after installing UPDATES: when you download update you have update setup and new crack folder after installing update and apply crack, BE SURE YOUR NAME IS PREVIOUS NAME YOU SELECTED BEFORE by opening steam_rld.ini and find username section and change it
E.g. When you use ""re6fan"" as your name, new steam_rld.ini have ""RLD!"" as your name so change it."

,4nt1trt,2013-05-11T09:54Z,"I think sending records data freeze depends on steam_api.dll
The original steam_api.dll in re6 directory before cracking wants steam installed on your system to enter the game
So install the game in another path then copy its steam_api.dll to your game install dir (backup cracked steam_api.dll) then run the game and pass steam updates then see whether mercs mode works or not."

,hillol90,2013-05-17T11:04Z,"For those facing problem in Leon campgain Ch4  chaising Ada and the game crashes after the fighting scene between Crish and Leon .

Go to chapter select and just go to Chapter 4-5 by pressing left or right on the Chapter 4 selection (if you miss it), the Train part, just continue there since you're not really missing much, other than a cutscene with Simmons, Jake and Sherry, but once I finished chapter 4 altogether I went back to Chapter 4-4, which starts off with the laser hallway and the bomber room and once I skipped the cutscene with Leon and Chris fighting and figuring where they wanted to go... it worked! 

Leon and Helena didn't suffer being cutscened to death and I was able to continue, all you really miss is some ammo boxes and a first aid spray, but at least I'm able to continue Leon's campaign.

I just wish I figured this out before I started Chris' campaign out of boredom yesterday. I hope this works for every one else having the problem"
