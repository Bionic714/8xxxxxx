Mathematical Puzzles for the Connoisseur[Sir.Fun]||PDF file


Preface:


Nearly all puzzle books published today grossly underestimate the
intelligence of their public. The reader can no longer be enter-
tained with the simple match-trick or coin puzzles, neither does
he want to see problems purely mathematical in nature, such as
can be found in any textbook. We have tried to produce a book of
those puzzles which lie between the two extremes.

Although most of the problems can be solved by logic and
common sense, some of them may also be solved more elegantly
by mathematics.

The essential ingredients of a good puzzle are not hard to
establish. It should be ingenious but clear, complete yet concise,
if possible amusing, and have a unique solution. It is for oUr
readers to decide how many of these puzzles bear comparison
with this ideal.

Completely new ideas for puzzles are unfortunately rare and
so we do not apologise for including a few of the "Aged but not
infirm". Many of the problems are original and we claim to have
improved others.
