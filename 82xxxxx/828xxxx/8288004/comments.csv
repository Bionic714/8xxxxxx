,badlylgurl121,2013-03-25T18:36Z,"No problem, sorry about the problem."
,Lockjeev,2013-03-30T23:50Z,"Hi Sorry to be a bother, but 5 books work perfectly, the rest are DRM locked when I open them, either on the pc or my Ipad. Any suggestions? "
,badlylgurl121,2013-03-31T07:15Z,Try using the Sony reader app or PC program https://ebookstore.sony.com/download/ It's what I use and I have no problem. You do not have to have an account to use it just download the programs.
,Lockjeev,2013-03-31T13:21Z,"Thank you, I will give it a go."
,Lockjeev,2013-03-31T13:46Z,"Hi, Sorry, it's me again. I tried what you suggested, and the only ones that open are the same 5 ones. the rest say the computer is not authorized, but I authorized it with my apple ID. I think the problem is it's looking for your ID to authorize it. You most likely will need to remove the drm with epubee drm removal tool and then repost it so we can read and open it."
,badlylgurl121,2013-04-01T15:02Z,Okay try this one and let me know if it works... http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8327808/Lynsay_Sands_Argeneau_and_Rogue_Hunter_Series_1-17_Updated
