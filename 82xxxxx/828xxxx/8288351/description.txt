Formula 1 2013

Malaysia Practice Session 1

Round 2: Malaysia. Kuala Lumpur. (22-24th March 2013)
Circuit: Sepang International Circuit
Air Date: 22.03.13
Time: 01.45am-03.50am
Running Time: 1hr:59min
Coverage of the 1st Practice Session for the Malaysian GP, broadcast Live via SKY SPORTS F1 HD at the Sepang Circuit.

To reduce SKY's LIVE audio sync errors during add-breaks,the commercials have been left intact. Removing them can cause considerable encoding and playback problems as the live stream switches from Dolby Digital to standard stereo output and back during such breaks, this plays havoc with encoding the audio feed as pure 6 channel AC3 Digital.

All my torrents for F1 2013 are wrapped into MKV format. Resolution is downscaled from 1080i&gt;50 source to 720p with 6 channel AC3 Dolby Digital Audio.
These video files will play very fluidly with the standard media players such as VLC, WMP, KM Player, WMC, MP-HC.

H.264 High Profile 4.1 has been used in combination with 50fps to maintain smooth and fluid playback with HD quality...
