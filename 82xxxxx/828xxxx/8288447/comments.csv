I'm downloading at ~300 kb/s, but seeding at ~4.2 Mb/s. After one hour I've got a ratio over 1:13"
,Lazaz,2013-03-23T23:34Z,"Campaign works great but whenever I try to finish a mercenaries level it  gets stuck at ""Sending Record Data"" any fix for this??"
,ntongh2o,2013-03-24T05:18Z,"Game works fine with no crashes. There is a bug however where the game could possibly not save the game progress. ""failed to save game data"" and it will revert you to the previous save. Completed up to Chapter 4 in Leon's campaign and the game couldn't be saved so it went back to Chapter 1. Wasted 5 hours of gameplay. "

,HolyElectro,2013-03-24T17:17Z,Ey man wtf?.. The steam_api.dll is missing.. I cant play the game cause of it. I found where it is.. But Idk how to make it work. It just wont launch!
,ronthegamer,2013-03-24T18:56Z,"ATTENTION TO THOSE FACING A BLACK SCREEN ISSUE AFTER LAUNCHING THE GAME


THIS IS HAPPENING TO MANY GAMERS APPARENTLY, SO YOU ARE NOT ALONE


IF YOU GET A BLACK SCREEN WITH THE LOADING CURSOR IN THE MIDDLE

THEN WAIT FOR 5-15 MINS, THE GAME WILL EVENTUALLY LOAD. 

ONCE YOU ARE PAST THE GAME VISUAL SETTINGS, EVERYTHING GOES NORMALLY (THE WAY IT SHOULD BE)



MINE TAKES ABOUT 5-7 MINUTES TO LOAD



IMPORTANT:

EVERY TIME YOU CHANGE THE VISUAL SETTINGS YOU WILL HAVE TO WAIT ANOTHER 5-15 MIN (DEPENDING ON YOUR MACHINE)

SO TRY TO CONFIGURE THE SETTINGS USING THE TEXT DOCUMENT IN YOUR DOCUMENTS FOLDER(CAPCOM/RESIDENT EVIL 6)
