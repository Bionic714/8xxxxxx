,Brenry,2013-04-24T18:09Z,"If you get the 'unhandled exception error' immediately after loading, it's because you went from the original game release directly to 1.0.3.1

With your current setup (can be original or 1.0.3.1 copied on):

install Impire_v1.0.1.2-FLTDOX
Impire_v1.0.3.1_incl_DLC_Pack-FLTDOX

With the two patches combined, game now loads"
