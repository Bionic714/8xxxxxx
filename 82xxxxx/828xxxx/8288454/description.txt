    Impire: Creatures of the Night
     
    Be warned, Succubus and Warlock A new deliciously deadly duo  enters  the
    dungeon - one whose reflection you cannot see along with one you shouldn't
    ogle except in a mirror. The Vampire may seem like an easy target,  but  a
    word of advice: don't snuggle with her undead poodle And the  Medusa  has
    returned to Ardania with a vengeance. Rub her scales just  right  and  she
    will silently slither up on your enemies  and  fill  them  with  quarrels
     
    Impire: Black and White Demons
     
    Colors are for  babies,  babes  and  florists  Real  demons  go  for  the
    extremes Let the darkness within "shine" through  with  Baal's  demonic
    black exterior. Or make it lavishly clear how much you  hate  the  sun  by
    draping your imp in a pale white hue. Either way  you  can't  go  wrong
    black and white are always in style
