Why not zip them individually, so people can choose the ones they want. Please do so in the future and thanks for your effort."
,Sneaky_B,2013-03-23T05:12Z,"First off.... Only ONE of these PDF's are in Vietnamese...and I plainly listed it as such...

Secind... It is much safer to put all t he files into ONE zip so as to add a little more security from possible infections. 

This ONE zip file is clean and should REMAIN clean, so long as no one decides to make it otherwise.

This is just a small portion of what I have. I thought that these selections were a good choice for this pack. 

The app is over 1Gb in size alone when extracted.... The PDF's are negligible as to size....

If you don't like it...don't Download it...plain and simple."
,Sneaky_B,2013-03-23T05:17Z,"I son't know who moved this into the E-Books category, but, the main file here is the NI Multisim 11.0 and Ultiboard 11.0 application for windows. The E-Books (PDF's) are just included for reference and added help in understanding how to use the app....."
,frobknob,2013-03-23T12:41Z,"@Sneaky_B: How exactly does putting the files in one ZIP do anything to ""add security from infections""? Do you know how torrents and checksums work? 

Putting all the files in one archive forces people to download everything and makes the torrent less useful to downloaders who might want just parts of the whole. It defeats the purpose of torrents. Please don't do it any more."
,WiseOldTroll,2013-03-23T15:09Z,"Thanks for this.  Unlike some who complain about the whole thing being zippped, I do not mind.  It's not like it's a huge file of several gb's, and if I wanted only part of it, I'd look for that part elsewhere or request it from you.  I agee with you... ""If you don't like it, don't download it, plain and simple"".  (Some people would complain about being hung with a wet rope)"
[H],LemonJ-Lo,2013-03-23T18:11Z,"@Sneaky_B: It has probably escaped your attention, but there has been a malware poster active for the past month or so, who every day surfaces with a new name, posts a compressed file of a size anywhere between a few hundred MB to several GB, then disappears, only to come back and do it again with a different name.

So, you post fits the profile nearly exactly:

- first-time poster
- only one post for your name
- a single compressed file
- a screen shot accompanying the post, copied from some web site
- the compressed file is not passworded, but the contents turn out to be
- to get the password, you have to follow the link to the poster's malware site, fill out a ""survey"", and then spend a lot of time getting rid of the malware that ends up on your PC as a result.  Oh yeah, you never get the password either.

Granted, there are some differences: yours is a 7-zip file, not a RAR file, and your description hasn't been copied and pasted from the same web site as the photo, and no one has complained about a password.

However, as others have suggested, if you want to avoid this grief and getting banned, you can be entirely transparent about what you are posting, do not post an archive.  It is no more difficult to make a torrent from the contents of a directory than it is to compress that directory into a single file and post that.

If you are posting both an application and e-books, make separate posts.  Zip the app if you must, but leave the books as is.  That way, you also avoid having your post moved from one category to another.  And after all, you did put ""E-Books"" in the torrent title.

,Sneaky_B,2013-03-23T23:11Z,"@LemonJ... I DO understand where you are coming from. It doesn't show the date of when I became a member, but, I have been one since 2008. I only have 1 post (torrent) because I always downloaded what I needed FROM TPB, so, I had nothing really to contribute that didn't come from here anyway...although I do keep sharing until at least 5 seeds are returned...settings of uTorrent.

To all the rest who keep complaining about this being all included into one file....

You guys need to stop trolling, flaming and bitching. All of these files, E-Books, PDF's and applications can be found here individually. Like I did.

I put this together as A PACKAGE.... Please read the description.

If any of the files listed below catch your interest and you want only that file.... search for it here. It is available.

To finish. This is why I do not leave comments or try to post files. I did this because it took me a while to gather this together and I thought, if I wanted this stuff for myself but spent a lot of time hunting and downloading it all, there must be others who are like me and just want to skip the hunting part....

To all of you who thanked me, I appreciate it. "
,Sneaky_B,2013-03-24T01:20Z,"I have done what you have asked... check my other torrent...

[H],LemonJ-Lo,2013-03-24T03:59Z,"And thanks for listening.  All posts are appreciated, including yours.  

Like you, I mostly download, I don't generally upload anything because I rarely have anything new to offer.  But when I do download, I seed.  To me, that's basically the same thing."
,burt007,2013-03-24T07:19Z,"Thank you Sneaky, I hope you understand that no offense was meant to you, you being a first time up loader didn't know so you did what you did but in the future you can correct and upload something which is better or even perfect, we all learn from our mistakes. Thanks for sharing. And my apology if I offended you. "
,Sneaky_B,2013-03-25T01:33Z,"No worries.. I am very leery of unknown users myself...

I will do my best to just keep it simple from here on..

Thanks for the comments!
