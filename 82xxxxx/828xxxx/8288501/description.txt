Lake is a German rock music band that formed in the early 1970s under the name 

Tornados, changing their name to Lake in 1973. They mostly covered material by 

other bands in their early years, but released three singles, Come Down/We're 

Gonna Rock, King Of The Rock'n Roll Party, and Sailor. In 1975 they were joined by 

lead singer James Hopkins-Harrison, who gave them their signature sound for the 

remainder of their recording career.



Ouch! is the fourth studio album by Lake, released in 1980 in Germany and 1981 in 

the USA. It is the first album to be released following the departure of three 

members of the band from their peak period, Detlef Petersen, Geoffrey Peacey, and 

Martin Tiefense, who were replaced by Frank Hieber, Achim Opperman, and Heiko 

Efferz.
