,taistoi,2013-03-24T10:19Z,funny how all bollywood movies that get posted here have way lower seed/leech ratio than all other movies. just goes to show how selfish and greedy indian people are
,budchap,2013-03-25T01:34Z,"I spent 2 year living in India, this comment is totally untrue."
,sunny_bhai,2013-03-26T15:36Z,"In my experience, Indians have lack of knowledge about torrents.... I am also a indian.... 
most of the people in india don't know about seed/peers.....
and also there are not such good internet plans for users in india that they can give a big amout of uploading.....
that's whay indian torrents looks like selfish...."
,sanethmk,2013-03-27T04:04Z,"I agree with sunny_bhai... I live in the US, but have lived in India for a few years... the internet plans really suck.... the unlimited download plans are pretty expensive so its not an option to stay connected to the internet when it's not being used :("
,subhankardas,2013-03-27T21:09Z,It is true that in our country we have not any reliable internet facility. so it is very expensive for us to upload a huge size file.  
,subhankardas,2013-03-27T21:12Z,nice picture quality 
,deankahnn,2013-03-28T07:39Z,"nice torrent and can you please upload songs of race2,rush,and best of katrina in 720p ??"
