An often forgotten but great comedy series by the BBC about life in the RAF.

I got this from a private torrent site as avi files, but its quality was atrocious. It was very grainy, with lots of blockiness & interlacing. I have tried to tidy it up (there is only so much you can do!), but there is still some residual interlacing. At least it is watchable now!

This is the first series, first aired in 1975.

It features Tony Selby and shows some of the early talents of Brian Pettifer (Rab C Nesbitt), Robert Lindsay (we all know who he is!), David Janson ('Allo 'Allo & Keeping Up Appearances) as well as other well known actors.

Just sit back and enjoy!
