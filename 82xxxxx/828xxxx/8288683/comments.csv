keep getting the error:

The CPU has been disabled by the guest operating system. Power off or reset the virtual machine.

Any solution? Advice? Suggestions?"

,osirisd3,2013-04-10T08:36Z,"I had 10.8.2 working no problem on my Intel system (3GHz Core2 Duo, 4GB RAM, Win7 64bit, Vmware 9.0.1) assigned 2 cores, 2GB's of RAM to that VM & it worked like a champ!

But then I upgraded my system to (AMD FX8350 Eight Core, 32GB RAM, Win8 Pro 64bit, Vmware 9.0.2) assigned 4 cores, 8GB's of RAM to the VM...

and I started getting the error message ""The CPU has been disabled by the guest operating system"" I followed all instructions properly & know what I am doing, but kept getting that damn message!

I figured out the fix!
FIX:
Show all hidden files - in Folder Options
Run/double click: amd-kernel.cmd
Copy 'OS X Mountain Lion.nvram' from 'amd' hidden folder & paste/overwrite in 'OS X Mountain Lion' folder. That's it & now its working great!

The amd-kernel.cmd is not copying the .nvram to the OSX VM folder properly in Windows 8.

I hope that helps!

PS: I am having issues with getting vmware tools installed from /zackehsoul"
