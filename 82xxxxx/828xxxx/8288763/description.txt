As the BBC makes its exit from the iconic west London site of Television
Centre, BBC Four presents a special night of celebration of the building
and its 53-year history. To kick start proceedings, the nation's favourite
nutty boys and national treasures Madness take to the stage at the front
of BBC Television Centre to perform an hour long concert in front of an
assembled audience nine days before TV Centre closes its doors. To help
launch this celebration of over 50 years of programme making at TVC
Madness treat us to new material and classics alike, such as One Step
Beyond, I Never Knew Your Name, Baggy Trousers and Our House
