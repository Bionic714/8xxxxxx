This only works with my MW2 torrent, http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7368249/Modern_Warfare_2_Multiplayer_Full_[FourDeltaOne]

Drag and drop "update.bat" inside your mw2 folder with all the main, zone, bootstrap, ect folders are at

Run update.bat and wait for cmd window to popup and do its thing, after it has completed it will automatically close and auto run everything else for you so just sit back have a beer a cup of coffee what ever.
