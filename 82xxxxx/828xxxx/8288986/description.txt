Hopper Disassembler

Hopper is a reverse engineering tool for the Windows, that lets you disassemble, decompile and debug your 32bits and 64bits executables. Take a look at the features list below!

Native
Hopper is perfectly adapted to the Windows environment. It fully makes use of the Cocoa framework, and perfectly integrate with other applications.

Fast Disassembler
Hopper has been designed to be fast and responsive. Disassembling and analyzing, even large binaries, is very fast. And the memory footprint is reduced to a very small amount!

Procedures
Hopper analyzes the function prologues, and try to extract procedural informations, like basic blocks and local variables.

Control Flow Graph
Once a procedure has been detected, Hopper is able to show you its control flow graph in a graphical way. The graph nodes are customizable, and you can even export a PDF.

Scriptable
Most of the Hopper features can be invoked from Python scripts, giving you the possibility to transform the binary the way you want.

Objective-C
Even if Hopper can disassemble any kind of Intel executable, it do not forget its main platform. Hopper is specialized in retrieving Objective-C informations in the files you analyze, like selectors, strings and messages sent. 

Debugger
Thanks to its free companion application, Hopper is able to use GDB, which lets you debug and analyze the binary in a dynamic way.

Decompiler
And, if you still want more informations about the program you analyze, you can ask Hopper to generate pseudo-code from procedures, which takes advantage of the results of its analysis!
