There are some serious problems with the official story. Aluminum planes do not crash through steel buildings, only to emerge out the other side. When an aluminum plane hits a steel structure it crumples bends and falls apart. Aluminum is a very soft and light metal, a plane has to be light and the metal thin in order for it to fly. Also the calculated speed of what ever we saw that day is a PHYSICAL IMPOSSIBILITY, analyzing the video shows an object moving some 600mph, at this altitude the density of air is too great for a jet engine to spin fast enough to reach such speeds. A realistic speed would have been 250mph for that altitude. Also no plane parts at the Pentagon or the site at Shanksville,Pennsylvania. No luggage, fuselage, tail section, wings, bodies, seats, engines !?
