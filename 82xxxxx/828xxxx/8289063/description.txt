Written by industry legend Paul Jenkins (SENTRY, INHUMANS) and drawn by comics superstar Carlos Magno (PLANET OF THE APES, TRANSFORMERS), DEATHMATCH is a dark, psychological deconstruction of the superhero genre that can't be missed.

THE FIRST ARC OF THE SMASH HIT ENDS HERE!

Factions have formed. Lines have been drawn. And now, violence has spilled outside of the arena, as all hell breaks loose in the deathmatch prison.
