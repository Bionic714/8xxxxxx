,bjornagainswede,2013-03-23T17:00Z,"I have one question...and one question only!

Why do retards like you upload torrents when you have absolutely no intention of seeding..eh?

Disgrace to the torrent community!"

hey, keep cool, I had internet connection issues and technical problems.
As far as I can see, you're not the best one to give lessons to others... it seems you never uploaded any torrents !

to the others :
now seeding, guys !"

Who are you to make assertions about others intention ?

,bjornagainswede,2013-03-23T22:40Z,"Try 3Tb with a  seed ration of 7 on Demonoid before it shut!

Nuff said!

there have been a rash of torrents uploaded here lately in which the seeder has bailed or simply shut of their machines.... Checlk out Assassin's Creed Btotherhood for example...."
,bjornagainswede,2013-03-23T23:11Z,"These Jokers with ""Internet Problems"" Never cease to amaze me.... No problem at all uploading the torrent.... only with seeding it!

TPB is not even like Demonoid which had daily downtime,,,,,, and even on there I never had a problem with any of my torrents regards seeding...

How many seeders here even bother to superseed???? 

What??? I can see some of you saying whilst scratching the noggin....."
,mac.the.ripper,2013-03-24T01:40Z,"Thx dombedos,
Dont mind moron comments from the angry kid from sweden. His own upload history is zero...
Thanks for sharing."
,bjornagainswede,2013-03-24T03:30Z,"@mac.the.ripper 

You mean the same as yours.... Smart Ass!"
,bjornagainswede,2013-03-24T03:37Z,"@mac.the.ripper

You mean the same as yours.... Smartass!

FYI - SInce TPB now hosts in the cloud and links are via magnet and DHT...ratio's these says mean SFA....

The issue isn't about how hot your ratio is... it's about Uploading a torrent and p***ing off before you have seeded a full copy! This torrent ain't exactly huge by today's standards...

Anyhow... kudos to the seeder... at least he eventually showed up for work! (better than some)

If you're such ahiotshot MTR go download a full copy of that Assassin's Creed torrent I mentioned and seed it for us like a good chap!"
,mac.the.ripper,2013-03-24T05:29Z,"@bjornfuckinswede,

Haha - what a pathetic moron. At the moment there is 42 seeders and 0 leechers on this 214 Kib torrent.
And you call the uploader a retard ???? Get offline idiot!"
,dombedos,2013-03-24T06:23Z,"@mac.the.ripper
thanks guy
come to Chile and see what happen when you need to get connected to a 3G internet connection... 
anyway the recipe to make the patch is in the comments in the following torrent :

,bjornagainswede,2013-03-25T02:06Z,"@whatckyourkipper.... Grow up and grow some balls you clown - how old are you?... I'm online . cos that's where you need to be to BOTH seed and leech torrents... if you can't handle plain fact the fuck right off you ass wipe! Least I do my bit and dont hang up the phone just before you nblow your load! I seed what I get to at least a 3 ratio on tpb.... I'll bet you don't and are having a hissy fit because I called you on your ration here being identiocal to mine... zilch! If you're the same whatckyourkipper that was on demonoid a few years back you know damn well what my ratio there was like and I remember yours..... as I think I called you on it a few times too if memory serves.... DDOn't play with fire sunshine.. you'll get your todger all burnt up!

@dombedos

Tell me about it... LOL... Claro and Telefonica at the very least - TWO of the most RELIABLE services in the world... I suggest the excuse here lies with the user... either not paying the bill... or going down to the nearest bodega and topping up!
Anyway as mentioned you did EVENTUALLY show up for work so thanks for that... There are plenty of others who don't!"
