Powerslide is a racing game set in a post-apocalyptic environment. 

It was the first of the "Powerslide" series and the only one released so far, Powerslide became known for its realistic physics and ground-breaking graphics in its time.

Graphics are nothing to write home about, but gameplay is good.

Xpadder with profiles for Xbox360 and PS3 are included.

OS: Windows XP / Vista / 7 / 8

Enjoy.
