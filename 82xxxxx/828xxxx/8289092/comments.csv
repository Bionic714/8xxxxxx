BTW a special request:  the Rogue trooper series and Strontium Dog series, they rocked!!!  can you get those?  they were under the 2000ad imprint I think....."

[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-23T12:49Z,"you're both welcome. i'll try to find compilations of the recent stuff, perhaps the person who was compiling a.b.c. warriors has done the same. meanwhile, you might know this but http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7973340/  has an amazing (considering the work involved) 761-page compilation called ""Strontium Dog: The Complete Collection from the Pages of 2000 AD"". you may want to grab that one!"

,degu2012,2013-03-24T23:38Z,"completely unrelated to this torrent i know, but do you have the S.W.O.R.D. mini series that marvel did in 2010? tried looking for it on here but tpb hates acronyms so its proving tricky. i miss demonoid so much lol"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-25T02:21Z,"degu2012, the s.w.o.r.d. series can be found in this torrent for the crossover ""dark reign"" (look for the uploader's numbers 122-126): http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7772260/

by the way, i found it using the more versatile search engine at i-s-o-h-u-n-t (remove the dashes and add dot com).  ;-)"
