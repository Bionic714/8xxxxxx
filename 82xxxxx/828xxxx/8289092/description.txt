Ever wanted to read 2000 AD but didn't know where to start? THIS week's issue is the perfect point for new and lapsed readers as we begin with FOUR new stories by some of the Galaxy's Greatest Comics' top talent -- including Neil Googe (Wildcats), Ian Edginton (Victorian Undead), and D'Israeli (SVK)!

In this Prog:

Relations between Mega-City One and the Soviets are strained to breaking point, will a secret meeting sort out their differences or are there greater dangers afoot in Judge Dredd: Cypher by Michael Carroll, with art by Inaki Miranda and Eva De La Cruz.

He may be departed but he sure is dandy, and now the stone-dead detective Dandridge is back in The Copper Conspiracy by Alec Worley and Warren Pleece! 

Pulling in a nightclub has never been more lethal in ThargΓÇÖs 3rillers by Gordon Rennie and Emma Beeby, with art by Neil Googe.

And the true Napoleon of crime is back from the dead, but will he be able to adapt to the new world order in Stickleback: Number of the Beast by Ian Edginton and DΓÇÖIsraeli?

Prog 1824 is on sale in UK stores and digitally through the 2000 AD app and the online store at 2000ADonline.com on March 20!
