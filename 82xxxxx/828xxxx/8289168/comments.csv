,ravenslayer,2013-03-24T16:35Z,"Missing opening minutes. Cam movement. Subtitles are cutoff at the bottom of the screen. Right side of screen cutoff w/ seats also in the shots. Good audio, no issues there."

,dest4mex,2013-04-25T16:33Z,"this cam is really bad. sorry but the guy can´t stop fiddling with the camera for more than a few minutes. it´s annoying. the seats in front of him are blocking the screen. he sits waaay over to the right, so he can´t get the whole screen in, most of the time it´s cropped out by the angel. the focus is out almost every other minute. this cam sucks. 
audio - good 7 
video - 1.5 maybe
movie - who the hell knows, couldn´t follow it due the poor cam. 
Thanks, BONE, appreciate it anyways. "
