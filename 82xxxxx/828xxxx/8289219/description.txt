"College Girl"

When the less-than-studious Mandy gets accepted to 
not one but two colleges, Kristin realizes it's time 
to reevaluate where she is in her life. While out on 
a special date with Ryan, she is pleasantly 
surprised to see Jon, a former co-worker from the 
diner where she still works, who is now the 
successful owner of a hip, upscale restaurant. 
Meanwhile, Mike and Vanessa wonder if Mandy's 
college choice, a party school in California, is 
right for her; and Eve gets help with her Junior 
ROTC competition from neighbor Chuck Larabee.
