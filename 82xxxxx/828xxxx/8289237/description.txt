-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My PSP collection. 

Also includes everything needed to "hack" your PSP system to cfw 6.60 pro 3. 

Also included is PSP ISO compressor. 

I took the liberty of compressing all games to .cso format and most will play 
fine this way but Grand Theft Auto has issues while compressed so included ISO 
Comprssor IF you wish to decomprss to ISO. 

Also included a convertor if you wish to change video and what not so you could 
watch on your little tiny screen. Never did this myself but hey it is your life 
and eyes and so you can do what you wish.

                                 Install Notes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS!!!!!!! I have tried to make this as simple as possible but 
if you cannot follow simple instructions..........

All programs contained are for a windows pc. If you have something else use 
google or however you go about finding things just do not troll the forums. 

Games are located in the ISO folder and they will be placed on memory card in 
the same folder. If you do not have a "ISO" folder on the root of your memory 
card do not freak out, or run in circles, or eat toothpaste. Create one. 

Am not including any psx games. I found myself not ever playing them so I nixed 
them from the collection.
