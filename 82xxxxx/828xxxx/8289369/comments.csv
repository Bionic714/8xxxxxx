,Slayer_ch,2013-03-23T20:05Z,thank you so much! Do you have the possibility to upload the first 2 episodes from season 2? Would be really great as nobody else is releaseing this series during the canada airing. The US airing is soooo much delayed.
[T],duranie,2013-03-23T20:13Z,"S02E01 and S02E02 aired last year. One was a Halloween special and the other a Christmas special.  I doubt YTV will repeat them anytime soon, but if they do I will see what I can do.  

I'm not making any promises about continuing with this show. Most of the people downloading it aren't sharing back.  It's been less than 24 hours since I posted it, it's been downloaded over 70 times, yet only 8 people are sharing it (as I type this).  Makes me think: Why Bother?
