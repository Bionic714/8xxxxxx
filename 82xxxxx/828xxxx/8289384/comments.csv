,TheDragonReborn26,2013-03-23T08:21Z,I'll preview it. But I seriously doubt TvTeam would straight up lie and put up a fake.
[V],simon200,2013-03-23T11:58Z,This IS  the same cam with a water mark added but TvTeam just swipes them from somewhere else and posts them here without looking at them so not his fault
,Polymathj,2013-03-23T17:22Z,TV team is a bot.
