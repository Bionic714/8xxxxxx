This is from the first season of Mtv unplugged.
The host in those days was Jules Shear.
This episode features two of the members of the Alarm, Dave Sharp and Twist, and also the band Nuclear Valdez.
This was converted from VHS, hence the poor quality.  
I wish Mtv would release these old episodes.  I'd buy them all to get better quality videos.
