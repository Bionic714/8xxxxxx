This new agenda for the managerial mind will change the way you think and do business.
 Eugene Sadler-Smith, a leading intuition researcher and educator in business and management, argues that human beings have one brain but two minds ΓÇô analytical and intuitive. Management has overlooked the importance of intuition, and under-exploited the potential that the intuitive mind has to contribute in areas as diverse as decision making, creativity, team working, entrepreneurship, business ethics and leadership. 

 ΓÇ£The Intuitive Mind is a fascinating and practical book that will maximize your intuition and help you make better decisions today and predictions about tomorrow! Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung would most assuredly approve.ΓÇ¥
