Here's the final update of both ESET security applications NOD32 Antivirus & Smart Security. These two security programs offer advanced detection technologies and multi-layered security features.

Designed for a low footprint, fast scanning, it packs security features and customization options for consistent and personalized security on- or offline. ESET Smart Security is built on ESET's unique heuristic technology that identifies viruses that have never been seen before. This enables them to protect your computer proactively, in real-time, against new viruses and cyber threats that conventional signature-based antivirus products don't catch. ESET Smart Security has all the same features as ESET NOD32 Antivirus with the addition of parental controls, antispam module, and an intelligent firewall.

Changes in version 6.0.314.0
Fix: Resolved issue with Anti-Theft not sending screenshots in specific cases
Fix: Better error handling during during Anti-Theft configuration
Fix: More Outlook 2013 fixes which address crashes of the plugin
Fix: Improved experience after upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 8
New: SysRescue supports Windows 8

Important Notes:
1. Any type of activation tool for ESET products will get flagged as malicious by ESET, so i recommend you disable your AV before attempting to use any of these.
2. The included MiNodLogin tool, will help insert valid keys into ESET programs. More detailed info on how to use it is contained inside, obviously.
