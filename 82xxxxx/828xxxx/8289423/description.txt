"Reunions"

Following an exhausting turn of 
events at Breakwire, Martin, Lucy, 
and Jake track down Calvin outside 
Tony Rigby's house. After Martin 
collars Calvin into helping him 
locate Amelia, they head to Calvin's 
loft where he explains Aster Corps' 
motivations connected to Amelia, 
while Jake attaches himself to a 
revealing brain scanner. Jake's scan 
provides more information about 
Amelia's whereabouts as well as a 
final piece to the puzzle for Calvin 
to communicate with his brain-dead 
brother. Armed with leads to Amelia's 
location, Martin, Lucy and Jake put 
their lives on the line when they 
attempt to infiltrate an Aster Corps 
desert facility
