 : Having made the U.S. financial crisis comprehensible for us all in The Big :
 : Short, Michael Lewis realised that he hadn't begun to get grips with the   :
 : full story. How exactly had it come to hit the rest of the world in the    :
 : face too? Just how broke are we really? Boomerang is a tragi-comic romp    :
 : across Europe, in which Lewis gives full vent to his storytelling genius.  :
 : The cheap credit that rolled across the planet between 2002 and 2008 was   :
 : more than a simple financial phenomenon: it was temptation, offering entire:
 : societies the chance to reveal aspects of their characters they could not  :
 : normally afford to indulge. Icelanders wanted to stop fishing and become   :
 : investment bankers. The Greeks wanted to turn their country into a piata   :
 : stuffed with cash and allow as many citizens as possible to take a whack.  :
 : The Irish wanted to stop being Irish. The Germans wanted to be even more   :
 : German. Michael Lewis's investigation of bubbles across Europe is          :
 : brilliantly, sadly hilarious. He also turns a merciless eye on America: on :
 : California, the epicentre of world consumption, where we see that a final  :
 : reckoning awaits the most avaricious of nations too. This is the ultimate  :
 : book of our times. It's time to brace ourselves for impact. And, with      :
 : Michael Lewis, to laugh out loud while we're doing it.                     :
