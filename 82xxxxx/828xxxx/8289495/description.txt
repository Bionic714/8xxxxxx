 : n the early 1950s, an eleven-year-old boy boards a huge liner bound for    :
 : England -- a 'castle that was to cross the sea'. At mealtimes, he is placed:
 : at the lowly 'Cat's Table' with an eccentric group of grown-ups and two    :
 : other boys, Cassius and Ramadhin. As the ship makes its way across the     :
 : Indian Ocean, through the Suez Canal, into the Mediterranean, the boys     :
 : become involved in the worlds and stories of the adults around them,       :
 : tumbling from one adventure and delicious discovery to another, 'bursting  :
 : all over the place like freed mercury'. And at night, the boys spy on a    :
 : shackled prisoner -- his crime and fate a galvanising mystery that will    :
 : haunt them forever.As the narrative moves between the decks and holds of   :
 : the ship and the boy's adult years, it tells a spellbinding story about the:
 : difference between the magical openness of childhood and the burdens of    :
 : earned understanding -- about a lifelong journey that began unexpectedly   :
 : with a spectacular sea voyage, when all on board were 'free of the         :
 : realities of the earth'.With the ocean liner a brilliant microcosm for the :
 : floating dream of childhood, The Cat's Table is a vivid, poignant and      :
 : thrilling book, full of Ondaatje's trademark set-pieces and breathtaking   :
 : images: a story told with a child's sense of wonder by a novelist at the   :
 : very height of his powers.                                                 :
