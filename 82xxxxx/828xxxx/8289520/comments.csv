OH man, I have waited for this moment for a long, long, long, long time. Finally can we see Natsu's epic fight in the Grad Magic Games. I am so excited. But it's really sad that this is the second last episode before the cancellation. But I believe this not the end of this great show. We all believe in Hio-sensei. :)"
