From Wikipedia:



Queen are a British rock band formed in London in 1970, originally consisting of Freddie Mercury (lead vocals, piano), Brian May (guitar, vocals), John Deacon (bass guitar), and Roger Taylor (drums, vocals). Queen's earliest works were influenced by progressive rock, hard rock and heavy metal, but the band gradually ventured into more conventional and radio-friendly works, incorporating more diverse and innovative styles in their music.

The second volume of QueenΓÇÖs Greatest Hits appeared a decade after the first; a decade after the group started its slow shift from international superstars toward ruling the world that existed outside of the United States. Apart from ΓÇ£Under PressureΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£Radio Ga Ga,ΓÇ¥ all of the 17 singles here did not crack the American Top 40, but theyΓÇÖre well-known throughout the world, particularly the operatic anthems ΓÇ£A Kind of Magic,ΓÇ¥ ΓÇ£I Want It All,ΓÇ¥ ΓÇ£I Want to Break Free,ΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£Who Wants to Live Forever.ΓÇ¥ Generally, the songs here favor melodrama to untrammeled rock & roll, which means while thereΓÇÖs nothing here that hits as hard as ΓÇ£Tie Your Mother DownΓÇ¥; thereΓÇÖs also nothing as light on its feet as ΓÇ£Crazy Little Thing Called Love,ΓÇ¥ either. This is not necessarily a bad thing: nobody scaled the dramatic heights like Queen, and this captures their pomp & circumstance at its most polished.
