,ACM90,2013-03-23T10:27Z,"why the file is that big, 1.5 gb?"
,dekzz,2013-03-23T10:42Z,Cause its HD ?
,imbolthead,2013-03-23T18:11Z,Burn in hell jasogale !
,imbolthead,2013-03-23T18:14Z,"Why the hell would you delete my comment about jasogale  and his BS spoiler alert and not delete his? This is not a discussion forum, so why allow someone to put something like that?"
,Pentumsmart,2013-03-23T19:54Z,"@jasogale

FUCK YOU FOR SPOILING. I hope something bad happens to you soon."
,Pentumsmart,2013-03-23T19:56Z,"@jasogale

FUCK YOU FOR SPOILING. 
I hope something bad happens to you soon."
,ReLoaDitt,2013-03-23T23:08Z,"Go fuck yourself Jasogale, piece of shit. Why put the spoiler alert below your spoiler, your a cunt. Hope your house burns down and you lose everything you own."
,ReLoaDitt,2013-03-23T23:10Z,"Yea and i agree, why delete someone elses comment about his gay spoiler. Your a homo for not deleting his spoiler and deleting someone else's that just criticizes him for doing such a thing."
,jalucian,2013-03-24T05:09Z,"The volume is low on this one. Had to boost to about 150% to get decent volume.

""why the file is that big, 1.5 gb?""
""Cause its HD ?""

No, the file size is overly large even for 720p resolution. This is caused by ""bitrate overkill."" It's this large so it will still look right on a huge screen, but for the vast majority of ppl downloading who watch on computer monitors or regular sized TVs, the bitrate and file size are about 3x what is needed, even at 720p. 

And yes, jasogale's comment should absolutely be deleted."
,jalucian,2013-03-24T05:12Z,"For the record though, the uploader cannot delete comments. Only PB moderators/staff can do that. I got the impression that people seemed to think the uploader deleted the missing comment."
,jmindset,2013-03-24T18:04Z,"@everyone, its obvious that crixus will die soon anyways. in the last episode something told me that crixus will die soon. btw we all already know that all of the gladiators and ex slaves die anyways..no need to get mad over it lol"
,idreezy1,2013-03-25T14:51Z,"First off, fuck you jasogale! But really, we knew it was gonna happen right? If you know a shred of history about Rome, you know that the revolt is unsuccessful, and this is even before Caesar came to power."
,kakarot42,2013-04-18T14:22Z,"@jmindset & idreezy1 yes this is true we all no what history has told us. But what history didnt say is that in season3 episode8 the great Crixus dies..

and just for the record 

jasogale you sir are an asshole"
