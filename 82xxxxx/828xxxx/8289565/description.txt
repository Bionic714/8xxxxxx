Recalling the fuzzed out sounds of the Dandy Warhols and the psychedelia of Brian Jonestown Massacre fused with the soaring vocals of Richard Ashcroft, there is something much more life-affirming about the Stevenson Ranch Davidians than the aforementioned counterparts. Concocted around the notion of a cult, itΓÇÖs easy to see people being converted to the dreamy, blissful melodies on the bandΓÇÖs debut album, Psalms, Hymns and Spiritual Songs. There is no denying the religious yet nondenominational undertones to these songs, heavy in the wisdom of living for today and loving your fellow man. WeΓÇÖre not talking about God; weΓÇÖre talking about spiritualism. What struck me most about the songs is that sense of optimism. Though many bands of the neo-psychedelic movement embody the same sounds, their lyrics are much bleaker and donΓÇÖt offer the hope that is deeply embedded in the songs of the Davidians.
