Limbs and Branches is a compilation release from singer/songwriter Jon Foreman that was released October 28, 2008. It consists of a selection of songs from Foreman's previous solo EP releases, handpicked by Foreman and his fans, who were given a chance to vote for which songs to be included. Foreman also recorded two new songs for the release. "It's for all the folks that have a hard time understanding EP's and want things in a more universal format," explained Foreman.
It has peaked so far at No. 48 on the iTunes overall albums chart.
