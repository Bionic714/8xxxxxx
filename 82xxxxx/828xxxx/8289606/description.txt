Soon after the release of his seventh studio album, 2006's Subtitulo, indie singer/songwriter Josh Rouse teamed up with Spanish vocalist Paz Suay to form the aptly named duo She's Spanish, I'm American. Working out of an apartment in Valencia, Spain, the two recorded a self-titled five-song EP that nodded to the retro-loungy puffiness of Black Moth Super Rainbow, the rainbow-tinted ambience of the Flaming Lips, and the ethereal synthiness of groups like Galaxie 500 and Stereolab. The disc was released on the Bedroom Classics label in 2007.
