The files are one mp3 per set. There are a few points where the locals seem a little touch chatty with introductions, but it seems to be partly recorded off a local radio station.

The Swedish House Mafia set sounds like it was recorded on a phone that was left in someone's pocket. I have added a few versions (maybe someone can clean it up) but please given that these are the last sets that SHM will be playing, if a full set surfaces, PLEASE do link it in the comments.
