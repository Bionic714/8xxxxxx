,bioshock_infinite,2013-03-23T07:23Z,"And this one's to @DonnieHill618, http://bayimg.com/kaKIMaaEo

Yes. It's Bioshock Infinite."
[V],wushdishmeen,2013-03-23T08:05Z,"Apologies we've had way too many scammers taking advantage and the .7z file and the fact that you're not a trusted or VIP screams scam.

Anyone can fake a picture though.  But I've found this on my trusted private tracker so yes it's real folks.

JTAG only though...where is the regular version???  Not far behind I hope."
,violet1143,2013-03-23T08:07Z,"Any word as to whether the PC version will be rlsed too, or will it be a zeroday?"
[V],wushdishmeen,2013-03-23T08:33Z,"This game has been on heavy lock down.   They wouldn't even let the story leak let alone the game itself.  Even Microsoft titles like Halo and GOW leaked a month before release.  

Rightfully so,  IGN already gave this game a 9.4 and it could be a big contender for Game of the Year.

So with that I would say the 360 ISO version will be posted sometime tomorrow and we won't see a PC version until release day, if not days after release.

Might I suggest actually buying the PC version?  I usually grab the 360 version to test it out and if I like it I buy the legit PC version.  Ken Levine put his heart & soul into this game and he deserves the money.  Support the developers if you want to see more games like this!!"
,copyofnight,2013-03-23T08:36Z,I don't believe its a fake... it's on our private tracker too seems  proper version ... so feel free to geit it...

,DJ_SEVEN,2013-03-23T08:44Z,"Just a question of time, a day, hrs or minutes, and both Ifinite and army of two will show up, not everyday to great games get to be releleased on the same day ;D"
,sergio93,2013-03-23T08:56Z,"Probably it's not a fake, I have seen a JTAG version on a private tracker."
,redbullzvodkouu,2013-03-23T09:23Z,it is also Pal version?
[V],wushdishmeen,2013-03-23T10:00Z,"This is legit PAL JTAG version.  The legit 360 ISO version is also posted.  It's the one by COMPLEX.

The ""RELOADED"" PC version is a total fake.  PC version isn't released yet."
,DonnieHill618,2013-03-23T15:27Z,My bad brother. someone said it was fake and I saw  6gb and thought it was huge for a scammer
