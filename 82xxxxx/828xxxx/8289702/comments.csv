,mateo999,2013-03-23T08:23Z,"Why does this always download so slow for me? There are 238 seeds and 1,121 leechers, and it's downloading at 5 kb/s! wtf?? Thanks for the upload, but do you know what is up?"

@mateo999 
When there's a lot more leechers than seeders your download maybe slower. I don't know how it is with other clients, but I think uTorrent is trying to balance newly uploaded data to evenly propagate it among all announcing readiness to download it (through torrent clients). In situation like that my upload is always at least 3 times higher than my download.
If You want to download it quickly, stop downloading and get back to it after an hour or two. Than seeders/leechers proportion should better."
