,appropriateresponse69,2013-03-23T16:03Z,"footy, just registered on PB for the sole purpose of thanking you!!!! I've only been able to watch the only sport I follow, namely F1, for the last 2 years, thanks to you and your excellent and timely uploads!!!
I sincerely cannot thank you enough!!!!!!!
Keep it up!"
,Thanosb18c,2013-03-23T16:26Z,footy qualifying ended and you havent uploaded F3 and qualify as well what is taking you so long mate? 
,rediffpiratebay4ever,2013-03-23T17:02Z,does anyone know if footy has a twitter account
,SerSpec-V,2013-03-23T18:33Z,Other people have already posted P3 & Quail on TPB.
,reiberkuchen,2013-03-23T23:07Z,Yes they have been uploaded by others; but Footy's are the best. The others today either don't have any intro to them or are five times too big file size. Still loyally waiting for Footy! :)
,SerSpec-V,2013-03-23T23:24Z,^But quality is even better since Footy only does AVI now.
