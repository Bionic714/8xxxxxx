Ghost Recon puts the player in charge of a fictional squad of U.S. Special 
Forces operators from Company D, 1st Battalion, 5th Special Forces Group (5th 
SFG) stationed at Fort Bragg, NC. Except for the "1st Battalion, 5th SFG" 
designation, this unit is entirely fictional. They are sometimes referred to as 
"The Ghosts". Their role is not unlike other real world Special Operations 
Forces, in that their operations are kept highly classified.

The Ghosts are organized into three fireteams named using the NATO phonetic 
alphabet: Alpha, Bravo, and Charlie allowing for a distribution of three 
soldiers per team. However, since the player can only assign a total of six men in 
a single player mission, it is not uncommon for one of the fireteams to be 
disregarded, depending on the preference of the player. The player enjoys 
limited tactical control on the battlefield environment, and can issue maneuver 
commands as well as rules of engagement for each of the fireteams through a 
command map.
