[V],psspss,2013-03-24T07:09Z,so few never comment or thank makes you wonder if its worth sharing on public trackers now days

Ps.  I logged in just to thank you, but tried to post this thanks 3 times in internet explorer, and the damn submit button would do nothing - so I had to log in via firefox - hopefully this time works!"
,romacular,2013-03-24T21:07Z,wow! 5 minutes later it shows up... :/
[V],psspss,2013-03-25T00:02Z,"yeh comments can show up varied speeds.. if it makes it through their spam filter which is silly cos vips shouldnt be blocked on own torrent comments

i guess it takes time for it to move across the CLOUD? or Temp DB to the main search DB"
[V],psspss,2013-03-25T00:05Z,"so 1 comment per 1000 downloads LOL great

normal response like I got on Kat for bondi vet was I shouldnt moan about leechers and hit and runs and share cos I wanted too?  yeh right.. if they want missing content they need to play fair and also give feed back how much they want it.. espc since only 10 seed it once got it so few follow the series"

,snowdog1,2013-03-27T04:39Z,"Worx fine. Many thanx for your continued efforts psspss, very appreciated..."
,libertaswv,2013-03-30T01:30Z,"Thx for all the ups, psspss - sincerely appreciated. Thx too to all seeders!

Some good content in this show, but a lot of the gun/hunting practices displayed by these people are truly pathetic. They brag about being mighty hunters, but don't know how to hunt...carry their guns... care for their guns... which guns to use for what... much of it is a primer on exactly what NOT to do in the Yukon (or anywhere). Still like it okay... but some of these guys have a lot to learn

Anyway... Will seed to 20 or more - thx again, p"
