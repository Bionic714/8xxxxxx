But...

FLAC...???

Why convert to FLAC?  My OPPO Blu-ray player will not recognize this.  Why not use other MUCH more common Audio formats...?

Thanks though!"

,TheLathe,2013-03-24T07:19Z,"Oh, yeah, I guess that makes sense.  I have a 2 TB drive full of FLAC Audio albums.  I suppose that I should be able to convert back to PCM or something that my player will recognize.

NICE film and excellent choice though!

Thanks!!!"

I am having a HELL of a time trying to convert / play this FLAC soundtrack on my OPPO Blu-ray player.

PLEASE, can you give me ANY suggestions at all how to extract the FLAC audio channel and convert is to AC3, ANYTHING that I can then remux to MKV and burn to a disc to play?

Thank you!  THis is driving me frigg'n INSANE! 

I've downloaded and burned HUNDREDS of films here, but your FLAC file I think is gonna be the absolute death of me!  : )"
