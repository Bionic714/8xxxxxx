,timothytt,2013-03-24T09:00Z,Movie rating? Not IMDB but just your opinions?
,ashsama,2013-03-24T14:51Z,"Poor CGI, and PC keyboards seem to be their main props, actors aren't that good either though I've seen alot worse...  feels like a fan movie :)"
,vampzcore,2013-03-24T18:29Z,thanks!!
,charley0,2013-03-24T18:35Z,"Excellent quality, thanks *s"
,DrMD,2013-03-25T16:19Z,"Horrible movie, acting and actors, this is the kind of POS that is usually on SyFy. You can't tell in space what the fuck is going on, who's who or even where the fuck they are in relation to the guys they're fighting, It's a total cluster fuck. It does have decent CGI but that's all it's got. I stopped watching and deleted within a half hour. A/V=8 M=2, hmm, too generous! In space you can hear yourself scream at this movie."
,whnstn,2013-03-26T02:27Z,I'm too afraid to watch it after lousy reviews. Absolutely nothing redeeming about it.  More fun to have missed one and wonder. I enjoyed Ashsama's comment about keyboards!
,dlarrym1111,2013-03-31T07:54Z,"Review-PART (1):
In addition to the matt grey painted, generic PC keyboards, (also, note that the ""Enemy"" (I think) pilot is wearing welding goggles and a respirator, that is all painted black. A respirator with the 2 rectangular (more trapezoid shaped) filters on each side, normally used for use in a spray booth at an auto body shop. There is even one ""prop"" that looks like a 19080's era GIANT desktop printing type of calculator with the printer roll removed. I totally agree with most of these commits nut I feel the CGI is pretty much (circa) 1999 ""QUAKE"" ""first person shooter"" type graphics. To be fair it's some what better then that, but not by much.

,dlarrym1111,2013-03-31T07:57Z,"Review PART (2): -would not take comment until I split it in 2-
I didn't make it past 40 mins. or so either. Although Only the one actor, his character was named ""JACKEL"", was SUPER HORRIBLE, almost on purpose. It has a ""Toxic Avenger"" sort of thing going on, but this movie isn't portrayed as a comedy. FYI: 
Trey Parker (writer/co-creator of South Park, was involved with the Toxic Avenger. . .If you like South Park, check this movie out - The Toxic Avenger, not SCAVENGERS)
ANYWAY. . .

View at your own risk, Time cannot be replaced, once you use it it is NOT retrievable.
A decent low budget SCI-FI movie is TIME CRIMES. Check it out. For unknown reasons, it is no longer found as easy as it was when it came out which was in 09'.
Good luck. Lastly, I will concede this, me and my brother when we were in High-school made some SUPER low budget movies, so I get the interest to make one, but this could have been done WAY better. LOOK up the cost on IMDB and you will see what I mean. CLERKS I by Kevin Smith had a much lower budget, he paid for most of it on a VISA card with a 50k limit.!!!! This is why it is in Black and White.
ANYWAY, 
However, the upload quality is very good A-10/V-10
PEACE
FIN!! :~)"

Possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. "
