,hellraiser14,2013-03-26T18:05Z,Also confirming that the video loses audio at the 1hr  50min mark. Confirmed via using VLC.
,CaptPeacock,2013-04-19T10:28Z,"Still no word on when, or if, corrected versions will be out."
,marked141,2013-04-21T20:21Z,"I also noticed the loss of audio after the 1hr 50min mark.

I also notice this on several other movies posted by YIFY but it is usually in the credits. Is there some way to contact YIFY directly about this problem or are we limited to hoping our comments are seen? (yeah, I'm a bit of a noob still)"
,CaptPeacock,2013-06-02T09:36Z,Still no fix for this or any others of the series...
