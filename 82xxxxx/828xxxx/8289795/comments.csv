,breakersailer,2013-03-24T23:20Z,Don't download this we have not completed season 2 yet and he has season 3? 
,jgilles97,2013-03-25T02:41Z,"@breakersailer uh.. we're on episode 15 of season 3... he has up to episode 14 of season 3.
Very good torrent."
,Chibimoonbunny,2013-03-26T04:20Z,"@ breakersailer Yea, do you even watch the show? Simple question. Easier to tell someone they are wrong if you actually watch the show you are referring to."
,rgregb,2013-03-26T05:16Z,Trying to upload a full series has me stumped... I'd appreciate any helpful advice you'd be willing to share... thanks

,obe1123,2013-03-27T12:31Z,hi could some one tell me how to upload full series
,derbuzz,2013-03-27T16:16Z,"@obe1123
I see you have uploaded single episodes of the walking dead. Well its not that hard to upload full seasons. If you download the full season episode by episode or you have the season disc its pretty much the same. Once you have collected the full season save all episodes into a single folder example ""The Walking Dead Season 3"" use a program like winrar or winzip to compress the files. Then create a torrent like you would any other when the compression is done. Then upload like you would any other torrent but with a full season you need to seed longer so people don't get stuck on a % while downloading a bigger file."
,derbuzz,2013-03-27T16:18Z,still stuck at 83% I looked at the peers tab in bittorrent and NO ONE  has more that 83.0% so this might be a wast of time.
,teddy619,2013-04-01T08:57Z,83.5% seed!!!! hurry!! or am I the only one left alive and the zombies have gotten you!!???
,teddy619,2013-04-01T10:38Z,"maybe shmnz7 is waiting to upload E15 and 16, final episodes to complete season 3 ;) be patient if you think about it...   "
,bigwigg,2013-04-01T11:30Z,"Thank you very much, shmnz7"
