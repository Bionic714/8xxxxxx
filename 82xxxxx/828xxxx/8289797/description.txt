The Battle of the Alamo ranks right up there as one of the most famous last-stand battles ever. But, while much has been recorded about the human drama that unfolded at the former mission back in 1836, little is known about the key role technology played in the fatal standoff.

In this eye-opening program, HISTORYTM goes beyond canons, Bowie knives, and Kentucky rifles to reveal how the relentless Mexican army used unconventional tactics such as music, uniforms, and other psychological devices to take the Alamo s band of defenders off their guard. Forensic evidence and archival material help highlight the Texans battle preparations, while experts detail how the fort once the Texans refuge quickly turned into a deathtrap.

Featuring surviving examples of the weapons and devices used in the siege, as well as detailed computer re-enactments, ALAMO TECH offers a fresh perspective on this historic battle.
