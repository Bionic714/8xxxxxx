,Kanegasi,2013-03-23T21:38Z,"The last 15 minutes are corrupted. No player I use can access or play past 1:30:35. I watched the movie on VLC up to this point. I've tried MPC and the usual mainstream players, but nothing can get to these last few minutes.

Normally, I post informatively, but the moment this cut off in the scene it was on got me fucking pissed. There's no way anyone could not be pissed being cut off in the middle of a climax.

You've been fucking up the last few weeks, YIFY. There's a small handful of releases with little things no one would miss if they watched the movie, like two WHOLE HOURS of absolutely nothing at the end of your Anchorman release. How the fuck does someone miss releasing an hour and a half movie that's somehow THREE AND A HALF HOURS LONG?! You've been one of the greatest sources for ages. Stop being complacent with your shit and get a better QA. Speed is not important. You have loyal fans. Don't bother with beating other scene releases. Quality is important."
,suluone,2013-03-24T03:53Z,@ kanegasi who the FUCK you think you are? GO AND FUCK YOU MOM YOU MOTHERFUCKER. FUCK YOU...... you dont fucking have anything close to extremezone not even fucking close. DROP DEAD BITCH
,atndigcrk,2013-03-24T06:46Z,"why do people doubt yify 
look at his track record lol "
,mezro,2013-03-24T10:43Z,"Kanegasi is on point: these flawed releases are becoming commonplace.

As for 'the scene', there used to be shame in mistakes, and apologies soon followed with PROPER rips that would phase out the NUKED.
How do you convince a 1000+ swarm in torrent-land to stop seeding?
You don't.

If this process involved cracking code I might understand, but YIFY is uploading this without even skimming through it? Where is the quality control? I mean, it takes less than a minute to fastforward through the whole movie in VLC. Is that too long to spare?"
,Kanegasi,2013-03-24T16:25Z,"@suluone

Lol.

@atndigcrk

I definitely do not doubt YIFY. As I mentioned in my post, they are one of the greatest, but they have been messing up lately.

@mezro

Thanks for getting it."
,saturns131,2013-03-25T05:47Z,"nice movie YIFY, can you upload Java Heat???"
,dptx,2013-03-28T16:50Z,"^^^^Kanegasi is 100% correct about this file being a bad upload.  

I've dowloaded this film three different times, onto three different computers, direct from YIFY's actual website, and all three copies have been unable to play beyond the 1:30:35 mark.  

I've tried each copy with 5 different players (all up-to-date) and the film just freezes, at the exact same point, with every player.

I even tried to convert the file it to an mkv file with MkvMerge and the conversion process also stops dead at the 1:30:35 mark.

Only ever had one other YIFY download with a problem and that was corrected, with a re-issue, pretty quickly."
,asylum26,2013-04-06T21:59Z,File is broken -.- FFS -.-
,slasherman,2013-04-07T15:50Z,"file is broken at the end of the movie, download another"
,danthehat,2013-05-02T07:33Z,"Hi.

You're a fucking nigger.

That is all."
,mikedongs,2013-05-06T04:38Z,"awesome. the last 15 minutes are completely corrupted. this is the first time i've ever had a problem with a YIFY release. YIFY, if i were you i would delete this torrent entry from TPB so it doesn't hurt your reputation."
,Beetlejuicexx,2013-05-27T00:45Z,"I can definitely agree - YIFY torrents are great, if only for the 2.1 sound not 5.1, but anyway, the last 15 minutes of this is definitely correupt and stops in every O/S and player i can think of.. have tried multiple times with multiple combinations."
,Beetlejuicexx,2013-05-27T10:26Z,"Update - when i downloaded this version (also 1080p) and played it, it worked fine on all 3 O/S's that i have as well as all 4 media players.
