Jolly comedy about a Spanish priest who journeys through 20th century Spain accompanied by the (communist) village mayor. Much witty dialogue.

Ripped from tape from TV... rotten quality, I hope someone posts a better copy.

In segmented mpg format - plays on VLC, but you might have trouble burning it.
