,thejester39,2013-03-23T08:28Z,"For the record my upload speed is not the best, so at first it may take a bit to download. But as long as you guys are being cool about it, and helping to seed, at least at first, download speeds will increase. So I ask you to kindly seed once you've download. Even if just for a day or two. Thanks! "
,thejester39,2013-03-23T08:34Z,"In the note about the HD Res pack, I meant to say ""So dont use it if you have an older graphics card"". Sorry about that!"
,thejester39,2013-03-23T08:36Z,"Also, download speed might be slower from me, because I am currently downloading The Hobbit! So excited. lol It's almost done though, so dont fret!"
,18urbon18,2013-03-24T15:39Z,"This is kind of unfair, I've already seeded 40GB, and I'm still not halfway the download..."
,CRLights,2013-03-25T00:04Z,"i've tried downloading this before, but the steps start getting confusing. where should i put my DLC's?"
,iforgot11,2013-03-25T18:55Z,"I logged in just to be able to comment. And I wanted to personally and sincerely say thank you for this AMAZING torrent Jester. 

You made this so simple for everyone and even though I may not know you personally, I would totally bro fist you and buy a beer.

No homo. Unless you're into that. loljk.

But seriously thanks."
,iforgot11,2013-03-25T18:59Z,"By the way, this should work with Update 13 correct?

And also, how would one go about installing SKSE for mods? Does it need to be cracked or something.
"
,thejester39,2013-03-25T19:05Z,"Hey sorry guys, I told you my upload speed SUCKS. My last torrent started out slow, but it got rolling eventually. As will this one! Patience!

CRLights, anyone who responds to you will only say exactly what is in the instructions which is: Place the Dawnguard.bsa and Dawnguard.esm files into the Data folder of your Skyrim installation directory. 

That directory, assuming you installed with this torrent, should be C:Program Files (x86)The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim.  I cant see how that could be confusing for you, but I hope this helps."
,thejester39,2013-03-25T19:08Z,"iforgot11   lol Thanks, I appreciate that!! I was hoping this made it easier for everyone to enjoy Skyrim. It truly is one of the best games ever!! 

To answer your questions, this should work with ANY of the updates. Just make sure to use their crack for it.

As for SKSE, it's simple. You just download it, and place it in your C:Program Files (x86)The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim folder. Start Skyrim using the loader. As long as you cracked the Skyrim.exe (or SkyrimLauncher.exe) SKSE will start with no problems. No need to crack it.

Enjoy!"
,iforgot11,2013-03-25T19:36Z,"I'm downloading at a cozy 2.3MB/s so no problems on my end. I have a 5MB Up speed so as soon as this is done I'll seed this for the month.

And thanks for the info Joker."
,iforgot11,2013-03-26T01:35Z,"Just wanted to say that I finished downloading this about an hour ago and I've been playing it clean through with totally NO problems.

Thanks again. Will be seeding forever."
,CRLights,2013-03-26T04:53Z,"I put everything where it should go, but the game is slow and choppy for some reason. i have no idea why this is, i've tried everything and i'm now so very lost"
,trekkie927,2013-03-27T16:42Z,"I have tried installing this multiple times and each time it has stopped 3/4 of the way through when trying to install ""atimgpud.dll"" A pop-up says ""I cannot create this file"" (or something similar). 
Anyone know what I'm doing wrong or a work around for this?"
,theprophecyx3,2013-03-28T16:05Z,does this fixes the display cases bug?
,daniellovespcgames666,2013-03-29T06:25Z,download speed is a little slow but ive downloaded before but lost all data and let me tell u download this one!!! Not the other ones!!!! Pick this one!!!! Thejester39 You Rock!!! keep up the good work!!!
,thejester39,2013-03-31T19:43Z,"CRLights - A choppy game is most likely a hardware issue. Are you sure your computer is capable of running Skyrim? It could also be caused by a mod if you are using any of them. It is most likely one of those two reasons.

trekkie927 -  I am not sure what that could be about, as it has never happened to me, nor has anyone else ever mentioned. Make sure read the instructions thoroughly. Sorry I cant be more help on that.

theprophecyx3 - It is possible it does, but I am not familiar with that issues, so I can't say for certain if it does. I do know they released Patch 12 & 13 which fix many bugs. But I cant say for certain if any of it fixes that bug, as I've never had it.

daniellovespcgames666 - Thanks very much for the compliments!! I'm still seeding by my speed is slow. Eventually it will get rolling I am sure. 

Enjoy!"

,sgdevilzz,2013-04-07T22:15Z,"I'm getting the ""unable to start correctly (0xc0000022) error when starting the game. I've installed all DLCs and HD textures pack. used Update 13 from reloaded and their crack. Still gets the error message. Any help?"

,hadar96,2013-04-09T21:34Z,when i tried to launch it after i install it it opened the game page in steam. what to do?
,chuyxxx,2013-05-08T23:33Z,I'm having the same problem as hadar96 any help would be greatly appreciated.
,chuyxxx,2013-05-08T23:37Z,"I'm having the same problem as hadar96, any help in resolving this matter would be greatly appreciated."
,Rispetto,2013-05-14T04:33Z,"If the installer is having problems adding files or giving you errors, it means it's not running in administration mode and is not allowed to install files. Either run as administrator or install to a place where rights are not required (I.E your desktop).

If Steam opens when you've launched the game it means you havn't run the crack properly. Please follow each step carefully, and either install an update here from Piratebay (which contains the crack) or get a Skyrim crack separately.

Hope that helps."
