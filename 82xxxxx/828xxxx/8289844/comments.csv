,bixit_,2013-03-23T18:58Z,"I would recommend watching in the machete order (http://static.nomachetejuggling.com/machete_order.html)

that would be IV-V-II-III-VI (and drop I) "
,seevee1969,2013-03-23T19:48Z,Han shot first
,erraticchevy,2013-03-24T01:01Z,"who gives a shit if han shot first fuck off! i shot my load first on your mom, then on your girl."
,erraticchevy,2013-03-24T01:10Z,"don't watch the machete order that's the stupidest thing ive ever heard of watching them out of order its completely stupid and confusing to someone whose never seen them before, i can see it maybe working for a board die hard fan who has worn out the VHS DVDs and working on the blurays maybe this will work for that 15% but the other 85% watch it in order "
,MrAlice,2013-03-24T02:23Z,"best viewing order:

A New Hope IV,
The Empire Strikes back V,
Everything Star Wars (1,2,3, clone wars series, games and so on) all you can find.
Then when you seen it all you can watch VI Return of the Jedi.

Ps. Han shot first, and it matters."
