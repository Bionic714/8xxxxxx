,rebuild,2013-04-18T15:14Z,Great job.  Question though it only activates the 32 bit program and the 64 bit still stays a trial.  No biggie until I installed Windows 8 which the compatibility checker from MS says Bluebeam  11 is compatible with windows 8.  After upgrade to Win 8  the 32 bit version crashes and the 64 bit version runs fine but still as the trial.  I have uninstalled reinstalled even tried on another machine.  Any ideas?  As I typed I installed the version 11.0.0  engine 11.0.4821.16074 from their site and now the 32 and 64 are working in trial mode.  The patch runs but doesn't register it.  Any ideas?
