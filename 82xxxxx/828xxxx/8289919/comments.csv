I don't want to step on any toes but I checked out the upload of dead man down by pialovar on this site is in Italian audio but the cam is almost DVD quality, if I knew how to do it I would borrow the cam video from him and put your English audio over the Italian and you would have the best copy out there, of course giving credit where it's due but just a thought take it or leave it but I think its a great idea. Check it out if your curious. Thanks again."

,dest4mex,2013-04-25T16:37Z,"sorry peeps, this cam bites big time. the guy can´t sop fiddling with his camera for any longer than a few minutes, constantly moving it, really sucks out of focus almost every scene change. the seats in front of the guy are blocking the movie, it´s a poor angle, cropped it self out due to the poor seating position, 

audio - 7 (too bad, it was good audio)
video - 1.5 (maybe!)
movie - who the hell knows, couldn´t follow the flick with all the distracting shit going on. 
thanks anyways uploader, appreciate your effort. 
pass on this one, it´s a waste of time. "
