Port Blue is an Ambient/Experimental project created by Adam Young of Owl City. 

Arctic was unofficially released on Myspace in 2006.

The Airship, a concept album, was released September 17, 2007. 
This review contains some really interesting information.

The follow-up Albatross EP was released in 2008.

The Pacific EP is a collection of songs that Adam produced in 2004/2005.
After a long wait, he finally completed and mastered the tracks, and 
released the EP on Soundcloud on March 8, 2013.

This folder also contains a collection of unreleased material, pre-production 
versions of The Airship and The Albatross, an early demo of The Pacific EP 
(contains previews of songs not on the final ep), and four demos that were 
leaked, and that are expected to be on the How I Became a Sky Sailor album, 
due this year (2013) probably. The Pacific EP demo contains two previews of 
On Marlin Isle, so...no I don't have the full song.

Thanks for downloading! I hope you enjoy this collection.
