However,  I desperately need the PC version because all of the textures in the 360 version are compressed in order to render the giant city and still there are frame rate drops here and there.

The PC version is going to blow this version away.  This is one of those games where the PC will really shine and there will be a huge difference in comparison videos."

,Sdarts,2013-03-23T23:36Z,"Guys (and gals), sorry to post a noob question, but Google hasn't really answered a question I have (at least not one I'm happy with), have searched for over 2 days now.

I borrowed a Xbox 360 for approximately 1 month and it is only modded with LT+ 3.0, no JTAG or RGH.
I have already learned how to pass ISO images to the Xbox 360's HD through the PC, my only problem is that it asks for the disc, even if it isn't original, it still needs the ""clone"" disc to boot the games.
Most people say it isn't possible without a modchip (hardware modification), which I can't do as the Xbox 360 isn't mine and it's like U$ 100 to do it.
I really find it hard that in this day and age, March of 2013, no one made a software that you could burn to a DVD and authenticate any and every game's boot or even through the use of a pen drive.
Even the swapping of discs gets annoying.

So my question is: Is there no other way of playing games from the Xbox 360's HD without a hardware modification? And if there is, how?

PS: I posted here in one of the most popular torrents of the year, because if anyone knows, its your guys."
,TNAThane,2013-03-23T23:47Z,lol @ seeder to leacher ratio. very very saddening. 
,GotLongboard,2013-03-24T02:36Z,"@SDarts

The reason you can't do what you're trying to do with a flashed drive is that the modification only applies to the drive, nothing else.  To play from your HD, you need to be able to run unsigned code which requires the Xbox to be exploited.  Or in other words JTAG/RGH.  It certainly wouldn't cost 100 bucks though, maybe half or less than half of that price.

@Nox

My comment was directed towards people who just randomly search TPB, see a game, DL it and try to play it on their stock Xbox.  That just wastes seeding power.

But if you need help with XGD3 disks, look up a few of these terms.

IHAS Drive
Burn Truncated XGD3 with ImgBurn Guide

You should find plenty of info floating around."
,GotLongboard,2013-03-24T02:56Z,"@SDart

Provided that your Xbox is phat and is on an old dash kernel, you can JTAG it if you are comfortable with soldering.  It would be a free mod in that case.

The reason why there isn't an easier way to softmod the 360 with a usb like the Xbox1 and Wii is that Microsoft designed the 360 so that a lot of the security is written in very low level programming.  Meaning that the protection is basically hardcoded into the 360, whereas in the Wii, the protection is higher-level and software based, making it possible for softmods.  So essentially, the only way to bypass hardcoded security is with a hardmod."
,iEMBARRASSu,2013-03-24T03:50Z,Sorry if this is a stupid question but i need help because i have already wasted 4 dvd+r dl discs and i can play the game a little but after about 15minutes i get an authentication error message i have gotten many other COMPLEX games and this one isnt working... do i need a jtag to play this game and if so how do i know from now on....... my xbox is flashed

[V],wushdishmeen,2013-03-24T06:28Z,"I always install every game to the HDD as the first thing I do before even playing it.  I'm about 6 hours or more into the game and have had no issues.

For those of you having issues try installing to hard drive.  If that doesn't help I would guess you're either using a crappy brand of DVD+R DL discs or you failed to run the games through ABGX and also verify the burned disc with both IMGBURN and ABGX after the burn.

Verbatim MKM003s are what you want... make sure they are made in Singapore.  Also check tutorials to find the best settings for your drive for burning XGD3.  Otherwise you'll end up with crappy quality burns.

Another thing is if you're someone who burns truncated discs rather than using the proper iHAS or Sony drive to overburn the full 8.7GB then you're basically making things much harder for yourself.

If you want games to work properly then burn them properly... or figure out how to do JTAG/RGH on your system."

,Smallz94,2013-03-24T20:13Z,"Heres my point of view. I tried the Mp3 Trick with usb method. Simple just put in songs in your flash drive and play the songs on your console then play the game. It was working for me until some kind of parade finished and when i was running across the bridge and it just stopped and gives an error saying to clean my disc and of course if you press ok, your console will restart. This got me so pissed of because games like this always end up with a error. I burned with Trucated method with no ihas burner. the previous games that i burned works fine except GEARS Judgment. I actually put the volume of the music all the way to listen to the game and it was going great until i crossed the bridge lol I NEED HELP! unless i will buy the game :///"

,phoeniks314,2013-03-24T20:51Z,"there is some talk on xiso of a solution,some people have confirmed it worked for them, here the quote:

I'm on LT2.0, and I got it running (no failed authorization messages).
You'll need Burner Max Tool (BMT). And 2 copies of the game : one truncated, the other burned with BMT.
Your drive must be compatible with the tool, though.
Here's a link that shows how to burn with BMT :
http://xboxpirate.eu/forums/topic/10...-payload-tool/
You just have to install the truncated one on your hard drive, and play with the one burned with BMT.
I've played for more than 30 min, and still no error messages.
I tested by ""doing nothing"" on the Title screen, the Start menu, the inventory screen and the vending machine screen for 1 min each, and every time it tries to verify the disc, but the error message doesn't show up.
One more thing : I said you needed 2 copies. But why not play directly with the BMT copy? 
Well, personaly, I can't. My Xbox doesn't recognize the disc. I had to install the other one before playing. Maybe some of you will have more luck than me.
Hope this helps."

I let you think about it, for now you can check him playing Hitman Absolution on yt.be/jokiratv"
,hardcorecouple69,2013-03-26T09:52Z,for some reason i cant extract this file it says corrupted on winrar and says file is broken on 7-zip. god i was looking forward to this game too. oh well i will just download another and hope for the best i guess
,hardcorecouple69,2013-03-26T10:02Z,i love my jtag i have it booting up into a freestyle dash 3.0.735 and its awesome it has all the game covers lined up and i have over 500 games loaded onto the internal and external hdd's and never have any issue burning games because i simply dont burn games . and with the system linki built into freestyle 3.0.735 you can play multiplayer with the other million people in the world that have a jtag system. i really dont know why people are on here whinging and bithing about jtag its heaps better than when i just had the firmware flashed now i can load all the xbla games and dlc for games too its awesome.
,hardcorecouple69,2013-03-26T11:12Z,ok i finally got the file to extract without getting an error- usually i would just extract from the r.00 file  but i kept getting errors from winrar and 7 zip. so i tried extract from the .rar file using winrar but at 99% it said corrupted so i tried the .rar file using 7 zip and hoorah it extracted the file. and yes the game works fine on my jtag. sorry for earlier comment about extracting error

,scythe06,2013-03-26T19:02Z,Burned with burnermax payload on ihas C in safemode worked fine until about six hours in and started to get authorization error. MP3 trick fixed the error. Hats off to you noobish.
,grekpektis,2013-03-26T19:51Z,The MP3 trick works for about 10 minutes but then it crashes and I keep having to do it over and over again.
,demeo1010,2013-03-26T19:56Z,Was gonna check it on abgx before playing but theres no file found yet (i guess because it came out today)... has anyone played a lot and can vouch that it passes stealth verification?
,Monstar79,2013-03-26T22:04Z,Works great and is ABGX verified now!!!
,5thel,2013-03-26T22:31Z,The verifier is now up on ABGX this thing is so corrupted ABGX couldn't make it through the entire process without locking up. Just got the other one from Ghostnet and patched with zero issues.
,slpls,2013-03-26T23:27Z,Do you guys still get authentication errors? or it works now that is verified on ABGX?
,Smallz94,2013-03-26T23:46Z,^ said it before  IT DOESNT WORK EVEN IF YOU VERIFIED IT WITH ABGX360. Just use the mp3 method trick and dont go on menus. Just keep playing. 
,slpls,2013-03-27T00:19Z,"@Smallz94

Well, it wasn't verified before on abgx database, that's why I'm asking, maybe now it gets properly patched.

The so called ""mp3 trick"" does fucking nothing, you said you got an error after the parade and you can't open menus, so that's exactly what is happening to me without playing any mp3.

I won't play the game like that, because it's pointless if the game crashes everytime a menu pops up.
"
,Smallz94,2013-03-27T01:07Z,Ok ^ alright if you get it to work just post it up and let us know if it works with abgx360 patched.

,cheeth86,2013-03-27T03:23Z,"quite frustrated with the game failing verification while using menus in the game. The Mp3 trick is a luck thing.. sometimes it works sometimes it does not.

,Smallz94,2013-03-27T05:10Z,"Ive been doing the mp3 trick and playing the game just fine. I am avoiding the menus so i just keep playing. and if i have to upgrade something like that then I will try to complete a objective first then hopefully i see that vending machine (upgrade) and do whatever and when the error comes, then I will play it where I just completed that objective. it is a goodthing for autosave :)  But yea I am still waiting for somebody to confirm that the reburn the game after they verify through abgx360"

Looks like burning truncated without payload, and overburn with payload, then installing with truncated, playing with the payload disk, AND using the mp3 trick works.

,Smallz94,2013-03-27T23:51Z,The only way to play this game is mp3 method trick. Install the game into your hard drive and then put in your usb that has songs it. Play it before you play the game and put the volume low so you can hear the game. For me thats the only way but if you want go ahead and buy the game.
,xxxxM0NSTERxxxx,2013-03-28T00:05Z,Wasted 2 discs don`t waste your time. They both did not play.

,neberekk,2013-03-30T18:47Z,"Just finished this awesome game! Burned it with ImgBurn with truncate method. Just try to stay out of menus and vending machines, if you have saving issues just correct date and time of the XBOX and you won't have problems. If you want to use vending machines do it after the game auto-saves because there's a big possibility that the games crashes (saying that failed verification), so you don't have to do the same thing 2 times or more and try to be quick just 1 or 2 seconds. Also when you load the game in the main menu, don't continue directly, just wait a bit (3-4 seconds) so the console starts reading the disk. One more thing, when you get the Vigors just type B several times so the tutorial doesn't pop up and also don't open the Vigor menu (LB) for too long, it will crash the game, just be quick at everything you do. If you have any problems just tell me.

@QuinnArtyKno on Twitter if you have any questions.

You can't burn XGD3 safe on Xbox Live without an iHas DVD Burner. 
You won't be able to burn to the edge of the disc so the entire iso won't be burned onto the dvd, and you can get banned. 

Burning XGD2 games is fine with a normal dual layer dvd burner, but not XGD3."

I have a Phat xbox with Lite-on drive (not quite sure which model) and i am using Verbatim DL media (mk001 i think)
Steps:
1- Donwloaded the Iso and ran it through Abgx360 (OBS: the CRC was already available at the time on Abgx server).
2- Burned with ImgBurn using the truncate method.
3- I was getting from time to time the ""Disk is unreadable"" and the ""Failed to authorize Disk"" errors.
4- I finally decided to buy the iHAS122-B flashed with Burnermax (I am Brazilian and this was the only compatible model I could find for sale on ""Mercado Livre"" --> It's like an South American Ebay).
5- I reburned the game with ImgBurn using the new drive.
6- Tried to play the game from the disk but for my absolute rage i was getting again and again ONLY the ""Disk is unreadable"" error.
7- SOLUTION!!! ----> Decided as my last try to install the second disk (the one that isn't the truncate one) on the HD and ever since i haven't gotten any errors at all (even with if i stay for long periods of time at vending machines or menus).

Hope it works for more people out there.

By the way....i had a silly queston while I was writing this.....On the context above which one is correct ""disc"" or ""disk""?"
