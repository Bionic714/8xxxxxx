This folder contains roughly every song Adam Young 
(and other kind people) has made available on the internet. 
They are all in AAC format with a VBR of 256 or 320 kbps,
and I have edited all of the info in iTunes so you should 
be able to just import the main folder into iTunes, and 
everything should be set to go. It may not be perfect, 
but I have labeled the year, artist, album, song title, 
genre, track number, and album art to the best of my 
knowledge. When finished downloading, please continue
to seed as much as is convenient.

I am a huge fan of Adam's work and have tried to stay as 
true to his original material as possible. 

You might notice that in the Sort Artist field, all of this music is tagged 
"Adam Young". This is just to keep track of what music is his (since he has 
music under so many different monikers). Sorry the file is so big, but seriously, 
this is everything.

Concerning the unreleased Owl City tracks, a lot of it is stuff
from his blog, but a ton of it also came from these awesome blogs.
