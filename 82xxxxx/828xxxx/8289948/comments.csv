Not meaning to complain, but I'm thinking that you likely got this from another rip where they only sampled the sound at such a low rate.  By your track record, I really doubt that you would extract it at such a low rate if you had a choice.

Sorry, just kinda weird...  If this one had a little better Audio I'd snag it.  

I DO appreciate the excellent choice though!

Cheers!"

[T],nomad_runner,2013-03-24T08:55Z,"TheLathe, I do sometimes post Blu-ray rips and they come from sources that are foreign, as I am abroad (but American) and am able to acquire such rare rips.  In most cases the rips I get are foreign language only and released here on  European TV, and I acquire dvd rips from other torrent sources and use their English audio track and mux them and give thanks when I can (sometimes working for hours to do this without them being oos) and also to make them as small as possible due to bandwidth issues, thus the discrepancies in quality, size, etc. I hope this helps your confusion. Bluray movies to be reduced in size have to take a hit either in quality or audio, I choose audio and I work hard to bring rare movies in HD and in English. If you have a problem with my movies, it's your choice not to download them, but given a majority have never been posted in HD, I hope I do a good enough job for most people. I'm glad you enjoy my posts and I like doing them because I love 80's and 90's movies more than any schlock made today, but please keep in mind the work it takes to bring them to fruition for all to enjoy.
