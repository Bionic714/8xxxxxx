,psilocybe87,2013-03-23T16:16Z,are these good english subs? 
,psilocybe87,2013-03-23T16:52Z,"just so everyone knows, these subtitles are totally fucked, almost every sentence has errors, even the title is wrong, god damit!"
,nginx,2013-03-23T19:18Z,"Quality is disappointing. Screenshots look good because they are in native resolution but the moment you blow it up on a 24"" 1080p monitor, artifacts are all over the place. I would hate to see how this looks on a bigger HDTV."

I translated the machine subtitles into English actually spoken by humans. The film makes sense now.
