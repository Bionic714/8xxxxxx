,Coltbear50,2013-03-23T17:54Z,Thanks!  This'll be great to hear 24-bit remastered!
,WasAtWoodstock,2013-03-24T00:14Z,"Thanks. This was one of the very few of hers that I did not have in lossless. The only non-compilation of hers that I have in MP3 is Go from 2003. A lossless of that would be nice.

If you have a scanner, 300 DPI artwork in jpegs is always appreciated.

I use Tag&Rename to manage the meta tags. I consider it the best out there for FLACs."
,Rialta1,2013-03-24T06:09Z,"I do not own a scanner.  Liner notes are always a good thing to have.  Maybe I could sneak using the one at work lol. 

I will try the software. "
,WasAtWoodstock,2013-03-24T14:10Z,"Like you, I used to use the one at work and e-mail home the scans. But I never did it for music.

After I discovered FLAC and Demonoid, I went out and bought a 4-in-1 laser-printer scanner copier fax. I gave my father my old laser-printer. Then I learned it was clipping the edges. All 4-in-1s do this because the copier mode wants to print the same size, but the printer can't print to the edge of the paper. So the scanner only scans what it can print.

Then I bought a real scanner to get around this. Then for other things I wanted an 11x17 scanner. I found an inexpensive 11x17 4-in-1 on Amazon and snapped it up. To handle the clipping of the edges I have plastic model I-beams I put along the edges."
