This series provides you with all of the information you will need to interview a customer (who might be your boss!), identify networking solutions that meet the needs discovered in the interview, and then design a network infrastructure that meets those needs! The current CCDA ensures the latest popular technologies are included, for example, wireless, VoIP, and data center architectures. As a byproduct of the skills learned, the student is completely ready to pass the 640-864 DESGN exam from Cisco Systems.

You'll proceed at your own pace, with trainer Anthony Sequeira as your guide. The videos in this series break down the CCDA certification process and required skills into bite-sized Nuggets. Video by video, you'll learn how to build upon an increasingly complex network design that can truly meet the needs of an organization.
