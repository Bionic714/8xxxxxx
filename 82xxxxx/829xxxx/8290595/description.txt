NOTES :

The original source of this recording was the "Robert Plant Experience". Many Thanks to all those who had already made a tremendous work creating this one.

This is most certainly one of Robert Plant's best night ever. The original lacked a little presence and definition, and Robert's voice was often drowned under the rest when it deserved to be loud and clear. In this version you can hear him in all his glory, hope you'll like it.
