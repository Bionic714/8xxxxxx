Won-gyu is a flight attendant and is constantly in transit. Anonymous hotel rooms are all the home he knows. Tae-jun is a motorbike courier who spends almost all his time on the streets. Two men with two jobs that keep them on the move. Two lives that are just a series of fleeting moments. Having clicked on the internet they arrange to meet in Seoul. But they only have a few hours. Won-gyu never wanted to return to the city because Seoul reminds him of an event that has left him sad and angry. His past casts a long shadow over their date, and their night together is pitch-black in spite of the big city lights. Since they must soon part again, both are afraid to get too close and a strange power game begins. Tae-jun joins his new friend as he sets out in search of something. They go to a place that was once the site of a brutal attack on gays.
