Lost Worlds: Series 1
Dig into the sands of time with this exploration into lost civilizations. Scientists, archaeologists, and historians alike search for evidence of cities that may have forever been lost to time. Some are ancient while some are surprisingly recent. Journey back to Jerusalem when Christ walked through its streets. Explore the mysteries of the Knights Templar. See Egypt when Ramses ruled and discover what it looked like in Braveheart's Scotland. Recent cities include Winston Churchill's secret bunkers and a Welthauptstadt Germania that Hitler envisioned. Graphic recreations and location shots bring these cities to life.



2)  Jesus Jerusalem 
Every year, tens of thousands of pilgrims travel to Jerusalem to trace Jesus' footsteps. But since his death, the city has been destroyed and rebuilt more than 20 times. So what did it look like when Jesus was alive? Lost Worlds draws on the expertise of a cadre of archaeologists, historians and computer graphics professionals to find out. They rebuild Herod's Temple Mount--in its time the world's largest man-made structure. They explain the manipulation of light and stone that let the Holy Sanctuary "sparkle like a snow-capped mountain in the sun." They explore the network of aqueducts, pipes, tunnels, and pools that kept this desert city from thirst and enabled it to handle an influx of pilgrims that routinely swelled its population from 30,000 to 300,000. They seek the places where Jesus performed miracles. And they map his final hours: including the real route of the "Via Dolorosa." Jesus' Jerusalem reveals a world hidden for more than 20 centuries.
