Pop-ups are three-dimensional cut-and-folded paper constructions that are widely used for children's books and greeting cards. They have a magical appeal as they mysteriously fold and unfold. Expanding on pop-up material covered in his earlier The Encyclopedia of Origami & Papercraft (LJ 3/1/92), Jackson offers an instructional guide leading the craftsperson through an introductory section of basics to sections covering techniques and original design. The step-by-step projects are exercises in technique only, with complex constructions shown as examples. Like the author's previous books, this one is notable for its clear instructions and bright, colorful illustrations. For users of all ages; highly recommended for public libraries.
