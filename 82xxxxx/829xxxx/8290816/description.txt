* Plot :

Jordan Turner (Halle Berry) is a 9-1-1 operator who receives a call from Leah Templeton (Evie Thompson), a teenage girl whose house is being attacked by a serial killer (Michael Eklund). Jordan's clever instructions allow Leah to evade the killer, but when the call disconnects, Jordan redials the number, alerting the killer. The mistake results in Leah's capture and she is found dead several days later.

Jordan confides to her boyfriend Officer Paul Phillips (Morris Chestnut) that the event has put her in a mental state where she can no longer field calls. Six months later, she is now a trainer for 911 operators. At this time, the same killer kidnaps another teenager Casey Welson (Abigail Breslin) from a mall parking lot and drives away with her in the trunk of his car. Brooke (Jenna Lamia), a rookie operator, receives the call and clearly cannot handle it; Jordan sees this and takes over. Because Casey is using a disposable phone, they cannot get an exact GPS location of her. Jordan guides Casey into signalling nearby cars who call 911, allowing the police to narrow their search. The killer kills several citizens who intervene, and switches cars with Alan Denado (Michael Imperioli), one of his victims, to elude the police. However, he inadvertently leaves fingerprints at the scene of the car switch, and the police are able to determine his identity, Michael Foster.
