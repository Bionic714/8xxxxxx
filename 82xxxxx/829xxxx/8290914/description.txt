ΓÇ£The bricks are fallen down, but we will build with hewn stones: the sycomores are cut down, but we will change them into cedars.ΓÇ¥

Devoted students of the Bible might recognize that verse from Isaiah 9:10, but it is hardly a widely discussed and broadly debated scripture. That may be about to change with the release of this new and highly anticipated book -- ΓÇ£The Harbinger: The Ancient Mystery That Holds the Secret of AmericaΓÇÖs Future.ΓÇ¥

Is it possible...

That there exists an ancient mystery that holds the secret of America s future?
That this mystery lies behind everything from 9/11 to the collapse of the global economy?
That ancient harbingers of judgment are now manifesting in America?
That God is sending America a prophetic message of what is yet to come?
Before its destruction as a nation, ancient Israel received nine harbingers, prophetic omens of warning. The same nine harbingers are now manifesting in America with immediate ramifications for end-time prophecy.

Hidden in an ancient biblical prophecy from Isaiah, the mysteries revealed in The Harbinger are so precise that they foretold recent American events down to the exact days. ItΓÇÖs all decoded by the author in convincing fashion. The revelations are so specific that even the most hardened skeptics will find it hard to dismiss or put down. It sounds like the plot of a Hollywood thriller with one exception ... ITΓÇÖS REAL.

The prophetic mysteries are revealed through an intriguing and engaging narrative the reader will find hard to put down. The Harbinger opens with the appearance of a man burdened with a message he has received from a mysterious figure called The Prophet. The Prophet has given him nine seals, each containing a message about America s future. As he tells of his encounters with The Prophet, from a skyscraper in New York City, to a rural mountaintop, to Capitol Hill, to Ground Zero, the mystery behind each seal is revealed. As the story unfolds, each revelation becomes a piece in a greater puzzle the ramifications of which will even alter the course of world history.
