,giffo5,2013-03-23T15:57Z,Thanks so much man ! 
,stuabroad,2013-03-23T16:32Z,"Appreciate the upload.  But understand that many of us using torrents to get the Qualy or Race do so because the country where we live has crap coverage.  For example anywhere in US or Canada. That's why we like to see smaller size torrents - so we don't have to avoid the news for three days while we wait on 5gb torrents downloading.  HD is fine, but actually watching the coverage in a timely fashion is more important.  If you can compress your files it would be *extremely* appreciated.

Cheers."

Anyway, my second FTTC line goes in this week so as of the the Qatar MotoGP torrents will initially seed from me at 2x their current rate..."
,stuabroad,2013-03-23T18:13Z,"@smcgill1969:  appreciate that buddy, but the laws of math say the smaller the file size, the less their is to download.  I've been sat now at between 0.9 and max of 160kb for the last hour.  Hopefully it'll improve so i can watch it! "
,smcgill1969,2013-03-23T18:50Z,"@stuabroad: That sucks, & I feel for you, but there are long term considerations that I can't go into here that have made me decide on the format..

Come on guys & girls, let's all help each other and open the taps a little bit for the likes of 'stuabroad'... :)"
,Jnxd1,2013-03-23T20:43Z,"@smcgill1969: Thanks for the great F1 torrents. We don't get coverage here, so it's greatly appreciated.

But I have to agree with everyone else on the file size issue. I like to watch F1 on my big tv, which doesn't recognize .m4v files, so I have to convert them with ArcSoft Media Converter 8 to H264(.avi). Same video quality and resolution as the original, but roughly 2gb smaller in file size. 

Try one of these out and see what I mean.

Just trying to help out. Saves your bandwidth and seeding time, and helps people get the files faster. Plus I hate having to avoid all forms of media and social media for days so some jerk doesn't spoil it for me. ;)"
,Abawcom,2013-03-23T21:53Z,Comon people im connected to 22 seeds and only getting 22 kbp/s....grrrr
,vfeore,2013-03-23T22:22Z,"Thanks, smcgill1969!!!"
,stuabroad,2013-03-24T00:24Z,7 hours later...still stuck at 7.1% - 0 download.  This is pathetic.  Where's The Black Night when we need him.
,Jnxd1,2013-03-24T03:47Z,"@smcgill1969 : I might have been unclear. I can play any file on my computer through VLC. In order to stream to my TV via DLNA, my TV can only decode H.264 avi files. So I have to convert the files because who wants to watch F1 on a small screen?

Via GSpot:
Your file in m4v:
5.79 GB
M4VH: 
- M4A : Apple iTunes AAC-LC (.M4A) Audio
- mp42: MP4 v2 [ISO 14496-14]
- isom: MP4  Base Media v1 [IS0 14496-12:2003]
Recommended Display Size: 1280 x 720
 mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC
48000Hz  128 kb/s tot , stereo (2/0)
Codec: avc1
Name: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC
5007kpbs
25.000fps
1280 x 720

After converting you file to H264 AVI for my TV:
3.36 GB
OpenDML (AVI v2.0)
Interleave: 201 ms (5.0 v.frames), preload=192
Audio frames: Split across interleaves
Video: 3.13 GB (93.30%)
Audio: 221 MB (6.45%)
AVI Overhead: 8.90 MB (0.26%)
0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3
48000Hz  192 kb/s tot , Stereo 
Codec H264
Name: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC
2779kbps
25.000fps
1280 x 720

Exact same resolution, but over 2GB smaller in file size. So just because it's a *.avi doesn't mean it's not done with the H.264 codec. ;)

@everybody else: I am seeding at 300kbps and will continue to do so until people stop downloading. So I'm not sure what people are on about not being able to d/l or having slow speeds..."
,rc90029,2013-03-24T06:36Z,"Thank You smcgill 1969. 

I think the file size is fine.   I downloaded averaging 250-350kbps and finised in 4hrs.

I remember you  mentioned you had an audio problem when cutting out advertisements.  If you can figure out a method of editing out the ads the file size could be a little smaller. 

Regardless, I have not complaints and if you can't cut the ads out its completely fine.  I'm just greatly thankful that I can watch Sky sports broadcast.

@Jnxd1: *.avi's are so last century - h264 is the future that's already here... :)

If you can't play *.m4v/mp4 you're missing out, no idea what hardware you're using but I suggest a good start would probably be - edited /Mod"
,smcgill1969,2013-03-24T13:47Z,"MOD @slih: Odd rule seing as it is free software I suggested they take a look at, but duly noted for the future... :)"
[M],slih,2013-03-24T14:29Z,"@smcgill1969 Instead of banning novices, TPB does give them a fair warning and a chance to improve themselves.

However, if you continue to put spamlinks in your comments or anywhere in your torrents there will be no more second chances. Closed /Mod"
,stuabroad,2013-03-24T23:21Z,After 8 hours still at 0.3kb/s - what's going on - i have a super fast connection with other stuff coming down fine.  This is poor.
,mrs67,2013-03-26T04:21Z,"Maybe you could cut the pre and post and put it in 3 different files so we can pick only the race. :)
Thanks for the upload."
