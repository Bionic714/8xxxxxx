Saving Egypt's Oldest Pyramid
The Step Pyramid of Saqqara, in the desert south of Cairo, is a keystone in the history of civilization. But it is falling apart, ravaged by looters, earthquakes and the erosive force of 4600 years of time. For five years, a team of British and Egyptian experts have been urgently at work to rescue this prototype for all the Egyptian pyramids. Can they win the race to save the precious pyramid and preserve its secrets and treasures?
