Information
------------------------------

Famed cartoonist Ub Iwerks's granddaughter Leslie turns the camera lens on the artists and storytellers behind some of the most widely hailed animated films of the modern era in the in-depth documentary The Pixar Story. Featuring such key members as John Lasseter, Steve Jobs, and George Lucas, the doc tells the story of the company's humble roots all the way to being one of the biggest power players in Hollywood. Featuring unseen footage of early output from the studio, as well as a full overview of its many box-office successes and technological breakthroughs, Iwerks's film celebrates the artistic spirit that has pushed the boundaries of what animation can deliver, while staying true to the ideals that its parent company Disney once held so dear.
