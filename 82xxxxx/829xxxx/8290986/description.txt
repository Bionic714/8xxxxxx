Game information:
=================

A supernatural horror action game with a story devised by the master
mythmaker, novelist and filmmaker Clive Barker. Mingling the darkest elements
of Barker's horror fiction and films, Jericho deals with the mysterious
reappearance of a lost city in a remote desert. When a form of evil that goes
right back to the dawn of days resurfaces from there, a Special Forces squad,
trained in both conventional warfare and the arcane arts, is sent in. Their
mission: hunt down and destroy the evil that lurks at the heart of the city
before it destroys humanity.

Notes:
=====

It's funny how group that is scene banned for obvious reasons tries to
proper us with theyr "properly rebuild" cracks. Can you proof that our
cracks are slower than the original protected executable?
Maybe you newschool wannabes don't know first working one wins.
Go back to your cave and pre more "propers", they get nuked anyways.
Or better yet, go and try to narq more game groups to the feds.
