Sentimental Journey is the debut solo album by former Beatles drummer Ringo
Starr, released in 1970, as the band was splintering apart. Although Starr was
the third member of the group to issue solo work (after George Harrison and
John Lennon), Sentimental Journey is notable for being the first non-avant-
garde studio album by a member of the band, in light of the experimental,
soundtrack or live releases his aforementioned bandmates had already released.
