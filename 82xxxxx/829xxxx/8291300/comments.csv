,gumland44,2013-03-24T23:16Z,"Can I have better install instructions? Why/what would I need to UnRAR it, when it shows up as a folder..."
,gumland44,2013-03-24T23:17Z,"Also, when I open it up, it just shows a white screen with v0.whatever at the bottom...."
,FieroGT,2013-03-25T01:32Z,"what you mean ""open it"" you mean running it? or have you not got it installed yet? make sure u copy over any crack files if needed.
"
,FieroGT,2013-03-25T01:43Z,"ok, game installs and runs ok. (to the main menu anyways).

I mounted the .cue file manually with poweriso virtual cd drive manager. 
(you can use any other virtual cd app, or just burn the bin./cue. to a CD.) You could also use sumthin like ultraiso  to extract it to the hd some where. winrar may even work to do this. lotsa options...

 then ran TRAFFICEINSTALL.EXE to install the game, that went smooth.
then i ran the game, and it asked me for the serial # which is in the nfo. i put it in, and hit ok.
then i'm at main menu, all is well. 
so to the guy who wanted more better destructions,... there ya go! :)"
