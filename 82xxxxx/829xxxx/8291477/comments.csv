,Abawcom,2013-03-23T17:04Z,Is this the Sky coverage or BBC?
,dano670,2013-03-23T17:33Z,Thanks a bunch!  I have basic cable and this is now on the extended channels so I have no way to watch it.
,Abawcom,2013-03-23T18:09Z,WARNING: NO PRE-SHOW QUALI ONLY! - SKY COVERAGE
,leodj29,2013-03-23T18:18Z,"@Abawcom:

,bmcghie,2013-03-24T01:48Z,"Thanks for the quick up. Excellent viewing. I personally prefer JUST having the event (quali this time). I don't need my pre-whatever. Also, Sky coverage is by far the best. It's all about Martin Brundle!"
,SerSpec-V,2013-03-24T06:30Z,I also prefer just having the event because it cuts down on file size. This is also great quality unlike the crappy XviD-Avi's that the other guy does.
,horsse,2013-03-24T11:09Z,"Thanks for the up !
It'd be great to have the pre-show, but I don't think Fairplay usually includes them ."
