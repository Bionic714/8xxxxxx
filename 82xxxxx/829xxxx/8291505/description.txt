Windsor Airlift was formed in 2002 out of Owatonna, Minnesota, 
and it comprised of Adam Young, Andy Johnson, and Tony Johnson 
(with Michael DeMars joining them from 2005-2006). Sometime after the 
album Flight was released, Adam left the band to focus his time 
on his larger project known as Owl City, and Windsor Airlift 
continued writing new songs, and in 2012, released The Meadow. 
Via a youtube video, the group has announced that they are 
working on a new album titled Moonfish Parachutist 2.

These are the albums contained in this torrent:

The Basement EP
The Forest Sings to Distant Shores
Selections for a Fallen Soldier Vol. II
Hotels EP
Qui!
Moonfish Parachutist
Ocean City Park and Beneath the Crystal Waves
We Rule
Flight 
The Meadow
Live at the Varsity Theater
Unknown Album (a collection of unreleased material from various times and places)

As for Volume I of Selections for a Fallen Soldier, only fifty copies were made, 
and it wasn't released again. If you own this album, I would really appreciate
getting a copy of it, as would everyone else. Thanks for downloading, and please seed.

I hope you enjoy this collection.
