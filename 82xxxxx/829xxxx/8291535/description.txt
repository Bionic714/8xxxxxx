            COFFEE AND SUGAR

This is the story of Joao, an uninspiring country boy who moves to a slum in the city with his drunken, violent, preacher father; The Bishop and falls for amiable whore named Charity.

Like life, the perfect drink should be bitter sweet and coffee is the resonance of existence in that; like the perfect coffee, life has many grains of bitter days; the type of days that might rot your stomach if they are all that you have; but, every now and then, one has a few sweet moments that make the tough days easier to digest, meaning one can take the learned lesson from life; the good and the bad and then strengthen their resolve and return in the morn with an eager thirst for more.
