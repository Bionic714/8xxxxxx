Way...Way Out is a 1966 American film comedy starring Jerry Lewis and released by 20th Century Fox on October 21, 1966.

The year is 1989, and the United States continues to be engaged in a space race with the Soviet Union.

The two male astronauts currently manning the US weather station on the moon, Hoffman (Dennis Weaver) and Schmidlap (Howard Morris), are suffering the effects of their long stay in space and need to be relieved, as Schmidlap regularly ties up Hoffman and has even knocked out his two front teeth. The sex-starved Schmidlap sits around drawing lewd pictures of naked women.

Mr. Quonset (Robert Morley), the head of NAWA, is concerned that the situation with Hoffman and Schmidlap threatens to become an embarrassment to NAWA. Furthermore, the Soviets have taken a step forward in the space race by placing the first (unmarried) male/female couple on the moon. Quonset decides the US should place the first married couple in space.

With the next NAWA space launch looming, the married astronauts scheduled for the mission split up. Quonset quickly turns to Peter Mattemore (Jerry Lewis) and Eileen Forbes (Connie Stevens), unmarried astronauts who have been at NAWA for years without having flown a mission. Forbes agrees to the marriage on the condition that they be married in name only, and the union is made official as they are rushed up the gantry for their space launch.

When they arrive on the moon, they receive regular visits from the Russian astronauts, Anna Soblova (Anita Ekberg) and Igor Baklenikov (Dick Shawn), living at the nearby Soviet lunar station. Antics ensue with vodka pill parties and the men preening for their beautiful female companions. The Soviets are suspected of trying to sabotage the U.S. space station, but they are soon vindicated.

Anna tricks Igor into marrying her by declaring she is pregnant. Once they are married she tells him the truth, and the Americans, who are now in love themselves, declare their intentions to have a "moon baby". As the film ends, the space race has escalated into a race to see which country will be the first to have a baby born on the moon.
