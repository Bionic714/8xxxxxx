Release Notes:
--------
Southern Hospitality has served up a southern fried delicacy with its debut
album, East LivinÆ.  Produced by Louisiana blues guitar-slinger Tab Benoit,
öSOHOö members J.P. Soars, Damon Fowler and Victor Wainwright, have followed a
swampy gumbo recipe reminiscent of classic southern rockers Little Feat (during
the Lowell George years) with a selection ranging from soul-inflected blues, to
country, to jazz, to straight-ahead rock.

SOHOFowler, who hails from Brandon, Florida, had produced three self-released
albums beginning in 1999 before signing with Blind Pig Records, which released
Sugar Shack in 2009 and Devil Got His Way in 2011.  Fowler is a guitarist with
a
passion for lap steel and Dobro.

Soars gained attention in 2009 when his band won the Blues FoundationÆs
International Blues Challenge and he won the Albert King Award as the best
guitarist.  Originally from Arkansas, Soars moved to Florida during his teens,
and spent six years playing in death metal bands.

Wainwright, who adds his swampy, boogie-woogie keyboards to the mixture, grew
up
in Savannah, Georgia and moved to Daytona Beach, Florida to attend college.  He
worked as an air-traffic controller for several years in Memphis, continued to
play music, and managed to release three albums.

SOHO came about in July 2011 when the three musicians, separately performing at
a music festival in Florida, had an impromptu jam session.  The trio was joined
on Easy LivinÆ by Chuck Riley on bass and Chris Peet on drums.

The bandÆs first offering begins with a funky, swampy ôSouthern LivinÆö penned
by the band members and Benoit.  SoarsÆ ôLong Way Homeö is a beefy blues
rocker,
which is followed by FowlerÆs laid-back soul ôKind Lies & Whiskey,ö SoarsÆ
öMile
After Mileö with its Smokey-and-the-Bandit twang, and WainwrightÆs cool soul
ôCertified Lover.ö  Willie Bobo and Melvin C. LastieÆs classic instrumental
ôFried Neckbonds and Home Fries,ö made famous with rock audiences by Santana,
is
one of only two covers in the collection.  The musicianship on the release is
solid, and the song selection is an appealing variety.  Check out FowlerÆs
ôDonÆt Feel Like Going There Todayö and ôSky is What I Breatheö to see the
range
of songwriting these guys are putting together.
