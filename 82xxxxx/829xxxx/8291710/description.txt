WE CASUALLY ACCEPT ELECTRONICS in our everyday world. Those who donΓÇÖt understand how it works are casually obedient. Those who take the time to learn electronics are viewed as geniuses. Do you want to learn how to control the power of electronics? This text provides a solid introduction to the field of electronics, both analog and digital. Electronic Circuits for the Evil Genius is based on practical projects that exercise the genius that exists in all of us.
