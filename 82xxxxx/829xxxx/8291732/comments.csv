You can use http://s000.tinyupload.com/?file_id=05045443011679727646 files as a crack. Those are some files from the Tomb Rider Skidrow steam release!"
,AmuLight,2013-03-23T21:49Z,"No, these are just the base files, no DLC's (mostly because I didn't feel like buying them)."
,megaman1111,2013-03-23T22:20Z,Crack seems to work fine. It also saves and downloads community levels!
,megaman1111,2013-03-23T22:21Z,Thank You !
,DefenderArcade,2013-03-23T22:33Z,"thanks for the upload!
