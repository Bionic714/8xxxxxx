An unforgettable journey into the spirit world of good and evil. 

The battle between right and wrong, moral and immoral, virtuous and vile is as old as recorded history. God placed the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil in the Garden of EdenΓÇöand directed man not to eat of it, adding that death would occur if man ate of that tree.

Today, the conflict still rages.

The Holy Bible is the only book ever written that gives us an insight into the heavenlies and allows us to peek into what lies beyond. There are literally hundreds of scriptures revealing all we need to know about this unseen world. We often miss the truth because we become bogged down in so many details, yet what is spoken of is tangible and real. 

As you delve into the amazing revelations concerning both angels and demons, your heart, soul, and mind will hear from heaven. God is waiting to unlock His treasure-trove of knowledge just for you. 

ANGELS AND DEMONS will give you an understanding of what is taking place in the spirit world and help you discover who you are in Christ and the authority you have.
