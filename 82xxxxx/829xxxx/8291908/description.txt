Released in 2004, this album is a tribute to legendary bluesman Robert Johnson. According to Claptons autobiography, the recordings werent intended to become an album. The band had rented the studio, but Clapton didnt have any songs written, so he suggested they record Robert Johnson songs. They recorded enough songs for an album and it was decided to release them as such.
