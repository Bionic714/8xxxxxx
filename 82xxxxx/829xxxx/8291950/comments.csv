I tried several times with WinToFlash and WinSetupFromUSB.
I always get this file copy error at WinXP txt setup:
MSVBVM50.dll copy error 

I lost many hours of my time - don't loose it you too.
(If you have a solution for this please write here) 

Cheers!"

The first one was fucked up so after reading the description and comments on this one, I gave it a try. I burned the ISO to a DVD+R, ran the disc and used the code I obtained from the fucked up ISO I had. I then upgraded which is recommended. Overall, this Microsoft Operating system ISO worked out for me with no problems. This is highly recommended if your looking for one."
