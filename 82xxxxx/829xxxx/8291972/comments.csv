[T],pharmakate,2013-03-23T20:15Z,@Mertonoia - This actually was the first Merton book I ever read. I found it in a Catholic Worker house back in the day; it shaped my thinking in about a dozen ways.
,Mertonoia,2013-03-27T03:44Z,"@pharmakate. You've made me look forward to it even more. May I ask how old you were? The exact same thing happened with me with Contemplative Prayer, in a convent I'd gone to for retreat. It's such a small book, and yet the consequences were huge."
[T],pharmakate,2013-03-27T05:28Z,"I was about 20, just discovering Gandhi, the meaning of Hiroshima, the way violence distorts language, the civil rights movement, the meaning of monasticism, etc."
,Mertonoia,2013-03-27T12:29Z,"@Pharmakate - What a deeply informing period. Sounds like you were very conscious and made the most of it. I've been thinking about the implications of profound non-violence and appreciate that you referred to it in the context of language. This book has come at a good time for me and I'm feeling selfishly thankful that you're not presently a hermit. Merton wrote inspiringly of this way, too, in Wisdom of the Desert."
[T],pharmakate,2013-03-28T10:54Z,"@Mertonoia - Wisdom of the Desert, now that's a book I should get hold of. But no, not a hermit presently or ever. Regarding nonviolence and language, someone recently recommended Nonviolent Communication to me -- there's an audio torrent of it here on tpb. You might want to check it out."
,Mertonoia,2013-03-28T19:39Z,"@Pharmakate - Kewel! Thanks again! I'd love to give you a copy of WOTD if you can think of a comfortable way to receive it. I know, I know, scanning. If only I had your Ninja skills."
