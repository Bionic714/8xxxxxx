Here's the discography to one of my all-time favorite bands; Eloy. Included here are all their studio albums from 1971 to 2009 and the 1971 through 1984 albums are all the Remastered versions. Also included are the various compilations Eloy have released, the 1978 "Live" album, the 1985 "Codename Wildgeese" soundtrack, and a 1973 bootleg.

Another thing I've also thrown in is "The Legacy Box", a 2 DVD set. The 1st DVD is a documentary that talks about Eloy's beginnings from 1969 to activities today. The 2nd DVD collects various videos of Eloy live.

The last thing I've thrown in is a Vinyl Rip of the 1977 "Ocean" album, since it's arguably their best album and my favorite from them. It's in a 24-bit + 192000Hz FLAC format, so enjoy!

P.S. - I found out I can't rip subtitles right, but I managed to make subtitles for the Documentary, though they're pretty amateur, so please forgive me about that.
