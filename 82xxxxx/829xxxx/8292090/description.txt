Tom and Jerry are two hit men, they work by day at a third-rate second-hand car dealership. Tom is a veteran and Jerry is a novice in their business, and their attitude toward their profession differs a lot. 
This movie is very hard to find. Not only is it rare, but if you search for it, all you will get is every Tom and Jerry cartoon ever made. so grab it here cause you'll never be able to find it again.  It is a fun, clever, and beautifully made film.
