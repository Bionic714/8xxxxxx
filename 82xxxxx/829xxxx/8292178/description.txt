A man and a woman, two casual acquaintances, learn that their respective spouses are having an affair with each other. This discovery drives them to do things they didnΓÇÖt dare to do before. What will prevail - the feeling of jealousy or passion? What to choose - revenge or forgiveness? The protagonists are looking for something to build a new life upon, but it is not easy: their every action is influenced by the fact of infidelity, and this infidelity has its own logic. ~ Venice International Film Festival
