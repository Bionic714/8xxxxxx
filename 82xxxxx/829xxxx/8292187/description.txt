Two troubled teens hitchhike across Bulgaria in Avé, in this indie road movie. The film explores the travelers’ burgeoning relationship as they reveal secrets about themselves along the way to an uncertain destiny. Starting off in the grim urban environment of Sofia and eventually making its ways across highways and farmlands to parts unknown, Avé offers up a journey threaded many a time before, though it adds a few minor twists along the way.
