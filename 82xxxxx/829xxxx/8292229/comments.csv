For the guy above and all the noobs who are clicking the link above, the Skidrow team doesnt have a site of their own. So, dont believe all those Skidrow scams hanging out in the net."

I installed this and it worked perfectly fine, I'm seeding at the moment and it works with a steam crack and play with friends!

,rodiastym,2013-03-26T06:38Z,"ai galera pra jogar o resident evil 6 de 2 no mesmo pc, em tela dividida ou split screen, e só ligar 2 controles no pc. no meu caso eu usei 2 controles usb do ps2. o jogo reconhece. não precisa instalar nada. e so conectar os controles e abrir o jogo. logo após o prólogo, na opção campanha de 2 jogadores, escolha tela dividida. depois, o primeiro controle escolhe com quem jogar, aperte start, depois o segundo controle (sem escolha) aperte start também. o jogo não reconhece o player 1 jogando no teclado e o player 2 no controle, ou vice-versa. pra jogar de dois tem que ter 2 controles ligados no pc..."
,flapane,2013-03-26T13:04Z,"Hello.
20.5Gb available on my SSD. 
The game (with all the foreign languages) occupies about 15gb, so the rip is supposed to require less space.
However the DOS window (Windows7 x64 here) halts at some point after 20-25 minutes, I can barely read the word ""error"", then the Visual C++ redistributable Setup appears and then the DOS windows tells me that the extraction has finished.

However I can't find anything in c:gamesresident but just the whole folder (632 folders) structure without any files.

Any hints?
Thanks"
[V],PirateBoy,2013-03-27T02:44Z,Keep more free space and then re-install. Try with around 40 gb free space.
