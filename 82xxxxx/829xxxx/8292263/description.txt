Young's Literal Translation (YLT) was created by Robert Young who also compiled Young's Analytical Concordance. Produced and printed in the late 19th century, Young's Literal Translation was designed to assist students in the close study of the Biblical text by reproducing in English the Hebrew and Greek language and idioms in an exceedingly literal translation.
