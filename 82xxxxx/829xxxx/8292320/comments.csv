,JudasX8792,2013-04-19T10:28Z,For some reason these videos are not playing in VLC player. It plays for like 1 or 2 seconds and then it freezes. The player itself still works and I don't have to force close it. This issue is on all the video files. 
,JudasX8792,2013-04-19T10:30Z,EDIT: NEVER MIND. I WAS TRYING TO LOAD THE WRONG FILES.
