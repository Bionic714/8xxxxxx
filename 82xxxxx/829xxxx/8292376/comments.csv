Okay loads of work done here i encoded this copy for myself but thought why not share it,The R5 version of this movie is different from what the R1 and R2 are going to be,instead of what the synopsis states theres 3 kids watching youtube videos.There is a total of about 8 minutes of russian audio dubbed over english audio that we left intact as you can hear what's being said.I also dropped the 6 channel russian audio in BS broke it in to 6 mono waves isolated the vocals so now the english is more legible"

,libertaswv,2013-03-24T20:58Z,"@ juular: tried to find the skinny but ran out of time (gotta go out).... Here's a link to the imdb discussion section, though.... Might find something there, though you'll have to wade through lots and lots of pissed off people, lol.

,Juular,2013-03-24T21:38Z,"I found out. Basically the whole segment with Dennis Quaid is absent from this version (so that includes Will Sasso, Seth MacFarlane, etc). Instead we get these dumb teenagers in this version. Also it must be shitty for Russians to watch over-dubbed movies with the original dub in the back."
,r4z0rz,2013-03-25T01:32Z,"@Juular - In Russia the over-dubbing the original dub thing is more of a stylization in parody movies than it is a problem, in the 90s there weren't any professional dubs so now they make fun of it when they make ""Goblin"" translations."
