Okay loads of work done here i encoded this copy for myself but thought why not share it,The R5 version of this movie is different from what the R1 and R2 are going to be,instead of what the synopsis states theres 3 kids watching youtube videos.There is a total of about 8 minutes of russian audio dubbed over english audio that we left intact as you can hear what's being said.I also dropped the 6 channel russian audio in BS broke it in to 6 mono waves isolated the vocals so now the english is more legible"
