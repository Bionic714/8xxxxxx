Will rate my opinion of quality after download finishes. Im a little liberal with it though cuz Im not real picky when it comes to cams."
,ninemill,2013-03-24T05:56Z,A/V anyone seen it yet
,Ozzen,2013-03-24T06:15Z,I'll look forward to your response before i download this one.

,smknjoker,2013-03-24T07:31Z,"Alright well I lazily watched about 3/4 way though the movie and I gotta say it's not the worst cam by far and could be a shitload worse.

V=7.5: A little shaky for the first 1-2 minutes or so. Nothing serious their. Bright and pretty clean in both light and dark scenes. Only downsides (and this could only be me) is that about 3-4 times the video and audio will loop back or ""rewind"" a couple seconds and then continue playing normally and very occasionally you'll be able to tell the picture is cropped. Overall it's very good video for cam.

A=6: It's probably the first thing you'll notice when you start playing it.  It's not that it's bad, as you can hear everything perfectly fine, it's just that it seems a bit hollow is all. Not out of sync as far as I watched either. I didn't have it turned up too loud so can't say how it would sound blasted or anything. 

Now this is just my opinion and as I said before I not picky when it comes to cams. So there's my two cents. Take it or hate it. Thanks for the upload and great work on the first cam release guys.

,devanika3,2013-03-26T23:53Z,smknjoker thank for writing a review on the A&V it was very helpful :)
,musclestud1,2013-03-27T00:22Z,Thank Joker. Keep on postin' . WE appreciate your detailed comments. FU to the complainers.
,Binks92,2013-03-27T05:46Z,"thanks joker, I rarely comment. When I do comment, it's for quality and I tend to do it like you did. Screw those complainers, the more the better.

Oh! and Thanks scene4all, I don't know how much stuff I got from you so far lol."
,tmc8080,2013-03-28T21:09Z,"Someone should create a chart of what a X/10 would mean. On some of these cams w/ hollowed audio-- (6?) I'm on the fence as to whether to DL unless I really can't wait. For most animated cams I expect for there to be some decent line audio within 2 weeks of release. Blu ray rip can come at 1-2 months out as manufacture print gets ripped from China. If it's a keeper, you end up having to DL twice... no biggie I guess. Props. Comments seem spot on for most. Keep up the decent work!"

,MrJumper,2013-04-22T23:07Z,"@Joker, keep putting your stamp on it man, I would like to see more people put a less technical spin on it, I'm no technogeek so all the numbers and methods of how exactly a torrent was cleaned up are lost on me most of the time, it's nice to see it put in terms that ""Simple Folk"" can understand...I just wanna know if it's watchable, lol"
