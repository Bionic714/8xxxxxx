Thanks:
Joseph "Sir.Vixx" Popa and Sean Deady for always being good friends. My Parents for their continued support. The World's disaster status for giving me inspiration and material. The Internet, I would not be where I am today with out it. Shinryaku! Ika Musume, It was fun making a song about such a wonderfully weird and innocent anime. Then getting a bunch of non-otakus to remix it. AND A BIG THANK YOU TO EVERYONE WHO DID A REMIX, WHO DOWNLOADED THE ALBUM, WHO LISTEN TO MY MUSIC! I DON'T DO IT FOR YOU, BUT YOU MAKE ALOT MORE WORTH WHILE! 8====D
