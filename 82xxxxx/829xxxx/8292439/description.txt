The Mighty Thor Lord of Earth - The Reigning complete (2003-04)

Okay, this is a six-issue mini series from the period where Marvel simply couldn't put enough numbers on the front cover.  So... this mini is either issues 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, and 74 _OR_ issues 571, 572, 573, 574, 575, and 576.  I'm not going to discuss the convoluted volume identifiers.

There has been some points that issue 73/575 should be read as the 3rd book to read in the Timestorm 2009-2099 mini series which mostly weak, but I'm posting this concurrently with that series for those that feel passionately in favor.
