,Scythro,2013-03-24T02:58Z,Of course it is legit. Why would I waste my time and bandwith for a fake upload?! :) I was probably as much eager if not more to get my hands on the patch as likely you are since the game kept crashing on me on late floors and 3-4 hours just flew out the window in a snap of a finger.
,TheVulcanKid,2013-03-24T04:08Z,Cmon guys seed when your done downloading 
,devtech,2013-03-24T05:27Z,"This is fake, it's Dark Out"
,okoo,2013-03-24T07:26Z,fake??????
,RaptX,2013-03-24T09:12Z,anyone try it ?
,LeBum22,2013-03-24T09:24Z,I don't want to say it's fake just yet. But it looks suspicious. I will confirm once I finish downloading.
,okoo,2013-03-24T09:29Z,i just don't know why it was a .exe net another
,Scythro,2013-03-24T11:38Z,THAN DON'T DOWNLOAD IT YOU FUCKING UNGRATEFUL MORONS!!!!!!!!!!
,devtech,2013-03-24T12:44Z,Since this idiot is still defending this torrent all you need to do is go into your temp directory and use 7zip to examine the executable file and you'll see it's a fake yourselves.
,Zzwayne,2013-03-24T12:47Z,"Hey I just registered to say that I owe you one Scy and I completly understand that guys like devtech make you upset the dickhead starts bitching at 5 a.m on a fresh upload. 
Where's the respect and grace nowdays when you took your time to give us this.
Anyways thats all I wanted, thanks for your work I've been waiting for this for a long time :)!!!THANKS"
,okoo,2013-03-24T12:55Z,it is read thx Scythro
,okoo,2013-03-24T12:55Z,real
,Scythro,2013-03-24T12:57Z,"It's an .exe 'cause it's an installer not an iso file.

@Zzwayne thanks at least someone appriecates it.

@devtech Than why are you still here? just fuck off already and as I said TALK SHIT AFTER YOU TRIED IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,Scythro,2013-03-24T12:59Z,You're welcome okoo
,devtech,2013-03-24T13:08Z,I was mistaken. This is infact legit. Thanks Scythro.
,hothing23,2013-03-24T16:40Z,This is legit. I made an account just to say this but fell asleep while it was downloading last night.
,DaZekeMan,2013-03-24T18:20Z,"Aw hell yeah, now I won't fail those recipes that I thought weren't on 1.0.1. Thanks Scythro!

And people, if a torrent looks ""suspicious"" try using a malware scanner before you start attacking an uploaders reputation."
,LeBum22,2013-03-24T22:32Z,"Yeah this is legit, million thanks to Scythro. Sorry for being suspicious, it usually how it goes when it's too good to be true. :3"
,akimus1,2013-03-25T00:04Z,"Also confirming that this is legit, again i am glad that you  took the time and effort to give the community this. You deserve infinite Kudos. Also you can use this game to earn you some trust/face on TPB since it's kinda of a high profile game right now. So if you keep updates/dlc comming i guess you can in sometime (about 3 pages worth of content i think) earn a trusted from the bay staff. Keep up the good work good man."
,sa4w35t,2013-03-25T01:23Z,thanks a lot man! Been looking for the new update for ages!
,Scythro,2013-03-25T04:03Z,"Y'all welcome and thanks for the kind words :)

Just a word of advice stay the hell away from Von Neuman Probes, I just got disintegrated in my 11 hour long run on level 29 with 2 power armors on me *sighs* oh well at least I learned some recepies I guess.. heh"
,opiatius,2013-03-25T07:23Z,Thanks alot much appreciated
,boltar1,2013-03-29T17:28Z,"can you please post 1.0.3.0? Scythro
