"Alvin Band" is a testament of true, unadulterated stream-of-consciousness musical exploration, and twenty-one-year-old Southern-California-based Rick Alvin Schaier serves as its master. "Mantis Preying", the first "official" release by Alvin Band also includes a limited edition bonus 6-song EP from an earlier bedroom recording that has come to be known as "Lady Portrait". (Rick is also a member of Modern Art/Epic act Miniature Tigers it should be noted) For fans of Animal Collective, Grizzly Bear, Of Montreal, etc.
