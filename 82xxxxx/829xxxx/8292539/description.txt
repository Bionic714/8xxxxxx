Bizarre covers alternative culture through interviews with counterculture personages, and articles about LGBT culture and drug, fetish, and other subcultures. It also reviews the work of avant-garde directors, musicians, authors, and visual artistsΓÇöand of those who have a cult following.
The magazine's news coverage includes unusual news events from around the world; development and impact of legislation concerning censorship, civil liberties, sex offences, and occasionally, incidents of human rights abuses. Articles in Bizarre have examined the Manchester police's Operation Spanner of 1987, Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, British legislation banning "extreme pornography", and the Terrorism Act 2000. After the murder of Sophie Lancaster in 2007, Bizarre campaigned for awareness of bigotry against people who exhibit some form of cultural deviance.
