 I know little about how this works, but these are the settings which gave Me success

I used:
Pete's OpenGL 2.9;
Internal X Res- 1-high
internal y res- 1 high
Stretching- 0-standard
Render - 0-standard


Texture Filtering - 0
Hi-Res textures -0 
""use pixel shader for 'psx texture window' eumlation"" un-ticked

FPS limit to 60FPS

Compatibility

No full-screen filters, flicker fix border 0 pixels

Special Game Fixes- I have ONLY the following checkmark'd currently:

That's all;
