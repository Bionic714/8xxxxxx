The hard to find and tough to emulate game, Hot Wheels: Turbo Racing!

This was one of my favorite playstation games as a kid, and I haven't seen a disc of it since. 

Had one hell of a time finding a Rom and Emulator setup that worked! 
Nobody with torrents of the ROM would seed, and only old and crappy download sites had them, with all but this one broken in some way. 

I present it to you, along with the emulator and plugins I managed to (finally) run it with!
