The hard to find and tough to emulate game, Hot Wheels: Turbo Racing!

This was one of my favorite playstation games as a kid, and I haven't seen a disc of it since. 

Had one hell of a time finding a Rom and Emulator setup that worked! 
Nobody with torrents of the ROM would seed, and only old and crappy download sites had them, with all but this one broken in some way. 

I present it to you, along with the emulator and plugins I managed to (finally) run it with!

I know little about how this works, but these are the settings which gave Me success

I used:
Pete's OpenGL 2.9;
Internal X Res- 1-high
internal y res- 1 high
Stretching- 0-standard
Render - 0-standard


Texture Filtering - 0
Hi-Res textures -0 
"use pixel shader for 'psx texture window' eumlation" un-ticked

FPS limit to 60FPS

Compatibility

off-screen drawing- 1 
framebuffer effects- 0
Framebuffer upload- 1

No full-screen filters, flicker fix border 0 pixels

Special Game Fixes- I have ONLY the following checkmark'd currently:

0x0001: Fake low compatibility frameread

0x0010: Disable coord check

0x0400: Fake subtractive blending



That's all;
May you enjoy this game as much as I did.
