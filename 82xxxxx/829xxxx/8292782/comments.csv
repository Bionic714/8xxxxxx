@pebh thanks for the kind words.  If I come across any RA or Mercury Rev I will up it."
,Paprikorn,2013-03-26T15:28Z,"I've got to agree w/ @pebh, these Maiden rips have a great sound to them, great dynamics and mastering, but there's an insane amount of distortion. 

Was this somehow caused post-rip or is this present when played on your turntable? Have the records been cleaned properly before being ripped?

Thanks, nonetheless!"
,CanIHasMusic,2013-06-04T18:44Z,"With Heavy Metal, there's always distortion. Just be thankful there is not overbearing hiss and pop like many other vinyl rips of Maiden"
