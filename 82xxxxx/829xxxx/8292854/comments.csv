,Bowen.55,2013-05-24T11:12Z,"V=10
A=10 shame about the corruption in the first video but someone has posted a link to it it. This is a great series and if you liked all the HBO mini series like Generation kill, Band of Brothers, and The Pacific then you will very much so enjoy this. Torrent it a solid 8/10. Would be perfect if not for corruption at 1:08 in first vid but again its been posted else where. Subs are great too. Oh and downspeed is very good. I was hitting 1.1MB/s at a few points and i have a very bad connection. Will seed this for a long while."
