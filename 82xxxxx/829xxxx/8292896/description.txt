Beautiful People is a British comedy drama television series based on the memoirs of Barneys creative director Simon Doonan. The series takes place in Reading, Berkshire, in 1997, where thirteen-year-old Simon Doonan and his best friend Kylie dream of escaping their dreary suburban surroundings and moving to cosmopolitan London "to live amongst the beautiful people".

P.S. The only reason this is being uploaded is because this series is virtually impossible to find! 

P.S.S. I'm going to close out the other torrent that has just season one in it, because it's a little redundant to have this torrent with both seasons and the other with just one.  Don't worry I'll be seeding this for a long time!
