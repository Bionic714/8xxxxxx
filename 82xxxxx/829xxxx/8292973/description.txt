 : 4.25 am, 5 August 1962, West Los Angeles Police Department                 :
 : 'Marilyn Monroe has died of an overdose', a man's voice says dully. And    :
 : when the stunned policeman asked 'What?', the same voice struggled to      :
 : repeat 'Marilyn Monroe has died. She has committed suicide.'               :
 :                                                                            :
 : If life were scripted like the movies, this extraordinary phone call would :
 : have been made by the most important man in Marilyn Monroe's life - Dr     :
 : Ralph Greenson, her final psychoanalyst. During her last years Marilyn had :
 : come to rely on Greenson more and more. She met with him almost every day. :
 : He was her analyst, her friend and her confessor. He was the last person to:
 : see her alive, and the first to see her dead.                              :
 :                                                                            :
 : In this highly acclaimed novel, Marilyn's last years - and her last        :
 : sessions on Dr Greenson's couch - are brilliantly recreated. This is the   :
 : story of the world's most famous and elusive actress, and the world she    :
 : inhabited, surrounded by such figures as Arthur Miller, Truman Capote and  :
 : John Huston. It is a remarkable piece of storytelling that illuminates one :
 : of the greatest icons of the twentieth century."                           :
