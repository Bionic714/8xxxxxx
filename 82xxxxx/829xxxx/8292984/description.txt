With his simple, recognisable and accessible sound, Jimmy Reed was perhaps one of the most commercially successful blues artists in the USA in the '50s and '60s, if not of all time. This is the most comprehensive collection of his earliest recordings ever released and is the first time ever on CD that all his A and B sides have been compiled chronologically in one collection.
Features all the Jimmy Reed classics that you would expect: 'Baby What You Want Me to Do'; 'Bright Lights Big City'; 'Honest I Do'; 'You Don't Have to Go'; 'Going to New York'; 'Ain't That Lovin' You Baby' and 'Big Boss Man'.
