,Elnisky,2013-03-24T15:08Z,"@snuzr1 Find your root directory of Rocksmith, then create a folder called ""Content"". So, just copy the files onto it"

How to get the songs workong on legit steam:

the only requirement is that you own atleast ONE DLC of any kind (time saver pack/song/free holiday pack/preorder thingy (any .dat inside your content folder that you ACTUALLY own)


Download and run RocksmithTookitGUI.exe from

https://code.google.com/p/rocksmith-custom-song-creator/downloads/detail?name=RocksmithCustomSongToolkit-v1.1.4.3.zip

1. Go to the DLC Packer/Unpacker tab and unpack your DLC (anything that you OWN inside your content folder) .. then open the APP_ID file with notepad and copy the number inside there

2. then fill in that number in the textfield (theres the APP ID from the song Damnit)

3. then select the folder where you'd like all the output we are going to get (make this something else then the folder where all your DLC's are) - SavePath

4. and click bulk repack and then select the folder where you have all your downloaded DLC's 

(make sure the only files inside that folder are .dat files, else the program will probably crash (I didn't program any error checking))
then click Bulk Repack.. now it may look like the program is hanging or going to crash but it won't, it's just busy repacking your DLC's



What it's doing now is.. unpacking all the DLC's you have in that folder.. editing the APP_ID number and repacking them again.. Just look inside the folder.. you'll notice when it's done 
then copy all the .dat files to your content folder and voila.. got all DLC's on legit rocksmith	


Enjoy :):)"
,vi37n0w,2013-03-27T21:21Z,Thank you so much! The least I can do is try and answer questions. The DLC is tagged with a unique code so if you are getting updates on Rocksmith then the DLC as is WILL NOT WORK. You can however use a tool to fix this if you own the game and have a some DLC. Search around. One reason that a FAQ is bad is that it's a treasure map for the people who fix the cracks.
,snuzr1,2013-04-06T21:11Z,"@ikraam007 im still confused i got the program and tried to do it but im lost.
@vi37n0w if you find a solution to make it work on legit steam rocksmith can you upload a video how? or something? it be much appreciated "
