Storyline: 
A cop, investigating the mysterious death of a filmstar, meets a sex-worker, while he faces some personal problems psychologically. The mystery connects these people in a way, that ultimately changes their lives. It is after Sarfarosh (1999) that Aamir gets to don the khaki again and looks like he isnâ™t playing the goody-two-shoes cop this time. Complete with a roguish stubble, Aamir will take on the bad guys as a Crime Branch officer in Reema Kagtiâ™s film. Shooting for ‘Talaashâ™, also starring Rani Mukerji and Kareena Kapoor, has already begun. In fact, Aamir, Rani and Kareena have already started attending workshops as part of their preparation for their roles.
