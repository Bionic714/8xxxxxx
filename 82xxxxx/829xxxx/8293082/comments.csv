THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR UPLOADING THIS, BLACKTAR!"

,DerangedS,2013-03-24T06:07Z,So would this be a good download? I've been wanting to read the third book for awhile now and can't be bothered to get a physical copy. Download was quick so I should know soon.

,R3DOX,2013-03-24T17:18Z,"Damn bro you beat me to it. I had a kindle that had this book on it but could not find it anywhere within the files. Could you tell me how to managed to find it? I have no problems stripping drm just finding the dammed files. I could only find a hand full of books within the books dir. The book was bought on amazon and then transferred to the kindle via wifi and is not stored on the cloud (at least I don't think it is.) any insight would be a preciated. 

Thanks
