A little history abut Crime: 
Crime and the City Solution are an Australian rock/punk band, which formed in late 1977 by singer-songwriter and frontman Simon Bonney. 
The group had four distinct line-ups with Bonney as the only mainstay: 
Sydney in 1977–78 
Melbourne in 1979 
Two groupings in Berlin from 1985 to 1990. 

In the late 1970s Bonney had met McLennan and sometimes provided guest vocals for McLennan's group, Particles. 
By 1991 Bonney had moved to Los Angeles where he released two solo albums 

In late 2011, Bonney was based in Detroit and announced that Crime and the City Solution would re-form to record a new album for Mute Records in 2012.
