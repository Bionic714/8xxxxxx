    Appropriate for all graduate-level and advanced undergraduate courses 
    in cryptography and related mathematical fields. Modern Cryptography 
    is an indispensable resource for every advanced student of cryptography 
    who intends to implement strong security in real-world applications. 

    Leading HP security expert Wenbo Mao explains why conventional crypto 
    schemes, protocols, and systems are profoundly vulnerable, introducing 
    both fundamental theory and real-world attacks. Next, he shows how to 
    implement crypto systems that are truly "fit for application," and 
    formally demonstrate their fitness. 

    He begins by reviewing the foundations of cryptography: probability, 
    information theory, computational complexity, number theory, algebraic 
    techniques, and more. He presents the "ideal" principles of 
    authentication, comparing them with real-world implementation. 

    Mao assesses the strength of IPSec, IKE, SSH, SSL, TLS, Kerberos, and 
    other standards, and offers practical guidance on designing stronger 
    crypto schemes and using formal methods to prove their security and 
    efficiency. Finally, he presents an in-depth introduction to 
    zero-knowledge protocols: their characteristics, development, 
    arguments, and proofs. Mao relies on practical examples throughout, 
    and provides all the mathematical background students will need.
