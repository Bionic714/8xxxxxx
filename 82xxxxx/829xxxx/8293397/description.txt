 : Charged with comic energy and a steely disregard for any pieties           :
 : whatsoever, Barney's Version is a major Richler novel, the most personal   :
 : and feeling book of a long and distinguished career.                       :

 : Told in the first person, it gives us the life (and what a life!) of Barney:
 : Panofsky--whose trashy TV company, Totally Useless Productions, has made   :
 : him a small fortune; whose three wives include a martyred feminist icon, a :
 : quintessential JCP (Jewish-Canadian Princess), and the incomparable Miriam,:
 : the perfect wife, lover, and mother--alas, now married to another man; who :
 : recalls with nostalgia and pain his young manhood in the Paris of the early:
 : fifties, and his lifelong passion for wine, women, and the Montreal        :
 : Canadiens; who either did or didn't murder his best friend, Boogie, after  :
 : discovering him in bed with The Second Mrs. Panofsky; whose satirical eye  :
 : for the idiocies of today's Quebec separatists (as well as for every other :
 : kind of political correctness) manages to offend his entire                :
 : acquaintanceship (and will soon be offending readers everywhere); and whose:
 : memory--though not his bile--is, in his sixty-seventh year, definitely     :
 : slipping...                                                                :
