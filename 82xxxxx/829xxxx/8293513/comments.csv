,alliw98,2013-03-27T00:15Z,"NOOB PLEASE ANSWER
"
,alliw98,2013-03-27T00:19Z,someone
,alliw98,2013-03-27T00:28Z,i read on the wineskin forum it said yo have to ask you so is it legal
,alliw98,2013-03-27T00:30Z,is this a pirated copy please just answer
,alliw98,2013-03-27T00:33Z,last time is it legal
,TheLahnik,2013-03-27T00:38Z,"@alliw98 Dude, chill the fuck out. Noone's gonna answer straight away.

And yes, Piracy is illegal.
You are taking a game made my other people, and selling it for free.
That's illegal.


Now on another note, the game itself had a virus in it. So my Virus Cleaner thing got rid of the virus and in return, got rid of the game.

I'm going to try it once again to see if it'll work, but so far, this game is of no use."
,TheLahnik,2013-03-27T00:40Z,"@alliw98 And yes it is a Pirated copy, because Dead Space 3 is not made for Mac.
It is made for Xbox 360, Ps3, and PC. That means someone had to convert it from a PC game to a Mac to make it playable.
Therefore, it is Pirated."
,TheLahnik,2013-03-27T00:57Z,"Okey dokey.
Upon re-unzipping this file, I removed my Anti Virus that I could see if the game worked, and voilà, it works! =D
I set the graphics to the highest (because my Mac can stand it) and it still runs smoothly =)

For the people who don't mind having a Virus in their mac, this works very good. But if you are against viruses, then well, find another game to play =P

Thank you Noobnak for the Upload =)"
,TheLahnik,2013-03-27T00:58Z,"Oh yes, and btw, im running:

Processor: 2.6 GHz Intel Core i7
Graphics:  Intel HD Graphics 4000 512 MB
Software: Mac OS X Lion 10.7.5 (11G63b"
,alliw98,2013-03-27T01:06Z,thank you anyway
,alliw98,2013-03-27T01:10Z,BUT ITS LEGAL BECAUSE YOU CANT BUY IT ANYWHERE ELSE
,TheLahnik,2013-03-27T02:06Z,"@alliw98 You're welcome anyway.

And first of all, it is NOT legal. Just because it is not available anywhere else (which I completely call bullshit on) doesn't mean you can steal it from someone else.
That's basically what piracy is. Stealing, and stealing is illegal.

I have a great feeling that you are trolling.
Because you just didn't make any sense with that ""BECAUSE YOU CANT BUY IT ANYWHERE ELSE"" bullshit lol

So get the fuck outta here lol"
,alliw98,2013-03-27T13:59Z,lol
,alliw98,2013-03-27T14:00Z,"MY PARENTS DONT BELIEVE IN PIRACY.

I DONT LIKE THAT, BUT."
,alliw98,2013-03-27T14:00Z,I WASNT TROLLING
,eman87,2013-03-27T15:15Z,"AWESOME!!! work perfect on my macbookpro. Just a little trash in the menu and the start movies, but its not present in game.
Great WORK man!"
,naffbilly,2013-03-27T18:24Z,"For some reason this isn't opening on my mac, it opens for a while, nothing happens then shuts down. Opening it again launches the wineskin application inside the contents folder. Im running Lion 10.7.5 with Intel Core Duo, and have 4 GB of RAM if that's important."
,naffbilly,2013-03-27T18:26Z,I also noticed that the wineskin searches for game/dead space 3 limited edition/dead space 3.exe but there is no dead space 3.exe in that directory. Could that be the problem?
,naffbilly,2013-03-27T18:29Z,"Won't work on my mac with 10.7.5 lion, Intel Core Duo with 2.6GHz. Help please?"
,naffbilly,2013-03-27T18:38Z,Won't work with all the required specs. deadspce3.exe is missing. Help?
,malthus0,2013-03-27T20:29Z,"Great work, working excellent. I have Lion 10.7.5 NVIDIA GeForce 320M, 8 GB. Playing with Low specs, graphics still good."
,TheLahnik,2013-03-27T22:51Z,"@naffbilly Like what happened with me, you're computer probably deleted the file ""deadspace3.exe"" because there was a virus in it.

""deadspace3.exe"" is the actual game file. Without that, you cannot play the game.

Try disabling your Anti-Virus, and then unzipping the file again. Should work =)"
,eman87,2013-03-28T02:32Z,"noobank, great work but i need help, there are a like lines everywhere and its very difficult play, i try deactivate every filter, and updating the wineskin, but nothing change. If i try to down all filter, the lines are more present and visibles, any idea?

Thanks anyway and i hope for your answer."
,Kaien213,2013-03-28T12:07Z,"The game works fine on
Lion 10.7.5
3.06 GHz Intel Core Duo
12 GB Ram
ATI Radeon HD 4670  256 MB"
,noobnak,2013-03-29T17:32Z,@eman87 try to re-unzip the file and see if it work =)
,eman87,2013-03-29T23:38Z,"noobank, sound stupid, but i doit and nothing, by the way, im check with porting team and is a reconized bug of the wrapper just for ATI cards."
,Scipio323,2013-03-30T21:42Z,"I seem to be having the same problem that naffbilly and lahnik had, where it appears in the dock, stays for a minute, and then goes away. the only difference is that I do have the deadspace3.exe file on mine, and it still won't start. any suggestions?"
,kocierondo34,2013-04-09T22:54Z,"Sorry for posting late. You wouldn't believe if I said I couldn't create a piratebay account before switching to greenland gl.  I had the same problem, as the game wouldn't start after waiting to be opened in the dock, then quitting without any errors. It got fixed after I extracted the game NOT with the unarchiver utility, BUT WITH the archieve utility.  So, try to extract the deadspace3.zip file with another program.  BTW, the game was AWESOME and thanks noobnak for creating and sharing this wonderful piece with us.  Please keep up the great work."
,Scipio323,2013-04-12T05:18Z,"Well thanks, that actually got it working like a charm! However, I seem to have a fairly major graphics issue, where most of the screen is covered in little horizontal black bars, as well as it still being unpleasantly choppy (though mostly playable) on minimum graphics settings. It seems like it might be my graphics card, but I'm crossing my fingers that it's something that can be resolved easily. I'm running Lion on a 2011 Intel mac, for the record."
,Gamatosreee,2013-04-21T10:07Z,Will this play at 10.6.8 version???
,noobnak,2013-04-21T11:32Z,i have not test on 10.6.8 yet but i think it will work
