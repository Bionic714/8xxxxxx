I would've included series 7 but it's hasn't finished its run yet. 

This torrent is for those who have limited download speed, limited HD space. It'll look very good viewing on an computer screen, i've seen watched it on a TV so i can't say. If you're looking for the best quality, i suggest searching for uploader meech for series 1-4, and search for the blu ray or 720p files for series 5 onward.
