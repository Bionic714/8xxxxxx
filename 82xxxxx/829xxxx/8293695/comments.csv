,Who-He-iZ,2013-03-24T10:29Z,Very nice uploads ! BUT are you really sure you're up to this task ? Over 20 sets to seed to 100%. Don't believe that seeders number here on TPB - check always your uTorrent instead. Only 2 torrents seems to have finished so far. Check them all and SEED.
,DeliTide,2013-03-24T11:24Z,Yes I realized that my speed was not up to the task. I will only be putting out a few a day from now on.
,DeliTide,2013-03-24T11:30Z,Yeah 3 a day from now on should be good. I have most of them from 432 to 860. 311 in total
,Who-He-iZ,2013-03-24T16:14Z,"^OK. Thx for your answer. Now, don't abandon any unfinished torrents. Do like this: Check uTorrent trackers (very carefully) and go through each of your uploads, those that shows 10 downloaded (in trackers) are OK and you can stop seeding them. Then you will eventually find uncompleted torrents, just focus on them next and seed. I hope this will help ?"
,DeliTide,2013-03-25T02:21Z,I certainly won't abandon them. As of right now 3 of the 21 torrents are below 10 seeds. The others are all above 30. So maybe 3 a day is too little an amount. I'll turn off seeding for all except the ones that need to finish and of course the new ones I will put out today.
