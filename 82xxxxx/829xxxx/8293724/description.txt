This is Original SLRR 2.3.0 le (live) edition of the game.
You can:
Race in the city WITHOUT crashes, like some versions of this game...
Race in TEST RUN.
Race in Race Of Champions and complete the game, then do it again and again.

Possible Crashes: 
a)when you starting the Drag race at night in the city, dont press Slow Motion button (Enter), because it makes the Game Crash.
b)Then you start the game, there is sound but no video. Press escape a few times (about 5 or 6) till you see the car and at the bottom it says Redline 2.3.0 Live

3) Open "retail to 2.2.1.exe" and install it
4) Open "StreetLegal_Redline_230LE_patch" and install it, but when selected where to install, like D:gamesStreet legal Redline or something like that, make this / at the end, so it could find the game files. ( It should look like this: D:gamesStreet legal Redline )
5) Play the game.
