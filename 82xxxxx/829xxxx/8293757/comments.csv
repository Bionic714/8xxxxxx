,frostyon420,2013-03-24T09:48Z,Is it hardware that u use to record ur vids or simply software such as screen recording? I've been wanting to upload good quality shows and the best I can come up with is screen capturing. Such as bandicam (thx sceneDL) and muxing em then editing em then remuxing. Any feedback is appreciated
