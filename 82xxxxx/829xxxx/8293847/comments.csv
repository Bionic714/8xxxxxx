Am I the only one that's having this problem? Solutions?

Besides that issue, everything else looks great."

I'll admit, I haven't messed around with the configurations much on VLC. I've never had to adjust the audio settings until now. I've learned a lot in the few hours that have passed, except how to downmix to stereo.

I've went through control panel>Sounds to mess with the speaker configs there. I've went through VLC Tools>Preferences>Show settings--All>Audio and messed around with the configs in the sub-tabs. Tried looking up possible solutions on google and VLC forums. Even played around with AC3Filter. Nothing. 

Something tells me it's something simple but I'm making it out to be something major. 

Tl;dr - Basically, I'm still having the same problem and have no fucking clue what to do to fix it. Is there a specific set-up, audio filter or something that could possibly fix this issue?"

I downloaded PotPlayer and everything works great!

Once again, just wanted to say thanks. Excellent quality, for those who wanted to know."
