,zzastava,2013-03-24T18:22Z,is securely cracks application for more than 1000 movies
,Captain_Ketchup,2013-03-26T20:53Z,I got up to 181 movies and it said that my trial version has expired. The website says the trial is limited to 50 movies so the crack had to work at first. Anyone have any idea why it stopped working?
,bungholeteep,2013-03-26T21:13Z,"I used this for 131 movies a day or two ago. Today I started to catalog the rest of my movies and was only able to add 50 more before it said my trial period was up. The website says you get 50 movies with trial period, so obviously the crack worked the first day. Does anyone have any idea why it isn't working anymore?"

No issues with the torrent, it works perfect and is a must have for any movie collector. Don't make the same mistake as me, use a VPN to switch through IPs and don't download through them like a crazy nutsack and you'll be fine. The torrent is fine, it was a user error on my part. I felt the need to let you know."

,daniex,2013-04-08T09:06Z,"Hi guys, maybe someone can help me out? I downloaded this torrent and used the crack as directed and yet I am getting an error when I search that says ""Search failed: Trial Edition Expired"". Can anyone explain this?"
