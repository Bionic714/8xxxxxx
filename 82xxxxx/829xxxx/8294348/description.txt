Nicolo Paganini: Italian composer and violin virtuoso. Born in Genoa, where he studied with local musicians. He made ΓÇïΓÇïhis first public appearance at age nine and toured several cities in Lombardy at thirteen. However, until 1813 it was not considered a violin virtuoso. In 1801 he composed more than twenty works that combines guitar with other instruments. From 1805 to 1813 he was music director at the court of Maria Anna Elisa Bacciocchi, Princess of Lucca and Napoleon's sister. 
Lucca abandoned in 1813 and began to tour Italy, where his playing attracted the attention of his listeners. In 1828 he went to Vienna, then to Paris and London in 1831. In Paris he met the Hungarian pianist and composer Franz Liszt, who, fascinated by his technique, developed a pianistic counterpart Paganini inspired by what he had done with the violin. He quit touring in 1834. His technique was amazed both audiences of the time they came to think that there was any evil influence over him. Could interpret works only with great difficulty of the four violin strings (first removing the other three, so that they would not break during his performance), and play along to two or three voices, so that seemed several violins sounding. This indicates the nearness of his art to the show. His works include twenty-four caprices for solo violin (1801-1807), six concertos and several sonatas.
