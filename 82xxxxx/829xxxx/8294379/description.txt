Lost Worlds: Series 1
Dig into the sands of time with this exploration into lost civilizations. Scientists, archaeologists, and historians alike search for evidence of cities that may have forever been lost to time. Some are ancient while some are surprisingly recent. Journey back to Jerusalem when Christ walked through its streets. Explore the mysteries of the Knights Templar. See Egypt when Ramses ruled and discover what it looked like in Braveheart's Scotland. Recent cities include Winston Churchill's secret bunkers and a Welthauptstadt Germania that Hitler envisioned. Graphic recreations and location shots bring these cities to life.




4)  Atlantis 
The wonders of Atlantis are described at length in ancient writings, including those of the philosopher Plato. But was his description of the island civilization just shadows on the cave wall, or was there really such a place? The latest research, expert analysis, and cutting-edge technology take us back to a peaceful island that exploded with devastating force. At the dawn of the 20th Century, the remains of a palace were discovered on the island of Crete, preserved beneath volcanic ash. Our experts link the Cretan palace and a town on Santorini through the unique engineering of their buildings. Rebuilding towns, temples, and the palace of Atlantis as described by Plato, Lost Worlds reveals the majesty and mystery of this lost world. The builders of the original palace achieved a level of engineering excellence not matched for centuries. With its massive scale, complex water-management systems, and sparkling gypsum walls, the engineering of this extraordinary palace connects it to Plato's descriptions of Atlantis.
