My personal favorite episodes from StarTalk Radio show.

StarTalk, from Curved Light Productions, is the first and only popular commercial radio program devoted to all things space and is hosted by renowned astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson. As Director of the Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History, Tyson makes regular appearances as the ΓÇ£nationΓÇÖs expert on spaceΓÇ¥ on major news programs and popular shows (Daily Show, Colbert Report).

TysonΓÇÖs writings (such as The Sky is Not the Limit: Adventures of an Urban Astrophysicist) and NOVA specials (Origins, and NOVA ScienceNOW) have already won him a faithful media following. His most recent book, Death by Black Hole and Other Cosmic Quandaries reached the New York Times Best Seller List. Tyson was named Time MagazineΓÇÖs 100 Most Influential Persons in the World for 2007.

StarTalk Radio bridges the intersection between Pop Culture and Science with clarity, humor and passion. Captivating subjectsΓÇösuch as space travel, extra-terrestrial life, the Big Bang, the future of our Earth and the environment, and breaking news from the universeΓÇöwill all be explored. Hilarity ensues as Tyson is joined each week by comedian co-hosts, celebrities, and other special guests.
