THIS IS HAPPENING TO MANY GAMERS APPARENTLY, SO YOU ARE NOT ALONE


IF YOU GET A BLACK SCREEN WITH THE LOADING CURSOR IN THE MIDDLE

THEN WAIT FOR 5-15 MINS, THE GAME WILL EVENTUALLY LOAD. 

ONCE YOU ARE PAST THE GAME VISUAL SETTINGS, EVERYTHING GOES NORMALLY (THE WAY IT SHOULD BE)



MINE TAKES ABOUT 5-7 MINUTES TO LOAD



IMPORTANT:

EVERY TIME YOU CHANGE THE VISUAL SETTINGS YOU WILL HAVE TO WAIT ANOTHER 5-15 MIN (DEPENDING ON YOUR MACHINE)

SO TRY TO CONFIGURE THE SETTINGS USING THE TEXT DOCUMENT IN YOUR DOCUMENTS FOLDER(CAPCOM/RESIDENT EVIL 6)
