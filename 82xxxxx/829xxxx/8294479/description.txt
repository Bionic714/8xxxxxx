Description:
-------------
With a mix of action, survival horror, Resident Evil 6 promises to be the dramatic horror experience of 2013. Favorites such as Resident Evil Leon S. Kennedy, Chris Redfield and Ada Wong join forces with new characters, including Jake Muller, to face a new horror, the highly virulent virus-C, as the narrative moves from North America to the state of Edonia, torn war and located in Eastern Europe, and to the Chinese city of Lanshiang.

Starting with three different but intertwined stories, each with a couple of actors to play alone or in co-op, both local and online, Resident Evil 6 not only provides different perspectives and styles of play, but introduces the innovative mechanics allowing Crossover players join and share the horror. At key moments of the game, up to 4 players can join online to meet a specific situation, with changing partners in some areas to increase the depth of the game.

Once players complete all three kickoffs, unlock a new campaign with the true femme fatale of Resident Evil, Ada Wong. Ada's campaign, a single player experience, contains missions, weapons and gameplay only to respond to questions triggered by the first three campaigns.
