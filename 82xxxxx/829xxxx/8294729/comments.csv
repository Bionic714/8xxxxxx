I have a 0.677 ratio on utorrent for this and from everything I have heard pretty much everything sn1p3r puts out is good as gold 8( and I have been trying to find a nice AT download so I can get into the show! if anyone could help, I'd give you many internet high fives and winky faces/emoticons. Promise."

,thezeros,2013-05-24T18:02Z,"Yeah well I'm unable to seed for quite a while, not because of my internet. But because I can't find a storage place for 1.5TB, as my 2TB drive is dying and before I RMA it I want to save stuff from it. But I don't have money for a new one, nor did I find a place to save it yet."
