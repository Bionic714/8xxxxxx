[V],Gh0stNet,2013-03-24T14:28Z,OH Really!! -_-
,letslovelikejesus,2013-03-24T21:36Z,Is this a new Ip man movie? Oh no 2 channel audio... why? :(
,AnonymousBasterd,2013-03-24T23:20Z,"Obviously, the title used was the Hong Kong english title."
,monster.x,2013-03-25T00:37Z,if it's this movie http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1462900/ then it seems to be 6 minutes short?
,Cibaka,2013-03-25T08:45Z,"Initially it was ""The Grandmasters"".
It was released as ""The Grandmaster"".
Somewhat puzzling.
The attention to details, of the various martial arts styles is admirable. This is not your usual ""action"" flick.
25 f.p.s. should account for the lost few minutes.
I hope there'll be a 4-hour version."
[V],GoodFilms,2013-03-25T16:18Z,"The ""working title"" (title used before release - GrandmasterS) is irrelevant. Even in Hong Kong, the English title is THE GRANDMASTER."
,letslovelikejesus,2013-03-28T04:51Z,"This movie really sucks big time if you compare it to the old Ip/yip-man movies (2008/2010). This movie has Camera switch every 3rd second in a fight which makes the fight screnes the worst ever, and half of the movie is in slowmotion, not only the fight scenes which is extremely anoying but also other scenes when they're not fighting. I give this movie 3.5 out of 10... the other 3 Ip-man movies are worth atleast a 9 out of 10"
