~~~~~~~~~~
This patch contains several performance optimizations in the rendering code.
On most machines, the game should run about 20% faster.

Update 12:
~~~~~~~~~~
Major Fixes
* no more quitting crash
* Game crashes when opponent disconnects
* Some people are finding the game is rendering cutscenes and menus far too
  big for their screens, resulting in the screen only showing the top left
  1/4 of the image. - Caused by forcing a resolution under graphics drivers
* Favored achievement doesn't unlock, as game doesn't correctly track spent
  tributes
* Tiny spiders don't spawn from bodies in lair
* Feedback visual effect caused by the amps on the Screaming Wall sometimes
  causes brief screen tearing and artifacts (both in-game and in cutscenes).
  This is more pronounced on the story mission involving it.
* Beer mission extremely hard in high-sim
* When changing the heads of Mt.Rockmore the UI says to press Esc to exit.
  It should really be 'E', Esc only bring up the in-game menu. I believe
  other prompts for this area have been reported as incorrect too.
* Ambient Occlusion visible through grass
* History/lore background is transparent (shows game screen), instead of
  opaque black
* Broken Achievements: Overkill and Protector
* Reward for hunting missions does not unlock
* Raptor elk (Summoned with call of the wild) don't cast any shadows unless
  Eddie is riding one
* Deuce has weird ghosting effect during cutscenes on high-sim
* Some prompts are not appearing, including ""concept art unlocked"" popups,
  and bound serpent/motorforge-related popups. Improving, but not yet fixed
  Rewards for getting serpents still missing
* Sound effects seem to be significantly lower quality than music/VO
* Late in the game when you return to bladehenge, everything is completely
  black and white Probably related to skies afire bug below
* When switching from controller to mouse, mouse input registers as extremely
  slow movement, and stops after the pointer hits the edge of the screen
* Mouse control on radial menus can be tricky to select diagonal options
  sometimes
* Game not saving properly for some people. Chapters list shows completed
  chapters, but can't load chapter saves or select continue.
* Eddie's ID tags frequently pass through his chest in cutscenes
* Shadows seem to be drawn in reverse - as you approach, they vanish
* Skies Afire turns the game to black and white - not the washed out grey/red
  look on consoles, but proper black/white (including the sky)
* Missing prompts for unlocking songs, changing tracks when in-car
* Colour correction goes too far during lamprey feeding area (SP), making it
  way less saturated than on consoles. Issue begins shortly after breaking
  through the doors in the car
* After alt-tabbing, menus are completely black. Loading a multiplayer match
  then leaving resolves this. This can also be triggered by changing anything
  other than brightness under display settings
* Chrome shader broken, causing many chrome objects to appear black
  (including spiders)
* Special characters in some languages (French confirmed) are displayed as
  black boxes
* When using a controller, the mouse cursor is not hidden
* Default key binds still place the right speaker attack and exit stage
  functions on the same key so you can't use the right speaker.
* Whispering Rock achievement doesn't unlock
* Map is hard to navigate with keyboard, and can't be used with the mouse
(may need to delete preferences file for this to take effect
- located in C:UsersUSERNAMEAppDataRoamingDoublefine
* Sometimes keyboard stops responding, while mouse continues to function
* Some users reporting issues with default sound mix
* Druid chanting in the opening sequence is too loud
* Career totals aren't always saved correctly, and have been known to get
  stuck or reset
* ""Leaving map"" warning not present in MP
* Mouse moves camera while using radial menus
* MISSING DIALOGUE - Many of Ozzie's comments when buying stuff are not
  played. May only apply when using a mouse.
* Back slot category in the motor forge "
[V],Mr.Stifmeister,2013-03-24T13:23Z,"* Oceans often fail to render on AMD cards
* Light of the gods (marker beacon) doesn't appear 80% of the time
* Feeding area monster has no roar in cutscene
* Map doesn't let you instantly get out of it after looking at it
  (backspace won't respond again after a few seconds)
* MISSING CUTSCENE - Doviculus finding Ophelia's knife, after bridge escape
* Spiral in sky is broken on Feeding Area (probably other maps too)
* Some menu elements are still not mouse clickable, most notably the
  ""difficulty,"" ""invite friends,"" and ""back"" buttons in the AI Practice menu,
  as well as the buttons in the confirmation dialogue after hitting back on
  this menu. Other confirmation dialogues are clickable though.
* Lines appearing through unit construction indicators
* Character animation sometimes plays at a lower framerate than everything
  else
* After entering the menu, the displayed FPS through Fraps remains at 60,
  but it seems to be introducing microstutters which I suspect means it drops
  to 30. To reproduce this, start a new match and fly. Use the mouse to rotate
  the camera at a constant slow speed
  (or better, use a controller's right stick)
  Pause and resume the game, and watch the background.
  Everything moves much less smoothly.
* Doviculus doesn't cast a shadow, only his sceptre/staff does
* Add maps to loading screens (as seen on consoles)
* Ophelia's wings are solid black sheets, and appear to be missing the wispy
  tendrils they had on consoles
* Framerate is locked to 30FPS
* Remove ""Do not turn off power"" message during startup. People don't do that
* Shadows are completely nonfunctional on some computers now
* Transparency is broken on some of the UI elements in game
  (such as the completion notice for guitar solos)
* Some people are getting horzontal lines on the ground in game where there
  are no shadows
* No option to remap the sprint key (it's called Boost)
* The Chains of Hell solo from Tainted Coil doesn't seem to be working at all
* Camera speed has a maximum, so trying to make quick turns with a mouse is
  frustrating (even with sensitivity on maximum)
* Massive framerate drops at the end of multiplayer matches - appears to be
  linked to Tainted Coil stage collapse
* Mouse selection in the radial menus is very sluggish and hard to use

,klord2010,2013-03-24T17:12Z,"original game size = total update size (almost)
brutal legend of updates! this is getting real stupid..."
,wroth91,2013-03-24T19:10Z,"Of course the update size is that big, u have any idea how shitty this port is? Before the updates I couldn't even run it at a playable speed on my high end gaming laptop. I realize PS3 to PC is not easy but they could have done better before releasing it. This is a pretty epic game though, but still not worth what they are charging, so I thank you Stif for keeping me updated."
