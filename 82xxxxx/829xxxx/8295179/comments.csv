,mdub56,2013-03-24T16:08Z,and for emaszs......fuck off you little shit! notice the green skull?!?!? NOT FAKE!!!
,Abawcom,2013-03-24T16:27Z,"Thanks Footy, REAL DEAL DOWNLOAD - NO PASSWORD NEEDED. PRE SHOW - RACE - POST SHOW -- Please seed when you finish Downloading for the rest of us. Thank you and thank you FOOTY from all of us here in the USofA."
,sonnrol,2013-03-24T17:20Z,"How can it be possible to download a fake file when I just click on the download?
I have finished downloading and need a password to open?"
,sotio1972,2013-03-24T17:43Z,"Anyone finished downloading this? I started it some 4 hours ago, and still at 40%."
,vfeore,2013-03-24T18:14Z,"Thanks, Footy!"
,v3ngence,2013-03-24T20:14Z,"What the FUCK is with the 10 kB/s download speed?!

You're torrent is shit and you should feel shit!"
,stuabroad,2013-03-24T21:01Z,WOW - UP TO 3.6KB/S NOW.  
,shroomn,2013-03-24T21:31Z,"not sure why but this is downloading INCREDIBLY slow.

much thanks to footy for uploading but this download speed is really abnormal."
,stewbee,2013-03-24T21:37Z,All you whiners can bite it.  Footy's been my sole source for F1 for a few years now.  His torrents are absolute quality and usually available the same day.  I don't see anyone else doing better.  Thanks again from the States Footy!!
,pxpierre,2013-03-24T22:39Z,"I which there would be in 3 different files: PRE SHOW - RACE - POST SHOW so I could watch the race while the post show downloads for example.

To all the dummies complaining about download speed: look at the number of Seeders vs the Leechers and stop complaining you idiots!"
,guber,2013-03-24T23:23Z,Thanks!
,stuabroad,2013-03-24T23:27Z,@pxpierre WE'VE BEEN SEEING MAX SPEED OF 3KB/S YOU FREAK.  THIS NEVER HAPPENS - YOU TRYING TO TELL ME 2000+ SEEDERS ALL COMBINE TO 3 KB/S AROUND THE PLANET? SMARTEN UP.
,Primaris,2013-03-24T23:27Z,"Thanks for providing quality F1 again!

Please ignore the ignorant."
,hamham42,2013-03-25T00:00Z,"Thanks again as always for the amazing and ridiculously quick race uploads, Footy! For us over here across the pond, where the NBC coverage is complete shit, your downloads are a godsend =)"
,pxpierre,2013-03-25T00:17Z,"@ stuabroad - You live in a shitty place with a shitty internet connection and footy can't do anything about it.

I am currently in Central America, my max download speed is 200 kb/s and currently I am downloading this torrent @ 180 kb/s which excellent considering there are currently almost twice as much Leechers compared to Seeders.

One big problem is assholes that choke their uploading speed in their Torrent client thinking it will download faster but it is the opposite as it takes more time to get a big number of seeders.

Dumb fucks!

I also check the ratio of uploading/downloading in the Peers panel of uTorrent and I ban all the jerks. Results: the best peers get the most upload speed from me."
,ivoryh1632,2013-03-25T00:18Z,"Thanks so much for putting up these races!!! My boyfriend and I are so glad we found your uploads of Sky's coverage of the race, the coverage here in the US is awful and these files have made the season worth watching. Thanks again!"
,gosensgo,2013-03-25T01:27Z,is HD coming or should I just go ahead with SD? would be good to know so I don't have to dl twice
,dfekety,2013-03-25T03:06Z,"Thank you, footy. Much appreciated. Great quality and timely delivery as always, even though it's ""only"" SD. The regulars here can trust me that this upload is real and you should have nothing to worry about with passwords or any of that rubbish talk.

Yeah, the speeds are a bit slow on this one (took me ~9 hours to DL, haha), but it's SO worth it. For those who still haven't seen this race's coverage, you're in for an exciting watch!"
,stuabroad,2013-03-25T03:21Z,"@pxpierre - you're probably about 15yrs old so i will say only this.  I've been downloading this torrent for 10 hours.  I've deleted it twice and used two different clients.  I got a 1.3kb/s speed.  I dont give a shit what you think you know - i'm a MCA  and  was using Usenet before you knew what a mobile phone was. I live in Western Canada with super-fast fibre direct to my front door.  When you do your research, feel free to explain to us all what difference it makes how good my internet connection is, when i have other multiple connections able to download at 3mb+. "
,v3ngence,2013-03-25T05:22Z,"This shitty speed-capped torrent aside...

HOLY SHIT THAT WAS A GREAT RACE!!!

(seb you're a dick!)"
,AmpolGold,2013-03-25T07:20Z,"Thanks Footy, fuck the rest."
,Cock_Pushup,2013-03-26T05:55Z,"Thanks, footy! Still downloading, will seed forever!!"
,SwedishMeatball,2013-03-28T19:23Z,"Thank you so much

Any chance you could do the WTCC, GP3 and AutoGP series also?"
,SwedishMeatball,2013-03-28T19:27Z,Downloading at 2.2Mb/sec! WTG seeders!
