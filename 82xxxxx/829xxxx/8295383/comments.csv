Thanks"
,beechyboy,2013-03-24T14:51Z,"PS - For a 20 min show, why is this webrip video so big? (488 mb)
The webrip I converted from a flv to avi with 1000kbps & 29 fps is only 160 mb. 
I up'ed it to show you..."

I will upload WS.DSR version which has 93MB only. For those who have limited bandwidth."
,q2323,2013-03-24T15:06Z,"I set quality to auto, and it made it over 3000kbps. My bad, I always learn something new.

However, this is not a WebRip."
,beechyboy,2013-03-24T17:42Z,"It's still way too big for a 20 minute TV show.
It's almost three times bigger than It should be.
Unless you have unlimited bandwidth, a smaller file size is preferred."
