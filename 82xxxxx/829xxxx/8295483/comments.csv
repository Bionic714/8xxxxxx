,jamesban,2013-03-24T16:37Z,Whats the resolution on this? Was it a bluray rip? Can it be burned to a dual layer DVD? I have HD tv and DVD player but not  ablurya burner and never downloaded an HD movie as VOB files only mkv files so sorry for the questions. Thanks for the uploads also. Waiting for all the ghibli to be released on blu-ray for my daughter!

If I see it in Blueray I'll post it but blueray doesn't seem to be so popular in my small town. anyway, I just posted this (raw DVD) in case someone didn't like my rip... but there is a high quality h264 version too https://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8295486"
