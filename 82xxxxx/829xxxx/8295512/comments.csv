,beechyboy,2013-03-24T16:47Z,"20 min -> 175 - 200 Mib

40 min -> 300 - 350 Mib

60 min -> 400 - 450 Mib

This is the average file sizes for TV shows with those run times.

If you have limited bandwidth (like me) you are conscious of file size when downloading. "
,q2323,2013-03-24T17:08Z,"Yeah, if you have skills and long experience with encoding, you can achieve even better file sizes. By the way, source of this file is WS.DSR, which is not a HD."
,beechyboy,2013-03-24T17:39Z,"Should have labeled it HQ (webrip) not HD.

I just finished watching the entire episode.
With a 1000 Kbps, 29.9 frame rate and small file size, it's got a good picture for a WebRip. 

"
,q2323,2013-03-24T18:48Z,It's not webrip. Simply because original source wasn't web. Somebody recorded this with a TV card.
