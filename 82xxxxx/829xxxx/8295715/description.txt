 : 'At the age of twelve my ambition was to be a gangster. To me being a      :
 : wiseguy was better than being president of the United States. To be a      :
 : wiseguy was to own the world.' GoodFellas is Henry Hill's own story,       :
 : telling the fascinating and sometimes brutal details of the day-to-day life:
 : of a working New York mobster - the violence, wild spending sprees, his    :
 : wife, his mistress, his code of honour. From the small-time scamming of his:
 : early years, his first arrest at the age of sixteen and initiation into the:
 : dealings of his wiseguy friends and bosses, Henry Hill tells of the good   :
 : times, dodgy dealings, indulgences, and the insularity of the              :
 : mob-controlled neighbourhoods. But things start to go too far. To save his :
 : own life, Hill turns into a Federal witness, and the mob is to this day    :
 : still hunting him down for revealing their involvement in hundreds of      :
 : crimes including arson, extortion, hijacking, the six-million dollar       :
 : Lufthansa heist (the most successful cash robbery in US history), and      :
 : murder.                                                                    :
