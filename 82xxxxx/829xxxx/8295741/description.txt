 Last summer Dawes lit up the night with their bright Americana rock n' roll at the XPoNential Music Festival. 

Their performance was one of the festival's highlights. Listen to the full performance here and check out the photo gallery too. 

 Dawes' new album, Stories Don't End, 

is set for release on April 9 and XPN's Free At Noon audience is one of the first to hear some of their new music live. 

The album is the band's first release on its own label, HUB Records, and features the already hit single, "From A Window Seat." 

 Dawes played SXSW in Austin last week, then heads to Dallas and Nashville, 

before hitting the east coast, with a stop in Baltimore. Then on to Maine and Vermont. 

They will be back in the tri-state area on April 12, at the Bob Carpenter Center (tix), 

opening for Bob Dylan. You can find all of their tour dates here: Dawes Tour Dates
