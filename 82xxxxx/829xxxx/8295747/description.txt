Menschenfrauen (TV 1980)
Country: Austria, Germany

The relationship between four women and one man is the focus of this feminist drama. Franz (Klaus Wildbolz) is unusual for a journalist, in that he is fairly laid back and pleasant; but he does have a tendency to complain. His life is more complex than normal because of his liaisons with his wife Anna (Susanne Widl), Petra, a nurse (Christiane von Aster), Elizabeth, a barmaid (Renee Felden), and ateacher named Gertrud (Maria Martina). Two of these women are expecting a child by Franz, while all of them cater to his needs and tolerate his foibles. But Franz is heading for a wake-up call as the women slowly begin to expect more from life and from him.
