,MikeR56,2013-03-24T16:03Z,Why is this posted twice?
,smcgill1969,2013-03-24T16:18Z,"Sorry about that, I'm not at home &  my 'tech support' made a typo in the upload! :(

The incorrectly named 2012 torrent only seeded for about 10mins though - I deleted it it from TPB but it doesn't seemed to have disappeared from the list yet..."
,ablamboo,2013-03-24T18:14Z,Thanks for posting - but please be careful of spoilers -  like mentioning who's on pole! Some of us may have not yet watched quali...  :(
,horsse,2013-03-24T18:37Z,10.7 GB ?
,rixnstuff,2013-03-24T19:42Z,"Thanks again, but would appreciate if you wouldn't give out quali results."
,CompressF1Races,2013-03-24T20:06Z,10 GB? Worst uploader ever. I'll be lucky to have this downloaded my Wednesdy. YOU FUCKING SUCK COMPRESS THIS SHIT WERE YOU ACTUALLY BORN YESTERDAY? or here's a thought: separate the 3 hours of crap from the race and put them into a folder so we can CHOOSE NOT TO HAVE THE BULLSHIT. I literally could not give less of a fuck about the extra crap and so do the majority of people. We just want to watch the race but because of your incompetence NO ONE CAN WATCH ON RACE DAY. 
,stuabroad,2013-03-24T20:53Z,"Been downloading for 4 hours at no more than 2.6kb/s - with 34 seeders?  Need smaller file sizes.  For the trouble and effort you've gone to upload, you're not really meeting the needs of those who want to download the torrent.  Most of us are looking for the Qualy and Race in a reasonable size file because the TV coverage is crap.  There's no need to be a cunt about it like the idiot above, and everyone has to SEED, but look on it from those downloading point of view.  I'm looking elsewhere."
,stuabroad,2013-03-24T20:54Z,...and don't include the results from Qualy in case we haven't WATCHED it yet!
,stuabroad,2013-03-24T20:57Z,"GO HERE FOR 2.6GB FILE:

,smcgill1969,2013-03-24T22:54Z,"CompressF1Races: I am so so sorry to have messed you about, please supply me with your postal address & I'll get a refund check posted to you right away! 

Oh, wait a minute... ;)"
,batt1987,2013-03-25T00:08Z,This is a crap upload!!! been downloading for 8hours  and still not done... and now nobody`s seeding thanks a lot!!! you ruined my day :(
,TauxFaux,2013-03-25T06:40Z,Does this include Pre and Post Race? Thanks!
,puppeli66,2013-03-25T14:28Z,"You guys that think that this is too good for you and too big in size, go and find a smaller one and stop acting like idiots. I for one like the good quality and the inside of the sport. Please keep up the good work. It would be an idea of having the torrent starting as following ""Formula 1 F1 ...."" to make it easier to find it with different search words like ""formula or f1"", it would solve the seeding too having more people on your torrent. I guess the frame rate is 50fps being this size.? It would be good to have some basic information. Thanks "
,madh4tter,2013-03-27T16:40Z,Complete package and excellent quality as usual..thank you!
