The Booze Bombs were founded in a small town called Calw which is deep deep in the Black Forest in Germany! A great sound is what you will get from this rockin combo, Straight away they captured heart and soul of all germany audience and even on their US-Tour they left a mark for all critical faces. The voice of the Sicilian singer Annie Leopardo, recalls the energy of a jealous italian Mama. With her powerful voice she could even sweep away Wanda Jackson.'
