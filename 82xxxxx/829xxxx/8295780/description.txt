Lost Worlds: Series 1
Dig into the sands of time with this exploration into lost civilizations. Scientists, archaeologists, and historians alike search for evidence of cities that may have forever been lost to time. Some are ancient while some are surprisingly recent. Journey back to Jerusalem when Christ walked through its streets. Explore the mysteries of the Knights Templar. See Egypt when Ramses ruled and discover what it looked like in Braveheart's Scotland. Recent cities include Winston Churchill's secret bunkers and a Welthauptstadt Germania that Hitler envisioned. Graphic recreations and location shots bring these cities to life.




5)  Ramses Egyptian Empire 
In 1300 BC, the mighty Egyptian civilization was in its golden age. Its ruler was Ramses II, a man who intended to be the greatest of the Pharaohs. He made his mark by building vast statues, towering obelisks, temples carved from the living rock. Ramses was a giant of a man, dominating his kingdom for 67 years, pushing it on to ever greater glory. Lost Worlds travels to Egypt to examine the remains of Ramses' accomplishments. With the aid of new research and cutting edge graphics technology, the true scale of his ambition can now be fully revealed. Ramses Egyptian Empire reconstructs the grand hypostyle hall at Karnak, explores the technical innovation and engineering skill that produced the temple at Abu Simbel, rebuilds the Ramesseum as he would have seen it, and uncovers how the extraordinary tomb that Ramses built for himself would have looked when his body was finally laid there.
