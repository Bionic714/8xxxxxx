This is like, a HUGE piece of history that was previously missing in my life!!!
How is it that EVERYONE knows about Pear Harbor and Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the beaches at Normandy and Germany, Poland, France, Italy, the Holocaust the British air raids etc etc, the list goes on & on with countless documentaries & full length big budget films covering every single event, but I've NEVER, in my 27 years heard mention of 1937 in Nanking? Even though my own American (like myself- despite my name) Mother just happens to speak Japanese fluently & lived in Japan for 2 years before I was born.
I'm not very ""pro-war"", and I've always thought that the atomic bombs dropped on Japan, were unprecedented in recent history. Not because of there physical devastation but for having involved so many citizens.
This documentary has shifted my viewpoint a bit. You need not look back to Genghis Khan, ancient China, or Rome to find atrocities in such vast numbers.
I wonder how many other major war crimes of such a size I am oblivious to in recent history?"
