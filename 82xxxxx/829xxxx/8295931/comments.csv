,Mika412,2013-03-24T18:42Z,"Sorry for not beeing able to differentiate korean from japanese. People can download whatever they want, and this is the original movie not like other that put spam. And here they can download or watch the movie online (with the link I provided)."
,nick3110,2013-03-25T12:28Z,"Mika412 if you have actually watched the series once in your life you would know it's not japanese, for example anyone who watches the series knows to recognize the characters voices"
,Mika412,2013-03-25T13:29Z,"I usually watch the episodes dubbed in Russian. The  site where I got the movie, it said that it is in Japanese."
,cagrn1,2013-03-29T05:49Z,People need to stop complaining over nothing and acting like they know what people watch. Not everyone watches in the same language as you. Good effort mika and thanks.
