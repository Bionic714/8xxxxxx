This is a VHS dub, so please excuse the quality.  If anyone has a better version of the whole episode, please share.  Until then, enjoy!!

This was one of the first episodes that was filmed, not in a small venue, but in a large hall and without a host.  Jules Shear introduces this set "filmed just for Unplugged."
