The Atlas of Middle-Earth by Karen Wynn Fonstad, 1991.

The definitive guide to the geography of Middle-earth, from its founding in the Elder Days through the Third Age, including the journeys of Bilbo, Frodo, and the Fellowship of the Ring.

Hundreds of maps and diagrams survey the journeys of the principal characters day by day -- including all the battles and key locations of the First, Second, and Third Ages.

Plans and descriptions of castles, buildings, and distinctive landforms are given, along with thematic maps describing the climate, vegetation, languages, and population distribution of Middle-earth throughout its history.

An extensive appendix and an index help readers correlate the maps with Tolkien's novels.
