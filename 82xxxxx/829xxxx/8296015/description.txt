http://nimga.com/m/W9gJd.png

As part of the Goodbye TV Centre celebrations, guitarist, singer and
songwriter Richard Thompson plays a one-off concert filmed in TC8.

Thompson has been performing in BBC TV studios since 1969, starting
on Top of the Pops with Fairport Convention and then making frequent
appearances on the Old Grey Whistle Test, The Late Show and Later
with Jools Holland as a solo artist and bandleader.

Filmed before the opening night of the tour celebrating the Top 20
placing of his album Electric, Thompson leads his current power trio
through songs from that album, including Salford Sunday and Stony
Ground, alongside classics from his songbook like I Want to See the
Bright Lights and Tear Stained Letter. Thompson is joined on a couple
of acoustic songs by former Fairport bandmate and master fiddler
Dave Swarbrick, frequent collaborator Pete Zorn adds sax to Al Bowllys
In Heaven and his daughter Kami Thompson harmonises on Waltzing for Dreamers.

Filmed before a small studio audience in the bare style of some of the
previous BBC music shows on which Thompson has appeared, this concert
celebrates Thompson and a tradition of popular music performance from
TV Centre.
