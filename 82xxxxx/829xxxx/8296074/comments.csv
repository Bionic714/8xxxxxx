If this occurs, just use your task manager to end the game. I'm running Win7 Ultimate 32bit, and I've still had to do this several times myself.

I'm sorry this happens, and there's nothing I can do to rectify it. Good thing the game works great. 

And for new users, please remember to go change your IGN in he rev.ini file. 

Everyone enjoy the Game!"
