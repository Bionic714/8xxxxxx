Information
------------------------------

Nanking The film - a documentary - tells the story of the Rape of Nanking in 1937. The Japanes had invaded China and as they approached the then capital, Nanking, the European residents there, about a dozen, set up a safe area for refugees. When the Japanese troops entered the city they took anyone who might be a Chinese soldier and killed them. Women and children were raped and murdered. Estimates of the dead range from 150,000 to 300,000. The "safe area" saved around 250,000 people. 
The film is very well made and tells the story with the help of actors for the western witnesses, using their own words - all of them are now dead. For the Chinese and Japanese viewpoints they found living witnesses and participants. They have chosen not to voice over the interviews but to rely on sub-titles. The emotion that pours from the screen is heartbreaking. For the Chinese they interviewed it was as if it just happened yesterday. I wept. 
If you can bear to watch it, this is a sobering film. Man's inhumanity to man has rarely been so terribly demonstrated.
