READ ME:

These uploads work just fine; if you are having problems it is on your end. That being said, if there does happen to be a problem with an upload, then fall back to the previous version and NICELY let me know... I'll fix it as soon as I can.


Please DO NOT post comments about new updates. I check daily for updates and if I haven't posted a new version yet, I'll get to it when I get to it. 


Please DO NOT make addon requests. The two most popular guides are Zygor and Dugi, and those are the ones that will be uploaded. (I'm working on Dugi currently.)
