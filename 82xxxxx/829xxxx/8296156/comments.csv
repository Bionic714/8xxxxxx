,vivatpb5776,2013-05-20T00:19Z,"Couple things:

- The audio is 2-channel. Even though it is a HDTV release, 6-channel audio is preferred for a 720p video file.
- This was ripped from British Sky Broadcasting, Ltd. How do I know this, there is a disclaimer in the beginning of the movie certifying the movie is suitable for viewers over 12 years old. There is also a written and verbal disclaimer stating that there is strong language and possible strobe effects.

While I appreciate the work the uploader did to provide this .torrent, I am going to try and find another version. If you are not a collector and just want to watch the movie as is, I am sure the quality is suitable."
