,Voortrekker,2013-03-26T12:21Z,Why was this video expanded to 1080p When it's mastered in 360p?
,quantumphysics,2013-04-24T03:12Z,"If anyone is reading this, just dl a different torrent. This film was originally mastered/redered in 360p, the 1080p HD thing is a gimmick. It will look the same, and is just a waste of bandwidth for ""1080p HD"" of a 360p film."
