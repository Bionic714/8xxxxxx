Twenty years ago, Jennie Garth moved from Urbana, Illinois to Los Angeles to pursue acting and promptly took the Hollywood world by storm as one of the breakout stars of the monster hit, Beverly Hills, 90210. Now Jennie is in search of a simpler life, as she moves her family to a seven-acre farm in the countryside of Central California, where she hopes to put the pressures of Hollywood aside and experience a new way of life. It's a move that will either give her the all-American lifestyle she has always dreamed of, or turn her family's world completely upside down.



Note -- The first episode I couldn't find in any format except .flv so I just converted it to a .mp4. Let me know if there are any issues and I can just upload the original .flv if so. I will be uploading the rest of the season this week. :)

Thank you to the original cappers of these files!
