The plot is similarly smorgasbordesque, cobbled together from the vaguely recalled secret origins of most superheroes: average joe, talented inventor, tragic loss, ancient prophecy, immortal intervention, pending apocalypse, flamboyant villain. Though it has all the parts of two or more superhero movies, it also lacks everything that makes superheroes interesting.
