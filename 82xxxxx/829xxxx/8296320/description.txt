Is there anything more satisfying than a well-made Asian dumpling? 

Plump pot stickers, spicy samosas, and tender b─üo (stuffed buns) are enjoyed by the million every day in dim sum restaurants, streetside stands, and private homes worldwide. Wrapped, rolled, or filled; steamed, fried, or bakedΓÇôAsian dumplings are also surprisingly easy to prepare, as Andrea Nguyen demonstrates in Asian Dumplings.
