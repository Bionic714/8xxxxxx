This Encode has been tested and doesn't work on Windows Media Player or quicktime however it does work on VLC, Potplayer, Media Player Classic
If you have playback issues try installing the newest version of http://www.filehippo.com/download_klite_mega_codec/
And Also works using MPC-HC ( http://www.codecguide.com/download_kl.htm ).
I reccommend using http://thumperdc.com/forum/advanced-video-playback-a-white-paper-t70686.html for best video playback.
if you wish to convert the movie from MKV format to MP4 follow this link or search Google 'MKV to MP4', it's a very easy process taking less than 5 minutes
