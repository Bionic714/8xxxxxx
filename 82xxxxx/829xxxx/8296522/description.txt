As a manager in FIFA Manager 13 you have complete control over the
management of a modern football club. In the game you are responsible for
the line-up, the tactics and training of your team, for signing the right
players and the extension of your club facilities and the stadium. The
special highlights in FIFA Manager 13 are the FIFA license, the FIFA 3D
engine, more than 40,000 licensed players, many of whom come with original
player pictures, the player manager and national team manager mode, the
Create-a-Club mode and the Match Prognosis Tool as well as a unique,
comprehensive editor.

Team dynamics:
* FIFA Manager 13 comes alive with a team analysis feature called
  "Team Matrix", as well as a hierarchy pyramid, which allows you to
  visualize which players are facing challenges in the team pecking order.
  In the Team Dynamics section you get an overview of team hierarchy,
  rivalry, personality clashes, personal goals, family relationships and
  much more.
* Your assistant manager helps you to analyse the team, and requesting a
  psychological profile of a player before signing him might help avoid
  future problems
* The new individual player objectives have a special role, and your team
  will be successful only with enough team leaders and everyone pulling in
  the same direction. From balancing player rivalries to spending enough
  time understanding and setting player expectations, FIFA Manager 13 will
  push you to perfect the art of team management.

Player objectives:
* Every player of the team has his personal objectives. Some want to become
  a first team regular, others want to play for their country
