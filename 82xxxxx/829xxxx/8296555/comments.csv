Reserve guard Jerryd Bayless led the Grizzlies with 30 points, one shy of his career high, to offset a 26-point effort by Paul Pierce of the Celtics, who were playing without injured starters Kevin Garnett and Courtney Lee. The Grizzlies led by 21 with 7:16 to go, but had to withstand a Celtics' rally that cut the margin to two points on three occasions in the game's final 20 seconds, the last at 108-106 with 8.3 seconds left.
