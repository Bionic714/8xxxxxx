Spider-Man travels to Counter-Earth to rescue an Terran shuttle crew trapped there and discovers a tyrannical & warped version of his world.

P.S. This series lasted for only 1 season, as they cancelled it due to then immense popularity of Pokemon. Shame! I really liked the plot in this one, not to mention his suit :D

Download, seed and enjoy :D
