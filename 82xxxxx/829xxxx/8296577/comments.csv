,Drakone,2013-03-26T22:36Z,"I'm downloading now. I'll try it and see if it works - and seed for a while (month or so) if it does.

Crossing my fingers. I'll let you guys know if it does work."
,Drakone,2013-03-26T22:57Z,"I just finished downloading and I can report that it works just fine on my laptop with integrated graphics.

Thanks so much. I'll be seeding the shit out of this."
,DCint,2013-03-31T23:19Z,"I got the crash dump error, but I managed to make the game work.

After extracting the game, you have to open the DirectXRedist folder (which is into the Scribblenauts folder) and look for a file called DXSETUP.exe - you install it, and that should make the game work :)

Hope it's helpful!"

,Shadowscythe1597,2013-04-22T00:06Z,"Hey I'm new here so I'm probably doing something wrong, but when i start up the game, and during the gameplay, I can't read anything. Every box where writing would normally be there are these weird indistinguishable characters, kinda look like letters, but at weird angles, on only cover part of the box. Please help me out. "
