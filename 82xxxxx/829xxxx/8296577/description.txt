Here is the Scribblenauts unlimited updated game, no one else is uploading it so I figure I would contribute to the community and be the first to upload it. 

just run the exe and extract it to your program files/ scribblenauts folder and run scribble.exe with admin rights. 



the keyboard in game is a bunch of weird characters just use your keyboard to right things rather than the mouse.

Remember to seed and contribute. lazy pirates who don't seed kill the world.
