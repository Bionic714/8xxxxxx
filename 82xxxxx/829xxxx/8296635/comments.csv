,dandobi,2013-03-24T21:49Z,"Hey.  I'm Dan Dobi (the director for the film). Would you mind possibly removing this torrent? I worked on this project for over a year and self funded it. I appreciate you trying to share this film, however I'm not Warner Bros or Universal, I'm just a dude trying to make a movie and support myself.  If you could remove this, that would be awesome.  for anyone interested in getting this for a cheap price and support an Indie Film, you can purchase the film in FULL HD at http://www.chill.com/pleasesubscribe

Thank you

- Dan Dobi"

,Thepieman,2013-03-25T02:47Z,Douchenozzle you put more effort into begging than you did into describing your movie. Ill pay to see you anally abuse your mom.
,Tectonic.,2013-03-28T00:20Z," I had $10 to last me the rest of the week so I thought I'd come and see if someone had shared this. Then I saw your comment Dan and I couldn't do it. Now I have $2, Thanks for all the hard work on this project! The film provides such an interesting insight.
Well worth the $7.99 at the link Dan provided…
this torrent is Ghost Rider anyway… lol"
