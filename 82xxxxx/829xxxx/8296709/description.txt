Here Is Lena DunhamΓÇÖs $3.7 Million Book Proposal [UPDATE]
 (by John Cook)

Rich girl Lena Dunham sold a book of "frank and funny advice on everything from sex to eating to traveling to work" to Random House for $3.7 million in October on the strength of an illustrated 66-page proposal. Here it is, weighing in at $56,000 or so per page.

Dunham, a 26-year-old described by Random House as "a rare literary talent," proposed to structure the book as an advice tome in the tradition of Helen Gurley Brown's Having It All. To judge by the proposalΓÇöwhich has been described elsewhere but is published here for the first timeΓÇöit's more of an invitation to get lost in the mind of a girl who is lost in her own mind. It's basically literary lifecasting: Fully 13% of the proposal's pages are devoted to reproducing a diary Dunham kept of what she ate in 2010. And she intends to devote an as-yet-unwritten chapter to "a collection of emails that screw the pooch, jump the gun, and terrify men." Also, Dunham thinks she has the "beginnings of a FUPA (fat upper pussy area)" and wants to write about that, in her book of advice for women.
