,Ymerdrengen,2013-03-28T02:15Z,"Well, it actually wasn't half bad in my opinion. I agree that the plot wasn't mind blowing (I can't even remember what happened) but the movie was fine for killing some time in front of the TV. Would never have paid to see it in a theater, though. And I would never buy it on disc."
,deathsfeet,2013-03-28T03:23Z,"A/V 9 (nobody gets a 10)

Just another espionage type movie, with a broken family in the midst of it all. Nothing special, but watchable. The serious issue is continuity. There's scene jumps where they really don't waste a second to explain why things are suddenly happening. And there's a few things that fall together just a little too conveniently. "

Thx to 3Li for the up, and all seeders, leechers, and everyone who rated/commented/reviewed. All appreciated.

Will seed"
