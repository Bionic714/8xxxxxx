This short black-and-white film shows eerie scenes of a downtown without people. The effect is disturbing. The camera shoots familiar urban scenes, without a soul in sight: streets empty, buildings empty, yet everywhere there is evidence of recent life and activity. At the end of the film we learn what has happened. 

 23 Skidoo is a 1964 short experimental black and white film by Julian Biggs, produced by the National Film Board of Canada. Its central images are "eerie" and "disturbing" scenes of downtown Montreal devoid of people.

 In 1965 the film was nominated for a BAFTA Award for "Best Short Film", and was also nominated for a UN Award. It won "Special Mention" in the international competition at the Cracow Film Festival that year.
