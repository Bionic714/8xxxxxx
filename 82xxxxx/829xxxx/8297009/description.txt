This is a PDF file of the source to the first UNIX kernel developed, as well as a shell to run on it. The code is written in PDP-11 assembler; thus, you'll need a PDP-11 emulator and compiler to get it running. OCR might not work on this, so be prepared to type many, MANY lines of code by hand into your favorite text editor for compilation.

Of course, if you're just interested in ancient (comparativly [no, I'm not a dictionary] speaking) computer history, then there's no need to worry about copying out every line in the file unless you want something more readable, as some of the sections are somewhat... light on the ink/scan (fading due to age is a possible cause).

And hey, I've made 3 torrents! 3! A happy day for me! :D
