,99jay88,2013-03-25T02:19Z,Is this the live preview from today?
,kenbo111,2013-03-25T02:47Z,@99jay88 Do you not even read the descriptions before asking stupid questions??
,99jay88,2013-03-25T03:17Z,I read the description. Just asking for verification if it's the real thing.
,99jay88,2013-03-25T05:43Z,"Finally downloaded. Yep, it's the real thing. Thanks to the uploader!"
,ma3potter,2013-03-25T16:37Z,"Can someone please re-encode this? I've tried to play it on WDLIVE, XBOX, WINDOWS MEDIA PLAYER, PS3 and my LAPTOP with no luck. Some applications say its corrupt, others have sound but just a black screen. 

I'm honestly surprised no one else has uploaded this. It seems when ever something is released there is 100 versions of the same thing. I can't find this file anywhere else on the web! A RARE THING IN THE TORRENT WORLD! "

Download VLC media player and try, also get a codec pack or x264 codec.

And find out how to reencode it yourself and upload it if you think that'll add something nice. "

,2nyte,2013-03-27T09:53Z,"Can someone please upload an MP4 version of this file... I know someone already asked, but I've tried converting the file myself and I've downloaded a shit load of software that does nothing...

Please, please someone upload a MP4 of this or tell me how to do it properly. When I tried to converted it, it was jumping and out of sync and just went crazy"
,pr0xZen,2013-06-01T04:41Z,"I've tried pretty much everything I could think of, and every player I've got including VLC. On 2 different computers and my media player. Could anyone tell me what is the issue with this file/encode? Ir whats ""unusual"", so I can rr-encode correctly."
