Notes: First off, not a very good CAM this time around. Dark scenes are very dark
and movie quality is not that great but it will have to do for now for a first
source. There a slight head on the bottome left corner, but doesnt hurt the movie
at all. Did what we can with the source files and cut video up in parts for dark
scene to brighten them up more but there only so much you can do. Audio CAM is
decent, clean it up a bit. Our rating V5 A5

Got nothing good to say, dont download it
