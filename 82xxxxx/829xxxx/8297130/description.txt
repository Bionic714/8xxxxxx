All you will have to do is push play, close your eyes, relax, and listen to one of the eight "Paraliminal" sessions featured during the Ultimate You Mindfest.

It is really that simple. Just think of what you want, and drift into a peaceful world of relaxing music, nature sounds, and words. Your mind will immediately ΓÇô and gently ΓÇô begin learning how to serve you best.

When you listen with stereo headphones, you will hear a voice in each ear speaking to different parts of your brain so that you learn on a very deep level how to do things differently ΓÇô more successfully ΓÇô in your life.

Special "Holosync" audio tones from Centerpointe Research Institute are embedded in the recordings so that you automatically enter the ideal brain state for relaxation and learning, making the Paraliminal experience even more effective than ever.

Paraliminals are indeed unusual, and you will find them safe, quite pleasurable, and very effective as over 600,000 people already know.
