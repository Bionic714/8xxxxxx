The best, most regularly overlooked version of this classical masterpiece. The Latin "words" are depicted in orchestral sonata movements, inspiring the awe and reverence appropriate to the subject.

Translated into English, the seven statements are:

1) Father forgive them, for they know not what they do

2) Today you will be with me in Paradise

3) Woman, behold your son, and you, behold thy mother

4) My God, my God, why have you forsaken me

5) I thirst

6) It is finished

7) Father, into thy hands I commit my spirit
