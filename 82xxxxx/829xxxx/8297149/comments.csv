--------------------------

A new three-part series of Foyle's War set in the Cold War era starts at 9.00pm on ITV tonight. As Foyle returns from a stay in the USA, MI5 agents persuade him to go to their London HQ immediately. Foyle is told that a Soviet spy network called the Eternity Ring is at large in the capital and could involve the distinguished nuclear physicist Professor Michael Fraser. Foyle isn't sure why he has been involved until the deputy head of MI5 explains that his former assistant Samantha is working as Fraser's secretary and could be acting as a go-between with the Russians. Foyle is shocked that MI5 are suggesting that Sam could be a traitor to her country.
