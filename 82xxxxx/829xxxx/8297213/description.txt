Owls is an emo indie rock band from Chicago, Illinois, active from 2001-2002, and now again in 2012. The band is composed of the original lineup of seminal experimental emo indie band Cap'n Jazz soon after its second breakup (the first came in 1995); Cap'n Jazz guitarist Davey von Bohlen, who played in the band's second incarnation, had gone on to found influential emo band The Promise Ring and did not participate in Owls. The band's lineup consisted of brothers Tim Kinsella and Mike Kinsella (on vocals and drums), along with guitarist Victor Villareal and bassist Sam Zurick. Tim Kinsella and Zurick have also played together in Joan of Arc and Make Believe, and Villareal and Zurick have played together in the instrumental-rock Ghosts and Vodka.

The band dissolved in 2002. Mike Kinsella left to concentrate on his solo project, Owen. He was replaced by Ryan Rapsys.

Owls recently reunited and began rehearsing in March 2012.
