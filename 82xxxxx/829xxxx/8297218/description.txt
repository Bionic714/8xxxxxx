Selling the Iraq war: Experts knew the intel was faulty. Why didnΓÇÖt they blow the whistle?

As the country marks the tenth anniversary of the U.S. invasion of Iraq, a nagging question lingers: Why didnΓÇÖt those in the U.S governmentΓÇöwho knew the truthΓÇöspeak out about the phony intelligence being used by the Bush White House to justify the invasion of Iraq? Yellowcake uranium from Africa? Aluminum tubes for a nuclear weapons program? Connections between al Qaeda and Saddam? Throughout the U.S. intelligence community, some officials knew that theseΓÇôand other assertions used to make the case for warΓÇôwere based on the sketchiest of intelligence, wrong-headed assumptions and fraudulent claims. Yet those officials didnΓÇÖt go public, their doubts recorded only in dissents buried deep inside a classified National Intelligence Estimate that never saw the light of day. In these excerpts from interviews conducted for ΓÇ£Hubris,ΓÇ¥ some of the principals explain why so many remained silent about issues that were so important.

Mark Rossini was a former FBI counter-terrorism agent assigned to the unit that specialized in al Qaeda. In 2001, he was detailed to the CIA Counter-Terrorism Center where he was tasked with analyzing a Czech intelligence report that 9/11 hijacker Mohammed Atta had met with an  Iraqi intelligence officer in PragueΓÇôa meeting that Vice President Dick Cheney said on Meet the Press was ΓÇ£pretty well confirmed.ΓÇ¥ Rossini quickly helped debunk the report and, he says in Hubris, was aghast that Cheney was giving it credence. ΓÇ£In hindsight, I do wish that me or somebody else did say, ΓÇÿwait a second, this is totally wrong.ΓÇÖΓÇ¥
