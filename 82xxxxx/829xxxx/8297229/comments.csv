,AweDRay,2013-03-25T10:23Z,"To all of those telling others to SEED, do be smart and understand that there is barely no one seeding because they're still trying to download the thing from the source. If 500+ leechers are trying to download from one source (that is the uploader), it would take a bloody long time to complete. Wait for a realistic amount of time, until some people have completed the download so they can seed for the rest of us. 

Also, don't be a dick and not seed after you're done. About 80% of you press ""Stop"" once your download reaches 100%. Dicks."

,Aoishiro,2013-03-25T18:05Z,"For those wandering, this only half a game (don't know whether it's wings of liberty or heart of the swarm). So for the initial installation (not offline crack) you have to download another 7+ GB from blizzard server. My question is, why can't you (FLT) provide the full game 14 GB?

What i'm afraid of is this ---> ""Since parts of this  solution  requires  online  activity  and
 updating the game we can't promise  that  this  solution  will  work  with
 future updates."" ---> Fairlight scene group quote.

What if blizzard people notice there's a sudden spike on their server bandwith and realize that someone manage to crack their game and decide to make just a little update, then this offline crack wouldn't be possible anymore, no? "

,sokol(CRO),2013-03-26T22:26Z,"ok guys i got it to work after 3 hours of messing around. if you had installed (or tried to install) any starcraft II game (even the wings of liberty or you failed with heart of the swarm), you'll need to uninstall it, but with a program that clears everything that could have been left (registry, leftoverfiles etc.). I used revo uninstall pro (torrent it) and installed my wings of liberty first (and patched it). then i installed this game following the instructions (i had 2 or 3 errors in the process beacuse of which i had to restart the install but in the end i succeeded, just keep trying, it worked for me). let the game update itself (you can skip step 1), go to steps 2-4 and don't open the game via the fairlight launcher, open it with the sc2switcher found in your game directory in a file called support. type in the mail and play offline (at least it worked for me). i hope i helped, ENJOY!

,teshia,2013-03-27T03:38Z,"Okay, so I was having problems with this crack as well.  I got it working the first time like lots of people and then found that after I saved a game, exited, and came back a few hours later, it started asking me for a password.  Some people said that if you ran through the FLT steps again, it would solve the problem.  Didn't work for me.  Some said if you blocked the Blizzard updaters from your firewall it would work.  Not for me.

For people who are getting the password issue and can't resolve it, there's a very very simple solution.  Open your Windows Control Panel, click on Network and Internet, then Network and Sharing Center, then Change Adapter Settings.  This will show you all you network cards in your computer.  The ones that have red ""X""s on you can ignore.  The one that doesn't is probably your connection to the internet.  Right-click on it and select Disable.  This will cut your computer off from the internet.  You can also just unplug your ethernet connection from the back of the computer if you're not using wireless.  The moment you have no internet connection, it goes right back to the bit where it says ""Connecting to streaming server..."" before the game starts.  I noticed that part went away when I was getting the password requests.  Totally playable after that."

3. Start the game and leave it to the servers patched to v2.0.6 (When the game is finished you will see the progress goes from red through yellow, green and get to be 100% of the window). Press Play izchakvate game to run in and out of the game when you load without touching anything!

I have search everywhere, there's no offline update 2.0.6 for english/global version (which is this torrent), only the english/us version offline update is available. On the bright side, you can resume the update download anytime you like. And yes, you have to download all the 6GB update that is the wings of liberty campaign. 

The good news is after this whole update nightmare, you can back up your 13GB Starcraft II folder. If you have to reinstall windows, you can just copy the starcraft II folder back and it will work without any reinstallation needed. Your save game is in you document folder though."
,tarzanscousin,2013-03-28T05:44Z,"If anyone is having trouble with the game asking for a password after the initial setup working, you need to manually block the other sc2.exe file which is located at ""C:program files (x86)starcraft iiversionsbase24944sc2.exe"".

,vaulthorn,2013-03-28T15:30Z,"Hi there

So From beginning I had a problem with installation but after few tries installation moved from this bloody 06%, so after one hour I had game installed not just optimal but for 100% (game is up to date) and Play button was yellow... so I have closed starcraft and used five step program from FLT ... I did everything step by step(I even checked windows firewall and blocked everything manually)... after that I've started the game and clicked cancel when game was trying to connect to streaming server and I've got info about this 100% thing... So after reading 8 sites of comments I've made some conclusion.

I've got original Starcraft 2 (WOL) Installed in different folder.
I've got AMD CPU (PHENOM II) 
It may be a problem with windows 7 x64 ? 

Probably one of these three things is a reason why this release is not working properly..."
,Super51,2013-03-28T16:51Z,"For all you fuckers who doesn't get this shit to work! I had all the problems stated here, ""100% downloaded game; can't play offline, starter edition..."". Just follow this steps. I tried this in 3 pcs and it works! 

DO THIS, later you can suck my balls:

1- Download this shit, some smart guy did it, you can suck his balls too
http://depositfiles.org/files/cb2104dkv

2- Unistall Starcraft II, delete any remaining folder

3- Execute the Snifys Loader and JUST click the START OVER, it will delete any registry shit or whatever, hit ok.

4- Check your firewall, if there's any Blizzard, Battlenet and StarcraftII.exe in the exception list, REMOVE THEM ALL, NOT JUST BLOCK. If you have another firewall besides windows firewall, do that shit too

5- Reboot the junk you call computer.

6- Mount the FLT iso and install, as administrator if possible. Install in a diferent path like ""C:Program Files (x86)SC2"". Click on ""I've already activated""

7- The installer will connect to internet and download the 6gb again, wait until 100% have been downloaded. DO NOT CLOSE THE WINDOW.

8- Hit PLAY, look at all that Blizzard shit and hit escape, DO NOT CLICK ANYTHING ELSE, just quit the game. It's stupid but HAS to be done.

9- Execute fairlight shit flt-sc2hots.exe as admin. Step 2 ""block SC2.exe"" doesn't work here, so MANUALY go to your firewall and BLOCK Battlenet, Blizzard and StarcraftII.exe. 

10- Hit Step 3.

11- Hit Step 4.

12- Go to the installation folder ""StarCraft IISupport"" and create a shortcut in the desktop for the ""SC2Switcher.exe""

13- Hit Step 5. Now, BEFORE you click the orange play button, CHECK YOU FIREWALL AGAIN, apparentely sometimes, a new StarcraftII.exe is created there , like ""StarcraftII(2)(3)(4).exe"". If everything is blocked, hit the orange play button.

14- Type flt@trash-mail.com and connect. Click on ""Play offline"". There you have.

15- Do Step 13 the next 2 or 3 times you enter the game THROUGH ""flt-sc2hots.exe"", forget the SC2switcher, just leave it there. This probably will prevent the game working on a day and the next one not.

Maybe some of the steps doens't need to be done, but I got this working by this way and I don't want to take any risk and download 6gb again. This FLT crack seems to be very frail and the sensation is that will break apart at any time.

If it works, you'll have a debt with my balls.

1. The files inside can be opened using winrar. Just double click one of them then choose winrar as the default programe to open these.
2.Mount the iso you extracted with daemon tools or something similar.
3.The downloading of the data wont start immediately after you mounted the iso. It will go slow to a certain point then it will show you that it is downloading
4. After the download just hit play and exit again.

6.Hit every step then make the shortcut to the desktop as flt states in the instructions AND

On STEP 2 along with the ""StarCraft II.exe"" that is located inside the %gamedir% you have to block the ""SC2.exe"" that is located inside %gamedir%VersionsBase24944

If you don't do it the game will still be able to connect to battle.net

,Shokyto,2013-03-29T23:00Z,"WORKS! :D

- Just unpplug your internet cable when STEP 1 has finish.
- DO NOT HIT STEP:2 on the craker and DO NOT use windows default firewall, use another instead and block it manually (i use COMODO free firewall and works great).
- Block in your firewall the ""StarCraft II.exe"" that is located inside the %gamedir% ... also you have to block the ""SC2.exe"" that is located inside %gamedir%VersionsBase24944 (TY RRRt!)
- DO NOT HIT STEP:5 Instead exit the cracker with Alt+F4 and open directly SupportSC2Switcher.exe (also make a shortcut for further use)
- ENJOY :)"

,kingchuck,2013-03-30T04:11Z,"I HAD THE SAME PROBLEMS... (all these instructions don't solve)
THE ONLY way that this game is working for me:

1 -  Install
2 - Update to last version
3 - LOGIN WITH A VALID ACCOUNT AND EXIT THE GAME 
3 - DOWNGRADE TO THE VERSION 2.0.5
4 - PASTING the save files of other person in my saved games folder (located in documents usually)
5 - Block the Internet connection and activated firewall to block all conections of the SC2.
6 - USING THE Snify's Starcraft II Loader  0.9b and aplying the RAZOR 1911 KEYGEN, allowing my acess with MY OWN ACCOUNT.
7 - ACESS THE GAME WITH THE FILE  LOCALIZATED IN THE SUPPORT PASTE (SC2Switcher.exe)
8 - Login with the your own account and acess to play offline is granted.

PS: IF THE ICON TO THE HEART OF THE SWARM IS GONE, DON'T WORRY. 

9 - Go to campaign and select LOAD GAME
10 - Find the heart of the swarm save
11 - Load it, and then go to menu and exit game, choosing to replay mission from start.

Congrats, you can now play the campaign of Heart of the Swarm. o/

,fupa16,2013-03-30T06:30Z,"I would highly advise against any advice kingchuck gives. Adding your actual account information into an illegitimate copy of the game, or through 3rd person launchers is almost a guarantee to get your account information stolen.

I'm just posting this as a public advisory because that's exactly how my WoW account was hacked when WoL came out. There was a key logger that steals your account info whenever you enter it into the login screen.

A prudent decision would be to just wait for an official crackfix from RZR or FTL or whoever if you're unable to get it to work. ANY solution that involves putting your actual Bnet info into the game is a HIGHLY risky solution, and HIGHLY unadvisable."

,Dufox,2013-03-30T18:17Z,"works like a charm. win 8 64bit

1.mount the game, install it with the setup starcraft II.exe like you would any other game (no need to go into the fairlight folder yet)

2.the install turns into a download
i had no previous starcraft data on my computer, my download was 6gb

3. wait until the download is completely finished (yes you have to wait until the download is at 100%)

4. press play, (DO NOT ATTEMPT TO CRACK THE GAME, simply press play when your download is finished)

5. the game will load, now simply press quit at the bottom left of the title screen. (BE ON THE SAFE SIDE, DO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING BUT THE QUIT BUTTON)

6. open the fairlight folder that is in the iso with the installer and run ""flt-sc2hots.exe"" as administrator (you can run it strait off the iso, DO NOT try to copy it to your game folder like a normal crack before you run it)

7. press step 1, a box pops up. press ok nothing will happen.

8. press step 2, a box pops up. press ok
IMPORTANT -WHY RISK IT?, TURN YOUR INTERNET OFF UNTIL YOU ARE ABLE TO PLAY THE GAME.

9. if your internet is still on slap yourself for inviting potential problems^^ now press step 3, a box pops up. press ok (it takes a bit longer for the box to pop up on step 3)

10. press step 4, a box pops up. press ok.

11. press step 5, it will exit the white box and bring up the launcher, press play.

12. copy and paste "" flt@trash-mail.com "" without the "" "" into the login screen (you can paste it by holding CTR and pressing V) click remember me then press ok. 

13. alt tab out of game and go to your installed starcraft game folder in program files, then go to the support folder and create a shortcut of ""SupportSC2Switcher.exe""

14. enjoy game.

15. use SupportSC2Switcher.exe to start game from now on."

if your using SupportSC2Switcher.exe to start the game and have 3 starcraft2's blocked in your firewall the game has no chance to update.

the only other way im aware of something in a game being changed is if your anti virus finds a false positive and deletes/quarantines it.

Do this to make the game work....
Step 1 : Goto battlenet.com and create a new account...
Step 2 : Temporarily  allow the game to connect to the internet (do so by disabling the firewall )
Step 3 : Login the game using this new account
Step 4 : Create your Character. Then you can exit the game...
Note:  There the game will give a nag screen telling about the features you will unlock if you buy the game; when you press exit.
Step 5 : Open the flt unlocker.... There click the steps 3 and 4...(ie...copy files and generate licence)
Step 6 : Enable your firewall now. Open the game. Login with the NEW account (not the flttrash@mail.com )
Step 7 : Play the Game....!
Note: you must have blocked both “Starcraft II.exe” in the game folder as well as the SC2.exe file in Versions Base24944 folder
Plz : this was tested by me and it works ....also only go for this method if the original method fails and gives this message” Must have logged on atleast once and must have created atleast one SC2 Character”.

,Hitman47222,2013-04-04T23:34Z,Okay i managed to bypass those 2 errors and it SEEMS to be installing now.. But its stuck on 0.0% for a while now... Is this normal? Is it downloading something?
,Hitman47222,2013-04-04T23:36Z,EDIT : Okay its not stuck at 0.0% but its moving seriously slow.... So far just 0.1%.. Is not just installing the game? Or is it downloading the 6GB content as well??
,Hitman47222,2013-04-04T23:50Z,Okay .. This is seriously one of the weirdest installers ever... According to task manager . HDD is being used up to 99% and network 0%... Yet i am just 0.3% done after like 30 mins. Is it downloading or installing? I need to know.. Please.
,Hitman47222,2013-04-05T00:26Z,Okay now its actually downloading and showing the percentage and whatnot.. So all is good. Last question tho .. Should i run Fairlightflt-sc2shots.exe while the download is running or after its done?
,Fapfaps,2013-04-05T02:47Z,so can you have wings of liberty installed too or do you have to uninstall it?

,Raphael_5,2013-04-05T07:01Z,"Ok, I did everything advised by Super51 on 03-28-2013 and I was able to play the game for a couple of days..

Then, I got the error message: ¨Unable to download game data from Blizzard's servers. To play offline, 100% of game data must already be downloaded. Please check your internet connection and try again later.¨

So I tried a couple of things, and then I got bored and uninstalled everything and followed the awesome guide again..

Now when I try to enter the game and log to flt@trash-mail.com, it asks for a password which I don´t know and can´t figure put why is asking it now

And if I disable Internet as some advise, it tells me that SCII: Starter Edition can´t be played in offline mode

Any ideas? Thanks in advance!"
,Raphael_5,2013-04-05T07:07Z,"Right now I have the version 2.07, I'm guessing that might be the issue..

,leffe_83,2013-04-09T23:09Z,"
hi guys and girls, for the people who downloaded FLT version of Heart of the swarm.

This is the way I got the Heart of the swarm to work with a little tinkering :).

I already had Wings of liberty downloaded with crack but had to reinstall it without cracking it and updating it..

For example:
http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/5719719/Starcraft.2.Wings.of.Liberty-LiBERTY

I installed the FLT version before the reloaded was uploaded.

http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8297229/StarCraft_II_Heart_of_the_Swarm-FLT

The I updated it with the updater it was alittle over 2,5 Gb.

Then I used the reloaded cracker and it didnt work so I downloaded the US downgrade:

http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8258564/Starcraft_2_Heart_of_the_Swarm_US_Downgrade_to_2.0.5

And then search them up in the Starcraft folder and replaced them (made a copy of them first just incase)

so:

1: install Wings of liberty without crack and update.
2: Install ( FLT version of Heart of the swarm).
3: update fully. Like 2,5-3 Gb for me.
4: crack with reloaded crack.
http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8342146/StarCraft.II.Heart.of.the.Swarm.Proper.Crack.Only-RELOADED_

(4b:) I also tried the snify loader also but dont know it did anything in the long hal.
http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8318297/Starcraft_II_Heart_Of_The_Swarm_Loader_Only

5: Downgrade the installation with 2.0.5, because the newer ones dont work, yet.

6: run the crack again just incase.


After all this my Starcraft worked :).

cheers.."

Grab the nfo and read it:

I downloaded all 13 gigs of that release, but I probably could've just followed their NFO instead since it uses the same crack.  Someone give it a shot and see.  But uninstall your game with Revo Unistaller and clear all the registry entries first, or it definitely won't work.  "

,viwp88,2013-04-27T03:15Z,"So I got the game to install and I followed the directions just to be told that ” Must have logged on atleast once and must have created atleast one SC2 Character”

So I followed Arun1121 instructions

To all those people to whom the game is giving the error...""Must have logged on atleast once and must have created atleast one SC2 Character"" after following all the instructions correctly....
Do this to make the game work....
Step 1 : Goto battlenet.com and create a new account...
Step 2 : Temporarily allow the game to connect to the internet (do so by disabling the firewall )
Step 3 : Login the game using this new account
Step 4 : Create your Character. Then you can exit the game...
Note: There the game will give a nag screen telling about the features you will unlock if you buy the game; when you press exit.
Step 5 : Open the flt unlocker.... There click the steps 3 and 4...(ie...copy files and generate licence)
Step 6 : Enable your firewall now. Open the game. Login with the NEW account (not the flttrash@mail.com )
Step 7 : Play the Game....!
Note: you must have blocked both “Starcraft II.exe” in the game folder as well as the SC2.exe file in Versions Base24944 folder
Plz : this was tested by me and it works ....also only go for this method if the original method fails and gives this message” Must have logged on atleast once and must have created atleast one SC2 Character”.
also If u do the above correctly.. the nag screen will disappear... Indicating that the game is unlocked 

Then I went to play and got the same message again ” Must have logged on atleast once and must have created atleast one SC2 Character”.

what now? does anyone have suggestions?"
,viwp88,2013-04-27T05:01Z,"Well I fixed the problem some how by using a combo of  Arun1121 and DarkAmel instructions.

So I followed Arun1121's instructions and still kept getting the message "" Must have logged on atleast once and must have created atleast one SC2 Character"". So then I went and followed the instructions again, making sure to use steps 3 and 4 on the ftl. Then I set the time back on my computer to 4/24/13. which that did not work either so then I tired to log in using the default login email ""flt@trash-mail.com"". Then it worked.

Hopefully this will help someone else out. Good luck and enjoy guys."

Read everything below the 5th note after ""PLAY!"". Hope this is enough - if you can't figure out how to continue, you're probably better off buying it right away!"
,Hestabbedbasil,2013-05-18T18:59Z,"Hey, can anyone give me a hand with this? I'm running an uncracked WoL. I installed that first, then tried to install heart of the swarm from this torrent. The installation seems to go fine, it downloads a couple gigs of stuff from the launcher. I hit play afterwards, it tries to connect to the streaming server, then gives me this message:

'Unable to prepare game data for offline play. To play offline you must first run Starcraft II once while connected to the internet. Please check your internet connection and try again.'

I tried disabling any blocks for the program in the firewall, uninstalling and reinstalling, rebooting, running the FLT files, and running the reloaded crack. 

Is there anything I can do about this? THANKS!!!!"
,IAmTorrenter,2013-06-09T02:33Z,"Hestabbedbasil you are supposed to let hee game update, open it UNBLOCKED from firewalls for he first time, then close it and THEN you block it.

Anyways. is this still working for anyone else who recently installed? i followed all instructions properly, but when i try to play offline it tells me i need to verify my account first and that it must have atleast one HOTS character.. 

i think this game has been patched now?"
,IAmTorrenter,2013-06-09T02:35Z,"mm yes... this has been patched.
no longer useful.
DOES NOT WORK"
