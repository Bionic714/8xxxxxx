,Viciously,2013-03-25T02:59Z,It's 25. Don't worry.
,Ruttagger,2013-03-25T03:28Z,"Awesome, I have a fear that one day every HD source will broadcast in 50 frames.  It would be the end of my life.  Thanks"
,Mikkel32,2013-03-25T05:45Z,"Hey buddy, will you also upload this race with 50fps..? Thanks :-)"
,AmpolGold,2013-03-25T07:21Z,Magic Footy.
,rc90029,2013-03-25T07:40Z,"Thank You footy.  

@Ruttagger & Viciously  WTF is wrong with you guys, 50fps looks so much smother and natural. In fact all action sports should be shot in 50 or even 60 fps.    

I just hope footy will release the 50 fps version.  
"
,TT7LB7,2013-03-25T09:07Z,"Once again, thank you footy! always a pleasure.

I have to agree with rc90029, the 50 fps uploads you do are beautiful to watch so i hope you pull through again and upload this race (as well as the rest of the season) in 50 fps."
