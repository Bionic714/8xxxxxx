,udp2,2013-03-27T18:14Z,"INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS IN THIS PACKAGE ARE TERRIBLE -- HERE'S HOW TO DO IT:

1) Run the executable
2) Select the ""WinRAR.... Setup"", which launches the normal WinRAR installer
3) Install WinRAR as usual... when done, make sure WinRAR is shut down
4) Now go back and click the ""WinRAR... KeyReg"" (skip all the automated crack stuff), which pops up a window with a registration file
5) Find the install location on your system, probably C:Program FilesWinRAR
6) Drag the file that you see from step 4 into the location from step 5
7) You're done, shut everything down

BIG THANK YOU to the uploader & packager"
