Awesome TV show! Way better than ""The Walking Dead"".
Thank you!"
,Otik,2013-04-07T23:55Z,"thanks, any chance of seeing part 3 in HD?!"
,TaylorBA,2013-04-13T20:04Z,"I would also like to see the third in 720p.

I hope this is not another series (Great British Bake Off) where I download the first few in 720p and then can only finish it in SD. My OCD or eyes can not put up with that"
