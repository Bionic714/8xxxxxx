Sorry guyz!"
,az25,2013-03-25T02:01Z,"thanks! best game of the tourney by far, though I'm watching FGCU right now dominate! they'll probably move on, oh man, it's about time this tourney had some excitement and scoring."
,UncleO,2013-03-25T02:06Z,"@nepotu, I love you for your NCAA stuff, and since my system is so narrowband, would/could you please do the (Duke?) games in minimum density?  By the time I get a first half DLed, there's been 2-3 more games by the teams involved!"
,cardsman04,2013-03-25T03:25Z,Is there any way you could please post the Florida Gulf Coast vs San Diego St game?...I was at work and missed the game. Thanks!
[V],Nepotu,2013-03-25T04:02Z,I said that many times. All the NCAA games found are already up. The game size is the ripper's call.
