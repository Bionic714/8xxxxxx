Through the Bible Study in 1 John 3 - Taught by Brett Meador
Join us in 1 John 3 and study how God loves us. Take on the mark of a Christian as we read through practical ways we are called to love one another. We look to Jesus for help, growing in our understanding of GodΓÇÖs agape love, unconditional, for us.
