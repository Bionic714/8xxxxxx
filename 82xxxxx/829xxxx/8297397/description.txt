"Scorpion King Hunter"

The race continues in Botswana where the teams 
hunt for scorpions. Meanwhile, Chuck and Wynona 
confront Joey and Meghan for using the U-Turn 
against them.

Rules are unclear if a show such as this would
be 'reality' or 'competitive reality'. Due to
this being a literal race involving lots of
running and high motion we went with 
'competitive'.

Evolve... or die.
Enjoy :)
