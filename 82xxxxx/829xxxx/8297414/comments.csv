,derav,2013-03-25T23:52Z,STFmaryville by any chance do you have Man Things' appearances on Adventure into Fear?? 
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-26T13:56Z,"gpack3, derav, i don't have any of those. if you're looking for a lot of great scans of classic marvel issues, i highly recommend that you Google ""H33t"" -- on the H33t site, search for ""marvel chronology""... PeteThePIPster has compiled everything published from 1939-2011, ordered by cover dates."
