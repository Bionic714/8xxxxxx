This fills a request for derav. Ka-Zar appearances in the 1970s include a reprint series, KA-ZAR #1-3, a "split-book" feature (with Dr. Doom!) in ASTONISHING TALES, #1-20 a.k.a. all the Ka-Zar issues, and the almost-immediate follow-up series, KA-ZAR: LORD OF THE HIDDEN JUNGLE #1-20. Please seed and share!  --STFmaryville

From Wikipedia:

Kevin Plunder, the 2nd Ka-Zar started as a similar character to the 1st, but reminiscent of both Tarzan and of writer-artist Joe Kubert's 1950s caveman character, Tor. Created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in The X-Men #10 (March 1965), he lives in the dinosaur-populated Savage Land, which was hidden beneath Antarctica by extraterrestrials.

Originally written as a primitive and belligerent savage who spoke in broken English, Ka-Zar later became more articulate and civilized, although he retained a certain degree of distrust toward civilization and was generally wary of outside visitors to the Savage Land. Kevin Plunder refers to himself as the "Lord of the Savage Land", a phrase others have adopted, but this is not a formal title.

He has had four self-titled series (1970ΓÇô1971; three issues, mostly reprints), 1974-1977 (20 issues) by Mike Friedrich, 1981-1984 (Ka-Zar the Savage, 34 issues) by Bruce Jones and Mike Carlin, and 1997-1998 (20 issues) written by Mark Waid.
