,QuaidBass,2013-03-25T02:27Z,This is a retail copy pulled from Amazon and converted to .epub.
,amoeba,2013-03-26T02:31Z,This is a great copy. It doesn't have the weird spacing issues that BlackTar's torrent does. I will seed this for quite some time.
,QuaidBass,2013-03-26T05:46Z,BlackTar seems to be using an earlier PDF version with poor formatting. This is an Amazon retail copy I got from a site I frequent.
,jesbro,2013-03-29T06:24Z,If you have them can you please upload the Halo Cryptum and Primordium epub's as well? Would really like to have the whole trilogy.
