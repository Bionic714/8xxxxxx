Big thanks to Doc! I got a bunch of his collections.

These make for a great screen saver or a wallpaper slide show.


+ There are 311 sets that I have and I will get them all out to you. They number from 432 to 860.
+ Yes there are ones missing. I most likely did not DL them if I thought the woman was unattractive, the theme was stupid or too similar to another set.
+ You will also notice that the women have jumped from site to site. So you will see some of the same women in different sets.



From this point, forward, I will be uploading only 5 a day. This way we can all insure that these are seeded well. I would up this number IF it is apparent that 5 a day is too few. So once EACH tracker hits 10 seeds, on an upload, I will start another if I am awake and paying attention.

Thanks to Who-He-iZ for bringing the seeding issue to my attention. Original conversation can be seen at
