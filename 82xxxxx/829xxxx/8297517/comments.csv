,taylise,2013-03-25T09:13Z,English subtitles for an English speaking TV show waldorfx? WTF!!??
,ch4mer,2013-03-25T11:00Z,"@taylise : Yes and it helps a lot of people around the world to translate it...
The english accent is not easy to understand for a lot of people even if they can ready it perfectly... So the subtitles are really helpful and appreciated ! Thx Waldorfx ;)"

,TheOriginalCoda,2013-03-25T16:09Z,"And then there's people like me, perfect hearing and perfect understanding of English but for the life of me I don't understand why I keep missing words, therefore titles are a must.  I get my titles from podnapisi dot net."
