When you get started on your First Comics ul project, will you be ul Steven Grant's Whisper series?  Don't think that ever saw the light of TPB anywhere?"

Yes, Whisper will be uploaded. I've obtained every issue except #37 and I've been at 89.4% on that one for almost two weeks now. Five minutes with a seed and I'd be golden!

The First Comics Upload Project (FCUP, ha!) should begin this week."
