why is this file so HUGE?""

1.3 gigs isn't 'HUGE' it's 720p you fucking idiot and it's the same size of EVERY episode of walking dead immerse puts out. It's for those of us who won't be watching it on a shitty little 8 inch netbook screen and actually want a bit of quality in their videos."
,bobisnowhere,2013-03-25T23:22Z,"Also people who spoil things deserve to be sent to a special hell where they get to start watching something amazing, get into it and then have it spoiled completely for eternity. FUCK. YOU."
,phuckstic,2013-03-26T00:02Z,this show went from good to straight up shit....who cares...end this show now
,delfinus,2013-03-26T01:00Z,Epic zombie drama for history of mankind.
,jasonbay13,2013-03-26T01:42Z,"bobisnowhere at 2013-03-25 23:21 CET: 
agreeing with you there. the file size could be cut to below 1 gig with very little (if any) quality loss, but would quadrouple encode time.
or use a crf around 18-22 (after 24 it becomes noticeable)"
,Flameass,2013-03-26T15:12Z,Am I the only one who are bothered by the high ambient sound when nobody is speaking? So many mkv's have this problem. I have no idea what they're doing when encoding the videos but their doing something wrong.
