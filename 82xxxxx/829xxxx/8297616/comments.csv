"
,{me},2013-05-09T01:17Z,"@ sati it was episode 15 you are referring to and it was hardly a prediction but he ran his car through the marathon killing countless people; then was interviewed about it and said, ""I'll tell you Bob [Costas] I just got in my car and drove it."" Hardly a prediction but what a coincidence!

Thanks eztv!
Happy Pirating!"
