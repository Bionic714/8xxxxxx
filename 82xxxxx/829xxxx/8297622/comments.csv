,kyatsuka,2013-04-08T22:10Z,"Dude its because they separated season 1 into season 1 and 2 on Wikipedia.

Where as we have been using the order that combines these listings. Wikipedia used to use this same order and TV groups have been using it for as long as i can remember. No point changing the names of all those torrents and files just because the ""official"" order was changed."
