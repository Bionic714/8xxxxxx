One of the most beautiful of all Japanese films, Conflagration is based on a best-selling novel by Yukio Mishima. ΓÇ£Ichikawa was MishimaΓÇÖs favorite director,ΓÇ¥ James Quandt notes, ΓÇ£and from this adaptation, it is easy to see why.ΓÇ¥ Mishima based his story on an actual incident, the burning of KyotoΓÇÖs celebrated Golden Pavilion. A young man, Mizoguchi (Raizo Ichikawa), disgusted by his motherΓÇÖs promiscuity and disenchanted with his weak father, becomes a Buddhist acolyte. But the obsessive, stuttering youth finds his temple school to be sullied by sexual hypocrisy. In despair, he deliberately sets fire to the temple, symbol of pure beauty, and a national treasure, causing a conflagration that for him is a holocaust. IchikawaΓÇÖs interpretation of MishimaΓÇÖs already highly conceptual novel was profoundly original, using Toshiro MayuzumiΓÇÖs avant-garde music and Kazuo MiyagawaΓÇÖs ΓÇ£architectonicΓÇ¥ widescreen cinematography to chilling effect. Donald Richie noted, ΓÇ£The textures captured in black and white were-even for Japan-beyond comparison.ΓÇ¥ ΓÇöBAM/PFA
