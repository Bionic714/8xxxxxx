[V],thetorrentlord,2013-03-25T18:38Z,"You are welcome. I try not to make sporting events too compressed because of all the action. This is about as small as I would make an event that was 1:35 min in length. A typical upload here of a TV show of 42 min. is about 1 GB and this is longer than 2 shows, therefore to keep the quality level at least the same it should be over 2GB. If you were talking about a movie of this length at 720p you would see a typical 4-5GB size."
