Creepy Zone is a very short horror survival game through a surreal and nightmarish world. Enter if you dare. The door where you couldn't get through unless crouching...

This a very, very short game, but an interesting one. This game is freeware, but alot of people don't know about it. Freeware version doesn't come with Xpadder & profiles, this torrent does.

Enjoy this trippy, neat little horror game.
