Plot:
Kenai, still a bear and Koda strongly believe that they do not need any girl, just each other.
Kenai dreams of Nita, a girl he had met and saved when he was very young. After giving her an
amulet, and promising they'd be friends forever, Nita leaves for her home and Kenai never sees
her again. We then see Nita, now grown up, beautiful and preparing her her wedding. However,
the ancestors are not pleased, as Nita is already tied to Kenai. The only way for Nita to break
their bond and be happily married is to journey to the very place where Kenai gave her the
amulet and burn it together. As Kenai, Nita and Koda journey to the place together, Koda cannot
help but feel worried that Kenai might abandon him altogether for Nita. Will Nita break the bond
she shares with Kenai and marry another? Will Koda be abandoned by his big brother?
