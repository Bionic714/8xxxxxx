,SwedishMeatball,2013-03-25T06:38Z,thanks again hard. I was wondering if you were going to do the Cup race this week. Hope all is well with you.....
,crwlngkngsnk,2013-03-25T08:01Z,Thank you so much. I always work weekends with my new job and with Internet my only media source I was afraid all might be lost. Now I just have to avoid NASCAR news until I can get the race. I will seed every one to at LEAST 3.0. Thanks again.
,steveosterberg,2013-03-25T13:39Z,CARG! You are an absolute gem for doing this.  If you look in the past there are almost no torrents of NASCAR races.  It costs a ridiculous amount to get cable in Canada (yay monopolies) so you can watch a race.  If you keep posting I'll do my bit.  Thank you so much.
