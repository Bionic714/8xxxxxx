,rocksbury,2013-03-26T01:53Z,"Sorry about that, type a bunch of 000s.
Any code will work.
Thanks for reminding me.
Btw how fast was the download?"
,WyldeLightning,2013-03-26T15:54Z,"Aren't the numbers supposed to be a certain amount in any registration code? I did try a bunch of 1's, but it errored out."
,WyldeLightning,2013-03-26T15:56Z,"PS - hard for me to say how fast it was, since my provider throttles bandwidth and my downloads never exceed 350kbps regardless of where I get them...."
,rocksbury,2013-03-26T21:43Z,"the code doesnt have to be more than one digit
literally typing 1 then enter will complete it. 
You can also play online with this crack.
Enjoy"
,WyldeLightning,2013-03-27T21:30Z,"Ok, so this is the scoop. You can try to do the reg code, but you'll get a ""The game could not be activated, please try again in a few minutes."" Evidently, the servers are overloaded, according to the OOTP Forums and many people have to contact support to have the game activated. Which means a TPB version won't be eligible. I made 60 tries of it as the forum advises to keep trying. No success."
,rocksbury,2013-03-27T23:49Z,"I just completely uninstalled my previous OOTP to make sure this download and crack work.
After you install ootp opens automatically, and asks you to purchase.
I then close the program and copy and replace the ootp.exe with the one found in the folder named Crack.
i then reopened the program entered 1 as my registration code and pressed enter.
No confirmation or message pops up but all of the menus are now unlocked. I can play any game mode including online.
This is using a windows 7 custom built Pc.
I can upload another crack with a earlier patch but im not really sure why people are having issues."
,WyldeLightning,2013-04-05T03:19Z,"Ok, crack can be stubborn on copy/paste on Windows 8. Even though I copied the crack 3 times, it didn't actually do. I finally did it, and Eureka! It works now. 100X better than Sports Mogul. Way more involved, better interface. Great upload, thanks, Rocksbury."
,rocksbury,2013-04-10T05:02Z,"Ya no problem, it can happen when you leave it seeding as well. Im just waiting for a copy of FHM
its just the hockey version of ootp which looks INTENSE."
,boondocksaint78,2013-04-12T08:44Z,"Works just fine. But I was hoping this file was a newer version than the one I already have, which it isn't. This is version 13.1 for those who are wondering. "
,danny981,2013-05-09T22:03Z,Rocksbury.. PLEASE upload Franchise Hockey Manager Beta + crack..PLEAZZ :(
,rocksbury,2013-05-15T23:08Z,"I dont expect a crack for FHM until it is fully released.
I purchased a copy to support the devs.
I wouldnt recommend it yet the game is nothing like ootp its barebones atm."
