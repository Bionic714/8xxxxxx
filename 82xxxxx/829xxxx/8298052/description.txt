Maka is a Meister and Soul is her Weapon. As students at the Grim ReaperΓÇÖs Death Weapon Meister Academy, their study habits couldnΓÇÖt be more different. But in battle against the supernatural forces of evil, theyΓÇÖre a freakinΓÇÖ lethal team.

ThatΓÇÖs when Soul transforms ΓÇô literally ΓÇô into a razor-sharp scythe, and every defeated wicked soul he sucks down makes him more deadly. ThatΓÇÖs when Maka unleashes the merciless slayer within, wielding her partner and dropping monsters. Seriously. Monsters. Like the witches, werewolves, and zombies that lurk in the shadows and feed on the souls of the innocent. Every freakish ghoul Maka and Soul take out strengthens their bond, and fighting alongside their fellow Meister/Weapon classmates, Maka and Soul are the worldΓÇÖs last line of defense against evil.
