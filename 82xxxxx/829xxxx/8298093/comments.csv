every time they think they got something, the show hops to the commercial, comes back from commercials and nothing. I can't believe Animal Planet has a show like this, absolutely horrible!!

Im wondering if they refute the 100 bigfoot DNA research done as well.. as on c2cam in recent UFO bindle they say most bigfoot hunters reject the paper as they dont believe its a human line but a ape line LOL

drips if thats the case cos humans are bloody chimps/aps they have 98 percent dna match to use .. I suspect maybe religion in their heads is to blame.. with all that BS about god and made in his image

humans got the short end of the rope id thats the case.. as a big hairy human can run fast and break trees with its hands.. I wouldnt want to meet one face to face it prob kill you

which then it maybe them kidnapping kids and some adults in the national forests too.. they are strong and powerful enough to do it. (see strange disappearances talk on c2cam I uploaded on that story)"
