A whole CD devoted to the traditional folk music of Shropshire, where John has lived since 1973. Four instrumental tracks and eleven songs featuring voice and squeezebox, with some big harmonies on a few choruses provided by John and Sally Kirkpatrick. Quite a few tracks are from the repertoire of Ray Driscoll; and the album title is from a phrase of the Passion carol Under the Leaves of Life.
