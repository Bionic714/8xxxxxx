Beans on Toast is back with his new album ΓÇÿFishing For A Thank YouΓÇÿ. His everyday observations offer a gentle and, as ever, peaceful wake up callΓÇªand maybe hope, as he provides his often stark but witty insights into Middle England. This isnΓÇÖt the sort of artist the Daily Mail are going to get excited about, a good thing in our books.

He turns many stones within these 12 tracks from scraping away the surface behind the fighting at the petrol pumps during the fuel shortages (The Dry War) to the continual press onslaught of what will kill us (The Children of Bedford). Not forgetting of course the preoccupation of phones which were once used to talk to people:
The recession of course gets a mentionΓÇª for which he steps up to the mark with a countryfied ΓÇÿRainydaysΓÇÿΓÇªthe one we were meant to save up for. All these topics may sound depressingΓÇªthey can beΓÇªbut Beans on Toast somehow manages to inject the right dosage of humour and upbeat wit to make it all feel betterΓÇªthis is great therapy for the tiny cogs in a big world.

We love him for his honesty which strides the political to the social including having kids with PappajaY. Needless to say he balances it all off with some positive vibes with ΓÇÿLifeΓÇÿΓÇªand a fitting closing tale ΓÇªΓÇÖFreedom RoadΓÇÿΓÇªabout a trip to Latvia where he ended up on the road.
