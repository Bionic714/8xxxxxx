Any idea?
"
,TUHD,2013-03-25T14:04Z,"@Zemsta: It's I assume the same error that I encountered with the downgrade-trick - there's something within the Bulldozer-chip (the base of the FX-series) that cancels out the generated key in tandem with the SCII-program. Dunno the exact reason, but that's it.
I assume it has something to do how programs code in the key into the registry. Just speculation here though. Only thing I know AMD FX+SCII key generation doesn't work."
,TUHD,2013-03-25T14:06Z,@WarE9: Go away you survey fucker

,D_A7,2013-03-25T17:21Z,Ok so install moved after 10 minutes. Now i get this http://prntscr.com/xsezn . Whats the point in downloading 8gb game when installer downloads another 6gb ?
,TUHD,2013-03-25T18:37Z,"DA_7, you haven't blocked the .exe from installing updates I guess... hence the huge update."
,kiason,2013-03-25T18:43Z,so close to being finished ^_^
,Djuxy,2013-03-25T18:55Z,"Ez if you around respond pls.Does dl of files have to be finished in total (not just until its playable, and Play button gets highlighted) to proceed with steps 2 trough 5.And if so, Is it possible that blizz already updated new patch that updates game further then ver. 2.0.6.25180.
For the rest of the ppl here,yes it starts off slow but speed depends on your net and Pc coz at the same time while the files are dl`ed, are installed as well. "
,Crusader2010,2013-03-25T18:57Z,"After a google search, there was a similar error in 2011:

If you are getting the Starter Edition offline error, it could mean you haven't logged in successfully in the last 30 days. They have a piracy protection system that enables offline mode for 30 days upon each successful logon. 

No idea how to bypass it though."
,D_A7,2013-03-25T19:26Z,Finally installed the game following all the steps in instruction and now i get this http://i.imgur.com/1hfbivL.png :(
,Djuxy,2013-03-25T20:17Z,"All done.So nwm. what i asked.For others answer is yes.You got to w8 till all files are downloaded.
It all works fine, just carefully read instructions.
Main prob. i guess for all ppl having the http://i.imgur.com/1hfbivL.png issue, is that you closed the window after all files where downloaded, and you got the info: ""The Game Is Up to Date""
The instructions clearly states not to close it.
If you done this, just uninstalling or deleting files will not help.You have to clear reg data as well.
So when the download of all files is finished, PRESS The ""PLAY"" Button!!! (To clarify, the installation and the download of all files is Step1 of the instructions) 
Then you Run ""Fairlightflt-sc2hots.exe"" on the DVD and proceed with steps 2 trough 5."
,tambu90,2013-03-25T20:24Z,thanks men
,Isti,2013-03-25T20:28Z,It says that all data files (patches?) must be downloaded to play in offline mode... I assume this method is no longer good?
,kiason,2013-03-25T20:57Z,installing now ^_^
,kiason,2013-03-25T21:02Z,11
,kiason,2013-03-25T21:20Z,do you let the game update after it installs?
,iwinz3,2013-03-25T22:32Z,"@djuxy no it is a SC2 AMD error mate, it does it with my legit version as well lol its on the blizzard forums, for some reason AMD rigs are erasing the liscence every time it tries to connect,"
,tribal86,2013-03-25T22:54Z,how to clear reg data??? :P
,kiason,2013-03-25T23:09Z,i hope i do this right but im curious if you run Fairlightflt-sc2hots.exe after you update and before you follow rest of instructions
,Zemsta,2013-03-25T23:15Z,"TEH BUG:
With certain CPUs like Bulldozers, the licence key you register with Step4 button will be automatically deleted upon pressing the ""CONNECT"" button ingame, therefore client will be reverted back to ""Starter Edition"".

,kiason,2013-03-25T23:41Z,this may sound dumb so please forgive me but can someone help me with the instructions...im not sure what it means when it says hit step 3 button and step two button..can someone simplify it please ^_^
,D_A7,2013-03-26T00:06Z,"The moment you run the game it deletes applied license from FLT and you cant play in offline mode :( ( i checked registry before and after )
It would be great if someone can confirm if this is only AMD cpu related bug.

My specs are:

MSI GTS 450
8gb 1866Mhz ddr3 ram
MSI 970a-g46

,Djuxy,2013-03-26T00:30Z,"@kiason: Fairlightflt-sc2hots.exe is an auto execute prog. that you run after all the game data is dl`ed.
it actually have buttons on it labelled:
          Step1
          Step2... and so on till 5
So all you need to do after, is literally "" hit step 3 button and step two button.."" as you said.
As for AMD issue with users.
I Run:
AMD Phenom(tm) II X2 550 Procesor 3.10 GHz
GIGABITE MA 770 UD-3 board

,Djuxy,2013-03-26T00:42Z,"O yea` 1 thing that popes in to mind.
Are you running the game from shortcut on desk coz if you are dont.
Make, as suggested in instructions shortcut to SC2Switcher.exe that is located in Installation folder of the game.That should be

for win7 users.
Hope all this info helps guys.Coz this is an excellent game.

Disable your network card in your control panel or just unplug your ethernet cable from the back of your computer.  If you don't have any internet connection, it'll stop asking for a password and start letting you play in Offline Mode again.  Just enable your network card again when you're done playing to go back online."

Do this to make the game work....
Step 1 : Goto battlenet.com and create a new account...
Step 2 : Temporarily  allow the game to connect to the internet (do so by disabling the firewall )
Step 3 : Login the game using this new account
Step 4 : Create your Character. Then you can exit the game...
Note:  There the game will give a nag screen telling about the features you will unlock if you buy the game; when you press exit.
Step 5 : Open the flt unlocker.... There click the steps 3 and 4...(ie...copy files and generate licence)
Step 6 : Enable your firewall now. Open the game. Login with the NEW account (not the flttrash@mail.com )
Step 7 : Play the Game....!
Note: you must have blocked both “Starcraft II.exe” in the game folder as well as the SC2.exe file in Versions Base24944 folder

,electro cute,2013-04-06T02:17Z,"FOR EVERYONE THAT HAS ""NOT 100% DOWNLOADED PROBLEM""

here's how i've fixed it.

1. i followed every step in the installer and got this message.
2. i've went in the firewall and deleted every protocol associated to starcraft 2
3. i've blocked a sc2.exe located in your install directory - versions - base 24944. i've blcoked it through advanced settings - ingoing rules and advanced settings - outgoing rules.
4. i deleted starcraft 2 folder located in documents directory - not the directory with install but directory that has saves in it.
5. IT WORKED!!!!

hi guys and girls, for the people who downloaded FLT version of Heart of the swarm.

This is the way I got the Heart of the swarm to work with a little tinkering :).

I already had Wings of liberty downloaded with crack but had to reinstall it without cracking it and updating it..

For example:
http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/5719719/Starcraft.2.Wings.of.Liberty-LiBERTY

I installed the FLT version before the reloaded was uploaded.

http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8297229/StarCraft_II_Heart_of_the_Swarm-FLT

The I updated it with the updater it was alittle over 2,5 Gb.

Then I used the reloaded cracker and it didnt work so I downloaded the US downgrade:

http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8258564/Starcraft_2_Heart_of_the_Swarm_US_Downgrade_to_2.0.5

And then search them up in the Starcraft folder and replaced them (made a copy of them first just incase)

so:

1: install Wings of liberty without crack and update.
2: Install ( FLT version of Heart of the swarm).
3: update fully. Like 2,5-3 Gb for me.
4: crack with reloaded crack.
http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8342146/StarCraft.II.Heart.of.the.Swarm.Proper.Crack.Only-RELOADED_

(4b:) I also tried the snify loader also but dont know it did anything in the long hal.

5: Downgrade the installation with 2.0.5, because the newer ones dont work, yet.

6: run the crack again just incase.


After all this my Starcraft worked :).

cheers.."

,mourafall,2013-04-14T03:43Z,"hey guys, for those whith the error ""Unable to download game data from Blizzard's servers. To play offline, 100% of game data must already be downloaded. Please check your internet connection and try again late"", here it goes:

after installing the game, you must run it at last for one time before you block it in the firewall.

So, install it, run it, and THEN you execute the fairlight program.

today it's 13/04/2013 and still running perfect."
,Th3ArtOfRu1n,2013-04-14T06:24Z,"Been spending the majority of the weekend trying to get this running---used all the cracks I could find on the site, followed all instructions, etc...nothing worked. Thanks for uploading, but I think I'll be waiting for Razor1911 to put something out--hopefully a working crack."
,nawnwa,2013-04-16T08:52Z,"I dloaded flt release from a diff site,, but the method still WORKS on 2.0,.7 ,, installed it today ."
,rakin08,2013-04-22T07:32Z,its 100% working for me....just follow the instruction given.... and you have to download the full data during installation...nice torrent..nice speed....nice game...hope enjoy it..tnx
,karkar88,2013-04-25T18:27Z,why downgrade all this steps works on 2.7 patch just follow all the instruction... well u must log in first then exit then follow the step... 
,BKcrims,2013-05-20T17:35Z,"Hi there! registered just to say thanks and its WORKING in 2.0.8 Update!!!

As long as you FOLLOWED each step then you're good to go :) Excellent torrent.

btw, does anyone know how to play custom games?b'cause mine keeps saying u have to upgrade D:"
,badhomaks,2013-05-29T02:16Z,"It works fine with the given instructions. TO extract .001, open it with winrar and extract the iso inside it. The patching takes a while because it's dl'ing 6gb of data. Everything else is straightforward. Thanks FLT!"
