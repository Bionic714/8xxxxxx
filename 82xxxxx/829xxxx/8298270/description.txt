 DISCLAIMER: Since parts of this  solution  requires  online  activity  and

 HOW TO INSTALL

 1) Unrar, burn or mount ISO
 2) Install the game while online, when  asked  to  Activate  select  "I've
 Already Activated"


 HOW TO TO PLAY OFFLINE

 Run Fairlightflt-sc2hots.exe on the DVD, it must run with  administrator
 priviledges. (you may need to temporarily disable any anti-virus  software
 or similar you have)


 STEP 1: UPDATE STARCRAFT 2 TO LATEST VERSION

 This step you must execute manually.

 Let the game update to latest version (2.0.6.25180 at the time of  writing
 this)

 Once game is fully updated (you will see the message 'Game is up to date')
 you  must  press  'Play'  and  enter  the  game  once  to   complete   the
 installation, if you forget to do this you WONT be able  to  play  offline
 afterwards. You dont need to do anything once inside,  just  look  at  the
 impressive Battle.net login prompt  and  then  exit  by  pressing  Escape.


 STEP 2: BLOCK SC2.EXE IN WINDOWS FIREWALL

 We assume you are using Windows Firewall as your firewall  and  of  course
 also that it is Enabled.

 Hit the Step2-button and the tool will block  'SC2.exe'  in  your  Windows
 Firewall.


 STEP 3: COPY FILES

 Hit the Step3-button and wait for a little while,  this  will  deploy  the
 battle.net cache files.


 STEP 4: GENERATE LICENSE

 Hit the Step4-button and your license is generated  and  deployed  to  the
 windows registry.


 STEP 5: PLAY!

 Hit the Step5-button and the tool will launch StarCraft 2  and  then  shut
 itself down.

 When you see the 'Connecting  to  streaming  server...'  dialog  just  hit
 'Cancel',    this    happens    because    of    the    firewall    block.

 Once inside enter 'flt@trash-mail.com' as your BATTLE.NET ACCOUNT NAME and
 hit 'CONNECT'.

 The connection will fail but you will be offered to 'PLAY OFFLINE'.

 NOTE:
 Once you have everything running you  should  consider  making  a  desktop
 shortcut directtly to SupportSC2Switcher.exe, this seems to  bypass  the
 Blizzard Launcher and should keep  you  safe  from  potential  fun-ruining
 future updates.
