remove tvteam skull!

I know this user posts a lot, but often makes mistake and is very lazy.  Lately been posting fake torrents, albeit accidently, but a user like this a torrent hits the rss then the fake has 10,000 seeds.

But truly I dont give two fucks about this group and I like free shit.  But a skull should be for those who wish to better TPB community, not lazy fucks..."
