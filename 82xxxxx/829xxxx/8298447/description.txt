DESCRIPTION:

The strongest energy always wins. Thats it! Thats the key to moving from your current situation, any situation, into the life youve always wanted.
Yes! Energy presents the power of the Energy Equation, which you can employ to attract abundance to all areas of your life. This formula can help you lead your life to achieve financial freedom; center your actions around a spiritual core of certainty and confidence; up-shift your attitude into consistent optimism; commit to engage with others at the highest, most satisfying levels; create the enterprise youve always envisioned; and dust off your dreams.
Best-selling author and entrepreneurial speaker Loral Langemeier developed this simple and straightforward methodology, which is revealed explicitly in these pages, because she needed it herself. Knocked to her knees more than a few times on her true-grit journey from farm girl to multimillionaire, she knows what its like to hit obstacles hard. Yet despite the blows, she still stands, and she still delivers.
So, if you want to learn how to tap into infinite, productive energy; extreme optimism; and calming, clarifying spirituality to improve your life in any way . . . this is the book for you!
Harness the Energy Equation and supercharge your life!
