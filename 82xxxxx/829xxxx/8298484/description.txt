Lost Worlds: Series 1
Dig into the sands of time with this exploration into lost civilizations. Scientists, archaeologists, and historians alike search for evidence of cities that may have forever been lost to time. Some are ancient while some are surprisingly recent. Journey back to Jerusalem when Christ walked through its streets. Explore the mysteries of the Knights Templar. See Egypt when Ramses ruled and discover what it looked like in Braveheart's Scotland. Recent cities include Winston Churchill's secret bunkers and a Welthauptstadt Germania that Hitler envisioned. Graphic recreations and location shots bring these cities to life.




6)  Athens Ancient Supercity 
In the 5th century BC, one man led his city to greatness and paved the way for western civilization. The city was Athens and Pericles was not a king or prince, but an elected ruler. He directed the most costly and ambitious construction campaign undertaken in the western world--creating a model city of temples, houses, market places, civic buildings, and a highly innovative sanitation system. Lost Worlds reveals that, despite Athens' extraordinary influence and importance, Pericles' plan led to his--and the city's--downfall. It took 30 years to build, but it was laid low in one generation by war and disease. Now, 2,500 years later, Lost Worlds restores Athens to its former glory--the first senate house, the terrifying power of the Greek navy, and one of the world's most advanced water systems. The program also details the magnificence of the Parthenon--often hailed as the most perfect building ever completed.
