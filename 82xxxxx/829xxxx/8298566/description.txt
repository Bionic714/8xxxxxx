Ep: See Ya Later, Alligator
 
Released Mar 24, 2013
 
The fashion bug lures Scott to Gator Country where he goes on a real-life alligator hunt for the perfect pair of loafers. See Lord Disick hit it off with some country folk! Meanwhile, it's a battle between fashion sense and common sense in Miami this week! A mention on a blog's Worst Dressed list sends Kim into a shopping frenzy. Can Kourtney talk some sense into her shopaholic sister before it costs Kim a shot at her L.A. dream home?
