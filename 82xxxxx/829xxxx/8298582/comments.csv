- Bitrate < 2000 (default DVD quality is > 5000)

- Audio quality @ 95 kbps (default CD quality is  1411 kbps)



Even a YouTube video have better quality than these ""BrRips""...

Don't know why YIFY don't show this info on description, maybe they are ashamed of this dramatically murder quality to get low file sizes.


IF YOU LOOKING FOR A GOOD QUALITY GO TO OTHER UPLOADER."
,Riffrock,2013-03-28T01:13Z,"^Dipshit^ All of YIFY's uploads are more than enough quality for the average person who watches movies. I dont think his target market is 
ragenerds with some type of an irrational sense of entitlement."

I downloaded both YIFY versions (1080 & 720). The audio is TERRIBLE. I had it at 3x the volume of a normal film, and we still could barely make out what was being said half the time -- and could not make it out at all the other half. What a shame.

The video is not fantastic, either. There are many scenes where faces look like claymation. A larger file size is worth it."
