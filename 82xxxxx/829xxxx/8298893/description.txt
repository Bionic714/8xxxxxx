When his mother, who has sheltered him his entire 40 years, dies, Elling, a sensitive, would-be poet, is sent to live in a state institution. After two years, the man is released along with his friend Kjell Bjarne and is provided with a state-funded apartment with the hope they will be able to live on their own.

Through a friendship born of desperate dependence, the skittish Elling and the boisterous, would-be lover of women, Kjell Bjarne, discover they can not only survive on the outside, they can thrive. But as their courage grows, they find ways to cope with society, striking up the most peculiar friendships in the most unlikely places.
