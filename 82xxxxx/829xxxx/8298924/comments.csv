,Proteus11,2013-03-26T07:22Z,"Stuck att 99,9% for a good long while here."
,coppersam,2013-03-26T13:51Z,"Looks like there's one file that isn't downloading, but the 99% complete file should be functional -- all the files should open regardless. "
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-26T15:10Z,"yeah there were 2 files that nobody could complete, one was the torrent file (which doesn't have to be in the directory you torrent) but the other was the 1940s wonder woman comic.

good news is, the download completed this morning! i'll help seed, too."
