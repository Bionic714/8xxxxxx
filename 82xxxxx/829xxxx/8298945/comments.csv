,FlankerB1,2013-03-25T23:28Z,"Yes most of city interactive games are bad, but I like their Sniper Ghost Warrior series. Those two games are a rare alternative to ""SPRAY AND PRAY"" type of FPS games. By spray I meant spray bullets. That's why I dislike what ubisoft did to their R6 and GR franchise."
,FlankerB1,2013-03-25T23:29Z,I believe this version crashes after few missions (I tried the skidrow version a few years ago).
