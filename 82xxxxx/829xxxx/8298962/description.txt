Not one of my favorite Lynch films... but one of my all-time favorite soundtrack compilations. The reason? Sheer ballsy ecelecticism. Who else would follow up Strauss with speed metal? Or big band music with rockabilly? Yet it somehow all makes sense, creating an almost indescribable atmosphere that's at once totally intense and totally cool. In a perfect world, radio would always sound like this: An uber-hip DJ picking songs not because they *sound* appropriate together... but because they *feel* appropriate together.
Worth mentioning are Chris Isaac's two contributions here, in my opinion among his best-ever songs. There's the hit "Wicked Game," of course, but "Big Blue Spanish Sky" drips mystery and melancholy in a pretty wonderful way. Longtime Lynch collaborator Angelo Badalamenti's requisite instrumental contributions seem to key off Isaac's vibe.
One drawback: you get Nicholas Cage singing not one, but two Elvis tunes. He's not as good as Elvis.
