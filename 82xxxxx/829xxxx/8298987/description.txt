This is one of the most cherished cd's I own. I usually put it on and listen to the last three songs before listening to the rest of the album. The rest of the soundtrack is terrific especially the instrumental theme track, "Blue Velvet" and the Twin Peaks-like music in "Lumberton, U.S.A.", the small town where Blue Velvet takes place in. I would have loved it if Bobby Vinton's original version of "Blue Velvet" were included which was the inspiration for the film and was the song in the opening sequence and Main Titles, but instead we get Isabella Rosselini's version when she sings at a nightclub. I liked Rosselini's version too but it was somehow cut short to only a minute long. The soundtrack is entirely instrumental until track #12. The strength of the cd really comes in full force at the end when Roy Orbison's "In Dreams" takes you back to the scene of the unforgettable lip-synching by Dean Stockwell. It's a classic Lynch moment. Following this is Ketty Lester's "Love Letters", an absolutely gorgeous slow song played when Jeffrey Beaumont finds the man with the missing ear killed in the apartment of madman Frank Booth. The soundtrack ends with Julee Cruise's "Mysteries Of Love," an ethereal dream-like love song played at the end of the film in the unforgettable scene when Dorothy Vallens becomes reunited with her long lost son.
