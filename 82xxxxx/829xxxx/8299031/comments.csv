Any chance of Anna Mercury 2 #1-3?

On a separate matter, I have a bunch of stuff that I may ul myself, but not sure how to convert JPEG files to CBR/CBZ.  When scanning, I have it set for JPEG.  Is there any manual ol that I can check into for this?"
,bgg1175,2013-03-25T15:10Z,"This story followed a great 12 issue run by Millar and Dodson which made a terrible idea and art look a million times worse. Its in the forgotten comica bin with Byrne's Chapter One. 
This is the worst Spider-Man story I've ever read.  "
[V],blackcanary,2013-03-25T16:19Z,"binderguy1, a CBR/CBZ is just a RAR/ZIP archive renamed.  So to create a CBR/CBZ, just rar or zip the images and then re-name it from .rar to .cbr or .zip to .cbz."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-25T16:27Z,"bgg1175, wow, that's saying something! how are you feeling with octo-spidey now?

binderguy1, i had seen your anna mercury 2 request and i've actually found #1-2 but so far i've struck out on #3 (unless you can read portugese!)

about .cbr, it is my (very limited) understanding that to create a .cbr, you just take your set of .jpgs and make them into a .rar file using WinRAR or other RAR program, while a .cbz is the same, just using WinZIP.

it's talked about briefly in the Novus Scanning Guide (you can find it here), but not in-depth.

anyway, hope that helps!"

,binderguy1,2013-03-25T17:02Z,"@blackcanary & STFmaryville:

Thanks guys for the info.  I'll give it a try and see how that goes.  I really didn't want to ul as pdf (seeing as how everybody hates pdfs!)."
,bgg1175,2013-03-26T04:09Z,"@STFmaryville I'm not knocking anyone for putting this up, but this particular storyline really irks me. The MK Spidey art went from a 10 with Dodson to a 0 with Billy Tan. Though some of the crossovers had better art, seeing Spider-Man destroyed by a 3rd rate nothing villain Morlun really ticked me off. 
This was one death and return that got no attention. 
Theres been very little great Spidey moments from Marvel since the days of McFarlane-Salicrup and Micheline. But this one wasnt just bad, to me it crapped all over the Spider-Man character. 

As for Dan Slutt's Spider-Ock, it probably sucks more but I'm not reading it, Ive torrented a couple of them and glanced at them to see if they were as bad as I thought. 
I unfortunately had a subscription to MK Spidey when the Other was released. "
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-26T13:44Z,"oh i hear ya bgg1175! thanks for replying. i wasn't reading spider-man at this point, having trailed off when he joined the avengers, so i didn't have the unfortunate experience of seeing the marvel knights series take its sharp decline. i actually enjoy the first 2 or 3 chapters of the other, david's scripts were good, especially the mj-peter friction. the weiringo and deodato art is very good, i feel. i actually liked the early straczynski-romita jr. work on amazing, but straczynski here is just off the rails ... morlun, just crap. and the chapters with art credited to that dumbass pat lee (maybe signing his work to someone else's?) = horrendous. overall i agree with you, this is very bad."
,degu2012,2013-03-27T01:48Z,"clone saga bad? it s arse gravy of the highest order tho, this stopped me rading spidey for years i'm only just catching up now. but they didn't learn from this and have drawn elements of it into the scarlet spider series which up until then had been quite good, they can't get it wrong a second time can they?"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-27T20:33Z,"degu2012, they might try!  ;-)"
,Torrenad000,2013-03-28T12:49Z,"It's true this story was an obvious waste of straczynskis talents, especially since spidey's first encounter with morlun i thought was a truly epic comic. Besides this and OMD his writing on asm was some of my favorite. Ill still take this over that octo-spidey crap that were being given right now. I hope the avengers kick the crap outta him."
