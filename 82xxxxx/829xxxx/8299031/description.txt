This is the 2012 digital edition of the 2006 hardcover collection. What a weird footnote to Spidey's adventures! (Most of the fallout from this crossover was wiped away by "One More Day.") All credit to G85-Empire for this release! Please seed and share with our friends here on TPB.  --STFmaryville
