By no means all the greatest early songs, this compilation does include her hits and well-known album tracks from the 1960s and early 1970s. It focuses on the later Vanguard years when she moved into pop and rock. Four Dylan tracks are included plus her greatest commercial success, The Band's The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down, a lilting melodious song about the civil war, her big hit from 1971.
Farewell Angelina from the album of the same name is another gem, and then there's the civil rights anthem We Shall Overcome. Other highlights include The Dangling Conversation (penned by Paul Simon), the bitter Love Is Just A Four Letter Word and the stirring There But For Fortune. Help Me Make It Through The Night and Let It Be must be two of the most covered compositions of all time and Baez renders them well.
The album concludes with the evocative Brand New Tennessee Waltz, one of the most memorable songs from her repertoire. The Vanguard years encompassed many other great classics not represented here, such as Ate Amanha, Kumbaya, Long Black Veil, Gospel Ship, Satisfied Mind, and the awesome Lady Mary. That aside, this is a valuable collection and ideal for those wishing to investigate the 1960s/70s work of this folk legend.
