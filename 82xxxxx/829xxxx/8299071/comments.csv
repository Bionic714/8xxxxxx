A=8,V=9

@crwildman. Really? English subtitles for an English language movie from England."
,CarlZeiss,2013-03-27T20:34Z,"@sunnyape I usually need subtitles for English movies too.  They have thick accents.  Clockwork Orange for instance...I don't know how anyone can watch that movie without subs,."
,cannabis1,2013-03-27T20:39Z,Thanx!!!
,Phatfish,2013-03-27T21:30Z,"A - Fine.

V - Ok. Not great.

M - Slightly weird and very annoying. It might be a lot of things but funny isn't one of them. It was as entertaining as watching paint dry."

It should be called NBUK"
,dubblue4,2013-03-28T15:42Z,thanks
,whnstn,2013-03-28T18:46Z,"Warning: All in our house had crazy dreams after watching this. 

Not normally a concern, this twisted little movie about the Natural Born Killers of England (NBUK) gave us all wild dreams; one girl ended up giving herself a black eye."
,henrywatts333,2013-03-30T16:34Z,"Fell asleep half way through.

Awful movie!"
,biggerisbetter34,2013-03-31T04:33Z,Anyone who calls this movie good must be a brit who is already dead inside.
,highlander888,2013-03-31T10:26Z,"Thanks for the upload!
Good quality rip.

The movie itself was pretty bad. Not funny.
Not a black comedy. 

Turn it off halfway through."
,vampzcore,2013-03-31T19:31Z,thanks!!
