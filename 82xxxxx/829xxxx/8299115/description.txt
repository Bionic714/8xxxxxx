Two brothers in their fourties are found dead in the forest. By their side lies a woman, very weak, but still alive.

When a policeman starts investigating what happened, the woman (Janne) tells the tragic, beautiful and lifelong love story of Janne and William, the youngest brother. A love story always disturbed by the older brother, Ruud, who hates his brother and through his whole life wanted to destroy him. Ruud blames William for his unhappy childhood and his lost love, and Janne is the woman between them, desired by both brothers.

Separated for years following the tragic death of their only child, Janne and William meet again. They move into an abandoned summerhouse by the river. When one day a Chinese baby girl is found floating down the river, they realize that they are once again being haunted by Ruud.
