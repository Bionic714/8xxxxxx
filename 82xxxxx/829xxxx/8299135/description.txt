Plot:
The teenage DJ is observing his neighbor Nebbercracker on the other side of their street in the
suburb that destroys tricycles of children that trespass his lawn. When DJ's parents travel on
the eve of Halloween and the abusive nanny Zee stays with him, he calls his clumsy best friend
Chowder to play basketball. But when the ball falls in Nebbercracker's lawn, the old man has a
siege, and soon they find that the house is a monster. Later the boys rescue the smart Jenny
from the house and the trio unsuccessfully tries to convince the babysitter, her boyfriend
Bones and two police officers that the haunted house is a monster, but nobody believes them.
The teenagers ask their video-game addicted acquaintance Skull how to destroy the house, and
they disclose its secret on the Halloween night.
