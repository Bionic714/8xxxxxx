Optical Illusions Brain Teasers for Everyone - Improve Your Child's Math Skills!

For Children Gifted In Math

Inspire and Engage Your Child's Mind

Parents, do you know that your child is gifted in math, yet are you having difficulty inspiring your obviously talented student to do more than just the problems presented in school? Fortunately, besides the old boring math problem worksheets given out in most traditional classrooms, there is an almost endless variety of ways that mathematics can be presented to unenthusiastic learners that will arouse their interest and make them want to dig deeper thus stretching and improving their minds.

Optical Illusions Brain Teasers for Everyone, created by our expert Mind Hurdles math professionals, is just such a book. You might ask how can a book filled with optical illusions help my child improve in math? The simple answer is that anyone, regardless of their age, is forced to begin to solve the illusion the moment their eyes see it. Optical illusions demand that the mind think. In fact, you cannot view one without using the brain.
