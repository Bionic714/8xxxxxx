,Zemsta,2013-03-25T17:25Z,"Still need a Crackfix!
The license key that FLT crack copies disappears from the Registry every single time when trying to ""Connect"" once inside the game.

-Tried to run flt-sc2hots.exe and SC2.exe on only one CPU core(0) but its still deleting the key continuously.

AMD A10 5800K "
,thcfreak666,2013-03-25T18:43Z,For German users. EPIC FAIL !!
,Crusader2010,2013-03-25T18:58Z,"After a google search, there was a similar error in 2011:

If you are getting the Starter Edition offline error, it could mean you haven't logged in successfully in the last 30 days. They have a piracy protection system that enables offline mode for 30 days upon each successful logon. 

No idea how to bypass it though."
,Zemsta,2013-03-25T23:16Z,"TEH BUG:
With certain CPUs like Bulldozers, the licence key you register with Step4 button will be automatically deleted upon pressing the ""CONNECT"" button, therefore client will be reverted back to ""Starter Edition"".

Need a hotfix!!"
,D_A7,2013-03-26T00:08Z,"The moment you run the game it deletes applied license from FLT and you cant play in offline mode :( ( i checked registry before and after )
It would be great if someone can confirm if this is only AMD cpu related bug.

My specs are:
AMD FX-6300
MSI GTS 450
8gb 1866Mhz ddr3 ram
MSI 970a-g46
500gb HDD"

,iwinz3,2013-03-26T10:08Z,"pisoy, you didnt follow the directions then, the crack works if you do it right, only bulldozer arch CPUs get the starter edition deal that needs a fix *amd FX series and such*"
,pisoY,2013-03-26T10:25Z,"I did everything by steps, multiple times.
It does delete license key."

,Arun1121,2013-04-01T12:01Z,"To all those people to whom the game is giving the error...""Must have logged on atleast once and must have created atleast one SC2 Character"" after following all the instructions correctly....
Do this to make the game work....
Step 1 : Goto battlenet.com and create a new account...
Step 2 : Temporarily  allow the game to connect to the internet (do so by disabling the firewall )
Step 3 : Login the game using this new account
Step 4 : Create your Character. Then you can exit the game...
Note:  There the game will give a nag screen telling about the features you will unlock if you buy the game; when you press exit.
Step 5 : Open the flt unlocker.... There click the steps 3 and 4...(ie...copy files and generate licence)
Step 6 : Enable your firewall now. Open the game. Login with the NEW account (not the flttrash@mail.com )
Step 7 : Play the Game....!
Note: you must have blocked both “Starcraft II.exe” in the game folder as well as the SC2.exe file in Versions Base24944 folder
Plz : this was tested by me and it works ....also only go for this method if the original method fails and gives this message” Must have logged on atleast once and must have created atleast one SC2 Character”."
,Arun1121,2013-04-01T12:06Z, If u do the above correctly.. the nag screen will disappear... Indicating that the game is unlocked
