,freenit01,2013-03-29T16:31Z,can i play this on the pc ??? and how ???
,nuneral,2013-03-30T00:59Z,"you can play roms on any emulator. i know there is a genesis plus for pc. may try that. the bin should work with any emulator, but the enhanced audio utilizes the sega/mega-cd add-on emulating both the sega-cd and the genesis to get the enhanced audio.
my suggestion: download genesis plus and this torrent and report your results."
