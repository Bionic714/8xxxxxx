These are what I consider the Sega CD games that are actually worth anyone's time. Mostly exclusives.

All games have had their mp3s converted to wav. which explains the larger file size. This is for Genplus GX compatability (and I think it allows for better audio quality?) so I can run these off my Wii and any other emulator I would assume. Cues made with SegaCueMaker. Everything runs perfectly as far as I can tell.
