Review:

 Martin Wheeler used to make the sweetest electro known to man (or machine), before focusing on video game design (full disclosure: this writer is a fan of his 'Go Robot' game).
 However, it appears that Vector Lovers is never too far from Wheeler's heart and on iPhonica he proves to be a master of electronic melody and harmony.
 Granted, the mood, particularly in the second half of the album is introspective, especially on the gloomy "Let's Go Home" and the serene "Final Wish", but iPhonica also shows that Wheeler is adept at making acid trax ("Kongaroid"); sensuous ambience ("Stargazing") and as "On Kastanienallee" so beautifully demonstrates, wide-eyed electro.
