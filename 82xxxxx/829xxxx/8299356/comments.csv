Don't think that I don't read what you guys post because I certainly do, and I appreciate all the support.  Makes me feel good to see how many people are being helped because that's really what this is about for me.

Just want to make a few things clear.  

My schedule has changed so that's why the shows haven't been up right away.  I was able to post them immediately for 3 years straight and then things changed.  But just know that anytime I have an opportunity to do it quickly I will use it like I've done today.   So rest assured that I'm not going anywhere.

Also people wondering about HTV and H101 should really join WDM.  We don't share that stuff here because it defeats the purpose of a private network.  The network is a safe haven and doesn't deal with torrents.  So you will have privacy and safety when indulging in the content.

TPB is only an advertising avenue for us and we limit it to the radio show because that's the big commodity and brings in the traffic.  So don't think that I'm leaving out the specialty content just to stiff you guys.   It's to keep things simple here so there's not too much attention on a public tracker.

You don't just get access to more torrents or anything like that.  We don't even use torrents on the network.  It's all archived content that is accessible at all times and dates back to 1985.   Both video and audio and it's distributed in a way that is exclusive to WDM.   You will have access to the show whether it's posted or not no matter where you are.  Tune in from work using your smartphone or stream/DL a HTV episode.   It's all there."

[V],wushdishmeen,2013-03-27T16:29Z,@powerslave - this must be on your end.  no audio issues here.
[V],wushdishmeen,2013-03-29T01:16Z,"@powerslave - The crackling is part of the actual Howard stern feed coming from his studio.   I hear it from the actual sirius feed replays.  The wrap up show is crystal clear because it's in a different studio.  Also H101 was airing old sirius shows and the feed was clear then too.

So Scott The Engineer is to blame.  Sorry man"
