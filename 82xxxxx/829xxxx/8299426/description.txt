2013 - THE YEAR IN CHRISTIAN MUSIC
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Another day, another torrent.  We're now up to our 10th bundle on the year, which is approximately 20 gigs of music.  And that accounts for a total of 279 releases for 2013.

A quick break down of this bundle for those interested.  Now I may be off on some of my genres, but I have these listed accordingly.  So if you're looking for Indie / Folk then check out All Delighted People, or Andrew Taylor.  If you're looking for Rock then how about Andrew Marcus, Citizens, Fit For A King, Needtobreathe, Satellite, or Stryper?  Techno, we have Andy Hunter.  Singer / Songwriter we have Bird Courage.  Surprisingly, there is a whole lot of Metal / Hardcore bundled today which includes Chaos Invocation, Dynasty, For Today, Hundredth, I Prayed For An Afterlife, and Northern Aggression.  If you're looking for Alternative, how about Courrier, I Am Empire, Ian Yates, or Paramore's new single called "Still In You"?  There's not a lot of Hop-Hop / Rap to choose from other than J Boy, or Whiteout.  How about Praise & Worship?  New Has Come has a nice "Alive In Him" single.  Acoustic perhaps?  Oasis Church.  Pop?  One Republic.  There's also a fairly nice Blues release by Slide Brothers included today.  And Stigma should take care of your Punk needs.
