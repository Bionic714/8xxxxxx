,abicafan4ever,2013-03-26T06:45Z,I would also like to know if the update is safe. I'm assuming it is but I just wanna be safe
,misterburnz,2013-03-26T15:52Z,"IF you are having ANY problems burning.

START HERE
http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16827106352&cm_sp=DailyDeal-_-27-106-352-_-Homepage

AND THEN, stop bitching about why your truncate, overburn, mp3 bojangled glitches aren't working. It's 20 bucks, and you will never have another problem again. Shit I found mine at microcenter for 12.  

Day in day out, you guys think free alternatives will guarantee you gameplayability. NOPE. Stop being the cheapeast of the cheap, buy the IHAS burner, and then do yourself a favor and buy an account with RapidShare or OTEUpoload, you can get games in a quarter of the time, thanks to overzealous leechers here."
,AoF,2013-03-26T15:57Z,"@ _Whoa_

You're still talking, you do realize that right? ok good. Now go cry somewhere else."

,kdallas2010,2013-03-27T02:27Z,"damn _whoa_ give it a rest.  We just want our warez.  tpb members could care less how they come by it as long as it's not corrupted or a trojan.

kudos Gh0stNet for continual quality ups.
"
,Smallz94,2013-03-27T05:07Z,It seems to be working. :) ive been playing it for about 30min and no errors has come upon  THanks GHOSTNET!
,omegaviper,2013-03-27T05:17Z,"this will update your dashboard to 16.202 unless you already have it.  I did it and it is safe, I usually put stock firmware on before I do an update but I did not do it this time and simply applied the date from this game and I did not get stuck in the update loop, you could try it to but be warned it may not work for everyone, but even if you do get in the loop, you can get out of it."
,Stargate29,2013-03-27T06:26Z,"It is asking me to update the game, might just chance it"

,gameboy77,2013-04-02T02:13Z,"ok so i am not such a noob at this, how ever i am having a problem with abx. i have it set at autofix 2 it does its thing and then says the dmi and ss unverified. try autofix 3. so i do this and then it says..... ERROR: failed to reopen ""the file name) .iso for writing.
have never come across this...any help would be great."
,dudelove420,2013-04-05T00:35Z,"Assassinprofessor, it would unflash your console, I would say to you to just go out and either get xkey or do what I did and flash your console over to lt 3.0 that way you will never have a problem when updating.  "
,yllibi,2013-04-05T01:28Z,"@Assassinprofessor 

I did the update and then my previous games didn't work, including this one, so I googled and found out how to uninstall the update that came with the disc. I went to System/storage/clear cache, now all the games work and my dashboard is on 166.. something. And of course army of two the devlis c... is working too. If you do this then do it on your own risk. 

Im on liteon slim lt 2.0"
,yllibi,2013-04-05T01:32Z,"@Assassinprofessor 

btw I always use topology 2.0 on xgd3 and layerbreak on 2086912 and it always works. "
,Assassinprofessor,2013-04-06T01:20Z,"@yllibi
yes, i watched the clip on youtube but wasnt sure whether the other games will work, im too on LT 2.0 n most of my games r used with topology..Ninja Gaiden was asking for update either, now i'll see injustice gods among us whether it seeks for update either n then i'll do it"
,Assassinprofessor,2013-04-06T13:06Z,"@yllibi
one more thing, you cleared the cache after you updated or before the updating?"
,Assassinprofessor,2013-04-06T18:05Z,"ok, good, it works now:)"
,adir9500,2013-05-04T00:45Z,its need a repair from abgx or just burn from imgburn?
,mrcory12345ui,2013-05-12T21:56Z,Alot of hit and run will report back when finished.
