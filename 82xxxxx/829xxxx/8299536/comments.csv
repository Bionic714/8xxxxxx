,coyb85,2013-03-25T19:07Z,"haha, was just about to upload this, looks like you beat me to it...thanks anyway :)"
,binderguy1,2013-03-25T19:52Z,"Thanks for the ul, blackcanary.  That's twice you came up with torrents today.

Just out of curiousity, where do you find these?

I've checked through regular search, 0-day week, and hitlist.  and were only able to find barely seeded and unusable items."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-25T20:18Z,"i think they're new. (i saw them posted on bolt.cd on friday.) if it's coincidence, it's a good one.  :-)"
,jsnyder0419,2013-03-25T23:47Z,"I know that I downloaded these over the weekend on the magazine3k.com website, so it's possible that's where these came from?"
,ineffed,2013-03-26T08:22Z,"Thank you again.
This is probably a long shot, but do you have The Second Life of Doctor Mirage?"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-26T14:05Z,"ineffed, you can find the complete doctor mirage (and all the original valiant books) in this torrent from a few months ago: http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7833326/Valiant_and_Acclaim_all_titles_giga"
,deimos170,2013-03-26T17:15Z,"finally, i've been searching for this for months since i red the preview. 
i thought it was never going to be digitalized.

how come the issues scans are released now altogheter??

why not monthly like it uses to happen with most going on series?"
,ineffed,2013-03-26T17:38Z,Thank you!!
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-26T17:56Z,"you're welcome ineffed. deimos170, perhaps the scanners just hadn't gotten around to it? relatively speaking, that happens with many indy comics titles. quite a few books aren't scanned on 0-days."
,muckymucks,2013-03-27T19:53Z,Thanks for the upload. I bought the first two issues but I've yet to read them. lol
