,rodiastym,2013-03-26T06:33Z,"ai galera pra jogar o resident evil 6 de 2 no mesmo pc, em tela dividida ou split screen, e só ligar 2 controles no pc. no meu caso eu usei 2 controles usb do ps2. o jogo reconhece. não precisa instalar nada. e so conectar os controles e abrir o jogo. logo após o prólogo, na opção campanha de 2 jogadores, escolha tela dividida. depois, o primeiro controle escolhe com quem jogar, aperte start, depois o segundo controle (sem escolha) aperte start também. o jogo não reconhece o player 1 jogando no teclado e o player 2 no controle, ou vice-versa. pra jogar de dois tem que ter 2 controles ligados no pc..."

If your listening (& I suspect you are) I don't know why TPTB take the time do what they do, e.g. crack games, upload torrents etc., but I just want to say that there are many like myself that appreciate it.

For as many idiots that bitch & moan about ""it's a virus!"" or ""dat shitz is fake yo! fuck diz uploader!""there are many more people like myself that respect & appreciate the work you do.

May God save you, TPTB & The Pirate Bay!

sharing is not a crime!"
,PseudoPositive,2013-03-26T21:45Z,"Nothing but problems with this. I tried this on 2 different rigs, one with AV, & one without, they both encountered the same issue:

End result is a folder about 1.41gig and an unplayable game, don't bother with this torrent."
[V],Shroo,2013-03-27T13:32Z,"@PseudoPositive

There are 3 possibilities.

Your torrent encountered an error, which could result in corrupted files. Perhaps you're having ancient hardware which can't handle the installation. Or you're simply lying!

Rip installs without any issues on our PCs. We guarantee it works perfectly. It's up to downloaders who to believe, a VIP or just some user."
,PseudoPositive,2013-03-27T14:08Z,"@Shroo, I've DL'd some of your other torrents & had no issues, I've tried this 4 times now, firstly extracting with 7zip, then a second time with HJ-Split, everything seemed ok till the install process. I'm using Win7 32bit with 4gig ram, 2.66GHz core 2 duo CPU with all needed softwares for playing games up to date. The install gets to 40% then I get that error message (both rigs), you may have Uarc etc on your PC, that's why it works for you. I'm not lying about my statement, I would rather it worked, & I post a, ""thanks Shroo"" remark here, I don't troll, I just wanted the game. Maybe it was a torrent error, but that would not explain the clean pre-install extraction, hope it worked for others though."
,agniraksh,2013-03-27T16:34Z,godamn all u leechers seed this torrent i was getting max speed and now its like 1 kb/s wtf...

,wontquit,2013-03-28T00:40Z,"Game works fine but it didn't save any progress.

There is a CAPCOM folder in documents with a config file but no save file.

Any ideas on what I could do to fix this?"
,wontquit,2013-03-28T00:43Z,"BTW, the CAPCOM folder does have a RESIDENT EVIL 6 folder within it.  I'm going to try to make a ""savedata"" folder & see if that helps but if you already know the work-around please let me know."
,arabianprince,2013-03-28T02:09Z,the game was working with me fine but since i log of my pc and came back to play it ...it starts and i easly chose continue but when i click start it just crash to desktop saying re6 stopped working...please need help...thank you

Thanks for the reply, works perfect. Saves, settings etc.

Game sucks though.  No ones fault but Capcom's."
