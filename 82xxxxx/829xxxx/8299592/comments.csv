,theshape31,2013-03-25T18:44Z,"DRM locked, Steam client required to play.

I'm going to pass and wait for a proper DRM-free release."
,Kortzen,2013-03-25T18:48Z,Cr@cker..I love you!
,Crazydrax,2013-03-25T18:52Z,Yea thanks man! :)
,Arbiter89,2013-03-25T18:55Z,"Thanks for the upload! Starting the download now, quite sure it will take ages before it's done, but still worth it."
,PonyMSeed,2013-03-25T18:57Z,Really excited to see if this is working. I have been trying to break the manifest/CFD files for a few hours now to no avail.
,godfathertig,2013-03-25T18:58Z,is this fake?
,PonyMSeed,2013-03-25T19:00Z,"Also, are you 100% sure that the season pass content is already here? Typically the DLC is downloaded after unlock from Steam"
,godfathertig,2013-03-25T19:01Z,?
,PonyMSeed,2013-03-25T19:02Z,"@godfathertig: Most likely this is legit. He is a purple skull, and his Xbox release earlier was also legit"
,thcfreak666,2013-03-25T19:03Z,Speed to bad. I don´t wait weeks.
,PonyMSeed,2013-03-25T19:06Z,"Remember guys, with all releases like this; please seed at least 1.5x! It is common courtesy, and helps your fellow brothers play as well"
,dehboss,2013-03-25T19:06Z,=DDD
,xmagusxmagus,2013-03-25T19:07Z,"Thanks very much for the up. Hopefully a good scene crack comes out soon.

Will have my box uploading this all week at around 5Mb. Enjoy all, and remember if you enjoy this game PLEASE support the developer."
,cc178700,2013-03-25T19:08Z,"Not sure I understand...so we can run it off the disc and play it fine that way, we just can't properly install it to the system?  Thanks!"
,theshape31,2013-03-25T19:11Z,"Skidrow just repacked this release.  These are the real install instructions after extraction.  Steam required:

1. Copy the contents of the distribution in the root of your Steam-client 
2. Wait for the official release And CRACK, and play

If you're looking for a DRM-free copy like I am, you'll have to wait until someone rips the retail PC DVDs and cracks it."
,Daestoga,2013-03-25T19:17Z,"Yo, what does ""DRM Locked"" mean?"
,Arbiter89,2013-03-25T19:18Z,"@cc178700 and everyone else who's confused, this is an ""UNLOCKED"" release. That means it's just the game, WITHOUT THE CRACK. You CANNOT play it without the crack. However, you can download this and then apply the crack once it's out. That way you can get the game early, and then just apply the crack instead of waiting."
,BlackSite99,2013-03-25T19:22Z,seed !!! pls
,Daestoga,2013-03-25T19:26Z,Hmmm... when do you guys think a crack to play without steam will be released?
,godfathertig,2013-03-25T19:30Z,"if this is real I will seed for 1 full day
maybe 2"
,topsecret97,2013-03-25T19:31Z,"why do you guys love cr@cker? It wasn't him to crack the game lol, skidrow released it today, he just dowloaded and shared..."
,godfathertig,2013-03-25T19:31Z,I see no iso files in here why is that?
,xmagusxmagus,2013-03-25T19:31Z,"cc178700:

You can't run it because there's no crack to run it yet (the game wants to verify/run through steam). So this isn't playable without a crack."
,Daestoga,2013-03-25T19:34Z,"Also, how come it comes in rars that are like 200 mb each and are like ""BIOSHOCK INFINITE STEAM Part 001-928"" Why isnt it just in one rar?"
,godfathertig,2013-03-25T19:37Z,thankyou for this if you can see it. the comments aren't showing on my end for some reason
,godfathertig,2013-03-25T19:41Z,I agree with daestoga. I Don't know how to make those files work for me?? why is it diff?
,PonyMSeed,2013-03-25T19:45Z,"Its probably multiple rars because he is uploading this to file sharing sites as well. Just use winrar to open it once its fully downloaded. Trust me, it will work fine!"
,godfathertig,2013-03-25T19:47Z,ponymseed    Will you tell me how man? I never done it like that. thanks in advance
,Daestoga,2013-03-25T19:50Z,"Yeah Pony, do you mean unrar each one, or is there a secret rar we have to download haha."
,xmagusxmagus,2013-03-25T19:51Z,"godfather: he's saying open part001 with winrar and it will open all the parts and extract the data (the parts point to the next part) i.e. part001 points to part002 automatically.

Once again, if you enjoy the game PLEASE support the devs."
,tomppixu,2013-03-25T19:52Z,guys there is a crack http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8299711/BioShock.Infinite.CRACK.ONLY-ALI213
,godfathertig,2013-03-25T19:53Z,oh ok thankyou. Sorry im such a noob and I do support them for sure. Also is ali123 crack fake??? he had a legit one before thanks for lall the help
,tomppixu,2013-03-25T19:54Z,its from Gh0stNet so it should be legit
,xmagusxmagus,2013-03-25T19:54Z,If anyone is confused about extraction just extract part001 and it'll do the rest for you.
,godfathertig,2013-03-25T19:57Z,so if this is straightand ali123 is crack is straight we all can be playing in a few hours then??? SWEET!!!!
,xmagusxmagus,2013-03-25T20:00Z,Comments too slow :((
,xmagusxmagus,2013-03-25T20:02Z,"ali-123 crack isn't verified. It's not saving games, causing people to have to restart on any re-launch. Will have to wait for proper crack."
,Fluid56,2013-03-25T20:05Z,"Rar's are split up into ""parts"" because downloading ""parts"" of a file takes a lot less time than downloading one giant ass file."
,s1raz1,2013-03-25T20:05Z,fuck those rars
,godfathertig,2013-03-25T20:08Z,fuck your face im thankfull
,Daestoga,2013-03-25T20:10Z,"Yo, since this thing is requiring us to play on steam, once a crack releases do we then use the crack and play it on steam? Or does it make it so we can play it without steam? Should we just wait for the Standalone CD so we dont have to play with steam?"
,tomppixu,2013-03-25T20:12Z,Daestoga good luck trying to launch the game when steam is running :D
,Mahoraba3,2013-03-25T20:12Z,"To those asking about all the ""rars"" no Its not because it takes less time when downloading.

When you upload/download a file, especially a large file there's a chance that the file 'misses' something or in other words, creates an error and makes you have to re-download.

When you instead rar the file in the way that is done here, that chance of the file creating said error and not working correctly or at all, nearly vanishes."
,ClickTPB,2013-03-25T20:19Z,Thanks for the early upload. Cheers
,scyris99,2013-03-25T20:20Z,I have noticed alot of cracked games recently have issues with saving progress. Maybe they added something to the protection? not that it takes long before its fully cracked.
,ancemu,2013-03-25T20:23Z,"come on, seed, you filthy whores!!!!"

,bulletproofAllahuAkbar,2013-03-25T20:37Z,We need the HD texture patch too. The game is useless without it.
,tapaka,2013-03-25T20:38Z,Yeah thx !
,xmagusxmagus,2013-03-25T20:38Z,"Like I said, I have a box seeding this and it will be for the foreseeable future. Currently u/l at around 3.5mb and only pulling at 800k. Ratio's at ~4.0 and will only climb."

,Mahoraba3,2013-03-25T20:47Z,"Why exactly release a game ""WITHOUT"" HD Textures? Its also 17GB, if this is 17 without HD Textures I'd be amazed at the file size of the one with, but I'm pretty confident this includes it."

,Daestoga,2013-03-25T21:34Z,"Either way, can someone explain if steam is needed for this? Like lets say a crack comes out, I just apply it and play?"
,jakedilla,2013-03-25T21:39Z,"The game WITH HD textures is supposed to be 25-30gb. Keep in mind you also have to have the PC to run the game with those textures. I'm sure a separate torrent will pop up soon enough, but just try to see if you even need it first before complaining"
,Jaffles,2013-03-25T21:47Z,0.5mb download sped :(
,Mahoraba3,2013-03-25T21:49Z,"@Destoga, you won't need steam, the game itself is the steam version but with how the crack always works, it completely skips the need to access parts of Steam itself, just uses the API file found in the crack when its released."
,Mahoraba3,2013-03-25T21:55Z,"To shed light on the whole ""HD Texture"" pack thing, the PC version does not have an optional HD Texture pack like the Console version does. 

The PC version simply comes with it because that's the smart thing to do."

,Doltear,2013-03-25T21:59Z,Lol.. I have finished downloading it already an its a GREAT game! (: (Digital Download @18mb/ps) bought the game on pre-order.. It's not that expensive like most of all the other game releases so why wait? Go grab a digital release an you will be enjoying it in no time like I am :P
,godfathertig,2013-03-25T22:00Z,whats blackbox???
,Daestoga,2013-03-25T22:06Z,So... who thinks they have a time for a crack?
,theshape31,2013-03-25T22:14Z,Blackbox torrent is a FAKE.
,Viperdude,2013-03-25T22:23Z,Does this game have the HD textures or not? If not I'm waiting for another torrent.
,Mahoraba3,2013-03-25T22:29Z,"@Viperdude, If its anything like the HD resolutions for Sleeping Dogs, its a free DLC Addon that you'll just throw into the file after you download this release.

Its not like you'll have to re download the whole game just to get the Texture Pack, a texture pack is just that, an addon to the game that you can add into the files, from a separate download, no different then adding in DLC.

I however, find it retarded that any PC version of any game has to think that HDD space is a problem for people and that they decided ""OH GOD, gotta give these people low quality textures to save them HDD space!"".

Because lets face it, high resolution textures only require slightly more VRAM and a little bit more demand from the GPU itself, not really much at all, which is why you can play with HD textures on console."
,Viperdude,2013-03-25T22:32Z,"Well, if it lets you set the game resolution to 1080P or above does it have the HD textures?"
,TurtleGuy,2013-03-25T22:37Z,I don't get this whole no HD texture stuff... The file size is 16gb what exactly was ripped? Will the game look terrible without hd textures?
,Fluid56,2013-03-25T22:43Z,"yes it has HD textures. 

p.s. no one gives a shit if you download this torrent or not, if you want HD textures so bad buy the goddamn game."
,Fluid56,2013-03-25T22:44Z,"for consoles* because the PC version already has the HD textures built in.

,Lucais,2013-03-26T19:08Z,"I'm not sure how to do this, I have it all installed. Could someone help me out?"
,Mahoraba3,2013-03-26T19:08Z,"@Lucias: Each .rar file will point to the correct next-in-line-file while extracting, you don't need to extract more then one of the .rars because each .rar holds a separate portion of the data, simply right click any of the files and extract it like you would any other .rar file.

The reason for the file structure to be like this is because smaller files when downloaded have a much smaller chance of having a check-sum error and creating a problem with your specific install and would require you to re-download, a file structure like this almost completely removes that from happening."
,Mahoraba3,2013-03-26T19:10Z,"@Lucias, After you've installed it from the .iso file that you got from extracting, you'll need to download one additional file that will allow your game to run without needing Steam to verify it.

http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8300453/BioShock_Infinite_Crack_Only-FLT

Download that and replace the files that it gives you with the ones in your install directory."

,Mahoraba3,2013-03-26T19:43Z,"@Lucias: Right, This is a Steam Release, forgot. You won't actually see a .iso file you'll see the actual install files themself.

After you've extracted it wherever you did, you'll still need to replace the files that you would download with the crack I linked above, which I will link again.

,Moonshaft,2013-03-27T01:45Z,"For everyone who isn't sure what to do with this download!

1. This torrent is filled with an assortment of .rar files. Programs like WinRAR will work wonders with opening and extracting the information.

2. Inside of the .rars are all of the game files you need. There is no installation process, you are pretty much just downloading the straight and pure game in condensed .rar form.

3. Make a new folder named Bioshock 3 (or whatever else you want to call it) then open this download and start with ""Bioshock Infinite STEAM UNLOCKED.part001"". You are going to extract ALL of the files in there to your new Bioshock 3 (or other-ly named) folder.

4. From this point you are going to download the crack from here: http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8300453/BioShock_Infinite_Crack_Only-FLT

5. Replace the Binaries folder from the base game with the Fairlight crack torrent. Your game is now cracked and playable!


**** IF YOU USED THE ALI123 CRACK!!***

If you used the ALI123 crack, you CANNOT use this one. You need to re-download, or re-extract, or whatever to get these original base files and overwrite them with Fairlight's crack instead. If you try and mix Fairlight's crack with ALI123's crack the game will not function.


The only other problem I've encountered is I can't find ANY of the Instant Day 1 Bonus Pack Content, and if you have an autosave where Elizabeth has an interaction with you right afterward, her interaction with glitch out and you will have to load the chapter before it in order to get it working again."

,mudkipzyo,2013-04-04T23:24Z,"I had difficulties getting this to work, but I have finally figured out what was going wrong. Here's a step-by-step process to make this work.

After downloading the torrent, you're going to be presented with many .rar files, some links and documents.
Open 7-Zip (this is what I used, other programs like Winzip should work), select all of the .rar files, and extract them to a folder ON YOUR DESKTOP.
I tried this many times extracting to a Documents folder, then to Program Files, nothing worked. It may work in other locations, I can't say whether or not, but the game will work from Desktop.

Download your crack. I used the Bioshock Infinite Crack Only-FTL one available here. Open the folder, open Binaries, open Win32. Highlight the BioshockInfinite .exe and the steam_api.dll, right click, select Copy.

Now open the folder on your desktop that you extracted the files to. Open Binaries, right click on Win32, and select Paste. It will prompt you whether you want to overwrite the two files, select yes to both.

After this, double clicking the .exe opens the game right up, and it plays flawlessly. No gameplay issues or crashes, no saving issues.

The website states that you need Games for Windows Live in order to make Skidrows games work. I dont think this applies to this particular game, as it never asked me for any Windows Live credentials, but it never worked until after I did install it, so people who are more technically advanced can answer this for me.

Also, during all of my failed attempts, double clicking the .exe attempted to open Steam on my computer. It no longer does once I correctly applied the crack, but out of paranoia I have blocked steam in my firewall while the game is running."
