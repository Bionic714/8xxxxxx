,iGrenade,2013-03-25T20:05Z,"Blame AMC, not the release group."
,stibone,2013-03-26T00:39Z,"AMC Broadcasts them with 5.1 audio dumbass. The HDTV 720p rips from AMC all have them. This is coming from iTunes and therefore should have 5.1 audio and does not. Which is why these WEB-DLs are crap. They used to have 5.1. Now they dont. And its stupid. Like you. 

Think before you type. Or at least have your facts straight, idiot. "
