Owen Wister's 1902 western novel The Virginian was one of the first great novels of the American West. Set in the semi-mythical town of Medicine Bow, Wyoming in the 1890s, it chronicled the lives and relationships of the people who came west and settled the wild land. Starring James Drury in the title role, The Virginian was the first 90 minute television western, airing in prime time on NBC from 1962-1971. The stellar cast included Lee J. Cobb, Doug McClure, Gary Clark and Roberta Shore, and each week brought talented guest stars to The Virginian. Season Two's line-up includes Joan Blondell, Broderick Crawford, Everett Sloan, Pat O'Brien, Iron Eyes Cody, Jane Wyatt and many more!
