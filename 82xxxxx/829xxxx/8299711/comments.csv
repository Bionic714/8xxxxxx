,MEGodObeyOrDIEeee,2013-03-25T19:56Z,"I dont know if its legit, but uploader seems atleast solid?!"
,xmagusxmagus,2013-03-25T19:56Z,"Download speed is not an issue, but I'll be upping this all week (if it pans out to be legit). Remember, if you enjoy this game PLEASE support the dev."

[V],Gh0stNet,2013-03-25T20:01Z,it is working but unfortunately the crack is not saving any progress so wait for Scene or proper one 
,Daestoga,2013-03-25T20:01Z,So working?
,xmagusxmagus,2013-03-25T20:01Z,"Comments are slow, can't verify this yet personally as my skidrow download is only 1/2 done."
,ben7530,2013-03-25T20:01Z,">Can anyone verify this file?

I don't know about working as a crack, but if Gh0stnet uploaded it, it's clean & legit."
,tomppixu,2013-03-25T20:02Z,damn the comments update is so slow
,DragonE5,2013-03-25T20:03Z,lol
,Whickerx7,2013-03-25T20:03Z,Pink skull by his name means its real
,Daestoga,2013-03-25T20:03Z,What do you mean it doesnt save any progress? No saving? :( But it works with the skidrow right?
,remotehugger2,2013-03-25T20:04Z,"idk ? the game isnt listed on orlydb yet, so i cant imagine its real - but again, idk -"
,tomppixu,2013-03-25T20:05Z,Daestoga he means you cant save your game you have to start all over if you exit the game and re-launch it
,Fluid56,2013-03-25T20:06Z,"A lot of things don't get listed on ORLYDB. The site is old, and the people who update it are not known for being vigilant."
,nox234558,2013-03-25T20:09Z,guys i checked it with kaspersky its clean and its real just as @Gh0stNet says its not saving progress :( so just wait till tomorow and maybe the crack shows up anyways tnx for this :)
,tomppixu,2013-03-25T20:10Z,nox234558 haha when i play this game i will play 24/7 non stop so no problem for me
,scyris99,2013-03-25T20:18Z,"Its real, its on rlslog.org has the p2p game release and mentions u need this crack that this torrent gives to play it."
,elunes,2013-03-25T20:25Z,"As stated, it works as a crack but will not save."
,remotehugger2,2013-03-25T21:39Z,@Fluid56 - thank you - i did not know that - and i meant to say that it was  nothing against Gh0stNet either - always top notch torrents - never had any problems with anything from him -

,Fluid56,2013-03-25T22:48Z,"it's true, Gh0st is awesome.

that said this crack is still shit for now, I imagine a proper one will be released tomorrow or at least in a couple of days. 

patience is key folks. "
,NakanoSan,2013-03-25T22:56Z,"Game won't save? That's okay, I'll just finish it in 1999 mode in one sitting.

Or at least keep the game running when I go to bed."

,beefuu,2013-03-27T21:10Z,"This crack doesn't load the saves, but your saves are in ""Bioshock InfiniteBinariesWin32ProfileSavesSaveData""

But the FLT crack loads saves, so dl that crack, run the game once and exit. Now you copy the saves from the folder i mentioned, and paste them into ""AppDataLocalFLTSteam8870remoteSaveData""

Ta-da! No need to start over again."
,beefuu,2013-03-27T21:12Z,"Sorry the paths are ""/Bioshock Infinite/Binaries/Win32/Profile/Saves/SaveData""
and
""/AppData/Local/FLT/Steam/8870/remote/SaveData"""
