[V],HighCode,2013-03-26T05:32Z,"Reviews & Ratings for ""The Master"":
This film is too long, too boring, and meanders like a mid-western river. I kept waiting and waiting for the story line to pick up, but it was at it's peak on the floor....Horrible, Ridiculous, Pointless and repellent...

Same Director & Writer as of movies: 
Magnolia (1999)  & There Will Be Blood (2007)

,link5a,2013-04-12T15:54Z,"@HighCode I agree! Good acting, though, but what's the point?"
[V],HighCode,2013-04-13T14:33Z,"Hoops, sorry, I was wrong about Magnolia (1999), it is a very good movie, I was thinking of Melancholia (2011) which was awful, especially the first part.
There Will Be Blood is just as bad, literally just Blood and lot of it with no reason...The plot of ""The Master"" seams pathetic, sort of self-pity-drama.  "
