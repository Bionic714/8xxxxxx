Maiden England (re-released in 2013 as Maiden England '88) is a live video by the band Iron Maiden during their Seventh Son of a Seventh Son world tour, which was dubbed 7th Tour of a 7th Tour.

It was recorded at the Birmingham, England NEC on 27 and 28 November 1988,[2] released on VHS in November 1989, followed by a limited VHS/CD edition in 1994. The CD in this package was missing two songs that were on the video ("Can I Play with Madness" and "Hallowed Be Thy Name"), due to space limitations.

It was directed and edited by Steve Harris, Iron Maiden founder and bassist.[3]

In 2012, Iron Maiden undertook their Maiden England World Tour, which is largely based around the original video in setlist and stage design.[4] A re-issue of the concert film itself was first mentioned by Iron Maiden in September 2007, with a release date set for 2008, but was later delayed.[5] In an interview with German magazine Rock Hard in August 2012, bassist Steve Harris confirmed that Maiden England will be re-released in 2013, with the concert footage expanded to comprise the show's encores which were not included in the original VHS.[6] On 12 February 2013, Iron Maiden announced that Maiden England would be re-released on DVD, CD and picture disc on 25 March 2013 under the title Maiden England '88. Along with the aforementioned encores, the new video will also include the third part of the "History of Iron Maiden" documentary series (continuing from 2004's The Early Days and 2008's Live After Death re-issue) as well as promo videos and the 1987 documentary 12 Wasted Years.
