**********NOTE*****************
I've been getting a lot requests, and I do try to post when they are found, so please don't think I'm ignoring them. A lot of the movies you guys request I find in standard definition, so from now on if you have a request that I cannot snag in HD, let me know in the request that you'd take the best possible SD version. Thanks!

SEED PLEASE! I have limited bandwidth, so I try not to upload new movies until there's at least 5 full seeds. I have LOTS more classic movies to up, so if you like my work please help out and seed, which saves me from having to seed old uploads.

Please comment, feedback is nice to keep me motivated and to let me know if my work is any good. Thanks
