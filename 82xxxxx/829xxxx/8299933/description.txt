Roy Stuart is known predominantly as a photographer whose subject matter hovers around themes of erotica, voyeurism, and sexual taboos, a great deal of which can be seen in his volumes of work published over at the full-color-tastic pub house Taschen. Not surprising his full-length debut, THE LOST DOOR, looks to be a filmic version of one of his yet to be exhausted subjectsΓÇöthe female nudeΓÇöwith a little insane asylum to mix it up a bit.
Obsession, sex, and illusion are depicted in a series of parallel stories. Alex, a museum guard is love-struck with Nicole with whom he lives. She meets a naive amazon, Kristina, who likewise falls desperately in love with the young woman. Kristina enlists the help of an intellectual playboy to break up the couple who by theorizing on the "love-virus and the futility of romance manages to manipulate Nicole before being mysteriously murdered. Kristina is arrested as a suspect. The Lost Door opens while Kristina is being interrogated in a psychiatric hospital where she has been committed. Catherine, a young and beautiful psychiatrist has been assigned by the court to discover what goes on in the deranged yet intriguing mind of this suspected murderer, haunted by ghosts and strange sexual situations. After a long confrontation, it's the mysterious Kristina who opens up the young psychiatrists mind to her own repressed desires.
