I just played through the entire movie here on my ps3... no problems."
[V],dhjudasx,2013-05-09T20:20Z,"So we've got confirmation that Sony has been stuffing Cinavia on the blurays themselves making it impossible to encode and play on cinavia protected devices.

ALL ""TRUE"" blurays and bluray sources have of this movie have cinavia. Web rips I've heard also have cinavia because sony mastered the movie with it integrated for web release too."
