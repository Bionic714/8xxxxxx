,stunna24,2013-03-26T02:39Z,"This guy says it better be the real deal. How about you start appreciating what thenoobish does for everyone. Im tired of hearing people bitch. Seed this, seed that. Is this real. Same people that hit and run over and over. If this man stops uploading torrents you will really be bitching. Give the man the credit he is owed."

,Smallz94,2013-03-27T18:15Z,^ This guy right. Something went wrong in the abgx360 verification  i understand that the game is not yet verified but the program didnt find the topology data. It is saying that this is use for a new or something like that HELP!
,McCregor,2013-03-27T18:16Z,some one knows how to burn games on MAC?
,Smallz94,2013-03-27T18:22Z,i wont burn until they verify it even though i dont play online 
,Smallz94,2013-03-27T19:03Z,"@McCregor


Just look on YouTube. Pretty sure somebody has a tutorial for that"
,earl_2k6,2013-03-27T22:06Z,"Nothing is wrong with this rip...but this game is part of a new wave(Wave 18) so it requires you to update your dash. Wait another day or 2 for abgx to update and verify this game. You don't have to delete it. Complex rips never fail.
If you download and burn it, IT WILL WORK flawlessly...but you should still wait til the game is released and the database is updated with ABGX...so hold your horses."
,Smallz94,2013-03-27T23:54Z,can i still burn it GUYS? ^^ I mean i dont play online but i play offline on career mode  thats it :) 
,Averad,2013-03-28T06:45Z,@earl_2k6 - The AGBX Info shows that the disk matches Wave 17 are you sure that it's Wave 18?
,earl_2k6,2013-03-28T11:27Z,"@Averad
This is just something I read on another site. The game is fine to burn.

,stunna24,2013-03-28T22:32Z,Im a moron? How about downloading the shit yourself and seeing if it works. Wait that would me if it didnt you wasted your time. Let someone else do it for you. If you dont trust the noobish you dont know about piratebay or torrents. And nothing is wrong with the game he has no control over when abgx will patch the game for stealth. Once again give the man the credit that is due. One day he going to get tired of people like you and he will stop. On that day you will wish your thanked the noobish instead of just being a dickhead.
,Smallz94,2013-03-29T07:11Z,I am playing the game right now and it is pretty good. Burn with truncate method without ihas burner
,Averad,2013-03-31T20:37Z,"AGBX still has no verified release in the database even though this game was released in the US on  March 26th 2013.

This copy works but wish AGBX would finally verify."

,Riviera1,2013-04-11T04:48Z,"Can someone help please?i am new to this and the first few games I got we're one iso this is like 74 , how do I put them into iso2god to convert to my hdd..when I add iso nothing is tiger woods folder..thx for any help"
,Mr_Heisenberg,2013-06-05T00:32Z,@Riviera1 - Open the file complex-tiger14master.rar with winzip and extract the .dvd file and iso to a safe location. Make sure you open the .RAR file. Or if you have winrar installed then right click the first file ending with .r00 and extract the .dvd file and iso................
