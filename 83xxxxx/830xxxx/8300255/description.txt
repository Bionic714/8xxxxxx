  With more rock and less whine, Cursive provides an exclamation point to the emo scene with Domestica, their third release. Led by vocalists Tim Kasher and former Lullaby for the Working Class frontman Ted Stevens, Domestica explores Kasher's messy divorce through a series of clever but transparent metaphors. Domestica is a concept album harping on the ugliness and beauty of love, a treatise on the pains of divorce and romance. While the themes are nothing new, they are executed inventively. Half the songs don't even contain a chorus, replacing the classic song structure with a string of middle eights held together by the exceptional rhythm section. Despite the instrumental prowess, the true standout on this record is Kasher. His throaty voice propels the album's most satiating cut, "A Red So Deep," from a dissonant clang to an effortless whisper. From the hard rock of the D.C. scene ("The Martyr," "The Radiator Hums") to the classic Pavement sound ("Making Friends and Acquaintances"), Cursive proves they are more than the typical emo band. Kasher's marital troubles transform the selections on Domestica from mere calls for help to anthems of rejection.
