,naeem.63,2013-03-28T12:43Z,Fake> Sci-Fi version
,Sumoki,2013-03-29T08:46Z,LOL @ everyones comments. Thx for the upload uploader keep up the great work.
,oldbreadbutt,2013-03-29T09:11Z,"anyone complaining about the fact that this isn't the big studio Hollywood release, should consult the IMDb link clearly included in the description. 

I'm personally not interested in downloading this movie, because it probably does suck, but the uploader isn't to blame for people too lazy or stupid to investigate a file before downloading."
,kaaviyan,2013-03-29T12:52Z,hey..thanks dude...

,thereisnoother,2013-03-31T09:37Z,"Well said oldbreadbutt

This is not a ""fake"", it is really and genuinely the movie it says it is which is described on the IMDB info link. I personally do not, but maybe there are people who would like to see the knockoff version. Of course this is not Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters, but Movie names are not trademarked, and I don't see it saying ""witch hunters"" anywhere.  "
,taistoi,2013-04-01T14:50Z,"who the fuck made the subtitles for this? your down-syndrome 11 year old little brother?
they make no sense what-so-ever
actual spoken line: ""we'll find them, easy as pie""
line in subtitle: ""we'll find them, easily as my cakes""
it's as if they were machine translated from another language"
,Assman123,2013-04-11T19:31Z,Fuck this and fuck you!!!!!!

hahahaha. i thought this was the hollywood movie. xD should've consulted the IMDb link. :p"
,koxxit,2013-04-19T17:30Z,"I can't believe how fucking rude people have become, just because they hide behind a fictive names! 

Why don't you just check what you are downloading, and stop spewing out all the shitty comments!

People like you guys are the reason I've lost faith in humanity. I don't think the west is going to live for much longer. Soon we'll all be riding horses, growing and hunting for food as city's are destroyed, just because this generation are to retarded to handle the world outside a computer....

The end!"
