[T],h2obagger,2013-03-27T00:43Z,"Well the end of my breathing tube is still above the top of the drifts, so I believe there is still hope of making it thru till spring! :-)  
Saw a couple, possibly slightly over optimistic, robin ""scouts"" flitting around the yard last weekend, so it seems they are also hopeful for a warming trend soon... Till then there is EE's to keep us warm."
