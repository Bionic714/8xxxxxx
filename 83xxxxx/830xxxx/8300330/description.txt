http://nimga.com/m/yMpcb.png

Paul Hollywood takes viewers on a globetrotting journey into the
diverse and colourful world of flat breads. Along the way, he serves
up flavour-packed dishes from all over the world, delicious at any
time of day.

With little more than cornflour and water, Paul makes authentic corn
tortilla served stacked and layered with spicy roast chicken,
guacamole and sour cream in a mouth-watering corn tortilla tower.

He bakes an aromatic, herb laden Middle Eastern maneesh - dipped in
his smoky baba ganoush, a perfect lunchtime snack. Paul also tries
his hand at making traditional wafer thin Indian lentil dosa and gets
to grips with a giant, Caribbean supersize flat bread, 'buss up shot'.

But there is a special place in his heart for Cyprus, so he shares
his recipe for nigella scented pittas stuffed with his favourite
filling, succulent pork souvlaki.
