King Biscuit Flower Hour Presents Kansas is the third live album from American rock band Kansas, released in 1998. In 2003, the album was re-titled and re-released as Greatest Hits Live. It was also released in the DVD-Audio format as "From the Front Row Live," but the 5.1 mix for this series was not of particularly high quality. The original performance included 2 tracks not included in this release: "Play the Game Tonight" and a cover of "Born To Be Wild." The liner notes include an extensive essay describing this era of the band and the circumstances surrounding the album and tour supporting it during which this show was recorded.

Featuring performances by Steve Walsh and Steve Morse, the album was recorded on February 14, 1989 at the Tower Theater in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania during their In the Spirit of Things tour.
