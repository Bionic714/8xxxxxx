,Willzyx,2013-03-26T18:54Z,"To those complaining about the slow download speeds at the moment: show some patience! 0day releases take time to build up seeders; that's the deal. You are getting a brand new game for free so stop acting like you're entitled to immediate access as well. Act like an adult. This type of childish behavior makes me ashamed to call myself a gamer.

Understand that this is a compressed .iso archive split into multiple files due to its size. Selecting any file in the series will suffice since WinRAR knows where to begin extraction. If you are here at TPB, you should already be able to recognize this on your own.

Anyway, this is a great upload. Regardless of its enormous file size (16GB download plus 18GB installation), extraction was fine, installation was fine, and gameplay is fine. THIS IS LEGIT. IT DOES WORK. So far, I'm a little over an hour into the game and so far so good. If you have the patience to wait several hours overnight to download, it will be worth your time (and bandwidth).

Keep up the good work, Mr.Stifmeister!"

,Dirkei,2013-03-27T14:12Z,"-----INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS-----
BEFORE INSTALLATION I RECOMMEND HAVING WINRAR FOR THIS.
1). After download locate the BioShock_Infinite-FLT folder.
2). Go to the folder DVD1, right click the first file named ""flt-bina"" and open with Winrar ( or any other compression program you use ).
3). Extract the file named ""flt-bina.iso"" to anywhere you'd prefer.
4). After extraction do this for the remaining two folders, named DVD2 and DVD3.
5). Now mount flt-bina that's located in DVD1 with your preferred program, and install. Do this for the remaining two discs. (It'll ask for the next disc, click browse and locate where the disc is mounted, it'll say Bioshock disc 1, 2 or 3)
6). Locate the crack in Disc 3 and patch over in BioShock InfiniteBinariesWin32, or whenever you've installed the game.
7) Play!"

Patience is a virtue, and the game can be bought cheap if you wait a few mere years.

I wager the majority who suggest others seed do none on their side. And the majority that seed have stupid caps on the output that effectively mean they are worse than not seeding. 

The overhead to keep up with 44k leeches and 5k seeders is enough to cripple the torrent.

Apply the crack on Disc 3. Or use this crack.

,SickJoke1,2013-03-28T16:20Z,Excellent torrent but the game gets boring pretty quick.
,Jason310M,2013-03-28T16:38Z,"For all the noobs out there that can't for the life of them understand how to get this torrent working please follow these instructions. If you can't follow these simple instructions then you are truly an idiot who shouldn't be downloading torrents in the first place.

Step 1. Download the torrent. Once you finished downloading the torrent you will have 3 folders named DVD1, DVD2 and DVD3.

Step 2. Use 7zip to extract these files to the location of your choice: 
in DVD 1 folder extract: flt-bina.001 
in DVD 2 folder extract: flt-binb.001
in DVD 3 folder extract: flt-binc.001

Download 7zip here:
http://www.7-zip.org/download.html

If you have winrar you could also use that, just open winrar (winRAR.exe) then browse to the above mentioned files in the winRAR browser. Double click the above files in the browser then you will see the iso, then extract. Do that for EACH file.

You will then end up with these 3 files:
flt-bina.iso
flt-binb.iso
flt-binc.iso

Step 3. Using Daemon tools or a similar virtual drive mounting program, mount the ISO's starting with flt-bina.iso.
Find setup.exe, double click to install.

Step 4. When it asks you for the second disc mount the second iso (flt-binb.iso) to the same virtual drive that you mounted the first disc, then continue the installation.

Step 5. Do the same with the last iso (flt-binc.iso) when prompted to do so.

Step 6. After you installed the last disc browse with explorer the third disc, inside you will find a  crack folder named 'Fairlight' inside that folder you find a folder named 'Binaries' copy and then merge that binaries folder with your bioshock infinite install location binaries folder. 

You can also use this crack below, many windows 7 64bit users (including myself) have used this crack and it works, and your save will also work, the crack is located here:
http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8302002/Bioshock.Infinite.Crack.Only-3DM

Again merge the 'binaries' folder.

Step 7. Use your firewall to block Bioshockinfinite.exe in the 'win32' folder located in the 'binaries' folder.

Step 8. Run Bioshockinfinite.exe as administrator 

Step 9. Play the game.

Step 10. Profit??

,OmniNegro,2013-03-28T18:23Z,"To all of you that are unwilling to read the comments when your lack of knowledge of anything from a few mere years ago means you have no fucking clue what all these files are: Die in a fire.

Scene releases are often distributed as they were ages ago via Usenet. They are put in an archive and split into pieces. That makes it easier to replace a message containing one of the pieces if it gets trashed by some technical BS.

More things these days are being distributed via torrents, and as a consequence more of this is foreign to the idiot nooblets. 

Stick with your torrents if you like. They have a purpose. But please educate yourself about Usenet and Rar archives and Parity files and such things. They can save your ass if you live in an area where the media trolls control everything.

Let me be very clear for you simpletons: Rar archives are what you are seeing. They can be extracted with WinRar or 7zip. Remember this or go die in a fire."

Just because a) your internet fucking sucks b) your isp fucking sucks c) your torrent client configuration fucking sucks or d) all of the above, we shouldn't have to sit here and suffer through page after page of bitching/complaining/whining about seeders. 

Know that if you are one of these whining trolls that you contributed to myself not seeding this torrent with my 75mbit, yes... 75MBIT UPLOAD speed. Know thats it's going to take you longer to download this wonderful game because you had to get on here and complain and bitch like a 12 year old girl on her first period.

,Jason310M,2013-03-31T20:28Z,"Step 1. Download the torrent. Once you finished downloading the torrent you will have 3 folders named DVD1, DVD2 and DVD3.

Step 2. Use 7zip to extract these files to the location of your choice:
in DVD 1 folder extract: flt-bina.001
in DVD 2 folder extract: flt-binb.001
in DVD 3 folder extract: flt-binc.001

Download 7zip here:
http://www.7-zip.org/download.html

If you have winrar you could also use that, just open winrar (winRAR.exe) then browse to the above mentioned files in the winRAR browser. Double click the above files in the browser then you will see the iso, then extract. Do that for EACH file.

You will then end up with these 3 files:
flt-bina.iso
flt-binb.iso
flt-binc.iso

Step 3. Using Daemon tools or a similar virtual drive mounting program, mount the ISO's starting with flt-bina.iso.
Find setup.exe, double click to install.

Step 4. When it asks you for the second disc mount the second iso (flt-binb.iso) to the same virtual drive that you mounted the first disc, then continue the installation.

Step 5. Do the same with the last iso (flt-binc.iso) when prompted to do so.

Step 6. After you installed the last disc browse with explorer the third disc, inside you will find a crack folder named 'Fairlight' inside that folder you find a folder named 'Binaries' copy and then merge that binaries folder with your bioshock infinite install location binaries folder.

You can also use this crack below, many windows 7 64bit users (including myself) have used this crack and it works, and your save will also work, the crack is located here:
http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8302002/Bioshock.Infinite.Crack.Only-3DM

Again merge the 'binaries' folder.

Step 7. Use your firewall to block Bioshockinfinite.exe in the 'win32' folder located in the 'binaries' folder.

Step 8. Run Bioshockinfinite.exe as administrator

Step 9. Play the game.

Step 10. Profit??"

,theresdividnglines,2013-04-01T20:36Z,"To make DLC work with FLT release (the one I downloaded) I did a few things...

1. Searched ""bioshock dlc"" on kick-ass-torrents and downloaded the one called ""BioShock Infinite DLC Pack P2P"" (and was only 5.16 MB).

2. Extracted the 7zip file and replaced the files in my BioShock Infinite directory (there's also a .zip file in the DLC torrent I downloaded but I think it's the exact same files, just in a different compression format... so ignore it).

3. Start up game- it will ask about brightness, whatever, whatever, start a new game (because saves are gone). Then exit.

4. Found my saves (FLT version) here -> C:Users-yourusername-AppData-Local-FLT-Steam-8870-remote and copied them to the new save folder C:ProgramData-RELOADED-RELOADED-8870-storage (which was created when I started a new game a few moments ago).

5. Start up BioShock- settings and saves are back to normal but ""DLC"" is still greyed out. That's normal. Continue you're game. Right when your game loads you should get a bunch of prompts (if you're far enough into the game I think) that tells you what DLC you now have. "

It combines all the files in the folder into an iso file wich you then drag to the folder you want it placed in.

,Saitekman,2013-04-07T20:06Z,"Thank you Mr.Stifmeister we appreciate the work.

Help if you need it:

1. Download game with a torrent download (I use Utorrent)

2. Once game is downloaded, go to folder and you will see 3 subfolders DVD1, DVD2, DVD3.  Open each one and you will see several files. Go to the very first file and Right click on it and select a program to open it. Some use 7zip, I personally use WinRar. Open it and I personally extracted the ISO in the same folder DVD1 for example. Do this for each folder.

3. Next 'mount' the ISO with a virtual software. (I personally use Daemon Tools)

4. Mount each ISO in the folders DVD1, DVD2, DVD3 to install full game.

5. Next you want to  block the game from accessing the net. So go to your Firewall in Windows and then go to Advance settings and make a Outbound rule. Browse a path to the Biochock folder in your Programs files. Here is the path your looking for  ""C:Program Files (x86)BioShock InfiniteBinariesWin32BioShockInfinite launcher

You need to learn to 'Force Recheck' of the torrent's rar files so they get repaired. 
Repairing the files is done quickly as the Rar files are small and get repaired fast.
Go to your torrents program forums and ask for help there.
In this case, a big DL, many small rar files is better than reDLing the whole ISO as a complete file which may take another 2 days(?)."

Thank you Mr. Stifmeister!!

I used 7-zip File Manager to un-rar the files. You will get an ISO(s) afterwards.

Then I used PowerISO to create virtual drives and mount each ISO you get, i.e. DVD1 is one ISO to Drive(F:) and ISO from DVD2 to Drive(E:). *Driver letters may be different*

Double-click first ISO(DVD1) and follow steps to install. When it asks to insert disk 2, just click on Browse and search the virtual drive that contains the DVD2 ISO and so forth with disk 3.

At the end, you have to MERGE the Binaries folder found in DVD3 ISO.

That is what I did. Good luck."

,UnDimensional,2013-04-22T19:44Z,"HERE IS HOW TO GET THE GAME - LONG PROCESS

1.) Navigate to DVD 1
2.) Right-click on flt-bina.001 and click ""Open with""
3.) Choose Win-Rar
4.) Double click flt-bina and view files
5.) Extract ISO from flt-bina file to DVD1
6.) Repeat steps for DVD2 and DVD3, placing the extracted .ISO file in the correct DVD file
7.) Mount the .ISO file, and start the installer
8.) When the installer needs the other .ISO files, mount them
9.) Install and start game
10.) Enjoy!

,page04z,2013-05-07T07:49Z,"For all of those who don't know how to install this.

After you download, create a new folder on desktop called bioshock.

Now open WinRar, browse until you find the folder bioshock was downloaded into. Go into folder CD1, click on the first file, and then click extract to. Find the new bioshock folder you created on desktop and extract the first file in the folder to that. It will go through a 5-10 minute extraction that will convert the files into an ISO. 

Do the following for CD2 and CD3 files. Then, your new desktop folder will have the ISO's for all 3 folders. Use Daemon tools to mount the first ISO and start the installation progress.

I am still extracting my files now, so I don't know where the crack is, but each time you mount one of the ISO's, while you are installing it, go to my computer and explore the virtual drive you mounted and see where the crack is. copy the files out to your bioshock folder on desktop, until you are ready to copy them into the bioshock install folder in C:/Program Files (x86).

anyway, it should work."

There are so many reasons that files get broken when torrenting.
I don't have all the answers.
The best place to look is in the torrent client FORUM.

,AramisFI,2013-06-05T22:04Z,"I have a problem with moving in this game.
I have Razer Lycosa keyboard and I have heard that it might be the cause since it registers it as controller instead as keyboard.
So would someone have any ideas how to fix this since I can't move past the dock in the start.
Every other key works like jumping and crouching but just WASD or any other key I bind the movement on doesn't. 
And before anyone says it, I don't have synergy running.. Checked it already. Thanks guys."

Yeah, I know, it works totally fine now.
Just download the crack from mediaｆire.ｃom/?j9g9p9lpgqcckdq

Now it all works, no glitches or anything! Even the saves work fine and FPS is stable!
Thanks again for your help!"
