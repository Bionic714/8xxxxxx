Live at the Whisky is the second live recording by American rock band Kansas, released in 1992. A German version of the release contains an alternative bonus track, "Journey From Mariabronn". The album states that it was recorded in "one take," and has been criticized by some because of the harsh vocals of singer Steve Walsh, whose voice was failing at that time as a result of a variety of issues, including fatigue and substance abuse. It was the first official Kansas release (other than compilations) not to reach the album charts, and also the first not released on a major record label.
