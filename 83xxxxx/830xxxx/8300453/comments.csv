[T],[D],2013-03-26T00:34Z,"Doesn't work here with the steam version. 
The game starts fine, it makes some saves, but after you reenter the game it will crash. Deleting the saves will make it work again."

[T],[D],2013-03-26T00:48Z,"My bad on comment above.
I forgot ali.ini from the previous crack in the folder.
Make sure you use the original files before the ali123 crack.
Game works fine then, saves work fine."

,MiltoxBeyond,2013-03-26T00:57Z,So many spammers... if its not one thing its another.  Can't even spell trusted and keeps spamming that its a virus with an identical comment on each download.

,Vallencre,2013-03-26T09:52Z,"This crack didn't work for me. The first time I booted it up, it was fine. I played through the opening of the game, but once I reached the city and seen it had saved, I exited the game with the intent of seeing if the save feature was working. However, i'm unable to check, because when I reboot the game, it crashes every time at the ""push any key to continue screen""."
,kajosrus87,2013-03-26T11:38Z,for those who want to help fix this crack some reversing tools and books are provided packed tinydotcc/sfujuw
,Ienstien965,2013-03-26T12:30Z,"Works fine for me, already at monument tower brilliant game! :D"
,Mahoraba3,2013-03-26T14:28Z,"@Vallencre, That bug is caused by trying to use the Initial ALI123 crack and not putting the original files that were there before you placed the ALI123 crack in it.

If you didn't keep the files before you installed the ALI123 crack, you'll need to reinstall."
,jbysmith,2013-03-26T14:46Z,"Crashes for me as well.  Runs fine on the first playthrough, but crashes every time after that.  This is with a clean install only using the FLT release."
,cigaro56,2013-03-26T15:04Z,can confirm this works no problem. removed previous crack and added this one. save games work.
,rikipy,2013-03-26T16:30Z,"hey dont click in the pastebin link y fucking scam spam, and thsi crack works fine"
,confind,2013-03-26T18:21Z,"Mm, my monitor stops working ½ way through the game and then i have to restart (can't close the game or anything, real weird). And it keeps doing the same thing at the same point in the game when i try playing again."
,shakasiz,2013-03-26T18:51Z,"Vallencre på 2013-03-26 09:52 CET:

remove the save files and you will be able to relaunch the game. find the save game files in C:Users/your username/documents/bioshock infinite...

sooooo can anyone actually save then?

game works fine and what a game...

only problem i have with the flt crack is that i cant get my xbox controller to work, tried everything, any one got the same problem?"
,Vallencre,2013-03-26T21:01Z,Thats incorrect. I used a clean install. The ali crack was never on my computer.
,cpark02,2013-03-26T23:16Z,@Vallencre I had the same exact problem as you. What I initially tried to do was copy the save game and profile into a different folder. I opened the game and it started working again but obviously without the save. I exited the game and put the saves back into the folder and I opened the game. Somehow this fixed it and I'm not able to play my save.
,cpark02,2013-03-26T23:17Z,*now
,2nightshadow1,2013-03-27T01:15Z,I'm sorry but I don't understand how to install it >.< could anyone please tell me what I have to do.. :(
,TheDragonReborn26,2013-03-27T01:17Z,"What do you mean exactly by ""Somehow how this fixed it AND i'm not able to play my save""? Do you mean now it doesn't crash and the second time around you can play it now and save? Or do you just mean it runs every time you just never can save?"
,cpark02,2013-03-27T01:38Z,"@TheDragonReborn26 I corrected my typo with the comment after. I meant ""Somehow this fixed it and I'm now able to play my save."""
,supershick,2013-03-27T03:45Z,I did a virustotal scan on the steam file and it came back with 2 virus hits. This file safe?
,Vallencre,2013-03-27T05:04Z,"@cpark02 I've checked every conceivable place on my computer for the save game file and i've turned up nothing. It either doesn't exist, or they've put it in a random folder that nothing else would ever use for a save game. I mean I systematically went through all the spots you'd expect to find a save. Thanks for trying to help anyways. I guess i'll wait until someone makes a crack that doesn't require a bunch of fucking around to work."
,AegisFate,2013-03-27T06:18Z,does anyone have tearing with this game on fullscreen 1920 x 1080 ultra settings?
,MLO89,2013-03-27T08:47Z,Don't know why some are saying this crack doesn't work or doesn't save. It works and saves perfectly for me.
,crixtoh,2013-03-27T12:19Z,@Vallencre i had the same problem. Go to BioShockInfinite.exe - Properties - Compatibility - Windows Vista [Service Pack 2] Work for me.
,inseface,2013-03-27T17:39Z,"WORKED PERFECTLY with Windows 7 64 bit 
and without saving problems
used this version https://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8299592/Bioshock_Infinite_Full_UNLOCKED

only problem - can't select dlcs in the menu.. anyone got a solution"
,Mahoraba3,2013-03-27T17:46Z,"@Vallencre, there's a ""ProgramData"" Folder that is hidden by default and its always on the windows directory (C:).

Open up My Computer and copy this into the address bar at the top, alot of the time this is where my saves go for most games, I still don't have this downloaded after two days now so I can't check.

C:ProgramData"
,stephenwanck,2013-03-27T23:56Z,"@Vallencre  Go to BioShockInfinite.exe - Properties - Compatibility - Windows Vista [Service Pack 2] 
This works...oddly it works even if u check on Win7 compatibility (which i was using before the loading bug)"
,Grimmomega,2013-03-28T01:12Z,"Ok, my game keeps crashing at a certain point in the game. It's on the level ""The Hooks"". Any idea how to fix this?"

,sajuuk17,2013-03-28T17:03Z,"Got the same issue as @Vallencre.
Got a clean install from FLT torrent. Got the FLT crack.
Applied the crack.
Always crash before the end of the Irrational Games logo intro vid."
,SynysterChaos7,2013-03-28T23:52Z,"For those of you who have the problem where you can't load your save or the menu, what crixtoh said earlier works. Run the game in vista service pack 2 compatibility. Thanks crixtoh. Tested and working and i can load my saves!!!"

,bbhaag,2013-03-30T02:15Z,Thanks!  Worked great.
,Solemnily,2013-03-31T01:36Z,"The crack works great. Already halfway through the game with opening/closing it multiple times.

I must warn you though if you use the VirtuMVP software you must disable the Virtual Vsync or it will crash your game. This caused me some trouble today."
,FLHSRB33,2013-03-31T01:58Z,"I have a weird issue, the past few days Ive played the game just fine, today I was playing it and my comp overheated, as it has in the past, I restarted had to launch a windows repair, upon completion tried to boot the game and it freezes in the beginning logo screen, deleted the logo sequences no dice, downloaded the crack again and replaced the files no dice, changed compatability mode to service pack 2 XP no dice, any ideas?"
,Drag0n1gaL,2013-04-04T13:52Z,"CHECK HERE for the most annoying problem,every torrent i download,when i run the game,at main menu 'press any button to continue' it crashes,with every crack and every torrent (flt/blackbox/skidrow) and i dont know what to do!any solves?"
,souly420,2013-04-05T06:33Z,"YOU ARE COMSTOCK, ELIZABETH IS YOUR DAUGHTER.

Enjoy the game :) 

I pirate lots of games, however this game deserves your money for the hard ass work they put into it to. You do nothing but punish one of the very few game studios left out there who gives a fuck about quality over $$

Eat shit and die assholes"

That was completely unnecessary."
