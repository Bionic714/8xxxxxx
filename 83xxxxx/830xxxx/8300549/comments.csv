,Agandaur,2013-03-26T01:17Z,"Also i wanted to say that FLT isn't so reliable as RELOADED, their releases always have chrases and bug-problems.
Nevertheless thank you FLT, for bringing all these games to me otherwise i would not play them because i don't want to pay. I'm a piratefag."

I am downloading what I believe was one of the first torrents for this game. It's Bioshock Infinite UNLOCKED, I'm at 22%. Is there any reason I should remove it and download this one?
Other than the fact that it's extremezone?"

,unreadable33,2013-03-26T04:09Z,Thanks extremezone.. I was dling another torrent and then came back to see if you had uploaded it yet. Low and behold you have and removed that torrent and I'm dling yours now. Of the 25-30 PC games I've gotten from you I've never once have had an issue with your releases. Thanks in advance. I know this is gonna be awesome. I will seed for a week or 2.

,acedeathz,2013-03-26T04:46Z,"@extremezone Please get me a help :(
Nowadays every single torrent that I download was just damn slow. What's the problem that caused this problem occur?My max download speed is 100kb/s but nowadays 10-15kb/s.

,Viperdude,2013-03-26T05:25Z,"Seriously, Does this include the dlc's?"
,happyfarm,2013-03-26T05:36Z,Seems like people are either not finishing the download or they are getting 100% and immediately removing the torrent because this seed/leech ratio is abhorrent.
,lockerxzx,2013-03-26T05:43Z,@MLO89 it's 18gb because it's uncompressed. 15gb is compressed version. No real difference there
,bl4kk_mh4mb4,2013-03-26T06:26Z,slow?? its a new torrent!....stop whinning!...download rate will increase eventually if all upload/seed unlimited!!

Danke for upload EZ"
,Charby,2013-03-26T15:16Z,"@lucabara
That doesn't make any sense... In the time you wait you could have very well had it downloaded and not to mention the great service of seeding the whole time. If everyone waited a couple days then no one would be seeding."

I haven't loaded a crack yet, so it's just giving me the autosave option, which is fine for now.

EZTV torrents reach 1000s of seeders, and I have always gotten close to my max speed, which is 3Mbps.  Music torrents always reach peak speeds.  But whenever I try to DL ANY large torrent like this, it moves like a tortoise, regardless of the number of seeders.  Speeds this abysmal leave me no choice but to buy a premium account at a filehosting site. *smh*

,jlocust,2013-03-28T09:11Z,"It's only running slow because their are 3x the amount of leechers - 9489 currently vs 2144 seeders... This a new release and is a hot game that a lot of people pounced all over the second it was released, so the download is running slower then your used to. Im not having an issue at the moment myself, the longer you leave it connected the better chances you will connect to more seeds... Be patient with the DL or return at another time when the SEED/LEECH ratio is a bit more balanced... This torrent is WAYYYYY better then some of the others... Ive seen 31,000 Leechers vs 5000 Seeds on other torrents for this. 1 seed uploading to 20 leechers causes all the leechers to go slow after they can't leech off each other... SIMPLE. PATIENCE. OR COME BACK LATER WHEN MORE SEEDS. GREAT UPLOAD IM SURE, THANKS. EXTREMEZONE IS THE ONE OF THE ONLY I TRUST AND WORKS EVERY TIME!!!"

For Those Having Trouble With The 3 DVDs (like ME) I Found This ( By bongars 1967 )
This Worked For Me  ON  Win 7 Ultimate 64bit

-----INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS-----
BEFORE INSTALLATION I RECOMMEND HAVING WINRAR FOR THIS.

1). After download locate the BioShock_Infinite-FLT folder.

2). Go to the folder DVD1, right click the first file named ""flt-bina"" and open with Winrar

3). Extract the file named ""flt-bina.iso"" to anywhere you'd prefer.

4). After extraction do this for the remaining two folders, named DVD2 and DVD3.

5). Now mount flt-bina that's located in DVD1 with your preferred program, and install. Do this for the remaining two discs.
 (It'll ask for the next disc, click browse and locate where the disc is mounted, it'll say Bioshock disc 1, 2 or 3)

6). Locate the crack in Disc 3 and patch over in BioShock InfiniteBinariesWin32, or whenever you've installed the game.

7) Play!

If The Screen Flickers Drop The Res to 1280 x 720

1.  If you have the x64 error (program not designed for this version of windows 64 bit)

you probably havent installed the crack in the ""fairlight"" folder on DVD3  (its not mentioned in the fairlight.nfo included)

2.  Game crashes when you launch after autosaving.

Open folder containing cracked ""bioshockinfinite.exe"" in your installed copy.  go to properties and under the ""compatability"" tab run it in compatibilty mode for your version of windows.

These two steps got it running on both my win7 64 bit machines.  Hope they help those struggling.

Thanks for another great upload EZ"

,aoxo,2013-04-08T06:10Z,"Those asking if this ""works on 64 bit"", why wouldn't it?  Most of the programs you run on a 64 bit OS already run at 32 bits.  I ran the other FLT release thats 3gb smaller download with absolutely 0 problems on win 7 64.  Finished the game without a single crash or hiccup of any sort.  I can't say why this torrent appears to be identical except for an extra 3gb.  Someone probably fucked with the archives to insert something...text files, links, virii...and re-compressed it in a less efficient manner.  Whatever the case, this one might work but I personally suggest using the stiffmiester version because it' will save you time and bandwidth and because I know for a fact it works..  Not that I don't appreciate EZ releases, but theres no sense downloading 3gb more than necessary.

As for other problems running the game, all .DLL problems are generally related to DirectX.  Download and run the dx web installer from Microsoft...don't try to hunt down those dll files from unknown sources.  Rundll32.exe will execute those dll files as programs, so go to the source, it's safer.

Game crashing on startup problems, if not related to DX, are generally video related.  Update your video drivers at www.ati.com or www.nvidia.com.  Make sure you aren't overclocking anything or question the stability of the OC.

If you still can't launch the game, try disabling antivirus realtime scanning.  AV can sometimes interfere with new programs and games due to heuristics scanning.  Some suggest compatibility modes...these are dumb suggestions the game was designed to run on win7/8.  Some also say that having steam running interfered and closing and reopening steam ""as admin"" worked.  Running a program with admin privileges is an option that is made available for legacy programs that are not able to properly handle UAC (user account control)..it is not some magical fix all.  If the program in question is newer than your operating system then you most likely do not need to do this.  Relaunching steam or even closing it down is worth trying perhaps.

Make sure you applied the crack properly.  Make sure you chose to overwrite existing files when you copied it.

Close any unnecessary running programs that you can, at least to test if they are contributing to your problems.

Finally ask yourself if you computer is capable of running this game at all.  Check min system requirements."
