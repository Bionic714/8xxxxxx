"The Wild Rover"

When a man is found dead in an industrial 
cake mixer, Castle and Beckett trace the 
murder to an Irish gang in Staten Island 
and a beautiful bar owner named Siobhan 
O'Doul. Much to everyone's surprise, 
Detective Ryan has a complicated history 
with Siobhan and the Staten Island crime 
family from his days working undercover in 
narcotics. When the case hits a dead end, 
Ryan must go back undercover to expose the 
killer, complicating his relationship with 
his wife.
