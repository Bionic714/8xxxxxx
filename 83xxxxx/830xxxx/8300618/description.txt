Information
------------------------------

As seen through the eyes of world-famous photographer Heidi Hollinger, we set off to discover vibrant port cities and capture their true essence and soul. Settled centuries ago when boat travel was the only means of communication, these ports have developed into commercial and cultural metropolises, rich in their unique history. Native and new residents alike share with us the love and charm each city has to offer.
