Problem downloading. I tried 2 times but utorrent was stuck at ""connecting to peers"".

Uninstalled & reinstalled utorrent.
3rd time - same problem.

Am currently downloading other TPB torrent at fast speed. (seems to be just this one that has this problem)

I'm at the limit of my skills (didn't take much). Any suggestions?"
