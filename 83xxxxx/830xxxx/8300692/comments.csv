,SOPASUX,2013-03-26T19:30Z,I don't even give props for the upload. It just clutters PB with crap links.
,SOPASUX,2013-03-26T19:32Z,"""UNPOPULAR is a lame P2P group. We have a few drawbacks such as releasing late and in low quality. We're in it for the fun and not to please you.""

In other words, you're asshole losers who get their jollies from cluttering up the Internet with dogshit quality videos.

Noted!"

,SOPASUX,2013-03-27T03:47Z,"Well, join the 21st Century, idiot. Who would want to look at a crappy low-rez like this?"
[T],MrUnpopular,2013-03-27T04:47Z,"Over 20,000 people have downloaded a single release of ours.

So I think that answers your question."
,ebbelpoo,2013-03-28T17:26Z,Thanks for the upload.
,SOPASUX,2013-03-29T18:42Z,"And millions of people go eat at McDonald's you retard. It's still shitty food, and your uploads are still shit quality."
,TorrentBeast887,2013-04-05T15:43Z,DUDE WTH. You should just like stop releasing episodes. It's such low quality and sometimes I can't even load or see anything out of your shitty vids. Please stop uploading man. Just stop :(
,TorrentBeast887,2013-04-05T15:45Z,SOPASUX SPEAKS THE TRUTH. AMEN. Only desperate people watch this shit. Why don't you go join the 21st century? What you too old to do that? PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE upload at least something that's actually not shit
