Editorial Reviews
MUSIC FROM ANOTHER DIMENSION presents AEROSMITH in ferociously fine form and at the peak of their powers. They're the only band of their stature with all-original members who are playing better than they ever have before. The album abounds with one highlight after another, including "Out Go The Lights," "Oh Yeah," "Luv XXX," "We All Fall Down," "Street Jesus" and "Can t Stop Loving You," on which Tyler duets with Carrie Underwood. The album also includes "Freedom Fighter" which features Johnny Depp on backing vocals. 
It marks the band's 15th studio album and their first studio album of all-new material in 11 years. The album was recorded in Los Angeles and at the band s studio in Massachusetts; it was produced by Jack Douglas, Steven Tyler and Joe Perry, with the exception of three tracks produced by Tyler and Marti Frederiksen. 
"This is the album we wanted to make since the band got back together in 1984," JOE PERRY says. "Can't complain about number one singles or album-driven sold-out world tours, as we blaze the Aerosmith trail with our fans. But this is the record that when the five of us are in a room yelling turn up the volume, that room could be 1325 Commonwealth Avenue.
