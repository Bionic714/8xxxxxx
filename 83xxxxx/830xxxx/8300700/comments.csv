Can someone help me with the installation please?
Many thanks in advance!

Any help would be appreciated"
,lucifer_9mm,2013-03-28T16:38Z,"@peps178 what are you talkin about? this rip only has a single .iso file, check your download folder you probably mistake it for another incomplete torrent, mount bioshock_infinite_repack.iso and follow installation, just remember to uncheck russian language text"
,lucifer_9mm,2013-03-28T16:40Z,"excellent torrent, easy installation and a great game, big thanks to uploader :)"
,peps178,2013-03-28T18:52Z,"@lucifer_9mm
ow, then I know where the fault is. Thanks! "
,Suriza,2013-03-29T01:35Z,"As soon as your download is complete, please continue to seed. Don't be a freeloading leecher."
,yappie,2013-03-30T21:20Z,"WOW! 20% then some more leechers come in, please go away for a couple of hours and I promise I'll seed."
,sjobakk,2013-03-30T23:09Z,So it downloaded and installed just fine but there is no audio? 
,spidasense,2013-04-01T06:00Z,learn to seed on big releases like this. 1:10 ratios? that's unacceptable!
