[T],SCSA420,2013-03-26T10:59Z,This movie is a BAD MF'er and if you don't agree then you have your head shoved up your candy ass. Quentin Tarentino won the Oscar for Best Screenplay and Christoph Waltz won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. This  was BETTER then Argo was.

,yogdagon,2013-06-08T15:31Z,"Thanx. V-10, A-10, M-7. I seed for 3 months."
,ninth1der,2013-06-08T20:04Z,"V 9.5 (a couple of frame drops makes a couple scenes glitch a tiny bit)
A 10.0 Perfect DTS encode! 
M 3.0 (Q Tarantino tried to make a tribute to the Clint Eastwood ""spaghetti westerns and failed.  I think he should have turned left at Albuquerque [strikethrough] Kill Bill)

And YIFY rips are fine if you want to watch them on your laptop or iTampon (imean iPad) and only have 2 channel headphones.  But dear gawd I DL'ed about half a dozen of his files before I figured it out.  

I think that PB.se should have a protocol that your upload file name should include resolution and audio data
