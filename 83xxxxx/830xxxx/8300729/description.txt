Windows 7 Ultimate SP1 64-bit
Windows 7 Enterprise / N

Pro and Pro N versions are from a Retail image and will need to be
set to a gVLK key if you use them with a KMS activator. You can do this by
running admin command prompt commands:

slmgr /ipk FJ82H-XT6CR-J8D7P-XQJJ2-GPDD4
(for Pro)

slmgr /ipk MRPKT-YTG23-K7D7T-X2JMM-QY7MG
(Pro N)

Microsoft Toolkit's EZ-Activator option will do this for you, but it
installs AutoKMS, which is less desirable than KMS Server Service.

This ISO has an EFI boot sector for use on UEFI systems. You need
to convert your HD to GPT during setup by pressing shift-f10 and running
diskpart. The actual commands would be something like:

diskpart
list disk
select disk 1
clean
convert gpt (you can convert mbr later if needed on a cleaned drive)
exit
exit (to exit cmd prompt)

I have added Activator and Security Essentials Folder. If
you install the files in there, read the instructions. In my
testing, Windows Loader worked with a GPT hard drive, but if
it doesn't work for you, try using Microsoft Toolkit and a
Professional / N / Enterprise / N index.

(Thanks to CODYQX4 and Daz for their Activators)
