"The Blood from the Stones"

An undercover police officer, who was 
investigating a string of ATM 
robberies, turns up dead in a van 
with a bag of diamonds found inside 
his mutilated body. So the 
Jeffersonian team must figure out 
whether or not the ATM robbers are 
also murderers, or if the cop was 
crooked. Meanwhile, Brennan is the 
subject of a documentary commissioned 
to raise funds for the Jeffersonian, 
and she struggles to be likeable on 
camera.
