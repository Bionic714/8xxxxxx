Also being an avid FS enthusiast, Aerosoft said that those with megascenery Las Vegas installed which I do, they recommend removing certain files from that add-on. I wonder if the duplicate items have to do with activating the scenery from the launcher."

I would assume you just need to layer this higher than megascenery or rename bgl files that refer to aerial or ground to .off"
