This is the same version as the one up here from _snakeye but I was able to play with the bgl and texture files to make all the scenery appear and also remove the duplicate scenery at KLAS such as signs in the middle of the runway. There are still some duplicate buildings in the city but not very noticeable in my opinion. Credit to _snakeye for the original files. Step 4 in the instructions is a new step to follow vs the original upload.
