,kakuichi1,2013-03-26T14:03Z,"Have you seen any of the 3-part Heavy Metal Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse Graphic Novel set.  I read the 1st 2, but I can't find the last part.  Thanks for everything!"
,Jebeker,2013-03-26T16:02Z,"@STFmaryville  thanks.

I found all the issues except for #6 (2010) in 0-day downloads."

[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-27T01:15Z,"alright kakuichi1, can YOU tell me if these comics (file names below) might be single issues which are collected in the 3rd graphic novel? in other words, is it possible that book 1 and book 2 collected editions of the first 6 issues?

,kakuichi1,2013-03-27T07:20Z,"Honestly, I didn't know that they were released as single issues.  It must have been after the graphic novels were released.  I read the 1st 2 novels (helldiver & the chosen).  I wasn't able to find the 3rd & I tried to search out the singles & they don't even turn up in google.

Here's the website I was referring to about the graphic novels:  http://fourhorsemen.heavymetal.com/

the main site doesn't even mention the single issues.  thanks anyways."
,kakuichi1,2013-03-27T07:25Z,"ok, it looks like the single issues were released after the books were released.  so, it seems that you're correct."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-27T12:19Z,"that makes sense. i can get you the 3rd book, it will just be in the form of those 3 issues. sorry i didn't respond to your request earlier, but now you can see why! it's been a bit confusing.

will post them in a few hours. by the way, i read part of the 1st g.n. last night -- very good stuff! bisley's an old favorite."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-27T14:56Z,"here ya go, kakuichi: http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8306941/

just let me know by commenting on that torrent, if those 3 issues don't finish your collection."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-28T01:28Z,"hey everyone, HELLBLAZER #1-300, high-quality new scans, thanks to the amazing Empire scanners and shipJ!!!

,superdom4,2013-03-31T06:37Z,"Thanks for the comics, Can i make a request please. Do you think you could please 1-20 of the comic/manga of Case Closed. Theres none around and Case Closed is in my top 5 favorite shows, so it would be good to read the comic. Also one last thing if it helps Case Closed's japanese name is Detective Conan"
,hellblazer02,2013-04-09T03:21Z,Thanks. Are you uploading more Vertigo comics  specifically those that are link to The Sandman and/or Hellblazer like The Books of Magic?
