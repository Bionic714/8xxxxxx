Meet the Trenchcoat Brigade -- the Phantom Stranger, John Constantine, Doctor Occult, and the dangerously unstable Mister E -- powerful magic-based heroes who unite for a darkly humorous four-issue limited series!

This miniseries was posted here on TPB before, most recently by the legendary LeonardTSpock about 7 months back. However these are new 1920px HD scans from Son of Ultron-Empire, and since the cancellation of Vertigo's Hellblazer and DC's relaunch of Constantine as a New 52 series, I think people will enjoy reading these.

Please seed and share with our friends here on TPB!  --STFmaryville
