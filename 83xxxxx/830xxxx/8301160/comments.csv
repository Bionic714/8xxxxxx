I have a question for you, a while back you uploaded a movie ""Planet of Dinosaurs"" happens to be one of my favorite childhood movies.  Unfortunately it appears as though this torrent has died :(  Any chance you guys could seed it for a little bit, in return I will never let it die.  I looked for a way to get in contact with you other than this, but couldn't find one.  I will probably post this on several of your newer torrents so I make sure you guys see it, I know how the commenting goes around here so I'm sorry in advance, I'm not spamming."
