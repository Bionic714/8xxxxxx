,IAmTorrenter,2013-04-01T06:34Z,"installs completely fine, but when i go to play the game it says cannot run on virtual machine?

im not using a virtual machine, and i uninstalled VMware which was my only virtual machine (which i never ended up using) but still getting the same thing.
anyone?"
,barmite,2013-05-08T16:39Z,"I start the game, select English before the application goes into full-screen mode, and it remains as a black screen. Have I installed it incorrectly?
I ran the setup wizard, then copied the contents of the ""DATA"" folder over to the game directory in my C drive.

I have tried running it several times, but to no success."
