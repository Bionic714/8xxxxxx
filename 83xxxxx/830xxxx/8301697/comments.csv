[T],SCSA420,2013-03-26T11:03Z,This movie is a BAD MF'er and if you don't agree then you have your head shoved up your candy ass. Quentin Tarentino won the Oscar for Best Screenplay and Christoph Waltz won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. This was BETTER then Argo was.
,panemoj,2013-03-26T11:09Z,"You have movies with best quality, but, sadly, worst seeders..."
,fookju,2013-03-26T15:09Z,thx
,Faviolo,2013-03-26T18:46Z,Fuck YIFY
,RENJP,2013-03-26T23:20Z,"Subtitles...: English

No sub file inside, so assuming it's hardcoded."
,Deurbell,2013-03-26T23:22Z,I agree fully on the point that his movie is better then Argo is! Thank you Bozx

,Shadow416,2013-03-27T00:09Z,"i fucking hated Argo lol


Seems like people are settling for the shittier audio quality [yify], the number of seeders is dreadfully low in comparison"
,stianen!,2013-03-27T01:17Z,"I always use this search string:
720p -yify -web*
and searching only in HD movies.
Who wants lower quality?! I have 8 TB diskspace! :D"
,sjw71,2013-03-27T03:19Z,"Thanks BOZX much appreciated.
Great quality & a great flick."
,2HardRain,2013-03-27T06:17Z,"Argo was ok, but this movie does slay it, no questions. Oscars are just political, I stopped caring about them long ago."
[T],SCSA420,2013-03-27T11:25Z,If it doesn't have DTS audio or if its from Yify then it is inferior compared to Sparks releases.
,JNA1313,2013-03-28T07:09Z,"Tarantino is the man! Such a great movie!
Those complaining about seeders, stfu! Bozx has the best movies, period! Who cares if it takes a day or two? Give it a year and hopefully others will have the space we do!
Thank you Bozx

,imsharkbait,2013-04-04T21:48Z,"Another craptacular film by Tarentino, he should go back to directing school.  Lost respect for Tarentino after Inglorius Basterds.

,jesuisnate,2013-04-13T22:01Z,"Around the manor shootout scene, the song sounds horrendously tinny and digital. I don't remember if that's how it sounded in theaters or if it's an issue with with compression, but it sounds awful."
,frostbite91,2013-04-19T12:51Z,"idk whats up but for 12 gigs the video is sub-par. id rate it between dvd and bluray quality. and the audio is distorted. like the preamp was cranked up during conversion. and dont blame my computer. im a total audiophile. i live and breathe music, and i have a keen sense for sound quality. to put it simple, im just gunna redbox this... maybe i'll convert it properly w/ dvd fab 9 and upload it for you guys."
