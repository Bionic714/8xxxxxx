A smart and witty take on strategy... an essential business topic.

Every day, millions of professionals around the world discuss strategy, and they assume that everyone else in the room defines "strategy" the same way. But they don't. Howell J. Malham Jr. has created a book that goes straight to the heart of the issue. Through the largely facetious dialog of two colorful characters, this clever, irreverent book seeks to get everyone in the room on the same page using the same definitions for the same words. This is a crucial first step to any business proposition, yet it is often the most overlooked.

* A highly readable book that defines the most over-used (and least understood) business term: strategy
* Author is the co-founder of Insight Labs
* Written in a wry style, this book offers a witty, inventive take on a common business problem

At a time when business in general is groping in the dark for new solutions to persistent problems, this book is a breath of fresh air, reminding readers that they have to build a foundation before they can scale the walls.

"This is the Stratocaster of strategy."
--Scott Goldman, vice president, MusiCares Foundation, GRAMMY Foundation

"Everyone knows what strategy is; according to this book, that's the problem. I Have a Strategy (No You Don't) dislodges conventional thinking about strategy in a way that is creative and provocative, playful and serious at the same time. Malham appreciates how globalization has changed the game; our thinking about strategy needs to change with it. What a clever book."
--Frank J. Barrett, PhD, professor of management and organizational behavior, Naval Postgraduate School

"This is a highly entertaining and educational book. Understanding the concept of strategy is more essential than ever before. And it's even better to learn it through the fascinating approach that Howell Malham demonstrates in this must-read."
--Michael Fassnacht, president, Draftfcb Chicago
