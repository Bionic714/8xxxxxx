Dani Jensen & Marie McCray - The LolliCock Shop
Added: March 26, 2013

Johnny feels like an idiot in the dumb costume he has to wear at his candy shop job. He's having a bad day - until Marie and Dani arrive, that is. These naughty redhead teens love his costume, and help themselves to all the sweets the store has to offer. But what they're really looking for is a lollipop big enough for them to share, and Johnny has exactly what their looking for.
