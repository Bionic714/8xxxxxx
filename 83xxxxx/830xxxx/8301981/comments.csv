,chaostastic,2013-03-26T18:03Z,"I'm just wondering why there are 2 bitdepth movies in each upload lately? Both are 1280 x 720 mp4 and one with an extra dot in the name before the extension have 5891 kbit/s bitrate and is just 15% smaller than the other without the extra dot which has 7047 kbit/s. 

If possible just post the one with the higher bitrate. Thank you for your great posts, both S2 & M!  "

Lately we have found and uploaded MP4 + iPod mp4 which is ususally much smaller. Why todays 2 were so similar in size I still dont know, but with the constant request for smaller files I decided to just include both.

Downloaded, created torrent and uploaded this mornig before work with my breakfast in one hand and toothbrush in the other, so forgive me if I didnt have time to email SB.com and ask em :) hehe"
,chaostastic,2013-03-28T13:19Z,"Shallow2, I've missed that part of the torrent text. My apologies. Your call to include both were possibly the wisest. Too much data is better than too little.

Thank you for GREAT posts! You're spoiling us unfortunately. :-)
