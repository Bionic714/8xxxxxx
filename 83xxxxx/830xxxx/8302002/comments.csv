,klord2010,2013-03-26T08:50Z,nice! thx.
,Kona_Guy,2013-03-26T09:01Z,Thanks
,H215,2013-03-26T09:06Z,Does this crack fix not being able to save?
,Daestoga,2013-03-26T09:16Z,Can we save?
[V],Gh0stNet,2013-03-26T09:25Z,yes this crack saves 
,Viperdude,2013-03-26T09:29Z,I don't care about the dlc's for now because they don't add more story content. I'll play the dlc's once they release ones that give you other stories.
,Daestoga,2013-03-26T09:42Z,How do we save on the game anyways? I cant find it in the ESC menu
,OmniNegro,2013-03-26T09:43Z,"Why the fuck would skidrow be a directory used by a 3DM crack?

This sounds wrong for more reasons than jut that..."
,smanukin,2013-03-26T09:57Z,"OmniNegro, it's just a SKIDROW emu, 3DM use it very often."
,Machine4578,2013-03-26T11:25Z,"@OmniNegro
exactly what smanukin said, 3DM uses the SKIDROW steam emu all the time, and most of 3DM's latest cracks saves are all in the appdata SKIDROW folder(which is a good thing if SKIDROW releases a crack, you wont need to move the saves)"
,steve30x,2013-03-26T11:57Z,My game wont start with this crack and the ALI213 crack wont allow me to save
,OmniNegro,2013-03-26T17:08Z,"Thanks for the clarification guys. Yeah,  I knew about 3DM using skidrow stuff before from other cracks in the past. I just forgot. :("
,jbysmith,2013-03-26T20:13Z,@Daestoga -- This one uses a checkpoint save system.  Probably my only complaint with the game.
,Beowulf6666,2013-03-26T21:57Z,i do not understand the instructions on how to make the game save properly...can any1 please clarify with a step by step?
,Beowulf6666,2013-03-26T22:39Z,well to clarify...i did fix the game to save...but placing the save in the 8870 folder (in that specified location) doesn't load that up.
,mgbeach,2013-03-27T03:31Z,"thanks, this is working absolutely perfectly with Win7x64"
,Vallencre,2013-03-27T06:26Z,"Works great, no crash on second launching of the game, saves working fine. Thanks."
,Aabir11,2013-03-27T07:32Z,I was right.All the games that haven't save because the save files were hidden 
,Jk24,2013-03-27T18:12Z,How do I get to the game directory?
,ishkar,2013-03-28T14:13Z,"When I try to launch the game I'm getting this error: ""The procedure entry point CreateInterface could not be located in the dynamic link library C:Program Files (x86)Bioshock InfiniteBinariesWin32steam_api.dll."" Any suggestions?"
,tcmike,2013-03-28T19:27Z,so... i moved my save file from my other skidrow folder  to 8870 skidrow folder and the save file isnt found by bioshock when i click play. How do i fix this?
,noobdima,2013-04-01T16:07Z,"i'm in a bit of a problem... i download this torrent and after 10 seconds it changes the torrent's status to ""checked 0.0%"" and the availability bar turns red ...
what to do about it?"
,souly420,2013-04-05T06:37Z,"YOU ARE COMSTOCK, ELIZABETH IS YOUR DAUGHTER.

Enjoy the game :) 

I pirate lots of games, however this game deserves your money for the hard ass work they put into it to. You do nothing but punish one of the very few game studios left out there who gives a fuck about quality over $$

Eat shit and die assholes"
,D3v1n23,2013-04-05T23:53Z,Noobdima try closeing your torrent client i mean shutting it down and then re-run it
,SpockGuy,2013-04-08T11:00Z,"@souly420 ""I pirate a lot of games"". Give a round of applause."
,Vitero,2013-04-10T14:26Z,no dice. Quit seeding
,rowsol,2013-04-12T13:58Z,"Thanks Souly, I wanted to know that before playing the game."

Okay, so you know the user souly420? Who, on this very page, posted the biggest spoiler of the best game of this generation because of some pathetic self-righteousness against pirates even though he admitted in the same comment to downloading games himself? I downloaded the game and I'm buying it too, but because of souly420, the experience was ever so slightly ruined for me (And nothing should ever taint the game of a lifetime, especially not some pretentious smug twat), as I'm sure it was for many people as well.
