,TT7LB7,2013-03-27T09:50Z,"footy:

what program do you use to envode the video?  is the source initially in 50fps or do you encode it that way?"
,ralts_jt,2013-03-27T16:22Z,"Footy! You are doing an absolutely awesome job with the F1 releases! We are absolutely grateful you spend your time and money to make the entire races available to us!!!
I personally have collected all the releases under 2012 and 2013 720p50fps. I always eagerly wait for your uploads.
I have a couple of queries that I would like you to indulge in for a few minutes:
I collect F1 races for archival reason, which means I simply love the pristine value of the 720p videos coupled with 50fps (Sports belong in this framerate). The 5.1 audio is the perfect final touch. I also have as a preference, to combine all 3 parts: Pre-Race - Race - Post-Race, into one single file; to keep things tidier.
There is not a problem in removing the UKR and RUS audio, but, I seem to be having tons of trouble with the Commentary track. Pre-Race audio is perfect. Race audio seems to me: a bit off the mark. Generally the commentary remains in the Center Channel, but within these two races, they seem to be spread across Left, Center and Right channels....kinda making it a teeny tiny bit weird to listen to on my Home Theater system setup. It sounds very like the audio has been upmixed from DD2.0 to DD5.1, which is likely knowing posts over the net about the trouble of sky broadcasts as they switch between DD5.1 to DD2.0 in adverts. Same happens at the Post Race: which is uncanny, knowing that the audio sounds fine in pre-race but not so fine in post. The audio from other releases available online seem to have the 5.1 audio pretty sorted, but are available in 25fps which looks dull compared to your releases.
Have you any recommendations (possibly apart form getting my own sky connection :P which is unavailable where I live, in India), to sort out the audio?
P.S.: Thank you for keeping the video free of watermarks.
Looking forward to a fabulous F1 season"
