No reviews available for this newest album from the band Bush. Personally i like it, powerful sound, good alternative rock.
"This is the audio of the new DVD/Blu-ray from the British alternative rock band Bush. Some acoustic songs are added to the Roseland concert. You can't see but you can hear and use your imagination. One thing you will notice for sure is the female audience going crazy like this was a Beatles, Backstreet Boys or f*cking Justin Bieber concert. I'm glad rock music still has those same effects of pop music and to see that some old adolescence songs are still followed today."
