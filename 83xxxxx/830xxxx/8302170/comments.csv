,FS_Junkie,2013-03-26T13:05Z,Many thanks for the upload :-). I take it the original file marked 1.01 is actually 1.00 (and we therefore need this patch)?
,sososo93,2013-03-26T13:38Z,"@FS_Junkie
yes you need this patch because if you read the first post you see i say i have made a error on the title FARO 1.01 lool sorry its not faro but 1.00 UK 2000 LEEDS "

,Karlskrone,2013-03-26T22:39Z,Installation hind: If your PAPI-Lights doesn´t work: Delete the UK2000 Common Library in your FSX-Scenery Database (Do not delete it in Your Harddisk!!!)and register it in your Scenery-Database again. It will help !!!
