Lost Worlds: Series 1
Dig into the sands of time with this exploration into lost civilizations. Scientists, archaeologists, and historians alike search for evidence of cities that may have forever been lost to time. Some are ancient while some are surprisingly recent. Journey back to Jerusalem when Christ walked through its streets. Explore the mysteries of the Knights Templar. See Egypt when Ramses ruled and discover what it looked like in Braveheart's Scotland. Recent cities include Winston Churchill's secret bunkers and a Welthauptstadt Germania that Hitler envisioned. Graphic recreations and location shots bring these cities to life.




8)  Braveheart's Scotland 
Scotland, the end of the 13th century, a country under attack. Invaded by the greatest army in Christendom, defeat seems inevitable. But from nowhere emerges a man who will become Scotland's greatest hero. William Wallace, later known as Braveheart, he is an inspirational leader who will give his life for Scotland's freedom. New research allows us to journey back to the lost world that Braveheart fought for. A violent age when magnificent castles were built to withstand a new generation of weapons, where kings built heavily fortified towns. This is also a golden age of culture and sophistication. Travelling down secret pathways that still lie beneath modern Scotland, we reveal a world that has not been seen for 700 years. This is the lost world of Braveheart, the world he died to protect.
