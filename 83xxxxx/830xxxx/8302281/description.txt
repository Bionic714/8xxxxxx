Pros and Cons: A Debaters Handbook offers a unique and invaluable guide to current controversies, providing material for debate on a wide range of topics. Arguments for and against each subject appear in adjacent columns for easy comparison, and related topics and suggestions for possible motions are listed at the end of each entry. Since its publication in 1896 the handbook has been regularly updated and this eighteenth edition includes new issues such as censorship of the internet, genetic engineering and the legalisation of prostitution. The introductory essay describes debating technique, covering the rules, structure and type of debate, and offering tips on how to become a successful speaker. The book is then divided into eight thematic sections, where specific subjects are covered individually.
