Ep 19: Finale

PREMIERE: Monday March 25, 8:00 pm

While Lisa prepares to renew her vows after thirty years of marriage, her housewarming party plummets downhill. Faye picks a fight with Lisa, and when all the ladies get involved, Lisa realizes Kyle will never have her back. Kyle is not safe from Kim's ire either, but luckily Lisa and Ken's vow renewal ceremony interrupts the drama for one lovely moment. And when a tearful Adrienne shows up, on the very day her separation has been announced, some of the women stand behind her, while some are not as sympathetic.
