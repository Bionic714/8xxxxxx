This album is mastered for iTunes. Delta Machine is the 13th studio album from the pioneering synth-pop and electro group Depeche Mode. Songwriter Martin Gore described it as a hybrid of Violator and Songs of Faith and Devotion. The single "Heaven" confirms these comparisons - it's full of shadowy, slow-drip synthesizer, buzzing guitar and David Gahan's primal vocal treatment. They're elder statesmen of the genre; you can't spell EDM without DM.
