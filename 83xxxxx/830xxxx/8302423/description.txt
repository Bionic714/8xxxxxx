I would like to continue the Star Wars Saga, with the ENG scanlation of Fazekas' The Empire Strikes Back from 1982.


This one is only in one booklet, as it was originally released in Hungary, back in 1982. Please remember, this was the first, among the Hungarian un-licensed Star Wars Comics, and it was the success of this one, which convinced the authors to come out with Star Wars: Episode IV in a 2 booklets format, a bit later, but the same year, in 1982 also.

As for the ENG text, I followed suits with the previous one, so I used the aXXo Rip's ENG subtitles as base. Some changes were made compared to the original Hungarian text, erased the numbering of the pictures, and enhanced the picture quality a bit.

The scan was provided by kyriee, to whom I hereby would like to say a big thanxXx!

The ENG scan of the  1st booklet of Fazekas' Return of the Jedi will be arriving sometime in the summer of 2013, hopefully.

As for the next ENG scan of Fazekas' other works, I am just about to start working on his adaptation of Polish classic: The Pharaon. 

Enjoy!
