,unreadable33,2013-03-26T13:08Z,"Sorry, I was incorrect. This isn't a nosTEAM release. My fault. Thanks HeroMaster"
,lowlife89,2013-03-26T13:24Z,"Just remember people, if you wish to download then see aswell :D"

,forlani101,2013-03-26T13:31Z,So which crack does this use? FLT or what? Just curious. Thanks for the upload.
,deathtrooper30,2013-03-26T13:58Z,Can someone please upload the DLCs folder from this release please?
,s1raz1,2013-03-26T14:30Z,"Hooray HeroMaster for repack :D 
 Thx for upload"
,unreadable33,2013-03-26T14:45Z,Thank you to all the seeders. So many other Bioshock Infinite torrents have no seeds. At least the downloaders of this torrent have some decency. Thank you to all.
,unreadable33,2013-03-26T15:18Z,@Dado123- Eat a bag of dicks. Go somewhere else with that spam.
,forlani101,2013-03-26T16:54Z,Wish some of you downloading would also upload like i have been doing since early in the wee hours this morning. Other than that i'm happy just kinda angry at the community for not sharing. good day!
,apav11,2013-03-26T17:24Z,"Hey thanks to HeroMaster for the upload. I have a question about repacks or Black Box releases... I know they cut out all other languages, but do they reduce graphics quality as well? Like are textures lower? Thanks for the help! :)"
,unreadable33,2013-03-26T17:47Z,I don't know why people are complaining. I am getting around 800-900 kbps (below average for a healthy torrent but not bad). And I'm uploading unlimited as well. I'll be killing littlle sisters in the next few hours.
,s1raz1,2013-03-26T18:26Z,"@apav
Blackbox sometimes recode videos to reduce space, that in turn give reduced quality videos, but they  posted that on the file if it is done. Also blackbox uses its own compression tool that reduce space even more at the expense of a longer installation time.
This repack, just cut all other languages except the ones  posted."
,cj23,2013-03-26T19:29Z,installer not working for me 
,unreadable33,2013-03-26T19:36Z,I'm installing now. Quick question. This torrent doesn't require a crack right? I just install and play?
,hdhg,2013-03-26T19:52Z,"Works flawlessly!
There is no need for crack, its a custom unpacker/installer.
The install is a bit slow but i guess it kinda makes up for it by being quicker to download."
,capricornio,2013-03-26T19:54Z,"@HeroMaster

Why not include all languages and make everyone happy?"
,jasam2,2013-03-26T19:56Z,"if I can save the game to the part where I left off??,going to crack or not to crack???"
,unreadable33,2013-03-26T19:57Z,Comment delay
,unreadable33,2013-03-26T19:58Z,Thank you so very much once again. @hdhg-thanks for the quick response. 5 mins left on install. Getting ready to kick some big daddy ass. Also I'm seeding unlimited.
,ancemu,2013-03-26T20:32Z,"well, I´m installing it, I selected english lenguaje and then appears the bioshock title with elisabeth, but nothing happens, 15 minutes passed, but nothing happens, does it last that much? I did something wrong?"
,barabusignasius,2013-03-26T20:33Z,"@ capricornio,   

The whole point of a repack is to rip some non essential features to reduce file sizedownload time.
Being that langauges are the only thing ripped here, including all the langauges would defeat the whole point.  If you want all the langauges just download FLT's release."
,Suoinegni,2013-03-26T23:41Z,"I'm also having Ancemu's issue. I start up the installer, choose English, and a small Bioshock Infinite picture with Elizabeth's face appears. After half an hour, there is no response. When I attempt to close the picture/program, I am asked if I want to cancel or continue the installation."
,terach,2013-03-27T00:34Z,"@ancemu, @Suoinegni

For those who have the installer stuck on the picture with Elizabeth, just press enter to continue. It seems the window is cut off and you don't see the whole thing."

,PseudoPositive,2013-03-27T15:01Z,"Thanks HeroMaster, this works perfectly, thanks to seeders as well, game has beautiful graphics & gameplay, took about 24 minutes to install on Win7, core 2 duo; no doubt this is worth the wait, cheers again to HM & seeders :)"

,Cerebral222,2013-03-28T15:36Z,"@laracroft5, I use Comodo too, it's not a torrent friendly AV; even if you drop it, it still works in the background. You might need to install the game on a PC that has no AV, or uninstall Comodo then install it, I've complained to Comodo several times about this, not much we can do about it though, good luck."

Heromaster is amazing.  Game works flawlessly.  Install is simple & easy but does take time.  Not complaining just letting others know.

,laracroft5,2013-03-28T20:45Z,so i just disabled comodo's antivirus and installed it. it took more than 30 mins definitely but it all depends on pc's speeds. what it matters is that it was downloading it at 1Mb/s speed so that's great. game also works just fine. good torrent

This torrent was certainly faster than most others and the size was just two-thirds of other torrents. The only downside was that the installation (including the unpacking process) took almost a full 20 minutes. Not much to complain about though.

Graphics are absolutely superb. My GeForce 660-Ti is running it with all settings set to ""VERY HIGH"" at no less than 60 FPS at any point of time.
