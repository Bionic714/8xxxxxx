,exham,2013-03-26T16:34Z,"The seed/leech ratio on this torrent right now is shameful. Grow up guys and girls keep torrents alive. Yes it is SO easy to take and stop seeding the second you get what you want, but it really wont affect performance much on a PC looking to handle Bioshock Infinite... Even to just seed for awhile before stopping right away. Help others who WILL seed at least get a chance to reach the 100% you did and you will have made a difference!! We all gotta be a big damn family to keep this going as long as possible. I never want to go back to shelling out a ton of money on games, thats what I built a gaming pc for in the first place. 

Got this as a gift this morning from a friend retail, but I am going to download this just to get some seeding done. Hopefully we can get this ratio up for everyone!!     Every hour you seed, puts Charlie Sheen one step closer to cleaning up haha"

,moeburn1,2013-03-29T03:23Z,"for all you people whining about seeders:

1) Cap your upload speed.  I know it sounds crazy, but chances are, you are on an ADSL connection, and ADSL download speed gets crippled when you are uploading too fast.  Cap your upload speed to 75% of max, and you should be able to download at 100% max speed.  If you are uploading at 100% max, you can only download at 10%.  

2) Wait.  It's a 15GB game, it's brand new, and it's very popular.  So it's going to take AT LEAST 24 hours to download for most people, if not more.  Whining about seeders is NOT going to help; if people are refusing to seed, then seeing your whiny comments are NOT going to change their minds!  People ARE seeding.  If you can't connect to them, it's your fault!"
,moeburn1,2013-03-29T03:26Z,"Oh, and:

3) Stop watching your download speed.  It's going to jump around like crazy with this many connections.  One minute you'll be downloading at 5kB/s, the next you'll be downloading at 1MB/s.  If it never does, then you're probably not connectable, and you need to read about port forwarding properly."

The idea that pirating games hurts sales is BS.
Most people who never buy games after pirating them would never have bought them in the first place, and some of us DO buy the games (to support the developers) after we've tried them out.

Used game sales DO take away from developers' sales, because the devs never see a dime from used sales. Used game stores make millions every year. You want to support game companies? Stop buying used games, and only buy new ones."
