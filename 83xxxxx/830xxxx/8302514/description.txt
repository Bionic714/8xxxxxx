Holy Motors is one of the strangest, maddest and most bizarre films you can imagine. In a statement about the nature of both acting and the digitalisation of the world, Leos Carax's film stars Denis Lavant as a man who travels through Paris in a white limousine that is driven by Edith Scob. Along the way he stops for various 'appointments' for which he adopts an entirely different character complete with make-up, mannerisms and speech. Throughout the course of the day he becomes a beggar woman, motion capture artist, assassin, disappointed father plus many more....
(Not recommended to conservative narrow-minded folks who can't embrace some weird neo-noir-mindfuck-arte-cinema lol)
