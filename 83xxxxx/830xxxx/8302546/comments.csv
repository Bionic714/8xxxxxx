""In a basement, somewhere in war torn Baghdad, hostage Adam Smith (Stephen Hogan, THE TUDORS), imprisoned by Ahmed, (Elyes Gabel, GAME OF THRONES) is waiting to die. With no time, no chance, and no hope, he must look into the abyss of his own personal hell and it is here, ‘in the valley of the shadow of death that something divine is awaiting him."""
