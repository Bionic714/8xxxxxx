,demetria69,2013-03-26T17:44Z,"BAD QUALITY.


- Bitrate < 2000 (default DVD quality is > 5000)

- Audio quality @ 95 kbps (default CD quality is  1411 kbps)



Even a YouTube video have better quality than these ""BrRips""...

Don't know why YIFY don't show this info on description, maybe they are ashamed of this dramatically murder quality to get low file sizes.


IF YOU LOOKING FOR A GOOD QUALITY GO TO OTHER UPLOADER."

,shaktigta,2013-03-26T21:00Z,"similar thoughts like @demetria69, I think this is like 720p should be, too well encoded to be 2.2 GB of 1080p ?

Quality is amazing. Perfect for 2GB. If it was in ancient xvid, it would take 4 GB and YIFY quality would still be better.
There's no need to download larger version, unless you're watching @ 50"" TV. Most people watch movies on 19-24 inch monitors and for that YIFY 720p torrents looks very good, not to mention 1080p!!"

,Getabrain,2013-03-27T11:18Z,"Well Yify, now that you write ""the best 720p/1080p on the internet in small size"" in the beginning of the subtitles you propose with your movies, we know your ambition. The problem is, your 720p are not even bluray and your 1080p (witch are more like 720p) are crapy 1/2 of the time. You have a bunch of fanatics young people who consider you as a God because they don't see the difference when they see your movies on their phones or small laptop, but the day they will buy a big screen, they will hate you and regret to have blindly downloaded ""your"" movies.
I mean, sometimes you make decent copies, sometimes you don't. Don't you realize it is dishonest from your part? Don't you realize the time people lose with you when they have to download another copy? Don't sacrifice all for the size, learn the equation Size/Picture Quality! If you want to be the best, be the best but be good then. Verify your ""products"" before!
Ok?"
,tomcruz,2013-03-27T11:24Z,"Yify is not my favorite uploader but you should not complain about the quality of his rips, they are good. And, the quality of the movie may not be very good, only if the bit rate is high, it entirely depends on how skillful the encoder is."
,demetria69,2013-03-27T15:52Z,"@tomcruz, frame per frame at 1080p looks ""great"" at whatever bitrate, this is why screens doesn't look bad at all, but theres no skillful to encode a decent BrRip at this ultra-low bitrate and this is why the movie in motion looks like shit, also theres no one skillful to make audio @ 95kbps to sounds good, just is not far enough to have good quality."
,bfc2012,2013-03-27T22:41Z,"@demetria69: i get mad because people like you KEEP POSTING THE SAME SHIT over and over... we already read what you had to say, yet you KEEP SAYING IT! this is what angers people, you are hungry for attention, like a little dog, and want to keep barking until someone gives you a biscuit. get a girlfriend or become a standup comedian if you want attention and approval so much. you've made your point, why do you keep posting THE SAME SHIT over and over?? let it go now, you're not being informative, you're being annoying."
,bfc2012,2013-03-27T22:45Z,"@Getabrain: you're exactly the kind of fucking idiot i was talking about in my last message... you're upset about what, exactly?? no one's forcing you to download this stuff, so what is your point? are you some kind of robin hood, you're trying to inform the masses that yify is not good enough? you sound like a jealous ex-girlfriend that's ridiculing the new girl... why do guys like you even post, you're not saying ANYTHING! don't download if you don't want it, and HAVE A POINT if you post a message... your stupid rant comes off as childish and immature because YOU'RE NOT MAKING A POINT AGAINST ANYTHING.... basically what you're saying is that yify has no right to upload files because you don't like him.... wow, awesome point...."

YIFY shows screens wich looks with the same aspect at ANY bitrate, but not show essential info about the bitrate, this is a hoax and illiterates like you fall into the trap.

If you looking for small file size you better go for a 720p version but with decent quality."

YIFY's uploads look amazing on my 60 inch LED hdtv. My tower speakers play 2.1 in amazing quality.

Of course a 2gb video isn't as good quality as a 12gb video; that is common sense people.

That having been said, Thanks for what is undoubtedly another great upload."

,tomcruz,2013-03-31T20:42Z,"Dudes, stop complaining. We are getting this for free and at a decent quality. I remember 3-4 years back when these uploaders liketwentyforty, yify, sujaidr, stylishsalh, herackler, riddler-a, anoxmous were not there, we were downloading 700 mb dvd rips whose quality were not as good as compressed brrips of today. If you want to watch crystal clear quality buy/rent bluray. I admit how much skillful the uploader is, there will be some quality loss. That's why I said it depends upon the source and the uploader. If you want to see really good compressed brrips you need to watch uploads of my favourite {twentyforty, riddler-a & herackler(now gone)}, anoxmous, sujaidr etc, you will see there is very little quality loss"

,danyalson,2013-04-18T03:01Z,"I agree that the quality of YIFI's downloads could be better, but they are by no means ""bad"". If you want perfect A/V quality, then by all means go find a 6gb version and download it. I watch these movies on a 34 inch HDTV and besides some minor pixelation from time to time the video quality is fine. The Audio quality is a bit off but its watchable. Some of the quieter parts of the movie has to be turned up, and then you have to turn it down for the really loud parts but I don't mind doing that. The movie looks clean and downloads in less than 25 minutes so I'm happy.  I normally rent these movies on On-Demand and then Download them just so I can have more control over fast forward and rewind and what not so the fact that I am willing to watch this version over the On-Demand version speaks to the quality of the upload. If you want perfection for archival purposes then go find a 6 Gig copy that has 200 seeders and 150 Leechers and spend all day downloading it. Otherwise, leave YIFI alone. He hasn't really disappointed me yet. I'd be willing to have a slightly larger file for better sound, but it's nothing to whine about. "
