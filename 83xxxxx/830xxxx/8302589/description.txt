As a member of the strange secret society E.Y.E
you wake up after a fight in which your fellow
teammates were killed. E.Y.E, an armed branch of
the Secreta Secretorum is attempting a coup against
the all-powerful Federation, a coalition of several
worlds and planets that rule with an iron fist. To
complicate matters, E.Y.E itself is plagued with
its own internal conflicts between the Jian faction
and the Culter faction, to which you belong. Your
loyalties are torn between Commander Rimanah, your
superior and the chief of the Secreta who is a
separatist with an unstoppable ambition, and the
"Mentor" your friend and instructor. The "Mentor"
tries at all costs to unite the two rival factions
In doing so, you are thrust into the middle of a
fratricidal war frought with political conspiracies
and quests for power in which different groups and
megacorporations are implicated. These troubles set
the stage for an attack by an unknown force bent on
destroying humankind

PROPER NOTE:
COGENT release is badly oversized. It's basicly the
whole game packed and released as update. Their rls
size is 2.38GB, while our is just ~460MB
Furthermore COGENT release (like all their other dox
releases) is packed as iso. Dox section does not
allow packing in iso format. Some of their other dox
releases on the other hand do not have all updated
content included (like their Worms Revolution
update)
