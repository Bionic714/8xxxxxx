There are a few VN's I've been wanting to play but can't find anywhere, especially Train of Afterlife, which I have seemed to look everywhere for, and without any luck. I was wondering if you could possibly upload it sometime? I hope it isn't out of place to be asking this, I'm not exactly sure what is or isn't proper on this site yet...anyway, thank you so much again!!"
