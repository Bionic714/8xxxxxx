Rome is a martial folk act founded in November 2005 as a main output for the songs of Jérôme Reuter of Luxembourg. In early 2006 Rome was signed to CMI record label. Rome has since signed with the Trisol Music Group record label as of 2009.
Rome is one of my favourites bands of martial neofolk, with their strong and melodic harmonies supported by the exceptional voice of Jérôme Reuter.
