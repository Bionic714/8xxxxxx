Björk Guðmundsdóttir (pron.: /ˈbjɜrk/;[1] [ˈpjœr̥k ˈkvʏðmʏntsˌtoʊhtɪr] ( listen); born 21 November 1965), known simply as Björk, is an Icelandic singer-songwriter. Her musical style is eclectic and she has achieved recognition in rock, jazz, electronic dance music, classical, and folk.
Three of Björk's 1990s singles charted in the UK Top 10 ("It's Oh So Quiet" reached number 4, "Army of Me" number 10, and "Hyperballad" number 8). Her record label, One Little Indian, reported that by 2003 she had sold more than 15 million albums worldwide. She has won four BRIT Awards, four MTV Video Music Awards, one MOJO Award, three UK Music Video Awards, and, in 2010, the Polar Music Prize from the Royal Swedish Academy of Music in recognition of her "deeply personal music and lyrics, her precise arrangements and her unique voice."
