Hi,

I've put together different abridged series in one package for you to download.
I take no credit for any of this.

I didn't RAR them so you can pick and choose what you like.


I wanted to know if you all know of any ones I don't, but I mean really really funny abridged series not the lower quality stuff.

FYI all flash videos (use VLC to play)
