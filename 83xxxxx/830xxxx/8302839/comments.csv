I had some trouble locating some issues from V. 3 and 4 as well as the spin-off issues.

I'm never sure if I've found them all."
,PirateSOB,2013-03-27T05:59Z,"Well according to Comixology these are all the volumes.

Fathom Vol. 3 - 0-10
Fathom Vol. 4 - 1-8 current
Fathom: Blue Descent Vol. 1 - #0-4
Fathom: Dawn of War - Beginnings + #0-3 + Fathom: Cannon Hawke - Dawn of War #1

Fathom: Cannon Hawke - Beginnings, Prelude + #0-5

Fathom: Kiani - #0-4
Fathom: Kiani Vol. 2  - #0-4

The only ones I've found from Empire are some of the later V4 issues and the free #0's and beginnings. I know there are old scans but I'm trying to put together the whole run from Empire.

I will upload as they come available. It's just a waiting game."
