Pure rock music from a band called Still Pluto
Main tags are: Post-grunge/Southern

Don't miss these guys,they live in the North of Russia but they sound just like South America

Their music looks like a blend of mid 90's with some melancholy of blues-rock and the warmth of southern guitar riffs

Sometimes hard and angry,sometimes soft and lyrical,-it's all about their music,-just watch and listen and you won't forget it!
