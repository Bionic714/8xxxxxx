and @.BONE. please can we have some more detailed specs."
,djmik21,2013-03-27T15:02Z,Yeah i would love to see the bit-rates of audio and video at least please. Looks great.
,jalucian,2013-03-27T18:25Z,"In order for a movie of this resolution and length to be this small, the video bitrate would have to be under 1750, probably closer to 1700, which is bordering on substandard. Even YIFY's encode of this was 2.2gig and he is known for making things as small as possible without compromising quality (video bitrate right around 1800 in his case.) 

I've found that the only time people don't list their bitrates is when they know that people will avoid their torrents because they aren't high enough. "
