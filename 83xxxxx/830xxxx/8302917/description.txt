 Set in New York City, Black and White features several loosely related stories centering on a pair of documentary filmmakers, Sam and her husband Terry.  They are following a group of Caucasian teens who try to fit in with Harlem's black hip-hop crowd.  Hip-hop culture in New York City attracts White kids from privileged families and young Black men who are moving from crime to the recording studio. 

 For the White kids, it's a fad they throw themselves into: the girls into sex, and at least one boy into violence. For the Black men, who include gangster rapper Rich Bower and his music partner Cigar, there's expression and perhaps, fame. The cast includes Robert Downey, Jr, Brooke Shields, Elijah Wood, Ben Stiller, Joe Pantoliano, Raekwon, Method Man, Scott Caan, Claudia Schiffer, Mike Tyson, and more.
