,da_grub,2013-03-26T21:38Z,"@ilang17 This is the original file from the Blu-ray disc (05024.m2ts) put into a MKV container with ""uncompressed video"" and English DTS-HD Master Audio (minus the Spanish and French audio tracks). 

If you want the disc menus and extras then download the 43GB torrent but both are completely uncompressed video the audio of the original"

,akash2008,2013-03-27T04:47Z,"If you have a good 5.1 sound system get the 43gb as the audio bit rate is double the remux. I dl the full blurays for this reason alone, you wont notice a video difference but audio is night and day with my system. I have a $15k sound system but im too cheap and lazy to buy a bluray.."
,da_grub,2013-03-27T10:08Z,"@akash2008. Both have English DTS-HD Master Audio, you just have to make sure you bitstream the audio to your AV receiver to decode the HD Master Audio. Both have identical audio bit rate"
