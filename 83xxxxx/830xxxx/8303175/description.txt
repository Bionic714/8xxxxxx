Ep 20: Reunion Part 1

PREMIERE: Monday March 25, 9:00 pm

In the Reunion Part One, the women gather with Andy Cohen to discuss the year, settle old scores, and clear the air. . .but Adrienne Maloof's decision not to attend sparks the initial controversy -- and leads to a shocking announcement. Other surprises are revealed in this hour: Yolanda felt unwelcome when she joined the group, Taylor admits to drinking too much, and Lisa and Kyle's touchy relationship becomes even more dramatic when Yolanda, Kim, and Brandi step in with their take on the battle.
