,killzaw,2013-03-29T08:27Z,what  i wanna knw is after you install does it delete all of your data that you had before
,nitner1,2013-04-01T14:14Z,The WinRar file won't open as an ISO. Am I doing something wrong?
,leffe72,2013-04-09T13:05Z,"It works perfect and Windows is activated. 
Burn the ISO with PowerISO or something like that. "
,phaxor90,2013-04-09T17:23Z,"Works flawlessly, thank you! The only thing it lacks is a 64 bit version otherwise it's perfect. (To the uploader, any chance you'll crack a 64 bit version?)"
,dazedmac21,2013-04-10T18:37Z,"whenever i try and connect to internet my moniter shuts off and will not come back on,.. ?"
,stanbizil,2013-04-11T12:41Z,hi i keep receiving this message in the action center''windows not activated''but when u check it is activated.
,WhyIZi,2013-04-12T22:27Z,"Can anyone confirm this? I mean it might be  working and all that, but as anyone scanned for viruses etc etc. To me it all seems a little suspicious that all of a sudden @nathankeating released windows torrents. 117 seeders and only a little amount of comments. Anyone checked whether this connects you to a botnet? Name seams suspicious as well, just looking out for you all, check the integrity of the file."
,gyminii,2013-04-19T02:19Z,"SH!T...With all these SEEDERS can some confirm if this WORKS????  
Has any had the same issues as stanbizil???
Also does does Windows 8 and Media Center work"
,TTGHalo4,2013-04-20T05:23Z,"My small input on the download -
I downloaded this and was not sure if it would work or not. The installation was fairly quick (I believe your computer determines the speed of the process and since mine isn't THAT great it went somewhat slow).  I came across one problem but a quick internet search resolved that issue and after that it went easy. Just waited for the installation to finish up and it was just fine!

This version of Windows 8 is already Pre-Activated and I have Windows Media Center! Another good note is that you also get that Start Orb included (the orb that is on the bottom left of your screen) so it saves you some time!

Thanks Nathan for the download, I appreciate it!
10/10!

*Note to Users - If you're not sure if you're wanting to commit to Windows 8, just dual-boot w/Windows 7 (or Vista). That's what I did before since I wasn't sure if W8 was the right thing and now with this Download I just fully upgraded my Windows 7. You could easily stop the Dual-Boot, it literally takes 10 minutes. (Give or take)"
,gyminii,2013-04-21T06:42Z,"gyminii...it works...Thanks NathanW

side note...initially Windows 8 was made 4 tablets...and it should have stayed that way...because it sucks azz any other way!!!!  "
,gyminii,2013-04-21T07:20Z,ohh I forgot...can sum1 confirm if you can get Microsoft Updates or what Updates not to install..Thanks in advance...
