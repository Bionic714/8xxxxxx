,theurbs,2013-03-27T18:41Z,Amazing quality! Thank you so much! :D
,theurbs,2013-03-28T01:39Z,"P.S. Other Trekkies take heed: The pilot, Broken Bow, is in SIGNIFICANTLY lower image quality than any of the twenty-four season one episodes (this is present on the blu-ray too, of course; this torrent itself is a near-flawless rip). This is because Paramount made the decision to display the show in 16:9 AFTER the pilot was filmed, so the filmmakers had to digitally zoom and crop the 4:3 image (including the VFX) to widescreen which, sadly, resulted in significantly lower IQ. Thankfully, however, this problem is only present in the pilot. The rest of the series looks pretty near flawless.

Thanks again, ""Anonymous."""
,DaBigLebowski,2013-03-29T02:47Z," Star Trek Fans are suppose to be cool, nerdy, but more importantly SMART!  Based on the seeding of ALL STAR TREK torrents, it looks like we are a group that is greedy, selfish, with a every man for themselves mentality. PLEASE GET IN THE HABIT OF SEEDING.  Or in a future, there won't be any free downloads.  $49.99 for a box set?  or JUST SEED?  Come on Trekkies!!!!!"
,pyfgcrlx,2013-03-31T23:12Z,"@DaBigLebowski duuuuude. I will seed this for a very long time.  10Mb/sec up; already have a bunch of the MKVs from the 'groups, so chill :)

You'll get it. It's all good."
,waspo,2013-04-01T05:00Z,This sounds excellent. Do you plan to upload the other 3 seasons too? 
,pyfgcrlx,2013-04-01T21:02Z,"@waspo not sure who the Anonymous uploader is, but I thank them for the upload as I'm sure everyone else does as well (by seeding well past 1:1)... as for season 2, it is slated for a 'mid-2013' Blu-Ray release, whereas season 3 and 4 have not (to my knowledge) been announced yet.  Hopefully we'll see as great a release as this when they do arrive."
,nam045,2013-04-04T09:55Z,Could someone pls pls pls upload this to usenet cos many more people can get it n downloading from here is a nightmare with my downloading speed max a 5kb for 7 days now.  plsssssssssssssss
,schmolch,2013-04-05T11:16Z,"Thanks for the upload and the seeding!
I'm downloading since a week and i am at 70% which is pretty good considering the large size and low number of people involved.
Thank you again!"
,Torrenad000,2013-04-07T21:19Z,"Thank you for the upload, but good god man 85 gigs? If you have a netflix subscription they just put it up in hd, im sure this is better quality but if im downloading a file this big it's gonna be for one of the better trek series..."
,nocadlee,2013-04-10T10:47Z,Any chance to get the Blu-ray-exclusive extras?
,mysreryfr,2013-04-10T11:17Z,"All fine except for episode 1. 
With VLC not possible to jump forward, watching is ok though. Jumping forward in stereoscopic player and xmbc works. 
Also, there are tiny vertical stripes at the left and right edges in the first half of this episode. Maybe this is somewhat related - the other episodes don't have the stripes and jumping is ok with VLC."
,mysreryfr,2013-04-10T11:54Z,Followup: I could fix the broken first episode with meteorite. The stripes are still there though.
,55trucker,2013-05-12T00:43Z,"Thx for the effort..

the video is average for Bluray...many of the episodes clearly display a softening of the picture in scenes where different cameras are used &  angles switch back & forth during scene plays...for a 10 year old series I would have expected sharper images

what does really lacks is the obvious compression/re-encoding of the original DTS lossless master audio on the Bluray discs to the uploaders 1510 lossy audio....that's a real shame the original DTS audio wasn't left intact.  "
,ddudes,2013-05-17T06:13Z,An upload to usenet would be appreciated very much. Killing down-speed here. Thanks.
,ddudes,2013-05-17T16:30Z,"Trekkers, what do you think Jean-Luc and Starfleet would say about this,. 
You’d be sent out on dangerous missions to meet the Borg."
