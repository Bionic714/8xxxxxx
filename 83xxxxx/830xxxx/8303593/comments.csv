,M.Mahad,2013-03-26T20:56Z,and does this mess up the previously wings of liberty install since its required to play the game?

and you don't need to download anything from there server "
,D_A7,2013-03-26T21:09Z,Yes i do see the size and i also see that installation steps and crack are the same as FLT.
,emdeec,2013-03-26T21:10Z,"Thanks Gh0st!

So this contains the FULL v206 game? What I mean is.. after installing this, one doesn't have to download a 6+ gig ""optimizing"" update as well (like Fairlight's)?

It seems Fairlight copied the HotS retail disc.. which it turns out by Blizzard's own admission.. contains nothing useful (as in NO HotS files) thereby needing a big update anyway. It's all over the SC2 forums. People are pissed."
,M.Mahad,2013-03-26T21:57Z,hey ghost! dont be angry! i just wanted to ask that if i hav already install wings of liberty from another torrent would i need to reinstall it with this torrent?plz answer....

,Notter87,2013-03-26T22:05Z,"@Ghost
i'm sorry that i've posted in this torrent, i've posted it in all SCII torrent in hope of asnswers

i found the problem, it was that i didn't run step 3 from the exe in the disk. i copied it to my desktop and it didn't copy the files."
[V],Gh0stNet,2013-03-26T22:05Z,"
This release contains both Wings of Liberty and Heart of the Swarm campaigns and 
they are 100% playable in offline mode. Used modified FLT loader to import full 
offline cache so you can also play skirmish mode!
Full pack with official Blizzard maps is included in /Map Pack folder on the DVD. 
Install it in StarCraft II save folder

,SamIndy,2013-03-27T02:50Z,"@Serenifly
No bro i am not exactly talking about the FLT crack itself which is readily available. I was rather seperately looking for the entire 5-6gb server game files that were not included in the FLT dvd version, which GhOstNet's release appears to have covered, alongside with the modified FLT loader required to import full offline cache without the need to download it from the shitty battlenet servers.

Peace."
,iwinz3,2013-03-27T03:43Z,does this crack work for bulldozers? like does it have the same error the FLT one does?
,teshia,2013-03-27T04:19Z,"If you were able to play the game fine, but then start getting asked for a password when you go back to the game later on, the solution is simple.

Disable your network card in your control panel or just unplug your ethernet cable from the back of your computer.  If you don't have any internet connection, it'll stop asking for a password and start letting you play in Offline Mode again.  Just enable your network card again when you're done playing to go back online."

Posting the same message over and over again won't help you. And for those of you who got the game to work - stop trolling that this crack is ok, and all you have to do is follow the instructions to the letter. Just because it runs smoothly for you, doesn't mean that it does for others. The fact is, that the crack is not perfect and its functionality is limited and unpredictable.
That said I also had a problem with the license and the starter edition message, however i have i7 860 processor and GeForce GTS250 graphics card, so it is not exactly a hardware problem with AMD cpu or gpu. Still i wrote 'had' - past tense, which suggests that I got it working. What I did is I enabled hyperthreding and enabled all 4 cores in my cpu (had only 2 without ht) and it did the job. I'm not saying that you have the same problem, just saying it may work for you as it did for me.
And again, don't praise this crack because it worked for you, or don't complain because it didn't. It's not perfect, but it's not crap either. The game has some serious security solutions. And it's also bugged as hell."
,LEXX911,2013-03-30T04:28Z,Ok got it to work.  This is what you all should do.  First do step 2-4.  Make sure to block SC2.EXE version Base24944.  They say to launch the shortcut on desktop and if that doesn`t work launch the StarCraft II.exe in C:Program FilesStarCraft II.  Let it optimize and click play after it finished optimizing and it will relaunch the SC2Switcher.exe and it will take awhile for starcraft to launch.  Follow the rest of the step and play offline.  To start starcraft 2 from now on use the shortcut version.

If you get errors, new AMD Bulldozer FX processors I read that don't work with this.
You need at least 1 GB of memory I observed.
If you have 1 GB or less memory, make a 2 GB swap.
If you have 2 GB or more memory, no swap.
