Wings of Liberty:

StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty is the sequel to Blizzard Entertainment's 1998
hit StarCraft, which has been hailed by players and critics worldwide as one
of the top real-time strategy games of all time. Sporting a vibrant 
3D-graphics engine, StarCraft II will once again center on the clash between
the protoss, terrans, and zerg, with each side deploying legions of veteran,
upgraded, and new unit types. Unparalleled online play for StarCraft II will
be available through a new version of Battle.net, Blizzard Entertainment's
world-renowned gaming service. Battle.net has been redesigned from the ground
up to be the premier online gaming destination for Blizzard gamers, with 
several enhancements and new features, such as voice communication, cloud file
storage, leagues and ladders, achievements, stat-tracking, and more.

Heart of the Swarm:

You are Sarah Kerrigan, former Queen  of  Blades.  Once  the  most  feared
entity in the galaxy,  you  now  wait  in  a  cell  in  the  depths  of  a
high-security research laboratory. Before  the  murderous  forces  of  the
Terran Dominion close in, you must plot your escape to the dark reaches of
space... and reclaim your  living  empire  at  the  Heart  of  the  Swarm.
