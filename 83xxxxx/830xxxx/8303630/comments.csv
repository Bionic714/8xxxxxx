,Malefic.exe,2013-03-28T19:17Z,How to install the game with of that shit in DVD1 DVD2 DVD3 srsly WHY NOT AN ISO
,mr_ktr,2013-03-30T18:42Z,"@Malefic.exe

WTF you talking about. It is already in ISO format.

Just extract each DVD to their own folder. Run the setup.exe on DVD1. When prompted for DVD2 and DVD3, just point the installer to DVD2 and DVD3 folder. Finally, copy the crack located on DVD3 to the game folder where you installed. "
