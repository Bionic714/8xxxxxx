Yeah, my sympathy for Bishop is shot. At this point, I'm honestly worried they're gonna pull some redemption-story crap for him over in Uncanny X-Force. I miss the days when x-books were heros vs. villains. That said, all of them are pretty rocking right now.

And, of course, thanks blackcanary! Any x-men from this era would be awesome, I skipped about ten years worth of comics and I'm still playing catch up!"
