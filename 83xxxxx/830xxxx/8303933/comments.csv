,Raduz,2013-03-26T22:29Z,"+1 for me. Before i got problem with crash after ""press any key"" screen. Now its working and saves works too."
,HULIAK222,2013-03-26T22:32Z,"this really works! and actualy even better, than FLT crack..game runs smoother.
first I´ve had my concerns, but just try it! 
saves now run perfectly ;)"
,HULIAK222,2013-03-26T22:36Z,man you saved my day! thank you so much!
,ketsuimon,2013-03-26T23:54Z,ahahaha Im really glad that it worked for you guys too =D 
,Piratechnix,2013-03-27T00:16Z,"deleting the original save game folder in ""my games"" and letting it create a new one fixed it for me"
,xPoPxKiDx110,2013-03-27T01:37Z,"So I downloaded this, but which game torrent should I use with it?"
,ketsuimon,2013-03-27T02:15Z,"@xPoPxKiDx110

I used on the 3DM release, I dont know if it work with another release, but since its just 2 cracks merged, it will probably work in any version"
,xPoPxKiDx110,2013-03-27T03:05Z,"@ketsuimon Alright, cool. Thanks. Finding a torrent that isn't going to take a couple days is hard, so I think I'm going to try the MULTI-FULL UNLOCKED version. I found putlocker links and all of that good shit, so it should be faster.

Thanks again."
,ketsuimon,2013-03-27T03:56Z,^^
,razorgamerpro,2013-03-27T07:49Z,"Im new to this....please help me in how to extract or overwrite...i have no idea what it means
@_@"""

,razorgamerpro,2013-03-27T10:54Z,Can you pls give me a detailed way on how to do this
,tapaka,2013-03-27T11:02Z,worked for me ! nice !
,ketsuimon,2013-03-27T14:40Z,"Well, razorgamerpro, just use winrar to extract the binaries.rar; put it on the main folder of the game, right click it, choose ""extract here"", and when you are prompt to overwrite, just click yes and you are done =]"
,ben7530,2013-03-27T16:09Z,"@ketsuimon

Dude, you rock!

This is the only one that worked for me..."
,ketsuimon,2013-03-27T16:44Z,"@ben7530

glad to hear that!

but all credit goes to 3DM and FLT, I just ""fixed"" their crack ^^"
,Jk24,2013-03-27T17:40Z,I am really lost. I downloaded the torrent now what?
,Jk24,2013-03-27T17:41Z,I need someone to help me! D:
,Jk24,2013-03-27T17:52Z,WHAT IS THE GAME FOLDER!?!?!?!?!?!
,Jk24,2013-03-27T18:31Z,Where do I apply your binaries folder?
,ketsuimon,2013-03-27T19:03Z,"@Jk24

just extract the .rar on the main folder of your game, and overwrite when prompt

or you can extract the files to binaries/win32"
,nignug,2013-03-27T19:24Z,"Thanks for ""fixing"" the crack. good job"
,gunner6666,2013-03-27T19:28Z,Thanks for being proactive. It works for me. Now back to hook spinney thing goodness.
,rapidfirereaper,2013-03-27T23:14Z,this one dosent work for me either
,latdropking,2013-03-28T01:52Z,"    I played for a few hours with just the FTL crack and could not load my saves after quitting the game.  I still have my folder containing all the saves as profile/saves/savedata but am not sure where to transfer the files to with this new crack.  Can anyone help me out, I really dont wan to have to start over."
,stephenwanck,2013-03-28T02:14Z,"latdropking u just need to left click BioShockInfinite.exe/properties and check compatibility mode to win7 or vista(sp2).

by the way they all save in UsersnameAppDataLocalFLTSteam8870remoteSaveData"
,stephenwanck,2013-03-28T02:22Z,"@latdropking Go to BioShockInfinite.exe - Properties - Compatibility - Windows Vista [Service Pack 2]
This works...oddly it works even if u check on Win7 compatibility (which i was using before the loading bug) "
,flawlessly,2013-03-28T03:17Z,"@stephenwanck

sorry mate i tried that but i still get the same issue. i have the save games (allready fought slate etc), but the game wont load them. since i patched this crack, the game recognizes the first save from the first time i installed the game and got stuck at the lighthouse bells.

how can i fix this ? "
,vagenrider,2013-03-28T04:28Z,"No work for me....the game still stuck on ""press any key"""
,vagenrider,2013-03-28T04:43Z,"@stephenwanck this woks for me but dont know for how much..however thank you..
btw any good trainer?"
,stephenwanck,2013-03-28T05:43Z,"flawlessly,  maybe try ur old crack and then check the Compatibility for that .exe"
,captaintoc,2013-03-28T10:32Z,"Hey if your having problems with crashing after it started once try going into your bioshock config files and deleting them they located at

C:users*your name*DocumentsMy GamesBioShock InfiniteXGameconfig

The game will rebuild the configs when you start again and don't touch FOV setting seemed to do the trick for me.

Have fun"
,jackass2010,2013-03-28T11:15Z,"Hi guys.I'm not very sure but i think that it has something to do with a steam cloud option on settings.if you disable it ,saving becomes available(probably saves are on steam for those online).I tried it only on the first level but it worked so i think it works."
,ketsuimon,2013-03-28T11:34Z,"I cant really help with save files, but mine are in:

""C:.Users.****.AppData.Local.FLT.Steam.8870.remote.SaveData""

If you already tried to put your save files there and it didnt work, Its probably an issue it the merge of two different cracks, since I didnt made them, I cant really tell if is a compability problem =("
,Jk24,2013-03-28T23:07Z,"I don't know where to find the main game folder. When I find it, the game will work please help! D:"
,Torrenad000,2013-03-29T01:43Z,Sorry im a bit confused which file is the 3dm crack? Is it just the one named BioShockInfinite? Or is it one of the other application extensions in the folder?
,Torrenad000,2013-03-29T02:46Z,"Nevermind dumb question! just extracted the entire folder to the binaries folder in my game folder, and presto! runs like a dream. Thanks for the upload man amazing game so far."
,agmilky,2013-03-29T11:50Z,"For those still having issues because of a start crash once the first save files have been created by the game, I found the following solution: 

Go to ""C:.Users.****.AppData.Local.FLT.Steam.8870.remote.SaveData"" 

and delete ALL "".bkm"" files that you can find (maybe make a copy before, just in case). 

This is what my save folder looked like after 3 or so chapters:
http://i.imgur.com/HntGxXs.jpg

I am not sure what the .bkm files save, but the game itself loads fine with the .sav files only.

I think the bkms store stuff like achievement or chapter select option .. so that might not work anymore if you delete them.

But for now that was the only way for me to be able to play, save, and play again. "
,bestas,2013-03-29T19:10Z,thanks :)
,savebio,2013-03-29T23:14Z,"So I played with the ALI213 crack for a while, didn't know I couldnt save. Got pretty far, got pretty pissed. I was able to recover my ""saved games"" from that crack by copying the contents of the binarieswin32profilesavedata folder, the ALI213 crack and old game files, reinstalling and then applying this crack. I then pasted the old save game files to the user(name)appdatalocalfltsteam8870remotesavedata folder and im back where I was yesterday in the game. Thanks to the comments for clearing this all up."
,Luvcanal,2013-03-31T14:56Z,"ok, this is probably a stupid question but im new to this whole game thing, but every time i try opening it it tells my Failed to find default engine .ini file. what do i do?"
,egozi44,2013-04-06T01:13Z,So... did anyone was able to beat the game with this crack and didn't got any issues such as saves and crashs?
,qzp,2013-04-07T04:09Z,"I was able  to fix  ""PRESS ANY KEY"" crash, by deleting profile.bin and my saves. after that i can press a key to continue. But when i save and turn the game off it happens again, Just a warning.

find the file here 

C:UsersYOURNAMEappdataLocalFLTSteam8870remote"
,egozi44,2013-04-07T05:45Z,"Thanks so much gzp

it seem that there's not a stable crack atm for the game though

make me sad :("
,spacetitt,2013-04-19T23:22Z,you dont need the crack for the ftl version of the game. it plays without the crack and i have not even had a problem with it. and btw. there is no gamesave in this download. at all. its just a crack. and there is no need for it in the ftl version. i never put a crack in my game. i installed it and played. im on the hand of the prophet misson and almost done.
,azazinman,2013-05-07T01:19Z,"I have the same problem as Luvcanal, I extracted it and now when I run the .exe file it pulls up an error message saying that my computer can't find the default engine.ini file."
