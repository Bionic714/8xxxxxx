So, like everyone else I was waiting for a proper crack for BioShock Infinite, then I got bored and tryed to merge the FTL (witch works but wont save) and 3DM(dont work at all for me) and somehow I got the game working and saving just fine!

I know I dont have any torrents and it will look like a fake crack, but all I want to do is share my working binaries folder of this game

If you dont want to risk (even tho is a safe file) download this torrent, just download the 3DM crack and the FTL one, here is the order that I did:

1- Extract 3DM crack normaly
2- Take the "Steam.appi" file from the FTL crack and overwrite it on the 3DM crack
3- Copy/Paste the modified 3DM crack on the game folder
4- Play the Game and have FUN!

or you can download my binaries folder in this torrent and apply it, it is working just fine for me =]
