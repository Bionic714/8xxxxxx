Ordo Rosarius Equilibrio (ORE) is a neofolk and martial industrial music group from Stockholm. The band is composed of its founding member and vocalist Tomas Pettersson, and Rose-Marie Larsen, who replaced Chelsea Krook on backup vocals. Other musicians participate in their live performances.

Style

The band's musical style has been described as "apocalyptic folk", a neofolk subgenre. The name Ordo Rosarius Equilibrio can be translated to "Order of the Rose and the Balance" from Latin (See Ordo Templi Orientis).
In its sombre lyrics, Ordo Rosarius Equilibrio combines seemingly incompatible polarities, such as "creation and destruction, dark and light, joy and sorrow, sex and war", often using Christian and specifically Catholic symbols. Other connotations are however used, like in Cocktails, Carnage, Crucifixion And Pornography (CCCP) opening with the national anthem of the Soviet Union. Sources of inspiration are well-known prophets of Dystopia; for example Aleister Crowley and William Blake. Other influences include the bands Depeche Mode, Laibach, SPK, Death In June, Current 93, Coil, writers Daniil Kharms and Ayn Rand and film-makers Tinto Brass and Andrew Blake. Occultism and gnosticism in general largely make up the themes of the band. BDSM topics are also often featured and in the first years, sadomasochism was performed live on stage as well.
A wide range of instruments are used, including acoustic guitars, percussions and piano, together with all sorts of sound-aggregating devices combined with projected imagery. Lyrics are delivered, typically by Petterson himself, in a performance including spoken word and traditional song.
