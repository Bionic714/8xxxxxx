Information
------------------------------

The Hercules Skibird is the go-to aircraft for tough jobs in frozen places, and it's just 48 hours away from one of its most challenging missions yet. Follow this mighty plane and its dedicated crew to the top of the world as they prepare to evacuate climate scientists from Greenland's icy terrain. This mission will push the team and their powerful cargo plane to the limit as they attempt to fly, land, and take off in a country that holds the record for the worst flying conditions on the planet. The Skibird is the lifeblood of remote science camps in Greenland and Antarctica, carrying supplies, fuel and crew to these outer worldly locations ; the LC-130 Hercules Skibirds are operated by the New York Air National Guard's 109th Airlift Wing.
