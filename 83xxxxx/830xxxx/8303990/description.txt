English and German pilots shoot each other down, and later
find themselves at the same cabin. In order to survive the
tough winter in the Norwegian wilderness they have to stand
together. It's the start of a long and unlikely friendship.

Into the White has a plan to send a clear message to the men
and women of the modern world. We are at war, not at the scale
of the past world wars, but there is a chance we might reach
that day in the future. War creates enemies out of sister
countries full of brethren cut from the same cloth. We are to
learn from the characters that forging bonds; friendship is the
absolute strategy needed in times of war, blood and death. To
bond with the enemy shows the true measure and wits of a man
...or woman.
