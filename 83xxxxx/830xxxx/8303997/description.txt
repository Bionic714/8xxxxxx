Presenting the beautiful riffs of Sam Raimi's Raimi-Man trilogy, starring Tobey Maguire as Ted Rai- wait, what? He's supposed to be Peter Parker? Seriously?

Oh well, learn something new every day.

THRILL as our hero is portrayed by a badly CGI'd sprite for even simple, mundane actions like turning and firing a web!

You'll soon be ROLLING in the aisle at the comedic wit of Spider-Ma- what's that? Most of the jokes in these movies are told by Jameson and the villains? Wow... oh well, COMEDY!

And marvel at our hero's ability to... whine incessantly.

Sheesh, no wonder people act like Spidey's a wuss....

Anyways, teasing aside, enjoy the riffs folks.
