When Christopher MarloweΓÇÖs Doctor Faustus was performed
in London in 1594 it produced a shock reaction in many quarters.
The shock was not only because Faustus was depicted as
wanting to acquire power and the control of nature through
magic but that he was willing to sell his soul to get it.
One wonders what the reaction of the audience would be
today. Is the soul still regarded as precious?
