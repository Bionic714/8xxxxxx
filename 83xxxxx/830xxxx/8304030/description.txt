He's got family, he's got power, but he's got issues.

Review: Jay_88: 
Martina Cole's "The Take", is by far one of the best British drama's I have ever seen.
It has such a powerful and gripping storyline, which I find is a rarity. I have never
seen acting as fantastic as Tom Hardy plays his character Freddie. They could not have
chosen a finer actor and he deserves so much credit for this series alone. I actually
did not see this on television, but I bought it on DVD, and as you can tell I do not
regret my decision. I would highly recommend this to anyone and everyone. If you love
British drama, then you will love this. It has everything from sheer grit to absolutely
heart breaking consequences. You cannot watch this without feeling so many different
emotions, whether it is tears of laughter or tears of sadness. It will by far be the
best 3 hours you will ever watch and it will definitely be something you will want to
watch again and again. Martina Cole's "The Take" is nothing short of sheer brilliance.
