DESCRIPTION:

This dual language Chinese/English edition is beautifully designed.
This series has an introductory calligraphic introduction by Yang Zhao Ting, the former president of the National Chinese WuShu Association. 
The writer of the series, Geng Jun, studied under Su Xi, Su Fa and Li Zhuan Yuan. 
There are general notes and demonstrations of the Shaolin stances for the entire series. 
There's also a nice short color section on students and Geng Jun's activities. The side-by-side Chinese and English make this a very useful text with clear instructions.
THIS BOOK teaches one of Shaolin's more famous forms. The Plum Blossom design is a five petaled cross. In the old days monks would train on poles six feet in the air moving form one to another planted in this Plum Blossom design. 
This Kung Fu form has some leaps and light legged stances representing the actions on the balance poles.
