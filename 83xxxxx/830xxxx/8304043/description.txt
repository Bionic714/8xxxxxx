FAQs
Q: Is this the full game?
A: Yes

Q: Do I need anything else to play Skyrim?
A: No

Q: Is this up to date?
A: It is currently updated to version 1.9.32.0.8 (RELOADED update 13). To see if a newer version is available, check http://uesp.net/wiki/skyrim:patch

Q: Does this include the High Resolution Texture Pack?
A: No. Get it from https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8114627

Q: Which steam_api.dll did you use?
A: RELOADED's steam_api.dll from update 11 (12 kb)

Q: There is nothing in DATA
A: Your registry has a problem, probably from a previous installation of Skyrim. Go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREBethesda SoftworksSkyrim (HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREWow6432NodeBethesda SoftworksSkyrim if you're on a x64 machine) and make sure the Installed Path is set to the correct directory and that there is only one entry for Installed Path.

Q: Is this version moddable?
A: Yes. The only thing different from the retail Steam game is three files: SkyrimLauncher.exe, TESV.exe, and steam_api.dll. These have been patched to play without interference from Steam. Treat this like you bought it.

Q: Will you marry me?
A: No
