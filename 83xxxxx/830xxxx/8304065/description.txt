Sangeeta (Rekha) is a young, strong and       
idealistic girl. She is 25 years old, but     
unlike her contemporaries, she is still not   
married. The reason for this is her being a   
member of a poor family. Her father left the  
family; Her mother is an old homemaker; Her   
elder sister is a young widow; Her nephews    
have to go to school while their father, Her  
brother is an inebriated and unemployed man.  
All the members of this family live in one    
little house. She is the only one who takes   
care of them. She is the only one who works   
to support the family. She is concerned for   
her nephews' future and makes her best to     
bring them up and educate them.               
However, secretly, she dreams of the day      
when she could also have her own family,      
husband and children. Will this day come ever?
