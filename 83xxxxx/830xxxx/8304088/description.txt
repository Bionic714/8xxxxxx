Puscifer "Donkey Punch the Night" Review ΓÇö 5 out of 5 stars
Puscifer's brand new EP, Donkey Punch the Night, really does kick. 
There's a "wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am" satisfaction that comes from the brevity of this fascinating, focused, and fiery seven-song collection. However, as always with singer Maynard James Keenan's musical, artistic, and visual collective, there's a whole lot to dig into if you open yourself up to the music.
