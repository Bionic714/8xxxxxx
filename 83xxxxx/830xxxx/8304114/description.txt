  This story is of a charming little girl      
  called Chinu. She is born and brought up     
  in the aborigine Adivasi community and       
  therefore her upbringing has occurred in     
  a scenic freedom of the nature surrounded    
  by mountains and jungles. Having led all     
  her childhood in the picturesque atmosphere, 
  this young Chinu has developed a keen        
  attraction of the urban life. It is her      
  long cherished dream to migrate to a city    
  and adopt the lifestyle apparently free      
  from any of the rural inadequacies. The      
  film ΓÇÿChinuΓÇÖ is going to present the sharp   
  contrast between the journey of her dreams   
  and the harsh realities she confronts in     
  a city.
