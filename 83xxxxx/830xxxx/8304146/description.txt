Kayo Dot is an American experimental music group formed in 2003 by Toby Driver. They released their debut album Choirs of the Eye on John Zorn's Tzadik Records label that year.
Since then, Kayo Dot's music has undergone several identity shifts, largely influenced by the band's constantly changing lineup and instrumentation. One predominant element of Driver's compositional voice which remains consistent throughout all of Kayo Dot's output, however, is the band's use of abstract timing and performance cues.
The band have released six studio albums: Choirs of the Eye in 2003, Dowsing Anemone with Copper Tongue in 2006, Blue Lambency Downward in 2008, Coyote in 2010, Stained Glass in 2011, and Gamma Knife/Grey Dream in 2012.
