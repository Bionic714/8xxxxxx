Our Ceasing Voice

In the middle of the Austrian Alps, the post-rock quartett Our Ceasing Voice was founded in late 2006. To achieve their depressing, yet incomprehensibly beautiful sound, Our Ceasing Voice utilizes the perfect blend between hypnotizing ambient and epic outbursts soaking with melancholia.
