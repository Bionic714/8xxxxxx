"Without Words "began as an instrumental experiment by the Bethel Music community who set out to push the creative boundaries of worship. Each song offers a distinct listening experience and carries its own story. Songs from previous Bethel Music albums have been deconstructed and re-arranged into versions that hint at original melodies through unique instrumentation and modern sounds. Each track creates a dynamic, ambient, and cinematic atmosphere free from lyric and discourse. This album ventures into new territory and explores what it is to worship without words.
