,hotnutz,2013-03-27T02:11Z,i think once a few people get it fully downloaded and sstart seeding you hould be good but you could just leave your pc on when you leave
,borngeek,2013-03-27T10:03Z,"My other laptop crashed at night with blue screen, I'm not sure if the files were uploaded completely or not. 
So please don't download this torrent for the time being. I'll make another torrent of this. I also had the new Killswitch Engage album on it. Admin please DELETE this torrent. Sorry. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS, YOU WILL BE STUCK."
