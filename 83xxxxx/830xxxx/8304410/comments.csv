Release Description
Part personal reminiscence, part science, and part dire warning, Life Stories is a tribute to the extraordinary work of David Attenborough. Attenborough has served variously as narrator, on-camera host, writer, and producer for an endless array of superb nature documentaries, including, along with this one, The Blue Planet, Frozen Planet, Madagascar, Galapagos 3D, Africa, and Planet Earth, the greatest of them all–and those are only some of the more recent achievements in a career that now spans almost six decades."
