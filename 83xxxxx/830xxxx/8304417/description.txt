NOTE - This is a nine DVD collection put out in 2001 a various late 60s musical performances on the old Ed Sullivan show. Frankly, the production company did not do the worldΓÇÖs greatest job arranging all this material, and of course the limitations of broadcast TV in that era make for mediocre film quality. I have run everything through handbrake on the highest possible quality settings for decombing and such, so the majority of the artifacts should be removed. I did not bother separating each DVD into its little 20 minute segments, but rather just ripped each DVD as one big file. There is also a fair amount of repetition, so be prepared to see the Elvis and Beatles segments more than once. Additionally, if you turn on the subtitles using VLC, there are some interesting historical notes and whatnot that will appear.
