,ogstankyfluff,2013-03-31T03:34Z,did the studio actually release a flac version or did u just convert it?
[V],politux,2013-03-31T17:28Z,"It is ripped directly from the CD to FLAC.  You can see the log and cue files, if you bother to look. :)

Also, I don't upload transcodes."
,ogstankyfluff,2013-03-31T19:16Z,"but a cd is identical to 320kbps mp3, just not digital, your basically re encoding with a higher bit rate, thats why im hearing high pitches in all of your uploads. "
[V],politux,2013-03-31T19:23Z,"LOL, you have no idea what you're talking about."
