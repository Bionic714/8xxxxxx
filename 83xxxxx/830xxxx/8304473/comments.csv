,alex123456789123456,2013-04-12T14:36Z,"Thank you man,been waiting for this!"
,ClipperCigars,2013-04-22T19:47Z,"Thanks I guess, but ""newest"" doesn't mean better.  :/

The engine in Sexvilla has been broken ever since it went into the v7 series. Massive memory leaks that lead to crashing and absolutely ridiculous loading times are the two biggest known issues that they seem unwilling/unable to fix. 

I know back at V7.3.9.8, load times were supposed to have be fixed, but anything they did there didn't seem to have carried over to v7.4.

I'm going back to an older version."
,ClipperCigars,2013-04-22T20:06Z,"Well, seems like patch v7.4.9.9a might improve loading times. Anyone have that?"
,dnobody,2013-04-29T22:52Z,So how do I install this? I didn't get a readme.
,Steezy5,2013-05-08T10:09Z,"Everything works fine for me! This is the most up to date version that TK17 has to offer. 
MAKE SURE, you uninstall the previous version you have BEFORE installing any of this. if you have addon content installed before this update it will break your game."
