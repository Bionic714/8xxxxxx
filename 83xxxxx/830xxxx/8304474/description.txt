Lost Worlds: Series 1
Dig into the sands of time with this exploration into lost civilizations. Scientists, archaeologists, and historians alike search for evidence of cities that may have forever been lost to time. Some are ancient while some are surprisingly recent. Journey back to Jerusalem when Christ walked through its streets. Explore the mysteries of the Knights Templar. See Egypt when Ramses ruled and discover what it looked like in Braveheart's Scotland. Recent cities include Winston Churchill's secret bunkers and a Welthauptstadt Germania that Hitler envisioned. Graphic recreations and location shots bring these cities to life.



9)  The Pagans 
In the late Stone Age, the pagan people of the British Isles constructed some of the greatest monuments of the ancient world, fabulous constructions of wood, earth, and stone. In this hour, Lost Worlds travels from the ancient stone villages of Scotland's Orkney Islands to Southern England in search of the soul of the Pagan's mysterious culture. The Pagans reveals a startling new theory about the role Stonehenge played in the lives of the pagans, while computer animation reconstructs the monument as it appeared to them. Experts trace a forgotten ancient pathway to Stonehenge's lost twin--Woodhenge--and explore the secrets of Silbury Hill, the world's largest man-made mound. Finally, we'll visit Maiden Castle, a fortress that witnessed the pagan world's end.
