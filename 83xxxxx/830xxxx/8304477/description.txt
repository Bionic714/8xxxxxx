Day after Sandy is a Hidden Object game where we have carefully hidden 40 objects per level in a total of 10 levels to give you 400 objects to find. We have a level map which will remember your progress, we also have a hint feature that will help find those difficult objects and lastly we give you achievements and stars to earn. We have spent a lot of time to make sure that the graphics and objects are of top quality and will provide hours of fun.
