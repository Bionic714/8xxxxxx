Yay, I show off more oddness!

I'm aware that others have uploaded the Halo soundtrack as well. I'm just doing it (and most of my torrenting) for the absolute heck of it.

This particular collection has the official music for Halo: Combat Evolved, Halo 2 and Halo 3, as well as an unofficial soundtrack for Halo 3. (I have no idea how it came to be, but I have it.)

And before you complain: No, I don't have the final track in the official Halo 3 because I originally thought it was junk and deleted it. Then I found a track listing while making a playlist with the single album WMP sees. I haven't worried about finding it special, so if something else has it and you want a complete album, go for that one. Like I said, I do this for the absolute heck of it. :D
