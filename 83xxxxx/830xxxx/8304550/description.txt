Time Team

Series 20 | Episode 13 | Twenty Years of Time Team

In this special celebration of the nation's favourite archaeology programme, Tony Robinson relives the best bits from two decades and 230 episodes.

The programme takes in highlights from digging up the garden of Buckingham Palace to revealing the final minutes of a crashed Spitfire, and discovering the first stone circle to be found in Britain for 150 years.

It also tells the story of how Time Team grew from nervous beginnings in a Somerset field to include city-wide digs - and even nationwide events, when thousands of people spent the weekend digging their own back gardens.

Time Team has transformed the way millions of people understand Britain's history and heritage, and made a multi-million-pound investment in our archaeology along the way.
