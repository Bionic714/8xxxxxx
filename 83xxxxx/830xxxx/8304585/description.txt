65daysofstatic (also known by the abbreviations 65dos, 65days, or simply 65) are an instrumental post-rock and math rock band from Sheffield, England, comprising Paul Wolinski, Joe Shrewsbury, Rob Jones and Simon Wright. The band has released five studio albums: The Fall of Math, One Time for All Time, The Destruction of Small Ideas, We Were Exploding Anyway, and Silent Running.
Initially, the band interspersed heavy, progressive, guitar-driven instrumental sections with live drums and off-beat sampled drums akin to those of Aphex Twin, although since their second album they have developed their work to include keyboard parts.
