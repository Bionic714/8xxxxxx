There is no noise or crackling noise so you must be using some media player with an equalizer setting cranked up or your sound card is messed up.

What are you using to play the show?"
[V],wushdishmeen,2013-03-29T00:47Z,"@Powerslave - I see what you're talking about now but unfortunately it's a Howard Stern issue.  When listening to the actual Sirius feed this low frequency crackling is part of the actual show.

When switching to H101 listening to old sirius shows the feed is clear.  So it's not Sirius.  It's some sort of issue with Howard's studio.  During commercials the crackling goes away.

So nothing I can do about it.  Sorry.  But nobody else seems to care since they just want to hear the show as background noise during a their work day.  Not many audiophiles are judging Howard... it's talk radio not music."
[V],wushdishmeen,2013-04-01T16:41Z,"@powerslave -  Isn't that a little hypocritical? You were quick to blame me for the sound issues before I said anything.  Plastering ""crackling all through it... first time for WDM"" and ""another noisy audio file"" on my torrents without mentioning the possibility that it might not be my fault.   Apparently to you, the idea of me blindly releasing crappy recordings after 3 years of perfect audio is more feasible than Howard's studio having sound issues.

I did not hear these issues in the earlier shows because they were less frequent and nobody else has complained.  So I offered the possibility that it was your hardware.  Believe it or not,  I've had people complain only to find out it was their own ignorance.  So apologies for being jaded.

But regardless I didn't ignore your complaint and asked if anyone else noticed anything.  Someone pointed out one of the ""pop"" noises and I went and checked the actual Sirius replays as well as other people's recordings.  All of them experience the same exact sound distortion.

So yes...  this is Howard's issue.  We had someone call into H100 and told the call screener about the issues and they were told to ""go to hell"".   So apparently they don't care.  So I guess you should lower your expectations.

Today's show (April 1st) is even worse.  Being a perfectionist with a show that is known for having a horrible sound engineering team might not be the best decision.   Especially when you're getting it for free.  But you're welcome to try other rips and find the same issues for yourself.
