Duke: The Columbia Years 1927-1962

THE DUKE is a compilation of material recorded for Columbia, OKeh and the American Recording Company labels, from 1927-1940, 1947-1952 and 1956-1962. Duke Ellington was a great bandleader, a fine if underrated pianist (an influence on Thelonious Monk and Cecil Taylor), a prolific songwriter, and a superlative arranger, writing specifically to his musicians' strengths, and achieving unique instrumental voicings and textures. He constantly rearranged many compositions, so that, for instance, "Mood Indigo," would differ tremendously in its 1935, 1950 and 1970 incarnations. In consequence, Ellington's was one of the few big bands to survive the Big Band era (the early '30s through the late '40s) while retaining a genuine creative spirit. THE DUKE is a superb overview of Duke Ellington's sporadic residence at Columbia Records, capturing his music at many of its peaks. There's the madly upbeat Lindy-Hop swing of "Slap Happy," and the mellow, luxurious "In a Sentimental Mood" of the 1930's. The '50s begets the sweet jazz-pop of his collaboration with Rosemary Clooney, and soundtrack music (ANATOMY OF A MURDER), while in the '60s, Ellington, with his right-hand man Billy Strayhorn, tackled a re-casting of Tchaikovsky's "Nutcracker Suite," and a madly swinging face-off with Count Basie's big band. Though it's not definitive (few Ellington compilations could be), this fine set more than lives up to its title. CMJ (3/27/00, p.25) - "...This is an essential collection and a fabulous primer for the curious."
Vibe (3/00, p.214) - "...represents 3 major periods during which Ellington recorded for Columbia records, effectively chronicling the musical evolution of the composer and his incomparable orchestra....Here is the Duke's essence - elegant and playful, familiar and evocative..."
