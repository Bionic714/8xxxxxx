Only a Shadow captures Misty Edwards and team in a raw, fervently energetic, live prophetic worship concert. Recorded amongst a sea of Onething conference goers, the album features primarily new songs with a handful of familiar tracks from MistyΓÇÖs past decade of worship releases.

The album is framed between themes of the love of God and the resulting pledges of unwavering devotion fueled by this love, sustaining endurance and imparting vision for eternity amidst earthly trials. As is typical of MistyΓÇÖs signature style, both soaring and subdued vocals bear the same provoking, soul-stirring potency. Her penchant for cutting through embellishment to reveal the heart of a matter shines through in each track, resonating beautifully in this vast atmosphere of worship. Only a Shadow invites the listener to encounter the eternal Source of light from whom the foreshadowings of this age are cast.
