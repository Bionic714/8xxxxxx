ReleaseNotes:

Korn has made a career out of playing loud, angry rock & roll loud and angry enough
that placing the band in the unplugged setting has, until now, seemed unthinkable. But the risk has more or less paid off. Tracks such as "Blind" and "Hollow Life" work best in this new contextûûeach filled with a sense of drama but not melodrama, their essential emotional weight is given new heft by opting for intense calm rather than an epicûûand overwroughtûûmusical maelstrom. Others, such as "Twisted Transistor" teeter on self-parody; a guest turn from Evanescence vocalist Amy Lee for "Freak on a Leash" is inspired, one from the Cure for "Make Me Bad/In Between Days" doesn't quite live up to its promise on paper. But the band's reading of Radiohead's "Creep" is heartfelt and true, making this unplugged endeavor worthwhile and truly entertaining.--Jedd Beaudoin

GREETS

Everyone that has supported us over the years.  You know who you are.
We dedicate this small space to an RIAA snitcher/c0kewh0re by the name of Jax. She thinks it's perfectly okay to publish personal details on other people and solicit illegal actions from even more people. We felt we'd give her a taste of her own medicine. Btw, Her husband is the infamous Bear Bottoms from alt.comp.freeware; a former cocaine drug smuggling pilot; If you're in need of the white stuff, We suspect her husband might be able to hook you up.
Just give them a call or stop by. Tell them, HHI sent you.
