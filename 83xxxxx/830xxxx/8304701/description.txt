==================================================================================
The YahSoft deeply regrets the the delay by sending this episode.
The reason: a fiber optic cable was severed in the region where I live and it  left me 24 hours without internet connection, but you can continue to rely on the quality of my uploads.
PS: Brazil sucks!!
