as a result i must recommend that this torrent be avoided until it is resolved."

There are 9 separate files.  Are you talking about a specific one?  I tested them in VLC and have also played them on my t.v. using a hardware media streamer.  The audio plays fine on both.  Perhaps it's your player.  I have not experienced the phenomenon that you mention."
,heyyouguys,2013-04-12T16:24Z,"i have to take back my original statement where i say this isnt recommended.  this torrent works perfect on VLC, however my trouble was when i put the files on an external hardrive for use on my kids Wii.  having examined it a but further to problem lies in the fact that the Wii player cannot handle the framerate used in this torrent.  but that does not mean that there is a problem here at all.  sorry for jumping the gun.

to those who read my first comment i humbly retract it and issue an apology the meech.  this torrent is fine and is recommended to all."
