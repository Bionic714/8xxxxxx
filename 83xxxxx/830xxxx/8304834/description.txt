SESAME STREET - 40 Years of Sunny Days 
---------------------------------------

This Sesame Street special includes over 4 hours of Sesame Street clips spanning the first 40 years of it's history.  These were ripped from the 2-disc set.  They were presented by one big track for each disk.  However instead of making 2 big files (1 for each disc), I split up the files into approximately 30 minute chunks.  There are 9 files/parts altogether.  They were all split at an appropriate natural chapter break.

CRF encoding maintains a constant quality for all encoded videos.  It adjusts the file size/bit-rate as needed (every video is different!) to maintain the desired quality. "CRF"...file sizes never too little and never too big...sized just right to maintain a constant high quality across the board.
