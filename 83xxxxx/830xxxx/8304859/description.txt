Storyline: In a ill-fated attempt to spend some "quality time" together, a family crams into their RV and hits the open road to trace the steps of a famous ancestor and visit a theme-park run by a wily off-his-rocker sheriff (Tremblett). Wacky adventures are never far over the horizon in the wholesome comedy-of-errors starring Stern (CITY SLICKERS) and Hagerty (WHAT ABOUT BOB?).
