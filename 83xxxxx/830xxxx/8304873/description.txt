A man and a woman wake up in a hospital room. She's a nurse, he's a patient. Problem: a large metal object on his back. While the woman tries desperately to escape, the man experiences an inner struggle on the borderline of dream and reality, sort of. What has happened before? With its experimental soundscapes, remarkable filtering and razor-sharp editing the comparison of Tsuburo with Shinya TSUKAMOTO's Tetsuo is valid. Tsuburo offers the viewer the most artistic and surreal side of Japanese cinema.
