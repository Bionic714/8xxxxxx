,Bubbers83,2013-03-27T03:51Z,Quick question. Does anyone know if DC canceled the Ame-Comi Girls digital series? They haven't released it the past few weeks....
,Ahlat,2013-03-27T10:35Z,"Thanks for this issue STF; loving this series!

Bubbers83 I remember hearing somewhere that Jimmy Palmiotti said that it was on hiatus and they were waiting from DC to hear more."
,ScottyD7421,2013-03-27T21:21Z,"Thanks for uploading STFmaryville, much appreciated.

What was with the artwork in issue 10? The first 9 were awesome, as was this issue, but issue 10 is completely different and looks sub-standard compared to the rest. Still a great story line and i'm loving it, just wondering is all.

Thanks again :-)"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-28T03:47Z,"miller was probably rushed, and he's not a great artist to start.

this book has had what? 5 or 6 artists rotating? and i wouldn't call any of them great. ok or good, maybe. but not great. raapack is probably the best but he -- like 95% of modern artists -- can't possibly produce 10 pages a week. (digital first pages are cut in half to make 20.)"

,luicowboy,2013-03-30T04:30Z,"Thanks for uploading, STF! One question: Why does it seem that the printing issues are missing some of the digital chapters? Or am I crazy?"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-14T05:42Z,"i don't think you are crazy, but my best guess is you're thinking that the print issues keep up with digital... they don't, although there isn't a good reason that they don't. because they print 3 digital issues as 1 print issue, but print comes out monthly, print #3 is already 4 or 5 chapters behind."
