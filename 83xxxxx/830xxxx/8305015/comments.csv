[T],tifon,2013-03-27T18:56Z,Thank you.
[V],oneanight,2013-03-27T23:27Z,You're more than welcome... Someone had to put up a flac copy.. With artwork and If not me who ;)
,B0kk1e,2013-03-31T19:51Z,"Unfortunately, all 3 CDs are clipping heavily. This is either a bad rip or a bad engineered. Shame, because very good tracks are there but it's not listenable on any serious equipment. "
[V],oneanight,2013-04-01T09:20Z,There's nothing wrong with the rip.. All is good. I've just ripped another two physical copies I've got on different PCs exactly the same.. Most Ministry of Sound has questionable mastering.. I just find it funny that you have never made a comment on my other MOS flac uploads weird..
,B0kk1e,2013-04-01T16:11Z,"Don't get me wrong, I love your rips, but there is definitely something wrong with this one. If you say that the rip is OK, then all I can say is that it is badly remastered - engineered with a lot of compression and loudness, clipping on all songs. It sounds better on a cheap headphones than on some mid-range equipment. I guess maybe they did it on purpose. Cheers and keep up the good work."
,CaptainJackMix,2013-04-02T01:51Z,"Thanks for the rip.
Yea I noticed that. Recently iTunes has been issuing a lot of albums that are mixed/mastered with the intent of being listened to on low end headphones and earbuds, I wouldn't be surprised if MOS was (trying) to do the same thing.
But it's still a solid mix. Thanks oneanight!"
,l4uti,2013-04-25T19:01Z,"@oneanight thanks for the upload! Cant go back from flac to mp3! 
Would it be posible for you to upload a Flac version of the Ministry Of Sound Chilled House Session 4 2013 CD.
Thanks in advance!"
