About the book:
The idea seemed simple enough; tear a hole through space and time, travel back to the 1800ΓÇ▓s and impregnate HitlerΓÇÖs mother before she has a chance to conceive the Nazi tyrant. Somehow things didnΓÇÖt go so smoothly for super-scientist Dick ΓÇ£SharkbiterΓÇ¥ Hawke.

Now trapped in a world beyond his understanding and at war with a global empire, he must fight monsters, madness, and killer clowns to set things right, save the girl, and bring evil to its knees.

About the blue whale:
The blue whale is the largest creature ever to inhabit the earth. It has blood vessels so large that a full grown adult human who makes really poor decisions could swim through them. They are blue, or so their name implies, and also mammals. For more information on blue whales, look them up on the Internet.
