There does appear to be some improvement to overall dynamic range in this version, but there's spots of compressed brickwalls that aren't on the CD version. The constant frequency response does seem to get up to around 3k. But all that being said, my ears prefer the CD version of the album. The higher frequencies sound clearer and more pronounced on the CD to me. To each their own, and like I said a great vinyl rip if you're into that sort of thing."
