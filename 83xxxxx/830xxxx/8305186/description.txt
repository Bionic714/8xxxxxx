Review

These letters, written from 1958 to 1968, trace the growing friendship and fascinating arguments between the Trappist monk Thomas Merton and Czeslaw Milosz, the poet who was later exiled from his native Poland, yet went on to win the 1980 Nobel Prize in literature. The quest to make sense out of the human condition is the bridge between their worlds of literature and religion, and the two men have a lot to say to one another. Is humanity inherently good? Can art save us from ourselves? Can war be justified? These letters are worth reading strictly for the quality of the writing and the thinking, but they are also valuable as literary biography and cultural history.

From Booklist

The rare opportunity to share an intimate conversation of singular poetic depth is touching, from Merton's awkward first approach after reading Milosz's Captive Mind to a long silence after intense discussion of the Berkeley Free Speech Movement to the abrupt ending just before Merton's sudden death. Readers with an interest in either Milosz or Merton will find much of value here. They nurtured each other, and their 10-year correspondence is a sacrament of "the church of friends" named by Merton at the very end.
