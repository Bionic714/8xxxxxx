Athena.and.Helo.v2 is a 1080p video, 5.1 surround sound audio TRUE FANEDIT of Battlestar Galactica 2003-2009 that includes all of Athena's story and her relationship with Helo. Some Helo material is included that doesn't directly relate to Athena, for example Helo's time with Boomer in the miniseries and most of The Woman King story. All scenes where Athena has a line and almost every frame of when Athena was on screen is included. Additionally, Athena.and.Helo.v2 includes all non-Boomer Eights that are on the Galactica or around Helo, e.g. Rebel Eight from The Hub, the construction worker Eights, etc. This began as an edit with every Battlestar Galactica scene Grace Park was in and developed into Athena.and.Helo and Boomer.and.Chief. There is a standalone release for The Face Of The Enemy webisodes. Compared to Athena.and.Helo.v01, Athena.and.Helo.v2 is much more carefully edited, has fewer editing and encoding errors, has 448Kbps instead of 320Kbps audio, and the video and audio quality are better with v02 since Handbrake was used.

* As many special effects scenes were kept as possible, especially space battles and Cylon Centurions
* Some scenes just include Athena's part without telling the story of the whole episode, e.g. The Farm, Scar, The Passage, others
* Scenes without Athena and Helo but with important Athena or Athena and Helo discussions were included, e.g. between Adama and Roslin or Adama and Tigh
* Deleted scenes with Athena were integrated, even scenes that are short or do not add much to the story
