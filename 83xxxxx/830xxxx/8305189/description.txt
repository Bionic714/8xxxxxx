Boomer.and.Chief is a 1080p video, 5.1 surround sound audio TRUE FANEDIT of Battlestar Galactica 2003-2009 that includes all of Boomer's story and her relationship with Chief. Almost every scene where Boomer has a line and almost every frame of when Boomer was on screen are included. Additionally, Boomer.and.Chief includes all non-Boomer Eights that are on the Basestars with Boomer or around Chief, e.g. Athena meeting Chief on Kobol or the non-Boomer Eights involved in the Cylon Civil War. This began as an edit with every Battlestar Galactica scene Grace Park was in and developed into Athena.and.Helo and Boomer.and.Chief. There is a standalone release for The Face Of The Enemy webisodes. Note that Boomer.and.Chief has stretches of just Chief material or only snippets of Boomer, e.g. between 2.04 Resistance to 2.18 Downloaded and during Cavil and Ellen conversations from No Exit. Also, non-Boomer Eights are included even if it's for a small part of a scene. In comparison to Athena.and.Helo.v01, Boomer.and.Chief is more carefully edited, has fewer editing and encoding errors, has 448Kbps instead of 320Kbps audio, and the video quality is higher with lower file sizes since Handbrake was used. Deleted scenes, extended episodes, and The Plan were all included, see the .ngo for Boomer.and.Chief General Content Notes.

3) ALTERNATE VIEWING ORDER WITHOUT THE VERY SAD FLASH FORWARD: This is a "what if" ending that was completely possible and not so incredibly tragic like the producers decided to show; what if extradition never came up or never happened, Chief never broke out Boomer from the brig, Boomer never kidnapped Hera, and Earth was found anyway? What if Boomer could have found her love, family, and humanity?
