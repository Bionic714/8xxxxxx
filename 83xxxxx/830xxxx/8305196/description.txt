Ignacio Larranaga - Brother Francis of Assisi (Mediaspaul, 1994). 452 pages.

New scan. Searchable pdf (clearscan) with contents in bookmarks, accurate pagination and metadata, etc.


Ignacio Larranaga is almost unknown in the English-speaking world, and this book is almost impossible to find in print form. But Larranaga shouldn't be neglected - he's a very fine spiritual writer. This book is what you might call a spiritual biography of St. Francis of Assisi.

I strongly recommend Larranaga's Sensing Your Hidden Presence, the only book still in print in English by Larranaga.

Although the author is a Catholic writer, his message is valid for any Christian, any believer, and simply, for any man or woman, as already proved in many nations.
