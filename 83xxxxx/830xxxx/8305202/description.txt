

On March 26, 2012,  MuchMusic invited 40 fans to tape a new show called Super Fans. At least thatΓÇÖs what we told them. The fans were ready to spend the afternoon talking to host Lauren Toyota about their love for One Direction and were in for the shock of their lives when they found out that One Direction was in the building!

Watch what happens with 40 Directioners are surprised by the biggest band on the planet!

CAPPER NOTES

I meant to share this for 1D a while ago, but it slipped my mind.

Better late than never.

I'm not a fan, but I know it's sometimes hard to see these Canadian shows outside of Canada.. so here you go.
