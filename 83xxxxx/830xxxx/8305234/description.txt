Two books about Joyce's work by Anthony Burgess (author of A Clockwork Orange):

Re Joyce (Norton, 1965). 276 pages.

Arguing that "the appearance of difficulty is part of Joyce's big joke," Burgess provides a readable, accessible guide to the writings of James Joyce.

Review

"Burgess has written a study of the most brilliant and humane of twentieth-century humanists." Philip Toynbee - The Observer

"Recognizing the coming and cosmic in Joyce, [Burgess] proceeds with his self-imposed task of unraveling meaning by scrutinizing the layers of a mind that was encyclopedic in dimension. . . . He has defined the perimeter of Joyce's adventure in both Ulysses and Finnegan's Wake. . . . It took Burgess to place Joyce's satire in its proper orbit." - Saturday Review


-----

Joysprick: An Introduction to the Language of James Joyce (HBJ, 1973). 187 pages.

The book is aimed at helping readers new to Joyce to appreciate his genius, and is a particularly useful guide through the complexities of Finnegans Wake.

Burgess provided the following explanation of the book's title: "Any reader of Finnegans Wake will see that it is a fusion of Joycesprach, joystick, the prick that brings joy and the prick of conscience or agenbite of inwit."
