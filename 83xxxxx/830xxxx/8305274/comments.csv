,Keepee1,2013-03-31T10:51Z,Thank-you . I saw this once as a child and fell in love with Lesley Ann Warren for the rest of my life. 48 years later I get to relive it in colour.
,drslash33,2013-04-16T03:55Z,I saw this on our B&W TV when I was 5. I sang the songs to my kids from memory during the 80's and 90's and again with my newest child. Now I get to let my 9 year old daughter and 8 year old Grand daughter see where I got them. Thanks!!!
