I uploaded this because TPB is missing this version completely and it can be quite difficult to find. There is one other link on TPB for this film but it is broken and there is not a single seeder. It is one of the best interpretations of the film in my opinion.  

This is my first upload ever to TPB so any feedback would be much appreciated. Long time user, first time uploader! Please seed and thanks to everyone for making The Pirate Bay what it is today! Keep up the good work. I hope everyone enjoys this!
