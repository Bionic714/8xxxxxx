Just curious..."
,Superflow,2013-03-27T22:56Z,"TheLathe: this is not the same, it has a much higher bitrate."
,kevin6432,2013-03-28T04:35Z,I have this on my seedbox.  Going to leave it up for a few days.. Uploading at 2-3 MB/s...

Yeah, I guess so; it's just that people usually don't release 2 different versions of the same 720 print (or 1080 for that matter)  Just never saw that before...  I snagged the full 44 Gig Blu-ray from BOZX anyway  : )

Thanks again mate!!!"
,Superflow,2013-03-28T18:42Z,"TheLathe: Well BOZX does it all the time. It's about choice I guess.

I already saw this in the movies so I don't even have to download it to check if it's worth buying. It is :)"
