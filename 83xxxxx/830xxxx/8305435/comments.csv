,CaptainEvil83,2013-03-27T05:03Z,If this is real why is the file size so small?
,dascorpion88,2013-03-27T05:05Z,Probably just converted his FLV that was uploaded 15 mins ago to an MP4
,jibbajabbax,2013-03-27T05:12Z,"it's real, and the file size isn't small for 40 minutes of video.

however, the actual filename is

The.Ultimate.Fighter.S17E10.26th.March.2013.HDTV.x264-Sir.Paul.mp4"
,rowsol,2013-03-27T05:13Z,"My ratio is at 6.0 cmon, seed you fucks."
,hulkcum,2013-03-27T05:17Z,"its gotta be real Strajow has NEVER let me down he is usaully first with this show.
Hey Strajow can't wait for the Brazil version with eng subs i know you'll be onto it soon enough, thanks for the quick work."
,Strajow,2013-03-27T05:19Z,I do not upload fakes. EVER. 
,Strajow,2013-03-27T05:20Z,also this is not the flv file converted to MP4. kids these days 
,Strajow,2013-03-27T05:21Z,"hey hulk I will get you the first ep with subs now, give me a bit as just got home and have a few things to do. But it's coming my friend!"
,Strajow,2013-03-27T05:21Z,..
,brewerchch,2013-03-27T05:22Z,real?
,SheldorTheConqueror,2013-03-27T05:44Z,"The file size is the same as the Sir Paul release... why rename it and take credit for others work and not just pass along the rip.
+not so many would question if it's real.  Just 2c."
,Strajow,2013-03-27T05:51Z,.. damn comment bug still going around
,Strajow,2013-03-27T05:52Z,"so if its the same size it must be someone else's? wow now i've heard it all. dont dl it, wait for the sir paul release or sec's.. Easy"
,Strajow,2013-03-27T06:04Z,the sirpaul release is 379.95mb.. big mouth know it all's jibbajax and the other muppet get your shit right before coming on here talking that nonsense haha!
,shav00,2013-03-27T06:06Z,"Haha Strajow, I have seen your uploads around, youre legit!"
,hapticyo,2013-03-27T06:22Z,"On it's size it's actually 60 - 80MB larger than previous episodes so, small? I think not.

Quick skim through partial download it's defiantly legit. Now if you downloaders will unlimit your upload I might get more than 3KB/s :P

Thanks Strajow"
,jibbajabbax,2013-03-27T06:31Z,"LOL.  This *is* the SirPaul release, you tool.

What a jackass"
,OhZombie,2013-03-27T06:33Z,Why can't anybody fucking seed? Once you get to 40% I get to about 1kb/s speed. Fucking leeches.
,jibbajabbax,2013-03-27T06:33Z,"Good job.  Run it through a quick re-encode?  Trying to get all your bases covered?

Learned your lesson after all the earlier '-Strajow' stuff was the exact same as the SirPaul releases?

*roll*

I mean, seriously...  tbh, I don't really give a shit about you stealing credit for releases.... but, like the other guy said, it sure would stop all the dumbasses from asking if it's real or not."
,Strajow,2013-03-27T06:36Z,haha ok jibbajackshit! if you say so boss haha :)
,Strajow,2013-03-27T06:38Z,re-encode?  bahaha wow this guy is on another level. lay off the pipe man. 
,Strajow,2013-03-27T06:39Z,and your welcome all that has said tnx and is seeding! go get the Brazil Ep1 of S02 if you all want to. Its Subbed!
,Strajow,2013-03-27T06:41Z,"http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8305653/TUF.Brazil.S02E01.ENGLISH.SUBBED.WEBRip.XviD-Strajow.avi

,KShelbrock2,2013-03-27T06:53Z,"So typically i go Secludely for these but you were faster, hopefully the quality is the same."
,hulkcum,2013-03-27T07:01Z,"@jibbajabbax who cares who's release it is, stop trolling you tool"
,gw5050,2013-03-27T07:06Z,"Don't listen to these fools Strajow. Everything I have downloaded from you is ALWAYS spot on. 
You contribute so much to so many, and for that I'm really grateful. 
To the person who is claiming this is Sir Pauls work....Well, even if it was WHO CARES!!  Strajow DOES NOT need to claim others as his own...do some research."
,KShelbrock2,2013-03-27T07:10Z,"also, if you guys could go into your settings and allow for legacy connections thatd be great.... 151 available seed and 0 connected..."
,gw5050,2013-03-27T07:14Z,"@ jibbajabbax - Who cares. The point is, Strajow has made it available. So regardless of ""Whos"" you think it is, why not just appreciate it."
,gw5050,2013-03-27T07:27Z,Where did my comments go? lol
,ButchCoolidge666,2013-03-27T07:50Z,"we need a seeder, stuck at 44%"
,ButchCoolidge666,2013-03-27T08:21Z,"@qw5050 yor comments didn't go nowhere. when you refresh the page, you send an http request to the server, which replies that the page was not modified and your browser loads the page from its cache memory, and that's the page before you posted the comment."
,slovoh,2013-03-28T03:00Z,"Strajow rulez!
Whoever fuckin' tries to trash fun of copying whatever from wherever/whoever on TPB is a tewl (jibbajabbax)"
,_Neurotix_,2013-03-28T03:10Z,"Thx for the ul strajow ^^  Would be even better if you could include vids specs in your futur uploads desc... Maybe not full specs but at least codecs, dimensions & bitrates.  Good job anyway, really appreciated :)"
