Vocalist Eddie Vedder, basically being a man of very few words, tends to get your attention when 
he does speak above a mumble. And when he tells the crowd in Verona that, because it's been so 
long since Pearl Jam played there, they are going to play a longer set, you can bet he's not 
kidding. Heck, the 12-song encore, which includes "Black," "Evolution," "Better Man," "Alive," 
and "Porch," would have been worth the price of admission alone. The 19-song set that precedes 
is certainly no disappointment, either. Sure, there are a few out-of-tune moments early on in 
"Hail Hail" and "Animal," but that's part of the magic of these discs. There's not a Pearl Jam 
CD unrepresented in this amazing performance, as well as a few rarities, such as a snippet of 
Tom Waits's "In the Coliseum" and the very raw and unrehearsed but utterly sweet version of 
"I Got You," which the band sort of stumbles through. It's shows like this that truly capture 
the spirit of this "bootleg" series, capturing the spontaneity of a set (or songs) that may 
never be played the same way again. --Adem Tepedelen
