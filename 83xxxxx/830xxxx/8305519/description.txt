The Witcher 2 Assassins of Kings Full PC Game with minor Updates. I have tested it out and seems to be working pretty well!



Defining new standards for realistic, non-linear game narration, The
Witcher 2 spins a mature, thought-provoking tale to produce one of the
most complex and unique RPGs ever released on consoles. In addition to
its epic story, the game features a complex combat system that
uniquely combines dynamic action and tactical depth.
