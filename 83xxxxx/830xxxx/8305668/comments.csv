His 720p is more like 400p and his 1080p is more like 700p. And the audio is crap. Especially if you're watching this on a TV, download a bigger file."

,FureeTutawk,2013-03-31T01:51Z,"GUYS download Yify, if you want a smaller file so you don't clog up your hard drive and for a lower connection speed, yify is the best quality small size available and STILL has great quality! "

You have great movies and plenty of haters like bluejay who have dedicated their free time to following you around just to post negative shit about you. Now that is epitome of success--to be so good that people hate you for it. You should be proud. And thanks, your movies are the best and I never think twice about downloading one of yours. Keep up the good work. "
