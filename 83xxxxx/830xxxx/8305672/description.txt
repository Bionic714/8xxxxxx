Entire run of the second doctor portrayed by Patrick Troughton, 119 episodes of which 61 are reconstructions and 2 are animations. 

It's unfortunate that so many episodes of the 2nd doctor's stories were junked but the reconstructions give a good representation of what they would've been like. The fan reconstructions (uploaded by JohnnyFanboy) have linking narration between the dialogue whereas the loose cannon reconstructions (uploaded by Eldoctorio) have subtitles, all have a resolution of 640x480 with clean soundtracks.

I was able to get the Lost in Time boxset, so the episodes from these partially missing serials are my own DVD rips: 
The Underwater Menace (Part 3), The Moonbase (Part 2 and 4), The Faceless ones (Part 1 and 3), The Evil of the Daleks (Part 2), The abominable Snowmen (Part 2), The Enemy of the World (Part 3), The Web of Fear (Part 1), The Wheel of Space (Part 3 and 6), The Space Pirates (Part 2). 

All the DVD rips have the following specs:
Video: Container - MKV, Codec - h264 @ 872 kbps, Resolution - 640x480 (4:3 aspect ratio)
Audio: AAC @ 128 kbps
