 - Video @ 1770 kbps (default DVD quality is > 5000)

 - Audio @ 95 kbps (default CD quality is 1411 kbps)


And this is not a old DVD or CD, this is  BLURAY!!!


 Even a YouTube video have better quality (video @ 50000 and audio @ 384kbps)  (http://support.google.com/youtube/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=1722171)

 Don't know why YIFY don't show this info on description, maybe they are ashamed of this dramatically murder quality to get low file sizes.


 IF YOU LOOKING FOR A GOOD QUALITY VERSION GO TO OTHER UPLOADER. "
,mind26,2013-03-27T10:26Z,LOL even the 480p version from youtube have higher bitrate :O
,Getabrain,2013-03-27T11:06Z,"Well Yify, now that you write ""the best 720p/1080p on the internet in small size"" in the beginning of the subtitles you propose with your movies, we know your ambition. The problem is, your 720p are not even bluray and your 1080p (witch are more like 720p) are crapy 1/2 of the time. You have a bunch of fanatics young people who consider you as a God because they don't see the difference when they see your movies on their phones or small laptop, but the day they will buy a big screen, they will hate you and regret to have blindly downloaded ""your"" movies.
I mean, sometimes you make decent copies, sometimes you don't. Don't you realize it is dishonest from your part? Don't you realize the time people lose with you when they have to download another copy? Don't sacrifice all for the size, learn the equation Size/Picture Quality! If you want to be the best, be the best but verify your ""products"" before!
Ok?"

,sci3ntist,2013-03-27T22:48Z,"Lol, some people always look for something to complain about. No one got time for 6-10GB per movie..Thanks YIFY. "
,ddmac,2013-03-28T01:08Z,"V - 10 - A - 3
be cool if you could tweak the audio up a notch"
,demetria69,2013-03-28T01:54Z,"@sci3ntist, you look like you have no idea about quality man, if you look for small file size go for 720p but with a good quality.

I post this info about quality and you guys complain? this is essential info that yify should show but they don't, I make negative feedback obviously because I would like better quality instead of 95kbps shittly audio."
,HKCannibal,2013-03-28T07:04Z,"For the individuals who posted comments complaining, I will not waste my time nor to mention their names.
Look at the file size, do you think magic is a video in 1080 have this size, it is obvious that the file was reduced their bitrates, both audio, video as.
I really like the versions YIFY exactly why, because as usually watch own computer do not worry too much about that, now who wants to watch tv in a larger, or a sound system with higher quality, there are numerous other versions of other groups, and do not waste your time commenting crap coming here."
,Getabrain,2013-03-28T11:04Z,"For the cannibal individual: I want these YIFY files as much as possible. This Trainspotting is rather good actually. Of course, the subtitles are HI, but who cares about right information, right? Here you find subs without HI:
http://subscene.com/subtitles/trainspotting/english/479883
But it is stupid to propose movies with shit quality when you could have good quality with maybe 300 MD more size. Specially when you say everywhere that you are the best.
But don't worry for me, I find better small size HD movies from others too. Everybody want to spare size, it costs money to stock movies. I am just trying to help and try to make YIFY better."
,HKCannibal,2013-03-29T01:11Z,"@Getabrain I agree with your point of view, I believe that some features should be improved in YIFY releases, I do not use the subtitles provided for them, nor knew this self entitlement, without comment.
Anyway, in the first comment, I mentioned that people think it's some kind of magic the file is small, want to make an quick download, but then are complaining about the quality, and do not even know what they're talking about, spewing out a lot of bullshit."
,Getabrain,2013-03-29T14:03Z,"Thanks HKCannibal, I appreciate."
,bluejay21,2013-03-29T23:22Z,"GUYS DON'T DOWNLOAD FROM YIFY if you want ANY amount of quality. His file sizes are so small because he converts the video using ridiculously low bitrates. His 720p is more like 400p and his 1080p is more like 700p. And the audio is crap. Especially if you're watching this on a TV, download a bigger file."
,stvgl,2013-03-30T05:59Z,"It's a little too low on the bitrate side but that said - people here seem to think it's only the bitrate that matters, it doesn't. Also, old movies generally don't have crisp quality since they used film. Get the bigger versions if you want to watch it on a 50"" screen."
,Dalubai,2013-03-31T05:17Z,"Same whiny retards in every film that YIFY uploads, Jeez..."
