[V],SecTPB,2013-03-27T07:24Z,"This is a comment that is completely useless, yet I need to add a comment in order to see what the 2 new comments are, as I am quite curious, so reading this was officially a waste of your time and my time by writing it out. It's still useless, so why are you continuing to read? TPB has a comments bug, and my curiosity wants to see what people said, and this is the only way to fix it. By adding another comment. Oh, come on... are you still reading? I told you this comment was useless. Do you like useless things? If you like useless things so much then you should consider buying a Snuggy. Now those are useless. The end."

,extracube,2013-03-27T16:45Z,"Just being honest here, I didn't notice improvement over all of your other 400p vids I've downloaded.  But then I didn't scrutinize closely and I'm using an old machine too.

Nonetheless a great watch as always!"
