,demetria69,2013-03-27T10:03Z,"BAD QUALITY.


 - Video @ 1770 kbps (default DVD quality is > 5000)

 - Audio @ 95 kbps (default CD quality is 1411 kbps)


And this is not a old DVD or CD, this is  BLURAY!!!


 Even a YouTube video have better quality  (http://support.google.com/youtube/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=1722171)

 Don't know why YIFY don't show this info on description, maybe they are ashamed of this dramatically murder quality to get low file sizes.


 IF YOU LOOKING FOR A GOOD QUALITY VERSION GO TO OTHER UPLOADER. "

I will wait for your upload :)"
,Getabrain,2013-03-27T11:15Z,"Well Yify, now that you write ""the best 720p/1080p on the internet in small size"" in the beginning of the subtitles you propose with your movies, we know your ambition. The problem is, your 720p are not even bluray and your 1080p (witch are more like 720p) are crapy 1/2 of the time. You have a bunch of fanatics young people who consider you as a God because they don't see the difference when they see your movies on their phones or small laptop, but the day they will buy a big screen, they will hate you and regret to have blindly downloaded ""your"" movies.
I mean, sometimes you make decent copies, sometimes you don't. Don't you realize it is dishonest from your part? Don't you realize the time people lose with you when they have to download another copy? Don't sacrifice all for the size, learn the equation Size/Picture Quality! If you want to be the best, be the best but be good then, Verify your ""products"" before!
Ok?"

,dalesteyn,2013-03-28T04:48Z,"always has been  a problem with YIFY...WORST AUDIO ever....BOKUTOX is a crap uploader..who believe in quantity not in  quality...most of his movie doesn't contain sound at the credits part...now that's a fucked up way to reduce your file size....1080p movies must have bitrate over 2000kbps (min.),so i will wait for the ANOXMOUS/zen_bud upload...YIFY GET YOUR SHITS TOGETHER...you are a part of this community,we want you here providing the ""BEST"" service....so think bout it..."
,bluejay21,2013-03-29T23:20Z,"GUYS DON'T DOWNLOAD FROM YIFY if you want ANY amount of quality. His file sizes are so small because he converts the video using ridiculously low bitrates. His 720p is more like 400p and his 1080p is more like 700p. And the audio is crap. Especially if you're watching this on a TV, download a bigger file."
,madmax315,2013-04-08T19:29Z,don't mind them yify this morons are out there mind..upgrade your equipment shit heads...!!!
