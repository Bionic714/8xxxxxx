,Malakore,2013-03-31T18:02Z,"I can confirm that this appears to be clean (NOD32) and only connects (Comodo Firewall showing all IPs/ports) to minecraft amazon servers to verify that you have free registered account.

Also I just tried Tekkit Lite, Tekkit Classic and Voltz - all downloaded and running with no problems.

One issue that I've found thought, and not a small one - no matter what account you log in with, you are playing as a ""Player"" instead of your nickname. Which makes it pretty much impossible to use this launcher for any server, even if it's offline mode one, since you are going to fail trying to register your ""nickname"" using server-side authetification system.

In case you would like to play online, old Technic launcher (cracked) does this properly. Also, TeamExtreme Vanilla launcher (in case you don't mind the hassle downloading, putting together and configuring all the mods manually...)

Apart from that, thank you very much and looking forward to future releases. Hopefully with this nickname issue sorted out ;)"

I see why that's happening, my mistake; I should have looked deeper into the login process and I would have seen it then rather than now. I'll have an updated and fixed version up later today."
