 - Video @ 1770 kbps (default DVD quality is > 5000)

 - Audio @ 95 kbps (default CD quality is 1411 kbps)


And this is not a old DVD or CD, this is  BLURAY!!!


 Even a YouTube video have better quality  (http://support.google.com/youtube/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=1722171)

 Don't know why YIFY don't show this info on description, maybe they are ashamed of this dramatically murder quality to get low file sizes.


 IF YOU LOOKING FOR A GOOD QUALITY VERSION GO TO OTHER UPLOADER. "
,mind26,2013-03-27T10:23Z,"Agree, screenshots look good because are static frames, but with this ultra-low bitrate looks bad, and the sound even worst, please make at least 320kbps!"
,Getabrain,2013-03-27T10:53Z,"Well Yify, now that you write ""the best 720p/1080p on the internet in small size"" in the beginning of the subtitles you propose with your movies, we know your ambition. The problem is, your 720p are not even bluray and your 1080p (witch are more like 720p) are crapy 1/2 of the time. You have a bunch of fanatics young people who consider you as a God because they don't see the difference when they see your movies on their phones or small laptop, but the day they will buy a big screen, they will hate you and regret to have blindly downloaded ""your"" movies.
I mean, sometimes you make decent copies, sometimes you don't. Don't you realize it is dishonest from your part? Don't you realize the time people lose with you when they have to download another copy? Don't sacrifice all for the size, learn the equation Size/Picture Quality! If you want to be the best, be the best but verify your products before!
Ok?"

Thanks for the UP YIFY.  These are perfect for the tablets for the kids and on the road."
,Kanegasi,2013-03-27T20:54Z,"The quality is fine for 1.4 GB. If you want better quality, why are you people downloading something that's less than 2 GB? You guys are the idiots. I personally love YIFY's work (with exception to a few screw-ups the past few weeks) because I'm not stuffing my movie drive with 5-10 GB files. Space is a premium for me and this is the best you can get 1080p at these sizes."
,Infenix13,2013-03-27T21:02Z,What's the difference between unrated and other one?
,Vorrrz,2013-03-28T00:07Z,"@GetaBrain What the fuck is your problem, every single upload from YIFY is fantastic. Just because you TV is fucking terrible and probably lags its ass off doesnt mean you have to have a go at the uploader. If you have a problem with the uploads then go buy the movie you cock sucker in stead of complaining."
,Vorrrz,2013-03-28T00:09Z,"AND IT DOESNT SAY ITS 1080p Bluray. It obviously states the file being a rip and if you knew anything you would know that any file looses quality when being ripped. SO SHUT UP AND ENJOY.

Ps. YIFY keep up the fantastic work im 100% behind you"
,ddmac,2013-03-28T01:10Z,"V - 10 - A - 3
be cool if you could tweak the audio up a notch"
,torrentjl,2013-03-29T01:45Z,"@Vorrrz 
it does say at the very top BrRip which typically means it was ripped from a bluray disk, although it wasn't ripped at the best rate. For a visual movie like this a 1080p YIFY rip should be aimed at 2GB.


@ Infenix13 
I have googled and looked everywhere to see what the difference between the Unrated and the Theatrical was, however there is non. There is no Unrated blu-ray out there. There is some extended scenes that didn't make it into the Theatrical Cut, but they are only a few seconds.
Maybe that is what this Unrated cut is, if it is true what I said, it should be named Extended Cut because Unrated makes it sound like the movie was originally R rated but was cut to a PG rating.

@everyone else 
Even though it isn't the best quality we do have to thank YIFY for putting the time in to upload this movie.

,bluejay21,2013-03-29T23:19Z,"GUYS DON'T DOWNLOAD FROM YIFY if you want ANY amount of quality. His file sizes are so small because he converts the video using ridiculously low bitrates. His 720p is more like 400p and his 1080p is more like 700p. And the audio is crap. Especially if you're watching this on a TV, download a bigger file."
,phuckstic,2013-03-30T04:59Z,"Yify is no god...but, he does a decent job and puts out volume...a lot of the movies come out well...some are terrible...Cast Away for example was horrific to be labeled hd...had to turn up the volume on my Bose speakers to hear anything...Yify you must up the size some or stop the hd tag you put on everything...but, I must thank you ultimately for putting out the movies I enjoy "
,ix9nine009,2013-03-30T05:00Z,"yes it has low bitrates
but this kind of file is great when you only have
a 2.1 speaker or lowend 5.1 system and a 32"" TV or lower

if you have a high-end HT setups you should download unripped blu-ray files.

yes you have a High-end HT system but you download a low bitrate file then whines because the quality is rubbish? or even give a bad reputation to the uploader? haha are you guys idiots?

maybe this whinners are other movie uploaders to yet YIFY become a threat to them. :D"
,torrentjl,2013-03-31T00:35Z,"I only download his 1080p, sure it looks very close to 720p quality but still it is very watchable. I usually watch his movies on my 46"" 1080p 240fps LCD, which they look very good. Not so much this movie but his other movies are fine. 
I also play his movies on my 95"" projection screen, using my 720p bright projector. All his movies look fine on that, probably because the projector isn't that sharp.

I own a lot of his movies on my hard drive that I use with my hd player, I love how many movies I can keep on my hard drive and still have sooooo much space for other movies.

When I play his 720p it looks very bad, pixelated and such."
,joser116,2013-04-06T19:35Z,"I understand YIFI that the reason for why you have low bitrate audio is because of file complaints, but increeasing the bitrate audio to the next level wouldn't hurt. Im sure many people wouldnt mind an extra couple of megabytes."
,Bulbouswhore,2013-04-11T02:22Z,You can do better than this.....
