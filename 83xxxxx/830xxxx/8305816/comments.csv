Just delete it as I beleive that was just one of the novels another uploader converted to txt format, when it should be in the torrent with all original interior art in pdf format...at least I am pretty sure of it.....I just wish I could get my grubby little hands on the marvel/curtis magazine and comic run then this would really be complete!"
