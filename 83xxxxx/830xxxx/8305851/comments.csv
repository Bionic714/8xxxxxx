,srkaren,2013-04-14T01:36Z,Dear AQOS - GMT + xxxlavlxxx thank you for this great movie.  the download was excellent.  I appreciate the smaller size.  God bless you.
,michaelrwatson,2013-04-26T01:42Z,"@srkaren: 1.39 GB is not ""smaller"". It's much *larger* than it needs to be. There's virtually no perceptible increase in quality going from 700MB to 1.39GB. I mean, why not make it 8 GB then and get *all* that quality..?"
