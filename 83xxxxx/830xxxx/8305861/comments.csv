,mkhth,2013-03-29T19:28Z,"this is a bad transcode. someone took the current 256 aac leak and converted (transcoded) it to .mp3 v0.

not an authentic .mp3 v0.

""trusted""

...right"

Just remember to buy a copy in your local record store to support both local business and Tyler's kitty cat shirt fund. "
,SynthGunR,2013-04-01T09:17Z,"Legit, good quality, good download"
,radcattony,2013-04-10T17:07Z,"This torrent isn't the full version! There are important parts missing.. i just realized one right now but I bet there are more. At the end of DOMO23 Tyler calls his dad, gets no answer and then Answer start.. I was listening to the torrent on my computer and the cd in my player.. the part really felt missing. For people who want the whole album and the full production and story THIS ISN'T COMPLETE :("
