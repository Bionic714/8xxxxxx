By the way I have read many rumors of the  return  of Demonoid. But I think it is wishful  thinking. Reading between  the lines it seems like a lethal take-down. 
Thanks again for the Mexico  USA  game."
,Sloth753,2013-03-28T11:19Z,Many thanks for this!  Been hoping to watch this for days!  Any chance you can get USA vs Costa Rica in the blizzard?  Or any other CONCACAF WCQ games  that you be the bees knees.  Thanks again for this.
