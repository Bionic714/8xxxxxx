Ghosts and Angels is the first-time collaboration between classical composer Amanda Handel and electronic artist Greg Seiler (aka Comatone). The album began with field recordings Amanda made in Spain, which were then sampled and manipulated by Greg Seiler. The pair then worked together to mold and layer textures which complimented AmandaΓÇÖs prepared compositions.
