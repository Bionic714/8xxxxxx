gotta love WKW movies

not to be mistaken for your typical martial arts flicks

his movies are works of art. visual, music and all, gotta appreciate them all!"

No subtitles whatsoever. Have to get it elsewhere.

Audio good.
Video good.

Movie kinda slow, as its not your typical action packed martial arts movie. But hey, this is a Wong Kar Wai movie. If you watch his movies, you'll know what to expect. 

Slow but beautiful movie none the less.

Have to watch it more than once to understand whats going on and the subtleties in the dialogue.

Will most probably be buying the DVD/BR for this."
,D0gmeat,2013-03-27T23:28Z,Yeah hardcoded Chinese subs. Getting any external subs would make it a hard to read as a result.
