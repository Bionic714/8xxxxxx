This film, but rather a TV show devoted to the problems of "pig." More precisely, when the problems have yet mature. Psychologist advises guests of the studio, carefully listens to them and offers solutions. No need to explain that the first collisions occur on the basis of sexual misunderstandings, insensitive relations between partners, intolerance. And sex is not acceptable. That's a sex therapist - a psychologist will confirm it!
