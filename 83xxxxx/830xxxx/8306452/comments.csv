NOT MY DOING BUT I HAVE NOTICED
SONG 99 AND THE NFO ARE NOT SEEDING
99. Show me the way - Peter Frampton is stuck at 99.37
and the nfo is 0% 
I had to use another computer to check this i was curious as to why everyone is at 99%.. so if it's these 2 files your after i'm sorry.. click stop on your client - remove the .torrent - download again but uncheck the 2 mentioned and you will become a 100% seeder to the rest of what you've got.. I've tried a few things, the folder was not altered after i created the original .torrent.. so it's a fault in utorrent..."
