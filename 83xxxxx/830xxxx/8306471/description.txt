Update Notes

Sniper Ghost Warrior 2 Siberian Strike is  set  in  an  isolated  Siberian
location and will offer a more open world experience for solving missions
Players will not be guided and the only way to find their way through  the
new location is by using the map

In the remote abandoned Siberian city of Birsovik, the Russian  government
established a top  secret  military  installation  focused  on  arms  R&D
American intelligence gets  word  that  the  facility  shifted  its  focus
recently to weapons of mass destruction. A CIA operative, M. Diaz is  sent
in undercover, posing as lab personnel, to  uncover  the  truth.  When  he
stops sending in reports,  a  search  mission  is  quickly  put  together

The player steps in the  shoes  of  Cole  "Sandman"  Anderson,  a  veteran
special ops sniper, now in the ranks of Task 121 - a group put together to
counter any WMD-hungry warlord's  whim  in  the  Asia  -  Pacific  region
Anderson is ordered to locate Diaz's GPS signal and assess  the  situation
on  the  ground,  then  extract  any  intelligence  he  may  have  found
