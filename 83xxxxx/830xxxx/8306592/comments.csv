,VegitoDBZ,2013-03-27T23:30Z,"Black box would never be this big, Bullshit"
,arcaneguilt,2013-03-28T02:49Z,"It seems it is really this big, tho..."
,anthonymesakh,2013-03-28T02:53Z,"come on guys, give this guy a chance. just look at his account, he's trusted."
,Reborn36,2013-03-28T13:11Z,"check skidrowcrack site ,its this game

,haiimhardass,2013-03-28T13:18Z,This torrent is shit. I wasted time on this when I could've been downloading one that doesn't try to run you through an ad scam. Don't waste your time on it
,dogoserf,2013-03-28T21:37Z,"Yes different torrent to blackboxrepack site, could well be a scam - could uploader verify pls"
,lrdgarth,2013-03-31T01:16Z,Never had a real Black Box release require anything scammy. Can anyone confirm?
,lrdgarth,2013-03-31T01:17Z,And 11GB from an 18GB title is pretty good for BB. I wouldn't expect them to be able to make it much smaller.
,vinivitesmw456,2013-04-01T04:13Z,"FINALLY A DECENT TORRENT, THANKS! Getting an average of 180 kbps
Much better than 0,2 kbps from the the first one I saw..."

,iamraleigh,2013-04-08T20:05Z,360 controller work for this one ?
,dudleycar,2013-04-12T18:38Z,"***ATTENTION PLEASE READ***

This god damn torrent is filled with adware. It installed some toolbar called conduit and took over google as my main search engine (search conduit virus for more info). It also installed several other programs called browsetosave and two others I can't remember. Not only does the adware fuck you over, but it also prevents you from playing the game - the game crashes at the main start screen after you press any key.

I really don't know how skidrow approved this torrent."
,indium3,2013-04-16T08:36Z,Plz..... Upload in more less size than this
,phat_71,2013-04-27T03:55Z,"Anyone who thinks this torrent is ''too big'' to be a BB release is a complete moron. It's 11.5gb, where the original game is over 18gb, meaning it has been reduced in size by 37% which is pretty impressive for a game this size.

And for those who aren't bright enough to know this is a BB release, go to the BB website and get it from there, it's identical to this one but their torrent link has almost 500 seeds and 800 leechers."
