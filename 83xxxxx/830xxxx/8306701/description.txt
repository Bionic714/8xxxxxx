Revenge is an American television primetime drama that airs on ABC starring Madeleine Stowe and Emily VanCamp. It debuted on September 21, 2011, and aired on Sunday nights at 9 pm Eastern/8:00 pm Central. The pilot was screened early on ABC's website during a promotional tie-in with Amazon Kindle.
The series was picked up for a full season by ABC after garnering a high 3.3 Nielsen rating in the all-important 18ΓÇô49 age advertising demographics for its pilot episode and regularly winning its timeslot against every other television network (CBS, Fox, The CW, and NBC) in 18ΓÇô34 demos. Madeleine Stowe was nominated for the 2012 Golden Globe Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a TV Drama, while the series was nominated for Favorite New TV Drama at the 2012 People's Choice Awards. The series currently airs in 39 countries worldwide. Revenge has become ABCΓÇÖs highest-rated series in WednesdayΓÇÖs 10 p.m. timeslot since Lost's 2006ΓÇô2007 season and has become the only new series in more than four years to replicate the 18ΓÇô49 demo ratings success that Lost had in its timeslot since leaving the air.
On May 10, 2012, ABC renewed the series for a second season, which airs on Sundays at 9:00 p.m. Eastern/8:00 p.m. Central beginning on September 30, 2012, in the time slot previously occupied by Desperate Housewives.
