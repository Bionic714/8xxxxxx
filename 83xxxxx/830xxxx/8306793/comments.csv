---------------------------------------
 Alright I made an account just for this to help you guys SO FUCKING LISTEN UP.

There is a fucking easy way to get around the Project GO site YOU NEED AN EXISTING unsubscribed account, I haven't paid for about 2-3 months now and its working fine, its so fucking easy, just use the NoRedirect plugin on firefrox and add the following entry
^http://(?:[^/]+.)?simplepickup.com

This turns off the redirecting on Project GO so you wont redirect to the shitty sign up for project go page.

Here is the steps.

Download and install the NoRedirect plugin for FF, restart FF.

go to tool and NoRedirect.

click ADD on the right,

paste in this ^http://(?:[^/]+.)?simplepickup.com

tick source.

move it to the top by clicking MOVE UP.

click OK.

go and log into your unsubscribed Project GO account.

click on any of videos, podcasts or any PG content.

then enjoy!
--------------------------------------

And now for some more information from me:
IF YOU CAN ONLY SEE THE VIDEOS, HERE ARE THE DIRECT URLS TO ALL THE CATEGORIES (as of 27/03/2013)
Videos: https://www.simplepickup.com/pgo/nav/video
Q&A: https://www.simplepickup.com/pgo/nav/qa
Podcasts: https://www.simplepickup.com/pgo/nav/podcast
Bonus: https://www.simplepickup.com/pgo/nav/bonus
Live events: https://www.simplepickup.com/pgo/nav/vokle

I would upload everything on here but I'm on limited bandwidth so I can't... hopefully someone else will."
,Satona,2013-03-27T17:51Z,"And apparently there's no edit function on TPB so...

In the links I gave you, you may have to change https to http OR change
^http://(?:[^/]+.)?simplepickup.com
to
^https?://(?:[^/]+.)?simplepickup.com

in the NoRedirect plugin."

,Satona,2013-03-27T18:56Z,"To make an unsubscribed account, just go to https://simplepickup.com/premium/signup/index/c/ and fill in all the information. Leave the payment type on ""Credit Card"" and then click Next.

At that point, your account will be created. Obviously, don't enter any credit card information, just use that unsubscribed account to go through the website."

I did exactly the same as you described in your comment and I also created a unsubscribed account. But when I click on the videos, it always shows ""Sorry
The creator of this video has not given you permission to embed it on this domain. This is a Vimeo Plus feature."" 

How can I solve this problem? I live in Germany, maybe that matters?! Please help!!"

@ All simplepickup followers/ everyone else
The trick outlined by Satona and cerebro13 is in fact legit. Follow those instructions, they work.
 If you do have the extra money however, please actually pay for the subscription as it helps out the SP guys. 
         Good luck players!"

,zakco,2013-03-28T03:13Z,"@internetboxer
Firefox addon DownloadHelper. It will download any video, any site."
,zcrixx,2013-03-28T03:20Z,"I would FUCKING LOVE the guy who posts all the Q and A. Honestly, it's a fuckton of Q and A and if someone already downloaded them it would help greatly if they were to upload it here. Please!"

,Armadared,2013-03-28T18:39Z,Everybody who have been having trouble viewing videos even with an account should try to disable any flashblocker addon that you have installed . I too had this viewing  problem and this simple trick solved it. Do let me know if this helped. And special thanks to Satona for sharing this wonderful trick.
