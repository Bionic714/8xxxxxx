There is this mindset that you cannot approach a girl who is eating, and this mindset is dead wrong. Jason shows and teaches you how to approach a hot girl while she's eating and get yourself in the right state to create a very intimate setting. It's a different type of an approach, where food gets interchanged from one mouth to the other.
