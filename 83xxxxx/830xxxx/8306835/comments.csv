,highresjunkie,2013-04-01T10:36Z,A video bitrate of under 698 for a 720p is borderline substandard. You're just asking for pixelation and blocking. YIFY's version is better (850) and Jalucian's is better still (900.)
,highresjunkie,2013-04-01T10:43Z,"*below 700, rather"
,grvnvt,2013-04-01T18:19Z,"@hiresjunkie: anoxmous is doing a fab job with the uploads. No one is asking you to compare ! If you like, download, else just use another source. In most case YIFYs audio quality is way below par.
Try ripping & uploading a movie yourself to learn and appreciate the hard wrk by these guys! "
