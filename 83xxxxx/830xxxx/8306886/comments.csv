if only eztv and the rest of the tv fast crew would just get a clue and get with .avi!"
[T],ajaxen94,2013-03-31T15:15Z,@pamolama I totally agree with you eztv have shoved mp4 down our throats but I think Xvid avi is more universally user friendly it plays on more machines than mp4 and everbody doesn't want to have to buy new to have to play it
