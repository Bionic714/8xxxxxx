Chasing Mummies with Dr. Zahi Hawass
Digging up ancient treasures is dirty and dangerous business, and nobody knows that better than the legendary Egyptologist Dr. Zahi Hawass. History's cameras follow closely as he and his cadre of fellows unearth astonishing finds and tackle some of the world's greatest archaeological riddles, from who built the pyramids to the location of Cleopatra's tomb. It's a whirlwind tour, led by the man who holds the keys to Egypt's greatest antiquities and rules his world like a modern-day pharaoh. Unfiltered, entertaining, exciting and suspenseful, "Chasing Mummies" lets viewers share in the thrills and hardships facing the team and crew as they toil to reveal what lies beneath the sand. With its wealth of historical information and blow-by-blow coverage of world-altering discoveries, this series breaks new ground-literally.

Finding unopened tombs in modern-day Egypt is very rare indeed, but with all his fellows in tow, Zahi heads to Sheikh Sobey and discovers an amazing mummy inside a sarcophagus. Also, Zahi makes it clear to the world community that every important Egyptian artifact must be returned to Egypt. And so, a missing piece of an offering table is headed back to Karnak Temple in Luxor from New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art. It's up to Zahi's consulting archaeologist, David Cheetham, to safely transport the piece from the airport to the museum--or he will he have hell to pay! Can Cheetham juggle the piece and the fellows' growing discontent with Zahi's program?
