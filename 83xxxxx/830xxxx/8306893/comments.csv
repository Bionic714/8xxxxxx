[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-27T15:06Z,"thanks Calel1234 and LOL, well uploading is pretty easy. you couldn't pay me enough money to sit there and scan/rip files from the web! **especially** not at 8a.m. if the last kryptonian is here in america!"
,Calel1234,2013-03-27T16:05Z,"Well, as easy as you say it is, a lot of the previous uploaders just stopped or aren't consistent so props to you."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-27T18:34Z,"hey that could be me, if my isp jacks up my monthly bill! so far, so good -- with my 6-month unlimited free trial up, my first 'full price' bill only went up by 15 bucks... we'll see what they think when they notice i've used about 600GB...

anyway, TPB comics has the best group of uploaders. some people get burnt out, come and go, but really, great bunch of men and women."
