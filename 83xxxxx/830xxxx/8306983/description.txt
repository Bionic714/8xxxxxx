"WRATH OF THE FIRST LANTERN" continues!

The First Lantern turns his formidable gaze on Atrocitus and shows the high king of vengeance that everything he believed about himself, the universe and rage has been pitifully wrong. And that's just for starters.

Meanwhile Rankorr's attempts to live a normal life end in tragedy... and a fight to the death with Bleez!
