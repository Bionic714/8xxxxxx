,vegetatower,2013-03-28T05:27Z,Having a runtime error after i choose the language for the installer the other torrents failed because the source file was corrupted or something
,wadegb,2013-03-28T06:20Z,"installer works perfectly and jesus this game looks fucking good, i'm gonna shell out the 60$ and nab this game because christ this looks good"
,VegitoDBZ,2013-03-28T06:56Z,"seed you fucking clowns, now it's only 2 kb/s :C"

,juniorbox,2013-03-28T17:53Z,how do you change the language to english ????
,juniorbox,2013-03-28T18:02Z,i need to know asap
,fuckclaw,2013-03-28T18:05Z,Nvm i think i mustve been so excited that i forgot to select english for the interface when it was prompted. thanks for the torrent!
,fuckclaw,2013-03-28T18:06Z,@juniorbox after the screen where it asks you where you want to save the file it gives you a choice of english interface or a russian one. Its default is russian so if you forget to select english you have to delete and reinstall the game. NOT THE TORRENT
,RockyDesigne,2013-03-28T22:06Z,Installing it now Hope it works:D
,Vinyl_Scratch,2013-03-28T23:32Z,"100% legit. Been playing for a couple of hours now, no problems, no viruses, no nothing whatsoever. Will be seeding for around a week."

,bonethugnharmony,2013-03-29T10:02Z,"It´s a great download and the fastest one out there thus far. Only pain in the ass is you have to puzzle piece the shit together WTF is that. That´s the only cheesy part. Great installer and visually pleasing. Just don´t fuck up during install or a few hours can turn to wasted time if the installer fails. @NZupload, next time just iso the shit bro, it´s easier. peace !!!!"

,Alexanderhudson89,2013-03-29T20:12Z,Can someone help. it tells me im missing the .dll file
,disturbed434,2013-03-29T21:25Z,"Ok guys... I downloaded this yesterday and finally got it installed. Works just great. The only problem I ran into were the runtime errors that may show up when running the installer---> Turn off your antivirus or firewall when attempting to install. It will fix the problem. Also, if you're having any other issues, I have no idea what it could be lol... Anyway, it's a heavy game and it may lag the first time you run it, but the game is amazing, so enjoy"

,bonethugnharmony,2013-03-30T08:05Z,"@NZupload, Amazing job. The installer is a work of art. The manual creation of the three DVD folders are really a snap. Kudos, awesome job. Now I know why you have that skull dude. Keep kicking ass. Awesome Game. Thanks NZupload, God Bless."
,free3dom,2013-03-30T10:20Z,"@iDaud the song in the installer is ""Beast"" by ""Nico Vega"" :)"

,Demian95,2013-03-31T12:47Z,"would you kindly put the name of the songs
10/10 torrent"
,Mcdovin,2013-03-31T23:57Z,"Hey, I trust this is a great torrent as I have downloaded quite a few NZupload torrents without issue, but despite the fast speed 1.5MB or higher at max, I can't install this fully. I've made three folders called DVD 1, 2 and 3 as well as making sure I have more then the required amount of space. As others have previously said, the installer makes it to about 25-27% and then just randomly quits without warning. Every time I redo the install it goes a bit further in percentage, but it's doing the same thing as X-COM and The Sims 3 Blackbox Complete. I thought it was my PC, so I tried installing on my laptop and had the same issue. I love the music though, great choice from RG. 

I've finally made an account after MANY years of using torrents and aside from the three releases I've listed, I've had minimal issues with the games I've downloaded. Say what you want, but I try to follow the ""use this release as a demo of sorts to test your system and see if you like the gameplay, then buy if you like it"". So if anybody would like to provide some insight into the problem, I and many others would truly appreciate it. 

If I had better internet I'd fully upload some games from my private collection as well as music and such. I truly love what the community does and will continue to support tpb and other sites similar since unnecessary censorship is wrong.

Anywho, I'm going to give it another go and monitor the install and let you know what happens. 

Thanks NZ and friends."
,Mcdovin,2013-04-01T00:04Z,"Oh yes, not meaning to double post/comment but the two songs are: 

Will The Circle Be Unbroken sung by Elizabeth's voice actress, Courtnee Draper, while the backing guitar is played by Booker's actor, Troy Baker. 

Nico Vega - Beast "
,haseo1998,2013-04-01T01:44Z,"Please tell me if you find a fix for it Mcdovin, I've tried everything I could think of to make it work. I even watched the whole install and I saw it quit at 28.3% without warning"
,lexsord,2013-04-01T03:26Z,"guys , i install the game and works fine but no sound how can i fix that ? the sound never worked"
,Mcdovin,2013-04-01T04:26Z,"Okay so an update on progress, I actually made it to where it asked me to insert Disk 2. I right clicked Setup and chose under Compatibility Windows Vista Service Pack 2. Hey it went to about 35% so it's doing something. Bioshock Infinite folder is 5.87GB's.

I'm on Windows 7 Ultimate x64 just so you know."
,Mcdovin,2013-04-01T04:30Z,I also put it to Russian as a test so that might've had an effect on the progress. Trying English again to see what happens.
,Mcdovin,2013-04-01T04:48Z,"@lexsord Hey how exactly did you get it to install?

If the Russian version installs properly, I might just use that as my benchmark version then shell out $60 for the legit if I love it; which I believe I will."
,haseo1998,2013-04-01T05:00Z,"Thanks for telling me Mcdovin, I used Win 8 so I'll try to set it to the service pack :)
Btw i also created a file just for help"
,haseo1998,2013-04-01T05:40Z,"Did what you did, also got prompted to insert disk 2, created a disk 2 via a poweriso file, the insert pade had question marks (?) all over it, tried to get the disk 2, when I tried it just said there was an error a little while later"
,j0n00111,2013-04-01T05:51Z,For those getting the xinput3_1.dll error make sure you tick the directx setup during installation or install afterwards from http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8109

,masterboyaka,2013-04-02T02:23Z,"when install

an error occurred while unpacking archive corrupted! unarc.dll returned an error code -7 error archive data corrupted

in 60.3%

WTF 
?"
,Mcdovin,2013-04-04T19:20Z,"So an update.

I got the game installed on my friend's laptop but no go on my Desktop.

I copied over the files to my laptop and am running the game on the main PC through LAN if that makes any sense.

My laptop isn't really that great so I obviously can't play it at all; integrated Intel GMA 950 chip.

But when I installed on my friend's laptop, I ran it without changing anything (the installer I mean) and it went all the way through.

When it asks you to choose DVD's 2 and 3 just replace the 1 with a 2 or 3 and it automatically continues. 

The release is great, and until I can get the good laptop back from my buddy... I'll just manage my method. "
,Asian95,2013-04-04T19:22Z,@haseo1998  How do I install it with PowerISO?

,haseo1998,2013-04-05T03:21Z,"Also downloading on a laptop, will update progress by changing language and not changing anything after that. Will update progress later."
,haseo1998,2013-04-05T05:45Z,"still can't, will just download his other torrent"
,TheOtherGuy42,2013-04-05T08:50Z,"Installed great, kinda annoyed of the Russian text at first install, but I simply deleted the Rus folders and now the game runs in English. However, now my game won't get past the first room of Columbia where the guy wants to baptize you else it crashes."
