,luvtoshare,2013-03-31T16:57Z,"V 6/10 A 7/10 (except for first 1.5 mins is different language)

this one is better then the March 23 upload from S4A "
,luvtoshare,2013-03-31T17:12Z,"V 6/10 A 8/10 (except first 1.5 minutes is NFG)

overall it's a watchable cam.  Thanks scene for the upload.

also maybe the reason there are no comments on A/V yet is they are not showing up?  says 8 comments at the time I'm writing this but only 3 show up.  

This might be a duplicate from me as i'm not sure if first comment made it up."

V/8
A/7

As stated, the first minute of audio is not there but after that the audio is really good (for a cam). There was only 1 sync issue which was about 15-20 minutes from the end and fixable using VLC. 

The picture started off shaky with the dude adjusting the cam but that lasted less then  minutes or so, after that the picture was really good quality. Brightness was good also.

All in all i would say if you can stomach the first 2 or 3 minutes (which isn't really that bad) definitely give this a shot.

Cheers"
,cmass,2013-04-02T02:41Z,@ moditor and zoki701 WHY WOULD YOU JERKS Put up a solution that asks for a credit card and for a person to create a logon to watch movies? If we wanted to do that then we would be using this site for the FREE world IDIOTS.
