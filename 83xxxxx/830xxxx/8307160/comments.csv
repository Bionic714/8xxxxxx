,budchap,2013-03-28T06:35Z,Information Only: Hard coded Arabic subs and Watermark top left corner from the original encoder I presume.  Doesn't impact negatively on the viewing pleasure.

,mowgus,2013-03-31T06:22Z,"Aspect ratio is off, audio level very low (VLC at 200% audio and volume cranked and I'm still not hearing all the dialogue).  HUGE ripper creds on the bottom part of the screen during the opening scene.  All and all, a shite rip.

And, to be honest...I stopped watching after 15 minutes due to the cheezy over-acting crappy directing."
