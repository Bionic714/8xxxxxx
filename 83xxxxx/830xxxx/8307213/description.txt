The band was founded by Steven James Bayless, the driving creative force behind the project and a self described “obsessive perfectionist.” An avid producer and recording engineer, Bayless spent 5 years developing Strangeletter’s sound in his Portland home studio, carving out what would become Strangeletter’s self-titled debut album – released independently in the fall of 2009. In it, Bayless channels his anxieties, dreams, and paranoiac tendencies on this 12-track epic, exploring themes of a fractured, disintegrating world, the desire for new beginnings, madness, mania, serenity, and the indelible tenacity and spirit ingrained in humanity’s collective unconscious.
