,piratesynity,2013-03-27T21:32Z,@dhjudasx please can you do a 1080p 5.1 rip of Django Unchained? Thanks.
[V],dhjudasx,2013-03-27T22:16Z,"django is not out officially until April 16th.. at which point I don't typically receive in the case of a me preordering for 2 weeks or more most cases..

I'm also a little flat busted broke atm lol

And no.. I never download bluray sources.. all my are direct in my hands... physical bluray discs that own myself. This guarantees pristine quality, can't beat it.. for a source... It also guarantees it's a region 1/A format and no cinavia issues.

Patience.... ;)"
,jalucian,2013-03-28T01:51Z,"Judas, do you happen to remember how many torrents you uploaded before you got your skull, and was there anything else required to get it, like getting a recommendation from someone, for example?"
[V],dhjudasx,2013-03-28T02:33Z,"I got my pink trusted skull at around 65 torrents uploaded....

then I got my green vip skull at about 120ish I think.... it was the on the torrent ""The Mummy Tomb of the Dragon Emperor""."

now this has become a priority :)"

@dhjudasx:

Thanks for replying me sir, I will wait some more time for your ALL terminator movies release in a complete pack including the skynet edition of terminator 2 and also the ultimate version. Which ever comes first. 

Terminator 3 your theatrical version is Okay for me.

Terminator Salvation Director’s cut has 3mins more runtime.

Please take your own time to upload these movies, there is no rush for me. If you upload next month also ok for me.

Thank You Sir."
,jalucian,2013-03-30T04:24Z,"If that's kinda standard, I'm more than half way there. I've uploaded 38 as of today. :) You and YIFY were the reasons I taught myself encoding btw. You guys are inspiring and shit. :D I've actually talked to you briefly on YIFY's site back when he had the chat room up, but I use a different name there. Like YIFY though, I've been doing mine in 2 channel as opposed to 5.1 (I love that you offer both on dual audio tracks btw) mainly because I'm targeting those who watch movies on their computers and the majority of those people don't have 5.1 systems... but I'm considering adding it as an option the way you do. BOZX also has high quality stuff, but the bitrates are so high that his target audience must be people with 50"" HD screens. His file sizes are HUGE (10-12gig for 1080's) and that just isnt practical for those who watch and/or keep movies on their hard drives. Anyway, just wanted to let you know that you were an influence for me! Thanks for everything you do!"
[V],dhjudasx,2013-03-30T15:25Z,"glad to be of some help...

I actually watch my encodes on a relatively highend 55 inch Samsung led tv.... but I've watched them on a 146 inch highend projector too..

I also run a 4k display at home to do some of my work on... and mostly where I test my encodes on a properly calibrated display.  this is how I can usually try to fine tune things if I find the color banding and craw is too noticeablye.. 4k display uses 1 pixel to fill 4 pixel spaces on the display making oddities or artifacts stick out like sore thumbs...

as I've stated.. even some of the movies encoding at twice the bitrate sometimes look poorer than mine or yifys"
,jalucian,2013-04-05T05:13Z,Sent you a friend request over on KAT. Maybe we can talk sometime.
,alaglon,2013-04-05T21:35Z,"Hey. This just finished downloading, but when I play it, something weird happens with the audio.
It plays fine for a few seconds, but then a really weird echo/reverb develops, and the rest of the film would be like that (with a 2-3 second audio echo) if it isn't paused or skipped.
Do you have any idea why it is doing this?
Thanks."
[V],dhjudasx,2013-04-07T08:58Z,"Are you using Quicktime to play the video?

That seems to be a hardcore glitch that is commonly presented to me.

Apparently apple still hasn't fixed quicktime to support proper dual audio track support.

Use another Video Player to play the video. So far I've ONLY been informed of such playback problems like that with quicktime."
,surek666,2013-04-11T22:14Z,"Hey judas, I just wanted to say thank you for all your amazing Rips, I'm downloading a lot of stuff from you because the audio/video are just incredible.
I noticed you do a lot of animated ""Pixar"" kind of movies, any chance you'll be uploading the Ice Age films someday? "
[V],dhjudasx,2013-04-13T08:45Z,"actually yes.. almost ALL the Pixar movies will be uploaded... and any shorts that may go along with it..

I'm also working on the dreamworks animated 3d movies too... Shrek collection for example"
,surek666,2013-04-13T20:47Z,"Remarkable! I'll be looking forward to it, thank you very much :)"
