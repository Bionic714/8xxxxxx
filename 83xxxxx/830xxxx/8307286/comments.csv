The ""crackling"" or static noises only occur when audio is coming from Howard's studio.  Wrap Up Show is in a diff studio and you'll notice the sound issues aren't there.

I even checked other people's recordings of the show and the same noises are there.  So Stern's sound engineers need to wake up and realize it.  I wish I could fix it but I can't.

Scott The Engineer must be sleeping on the job."
