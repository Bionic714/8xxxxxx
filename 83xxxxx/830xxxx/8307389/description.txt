Another ballet extravaganza from Powell and Pressburger, this short was made at about the same time as The Tales of Hoffman, and has a similar appearance.

Viewers will be comparing this with the Micky Mouse interpretation, however even the music is composed by Walter Braunfels, not Paul Dukas.

If the piece is taken on its own merits, it works very nicely (although the voice-over poetry is unnecessary). 

Good visual quality this time.
