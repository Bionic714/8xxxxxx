Dig into the sands of time with this exploration into lost civilizations. Scientists, archaeologists, and historians alike search for evidence of cities that may have forever been lost to time. Some are ancient while some are surprisingly recent. Journey back to Jerusalem when Christ walked through its streets. Explore the mysteries of the Knights Templar. See Egypt when Ramses ruled and discover what it looked like in Braveheart's Scotland. Recent cities include Winston Churchill's secret bunkers and a Welthauptstadt Germania that Hitler envisioned. Graphic recreations and location shots bring these cities to life.




10)  Palenque 
Deep in the jungles of Southern Mexico lays Palenque, one of the greatest lost cities of the New World. Built in the 5th century by the Maya, this amazing city flourished for centuries before being mysteriously abandoned by its people. Now at this ancient site a team of scientists, engineers and archaeologists are seeking to uncover the secrets of its builders and unravel how the city would have looked at its height. For the first time, using state of the art computer graphics and cutting edge science, we resurrect these great temples, palaces, majestic aqueducts and dark labyrinths to reveal them as they once were. What the team discover could change our understanding of this great Mayan city forever.
