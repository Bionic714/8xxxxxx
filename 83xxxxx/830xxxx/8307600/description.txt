***********NOTE***********
Before commenting on quality, the movie is meant to be (filmed) VERY grainy, dark and foggy looking. It looks as though it was filmed by candlelight on purpose, which is one of the reasons I like it (that and the massive amount of sex in the movie). It is a very under rated and underappreciated Johnny Depp flick, and another of my personal favorites. Enjoy!

SEED PLEASE! I have limited bandwidth, so I try not to upload new movies until there's at least 5 full seeds. I have LOTS more classic movies to up, so if you like my work please help out and seed, which saves me from having to seed old uploads.

Please comment, feedback is nice to keep me motivated and to let me know if my work is any good. Thanks
