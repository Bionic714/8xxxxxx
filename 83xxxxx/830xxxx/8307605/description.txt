Information
------------------------------

The first World War II aircraft to fly over 400 miles per hour straight and level. It took the advantage away from the Japanese and out performed the "Zero" in every respect. Fast, powerful and maneuverable, the Corsair had an incredible kill ratio of 11 to 1. Called "Whistling Death" by the Japanese, the Corsair's 2,000 horse-power engine, six 50-caliber machine guns, and 4,000 pound bomb capacity made it a key weapon in the defeat of Imperial Japan. The F4U was in production longer than any other US fighter of WWII. Truly it was the last and probably the best prop driven fighter. This film provides both an expert account of the Corsair's capabilities and a vivid visual record of its combat department with US Marines and US navy. Included are test pilot Boone Guyton, Don Jordan of Pratt & Whitney relates the building of the engine. Lt Gen. George Axtel and super Ace Joe Foss tell of combat operations. Charles Lindbergh's superb war effort and combat is narrated by Boone Guyton and Joe Foss.
