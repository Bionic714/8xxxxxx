Yossef Bodansky is one of the most respected-and best-informed-experts on radical Islamism in the world today. In "Chechen Jihad", Bodansky draws on previously unseen intelligence from his insider sources, to offer the most comprehensive-and startling-portrait of the Chechenization phenomenon and what it means for the war on terror. As he reveals, the final years of US-Soviet relations left Chechnya as a fertile breeding ground for the mujahadin, and in the past decade a combination of militant native Chechen anti-Americans, anti-Russian agitators, and Middle Eastern jihadis have joined forces to help al Qaeda and the greater Islamist movement pursue its war against the west.As Bodansky points out, "the Chechens are professional fighters- disciplined and responsible, with a combination of skills, expertise, and character that has made them the most sought-after 'force multipliers' in the movement." Authoritative in its detail, chilling in its implications, "Chechen Jihad" is a book no one with an interest in the future of the West should miss.
