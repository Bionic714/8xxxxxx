Storyline It's a drug that promises an out-of-body experience with each hit.
On the street they call it Soy Sauce, and users drift across time and dimensions. But some who come back are no longer human.
Suddenly a silent otherworldly invasion is underway, and mankind needs a hero. What it gets instead is John and David, a pair of college dropouts who can barely hold down jobs.
Can these two stop the oncoming horror in time to save humanity? No. No, they can't.
