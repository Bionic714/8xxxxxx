ThereΓÇÖs a good reason Dilbert and The Office are so popular: todayΓÇÖs most popular sport is mocking life on the job. After all, the average work environment is filled with undesirable people, unpleasant situations, and hours of clock-watching boredom. So whatΓÇÖs a person to do but get this subversively funny gift book? ItΓÇÖs a sanity-salvaging guide for someone on the fast track to burnout. Waiting for the copy machine?
Stuck in a claustrophobic cubicle? Then pillage the supply closet, and make the most of a bad situation by creating projects that range from the ridiculous to the sublime. Relieve cubicle hell with Post-it┬« note mosaics or a privacy ΓÇ£curtainΓÇ¥ made from key rings and ID tags. Deem yourself Employee of the Month, and craft a glittering crown embellished with colored paper clips and highlighters. Help pass the afternoon with a game of ΓÇ£Boss Phrase Bingo.ΓÇ¥ From beauty pickups (a correction fluid manicure) to novel ways to get even with an evil co-worker, these fabulous activities could be considered brilliant exercises of whimsyΓÇªor grounds for termination. Tongue-in-cheek, on-location office photography will have readers laughing out loud.
