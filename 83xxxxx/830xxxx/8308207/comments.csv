Is there any chance that you might have THE SACRED AND THE PROFANE by Dean Motter & Ken Stacy in your treasure trove?

or even the Alan Moore adaptation ""Light of thy Countenance"" one-shot?  

No worries if you don't."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-28T04:21Z,"here's the moore book, binderguy1: thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8309502/

,binderguy1,2013-03-28T05:00Z,"The Sacred and the Profane came out in the '80's.

It was first serialized in Epic Illustrated for a bit, and if memory serves me right, and completed as a graphic novel for Eclipse Comics.

It's been awhile, so I could be wrong about who published it in final format."

#20 through #26 have the The Sacred and The Profane, serialized as 7 chapters. i don't believe the work changed/improved when eclipse collected it later."
