resolved their IP addresses to weed out duplicates 
and grouped them to prevent wasting queries:"

[V],LegendaryAxeman,2013-05-05T23:15Z,"If those don't work you can add these but go easy on them 
because they are small and usually overloaded:

udp://208.83.20.164:80

udp://91.121.150.186:6969

udp://121.14.98.151:9090

http://87.248.186.252:8080/announce
http://87.248.186.252:6969/announce

Always remember to immediately remove trackers 
which cannot help you because they already have 
a heavy workload, even the big ones in the first group.

(I hope this gets through. The comments 
system appears to be broken again,)"
[V],LegendaryAxeman,2013-05-05T23:57Z,"Here's another one.  
It looks good for the first of those two lists:

,Chaoticdeath,2013-05-29T09:46Z,thanks LegendaryAxeman! :D i will be adding those and making a more up to date tracker list soon!
