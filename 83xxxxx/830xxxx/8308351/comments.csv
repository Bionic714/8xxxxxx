,nftoast,2013-03-28T00:35Z,"Thanks again Albiondean

I have noticed that today you used mp4 format - will this be the new normal - instead of avi files??

positives:  superior picture, smaller file.

negatives:  more demanding of a cpu, and not playable on a DIVX disc for a DVD player.

Just Saying."

For anyone wanting to convert to AVI, Freemake Video Converter is great, I had problems with MP4 and Matroska files until one of the uploaders on Pirate Bay pointed me in the right direction :)"
