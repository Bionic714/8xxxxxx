Is there any chance of doing the transformer movies?  "
,circulatethetapes,2013-04-07T23:21Z,@deadmeat238 Thanks. There are already some good quality syncs of the Transformers movies around so I wasn't intending on doing them.
,wtaf,2013-04-26T06:06Z,This is not a real Riff. It's also painfully unfunny. 
,circulatethetapes,2013-04-29T00:32Z,@wtaf It's a RiffTrax Presents sold from the main site and I clearly labeled who was on it.
