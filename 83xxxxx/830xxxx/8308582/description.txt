6)  The Weapons of World War 2 
Episode six begins with the development of the Thompson .45 caliber submachine gun and its wide usage in prohibition and depression era America in the lead-up to World War II. The evolution of the BAR into a fully automatic-only weapon, the development of the M1919, and the introduction of the venerable .50 caliber M2 or "ma deuce" machine gun, which even served as a sniper rifle in Vietnam by Carlos Hatchcock, are examined. The development and wartime usage of the classic M1 Garand, the first semi-automatic rifle to serve as standard issue for any army in the world, swallows much of this episode's runtime.
