Ray Edward 'Eddie' Cochran (October 3, 1938) was an American rock and roll pioneer, who in his brief career, had a lasting influence on rock music. Cochran's rockabilly songs, such as "C'mon Everybody", "Somethin' Else", and "Summertime Blues", captured teenage frustration and desire in the late 1950s and early 1960s.He experimented with multitrack recording and overdubbing even on his earliest singles,and was also able to play piano, bass and drums.

...On Saturday, April 16, 1960, at about 11.50 p.m., while on tour in the United Kingdom, 21-year-old Eddie Cochran died as a result of a traffic accident.
