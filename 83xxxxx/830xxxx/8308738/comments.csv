,CommonsCarnival,2013-03-28T10:54Z,"Hi. First the installation will NOT place a shortcut icon on your desktop so you'll have to create one manually.  Installation will place a folder ""Pressure"" in your Program Files folder but you will need to place the two crack files in the ""bin"" subfolder, which is where you will also find the 'Pressure' application to launch the program. The game is a silly 'kids' game but fun for quick diversion races when you have a couple minutes to spare; nothing too immersible or time-consuming. Basic racing game where you upgrade your primary and secondary weapons, bumper ram, your car, etc."
