Built from 12.04.2 Ubuntu mini .iso, No Unity, No Gnome3, only the Gnome2 fork MATE. A full-featured desktop experience that also is perfect on older spec machines and netbooks. Sockpuppet is lightweight idling at 150mb RAM without compiz/emerald enabled. For those who miss the "glory days" of GNOME2 this distro is for you. SEED. SHARE. Enjoy!
