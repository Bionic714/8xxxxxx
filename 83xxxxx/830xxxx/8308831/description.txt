Came foe the SCARLET&gt;FIRE, ended up staying for the whole show.

First, a word on this Scarlet &gt; Fire...I don't know where this one was hiding, but it's time it stepped 
out into the light. The Scarlet is good, the transition jam is funky and interesting, but it's the FIRE 
that really grabs you. Brent is just all over the first third, rippling and punching and filling with 
all kinds of calypso-themed riffs, just infusing this version with island rhythms....then Jerry breaks 
into the fore after the 2nd verse and rages this sucker right into a picture-perfect return coda. It's 
gold, and falls into my top 3 FIREs of all time.

Overall, this show has a very groovy feel...it's less speeded-out than a lot of its early-80's bretheren 
(e.g. check out the behind-the-backbeat groove on "Women R Smarter")...Brent and Bobby goof around with 
the cadence and tempo and it's clear they're having a blast.

Also, Garcia's vocals in this show, while '84 raw to be sure, actually hold together, and the effect is 
more Tom Waits-ish than the sad frog-in-a-blender pinchiness that accompanies most every post-'83 
performance. he shines especially on the aforementioned FIRE and ALABAMA and again on an inspired HE'S GONE.

The SPACE is "Allah"-tinged which makes it more interesting than most and they finish up w/a fine 
T-STONES/NFA combo.
