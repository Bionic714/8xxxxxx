Game Notes

Takamine Yuuto is a regular guy with a heavy responsibility. After losing
his parents, instead of relying on relatives he decides to live
independently and provide for his stepsister Kaori. Their life together is
hard, but pleasant; passed in friendly quarrels with his rival Shun, and
accompanied by their childhood friend Kyouko.

But the wheel of fate moves as it wills. In an astonishing turn of events,
Yuuto and his sister are summoned to another dimension: the land of
Phantasmagoria. Kaori is held captive, and without the ability to
understand or communicate in this new world, Yuuto is compelled to become
an Etranger - a warrior of power - and take up the sword, becoming a force
in the conflict raging in this alien world.

To protect Kaori, the unwilling Yuuto throws himself into the fray. But as
he fights alongside the fighters known as Spirits, living among the people
of Phantasmagoria, he slowly comes to discover other reasons for his
ongoing struggle...
