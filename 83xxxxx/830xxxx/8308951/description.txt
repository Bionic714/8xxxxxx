Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site :: On this Wednesday, March 27 edition of The Alex Jones Show, Alex looks at the response to Jim Carrey's attack on the Second Amendment and covers growing assaults on the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. 

He also talks about increasing violence in the Middle East as fanatical Muslims jail, torture, and kill Christians in Egypt, Libya, and Syria under the order out of chaos banner of the so-called "Arab Spring." 

Alex welcomes back Professor Griff to the show. Griff is a member of the hip hop group Public Enemy and head of the Security of the First World. He will talk about the 21 goals of the Illuminati and aspects of the the Secret Covenant.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
