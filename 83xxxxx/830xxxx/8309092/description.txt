Delete Duplicates for Outlook

Delete Duplicates for Outlook enables you to delete duplicate e-mail messages from your Outlook mailboxes. It is a add-in, i.e. an auxiliary program that interfaces with Outlook, can operate in and on the Outlook environment, and provides functions that Outlook itself does not provide. Why the need for this program, since if you see duplicates you could delete them yourself? The answer is that many people now conduct much of their professional and personal communication -- indeed much of their professional and personal lives via e-mail, and some people use Outlook as their filing system for correspondence. This leads to a situation in which people have hundreds or thousands of Outlook mailboxes on their computer,containing thousands or tens of thousands of messages, and this can make it difficult or impossible to even spot duplicate messages, especially if they reside in different mailboxes.
