This is not to be confused with the album Rock Love which has the song The Gangster is Back on it.

This is two separate live concerts Steve Miller Band did in 1972 and 73 compiled into an album.
I believe these tracks in my opinion, to be some of the best work Steve miller has ever done, and once I listed to these versions I could never listen to the studio versions again.  I noticed they are kind of hard to find also, so if you are a Steve Miller / Steve Miller Band fan and want to listen to him live this is for you, if you didn't know it existed you should download it, it's great.

To repeat this again: THIS IS A LIVE COMPILITION. It is not an album, earliest known compilation I can find is  DaveSwift on bootlegzone, so if you would like to thank someone for finding the tracks thank him, I just made a torrent because I noticed no one really had.
