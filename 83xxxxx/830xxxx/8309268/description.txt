The long wait is finally over - PAYDAY: The Game Soundtrack is available for purchase! Immerse yourself in the world of PAYDAY by listening to the adrenaline pumping tunes of our favorite career criminals Dallas, Hoxton, Chains and Wolf.

WeΓÇÖve held back on nothing in this release ΓÇô itΓÇÖs total OVERKILL! This is without a doubt the definitive PAYDAY soundtrack digital download and it includes the following:

All 17 tracks in high quality MP3 format
All 17 tracks without sound effects in MP3

On top of that, there are sound effect free versions of all tracks for those who enjoy the music more that way (or if you want to use the music in your YouTube PAYDAY gameplay video)!

And finally: You get remix material (separate bass lines, guitar riffs, synth leads and effects) for several of the tracks! If this isnΓÇÖt an ambitious release then we donΓÇÖt know what is! Still, the download doesnΓÇÖt cost more than HALF what a regular album costs (without these bells and whistles) on your digital music distribution service of choice.

I have removed the WAV files and remix sounds, as they can be quite large and generally unused. If I get enough requests, I will add them to a separate torrent.
