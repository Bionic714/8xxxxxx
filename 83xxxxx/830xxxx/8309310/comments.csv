,daniellie,2013-03-29T12:19Z,The returning activation code field in the crack program is too short and it doesn't allow to access/copy the full (and necessary) last 9 digits to register the program. 
,xarantrim,2013-03-29T15:29Z,this works or not??
,craneguy,2013-03-29T17:40Z,"@Danielle

There are always digits missing. It's no problem.

Copy Activation code and then hit CTRL-V to paste into ACAD"
,daniellie,2013-03-29T22:54Z,CTRL+C or +V don't work either. It's impossible to see/copy the last numbers. Thank you for the efforts tho... the developers should have created a bigger GUI.
,daniellie,2013-03-29T22:55Z,The 30 days trial works. Your guys might come with a solution to register it until it expires!
,fish0101,2013-03-30T00:00Z,Does not work on 64-bit system. The crack is for 32-bit version
,shottymarq,2013-03-30T21:34Z,"It works, just remember to patch first"
,eng.22mmm,2013-04-01T23:52Z,"while set up , it appear this message >>>>
please insert the disc: AutoCad 2014 Disc 1
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,ahadyusuf,2013-04-05T15:00Z,just extract it and than try to install
,hewhoeatspie,2013-04-13T01:34Z,"So I figured out why the crack wasn't working guys. 
What you have to do:
1. Open crack in administrator.
2. copy the request into keygen and press generate
3. copy the generated code. 
4. click patch button in the crack
5. paste the generated code into the activation ( yes I know it's too short)
6. Then click next, and it should work.

Hopes this helps everyone, took me a while to figure it out."
,apex2000,2013-04-13T03:24Z,Works perfectly if you follow the instructions in the Crack folder. Thanks very much.
,madness56,2013-04-13T09:13Z,wtf have tried everything in every order and the activation page won't take any codes
,madness56,2013-04-13T09:22Z,i'm tending to agree with danielle tha the generator field is not giving up all the numbers i was 10 numbers short it left one of the boxes with only 2 digits

,RogerNGH,2013-04-20T15:22Z,"Sorry, it does work, just not on my PC, works fine on my laptop :) Both 64bit."
,hewhoeatspie,2013-04-23T03:28Z,"Everyone who is saying that it doesn't work because the crack doesn't give you a long enough code is an idiot. The code doesn't have to be long enough, just make sure you click patch on the crack before you hit next to activate.

And it works 100% fine on 32 and 64 bit systems."
,langhi,2013-04-25T18:01Z,I was having the same issue of not being able to patch and the generated code being to short like most have stated.  Move the patch file to the installed directory ((I.E. C:Program FilesAutodesk3ds Max 2013)) Then start that file by right clicking and RUN AS Administrator and it should work.
,acoiawimi,2013-04-25T19:16Z,"langhi's solution saved me!! Nothing else worked, I kept getting error messages asking me if I was admin (I only have one account on my laptop, so of course I'm admin), but copying the crack to the installed directory and then running it as admin worked!! "
,maggabyte,2013-04-29T17:25Z,"This popped up on middle on install: ""please insert the disc: AutoCad 2014 Disc 1"" and i haven't seen anyone address a solution to this issue yet, is it only me?"
,codlink,2013-05-04T23:28Z,"If you're getting the message ""please insert the disc: AutoCad 2014 Disc 1"" You need to extract the ISO and install from there.

My setup:
UltraISO x64
Win7 x64"
,codlink,2013-05-04T23:39Z,"If you are getting an error after inserting the generated key code, double check the request box.  It may have the phrase ""Paste Request here"" still in it.  Delete that phrase and hit generate again.  The new code will work even though it's too short."
,_Beee,2013-05-05T12:15Z,Works perfect on windows 8 x64. Thank you for the upload and thank you for the comment langhi!
,Belaar,2013-05-05T22:24Z,"I got it to work by moving the keygen/patcher to the installation folder as suggested. But I'd like to add that by ""installtion folder"" it means the Autodesk folder, and NOT (as I first thought) the AutodeskAutoCAD 2014 folder."
,okmedic07,2013-05-10T15:19Z,"Help Please.  I have tried multiple torrents so it is clearly something on my end that I can't figure out.  I mount the iso and start the install.  Sometimes I get to just the disclaimer and other times I get to the point of putting in the serial numbers.  Either way it gives me the same errors

I get this popup after exiting the registration window on autocad 2014.

The problem may be caused by a missing .hdi file in the following location:

,Shapkee,2013-05-18T22:52Z,You need to turn off user acount control and run patch as admin. And it will work...;)
