I tried to use my Internet Explorer 9 (64-bit) browser and it would crash... had to use Task Manager to close it. I removed roboform-x64.dll and now the browser works but not the roboform toolbar. I found this by right clicking on icon selecting options and clicking on version - C:Program Files (x86)Siber SystemsAI RoboFormroboform.dll - Bad signature, corrupted file
Is there a way you can help me? There are no comments to look through to see if anyone else is having the same problem, although most people use the (32-bit) browser instead of the (64-bit). Thanks in advance."

,SuperSonet,2013-04-11T02:46Z,"Upon further investigation I found that unless you have the ""Enhanced Protective Mode"" option box checked in IE 10, your browser will always be in the 32 bit mode.  Even though you go to Program Files and click on the ""internet explore.exe"" file it will not open the 64 bit browser....it will default to the 32 bit mode with the above mentioned option unchecked.  I confirmed this by checking the above mentioned option that then put me in the 64 bit browser mode and found that roboform would now not work in the 64 bit mode.

So that is the reason I thought that my browser was operating in the 64 bit mode and everything was working fine with RoboForm.    So the 64bit dll still does not work and you will be forced to use the 32 bit browser. "
