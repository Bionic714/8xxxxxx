[V],psspss,2013-03-28T06:51Z,"note for some reason the intro on this was lower bit rate and they used that blur method on the preview

but once the episode starts for real.. its nice and sharp so its no biggy.. so dont get fool by the first few minutes

and for some reason my editor left a few frames of ads in.. didnt cut where I said.. video software always have little bugs dont they!"
