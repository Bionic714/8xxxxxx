[V],velvetfog,2013-03-28T05:10Z,"My seeding bandwidth is limited, so it will take a week or two for me to complete the initial seeding of a torrent this large, but I do seed 24x7, so stick with it.

And when your download completes, please don't cut and run.
I will need help seeding to keep this fine torrent alive. "
