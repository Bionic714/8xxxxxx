.: Plot :.
"Whitney" is about the life of Whitney Cummings, a new comedian who sees that she and Alex (Chris D'Elia) are closing in on the boredom of their relationship. It is the same old story of how if you fall into that category, you are not going to be as happy as you were before. Whitney is not going to let that happen and talks to her friends about the issue at hand. After ending up at the Emergency Room with Alex getting a concussion when they tried something new, they realize that they are alright and that even though a relationship might not be perfect, they still love one another.

Created by Whitney Cummings (Chelsea Lately), "Whitney" is all about how love has many different faces and that it doesn't matter if everything in your life isn't perfect, you still have that special someone to share it with.
