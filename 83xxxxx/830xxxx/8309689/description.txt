After co-founding Robinella and the CCstringband with his wife, he spent nearly a decade traveling the road and making music from coast to coast. When his marriage ΓÇô and the band ΓÇô dissolved in 2007, he returned to the road ΓÇª this time, as the driver of a truck for a stone company. It was here, over a year spent rolling down the highways of East Tennessee, that the songs and sounds that would form the nexus of The Black Lillies were conceived. 

And ΓÇ£Runaway Freeway Blues,ΓÇ¥ the bandΓÇÖs third studio album, was realized exactly there ΓÇª on the road. When the Lillies werenΓÇÖt playing their 200-odd gigs during 2012, they were in Wild Chorus Studio in their hometown of Knoxville, Tenn., working with Scott Minor of Sparklehorse to craft a beautiful ode to restless spirits and rambling hearts. Rooted in the mud-rutted switchbacks of Appalachia, ΓÇ£Runaway Freeway BluesΓÇ¥ is the sound of a band thatΓÇÖs becoming something of a phenomenon across the country.
