Bern-Belp for FSX by flylogic. This is version 1.00 with installer and serial. Tested and working fine. It will install to your addon scenery folder and the aeslite tool can be found there. It defaults to direct x 10 preview mode so make sure you switch this via the aeslite tool, unless of course you use dx10 mode. Found and sharing here.
