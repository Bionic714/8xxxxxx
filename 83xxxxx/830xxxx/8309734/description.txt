This is a LEGAL operating system, folks! It is Ultimate Edition 3.5 for x64 computers, and it is Ubuntu Linux, with a KICK!!! It includes all the goodies and programs, already installed and set up for Linux, so you won't have to figure out where they are or how to resolve dependencies. The original files are at http://www.ultimateedition.info if you don't trust torrents....
