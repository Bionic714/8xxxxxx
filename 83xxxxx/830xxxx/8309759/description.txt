ItΓÇÖs taken seven studio albums and a trip to Nashville, but Luke Doucet has finally crossed over completely into classic rock territory. That's not a value judgement, mind you. There have been traces of classicism throughout Doucet's career, mostly stemming from his belief that musicianship isn't a four-letter word, and that desire to align with Can-rockΓÇÖs past has always been a part of his appeal. It's just never been as prominent as it is on Steel City Trawler.

The most obvious example is a cover of Gordon Lightfoot's ΓÇ£SundownΓÇ¥ that might best the original, but it doesn't end there. ΓÇ£Dirty, Dirty BlondeΓÇ¥ has a cocky strut that wouldn't sound too out of place sandwiched between ΓÇ£Brown SugarΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£La GrangeΓÇ¥ on classic rock radio. ΓÇ£You Gotta Get ItΓÇ¥ falls somewhere closer to ΓÇ£Down By the River,ΓÇ¥ only poppier. They work, though, partly because Doucet puts a concerted effort into perfecting his melodies and partly because his eye for seemingly mundane details remains intact ΓÇö listen to the heartbreaking ΓÇ£The Ballad of Ian CurtisΓÇ¥ for proof. But whether he's wallowing in finger-picked balladry or stomping through a solo-heavy rocker, it never feels put on ΓÇö and thatΓÇÖs why this works. Steel City may sound like it's trawling through your dad's record collection, but that just means it feels like home.
