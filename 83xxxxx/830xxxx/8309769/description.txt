"The Cedar finally gets to invite in from the cold Canadian singer-songwriter great Ron Sexsmith for an intimate show in support of his brand new album Long Player Late Bloomer (out Mar 1, 2011, Warner). Hinting at a somewhat different direction for Sexsmith, the new album was produced by Metallica producer Bob Rock.

Nashville singer-songwriter Caitlin Rose opens, described by The Independent as 'nothing less than the freshfaced, outlaw-minded future of country music.'"
