His 720p is more like 400p and his 1080p is more like 700p. And the audio is crap. Especially if you're watching this on a TV, download a bigger file."
,ix9nine009,2013-03-30T05:05Z,"yes it has low bitrates
but this kind of file is great when you only have
a 2.1 speaker or lowend 5.1 system and a 32"" TV or lower

if you have a high-end HT setups you should download unripped blu-ray files.

yes you have a High-end HT system but you download a low bitrate file then whines because the quality is rubbish? or even give a bad reputation to the uploader? haha are you guys idiots?

maybe this whinners are other movie uploaders to yet YIFY become a threat to them. :D"
,bokbok520,2013-03-30T05:08Z,"@bluejay21, are you jealous 'cause many leechers like YIFY's videos? If you don't like it don't download it. And Fuck off!!! LOL"
,thereisnoother,2013-03-31T09:28Z,"bluejay21 why don't you upload something better then? Oh that's right, you're just a whiner. YIFY is arguably the best uploader on TPB. His(or her) file sizes are small to make the experience more efficient. I do have a 58"" Panasonic plasma, Dennon Receiver, 7.1 Klipsch surround, and YIFY's files actually play crystal clear. The sound is not DTS but my system can simulate it, and it still sounds great. The levels are a little low, but that's what the volume control is for. There are many factors as to why people may prefer smaller file sizes, and YIFY comes through with quality every time to meet that demand. If you want higher bitrate and DTS go with BOZX, but the video quality is not that much better. Or if you must have the absolute best quality, buy the disk!"
