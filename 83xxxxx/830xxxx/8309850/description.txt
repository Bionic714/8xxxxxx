"Reggie Watts, the final performer on the PopTech 2011 stage, sends the audience off in 

style with his characteristic blend of wry improvisational humor and unpredictable 

musical riffs. Using only his microphone and a looping machine, Watts creates a 

brilliant pastiche of the conference and brings the conference attendees to their feet 

to dance."
