"The Wow Factor"

Claire and Cam are entrenched in the house
flip, but when they hit an impasse on a big
landscaping decision, a "neutral" third party
is brought in - Pam (guest star Wendi
McLendon-Covey), the lesbian mom from Lily's
school. Meanwhile, Phil decides to teach the
kids basic fix-it skills around the house;
Gloria spends some quality one-on-one time
with Manny, leaving Jay alone with baby Joe;
and Mitch helps Lily deal with a schoolyard
bully
