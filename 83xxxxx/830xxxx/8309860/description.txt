"The Name"

Frankie's sister, Janet (Molly Shannon)
comes to the rescue and offers to help run
the Heck household while Frankie studies
for her dental assisting school finals
But the sheer amount of disorganization in
the house throws perfectionist Janet for a
loop. Meanwhile, when Cassidy's
ex-boyfriend pays an unexpected visit from
college, Axl tries to take the high road
and not act like a jealous boyfriend; and
Sue wants to legally change her middle
name -- which is also Sue -- in order to
have a normal name on her driver's
license
