"Freaks and Geeks"

Sam and Dean investigate some recent vampire
kills and are surprised to learn Krissy
Chambers is involved. They find Krissy and
learn her father was killed and she's been
taken in by a man named Victor, who has
taken in a group of orphan kids to teach
them how to hunt. Victor is helping the
teenagers find the vampires who took their
parents so they can get revenge. Sam is
intrigued by Victor's method of giving the
teenagers a home life as well as a hunting
life, but Dean wishes that he would have
gotten the part on Grimm that he tried out
for, and resents Sam for forcing him to do
another season of this garbage
