"When You're Tired of Breaking Other Hearts"

Katie Couric guest stars as herself when Rayna
appears on the "Katie" show, trying to set the
record straight about her marriage and
balancing her career with motherhood. Juliette
attempts to take her album launch into her own
hands but it backfires when she tweets out a
surprise concert location. Maddie lies to
Teddy about her whereabouts -- with dangerous
consequences -- and Deacon is drawn to his
dog's pretty new veterinarian, Stacey.
Meanshile Avery tries to control his musical
destiny by flouting Dominic and Marilyn, and
things are awkward between Scarlett and
Gunnar, as he continues to process his
brother's death.
