Hi,

second torrent here, LHC robin dr400.
As a general aviation aficionado, here the plane, not found on tpb after a research so I decide to share with you.

Simply run the installer, move cab file in gauge folder, and happy flying.

Not tested by me, but should work fine.

Thanks, let me know if works fine.
