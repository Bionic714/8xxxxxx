"Buddhism as Philosophy: An Introduction" by Mark Siderits

KINDLE EDITION (original de-DRM'd MOBI + EPUB conversion)
Publication Date: January 9, 2012

In this clear, concise account, Siderits makes the Buddhist tradition accessible to a Western audience, offering generous selections from the canonical Buddhist texts and providing an engaging, analytical introduction to the basic tenets of Buddhist thought.

"In my own attempts to teach Asian philosophy to American undergraduates, I have often felt the lack of a book like this one. To my knowledge, no other text leads students to question critically the assertions of Buddhist philosophers and to evaluate the arguments for them. Moreover, existing books often include only a few short selections from original Buddhist texts. This volume provides students with the opportunity to wrestle with the richness and complexity of the primary sources. Mark Siderits [is] one of the most important scholars of Buddhism in the world. No living author has done more to make Buddhist ideas intelligible and relevant to contemporary debates in analytic philosophy."
