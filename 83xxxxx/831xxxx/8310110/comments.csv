,Topcat32,2013-05-04T17:49Z,"Thanks for these book downloads I will seed.  Can anyone find Harold Robbins books, there's only one download of three of his books, and one of them is totally garbled.  He is my favorite non-science fiction author.  Thanks to anyone, he wrote 26 or 28 novels, and typically his ebooks are drm free, but being on an extremely limited income, it's a hardship for me to buy them all.  T
