,steppenwolf27,2013-03-30T04:08Z,Do I have to kill a puppy to get an XVID copy of this? Because I will. Just say the word.
,steppenwolf27,2013-03-30T04:11Z,"For every time three x264 encodes (or even two), all exactly the same, but no XVIDs are posted, puppies shall die. They shall be beaten by cruel men, tramped upon underfoot, and crushed by cars.

All because you refuse to post XVIDs."
