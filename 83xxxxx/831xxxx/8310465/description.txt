Essential Logic is an English post-punk band formed in 1978 by saxophonist Lora Logic after leaving X-Ray Spex. The band initially consisted of Lora on vocals, Phil Legg on guitar and vocals, William Bennett (later of Whitehouse) on guitar, Mark Turner on bass guitar, Rich Tea on drums and Dave Wright on saxophone. Turner was later replaced by Jon Oliver on bass. The band split in 1981 and reformed in 2001.

They formed in 1978 with Logic fresh out of art school. Their first 7" was released on their own record label, Cells. They released a self-titled EP on Virgin Records in 1979, before signing to Rough Trade. Their debut studio album, Beat Rhythm News, was released in 1979, followed by several 7"s before the band split in 1980. 

AllMusic called Beat Rhythm News a stunning record that remains a benchmark of the punk era.
