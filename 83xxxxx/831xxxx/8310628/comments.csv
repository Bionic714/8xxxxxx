,maxicans,2013-04-12T11:28Z,"Please seed this. Downloading torrents is free, seeding is the least you can do for the torrent community.

Leeching is just selfish."

Followed all the directions I've been told, but the games don't seem to be located in any of the common spots. Not a huge deal, but I wouldn't mind being able to recover them."
