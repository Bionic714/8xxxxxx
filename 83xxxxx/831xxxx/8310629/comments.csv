[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-28T14:08Z,"lol what a great thing, now i can see felix stabbing himself in the eye (bottom of that page)!!!

this is the first talon i've ever bothered to read -- it's pretty good, and the art's surprisingly excellent.

but can anyone explain why the hell is blood grey in this book?"
,Ahlat,2013-03-28T14:39Z,I think the blood is grey for Talons only becuase of the whole resurrection thing.
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-28T17:47Z,oh ok. thanks for explaining. i'll have to check out the first 5 issues now.
