,lolzob,2013-03-28T13:43Z,"Windows 7 is original, I put separated windows loader for activate Windows. "
,Sipanoooo,2013-03-28T14:09Z,ok friend 100000 thanx but please we need seedres the health is 0 why???
,lolzob,2013-03-28T14:15Z,lamportyx why you stop integration update in Windows?
,lamportyx,2013-03-28T14:19Z,"yeah this is great, all your torrent are great!"
,lamportyx,2013-03-28T14:22Z,"yeah coz some people does'nt know  how to activate they just keep on asking how to get activated, and get rid of that 30 days  trial on windows 7!"
,lolzob,2013-03-28T14:54Z,"Thanks, lamportyx!
But what you say is not a reason to stop integrate updates."
,lamportyx,2013-03-28T23:30Z,"I got this idea from kaiser when he uploaded Windows 7 SP1 All Edition Branded, then I install his Windows 7 and i noticed on the final set up the loader will install automatically. So I explore the Windows 7 ISO file and I have found out that It has a $OEM$ folder and inside this folder has a script file the oobe, DAZ loader and some other branding Wallpaper, It's pretty cool for those who doe'snt know how to activate windows. "
,lolzob,2013-03-29T10:29Z,It's a good idea I to try it 
,kole212,2013-03-29T11:23Z,how can i exactly put oem folder with poweriso to iso image?
,Sipanoooo,2013-03-29T17:55Z,15.7% download speed is 220kb and upload speed is 60kb nice work until now man thanx 
,slackeritguy,2013-03-30T18:23Z,"Hey lolzob!, nice job with this torrent mate, this is what I've been waiting for quite a while now. I don't think it would be a good idea to integrate the loader within the ISO.

People use different activation methods other than DAZ loader, in fact, I have a legit Windows 7 Pro key, I just want a fully updated .ISO, that's why I'm using this. So please, don't integrate the loader, leave it up to the user."
,lolzob,2013-03-31T12:13Z,ok slackeritguy ... I will keep way it is now!
,slackeritguy,2013-03-31T17:17Z,"Thank you very much lolzob.

Btw, will you be releasing a march/april edition for Windows 8?"
,lamportyx,2013-04-01T05:33Z,@Slakeritguy...to have a legit.keys is to  costly  for  us  if  you are  visiting the forum of MDL the you probably understand how daz loader works and you would.probably compare between legit and loader.
,slackeritguy,2013-04-01T17:15Z,"@lamportyx I understand that, why I meant was that slipstreaming DAZ loader as well would not be such a good idea, people all different activation methods, using loaders is just one of them. Leave it up to the user, that's what we want."
,slackeritguy,2013-04-01T17:18Z,"Typo's all over my previous post, 2nd try lol:

@lamportyx I understand that, why I meant was that slipstreaming DAZ loader would not be such a good idea. People use different activation methods, using loaders is just one of them. Leave it up to the user, that's what we want."
,certguy,2013-04-01T19:43Z,"Hi lolzob. Thanks for the great work. I got a question. once i have the windows installed with all the updates and registered, can i use the windows update to update for the future updates? "
,lamportyx,2013-04-02T01:31Z,"you can update as long as you have a proper activation method, it means that not only to have a legit keys or copy of windows, I recommend to use Daz loader 2.2.1 which is attached on this torrent that lolzob upload.. I tested this on it pass windows validity test! but if you can afford to buy a legit keys  better use them it is choise.. but if you want it free and safe use latest version of loader!"
,certguy,2013-04-02T02:38Z,So after activating with the loader i will be able to update the windows is that correct?
,lamportyx,2013-04-02T03:01Z,yeah you can update try it and see for your self!
,certguy,2013-04-02T03:30Z,Thanks lamportyx :)
