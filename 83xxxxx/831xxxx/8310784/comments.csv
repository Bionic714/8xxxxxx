,mindcrasher,2013-04-09T15:08Z,do you have a tut on how to spoof the PS3
,phaseone408,2013-04-14T05:54Z,"@B7U31C3 ReactPSN has nothing to do with connecting to PSN, its for ACTIVATING PSN games and other DLC to work on your system without buying them.  As for playing this online, Yes you need to spoof your system to 4.40 or install the newest Rogero 4.40 CFW.  I've been on PSN with a CFW since 3.55 was the OFW and used EVERY method thats been released and I've never been banned."
,B7U31C3,2013-04-15T11:27Z,"phaseone408...thanks for the info regarding ReactPSN,obviously i was wrong about it. Anyway I have upgraded my PS3 to Rogero 4.40 v1.03 so do you reckon I would be safe playing this game online? Thanks again..."
,phaseone408,2013-04-17T08:08Z,@B7U31C3 I could never say its 100% safe to play on PSN with a CFW as Sony at any moment could find a way to detect a CFW from a OFW.  Like right now if you go play black ops 2 online I guarantee you will be banned from PSN as somehow treyarch could tell if its legit disc or running off the HD.  BUT with that being said Sony has not put in any type of way to find us CFW users Y E T.  As far as this game I've been playing since launch and now I'm almost 1000 Ego.  Put it like this if you don't go online its basically as if you banned yourself already.
,B7U31C3,2013-04-17T17:12Z,"@phaseone408...I downloaded Defiance yesterday and installed it to the internal HDD on my PS3 and it is working like a charm,thankfully. I didnt get any time to play it though but after your last comments I'll definately give it a bash tonight and see what happens. The more I think of what you said in your very last sentance,you are definately right. Thanks again for all your help..."
