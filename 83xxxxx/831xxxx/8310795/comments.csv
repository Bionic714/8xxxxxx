You're very welcome.
You feel you were cheated? You can for a refund at forum. I got the message, so you're a NORMAL Spanish lol, but with no manners.
Those with a little brain know that pre-releases are always US (Eng + Fre + Latin SPA) versions.
I rarely see written anywhere (torrent-descriptions, bluray.com, amazon, etc) that a track is ""Spanish Latin"" or ""Spanish Castilian"". The same goes for subtitles, luckily some sites now have 2 categories for POR (Bra & Eur), but not for Spanish, go to those sites and ask them why they don't make 2 categories for Spanish as well because some folks like you are too ""thick"" to bother with Latin Spanish.
I probably should just stop adding Spanish tracks in the future because I get more blames then thx-s.
I don't need them, I thought you guys needed it.
Enjoy the free movie!"
