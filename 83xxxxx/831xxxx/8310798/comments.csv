,jamesban,2013-03-28T16:33Z,Thanks. Ill give this a try. So far every G5 game I have downloaded wont work. I put the data in the correct location and install the apk but it seems to do an internet check at startup and never registers as full. If this one works well you wouldn't happen to have other G5 games like Kapt. Brawe would you? Thanks.
