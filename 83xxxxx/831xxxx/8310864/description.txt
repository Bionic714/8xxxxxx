Volcanic Rock is the second album for Australian proto-heavy metal band Buffalo, recorded and originally released in 1973 on the Vertigo label. The album was stylistically a much harder, heavier and rawer release than its predecessor (Dead Forever...) ΓÇô marking a move away from the band's previous progressive rock influences, although retaining a psych element to their sound. Volcanic Rock had been recorded effectively as a live-in-the-studio effort, with only vocal and additional guitar overdubs added later during the recording sessions.
