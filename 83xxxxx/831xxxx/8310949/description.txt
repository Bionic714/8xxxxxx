Bonnie Guitar - Only The Moon Man Knows - Rare Recordings 1951-1957 (Bear Family CD) (2012)



The rarest-ever recordings from lounge music legend Bonnie Guitar! All the hyper-rare Morrison records as Bonnie Tutmarc from 1951/1952, her Rainier recordings from 1953, plus very rare Fabor and Radio and Dot recordings - 13 recordings originally not issued! By the time she became a national sensation with her Dot Records hit 'Dark Moon', Bonnie Guitar was a veteran of many years, performing and recording for small labels in Los Angeles and her home state of Washington. She'd started early, in clubs and concerts often with a band led by her husband, Paul Tutmarc. She recorded for local companies, and those recordings haven't been heard since then until now. Bonnie eventually joined maverick label owner Fabor Robison as a studio musician and even recording engineer, and then as an artist. Here for the first time are many of Bonnie's earliest recordings before 'Dark Moon'. The elements were all in place: a mellow, inviting voice that lent itself equally well to country and pop material; a selection of material that crossed back and forth over those lines; and the ability to play the instrument from which she took her name. Todd Everett's liner notes include quotes from three recent interviews with the artist. Explore an under-regarded legend! Liner Note Author: Todd Everett.
