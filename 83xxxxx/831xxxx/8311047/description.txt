Storyline:
It's the story of a cartoon character named Roger Rabbit who exists along side of real humans.
Eventually, it is revealed that Marvin Acme, the owner of the Acme Company and of Toontown, has been murdered! But all fingers point to Roger Rabbit, a Toon star at Maroon Cartoons.
But unfortunately the only person who can prove Roger's innocence is Toon hating Eddie Valiant,
a washed-up, alcoholic private detective who is reluctantly forced into helping when Roger hides in his apartment.
It's up to Eddie to clear Roger's name and find the real evildoer before the villainous, power-hungry Judge Doom goes on a mission to bring Roger to justice!
