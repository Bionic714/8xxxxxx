Automated network audit

With AIDA64 hardware and software information of networked computers can be collected via command-line automation.

Collected reports are processed by the AIDA64 Audit Manager, that can also produce network audit statistics and diagrams on hardware and software distribution.

Change tracking and network alerting

AIDA64 real-time alerting facility notifies the network administrator via e-mail when a hardware or software change occurs, when the available disk space gets critical, or when the anti-virus database expires.
