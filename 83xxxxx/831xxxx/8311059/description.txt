Biography:
The Black Angels are a psychedelic rock band from Austin, Texas, formed in 2004. Their name is derived from the Velvet Underground song "The Black Angel's Death Song".

In 2005, the Black Angels were featured on a dual-disc compilation album of psychedelic music called Psychedelica Vol.1 from Northern Star Records. This, along with the growing popularity of their MySpace page, gave the band a big jump in popularity in the underground scene.

On Friday, August 5, 2007, they played at Lollapalooza in Chicago. Among other venues, they have also played at SXSW 2006 & 2008 and All Tomorrow's Parties 2008. Touring partners have included the blues rock band The Black Keys, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, The Warlocks, Roky Erickson, The Brian Jonestown Massacre, Queens of the Stone Age, The Raveonettes, Wolfmother, and The Horrors.

The group's debut LP Passover was generally well received in the underground independent rock community and was noted for its dark tones and lyrical content. Indigo Meadow is their fourth album, to be released on April 2, 2013.
