,rauldf,2013-04-14T16:26Z,Can I use an Xbox controller with this version? Other versions I have downloaded only have keyboard options. I am new to gaming and feel more comfortable using a controller. I also have Win 7 Sp1 64bit. Any trouble installing?
,Prodor12,2013-04-27T03:08Z,"@sifarr

If you're opening it via the launcher, stop. Use BatmanAC.exe instead.

Ran into the same issue as you, seems the launcher doesn't work. So just change options with it if need be, but launch with the other .exe."
,Prodor12,2013-04-27T03:12Z,"And apparently, be sure to run it as admin. Was giving me trouble by asking for online authentication."
,mckeehan86,2013-04-27T11:30Z,"This game just won't start for me. I've installed per instructions, tried running as admin and tried multiple cracks. Like others that haven't received an answer, it will show up in task manager but the disappear. It won't start!"
,indskab,2013-05-03T10:59Z,"That's soo amazing game! I loved it! Batman RULES! you just need""Ultra Iso"" to mount the image""game"" and then Install it and you're good to go! THANK YOU VERY MUCH Gh0stNet!"

,The_Lost,2013-05-17T16:12Z,"It asks for the serial running it as admin as well, help?"
,The_Lost,2013-05-17T16:18Z,"I really want to play this game, but it keeps asking for the serial...I'm using windows 7 64 bits, any clues?"
,Deimos4,2013-05-21T05:58Z,Works almost fine on Windows 8 but it randomly crashes sometimes. 
,jamie8520,2013-05-30T21:41Z,"when installing it, it installs up to 50% then ask for disk 2, i tried all the folders and none worked. which one is ""disk 2""?"
,2.5Kburn,2013-06-05T16:37Z,"@jamie8520:
There are three .iso files included with the torrent.
They are numbered 1-3.
These are discs 1-3.
Mount the first one, start the install.
When it asks for the second, unmount the first image and mount the second.
Do the same for the third disc.
If you need any more explanation than that, you'll have to hope someone with more patience comes along.
These are absolute basics."
