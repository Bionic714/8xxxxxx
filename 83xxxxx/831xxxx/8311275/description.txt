Rasbian old machines emulator remix.

Here we are again with a fantastic new chameleon release v.0.3.1 - easter edition

We have patched a lot of bugs, removed that horrible text-mode rom selector, moved all options menus to graphic mode (except rapsbian ones).

Hope all you like as much as we enjoyed creating it.
