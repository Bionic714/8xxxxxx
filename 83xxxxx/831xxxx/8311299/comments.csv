@dhjudasx:

Okay thanks for sharing. I will downloaded already. Will watch.

All my thanks comments are deleted everywhere in TPB.

Question: Your source it says from physical blu-ray is it yours own disk or u download the requested movies from somebody's torrent 30GB.

A: 10/10
V: 10/10"
[V],dhjudasx,2013-04-05T01:42Z,they are my own physical bluray disc... i don't download ANY sources ever...

@dhjudasx:

Good thanks that u are not using anybody's sources. I Just watched all your 4 Aliens movies judas. The video quality in all 4 aliens movies has a bit burry images. Why won't u make a better in video and audio bits.

Question: Why don't u just stick with 5.1 dd audio and rise up to 384 kb/s bit audio."
[V],dhjudasx,2013-04-08T02:01Z,"source blurays are bluray if you think my encode of them is bluray...

frame for frame they are the same..

dd 384kb dd inferior to 5.1 aac 192kbs...

like comparing mpeg2 to x264.... you could crank mpeg2 to 7500kbps.. and it'll never produce as good a picture as x264 at 2500kbps"
,Han_GooN,2013-04-12T11:31Z,hi dhjudasx.. remember me? the one who have issue with your the dark knight rises rip 5.1 audio... i just finished download this rip and it works!! the 5.1 works.. i dont know why but i think you know the different between this rip and the other one... hope it help.. thank you..
[V],dhjudasx,2013-04-13T08:44Z,"Han_GooN 

I actually do recall and one of the reason I kept trying things with the movie... only after numerous attempts at trying to figure out what the problem might be.. I narrowed it down to mp4 header information being glitched up. Not entirely sure how it happened, but somehow all the metadata is messed in the previous encode.

either way once I confirmed the issue and now I know what to look for, I did a re-encode of the movie and threw it up.

Got the old one deleted entirely and hoping people are enjoying the new one.

I should be able to track down any other movies that this happens to in the future.

Glad it's working for you ;)"
,Han_GooN,2013-04-22T08:49Z,"sorry for late reply... i have a problem with my harddisk, so i got busy recover all my datas including your rips...

Thank You! Great Quality for a Great Movie!

A:11/10

,msreyes,2013-05-27T19:07Z,"A:10+/ V:10!!!! (Be sure to switch to track 2 in audio. It makes a world of a difference.)

Thank u Judas!!!! I have seen the light. I was content with my Yify torrents but that 5.1 sound really does make a difference. I really wish you had a larger selection but I am grateful for what you do have and for everything else I would rely on Yify for now until they can be replaced. Why isn't everyone downloading your torrents?! You need an ad lol. "
