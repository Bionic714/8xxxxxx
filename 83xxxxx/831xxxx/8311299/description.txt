Compliant with Xbox360/PS3/iPads/Mobile Devices/etc. devices that require the primary Audio stream to be AAC Stereo (many do not accept/work with AAC 5.1 format). Audio Stream 2 available to those that also wish to experience great 5.1 sound that goes right alongside great picture quality.

For those experiencing LOW VOLUME issues, try to playback the 2nd Audio stream in stereo mode, this should improve audio quality and increase the volume substantially.

If you wish to experience 5.1 audio on the original PS3 or Newer PS3, Just select the audio options and ensure the 5.1 stream/track is selected.

PC Users will have to use something like VLC that allows you to choose the 2nd Audio stream/track, Depending on your configuration, vlc should automatically enable 5.1 playback after the track change, but double check by selecting AUDIO ~ Audio Device ~ 5.1

Judas's Note:

YES, this is the IMAX one, there are portions of the film that uses the imax 75mm film and some parts that use the widescreen standard film. So don't flip a table over seeing the movie transition from one to the next, it's no different than what you'd see playing back the bluray.

Judas's Note 2:

If you're wondering "Didn't I download this before?"... you aren't going crazy... yes you have however after trying to determine what or why something weird happened with the original one that would randomly trigger reporting the incorrect information and basically determining that it was a encoding header error of some sort resulting in 5.1 audio mostly failing to actually produce "Reporting 96kbps instead of 192kbps resulting in stereo only OR sometimes reporting 192kbps and producing 5.1.... but weirdness..."

This fixes that problem, it's a smidge larger and this time i uber checked it.

Either way the old torrent will be deleted.
