,SARmedic,2013-03-29T02:42Z,"Sample rating: 
V=8 (has hard coded subs though)
A=8 some hissing, very light

Overall very watchable if you don't mind the hard coded subs."

V/7.5

After a short while, you get to where you don't even notice the Arabic subtitles anymore. 
THANKS AGAIN, scene4all!...GREAT work, as always :)"
