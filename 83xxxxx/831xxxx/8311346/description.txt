School Food Punishment (πé╣πé»πâ╝πâ½ πâòπâ╝πâë πâæπâïπââπé╖πâÑπâíπâ│πâê Suk┼½ru F┼½do Panisshumento) was a four member Japanese band. They were signed onto Sony Music Japan's Epic Records Japan record label prior to their breakup in June 2012. The lyrics of each of the band's songs were written by lead vocalist and guitarist Yumi Uchimura.

~Band history~
The band was formed on October 2004 by Uchimura, while their first live performance took place in December of the same year.[1][2] In 2007, their debut album, school food is good food, was released.[1][2] In 2008, both of their songs, "feedback" and "Futari Umi no Soko" were featured as theme songs to the Japanese television drama Joshidaisei Kaikeishi no Jikenbo, while their mini-album "Riff-rain" was released by Tower Records and sold out in under a week.[3] They also performed in numerous live concerts, including FM802, part of the Minami Wheel 2008 live event, and the J-Wave Live event, part of the Tokyo Real Eyes Live Supernova.

In 2009, they signed onto their first major record label, Sony Music Japan's Epic Records Japan division. Their major label debut is "futuristic imagination", which is the ending theme to the Kenji Kamiyama anime television series Eden of the East, airing on the highly rated noitaminA timeslot on Fuji TV. Amongst their first projects was contributing to Judy and Mary's 15th Anniversary Tribute Album, in which they covered the band's "Brand New Wave Upper Ground" song, with their performance praised by sources such as The Japan Times as having been the highlight of the album and having evoked Judy and Mary's songwriting and musical values.

In 2012, the band announced that it would be going on an indefinite hiatus. The band said the decision came as a result of discussions between the four members.

On June 11, 2012 School Food Punishment announced that they had broken up due to vocalist Yumi Uchimura having left the band.
