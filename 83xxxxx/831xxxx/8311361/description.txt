Nu:Logic is a collaborative partnership between Hospital stalwarts Nu:Tone and Logistics. Individually, the Gresham brothers have released a total of seven long players already on Hospital, each to great critical acclaim. The sum of their combined powers is oozing with the kind of soulful drum + bass, which is the foundation of the Hospital label and will satisfy long term fans who hanker after the golden days of the genre.

Having brought us the Nu:Logic ΓÇ£New TechniqueΓÇ¥ EP in 2010 and the recently released follow up single ΓÇ£Morning Light / GrizzlyΓÇ¥, the duo now bring us their highly anticipated debut album ΓÇ£What IΓÇÖve Always Waited ForΓÇ¥.

Opening with the calm, mellow soothing sounds of ΓÇ£Morning LightΓÇ¥ we are taken through a variety of styles across the 14-track album. Vocal-driven cuts are peppered throughout the album and thereΓÇÖs some top collaborations in there, including ΓÇ£Everlasting Days (ft. Lifford)ΓÇ¥ with its warm, uplifting vibe, the growling spoken swagger of ΓÇ£We Live There (ft. DRS)ΓÇ¥ and the blissed out ΓÇ£Shoot Me Down (ft. Robert Manos)ΓÇ¥.

Elsewhere, donΓÇÖt miss out on the excellent ΓÇ£Start Again (ft. S.P.Y)ΓÇ¥ with the raw, bass heavy menacing tones, as well as the meditative title track ΓÇ£What IΓÇÖve Always Waited ForΓÇ¥ which is all whirring atmospherics and pattering drums. Two interludes ΓÇ£Escape PodΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£DuskΓÇ¥ successfully segment the album into thirds. With so many musical gems to choose from, one thing is for sure - this has been worth waiting for.
