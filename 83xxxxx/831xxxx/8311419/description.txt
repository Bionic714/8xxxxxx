Dig into the sands of time with this exploration into lost civilizations. Scientists, archaeologists, and historians alike search for evidence of cities that may have forever been lost to time. Some are ancient while some are surprisingly recent. Journey back to Jerusalem when Christ walked through its streets. Explore the mysteries of the Knights Templar. See Egypt when Ramses ruled and discover what it looked like in Braveheart's Scotland. Recent cities include Winston Churchill's secret bunkers and a Welthauptstadt Germania that Hitler envisioned. Graphic recreations and location shots bring these cities to life.

11)  Secret Cities of the a Bomb 
This might be the story of history's biggest secret. A hidden world of secret cities and classified nuclear facilities built inside America. 400,000 people were part of it, though only a handful really knew the truth. It took up half a million acres of land, it saw the construction of the largest building in the world, it cost billions of dollars and all these resources were focused on one goal: Brining an end to World War II by building the world's first atomic bomb. Six decades on a team of experts return to the once classified sites where the course of history was decided. In green valleys and dry deserts they will uncover and rebuilt this lost world. Using the latest in computer technology and new evidence, the team will uncover the most complex feat of engineering ever taken. This is the Lost World of the Manhattan Project.
