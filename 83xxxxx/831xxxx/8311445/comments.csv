years and years ago the owner of my town's LCS would give me his copies of IC -- back then it was published by (now-defunct) capital city distribution, i think. it was a great read, especially compared to wizard magazine, because it taught me about sales trends and advertising co-ops... basically the business side of our hobby.

well, if you ever see any copies floating around, i'd be grateful if you could share them. i would buy a copy, but i can't justify paying $10 for one!"
