This is the first episode of Fairy Tail in pure 1080p (No Image Quality Compression), so this is about as good a quality as you can get it. It is ripped from the BlueRay DVD.

Initial release and all credit should go to Kousei Fansubs, all I did was add the English Audio track to the file and sync it in time using audacity which was a bit of a pain.

The subs are hard codded so cannot be turned off.

The download will initially take a while due to only me seeding, so please seed when complete.
