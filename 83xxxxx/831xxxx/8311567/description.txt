"Perhaps one of the most unique and beautiful voices in the Twin Cities makes any project of Holly Newsom something worth listening to. If her successful local grunge band Zoo Animal is the epitome of artistic focus then consider Holly's solo material an unfiltered portrait of an artist: intimate and uninhibited."
