Who would've predicted what a smash hit this title has become for IDW? Last month, MLP:FIM #3 was a top-50 comic and sold over 43 thousand copies -- more than Flash, Teen Titans, Wonder Woman, or Hawkeye. For comparison, IDW's next best-selling property is G.I. Joe at about 18 thousand and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles at about 16 thousand!  --STFmaryville
