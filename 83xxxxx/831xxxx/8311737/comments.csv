I'm trying to find the France VFR add-on that supposed to work with the LLH Sceneries Courchavel.  Is it Pyrenees, Alps sud or nord, Meditranne.  Is it a VFR regional I need or is it one of their photo sectionals or both?  Thanks for any help on this."

,pierrot78,2013-03-28T23:07Z,"@potvinsuks : you'll need ""rhone-alpes photo hd "" vol#1 and vol#2, giving you a 4.75m mesh and photo coverage of the whole french alps. Textures are summer only, but the set looks really great."
,potvinsuks,2013-03-29T04:10Z,"Thank you pierrot78 and darth for the info.  You would be amazed how difficult it has been to find the answer lol.  Too bad there's were no winter textures, because Courchavel is nice then."
