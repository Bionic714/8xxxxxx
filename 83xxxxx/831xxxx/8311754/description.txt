Release Info:
Sly Cooper Thieves in Time continues from where Sly 3: Honor Among Thieves

of alleged amnesia and dances off with gal pal Carmelita, leaving Bentley
as the keeper of the treasured Thievius Raccoonus, The Cooper family's
ancient book of master thievery. When Bentley discovers that pages of the
book have begun to disappear in front of his eyes, he must round up the
gang and save the Cooper Clan legacy from being destroyed forever.
