[T],dadrkhomr,2013-03-30T04:52Z,"Age of Ultron was not a Marvel NOW title, but it is in my total Marvel pack"
,ziewolf,2013-03-31T00:05Z,"yeah thanks and all, but why do you just get NOW! titles? why not have the complete collection of releases? you must know that marvel releases more than just ""NOW"" i.e. ultimates, age of ult, gambit, etc. there's more! the DC ppl got their shit down, DC NEW 52 Week XX. i know there's a total marvel week guy who gets it all, but why don't you?"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-31T06:19Z,"dadrkhomr, the only way age of ultron isn't a marvel now title is that it doesn't have the logo on the cover.

it crosses over with Fantastic Four, Superior Spider-Man, Avengers Assemble, Wolverine and the X-Men, Uncanny Avengers and Fearless Defenders.

you have 2 age of ultron crossover issues in this marvel now week 19 torrent!

they are your torrents, do it however you want, but leaving the core series out makes no sense."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-31T06:20Z,"ziewolf, quit complaining and download the individual torrents if you're missing anything. and this is the same guy who does total marvel week!"
