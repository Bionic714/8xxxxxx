When Kane (John Hurt) and the crew of the spaceship 'Nostromo' investigate a transmission from a deserted planet, he is attacked by an unknown organism which attaches itself to his face. The crew cut the creature off, but not before it has made Kane the host of a monstrous alien killer, one which will hatch out through his stomach (one of cinema's most memorably gory scenes) and proceed to hunt down the crew one by one.
