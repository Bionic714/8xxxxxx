Code: 
http://www.imdb.co.uk/title/tt0231402/
Mick Dundee travels to the city of smog
and stars with his young son in tow.
From the opening shot of a Jurassic Park-esque reptilian eye,
you know you're in for a wild ride. As Mick "Crocodile" Dundee
sits in a canoe sharpening his famous knife, a monstrous croc
hides somewhere in the deep. Suddenly, it attacks, tearing
Mick's boat to pieces and leaving him and mate Jacko up a
tree. Life for Mick can only get easier, right? When Mick
arrives at home, he discovers longtime companion Sue's
newspaper-mogul father has called, and needs her help on an
article at the paper's Los Angeles branch. Mick, who recognizes
his importance in the modernizing bush is now no more than as a
tourist attraction, agrees to join her, and together Mick, Sue,
and son Mikey head for the wild country of L.A. Here the
adventure truly begins, as Mick and Jacko brave a cowboy bar
where the horsemen are of a different color, and a Hollywood
film party where everyone seems interested in Mick's mate
Malcolm "Mal" Gibson's colorful exploits. Soon, Sue's article
leads to a sleazy film producer...
