Dungeon Defenders 7.48b (Jimbus edition)
-----------------------


This is a unique game which combines three genres (tower defense, RPG and action) and adds the possibility to play it cooperatively. The result is a very addictive and funny game.


This edition contains the full game (nothing has been deleted) playable in one computer or via internet (using GameSpy) and patched to 7.48b version.


In this edition everything works, including:
                ----------------

- The "Quest for the Lost Eternia Shards" part 1 to 4.
- The new 4 heroes: "barbarian", "EV series", "summoner" and "the Jester".
- All the challenges, campaigns and DLCs.


Remember, at config menu, to change the online platform from "Steam" to "GameSpy".


Notice this is not an update but the full game. Do not install it over an existing installation. Besides, this release does NOT include the "Development kit".


Your progress, characters, weapons, etc., are in the file "Binaries/Win32/DunDefHeroes.dun". This is the only one you must take care of.


If you are having issues to save your progress, always launch the game with administrator privileges.
