A Group of teenagers test the legend of an
immortal witch and get more than they
bargained for.
"Season of the Equinox, the witch besets her kill.
One less soul in the town to know, taken against
their will." It is a bedtime story nearly every
kid in the small town of Summerset has heard.
A silly story passed down from generation to
generation that offers just enough chills to keep
the legend alive. This year is different. Seven
year old Amanda Drake is swiped from her bedroom
window. Rumors swirl. The Witch has returned.
Always up for a good fright, and a chance to impress
the girls, 18 year old Zach and his friends decide
to sneak into the woods and find the mysterious old
house where the legendary Witch supposedly lives.
Unbeknownst to Zach, his younger brother Max and
Max's "girlfriend" Sammy sneak along. They all soon
discover that folklore isn't always myth and that
bedtime stories sometimes come true. The Witch has
indeed returned, intent on casting her magical spells
to deceive, hunt and ultimately consume the local
children - little ones to keep her young, older ones to...
