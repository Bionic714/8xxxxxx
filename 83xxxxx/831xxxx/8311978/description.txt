LEGO: Legends of Chima - Season 1 - Episode 3 (WEB-DL - XviD)
-------------------------------------------------------------

The world of CHIMA is a magical land ruled by tribes of highly-advanced animals.
These creatures walk and talk like humans. They drive vehicles, use machinery, and
live in amazing castles and forts. But make no mistake about it: these are animals,
with claws, fangs, tails, and sometimes wings. And now they are engaged in a full
scale conflict. Once a pristine, natural paradise, the land of CHIMA has become a
battle ground for the animal tribes. Best friends are now worst enemies. Weaponry
pummels the once-sacred temples. Animalistic vehicles charge furiously at each other
in jungle jousts. The animals fight for control of a natural resource called CHI, a
power that is both a source of life and holds the potential for destruction. Only a
few brave heroes in CHIMA understand the true nature of CHI and its importance.
Their stories, and the stories of those who seek to conquer the CHI, are known as...
THE LEGENDS OF CHIMA.
