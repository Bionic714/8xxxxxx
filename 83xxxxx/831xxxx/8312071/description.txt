Opus is a new Audio Codec already playable in VLC (Standard), Rockbox, Foobar (Standard) and WMP just to name a few 
Update players if need to, WMP use Klite Codec Pack Update 
Opus is another lossy codec designed more with use of Voice/Internet Streaming/Skype at very low bitrates in mind. 
Although Opus goes up to 512Kbps it's Sound at 128Kbps has a range of 20.5Khz which is the same as a MP3 320! 

So i've set the standard at 144Kbps.. Have a listen!.
