Mike Tramp, former Mastermind of 80s rockers White Lion and Freak of Nature, is currently on the road in support of his new, all acoustic album "Cobblestone Street" which is gonna be released next month. 

Mike played songs spanning his entire career from the first song White Lion ever did (Broken Heart) through many of White Lions favourites, Freak of Nature tunes and also a few songs from his new album. This was a very intense experience since Mike talks a lot between songs about how they were written, offers many personal insights into his life back then and now, band stories and how music business changed over the years, many memories from tours with AC/DC and others, rants...not the typical rock show but very entertaining nevertheless. 

Mike is touring Europe at the moment and will come over to the US in july doing shows all over the continent. 
Check out the dates on his website (miketramp.dk/shows) and I highly advise you to go out and see him. 
He┬┤s very cooperative when it comes to taping. You can set up whatever you want (Audio/Video) even agrees to sbd patches. Go check him out and support him. He┬┤s currently on the road with nothing but his guitar, a couple of strings, a box of pedals and gear, CDs and T-Shirts and a suitcase in a rental car. He even sells the merch himselfm happy to sign each and every item you bring or buy and posing for photos. 

This is the audio version of my 6 cam video/audio project I did that night. Will offer the video whenever it┬┤s done, for now this is the aud/sbd mix. The sbd is taken directly out of the board (mono) and mixed with the Neumann KM 140s I had on a stand FOB that night. 

Enjoy!
