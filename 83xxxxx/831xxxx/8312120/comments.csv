,talbot10,2013-03-28T23:17Z,Thanks! Do you have this uncompressed?
,SteelerJ17,2013-03-28T23:23Z,@ talbot10. It's already set up for burn. Just use Nero or IMGBurn. 
,talbot10,2013-03-29T07:04Z,"I'm sorry SteelerJ17, what I meant was DVD9 which is usually about 6, 7, or 8 gigabytes. Thanks anyway!"
,MrShite,2013-03-30T13:53Z,"talbot10 is right, it would be better if people uploaded their DVDs uncompressed. Meaning, as DVD9. No sense in lowering the quality."
