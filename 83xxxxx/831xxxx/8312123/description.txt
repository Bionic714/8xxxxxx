Victor Hugo - Les Miserables (translated by Lee Fahnestock and Norman MacAfee)(Signet, 1987). 1463 pages.

New scan. Searchable pdf (clearscan) with chapter links in bookmarks, accurate pagination and metadata, etc.

This version of Les Miserables is not the same as any of the others on tpb or elsewhere on the web. It's a completely new scan of the (American) Signet paperback edition, which calls itself "the only complete and unabridged paperback edition." It's regarded by many as the best available edition in English. However the publisher hasn't made it available in digital form (as far as I know) ... so I decided to do so.

Since this is such a large book, it's more than likely I've made some errors in the scan. If you find any significant mistakes -- missing or reversed pages, distorted or missing text, repeated pages, etc. -- please leave a comment and I'll make any necessary repairs and reup the book.

Like most of my scans, my goal is to produce a book that can be read easily on any device with good pdf support. I've successfully tested this one on Android tablets with screen sizes from 4 inches to 10 inches using the ebookdroid pdf app. I suspect it will also be easy to read on iPad and iPhone. I hope you have similar success on your device.
