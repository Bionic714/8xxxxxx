,nexus856,2013-04-24T00:11Z,I downloaded 5 different versions of your powerdirector and every time i try to instal it gives me CRC eror on data1.cab. Why is it corrupted for me but for everyone else is not?
,JarjarTwink,2013-04-25T18:49Z,"Doesn't work. crashes at start. 

All your other PD torrents worked for me, not this one. it says ""stack hash"" something was the fault for the crash "
,JarjarTwink,2013-04-25T23:59Z,"OK, i googled a bit, Uninstalled all my Graphic card and chipset drivers, and vollah, it works, 

no crash, so i don't think it's ching liu's fault that the software itself is caput.

,JarjarTwink,2013-04-26T02:29Z,"OK last post, i downloaded the Trial version today from cyberlink and it works perfectly no problem. 

so wtf ? "
,JarjarTwink,2013-04-26T13:48Z,"SOLVED: do this, maybe it will work for you.

1.Update your GPU drivers. 

2.Download Latest Cyberlink powerdirector ultra trial, install, skip registration balblah, use it for 1 minute. close, uninstall EVERYTHING. 

3. download this torrent, install the first setup file, start power director, skip registration if it comes up etc, then update with the update file included, 

4. download latest update from cyberlink version  2812 and install it. 

volla, it worked for me after that. no crash, no nottin. "
