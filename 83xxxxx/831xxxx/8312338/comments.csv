,jalucian,2013-04-08T00:05Z,"This is actually not ""The First Cut."" This is ""The Final Cut."" Movie-censorship.com even got this wrong. The Final Cut is the theatrical version plus ""the lost"" animated scene which isn't present in the theatrical version. ""The First Cut"" is longer, even more rough cut that was included in the 10th Anniversary Edition. It has a run time of 1:44:34, the theatrical version is 1:31:47 and The Final Cut is this one, which is 1:39:30. Another dead give-away is the fact that ""The First Cut"" is shot in 4:3 aspect ratio and not 16:9."
,jalucian,2013-04-10T19:43Z,"No, movie-censorship didn't get it wrong - only the uploader got it wrong. Movie-censhorship does list the correct ""The First Cut"" there, but that is *not* what is encoded here. My previous comment is still correct except for the part about movie-censorship getting it wrong. I was giving the uploader the benefit of the doubt that he was using their incorrect information, but it looks like he didn't even bother closely reading the very link he posted. If he had, he would have seen that what he uploaded was not ""The First Cut"" at all."

[V],GoodFilms,2013-04-25T23:25Z,"I checked, and this is indeed ""The First Cut"", as advertised."
