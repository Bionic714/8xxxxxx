One note: Hotfix from 27 march not included. It's 26 march release. If it will be viable somewere i make a patch for it or put entire installer here too. 

Also, there is no 28 mar release yet (that annon is 26 march too, but from filename i bet it can be trusted if you wish to download it from him :) ).
