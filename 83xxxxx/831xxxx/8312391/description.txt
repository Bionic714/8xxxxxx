Long story short, place was PACKED, and I had forgot my stand (doh!) so I used the ua-5 for the board and ran the internals; 
while the internals are kind of distant on their own, the board feed came out great, so here it is for your listening enjoyment!! 
If anyone wants to do a post mix or a 'matrix', let me know and I'll provide the master 24b files. 
In the meantime, this band is ON FIRE right now - pull this down if you're on the fence or you haven't heard of them. 
Go to their shows, buy their merch, and check out their website. 
Share, never sell, and as Ribblefribbitz says: "Please do not convert to Edison tin cylinders or 78rpm wax discs."
