Honda Pilot Service Manual 2003 2004 2005 2006

This is what people sell on Ebay and claim to be a *Factory* Service Manual.  It is not the Factory Manual Honda dealer mechanics use.  It appears to be stuff collected from http://alldata.com , a company which sells proprietary information which should be open-source to independent mechanics via a subscription service.

Although better than nothing, it's not a genuine Factory Service Manual.  I believe those are only available in paper for this model Honda.

I purchased this information and now release it into the wild.  Why?  Because working people deserve this old car repair information because corporations have unfair legal advantages.  We have to fight back in every way possible.

Successful wrenching is resistance to tyranny.  Keep up the Good Work.  from Charlie P.
