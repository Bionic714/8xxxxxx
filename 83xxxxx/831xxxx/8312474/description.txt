Parabola GNU/Linux is a libre software project aiming to provide a fully free as in freedom distribution based on the packages of the Archlinux distribution, with packages optimized for i686, x86_64, and Loongson 2F (mips64el) CPUs. Parabola aims to keep its package and management tools simple. The primary goal is to give the user complete control over their system with 100% Libre software. Parabola is listed by the Free Software Foundation as a fully free software distribution.

Development is focused on a balance of simplicity, elegance, code-correctness and bleeding edge free software.

Its lightweight and simple design makes it easy to extend and mold into whatever kind of system you're building.

I highly recommend the use of Parabola Linux. It's like Arch Linux, but far better.
