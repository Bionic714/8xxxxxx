================== !!! TESTED !!! ======
Yo can use a 32 Gb FAT32 formated USB stick.

Put all the folders Disk1, Disk2 and Disk3 on the USB drive

1. Move the content from Disk1 one into the root of the stick ("config.nfm" file and "pkgdb" folder).
It will ask for the second USB stick -&gt; remove the USB drive, insert it into computer and delete "config.nfm" file and "pkgdb" folder from root.
2. Copy the config.nfm file and pkgdb folder from Disk2 into the root of the USB drive.
3. Repeat for Disk3!

This is fast and clean!

========
If you want to use DVD+DL, try Verbatim Dual Layer Disks.
Copy the content of Disk1, Disk2 and Disk3 directly into the root of each disk.
