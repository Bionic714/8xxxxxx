,kkotd,2013-03-29T23:33Z,"dumyalex06: The paid game barely works half the time... So it's not EZ's fault, it's just a shit broken game."
,Creeprrnugget,2013-03-29T23:47Z,Works. Thanks man.
,nwfd22,2013-03-30T16:15Z,"okay i have tried to download this several times, and even different torrents....can not copy anything from crack folder, it tells me i do not have permission,  game will not run because it says it needs steam client....soooooo wtf am i doing wrong here"
,OMFA,2013-03-30T18:40Z,"gg, but, hard :o"
,pcbflare,2013-03-31T16:46Z,"nwfd22: your AV is probably blocking it... for example AVG detects some trojan, but since it's torrent from extremezone, i'm think it's just classic false positive... just include the dll into your AV exception list and then it will let you copy the file..."
,pcbflare,2013-03-31T17:08Z,anyway the game is baaaad... it feels like a bad clone... the best bridge building games were pontifex1 & 2 + bridge it... i didn't like those  released later.. there isn't even replay mode or custom cameras... screw that.
,HATERSXGONNAHATE,2013-04-01T05:35Z,O.O where can I get the song from the installer?
,FluidGas,2013-04-11T09:06Z,"Warning : this game is f*ing addictive ! I hope an addon with extra maps will come soon, I'll be glad to buy it.

if you can buy this game, do it !"
,volc123,2013-04-20T01:47Z,"Thanks alot extremezone, thumbs up for the torrent. It works perfectly. But thumbs down for the game. Poorly implemented physics leave the game half-made. I wont buy that game. I'd rather stick to Bridge 2000 (Bridge IT). Thanks ! I will continue seeding."
,EKSWHYZED,2013-04-20T09:30Z,"WORKS great.

Pistons were f$@!# hard to figure out.
Found a pistons tutorial on ytube

,BobVilaHomeAgain,2013-05-22T22:53Z,I have some kind of graphics errors on some maps. It makes some maps totally unplayable.
