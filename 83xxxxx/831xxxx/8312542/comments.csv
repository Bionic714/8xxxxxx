,Hades77,2013-03-30T21:17Z,"I just resgister so I can comment that it doesn't work.I am not noob,playing with 1.9.32 patched game(with Dlcs etc) till now using CK 1.8 with no problems(even multiple master files enabled) but this version simply it's stopped loading(actually get stucked no matter how many time I leave it loading..)  when at status bar says that ""Windows initialiazed"" something. Any clues ? 
1.8 CK works fine with game 1.9.32 though."
,alibabi1201,2013-04-01T09:33Z,"Works perfectly fine for me, including loading all the DLCs. I chose not to replace the steam_api.dll, and instead kept the steam_api.dll from Reloaded's Update 13.

Also, make sure your SkyrimEditor.ini is set up correctly. Add under [General] (if not already there):
bAllowMultipleMasterLoads=1

Under [Archive], replace the SArchiveList line with (all one line):
SArchiveList=Skyrim - Textures.bsa, Skyrim - Meshes.bsa, Skyrim - Animations.bsa, Skyrim - Voices.bsa, Skyrim - Interface.bsa, Skyrim - Misc.bsa, Skyrim - Sounds.bsa, Skyrim - VoicesExtra.bsa, Skyrim - Shaders.bsa, Update.bsa, Dawnguard.bsa, Hearthfires.bsa, Dragonborn.bsa

Also under [Archive], replace the SResourceArchiveList2 line with (all one line):
SResourceArchiveList2=Skyrim - Shaders.bsa, Update.bsa, Dawnguard.bsa, Hearthfires.bsa, Dragonborn.bsa"
,Hades77,2013-04-04T13:26Z,"I've done all that,I tried with Reloaded's steam_api.dll file,and tried also with the  one from this torrent..nothing.However 1.8 CK works fine wtih game 1.9"

Even legit users have countless problems with the CK. I say google it and you might find a solution"
