Johnny has the perfect life: a hot young girlfriend, loving parents, and an acceptance letter to an Ivy League law school. The only problem is, he secretly feels the life mapped out for him isn't the one he wants. Enter Rayveness--a beautiful older woman who makes Johnny feel understood--and hot with desire. Will Johnny reveal that he wants to give up everything for the love of his mother's best friend? Mr Pete gives Johnny some advice about older women--and recalls his own scorching hot affair with busty Cougar Deauxma.
