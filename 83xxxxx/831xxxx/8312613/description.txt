Notes
French source is better than US/UK source which was encoded 2 weeks ago, but the beginning and end have French titles
and lot worse picture quality (interlacing artifacts). So I used US source for these parts.
There is also 2 frame glitch in FRE (studio-made) - 1 black frame and 1 missing frame - it was fixed too.
Audio in US Blu-ray is 250 ms out of synch which I didn't notice before (thx kukushka for pointing that out). Audio in this encode is in synch.
