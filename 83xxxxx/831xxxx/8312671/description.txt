This is a ready-to-be-burned-to-a-blank-DVD of the new Channel 4 show, "Derek" starring Ricky Gervais. It has all seven episodes including the pilot and the Making of Derek documentary as well. Oh, and a menu as well! 

Please don't bother posting here if you don't know what an ISO is or are having problems burning it. I really don't give a turtle's fuck. Google it like everyone else. 

Enjoy!
