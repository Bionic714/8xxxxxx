,lazyboy13,2013-03-29T10:15Z,Thank you nobbish but do you how i can change the language as its not in english 
,Spiritfingers,2013-03-29T12:55Z,Would be awesome if anyone knew how to change it to English! Other than that it works
,boo991,2013-03-29T12:59Z,"This game has been ported by TyllerAllen86's wrapper on The Porting Team:

http://portingteam.com/files/file/7765-the-walking-dead-survival-instinct/

Use this instead if you want it in English. Both of them crash if you press ESC in-game."
,Namdhak,2013-03-29T18:05Z,so how do i run it with the port
,Namdhak,2013-03-29T19:38Z,got it working with english pack
,le_manol,2013-03-29T20:16Z,"Hey guys,

I've got a problem. I copied the App into my apps and i replaced the files that arre in the ""Crack"" folder that came in the wrapper that boo991 gently told us to download to have the game in english.

Well it works, but i have a black screen when the game should start (after the menu and stuffs, after the loading screen). I can hear the sound but can't see the image... 
I tried without the upgrade (home edition amateur upgrade in fact) and it's the same thing, black screen.


Do you know why?"
,GrunnyRiku,2013-03-30T17:20Z,All we need is the LANGUAGE.POD for english. i found the german (not russian) one. if you really wanted you could go through and change all the items one by one but if you could just get the .pod file in english and replace it that should work
,TylerAllen86,2013-03-31T05:28Z,"@boo991
Thanks for the shout out. I'm looking into the esc issue btw."
,floq123,2013-04-01T00:15Z,"To change the language to english follow this steps:

- Go to Applications Folder
- Right-click on TWD Survival Instinct and select Show Package Contents
- Go to drive_c > Program Files > The Walking Dead Survival Instinct
- Open the file ""steam_rld.ini""
- At the end of the file change the ""Language=russian"" to ""Language=english""

Voilà :D"

Thanks for the tip. But when I did that, I got the following error message:

There is an error with the installation of your Master Wrapper. Please update your Wrapper in Wineskin Winery (a manual install of a wrapper for Wineskin Winery will work too)"
