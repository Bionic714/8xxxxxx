,Slasherlord,2013-04-17T22:20Z,"This terminates with an Exception Error 0xc0000135 even on Fresh Windows XP Installs. Definitely looks like a Malware with these fake Exception Errors while it does its job in the background, though my Malwarebyte didn't detect it as malicious. Now I will know what to blame, in case my Internet Speed sees a sudden downfall. I'm a Computer Engineer, my recommendation> Don't even bother downloading it!!"
,Slasherlord,2013-04-17T22:38Z,Update: The Exception Error was fixed after Installing DOT NET Framework 3.0 on Fresh Windows XP. Will update after testing the Serial
,Slasherlord,2013-04-18T20:17Z,Update: It works to register the Software and no errors so far. Thank you

,Jailing,2013-05-26T22:20Z,"Well now... AVG picked up the Keygen (Obviously) It always does that, removed the Keygen after successfully installing SVP12 today i ran a MalwareBytes full scan because AVG found the Keygen Trojan thought it rather odd.

Scan finished and results were
Backdoor.Agent.DC & Malware.Trace 

The Keygen works but with no Skull it is hard to say if Legit or Legit&Virus.

Either way It's dealt with. "
