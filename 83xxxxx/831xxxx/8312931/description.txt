Six weeks before his death at age 51, Bill Evans' last trio made this record at 

Ronnie Scotts in London.  His last recording was made soon after in San Francisco,

also a live recording.


The piano is in need of a tuning but Bill plays with great urgency and energy.


As important a player as Bud Powell IMO.  As with Powell, all jazz pianists

who came after were strongly influenced by their music.
