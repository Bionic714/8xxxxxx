,bluejay21,2013-03-29T23:17Z,"GUYS DON'T DOWNLOAD FROM YIFY if you want ANY amount of quality. His file sizes are so small because he converts the video using ridiculously low bitrates. His 720p is more like 400p and his 1080p is more like 700p. And the audio is crap. Especially if you're watching this on a TV, download a bigger file."

He is simply trying to educate for the people who don't know, which obviously is 90% of the people who download YIFY rips.  Hence why everyone argues claiming YIFY rips are flawless when they're def not, especially action movies.  Way to many artifacts.  Also he is entitled to his opinion, anyone who says you cant have an opinion unless you create your own releases is just a plain douche bag."
