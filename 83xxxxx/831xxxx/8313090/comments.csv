,free3dom,2013-03-31T16:36Z,Thanks! Page 8 is corrupt in the 2048px version. In both this set and the 1-10 set.
[V],blackcanary,2013-05-02T02:36Z,"free3dom, I just checked the archive in this torrent and in the #1-10 torrent and page 8 and all of the other pages of the 2048px version view fine in CDisplayEx as well as when I extract the image and view it in an image viewer.  What application are you using to view this issue?  Have you tried extracting the image to see if you're able to view it?"
