http://www.Speed. CdAcclaimed war photojournalist Don McCullin speaks candidly about his three-decade career covering wars and humanitarian disasters on virtually every continent. 
From 1969 to 1984, he served as a lead photographer at "The Sunday Times" in London where he covered stories ranging from the war in Vietnam to the plight of the homeless in the London of the swinging sixties. 
We explore not only McCullin's life and work but also how the ethos of journalism changed over the course of his career.
