--------------

Works BEST with Windows 7/Vista x64
Works with 7/Vista x86
Works with Surface/Surface PRO, and Older Tablet PC navigation support.
Works with Windows 8 x86/x64 LIMITED GRAPHICS driver support NOW -see below

Works with Windows 8, however many video card manufacturer's do NT have proper  drivers for Windows 8, IE Intel Graphics for sure is the biggest problem.  Make sure your vid card has working accelerated graphics, or this won't even install.   NVIDIA card work the BEST in Win8 thus far. Decent ATI HD cards aren't a problem.

Primary objective right now are having a pack that can install on anything, the goal of this isn't to have

The included installer has several fixes, many have installed this pack, then opted to upgrade the BlueStacks components on their own...  Guess we all know how that worked out...  Don't do this.

If anyone does come across driver for Win8 that work, post me a make/model and link to driver.

Enjoy!

,sirsmokes,2013-04-11T01:20Z,"hey js great upload thanks a bunch.the simplicity of the root method is a time saver.

i have 2 questions
1.how do i access the sd card to copy SD game data to it. This version of bluestacks doesnt allow the .fs hack.
2.y cant i connect to playstore?

Again I appreciate your time :-)"
,js99912,2013-04-19T21:24Z,"two easy ways to get the data into the environment, first, in windows you can move/copy any data you'd like to C:ProgramDataBlueStacksUserDataSharedFolder (create a shrcut to this if you like)

Then in ES file explorer, go to bstfolder the SharedFolder and there is your shit.

or
Share out the folder is Windows, network share
In ES file explorer go to LAN, SCAN r Add server 10.0.2.2 with your local PC username and password.

Open it and there's your Shit.

And google play, you can reset it with post from above, or install the cracked version found latest here: http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8365566
