Milt Jackson is best known as the vibist with MJQ (Modern Jazz Quartet)

His unique sound is due to his intentional slowing of the trem rotor on

his vibraphone.


This album is "MJQ meets the Jazztet" in a way since 2 members from each of

those 2 excellent groups participate


Any album with Benny Golson is a safe bet!..............fA
