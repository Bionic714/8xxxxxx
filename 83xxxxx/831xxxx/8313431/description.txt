2008 - Warner Music Japan / WPCR-12865 / Japan Remastered / CD

Recorded in 1977 and released in February of 1978, it is considered to be one of the most famous debut albums by a hard rock/heavy metal band in history along with such albums as Led Zeppelin's Led Zeppelin, The Jimi Hendrix Experience's Are You Experienced, Boston's Boston, Black Sabbath's Black Sabbath and Guns N' Roses' Appetite for Destruction.

The album has sold over ten million copies in the United States alone and is considered to be one of the most successful debuts by a hard rock band. Along with 1984, it gives Van Halen two original (not a greatest hits) albums with Diamond status in sales -- a feat achieved by only four other rock bands: The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, and Def Leppard.

From a technical perspective, Eddie Van Halen's guitar solo, "Eruption", was hugely influential on many guitarists. The cadenza near the end is generally regarded as seminal in the development of fretboard tapping, a virtuosic style of solo guitar playing which became popular in the 1980s. The solo's "dive-bomb" pitches also led to the wide-spread use of bridge tremolo bars. "Eruption" was added to the album when producer, Ted Templeman heard Eddie warming up with the instrumental. Eddie told Ted that it was just a solo piece he played live.

The album cover was shot at the world famous Whisky a Go Go.
