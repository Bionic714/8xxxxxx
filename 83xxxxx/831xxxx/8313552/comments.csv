Two songs are incomplete. 
If this is really the new album of LDR, I am wondering,why nobody else is uploading this album on TPB ...  
Thanks for the upload ...  "
,VelvetPoison,2013-04-01T18:19Z,"I don't know what's the problem with this torrent, but I tried to download it on my other laptop and I also got stuck at 99.4% and Never Let Me Go and Serial Killer were not complete. I reuploaded it and you can download the corrected version of this album here: http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8328704"
,drivebybr,2013-04-04T18:13Z,"Anyone who knows lana del rey would know that this isn't a real album. These songs are just the ""leaked"" songs that didn't make it on her born to die/paradise album, with the exception of chelsea hotel. "
,StarCity2010,2013-04-14T06:42Z,FAKE! You people are idiots. These are old songs that have been round for ages. There is no new album.
