.: Plot :.
ARCTIC AIR is a character-driven, one hour adventure series set in the booming North about a maverick airline and the extended family of unconventional people who run it. Mel, the cantankerous owner keeps his crew of pilots in the air while Bobby, his headstrong business partner, saves the airline from crashing. Each week their hot-shot pilots take on any number of flights to deliver cagey prospectors, to secret diamond mining sites, rescue scientists from a snowed in research camp, water bomb forest fires, or play tour guide for polar bear-seeking Japanese tourists.
