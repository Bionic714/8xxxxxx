Jonathan Morgan is one of LA's most-respected and wealthiest psychiatrists. He knows the mysteries of the human mind inside and out. He's brilliant, self-aware and has no shortage of mating opportunities. So why is he about to do something so stupid as marry a girl he has only known for three weeks? The answer to that question is part of what makes this shot-on-film feature such a unique treat - the psychological depth with which it instills its characters. It's two other crowning features are its stand-out plot and the scorching sex one finds in just about every scene. The plot is as follows: Jonathan, having talked himself into the marriage, is on his way to the ceremony. Car trouble forces him to hitch a ride. He is picked up by Sydney Steele, who is on the run from her psychotic pimp boyfriend. Her first impulse is to rob Jon, and she takes him to an ATM. When he calls out to some passers-by for help, Sydney runs off with his wallet. He spends the rest of the film trying to get the wallet back and make it to his wedding. The sex part is scorching all the way through with each of the female cast members turning in career-best work. An AVN Spotlight Pick
