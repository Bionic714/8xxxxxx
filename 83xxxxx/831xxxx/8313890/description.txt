Here are two audio versions of Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot, often called the most important play of the 20th century. The 1956 version is the first American production starring Bert Lahr and E.G. Marshall. The other is recorded from Irish Radio Theater.
The 1956 recording is very rare, so spread it around so it won't be so rare.
