,PR_GMR,2013-04-09T06:48Z,"No good, I'm afraid. Unable to boot from disc. 32-bit version. Running Win XP."
,PR_GMR,2013-04-09T07:46Z,"Spoke to soon. When upgrading from Win XP, you have to restart computer and boot from disc to start install. It wipes your whole drive, though. Will now attempt install."
