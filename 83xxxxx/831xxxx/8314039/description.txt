I couldn't find a free download of any of these albums anywhere, so I took some time to collect and compile all of the individual tracks into what hopefully resembles the actual albums.

The volumes were divided into a first half with Edits, and a second half with Full-versions of each song. I've only included the Edits because I didn't feel like doing twice the work for something I'm not personally interested in. When I couldn't find an Edit, it was substituted by the Full-version, and when I couldn't find neither, I ripped it from a continuous mix.

 - Bitrate varies between about 192-320 kbit/s, depending on what I could find.
 - Album covers (500x500) are embedded and available separately.
 - Most tags are either edited to be accurate, or cleared.

Finally, the second track in Volume 4 (Not Gonna Save the World) is stated in the official track lists to be the Cc.K mix, but the one included on the album (and in this compilation) is the Scoon & Delore mix.

SEEDING: I have no server, and my internet connection is a meager 1/1, but I'll seed whenever possible for the following year. If you really want this torrent after that, and there are no other seeders, send your tears to eminor992@gmail.com and I'll seed for another day or two.
