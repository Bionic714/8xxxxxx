,floriduhh,2013-03-29T19:22Z,"Pretty good video quality for a TS. Audio is good as well - just way outta sync. 

SOLUTION: use VLC Media Player, go to Adjustment and Effects>Synchronization. DELAY the audio for 18.300s

You're welcome

,SomeBoyFromVillage,2013-03-29T19:56Z,"@kokotysko
VLC player :-)"
,crumrugin,2013-03-29T20:30Z,18 seconds!? you have to be kidding... that is ridiculous... Wait for a re-up
,kokotysko,2013-03-29T21:14Z,"i am using VLC... last version on w8
find the solution, had to increasing the delay slowly"
,floriduhh,2013-03-30T00:38Z,"Yep-the solution is delay the audio in VLC media player for 18.300s. Took me a few times--and you definitely have to slowly increase the delay of the audio until you reach 18.300s. 

It's a huge sync issue but this fix works until a proper comes out. 

I'm pretty sure the audio is cam audio and not line audio. Occasionally you hear coughing and some audience laughing. Other than that, the audio is pretty damn good.

Great movie-very suspenseful-gets your heart rate going."
