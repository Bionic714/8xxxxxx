,dfl3506,2013-03-30T02:00Z,"A9, V9 Don't they clean rental cars when they're returned? Yet the guy finds a cell phone a gun and a bound woman in his rental. Unbelievable!"

,michaelrwatson,2013-03-30T21:57Z,"Eh, this seems to be what i was looking for: uncropped but with that sleazy Arabic watermark blurred out. Thanx. And, i hope ""watch-listen"" simply has hardware issues."
,Zacman86,2013-03-31T03:43Z,THE WORST PIECE OF SHIT MOVIE I HAVE SEEN IN A VERY LONG TIME! MAIN CHARS DIE AND THE ACTING IS SO BAD I ACTUALLY LAUGH! FUCKING PATHETIC PAUL WALKER DOING SHIT TRASH LIKE THIS! I EXPECTED MORE! GIVE ME BACK 1.5 HRS OF MY LIFE!
,Ravenwilde,2013-03-31T06:11Z,@ZACMAN86 Thanks for the spoiler in future please don't tell people the ending. 
,Ravenwilde,2013-03-31T06:15Z,"@Zacman86  Thanks for the spoiler you just ruined the movie, in future please don't let people know th ending.

,nobodynever,2013-03-31T07:38Z,"In all fairness, this movie was ruined the moment it was conceived.  I liked Paul Walker too, pity. "
,injun_mojo,2013-03-31T07:47Z,bad bad bad movie dont waste your time.
,BaconFappage,2013-03-31T08:23Z,"Paul walker is probably the worst actor in history.. He got a bone thrown to him with fast and the furious, he's on par with Casper Van Dien of starship troopers"
,SimpleeDa,2013-03-31T23:42Z,"By far the worst Movie EVER! Please , dont waste the time, youll never get it back"
,The_Chob,2013-04-01T07:33Z,"Zacman86 didnt spoil anthing. did he mean character by chars? cause thats not true. This movie has some good parts. Good idea. BUT, terrible acting, too slow and drawn out. Random parts the actor just sits there with a stupid look on his face instead of reacting to the situation. If you Fastforward the slow parts, so about half the movie, its a great movie. Except the very end. "
,eklypze,2013-04-01T09:58Z,"Although I love the Fast and the Furious, Paul Walker has to be one of the worst actors."
,michaelrwatson,2013-04-01T10:35Z,"Wow, those comments above are correct--THIS MOVIE SUCKS!  I couldn't even finish watching it.

If you just want to watch Paul Walker, see The Skulls or Eight Below instead--both very good flix."
,5iF3R,2013-04-01T17:25Z,"@michaelrwatson - Thanks for the heads up, cheers!"
