About the Book:

There's a big difference between investing in the stock market and investing in companies through the stock market. The Strategic Dividend Investor shows you why, over the long run, investing in companies with high and rising distributions is far superior to "playing the market."

Responsible for $4.5 billion in dividend-anchored portfolios, Daniel Peris demonstrates that, for most investors, buying a stock in the hope of making a quick buck by selling it in a few weeks or months is far from the best way to create wealth. Instead, you should use the stock market as a means of receiving a share of excess profitsΓÇödividendsΓÇöfrom corporations in which you own stock. Over time, those paymentsΓÇöand the growth of those paymentsΓÇörepresent the vast majority of stock market returns.

The Strategic Dividend Investor outlines the key issues you need to address in order to create a solid dividend portfolio, including how to: View the stock market as a business venture rather than as a platform for speculation Strike the right balance between current yield and dividend growth Learn to assess the ability and inclination of a company to pay and increase its dividends over time

The real key to mastering the stock market is to take the stock out of the equation and treat your outlay as you would any other business investmentΓÇöwith an eye to the long term and to cash returns.

By contrast, the "buy low, sell high, repeat frequently" philosophy foisted on the investing public has been wrecking portfolios on Main Street for decades, all the while generating big profits for Wall Street. But after a decade of mediocre returns from the stock marketΓÇöhighlighted by two dramatic crashesΓÇönow is the time to refocus your portfolio on dividends, and The Strategic Dividend Investor will show you how.
