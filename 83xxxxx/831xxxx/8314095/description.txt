This torrent contains "Pokemon Blue" with the original graphics.

Use an emulator(Visual Boy Advance) to play it. Link below.

When Pokémon first came out in Japan, they were known as Pokémon Red & Green. Several months later, the first third version came out, called Pokémon Blue. In the Japanese Pokemon Blue, the sprites were different, the wild Pokémon were changed, the in-game trades were changed, the Cerulean Cave layout was changed, and the tileset graphics were changed. When they decided to localize Pokémon, rather than translating Pokemon Red & Green, they decided to translate Pokémon Blue, and keep the graphics of Pokémon Blue, but use the wild Pokémon and in-game trades from Pokémon Red & Green. Do you know what this means? Not very many people know what Kanto originally looked like! And I'm not talking about Pokémon Red & Blue that you've all played, I'm talking about the original originals!

Did that not make sense? Well, imagine it like this: Let's pretend Pokémon Diamond & Pearl was never released in America, and Pokémon Platinum already came out in Japan. Then let's pretend they finally decide to release Pokémon Diamond & Pearl in America, so they take Pokémon Platinum, change the wild Pokémon to the Diamond/Pearl ones, and then release it as Diamond & Pearl, even though it's actually Platinum. That's exactly what happened in Gen I!
