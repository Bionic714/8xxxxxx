The surprising story of eccentric young scientists who stood up to conventionΓÇöand changed the face of modern physics.

Today, quantum information science is among the most exciting scientific frontiers, attracting billions of dollars in funding and thousands of talented researchers. But as MIT physicist and historian David Kaiser reveals, this cutting-edge field has a surprisingly psychedelic past. How the Hippies Saved Physics introduces us to a band of freewheeling physicists who defied the imperative to ΓÇ£shut up and calculateΓÇ¥ and helped to rejuvenate modern physics.

In the 1970s, amid severe cutbacks in physics funding, a small group of underemployed physicists in Berkeley decided to throw off the constraints of academia and explore the wilder side of science. Dubbing themselves the ΓÇ£Fundamental Fysiks Group,ΓÇ¥ they pursued an unconventional, speculative approach to physics. They studied quantum theory alongside Eastern mysticism and psychic mind-reading, discussing the latest developments while lounging in hot tubs. Unlikely as it may seem, their work on BellΓÇÖs theorem and quantum entanglement helped pave the way for todayΓÇÖs breakthroughs in quantum information science.
