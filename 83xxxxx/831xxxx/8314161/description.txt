As a baby, the Chosen One had his family attacked and murdered by evil Master Pain, with only his martial arts skills saving him. Undefeated but broken, the Chosen One is raised by various rats and things in the valley and, as an adult he finds himself under constant attack from those that would seek to do the job they failed to do when he was a baby. Seeking help from the Master Tang's Crane school to hone his style and make him stronger, the countdown is on till a showdown between Master Pain and the Chosen One.

In case the title leaves you with any doubt that this is going to be a silly film, the opening scene features a terrible CGI baby fighting with a ninja master. This silly approach continues throughout and the entire thing is one big nonsense from start to finish. Mixing modern footage that is dubbed and excerpts from Hu He Shuang Xing, the approach is very simple but does produce some silly laughs. Too much of it is too puerile to appeal to a mass audience (that cow fight was just stupid and unfunny) but at times it is very funny just because it is so off the wall and has lots of lines that are unexpected.
