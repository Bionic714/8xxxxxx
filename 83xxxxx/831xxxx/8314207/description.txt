DESCRIPTION:

The Complete Home Decorating Idea Book focuses on vertical and horizontal surfaces by examining not only windows, walls and floors but also celebrates the fifth wall ceilings! 
Readers will discover the clever possibilities for treating surfaces of all kinds with paint, wallpaper, tile, stone, fabric and more. 
Beginning with a chapter on a personal favorite, window treatments, Stoehr covers all types of hard and soft window products, as well as how to approach the decoration of a large window wall. 
A chapter on wall coverings follows, including paint, paper, tile, stone, fabric and wood. 
In section three, the decorated ceiling pulls our eyes upward from the horizontal sweep we normally experience in a room, creating a sense of satisfied completion to any interior. 
Decorated ceilings, our interior sky is attention to detail at its best, creating drama in the dining room or a calm, restful environment in the bedroom. 
Finally, we look to the floor, an area frequently overlooked but is the ultimate component for finishing any room with style. All this and more, including thousands of today's top interior photographs, will be found in The Complete Home Decorating Idea Book.
