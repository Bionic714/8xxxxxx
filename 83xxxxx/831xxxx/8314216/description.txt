For this CD, Yamamoto chose to play two compositions with each of four
partners: saxophonist Daniel Carter, drummers Hamid Drake and Federico Ughi and
bassist William Parker. Each player brings his particular voice to the
performances and Yamamoto composed to each of her collaborator's strengths, so
the disc feels a bit like a sampler, a distillation of four different
albums. From Carter, she coaxes his most lyrical playing, his alto impossibly
wistful and dreamy on "Conversations." Drake plays frame drum on both of his
selections and "Midtown Blues" features Yamamoto's jaunty, brawny physicality
and strong left hand making up for the lack of an anchoring double bass. That
anchor returns courtesy of William Parker and "Muse" radiates with warmth,
regret, beauty and hope, while the opening "Thank You," with Ughi at the kit,
is dramatically propulsive.

Duologue is characterized by lovely songcraft and guileless performances and is
a perfect showcase for Yamamoto's dense, impressionistic cascades and dazzling
romantic swoon. The inside cover photo of the five musicians, lined up arm in
arm, proves they were all together at one time in one spot. What a quintet that
would be.
