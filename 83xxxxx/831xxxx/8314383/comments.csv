,markellison,2013-03-31T13:01Z,"how about updates? btw, it's not an iso file after unpack the rar file i've got many folders and a setup.exe "
,3Dazz,2013-04-01T13:46Z,Activation Failed = Torrent FAILED !!
,chop007,2013-04-05T17:53Z,"Use kms activator/office toolkit, it will activate this crap torrent. I also downloaded the entire thing only to find out it is a waste of time piece of crap. Initially it said, 'no activation required', then the uploader changed it to 'no activation', what a prick. Anyways, what can one do, just use ativator that comes with any 2013 office kms etc etc."
