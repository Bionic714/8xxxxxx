Raj Kumar lives a poor lifestyle with his widowed mom but has dreams of making it big. He gets employed as a Typist with Ranjit & Co., makes a lot of errors and is warned. He takes the warning to heart, improves his work and is soon promoted to the position of Superintendent by the owner, Ranjit Rai. While on a holiday, he meets with an attractive village belle, Gauri, and both fall in love with each other. He is introduced to her dad, and promises to return within one year and marry Gauri. When he returns home, he is told by Ranjit that he is now the Manager, and a few weeks later he is made a Partner. Ranjit wants Raj to marry his only daughter, Madhu, who is cultured, foreign educated, and attracted to Raj - all the more so when Raj finds that she resembles Gauri. Raj must now decide whether he wants to keep his promise to marry Gauri or wed her look-alike Madhu - and if he does not - chances are he may lose his job and his position as Partner.
