"Kinghorse was one of the inventors of the metal-punk sound, although it's always the immitators, never the innovators, who get all the glory. 

The sound is tight and razor-sharp. Black Sabbath meets Black Flag, but with a healthy dose of originality and mania all their own. Kinghorse, their debut CD is a wild ride though screaching vocals, whoa-ho-ho chants, and crazy lyrics.
