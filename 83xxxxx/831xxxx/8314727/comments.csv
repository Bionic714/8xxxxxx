,bktheman,2013-03-29T13:04Z,does this mean you are 'done' with movies sir?
[V],V3nom,2013-03-29T13:41Z,"@bktheman nope i will continue to encoding,im just having a little break from movies as u can see..."
,RadChico,2013-04-04T15:14Z,When will the full HQ album be released? Most of the songs on this torrent are live or LQ :/ 
,Almirtos,2013-04-05T15:34Z,"I am with RadChico that the album is not the final release and is only 256kbps (which is not too bad) and some songs are cut before their end, however I would like to thank the poster, because, to date, it's better than nothing and the quality, not being perfect, is decent."
,RadChico,2013-04-07T19:19Z,@Almirtos agreed. Thanks for V3nom but please help us at least find out when the 320 album will be out. 
,kieok,2013-04-08T01:11Z,"According to the website, the official album will be released on the 29th."
,RadChico,2013-04-08T07:24Z,"Thanks all. @V3nom counting on you now, waiting for the 29th"
