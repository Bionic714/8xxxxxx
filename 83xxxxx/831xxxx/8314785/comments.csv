,RonDamon79,2013-03-29T14:26Z,Thanks so much for this. 
,RonDamon79,2013-03-29T14:31Z,You don't get mad if i put spanish subtitles on it and re- upload te movie??? there's a lot of people in south america who doesn't know that this movie exist.
[V],sujaidr,2013-03-29T14:58Z,"@RonDamon79,i have no probs but dont u think a easier way would be to just give a link to spanish subtitles and i dont think tpb allows re uploading..."
,RonDamon79,2013-03-29T15:33Z,"Hmmm i don't think there would be a problem 'cause it will be a different file, and the link to subtitles it's not a very good idea because the thing i do is, downloading a subtitle, fix it , sincronize it with the movie and then upload the file with the correct harcoded spanish subtitles."
[V],sujaidr,2013-03-29T16:41Z,"@RonDamon79,go ahead,being a kubrick fan i would like it if more people get to watch this..."
