Celine Dion never ceases to amaze me. Her singing voice is the best in the business. This album of greatest hits and more is a showcase of that amazing voice and talent. For those of you who missed out on all those great songs of Celine, buy this album. They are beautiful. I would have liked to see a track from her first English language album Unison like Where Does My Heart Beat Now, but still a great record. I specifically bought this album for the new tracks. Without exception, they are great. That's the Way it Is is a great uptempo song with an inspirational message. If Walls Could Talk written by Robert John "Mutt" Lange is a unique song unlike Celine has ever sung. Shania Twain even does some back up here. (Mutt's wife) The First Time I Ever Saw Your Face is a remake of a Roberta Flack classic that I first heard on Celine's tv special last year. I was so pleased she put it on the album. It's a soft, sweet ballad. All the Way is the best of the new songs. It is her duet with Frank Sinatra. You should buy this album solely for that beautiful song. It is amazing. Then You Look at Me is a great power ballad written by My Heart Will Go On writers Will Jennings and James Horner. It has epic qualities like it belongs on the soundtrack for a movie. I Want You to Need Me is another power ballad written by the world's greatest ballad writer, Diane Warren. This should see radio play. Live is a great farewell song from Celine to the world. Celine will be taking a long break soon and will be dearly missed. But she'll be back. We await your return.
