This Encode has been tested and doesn't work on Windows Media Player or QuickTime however it does work on VLC, Potplayer and MPC-HC.
If you have playback issues try installing the newest version of http://www.filehippo.com/download_klite_mega_codec/ 
and also works using MPC-HC (http://www.codecguide.com/download_kl.htm).
I recommend using http://thumperdc.com/forum/advanced-video-playback-a-white-paper-t70686.html for best video playback.
If you wish to convert the movie from MKV format to MP4 follow this link or search on Google 'MKV to MP4', it's a very easy process taking less than 5 minutes
