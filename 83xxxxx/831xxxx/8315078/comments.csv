I need to upload in order for peer-to-peer to find takers for all my Demonoid torrents. Without the D tracker it is hard to find them. So I seed these generously.

There are a long list of dead torrents in my queue. They were upped back when I was on Demonoid and not here. After getting here I searched on years and found them. Many I got, but not all.

When back on the D I wasn't paying attention to dates as I am now."
