,se7enipadd,2013-03-30T04:05Z,"First, THANKS a LOT! GREAT UPLOAD!
Second,I would like to ask...If i have v.15 installed. Do I need to uninstall this before installing v1.6?"
,se7enipadd,2013-03-30T04:23Z,"I manage to install it without uninstalling anything.
On my PC: AE CS6 64bit, Element 3D v1.5 (Metropolitan, all Model Packs).

Step/s I've done:
1. Download this file. (THANKS a LOT)
2. Simply install the ElementInstaller 1.6.exe.
3. Copy Element.aex from Element3D v1.6 - Crack folder. Then replace Element.aex from my  computer.
4. Open my AE CS, apply the Element 3D to a solid layer.
5. It did not  ask for any license?

But, anyways...THANKS Ching_Liu !
Keep sharing!"

,TorrMeZ,2013-03-31T03:19Z,"Thanks for another much-needed upload ChingLiu!!
But I must ask you, I cant seem to understand what you mean by ""generate a request when asked"" in your howtodownload notepad.... What do I do?? Sorry im kinda new to this"
,needforsuv,2013-03-31T11:16Z,THANKS it works with all previous packs and shaders etc fully
,deepuncle,2013-04-02T03:37Z,"Hi. Thank you for the upload. I've been looking for ways of cracking it but no luck for me so far. It says my license file is invalid.

I had a 1.0 version installed and it worked fine. The only reason I need a upgrade version is that it supports obj sequences since 1.5.

So if anyone figure out a different way to crack, or how to reset the registration records (if there were), please share it. My sincere thanks all uploaders in advance."
,juliet006,2013-04-06T07:35Z,"ChingLiu very big thanks,
long time need for a real crack of ETD 1.5 but now U give us ETD 1.6

U R our HERO

THANK YOU (again)"
,seedmouse,2013-04-14T04:16Z,"When I add Element to a new layer, right before the activation, I get this ""Element has encountered an unrecoverable error. Please compress and email to Video Copilot""? What is this suppose to mean? Thank you!"
,herpyderpyyy,2013-04-30T05:25Z,"If you're getting the ""License file seems to be invalid"" error make sure you use the ElementInstaller1.6 first. You must use the installer (which creates an Element.aex) THEN replace that with the cracked version. I'm willing to bet some of you went ahead and copied over the cracked version without using the installer."
,simroto,2013-05-07T02:31Z,"Hello,

Thank's for your hard work, I need some help with the new versions though I can't get them to work properly.
Element 3D 1.0.345 works just fine for me, but once i put 1.5 or 1.6 i can't add objects, nothing happens when i click on objects, no error, nothing...the scene remains empty as the preview panel. If i install 1.0.345, everything works again.

I'm on i7 920 | 6GB RAM | AMD 4890
Win 7 64bits / AE CS6"
