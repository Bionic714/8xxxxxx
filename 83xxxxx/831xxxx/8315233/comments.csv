I tried updating my Wine library but didn't work, is there one in particular needed?"
,Prblmoff,2013-04-01T21:35Z,"I figured it out
open the Bloodbowl folder which should be in your documents folder
open the config.xml with text editor or better yet text wrangler if oyu have
set Shader to 0 and Fullscreen to 1 in Config.xml.
save 
done!"
