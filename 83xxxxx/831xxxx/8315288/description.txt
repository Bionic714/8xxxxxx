Ron and Fez 2012 SiriusXM Shows

Last year (2012) I seeded a series of torrents of complete Ron and Fez SiriusXM shows in MP3 format on Demonoid.  It began with their very first XM show on September 12th, 2005, and ended with the last show of 2011.  Now I am pleased to present the Ron and Fez 2012 SiriusXM Shows torrent.

I make no claims that this contains every show of 2012 or that every single show is complete, but I can say that there is enough Ron and Fez here to listen to for a VERY long time (over 32 gigs worth in total).  

All MP3s are are properly tagged and encoded at 64kbps to save space due to the length of the shows - it is mostly talking anyway (some are at 128kbps).

The shows were all downloaded courtesy of SpreadTheOnAVirus.com at http://www.spreadtheonavirus.com.  Many, many thanks to ILuvDogShit who runs this site.  Amazing work, you da man.
