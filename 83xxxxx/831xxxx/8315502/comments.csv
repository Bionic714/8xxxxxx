The Keygen wants a request code before it can generate an activation code.

I'm normally good with keygen, but cannot figure this out at all.

What are we supposed to do?"
,terratec1234,2013-04-04T21:13Z,"PS The latest version is 9.4.8.8, although neither work with this Keygen as they both activate in the same manner."
,AmuLight,2013-04-04T22:46Z,"Terratec1234, it works with the latest version. Select 'online via browser', enter a random order number and name, and copy the code that it gives you on the next screen and copy it into the keygen. The keygen should spit out a string at you. Just copy that into the goodsync window and it will activate!"
,AmuLight,2013-04-04T22:49Z,"Also, it does not seem that 9.4.8.8 is a required update, as I had to do the update manually."
,terratec1234,2013-04-05T12:15Z,"For some bizarre reason, I was trying to guess an Order Code (xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx) which got denied for me.

The Order ID method DOES work.

Thanks for that :)"

That's just Fucked Up asshole!"

That's called a false positive. Learn to pirate."
