,Dradd32,2013-03-30T06:24Z,Just heads up if didnt know already there is a X-MEN Chrono set 28 &29 that has all  if not most of this in it already. Still a good up if cant get the other sets.. Thank you :)
,Dradd32,2013-03-30T06:33Z,I meant the revised version even...  Just trying to see if this is to be continiued from revised eventually or is this your own set? Got me a little confused especially with the numbering that the others were listed as & this one being 1 & on other than the last one I believe ending at  855 ...... Thx :)
