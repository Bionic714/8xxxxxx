This is Chronological X-Men Pack 2012 Continued. (Which I would have called Pack 31 but my lack of research, itΓÇÖs a huge web, would create some conflict, so IΓÇÖll work by year).  It might be pretty obvious for the titles in this Pack, that the Avengers and X-MenΓÇÖs worlds are beginning to merge.  Who knows how long this will last?  WeΓÇÖve had The Civil War, The Skrull Invasion, The House of M, and now AvX.  Heck after AvX Wanda and the Mutants are back.  Is this a second chance to make a first impression?  This Pack includes the event I have been really excited about: Avengers vs. X-Men.  When trying to decide on a reading order I found this at Phil The Comic GuyΓÇÖs blog:   I tried it, and I think he did an excellent job, as he has an excellent blog.

I am a big fan of the previous Chrono-packs and really enjoy reading runs of comics rather than as they come out month by month.  I have gone with the highest rez, best looking versions of each issue that I could come up with. 
 
My ground rules for inclusion are pretty broad.  I am trying to follow all of the mutants that we know and love where ever they appear.  So for instance if Wolverine, Storm, or the Beast are in an Avengers title, I include it, but if no mutants are included in a storyline at all I probably exclude it.  I consider Deadpool to be part of the mutant family, so you will see his stuff here also.  I think the orders here work pretty well, but you can reorder stuff as you see fit.  If anyone has suggestions of issues I might have missed let me know.  I will try to work them in.

Previous packs can be found hosted at kick ass torrents.  A place to start would be http://ka.tt/mangaphile-s-chronological-x-men-pack-19-t6590819.html
