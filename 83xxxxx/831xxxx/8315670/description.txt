Trance Nation- America Two: ATB, George Acosta

Just a lil' info for ya.... Since my CDs got scratched some years back I've looked all over for this album without any luck, so I tracked down every track and put them in order - so there may be a FEW somewhat different mixes *looks at 2nd CD*.  I did add the album art, however, I did not fill out all the mp3 tags (1st time uploader here!).  Great quailty, awesome music, enjoy & please seed!!!
