Inspired by the Mexican Day of the Dead, artist extraordinaire, RILEY ROSSMO (DEBRIS, GREEN WAKE, COWBOY NINJA VIKING, REBEL BLOOD) joins forces with nine different writers over three issues to tell tall tales from beyond the grave!

This issue's featured writers are JEFF MARIOTTE (FADE TO BLACK), ED BRISSON (COMEBACK) and JOSHUA WILLIAMSON (XENOHOLICS).

In this issue: Cartel soldiers visit the pits of Hell, a visitor to Mexico stumbles onto a black mass, and a man heart broken at the loss of his wife is reunited with her beyond the grave.
