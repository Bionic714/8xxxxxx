,StealthDragoon,2013-03-29T19:42Z,Awesome. I hope this fixes my problem... Thanks for the release.
,ribox60,2013-03-29T20:07Z,Yes! finally a fix for this damn game. heromaster have I told you you are  fastly becoming one of my favorite uploaders here on TPB! Thanks again anf have a awesome weekend!
,exposuree,2013-03-29T20:17Z,"while this fix is great, be careful when copying over the .rld file as it will delete your save file. I didn't know this and had to do a full reinstall just to be able to play online again."
,StealthDragoon,2013-03-29T20:32Z,"After installing this update, your game might be in Russian.

To remedy this, simply open steam_rld.ini in notepad and scroll all the way down. Set Language to English. (Language=english). 

Save, exit and play in english (or your desired language since RE6 supports many.)"
,StealthDragoon,2013-03-29T20:53Z,"Well, the game still crashes after the credit. I still can't try the Mercenaries. :("
,mmircetic,2013-03-30T16:53Z,"Yes,the game now is in russian,and NO,you cant change the language like stealthdragon said!!! allways something wrong dammit!!"
,mmircetic,2013-03-30T17:06Z,"This is valid update!!
