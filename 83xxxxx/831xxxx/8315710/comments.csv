,ryanhazen,2013-03-30T00:04Z,"scratch my last comment sorry, my only complaint now is SEED!!"
,suckmymcnuggets760,2013-03-30T00:21Z,i'm having issues downloading this cd. i cant connect to any of the seeds and i am connected to 69 peers. download speed is at about 0.4 kB/s. i had to download it from another site. but the quality does sound really good. 
,Bofu,2013-03-30T00:38Z,Seed please!
[T],Calypso127,2013-03-30T01:51Z,How does a band go from Metalcore to a screaming justin bieber
,Bofu,2013-03-30T04:34Z,"@Calypso dunno, ask Miss May I."
,ryanhazen,2013-03-30T21:02Z,"really doesn't sound like its 320kbps, i have the 192kbps versions and they sound the same, the only song that sound different is in due time, it sounds way different in a bad way from the 320kbps version i have to this one."
,TsarPr,2013-04-01T21:20Z,"@Calypso @Bofu 
Well, their singer Howard left them, so they brought back the original vocalist from the first 2 albums; The Self Titles (1st one), and Alive or Just Breathing (2nd). I think they're good, but I think they're good in a different way.  Hell In Me is an absolutely amazing song."
,tommy-gunn,2013-04-04T23:04Z,"i think the sound quality is pretty good, it's the low parts of the guitar but that might just be the amp effects and such
i like this new sound, the growling is pretty epic cheers for the torrent man"
