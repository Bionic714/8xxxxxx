Ep: The Art of Fashion
 
Released Mar 28, 2013
 
The Guggenheim serves as the latest inspiration for the design teams who take in all the art to create their own print textiles for their garments. The challenge leaves one designer in tears and causes some cat-fighting off the runway show. Designer Tracy Reese guest judges alongside designer Rachel Roy.
