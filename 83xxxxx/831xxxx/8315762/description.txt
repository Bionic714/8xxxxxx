Geek Magic with Tomas Medina (DVD) Human curiosities alive on the inside. WARNING: Content not suitable for viewers under 18.

You've heard of people with uncanny, unimaginable abilities. Personalities like Serpentina the snake charmer, Wee Willie the 400 pound fat boy, Bobo the human pin cushion and Tessie the Tattooed Woman. Imagine joining their ranks and performing the following feats of bizzareism:

Swallow and Maninpulate Razor Blades
Produce Live Bugs
Become a Human Spittoon
Ingest an Inflated Balloon
Drink Motor Oil
Chew on Broken Glass
And Much More!

These Stunts - to name but a few - are explained in excruciating (and often far too great) detail on Tomas Medina's Geek Magic DVD. This magic is not intended for the faint of heart - or stomach. 

It's all alive, on film, for your viewing and learning pleasure: on the inside!
