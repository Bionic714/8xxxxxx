Oh i see.... you doubled the filesize so it would take twice as long to download. Thanx so much! "

as for michaelrwatson, it's dvd format.(dvdr) conversion is done already. not the mp4 or avi as other torrents. sooooo if making a dvd you can skip 2hrs of encoding. btw awesome movie..i watched on movie2k. will download also to share with others."
