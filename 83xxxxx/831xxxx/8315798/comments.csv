,wasitreal,2013-03-30T01:50Z,"Thanks dude, your work is amazing, keep it up ! ;)"
,ZeroGravityZero,2013-03-30T04:09Z,"Much appreciated. Remember guys , if you like it , buy it when you have spare cash!"
,juandeviche,2013-03-30T06:17Z,"thanks heromaster, i really would like to buy games, but i have not credit card, and pay pal is not operating in colombia."
,NikolaTesla1,2013-03-30T15:50Z,"I have core i3 processor and ati 6370 hd, i runing bioshock infinite on medium on 720p and around 25 fps, and fucking salamander on 720p resolution and low settings gives me around 12 fps! Game is bad and not so scary!"
,r083r73h,2013-03-30T16:12Z,"Remember this is an indi developer who doesn't have huge financial resources, this game deserves support. The game is 10$(!), and it is one of the best games I've tried in a long time. "
,NikolaTesla1,2013-03-30T20:29Z,Of course i respect that. But /:
,Synthixx,2013-03-31T00:36Z,"After i've unzipped and try to run the .exe I keep getting a ""data folder not found there should be Slender - The_arrival data folder next to the executable

I've done this with multiple torrents, everyone says it works fine. What gives?"
,92298,2013-03-31T01:17Z,It works! Too bad my computer is shit :P
,BluntzNzigzags,2013-03-31T06:21Z,"@Synthixx

your making this way more complicated than it is...just download, and install. no unzipping required. "
,Synthixx,2013-03-31T16:55Z,"@ bluntz, after the torrent is finished, and i clicked open directory, all i could see is one single file, which i have to unzip to get the rest. what am i doing wrong? the file wont do anything else otherwise."
,Synthixx,2013-03-31T17:02Z,"@ bluntz, i can't. After the download is finished its just a singular file in my directory, which i have to unzip to see anything. How am i suppose to ""just install"" ?"
,topries,2013-03-31T17:11Z,"@Synthixx

It's a .exe 
It will extract en install itself... you just have to click on it ( double click :P ) no need for crack or anuthing else... This was by far the easiest installation I  ever have done.. ? What is your OS ?? windows ?? mac ?"
,topries,2013-03-31T17:14Z,"Ohhh fuck this game, the ambience and sounds and enviroment is toooo scaryy. WTF man, i'm 18 years, and i just dont have the balls to play this game... just did a playthorug with my broterh, and we both scared the shit out of us. So we end watching youtube playrough of a verry funny guy. Respect for the developers!"
,Synthixx,2013-03-31T17:54Z,"@ topries when i open directory, t says ""slender the arrival v1.0 CRACKED"" and the file type just says ""File"" I double click said file, and it asks me which program i'd like to open it with. So from there I assumed it needed to be unzipped. when i unzipped it it gave me the files, but they wont run. I am on windows 7"
,Bluntbows,2013-03-31T18:58Z,"It was quite creepy until i got an achievement. 
Completely brought me out of the atmosphere. 

Good game though. Much better than the original."
,Bluntbows,2013-03-31T19:06Z,"@Synthixx 

Right click the ""file"" and open it with Java. 
That MAY work. "
,Synthixx,2013-03-31T19:30Z,"@ blunt, it didn't. I even reinstalled java to be sure"
,BluntzNzigzags,2013-04-01T05:13Z,"@Synthixx

i have windows 7 X64 . and all i had to do was right click on slender the arrival, open containing folder, than you should see the slender S, than just download, and play"
,Synthixx,2013-04-01T15:00Z,"@ bluntz, idk man, i right click to open and it just asks me what i want to open it with."
,marios29,2013-04-01T23:09Z,can  play this game with x box controller? thanks..
,s1d3k1ckro,2013-04-04T14:33Z,"It must be a bug... after collecting two pages, I always run in slendy, and I can't go to other places to search for the pages. And if I do, they won't spawn and slendy is a a hard on because he appears everywhere -.-'. It scared the shit outta me when I first seen him but  now it scares me just when I run directly in his face LOL xD Never lost the game, just exited by myself because I can't find the darn pages. I found 4."
,s1d3k1ckro,2013-04-04T15:28Z,"Beware of he without a face,

or you will suffer without a pace,

He will take you before you can yell,

Then he will drag you down to﻿ hell."

,zuxx666,2013-04-19T12:58Z,"I already installed the game.. and I haven't run into any glitch or anything yet.. very easy installation.. 

anyway.. anyone know where I can find the CONFIG file so I can (or is it possible to) change the resolution manually? because the framerate on my laptop sucks.. :("
,drd37r,2013-04-25T09:43Z,"Help pls! I am getting an error upon launching the game :
""Bad video card drivers!      
      -----------------------      

Minecraft was unable to start because it failed to find an accelerated OpenGL mode.
This can usually be fixed by updating the video card drivers.""

,pennknig,2013-04-28T02:42Z,^LOL^    Wrong post............
,Babality,2013-05-03T15:22Z,Ty a lot works 100 % !
,noobsc0uter,2013-05-04T05:29Z,"@pennking 
first i would put game on your main hdd (c:/) "
,BestCanuck,2013-05-06T03:26Z,"If possible, can someone post a version 1.2 update? I want to play the hidden level."
,ViolentC,2013-05-06T12:38Z,"Works fine. Install and play, just like a bought one.
Game play review : I ran round bored for 18mins and 37 seconds until I ran into some dude in a suit then the game asked me if I wanted to quit or retry. I chose Quit. 
There are no weapons as far as I can tell, I think you're just supposed to avoid the thing. IDK I quit from boredom "
,JBReno,2013-05-21T12:31Z,Has anyone had a problem with the game not going into full screen or everything displaying upside down? Am I doing something wrong?
,pennknig,2013-05-23T18:49Z,"@ 2noobsc0uter
NEVER, EVER, install a game, let alone a cracked game to c:/ or any partition of a HDD that c:/ is mounted on.
If you only have 1 drive, get an external drive and mount it there, the necessary config/profile/save/reg files will find their way to c:/ where they are needed.
If you have an SSD, this doesn't matter, wear levelling encodes data evenly on the chips, 'partitions' are only for organizational needs of the user."
,Josef27,2013-06-01T13:37Z,Anyone know the v1.3 version please? :(
,boazcstrike,2013-06-03T19:47Z,"publication type: pirates >>> yarr!! lol
