[V],mirrormaster82,2013-03-29T20:07Z,"Yep,great idea,could see this becoming very popular,can't believe nobody ( me included ) thought about this before.Great work STF."
,tdurden83,2013-03-29T21:25Z,sweet!! way to get your own weekly thingy STF
,scienceisthenewrocknroll,2013-03-30T00:00Z,I just signed up to personally thank YOU for all your uploads! I buy all (well most) of the issues but they only get shipped to me every 2 weeks so it's great to read these before the floppies arrive. O and great idea to post them all in one dl. Thanks again!
[T],MrDowntown,2013-03-30T01:30Z,YES. Thank You - Finally some IMAGE love :D When people ask Marvel or DC - I say Image!
,panzerkrieg,2013-03-30T01:36Z,"Fantastic idea - thank you, STFMaryville.  Hopefully, this will inspire others to break out their work into segments, thus reducing the urge to download everything under the sun when you're looking for only a fraction of it.  No snark intended here - this is an efficient and timely concept."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-30T01:55Z,"happy to hear it's a good idea.

image puts out some of my old favorites (savage dragon, twd) and great newer titles (chew, saga, revival, jupiter's legacy).

it isn't very hard to compile those from 0-day posts and add in all the lesser-known books each thursday or friday.

may god have mercy on my soul, i'll even include youngblood (if rob ever gets off his ass and publishes another issue)!"
,BatDingler,2013-03-30T05:02Z,good call on this collection
,Ahlat,2013-03-30T07:19Z,This is a great idea STFmaryville. It should be easier to collect my Image comics now. Thanks a bunch.
,PiratusLongus,2013-03-30T12:26Z,GREAT!! Can you also upload SPAWN :))
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-30T12:59Z,"if you mean this week, no because it didn't come out. if you mean when it does come out, yes but not if it isn't scanned before i compile the week! in that case it will be included whenever i get it, obviously."
,new52,2013-04-01T22:49Z,STFmaryville: Props on a great new collection!
