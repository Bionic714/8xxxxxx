                           -----System Shock 2-----

I found this on the internet and decided to re-upload since I cant find the link to the original torrent. All credit goes to whoever originally uploaded this! It plays great on my 2007 MacBook Pro, although it does have a few mouse-look problems. It has Rebirth Mod and Tacticool Weapon Replacement Mod installed. Niether of those mods change the gameplay, just makes it look nicer.

                         -----Install Instructions-----    

Open the .DMG and drag and drop the System Shock 2 Folder anywhere on your computer
