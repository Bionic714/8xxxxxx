Lost Worlds: Series 1
Dig into the sands of time with this exploration into lost civilizations. Scientists, archaeologists, and historians alike search for evidence of cities that may have forever been lost to time. Some are ancient while some are surprisingly recent. Journey back to Jerusalem when Christ walked through its streets. Explore the mysteries of the Knights Templar. See Egypt when Ramses ruled and discover what it looked like in Braveheart's Scotland. Recent cities include Winston Churchill's secret bunkers and a Welthauptstadt Germania that Hitler envisioned. Graphic recreations and location shots bring these cities to life.




13)  Churchills Secret Bunkers 
During World War II a vast complex of secret bunkers was constructed under the streets of London. This world, now lost to time, was once an important refuge from the nightly onslaught of Nazi air raids. This subterranean labyrinth kept the British government led by Prime Minister Winston Churchill safe through the darkest days of the war. This secret network also sheltered American General Dwight Eisenhower, but very little else has ever been revealed to the public. Now we head underground and bring this lost world back to life. We will use cutting edge computer graphic technology to peel back that layers and reveal a hidden city. Deep below the sidewalk, we will expose wartime secrets we were never meant to know
