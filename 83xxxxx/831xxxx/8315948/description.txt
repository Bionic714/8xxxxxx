Create dimensional effects with ingredients like oatmeal, sugar, and soy wax—mix and match 8 resists with 7 application techniques for endless possibilities. Paint, stamp, stencil, splatter, layer…and come away with soft, touchable fabric. Materials for non-toxic resists are easy to find, starting with your kitchen cupboards!
