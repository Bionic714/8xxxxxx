As a curious collector, Bruno has bought a fairly special music box from the queer owner of a sex-theatre. In this box which represents - on a reduced scale - the stage of the theatre, a minuscule stripper seems to be frozen in a lascivious posture. But when he opens up the music box, the puppet comes suddenly to life under Bruno's stunned eyes and engages in a frantic masturbation.
Soon the living puppet starts talking to him. Somewhat nymphomaniac, she recalls her life of pleasure with a libertine couple whose sexual habits and perverse erotic games were her education, until the day when the magic practices of the sex-theater owner turned them into puppets. She begs Bruno for help as he alone could deliver her from the spell...
