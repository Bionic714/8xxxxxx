,Sea.Wolf,2013-04-04T18:39Z,So .. what is your comment? That you couldn't be bothered to look at the files to see what they were? Title says they are DVD files and that is what they are.

,ozkr123,2013-05-08T04:08Z,"I still dont know the reason why to make a custom dvd wich is about 2 gb, when the original video file is only 700-800 mb."
,Ish_mael,2013-05-09T16:38Z,"Ok, with the greatest of respects NLUPPER002, this is a CAM, that has been converted to a standard DVD format, then copied completely to a file and uloaded to TPB.  So using cdburnerxp it can then be burnt back to DVD to watch as a shitty CAM, massive hassle for a crappy CAM that is over 2 Gig.....
