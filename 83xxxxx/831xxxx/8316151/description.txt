The Best of George Harrison is a 1976 compilation album by English musician George Harrison, released following the expiration of his EMI-affiliated Apple Records contract. Uniquely among all the four Beatles' solo releases, it mixes a selection of the artist's Beatles-era songs on one side, with later hits recorded under his own name on the other. The song selection caused some controversy, since it underplayed Harrison's solo achievements during the 1970ΓÇô75 period, for much of which he had been viewed as the most successful ex-Beatle, artistically and commercially. Music critics have also noted the compilation's failure to provide a faithful picture of Harrison's contribution to the Beatles' work, due to the omission of any of his Indian music compositions. In a calculated move by EMI and its American subsidiary, Capitol Records, the compilation was issued during the same month as Harrison's debut on his Warner-distributed Dark Horse label, Thirty Three & 1/3.
The Best of George Harrison peaked at number 31 on the US Billboard 200 chart and was certified gold by the RIAA in February 1977, but the album failed to chart in Britain. It is the first of three Harrison compilation albums, and was followed by 1989's Best of Dark Horse 1976ΓÇô1989 and the posthumous Let It Roll: Songs by George Harrison, in 2009. The album was issued on CD in 1990 featuring the cover artwork from the original British release, rather than the artwork created in-house by Capitol and used in the majority of territories internationally in 1976. The album has yet to be remastered since 1990. The Best of George Harrison remains the only official CD release to contain Harrison's 1971 charity single "Bangla Desh".
