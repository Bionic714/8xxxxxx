,pfslow,2013-04-06T21:49Z,"This version does not contain the presets. Here is how to fix:

1. Download the latest demo of Ozone 5 Advanced from Izotope and install. (it doesn't matter if you have installed this first but, if you haven't, don't)

2. Open Documents/Izotope. Drag or copy the Ozone 5 folder to your Desktop.

3. Open Library/Application Support/Izotope/ Ozone 5 folder. Find Uninstall iZotope Ozone 5 Advanced. Double-click to run the Uninstaller. It will say that not all folders were removed. This is ok.

4. Run the installer from this download.

5. Find the Ozone 5 folder you previously copied to your Desktop. Put it back into Documents/Izotope. If there is no Izotope Folder in Documents, create a new one first.

6. The presets will now be available.


The bad news: This version of Ozone Advanced 5.02 cannot be updated to 5.02B or 5.03 which includes Insight. Replacing the 5.02 components will cause the Demo screen to appear.

I have only tested this in Digital Performer 7, 8 and Logic 9 but it works great.

A similar version of 5.03 would be welcome but this will do for now."
