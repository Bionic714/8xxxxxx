,John_Ford,2013-03-31T11:19Z,"Thanks for the effort, BUT unfortunately this sounds worse than an mp3 version I have.  This sounds compressed dull on the edges and closed-in.  A lot of us can do ""24-96 vinyl rips"", but I for one don't have good enough vinyl playback to beat a CD or even a high rate MP3, so I don't do it."
[V],24.96,2013-03-31T20:36Z,"Thanks for the feedback.  I have to disagree, though.  I just downloaded an MP3 version and I cannot agree.  Maybe you could upload the versions you have that sound better, and share with the rest of us?"
,3X5,2013-04-22T12:04Z,The quality is undoubtedly awesome and special thanks for the artwork. :)
,sapo_joe,2013-04-23T23:39Z,"Could you please do the Born & Raised, and the Battlestudies album?

Also, I'd really like to have the Mark Knopfler's Get Lucky album!!

THANKS!"
