         ==========================================================



A Flash -based learning experience produced by Bruce Eckel

A Flash-based audio-visual seminar to introduce you to the fundamentals of the C language which will help you move on to C-based languages like C + +, Java and C #. This seminar was formerly delivered on the CD-ROM bound into the 2nd and 3rd editions of Thinking in Java, and the 2nd edition, Volume 1 of Thinking in C + +.

Although there are some bugs this is the final version.

The seminar should thus work on all Flash-supported platforms including Linux.

Unzip the file that you download and open the Index.html file in the main directory. That file should explain everything.
