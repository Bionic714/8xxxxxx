,cooper254,2013-05-25T04:55Z,"This is an epic fail do not download after much research after downloading this useless file this is what I found out, 1. This cannot be burned as an ISO, the file is to big, not even a dual layer 8.5 disc will do it so don't waste your time with that route.
2. I even bought a Ram disc capable of 9.5 gig's still wasn't enough as far as I know I found no where to buy DVD DL, ram or single layer's that will let you burn a file this big, so unless you do it with the thumb drive you are toast and wasted your time downloading if you thought you could burn this file as a whole hope this helps!"
