In the Start Menu you will find many tools to Edit, Tweak, Customize, Fix or Search anything you need in the System, the xDarkΓäó Power Tools compile everything you need to Customize your OS to the limits making it more personal than ever and even faster, giving you the option to edit system files and applications with just a single right click and supporting the full modification or creation of Windows 7 Styles with the Integration of 7 Style Builder.
