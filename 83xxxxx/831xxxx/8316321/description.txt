It's Good Friday and I'm contributing for the first time to the best website ever made, TPB.

This is a compilation of 101 of my favorite Electro/House tunes that I have collected over the past 3ish years.  There's something in here for everybody so please share and lets all get an electro-erection together.  And for the girls, you can get whatever girls get in place of an erection. ;) Happy listening folks.

Also, my apologies for the various bitrates, most of it is 320kbps but some are as low as 128.  Some of this music is extremely difficult to track down at any bitrate.  But hey, at least they're all full songs.

Cheers,
