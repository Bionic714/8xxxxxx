The zip file (Cell_Tracker_2013.zip) is the original file I downloaded from the website on payment.

I tried to use it on my Adroid, but it did not work. Even though the website claims that it will work on all phones, java softoware (.jar) files can not be run on android; instead android phones require .apk files.

The webiste claims you need to install the software on your phone and if you call the target phone at least for 30 seconds, your phone will get paired with the target phone and you can watch the SMS, Call log, etc of the target phone. But there is no guidence in the knowledge base, on how to do that.
