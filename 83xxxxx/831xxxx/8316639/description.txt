Just in case you don't have a synth in your pocket, here is a mp3 conversion of the 10 available midi files from Beck's website supporting his new sheet music collection entitled, "Song Reader".  This 20 song album was released as sheet music only, with no actual recordings from Beck himself.  He wants musicians to create their own versions and share with the world.
