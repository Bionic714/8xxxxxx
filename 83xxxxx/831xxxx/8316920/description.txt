Transformers Prime Beast Hunters - Season 3 - Episode 2 (HDTV - 720p - XviD)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Team Prime lives on Earth as a pre-emptive measure against the return of the
Decepticons. Autobot Central Command is located in a converted missile silo
in Nevada which was provided by the United States government, with whom the
Autobots have formed an alliance. However, the presence of Transformers on
Earth is not generally known among the civilian population. The Autobots have
taken three human teens under their protection after their association with
the Autobots put them in danger from the Decepticons.

Produced by Polygon Pictures and Hasbro Studios.

The Autobots search for signs of each other; the Decepticons welcome
someone new to their ranks; Wheeljack's win may lead to an Autobot defeat.
