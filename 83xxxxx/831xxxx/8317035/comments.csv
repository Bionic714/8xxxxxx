,emdeec,2013-03-31T00:42Z,SOOOO.. OOS I can't figure out whether it runs forward or backwards trying to sync it in VLC.. hopeless.
,floriduhh,2013-03-31T00:56Z,"The solution is delay the audio in VLC media player for 18.300s. Took me a few times--and you definitely have to slowly increase the delay of the audio until you reach 18.300s. Use the intro credits to do this.

It's a huge sync issue but this fix works until a proper comes out. 

I'm pretty sure the audio is cam audio and not line audio. Occasionally you hear coughing and some audience laughing. Other than that, the audio is pretty damn good.

Great movie-very suspenseful-gets your heart rate going."
