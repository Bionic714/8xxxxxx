,danhimself,2013-03-30T05:10Z,I'd love to see this with the one shots included in reading order
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-30T12:57Z,you know you could say thanks for what he/she did share with us.
,BSnapp,2013-03-30T14:08Z,"Couldn't have said it better, nor politer than you did STFMaryville. Not being a seeder, I will say this. People take the seeders/uploaders for granted. They just expect/assume that the books will be there. There are a few of us (not many) out here, that truly appreciate what is done, to get the books to the net in a quick manner...Cheers Faded2black, STFMaryville, and all the others that feed my/our addictions..It's truly appreciated..

You want a reading order?
Start with #1, and continue reading through #20
Doing so, in this order, will keep the story line from becoming confusing  ;)"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-30T15:16Z,"lol. in all seriousness, the problem with SO MANY modern comics are it's really hard to gather up all the spin-offs, mini-series and specials, much less figure out how they all fit together. that usually ends up as a ""best guess"" anyway.

not hating on you, danhimself, sorry if it seems that we are.

i just know i have actually given myself headaches when trying to collect comics to put together (see my attempt to update and re-release the complete darkness torrent). i would've rather punched myself in the face than tried to assemble a reading order.  :-)"
,danhimself,2013-03-30T16:41Z,did I say a single negative thing in my comment?  Did I imply that the uploader did something wrong?  Here's an idea:  Start with issue 1 and read that through straight up your ass.
,Faded2Black,2013-03-30T18:57Z,"i didn't include the one shots in my torrents because the existing torrent that covered 1-7 which can be found here: http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7068360/%5BRE-POST%5D_Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_TMNT_IDW_2011-2012 already had them.

To be honest having read all the one shots I don't think a proper read order is even necessary since stuff that happens in them has basically no real impact continuity-wise anyway"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-30T21:45Z,"is it possible to stick all 20 issues, in order, straight up his ass? and if so, what about the one-shots? where do they fit in?!?"
,nomad1980,2013-03-31T00:16Z,I prefer my one shots over some floppy breasts.
