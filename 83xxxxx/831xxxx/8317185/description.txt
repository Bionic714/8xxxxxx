SEEDBOX SUPPORTED!!

The Camera cuts to two brothers (Dagwood and Nigel) walking through the snowy 
northern Ontario wilderness. They have been lost for 3 days, have had no water 
or food. During the night one brother freezes to death. When morning comes, 
Dagwood attempts to wake his brother, there is no reaction, Nigel is dead. 
Dagwood tries to carry his brother's corpse out of the forest. He comes to his 
senses and understands his brother's fate, and what will be his as well, if he 
doesn't act. Dying of hunger he begins to eat his brother, Nigel. The curse of 
the Wendigo is visited upon him and Dagwood must crave human flesh for the rest 
of eternity. Now fast forward to a century later, six high school students 
decide to do a documentary / re-enactment of the Hayes brothers/Wendigo myth for 
their final film project. The six are polar opposites and have been put together 
as a group for the project by their teacher. The six leave for a weekend in 
Millcreek, Becca's mother's old town. After they arrive, almost immediately, 
they are fighting for their lives. Who's Who? What's What? Nothing is as it 
appears to be.

Be warned, this is some serious schlock horror made on a CA $10k budget.  The 
opening scene is supposed to be 1905, but I swear they are wearing modern jeans 
and footgear.  No matter.  You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll kiss 72 minutes 
goodbye!

Enjoy!
