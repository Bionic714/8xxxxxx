Skye collapses the morning after the
Cult fan party, suffering a serious
reaction to the drug she was
slipped. The doctors urge Jeff to
locate a sample of the drug so they
can find a way to reverse its
effects in order to save Skye's
life. Detective Sakelik arrives at
the hospital but refuses to help
Jeff suspects that the drug might be
hidden at her place so he takes
matters into his own hands
Meanwhile, inside Skye's
hallucinogenic state, Billy, Kelly
and Skye's father Quentin encourage
Skye to give up and stop searching
for the truth
