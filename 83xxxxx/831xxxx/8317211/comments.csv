,Mikkel32,2013-03-30T21:42Z,"The bitrate is perfect and so is this great rock- album! Thanks a lot, buddy :-) Good job."
,Mikkel32,2013-03-30T23:29Z,"There is something wrong, buddy. This is a 3 cd- complication, but when you play it on Windows Media Player, all songs shows like it is only one cd, instead of the 3 cd's.. Hope you follow me and please make it work correctly in the future, thanks :-)"

Don't use a third-rate media player?  There are plenty of free options far, far better than that POS."

WMP never sorts tracks according to discs mate, 
All the tracks have their disc names tagged and are grouped into different folders.
like SciBooks is saying use a different Player like Foobar, Winamp etc. :)"
