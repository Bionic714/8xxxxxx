,mrainss,2013-03-30T17:38Z,Can you get any of the elite 8 games? I would appreciate it more than you know.
[V],thetorrentlord,2013-03-31T16:26Z,Sorry no games.
,ulrich202,2013-04-01T09:09Z,"Nepotu has the OSU/Wichita State game uploaded.  Not sure about the other ones.

thetorrentlord: Thanks for all of your OSU sports and Dispatch torrents!  I'm interested in the entire Arizona game, if it's not too much trouble.  I'll seed for a while, too.  Or if you could tell me how to download it from march madness live (assuming that's how you got it?) that'd work too.  I tried the flash capture program you mentioned and it didn't work.  "
[V],thetorrentlord,2013-04-01T15:34Z,@ulrich202: I tried 5 different flash capture   software downloaders and none will grab the game. Have no idea how to get the stream. I can find nothing that will reveal the true URL of the stream. All it will grab are the commercials.
