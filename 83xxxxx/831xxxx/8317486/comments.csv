,krisf,2013-04-04T16:11Z,"Hi guys,

what i did to get it working on 2.05:

as previously mentioned, put all the data in the 
/JeppFD.app/DemoData folder.

terrain goes in terrain, jvm goes in jvm and make sure you don't use ""sub"" maps, so everything directly in the folder.
Once you open one map, 9example terrain) you can already see there are some files ther, delete those and search for the complete files in the downloaded cycle.
The only tricky part is the enroute databas, or the folder /JeppFD.app/DemoData/Enroute/Database
here you have to put the db1 and store folders coming out of the enr from this location:

Jeppview 1307 IPADJeppview 1307 IPADDocumentsappDataJDS EnrouteJeppesen Enroute2456359.08333Jeppesenenr

at least that is the one i used
When all done, respring ipad and you're good to go

If still not working let me know, i might have some more time on my hands too make a better tutorial, but i think this would be clear enough for  now...

btw, using itools, simply the best for exploring the ipad"

,lambda1,2013-04-08T19:16Z,"pasa001: those locked files are because your ipad is not jailbroken. You have to jailbreak it to get access to the root files like your folders inside your apps. If you have iOS version 6.1.2 or earlier you can, if you have 6.1.3 you can not jailbreak at the moment. But I have tried, and for me it works but not fully functional. No wx, a bit buggy enroue chart when you zoom in and no terrain. So the best option is v 2.0.0. The problem is that you can't go back to the previous version at the moment if you already updated."

Thank you that make sense. I was able to go back to 2.0.0 by not updating JeppFD in my Itune on my computer. I just deleted 2.0.5 and then installed 2.0.0 from my Itunes folder on my computer.

,krisf,2013-04-10T07:51Z,"@Budah76

haven't found out what all the other files and folders are for so far.
As for the ""1"" at the update icon,

i believe this is because jepp fd now uses 2 different settings. 1 is the real app once you register / buy it and the other one is the demo.
So I believe that the demo version will not update and the ""update"" will only look to the real registered folder to see if you have the latest database installed. 
Since we are completely bypassing this it will only see an empty folder and will ask to update, or better yet, buy / register.

In the 2.0 demo version we were working with the same database as we would be when it was registered so the program only had to cross check one database if it was the latest, now in 2.0.5 it checks if there is a database in the ""registered""folder, and then if it is current.

But this is just my thought on the subject, not a specialist so there is a reasonably large chance i'm wrong ;-)

Oh and since it was working with the few files i got, i let the rest of the files out of my ipad.

So far the only thing i found is that the ""brightness slider""in the app goes along the brightness slider of the ipad now.
But, as it probably should, it doesn't stay there when you exit the app, or switch to a different app. 


And on a completely different not,

i found the JeppFD 2.0.0 version is up on TPB now as well, for those wanting to go back to it, first one on the programs>ios(ipad) list"

,jortiz1704,2013-04-11T00:25Z,"I found a short-term solution for the TermCharts using cycle 1307 using the JeppTC, but there are not enroute charts, here is what i do:

1.Download cycle 1307

2. open the folder of the cycle and go to
documents: appdata, terminal charts, terminal charts  201307, copy the whole content of this folder and past it in a new folder, you need to name the folder ""TermCharts"".

3 using any software (ifunbox, iexplorer, itools etc) go to the JeppTC folder and open it.

4.go to Documents, data, delete all the files there, and copy the folder ""TermCharts"".

now its suposed to be working, just remember that is for term charts, so u are not gone have enroute charts, weather and all that stuff that is included in JeppFD, and lets pray for we can find a solution soon to new uddate of jeppFD."

,wb2lrs,2013-04-13T19:07Z,"
To use the JeppFD iPAD update 13.07 to update a JeppFD 2.06 iPAD installation, do the following steps:

FIRST: Update to version 2.06 if you have not already done so. If you have messed around earlier with the file structure, it would be best to delete, reboot, and do a clean install of 2.06, so you start from a known position.

SECOND: Unlock the iPAD so you see the iPAD desktop. Double-press the iPAD's home button.  At the bottom of the screen are displayed any running apps.  Find the JeppFD icon. If it's not there, it's not running. Proceed to THIRD.
Press and hold the JeppFD icon. A red minus sign (-) appears on the top left of the icon. Tap the minus sign to shut down JeppFD.  Press the home button again to return to the desktop view.  

THIRD: if you do not have iTools installed on your PC, get it and install it.  It does an excellent job of enabling examination AND MODIFICATION of the iPAD file structures (jailbroken or not).
Get it here:
http://itools.hk/multi_lang_pc_download.htm
It's Free! No ads (adverts) or other annoyances.

FOURTH: Place the Jeppview 1307 IPAD folder on your desktop and open it.

FIFTH: Open the Jeppview 1307 IPAD/Documents folder.
You should see the following list:
 appData
 data
plus a file called EnrouteFeatureSettings.plist.  

Having done these things, you're ready to begin. Remember, change nothing unless you are specifically directed to do so.
Note: Do not be concerned that you will not use all of the files and folders found in the update. Some of these are needed to keep track of a real subscription, and are not necessary in the DemoData folder.

1) Plug the iPAD into a USB port on the PC.

2) Start iTools.
iTools finds the iPAD, and displays the name of the iPAD on the left side of the window.

3) Select iPADname/Applications.
A list of the applications installed opens.

4) Locate JeppFD in the list.

5) Click on the blue circle (on the right) that shows a folder.
A new window opens with the folders associated with JeppFD. We will refer to this window as the iTools window.

6) Click on the Plus sign (+) on the left of JeppFD to expose the complete file structure.
You should see on the left
+ Documents
+ JEPPFD.app
+ Library
+ tmp.

Do NOT open JeppFD/Documents and try to install things there. It DOESN'T work. The program is designed not to look at anything in this location if a valid subscription serial number is not present.

7) Click on the + to expand the JeppFD/JeppFD.app folder.
You should see the following list of folders:
+ DemoData 
+ SC_Info
+ Settings.bundle
+ _CodeSignature 

8) Click on the + next to DemoData to expand the folder.
NOTE Leave the other files and folders listed in step 7 STRICTLY ALONE.
You will see the following list:
+ Enroute
+ Termcharts.

9) Click on the + next to Enroute.
The folder expands.

10) Click on the JeppFD.app/DemoData/Enroute/Database folder on the left.In the window on the right
you see  2 folders:
db1
store.

11) Delete the 2 folders
db1
store. 

  a) Select the two folders.
  b) Click on the blue circle that contains an X and confirm the deletion.
     The 2 folders are deleted.

12) in the 1307 IPAD update folder, open Jeppview 1307 IPADDocumentsappDataJDS EnrouteJeppesen Enroute2456359.08333Jeppesenenr
You see these 2 folders:
db1
store.

13) Drag these two folders into the JeppFD/jeppFD.app/DemoData/Enroute/Database folder, replacing the folders deleted in step 11.

14) In the iTools window, navigate to the JeppFD/Jeppfd.app/DemoData/Enroute/JVM folder.

15) Delete the files in this folder.

16)  in the iPAD update folder, open Jeppview 1307 IPADDocumentsappDataCulturalWW201108JVM.

17) Drag the files in step 16 to JeppFD/JeppFD.app/DemoData/Enroute/JVM in the iTools window.

18) in the iTools window, click on JeppFD/Jeppfd.app/DemoData/Enroute/Terrain.

19) Delete the contents of the folder in step 18.

20) In the 1307 IPAD update folder, open Jeppview 1307 IPADDocumentsappDataTerrainWW2456190.75MobileFDTerrain

21) Drag the files from step 20 into the now empty folder from step 19.
Be sure to get all of them!"

Here's what was missing:

22) In the iTools window, click on JeppFD/JeppFD.app/DemoData/Enroute/TermCharts.
The terminal charts files are displayed.

23) Delete all the files from the folder in step 22.

24) in the iPAD 1307 update folder, open Jeppview 1307 IPADDocumentsappDataTerminal ChartsTerminal Charts201307.1.
The files for updating the charts are displayed.

25) Copy the all the files from step 24 into the TermCharts folder in the iTools window.
Be sure to get them all!

You're done with the charts update!  Optionally, if you wish to have the Jeppesen manuals on the iPAD (why not?), proceed as follows:

1) Close the JeppFD window for iTools.

2) Ensure that iBooks is installed on the iPad.  If not, go to the App Store and install it.

3) In the iTools menu on the left side of the window, open iPADname/iBooks.
NOTE: There is also a view of the iBooks app inside iPadname/Applications. This is NOT THE CORRECT FOLDER!

4) If there are any old manuals displayed, select them and press the blue circle with an X in it (at the top of the window). The files are deleted.
NOTE: if the X circle is greyed out, you need to select 1 or more files first.

5) in the Jeppview 1307 IPAD update folder, open Jeppview 1307 IPAD/Documents/data/airway_manuals.

6) Drag the files from this directory into the iTools window iPADname/iBooks.

7) On the iPad, open the iBooks app and verify that the Jepp publications are visible. 

This completes the updates.  Optionally, if you also want the Enroute Notices, you can copy those into iBooks also. The update files are in Jeppview 1307 IPADDocumentsappDataECNPDFJeppesen PDF Enroute2456378.75

Now, Close iTools, open JeppFD on the iPad, tap Demo if asked, agree to the Terms and Conditions, if asked/  Then verify:

1) The enroute chart displays world wide routes and airports, and
2) The world's terminal charts are available.
3) Weather should also work when connected to WiFi.  Sometimes, certain components don't complete loading.

Yes? You're good to go!  No enroute data?
1) Zoom in.  If you are zoomed out too far, the data are not viewable.
2) You have probably made a mistake.  The instructions are pretty complicated.
Deinstall and reinstall FD 2.06, and try again, following each step carefully.

I have installed the 1307 update on an iPad 2 to develop these instructions, then validated them by installing the update on an iPad 3, following the instructions exactly.  Both worked. The IPad 1 is not recommended for version 2.06, and, indeed, doesn't work very well with version 2.0. It just doesn't have the hardware resources. The IPad 2 and newer should work OK.

For future updates, the files should be in the same places in the update, and go into the same places in the DemoData folder.  Some of the numbered folders in the update may have different numbers.  We'll see!"
,wb2lrs,2013-04-14T01:06Z,"daniel_mteixeira :
If files are in use and cannot be deleted, this means that JeppFD is still running. Go back to SECOND in the instructions and shut down JeppFD.  Then try again.  You may need to disconnect, then reconnect the iPad to iTools, so iTools has an update view of everything..."

Since we learned that running the version 2.06 in Demo mode the Documents folder is not searched for files, the files content in there can be deleted in order to save over 1 gig of memory.
Otherwise your JeppFD will uselessly consume a lot of memory.

,wb2lrs,2013-04-15T18:21Z,"So there must be an anomaly in the ru.tracker 1308 update. Haven't tried it, yet, because of effectivity."
,flyedal,2013-04-16T10:49Z,"okay, found a workaround for that ""Chart not in library"" error!
I used airports.dbf & charts.dbf from 1307, and created a new airportlist.bin file with jepp.exe!
Works fine for me, no more errors, got all the correct charts in the right place!
However the effectivity issue still ISNT solved! :("
,rafikihd,2013-04-16T14:23Z,"@flyedal
Did u managed to manipulate the files?"
,flyedal,2013-04-16T15:04Z,"no, i did it on v2.0.0!
Sorry for confusion! ;)"

,flyedal,2013-04-18T07:32Z,"Rutracker org released another 1308 cycle!
Works perfect on JeppFD 2.0.0! (iOS 6.1.3)
No Chart library issues,
No Eff date issues!

Find&load the JeppFD 2.0.0 ipa here and replace your 2.0.6 file in the itunes folder!
Delete 2.0.6 on the iPad, reinstall (v.2.0.0) via iTunes!
Then you should be back to ""normal""!

PS: Maybe you have to ""refind"" the file in itunes!"
,Sky.Skipper,2013-04-18T11:35Z,"Dear flyedal,

Would you please upload the (1308) version which you could successfully use, or put the usable link for download as most of us could not work with rutracker as it's in russian.  TNX"

,JAB69,2013-04-20T17:05Z,"Apple made some changes in iOS 6 where the .app (dot app) folder within an app directory is read-only and cannot be modified or written to, there is still read/write access in any other app subdirectory such as Documents or Library, same as in previous iOS versions. All iOS transfer utility software will have the same limitation with iOS 6, and jailbreaking the device is the only way around this currently. Try: http://evasi0n.com"
,wingcpt777,2013-04-22T05:03Z,"HI Guys thanks for the great work. My first time in the forum and I have had my Jepp FD up and running on V2.0.6 and 1307 with out too much probs.
Just need one more info, I cant seem to get my enroute chart to display the Atc frequencies? Got airports Fir boudaries etc but no freqs?
Thanks"
,precursor1188,2013-04-23T03:42Z,"@wingcpt777
zoom in. long touch on the fir boundary or airport runways. a popup will appear. select the appropriate area control. you will see a communication option. suggest you go to jepp site and check out some tutorials."
,daniel_mteixeira,2013-04-27T17:21Z,"Folks,

I really wasn't able to erase some files on version 2.0.6, even trying all the tips written here...

Meanwhile, i downloaded JeppTC to use the latest database... I don't have route, weather, night theme and other advantages of Jepp FD, but at least i have worldwide charts...

It's horrible, but works...

Seems that i'll be forced to JB my ipad ...."
