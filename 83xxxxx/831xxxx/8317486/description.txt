Hey; the pilots and aviators. I had updated to JeppFD 2.0.5. The folder structure in the IPAD for JeppFD2.0.5 has changed. The folder named Documents seems to have the required data and is hereby uploaded. I don't know if this works. Please comment. And will someone upload Jeppview update 1307 for PC ??. Those Russians are good at it as far as I know ??
