Thanks so much for the torrent!
I have a request, I know it might seem very strange, but if you will help me, I shall be mroe than grateful.
I'm blind, and need so much the 5.1 ac3 audio files of the DVDS (Since they make it much easier for me to follow the stories).
If it isn't too much, please do contact me and I shall show you how to do it.
My E-Mail address is:

Yours,
M."
