I would like to have seen the subs for foreign languages hard coded. The subs are either in English or Swedish and you have to watch the whole movie with subs.
For movies that have mixed languages, the foreign languages should be hard coded."

Foreign language subs are not coded. So you have to watch the whole movie with subs."
