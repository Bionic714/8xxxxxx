A sum of it's creators' ascent to this moment, 'Absolute Zero' is a bewitching set of songs; ruthlessly truthful in their narratives and breathtakingly beautiful in their musical composition. As equally epic as they are intimate, the tracks act as a soul bearing report on the act of growing up.

"This record constantly jumps between two contrasting perspectives: the beauty of a reckless youth and the fear and confusion caused by our ever-pending adulthood," says lead-singer Stevie Appleby.

"It's a hopeful and na√Øve look at love and life in general but also deals with isolation, unrequited love and madness. We wanted to express both a feeling of strength and vulnerability, so the work had to encompass both the light and dark."

The album is produced by critically lauded producer Markus Dravs who's credits include Arcade Fire's 'Neon Bible' and 'The Suburbs', Coldplay's 'Mylo Xyloto' and Mumford and Son's 'Sigh No More' and 'Babel'.
