If you love the more mellow, heart-felt songs from the Avett Brothers, this will quickly become one of your favorite albums.

This album is full of stories -- songs that are from the heart. Reality told from the perspective of an Avett.

It's simply fantastic. Nothing too fancy -- just stories about life and love, held together by sounds crafted by a great musician.
