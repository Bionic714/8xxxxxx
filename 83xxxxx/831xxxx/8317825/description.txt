Entire run of the original doctor portrayed by William Hartnell, 134 episodes of which 43 are reconstructions and 2 are animations. 

I was able to get the Lost in Time box set, so the episodes from these partially missing serials are my own DVD rips:
The Crusade (Parts 1 and 3), The Daleks' Master Plan (Parts 2,5 and 10), The Celestial Toymaker (Part 4). 

All the DVD rips have the following specs:
Video: Container - MKV, Codec - h264 @ 872 kbps, Resolution - 640x480 (4:3 aspect ratio)
Audio: AAC @ 128 kbps

Some of the serials were taken from this torrent: 
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6699564/Doctor_Who_1963-198
That torrent has episodes taken from an Australian broadcast, i reencoded the files to reduce the size from the original 350 megabytes to around 175. 

Most of the reconstructions are created by Loose Cannon (uploaded by ElDoctorio), these have a resolution of 640x480 with clean soundtracks with the exception of the few that I've listed below.
