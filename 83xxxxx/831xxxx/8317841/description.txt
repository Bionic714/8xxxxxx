ItΓÇÖs taken about seven years, but Ben MarwoodΓÇÖs first proper full length has finally surfaced. The, Reading-born, singer/songwriter/folk hero has garnered quite a lot of attention whilst paying his dues in LondonΓÇÖs thriving folk scene. After the release of This Is Not What You Had Planned - a seven-track ΓÇÿmini albumΓÇÖ ΓÇô and a split with Jim Lockey and Oxygen Thief, many are anticipating the arrival of BenΓÇÖs first proper album.

MarwoodΓÇÖs, often self deprecating, tales of life, love and loss tug on the heart strings and will resonate with almost everyone that listens. Combining the banal and macabre with fantastic turns of phrase, itΓÇÖs clear, that Ben is doing this because he loves to do it. At the same, time he proves that the art of songwriting is far from dead, ΓÇ£IΓÇÖll play until my fingers hurt and grit my teeth trough every word, like IΓÇÖm the only introvert who wants to seize the day,ΓÇ¥ being a prime example.
