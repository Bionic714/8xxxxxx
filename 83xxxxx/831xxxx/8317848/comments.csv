@mcmig Thanks for the heads up!

For all those getting the trial version area make sure you placed the exdata file in the right folder.If you dont have the exdata folder, create it."

,Sublime90,2013-03-30T23:02Z,"Put the Edat file in

Use multimans file manager to do this."

I do it all as it says, but when I enter the game it shows up just black screen and i have to restart my ps3 !!!
Please help !!! :D"
,Sublime90,2013-03-31T22:33Z,@damirbre what CFW are you using?
,Sublime90,2013-03-31T22:38Z,"1. Put the files on a usb drive or ftp it to your ps3
2. Install Terraria.pkg file via ""Install Packages""
3. Install the update according to which firmware you have by using install packages again and click on the update.
4. Copy files from folder ""exdata"" to/ dev_hdd0/home/00000001/exdata / Using multimans file mangager or FTP (The folder '00000001' is your user profile id. If you have only one profile - that is the only folder you'll see under /home/
In case you have multiple profiles, copy the *.edat file to the one that you will be playing the game from.
If the folder 'exdata' is not present, create it  and put .edat file in it
5. Play."
