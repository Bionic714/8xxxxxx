Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card

Format: mobi

Synopsis:


In the near future, a hostile alien race (called the Formics) have attacked Earth. If

not for the legendary heroics of International Fleet Commander Mazer Rackham, all 

would have been lost. In preparation for the next attack, the highly esteemed Colonel 

Graff and the International Military are training only the best young children to 

find the future Mazer. Ender Wiggin, a shy but strategically brilliant boy, is pulled 

out of his school to join the elite.


Arriving at Battle School, Ender quickly and easily masters increasingly difficult 

war games, distinguishing himself and winning respect amongst his peers. Ender is 

soon ordained by Graff as the military's next great hope, resulting in his promotion 

to Command School. Once there, he's trained by Mazer Rackham himself to lead his 

fellow soldiers into an epic battle that will determine the future of Earth and save 

the human race.
