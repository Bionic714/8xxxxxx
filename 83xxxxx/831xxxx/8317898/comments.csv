,ectoendomezo,2013-04-05T15:29Z,"One of THE Greatest Films EVER Made!

Period!

And frankly? Its Happening Again.

No Joke actually..look around..we are experiencing the attack of our collective ID and its magnified presence via the web etc.. Fear and Rage and Revenge and Resentment Politics magnified a million-fold..

Anyway..anyone want to do ""Shakes The Clown""? Which currently Does Not Exist as a Torrent on TPB and is a Glaring Omission.

Thanks for this..truly..my current copy is 700mg so Graci!"

""Shakes The Clown"" does exist as a Torrent on TPB. Not in HD, mind you, but as a DVDRip 352p.
