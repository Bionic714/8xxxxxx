This show is probably only for hard core fans. My recorder died at some point and I missed the tail and Into "The Spin" and "The Chaconne", and there was a ton of talkers around me. This is not a show I'd recommend to a casual fan, but I try to share anything I feel someone would appreciate, and I'm sure some dedicated fans would appreciate this.
