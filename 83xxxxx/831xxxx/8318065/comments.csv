,sonans,2013-03-30T11:09Z,"Can you please rip the movie Gabi on the Roof in July? 

 It's available on Netflix."
,gUsttav__,2013-03-30T15:00Z,"stop spamming everybody. thanks for the movie, but i think i will wait for dvdrip"
,stiks252,2013-03-30T23:27Z,@deronjo345 get that fake b.s. out of here. Go try your gimmicks somewhere else. 
,christinaxolove,2013-03-31T00:14Z,"Thanks for the upload, but this just isn't watchable. Too quiet and video quality makes it impossible to even see what's going on half the time in the movie itself.

A - 3
V - 4

Plus a 3 min gap and the last 15min of video missing? I think I'll wait for a better copy."
,Drizzle99,2013-03-31T00:22Z,"Moebanzor, do you still have Hatufim Season 2 720p files? (per this -  http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7445263/Prisoners_of_War_(Hatufim)_S01_E10_-_Xvid_-_Hardcoded_Subs_-_Sno )

If yes, pleeeease upload them! A ton of us are eagerly waiting  :)"
,EnemyDrone,2013-03-31T04:07Z,Stupid fucking mkv file.
,lockhartorama,2013-04-01T01:02Z,It's bad enough when they put fake torrents up. Now the assholes have to spam the comments section of legit ones with their fake shit as well. Fuck off idiots.
,justin_w,2013-04-01T02:39Z,"All seemed pretty good; the video would be great for someone who really really wanted to see the movie, like me. But the last 15 mins of the movie has no video and only sound, just to let people know."
,nox1n,2013-04-01T07:31Z,Why is everyone bitching in the comments when the uploader clearly states that it is NOT a good copy
,lockhartorama,2013-04-01T11:38Z,"Hey, beoreg456, looks like we found our April Fool. You."
[T],moebanzor,2013-04-01T17:08Z,"Hello Everyone. I have since had someone contact me who cammed the last 15 minutes of the movie. I will edit that video and combine it with mine, and then make a release pretty soon."
,lockhartorama,2013-04-02T01:04Z,Thanks in advance moebanzor. Appreciate it.
,restrepoo,2013-04-02T02:57Z,its like watching a 240p movie plus those 15 minutes of blindness. i recomend not downloading this and wait for a better upload 
,christinaxolove,2013-04-09T21:27Z,Can someone please upload a GOOD quality video/sound of this movie?? PLEASE! 
,09pdean,2013-04-21T05:39Z,Can someone please upload a good copy of this god I really want to masterbate to Vanessa hudgens. jesus if I had a nickel for every pixel in this video id have 50 cents.
,ogstankyfluff,2013-04-24T02:50Z,@Enemydrone. dont be an illiterate retard and complain about mkv when you can do a simple google search to find out how to play them. idiot.
,themashedavenger,2013-05-05T03:41Z,"very sad and contradictory description...  
ur recommending i go watch it in a cinema?
why waste your and everyone elses time then?"
,Fawkes35,2013-05-08T06:10Z,I understand when downloading a cam recording that your forfeiting quality but yikes was this bad! Not worth downloading either wait till a DVDrip is uploaded or just go pay to see it.
,Fawkes35,2013-05-08T06:23Z,"@nox1n People are bitching because not a good copy was an understatement, this was fucking diarrhea!  Had it said really shitty quality perhaps people would be less inclined to bitch."
,iamlaze,2013-05-16T08:30Z,idiots don't know what klite codec pack or vlc player is. lmfao
,iamlaze,2013-05-16T08:31Z,"Same copy with the last 15 minutes.
