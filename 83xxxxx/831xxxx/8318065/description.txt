           Desc: Four college girls who land in jail after 
           robbing a restaurant in order to fund their spring 
           break vacation find themselves bailed out by a drug 
           and arms dealer who wants them to do some dirty work.

           Notes: It's a CAM, so you know what to expect. Video is
           on par with the average cam, and audio is a little 
           above average. The audio is a little bit quiet, so 
           turn up  your volume. Be aware that the film has a lot
           of funky colors in it, so any unrealistic colors you 
           see, aren't just related to this rip.

           There are a few minutes where the video goes
           black throughout when the camera had to be hidden from 
           ushers. Also, unfortunately due to technical issues the 
           video from the last 15 minutes is not available. The 
           audio is still there, though. We'd suggest you either
           listen the ending, or maybe even watch it theaters. We 
           would also be appreciative of any individual or group 
           who would go into the theater to CAM the last 15 
           minutes, and would be happy to do a rerender from our 
           master with the additional minutes added back in.
