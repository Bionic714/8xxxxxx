now lets do this step by step:

1)Go to www.battle.net and create a new free b.net account if you dont have.(make sure you use a valid email because Blizzard sends you a mail for verification)

2)Download and install StarCraft II Starter Edition (European EN-GB or else known as EN-EU).(from Blizzard official site no other crack bullshit version)


3)Let the game update to the latest patch version.(thre are no more offline patches so just wait! let it update)


Now you can choose:

the easy ""automatic way
The easy Way is to use this loader we provide (developed by Snify)
to allow you offline play with a single click!
----------------------------------------------
If you want to have a clean install of SCII use this method,and this loader i provided here,loader by Sniffy and clear instructions by Vernam7 of sc2.nibbits.com"
,niels13,2013-03-30T11:57Z,"I still am getting the ""Starter edition cannot play offline"" error. 

I've done many fresh new installs. Cleaned the register, used this ""start over"" button, removed registry and files/folders manualy, cleaned my whole pc from anything battle.net, blizzard and starcraft related. 

I used the flt crack, I used Sniffy's loader. 

What can I do to fix this error? A lot of people are getting it. I've read something blaming amd chips. My CPU is intel, but my GPU is AMD. 

Any tips or help?"
,M.Mahad,2013-03-30T12:26Z,hey does this work with the FLT and blackecho torents plz answer
,Liman_Bot,2013-03-30T12:45Z,"Niels13 i advise you to try Revo uninstaller Pro clean all leftover files and try again if you are willing,but it's mostly that it's a problem cause of your AMD gpu,verna7 said that he's working on his own keygen but that'll take weeks or months,i have an i5 and it's working perfectly for me :/ ""the start over"" button should've fixed your problems.
@M.Mahad i don't know about that but i guess it'll work just as fine,i dl'ed my copy from their website. "
,Liman_Bot,2013-03-30T12:47Z,Be sure to run the tool as an administrator!
,Liman_Bot,2013-03-30T13:03Z,Oh and make sure your antivirus isn't blocking the tool :P
,SaadZulfiqar,2013-03-30T21:50Z,"Please Help me :( 
it says ""Starter edition cannot play offline""
....
I really want to play Hots and skirmish :( 
I did what it is said in verman's post, and used snify loader"
,Liman_Bot,2013-03-30T22:33Z,"If you don't have an AMD Gpu or cpu,click start over and the steps from the beginning."
,BrutalosGR,2013-03-31T01:53Z,Now all that AMD gpu or cpu thing isnt racism against that hardworking company or whaaaaaaaat?!
,Liman_Bot,2013-04-01T15:32Z,"Hey niels,sorrys for the late re-reply but i found a way to fix that :P,first you download the clean sc2 install,download the complete game,login with your b.net account and hang in there for 2 mins or so,then exit the game launch up sniffy's loader click start over,generate license,and play offline log-in and it'll work,i hade the same problem and this how i fixed it. :P"
,katy1118,2013-04-02T04:05Z,"Says I can't play offline w/o validating acct and having at least 1 character. Also have been unable to play via ANY version of the FLT crack as well. DO NOT have an AMD cpu. Have completely removed all versions of SCII including manual removal via regedit and reinstalled, still have the same issue."
,Sinister181,2013-04-05T09:19Z,This is genius. Works with Starcraft II: Wings of Liberty and Heart of the Swarm 100%. Including the extras. Thanks so much for this - much appreciated.
