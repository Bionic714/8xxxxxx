[V],dohduhdah,2013-03-30T11:46Z,"This comes from rutracker DOT org. dunno if more shutterstock pics will be uploaded there in the future, but in total there are now 3 big shutterstock torrents I've uploaded here (200 gb in total)."
,mac.the.ripper,2013-03-31T23:39Z,Password protected files....I pass...
[V],dohduhdah,2013-04-01T05:58Z,Obviously there is no password required for the rar files. 
,mac.the.ripper,2013-04-01T17:12Z,"@dohduhdah

Click on rar for textures/engineering brings up request for password. 
Something is not obvious obvviously correct or may be you can explain this.
The other shutterstock uploads from you was great. Thanks for sharing."

[V],dohduhdah,2013-04-10T05:41Z,"@mac.the.ripper: You shouldn't be opening those rar files anyway until your download has completed (and that's unlikely, since I'm still uploading and I'm the only seeder)."
,mac.the.ripper,2013-04-11T05:44Z,"You are right, dohduhah.

I am sorry for my comments. I forgot that I can´t use my default unrar. Your files open excellent with good old unrarX.

Thx for sharing."
,superlike,2013-04-12T00:09Z,"your shares have always been my pleasure.

I have nothing else to say than these words and

"" Thank You "" .

I just need that one image, please.
Thanks a lot!"
[V],dohduhdah,2013-04-16T20:50Z,"@red4ever:
I don't think it's in there. But you can check for yourself at rutracker, it has all the filenames and contactsheets."
