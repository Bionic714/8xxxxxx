Chasing Mummies with Dr. Zahi Hawass
Digging up ancient treasures is dirty and dangerous business, and nobody knows that better than the legendary Egyptologist Dr. Zahi Hawass. History's cameras follow closely as he and his cadre of fellows unearth astonishing finds and tackle some of the world's greatest archaeological riddles, from who built the pyramids to the location of Cleopatra's tomb. It's a whirlwind tour, led by the man who holds the keys to Egypt's greatest antiquities and rules his world like a modern-day pharaoh. Unfiltered, entertaining, exciting and suspenseful, "Chasing Mummies" lets viewers share in the thrills and hardships facing the team and crew as they toil to reveal what lies beneath the sand. With its wealth of historical information and blow-by-blow coverage of world-altering discoveries, this series breaks new ground-literally.




8)  Bats 
First aired: Sep/01/2010
It's time for Leslie, the Executive Producer, to do Zahi a favor, and it requires going where few cameras have been before -- to the mysterious caves below the Giza Plateau. Zahi is determined to disprove the theories of the so-called "pyramidiots," who believe that there are secret underground chambers leading to the Sphinx. Little did anyone know that these caves were home to thousands of bats! If that wasn't enough for Zahi, he's also agreed to make an appearance at a local wedding celebration and as viewers have learned, Zahi's likes to celebrate the dead...not the living!
