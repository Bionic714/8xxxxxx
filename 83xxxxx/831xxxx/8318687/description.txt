Chasing Mummies with Dr. Zahi Hawass
Digging up ancient treasures is dirty and dangerous business, and nobody knows that better than the legendary Egyptologist Dr. Zahi Hawass. History's cameras follow closely as he and his cadre of fellows unearth astonishing finds and tackle some of the world's greatest archaeological riddles, from who built the pyramids to the location of Cleopatra's tomb. It's a whirlwind tour, led by the man who holds the keys to Egypt's greatest antiquities and rules his world like a modern-day pharaoh. Unfiltered, entertaining, exciting and suspenseful, "Chasing Mummies" lets viewers share in the thrills and hardships facing the team and crew as they toil to reveal what lies beneath the sand. With its wealth of historical information and blow-by-blow coverage of world-altering discoveries, this series breaks new ground-literally.

Having the chance of a lifetime to follow Dr. Zahi Hawass and witness so many new discoveries in this magical land of Egypt is an exceptional experience for anyone who can actually keep up with him! Just ask his truly-devoted archaeological workers, who've named a brand new tomb complex in Luxor after their dynamic boss: Z-1, or "Zahi"-1. So what's more fitting than going deep underground to discover five intact burials--even a murdered mummy--to complete this amazing adventure with Zahi Hawass!
