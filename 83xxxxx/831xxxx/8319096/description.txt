Information
------------------------------

The American Wild West has proved a fertile ground for stories of heroism and triumph over adversity. It was a time of notorious outlaws, gunfighters turned sheriffs and frontier justice.
From the most famous outlaw of them all, Billy The Kid, the rock star General Custer, and the vengeful lawman Wyatt Earp, audiences have been captivated by these legends. But what of the men behind the myths - and the truth? Blending dramatic recreations with the latest archaeological, forensic and ballistic research, this three-part series brings the truth to light.




3)  The Gunfight at the O K Corral 
The gunfight at the OK Corral was the classic Western shoot-out. It eventually turned one man into a great American hero and a symbol of the nation. His name was Wyatt Earp. But after the smoke cleared on that fateful day in Tombstone in the autumn of 1881 with Tom McLaury, his brother Frank and Billy Clanton lying dead in the dusty street, Wyatt Earp wasn't seen as a hero but a villain. The legendary lawman was arrested and put on trial for murder. And the prosecution were so sure of victory that they pushed for the ultimate penalty - death. The resulting court case was one of the most dramatic in American history and its outcome helped shape the nation.
Ironically, the trial spared Wyatt's life, but the law was not able to protect his brothers, gunned down in the following year by the McLaury clan. So in a final bloody climax, Wyatt abandoned his badge, and hunted down and killed the killers.
This film recreates what happened in the 30 seconds of mayhem at the OK Corral, and the burning resentment of the 24 hours that led up to it. Drama - based on court records, letters and press reports - recreates the fevered sense of excitement, punctuated by expert testimony and detailed ballistic testing. If any single episode of history can be said to embody the Wild West, it is this: the true story of the Gunfight at the OK Corral.
