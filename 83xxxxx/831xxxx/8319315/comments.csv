A very frustrating series to follow with all the delays and such.  Was pleasantly surprised that Ellis finally completed what he started - given some of his recent series that he didn't complete.

Do you know if this torrent also includes that Planetary preview that appeared in two other Wildstorm titles?"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-30T15:05Z,"it doesn't. i debated (inside my head) whether or not to put the preview, sometimes incorrectly called #0, in here... but because this is an HD set from Zone, i left that out. that's also why i didn't call this complete.

you can still find it, as well as two other .CBZs of trade paperback extras, here: http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/5118734/"
