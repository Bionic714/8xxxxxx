Is there any chance of re-seeding the complete vols. of Marvel Fanfare and the Razor torrents?"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-03-31T05:32Z,"it seems like it's still very popular in its niche.

coincidentally, i found a great london night torrent the other day (including razor). if i clear enough hard drive space and finish grabbing it all, i may re-up it here.

marvel fanfare, hmmm maybe! good book, back in the day.

but for now, i worked an 11.5 hour shift today, and i have to get up at 6am, and so i'm going to bed.  ;-)"
,wetbeak,2013-03-31T11:08Z,"wow, so its good huh, would be totally unaware of its existence if it weren't for TPB and you guys, cheers.will look out for this in the future."
,wetbeak,2013-03-31T11:14Z,"hey, get some rest man. shit is so expensive these days, will work public holidays over easter instead of hangin' with the fam, to pay for power, water, food etc.. i guess budget for for this years entertainment is limited,,, thank you for your efforts."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-01T02:09Z,"i like working weekends, mainly because i can have wednesdays off. how sad it is that i prioritize my trip to the comic shop! (and my virtual trips to TPB!)"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-02T00:52Z,"binderguy1, just an update if you happen to read this. i've downloaded about 1/3 of marvel fanfare and most of the london night torrent that i'm going to re-up here. they might be up tomorrow morning!"
