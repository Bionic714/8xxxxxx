I got the box at c:windowssystem 32cmd.exe telling me The system cannot find the path specified"". And when I click 'ok' on your message box I get ""The application was unable to start correctly (0xc000007b). Click ok to close the application.""

Any ideas? Are you sure the file pointed to in the launcher (del ""%userprofile%AppDataLocalSASJMP10JMP.PFS"" /s) is the correct one?"

i myself use it in virtual 32 bit XP....but i feel its worth it..."
,SaMeep104,2013-04-13T08:03Z,"during installation in 64 bit system, select 32bit and deselect 64 bit and then install...it will work..."

,GhostVoterA,2013-05-13T23:48Z,"Trying to install in Windows Vista Home Premium Service Pack 2.

Will not install. 

Also will not install when I go to Properties and set it to run as compatible with Windows XP service pack 2.

Also will not install when I run as compatible with Windows 95. 

Always the same error:  ""Not compatible with the version of Windows I am running -- check to see if I need 32 bit. ""

Any suggestions besides partition and separate xp boot?   Would it work just to install the regular JMP and then install the crack and the launcher?"

Any suggestions please?"
