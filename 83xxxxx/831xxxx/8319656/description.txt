The Long Ryders - Native Sons (1984)

Stephen McCarthy (vocals, various instruments)
Sid Griffin (guitar, autoharp, harmonica, background vocals)
Tom Stevens (bass, background vocals)
Greg Sowders (drums, percussion)

The Long Ryders' 1984 full-length debut is one of the defining albums of the mid-'80s roots-rock scene, a loose amalgamation of bands reacting against the MTV-ready crop of synth-pop superstars by playing guitar-heavy country-influenced rock and roll. 

Heavily influenced by Gram Parsons and the Buffalo Springfield, singer/songwriter Sid Griffin and crew mix the '60s revivalism of the then-current Paisley Underground scene with a fondness for mandolins and other bluegrass instruments which would be further explored by the alt-country groups of the '90s.
