Sucks."
,Halloweenpsycho,2013-03-30T20:38Z,"@karty
Sorry to have pissed in your bed. Let me explain. I put this here for people that need a quick activation when the serials i have provided are used uped. This will Activate windows, or as you say ""Hacktivate"" it for those in need of a quick fix, as i prepare new keys. So simply said...If you got something you have produced then by all means provide it. And not the simple kms Emulation crap. Good day Mate."

But I came across some issues. After runniing the app it goes to blue screen but nothing happens. It stays at the blues screen for ages and doesn't reboot. Did I miss something or is something amiss? Thanks!!"

,Muhr,2013-04-01T18:01Z,"Hey HP, I couldn't get help on the actual Win 8 torrent so I just wanted to try my luck over here.

All the metro apps are graphically messed up, I'm using your Windows 8 64bit activated with Windows toolkit ( http://forums.mydigitallife.info/threads/28669-Microsoft-Toolkit-Official-KMS-Solution-for-Microsoft-Products ) and have an Intel HD 4000 Graphics GPU with an AMD Radeon HD 7970m in Enduro switchable graphics.

The problem is when running any metro app it is completely messed up (only graphically) and will be entirely white or black blocks that vary depending on what you select with the mouse. As far as I can tell they works flawlessly apart from the graphics.

I had one boot where they all worked but it all stopped working again, and there was no real difference I can tell of.

Thanks."
,Halloweenpsycho,2013-04-01T20:38Z,"@Muhr
i am unsure of the issue at hand. It is possible that it may be the activation method, i am not sure. You can go here https://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8320051/Windows_8_pro_32_and_64_bit_Serial_%5BWith_Wmc%5D
To activate windows and make it genuine and legit. All updates allowed, and permanent activation. I would say give that a shot, and if the problem still presists after that. Hit me back on this torrent here and i will look deeper into the issue for you :) Hope that helps.."
,Anna788,2013-04-04T17:47Z,"Oh my God, thank you for what you've published these days are struggling to activate Windows 8, and now I have this, and He took an active thank you so much now I can enjoy it.
Thanks again!! :)"
,meccastylez,2013-04-05T03:48Z,This activator screwed up my explorer where it will load up and I can log in. Problem once Ilog in the screen goes black except for the mouse pointer. All I can do from there is go to taskman. Lucky you I booted from dvd... -_-
,djnforce9,2013-04-05T15:24Z,"Thanks! Worked great.

I have my own key already but could use this to activate it on my second computer. Likewise, if Microsoft ever blocks my key, I can use this to save myself the grief of calling them up to resolve the matter; just as long as it can be used to install the OS then great."

[V],murphy78,2013-04-09T10:51Z,"This is a hacktivator.
It replaces 4 system files and a bunch of registry settings.
The original filename is p8_v25.exe and from the commenting in the reg file seems to be of chinese or japanese origin.

Being that it replaces 4 of the system files, it will not work with any Windows Updates, and possibly with any Win8 built-in WAT updates.

Use this at your own risk people. There's a reason most of us use kms activation; and not being able to update your system is one of them.

A few security websites report this as a trojan downloader, but I don't believe so as the mui files don't really support that.

You're much better off using Microsoft Toolkit if you want to use Windows Updates."
,Halloweenpsycho,2013-04-11T05:30Z,"well as for the last comment, it seems that murph had some issues with my stuff earlier on as i had to actually report him and 3 others for spamming my torrents..As for one..This was built by me, and tested in the same. Number 2. He is correct in 2 statements, replacing a file, and a registery. As for the kms activation method. It is normally used as a emulation system, to validate your windows for a period of no more than 180 day's, thus 7 days from the date you install the kms, which is ment for Schools and Mass bussiness your pc will attempt to reconnect every 2 hrs upon the first 7 days attempt. Simply put, it is a method that has been used for those that don't like to put work into there programs. I mean murph has been a good uploader for a long time and i appriciate his work. As you will see from comments above and comments on my windows 8 iso's this works. A lot of hard work, and time. Mostly ment to simply get you bye until i am able to release a new serial. For updates..They can be ran, but you will need to run this program again after you update for most updates anyway. So simply put, I try to provide the best uploads, and offer the best working programs i can. I always except Negative and Positive comments, as this is a free place to express your opinions. Murph All i ask is that you show me the same courtesy i extend to you, and that you not to come to my torrents and bash them. I really hope all stops here. Best wishes to you, and your crew."

"
,Ptolomeii,2013-05-09T17:09Z,"Problems appear if antivirus is installed. If antivirus recognizes cracked files and automaticaly it deletes those files, system can not run task manager crashes and ""open with..."" function does not work. The worst: explorer.exe finally crashed, and when I wanted shut off the PC (previous ctrl+alt+supr), an error message appeared: ""ctrl+alt+supr can not be executed"".

All files created with this activator run without problems only if PC have not installed an antivirus software or an exception is running.

I had to roll back to Windows 7."

,Halloweenpsycho,2013-05-27T12:11Z,"Well guys this jerk here Soda https://forum.suprbay.org/reputation.php?uid=717
Was the bully mod that removed my trusted status that i earned a long time back. I was even told by staff he is a Bully mod. So he told me a couple months ago that he would think about reinstating my trusted status in a couple months so i pmed him and just asked him about it and i received this nice little reply 
Enough. We do not give skulls to people who hustle for them.

Do not ask me or any other member of staff about this again. 

So i am appealing to the higher ups and asking what the issue is. I am sick and tired of this Shit and being treated like a asshole. I have only tried to help people and provide good uploads, and all of this because i asked one night why i was kicked from chat and Soda replied With a nasty remark to get over myself and move on, and Everybodylies
https://forum.suprbay.org/reputation.php?uid=268627 commented on it and told me to Fuck off son. So a month after this run in with these two. I get some nasty stuff from a VIP member downing my uploads. I asked to have it removed and Everybodylies was the one to reply and said no. That i didn't mind. But for what he said about me before i told him what i thought of him. Next day my Trusted status was gone and a Smiley face from Everybodylies on my new torrent. And it took me a month to find out who removed it. Finally staff told me it was Soda. I pmed and asked him about it nicely. And he fed me the crap i was not trustworthy and he would reconsider reinstating my status in a couple months which i knew was a lie. And now, here i am. I tried to be nice and polite, but screw them. All this was done for spite! I may not have a account after this so if i disappear from tpb look for me at p2pdl.com some damn nice people there. O by the way the links above are too Soda and Everybodylies Reputation, Anyone feel like telling them what you think of them It would be a pleasure. If i am gone because i told him exactly what i thought. Then it has been a pleasure to have provided torrents for you and to help those i could. Take care. Halloweenpsycho"
,Malakka,2013-05-29T18:02Z,"I can not understand this attitude some people in here. 
Take Halloweenpshyco as an example. He really works his ass off to provide all of us with good stuff. Despite all his effort, some folks are more than rude and bitches about when sth isnn't installed and works perfectly the very first second. 
Okay - of course people gets annoyed when shit does not work. I get pissed too! However, take some fucking seconds and read the instructions and use Google for crying out loud to find answers. Do not just whine and DO NOT GET RUDE! If you - that behaves as a schmuck - thinks that you are the hub of the wheel and that you are the most important person in universe - RETHINK!

Try to write the words: ""Thank you"". And if you aren't pleased - make a torrent yourself that works without any troubles. 

One day when you whiners will move out from your boy-room at your parents' and become an adult, you can NOT tell people that they are lame assholes, pussys, bitches, morons, dickheads, idiots, etcetera! Because if you do it in real life, away from the screen, you will get your ass kicked and moreover; you will never get a job. Not ever if you are a rude s.o.b.

So, take an advice from me - who are 53 years old: Behave ffs and be nice! 

I'll miss ya' Halloweenpshyco! 
Thanks for all your work."
,Halloweenpsycho,2013-05-29T23:52Z,"Thank you very much for the kind words. I just wanted to take a sec and let you all know i am not going anywhere. I figured out these assholes game plan which is to let me keep my account because they think that taking away my trusted status and not giving it back will force me away. But i am not going anywhere, i am going to stick here and continue my work for all. :) So Look for more ups from Halloweenpsycho. :)"
,Halloweenpsycho,2013-05-29T23:55Z,"Oh. and one more thing. You can also find me at p2pdl.com were i am a site friend and Vip. It is a small community but up and coming, so be sure to visit us. :) Lot of really good people."
,Malakka,2013-05-30T09:58Z,"That is damn good to hear, Halloweenpshyco. 
Your work is appreciated by many! You are one of few that answers to almost _every_ question in the chat - and that is a proof of how much you want to help people out. 

Keep it up dude! :)
