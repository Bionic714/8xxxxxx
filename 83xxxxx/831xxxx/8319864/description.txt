Armstrong Powerhouse presents the JXA & POA wagon which can be seen transporting scrap metal throughout England. These two wagons are very similar in appearance and feature the following:

Sheerness Steel & grey liveries (JXA)

Sheerness Steel livery (POA)

Fictional* Foster Yeoman & TML liveries (POA)

Weathered variants

Loaded versions

Authentic sounds

Flashing rear tail lamp

*These liveries were carried by a slightly shorter variant of this wagon but are included in this pack for extra variety.

As well as the wagons, three scenarios are included for the London to Faversham route where we have strived for realism in all areas. For example, each scenario uses the timetable of its relevant year to create an as realistic experience as possible. On top of this, all trains have their time of leaving, origin and destination so you can see which train is which! Each scenario has been made to try and be as interesting as possible whilst retaining realism.
