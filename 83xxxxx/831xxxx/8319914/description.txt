Sword of the Stars: The Pit is a fun, fast
light-hearted turn-based RPG, where the tradition of
Rogue and other old school dungeon-diving games meets
the sci-fi Sword of the Stars universe, where the
question to ask isn't "Did you make it to the end?"
so much as "How far did you make it into The Pit before
the monsters got you?"
