Drivers on the Mid Hants Railway know what a superb heritage line it is, and so we have developed a set of ten all-new scenarios that use classic steam locomotives from the Just Trains range to give you around 12 hours of new driving challenges.

As well as the scenarios we have included some all-new Just Trains Mk1 coaches in Southern British Railways green livery in Brake Standard Open, First Open and Tourist Standard Open layouts. Passenger view is included!
