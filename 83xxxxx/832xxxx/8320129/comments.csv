,Azhrey,2013-03-31T11:22Z,Do you have the 32bit edition?
,Elvaleryn,2013-04-01T01:37Z,"Huge kudos for promoting this indie game, definitely going to buy it on my next pay check. In the meantime, as you seem to have an account, can you download/torrentify the 32 bit version 0.3.0? I'm morbidly curious as to how the developers are focusing and how it's progressing. I can read the blog all day long but until I experience it... well, you know. It's just not the same."
