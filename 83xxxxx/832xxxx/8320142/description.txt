KLIAV - FAME'S VIRUS

Your are not the chosen one
your are just... one of us

ΓÇ£They build the grave without your fameΓÇ¥
Virus, Chemical pills
This time, for emotional skills
Unfold, hope in the dust
You dont know the meaning

Buried, alive and screaming
Forget, allies and fellings
Swallow, stars and stones
You dont know how many lifes and souls

Voiceless, behind the smoke
Dicease, where angels goes
Money, with blood in hands 
You dont know the meaning

Lifeless, religion core
Sickness, the bloody shore
Madness, we believe in gods
You dont know how many lifes and souls

Carve out the people now the landscape of the future

| They build the stairs... for me... for you
| They makes me feel... alone... with you

Carve out the people now the landscape of the future
