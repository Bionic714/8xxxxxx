Ben Howard is probably the most promising singer/songwriter at the moment. There is something very special in his music. However I do not have enough material to make a serious shortlist and a lot of material do not sound that good. However, Near Ed Sheeran, Jason Mraz, Damien Rice and Citizen Cope, Ben should be present as well. I will upgrade it later when more songs become available.

Enjoy,
