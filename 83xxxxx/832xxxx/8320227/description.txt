Some patch notes:

Minor:
Missing names of quest-related provinces are fixed.

Cosmetic:
All issues with text being too long for its window and getting cut or going outside the designated space have been hopefully eliminated.

As you can see, all changes are for text only. But we also updated exe files in order to display in the game the new version number which is 1.05.2 now.

Installation
