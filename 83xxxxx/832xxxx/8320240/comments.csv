This comment it is to say that after a few months without any ripping work from me , i decided to work this one because i have great ripping work for almost all the existant resident evil series games and of course this one was obrigatory too to continue my work on this great survival horror games series ...
I hope all the downloaders of this file be pleased with the presented work and i did my best effort with care for a great ripping file ...
happy game to all of you ..."

[V],globeplus,2013-04-10T13:58Z,"To dogoserf : thank you for your comment and let me take the opportunity to make a note about this type of work , i would like to see more help on this type of file for incentivatate a little more this files but maybe because my timing of the uploading and lot of concorrence i am not getting the ideal parameters for the downloaders but let me tell you that about the work itself it is exactly what you can expect about a successfull ripping work , with all the preparation of the files with correct analysis and then a perfect repacking code to get the possible best compression and my conscience is very clean because everything that was possible to do to get the file keeping the gameplay was done , happy games to you and see all of you around here at piratebay ."
