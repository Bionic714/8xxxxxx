,getsugasol,2013-04-01T06:08Z,"hey noobish did you unbox this yourself? trying to find out if burning this is of any use since its online game and probably comes with a code to enter that comes with the purchase, anyone who has any idea about it can respond"

,fretzsh,2013-04-08T10:47Z,"Just like to say this was a perfect torrent. Burned great and runs perfect.

As for the game itself - it's a pretty decent game to play with friends. If you have a few friends on xbox live to play with, i'd definitely recommend giving this game a shot"

,fletcher101,2013-05-13T04:40Z,"Downloaded Image, verified it with ABGX which added the topology, copied it on to my Xk3y and worked a charm. 

Be patient as it download its patched when you first run the game.

Surprisingly good game, its a fun MMO on X360 bee playing it solid for over a week now. 
It has a follow on TV show which helps you get the back story "
