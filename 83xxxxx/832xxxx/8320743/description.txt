Plot:Emily Taylor, despite being reunited with her husband from prison, becomes severely 

depressed with emotional episodes and suicide attempts. Her psychiatrist, Jonathan Banks, after 

conferring with her previous doctor, eventually prescribes an experimental new medication called 

Ablixa. The plot thickens when the side effects of the drug lead to Emily killing her husband in a 

"sleepwalking" state. With Emily plea-bargained into mental hospital confinement and Dr. Banks' 

practice crumbling around him, the case seems closed. However, Dr. Banks cannot accept full 

responsibility and investigates to clear his name. What follows is a dark quest that threatens to 

tear what's left of his life apart even as he discovers the diabolical truth of this tragedy......
