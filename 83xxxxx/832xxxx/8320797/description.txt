Self-help book very popular in 1920s and 1930s; covers how to control fear and worry, among other things, to be more effective in life. Christian faith- oriented, but applicable to anyone of any religious or non-religious bent.  This book is hard-to-find and is usually unavailable on such sites as Amazon or eBay.  I hope this is helpful and useful to somebody.
