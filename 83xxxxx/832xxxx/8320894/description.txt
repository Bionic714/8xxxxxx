






THE BEST MAGIC PERFORMANCE OF ALL TIME



See the magician escape from mortal danger.

A breathtaking effort to leave the audience speechless.



And after his brilliant success, you can see the 

magician completely unaffected by the loud and 

enthusiastic reaction from the public.



Unshaken and proud he gets ready to go on with 

some other trick we don't get to see here.



Probably when he was little, he did similar things 

to impress his mom and told her:  Look ma, no 

shame... 






Please seed because I can only seed for a short 

time. Thank you.
