  Emotional bloodletting never quite fit 30 Seconds to Mars -- perhaps it was residual prejudice from Jared LetoΓÇÖs status as actor-turned-musician, but they always seemed to skim the surface, not even when they pushed roiling emotions to the forefront in the best traditions of grunge and screamo. When they were mining a post-grunge or nu metal or emo vein, this was a liability, but now that theyΓÇÖve shifted their music with the shifting times, adopting a hybrid of the KillersΓÇÖ retro new wave and My Chemical RomanceΓÇÖs gothic prog, theyΓÇÖve wound up with a sound that suits their stance. Which isnΓÇÖt to say that theyΓÇÖve gotten any less ridiculous -- if anything, theyΓÇÖre more absurd, piling up Auto-Tuned vocals, gurgling synthesized loops, Kanye cameos, and a children's choir on almost every other song. Producers Steve Lillywhite and Flood, both veterans of U2, do give This Is War an appropriately epic scale, although appropriate seems an inappropriate word for such an ungainly mix of synth rock, metal, and prog, the distillation of all manner of brooding ΓÇÿ80s teenage obsessions. What saves it from being nothing but thirtysomething wish fulfillment is that this move toward goth-glam requires 30 Seconds to emphasize hooks and gives them aural variety, which doesnΓÇÖt make them seem any more serious but does make them considerably more palatable.
