Anybody...... helloooo =("
,chrisroberts3,2013-03-31T21:09Z,Yeah. What gives? Is this real or not?
,MLO89,2013-03-31T22:36Z,"Dunno if it's legit or not, it's quite a bit bigger than it should be. If in doubt you can get all updates at CS.RIN.RU forums. Those guys over there are sharp and quick with the updates to all Steam related games. Skidrow seems to have abandoned the patches for this game and the ones at CS.RIN.RU forums do not come with cracks. No big deal as all Tomb Raider patches work fine with original Skidrow crack. Just copy over the patch and you are good to go as long as you already had the crack in. If never updated the patch, put it in and get the stand alone Skidrow crack and you are golden."
,stephenwanck,2013-03-31T22:40Z,works !!!!
,Tegra3,2013-03-31T22:50Z,I say REAL because it's the exact same size as the one uploaded on a trusted website
,WILD4LIFE,2013-04-01T08:21Z,@MLO89 why has Skidrow abandoned the patches for this game???
,MLO89,2013-04-05T05:32Z,"Dunno, they are just not keeping up with the patches. In this case it doesn't matter cause no further cracks are needed as the original crack works for all the patches. Maybe that's why Skidrow is no longer bothering with it. As I said you can still get all future patches for this game as I stated above."
,MLO89,2013-04-13T00:23Z,"Another new patch out, 1.01.742.0"
