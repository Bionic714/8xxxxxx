Look, none of this is true. It's all made up ""secret knowledge"" based on lies, myths, faulty inferences, more lies, and fear. These people have an agenda. They wish to separate the gullible from their money and, in some way, control what they think through fear. Don't be fooled. This is hogwash, pure and simple. These people seem to think it's ok to lie and make stuff up as long as you're ""Lying For Jesus""! 
Wake up. Live in an evidence-based reality. View  everything with a sceptical eye. You'll be amazed at how much smarter you can be."
