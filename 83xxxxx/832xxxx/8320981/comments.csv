,filthy3825,2013-03-30T22:46Z,is anyone else having problems (slow download) with steelerj17 torrents? utorrent shows that there are seeder but never connects with them
,filthy3825,2013-03-30T22:47Z,"never mind, it FINALLY connected to a seeder"
,Mercyflush64,2013-03-31T01:00Z,I get a connection for a bit and then all of the seeding stops. Been trying the other downloads for a couple of days and they have not moved so I ended up just deleting them and waiting for better seeds. Sad thing is they show several completions but nobody sticking around to seed.
,SteelerJ17,2013-03-31T17:35Z,@Mercyflush64 I'm seeding this and I don't know why other people are too?? I guess they're just hit and runners. 
,filthy3825,2013-04-01T06:42Z,i am at 98.6%. i will seed once completed.
,SteelerJ17,2013-04-09T19:45Z,For those who are stuck since nobody is seeding. This is the RELOADED version. http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8357756
