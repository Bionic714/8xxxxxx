Sound quality: 9/10
Orginization: 7/10 (I hate when the year is on the folder, just put it on the song itself)
ID3 (Artist, album, whatnot like that): 0/10 Because I can't do anything with it. "
[T],Zoey_Redbird,2013-06-02T21:40Z,"Update: 
Rerating ID3 to 4/10, because I found that everything in here was labeled ""Read Only"" so I couldn't do anything with them. 
Next time you upload a torrent, please make sure the files aren't Read Only. "

The torrent is perfect...

TPB advises uploaders to label the content as read only : https://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=109746

I dunno how this person got a skull being so uninformed..."
