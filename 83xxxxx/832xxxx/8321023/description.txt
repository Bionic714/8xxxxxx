DEATH! BETRYAL! PARANOIA! THE CURSE OF THE SPAWN SPREADS!

As Jim Downing has violently sought answers to the many mysteries surrounding his work with The Program, those closest to him have gone about their lives. And while the darkness within Jim continues to grow, he is not the only one haunted by the curse of the Spawn.

Witness the dark realities of those whose lives have been touched by Jim's rebirth, as the shadows of damnation begin to take hold. Changing lives. Threatening lives. Taking lives!
