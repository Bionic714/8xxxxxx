Your health, strength, vitality and endurance are directly measured by the degree of your Nerve Force. It gives you the reserve power that makes life successful and fascinating. The world is full of people with the brains and ability to rise to the top, but who lack the necessary Nerve Force to push them forward. A personΓÇÖs beauty, charm and vivacity are directly related to the Nerve Force that makes them sparkle with radiant health. Your body is a complicated machine; Nerve Force and physical health are interdependent. Nerve Force is the driving power ΓÇô but its generation, in turn, depends upon the harmonious activities of the vital organs. Your body is nourished throughout its every part by a vast circulatory system that carries oxygenated blood from your heart and lungs. If an organ is not functioning properly, your blood will not contain the elements necessary to create the right sort of Nerve Force. Your stomach must digest efficiently. The digestion assimilating process must be dependable. The eliminating organs ΓÇô the bowels, lungs, kidneys and skin ΓÇô must have tremendous Nerve Force to work efficiently. The spleen, liver and all the vital organs of the complex blood-making laboratory must all work harmoniously.
