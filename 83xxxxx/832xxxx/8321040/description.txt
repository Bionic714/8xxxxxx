Photographs are valuable reference tools that most artists use. Complex subjects are generally easier to draw from photosΓÇöplus other factors, such as weather, movement, and lighting, can make drawing from life nearly impossible. Children and animals, for example, rarely sit still when you want them to, making it much easier to draw them from photographs. However, many beginning artists arenΓÇÖt confident in their picture-taking skills, or they donΓÇÖt know how to translate their photos into drawings. ThatΓÇÖs where this innovative book comes in! In no time, beginning artists will be drawing animals, people, landscapes, and still lifes that look real enough to reach out and touch!
