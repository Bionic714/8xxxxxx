Aussie (originally NZ) alt.country artist Jason Walker is blessed with a strong, emotive voice and terrific songwriting skills. Gram Parsons, Steve Earl and Neil Young are obvious inf luences (Walker has written a book on Parsons!). Judging by this album Walker stands up well, at least at this early stage, in comparison to those music icons! He also has spent a lot of time with Bill Chambers (Dead Ringer Band, Kasey Chambers). It shows. Some of Kasey's superlative writing skills just might have rubbed off on Jason Walker.

Delivery is everything when it comes to lyrics and this singer has the ability to hang his words out for us to hear, a tribute to his alt.country music background. He's also got one of those ear friendly voices.

There's a bitter sweetness about the album, but also enough variation for it to happily stand repeated plays. It begins with a shuffle piece, moves to a soft country, then a Rolling Stones type of format in 'Dissatisfaction'. There are a few country ballads and a touching song about a woman who's a drunk, and there's 'Drown In That River', a bouncy country rock drinking song.
