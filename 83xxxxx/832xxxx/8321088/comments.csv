,saint84,2013-03-30T20:51Z,crappy cam too small of a file .
[V],globeplus,2013-03-30T21:46Z,"Hi nice movies fans... this comment it is to make a quick note about the work in this video cam file... the original video had a singular carachteristic with the shooter of the cam leaving the recording time at the top left corner in smaller numbers while shooting the video and another normal references on the cam at the bottom like day and month or something , with a nice correct work with the Virtual Dub that indications on the movie screen was removed  not damaging or taking away anything of the screen , so this video cam file will look like the naturality on the cams and i wanted to share this little episode about the work on this cam file with the downloaders,so if any others cam files around have the recording time or date on the movie screen don´t be surprised because as i know it is the only cam available for the moment for this movie... happy movie to all of you and see you all around ."
,saint84,2013-03-31T10:21Z,"maybe the cam is the only one available here. but the encoding is not . 
now we have ts. and a 400 mb file is really wothless for any cam. bitrate too low, quality sucks . better uploads here already than this one "
[V],globeplus,2013-03-31T14:00Z,"To saint84: unfornatly for more obvious it looks to you that more bitrate implicates better quality when we are talking about cam files that it is not obvious as that , a cam file with more bitrate without a cleaning picture work still have the imperfections on the picture as the original with less bitrate , in the optic of the viewer of the cam , it is more enjoyable to the view , particles removed or less opac brightness for example on the screen , what makes the bitrate point not matters at all if the screen that you are watching is more clean than the one with more bitrate... so the bitrate in quality dvd rips can be important but in cams the essencial factor is the best presentation of the picture ...

Happy movies."
,frackuall,2013-03-31T17:51Z,tks for the upload very watchable
[V],globeplus,2013-03-31T20:44Z,"To frackuall : no problem , it is a pleasure upload cam files of the new nice movies and by the way a new cam with better stable position of the recording camera is out and without the recording time and dates , this file it is close to the new cam in the way that the mentionated inconveniences was removed and the picture was cleaned with the Virtual Dub but basically the lesson of this analysis is that in new cams we can be surprised with circunstancial inconveniences like people walking on the theatre , the shooting angle , unfocus shooting ans so on ... what it is important anyway is to watch the new nice movies sooner as possible...
happy movies and see you all around ... "
,TheC2G,2013-04-01T12:21Z,Thanks a lot..quality is  ok  on  my phone ;)
[V],globeplus,2013-04-01T14:38Z,"To TheC2G : hi there and let me tell you that cams are normaly ok to lower resolution video , why? because even if the quality not the best or having imperfections on the recording , the possible inconveniences on the viewing of the picture are reduced to the minimum because the lower resolution it is like to reduce the imperfections to a smaller size too showing them almost or very close to be impercetible on the screen and with that of course the vieweing of the movie in more enjoyable way ... happy movies to all of you and see you all around here at piratebay ..."
