,BUTT_SEX,2013-03-30T23:07Z,"God fucking damnit I know how to do it! I just think that the major uploaders should have a xvid version instead of all uploading the same damn thing. So more people have options. Xvid is the more versatile encoder! Not everyone has the know how of how to convert a file, I'm just looking out for the greater good here!"
,BUTT_SEX,2013-03-30T23:07Z,"I use Pazera anyways, it's free and works great."
,trace535,2013-03-31T00:15Z,"People like you BUTT_SEX who watch their TV shows on a game console or a media box have been complaining for an entire year now of the xvid->x264 transition. 

Is it going to stop soon?"
