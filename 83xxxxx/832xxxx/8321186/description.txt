Nathaniel Adams Coles (1919-1965) major influence was Earl Hines.



When Nat was promoted primarily as a vocalist the jazz world lost

the music he would have otherwise made as one of the best pianists

ever.



28 of these tracks have been carefully culled from a (5) CD set of

radio transcriptions made by CP MacGregor in Hollywood,CA.

There are vocals here, but I've placed the emphasis on the piano

playing as much as possible.


My favorite tracks include #9, 11, 17, 22
