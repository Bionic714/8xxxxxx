in the last version of uTorrent i discovered a bug 
and could not fix it an its still in the forums to fix it 
all the files show as checking 0% an stuck
removing an restarting them mabye one would happen sometimes but this old 
last version of utorrent fixed that.

never trust any exe until you at least scan it though.
i believe im clean but you never know.
trust no one. even your gram-ma, hell never trust granny she cliks anything.


now im not a  uploader virgin this is my 1st upload. 
lets see how i screwed it up now.

:P
