,majikku22,2013-03-31T00:00Z,"What?  No premiere episode of ""Orphan Black""?  If you could find it that would be awesome!"
,Llwynog,2013-03-31T04:55Z,"Thanks a ton! I've been waiting for this for months. But this is episode 7, not 6. I was mightily confused when I saw episode 6 uploaded today when I already had episode 6, ""The Snowmen"". I had to double-check the episode listings to find out that episode 7 was indeed titled ""The Bells of Saint John""."
,trace535,2013-03-31T05:11Z,"Llwynog, 

Doctor Who specials don't count as regular episodes, hence this is indeed the sixth episode of the 7th season."
,Taiga_Chan,2013-03-31T05:47Z,I will seed for as long as I am at the house but when I leave I cannot seed I wont leave my laptop seeding while I'm away. So I'll seed for a few more minutes.
