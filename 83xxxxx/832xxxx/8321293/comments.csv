,BlaTaN,2013-03-31T01:10Z,"MKV files are the shiznizz. Anything that has the ability to contain HD files whether it be this or MP4 ...etc... all good..... it's AVI's THAT FULLY SUCK ANAL GROUTING BALLSACKS!


Thanks heaps for the Up  eztv, always No.1"
,BlaTaN,2013-03-31T01:15Z,"MKV files are far better than most files.... Im guessing the anal grouting ballsack above me who claims they suck, must still not own a player capable of playing them.

AVI's are the scourge of all files.  MP4's (depending) can be hit and miss.  MKV (container) is awesome for HD when Mp4's aren't around........ dont listen to the noob above me,  he/she is just jealous!  LOL"

Okay I'm done. 

Fucking retard. Get a real video player or learn to convert so you can play it on your shitty console or whatever you use while the rest of us sensible people with brains watch it on our computers. MKV's are fucking awesome. Thanks uploader!"
,nerpple,2013-03-31T06:35Z,THANK YOU SO BLOODY MUCH.
,kinvore,2013-03-31T07:12Z,Thanks for the upload!
,Mavsynch,2013-03-31T08:56Z,"Wait, what's wrong with AVI files? They're usually the smallest and run just fine."
,soundping,2013-03-31T10:06Z,"Everything audio and video works great!
Thanks eztv."
,DrTen,2013-04-01T18:51Z,"Holy entitled idiots. Not all of us live in our parents' basements where all our media is within a 5' reach. All of my storage is held on a network HDD in the basement where all our wired connections live, and then streamed to our various mobile devices, laptops or consoles around the house.

MKVs are good quality, but low market penetration. Maybe if the next gen consoles pick up the format, and we see more mobile devices support it we'll see it pick up.

But not all of us attach our computers to our TVs or have the desire to run a computer 24/7 just to host media files."
,SubReCaptcha,2013-04-01T21:27Z,"MKV is a fucking container! Every normal device capable of playing video files CAN OPEN IT! It's the codec what matters, and that's usually the fully supported h.264 with audio like MP3, OGG, AAC, AC3 or DTS. All are supported with every normal device. A fucking mid-class Android phone can play HD videos in MKV format.
Oh, wait, maybe your iPhone doesn't support some non-Apple media formats? Well shit, buy some reasonable device!"
