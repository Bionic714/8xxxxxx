[T],penfag,2013-03-30T21:45Z,This is great -- I attended one of Milosz's readings years ago and walked away with a couple of signed first editions.  Great memories.  Thank you for reviving them!
[T],pharmakate,2013-03-31T04:59Z,@penfag - Now that makes me envious. But I'm glad I'm not the only Milosz fan here.

Oh yeah,he won because it's a fake,meaningless award given to any monkey who can put on a suit."
