,keywest33,2013-03-30T23:47Z,Please SEED badly needed
[V],2010kaiser,2013-03-31T00:50Z,"@keywest33

It's being seeded from a dedicated server. The slow speed must be down to the demand. Sorry mate. I'll be seeding this for a good while. ;-)"
,keywest33,2013-03-31T19:00Z,Thanks but I am still at 17.9% since you uploaded this very slow download.
,keywest33,2013-03-31T19:02Z,12 hours + so far on download  speed @ 48kbs now
,papayrus,2013-03-31T19:22Z,Is this buggy or is it like a total retail windows 8 just updated with the new kernal? Also does anyone know if windows blue is supposed to do anything more for gaming performance?
[V],2010kaiser,2013-03-31T21:29Z,Nothing i can do about the speeds guys. Leechers/Seeders are almost 3:1 and the server is seeding at 1 mbps

,tjflamezz,2013-04-01T12:50Z,Guys give the internet a break. its the DDOS issue which is causing Dl's to be slow. Also this did leake so it aint a prank ( i think :P). trying to download it now
,zfantasy,2013-04-01T13:29Z,"can we use it on win-8 64-bit, or is there a separate version for that?"
,CEO,2013-04-01T17:13Z,"Nice enhancements in 'Modern' Settings, Internet Explorer 11 is fast!!!
Little bit buggy.
Cut a partition for it, runs better than in a VM."
,ixvortex,2013-04-01T19:40Z,"I`m a bit new to this, even though I have two different versions of 8 running. File shows up as DAEMON.Tools.Lite. 
Question: Do I need to use AnyToISO or can I just use ImageBurn to a disk? It doesn`t look like the regular ISO file. Thanks in advance guys. I`ll post if I figure it out. "
,ixvortex,2013-04-01T21:40Z,"ok burned to disk successfully with ImageBurn and now installing to a cut partition as CEO recommended.

Thanks CEO and 2010kaiser"
,dioxnet,2013-04-04T15:56Z,not suitable for windows 8 64bit
,shikhar623,2013-04-04T19:45Z,"Hello Kaiser,

Read the torrents description:

""The leaked build lacks access to the Windows Store, and it is not possible to activate it."""
,Culicidae,2013-04-06T08:44Z,GData antivirus found some viruses in this.
,monk52,2013-04-06T16:14Z,"thanks to 2010kaiser .
impossible to activate and any updates available. Only for having a look of windows blue which brings news parameters on windows 8   "
,cj42057,2013-04-09T00:24Z,"Check again guy, this CAN BE activated and here's proof. http://i.imgur.com/TID9AO5.png

You need the right key and then ANY kms activator that will allow a custom cd key."
,cj42057,2013-04-09T00:30Z,This can be activated using the PROPER key and ANY KMS activator that will allow you to use a custom key. Proof -> http://i.imgur.com/phXfOFn.png
,freedomlh19,2013-04-12T15:57Z,Can someone post a DxDiag of Windows Blue?
,maha609,2013-04-19T06:38Z,"@2010kaiser

Windows blue just leaked on 18th April 2013, how you got the OS in 30th March ???"
,twijjit,2013-04-24T11:28Z,"If the techie dude at Best Buy was right in that they don't make 32-bit computers anymore, I have to wonder, what kinda system was this meant for? My newest 32-bit machine is a Toshiba laptop, with 2G ram, 2.2GHz dual-core, could it run it? Probably not very well. Just seems to make sense to me that they would have made this a 64-bit version, since most of the computers Microsoft's ""Partners"" are using would be just that. Perhaps I'm overthinking it.

Can't wait to see this evolve into production, as any computer I'd be willing to put it on, is x64. :/"
,WayOfLifeFreeDom,2013-05-09T12:40Z,"I read a lot of comments of low DS (Download Speed) i am downloading this with 1MB/s so.. i will give a good try to this one.! 
Tnx to uploader..!"
,danwat1234,2013-05-30T22:36Z,"I hope Windows Blue's Explorer will finally support file paths longer than 255 characters in length. NTFS support thousands of characters in length. I have to use totalcommander to do file transfers.

Also I hope Explorer will finally use the correct units for file storage. MiB and GiB instead of MB and GB.

That is the source of confusion when everybody complains about a 1TB hard drive only having 931GB of capacity or a 500GB drive only having 465GB of capacity! It is because Windows lies."
