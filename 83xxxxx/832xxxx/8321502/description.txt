Technology Documentary hosted by Peter Lownds, published by Discovery Channel broadcasted as part of DC Wings series in 1998 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

Go behind-the-scenes at Dryden Flight Research Center, NASA's remote outpost where the world's top experimental flight researchers and pilots develop cutting-edge technology and flight test the world's most advanced aircraft. Here you'll get the very rare opportunity to experience the power of top aircraft like the X-1, the X-15, the X-33, the X-43 and many more.
This is the story of high risk and engineering genius, pushing the envelope to fly higher and faster. Like early explorers, these aeronautical adventurers travel where no one has gone before and share a passion to push the limits of speed, sometimes even risking death to improve and expand our horizons. This extraordinary production combines unprecedented camera access with never-before-seen test flight footage, and state of the art computer graphics.



1)  Flights of Discovery 
Witness the cutting edge of space research. Take a front row seat on the runway at Dryden Flight Research Center as pilots attempt to flight test the X-33's radical new "linear aerospike" rocket engine on the world's highest and fastest aircraft, the SR-71 Blacbird. It's highly explosive ! It's high risk ! It's high adventure ! Plus meet the early pioneers whose heroic flights blazed the trail for today's modern day explorers by taking on the challenges of the X-15 and the Lifting Body, the prototype for a wingless aircraft that could fly into space and back.
