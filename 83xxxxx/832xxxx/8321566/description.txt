"Long ago in a galaxy far, far away called Pacoima, a group of brave junior college cheerleaders fought against uncoolness, negativity, and a teensy-weensy production budget..."

So begins the lo-fi, Star War-sy scrawl that announces this goofball porn satire of....well, goofball late-night cable programming. It stars (or, more accurately, toplines) real-life junior college graduate and beloved 80's fuck-flick starlet Tracey Adams, in a difficult dual role. On one level, she's Captain Bimbo, the leader of a crack crew of silicone-enhanced space-bimbos, on a mission to explore the mysterious Pancreas 4 planet. On another level, she's just an Earthbound cheerleader named Bambi with aspirations to direct, gamely attempting to perform a no-budget space opera with her bubble-headed pals.

Named in Spain "Polvos Espaciales"
