,turtlex,2013-03-31T01:57Z,Wow!  Incredible torrent catapiller.  There's some great stuff in here.  Thanks.
,binderguy1,2013-03-31T03:43Z,"What a freakin' comprehensive collection of Jim Starlin you compiled here!   I'm impressed and grateful for the ul!

I know of one former CBR blogger that's a Jim Starlin fan who might get into this.

BTW, not sure why you didn't end the Dreadstar run at # 40 (as Jim Starlin ended his run there).  Maybe # 33-40 is on the missing issues list.

Thanks again for the ul, Caterpiller!"
