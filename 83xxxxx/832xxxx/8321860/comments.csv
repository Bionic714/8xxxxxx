,faisechelon,2013-04-10T12:45Z,It says something about .NET Framework. What do I do? Help please.
,dCrackShot,2013-04-11T04:00Z,you're a G. Ive been busting my balls for 2 weeks trying to reactivate W8 and you've done it. I thank you very much
,AndroidLove,2013-04-11T14:20Z,"Sorry, I'm a newbie with this toolkit activation method.. I tried reading the Readme included but it's not written in a scenario based way so it's going a bit over my head. So here's the scenario:
I had downloaded and installed MS Office 2013 directly from the Microsoft website in trial mode. 

Now the trial has expired and the main menu bar has turned red, editing documents has been disabled and it gives me an option to Buy / Enter Key / & Sign In - to add this computer to an active account?

What do I have to do now with the toolkit to get Office working again now?
I tried clicking on the EZ Activator button under the Activation tab based on what I could understood from the Readme but I get back a msg saying: ""Cannot Activate because this product is incapable of KMS Activation.

Can someone please, please provide a step-by-step method of how to go about solving this?
Many many thanks in advance for any help at all and thanks for reading this far!

Cheers!"

,SpiderFan077,2013-04-19T19:56Z,Does this work if I download the Windows 8 upgrade directly from microsoft? Thanks...

,innieway,2013-04-22T03:32Z,"AndroidLove and lambinator - First, if you don't have Revo Uninstaller Pro find a torrent for that and install it. Then use Revo to uninstall your version of Office. 
After Revo runs Office's uninstaller, if it says ""you must restart computer"" be sure to click ""do it later"". Then click on the Revo ""advanced"" scan mode, run that, and then if it finds leftovers click ""select all"" and then delete. Then it may or may not find yet more leftovers. If so select all again and delete.
Now reboot (regardless if it said you have to or not).
Now reinstall Office. Your best bet would be find a torrent of it. It doesn't need to be one that's cracked. Install that, and THEN run this, and you should be set :)  "
