,Antharia,2013-03-31T18:03Z,"This ""movie"" is a piece of crap. Seriously, dont waste your time, its so low budget and the ""actors"" are crappy, it hurts watching it. I deleted it after a few minutes of watching it."
,TheEmpathicEar,2013-03-31T23:43Z,"@Antharia

Is it ""good"" or ""bad"" crap?"
,keanu501,2013-04-01T00:20Z,'crap' is subjective.. kind of like 'crab is in the eye of the beholder'. ;)
,theleapfrog,2013-04-01T03:06Z,this movie... is ehhh kinda like an average crap ya na mean? i mean it's not crap like diahrrea but it's not as hard as a rock bleeding crap. it's kinda of in the middle somewhere. maybe a little more brocoli will be useful while watching this movie again.
,MrSlay,2013-04-01T10:49Z,I like my crap to be rock hard. The kind you bust your arse hole open with. No soft crap thats for sure.
,dlarrym1111,2013-04-01T13:30Z,"I'll give this a chance. Bruce Dern, (father of Laura Dern - Jurassic Park, played the Botanist Dr. and friend of Sam Neels character), makes me suspect to the accusations of these actors being total crap. Bruce Dern is by no means a ""CRAP actor"". He's been in hundreds of movies, and is even a winner of a couple of OSCARS. He is known as playing psychopaths and criminals in general.

Brian Krause: Another Heavy Hitter, He's a co-writer of the TV series ""Charmed"", (not my favorite show but quite popular non the less) and starred in it for over 8 seasons! (opposite of Alyssa Milano). He played in the the popular detective TV series ""The Closer"" and ""CSI - Miami"", he was a soap opera star on ""ANOTHER WORLD"", The TV series ""Tales from the Crypt"", He' is no slouch. He doesn't need the money so he has no reason to involve himself in some f___ed up movie.
AnyWay.
I'll give it a try esp since the quality of the video/audio seems to be decent.
I'll post back if I too get the same impression on it sucking badly. Im not going to claim it CAN'T be shit despite some decent actors. Maybe these guys are on SMACK??? who knows?
Later :~)"
