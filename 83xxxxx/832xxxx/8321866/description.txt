As a mother of a child with autism & someone who has met Dr. Wakefield on many occasions, just have to say I LOVE this movie. So happy someone posted it on YouTube. Here is thescienceisrael is the user name if the link doesn't work. 

The actors are brilliant. I've never seen kids acting like they have autism so realistic before. And there are many little things about this film that are real- the details have purpose. Thank you to all those involved in making this movie- from the writers to the actors to the crew. A must see!!!!!
