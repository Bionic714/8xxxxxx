Darkhomr: I appreciate your efforts in the community in general. I think you do a great job on the 0-day packs, but these starhome repacks are done completely in poor taste and contrary to the wishes of the fine folks who buy the comics and spend their hours upon hours to bring them to our community. You being an upstanding member of that community, I don't understand how you'd post these in good faith. I'd love to discuss it more with you via PM if you like. (suprbay)"
