In 15-years the Black Mafia Family or BMF as they were
called made close to 300 million dollars trafficking
cocaine from Atlanta to Los Angeles. Two brothers
Demetrius Meech Flenory and Terry Southwest T Flenory
ran a drug enterprise that had 200 members and was
connected to one of the major Mexican cartels. In the Hip
Hop music industry they created a front company called BMF
Entertainment, which was a perfect mix of drugs, violence
and street cred that makes their story Hip-Hop s version
of the Godfather

BMF is a 80-minute documentary that explores the story of
the 15-year investigation by the DEA, FBI and an elite
drug task force called HIDTA that resulted in 41
defendants across the country being charged in one of the
largest drug conspiracy cases ever. The film is a tale
that combines the story of a criminal syndicate that lived
on a code of honor and conduct that rivaled any of the
five Mafia families, and ended just as dramatically under
a hailstorm of government informants, wiretaps and
surveillance that ultimately caused the downfall of the
Hip-Hop Drug Empire

With over 11,000 government documents and close to 5,000
photographs and taped conversations the BMF is a
documentary that will deconstruct the story of BMF from
both the law enforcement angle and from members inside BMF
that had intimate knowledge of the operation. The film
will include interviews with: informants, DEA Agents
District Attorney s, FBI, Atlanta Police and rare insights
from Hip-Hop heavyweights, Young Jeezy, Gucci Mane, Rick
Ross, Fabolous, and many others. While many articles have
been written in the press about BMF, BMF is a film on two
brothers that were able to fuse an organized crime network
with a company that purveyed Hip-Hop hype, the ultimate
gangster tale
