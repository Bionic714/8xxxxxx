The drum solo is an exciting element of belly dance that doesn t have to be intimidating. Let tempo and rhythmic patterns be your guide as you pair simple moves with the compelling beat of the drum. 
Bahaia will take you through this unique step-by-step process to help you gain the confidence you need to dance to any beat. In time, drum solos are sure to become a highlight of your dance experience. 

In the 1-2-3 Belly Dance series we ll break down the dance in 3 easy steps: 

Step 1 - Break down the technique to ensure proper training. 

Step 2 - Drill the movements individually, or in the BONUS Extended Drills Section, to build strength and stamina. 

Step 3 - Incorporate the moves into a choreographed drum solo dance routine that's ready to perform or can be a source of inspiration for your own unique dance.
