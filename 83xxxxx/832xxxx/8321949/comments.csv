,glangley,2013-03-31T03:18Z,What does it mean when you said that you cut 40 secs of line audio for security reasons?
,kellogg9,2013-03-31T05:15Z,"@glangley, i think he means because of security reasons he had to cut around ~40secs of the audio (line).  As i understand it.  Hope that helps (please like and subscribe to show ur thanks for my in-depth deciphering for you)"
,kellogg9,2013-03-31T05:18Z,"I will report back shortly on the real A/V rating for this cam!  Stay tuned.  

I wont be like so many l8mers here who say they will report back and never return.  That nonsense has to stop guys!  I will set a good example and do my part!

Ok, be right back!"

now, how about that a/v rating?"
,pwnt_soup,2013-03-31T07:57Z,"audio is clear 7.5 video is watchable but has some issues, brightness fades in and out a bit and nighttime scenes are very dark, 6 thanks to the up loader for the early effort, it's a watchable TS"
,2ndtuenon_220,2013-03-31T08:37Z,"V/6 A/6 . Slight sync issue. As far as TS goes, pretty standard."

,Jeff6669,2013-04-13T00:46Z,"@glangley,
It most likely means that these 40 seconds of audio have a tag on it to identify the source. It would not be audible, but if you copy the sound directly from the source, you can copy that security tag. This would then allow identification of where the movie came from, which could potentially get the maker into trouble."
