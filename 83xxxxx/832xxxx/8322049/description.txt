Orbital Sunset 3D is an animated Wallpaper-Screensaver which shows a satalite orbiting around the world. Very beautiful with soothing music which can be turned on or off.


1) Use the "orbitalsunset" exe to install the program.

3) You will be given  an option during installation to install the 

screensaver manager, you can if you want to, I just find it 

pointless as I use this mainly for wallpaper.

3) After installation, run the program.
Right click on the icon on the right side of the taskbar 
and go to the Register section.

Use any name, then enter the serial provided.
