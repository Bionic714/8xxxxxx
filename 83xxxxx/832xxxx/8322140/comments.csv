Is this the last GHOST Omnibus from Dark Horse?

I know there were two X Omnibuses awhile back, is that it for that genre? "
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-01T02:06Z,"riverchase, you're welcome my friend. just trying to give back.

binderguy1, there was also a dark horse heroes omnibus, did you get that one? it collects the first Comics Greatest World (iirc it was 16 16-page issues) and Will to Power.

and also a barb wire omnibus. so 9 [[insert whatever word is the plural of omnibus here]] in all."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-01T02:08Z,8! not 9! definitely 8! i can't count.
