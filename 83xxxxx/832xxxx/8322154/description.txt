No one will ever accuse Lukas Nelson of taking the easy way out or following the path of least resistance. Anyone whoΓÇÖs taken the time to follow his musical development over the last four or five years knows that Lukas can pretty much do whatever he wants musically. HeΓÇÖs a natural singer with an innate sense of phrasing that many artists spend a life time developing; his sense of melody is so natural and ΓÇÿbang onΓÇÖ in a commercial sense that he could spend the rest of his days penning radio hits if he wanted to, and his guitar playing has moved out of imitation ΓÇô though itΓÇÖs still easy to hear and feel his influences in every note ΓÇô and into territory that is becoming all his own. With talent like Nelson has, itΓÇÖs both surprising and gratifying that he has chosen to make a record like ΓÇÿWasted.ΓÇÖ If he was a different kind of person and hadnΓÇÖt grown up in an environment that encouraged him to trust his instincts, he could easily have given into the pressure to create an album of radio friendly hits, full of hooks and memorable choruses that would earn him a place at the very forefront of the contemporary country scene.
