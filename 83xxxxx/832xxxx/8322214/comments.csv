,Hambosas,2013-03-31T18:40Z,I hope you guys like this one and others to come cause I added more subtitles and encoded it differently so that it plays on everything Apple and also through stuff like VLC and such. If you have any requests please do ask cause it is fun for me to do this.
,kchenxi,2013-04-01T10:12Z,@Hambosas: Can you please do Flight? thx
,Muero91,2013-04-01T19:36Z,"The movie is supposed to be 150 minutes. After downloading, MediaInfo and VLC report this file to be 141 minutes. I haven't watched all the way through, but it seems cut off at the end, and there are no credits. Did my download get corrupted, or is the file really cut off?"
,icarlos2011,2013-04-01T22:12Z,"hambosas, you can put michael jackson this is it (HD) itunes please, I'd appreciate it too."
,Hambosas,2013-04-02T01:01Z,"That is really strange that neither this nor the 1080p version have no subtitles, it is my fault that I didn't check before uploading. I cannot re-upload them so you will have to deal without. If you want credits check out imdb.com or wikipedia. This won't happen again."
,Hambosas,2013-04-02T01:01Z,"Not subtitles, I meant credits..."
,Klazik666,2013-04-04T08:59Z,"Thanks man, hope to see here all the other oscar nominees. Thanks for the spanish subs."
