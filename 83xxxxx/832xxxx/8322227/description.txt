Despite the underwhelming winter of 2011-12, in which snowfall reached near record lows and avalanche conditions were unstable around the West, the Powderwhores were able to make the most of the conditions, with trips to Cerro Castillo, Chile; La Grave, France; the Antarctic Peninsula; Svalbard, Norway; British Columbia, Canada, and the Wasatch Mountains in Utah. The film features top backcountry skiers and snowboarders, including Chris Davenport, Jake Sakson, Andrew McLean, Seth Wescott, Dylan Freed, Noah Howell, Matt Reardon, Drew Stoecklein, Forrest Coots, Ian Provo, Neil Provo, Chuck Mumford, Darrell Finlayson, Bob Athey, PY Leblanc, Jason Thompson, Todd Stuart and other mountain characters. ΓÇ£We are playing with the theme of the old Choose Your Own Adventure books. Remember those?ΓÇ¥ says Powderwhore athlete and co-owner Noah Howell. ΓÇ£Our interest lies in finding exotic locations and people with real stories and objectives. We wanted to tag along and capture their motivation for heading into the mountains. ItΓÇÖs more of an authentic experience this way, instead of a staged video shoot. We traveled light and fast so we didnΓÇÖt interfere with the actual adventures as they unfolded.ΓÇ¥ In the end, ΓÇ£Choose Your AdventureΓÇ¥ is a feature-length film that celebrates exotic locations, wild adventures, and inspired personalities.
