Orphan Black (2013– ) 
 TV Series  -   60 min   -  Action | Drama | Sci-Fi - Rating: 7.5
Stars: Tatiana Maslany, Jordan Gavaris & Dylan Bruce
Synopsis:
Orphan Black follows outsider, orphan and street-wise chameleon Sarah. After witnessing a woman's suicide, Sarah assumes the strangers identity - who happens to look just like her. Expecting to solve all her problems by cleaning out the dead woman's savings, Sarah is instead thrust headlong into a kaleidoscopic mystery as she realizes the dizzying truth - she and the dead woman are clones. As Sarah searches for answers, she discovers the chilling fact that there are more people like her out there - genetically identical individuals who were planted in unsuspecting birth parents and nurtured in completely different circumstances. With no idea who created the clones, she'll need to discover the reason in a hurry as an assassin is killing them one by one."
,Chaos_Seer,2013-04-07T05:39Z,"This show is annoyingly flashy. The first episode spends half it's time over-establishing the fact that the main character is not only gay, but flaming and British both to the point of stereotyped. The other half demonstrates the annoying protagonists stunning ability to vomit and fuck her way out of any problem she gets into, while every character she runs into who thinks she's this other girl Beth seem so idiotic that they can't see through the utterly confused performance of the main character to figure out ""Oh, she's a different clone then the agent we know!""

""Then we'll get a shot of her ass and her side boob and we'll seal the deal!"" It'll win over anyone with the mind-set ""heh, heh, boobs... Heh, heh, ass..."" meanwhile they leave anyone looking forward to a good, new sci-fi about clones sighing in disappointment.

I know I may seem way too pissy. But I was really looking forward to this show. I'm dying for some good sci-fi after being disappointed by Continuum. Turns out this is even more disappointing. Give me something that makes my brain go ""Hm..."" please! Stop pandering to fucking idiots! Stop shuffling the equation and come up with something new and challenging!

My suggestion to all readers: Don't watch, let the series die, pray the money which is being wasted in funding gets moved to some more worthwhile project (perhaps a fools prayer)."

,Squareyes,2013-04-23T23:30Z,"Lol @ Chaos. boobs & booty? I am in.
Seriously though, I like Continuum.
This show does seem to have that BBC touch.
Pretty good for a pilot, will see if it gets better or worse.
As always great up EZ  A/V 9/9
THANKS"
,Redstar2613,2013-05-12T10:37Z,"This comment is to those that dont yet know what the show is about, without spoiling anything at all and also for those that have read Chaos_Seer's comment. I want to correct the awful idea that person may give people about the show, again, without spoilers. Everything Chaos_Seer said is wrong. 

The writing is really intelligent and most of the twists in the show are not easy to spot. Every episode is constantly exciting. Even my favourite show, Farscape, doesn't keep this level of excitement throughout.
To avoid spoilers, I'll just say this: of course other character don't realize the truth about the main one. If someone you knew started acting weird, you're not going to think they're... well, that would be a spoiler. 
One of the main characters is gay. So what? It's not as in your face as Chaos makes it out to be, who is clearly homophobic. 
So if you read that persons comment, just ignore it and make up your own mind. You don't have to like the show but his/her particular reasons were just stupid and ignorant. So she vomited to get out of doing something... one time. Chaos makes that kind of thing sound common, when it isn't. And in fact, was a good idea for the character."
,Redstar2613,2013-05-12T10:39Z,"To put it simply: This is one of the best shows I've seen in a long time. Very original, intelligent, constantly exciting and it helps that the main character is both cute AND sexy, in my opinion at least. "
,Chaos_Seer,2013-05-14T21:05Z,"Pfft, Farscape was way better than this shit (and definitely worth being someone's favorite show). 

I probably could have ranted with fewer spoilers, but I was pretty pissy.

I'm not against homosexuality on TV/Film, and if anything I think it's important it's included in TV and film to get the annoying biases of the past out of the way. That character just goes way too absurdly far with it. I've seen way better gay characters on TV. The scenes with him (at least in the first episode) are just way too over-emphasized.

What pisses me off is is that 'over-gay' behavior. That behavior doesn't stem from actually being gay... It's a cultural thing, people with effeminate instincts buying into our primary cultures display of what it means to be a woman. It pisses me off as much as that womanly stereotype which women get brainwashed into.

Just you wait and see... It'll push right into a culture of over-priced, over-varied clothing advertised for men as well as women. Not a truth to behavior in any sense, just the push by businesses to create a more profitable cultural climate.

Fuck that none-sense. A person should have the right to fall in love with, live with and be attracted to any consenting adult. Any rule of romance which applies to any pairing should fairly apply to the other, and it should be fairly represented by film (that it isn't is a sexist thing). They just shouldn't push the shitty elements of our culture, further brainwashing people."

Every gay person I've ever met was way cooler, more interesting, and less irritating than this single character."
