,michaelrwatson,2013-04-01T10:26Z,"Wow... How did Paul Walker get involved in this piece-o-shyte? Bad writing, bad editing, juvenile production design, lame story, bad direction, bad music., bad opening titles, um, did i mention bad editing..? OMG. 

Good rip though--at least the first 15min which was all i could take. Thanx HeroMaster/RiSES."

looks like an interesting movie, just previewed the downloaded file and it seems the music in the movie is louder than the actors voices, could be my VLC issue, not sure yet."
