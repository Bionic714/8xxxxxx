,Rytiux,2013-03-31T13:58Z,"the torrent works fine, thanks for uploading"
,Scythro,2013-03-31T14:27Z,"There's no need for me to build an installer for this, that way we would just split the seeds. (For that reason just a tip, stop seeding the other one you uploaded so both your up speed and the leechers will come for this one which is the same I guess)
However good job uploading it, if it wasn't for you I probably never noticed that a patch come out, playing to much League nowdays lol"
