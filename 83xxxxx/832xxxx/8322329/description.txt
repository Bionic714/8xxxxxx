Documentary taken from the Media BlastersΓÇÖ release of 'Images in a Convent' DVD


This film features an extensive interview with Italian movie maker, the late Aristide Massacessi, better known as Joe D'Amato. Through interview clips, and clips from his catalogue of over 100 films, "Joe D'Amato Totally Uncut" traces the director's journey from title designer, to director of photography, and finally to director of some of Italian cinema's most notorious films. D'Amato discusses his feelings about his life, his work, his relationships with such stars as Laura Gemser, and his distaste for hardcore adult cinema.

Reportedly this is a truncated version, glossing over D'Amato's work in the horror genre to focus almost exclusively on his sex flicks. (The DVD packaging lists the doc's running time as 90 minutes.) 

Film clips ΓÇö some of them hardcore ΓÇö from scores of D'Amato's movies are interwoven with extensive segments from the last major interview the man gave before his death in 1999. 

Even if this doesn't represent the documentary in its complete form it is highly worthwhile for fans of D'Amato's Eurosleaze ouevre. (It would appear to have been taken from a less than ideal videotape source but is watchable.)

There are several scenes which are included in both parts I uploaded, but I can assure everyone they're not the same documentaries.
