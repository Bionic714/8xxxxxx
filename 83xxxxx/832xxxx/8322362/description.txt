Thanks to Steve Bohannon for getting these to disc. There was a little digi before 
'And It Stoned Me'.  Again, like other Sit 'N Ski shows, this seems to have occurred a few times on most of the run. There is also a little static as 
'No Sugar Tonight' comes in (a bit late as well).  However, the show overall sounds
spectacular.  Seeded by Alan Schwartz
