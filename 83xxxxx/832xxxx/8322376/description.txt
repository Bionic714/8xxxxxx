This is one I always have loaded on my I-Phone.  They really know how to jam whether it's pure rock-n-roll or getting bluesy.  I've loved them ever since I saw them on the H.O.R.D.E. tour in 1993 (Walnut Creek Amphitheater in Raleigh, NC and Strawberry Fields Amphitheater in Richmond, VA).  I actually went to 2 shows on that tour.  They were pretty loud and I'm pretty sure I lost some hearing, but that can happen when you're on the 
third row to the right side of the stage by the speakers.  I've seen them here and there over the years and they still jam and impress the hell out of me.  

Definitely download this one!!!

NOTE:  'BLUE SKY' is a great track to check out especially if you're only 
familiar with their chart topper hits.  

I obtained this jewel from one of their shows at the House of Blues in 
Orlando, FL in 1999.
