,brodde87,2013-04-01T12:54Z,"Under the systems tab in control panel it says that my Windows is activated but in the taskbar a notification comes up from the action center telling me that I have to activate my Windows. Is it supposed to be like that?
Thanks for the up!"
,gtowndip,2013-04-02T03:25Z,brodde87 when you click activate windows on the action center it should take you to a page that says windows is activated if so just turn off that notification in action center.
,kingdomovhearts,2013-04-05T15:27Z,Is it possible to install updates with this version?

,Fausto99,2013-04-11T22:22Z,"Question: How much space do I need to create a bootable USB? The biggest one I own is 8GB... If it is not big enough, can I use a DVD or the tool is just to create a bootable USB?

Thanks in advance for your time. The torrent looks great, I am downloading it already. Thanks for uploading it!"
,gtowndip,2013-04-12T06:02Z,"@thisnameisavailable yes it is safe just allow it.
@fausto99 yes it is also a dvd tool but will require an 8 gb dvd, the usb will work but it will erase everything on it in order to put the iso image on it."
,smsmsmsmsmsmsm,2013-04-15T02:45Z,"Hi...i just downloaded and it works perfectly (so far), thanks a world to the creator.
One question, on the bottom of the page in ""control panel > system and security >system"", it says ""Windows is not activated,"" but when i click on ""view details in windows action,"" it says ""windows is activated.""
Is this how it's supposed to be? Thanks again"
,gtowndip,2013-04-15T05:03Z,@smsmsm... yes mine is the same just go to action center and turn off the activate windows notification.
