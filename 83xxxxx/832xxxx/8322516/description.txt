Hey gamemakers,
I made this program to allow you to export your games made in gamemaker studio to a standalone IPA file that can be installed on any iDevice.

This is useable no matter what version you have, from the free edition to the master collection, and it only requires iTunes to be installed. The IPA produced can then be submitted to a jailbroken appstore, and later support for .DEB to upload to cydia will be added. For windows, tested on Windows 8.
