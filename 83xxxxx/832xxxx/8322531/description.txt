Has everyday life gotten you down? Are you tired of not being an awesome wizard? Presto Chango! Transport yourself to the magical, mystical land of Lattice, where the would-be magician Hocus Pocus needs your wits and reflexes to complete the quest of his life! Terexin, leader of the Council of Wizards, has sent the untried apprentice on a special mission to prove his worthiness. To become a card-carrying, fancy hat wearing wizard, and claim the hand of his lady love, Hocus must conquer realms filled with unique dangers and enemies. Few have survived TerexinΓÇÖs final test because for many itΓÇÖs a one-way trip!

Help Hocus defy danger with potions that let him teleport and fire devastating energy blasts! Challenge dragons, demons, and other dastardly denizens of the dark! Go ahead, dabble in black magic -- we wonΓÇÖt tell a single soul! But hold on to your hat and tighten your cloak -- you could be in for a bumpy ride, in the 36 levels of this classic 1990s VGA-era platformer.
