Noise-rock/drone from Wellington New Zealand.



Combining sonic landscapes and atmosphere with a unique and fresh approach to the "average" noise-rock.


An Hero strive to not settle within a genre to avoid any restrictions or rules being placed on the pieces composed. The result is an often polarizing display of noise mixed with grooves.

From tracks like "Opium Eater" being a display of pure drone through to tracks like "All's I Know" being a 16 minute slab of psychedelic noise rock or "Shining Wizard" which begins with a more traditional post-rock approach before boarderign on thrash - An Hero can be an experience that you may not have heard the likes of before.
