Does it also works when it updates automatically?"
,opodin,2013-04-12T16:51Z,Can this be updated regularly without problems?
,klee777,2013-04-13T18:24Z,"I chose the auto-reset  option, but my program still says 30 days left of the trial. Is that supposed to happen? I see someone else said that theirs showed 800+ days left..."
,Bennemann,2013-05-02T06:15Z,I would not recommend using this antivirus. It automatically deletes files without any warning or confirmation screen and there does not seem to be a way to undelete them after it happens. Really really bad. Get an antivirus that actually cares about what YOU think of your files.
,XDubstep,2013-05-11T18:10Z,"Works great, reset works very well. Thanks a lot man.
