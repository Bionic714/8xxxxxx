Poco - Rose Of Cimarron (1976)

Poco is an American country rock band. It was formed by Richie Furay and Jim Messina following the demise of their band Buffalo Springfield in 1968. Although the band was considered highly innovative and survived a number of personnel changes, it achieved only limited commercial success during its lifetime, which ended when the group broke up in 1984. Since then, some of the members have "reformed" Poco in various groupings.

Rose Of Cimarron is the 11th album by the country rock band Poco. Former Loggins & Messina sax/fiddle player Al Garth steps in for a short period to cut this album, creating very strong, enjoyable, and (considered by some) under-appreciated music. A small but significant number of Poco fans find this to be the group's best album. The title track becomes a signature song for the group.
