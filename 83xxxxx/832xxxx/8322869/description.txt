Hugo is an orphan who lives in a Paris railway station, tending to the station clocks during his uncle's mysterious absence. 

He scrounges food from the vendors and steals mechanical parts from the owner of a toy shop, Georges Melies. 

In fact, Hugo's father was a watchmaker and he has inherited his father's talents for all things mechanical. 

Years before, Hugo's father found an intricate mechanical man, but they could never figure out how it worked. 

Hugo befriends Melies's ward, Isabelle, and together they have an adventure, one that centers around Melies himself.
