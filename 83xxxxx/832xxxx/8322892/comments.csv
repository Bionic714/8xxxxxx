I remember a few years ago trying to find this series complete, and so many episodes were poor quality or just plain missing. I can't thank you enough for providing this show in such amazing quality, since Warner Brothers won't give it to us here in America. Thank you."

Now, is this gonna be possible to download because those leechers are still downloading and it's gonna take some time before they can seed OR did 41 people just downloaded all these files from you and left ya hanging?
