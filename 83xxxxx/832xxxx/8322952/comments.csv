,muramura,2013-04-05T16:40Z,"Thank you, especially for CD2!"
,Happytodd,2013-04-07T04:07Z,"Thanks for this, however I'm getting 2 errors

C:Bioshock Infinite Soundtrack - Complete Collection.rar: Cannot create Bioshock Infinite Soundtrack (Complete Collection CD1) - 14 - Will The Circle Be Unbroken (Booker DeWitt & Elizabeth Short Version - Troy Baker & Courtnee Draper).mp3
    Total path and file name length must not exceed 260 characters
!   The system cannot find the path specified."
,dmmm123,2013-04-07T13:41Z,"@HappyTodd
You are trying to unrar the files in a folder that has a path that, in combination with the long filename, is way too long for windows to support, and thus can't create the copy of that file there. Just unrar it to C: or D: or whatever, a short path, and then shorten the name of the song so you don't get the error again."
,ccrocker58,2013-04-21T09:55Z,"Nice work man, was dying to get the songs that were omitted from the premium editions OST. The only inconsistency I found was in the song ""That Old Time Religion"" the version included in your up  is the Paramount Jubilee Singers version, however in game it's the Polk Miller version. Regardless, thanks a ton man!"
,Violentos,2013-04-27T16:21Z,"I downloaded this, unzipped it to a new folder and then attempted to add the files to iTunes. It gave me an error message saying the ""file name was invalid or too long"". Deleted it, re downloaded and tried again, same thing. Not sure what's up, but be warned people!"
,MetalMighty,2013-05-08T22:04Z,"Some artist names and song titles were missing, I replaced most of them. Here's my tracklist if any of you want to update your mp3s

,ubrf4x,2013-05-19T20:30Z,There are songs that are 64 KBPS on this. I could have gotten that off of youtube at better quality. :(
