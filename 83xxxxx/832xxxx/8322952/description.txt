Bioshock Infinite Soundtrack - Complete Collection

This torrent includes the official OST release included with the Premium Edition AND I extracted all the audio from the Bink (BNK) files and went looking for all the coversongs and radio songs that play during that game that were not included in the official Soundtrack.

Where possible I included higher quality versions of the same songs since the audio in the bnk files tended to be cropped and/or have extra record player "crackly" effects added to make them seems more old-timey sounding.
