Carl Smith - Hey Joe! [1951-1958) Bear Family CD (2010)


Carl Smith was a red-hot honky tonk singer, one of the first to use drums in his regular show, who often charted the wild side of life. Hey Joe!, his volume in the uptempo country boogie series Gonna Shake This Shack Tonight, includes 34 nuggets, virtually all of them from the mid- to late '50s except for a chugging 1960 cover of Eddie Cochran's "Cut Across Shorty." Rock fans may not find as much here to love as on a regular Carl Smith hits compilation, since Smith often led with a fiddle and left his guitar in the background, and even for country fans, it doesn't function as a greatest-hits compilation; aside from "Loose Talk" and the title track, his other hits were tear-jerkers or ballads. But Smith had few equals when it came to honky tonk in the '50s, and this is an excellent compilation of fun-loving tracks for those who want to hear more but don't feel like shelling out for the typical Bear Family box set.
