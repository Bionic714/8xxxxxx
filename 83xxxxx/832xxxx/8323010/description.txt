Q: My game does not work.
A: Try installing or updating DirectX and Visual C++ libraries.

Q: Is this release infected with a virus?
A: No, but a trainer is included and some antivirus may detect it as
   a virus. It is a false positive, but, if you have any doubt, just
   delete "trainer.exe" file because it is not necessary to play.

Q: Do I need Steam to play?
A: No.

Q: Does it work under 64-bit systems?
A: Yes.
