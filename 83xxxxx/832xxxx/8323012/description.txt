Bob Luman - 10 Years [1968-1977] - Bear Family 5CD (2000)



Somewhere between Elvis Country and Waylon Jennings resides Bob Luman, a former rock & roll artist who turned to country and enjoyed a healthy string of hits. This five-disc box set compiles everything Luman recorded for Epic and Polydor from 1968 until his death, including 30 Top 100 country hits. Except for a few K-Tel re-recordings, this box set is a complete chronicle of the last years of Luman's career. Luman was very consistent, the box and hardbound book are beautiful, and there are many lost gems on this set, but only the most ardent collector will shell out the high price for this import set. ~ Greg Adams 5-CD box set with book features Luman's years with Epic & Polydor from 1968-77, a year before his untimely death in 1978; contains the "return to roots" LP produced by Johnny Cash, a unreleased marathon session from 1974, rare sides & his latter-day hits Includes liner notes by Hank Davis. Producers include: Johnny Cash. LUMAN: 10 YEARS chronicles tracks Luman recorded for Epic and Polydor from 1968 to 1977.
