Though he's sometimes confused with the 1970s and `80s Scots R&B singer of the same name, the Frankie Miller collected here was a decorated Korean War hero from Texas who had several hits on the country music charts in the late `50s and early `60s. This extensive three-CD compilation from the German Bear Family label features all the honky-tonk artist's recordings for the Texas-based Starday label, as well as rare gospel material, live tracks, demos, and outtakes. (3-CD set) Blackland Farmer includes every 45 and album track Frankie Miller recorded for Starday Records plus the gospel EP and unissued material including alternate takes. In addition, this 3-CD-set includes live performances from the Big D Jamboree, p Dirty Linen (p.82) - "Rousing hits like 'Blackland Farmer' and 'Poppin' Johnny' are presented along with other gems, such as a couple of perfect duets with Dottie Sills."
