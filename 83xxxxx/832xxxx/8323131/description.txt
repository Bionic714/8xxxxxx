Art and Soul The World of Aboriginal Art
Hetti Perkins presents art + soul, a powerful and emotionally engaging television series about contemporary Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander art, and the artists who create it. An Eastern Arrernte and Kalkadoon desert woman, Hetti is senior curator of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander art at the Art Gallery of New South Wales, daughter of political activist Charles Perkins and sister of filmmaker Rachel Perkins (First Australians, Bran Nue Dae). 
With great generosity, she shares her extraordinary knowledge of Aboriginal art, visiting the homes and studios of artists in remote desert communities, the tropical top end, and in urban environments. She also brings personal anecdotes to the fore, recalling her family's own story, and her father's legacy: "Art for me is a way for our people to share stories and allow a wider community to understand our history and us as a people." 
Past and present, tradition and modernity, the imagination and individual experiences of artists, converge. Art + Soul views Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander art through a political prism, which allows for a richer appreciation of the artworks? And thereby of Aboriginal Australia and the life forces that underpin it. The series celebrates the survival and resilience of a whole culture.




3)  Bitter and Sweet 
How does the startling beauty - and humour - of Aboriginal art intertwine with reverberations of the past and our present? Gawirrin Gumana is the last surviving artist of the group of senior Yolngu men who painted the historic Yirrkala church panels, 1962-63. This eminent artist today resides at his clan lands of Gangan, which he refounded with his father Birrikitji during the outstation movement of the early 1970s. Gumana is now the ceremonial leader of the highest rank in the Yirritja moiety, and was ordained a minister of the Uniting Church in 1992. He was the winner of the Telstra National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Award in 2002, which recognised his talent and seniority as an artist. He was made a Member of the Order of Australia in 2003, and was an invitee to the Clemenger Contemporary Art Prize in 2003. In 2008 the High Court recognised Indigenous sea rights for the first time in the landmark case Gawirrin Gumana vs Northern Territory Government. This was the culmination of a ten-year struggle which Gumana first contributed to through the Saltwater - Yirrkala bark paintings of sea country touring exhibition and book, 1999-2001. In 2009 Gumana was awarded the Red Ochre Award for lifetime services to Indigenous art and culture.
