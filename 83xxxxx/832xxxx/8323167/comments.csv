Rotten Tomatoes gave this movie 54%."
,Pillmonster,2013-04-01T14:27Z,Btw thx for upload.
,bsitka409,2013-04-02T00:04Z,Just curious where anyone got Ridley Scott from.  He does not appear anywhere in the credits
,bsitka409,2013-04-02T00:06Z,Um  this movie wasn't directed by Ridley Scott. Not sure where anyone got that from.

,logan-x-art,2013-04-02T02:59Z,Ridley Scott...his name is at the top of the photo...fukn morons...
[V],steevo-be-thy-name,2013-04-02T03:28Z,"@ bsitka409 He didnt direct the movie he was one of 10 executive producers . Which begs the question , how many executive producers do you need for a movie ? the movie apparently cost 8.5 million to make , so i'm guessing half that went on wages for all these producers ."
,ironymon,2013-04-04T16:13Z,"money laundering, bunch of producers who do jack shit but supervise 1 day of 10 day filming. I could be wrong but mostly im not even if i am :D"
,DrMD,2013-04-04T21:16Z,"This movie is pretty freakin good, a lot better than most on here. A/V=10, some of the Brit slang may cause you to miss some spoken parts but this is a great DL and watch movie."
,isteal2,2013-04-05T01:02Z,"@Pillmonster go back to your barn, fucking sheep 'tard. 

I dont need some shit wipes telling me what I like. 
If you watched it then tell us what quality, otherwise fuck off"
,Farzin67,2013-04-05T05:53Z,"Thanks for the upload.
Quality is very good.
A/V: 9"
,Quinthas,2013-04-05T07:57Z,"Excellent film!!
V = 9
A = 10

Just goes to show that you can't trust Bull Shit sites like IMDB & Rotten Tomatoes, they are way better at cock sucking than rating movies. "

[ The Guilt Trip ]. No one has yet uploaded these movies."

,ThaWulf96,2013-04-07T16:04Z,"Ridley Scott is producing like 20+ movies if you look at his imdb page. Out of those 20 he's probably actually going to influence one or two of them. It's like what Tarantino did with the iron fist movie. He didn't direct it but put his name on it to boost sales. I actually liked the movie, but it wasn't up to my Tarantino standards. That being said this movie isn't horrible. a/v - 9 m - 7"

,23111988,2013-04-11T12:24Z,"Do you idiots even know what ""executive"" producer means?it means that person had done ZERO work on the film,otherwise they would have received the normal ""producer""title.Executive producer is a credit used to say thanks to a person that helped a film financially or by just adding their name to the cast to attract more financing or to promote the film.Very often even actors playing in the film receive this title,for various reasons,like attracting others actors to the cast,or taking a pay cut just because the budget couldn't afford their normal fee.

,libertaswv,2013-04-18T00:00Z,"Huh. Posted a link to the eng subs for this, but it seems some mod deleted it. It's not under this releases' title, but it is at s.scene. Fuck you very much, mod - Since when are genuine sub links deletable? Half the damn 'gosh i found this in hd at blahblah.bullshit' comments are left alone forever, but...? Lots of people fucking need subs, Mr. Triggerhappy.

Whatever... They're there, if anyone needs them Just check out the comments.

lol...Sry HeroMaster... guess that pissed me off a little.... Apologies for dropping a turd in your comments. Thx again for the up (that was in my original comment as well)"
