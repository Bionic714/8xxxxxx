Test Flights - Beyond the Limits

Technology Documentary hosted by Peter Lownds, published by Discovery Channel broadcasted as part of DC Wings series in 1998 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

Go behind-the-scenes at Dryden Flight Research Center, NASA's remote outpost where the world's top experimental flight researchers and pilots develop cutting-edge technology and flight test the world's most advanced aircraft. Here you'll get the very rare opportunity to experience the power of top aircraft like the X-1, the X-15, the X-33, the X-43 and many more.
This is the story of high risk and engineering genius, pushing the envelope to fly higher and faster. Like early explorers, these aeronautical adventurers travel where no one has gone before and share a passion to push the limits of speed, sometimes even risking death to improve and expand our horizons. This extraordinary production combines unprecedented camera access with never-before-seen test flight footage, and state of the art computer graphics.




2)  The Need for Speed 
Follow the latest quest for speed - to make "supersonic" speed practical, and "hypersonic" speed possible. Join us as we follow the latest experiments for the next generation of a supersonic passenger jet (High-Speed Civil Transport), and visit researchers who are working on an even more advanced high-speed concept - the Hyper X, designed to push hypersonic flight into the fiery inferno of Mach 8 ... and beyound. This is the story of courage, skill and determination which drove the early pioneers to fly faster than the speed of sound, and a celebration of the lives lost in solving the operational problems of the world's fastest fighter jets to make the SR-71 possible.
