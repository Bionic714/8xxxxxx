Very much appreciated.
Have been enjoying vol. 1 &2.
V = 10, A = 10."
,da_grub,2013-04-02T01:44Z,"Brilliant. I converted the files in the ""Stream"" folder to MKV files using mkvmerge, Then patched the mkv file with mkclean and renamed the individual files to their artist and song name. Now I can play them on a media player in mkv format :D

Thanks very much for these demo discs :D"
,frodo1111,2013-04-04T22:52Z,"Cool, but don't your player plays .m2ts files also? Maybe you don't even have to use mkvmerge..Did you tried to play .m2ts ?"
,da_grub,2013-04-05T13:17Z,"I have them playing with plex on the Samsung tv app, it seams to play MKV's better for some reason (even though .m2ts is pretty much the same). I have successfully downloaded Vol. 1 & 2 but with this volume I am still stuck on 62.1 percent"
,frodo1111,2013-04-05T23:43Z,"Oh, you use plex. I've recently been playing with PS3 Media Server and it works great with Samsung 2012 TV models as server for .m2ts....
Sorry to hear that you're stuck at 62%, i have my PC on 24/7, but there is only one seed.... i hope the dl speed will improve in the next days"
,Chartsandgrafs,2013-04-08T20:45Z,"Yeah, thanks for these collections, Frodo.  They are simply stunning.  

I'm using Handbrake to clip them down into individual MKV files with DTS audio and then play them through Media Browser.  The average size is around 450-500 MB.

Looking forward to volume 4.    "

,frodo1111,2013-05-06T22:22Z,here is THX movie testing disc : http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8445673
,frodo1111,2013-06-03T20:51Z,"If you don't own an Blu-Ray burner, you can easily and very quick convert individual .m2ts clips (in folder BDMV-STREAM) without re-encoding to .mkv with MKVToolnix. "
