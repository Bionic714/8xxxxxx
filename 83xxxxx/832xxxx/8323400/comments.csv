This file is a .cbr, so open it up in winrar or another program that opens up .rar files, extract the files, and then re-rar the files or re-zip the files, giving it the appropriate extension - .cbz if it is zipped up, .cbr if it is a rar-ed up.

You can also just extract the files and read the jpeg's inside."
