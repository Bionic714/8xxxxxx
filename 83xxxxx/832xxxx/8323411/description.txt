From the creator of Image's HOAX HUNTERS and newcomer Drew Zucker comes SKYBREAKER, a dark tale of revenge set in the Wild West. Skybreaker is a man of two worlds, half Sioux and half Christian. When these worlds clash, he is betrayed and left for dead and now it's time for revenge. SKYBREAKER explores the violent roots of American life, and how you can never kill your way to peace.
