Ajay Singh meets with pretty Asha Chibber, and is led to believe that she is wealthy. After a few misunderstandings, he does find out that she is from a poor family. Both do fall in love, and Ajay goes to meet with Asha's brother, Dr.O.P. Chibber, and his wife, Shanti. They are pleased with this alliance, and arrangements are made for Ajay's mom, Gayetridevi to visit them and approve of Asha, which is done. Subsequently, Ajay and Asha are married, and settle down. Asha is expected to give birth to a baby boy as a heir to the Singh family. Unfortunately, she is unable to do so, and even worse -loses her eye-sight and becomes dependent on Ajay. Frustrated at this, Gayetridevi decides to ask Asha to leave the house, and arranges a second marriage for Ajay, with results that will change the lives of everyone around them.
