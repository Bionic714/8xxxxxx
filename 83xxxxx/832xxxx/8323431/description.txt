All of Bud Sagendorf's covers are brilliant genius, but this sports his greatest of all-one of the classic covers of comics history! And you can judge this comic by its cover. . . Popeye, Wimpy and Swee' Pea are the hilarious cast in the rollicking fun comic 'On the House.'
 
The backup feature with Sappo and Watasnozzle has to be seen to be believed for it's astonishing surrealness!
 
Plus two Popeye-and one Swee' Pea-mini-features. All beautifully reproduced on high-quality paper.
