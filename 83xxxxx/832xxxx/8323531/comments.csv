First of all thanks for sharing this one with extras !!

Usually i download torrents from trusted and vip. while i was searching for Anchorman, i noticed you but didn't download it. Yesterday while searching for Clerks i saw your rip again and decided to browse your other torrents, wondering who is this guy?

But you really are doing a great job on basis of doing very rare movies barely touched by most uploaders. And your description about the movie is much helpful.It's great and keep the good work. BTW i downloaded both Clerks and Anchorman !!!

I hope you will get your skull soon :)"
,jalucian,2013-03-31T21:20Z,"@ onlyHD, Thank you for your comment. From what I have gathered, it seems like it takes around 60 good torrents to earn a skull so I have about 20 more to go. YIFY and dhjudasx were two of my inspirations and reasons that I got into encoding - guys who get the file size down to a minimum without compromising the quality of the picture. The high bitrate torrents are fine for people who want to watch on 50"" HD screens, but for the vast majority who just watch movies on their computers or smaller TVs, the large file size torrents are just a pain in the ass. The trick is having enough knowledge and experience to know how low you can set the bitrate and other x264 settings without causing any pixelation or artifacts during playback. My bitrates are about 15% or so higher than YIFYs so my file sizes aren't *quite* as small, but I do my audio at 160kbps because I prefer to retain ""CD quality"" audio and YIFY shaves his down to 96kbps or so, but I don't mind having slightly bigger file sizes if it means additional quality.

That may answer the ""who is this guy"" question a bit for you. Thank you again for your comment and check back in a month or two for that skull! :)"
,SuperMarioBroMen,2013-03-31T22:17Z,subtitles?
,jalucian,2013-04-01T07:43Z,"English subs are included, as you can see from both the notes and the file list.  If you need foreign language subs, you can find almost anything you need from subscene.com. "
