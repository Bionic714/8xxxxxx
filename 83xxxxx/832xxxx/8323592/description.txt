Due to a surge in cultural studies of antiquity, the communication of power has perhaps received more scholarly attention than the branches of government. This trend has become immensely influential, as it helps us to disclose the tacit assumptions underlying the exercise of political power. But, as a result, the understanding of government itself has fallen behind.

This Companion offers a modern, comprehensive volume on Greek government, detailing the variety of constitutions and types of governing bodies in the Greek world. It constitutes an all-new standard reference work, with an overall focus on institutions and state action, while also addressing, through individual contributions, recent scholarship on ancient Greek political culture.

The book covers the wide range of governmental action in Greek antiquity. It explores the multiple manifestations of state action throughout the Greek world. It considers a broad selection of city-states, and governmental realms beyond the polis.
