2013 - THE YEAR IN CHRISTIAN MUSIC
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Happy Easter to all of my Christian Brothers and Sisters out there reading this today.  It is my prayer that you allow Him to set deep roots in your heart, and that perhaps by some small measure, He uses the messages within these Christian songs to keep you anchored, obedient, and humble.

We're now on our 11th bundle on the year.  For those keeping count at home, that brings us up 309 releases for 2013.  Not too bad for the first quarter of the year.

For anyone interested, here's a quick break down of this bundle.  Again, I may be off on some of my genres, but I have these listed accordingly.  For those looking for Rock, we have The Advice, Finding Favour, Hawk Nelson, JJ Weeks Band, Paramore, and Phil King.  For those Country fans out there, Alan Jackson just released his "Precious Memories, Vol 2" album to compliment Vol 1 from a few years back.  If you're looking for Hip-Hop / Rap, there's plenty to choose from including Andy Mineo, Benjah, Cheno Lyfe, Dorian Grey, Jadee Lamez, JG, Joey Prophet, and Selah The Corner.  Contemporary fans?  How about Anthem Lights and Michael English?  Under Pop you might enjoy Aprilemade, David Archuleta, and Shawn McDonald.  Under Praise & Worship you might enjoy Bridge Music, and The Orchard Church.  If you're into something a little more heavy, we have four to choose from under the Metal / Hardcore genre including The Color Morale, Hope For The Dying, Phinehas, and Sinners To Saints.  Dance?  How about DJ Cmd.  Alternative?  How about LifePoint Music.  Or maybe you just want to relax to a nice Instrumental, then check out The Reveille.  And for Acoustic we have Ryan Furr's "Hymns EP" release.
