Horsemeat Banquet
The Horsemeat Banquet is a piece of bold factual theatre which takes the hook of the horsemeat scandal to look at the truth about what we eat. It follows a bunch of opinionated BBC Three viewers as they take part in a decadent banquet, during which they'll learn the truth about the meat they currently eat and confront their taboos as well as get a taste of what they'll be eating in the future. It is presented by Rick 
Edwards.
