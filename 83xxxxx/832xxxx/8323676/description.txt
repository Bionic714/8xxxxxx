This is Adam Ant live at the intimate and wonderful venue Mr Kyps, Poole, Dorset, England recorded on the 20th June 2011. Mr Kyps is a popular venue for tribute bands, however there have been a good number of bands and artists who have 'cut their teeth' at venues like this and gone on to greater glories, and acts such as Adam Ant who enjoy the interaction with a close up audience.

I did some minor editing on this to remove gaps between tracks. I hate gaps in a concert recording.
