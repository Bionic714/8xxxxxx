,MikeXRyan,2013-04-01T18:03Z,"I'm jumping thru four proxies and using two separate P2P apps to get this package to you.  I'm going to need you guys to seed a bit longer than usual because my packages will be large in size.  It is easier to upload full siterips then individual files.  

If your P2P app allows you to look at the package before you start downloading and offers the option to avoid those files (in the group) you already have, then uncheck them.  Take only what you don't have but keep it seeding.  

It kills me that no one else in the gay community has come along to offer high quality files but I understand it isn't easy, takes a lot of your personal time, and puts you at risk for complaints from your ISP.  I wholly endorse commercial proxy companies like GTGuard (Avoid Hide Your Ass) even if it costs you $5-10 a month it is well worth the anonymity."
