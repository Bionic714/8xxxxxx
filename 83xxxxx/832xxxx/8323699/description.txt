A collection of music videos from Queen.  Most of these videos come from Queen's Greatest Flix compilation, so there's a bit of overlap with the beginning and end of each video.  There was no way to do a clean edit, but they are still very watchable.  All videos are AVI and the quality is good to excellent.  No logos here.
