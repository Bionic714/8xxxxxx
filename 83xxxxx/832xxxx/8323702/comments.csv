,bananabre,2013-03-31T18:17Z,Is it dubbed over english? With hard coded chinese subs?
[V],Gh0stNet,2013-03-31T18:31Z,only thing i can is that in the release info it says that the language is English. 
,djjloco,2013-03-31T18:50Z,lol
[V],QborT,2013-03-31T19:45Z,"This is NOT English

it is a typo in the NFO, the movie is supposed to be Cantonese, but this is an HDTV rip from the mainland so the audio is Mandarin dubbed..

Again, Not English.  Mandarin dubbed.  With hardcoded simplified Chinese subs."
