Debut EP of Orbicide - Ex Falso Quodlibet - is raw dark / harsh electro with black metal style vocals. Orbicide band members say that nowadays dark electro became soft and lost a lot of its original harshness and energy. Thus, their own music is harsh, raw and unpolished. The release consists of 6 original songs and 6 remixes.
