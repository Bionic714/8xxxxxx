Summaries:

FRAGMENT
In this powerhouse of suspenseΓÇöas brilliantly imagined as Jurassic Park and The RuinsΓÇöscientists have made a startling discovery: a fragment of a lost continent, an island with an ecosystem unlike any theyΓÇÖve seen before . . . an ecosystem that could topple ours like a house of cards. 

The time is now. The place is the Trident, a long-range research vessel hired by the reality TV show Sealife. Aboard is a cast of ambitious young scientists. With a director dying for drama, tiny Henders Island might be just what the show needs. Until the first scientist sets foot on HendersΓÇöand the ultimate test of survival begins . . .

For when they reach the islandΓÇÖs shores, scientists are utterly unprepared for what they findΓÇöcreatures unlike any ever recorded in natural history. This is not a lost world frozen in time, an island of mutants, or a lab where science has gone mad: this is the Earth as it might have looked after evolving on a separate path for half a billion years.

Soon the scientists will stumble on something more shocking than anything humanity has ever encountered: because among the terrors of Henders Island, one life form defies any scientific theoryΓÇöand must be saved at any cost. - Goodreads Summary of Fragment


PANDEMONIUM
Deep beneath the Ural Mountains, in an underground city carved out by slave labor during the darkest hours of the Cold War, ancient caverns hold exotic and dangerous life-forms that have evolved in isolation for countless millennia. Cut off from the surface world, an entire ecosystem of bizarre subterranean species has survived undetectedΓÇöuntil now.

Biologists Nell and Geoffrey Binswanger barely survived their last encounter with terrifying, invasive creatures that threatened to engulf the planet. They think the danger is over until a ruthless Russian tycoon lures them to his underground metropolis, where they find themselves confronted by a vicious menagerie of biological horrors from their pastΓÇöand by entirely new breeds of voracious predators. Now theyΓÇÖre rising up from the bowels of the Earth to consume the world as we know it.

USA Today praised Warren Fahy's debut novel, Fragment, as ΓÇ£a rollicking tale [that] will enthrall readers of Jurassic Park and The Ruins.ΓÇ¥ Now Fahy sets off an even more thrilling stampede of action and suspense, bursting forth from the hellish depths of...Pandemonium. - Goodreads Summary of Pandemonium

Note: Fragment and Pandemonium are two separate books, by the same great author. Warren Fahy doesn't have many well-known books, but he is a great author!
Tell you right off the bat this is heavy in suspense, mystery, and action! Recommendable for those who love lost worlds, and humans fighting for their own survival. A book everybody will love!
