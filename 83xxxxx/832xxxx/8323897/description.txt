He sets off with Eugene (an electrocuted Russian rocker) to find her, and they pick up a hitchhiker, Mikal, whoΓÇÖs looking for the People in Charge, believing sheΓÇÖs there by mistake. TheyΓÇÖre soon at the camp of Kneller, where casual miracles proliferate. They hear rumors of a miraculous king. Can Zia find Desiree? Then what? Where thereΓÇÖs death thereΓÇÖs hope.
