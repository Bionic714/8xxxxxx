,croaker68,2013-05-18T03:32Z,"If anyone else gets the message saying ""This file is damaged, move it to the trash,"" don't worry, the file isn't damaged. Your Mac just thinks it is because the original code of the software has been modified (where it's been cracked so you no longer need a serial number).

Simply go into SYSTEM PREFERENCES > SECURITY & PRIVACY and click ""Allow applications downloaded from: Anywhere"".

Final Cut Pro should now open.

Thanks to 80sCop for the solution."
,BazzBro88,2013-05-18T16:37Z,This works perfect! And it gets the updates from Apple without a problem! Thanks for the program!
