As the title suggests, Have I Offended Someone? contains all of Zappa's notoriously tasteless parodies and satires, from "Bobby Brown Goes Down," "Catholic Girls," and "Jewish Princess" to "He's So Gay," "Titties 'n Beer," and "Dinah-Moe Humm." Nearly all of the tracks are presented in new remixed versions, and two songs, "Dumb All Over" and "Tinsel Town Rebellion," have never been released before. Tinkering with the sound of the songs doesn't change their impact at all -- this is the material that made Zappa into an adolescent favorite during the late '70s and early '80s and, in a sense, that makes Have I Offended Someone? a best-of collection, even though only "Valley Girl" was a hit. In other words, for some Zappa fans, this collection is everything they loved about him, and for most of his detractors, it's everything they always hated about him.
