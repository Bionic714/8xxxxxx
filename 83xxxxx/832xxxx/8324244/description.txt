As some of you may remember, I wrote an article before about the hilarious video of Super Mario and Luigi playing around with a portal gun. Or rather, Mario did, which pissed the hell out of Luigi. What would happen if you actually got to play Super Mario with a portal gun? Is that even possible, and would it be fun? The Portal II video game has become a huge hit, and it seems like everyone is playing it. ItΓÇÖs a puzzle solving first person game in which you will cause no casualties more than a few broken computers and some chips. Whatever it is that makes people, by the millions, buy this game and play it is of course difficult to say more than itΓÇÖs really cool.

What would happen when you mash it up with Super MarioΓÇª for real? I mean, the REAL gameplay would be awesome, right? Can you imagine in your head what it would be like having a portal gun at your disposal? If you have played Portal I or II, you know exactly what it would be like. If you havenΓÇÖt, we could have a problem. Good thing I found a clip on YouTube that totally shows you what it would be all about.
