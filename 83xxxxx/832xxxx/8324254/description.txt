This is the unabridged recording of Stephen E. Ambrose's definitive three volume biography of Richard M. Nixon:

      Nixon Vol 1: The Education of a Politician, 1913-1962
      Nixon Vol 2: Triumph of a Politician, 1962-1972
      Nixon Vol 3: Ruin & Recovery of a Politician, 1973-1990

These volumes were originally produced in the early 1990's by Books on Tape, Inc. and read by John MacDonald.  Each volume contained two parts, each part containing nine or ten 90 minute cassette tapes.  Volumes 1 and 3 contained herein are from this release, so that each associated mp3 file is approximately 45 minutes long.

Volume 2 was later re-released by Blackstone Audio (via Simon & Schuster Audio) on CD, read by Michael Wells.  It is this version that Volume 2 contained herein comes.  Track lengths are more reasonable (about 5 minutes or so).
