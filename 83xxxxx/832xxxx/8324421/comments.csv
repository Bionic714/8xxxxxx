,thegr8luiz,2013-04-20T04:03Z,"Five comments and no one cares to say thanks to the uploader for all his work? If I were a James Bond fan, I wouldn't think twice about downloading this torrent. Besides, I would be very grateful to the person who took of their time to upload and share these high-quality files with me and others. Kudos to thenoobish!"

,frankmazuca,2013-05-11T00:03Z,"some people are such morons. i got a torrent with hundreds of songs of a particularly musician and some jackass complained the words were not capitalized. Who Cares i am grateful for the work other do, even for a movie that i can not understand as i don't understand Russian. Thank you for your work."
