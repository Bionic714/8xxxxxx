Technic beta launcher from http://www.technicpack.net

In order to play, register for a freely available Minecraft account and use it to log in. The usual cracked Minecraft limitations still apply, such as not being able to play on any server that isn't "offline" or "cracked"

This one will properly set your username after login, rather than the generic "Player"

Please feel free to point out any issues or problems you may find so that I can address them as soon as I am able to.
