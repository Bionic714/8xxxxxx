,guidoanselmi,2013-05-30T04:03Z,"I suppose Leonard Bernstein was disappointed - Ian didn't turn out to be the second coming of Bob Dylan - and after Bernstein's famed endorsement on national television, her career sputtered out after her first LP and didn't catch fire again until ""At 17"" years later. But was a statement that LP was, opening, of course, with ""Society's Child."" A couple of tracks are rather embarrassing 50 years on, but what record that old doesn't have one or two? ""Hair of Spun Gold"" still moves me, as does the anguish and need for love ringing through ""Lover Be Kindly."" 
All the material from the first LP is in stereo, except ""Society's Child,"" which was probably mixed for AM radio was never remixed for the LP."
