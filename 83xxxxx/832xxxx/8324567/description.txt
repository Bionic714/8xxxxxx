MisterMusic Show - 247    (2 hours)  192kbps MP3

I've got new music on this week's show by Generationals, Wire, House of Love,
and more new tracks from the latest Depeche Mode and Black Angels albums.
And a huge hit from April 1992 is the 'Oldie of the Week'.

Keeping you ahead of the curve with new music and mixing it with classic hits from
over 5 decades, it's The MisterMusic Show.
