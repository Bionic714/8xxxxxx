Steve Coogan stars in this three-part bittersweet comedy 
about a family man's fight against his own gambling addiction. 
Set in the north of England, Coogan plays Bing, 
a man who's determined to provide for himself and his family, 
as long as his lines eventually come up at the bookies. 
He never has much luck, but his wife (Lisa Millett)
still loves the cheery soul who always looks on the bright side, 
especially when he's losing, which he mostly does. 
Although his father George (Bernard Hill) helps him out occasionally, 
his gambling addiction eventually ends up losing him his job, 
home and family. Bing realises things have to change - and fast.
