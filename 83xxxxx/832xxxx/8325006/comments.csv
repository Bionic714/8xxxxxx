,EpicWolf,2013-05-13T21:36Z,"TO INSTALL:

1.  Burn/mount image.
2. Install
3. go to you virtual BD-ROM (It should show up as an icon in ""my computer"" and there is where the Skidrow File is
4.open the skidrow file and copy everything inside it.
5. go to the instalation file (C:Program Files (x86)EA GamesKingdoms of Amalur Reckoning) and paste all files in there.
6. MAKE SURE TO COPY/REPLACE
7. enjoy!

If step 5+6 do not work at first, do it again, it helped me."
