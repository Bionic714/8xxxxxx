A RE-DO of my 5th upload DEXTER PLAYS (1955) 12-AUG-012

It's smart to check your files/CDR's to avoid duplication.



No additional comment other than emphasizing how great this music is.


Comprising 3 sessions from SEP 1955...the first 6 tracks previously

released as the LP: DADDY PLAYS THE HORN...Bethlehem Records  



The 12-AUG-012 upload hogged 785MB (uncompressed .wav) no pics incl.


This replacement includes pics and uses only 400 MB with no sacrifice

in Fidelity. 



LOSSLESS Compression FOREVER!
