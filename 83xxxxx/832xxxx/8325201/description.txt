This is just a short addendum to my previous file from yesterday of the fabulous Jim Starlin.
 
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8321788/Jim_Starlin_Cosmic_Chronological_Collection

I cut off the Dreadstar collection earlier than I intended to so here I am including the rest of the issues with writing by Jim, and all the rest of the Dreadstar run (some written by Peter David, a cool dude in his own right).  Also included are a few more issues written by Jim Starlin.  You can just drop these folders in with the previous batch.
These are not my scans.  I have been in awe of the folks that turn out such amazing scans and you will find most scans are tagged by their makers.   Let us hope that the sharing continues.

This collection has issues from 1976-1993.

These issues are from First, Malibu, Marvel, and DC

The format of all the files is either .cbr or .cbz and the language is ENGLISH
