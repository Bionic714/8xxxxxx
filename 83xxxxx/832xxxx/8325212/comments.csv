Sound is CAM sound so a little low and muddled but you can hear well enough.  
Video is missing a few seconds at the beginning, no credits. Appears to be filmed from side theater seating.  Losing some action on borders but main action is there. 
Rated on CAM Standards:
A=6 
V=6 "
,ioio32l,2013-04-01T13:36Z,"Worst CAM I've EVER seen. It isn't centered, and it's zoomed in to one spot that barely contains any action. The moron who filmed this should have just zoomed out to capture the ENTIRE screen and cropped it later. Instead he moves the cam around a lot and makes this copy hiariously stupid and shitty."
,x.morbid.x,2013-04-01T22:21Z,@ioio321  Then you haven't seen a lot of CAMs.  Give your opinion but don't forget to appreciate that people risked fines and jail to deliver movies you don't have to watch or pay for.
