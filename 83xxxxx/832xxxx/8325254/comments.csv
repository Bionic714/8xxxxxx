,noitisnt,2013-04-01T04:33Z,"Will it work with 10.8.3? Also, 586MB seems a bit small compared to the PC version's 1.32GBs..."
,korgaillo,2013-04-01T06:36Z,"You're right, the game sucks :D

It's not tested on Lion or Mountain Lion, I made this port in Wineskin and I works in Snow Leopard, no way to test it in other OS (if anyone can test it comment, please). 

586Mb compressed, 1.63Gb full application. Enjoy and seed please"
,xFreakxx,2013-04-01T20:46Z,Is the game really that bad :S?
,4hincbc,2013-04-02T02:59Z,"When I open mine it just goes all black and does nothing 

Any suggestions on why? 

And who else has this problem ?"
