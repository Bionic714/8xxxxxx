  100 min   -  Comedy
IMDb Rating: 6.1
Stars: Steve Carell, Luke Vanek, Steve Buscemi, Jim Carrey, James Gandolfini, Alan Arkin & Olivia Wilde
Storyline:-
Superstar magicians Burt Wonderstone (Steve Carell) and Anton Marvelton (Steve Buscemi) have ruled the Las Vegas Strip for years, raking in millions with illusions as big as Burt's growing ego. But lately the duo's greatest deception is their public friendship, while secretly they've grown to loathe each other. Facing cutthroat competition from guerrilla street magician Steve Gray (Jim Carrey), whose cult following surges with each outrageous stunt, even their show is starting to look stale. But there's still a chance Burt and Anton can save the act - both onstage and off - if only Burt can get back in touch with what made him love magic in the first place. "

Sound is CAM sound so a little low and muddled but you can hear well enough.  
Video is missing a few seconds at the beginning, no credits. Appears to be filmed from side theater seating.  Losing some action on borders but main action is there. 
Rated on CAM Standards:
A=6 
V=6 "
