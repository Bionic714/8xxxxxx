Hopefully, in the next few months I'll be releasing a Ver. 3.1 - as complete and up to date as can be. 

And in case any kind soul out there would like to help out, I'm still missing the following audio books: 

""Contractions in Action"" 
""All I Really Know I Learned From Watching Star Trek"" (Unabridged)
""Boldly Live as You Have Never Lived Before: (Unauthorized and Unexpected) Life Lessons From Star Trek""
""Nitpicker's Fun & Games for Classic Trekkers"" 
""Nitpicker's Fun & Games for Next Generation Trekkers"" 

As well as the music albums of Tim Russ and Robert Picardo. Any help would be greatly appreciated."
