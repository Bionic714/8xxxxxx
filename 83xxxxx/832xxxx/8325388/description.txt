INSIDE STAR TREK is a comprehensive look at the development and life of a
television and cultural phenomenon. It is also the story no one else could
tell. Between them, Solow and Justman had a hand in virtually every aspect
of the development and production of Star Trek.

Star Trek - Memories (William Shatner - 1993)

While many books have attempted to tell the real, behind the scenes
Trek story, the tale can best be told through the voice and privileged
perspective of a man who actually lived through it all. That man is
William Shatner (aka Captain James Kirk).

the final season of the original Trek, through his somewhat lean in between

production of the first seven feature films.
