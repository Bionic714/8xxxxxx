"Be Safe and Don't Hit a Cow"

Teams are caught in an African speed trap
jeopardizing their future on the Race, and for
the first time, Racers put their skills to the
test when asked to waterski with crocodiles

Rules are unclear if a show such as this would
be 'reality' or 'competitive reality'. Due to
this being a literal race involving lots of
running and high motion we went with
'competitive'
