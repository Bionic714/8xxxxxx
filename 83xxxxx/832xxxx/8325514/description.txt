Berserk: Ohgon jidai hen 2 – dorudorei koryaku hen (2012) aka Berserk: The Golden Age Arc 2 – The Battle for Doldrey

Plot: The Band of the Hawk, led by the seemingly invincible Griffith, has risen to great heights in the Midland army, and are now on their way to seizing victory in the One Hundred Yearsâ™ War. However, during a critical battle against Chuderâ™s Blue Whale heavy assault knights, Caska and Guts find themselves falling from a high cliff into the river below. Though they are still alive, Caska is ill and unconscious, so Guts finds shelter for them to take cover in. But now their problems are piling up exponentially: Guts and Caska need to survive and find their way back to the Hawks safely, an entire platoon of enemy soldiers is actively searching for them, and should they make it out alive, the final battle to end the great war, the besieging of Castle Doldrey, still looms over the horizon.
