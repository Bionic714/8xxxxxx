,CaelaHarlot,2013-04-01T05:12Z,This REALLY needs seeders. Something that normally downloads in 20 minutes shouldn't be saying 4 weeks.
,schmim64,2013-04-01T05:13Z,"I have my upload speed allocation set to 2kb/sec so you guys aren't getting much from me.  You live to serve me, not the other way around. :)"
