,Jaminb,2013-04-01T11:17Z,"Iv seen about this show twice now on TorrentFreak, no idea what it is but it seems good.
Normally i would just torrent it and check it out but because of what the director and the HBO programming president said about piracy i decided to buy the first episode off itunes for a mere 99 Cents.
If i like it i may just buy the entire season.
If not for piracy i would have gone on not knowing about this show, if not for directors and HBO programming presidents stating piracy is good i wouldn't have bought it. But i did and may end up buying every season. Its downloading off itunes now."

,darksyphos,2013-04-01T22:31Z,"Never in a million years oh my gosh and it keeps going up every minute. And SikDuc, in case you for some reason didn't see the other 2 seasons of the show, it continues on as if there is no season change, Game of Thrones doesn't stick to that ""Season end, big reveal/cliff-hanger, next season premier follow-up, discovery"" model that most shows use. It just goes. Regardless, the premier just means we get to watch a new one every week now "
,SikDuc,2013-04-02T00:04Z,"Thanks for the comment DarkSyphos. I know this isn't the forum to comment on the content of the show so I apologize. But I counted 12 sub-plots on this season opened. 12! That gives each about 3-5 minutes and we 'move along'. Maybe if I had watched the previous 2 seasons I would 'get it' but right now it's just 'way too much'.

Again... the quality of the video and audio were superb... fast download. Everyone enjoy! :)"
,Robtarded39354,2013-04-02T01:26Z,"@SikDuc, it was honestly a bit much for me even though I started on season 1, but honestly you cannot criticize a show when you've only seen one episode on the third season."
,Fritz.,2013-04-02T02:00Z,"The show is outstanding if you like the genre.

however darksyphos is talking out his ass.

they ended season 2 with the army of dead walkers heading to war which was a giant cliffhanger.

its cool to like the show, but just making shit up to try and defend it only hurts your cause. "

 But yes the premier wasn't your stereotypical season premier...since these are closely based on a book series HBO can't just throw in a crazy beginning out of nowhere hahaha"
