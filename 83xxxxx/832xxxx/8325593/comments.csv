,MrWabbit,2013-04-01T04:40Z,Please seed and many thanks for the quick upload. 
,spied1,2013-04-01T04:59Z,"Thank you. Any source with avi-afg coming for this, Doctor Who s07e06 Bells of St Johns and Game of Thrones s03e01? Thank you all."
,Arup02,2013-04-01T05:04Z,Thank you.
,Gerbil2k,2013-04-01T05:36Z,Nuked! Audio glitches. Get repacked version.
,bilago,2013-04-01T05:48Z,"At 42 minutes in, the audio cuts out and then starts playing from an earlier scene, makes the last 10 minutes of this show unwatchable.... I guess I'll have to DL from somewhere else this time"
,Gerbil2k,2013-04-01T05:56Z,"Just get the repacked version instead.

,CurlyJeff,2013-04-01T06:01Z,So this proves that ettv and eztv are the same distributors because both their torrents had the same fuck up and are both now releasing a repack
,shitwinds,2013-04-01T06:19Z,"Fine until the last 10 minutes or so. At around the 40 minute mark the audio suddenly reverts back to a previous scene. Then around 43 minutes it just goes black. The last 7 minutes are just blacked out, no audio, no nothing. "
,arineon,2013-04-01T06:58Z,Audio messed up. Get REPACK version.
,tdawg2345,2013-04-01T07:34Z,"For those with the sound problem, you aren't missing the last 10 minutes, only about 2 minutes of cinematography that ends the episode

you aren't missing much"
,TargetTango,2013-04-01T08:55Z,"http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8325828/The_Walking_Dead_S03E16_iNTERNAL_HDTV_x264-2HD%5Bettv%5D

That one works."
,APAULCOLYPSE,2013-04-01T09:17Z,"Yeah, you dont miss anything, once the screen goes black, that's the end of the show. 

I downloaded the 720p version and watched the ending and it was the same, just a piano for a few seconds and then the credits. "

,snotty66,2013-04-01T11:07Z,Thanks your the best
,oldbreadbutt,2013-04-01T11:12Z,"fantastic up untill the last 10 minutes or so when the audio flips out completely. going for the repack (also from eztv)

,rbbyrob,2013-04-01T11:23Z,"last 8 min audio is bad, audio from 5 min earlier plays over the last few minutes"
,rbbyrob,2013-04-01T11:24Z,"repack from same uploader eztv is fine, don't download this one."
,HaoleGuy,2013-04-01T12:00Z,Bad audio on last eight minutes.
,markahm,2013-04-01T12:01Z,Yeah don't bother with the repack if you already downloaded this one.  All you miss is 30 seconds or so of scenery with the occasional walker.  
,e8hffff,2013-04-01T12:23Z,Audio is much lower than normal levels.
,floss666,2013-04-01T13:04Z,This one is fucked.
,kisorsosay,2013-04-01T15:09Z,"Download the Repack, this one is broken at the worst possible point.  But thank you for resubmitting it correctly."
,4n3n1gm4,2013-04-01T15:55Z,Confirmed: Audio is fubar @ 41:30 +/- get repack
,bil_gr7,2013-04-01T15:55Z,"Oh come on! At the last ten minutes the audio gets fucked up. Why the hell did you upload it? It ruined the finale for me, damn it. Now I have to stop it at 42 minutes, wait for an hour to download the correct version and watch the last ten minutes."
,Lustikurre,2013-04-01T18:09Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS VERSION AS THE AUDIO LOOPS BACK AT THE END.

Get another torrent, because the sound bugs out near the end and jumps back like 30 mins.

YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!"
,loganbarbosa,2013-04-01T20:05Z,DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS VERSION AS THE AUDIO LOOPS BACK AT THE END. 
,hmendoza,2013-04-02T02:02Z,DO NOT DOWNLOAD!! WASTE OF TIME
,scuzz08,2013-04-02T02:31Z,"ERIC GETS KILLED IN THIS EPISODE.

SPOILER ALERT!"
,FakeHater67,2013-04-08T12:34Z,audio out of sync 2b nice
