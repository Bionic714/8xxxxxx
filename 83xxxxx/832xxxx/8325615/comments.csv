,sandl1on,2013-04-04T13:57Z,"@rockjael...it's an opinion. It's not yours. 

I share it, and I've watched a lot of good TV..especially being British which is where some of the best TV is made"
,sandl1on,2013-04-04T14:18Z,Also thank you Famouz....appreciate your time and effort for this upload

,msporredoss,2013-04-06T05:08Z,Thanks a bunch I will seed over night but I don't have much bandwidth so I hope it helps.
,Nutinurgut,2013-04-08T05:43Z,"@sandl1on

Um...what? British tv is where the best is made?
Like what, Downtown abbey? The only good british television was Monty Python, and maybe Benny Hill if you're into that kind of humor. Ntm this show is headlined by british actors and you can see how terrible the acting is."
,brajpop,2013-04-08T06:47Z,"Amazing, thank you ! Since I have unlimited bandwidth I will seed for a while...people need to seed more though ! "
,OkBluesFan,2013-04-08T19:14Z,"I'm not bitching - just an fyi.  The last few minutes of the final episode still has some audio/white screen issues.  I downloaded this about 2/3 days ago.  Don't know if you've fixed it since then.  I've seeded for awhile.  I appreciate the dl.  

Thank you very much,"
,Brea14,2013-04-14T17:51Z,"Thank you FaMoUz, you're the best for HD TV!!!"

,youcifer,2013-05-06T00:53Z,YO _ Has anyone else had problems with the picture and sound being out of sync? (I've only downloaded e01) I'm using VLC media player so it shouldn't be a codec matter. Cheers.
,MizzIves,2013-05-15T03:27Z,Thanks from China! TV here suuuuuuuuucks. 
,sidadoo,2013-05-17T23:19Z,WOW with how badly you fucked up the last part of the season finale I can honestly tell people not to download this. Even though the rest worked a mistake like that is unacceptable 
,beowulf22,2013-05-21T05:52Z,"Ep 16 is broken, all else is fine."
,UnTimELyDeMiSe,2013-05-27T10:49Z,yup episode 16 ...41/49 minutes in audio cuts out and reverts back to when they were behind the car before they come for the blonde andrea women... and continues on till the end its just audio from that part... real strange
,deathnet,2013-06-01T02:06Z,"God this is fucking sad, 1430 seeders and only downloading at 40kb/s, what the fuck come on guys!!!

I know its not my service(10m), so come on people!"
,MacMan397,2013-06-04T19:09Z,PLEASE SEED!
,digitalhoarder1,2013-06-06T16:39Z,"One of the greatest shows I've seen. Walking Dead is a must-see for all the zombiephiles out there.

Thanks for this excellent upload......  except for the last episode (s3.ep16). Audio repeats itself in the last minutes. Don't download the last episode! It will ruin the ending. It will ruin your experience. 

Download the last ep somewhere else."
