,komradw,2013-04-01T17:04Z,Freaken sweet! thank you!!
[T],MrUnpopular,2013-04-02T01:45Z,What's your source for these?
,putetriple,2013-04-02T02:47Z,"It's a ""special"" episode directed/written by david o'reilly.

As he said on twitter, the quality of the leak is pretty bad but knowing his work/style, it's made to be weird (episode title is a hint).

He also said he don't really cared about piracy but he prefer that people see it in good quality to fully enjoy the cartoon."
