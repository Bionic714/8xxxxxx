Another early Adventure Time leak.  This episode doesn't seem like the real thing because it's incredibly bizarre with different animation but it's the legit episode.  If you don't believe me, look at my profile - I was the first one to leak Simon & Marcy last week.  It's high def quality.  I'll seed for a day or two, just like last week.
