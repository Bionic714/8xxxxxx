,IntoTheWild7779,2013-04-01T07:27Z,"Ending? 
Audio bad like the other? Anyone?"
,COcvt,2013-04-01T07:31Z,"Seriously can someone comment about the audio on this one, please?  I'm so excited to watch the season finale, but it seems all the other ones have this audio problem at the 40 min mark?  I don't want to wait 2 hours (assuming) to dl this just to find out the same thing."
,soupygbs,2013-04-01T07:55Z,lol still no comment about the audio....
,Noplaying,2013-04-01T08:25Z,"DibyaTPB, the name itself is already enough to prove anything, I doubt the problematic version you  all are referring to is HD version, there's no way you are done downloading them with shitloads of leechers and to complain about it on every other thread."
,Wiseguydude,2013-04-01T08:30Z,SOMEBODY PLEASE TELL US IF THE AUDIO SCREWS UP AT THE ENDING. THANK YOU. HAVE A NICE DAY

,richkla,2013-04-01T11:06Z,"...audio update...?!?!
From TRUSTED and very much reliable upldr?!?
Can't believe there are ppl who are asking for an 'audio update' !!  lol  
Like it's some pc/psx game upl or whatever
Yes, there are uploads of this episode with sound issues, but you'll sure not get it from Dibya !! (Thanx btw! Great job)
So, be patient, stop waining, download it & see it for your self.
Oh.. and you could thank the uploader for the effort couse you're getting it FOR FREE !"
