,Triton8719,2013-04-01T06:55Z,"This was a comment I left on the 350 MB version of this, I would assume this version is the same....

What a shitty upload, at the 40 min mark, the audio loops back to about half way through the episode, then the screen blacks out shortly after. Thanks for ruining the end of the season for me. Don't download ANYTHING from this user, TvTeam, terrible. "
,Wiseguydude,2013-04-01T07:20Z,So can anyone confirm if the audio messes up at 40 minutes? Please tell me cuz I need to know if I should stop downloading it.
,kiwij,2013-04-01T07:37Z,2nd shitty upload within the last 15 minutes.  GoT S03E01 also has encoding errors.  Groups in such a hurry to release they doing a shitty job.
,heL1x,2013-04-01T07:39Z,"Calm the fuck down, its been happening to every other download from Evolve too on the same episode, the same 43 mins cuts out to the sound at around 34 mins into the episode."

  [[[Fux0r this so-called REPACK! It has the same damn audio & video blackout issues as the earlier releases! Yes, the issues got partially resolved, that is to say, the problems seem to have been shortened, but it's still there!

Thanks for wasting my time, don't download, this is streets behind!

And oh, Beth, Glenn & Hershel dies in this season-ending episode. *****"
