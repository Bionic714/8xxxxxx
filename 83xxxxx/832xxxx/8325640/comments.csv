,Felidae17,2013-04-01T10:30Z,"Some files are missing. No gauges? No .cab?
Doesn't work for me. Just one panel view aso
Thanks anyway for trying"
,dennIT,2013-04-01T11:29Z,"@ felidae17 strange, after a quick fsx install, sp1 and sp2, for me working fine, without a glitch.All gauges and views are working.Anyone else has the same problem???"
,dennIT,2013-04-01T11:34Z,you have to drag and drop the whole folder in simobjects/airplanes folder and should it work fine
,spudkiss,2013-04-01T17:25Z,just curious dennit. is this your own torrent or have you installed it using the .exe or rip 
,Felidae17,2013-04-01T19:49Z,OK! I give it a second try
,dennIT,2013-04-01T20:07Z,"hi spudkiss, this is not my own release, found somewhere in other site.Like I said I dnt have any problem with this airplane, run fine, sounds too."
,Felidae17,2013-04-01T23:00Z,"OK. It works now. But I'm still surprised of the poor quality of what I get. The Lionheart is much better.  Only one panel view, no zoom on the instruments, uso. See the panel.cfg. If it is actually all what the Aerosoft has to offer, Thanks for avoiding me to waste my money.:) "
,Metthos,2013-04-07T21:20Z,"Thanks.
Works fine, however I think LionHeart is a better add on."
