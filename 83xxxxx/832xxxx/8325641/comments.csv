,tegris,2013-04-01T06:05Z,is this one better?
,tegris,2013-04-01T06:24Z,"I'm glad it is fixed and I know better than to bitch about free shit, but it sucks that for once we would have been better off to avoid ettv for the season finale..."
,B0b_D0le,2013-04-01T06:31Z,"This one has  NO audio sync problem (for me, if you do, maybe try a different player?)"
,Minty_Winty,2013-04-01T06:43Z,"Why was the ep with messed audio 49 minutes, and this one is only 42 minutes?  What the F is going on with this torrent tonight of all nights?

BTW, the audio is indeed fixed, just hard to know/trust if it's the complete episode or not."
,lucasmontec,2013-04-01T06:45Z,loliliketospoilthings is just an asshole. The audio is perfectly fine in this one.
,fu_manchu,2013-04-01T06:47Z,stupid file doesnt even play.. wtf is this shit?. tried vlc and mediaplayer on 2 pcs!!! fuck this crap
,Minty_Winty,2013-04-01T06:48Z,"It is also the full episode, the repack just doesn't include the credits."

,paag88,2013-04-01T06:52Z,@loliliketospoilthings... you know... maybe I will!!  
,Amatyi1,2013-04-01T06:53Z,"I can't believe everyone is acting like an ass. I've been downloading ettv's torrents for a while and never had a problem. Does everyone realize that to upload torrents you have to take time out of your day and do this FOR FREE, so everyone that doesn't have cable or for some reason can't watch this on TV, can watch it for free. Thank you ettv for uploading the walking dead and other shows that I watch so I can watch it for free. Everyone else get off your high horse and don't look a gift horse in the mouth. One problem out of all the torrents he uploads (and he fixed it) I think that's pretty damn good."
,Amatyi1,2013-04-01T06:57Z,Oh and thanks for uploading walking dead and vampire diaries so fast every week
,tegris,2013-04-01T07:03Z,"@Amatyi1 I wasn't talking shit. God knows no one does this as well as ettv, i was only commenting on the unfortunate timing of this fuck up. I bet it was just a pressure deadline trying to keep all of us happy, it is just frustrating to dl for an hour and have to start a fresh dl for the last 8 mins "
,MrAlyx,2013-04-01T07:12Z,"Half the dip shits are saying it wont play, the other half say the audio is fucked.

anywhore I've always trusted ettv and he generally has good torrent so I'm going to try this anyway because i trust him."
,firestorm_1st,2013-04-01T07:38Z,"This Torrent is fine, there is very little actually missed off the missynced torrent. This one plays straight through and only shows the final 60seconds or so. The remaining 5 - 6 minutes is only the credits.

But for those that wanna hear properly sync'd music playing for 60seconds or so then watch the credits - go for it.

My point is - congrats to ETTV for reacting so quickly to repack this, those who havn't seen the last 60seconds or so with sync'd audio don't panic your not actually missing much. Feel free to download this though as you will get to watch the final 60seconds or so with properly sync'd audio."
,TandemFrost,2013-04-01T07:40Z,"@Amatyi1 You sound like a whiney little bitch.  (Do you realize the trouble someone has to go through... waaaah.)  First off... YOU aren't the one uploading.  Don't you think this guy can defend himself?  Second of all, you don't even swear... once.  Ass and damn don't count.  Fuck, shit, motherfucker, cocksucker, dipshit.  Those are man words.  Faggots say shit like, ""asshat,"" or ""assclown.""  Get a fucking life.  Maybe YOU should stop bitching and upload this episode, prick.  And stop talking about horses!  What are you, some equestrian?"
,TandemFrost,2013-04-01T07:42Z,"@tegris And you are riding Amatyi!'s dick.  So, I really can't say which is worse."
,TandemFrost,2013-04-01T07:45Z,"@lucasmontec  Lol.  I love your diplomacy.  The audio is fixed... Lolli is just an asshole.  Ha ha ha.  Well, I'll try it... it better be fixed.  Or I'll be the next asshole in here.  ...Not.  I don't have the energy for that shit."
,ReLoaDitt,2013-04-01T07:50Z,"Yea even though the audio messed up on the other one, you dont miss anything at all. just a piano playing as the new ppl go into the jail, nothing else is said. So dont bother to dl this if you watched the previous upload with audio problems. Thanks though ettv"
,ReLoaDitt,2013-04-01T07:56Z,"Also, why must everyone always rage on every torrent download? If you are unhappy with the download, go elsewhere, its free. How can you complain. Punch some holes in your wall if your so angry."
,m3nt4t,2013-04-01T08:17Z,"Fuck this so-called REPACK! It has the same damn audio & video blackout issues as the earlier releases! Yes, the issues got partially resolved, that is to say, the problems seem to have been shortened, but it's still there!

Thanks for wasting my time, don't download, this is streets behind!

And oh, Beth, Glenn & Hershel dies in this season-ending episode."
,Chibimoonbunny,2013-04-01T08:23Z,Guess internet isn't just for porn...there's plenty of trolls as well. Thanks for the vid ettv and keep up the good work.- ^_^-

,APAULCOLYPSE,2013-04-01T09:19Z,"Yeah, you dont miss anything, once the screen goes black, that's the end of the show. 

I downloaded the 720p version and watched the ending and it was the same, just a piano for a few seconds and then the credits. "
,andrew808,2013-04-01T09:22Z,DONT DOWNLAOD! Ending ruined with no audio...

,igivenofux,2013-04-01T18:16Z,"fucking faggot ettv, learn how to check your fucking video before you upload it with the last 10 minutes of it fucked up. do you know how stupidly fucking annoying that was? stupid cunt, i will never download anything from you again, just going straight to eztv."
,jmacc,2013-04-07T22:30Z,Excelente aporte
