,YarrKodak,2013-04-01T23:16Z,"tinoz, I have the same problem trying to play this on my PS3 with PMS.

I get a high pitched sound and no voices around 3 minutes in.

I get it with several releases; pretty much any HD releases I can find."
,superlol1,2013-04-02T00:24Z,Would you fuck off with your PS3 bullshit and just get a tv with a HD-in. It may have made some sense to bother with all that years ago now you are WASTING YOUR TIME.
