,Triton8719,2013-04-01T06:57Z,"This was a comment I left on the 350 MB version of this, I would assume this version is the same....

What a shitty upload, at the 40 min mark, the audio loops back to about half way through the episode, then the screen blacks out shortly after. Thanks for ruining the end of the season for me. Don't download ANYTHING from this user, TvTeam, terrible. "
,ice_cold1011,2013-04-01T07:38Z,I just check the ending and it was good.. Thanks
,m3nt4t,2013-04-01T08:16Z,"Fuck this so-called REPACK! It has the same damn audio & video blackout issues as the earlier releases! Yes, the issues got partially resolved, that is to say, the problems seem to have been shortened, but it's still there!

Thanks for wasting my time, don't download, this is streets behind!

And oh, Beth, Glenn & Hershel dies in this season-ending episode."

,cleoh,2013-04-01T09:05Z,The end is fixed but it's cut down to 42:45 from the other 49:56 version but it ends at a natural spot. 
,ice_cold1011,2013-04-01T13:06Z,"This one is  the full length show, the others were messed up at the end so they ran longer, thats all it is.."
