You did what you told someone you were going to do!  Give you a fucking cookie.  This guy didn't even do that!"

,Pureblood89,2013-04-01T13:42Z,"The Walking Dead season 3 finale was a big let down in my opinion, It was very boring and anti-climactic, didn't really wrap anything up.

*Spoiler Alert* The prison fight was really boring, just smoke grenades and some machine gun fire, nobody dies but the Governor's people get cold feet and run away. The Governor shoots his own people that ran away from the prison fight and then just drives off into the sunset. Milton gets stabbed by the Governor and then becomes the walker that bites Andrea. Andrea commits suicide after getting bitten. Carl kills a kid instead of letting him surrender. All the old and sick people left at Woodberry move into the prison after being abandoned by the Governor."

Here are the details:

@41:36 minutes, the audio rolls back to audio from 34:26 minutes

@42:44 minutes, the show ENDS and fades out. This is the real ending! The last 7 min 12 sec must be an error EZTV didn't want to fix or remove. 

**** The episode is perfect until the end. However, even when the audio is jammed the rest of the episode is still rolling and completely watchable. I'm sure it is just some type of sad/hopeful music that is playing in the background while it fades to end. ****"
