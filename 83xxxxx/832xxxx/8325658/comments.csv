,Triton8719,2013-04-01T06:54Z,"This was a comment I left on the 350 MB version of this, I would assume this version is the same....

What a shitty upload, at the 40 min mark, the audio loops back to about half way through the episode, then the screen blacks out shortly after. Thanks for ruining the end of the season for me. Don't download ANYTHING from this user, TvTeam, terrible. "
,Music_Is_My_Life,2013-04-01T07:21Z,The audio at the end is fine on this one. Thanks!
,indymama,2013-04-01T08:43Z,All that patience for nothing! The audio is fine but there are no more lines! Nothing else fucking happens!
