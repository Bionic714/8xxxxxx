Start8 by Stardock is a small application that, when installed, allows Windows 8 users the use of the traditional start menu. As an added bonus, it also allows Windows 8 users to automatically boot to the desktop whenever signing on to their PCs and Laptops. If you do not like the new Windows 8 interface and would prefer the traditional Windows desktop experience, then this is the app for you!

Once installed, use this serial number to register the program: D2A9B-B485F-C0A95-97797-6668F-5FD9A

Afterwards, be sure to uncheck the "Automatically check for updates once a week" check box in the "About" screen of the Configure panel.

Enjoy!
