,Conchaga,2013-04-01T09:25Z,"I'll confirm that the audio glitch seen in the .mp4 uploads from eztv and ettv is NOT present in this copy.  

If anyone manages to find a .mp4 version that has fixed the glitch, link it here."
,labwiz,2013-04-01T09:30Z,TVTeam usually good but the audio is fucked at the 40:33 mark. No audio for the last few minutes.
,belllatrix,2013-04-01T14:45Z,Worked just fine for me. Thanks for the upload.
