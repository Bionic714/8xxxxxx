What a shitty upload, at the 40 min mark, the audio loops back to about half way through the episode, then the screen black out shortly after. Thanks for ruining the end of the season for me. Don't download ANYTHING from this user, TvTeam, terrible. "
,phelpz,2013-04-01T07:18Z,"It's the encoder not the uploader. Most of the time they are the exact same file uploaded by different people.  It looks like this is a different version than the other one with the audio problems.  
I'll comment once it is finished downloading."

I checked the Whole video, Everything was Fine!

Thanks TvTeam

The above commentor is wrong"
,phelpz,2013-04-01T07:27Z,No issues with the audio on this one.  The other one was not missing any actual scenes.  The show ends where it cuts off.
