If Eliott Smith were an ocean, and Jack Johnson the beach, then the shoreline where they meet would be Timmy Curran. When he wasn't surfing California crests, he was picking out tunes on the guitar. It's been a long ride, but he's finally released his first album, Word of Mouth, and it was worth the wait. Word of Mouth is beachy, but it's definitely not a pop album.

There's something dark in tracks like "Comatose," where a violin gently weeps in the background. The songs are mostly quiet; not terribly deep or heavy, but, with the exception of a few, not descriptively bubbly. However, it is the released single from the album, called "Blue Eyes," that makes Curran. That song is a marriage of country and bongo; the lyrics may not be terribly introspective, but it's a catchy track. This is definitely a summery album, and that song in particular is the middle of July on a beautiful morning. Curran, who was considered to have been a pioneer of surfing's "aerial revolution" during the 1990's, is still a professional on the waves, but now he's riding the stage as well. He's ripping through the Floridian coast as I type, but Word of Mouth comes out tomorrow: dip your toes in the water.
