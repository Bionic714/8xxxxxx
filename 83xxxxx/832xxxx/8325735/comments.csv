,thebeav111,2013-04-01T06:27Z,can anyone comment on whether this one has the incorrect audio as well please?
,shottoto,2013-04-01T06:34Z,"This one has incorrect audio as well, I assume. This file along with the ettv and the other ones the same size all seem to have incorrect audio. :L"
,Zogboat2,2013-04-01T06:52Z,"Yes, the audio is BADLY OUT OF SYNCH on this video."
,thebeav111,2013-04-01T07:45Z,"I don't think it's out of sync, I think it's for a different episode"
,groovdog,2013-04-01T11:53Z,Wow they are screwing the pooch over Easter. First Walking Dead now this. Let me guess the GoT premier?
,MidgetKungFu,2013-04-01T17:10Z,I'm quite certain the audio for this is from an older episode. Damn. :(
