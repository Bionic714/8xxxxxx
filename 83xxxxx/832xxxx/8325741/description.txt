.: Plot :.
New sitcom written by the creators of The Office and Extras, Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant.

The show centres on Warwick Davis, Britain's pre-eminent dwarf actor and star of box office hit movies such as Star Wars, Willow and Harry Potter.

Life's Too Short is an observation comedy which follows Warwick's day-to-day life in a small world where big things happen. It's a frustrating world, but an optimistic and warm one.

Gervais told The Radio Times: "It's about his life: the life of a showbiz dwarf. He plays himself, we play ourselves, it's sort of like Curb Your Enthusiasm."

He later added at the Banff World Television Festival: "It's the funniest thing we've ever done." He said this comedy would be "pure funny" without the pathos of The Office or the drama of Extras. "Warwick, in real life, is an actor and runs a company so we are taking that and skewing it. We are giving him small man complex, making him jealous, manipulative and self-obessed. He'll run a company called Dwarves for Hire but steals all the jobs."
