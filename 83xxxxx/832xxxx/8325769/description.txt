Tagging notes:
Show information is embedded within the header of each flac file. 
It will display on any player capable of directly playing flac files. 
If converted to wav during processing, all tags will be stripped, 
however audio data will remain unaffected. 
If you must transcode to a lossy format, do so directly Flac &gt; Lossy.
Use ffp to validate audio integrity.
Md5 values will change if tagging is altered.
