,shitwinds,2013-04-01T06:24Z,Anyone know if the last 10 minutes is fucked up on this one too? The first two I tried from eztv and ettv both had audio issues around 40m and then the video and audio both went completely black at around 43 minutes. Thanks for the effort though eztv! I'm going to let go of the shitrope and fall into the fucking shitabyss if I don't get that last 10 minutes soon! :)
,SOPASUX,2013-04-01T06:53Z,Pissed me off that the last 10 minutes are fubar as well. Can't seem to find a torrent that isn't the same inbred piece of shit.
,Bzbstxi,2013-04-01T07:06Z,"Seriously?
I've got 3 different versions of The Walking Dead, with ""repack""s and whatnot, downloading at the moment.
Same thing with Game of Thrones.
Great times..."
,whateveryou,2013-04-01T07:52Z,"Audio messes up at the very end.  A few seconds are lost, but it's annoying..."
,frenchconnections,2013-04-01T08:18Z,Having ONLY watched the final screen/end credits the sound seems to be fine.
,m3nt4t,2013-04-01T08:19Z,"Fuck this so-called REPACK! It has the same damn audio & video blackout issues as the earlier releases! Yes, the issues got partially resolved, that is to say, the problems seem to have been shortened, but it's still there!

Thanks for wasting my time, don't download, this is streets behind!

And oh, Beth, Glenn & Hershel dies in this season-ending episode."
,bulletproofAllahuAkbar,2013-04-01T08:47Z,Works fine. Audio too. Allahu akbar!

,idreezy1,2013-04-01T13:20Z,"Don't worry guys, that dude's spoilers are fake. :)"
,schmolch,2013-04-01T14:22Z,I just watched the whole thing and everything is fine. There are no video or audio issues. 
,dubblue4,2013-04-01T14:23Z,thanks
,knight.sr,2013-04-01T15:12Z,"S/10 V/10. No issues on this. Fully watched it on both VLC and UMPlayer. 

Not that it was bad, but I was expecting a better episode for this rather good season's ender though."
,bezerker34,2013-04-01T17:46Z,"ANDREA DIES, BECOMES A WALKER.. MY DREAMS HAVE COME TRUE"
,raymac_6262,2013-04-01T21:33Z,"A10/V10 

No issues. 

PS
Fuck off to the assholes writing spoilers."
,JoaoPauloBR,2013-04-01T23:30Z,Love you waldorfx. Thanks for the subs :D
,captkong,2013-04-02T01:23Z,"Is there any dialog in the last 10 minutes? I'd rather not download this if I'm not missing much.

Thx eztv"
,Killher,2013-04-02T01:29Z,eztv should kill itself.
,scuzz08,2013-04-02T02:24Z,Why the hell did they kill off Eric? I never would have seen that coming.
,Goldfire1986,2013-04-06T09:22Z,"The video is fine, from start to finish
The audio is fine, from start to finish

There are some horrible trolling attempts in the comments section."
,krikri3,2013-04-07T02:23Z,"if you don't want spoilers stop reading the fucking comments.
you ppl need to use your brain logically"
