They need to learn that it isn't who's first, it's who's best. Focus on Good quality at lowest possible file size without degrading past desired quality (720p, 480p, etc)

does your comment mean this version is corrupt too?"
,Cyph3r19,2013-04-01T06:54Z,"Don't forget QCF with the 1080p and some 1080i that gets pushed ""=). Guess the web dl won't count since not scene release.

Oh and thanks TvTeam"
[T],trialNerror,2013-04-01T06:57Z,"They need to stop ""racing"". That's scene's biggest downfall is the race crap. It's extremely unorganized when 4 different groups record the same 1 show just to see who can shit it out first. Guess what? There could've been 3 other good shows recorded by the other groups and the 1 group doing this show could've put an extra minute in it to make sure it was right the first time."
,th3m4ster,2013-04-01T07:09Z,maybe i should wait for the re-repack?
,Bzbstxi,2013-04-01T07:14Z,"@Grondaivor

Indeed. This is ridiculous.
I hope at least 1 of these releases I'm downloading at the moment are proper.

I've got 3 different versions of this going, and the same amount of ""The Walking Dead"", and no clue which, if any, are ok rips........."
,th3m4ster,2013-04-01T07:28Z,"@trialNerror   AMEN. when you say an extra minute, that's seriously all it takes. Keep producing shit and people will slowly move away."
,bobisnowhere,2013-04-01T08:51Z,"So is this a proper repack or is it just more crummy encoded bullshit released just to say ""FIRST LOL""? These release groups need to realize that we don't give a shit about it being first if it's not even properly encoded. I'd MUCH rather wait another hour or two and avoid shit like THIS which just takes more time and bandwidth in the end. 

So, good/bad? Anyone that ISN'T just going to point fingers at other rg's?"

,LackThereof,2013-04-02T01:37Z,"Good quality, watched it last night, no significant issues that I remember.

As is typical, the low-contrast scenes in blowing snow ""north of the wall"" looked grainy and had artifacts (mostly haloing/ringing).  The rest of the episode was pretty much flawless.  

I understand that those are the most difficult scenes to encode and need a much higher bitrate than the rest of the episode... but when people are trying to get stuff encoded and released in real-time, there's just no practical way to do that.  It would take slow, 2-pass encoding, or constant quality/VBR encoding with unpredictable file sizes."
