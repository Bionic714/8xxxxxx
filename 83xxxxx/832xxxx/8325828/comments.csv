,toughlaps,2013-04-01T07:50Z,"@DarylsNumberOneFan You're downloading this for free. If you want to watch the episode without a corrupt ending, pay for it or watch it on TV. Ungrateful cunt. Stop complaining."
,ScubaGolfSex,2013-04-01T07:51Z,"If you're reposting because something was fixed, HOW ABOUT SAYING SO SO WE DON'T WASTE OUR FUCKING TIME AGAIN! IS THIS AUDIO FIXED OR NOT?!?!?"
,The_Chob,2013-04-01T07:53Z,"This is the worst peice of sh-t ive ever seen. I thought the last 5 episodes were bad. Alot happens, but, whoever is incharge needs to be shot for ruening this show. It had stupid flaws since the begining, but now there is nothing entertaining about it. Just annoying, poorly thought out, random events. So many things to b-tch about, but i wont spoil it.  "
,ArkhosBlack,2013-04-01T07:57Z,"I downloaded and checked at 37 minutes.  At that point , there was no issue.  Audio checked and video too. 

If there is any problem with this torrent , is beyond this point.  "

,cnut1220,2013-04-01T08:10Z,This one works but I was not happy to learn all this trouble was for about 20 seconds of music...no talking whatsoever. LAME
,manuelg1985,2013-04-01T08:12Z,Thanks a lot ettv
,m3nt4t,2013-04-01T08:21Z,"Fuck this so-called REPACK! It has the same damn audio & video blackout issues as the earlier releases! Yes, the issues got partially resolved, that is to say, the problems seem to have been shortened, but it's still there!

Thanks for wasting my time, don't download, this is streets behind!

And oh, Beth, Glenn & Hershel dies in this season-ending episode."

,bobisnowhere,2013-04-01T08:54Z,"Whoever is posting spoilers IN ALL FUCKING CAPS deserves to be castrated slowly and painfully while everything they love is spoiled right in front of them. FUCK. YOU. You take all the fun out of the entire purpose of watching a show and every single person on the PLANET hates you. KILL YOURSELVES.

Thanks uploader."
,exo452,2013-04-01T09:48Z,"the speed, sucks ass. SEED!"

,ddurham,2013-04-01T11:51Z,"... AND cmon guys, have some respect, and please don't post spoilers in the comments. That's just really childish and immature. And especially on the the finale of such a big series that all of us fans have been waiting for. Please have common decency. Thank you. "

So he has some mistakes.. Big fucking deal.  If you can do better than he can, where are your fucking captures?"
,warrenf75,2013-04-01T23:49Z,I thought discussion on here was about quality of torrent not social commentary??!!
