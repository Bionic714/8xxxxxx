,deformaty,2013-04-01T08:02Z,Audio is fixed.  Complete episode.
,m3nt4t,2013-04-01T08:22Z,"Fuck this so-called REPACK! It has the same damn audio & video blackout issues as the earlier releases! Yes, the issues got partially resolved, that is to say, the problems seem to have been shortened, but it's still there!

Thanks for wasting my time, don't download, this is streets behind!

And oh, Beth, Glenn & Hershel dies in this season-ending episode."
,kmw1201,2013-04-01T09:35Z,Why post spoilers? you are the definition of a cunt
,Klaxxxon,2013-04-01T09:46Z,"Don't listen to m3nt4t, he is a douche and has posted the same fake-ass spoilers on every torrent. 

Unlike ettv/eztv/TvTeam and whatever other dusty motherfuckers have been uploading, this torrent is legit. Sound works all the way to the end, no glitching, you get everything including the end credits and the shitty hammed-up preview for Mad Men at the end. 

Bear in mind the fact that the audio and video work doesn't make this any better of an episode. Props to xxxlavalxxx for being the only person to upload a working torrent, though."
