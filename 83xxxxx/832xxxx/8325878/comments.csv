,poffik,2013-04-01T21:11Z,"1st April, jokes on you!"
,obvious2me,2013-04-02T00:06Z,Always go with VLC. It's one of the only programs that TONS of people recommend that actually lives up to the praise. It has played every file I've come across and has run them all perfectly.
,WhitePrideWorldwide,2013-04-07T22:55Z,"VLC is pure shit, learn how to use a proper media player, nooblord."
,Mr_Heisenberg,2013-04-09T07:09Z,"^So we shouldn't use vlc but instead we should download an inferior program and then also download 10 codec packs for it to play everything, your the noob bro........."
,bwbunny9,2013-04-13T08:00Z,"Thank you eztv, I have never had a problem with any of your stuff, and it's always up here quickly and with great quality. Much appreciated."
