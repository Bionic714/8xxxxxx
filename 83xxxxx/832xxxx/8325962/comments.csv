,MikeyMetal,2013-04-01T23:11Z,Public HD is full of hit & run arseholes...waste of time. It'll take you a month to get it. Such bullshit.
,Zamzumin,2013-04-01T23:51Z,"The ""previously on Game of Thrones"" and ""next time on Game of Thrones"" segments are encoded in stereo, but the rest of the episode is in 5.1 surround. All of the releases on here are like that, it's how HBO broadcasts it. I tested this release and it is indeed 5.1"
,kyo9,2013-04-02T02:53Z,"my pc is normally capable of playing some of the other smaller gb files, but i'm curious as to why i'm getting such low fps with this one.  is the lag due to its res or is there a codec that i'm missing?"
,Zamzumin,2013-04-09T17:44Z,"@kyo9
Most HD videos are encoded in H.264, but this one is MPEG2. You'll need an MPEG2 video decoder to handle the video decoding and the deinterlacing. MPC-HC has one built in that I use and it works fine. VLC should be able to handle it, if you want to go the easy route."
