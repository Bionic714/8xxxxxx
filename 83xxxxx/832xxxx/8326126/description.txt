This is an improved version of a book available here:

My great thanks to the original uploader.

John Yudkin - Pure, White and Deadly (Penguin, 1988). 200 pages.

I've split the pages and processed them with Scan Tailor, then combined them into a new pdf and applied clearscan, added pagination and metadata, and added the contents to bookmarks. The result is a small, high quality file that can be read on a wide range of devices.

In his youtube video "Sugar: The Bitter Truth," Robert Lustig demonstrates that sugar is a poison. Along the way he cites this book by John Yudkin approvingly as the first one to accurately describe the problem. Lustig himself has a recent book out called Fat Chance, and I've included it in this torrent (epub, mobi formats) as well.

For a quick look at Lustig's approach, take a look at The Colbert Report for 28 March:
