It's the ""less than"" symbol that breaks it. Goddamnit, the coders at TPB need to have their heads bashed together.
--- (continued) ---
VFD with file copy allows you to make a (""LESS THAN SYMBOL"")1mb RAR file accessible to DR-DOS or Hiren's DOS in a virtual floppy. Wireless drivers in MiniXP along with improved Ethernet and storage support. Mini Linux provided by RIP Linux. Bootable partition and imaging utilities provided by Acronis True Image and EASEUS Partition Manager. Improved Memtest86+ with failsafe mode to resolve startup hangs. Kon-Boot 1.1 is really v1.1 now, with support for 32-bit and 64-bit Windows. Tons of new utilities in MiniXP with new launchers to provide easier access. ERD 5.0 is integrated with MiniXP for offline system restore and service/driver management, and Microsoft DaRT 6.5 (x86 and x64) are added to support Windows Vista and 7. Antivirus scanning with real-time updates is provided by DaRT 6.5's Standalone System Sweeper, and allows you to load definitions to a USB stick for live updating.

This ain't yo mama's BartPE compilation.

Once you dive into this disc, you'll never need another boot CD.

4.6, Apr-1-13:  Many modifications to MiniXP. AHCI/RAID support (not quite
                universal yet due to architecture). Firefox update with Flash
                support. Memtest86 instead of Memtest86+. Streamlined boot menu
                configuration. Made USB setup easier with BootICE. ImageX front
                and center on the desktop now, as well as some additional new
                icons. Vastly improved MiniXP startup process. PDF, Word, Excel
                file viewing support. Replaced a billion references to outdated
                portable Opera browser in MiniXP with Firefox. Much improved
                network driver support. Battery support. Power management
                support (no longer roasts laptop CPUs while in MiniXP). Added
                keyboard switcher in tray. More sane date/time display."

Easy way for you to work right out of your house :) Well thanks man your UBCD has been more help then you could possible know. Keep up the good work!"
[V],FalconFour,2013-04-01T11:56Z,"I'd even be happy doing mail-order computer repair. Hit me up on the official F4UBCD page - let's see if TPB doesn't filter this out: ""eff bee dot com slash"" f4ubcd (it apparently filtered out ""eff-bee"" in the description - my god, TPB are URL nazis)"
,chop007,2013-04-01T14:29Z,"Awesome F4 this has saved me many missions. If I could offer you a job I would but I am a Gynecologist, so there is only really space for one at a time, and there are so many of us these days I am thinking of changing my profession, getting tired of reading smelly pussies all day. Any ways, thanks bro.  "
