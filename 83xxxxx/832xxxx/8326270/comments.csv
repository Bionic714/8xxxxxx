,tofumunch,2013-04-01T21:06Z,knew there would be a 1080p version! thx so much!!!
,esuave,2013-04-04T16:56Z,"Thx BUT while file itself plays well, mkvmerge spits out reason 2 timecode errors when trying to remove the subtitles, resulting in an unplayable. Converting in Handbrake (to strip out the subtitles) causes the program to crash. 

There's a problem in there obviously, so a wod to the wise: this is only good for those who don't mind having to watch with subtitles. "

because you are a noob
hahaha"
,esuave,2013-04-05T13:35Z,"Oh, yeah, that's right, jack012. I must be a noob. 

How utterly foolish of me to think that I could simply add the file to mkvmerge, deselect the S_TEXT track, set the output filename and directory, and then just hit the demux button and expect no errors. 

Clearly, I should have checked the McGuffin woblet selector box, set the nunlickets to off, and farted three times. 

You've certainly put me in my place. Oh, the shame I feel! I shall never live it down.  "
,esuave,2013-04-05T14:34Z,"My bad, I was running an older copy of mkvmerge that resurrected itself when I moved to a new computer a couple of days ago -- works fine with 6.1. F-Windows. "
,Gh057man,2013-04-08T16:42Z,@esuave. You idiot. nunlickets must be set to on and then you fart only two times. Stupid noob :) 
,kiwij,2013-04-12T10:17Z,I'm guess the combined age of jack012 & gh057man must be less than 12.  Thanks for the upload bozx
,link5a,2013-04-13T19:29Z,"thanx!
@esuave Why do you need to get rid of subtitles in order to not play them - you can simply turn them off in most players I know :)"
,rstone1987,2013-05-07T04:32Z,I'm fairly new here and I've tried about everything I can think of.  My download speed is 30MB/s but for some reason when download files from here my max DL speed is 1.2MB/s.  Does anyone know why?
