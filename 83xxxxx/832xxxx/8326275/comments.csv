Don't know until new version comes out - try it, but save the original torrent as a backup

A big THANK YOU   ...   :o)

@Killeh

It works with the license from the older version. But you still have to quit and patch this version after installation. You just dont need to insert some serial. 
But I still recommend to uninstall the old version and install the new version. You avoid some problems by a new installation. "

One thing though, I can't double click (copy) the key even though it's automatically copied to my clipboard.. hence, not being able to ""Activate"" :/"
