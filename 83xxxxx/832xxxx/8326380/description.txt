Two discs [in FLAC] selection of well known and popular songs, and popular rock genre,
various artists with original and borrowed repertory ranging from 60's to the millennium.
In short .. It is not only the original version, but also largely on the cover versions!

This selection is my own collections, and is unofficial!
The selection of tracks and their order was selected randomly.
Have a nice experience and undisturbed listening.
