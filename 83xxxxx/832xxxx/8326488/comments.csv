,john791,2013-04-01T11:05Z,720p in avi had been uploaded or not yet? link
,kiwij,2013-04-01T11:44Z,It's DD5.1 ; so 5.1 channels.  It's probably only the intro that is 2 channels as that is how it is broadcast.
,MyFootHurts,2013-04-01T12:10Z,"Can't read kiwij? DD5.1 is the source, not the encode."
,Ayni.,2013-04-01T17:42Z,"I see his other torrent: Game.of.Thrones.S03E01.1080p.HDTV.x264-GOT [PublicHD]

has 5.1 audio. This one, being -GOT too and coming from the same source, not should it has 5.1 audio too?

Could anyone confirm if it's 2ch as the torrent details say so or 5.1 like his other torrent?

Thanks."

Actually, the encode is both 2.0 and 5.1, like kiwij said. The ""previously on Game of Thrones"" and ""next time on Game of Thrones"" segments are encoded in stereo, but the rest of the episode is in 5.1 surround. All of the releases on here are like that, it's how HBO broadcasts it."
