"
,hilife717,2013-04-25T20:29Z,"I have this ISO playing back with full audio using DVD-fab 8.2.2.8. There are possibly other Virtual ISO programs that are good for mounting ISO's. DVD-fab 8 has been my choice, I haven't tried any other to make a comparison. Keep me posted."
,brbear,2013-04-27T23:06Z,"I cant speak for Cinavia, but I can tell you that if you burn it, it won't play in a BD player.

a load bar comes up... then about 4 minutes of black, then the menu (no background video)... and if you select a video, either main feature or an extra... nothing happens.

I'll try a re-burn, but I'm not holding my breath"
,brbear,2013-04-28T01:17Z,"Reburn same result.

Extracted the ISO and burned just the Blu-ray relevant folders ... same result.

Unless you're using this as a PC image, this ISO is a dud."
,hilife717,2013-04-28T03:14Z,"Well I found something interesting about Cinavia Protection, it seems that not all BD playesr have this detection scheme, however not all manufactures are created equal, meaning some can bypass this protection. 

If it helps you in anyway I did burn this ISO using ImageBurn and haven't experienced any issue. I am using an LG BD-RW Drive Model: WH14NS40 Manufacture date Dec. 2012. 

Also, see if the Hashes match. I am sure it will work, it's just a matter of time and effort. I'm not sure if your trying to play this on a PS3 but supposedly it wont play on firmware 3.10 and up. Try and see if you can convert it to another format like MKV."
,brbear,2013-05-01T05:29Z,"I tried it on 3 different players.   A PS3 (which I wasn't too hopeful), a Sony, and a Samsung.

Although Cinavia protected BDs don't experience this same problem.   They just go silent 20-30 minutes in and a prompt comes on the screen.

This was odd... seems no ""video"" would play.   if I were to guess, I would say there is a 14 second ""video"" followed by a ~2min video before the menu loads.   I'd guess studio branding and promo most likely.

And then there was no ""video"" behind the main menu screen.   As well, selecting any video (main feature or bonus items) resulted in no playback.

I burned the disc 3 times with ImageBurn on an LG burner as well.  It was by far the most peculiar BD I've burned.

On the other hand, I downloaded a different image from here, and it behaved properly, but was protected with Cinavia (I even commented on that thread as well.)

I've seen the film, so someday it will wind up in the $5 bin.   I can wait."
