Information
------------------------------

Hordes of tiny terrors march through the rainforest: they are army ants. Known as the most feared animals in the equatorial forests of Ecuador, they hack and dice any unfortunate prey that gets in their path and bring the remains back to their nest.

When they wipe out all food sources around the nest, they start a massive migration in search of a new nest, while carefully protecting their queen. This program introduces the unknown social lives of the army ants.
