@unamas

After applying one of the keys offline, you will see that the key is invalid. All you have to do is connect to the internet and wait. It should work :) "
,Hector25,2013-04-12T00:38Z,"@aznguy87, thanx for the tip..mate! It works, I actually had to click on the update after reconnecting to the internet. And I got one of the keys from this upload...

Thank you."
,Rev3rse_,2013-05-03T13:14Z,"Extremely important notes:
BEFORE ACTUALLY USING KIS, DO THE FOLLOWING:

- Change auto updates to manual updates(from KIS settings); so KIS doesn't auto-update by itself(if it updates; you're fucked and your keys will be blocked)

- Go to your hosts file, on windows 7: C:/windows/System32/drivers/etc/hosts
And add the following lines to the end
(This will block any attempt by KIS to update):
127.0.0.1 dnl-01.geo.kaspersky.com
127.0.0.1 dnl-02.geo.kaspersky.com
127.0.0.1 dnl-03.geo.kaspersky.com
127.0.0.1 dnl-04.geo.kaspersky.com
127.0.0.1 dnl-05.geo.kaspersky.com
127.0.0.1 dnl-06.geo.kaspersky.com
127.0.0.1 dnl-07.geo.kaspersky.com
127.0.0.1 dnl-08.geo.kaspersky.com
127.0.0.1 dnl-09.geo.kaspersky.com
127.0.0.1 dnl-10.geo.kaspersky.com
127.0.0.1 dnl-11.geo.kaspersky.com
127.0.0.1 dnl-12.geo.kaspersky.com
127.0.0.1 dnl-13.geo.kaspersky.com
127.0.0.1 dnl-14.geo.kaspersky.com
127.0.0.1 dnl-15.geo.kaspersky.com
127.0.0.1 dnl-16.geo.kaspersky.com
127.0.0.1 dnl-17.geo.kaspersky.com
127.0.0.1 dnl-18.geo.kaspersky.com
127.0.0.1 dnl-19.geo.kaspersky.com
127.0.0.1 dnl-00.geo.kaspersky.com

These two steps will ensure your safety from getting blacklisted by Kaspersky. I had to learn this the hard way.

By the way: Thanks for the torrent."

,freeloaderguy,2013-05-18T13:35Z,"KIS2013 will automatically quaranteen any host file which is modified with the 

""kaspersky.com"" character string.

Before modifying the hosts file, as documented by member Rev3rse_, you must 

first add the unmodified host file to the KIS2013 File Exclusion settings.

Here's how:

1. Right click KIS 2013 icon in system tray, left click Settings
2. In Settings window's left column, left click on Advanced Settings, Threats 

and Exclusions
3. In Exclusions panel on right side of Settings window, left click on 

Settings
4. In Trusted Zone window, left click on Exclusion rules tab, and click on Add
5. In Exclusion rule window, left click on Select Object
6. In Object name window, unselect the check box for Include subfolders, and 

left click on the Browse button
7. In this step you will locate and select the ""hosts"" file:
In the Select folder window, expand ""Computer"", select and expand the C drive, 

scroll to and expand the Windows directory, scroll to and expand the System32 

directory, scroll to and expand the drivers directory, scroll to and expand 

the etc directory, left click on the filename ""hosts"" and left click on OK.
8. In the Object name window left click on OK.
9. In the Exclusion rule window, with the Rule description box, left click 

""select components"" on the Protection components line.
In the Protection components window, check the boxes corresponding to
[X] File Anti-Virus
[X] Application Control
[X] Scan
then left click on OK.
10. In the Exclusion rule window, left click on OK.
11. In the Trusted zone window, left click on OK.
12. In the Settings window, left click on Apply, then left click on OK.

Now you can modify the hosts file, as is documented above by member Rev3rse_"
