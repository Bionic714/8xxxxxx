White Mansions (1978)

White Mansions is a 1978 album by various artists documenting life in the Confederacy during the Civil War. 

The songs on the album were written by Paul Kennerley and are performed by Waylon Jennings, Jessi Colter, John Dillon and Steve Cash. Each singer took on a separate and distinct persona, portraying different characters in an attempt to show the Confederacy and the concept of "Southern pride" through said characters' eyes; in essence, therefore, White Mansions is a concept album. Eric Clapton played the guitar on several tracks. The record was a rather unsuccessful endeavor and went by relatively unnoticed, never charting.
