,Expedio,2013-04-01T16:08Z,"I always go with Dibya's uploads. Dibya is very reliale - he or she always uploads the shows only half an hour or a little more after the show airs.

These torrents are always top quality - never have any glitches in the media. 

I support DibyaTPB. "

Dumbass. The ""previously on Game of Thrones"" and ""next time on Game of Thrones"" segments are encoded in stereo, but the rest of the episode is in 5.1 surround. All of the releases on here are like that, it's how HBO broadcasts it. Why don't you actually check the episode before calling people liars?"
