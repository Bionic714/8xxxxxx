
Happy the nations of the moral North!
Where all is virtue, and the winter season
Sends sin, without a rag on, shivering forth
('T was snow that brought St. Anthony to reason);
Where juries cast up what a wife is worth,
By laying whate'er sum in mulct they please on
The lover, who must pay a handsome price,
Because it is a marketable vice.

Some poetry of Byron read by John Hannah. Delivered in a light Scots accent and in a  natural and pleasant manner. (''Poets for Pleasure'' ΓÇô Hodder and Stoughton, 1996)
