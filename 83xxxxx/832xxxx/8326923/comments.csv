I would highly acknowledge & be grateful if anyone could tell me where I would be able to find the drivers for my ACER WEBCAM ( Laptop Model - 5750G & using Windows 7 32-bit ). In addition, thanks for your invaluable contribution & dedication over the years Mister SOULKING77. There is no exercise better for the heart than reaching down and lifting people up."

,led_zeppelin_2009,2013-04-15T17:20Z,@ mnmarco - I must thank you for providing the link. However I have found every single application but could not manage to find the Webcam Driver. I did manage to install an Acer Cam driver but the video is upside down. Once again thank you so much and god bless you. In case if you find a diver related to it then please provide me with link.

,led_zeppelin_2009,2013-04-18T15:00Z,"@ Thanks Mister gthol, however it was of no avail. I have almost tried all Acer Webcam drivers, I do not have problems with either the quality of the video and also no malfunctioning. The problems that I am facing is either the video is upside down or the video position changed. Few months ago I did used a driver or software that actually did allowed to me to change the positions and angles, but now I could not find and do not remember the file. "

why u no install you cam , it's amazing "
,led_zeppelin_2009,2013-04-28T23:10Z,"@ Mister adonese12, I have installed the driver of the camera and it also works but the picture comes upside down and side wise. There are no options either to change the view or angle. I am really honored & privileged that everyone has tried out their level best to help me out. Seems like the world still have some good people around. However still waiting anxiously for a legitimate and helpful answer from the Boss himself soulking77."
