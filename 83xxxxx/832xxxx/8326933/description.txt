After a business venture fails, an ex-priest, Lauro Pajaron is forced to move his wife and two daughters the back to their ancestral home to begin anew in the charcoal-making trade. Wracked by guilt over the betrayal of his priestly vows, Lauro witnesses the effect his inner torment has on those closest to him as each family member is forced to search for their own form of redemption. And while deaf-mute Uncle Domeng, from the homeland, tends to the family's needs, each member struggles with their own sorrows and worries.
