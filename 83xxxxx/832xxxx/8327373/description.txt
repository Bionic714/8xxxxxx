Biography Documentary hosted by Dwight Slade, published by American the Movie in 2009 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

15 years after his death, Bill Hicks is now more popular than ever, and is widely seen as one of the best comedian of the modern era. However, in America, where he challenged institutions and accepted ways of thinking, he suffered censorship and was never truly recognized by a wide audience in the United States. In the country which enshrines freedom of speech in its constitution his story is truly about what it means to be an American.
