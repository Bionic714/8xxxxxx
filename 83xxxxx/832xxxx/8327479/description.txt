Jason & The Scorchers - Midnight Roads & Stages Seen [LIVE] [2 CD] (1998)
_________________________________________________________________________

Jason & the Scorchers, originally Jason & the Nashville Scorchers, are a Cowpunk / Country rock band formed in 1981 and led by singer/songwriter Jason Ringenberg.With a sound that straddles hard rock, punk rock and country music, Jason and the Scorchers are noted for their energetic live performances, and have earned strong reviews from critics: Mark Deming, who declared they "blazed a trail for the cowpunk and alt-country movements that followed in their wake."

This seminal country-punk outfit proves they haven't lost any power in their punch with this double-live effort. Check out the searing cover of Dylan's "Absolutely Sweet Marie." It just goes to show what many have said for years: there's nothing like a Jason and the Scorchers show.
