Welcome to the “hall of fame” section of my little recommendations project. I have had some requests from people to narrow things down a little–after all, with close to 500 “essential” releases it might be difficult to know where to start! To make things easier, here are five releases per year that I feel really stand out… and if that’s not enough, check out the all-time Top Ten!
