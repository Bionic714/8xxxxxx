[T],ajaxen94,2013-04-01T16:11Z,@EnemyDrone sorry it won't help your zombie need this is the final Episode for now as far as I know
[T],ajaxen94,2013-04-01T16:46Z,hope everyone isn't expecting this episode to be in HD like the other 2 were. it was broadcast in SD as the BBC has decided to give the HD channel to BBC 2 so there wont be anymore BBC3 in HD
