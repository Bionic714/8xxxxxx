In the wake of a zombie outbreak, humanity survives and discovers a cure for the zombie's "rabid" condition. Thanks to a government act, Partially Deceased Syndrome sufferers are now given makeup so they can pass as human and are integrated back into society. One teenager, Kieren, goes back to his village of Roarton, only to discover that the local Human Volunteer Force representatives plan to eliminate any PDS sufferers that are brought back to the village.
