  Based out of Birmingham, England, Peace create drifting, melodic indie rock that merges the crawling atmosphere of classic post-punk with the pop-oriented bounce of modern bands like Vampire Weekend. Formed by brothers Harrison and Samuel Koisser, on vocals/guitar and bass, respectively, as well as guitarist Douglas Castle and drummer Dominic Boyce, the band came together in 2010 before gaining recognition among the U.K. press with its debut outing, the Delicious EP, which was released on Columbia in 2012. A full-length effort, In Love, followed in early 2013.
