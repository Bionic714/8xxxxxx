,Knan4051,2013-04-08T01:45Z,No comments on quality. Guess I'll check it out and leave one myself
,Knan4051,2013-04-08T22:34Z,Video quality is decent but no better than the other compressed 720p rips on TPB that are ~400 MB. The borders of people's faces/clothes are less defined than that of Ameet's rip (which has a bit rate of 870)
,Knan4051,2013-04-09T02:09Z,"Scratch that last part, I guess it varies because the media info says:

-Overall bit rate mode: variable
-Overall bit rate: 1718 Kbps
-Video format: AVC
-Video bit rate mode: variable
-Video bit rate: 1570 Kbps
-Frame rate: 23.976 fps
-1280x720 pixels
-Writing application: HandBrake

-Audio format: AAC (bit rate: 160Kbps)"
