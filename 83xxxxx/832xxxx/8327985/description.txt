River Monsters Season 4
For three successful seasons of Animal Planet's River Monsters, extreme angler Jeremy Wade has taken viewers along as he unravels freshwater fish tales of giant killers - where sometimes the fact really is stranger than the fiction! These voyages have taken him across the globe to waterways far and wide, all on an endless search for man-eating creatures that lurk below. He's caught dozens of these elusive beasts, typically in remote jungles and unexplored lands.


1)  American Killers 
Extreme angler Jeremy Wade normally travels deep into the globe's most remote regions searching for fresh water monsters, but recently he's been getting reports of killers from an unexpected place - the United States.

2)  Russian Killer 
Extreme angler Jeremy Wade heads to Russia's remote Amur River, where the mysterious deaths of three men appear to be linked with a reclusive freshwater giant. The prime suspect is a predator that can top a ton and exceed eighteen feet in length

3)  Mongolian Mauler 
When he hears of a recent bloody attack in a remote Mongolian river, angler Jeremy Wade wonders if it could be the work of a giant fish so rare that it's more legend than fact. Pound for pound, this man-sized monster is said to be one of the strongest.

4)  Asian Slayer 
Angler Jeremy Wade returns to the remote rivers of India's Himalayas to investigate a fresh spate of savage attacks. Jeremy thinks he knows the perpetrator's identity, but his plans to catch the monster hit trouble when he learns its a sacred animal.

5)  Phantom Assassin 
Jeremy Wade returns to Australia's predator-packed Fitzroy River in search of one of the world's rarest and least known fish - the Northern River Shark. It's so elusive that only twenty have ever been caught

6)  Pack of Teeth 
From the Okavango swamps in southern Africa there are stories of a piranha-like fish that hunts in marauding packs, tearing into other fish, and even human flesh. Angler Jeremy Wade heads into the watery labyrinth to track down this deadly swarm.

7)  Invisible Executioner 
Jeremy Wade takes on Africa's wild Zambezi River to unmask an invisible predator that's dragging fisherman to their deaths. Crocs and hippos are guilty of killing many in plain view, yet it seems there's another monster stalking these deadly waters.

8)  Lair of Giants 
Jeremy Wade explores the hostile wildness of the Essequibo, Guyana's largest river and one of South Americas best kept secrets. Armed with only old journals and his rod, Jeremy is on a mission to discover if monsters of the past still exist.
