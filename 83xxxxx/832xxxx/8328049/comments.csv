1/ Find a PC somewhere, launch the .exe file from an USB flash drive, then chose it as the installation location (you'll need near 3GB free space). The ""Assets"" and ""Samples"" folders are yours.

ON THE MAC 

2 / Put the ""Assets"" and ""Samples"" folders here :
yourharddrive/Library/Application Support/Luxology/Content/

(NOTE : The ""Library"" folder is the one from your HD, not from the ""User"" folder. If the ""Content"" folder doesn't exist, create it.)"
