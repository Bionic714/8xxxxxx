[T],Hard2Find2,2013-04-01T17:18Z,This looks to be a popular torrent from the early leach count. Please realize that only 1 person has the entire collecting at 22 gigabytes. It will initially take 3 to 4 days to get the full collection and get the torrent stable. Speeds may be better a week from now once it is established.
,altabari,2013-04-05T12:43Z,Screenshots ?
,micropirate1,2013-04-07T19:05Z,NOT IN ENGLISH!!! Is badly overdubbed in Russian or similar language. Asswipes!
[T],Hard2Find2,2013-04-08T03:06Z,@micropirate1 Don't fake spam my torrent. If you think this is anything but English then you need to get your ears checked. You have obviously not got these files and have posted this on another WD3 torrent already.
,mrsisterfister,2013-04-08T15:32Z,"I can confirm micropirate1 is wrong. The audio is in English and is good quality.

To the uploader though. I don't mean this as a criticism, but the image you've used for the torrent is a spoiler.

If you can, it wouldn't be a bad idea to change it to something else. The official season 3 poster maybe?
