This is Matt Dillahunty's talk on Atheism and Skepticism from the American Atheists Convention 2013 in Austin, Texas. Dillahunty is the main host of The Atheist Experience television show, president of The Atheist Community of Austin, and in my opinion, does as much for the atheist community as Christopher Hitchens, Richard Dawkins and Sam Harris. 

If you want more Dillahunty after seeing this, check out The Atheist Experience. It is a weekly cable access television show in Austin, Texas geared at a non-atheist audience, and the purpose of the show is to promote positive atheism and separation of church and state. It's live and they take calls from (mainly) believers, asking them what they believe and why and the debates almost always get very lively. The website for the show is http://atheist-experience.com/ and a full archive of past shows is here: http://atheist-experience.com/archive/

Matt is also one of the founders and authors of Iron Chariots: The Counter-Apologetics Wiki, which is one of the best sources of its kind that I have seen. http://wiki.ironchariots.org/index.php?title=Main_Page
