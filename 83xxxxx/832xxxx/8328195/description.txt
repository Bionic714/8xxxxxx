Set in Liverpool, the series revolved around Ma Boswell who had all her sons tied to her apron strings, but was unable to control the carnal lusts of her husband. It took two series to catch on - initially panned by critics and ignored by the public - but by the third series it was a runaway success for a writer who had become used to such praise, Carla Lane.
