The world of demolition derby can be summed up by one simple axiom - smash or be smashed. We'll be offering a front-row seat to the explosive egos, intense competition and automotive carnage that make these destructive events impossible to turn away from. "Kings of Crash" is set in the world of legalized road rage, where the accidents aren't accidents, and the characters are as combustible as the collisions.

"Kings of Crash" explores the personal lives of eight drivers who step behind the wheel every week in hopes of crushing the competition and bringing home a win. At each derby competitors advance through various heats for a chance to capture the coveted "Mad Dog: Most Aggressive Driver" title.

Along the way, the work against the clock to source parts, tune-up transmissions, and make the repairs necessary to withstand the crescendo of crashes. All the while however, these automotive gladiators are just like the rest of us - real people leading real lives. The racers juggle nagging physical pain, strained family relationships, and financial stresses as they push ahead in their quest to become derby champion.
