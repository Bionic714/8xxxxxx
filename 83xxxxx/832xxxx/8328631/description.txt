The Charlie Daniels Band's most popular album, 1979's MILLION MILE REFLECTIONS, is best known for its deathless hit single "The Devil Went Down to Georgia." That's far from its only attribute, though, as this is probably the group's most consistently listenable album. "Reflections" is a minor classic, a tribute to dead country and rock stars--most notably Ronnie Van Zandt of Lynyrd Skynyrd--that unlike most songs of this ilk manages to keep from being saccharine or soppy.

The rip-snorting "Passing Lane" is one of Daniels' best all-out rockers, and the contributions from band members Tommy Crain ("Blind Man") and Taz ("Jitterbug") are well above their usual Ringo-song status. Novices should probably start with one of the many Charlie Daniels Band compilations to get the band's full effect, but this is easily the band's best studio album.
