,TaylorBA,2013-04-15T09:00Z,"Searched the internet high and low and can not find a single copy of this in 720p.

Makes me sad."
,oceansburning,2013-04-27T06:47Z,"bbc 3 ceased to broadcast on hd the week the last episode was aired, that's why we can't find it in hd :@
"

Not sure I can keep this series on my PC with a SD episode in the mix. Annoying."
