Californication:

Hank Moody may be a talented author, despite his gift of the gab, especially for live seducing, his private life is a mess. Repeated attempts to have a stable relationship with Karen, also for the sake of their daughter Becca, fail because of their extreme libertarian infidelity. Hank's sexual appetite also infects talent agent Charlie Runkle, who indulges in all kinds of naughtiness too. More 'victims of hormones' contribute to the lustily lust-loaded plot.

The sixth season is currently on air and features a storyline revolving around Hank penning a musical with a "coked up rock star". The sixth season features Marilyn Manson as himself, a friend of fellow rockstar Atticus Fetch. Season Six started on January 13, 2013, and had a season finale on March 31st.
