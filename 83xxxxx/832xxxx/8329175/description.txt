The application was pre-cracked by Scofield93 using Team NOY's earlier crack method. It appears to be working OK and the Power Pack was unlocked when I tested it.

* Instructions:

* To unlock the Power Pack offline, copy the supplied license.plist to 
  /Users/yourname/Library/Application Support/Alfred 2/

* Note for some users you may find the name of the folder as Alfred v2
   instead.

Loads of app-launching, file-searching goodness - free for you to download and use with no strings attached. Alfred is the ultimate productivity tool for your Mac. Get it and see for yourself.

WHAT'S NEW:

* Improved app discovery and caching allowing for apps such as
   iPhone Simulator to be found if folder added to search scope

* Improved 'Browse in Alfred' workflow action, now allowing for
   more control over which folder is browsed

* iTunes keywords now available in Alfred's default results, if enabled
   in Alfred's iTunes &gt; Keywords preferences

* Flatten app cache search string for more reliable internationalised app 
  searching such as Russian

* Fully resolve symlinks in Alfred.alfredpreferences path which
   prevented preferences not being saving in certain scenarios

* Add error reporting to Alfred's preferences when a preference can't be
   saved for better user feedback

* Only enable the clipboard merge preferences if Alfred's clipboard 
  history is enabled to prevent confusion

* Make {query} work in the script filter placeholder fields as they do in 
  keyword / custom search fields for consistency

* Add selected theme to the 'not synced' info text in advanced prefs 
  (allows for different theme per Mac)

* Search by phonetic names in the contacts searcher for better internationalised support

* Don't show the 'no update data available' warning on a background 
  auto-update check

* Clean up unnecessary data in the app support folder when it is no 
  longer needed

* Remove lightening bolt text from iTunes prefs as this is no longer in
   v2

* Clean up previous main results when switching from a typed query to 
  a ' query in a single shot

* Make keyword optional when saving a snippet, as it's not really
   needed (as per v1)

* Better main app icon without aliasing at certain icon sizes

* Escape $ in the copy to / move to actions

* Escape ()[] in 'Open Terminal Here' action
