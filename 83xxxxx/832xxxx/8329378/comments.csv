In my humble opinion sample, screenshoot and nfo it's redundant work.

Regarding the nfo you can get whatever info you need here at my torrent page.

Regarding sample, yes it's 10-20gb download and there's the chance of bad picture quality, so you'll be wasting bandwidth finding and downloading another torrent. But it's only gonna be one time and you either trust my encodes or not. And if you look around my other torrents you will quickly find that rip/torrents is ok quality.

Hope you can live with it? :)
