NOTE TO USERS DOWNLOADING THIS OFF PUBLIC P2P: SOON UNPOPULAR WILL BE COMPLETELY WINDING DOWN AS PIRACY IS VERY RISKY, ESPECIALLY WITH MANY UPLOADS!

WE'RE DITCHING TORRENTS OURSELVES - NO PIRATE BAY, NO KICKASS TORRENTS, ETC

However we will live on...

unpopular.xp3.biz

While it's not torrents, you'll be able to find all releases that aren't uploaded to torrent sites there

Some are already listed, so make sure you're not missing out ! (like some Investigation Discovery caps are not on p2p, but still available for download)

Want more unpopular in the future? You'll be able to find some things here:

-private torrent sites (not uploaded by us)
-release blogs (not posted by us)
-Just Google "Show Name SXXEXX" and maybe you'll get a hit

basically we will soon be no longer supplying warez to the world, it's just not worth it

we're just finishing up a few seaons and uploading a few random episodes in the meantime

feel free to make torrents of releases we don't

cheers!
