      Statistics and Data with R. An Applied Approach Through Examples
      ================================================================




R, an Open Source software, has become the de facto statistical computing environment. It has an excellent collection of data manipulation and graphics capabilities. It is extensible and comes with a large number of packages that allow statistical analysis at all levels - from simple to advanced - and in numerous fields including Medicine, Genetics, Biology, Environmental Sciences, Geology, Social Sciences and much more. The software is maintained and developed by academicians and professionals and as such, is continuously evolving and up to date. Statistics and Data with R presents an accessible guide to data manipulations, statistical analysis and graphics using R.
Assuming no previous knowledge of statistics or R, the book includes:
A comprehensive introduction to the R language.

                    Mathematical Statistics with Resampling and R
                    =============================================


Resampling helps students understand the meaning of sampling distributions, sampling variability, P-values, hypothesis tests, and confidence intervals. This groundbreaking book shows how to apply modern resampling techniques to mathematical statistics. Extensively class-tested to ensure an accessible presentation, Mathematical Statistics with Resampling and R utilizes the powerful and flexible computer language R to underscore the significance and benefits of modern resampling techniques.
The book begins by introducing permutation tests and bootstrap methods, motivating classical inference methods.
Striking a balance between theory, computing, and applications, the authors explore additional topics such as:
Exploratory data analysis
Calculation of sampling distributions
The Central Limit Theorem
Monte Carlo sampling
Maximum likelihood estimation and properties of estimators
Confidence intervals and hypothesis tests
Regression
Bayesian methods
Throughout the book, case studies on diverse subjects such as flight delays, birth weights of babies, and telephone company repair times illustrate the relevance of the real-world applications of the discussed material. Key definitions and theorems of important probability distributions are collected at the end of the book, and a related website is also available, featuring additional material including data sets, R scripts, and helpful teaching hints.
Mathematical Statistics with Resampling and R is an excellent book for courses on mathematical statistics at the upper-undergraduate and graduate levels. It also serves as a valuable reference for applied statisticians working in the areas of business, economics, biostatistics, and public health who utilize resampling methods in their everyday work.
