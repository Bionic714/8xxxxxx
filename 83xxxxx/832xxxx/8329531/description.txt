Cairo-Kee, the name is aspired from both the words Cairo and karaoke which means singing along with Cairo. The band first, started by the name The Black star which means the unseen star, where they used to play English covers. But the band was seriously formed in the year 2003, ever since the band has performed live in various places. The idea of playing music and performing live was a childhood dream for all the members of the band.
