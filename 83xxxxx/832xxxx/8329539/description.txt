Roswell High is a young adults book series written by Melinda Metz and published by Pocket Books. The 10-book series chronicles the adventures of three teen aliens and their human friends, who attend the fictional Ulysses F. Olsen High in Roswell, New Mexico. The Roswell High books served as inspiration for the American science fiction television series Roswell (1999ΓÇô2002), also known as Roswell High in some countries, which in turn spawned eleven spin-off books of its own.
