Wikipedia:
Low is the eleventh studio album by British musician David Bowie, and co-produced by Bowie and Tony Visconti. Widely regarded as one of his most influential releases, Low was the first of the "Berlin Trilogy", a series of collaborations with Brian Eno (though the album was mainly recorded in France and only mixed in West Berlin). The experimental, avant-garde style would be further explored on Heroes and Lodger. The album's working title was New Music Night and Day.
