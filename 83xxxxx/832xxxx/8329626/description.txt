Start8 is an application developed for Windows 8 and its function is very simple: replace the desktop, to the left of the toolbar system, the good old Start Menu button, through which you access everything that exists on the PC .

The next version of Windows, the button and the menu itself will be deleted. Now, the Metro interface is responsible for serving as a bridge between you and all that is in the machine, as applications installed by you and also the system folders. Who misses a specific button and the Start Menu itself needs to keep an eye on this program.

The latest update brings Start8 just a novelty, but it can be useful to many supporters of the new Windows. By default, the operating system displays the Start screen when it starts, changing a feature of many years, since the desktop has always been "calling card" of the OS. Now, this app can make Windows 8 to boot always the good old desktop.
