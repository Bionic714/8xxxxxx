World's Biggest Festival: Kumbh Mela
Welcome to the largest human gathering ever in this one-hour special, World's Biggest Festival: Kumbh Mela. Imagine a crowd so massive, it is visible from space. A crowd, likely 100 million strong, intent on just one thing: bathing in a sacred river to wash away sins and gain a chance at a new beginning. In the World's Biggest Festival: Kumbh Mela, experience the dazzling spectacle of spiritual fervour and collective diversity as Hindus from across the globe converge on the Maha Kumbh Mela. Not only is it the world's largest religious festival, but it is also believed to be the largest gathering of humans in one place, at one time on Earth.
Returning in February 2013, Kumbh Mela is the world's largest religious festival that happens every 12 years
