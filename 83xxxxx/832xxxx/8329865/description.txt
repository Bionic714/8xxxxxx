These programs are from collection of a primary school over many years.

Most programs are old and would probably need to be installed/run under
Windows XP or Windows 9x compatibility mode.

These programs are suitable for children from age 3 up to about 7 or 8
There are many gems in here which will provide children many hours
of fun and learning. 

Although most of these programs are old, they are still very useful
and fun for children, I hope your children/students enjoy using them.
