,beliha1,2013-04-11T04:28Z,"Are the subtitles really hardcoded on this, or can you turn them off?? I see that on the last line of the description, but for a file of this quality it would be a real shame! Can anyone confirm??"
,Mhen93,2013-04-16T17:50Z,"Since there are 5 different subtitles I guess you can turn them off wherever you switch between the different languages. The subs are included in the video file, and not in separate files. Maybe thats why it says hardcoded. 

I was going to check, but for some reason VLC crashes every time I open the file. It runs all other MKV files, but not this one. Are there any reason why VLC won't work, or is the only option to delete and re-download?
