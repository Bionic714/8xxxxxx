when you watch it in its actual dimensions it looks a bit better, but of course it's going to be lq, it's a tvrip"

[T],MrUnpopular,2013-04-02T04:32Z,"It was 3D in the broadcast, dunno why it was changed for the episode."
,TorrentBeast887,2013-04-05T15:58Z,"Hi ""MrUnpopular"" could you like not make it a TVRip or something? Aren't we all in the 21st century? Well if you aren't, you better be soon. Cuz your releases are shitting so bad :( Please man please. I gotta say though you have the latest Regular Show episodes :) But the thing that wrecked it was the whole TVRip thing so please stop it man. Thanks "
[T],MrUnpopular,2013-04-07T18:35Z,"We might upgrade hardware for HDTV capping sometime within the next few months, but at the same time we'll be phasing out P2P so why bother? We're not here to be the greatest, we're just here to fill some gaps even if it's not as good as what other groups release."
