"The Lives of Others"

In the show's 100th episode, Castle finds
himself in the unfortunate position of NOT
being able to work a case. While he's holed
up in the loft with a broken leg, Beckett
goes off to investigate the death of an IRS
agent without him, leaving Castle miserable
and bored. But when he thinks he witnesses
the murder of a young woman in the
apartment across the street, he is thrown
into a "Rear Window"-esque murder mystery
that hits much too close to home
