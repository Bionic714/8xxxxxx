,harvey4love,2013-04-08T11:01Z,"Don't know what I'd do without you, Chitto.  Thank You"
[V],HighCode,2013-04-08T22:10Z,"ChattChitto, you're a living legend!
Thanks a lot!"
,TheGift73,2013-04-10T02:41Z,"I know that the issue is on my end as your releases have always worked. However, I can install the program without issue as per instructions., but when it is set to rip/copy a bluray, it remains at 0%

Process begins after I hit start, then nothing. Stops at 'Intel GPU acceleration for video encoding enabled'. Time elapsed keeps going and program remains responsive, just remains at 0%.

Can play bluray's fine when watching them on my machine, it's just being able to rip/copy with this release that is causing the problem."
,TheGift73,2013-04-10T03:57Z,"[Update]

Issue resolved by changing a couple of things in the programs settings.

Settings (Green Tick)>General>A/V Codec>Video Decoder

Changed H.264 to Software (was set to Intel)
Changed MPEG2 to Software (was set to Intel)

Hope that helps someone else.

Again, the upload works fine, the issue was on my end."
,SparedParts,2013-05-10T03:48Z,Can anyone tell me the name of this song and artist on ChattChitto's installer?
