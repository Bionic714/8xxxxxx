,pneuma11,2013-04-05T20:49Z,I didnt include the serials for dedamage but if you need one search youtube! Dont think you do but for some reason if you do..
,pneuma11,2013-04-09T00:27Z,"Also forgot to mention that RealSmart Motion blur comes back with trojan.cp.dialer in it but its directly from their website and only ""TheHacker antivirus"" comes up with it so I cant really say whethere it does or doesnt have that in it without a true gfi on the files installer... Up to you just deselect it if you dont want it..."
