,gumalinx,2013-04-08T05:44Z,"thanks for the torrent .. but, sorry, i am a newbie.
How to make this pkg work? i'm already on rogero 4.30 cfw and reactpsn installed.
also how to activate file on your exdata?"
,cham5,2013-04-09T01:28Z,"@gumalinx place the exdata folder in root of usb drive (drive palced in 2nd USB port) and launch reActPSN as a new user 'aa'. After successful activation, the 'aa' account will change to another name such as ""...reActPSN###"""
,gumalinx,2013-04-09T19:07Z,"yup.. tried many times, but after selected the game, screen goes black and then back to the XMB automatically with error warning (80028F17). Any idea then?"
,cham5,2013-04-09T19:27Z,"@gumalinx Did the account name change from ""aa""?"
,cham5,2013-04-09T19:33Z,@gumalinx ensure the account name changed from 'aa'
,gumalinx,2013-04-10T05:41Z,"I did, and ""aa"" changed to ""reactpsn v2.0..."".
I'm on rogero 4.40 v 1.03 react psn 2.24b. Anything wrong with my CFW??"
,cham5,2013-04-14T19:00Z,@gumalinx This may be the bad version. I made an International FF XII classic and then a normal one. the INTL was reported unworking by several people.
,cham5,2013-04-14T19:01Z,use my other copy. with [PS2 Classics] in the title. Sorry m8

,gumalinx,2013-04-19T03:16Z,"@cham5, Somehow it doesn't work :(, but yes, your other copy is working. Thanx anyway"
