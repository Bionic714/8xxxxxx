You use this game-build or previous versions build?"
,XxCmonxX,2013-04-08T21:10Z,"@bruss.aka.durka9
this one and i run the dods updater before i play everytime and last night it made and update and since then its giving me that error insecure mode"

Hmmm strange.
Try: Full off antivirus --> run updater --> run game with administrator privileges (start game with Day_of_Defeat_Source.exe placed in game-dir)."
,John_Bonham,2013-04-12T10:42Z,This build came from the latest dods steampiped version right?
[T],bruss.aka.durka9,2013-04-12T16:50Z,"to John_Bonham
Yes."
