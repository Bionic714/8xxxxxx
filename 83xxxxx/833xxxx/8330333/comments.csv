,js99912,2013-04-08T19:22Z,"for whatever reason, it seems they have the finall on Monday 4-8 , not Sunday 4-7.

Bet that pissed of the subscribers.  Look for it on TPB after it airs.

,angelblake20,2013-04-09T19:40Z,whats up with these people talking about episode 13? i looked online and found nothing about a 13th episode anywhere. are these people just being douche bags?
,js99912,2013-04-11T16:18Z,"The original airing of EP12 
....on the next californication segment following the credits.

it was a season 7 ep 1preview, not season 6 ep 13 preview.

Thus many, myself included, thought there was a 13, and sho.com's website showed original air date of season finale as 4/7/2013, that's now changed.

And the ""tonight at 9:30"" watch the finale ticker is STILL on the website.

A few of us got confused, my bad, i shot my off and was wrong.  I shall suffer for such a dead.
Sorry 

this pack IS COMPLETE
