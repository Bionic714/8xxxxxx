I am proudly presenting you Ultimae Records FULL labelpack.
I downloaded it from the other sousce in MP3 320kbps,
and because of its' size - 9.1GB and my small upload, 
I converted it to HE-AAC 80 kbps, it gives almost the same quality.
Any modern player like Winamp or Foobar2000 can play this format.
You can even try to load it up to your smartphone !!
BUT, it is not a perfect quality, so if you like the music,
browse to www.ultimae.com and buy CD or digital release to support the label.
They anounce their events on that site as well - check it out !!
