,padme99,2013-04-14T06:14Z,"Thanks for the upload, will check it out, I've been searching for meaningful stuff about Iran and Iranian culture but most of the stuff on main stream media is propaganda.

Americans especially tend to sob and grieve over Iranians when all the times its the Palestinians that are suffering brutally at the hands of Israel. But you will never see the torture palestanians in Israeli jails, little kids as young as ten in jail being beaten up and bloodied, schools and hospitals being bombed

More over millions of Americans have lost their jobs and homes to thieving Bankers and wall street capitalists who have the american government in their hands. The US governments work for big pharma and big corporations. Trillions are spent on wars that America neither needs nor can afford while patriotic tax paying Americans die daily because they cannot afford good medicare.

And still we weep for Iranians, who are despite all the sanctions much better off than most Americans.

At least their politicians think of working for Iran and serving Iranians-while the US congress can only think of how best to serve Israel. If one has any doubts about this than just follow the TV coverage of any recent political campaign and you'd know what I mean."

This is not a Iran/Palestine/Israel forum. I uploaded some photos of Iran that I thought people might like, tourist photos, you know. Let's not try to hijack the thread to push your Palestine agenda."
