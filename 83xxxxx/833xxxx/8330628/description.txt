Indie 69 is a monthly playlist featuring 69 or more (mostly) new tracks, with a focus on indie rock, pop and many other genres.

This April features 125 tracks, mostly because I could not narrow it down anymore without deleting tracks I liked. So, BONUS?

Thanks for the tracks, tips and links as always. See you in May!
