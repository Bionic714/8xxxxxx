,BradFaz,2013-04-08T04:39Z,"thanks, you're the best, can't wait for the next one!"
,ssstannis,2013-04-08T06:39Z,just want to say I really appreciate what you do.  I hope you keep this up every week so I can enjoy GoT w/o the nudity
,ati42,2013-04-08T10:43Z,S03E02 does not contain any nudity so if thats your reason for then edit theres no need to wait for Flame_Leg
,Flame_Leg,2013-04-08T15:27Z,"I'm sill downloading the S03E02, but if I find that it requires no edits(this would be a first), I'll upload a dummy torrent of something, just saying that you guys can just download any version. Or maybe I'll just leave a comment here. Not sure what would be better yet."
,Flame_Leg,2013-04-08T17:13Z,"There is one part I need to edit, although there isn't any nudity. It seems they are lightening up on the nudity and cussing in season 3. Perhaps the next one will require no editing."
