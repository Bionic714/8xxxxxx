Although Slipknot made their mainstream debut in the late '90s, singer Corey Taylor and guitarist Jim Root got their start a few years prior in Stone Sour. Described as a cross between Metallica and Alice in Chains, the group spent several years playing the Iowa bar circuit before the two men joined Slipknot. Stone Sour re-formed in the early 2000s, though, and quickly distinguished themselves with a pair of gold-selling albums and three Grammy nominations.

Incredibly, Stone Sour doesn't have a compilation CD, so I decided to make one myself. The label, catalog# & cover art is completely fictitious. Any Resemblance is Purely Coincidental.

The music though is very real.
