Publication Date:  April 2004 - June 2010

This is the complete collection of Hack/Slash published by Devil's Due Publishing.  Hack/Slash started in 2004 as a series of one-shots, starting with the Stefano Caselli-penciled Hack/Slash (later referred to by its story title Euthanized), followed by the Federica Manfredi-penciled Girls Gone Dead.

2005 saw the one-shots Comic Book Carnage and the series stars, Vlad and Cassie, appeared in the Aadi Salman penciled The Final Revenge of Evil Ernie. The "Hack/Slash" one shots were collected as the First Cut trade paperback in the same year. The first "Hack/Slash" miniseries debuted, Land of Lost Toys, penciled by Dave Crosland, followed by a collection of new short stories in a 2006 special issue called Trailers (featuring art by writer stefano caselli and Tim Seeley, original penciler Caselli, Mike Norton, Skottie Young and Josh Medors).

A 25-cent preview issue giving newcomers a recap of "Euthanized" hit the markets in 2006, along with "Slice Hard", the first one-shot of 2006. Seeley penciled the new part of the preview and was one of the pencilers and inkers of the one-shot along with Mark Englert, Nate Bellgarde, Andy Kuhn and Joe Largent. The one-shot Hack/Slash Vs. Chucky, had the lead duo taking on the evil doll and was penciled by Matt Merhoff.

2007 had a Free Comic Day tie-in with Devil's Due's "Family Guy", where both books had half the issue to itself. The "Hack/Slash" section had a recap portion of the 25 cent preview issue. "Hack/Slash" graduated to an ongoing series in May 2007.

The ongoing series has included a crossover with Re-Animator (from Herbert WestΓÇôReanimator), where Herbert West is tied in to her father, as well a Hack/Slash Annual collecting the web comic featuring the SuicideGirls photo shoot.

Creator Tim Seely moved Hack/Slash from Devil's Due Publishing to Image Comics in June 2010.
