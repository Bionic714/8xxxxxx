As we went through the first decade of the new century, rock and metal received an infusion of the classic 70ΓÇ▓s sound. Now that we have entered our second decade, a renewed wave of 80ΓÇ▓s arena rock blending in with todayΓÇÖs hard rock and metal sound. More testosterone and less AquaNet, but all the great feel good, crank it up to 11 and lose your mind rock and roll.

WeΓÇÖve been waiting a long time for this release, but the band now has a new home at eOne Music who released the record on July 5th-the albumΓÇÖs ultimate independence day. And trust me, itΓÇÖs been worth the wait. 'War of Angels' is a serious dose of Viagra for the ears. If this record doesnΓÇÖt make you rock, hard, youΓÇÖre likely dead or deaf.

Producer Johnny K (Airbourne, Disturbed, Sevendust, Machine Head) has helped elevate the band and this album to the next level on War Of Angels, and you can hear his intensity as well as the bandΓÇÖs passion for making this project an epic release that can endure for years.

The record kicks off with the albumΓÇÖs first single, ΓÇ£Last Man StandingΓÇ¥ which is a hard driving, in your face, headbanger loaded with crunchy guitars and a right cross to the chin. Most albumΓÇÖs these days seem to front load one or two solid tracks at the beginning and the album gets progressively weaker from there on out, but believe me when I say, this opening volley is just the foundation for whatΓÇÖs to come.

Before you can even catch your breath, the band cranks it up another notch, carving an ΓÇ£EpitaphΓÇ¥ in your chest. This song is an angry, chew you up and spit you out, horns-up anthem, with lots of thick guitar rhythms.

ΓÇ£Broken and BetrayedΓÇ¥ is an angst driven number, which kicks off with a sweet rolling guitar riff, that takes us down a moody melodic path to the infectious chorus.

By this point youΓÇÖre about ready to slow it down, and the band obliges with a beautiful aching piece, ΓÇ£Monster You MadeΓÇ¥, which could be as much about the the lover who has broken you down, or a face to face look at the monster in the mirror.
For fans of classic 80ΓÇ▓s arena-lighter songs in the power ballad mold, ΓÇ£Let It GoΓÇ¥ should fill the ache nicely.

Then the band revs it up again, with the chugging rocker, ΓÇ£BossΓÇÖ DaughterΓÇ¥. This track is pure ear candy addiction, and a monster live on stage.

Next up is ΓÇ£Daisy ChainΓÇ¥, which kicks off with an opening riff and chorus that brings to mind, The Cult.

ΓÇ£PurpleΓÇ¥ is another dynamic, almost poetic gem of a lost-love song. ΓÇ£It only hurts when IΓÇÖm soberΓÇªΓÇ¥

The crunchy grinding guitars return in an edgy gallop for ΓÇ£Black & BlueΓÇ¥.

The album wraps up with the beautiful, ΓÇ£Next LifeΓÇ¥. While it wonΓÇÖt be on the regular version of the album, the band also recorded the catchy arena anthem, ΓÇ£Save the WorldΓÇ¥, which fans can still get for free (as of this writing) if they simply LIKE the bandΓÇÖspage.

The albumΓÇÖs bonus track (from the Deluxe Edition), ΓÇ£Good With the BadΓÇ¥, recalls Southern rock, with a Lynyrd Skynyrd meets The Black Crowes vibe.

'War of Angels' has no filler tracks, and sets the stage for Pop Evil to ascend a few rungs up the rock hierarchy. ItΓÇÖs strong from top to bottom, and youΓÇÖll be hard pressed to pry it from your CD player or iPod once you get your ears on it. 'War of Angels' brings us the battle of good versus Pop Evil.
