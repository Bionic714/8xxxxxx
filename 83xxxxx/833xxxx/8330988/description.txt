Sit 'N Ski Tour


Source: First 3 songs (AUD:  AKG 451 &gt; Oade m148) - rest DSBD &gt; DAT &gt; Standalone &gt; EAC

There is some PA hum throughout the show.. There is quite a bit of digi static during Wonderin', there was also a DO in Radio Child, and one in Mercy.. Some Board Static during JKMB, 2 pieces of digi at about 2:30 in Parsons and static at the start of D3.. Mr. Soul also cuts a bit early....OVERALL, sounds real nice though.. 

Alan Schwartz cleaned this as best as could (or anyone else for that matter)... Thanks to Steve Bohannon for the show.

The Sit 'N Ski tour had periodic issues in which the band wouldn't necessarily record the whole show (such as the first 3 tunes here).  Either that or their original DSBD recordings off the board had too much digi static that was unlistenable.
