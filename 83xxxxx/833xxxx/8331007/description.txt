#  minor dropout at beginning of 'Chilly Water' (nice mellow version of the tune)
=  encore is from fob source (sounds nice though);  From what other tapers are saying,there is not a DSBD of the encore
   
Encore source:  FOB stand @ 8' Sennheiser 421's &gt; Sony SBM-1 &gt; Denon  DTR-80P (16-bit/44.1kHz) &gt; master &gt; m-audio usb &gt; wavelab &gt; cd wave &gt; flac 


Note from an Audience Souce:  There is a strange shift in the channels on Chilly (it is also in the sbd and I remember it live, too).  The sbd's posted are incomplete and I personally really think this is a much meatier recording.  U B the judge.  A really good show from a great tour! The boyz were laid back, to say the least. The Orange Blossom was in memory of Chubby who passed just prior to the shows.
