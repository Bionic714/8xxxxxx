you guys keep it coming!!!

this movie was pretty awful, though. I turned it off cause it was just disturbing and sucked. I like horror, don't mind bloody/ violent movies, but this just made me want to stop watching even before halfway. If you get off on people being tortured, and want to torture yourself, might be a good movie for you. "
