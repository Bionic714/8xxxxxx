Mason & Dixon was one of the most acclaimed novels of the 1990s. According to prominent American critic Harold Bloom, "Pynchon always has been wildly inventive, and gorgeously funny when he surpasses himself: the marvels of this book are extravagant and unexpected." Harold Bloom has also called the novel "Pynchon's masterpiece to date."[citation needed] English author John Fowles, writing in The Spectator said of the book "As a fellow-novelist I could only envy it and the culture that permits the creation and success of such intricate masterpieces." T. Coraghessan Boyle of The New York Times Book Review wrote, "This is old Pynchon, the true Pynchon, the best Pynchon of all, Mason & Dixon is a groundbreaking book, a book of heart and fire and genius, and there is nothing quite like it in our literature," New York Times critic Michiko Kakutani said, "A novel that is as moving as it is cerebral, as poignant as it is daring... a book that testifies to Pynchon's remarkable powers of invention and his sheer power as a storyteller."
 In a conversation with Leonard Price of the Onion A.V. Club, Harold Bloom said, "I donΓÇÖt know what I would choose if I had to select a single work of sublime fiction from the last century....it would probably be Mason & Dixon, if it were a full-scale book, or if it were a short novel it would probably be The Crying Of Lot 49. Pynchon has the same relation to fiction, I think, that my friend John Ashbery has to poetry: he is beyond compare."
