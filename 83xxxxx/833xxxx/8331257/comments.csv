,commonsense7,2013-04-10T02:25Z,"Hey Ubiknik, You really should do your research before you talk because you DO sound like an idiot. First of all, Obama has spent more money then every president before him combined INCLUDING George W. Bush. He has done everything so far that Hitler did in the beginning. You think Hitler walked up there sayin "" Hey ya know, lets go kill some jews.""? No you fucking idiot. He started by taking control, peoples rights, and their guns (which by the way is our right to protect ourselves from criminals and the government as far as I'm concerned.) You're so called ""better option"" is interestingly enough asking all of his military up the ranks to general if they would shoot on American citizens if they were told to. If they say no, they would protect their country from enemies foreign AND DOMESTIC, then they are let go. Now you go ahead and tell me why this ""better evil"" would take away our weapons at the same time he is asking if our military if they would open fire on it's own people, which btw PAY HIS SALARY AND HIS VACATIONS!? Also, he has taken more vacations then any president. Hmmm?? still not making sense? Then yea I guess you are just a lost cause dumb ass liberal that chooses to use emotions and liberal media bias to make decisions rather than logic and facts. Do yourself a favor and shut the fuck up because you make all us TRUE Americans look bad."
,ubiknik,2013-04-10T06:28Z,"sure yeah, 'commonsense7': first the money than jump right into the Nazi analogy -your rant oozes drool between the lines. I kind of get the shoot our own citizens thing because it jibes with that conspiracy theory about all the prisons being built and making the poor poorer and the rich richer and the prisons being part of the prep for elite takeover etc. What I don't get is people actually believing republicans and democrats are any thing other than flavor variations on the same greedy puppet creatures, once in awhile one or two comes along with some seemingly good intentions or ideas etc. but until the game is debugged and unrigged were all getting our battleships sunk no matter where we put the pegs -unless you play along nice with pharmaceuticals, oil and Monsanto then you might get to keep a dingy.
All I know is that there are a hell of a lot of oZo_61's out there who put more energy into calling someone a dumbass (well I did call Jack_reacher a turd..) than pointing out something actually useful to know. I only voted at all because I have a girlfriend and I really don't need to give her something else to complain about like me having apathy for the whole sham system -my personal theory that I swear by is that humankind needs another 200 years before it even starts to straighten out -if were still around in those years we might have figured something out. Greed really does seem like the can of woop-ass that's been opened on us all, and like a bad horror movie it just eats us all up in the end. I mean fer cryin' out loud they got cameras on Arizona highways that will snap your picture and send you a $180.00 ticket in the mail for doing 66mph on a four lane freeway -in Illinois 66mph is a moped on the shoulder...we just got too many clowns in this country who think like the ones that put those cameras up -why not legalize pot and make a ton of revenue taxing it?!? oooh nooo, that's crazy.."
,ubiknik,2013-04-10T06:38Z,"-someone in Arizona told me that a guy got one of those tickets where it shows you in your car CLEARLY driving while you are speeding, so he thought he would give them a taste and sent back a photo of the $180 -2 weeks later he got back a picture of a pair of handcuffs.."

,libertaswv,2013-04-10T22:26Z,"lol ""commonsense"". According to the NRA's own opposition research, Obama had a better NRA rating than Romney, ffs. Look it up, professor. 

'Released in the fall of 2012, this is the N.R.A's own 'opposition research' for their campaign against Mitt Romney in the 2008 Republican Primary: They listed a series of bullet points:

During Romney's 1994 Massachusetts Senate race against Ted Kennedy, Romney backed the Brady Gun Control Bill and the assault weapons ban, saying, ""I don't line up with the NRA"" and ""that's not going to make me the hero of the NRA.""

Romney called the Clinton Crime Bill ""a big step forward""

As Governor, Romney quadrupled gun licensing fees and vowed not to ""chip away"" at tough gun laws.

In 2004, Romney signed a permanent state-level ban (in MA) on assault weapons that was modeled after the federal assault weapons ban.

In January of 2006, Romney said he owned a gun; two days later he admitted that he did not, and that the gun belonged to his son. 

Romney boasted of his ""lifetime"" membership in the NRA, but later revealed he didn't join until August 2006, just before launching his presidential campaign. His ""lifetime member"" comment misleadingly referred to an individual's ability to purchase a ""lifetime membership"" for one thousand dollars. 

At a 2006 press conference, Romney claimed he had been hunting ""many times"" after returning from a quail hunt in Georgia.

Romney later said he's ""been a hunter pretty much all my life,"" still later admitting that he had hunted only twice in his life; later clarifying remarks by claiming he has hunted ""small varmints... more than two times""

The Brady Campaign is a gun control group formed by former Reagan press secretary James Brady and his wife. Calling Obama's record on gun violence during his first term in office an ""abject failure,"" the Brady Campaign Against Gun Violence said Obama has ""failed to show leadership on the issue"". 

The Brady Group grades each president with a letter grade from A to F. 

'A' is very strict on gun control.

'F' is extremely lenient on gun control. 

President Obama has received an F in every category graded by the Brady Group. 

Copied from The Brady Center's website, here is the summary of their own first term report card on President Obama's gun policies. 

""The President’s concessions to the “guns anywhere” mentality of the gun lobby and lack of leadership for common-sense gun laws has earned him a grade of “F”.

President Obama signed legislation letting people carry concealed weapons in national parks and in checked luggage on Amtrak trains, adopted the gun lobby’s empty rhetoric about just “enforcing the laws on the books,” and muzzled Cabinet members who expressed support for stronger gun laws.

In addition, the White House voiced no objection to people carrying guns near Presidential events and his White House staff removed statements from the White House website that declared support for gun violence prevention laws.""

Elsewhere, The Brady Center complained that, ""The White House has parroted the NRA refrain that the solution to gun violence is simply to enforce the laws on the books."" After which, they quoted White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs saying. “I think the President believes that we can have a greater outcome in the short term working to enforce the laws that are on our books.” (April 2009)

To summarize: In just one year, Barack Obama has signed into law more repeals of federal gun policies than were repealed during President George W. Bush’s eight years in office

As President, Barack Obama has:

• Kept silent on closing the gun show loophole

• Maintained Bush-era destruction of Brady background check records

• Silenced Administration officials who spoke out in favor of banning assault weapons

• Maintained the Tiahrt Amendment and added a broad new gag order on law enforcement'

For instance, at what date did your current president outspend the combined amount of the previous forty-three?  When did he find the time?  Where did it all go?  And for what nefarious purpose???

Has the American military never before fired on and killed an American citizen?  What is the definition an American citizen?

If not on the applied eugenics ticket and its implied promise of prosperity, unification and strength, what political maneuvers did Adolf Hitler take to gain a foothold with the majority of the impoverished German people?  What has it got to do with the film Gangster Squad?  What are some more parallels between A. Hitler and B. Obama?

Are you allowed to vote?  If so, why?

Obama has a sketchy public approval rating.  What did he bring to the table to convince your people to vote for him instead of the Republican candidate?  

This shit is going to keep me up at night.

And meh, the movie quality is fine.

,JCamp31,2013-05-05T10:36Z,"""mcrowly"" You seem to be a little confused, or really uneducated about the type of spending OB has irrefutably spent as a President, not an individual. I.E. government spending of tax $. That being said, our government has borrowed more money through the presidency of OB than through any other president combined before him. 

As far as Hitler-You asked in what other ways Hitler attempted to gain a foothold of the impoverished. Why limit the footholds to just the impoverished, as if they were the only ones under a foothold during his regime? Hitler disarmed German citizens, he used food as an award for labor, he also believed in and used food as a weapon against his own ppl. 

I can give you actual quotes from his book if you like. 

Now I tend to believe more along the  lines of ubiknik. Not to say that I ever voted for OB, bc I didn't, but I would classify myself as a libertarian conservative, as well as a constitutionalist. 

You want spending numbers, I'll give you some. I want to see you refute it too, since you are all about proof of and proving lack of proof. 

Spending numbers our your president has never cared to change, yet shoves his,""if the repubs don't do this, then the sequester will do this!"" tactics as he disregards this: 

Treasury Dept: $37,829 of debt added every second. 

$2.2 million every minute. 

$136.19 million every hr. 

$3.268 billion every single day. 

Yet mcrowly denies OB has a spending problem as a president and country leader.
