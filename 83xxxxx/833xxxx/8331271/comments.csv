Was this TS? seemed like a regular cam copy to me. I thought a TS was a cam that is located in the projection booth with audio streamed direct from the projector (i'm no expert and could be wrong) but this is a standard cam complete with audience member movements and readjusting and such. Very dark in some night time scenes, a lot of picture flickering and numerous sync issues all the way through the movie. With all that said it's still completely watch-able if you just have to see it and can't wait.

Cheers "
,tomello,2013-04-07T19:05Z,Cam Rip no TS
,Heat55,2013-04-07T21:32Z,"if youre going to put the quality at a 9 for something like this, you should add ""for a cam"" at the end. use your brain"
[T],crwildman,2013-04-07T22:15Z,"For all the noobies, saying this isn't a TS ,and it is a CAM?  Are you idiots?  Hope you read and learn something.

TS means Telesync and refers to when they have recorded the movie with a camera but got the audio from a direct feed, usually from the headphone socket at a drive in."

,ScottyD7421,2013-04-09T06:32Z,"@crwildman, everyone starts off as a noob mate, would expect someone with a skull to be a little more patient with people but obviously that's just my opinion.

File says TS and yes TS stands for Telesync however this particular file doesn't ""appear"" to be TS, it ""appears"" to be a regular cam copy with regular cam audio. The camera ""appears"" to be located on a seat next to the chap taking the footage and the audio ""appears"" to be recorded from the same spot. Unless he has a fucking long cord running up to the projection booth which i doubt being the audio is second rate. 

I take it from the fact that you didn't rate the quality of the movie that you hadn't even watched it before commenting so i guess you just wanted to big note yourself on how you know what TS stands for which just makes your comments completely pointless.....Fuck-wad"
,andyfukinj,2013-04-12T05:59Z,"Now I know why all the movies with the ""TS"" tag are also camera- recorded shit piles. Thanks crwildman, I actually appreciate what you wrote.
