when this all began

We kept our computer on overnight
and we won the Pirates fight

Before starting your foreplay.
You simply turn off your display,
Then you would screw

Knowing  ThePirateBay grew
Just by leaving on my CPU

and our precious torrents would survive
But, to much surprise 
fewer would keep our torrents alive!

What happened.... it was all free?
Until a larger degree
of us were blind to see,
it wasn't all about ME ME ME!

Walmart  is ready to say
""$29.99 for a BluRay.""

Sorry The Pirate Bay, 
what can I say...

I hoped others would seed
So I didn't feel the need.
I download at max Speed
because of my by Greed

Songs & movies are leaving me Broke!
I wish I didn't treat it like a joke, 
Seeding is easy as a keystroke
Now I have my heartbroke.

You know I am not lying
So here is some bad rhyming
A warning, just to keep reminding
that Yo, most torrents are dying!

We can still Succeed
if we all double down our Seed
we can Exceed
Hope that is Agreed"
