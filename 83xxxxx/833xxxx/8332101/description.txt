Super Hit old classic movie Sahib BIbi Aur Ghulam (1962) Synopsis: Bhoothnath [Guru Dutt] comes to Calcutta in search of work and finds work as a servant in a rich household. He soon finds himself drawn to the zamindar s pretty young wife, commonly known as Chhoti Bahu [Meena Kumari], who in his view seems to lead a remarkably lonely life as she spends her long days waiting for her husband to return. Her husband spends his time steeped in alcohol and women, and so desparate is Chhoti Bahu to get him that she even takes to drinking to attune herself to his lifestyle. The film has a tragic undercurrent throughout, where the downfall of the Chowdhury household is symbolic of an era.
