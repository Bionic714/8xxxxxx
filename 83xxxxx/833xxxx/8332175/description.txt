River Monsters Season 4
For three successful seasons of Animal Planet's River Monsters, extreme angler Jeremy Wade has taken viewers along as he unravels freshwater fish tales of giant killers - where sometimes the fact really is stranger than the fiction! These voyages have taken him across the globe to waterways far and wide, all on an endless search for man-eating creatures that lurk below. He's caught dozens of these elusive beasts, typically in remote jungles and unexplored lands.



3)  Mongolian Mauler 
When he hears of a recent bloody attack in a remote Mongolian river, angler Jeremy Wade wonders if it could be the work of a giant fish so rare that it's more legend than fact. Pound for pound, this man-sized monster is said to be one of the strongest.
