,Desquitto,2013-04-04T13:38Z,Thank you for this pack.
,daxxon0o,2013-04-05T04:20Z,can you explain how we put mods in this cracked version?
,WDoubleYouW,2013-04-05T13:29Z,"@Desquitto
The same way you would put mods in a non-cracked version."
,Yuushuu,2013-04-06T17:17Z,"Thanks for this pack, I was waiting for something like that since long ago!

Btw, my download speed is very low (~3ko-10ko/sec), is it normal? (because not enough seeder right now?)"
,WDoubleYouW,2013-04-06T18:03Z,"@Yuushuu
Download may be slow right now, but should pick up in a week or so. I'm seeding this thing at 11 Mbps, but with 263 leechers and 149 seeders ATM, it's gonna be slow for a bit. Should fluctuate quite a lot too."
,TheShmyt,2013-04-07T07:13Z,"I hope this is legit, waaaaaaaay better than downloading 6 different files from different uploaders! You, sir, get your common sense badge."
,Yuushuu,2013-04-08T03:19Z,"@WDoubleYouW

Thanks for your reply.
Actually it also might be a problem from my computer, since TPB is banned in China the DNS can't connect to the UDP server, anyway I got luck to have a good seeder so I got it.

I have a poor connection but it's better than no seed.

Thanks for this pack!"
,Joakko27,2013-04-08T09:22Z,"I have saves from the razor1911 release, will they work on this one?"
,WDoubleYouW,2013-04-08T13:46Z,"@Joakko27
Yes, they will work."
,ayedawg,2013-04-09T07:05Z,"Dont bother, launcher does not launch the exe file. in-game saving freezes the game. save files getting corrupted "
,Joakko27,2013-04-09T09:22Z,"@WDoubleYouW Thanks. By the way, amazing torrent, works like a charm."

,WDoubleYouW,2013-04-10T06:16Z,"@ianpals24
You can continue your old saved game."
,jackett,2013-04-10T19:15Z,"@WDoubleYouW
loving the fact that you made this repack, however i can't get the install to work. whenever I run the skyrim launcher, it just crashes. Please help. If it's related in anyway to the problem, I choose to install with skse, wryebash, algoboost, and script dragon."
,Doltear,2013-04-11T10:48Z,"Thanks @WDoubleYouW (: your the baws hah... Hey dude um, any chance the Online mod would work with this? Cheers."

,luigginote,2013-04-18T05:22Z,"thanks, work great!

I can use steam with this game to get mods?"
,SymVoid,2013-04-22T00:37Z,"One problem. The Creation Kit is buggy with this version. It crashes almost every 5-20 minutes while working. 

https://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8312542/The.Elder.Scrolls.V.Skyrim.Creation.Kit.v1.9.32.0-DMN32

This one works fine, been using it for hours and have had NO problems. Everything else works wonders :) Thanks."
,nikola950801,2013-04-22T16:02Z,"My DLCs won't work, just main game. Please, anyone know how to fix this?"
,marcusn,2013-04-23T01:53Z,"@nikola950801, try this 

https://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8111368"
,adamhbk,2013-04-28T09:18Z,"Works fine for me and I'm seeding it right now.
I had problems when i downloaded another torrent and downloaded SKSE for it, but this fixed everything."
,adamhbk,2013-04-28T09:27Z,"@nikola950801
I maybe know a fix.
If you open the game and the menu comes up (play/options/data files/etc...) and there is the 'Data files' gray/white.
White: Go there and check the 'mods' (DLCs)
Gray: Go: Documents>My games>Skyrim
there you open the file 'SkyrimPrefs.ini' and find '[Launcher]' in it. under that you write: bEnableFileSelection=1
and it should be fine.
I hope it'll work."
,nikola950801,2013-04-28T16:39Z,"It's not that it's greyed. I can check DLCs but when I start the game, I can't get the missions, nor I see new locations. :P"
,nikola950801,2013-04-28T16:47Z,"Oh, and yes, my level is 60. I Completed almost every quest in the game and now I want to kick some vampire asses! ^_^"
,BasilicaHands,2013-04-29T14:10Z,how can i get this to install through my steam account?
,KensiroK,2013-04-30T01:15Z,Dl so slow 42.0kb/s please seed
,smokinkama,2013-04-30T04:12Z,"sweet, 2.0 kb/s"
,11western,2013-05-04T23:16Z,"BIG Thanks to the uploader. works great, even fixed my install for the base game, ( never had the window with options etc, game would just start).
Soon as I started, killed a dragon (with arrow over it's head) and dawnguard started.
No problems yet!!"
,sofr3shx,2013-05-05T21:50Z,So I have no ide what I'm doing. Tried to activate dawnguard quest. Didn't work. Some bitch contacted me about adopting some kid so I'm not sure if thats one of the DLCs. I tried downloading that DLC Install Fix but don't know what to do with it. Confused. Need Help.
,WDoubleYouW,2013-05-05T23:51Z,"@sofr3shx
The person who notified you about adopting children is from the Hearthfire DLC, so I think you should be fine. Make sure that all three DLC are checked in the SkyrimLauncher Data files."
,sofr3shx,2013-05-06T01:32Z,They are checked. I started a new game and I havent gotten a letter about the adopting thing. I've been going from whiterun to riverwood to riften to activate dawnguard. I havent checked on dragonborn though. 
,WDoubleYouW,2013-05-06T02:44Z,Hearthfire activates after you kill the first dragon (I think). Dawnguard activates after you reach level 10. Dragonborn activates after your first visit with the Greybeards.
,DaBanzaiFish,2013-05-08T23:24Z,"V2
-Fixed bug where previous Skyrim installs would interfere with ability to select files in Data section of SkyrimLauncher

This still does not work for me. The game does not allow me to select the data files during the Skyrimlauncher. Can anyone help?"
,WDoubleYouW,2013-05-09T01:03Z,"Try using the install fix:
https://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8111368"
,DaBanzaiFish,2013-05-09T04:30Z,I clicked the link it says the page doesn't exist xD
,DaBanzaiFish,2013-05-09T04:36Z,okay i found it but it says that launcher variables could not be reset?
,landlord352,2013-05-15T01:15Z,"is this a steamless version?!  i so hate steam versions as steam is invasive will force you to update online and will break mods that require SKSE .  I actually bought this game,but looking for a steamless version."
,WDoubleYouW,2013-05-15T02:53Z,"@landlord352
This is cracked so you don't have to use Steam."
,Saber92,2013-05-16T00:03Z,"everything i downloaded from this site is 872kb and yes....it's a virus, idk why or what is this,pleeeeaaaaase help!"
,WDoubleYouW,2013-05-16T02:11Z,"@Saber92
Don't click on all the ads. You need to:
1. Download and install a torrent client (like utorrent)
2. Click the ""Get this torrent"" magnet link."
,landlord352,2013-05-18T02:36Z,"A nice packaged,easy installer and Steamless! Thanks DoubleYou and a tankard of mead for you!!! 
I was'nt able to mount game with Daemon Tools Light,but its easy to install if you have WinRar just unrar and run the setup.exe  Hey guys check out Deadly Mutilations Mod.  Its like Deadly Reflex Oblivion,but for Skyrim. The mod works great with this version here 1.9.32.0.8    Im SEEDING this masterpiece"

,Sephtyan,2013-05-18T18:00Z,"When I open up the Skyrim Launcher, both ""Options"" and ""Data Files"" are greyed out, and in place of ""Play"" it says ""Install"". If you click ""install,"" nothing happens. Anything I've done wrong?"
,Skadi2748,2013-05-18T20:39Z,"Seed, please."
,WDoubleYouW,2013-05-18T23:45Z,"@Sephtyan

Try running SkyrimLauncher as administrator and click install."
,tbarnz,2013-05-20T21:39Z,"hey do you have to absolutely burn the game onto a disk i have dual disk drivers bt no cd's, if i have to what kind of disks do i need?"
,WDoubleYouW,2013-05-20T23:44Z,You don't have to burn a disk. You can mount it with a program like Daemon Tools. Or you can extract with WinRAR or 7-Zip.

,aussiedanny,2013-06-03T11:09Z,hope I can download
,Leonardonardo,2013-06-04T19:42Z,"@WDoubleYouW
I'm extremely sorry for bothering you but I'm in dire need of help. I downloaded your torrent as soon as it was uploaded which took me almost a week, which is why I'm frustrated. I tried installing the game multiple times but every time the meshes file and the dawnguard DlC wont install correctly ( I get a message that these files are corrupted ). I tried everything possible with no luck. I even downloaded the torrent again twice. Whenever I try to run the game I get a black screen after the Bethesda logo with only fog visible and when I try to start a new game the game just crashes. Any help would be much appreciated. And thank you for the awesome torrent."
