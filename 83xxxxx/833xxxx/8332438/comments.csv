,nerdygeek,2013-04-04T23:00Z,thanks for these wonderful upload. can i make a request though? will it be possible for you to upload all the x-titles in one torrent? :D or multiple torrents by title. i know this is asking too much but i would really appreciate it. thanks :D
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-05T01:54Z,"i'm not sure i would survive trying that. if you ask me for 2 or 3 of them that you want the most, AND if i can't give you a link where you can easily find them in a torrent right now, i'll be glad to do that."
,nerdygeek,2013-04-07T02:21Z,"uncanny xmen (1-544), xmen forever and xfactor :) i would really be forever grateful if you can help me find those :) thanks :)"
