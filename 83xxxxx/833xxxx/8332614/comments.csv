,hightmare,2013-04-06T00:36Z,i have expired the trial period and deleted the old sygic file by mistake so i have to make a new clean install what should i do?
,zlamar,2013-04-07T05:27Z,"Will it work with maps from your post: ""Sygic_v.13.1.0_Europe_2012.10_Maps.rar""
and with this: ""Sygic_Android_Latest_LoquendoTTS_Voices 27.03.2013.rar""?
And one more question:
In subfolder ""maps"" from ""Sygic_13.1.0_TTS_Full_SP.rar"" there is ""WCL"" + ""content""... and also in ""Sygic_v.13.1.0_Europe_2012.10_Maps.rar"", there is ""WCL"" +""content""...?
Which ""WCL"" folder and which ""content"" should be in Sygic/Map folder on phone, which one we should use?"

What could be the problem?
