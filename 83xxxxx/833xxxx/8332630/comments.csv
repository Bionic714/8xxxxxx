and with this: ""Sygic_Android_Latest_LoquendoTTS_Voices 27.03.2013.rar""?
And one more question:
In subfolder ""maps"" from  ""Sygic_13.1.0_TTS_Full_SP.rar"" there is ""WCL"" + ""content""... and also in ""Sygic_v.13.1.0_Europe_2012.10_Maps.rar"", there is ""WCL"" +""content""...?
Which ""WCL"" folder and which ""content"" should be in Sygic/Map folder on phone, which one we should use?"

It will work with 2012.10 maps.
And alo with to latest TTS files.
I have made both ""wcl,content"" in all my maps uploads, because some users only use the maps
In your case, use the content from ""Sygic_13.1.0_TTS_Full

Have fun :)"
