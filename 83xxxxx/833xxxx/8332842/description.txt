The making of a great album has everything to do with timing, and songwriter Tamara Lindeman's second release as The Weather Station was caught at just the right moment. After several unsuccessful studio sessions, Lindeman made the wise choice to put her new record in the hands of fellow Canadian songster Daniel Romano. Together, in the comfort of Romano's home studio, they worked through the songs one by one, arranged on the spot, and recorded without hesitancy. Several days passed, studio tracks completely scrapped, and All of It Was Mine was complete.


Without pressure and studio expectations, the album was given room to reveal itself naturally, finding a warmth and power within the simplicity of well written folk songs. Tamara Lindeman's intimate style breathes new life into singer-songwriter folk music. Like a conversation with a close friend, her voice speaks gently and with clarity over each track, sharing vivid stories of home and idyllic summer settings. That's not to say Daniel Romano didn't masterfully craft some great moments in production ΓÇô because he most certainly did ΓÇô but for the most part, minus a few stray electric guitars, snare drums, and vocal harmonies, All of It Was Mine is a collection of spontaneous, understated perfection.
