POtHS says:
This is good for all ages.  These films are of a much higher Quality than The History Channels portrayal of The Bible.

Description:


Noah's Ark and the Fall in the Garden of Eden are woven together in this absorbing version of two familiar stories. When the Flood comes, Noah and his family begin life in the Ark, and as the storm rages outside, Noah plays storyteller, waving the tale of Adam and Eve, god and the Serpent through the dark days on the water. Noah's story is told in cell animation. In contrast, the Garden of Eden is hauntingly depicted by the technique of paint on glass.

JESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.

Born of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.


 
Seed long and Prosper with Blessings from our Father. I have prayed to The Father, Bless all that Seed Long. (I have 4 year old active seeds out there, must be working for some folks!)

Ephesians 5:11
11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove (expose) them.
