,antiseed,2013-04-04T08:02Z,"Just downloaded the sample, A/V is 10/10.. hardcodded asian subs as per description which expand over 2 lines. The video size is already 720x304 and the subs take up more than 1/3 of the video... but if you can live with the subs and a half wasted height it looks like a good copy."
,pirate4584,2013-04-04T08:27Z,its a fake!!! dont download
,actionwilliams,2013-04-04T09:03Z,"fuck off and die pirate4584.
It's real. V good quality: V8, A9. The Chinese subs are big and distracting (for me), but hey, thanks for the upload BONE."

assholes"
,Kalecgos,2013-04-04T17:32Z,"a) it's real
b) as nobody mentioned it yet: yes the subtitles are pretty big and you will probably find them distracting, there's also a watermark for an URL (ripper's?) and a small picture of some asian girl pops up in a corner once
c) audio is pretty good, and the video quality look good on the sample screenshots, BUT the video is choppy and has tiny (fraction of a second) hangs once in a while"
,webmonk42,2013-04-04T18:06Z,"Wow, I know it's hard to find good writers these days but this movie barely even tried. The ending is terrible, the jokes are barely funny and yes, I think Chris Angel / David Blaine stuff really isn't old school magic but they relied heavily way to heavily on that. Steve Buscemi is a wicked bad guy but here's he's in the wrong role. Terrible movie. Waste of time, barely any laughs. Shame on you hollywood."
,Wonlegged,2013-04-04T18:10Z,most subs can be removed by del the txt file
,Farcry43,2013-04-04T18:21Z,Its free so subs won't bother me much.
,crcfail,2013-04-04T21:58Z,"V:2

Another choppy video that seems to be missing every other frame or something. It's like a video game with low FPS, terrible release."
,kazmandu,2013-04-04T22:06Z,"will you fuckheads just type what the a/v is and keep your fucking huffington post article bullshit to yourself, we dont give a fuck of your opinion you fucktard"
,lassik2,2013-04-05T00:24Z,"Ok so here's the deal. There's some obvious shit wrong with the rip but you have to ask yourself. ""Do I really give a shit considering the movie that this is?""

This movie isn't some action packed, graphic intense, thriller. It's a sub-par comedy at best. Don't get me wrong. I enjoyed some parts. 

For the quality. I don't rate in numbers because that means jack shit. Everyone has their own idea of what the numbers mean. 

-There are fairly large Chinese subtitles throughout the film. 
-The video goes in and out of sync a few times. 
-It's pretty choppy in the beginning but get a little better as you go on.
-Random ads for some site dy161 dot com keeps showing up from time to time. 2 times an actual image popped up in the lower corner.
-For some reason the audio is VERY low. I had to crank up my volume.


Overall, I still think it's a watchable copy. Once you commit to it, you can really just ignore a lot of the annoying shit that keeps popping up. If this were some action film with cool fight scenes then I wouldn't have bothered. That's why I say that you really have to take in to consideration the type of movie this is.

As for the dy161 dot com site. If you're curious about what's there. It's a Chinese site and as i'm sure most of you are aware, the Chinese are extremely perverted people. The site is just a bunch of endless porn loops and no real content. It's SPAM basically.

Enjoy!"
,isteal2,2013-04-05T00:55Z,"Bone wtf....

,Afzal8920,2013-04-06T04:50Z,nice
,aoxo,2013-04-06T06:53Z,Shit copy.  Choppy Framerate..probably telecine/cam rip...run through a few different ringers...with hardcoded chinese subs.  It's got half of some chinese marquee running along the top like a stock market ticker.  Why don't people wait for the DVD release and rip those instead of going through all the trouble of making a piece of trash like this?  Fuck this torrent.
,aoxo,2013-04-06T07:09Z,"I watched 10 seconds of this movie.  You people that post A/V ratings need your eyes examined.  The framerate is borked, the encoding has been through the ringer more than once, probably when some idiot baked in chinese subs and shit flying all over the screen.  Even if you can get past the subs and framerate problems...the picture quality is terrible.

Seriously people stop throwing around A:10, V:10 all the time willy nilly.  This video is a V:2 at best."

Audio was superb for a new release. Video was high quality, but hard coded asian subs + a small popup that shows up only twice. Easy to ignore that shit unless you have a brain injury or some shit. Movie was fucking funny, Jim Carrey is brilliant. If you know who David Copperfield and David Blaine are, you'll get most of the humor. It's not as good as Anchorman but it's still worth a 7/10 imo."
,spockette,2013-04-11T09:56Z,"I really just dont notice the subs, AT ALL.

Great upload. The (HC) subs are a tad large but eventually you just forget there there as your watching the movie. Occasionally some small banners or ads pop up on the side and there is a light small watermark located at the top right hand corner of the screen. Nothing too intrusive. Very watchable DVD quality. The movie itself is very good too. Mediocre plot but lots of laughs. Jim Carrey's character is brilliant. FAST DOWNLOAD 10minutes 1.5-2MBps. "

,nerdrage12,2013-04-12T20:43Z,"Hey fucktards who cry and piss in their panties about hard coded Chinese subs or water marks or ads, get off your lazy fat asses and go get a better copy. Don't fucking act like TPB is some consumer website where you can demand nothing but the best in product and then act like you've been cheated when you download something that isn't up to your fucking unrealistic standards. 

This shit isn't easy to get and you ungrateful cock gobblers need to either contribute to the site with something better or just fucking download it, delete it and move on rather than tear into an uploader who DIDN'T NEED TO FUCKING TAKE THE TIME TO UPLOAD A GOD DAMN THING SO YOU CAN DOWNLOAD SHIT FOR FREE. Do you not fucking understand that? These uploaders do this shit out of the goodness of their hearts, they get nothing out of it. They don't fucking make a penny off of you download their shit. 

So grow the fuck up and give constructive feedback if you feel so compelled but don't fucking flame their comments section just because your inbred hillbilly ass couldn't see past some subtitles and you somehow think you're entitled to watch a fucking movie in God damn Blu-Ray quality less than a month after its release in theaters.

Ungrateful little cunts...."
,Pseudoplaydo,2013-04-13T07:50Z,"Well said nerdrage. With the popularity of pirating through torrents, these ungrateful twats are flooding the community. "
,paulysvision,2013-04-13T19:27Z,"Wonlegged, it is played in a chinese theatre so the subs are on the screen, hence why people call them hardcoded, because they are apart of the video. To remove them would be to remove part of the video itself which is even more annoying.

Most people just get so shitted off at these chinese HD rips because people recording in english theatres cannot match the Chinese HD cam quality. The chinese are doing something right becasue they have the best video quality on first release cams, people just get so annoyed that we can't make them this good and thus we have to endure the overly large subtitles.
Overall i don't care about the subtitles, if there's a movie in chinese HD rip and i couldn't be bothered with the subtitles i just wait, not a big deal like some others make it out to be.

A:7/V:7 Watchable for sure, as long as you don't mind the subtitles and occasional pop ups that only happen a handfull of times throughout the whole movie."

,LordChen2,2013-04-14T00:35Z,"Thanks for the up, Bone.

Please include hc chinese subs in the title next time so people know to avoid this until a better version comes out.

If this is a camrip then it's one of the best.
P.S. there are some of us, trying to learn Chinese, who appreciate the subtitles. So they're not wasted on everybody."
,kingbob182,2013-04-27T05:12Z,"Why are people rating this 9/10 video? 9/10 video is a HD DVD or a poorly encoded blu ray. 
I'm glad someone took the time to upload this but it's about a 6/10 (which is still good for such a new release) but stop trying to kiss up to the uploader for whatever reason."
,azisco,2013-04-29T05:36Z,"V 5/10. Chinese subtitles and shit, plus some annoying watermarks, popups, and the quality wasn't great.

A 7/10. Not bad

Quality wasn't too bad overall though and the movie was pretty funny, if not a bit short."
