Notes:

Kevin Smith's first movie after Clerks, and not my favorite of his movies, but this one is going up per someone's request AND because there were no high quality low file size torrents of Mallrats in 720p. There are other 720's, but not in decent file sizes. So please seed as much as possible.

Bitrates listed are variable, using multi-pass encoding for maximum quality, which means the numbers you see are average bitrates.

Please note that my bitrates and file sizes are optimized for those who store and watch movies on their computers. The bitrates are high enough to look perfect on "normal" sized monitors and low enough to keep download times short and the file size small enough for those who have limited hard drive space to work with. If you plan on watching something on a large HD screen, you may need one of the larger file size, higher bitrate torrents. The larger the screen you'll be watching on, the higher the bitrate has to be to maintain picture quality. If you have a large screen, you'll need to experiment too see what bitrate it takes to maintain a quality picture for your particular size screen.

Please seed as long as possible, preferably until reaching a share ratio of at least 3:1.
