I downloaded new Asia,India maps with base files and replaced my whole Maps folder by deleting old maps but when I start the Sygic it shows the Buy Sygic option. I think its no longer cracked. Can you please advice."

,khimbhai,2013-04-08T20:18Z,"Thanks for quick response bro.

After downloading new maps(Only India maps as I removed other countries from txt file attached with dowloader) with base files, I don't have content.info and content.lic files in it(As I removed old maps files). Also I'm not using wcl folder given in your another release Sygic_v.13.1.0_TTS_Full_Content_SP.rar as it's been deleted.

When I starts the app, It shows me options to buy sygic, manage maps.. And Quit option.
When I select the manage maps, it restores some license info and gives me world map trial access but in the list it doesn't show India maps as it is already downloaded but not working.

Please assist, your help really appreciated. Thanks in advance."
