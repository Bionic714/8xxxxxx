,Bflocka1,2013-04-05T03:53Z,"Good rip. DVD quality. Hardcoded chinese subs, get used to them over time. "
,plagasx,2013-04-07T00:44Z,"Very watchable in my opinion. Once you get past the Chinese subs..

Thanks."

I really hate seeing that on my screen, and it distracts significantly. Other than the subs this is a wonderful download, and good quality. Worth the DL if you dont mind the subs. Other torrents on TPB all seem to have the subs as well, god only knows why."
