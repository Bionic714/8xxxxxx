IMDB Info

Noitia, a town on GaliciaΓÇÖs Atlantic coast, during the late 1960s. Fins and Brinco are
two teenage friends who are also rivals over slightly older Leda. The girl soon shows her
preference for Fins, whom she encourages to hunt for shipwreck treasures that wash up on the
shore even as their relationship develops from a simple friendship into the intimacy of first
love. Their affair is suddenly interrupted when Fins is forced to leave the town after the
accidental death of both his and her father when they were practising blast fishing . When
Fins ΓÇönow turned a copΓÇöreturns to his hometown twenty years later, he realises that everything
is changed in Noitia: the traditional smuggling networks have turned into a drug-dealing business
controlled by the shady Mariscal, who is also the lover of BrincoΓÇÖs mother. In fact, Brinco
himself has become the drug lordΓÇÖs right-hand man and is also the father of LedaΓÇÖs son. Fins
will investigate the couple with a zeal that goes beyond the requirements of his job as a
narcotics cop: the situation leads to a mishmash of old affections, loyalties and duties.
