Somewhere in every good music fan's basement is a worn-out copy
of either the vinyl, eight-track, or cassette of Black Sabbath's
We Sold Our Soul for Rock 'n' Roll. The 1976 compilation captured
the darkest and beefiest moments from the Ozzy years and served
as a right of passage for millions of aspiring musicians
burnouts, pastor's kids, and closet miscreants. Rhino's 16-track
Greatest Hits 1970-1978 anthology only trumps the single-disc We
Sold Our Soul CD by two songs, but it offers superior sound and
features at least a few cuts from 1976's Technical Ecstasy and
1978's Never Say Die!, the band's last two pre-millennium Ozzy
records. All of the faves are here ("Paranoid," "War Pigs," "Iron
Man"), as well as fan classics like "Hole in the Sky" and
"Supernaut," but there is enough material missing to call it a
sampler rather than a "best of." Fans who are unwilling to shell
out the extra money for Sanctuary's superior two-disc Sabbath
collection from 2005 will find this sparse yet solid overview to
be a useful "CliffsNotes" rendering of the birth of heavy metal
