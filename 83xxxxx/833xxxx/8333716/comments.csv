There are several points in this episode where the screen goes black and the scene changes in the middle of something happening. The scene where the kid's mother visits and she asks for Robin's help and then it cuts to her trailer mid-sentence.  Or when Robin gets a phone called while she's talking to Johnno, she reaches for the phone and the scene cuts to the next morning."
