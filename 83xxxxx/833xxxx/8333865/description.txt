Red is definitely my color. Good thing, because in my line of work, I end up wearing it a lot.

Most people shy away from blood, but for an assassin like meΓÇö Gin Blanco, aka the SpiderΓÇöitΓÇÖs just part of the job. Still, it would be nice to get a night off, especially when IΓÇÖm attending the biggest gala event of the summer at Briartop, AshlandΓÇÖs fanciest art museum. But itΓÇÖs just not meant to be. For this exhibition of my late nemesisΓÇÖs priceless possessions is not only the place to be seen, but the place to be robbed and taken hostage at gunpoint as well. No sooner did I get my champagne than a bunch of the unluckiest thieves ever burst into the museum and started looting the place.

Unlucky why? Because I brought along a couple of knives in addition to my killer dress. Add these to my Ice and Stone magic, and nothing makes me happier than showing the bad guys why red really is my color.
