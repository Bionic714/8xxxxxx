High school can be a battlefield, but for Lily Parker, surviving at St. SophiaΓÇÖs School for Girls is a matter of life and death...

Protecting Chicago from the dark side can be an exhausting job, especially when youΓÇÖre a junior. So when the girls of St. SophiaΓÇÖs start gearing up for Sneak, their fall formal, Lily decides to join in on some good, old-fashioned party prepΓÇöeven if it means not giving demons, vampires and the twisted magic users known as Reapers her undivided attention.

But when a Reaper infiltrates the school, Lily doesnΓÇÖt forget what sheΓÇÖs sworn to protect. She reaches deep into herself to draw out her magicΓÇöand finds that itΓÇÖs gone. And it turns out sheΓÇÖs not alone. A magical blackout has slammed through paranormal Chicago, and no one knows whatΓÇöor whoΓÇöcaused it. But Lily knows getting back her magic is worth the risk of going behind enemy lines...
