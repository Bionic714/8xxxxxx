Release Info:

In NINJA GAIDEN 3: RAZOR'S EDGE, the enigmatic warrior Ryu Hayabusa must
fight to lift a curse that threatens to destroy him. Developed by Team NINJA,
the fighting game was designed from the ground up to satisfy core NINJA GAIDEN
series fans with a redesigned battle system, improved enemy AI, greatly
reduced QTE interactive sequences, and the bloody return of dismemberment.
Even with severed arms or legs, enemies will fight on and players will find
they have to constantly change up their attacks to win tough battles - the
challenge level leaves very little room for error. However, with perfect
attacks players can not only cut off limbs but slice an enemy completely in two!
