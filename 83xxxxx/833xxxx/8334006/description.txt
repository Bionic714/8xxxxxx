Getting the most efficient use from your avionics in the IFR system can often be challenging, but is essential for safe flight. This program on flying WAAS approaches with the Garmin 430W/530W gives pilots the knowledge needed to fly these new instrument approaches with confidence. In this program, weΓÇÖll examine the redesigned RNAV (GPS) approach charts. You will learn the specifics of LNAV/VNAV and LPV approaches and see how they provide ILS-like guidance when using the Garmin 430W, one of the most popular panel-mount units. YouΓÇÖll ride along on three flights to see, step-by-step, how to set-up and fly three different GPS approaches including an LPV approach. Learn how the unit provides turn-by-turn guidance for flying procedure turns and holding patterns and how the 430W uses WAAS information to provide an electronic glidepath and more accurate navigation guidance.
