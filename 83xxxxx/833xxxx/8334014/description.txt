Air Date: 2013-04-01

In the Season 8 premiere, the women are navigating a minefield of fractured friendships. Vicki embraces the joys of "grandmotherhood" when daughter Briana gives birth to a baby boy. Tamra moves in with fiancée and new business partner, Eddie, while Gretchen must deal with her business ventures alone, as longtime boyfriend Slade gets a job of his own. Heather throws an East Coast-style clambake in her West Coast backyard, but refuses to invite Alexis. The clambake reaches a boiling point when Vicki and Tamra come face-to-face for the first time since last year's brawl over Vicki’s beau, Brooks.
