,Knan4051,2013-04-13T21:53Z,wmp? I think mp4 is the most normal/common container (although mkv is quickly becoming the norm)
,FattyXP,2013-04-16T23:08Z,lol @ wmv. You should NEVER have EVER encoded a movie into wmv format. There are much much better alternatives with much better compression and compatibility. Not everyone wants to use Winblows and Winblows Media Destroyer.
