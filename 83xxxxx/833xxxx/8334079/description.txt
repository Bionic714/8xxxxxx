Its the second round of the second match for the tag team season. 
 Team Dragon Serena Blair (wrestler) Mistress Kara (wrestler) Dragon Lily ( coach) Team Nightmare Isamar Gutierrez(wrestler) Beretta James (wrestler) Syd Blakovich (coach) Serena was startled in the first round when her foot got trapped underneath her. She was pulled out of round 2 for safety reasons. Dragon was so impressed with Mistress Kara's performance in round 1 she decides she really wants to sock it to Nightmare but showboating and having Mistress Kara stay out for round 2 two. This could be a really great decision or a really bad decision. Dragon is confident it will be a really good decision
