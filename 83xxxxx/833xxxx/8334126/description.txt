allSTARS* were a British pop group, who were active between 2001 and 2002, enjoying some chart success in the UK. Consisting of Sandi Lee Hughes, Thaila Zucchi, Ashley Taylor Dawson, Rebecca Hunter and Sam Bloom (the first letter of each band member's name making up the "stars" of their group name), they were probably best noted for having their own television show, STARStreet*, on CITV between 2001 and 2002.



AllSTARS* is the only self-titled debut album released by allSTARS*. It was released on 13 May 2002. It charted at No.43 - spending only 2 weeks in the UK Album Charts. After that, the band parted ways with their record company, Island, and split up soon after, in June 2002
