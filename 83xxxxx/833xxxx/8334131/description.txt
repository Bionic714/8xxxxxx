Wikipedia:
Gov't Mule is the self-titled debut album of southern rock/jam band Gov't Mule.
It has a very jam oriented feel to it and was produced and mostly recorded live by Michael Barbiero in Bearsville Recording Studios with many tracks running into each other. "Mule" is still a concert favorite, and "Rockin' Horse" was later recorded by The Allman Brothers Band when Warren Haynes rejoined the group for the album Hittin' the Note.
