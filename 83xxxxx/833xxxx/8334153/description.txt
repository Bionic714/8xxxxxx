Partially Deceased Syndrome sufferer Kieren Walker returns home to the
cauldron of Roarton, but doesn't receive a warm welcome from all. His
parents, Steve and Sue, are undoubtedly pleased to see him, but his
sister, Jem, isn't so ready to pick up where they left off when Kieren
died back in 2009. Meanwhile, the zombie-hating Human Volunteer Force,
led by the violent Bill Macy, are ready to take action against any PDS
sufferer reintegrated on their patch.

Feeling trapped at home, Kieren escapes to his grave where he is reunited
with his old hunting partner, Amy Dyer, who persuades him to take a
dangerous day trip. After fleeing when he is spotted, Kieren discovers
that Rick, his former best mate who died in Afghanistan, is back in town
and is persuaded by Amy to go and see him at partisan local pub, The Legion.
After an awkward reunion, Kieren finds himself on an HVF hunting mission
in the woods, where the night patrol has reported live rabid zombies
roaming free.
