Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site :: On the Tuesday, April 2 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex breaks down the accelerating economic war waged by the banksters and the global elite against the American people and humanity at large. He takes a look at the growing bankruptcies of American cities that are struggling to remain viable under an ocean of red ink and pension obligations for an army of government bureaucrats. Alex also confronts a wave of gun laws proposed and enacted by enemies of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
