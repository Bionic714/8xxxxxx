If this is your first time reading about Isochronic tones, I'm not going to take the time to explain t when you can google it and research it yourself. But in brief, It's better than both binaural and monaural tones and can be listened to just using speakers, although better results may be achieved with modern stereo headphones. I have two other tones I collected from different people of the same quality, but I won't upload those unless I get positive feedback. 

Also, it should be noted that you should really turn off any equalizer (EQ) when listening to this because it can deeply impact the effectiveness of this tone since the whole purpose of them is to have it at the right frequency balance to create an effect.

The reason why I call this 'Top Quality' is because you currently won't find a better version anywhere else. This was purchased off of a website for a more than just a few bucks as these are not cheap when looking for something that's effective. The website this was acquired from is listed below and typed backwards to prevent trace-back of the websites material when googling it. (Sorry to be so cautious). So anyways, just read it backwards or type it backwards to read it.
