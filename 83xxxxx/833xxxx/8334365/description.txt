The final book of the Bible, called both Revelation and Apocalypse, prophesises what ill happen at the end of time. During the Middle Ages, in a society which deeply believed in God and was mainly ruled by religious authorities, this theme has often been used in art. Its symbolic content allowed for many different interpretations, using various types of support (tapestries, illuminations, sculpture, and painting). This book pools the most famous pieces of art inspired by this theme, such as the Apocalypse drapery from the cathedral of Angers, the carved tympanum of the Autun cathedral, and the fresco in Albi cathedral. The theme of the Apocalypse was a means to impress minds while also allowing artists to develop their imaginations.
