Gabe has starred in MiaΓÇÖs fantasies more than once, ever since she was a teenager with a huge crush on her brotherΓÇÖs best friend. So what if GabeΓÇÖs fourteen years older? Mia knows heΓÇÖs way out of her league, but her attraction has only grown stronger with time. SheΓÇÖs an adult now, and thereΓÇÖs no reason not to act on her most secret desires.
