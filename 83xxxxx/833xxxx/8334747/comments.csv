Chasing Rainbows and Join The Club are wrong - the titles should be switched. And since you made the files read-only, I can't correct it. I hope you suffer a painful and untimely death. Douche."
,christiandgo,2013-05-19T04:25Z,"ok TheFireBrand... if you really want to be a douche and trash talk somebody that is doing something so gracious by giving you a cd for free, just go die already because if you are going to cry over something so petty like song names, you must really have nothing good going on in your life and it would be pointless for you to carry on any further with you sad pathetic life."

Just right-click the folder and then click properties, uncheck read-only.
Ta-da, Magic."
