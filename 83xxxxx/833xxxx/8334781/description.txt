She moves in with friend Darla and Darla's young daughter Wendy to start over. But Magdalene soon confesses that she's no longer interested in men, and has instead taken up with teenage beauty Kasey Chase. The only problem is, Kasey's 'mother' Erica is not happy about the affair, and pays an unexpected visit to confront Magdalene. Meanwhile, Wendy is cooking up a scheme of her own, as she plots to win Magdalene away from her young lover. Can love between a middle aged woman and a teenager survive?
