In this DVD Sjoerd "Hourences" De Jong continues his series and goes through the entire production of creating an iOS game using UDK. Sjoerd starts with a blank scene and immediately begins placing custom meshes and then goes into mobile materials, particles, sounds, and fog. Sjoerd then demonstrates setting up the plane, creating a joystick to control the plane, adding speed/fire buttons, creating destroyable ground targets using prefabs, adding a scoring system and time limits, creating the full HUD and compiling the final. Finally Sjoerd goes into great detail demonstrating how his team ported ΓÇ£The BallΓÇ¥ from PC to iOS.
