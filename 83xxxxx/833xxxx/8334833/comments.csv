I see you downloaded ""Freejack.1992.HDTV"".  Everybody is stuck at 73.6% on that one.  If you could start seeding again, I'd really appreciate it."

,nabsltd,2013-04-16T01:49Z,"That's OK.

Hopefully the original uploader will resume seeding like he did on another torrent."
,TheOnlyest,2013-04-16T04:33Z,"Well, I already put it up, so grab it if you want. I did it for you, its the least I could do for what ive gotten from you!"
