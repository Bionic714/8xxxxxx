Notes: 
JEMS master recording. This is an excellent sounding recording. This show captures Tommy Bolin touring in support of his second and final solo album Teaser. Also on the bill this night was The Michael Stanley Band and Paris. This tour lasted only one more month before Tommy Bolin died on December 4th 1976.
