"Skin and Bones"

Megan and Tommy investigate the savage murder 
of a young woman, which leads them to her 
neighbor, who bites Tommy and is diagnosed 
with rabies. When another rabies fatality 
comes in without any bite marks, Kate calls 
in the new health commissioner, Dr. Charles 
Stafford, to help Megan uncover the truth. 
Could it really be zombies, as some of her 
colleagues suspect?
