I have to undress the 'LOL'-lie, beeing born October 1st(lol), and after recieving
a certain amount of enlightment from the Jewish people through the Dead Sea scrolls
written in America (oh sorry, it should have been in Arameic) ;-)

Stripping LOL is easy, if you cruise through Persia and ask for LOL, you ask for the
#1 crop of the 'alibant', regardly Opium. Can't you see it in my drodle?

o + ~ hum. This is the unhealthy grapevine about to be destroyed. Americans, do your Job
in Afghanistan before leaving. Burn it down and give new seeds to the tribes so they
can feed themselves. Their crop destroys too many lives, including my own, and I don't
want to see more youths get addicted to it's raffined products.

What about some new Whites now, God?
