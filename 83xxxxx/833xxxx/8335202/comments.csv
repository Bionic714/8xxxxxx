,komaxlaredo,2013-04-04T14:26Z,Audio and Video = 10 Thanks uploader. I cried when I saw Michael Madsen in this shitty movie. sorry for my bad english I m Mexican.
,uheardmebitch,2013-04-04T16:50Z,video and audio are flawless. movie is complete crap
,MailerDaemon0,2013-04-04T17:33Z,"Looks like scene4all is butthurt about the fuckup they made with releasing the wrong fuckin movie...

This is the OTHER infected movie, NOT the one centered in Los angeles..

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1622991/

It's also pretty shitty that scene4all is trying to cover up their mistake by deleting ANY post that points it out..

Sure it's an EPIC FAIL for a Scene Release Group to fuck up as bad as they did but to compound things by trying to cover up and hide the mistake, that just shows they care more about their rep then they do anything...

""There are 2 movies with the same name (Infected I and Infected 2) This movie is Infected 2."""

firstly, I'm pretty sure s4a have admin powers on this site, he is a VIP, there's a pretty gigantic difference.

secondly I suggest you show respect and gratitude for the people sharing files with you FOR FREE, putting them selves at risks for YOUR sake, man up bitchy

third and last I just want give you a virtual middle finger, so fuck you fuck tard, fuck you and plz don't go internet-thug on any of us to prove you're even more worthless than you already showed us"
,LegoLazze,2013-04-04T19:43Z,"I am pretty sure he DOESN'T have admin powers, my bad, typo and am sorry"
,MailerDaemon0,2013-04-04T20:22Z,"@LegoLazze: And you have the nerve to call me a ""Fucktard""??

What an idiot.. Next time think before you speak boy and then you might not have to apologize as much for what comes out of it...

Had the uploader of this done any quality control (like verifying it was the correct movie) none of us wuld be here having a discussion about it. And to make matters worse, the uploader goes and deletes any posts from earlier that pointed out that the wrong movie was uploaded..

If you dont want people to be critical, dont do stupid shit like upload the wrong movie...

Free is free but 'cmon now, this is wasted bandwidth for anyone expecting this to be the other Infected movie. (The one set in Los Angeles)"
,CRISPIGGY,2013-04-04T20:58Z,"EXIST 2 FILMES WITH THE SAME NAME ...THIS POSTER IS NOT FROM THIS ONE THIS FILME IS INFECTED II AND THE POSTER IS FROM INFECTED I....OF COURSE THE FILME IS A 10,10 , PLEASE IN FUTURE scene4all DON´T FULL US WITH THE POSTER

,isteal2,2013-04-05T00:59Z,"Really?? 15,000 people downloaded this crap? And I was almost one of them too, until I realized that right now it's a season for shitty movies. Beware..
Nothing good will come out until summer.
Go watch game of thrones instead of these B movie ripoffs peddling to retards"

,alien066,2013-04-05T05:31Z,"Don't worry, both movies are crap."
,dfl3506,2013-04-05T13:24Z,Has Madsen made anything good since Kill Bill? He's a one trick pony and this movie shows he's scratching at the bottom of the barrel.

UNSUBSCRIBE"
,jrhploto,2013-04-05T17:56Z,"Want to say thanks for uploading Side Effects. Looking forward for [ Little White Lies ] and
[ The Guilt Trip ]. No one has yet uploaded these movies."
,DrMD,2013-04-05T20:20Z,"You'll see within minutes this a POS movie not only is the appearance of Micheal Madsen a huge clue but the stuntmen subbing for actors will have you deleting this crap from your hard drive in record time so some have the benefit of being warned do not download, it stinks."

morons"
,perro5,2013-04-07T04:22Z,"the only time this movie gets good is at the presentation credits, don't expect more... it wont happen."
,libertaswv,2013-04-07T07:00Z,"Well said, LegoLazze - regardless of the release. Sikkdaemon (or whatever he's calling himself today) is weak shit. It's sadly hilarious when people who don't know what they're talking about adopt a tone of condescension ('he's censoring me! he's censoring me! it's a COVERUP!!' too funny). Just watch, he'll haunt these comments for months lol

,MailerDaemon0,2013-04-07T20:20Z,"Hey libertaswv, you're an even bigger dumbass then you look.... I sincerely HOPE that you dont represent the thought processes of everyone that lives in West Virginia, that would be insulting to everyone else who has to live near you.

You think you know who I am when you have no fucking clue whatsoever....

Its no wonder that you of all people would come to the aid of someone like LegoLazze since like minds think alike but please take your pathetic feud with Sikkwolf somewhere else please and next time get your facts straight before speaking."
,MailerDaemon0,2013-04-07T20:23Z,"It's sadly hilarious when people who don't know what they're talking about adopt a tone of condescension.

Hey libertaswv, I hope you were looking in the mirror for inspiration when you came up with that.  "
