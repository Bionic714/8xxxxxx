The will play however without problem on software players such as VLC.

To say they are NTSC standard is not absolutely true as NTSC standard is 30/1.001 (approximately 29.97) constant frames per second."

I was purely pointing out some problems I had for the benefit of others.

Part of the Internet is the exchange of information which imanwf obviously doesn't like. Perhaps he/she is anonymous out of hiding......"
