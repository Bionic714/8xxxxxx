,firedart,2013-04-04T11:21Z,"doesnt anyone post any comment ,why do they seed blindly"
,djaalog,2013-04-04T11:44Z,"A? V? M?

Anyone ??"
,topk,2013-04-04T15:00Z,CAM AUDIO is this also cam audio?
,derrique,2013-04-04T15:42Z,"from all ye thousands of seeders and leechers, would one of ye take a moment to tell us if the sound on this copy is also crappy like the others please.. ? 
ah.. ! maybe all the thousands of seeders and leechers are fake, that's the only explanation i see.
anyway, i have the pleasure of a relatively fast bandwidth with litel to do, so i'll let ye of litel bandwidth know in about half an hour, if all goes well..  (-;"

It sounds like the audio came from a bathroom stall and it is badly out of sync"

Audio is just bearable. At least speech is clear."
,Latexted,2013-04-04T17:06Z,People posting this kind of CRAP in HD Movies should be summarily executed.
,derrique,2013-04-04T17:07Z,"yep, it's the same crappy audio..
it would be bearable for someone desperate to see this before they shuffle off this mortal coil before a week or two when a better copy comes out.
the video is perfect for me, and though the audio is clearly comprehensible, it was recorded through a long concrete tube..

I try to comment, but thepiratebay does not seem like I comment"
,IncomePitbull,2013-04-05T05:12Z,"Judging by the pics, this has VERY good quality video.

Hey, Guys in the 3rd world countries that have a 1980's camcorder.. Take notes from TommieCook with his 2013 video camera!

It is 2013, you can pick up a nice HD camera for under $300!"
,amadoux,2013-04-05T09:15Z,BAD AUDIO taken with a camera. Do not download unless you wanna loose bandwidth and time.

audio is unbearable at times but hey it's free so no complaints here -_-"
,Ms_Botswana,2013-04-05T17:09Z,Sounds like someone dug out a well-chewed TDK D60 cassette tape and recorded a goose performing a 5 octave fart through a cardboard tube. They then took the recording and muxed it with this video. 
,DeThroneRoyalty,2013-04-05T18:54Z,Thank you very much for the movie
,mtsplus,2013-04-05T20:37Z,"Put CAM in the title!
And don't spam shit like this in this section.

,ag_orange,2013-04-05T21:32Z,Bullshit! It's very watchable... A/V 7/7
,meskiman,2013-04-05T23:47Z,The audio is horrible! Dont dl.
,chachiola,2013-04-06T00:38Z,i'm getting mixed reaction's on this one....might just wait for a dvd/blu ray rip...thanks for the effort.

,redhare,2013-04-06T07:06Z,Thanks but tinny audio greatly detracts from the video. Plus lot of ambient noise really makes this a valiant but sad effort.

,thomasphavong,2013-04-08T17:36Z,Terrible audio. Great video. I would highly suggest on waiting for another release. The audio sounds like it's coming from a boom box.
,SantanaBanana,2013-04-09T02:10Z,"looks like this was uploaded by a jew-- terrible.
just wait for the non-jew upload. "
,SantanaBanana,2013-04-09T02:15Z,also it's avi wait for mkv!!
,kapriciouz,2013-04-09T04:08Z,"Atrocious audio.  Wait for a better rip.  Totally unwatchable if you care ANYTHING about audio.  Video quality is very good, but that means jack shit with such poor audio.  Someone needs to  add ""CAM"" to the title of this torrent."
,ghostkernel,2013-04-10T00:11Z,"Thank you uploader.

Video:9 (high definition) ;)
Audio:6 (sounds like in a restroom but you can definitely hear it comfortably)

Great Torrent!!!!!"

,Mr_Gamer,2013-04-12T06:57Z,"2 Aim_To_Maim : Agreed on all points. Video was reasonable, the audio was SO BAD that I deleted the file five seconds after opening it. 

Didn't even seed it because it was not WORTH seeding. 

PS. my total overall seeding ratio is 8.86TB up and 3.34 down, that is "
,Mr_Gamer,2013-04-12T06:59Z,"Oops, pressed send at the wrong time.

Seeding ratio up vs down is 2.647 with 8.86TB Up vs TB 3.34 Down.

So I am not a vampire by ANY standard :D"
,Rolli666,2013-04-15T15:31Z,Hey cock hole if a movie is not a a/10 v/10 fuck off back to your ass crack and don't post it as such. You know who I'm talking about sperm slurpee.
,pawn3d,2013-04-16T01:45Z,Audio so bad that I'm currently looking for subtitles... Anyone got subs?

Great picture even the dark scenes. Audio was clear not distorted. I heard one or two clearing throats/coughs . Nice upload , the other picky pricks can pay or wait ffs. "

This is not cam video, idiot. the video is ripped from a r5 or screener. sorry but if you think someone recorded this video with a camera your retarded 

video is great very watchable. V8
audio is cam,  adjusted the sound on my tv turned up the treble and turned down the bass. it helped allot.                          A4

The Movie is fucking scary. and it take allot to scare me                              M8"
,caster66,2013-04-24T05:54Z,Not watchable for us.  Video is choppy and audio sounds like... a cam.  Echoey.  We'll wait for BR Rip
