Plot:
Unlike both manga stories, the Blue Drop: Tenshitachi no Gikyoku anime series is set before the war. The storyline starts in 1999, with Mari Wakatake transferring to a girl's dormitory school called Kaih┼ì Academy . Mari's background hides a traumatic past: five years before her arrival at Kaih┼ì, all the inhabitants of the island where she lived died in one night. Mari was the only survivor, but lost all her memories prior that point.
