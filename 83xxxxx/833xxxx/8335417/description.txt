THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA : 1920s EDITION [480p MKV] [2004/2011]
Directed by Joel Schumacher (2004)
Starring Emmy Rossum, Gerald Butler, Patrick Wilson, Miranda Richardson.

A very different looking version of the excellent Amazming Studio FanEdit. This new version still presents Joel Schumacher's 2004 film resynched to the original London cast 1986 recording of the musical (with Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford), but the whole film has been altered to look like an old film print from the 1920s. An homage to both the 1925 film version with Lon Chaney and to the original cast of A. Lloyd Webber's muscial, this "1920s Edition" is presented with two separate audio tracks: One featuring a remastered version of the original London cast recording in pristine quality, and one featuring that same recording in a vintage sounding "old and damaged" quality, fitting the look of this 1920s edition. Many thanks and much credits to Amazming for his original "Phantom Resynched Edit", which this edit is based on.

* The film was reframed from its cinemascope 2.35:1 ratio to an older-looking 1.33:1 full screen ratio.
* The whole film has been altered to look like a damaged film reel from the 1920s.
* Various alterations and cuts have been made to Amazming's fan edit all through the film.
* Vintage start and end credits, added Intermezzo card between Act 1 and Act 2.
