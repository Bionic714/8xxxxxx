The title of Pink Floyd's debut album is taken from a chapter in
Syd Barrett's favorite children's book, The Wind in the Willows
and the lyrical imagery of The Piper at the Gates of Dawn is
indeed full of colorful, childlike, distinctly British whimsy
albeit filtered through the perceptive lens of LSD. Barrett's
catchy, melodic acid pop songs are balanced with longer, more
experimental pieces showcasing the group's instrumental
freak-outs, often using themes of space travel as metaphors for
hallucinogenic experiences -- "Astronomy Domine" is a poppier
number in this vein, but tracks like "Interstellar Overdrive" are
some of the earliest forays into what has been tagged space rock
But even though Barrett's lyrics and melodies are mostly playful
and humorous, the band's music doesn't always bear out those
sentiments -- in addition to Rick Wright's eerie organ work
dissonance, chromaticism, weird noises, and vocal sound effects
are all employed at various instances, giving the impression of
chaos and confusion lurking beneath the bright surface. The Piper
at the Gates of Dawn successfully captures both sides of
psychedelic experimentation -- the pleasures of expanding one's
mind and perception, and an underlying threat of mental disorder
and even lunacy; this duality makes Piper all the more compelling
in light of Barrett's subsequent breakdown, and ranks it as one
of the best psychedelic albums of all time
