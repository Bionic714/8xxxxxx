The bandΓÇÖs two members, David Lamb and MorganEve Swain, continue to build their sound from the foundations of blues and American roots music, utilizing the simple foot-percussion, violin, cello and upright bass that they have become known for, while expanding SwainΓÇÖs vocal presence and flaunting LambΓÇÖs lyrical mastery. Recorded in their home-state of Rhode Island at Machines With Magnets, Fits of Reason is inspired by the writings of Omar Khayyam, Christopher Hitchens, and Plato, among others, and grapples with the human condition in a smooth but unapologetic departure from the bandΓÇÖs previous release, Salt for Salt. With the introduction of electric guitar, electric bass, and a more prominent display of the bandΓÇÖs Middle Eastern, metal, and psych-rock influences, Fits of Reason delves into heavier territory and invites the listener to hear with discerning ears.
