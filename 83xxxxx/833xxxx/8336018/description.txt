Even before the still-unexplained destruction of the U.S. battleship Maine in Havana Harbor on February 15, 1898, many Americans believed that war with Spain over the question of Cuban independence had become inevitable. After the Maine incident, a number of individuals across the nation expected an immediate declaration of war and requested authorization to organize volunteer units. One of the most-persistent and certainly one of the best-organized efforts took place in Arizona. It became the genesis of Theodore Roosevelt's Rough Riders.
