A Guidebook to Contemporary Architecture in Vancouver explores buildings constructed as the city experienced unprecedented growth, beginning with Expo ΓÇÿ86 and continuing through the 2010 Olympic Winter Games. The guidebook features buildings and public spaces grouped by areas, with maps so that a visitor can create walking tours, including ones through downtown Vancouver, Richmond, the North Shore, and Kitsilano. The convenient size and format, including an index, allows visitors to put this guidebook in a pocket and go.
