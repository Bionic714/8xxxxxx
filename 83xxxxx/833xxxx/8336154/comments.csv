,vileri94,2013-04-04T14:35Z,"Getting Steam_api.dll missing, i placed the crack into Borderlands 2/ , any ideas?"
,vileri94,2013-04-04T14:53Z,"Ok solved it, just schizophrenic install paths. You can never trust the default install path it seems."
,reqzz,2013-04-04T18:05Z,"I install borderlands 2 in the folder C://Program Files//2K Games//Borderlands 2.
When I Install The update,the file extract in folder C://Program Files//Borderlands 2.
It's Different folder,so the update will not work.
when i try to install it in the folder C://Program Files//2K Games//Borderlands 2,It says that ""the folder exist.do you want to install it anyway?"".
Should i click yes or trying to copy the extracted file to my borderlands 2 folder?because I'm afraid it will be error or crash or freezing"
,reqzz,2013-04-04T18:15Z,"I install borderlands 2 in C:Program Files2K GamesBorderlands 2.
When I run the update,it install in the folder C:Program FilesBorderlands 2.
It's a different folder.When I try to install the update in C:Program Files2K GamesBorderlands 2.It says that ""The folder already exist,would you like install it anyway?"".
Should I click yes or try to copy the extracted files?because I'm afraid the game will error or crash"
,Suzerix,2013-04-04T18:44Z,"@reqzz
If you are afraid of mistake, install the update to a brand new folder, then copy all files and folder from the update folder to you Borderlands 2 installation directory, choose ""yes"" when Windows ask for folder merge and file overwrite. There will not be even single freeze, me, and probably many other already have tested this update, works fine. Do not forget to copy and overwrite the cracked files too ;)"
,bordyfox3,2013-04-04T20:28Z,"I downloaded and everything worked fine. I overwrited the files and added the crack to the binary win32 folder.  Whenever I try to run the program i get the error 
""Steam must be running in order to launch Borderlands 2. Please restart Borderlands 2 after starting the Steam client.""  Any help would be greatly appreciated. thx"
,bordyfox3,2013-04-04T20:31Z,"I copied all the files and everything but whenever i open the game i get the message ""Steam must be running in order to launch Borderlands 2.  Please restart Borderlands 2 after starting the Steam client.""  Please any help will be greatly appreciated."
,bordyfox3,2013-04-04T20:32Z,I'm new to this but why do my comments keep dissapearing every time i refresh the page after posting
,cjl6400,2013-04-04T20:35Z,"@vileri94
Would you mind explaining how you fixed the problem you were having? I'm stuck on the same thing"
,MLO89,2013-04-05T05:41Z,"Works perfect. If you had previous patches or cracks installed for this game, no need to even copy over the included crack. The old one will still work quite nicely after installing this update. I had all previous patches installed (with crack), so I installed this one without the included crack and the game fired right up."
,ojigbe,2013-04-05T06:16Z,having problem with this update. Steam. app dll missing. Can anyone help?
,reqzz,2013-04-05T06:44Z,"@Suzerix
I didn't use steam"
,MD72x,2013-04-05T13:43Z,anyone get this to work on windows 8
,undefiant,2013-04-06T16:56Z,Don't use the Default install path for this file.. its fucked up! if your having problems with the missing steam.app.dll error then u did not install in the right place. check it!! if you are still having problems and your sure you installed to your game folder make sure u don't have a borderlands 2 file inside your game folder if so copy the contents of  that folder to yer game folder and delete it then find the launcher folder and send to desktop create shortcut
,JFKcaper,2013-04-06T17:36Z,"Worked perfectly fine, but the directory-selection was kinda messed up. The default directory had ""Borderlands 2"" as the final folder, but when I selected the ""Borderlands 2"" folder where I installed the game, it created a new folder inside that folder >.>"
,noekk,2013-04-06T19:43Z,"It says you don't need any previous updates, however the 1.3.1 update is 220mb and this one is 176mb so I don't understand."
,noekk,2013-04-06T19:48Z,...It also doesn't include Borderlands2.exe and B2Launcher.exe. How are you guys getting it to work ?
,undefiant,2013-04-06T22:39Z,"Ok I will explain this 1 more time. If you are getting an error that says Steam/app.dll missing from your computer... Then you did not install this file to the right path. You cannot trust the default path for this torrent  CHECK IT CLOSE!!. Most of you installed the Skidrow copy of borderlands 2 to its default path of..(C:)/programs X86/2K games borderlands 2.
make sure if that is where your game is installed? That is where your update installs
The mistake most of you are making is you are installing to the default path... or your install path looks like this...""(c:)program X86/2K games/borderlands 2/borderlands 2"" ...You fucked up!!...that puts the file inside a borderlands 2 folder inside your game install and it wont work just make sure your installing to the right path!!! I am running Windows 8 Pro and it works like a charm!... hope this helps."
,undefiant,2013-04-06T23:09Z,Ok I will explain this one more time. You cannot trust the default install path for this torrent. make sure you install to where your game is currently installed. Most of you installed borderlands 2-skidrow to its default path of...C:/programs(x86)/2k games/borderlands 2. when you install this make sure your install path does not look like this....C:/programs(x86)/2K Games/borderlands 2/borderlands 2.
,MD72x,2013-04-07T05:03Z,omg @undefiant thank you soooooo much i love you just one more question when i open the game it says some dlc files are corrupt but i don't have any dlcs so is this a problem for installing dlcs in the future?
,d.lee,2013-04-07T06:26Z,Awesome torrent.  Cheers.
,d.lee,2013-04-07T06:27Z,Awesome torrent.  Cheers
,undefiant,2013-04-07T15:39Z,Don't forget to crack it dumb ass.
,undefiant,2013-04-07T15:49Z,They said they fixed the install path but I don't trust them:p
,Mat4Creat,2013-04-15T21:44Z,"Ultimate Vault Hunter mode launches well, but when I press the LAN button - everything freezes and i have to restart the game. LAN does not work. Any ideas, uploader? "
,andrewMAGAS,2013-04-17T16:51Z,"someone pls help when i run the update.exe and try to install it it says that steam_api.dll it missing. it is there i have checked but i always says that 
(also i pasted the crack contents into the install folder after the error showed because i thought it was complete)"
,undefiant,2013-04-18T20:57Z,"andrewMAGAS...you are a moron, read the 3 posts I posted weeks ago. If you cant figure out what you are doing wrong after reading my posts then I'm afraid there is no hope for you I'm sorry."
,SyfqRsln,2013-04-28T07:27Z,my ultimate vault hunter mode DLC folder seems corrupted. can anyone help?
,wrecktem,2013-06-01T03:37Z,"Interestingly, this worked. I installed this, and I was able to finally gain XP within Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode... but I was getting a message in the main menu of the game saying I needed the latest patch to access DLC... I was still able to access every place and every gun, so idk why I got the message, but I decided to reinstall the latest patch and now my game's messed up. Reinstalling right now, but in case anyone's wondering, this works. Sort of."
