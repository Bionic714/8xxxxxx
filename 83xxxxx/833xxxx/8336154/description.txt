 ****************************** 

A new era of shoot and loot is about to begin. Play as one of four new
vault hunters facing off against a massive new world of creatures,
psychos and the evil mastermind, Handsome Jack. Make new friends, arm
them with a bazillion weapons and fight alongside them in 4 player
co-op on a relentless quest for revenge and redemption across the
undiscovered and unpredictable living planet.

Features:

All-New Characters and All-New Classes: Four all new playable classes
including the Siren, the Commando, the Gunzerker and the Assassin.
Step into the role of the Gunzerker, whose highly deadly skills allow
him to dual-wield any two weapons found in the game. Not only that,
you will build on that skill to do more things with two guns than you
ever imagined possible. Dual machine guns? Cool. Dual rocket launchers?
Of course Dual Sniper Rifles? Sure, if thats your thing Want to try
other styles? More tactical perhaps? There are multiple classes to
choose from

Dynamic Co-op online, and LAN: Share your adventures with friends both
online and via LAN. Borderlands 2 features a seamless system enabling
you to drop in and drop out of a campaign without ever having to
restart the game. On top of that you can even take your new gear from
any game to any other

World Connected Story: Find yourself left for dead in the frozen tundra
of Pandora as you begin your quest of revenge and redemption. Expose
the evil surrounding the Hyperion Corporation and take on the
perpetrator of a universe-wide grand deception -- the nefarious
Hyperion CEO, Handsome Jack. (Oh, also: he's stolen credit for the
opening of the Vault.)

87 Bazillion...Everything: In addition to the new gun system, you will
lust after procedurally generated shields, grenades, Relics, class mods
and much, much more. And you thought the original Borderlands had a ton
of loot

Brand new environments on Pandora: Hunt through entirely brand new
areas of Pandora that are more alive than ever From the arctic tundra,
through the dangerous grasslands, past the mysterious corrosive caverns
to beyond, you'll be surprised by the unpredictable world of Pandora at
every turn

Brand new enemies: A whole slew of new enemies are out there to kill
you in Borderlands 2. Hulking, gorilla-like Bullymongs, vicious
predatory Stalkers and the Hyperion mechanical army, run by Handsome
Jack, are just some of the new enemies in Borderlands 2.
