Release Notes

Artist: Pretty Maids Rating: You Decide!
Album: Motherland Label: Frontiers
Description: Here they go again: the Danish cult rockers of
Pretty Maids are well known for their 80's
classic Future World and with their latest
album Pandemonium the band sounded stronger
than ever. This one was highly acclaimed by the
press and fans. Now they present us their new
album Motherland . Let s see if this is a
worthy follow-up to the previous record

A lot has happend over the time: beside some
line-up changes Pretty Maids changed their sound
from traditional Melodic Hard Rock into Melodic
Metal on Pandemonium . This makeover was a step
in the right direction, because the band sounded
more fresh and powerfull than ever and you found
a bunch of hits on this record. Just think of
Little Drops Of Heaven , Old Enough To Know
It Comes At Night and so on. With such an
amazing album in mind, it s always hard to
produce a successor with the same value

Soundwise Motherland continues where
Pandemonium left off. But this is no surprise
because the new record was produced by Jakob
Hansen again. So you can expect a very good
production with proper pressure. Maybe
everything sounds a bit darker this time

The opening track Mother Of All Lies is
representative for the whole album, that s why
it s a good decision to be the first single. The
song has a very modern sound, a pounding rhythm
section and lots of synthie-effects in it
Speaking about this keyboard-parts I ve to say
that I like keys with 80's mood, but here the
synthie-parts sound too modern and they are too
pushy. You will find them on nearly every single
track on Motherland and they are very
dominant. For sure, this is a matter of taste
I don t like them. I would have liked more
riffing, than those keys, but ok they seem to
be an integral part of the band s new sound. To
Fool A Nation has a remarkable guitar part in
it and is a good song not stunning, but still
a good song

In general I must say that this album is a
grower. You need to listen to it a several times
to get into most of the songs. Consistently
catchy tunes are hard to find after the first
listen. This distinguishes Motherland from its
predecessor, but you won t get tired of the
songs too fast

Confession is some kind of intro of the next
song The Iceman . This tune has a really
mysterious mood and great atmosphere. In fact
the whole album has lots of atmosphere. Next
song Sad To See You Suffer is the second
single and a typical radio-friendly ballad. It s
a good song, but sadly not the over-the-top-hit
I hoped for. Hooligan is a great straight
ahead rocker with cool gang-shouts and heavy
riffs. Infinity brings some kind of epicness
with it. I can t help, but when I listen to this
I always imagine a doomsday scenario. It s the
same with Wasted , but Infinity has a better
chorus. Why So Serious is definitely one of
the highlights of this CD. This one is catchy
but also very heavy and the chorus is superb. I
always think of Heath Ledgers Joker from The
Dark Knight when I hear the line Why so
serious? . Maybe it was inspired by this movie?
Who knows?

Pretty Maids rock on with the title track
Motherland . This song seems to be a real power
metal tune with its fast rhythm and pounding
drums. Cool song. I See Ghosts leaves me a bit
disappointing, because it can t keep up with the
two previous songs. With Bullet For You the
moment finally arrived: this is the over-the
top-hit I ve been waiting for!

This one is a gem an amazing half-ballad with
a stunning chorus, a terrific guitar solo and
not so much keys in it. This all is crowned by
the unique voice of Ronnie Atkins. This man is
fantastic. I admire his ability to change his
style of singing from moment to moment. His
vocal range is huge from emotional and clear
to aggressive and rough.But also the other
musicians deliver high quality service here
Very good job

The bottom line Pretty Maids present us a strong
album with their unique music style, some
amazing songs (after a few runs) and the
variable voice of Ronnie Atkins, so this is a
must-buy for fans of this band and fans of
Melodic Metal in general. Nevertheless
Motherland couldn t fascinate me like
Pandemonium three years ago. This is due to
the permanent use of very modern keyboard-sounds
and the fact that the new song material is not
so accessible like it could be. All in all it s
a worthy follow-up to Pandemonium . Buy it!
