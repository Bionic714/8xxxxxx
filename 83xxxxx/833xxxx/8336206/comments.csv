,turbopla,2013-04-04T18:13Z,"A/V sync is a little off. Video is the most impressive I've seen from a camera. Audio also has a small echo sound to it. Other than those, great upload!

,robfield68,2013-04-12T14:16Z,"Quality is good
V=9
A=9 , but....

This film is terrible. It has none of the intrigue of Legion and none of the cool scenes of Paranormal Activity. It's a drawn out boring film that never pays off. The ending is terrible and insults an already tired viewer. A lot of hype surrounded this film, kind of like The Fourth Kind, but it's actually worse than that hunk of crap. Waste of time. Watch it if you want, but don't say that you were not warned.

Thanks for the upload. I do appreciate being able to watch it and the quality of the video has nothing to do with my review. The torrent is fine. I blame the film makers for making this horrible movie."

audio is a little hollow but if you're using VLC open up your eq in effects and filters and try setting it to the ""dance"" or ""full bass"" presets to fill things out.
I can't comment on the actual film because I'm only about half way through.So far it's not too bad at all for a modest budget production.
Thanks uploader great job."
