@ Holyman and everyone who experiences problems with uTorrent. Sad but true, every update just seems to get worse ! When i try to download new torrents with uTorrent 3.3 it says 0.0% checked and then nothing, downloads doesn't start. It's a pain in the arse. SOLUTION: Go to www.oldapps.com and download any older version. 3.2.3 works with me. Or 2.2.1 (maybe the best version ever ?). And it's safe to use even older ones, 1.8.4 is superb too. You don't need to uninstall (on windows) just download any older version and install. And ENJOY uTorrent as good as it used to be.
