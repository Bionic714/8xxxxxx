Now I can quantify the swimming rhythms(depth, location, speed etc etc) of the fish in my aquarium, finally managing to prove my theory that fish in a closed environment form distinct swimming patterns as per species variability. Awesome stuff, I was looking for something exactly like this, no more studying hours of video."
