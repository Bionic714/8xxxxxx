,Whatzup00,2013-04-05T20:48Z,"Works fully. It says to buy the software at the first start with the crack, but it works and it says ""PRO"", and pro features are available."
,rich750,2013-04-07T15:14Z,"Awsome !

You see, you REPLACE the ytd.exe in the system folder with the one in the crack folder.

Thanks man, I owe you several."
,GuccizBud,2013-04-16T18:06Z,"Awesome, upgraded my 3.9.6… thx for this, took less than a minute to DL too :)"

,n6eTBr,2013-04-27T10:04Z,Nevermind it works!
,lezm.jjlp,2013-05-10T01:12Z,Thanks! Works just fine...
,SpaceCadet6969754,2013-05-10T08:16Z,"Does not work, says failed, after copying crack, do not waste 15 minutes of your life!
It has to connect to internet to download the video, which then it checks the license.
Why would people post it works? lol"
,SpaceCadet6969754,2013-05-10T08:33Z,"it does work it can download ""1"" video, but it keeps saying failed you have to keep pressing stop and restart many times for it to download.
It should do it one click, and it should download many videos at once there is no hope of doing that with this because you have to keep press stop/start because it says failed."
,SpaceCadet6969754,2013-05-10T08:42Z,"This is not cracked, it is still running on the free version time limiting how many videos you can download in what time."
,honkay,2013-05-11T22:55Z,THank you!!!!!!!!!!!!
,honkay,2013-05-12T10:42Z,"The install directory was in C, Program Files x86,
