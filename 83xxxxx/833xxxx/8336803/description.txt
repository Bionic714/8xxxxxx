Not a Full Series Missing a Couple

It all started with five friends who decided to help each other get a fantasy romance hook-up and resulted in 6 sexy stories (mostly short ebooks) in the Fixed series published by Ellora's Cave set in a world of vampires, shapeshifters and fae. The series was picked up by St Martin's and became 'the Others' which was set after the Fixed series and drove all of us new fans 'mad', because it was clear that the reoccurring side characters had their own stories. And pretty quickly the Fixed ebooks became unavailable, so said fans were left to suffer with no hope of curing their insanity, until St Martin's finally managed to get the rights to the earlier books. Warren is slowly rewritting and expanding these earlier books and finally giving a fans a chance to find out what they'd missed. These rewrites are slow in coming though, since Warren is alternating the releases of reworked books with releases of new ones, so that her old fans will still have something new from time to time.

Since this mix of old and new means that some of the newer releases fall earlier in the combined Fixed/Others timeline, here is the series in 'series time' order with both the old and new title names.
