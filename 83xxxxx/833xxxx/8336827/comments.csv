,Fu_kman,2013-04-04T15:11Z,steam initialization failed
,usamus013,2013-04-04T16:48Z,"same here : steam initialization failed.
I copied the crack. thanks for your help."
,beef682,2013-04-05T02:52Z,"same: steam initialization failed, had to allow in AV and exit it too. still error. had to close steam. it was messing with the file. installed fresh game and copied fresh crack, works again

kinda bad game, great visuals, great expanding buildings and road construction, great performance, however i found very limited campaign and cheap cheap cheap people, wont use my transit for crap. ie I go bankrupt."
,boemmie,2013-04-05T08:59Z,"Still not working, with or without AV nor Firewall settings. How to eliminate this problem anybody?"
,boemmie,2013-04-05T09:00Z,"""Steam initialization error"" that is."
,DaedStarr,2013-04-05T22:34Z,"Hmmm. For all those people getting steam initialization errors. Don't have fucking steam running when your trying to install/crack/play a cracked steam game. Also, people, you really need to get better antiviruses. Almost every single crack will show up as a virus because that's how code works. Some will immediately delete the crack, some won't let you copy it over, and some just yell at you. Expect this and don't bitch about it or get something better than Avast, AVG, or Norton. Those are rubbish anyways. Use ESET, self updating, completely customizable, and has never let any actual virus through my computers in 6 years and it doesn't give out false positives for torrents. Let's use some common sense here. All computer related problems are the fault of the user 99.9% of the time. So when something doesn't work, stop and think for a second what you did that caused this issue."
,PewnyPL,2013-04-05T23:45Z,"@DaedStarr - oh yeah wise guy? I'm trying to run this game on a PC that doesn't have steam nor antivirus installed, at all, even Windows Defender or whatever it was called is disabled. Then tell me why I still get this error when there isn't any single thing that can modify cracked files."
,Candyman75,2013-04-06T01:25Z,"@PewnyPL

The game doesnt work for you, because you are a fuckin' retard."
,MjShitF,2013-04-07T00:26Z,Could someone upload the Mac version please.
,FoxFire2012,2013-04-07T03:54Z,"I've Downloaded in BitComet, download took 5 minutes.

I've run Daemon Tools Lite and mounted the ISO.

I've quit Steam prior to installation. Running installation afterwards.

I've successfully installed the game.

I've opened the ISO through my Daemon virtual drive and browsed the contents of the Crack folder.

I've copy and pasted the Crack contents to the folder in which the game was installed. Default is C:Program Files (x86)Cities in Motion 2

I've clicked on the desktop icon to launch the game.

It works.
-----------------------------------------------------

The simplest things are always the best way to resolve issues.

I've no anti-virus, no Windows Defender or Firewall on. And of course, I have steam but I quit before installation, though I doubt it'd do much. Do however, close the Steam application if you want to run the game, chances are it might not let you.

Follow these instructions and stop complaining, you lazy dickwads.

,roby_a1,2013-04-07T13:38Z,Is there some way i can play this with a friend?
,mmarko81,2013-04-07T15:24Z,Hi...i have problem with game blocking... After 10-15 min of playing game blocks...i think it is autosave.... any1 have same problem?
,Geralt28,2013-04-10T07:48Z,I installed it into 2 systems. Windows xp 32 bit (did not work - steam error) and Windows 7 64bit (it works). The crack is not working properly on windows xp I guess...
,sopanic,2013-04-10T11:09Z,DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS CRAP DIDN'T WORK ANY WAY !!
,mole_dd,2013-04-14T16:55Z,"Game works fine! 
Disable antivirus in processes if it won't let you copy the steam.dll
But after some 10 minutes of playing I get a message ""Fatal error in gc: Too many heap sections""; Any idea?"
,JDFS22,2013-04-14T22:12Z,750 MB? I bet it's another stifmeister bullshit torrent... I'll wait.
,Kaizer24,2013-04-15T08:21Z,crack not working!please upload another crack.
,mole_dd,2013-04-16T15:28Z,"Again: Game works fine!

Disable antivirus and/or kill it in processes if you can't copy the steam_api.dll""

If you have an issue with crashing the game (Too many heap sections) then you can add an attribute to the shortcut:
(right click on shortcut - properties - in Target window at the end add:  -force-opengl

Graphics is a little lousy (boring black trees and funny empty sea bottom) but the game worked perfectly without a crach until the early morning;)
A must-have game for everybody living close to a railway without any station near :-P"
,Kaizer24,2013-04-17T09:43Z,already done that.still not working.
,TheUltimateKing1,2013-04-18T01:49Z,"Kaizer24, Did you close Steam before you copied the crack? ;-) 

General Question: Is it possible to get the 1.1.6 patch somewhere? :-S"
,Kaizer24,2013-04-18T05:16Z,"TheUltimateKing1, i dont have steam."
,mole_dd,2013-04-19T16:28Z,"Kaiser24, open task manager and then show processes from all users... If you find ""GFI anti malware service"" - KILL that motherfucker! :) (and also quit other antiviruses)"
,Ayumu89,2013-05-24T13:33Z,"OK.. so I downloaded it without any problem. I installed it and copied the content of crack folder, antivirus didn't delete any file, didn't say nothing. I don't have steam. And I still get this steam error. Any ideas, why?
I have XP, maybe that is the reason?"
