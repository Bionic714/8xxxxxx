Description:

Flywheel  
Inspiring family movie. Winner of the Gold Crown Award "Best Screenplay" 2001. About a dishonest used car salesman who turns himself around.

The story is about a used car dealer who fits the cliches about that line of work just perfectly. Then one day his conscience starts to nudge him toward a more honest life. He turns his business over to God, and says that since it belongs to Him, He's now responsible for how his new honest approach turns out.

If financially possible, please buy this CD/DVD to keep Christian films in business. If Christians won't buy Christian films then who will?

Please seed. Let each one of us who call ourself Christians seed 2-3 movies each. So that these movies may become a blessing to all those who are hungry for God's word & grace. May Jesus bless all those who are seeding the christian torrents.

JESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.

Born of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.


Ephesians 5:11
11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove (expose) them.
