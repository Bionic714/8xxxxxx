Inside the nefarious mind of Lex Luthor, who bares his scars -- but how did he get them?

Luthor's plan to eradicate Superman may make Kal an alien pariah!

The Oracle awaits at the edge of the Solar System to pass judgment on Superman -- and he is not alone.

You won't believe who comes calling on the final page!
