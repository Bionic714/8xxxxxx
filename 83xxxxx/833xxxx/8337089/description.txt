Synopsis
The best-selling guide to the design of control systems for the fluid process industriesΓÇönow updated and expanded Emphasizing performance-based design and tuning,the new edition of the best-selling guide to process control provides engineers with reliable coverage of control technology principles for industrial fluid processesΓÇöfrom basic theory to advanced control applications. Written by the foremost authority on process control,the book serves as a complete reference to controller selection and tuning,controller performance evaluation,and as a design guide for configuring optimum systems. Using time-domain and relative-gain analysis throughout,Greg Shinskey shows you how to solve common control problems and apply proven system solutionsΓÇöwith a minimum of effort and mathematical skill. You'll also learn how to use your personal computer to speed computations,handle more complex situations,and create more accurate process simulations that save you time and make your job easier. Thoroughly revised and updated,the Fourth Edition includes new information on inventory control,internal model and model predictive control,minimizing deviation and integrated error following load changes,closed-loop responses for distributred-lag processes,tuning rules for the Smith predictor and PID controller with deadtime compensation,the dynamics of the static mixer with and without recirculation,process design guidelines for pH control,set-point filtering,sampling effects,and more. Shinskey's clear explanationsΓÇöillustrated by more than 250 simulations,line drawings,graphs,and response curvesΓÇöand worked problems at the end of each chapter make the book an idealself-studyguide and a must-have reference for all engineers who want to keep on top of the state of the art in process control today.
