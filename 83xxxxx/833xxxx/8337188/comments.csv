,Knightarchx,2013-04-11T06:27Z,I was wondering to change the options? ive read their supposed to be a launcher? 
,Knightarchx,2013-04-11T06:28Z,"Nvm, just checked your website. Thanks"
,inksec2,2013-05-17T12:13Z,"The game works great, like all NOSTEAM's stuff.  The only problem is I cant change the graphic options because N0.1 The installer used by nosteam does not allow to choose graphic options like it does with the normal installer. No2 with witcher 2 you can only change graphic options with the launcher and the launcher does not come with this installer.  If someone has a work around i will be thankful if you will share on how to do it."
