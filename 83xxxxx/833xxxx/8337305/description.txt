Micronesians from Bikini, a small atoll of the South Sea state Marshall islands, and it tiny direct neighbor, live in continental US exile. The reason is their evacuation for Operation Crossroads, a massively documented 1946 US military nuclear experiment on their utterly destroyed and uninhabitable island, months after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In 2009, scientists thoroughly investigate the ecologically grim long-term effects on atoll, ocean and a deliberately but badly sunk fleet. The unprotected military participants are dying ever since. The atolls still arenΓÇÖt being cleaned up and likely to be flooded by global warming anyway.
