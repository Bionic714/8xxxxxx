America's extreme Right falsely claims the Founding Fathers as allies for their radical agenda. Pundit Glenn Beck has gone so far as to use the title of Tom PaineΓÇÖs famous 1776 pamphlet Common Sense for his own bookΓÇöa book that attacks the political, social and economic rights which Paine and the Founders fought for.
ItΓÇÖs time to cut through the rhetoric, smoke, and spin, and get back to our core American values. We have gone off course as a country by emphasizing consumerism over citizenship, entertainment over education, and "me" over "we." By rediscovering the moral compass our Founders put into place, we can create a united America, and a future worthy of our grandchildren.
