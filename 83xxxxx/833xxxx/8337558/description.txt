Clear, rigorous definitions of mathematical terms are crucial to good scientific and technical writing-and to understanding the writings of others. Scientists, engineers, mathematicians, economists, technical writers, computer programmers, along with teachers, professors, and students, all have the need for comprehensible, working definitions of mathematical expressions. To meet that need, CRC Press proudly introduces its Dictionary of Algebra, Arithmetic, and Trigonometry- the second published volume in the CRC Comprehensive Dictionary of Mathematics. More than three years in development, top academics and professionals from prestigious institutions around the world bring you more than 2,800 detailed definitions, written in a clear, readable style, complete with alternative meanings, and related references. From Abelian cohomology to zero ring and from the very basic to the highly advanced, this unique lexicon includes terms associated with arithmetic, algebra, and trigonometry, with natural overlap into geometry, topology, and other related areas. Accessible yet rigorous, concise but comprehensive, the Dictionary of Algebra, Arithmetic, and Trigonometry is your key to accuracy in writing or understanding scientific, engineering, and mathematical literature.
