Oh, and thank you very much, your comment/response made me snort coffee out of my nose. Hilarious, but ouch."

,degu2012,2013-04-05T19:40Z,"this feels unnecessary after the ""extremis"" origin revamp."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-06T02:33Z,"degu2012, interestingly, they brought out a new printing of the Extremis trade paperback, on the same day as this original graphic novel!

i personally don't think the season one books are worthwhile to the typical comic buyer. if they were intended to target the casual browsers at book stores, i'm not sure how successful they have been for that, either. oh well."
