Process Control: Modeling, Design, and Simulation is the first complete introduction to process control that fully integrates software tools-helping you master critical techniques hands-on, using MATLAB-based computer simulations. Author B. Wayne Bequette includes process control diagrams, dynamic modeling, feedback control, frequency response analysis techniques, control loop tuning, and start-to-finish chemical process control case studies.
