,sexgrenade,2013-04-17T00:27Z,"@j4jes You clicked on an ad by mistake.The only real download button is the 'Get This Torrent' link with the icon of the magnet beside it. (The beige download button and the 'Anonymous Download' link with the lock icon are both fake — they're ads.) You need a torrent client (like uTorrent) to download torrents. The 'Get This Torrent' link is a magnet link that opens up in a torrent client. You can also just copy and paste the magnet link into your client. It is:

magnet:?xt=urn:btih:9d6c4e126c9405b459fde46b9c27b80817c479b5&dn=McGill+Leaks+Documents&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.publicbt.com%3A80&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.istole.it%3A6969&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.ccc.de%3A80

If you're using Firefox or Chrome, I recommend getting the Adblock Plus extension to filter out the ungodly number of ads on the Pirate Bay.

By the way, when I last checked, the McGill Leaks (or is it McGillLeaks?) website was still up: https://6skgykqdz2wt7grn.tor2web.org/
