Murder Messiah links the DDP series to the new Image Comics series.  Cassie's biggest 'fan'-a serial killer-is on a spree, cleaning up her loose ends. That means no foe or friend is safe. Meanwhile, 14 years in the future, in an America ruled by the Black Lamp Society, street-witch Liberty Lochs is on a desperate quest to find Six Sixx's guitar...

Hack/Slash returns in all-new ongoing series by the creative team behind the hit Hack/Slash: My First Maniac mini! Cassie Hack, killer of killers, and her partner Vlad hunt a slasher who haunts a small town's Make Out Point. Meanwhile, Cat Curio, Former Teen Detective, searches for the man who put her in a coma and the murderous cult that employed him. What she finds will set up the biggest Hack/Slash story yet. A great jumping on point for new readers!
