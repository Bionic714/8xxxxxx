Between 1988 and 2010, composer Hanz Zimmer has had a hand in
nearly every major action film, whether it's him behind the keys
or one of his numerous, Remote Control Productions (formerly
known as Media Ventures) proteges like John Powell, Harry
Gregson-Williams, or Klaus Badelt. His excellent work on director
Christopher Nolan's 2008 international blockbuster The Dark
Knight, was disqualified for Oscar consideration due to too many
cooks (composers) in the kitchen, a handicap that doesn't apply
to Nolan's 2010 follow-up, Inception. Zimmer's signature move, a
four- to eight-chord round that builds from a subtle breeze to an
F5 tornado, serves as the foundation for Inception's dizzying
score, and the addition of Smiths/Cribs guitarist Johnny Marr
who appears on eight of the twelve cuts, dutifully expands the
layers of Zimmer's melodies, much like the dream building that
occurs onscreen. There are moments that bring to mind Vangelis'
moody, jazz-kissed work on Ridley Scott's Blade Runner, but
Inception's backbone is pure Zimmer. It's beautiful and heroic
unhinged and unspeakably melancholy, and the finest and most
fully realized soundtrack this prolific composer has crafted to
