Obviously you got issues Quentin. Calling my mother ""fat-ass greasy bitch"". (not that i care that much...) (it's not even fat, she's actually slim), but when the ""slim one"" calls others fat, and the real reality is reverse... :)

And who was talking to you in the first place. You posted a comment like others here regarding the torrent. But instead of being helpful you've just talked trash and that was it. Do you at least tried downloading the torrent and use the distro. My bet is no. So, how can you have an opinion about something you didn't try?

I never said you owe me something! Where is that coming from?
You offered to post a screenshot, probably trying to demonstrate something, but i guess you've talked before you actually went to the forum and saw that nothing is wrong with it.

Posting dumb comments maybe is your life but not mine, so this is my last one. You can post how many comments you want from now one demonstrating nothing, like the creator of the distro said. (In fact he said not to post if you are not on the ""subject"", but, hey, it's a free world, so they say, and if the moderators here don't stop you, then you have green light to rant about everything is upsetting you... Happy ""texting""!"
,ClubQBall,2013-04-04T13:48Z,"And who would that be?  It's not me.  My name is *not* ""Quentin"".  So, shithead, you struck out.

Since you insisted on posting what you feel is personal information, let me just give you the real deal:

I'm actually Mexican, you half-wit fuck, not fucking white, you ass.  Good try, though.  Apparently the dude's image you posted - illegally, I might add since it's apparent you didn't obtain permission, is an overweight white dude.  Not me, sunshine.  =)  The only thing I have in common with that dude is that we both shoot pool.

Yeah, I think I'll hit our Forum, report you for harassment, and yank that fucking fairy pink skull&crossbones away from your goofy ass.

Have a wonderful day, cheesecake."

,HazardX,2013-04-04T21:11Z,"This is hackintosh distro. It's build to run mac os x on PC computers only. Don't try it on real Mac's coz it will not run at all.
Sorry."
,FastForwarder,2013-04-04T23:37Z,"User_01 good job proving you're a fucktard. You're too stupid to deserve a skull. Maybe a sledge hammer across the skull instead. 

If this is for pc computers HazardX then why the fuck is it in the Mac section again retard. And genius 10.8.3 is the current OS X quit wasting people's time and bandwidth on your outdated shite.

They really need to start doing a IQ test to filter dumb fucks like this uploader. "
,ClubQBall,2013-04-04T23:59Z,@FastForwarder - GET SOME!!!!  LMFAO.  =)

Keep on, motherfucker.  You wanna fucking dance?  BITCH, I WILL FUCK YOUR GODDAMNED LIFE UP SO GODDAMNED MUCH."
[T],User_01,2013-04-05T07:14Z,"HAHAHAHAHA!!!!

Exactly what i wanted ""slick""! So it's you ""Jose"" after all! Or is it like i've said Quentin?! An a hypocrite and a liar just to save his skin.

I don't give a rats ass what you've got there! I'm not even ""CEZAR"", the guy you've mentioned. You can forward any info there to who ever you like. This is not USA! (That pathetic country you call free.)

You can try this guy

http://bayimg.com/JaLJdaAEf

Or this mail

http://bayimg.com/JaljBaAEf

I'll even trow a recent picture of you when you where in your prime at 39, since your birthday past last month, and you turned 43, and probably will start watching those childhood movies you've liked, let's say Star Wars... :)

,ClubQBall,2013-04-06T19:18Z,"Let's dance, 01.  

Frankly, I could give two shits' worth of stink how many images you post up.  Karma's a bitch.  I have your I.P. address and your MAC address.  I also have your address, your phone number, and your Internet Service Provider's name.

Oh, and I even have your birthdate, the name of your parents, what school(s) you attended there in, and I also see, too, that you were just recently convicted of operating a vehicle while inebriated AND that you have ELEVEN such other violations just within the last year.  

Tsk, tsk, tsk ... what a fucking dumb-ass.  Fgures, though ... ignorant little fuck like you.  LMAO.  Twenty-two years old and still a virgin??? WOW.  And ... well, lookie here ... I just happened to have found an image of YOU, too:

http://bayimg.com/jaLOiAAeg

Nosebleeds are a bitch, huh? PUSSY.

Son ... you ain't shit.  Never will be shit.  So go on and do your damnedest.  BRING IT.

But just remember ... I have twenty-plus years on you, kiddo.  I may be fat ... but I'm a lot goddamned smarter ... and much more experienced with computers and the Internet. Since you were digging around so much, you had to have seen my employment background, right? =)  Take note of that, junior.  

There's ALWAYS going to be someone bigger, badder, and more intelligent than you.  ;-)"
[T],User_01,2013-04-07T02:10Z,"WOW you got me! HAHAHAHAHAHA!

Man you're ""killing"" me! :) If you think that's me, then go ahead and do whatever you please, i even dare you to... (and keep in mind that i'm not lying like you did!) Keep trying, maybe you'll find the real me! Try using your skills harder, ""son""!

And no thanks, maybe you should try ""dancing"" with this guy here (sounds exactly like you; a ""mexican"" ""brother"" of mine :) ) (not really... just kidding...)

,ClubQBall,2013-04-07T19:57Z,"You're really not too bright are you, Cezar?  You DO realize that:

(a)  ""CHARLES"" is the English variant of Cezar / Caesar;
(b)  That MasterCard you're using can be EASILY traced, buddy.  

You really ain't too fucking bright, are you?  =)  (shakes head)  I work for one of the largest worldwide / international credit card processors.  What you're doing is actually a very serious crime, son.  It can lead you in prison plus a lot of hefty fines I don't think you OR your parents can really afford.  

Fun and games is one thing.  Sending out SPAM.  Trying to hack accounts.  All good.  But dude, seriously ... as much of a dick as you're proven yourself to be, I really wouldn't want to have to report your activities, man .. too much damned paperwork for me to fill out.

C'mon ... think long and hard before you do this again with that credit card number and sending the information to my e-mail address(es).  Play your fun and games, but don't jeopardize your freedom, dude.  Romania is incredibly tough on credit card fraud ... especially when they have an electronic like I'm providing to your I.S.P.

Use common sense, kid.  Alright?"
,ClubQBall,2013-04-07T20:01Z,"Seriously, man ... use some sense.  It logged your I.P. address, dude:

[T],User_01,2013-04-07T21:45Z,"Keep trying ""frustrated son""! I don't like to repeat myself, but in your case is clearly you don't get it:
Do whatever you please, wish, think is best for you, the well being of the Planet Earth etc. Report what you want to who ever you want! (If you really think that that ""Charles"", ""Caesar"", ""Cezar"" etc it's me.)

This is not USA! (Again)

You obviously don't enjoy this and just keep continuing writing comments here, because God knows why... You said ""Karma is a bitch"", but do you really grasp this concept? For a while now, you kept going with your ""ridiculous"" comments on a bunch of torrents here and other places, just to prove nothing, helping no one, just insults and that's it, braging that you are some smart, clever person but you've demonstrated nothing close to that.

Remember the comment you addressed to ""nobody2007"", saying that ""you don't like when others done it to you..."", well, how is it? 

You say you want to report others, and yet you're here. What a hypocrite!

Look here a bird's-eye view from Jesus C.:
