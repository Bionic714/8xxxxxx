The Melvins in 1999 not only released a masterpiece. They also stumbled across the most effective form of copy protection ever, simply by splitting every track on the cd down the middle. It renders any conventional mp3 unlistenable.

This is a rip of the album as a whole, which has been cut into the eight actual songs, each one at the exact moment god intended for it to start (as opposed to the sloppy tracking work on the cd).

Encoded into 16 bit/44 khz flac for your portable listening pleasure. Works on my droid.


Cutting and rendering of individual files done in Reaper.
Encoding done in Lamedrop.
