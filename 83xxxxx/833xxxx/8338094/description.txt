Flexible robotic manipulators pose various challenges in research as compared to rigid robotic manipulators, ranging from system design, structural optimization and construction to modelling, sensing and control. Although significant progress has been made in many aspects over the past couple of decades, many issues are not resolved yet, and simple, effective and reliable controls of flexible manipulators still remain an open quest. Clearly, further efforts and results in this area will contribute significantly to robotics (particularly automation) as well as its application and education in general control engineering. To accelerate this process, the leading experts in this important area seek to present the state of the art in advanced studies of the design, modelling, control and applications of flexible manipulators.
