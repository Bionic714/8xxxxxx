This is from the original scanner. I adjusted the resolution and compressed the file for easier reading on tablets and ereaders. I have added 'Tablet Edition' to the name to avoid confusion.

Enjoy and please seed back.

THE PULP HEROINE RETURNS!

When Miss Fury foils a wartime plot by Nazi secret agents, she is catapulted through time. . . or so it seems. Is she really careening from past to future and back, or has she lost her mind? And if her sanity remains intact, can one lone heroine possibly hope to end World War II by herself, a conflict still waged into the year 2013? As witness to generations of bloodshed and violence, Miss Fury has lots of righteous rage. . . and anger is her fearsome power!
