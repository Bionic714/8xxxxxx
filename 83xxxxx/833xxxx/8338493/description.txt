FAIREST #14

Dating is hard for everyone in this standalone tale -- but it's especially tricky if you're a gorgeous tree nymph from Fabletown. Princess Alder tells her tales of woe to Reynard the fox in a special issue written by FABLES writer/creator Bill Willingham and featuring the art of superstar Barry Kitson (The Amazing Spider-Man).
