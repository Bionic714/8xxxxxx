Norton 360 kept quarantining and removing the crack files because it said they contained Trojan.Gen.2 and posed a HIGH risk to my computer for infection. Essentially I just ended up having to restore the files and give them a temporary exception.
After un-quarantining and restoring it, I copied it to the program files for PhotoInstrument. Then I went back and scanned it all with Norton again and no risks were detected.
I now have full access to the software, and it's a REALLY great program!"
