PLOT
A cinematic adaptation of Jules Verne's
1874 novel "The Mysterious Island", the story begins during
the American Civil War, as famine and death ravage the city of
Richmond, Virginia. Five northern POWs make the decision to
escape the war by hijacking a hot air balloon! Drifting through the night, 
they wake to find themselves marooned on a desert island,
but they aren't alone... Littered with wreckage, the island is home to
a cast of survivors who have been lost in space and time, including
Jules and Abby Fogg, two young women from modern times who
become stranded while flying over the Bermuda Triangle. Faced with
defending themselves against vicious pirates, terrifying creatures, and
an active volcano that's ready to blow, they must find a way to survive
and escape the island. Hope only comes when they encounter the island's
oldest resident, Captain Nemo himself. With his help, they set to work
crafting an escape... but will they make it in time before the island
claims them forever?
