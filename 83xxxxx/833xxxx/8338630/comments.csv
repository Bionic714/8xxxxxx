@Brownsugar13:

Okay thanks for sharing. I will download it later. I have limited bandwidth GB per month.

All my thanks comments are deleted everywhere in TPB. so thats why from past 3 days I am not downloading nothing and not saying thanks in TPB. Reason because anyways my all post comments are deleted every torrent in TPB.

Question: Your source is from your own physical blu-ray disk or u download the requested movies from somebody's torrent 30GB. 

Okay buddy Advanced Thanks.

Mr. Brown do u have an e-mail id, so i will contact u there."
