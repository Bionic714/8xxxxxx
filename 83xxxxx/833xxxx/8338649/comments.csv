That is why you have screenshots, dumbass. And it's TS.That usually tells something..."
,tornadosturnmeon,2013-04-06T01:30Z,This is in Spanisn
,krimzontide,2013-04-07T09:28Z,"screenshots dont mean shit! anyone can put a random screenshot in there folder its the actual movie itself that needs to be seen. and you can get some pretty good TS copies, some better than others, so the question was a valid question to be asked.

,JZRA,2013-04-09T03:19Z,The first 1 minute 25 seconds are in Spanish then it switches to English. Haven't watched all of it so I hope it stays in English!
,BarnicleBob,2013-04-10T22:27Z,Would have been nice to have been set up with useful information.. nothing listed except size and a couple of get from anywhere screenshots.  Somebody doesn't like taking a second to check stuff and give info to help.
,CtSwift,2013-05-05T10:23Z,"The first two minutes are in another language but it doesn't really matter. 
It's a pretty average quality but you can watch it fine.
Thanks   "
