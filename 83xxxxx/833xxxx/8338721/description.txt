Renewable Energy Do-er in a sea of 
US Auth-Whores - McKibben, Romm, Gore..., 

who are relentlessly, gleefully, ecocidally slaughtering the one thing humanity doesn't have left - TIME with their historically laughable antics.  Tic, tic, tic....  Tired of these US hypocrites (actors, from the Greek - 'acting' like activists vs BEING activists, by any historical measure), auth-whores, cowards? Read, study, emulate Scheer.  Hurry.

Hermann Scheer (April 29, 1944 to October 14, 2010) was a Social Democrat member of the German Bundestag (Parliament), President of Eurosolar (The European Association for Renewable Energy) and General Chairman of the World Council for Renewable Energy.[1] In 1999, Scheer was awarded the Right Livelihood Award for his "indefatigable work for the promotion of solar energy worldwide".[2]

Scheer believed that the continuation of current patterns of energy supply and use will be environmentally damaging, with renewable energy being the only realistic alternative. Scheer had concluded that it is technically and environmentally feasible to harness enough solar radiation to achieve a total replacement of the foclear (fossil/nuclear) energy system by a global renewable energy economy. The main obstacle to such a change is seen to be political, not technical or economic.[2] In 1999 he was one of the initiators of the German feed-in tariffs that were the major source of the rise of renewable energies in Germany during the following years.
