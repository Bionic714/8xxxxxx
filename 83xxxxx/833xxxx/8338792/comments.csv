StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm *Proper* (c) Blizzard
04/2013: RELEASE.DATE .. PROTECTION: Battle.net
1: DISC(S) .. GAME.TYPE: RTS

Proper notes:

You only need to read FLTs nfo to know that something is wrong. Their
release requires you to be online in order to download patch files from
Blizzard. This makes their release invalid now, and useless later, when
Blizzard disables their crack with patch files. Our release comes with all
data required to play

Furthermore, the FLT release doesn't support custom (Arcade/Skirmish) maps
Our release does, it supports all maps available offline

Finally, their crack does not work with certain CPUs, for instance on
the latest AMD 8 core processors. Our crack does

Additional notes:

Our crack will attempt to automatically firewall the game using Windows
Firewall. If your Windows Firewall is disabled, then you need to be offline
or you need to use your third party firewall to block the following exe
manually: ""VersionsBase24944SC2.exe""

It's possible to add more custom maps (Arcade/Skirmish) if you wish. Ask one
of your friends who has the original game to Create Games using these maps
(while logged in to Battle.Net; just enter the lobby, then leave it)
After all maps are downloaded and pre-cached, get his Offline Cache folder
which is located in ""C:Documents and SettingsAll UsersApplication Data
Blizzard EntertainmentBattle.net"" and copy it into the ""Battle.net""
sub-folder of where you installed the game

Game infos:

Welcome to The Hive Mind

You are Sarah Kerrigan, former Queen of Blades. Once the most feared entity
in the galaxy, you now wait in a cell in the depths of a high-security
research laboratory. Before the murderous forces of the Terran Dominion
close in, you must plot your escape to the dark reaches of space... and
reclaim your living empire at the Heart of the Swarm

Command New Weapons of War
Deploy devastating new units across an ever-shifting battlefield. Incinerate
advancing foes with the Hellbat, seize air superiority with the Tempest
engulf entrenched enemies with the Swarm Host, and much more

Unleash Hell
Lead Sarah Kerrigan as she embarks on a path of furious vengeance. Evolve
your brood for maximum devastation, unlock latent psionic powers, and swarm
from planet to planet aboard your moon-sized zerg Leviathan

1. Burn or mount the image
2. Install the game
3. Copy over the cracked content from the /Crack directory on the image to
your game install directory, overwriting existing files
Firewall the game manually if you have disabled Windows Firewall, as
described in the notes above
4. Play the game by using the default login (rldsince@9y.com)
5. Support the software developers. If you like this game, BUY IT!

,fupa16,2013-04-05T23:10Z,"So after many moons trying to get a working copy of this game, RELOADED has come through.

I knew doing a proper crack would be necessary, the FTL version is ridiculous and unnecessarily complicated. This crack is beautiful and works just like any other game crack, minus the firewall blocking and whatnot.

The instructions provided are sufficient but I'll outline what I did:

1: No unrar necessary, ISO file and .NFO are all you download.

2: Mount and install, it doesn't use the normal blizzard downloader or anything, its a custom RELOADED installer.

3: Explore the ISO file you mounted to whatever virtual drive and copy the StarCraft II.exe and Battle.net folder to your Starcraft II directory in Program Files (x86).

4: Before launching, double check and make sure anything named Starcraft II or Starcraft II PTR are blocked in your windows firewall. Check the control panel for windows firewall, and near the top left click the ""Allow program or feature through windows firewall"" button. Make sure anything named Starcraft II is UNCHECKED. You can also check under advanced options and inbound rules as well to be sure.

5: Load from the cracked .exe you used to overwrite the default .exe in your SC2 directory. This will launch a custom RELOADED splash menu and begin initializing the ""backdoor"" method into the game, circumventing BNET. You'll also be able to choose your profile name at this time, pick whatever you want. The necessary login name will already be placed in the username field, so just hit connect. It will never connect however, so just hit ""offline mode"" and you'll be in the game. Always launch from the cracked .exe and you're fine.

Excellent job RELOADED. These guys are the real deal and they know what they're doing."
,Zeratul281,2013-04-05T23:51Z,"Followed these directions to the tee, still getting the starter edition bug..."
,electro cute,2013-04-06T02:19Z,"FOR EVERYONE THAT HAS ""NOT 100% DOWNLOADED PROBLEM""

here's how i've fixed it.

1. i followed every step in the installer and got this message.
2. i've went in the firewall and deleted every protocol associated to starcraft 2
3. i've blocked a sc2.exe located in your install directory - versions - base 24944. i've blcoked it through advanced settings - ingoing rules and advanced settings - outgoing rules.
4. i deleted starcraft 2 folder located in documents directory - not the directory with install but directory that has saves in it.
5. IT WORKED!!!!

(i've also installed the game in c:starcraft 2. don't know if it helped or not).

be sure to have registry cleaned before the install. enjoy the game!"

,kaiidir,2013-05-03T05:51Z,"Works perfectly!! Huge props to the team for their hard work!!

I had the ""Game must be 100% downloaded"" error like many others, and I fixed it by MERGING the Battle.net folder from the crack with the Battle.net folder that the game installed - specifically the .MPQ file in there. I don't know what that did, but now my game works flawlessly (after also following the instructions in the torrent itself and deleting the StarCraft II directory in the My Documents folder).
Hope this helps someone else experiencing the same error!"
,ktron2020,2013-05-05T10:54Z,"Two separate issues being discussed here:  
1) if you installed sc2 wings of liberty b4, and the launcher crashes, delete the folder starcraft II from your user profile (c:users(username)starcraft II)
2) if you get the 100% downloaded error and you can't figure out the firewall settings, try disabling your network card (control panel, network connections)
This build works great!"
,rock53,2013-05-05T19:30Z,"This version WORKS! Only issue is that sometimes when u hit ""play"" in the launcher, nothing happens. Try again and the game starts. I encountered no other issues. "
,qasmi,2013-05-07T12:56Z,"All Those Who r having problem:game starts and crash and starter edition cannot play offline error just follow the steps:

1. If you have installed the FLT version First Uninstall it and then go to MY Document and delete the Star Craft II folder.

2. Mount the iso file with daemon tools and then install the game.

3. copy the crack to the game directory.

4. now open windows firewall block all the exes. in the game directory.

5. now before opening starcraft II .exe unplug your internet connection and then open starcraft II .exe.

6. A Window will open write ""rldsince@9y.com"" let the game initialize and press play

   Enjoy."

For people that are complaining about dl speed, have patience, i know i waited like a month with my awful dl speed!
I have a Q, there's a folder named 'updates'... so have the updates already been applied or your gota update?"
,florencio15,2013-05-17T09:30Z,"For Those Who Are Not Able To Run The Game
Heres My Idea---- Its only and Idea But work For me I Dont Know If It Will Work for You.....

When I Install The FLT Installer I Get 100% etc and even i delete the starcraft 2 in my documents its the same.. and i dint install SC2 Wing Of Liberty.. and of course i have the wings of liberty installer...

So Here What I do delete the FLT installer Uninstall it using revo uninstaller....but the real thing is while i am waiting to finish downloading this torrent i install the wings of liberty and finish the mission, so when i finish my dl I install reloaded SC2 heart of the swarm....... first i block all existing SC2 In my Firewall And In Advance setting and but when i run it i still got the same prob 100%etc so here what i do i simply delete my document starcraft 2 and it run and its has all save game on wings of libery.... maybe you may install the wings of liberty first play some mission and install reloaded heart of the swarm...... 

THis Is Not SUre..... But If You Want TO RUn The Game Then Nothing to lost when you try

Sorry for my bad english.... ^_^ i usually speak filipino ^_^"
,BakUpAllYouCan,2013-05-19T11:37Z,"Had problem ""unable to connect BNET...100%"" w/e.

I had previously installed reloaded's SC2 wings of liberty.  and was going to install over it, then read that this Trnt includes:

Includes Wings of Liberty.

ne ways wanted to say that after a couple of reno installs/uninstalls.  I took the advice of deleting the My Documents folder/starcraft 2/ (where the save games are) and she starts up now.  

I did back it up by copying it to another folder.  just so I could save my saves. I Don't think im going to put them back just in case.

Thank You my Fellow Shipmates!  cu in the open cyber seas"
,florencio15,2013-05-19T20:54Z,"and guys the FLT installer is not working now and reloaded crack for the latest patch................... so dont update just in case................ and i recommend to DL this torrent and follow the comments if you are or will not run the game

If you want online buy the game it has a lot of enjoyment you won't be disappointed..."
,The Hawk,2013-05-30T03:37Z,"OH!  oh!  It's pirated!?  REALLY!?  

I'm absolutely shocked that ""The PIRATE bay"" has pirated software on it!

Well in that case I won't download it!   ...I'll just grab this torrent file (which is NOT the game) instead!

BWAWAAHAHHA!!!!!"
,necrogen,2013-05-30T07:18Z,"@The Hawk: Haha very funny. florencio15 was answering the previous idiot who was asking if you could play online with this.

No one has actually answer the question of LAN support - I know HotS was supposed to have it. Does this version have playable LAN support?"
,truthy,2013-06-04T20:15Z,"might have been posted already but if you - like me - have a legit wings of liberty installed (and therefore also chose another install folder name than StarCraft II so that nothing will be messed up) you'll have to

- temporarily rename/backup your 'old' StarCraft II folder in Documents so that a new one can be created
- and as blocking the game in your SW-Firewall isn't enough ... you'll have to disconnect your inet connection in order to play

that's what worked for me. to play your legit version again simply restore your old SC2 folder in Documents & reconnect to the inet."
