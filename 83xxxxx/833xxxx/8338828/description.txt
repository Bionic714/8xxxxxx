Ch4 - Labyrinth Complete [MP4-AAC](oan)
 
http://nimga.com/m/WGtXR.png

Channel 4's Labyrinth is a lavish adaptation of Kate Mosse's novel of
the same name [no, not the supermodel].

The book was published in 2005 and a year later was second only to
The Da Vinci Code in the best-sellers list. Little wonder it was
snapped up for the small screen.

Perhaps interest in this production is also heightened thanks to the
presence of former Downton Abbey star Jessica Brown Findlay
[Lady Sybil Crawford] as Alaïs Pelletier du Mas.

Dr Alice Tanner (played by Vanessa Kirby) is a modern-day PhD graduate
who inherits a home in the South of France where she is haunted by
dreams of a woman from the past. Back to medieval times where we follow
the life of Alaïs Pelletier du Mas, a 17-year-old who lives in
13th-century Carcassone.

Labyrinth tells the story of these two women, separated by time, but
united in a common destiny
