This is the entire One Piece series, up to date as of 04.04.2013. It is mostly (.mkv)format, however from around 510 onward, it is a mix of mp4 and mkv, as there are a lot of 720p episodes mixed in towards the later episodes. This is because I have had to collect this series from a shit-load of other sources. Additionally, there are a lot of split episodes towards the end of the series, however I dont have the time or the patience to merge them all, so quite a few episodes will have a part 1, and a part 2, just a heads up. This is a really awesome series, and if you are new to Anime, or like anime but haven't seen the series, i would highly recommend it, as it is one of the best long-running anime, plus new episodes every week or so and a running manga series adjacent to this. If you are looking for a specific file, and you are using Utorrent, you can always just choose to 'skip' the others and download just that, and of course I would greatly appreciate seeders, because this is an awesome torrent.
