ΓÇ£YoniΓÇ¥ is the Sanskrit word for the female genitalia, describing not only the anatomy but also encompassing the energetic and spiritual dimensions. While a yoni massage offers women the opportunity to enhance their sexuality, Michaela Riedl shows that the effects of this practice are much more profound and have ramifications affecting every area of life. Long held inhibitions in the West about sexuality and the shame and guilt associated with the sexual zones of the body have created deep-seated barriers that prevent individuals from fully expressing themselves. The practices provided in Yoni Massage are designed to allow women to overcome these barriers and reconnect to their innermost core and deepest feminine nature.
