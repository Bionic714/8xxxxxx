@Magash- Good to hear from you mate. It's been that long, I thought your friends in the US did find out you watch TOWIE!!!!
I'm sure they have worst secrets and issues!"

So.... It's TOWIE time again and this faithful Aussie follower is hoping like mad that you are as reliable as ever and will give all your followers the TOWIM(arbs) fix they need tomorrow...?! 

Hope you are well :)
