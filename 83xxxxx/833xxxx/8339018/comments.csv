,MyKrossini,2013-04-14T07:37Z,"@IncomePitbull It clearly states, ""For more info about this release, open .NFO file with notepad!!!"" If you can't handle that then you should not be using TPB. Do you honestly believe that this is the first place that these torrents are uploaded? Almost ALL of the files on TPB come from other sites like UsaBit, TorrentDay, Torrenting, etc. The uploaders here at TPB are doing YOU a favor by uploading here so YOU don't have to become a member of any other sites. Some of which don't allow people like you to even sign up. Just say THANK YOU and shut the fuck up, you ungrateful bitch. A/V 9/8 - audio has a slight echo but other than that it's a great copy. Good work VAiN and THANK YOU yet again TvTeam!!!"
