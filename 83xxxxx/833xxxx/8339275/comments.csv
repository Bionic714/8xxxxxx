,DarthXP,2013-04-20T08:39Z,"Thank you for commenting on my torrent, I am sorry to hear you are having difficulty. I have tested and found out that you must use the program 7-zip to extract the zip archive. You may download it from here- http://7-zip.org/download.html
I am sorry for the inconvenience please seed and enjoy!"
