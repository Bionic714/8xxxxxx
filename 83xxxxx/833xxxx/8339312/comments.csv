And the placebo effect of medication explains my changes since being diagnosed as bipolar after 20 years of hell. Of course I had to go though dozens of medication and dosage changes before that ""placebo effect"" kicked in. I overcome my mental illness and I am responsible to use all means to do so, from medicine, to therapy to life habits and education to see the source of things. Sure some people seek excuses, from the devil made me do it to illness made me do it, but modern evidenced based psychiatry is real and very helpful. It has it's roots discredited and harmful  practices, as do surgery and nearly all aspects of medicine. Science advances."
