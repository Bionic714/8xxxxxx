,eightyth_attempt2register,2013-04-04T09:32Z,Just a tip to folks wanting a dub in good quality -- take these and then get translated MKV (this specific type since they have no spammy watermarks and the subtitles can be turned off) and then play the audio for cheater71's low quality video while playing the high quality video for the subbed MKV files with subtitles turned off.  The last few ones from cheater71 had Omakes though which I appreciate as a lot of editions don't have them.
