Amrithadhare is an absolutely adorable Sandalwood film – a small and delicate slice-of-life film – exploring the relationship of a young married couple.

The story plays off the contrast of the two different philosophies of life of the couple. Amritha (the bubbly Ramya) wants to live for the moment and Puru (the disconcertingly Aftab Shivdasani looking Dhyan) puts off pleasure for a later day. In the hands of a different director, this would have been the making of a terrible Hollywood-style romcom focusing on the worst “Men are from Mars” clichés.
