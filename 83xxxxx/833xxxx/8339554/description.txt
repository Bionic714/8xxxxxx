============================================================

I edited all of the audio files with an audio-editing 

software, and following along with the book, I broke apart 

each audio file to correlate to a section of the book.  I 

organized the audio files in appropriately named folders, and 

appropriately named each of the audio files.  In addition, 

each audio file has an ID3 tag image of the album cover, the 

proper track number (in relation to all the tracks), and 

proper title and chapter information.  This makes it MUCH 

easier to enjoy while listening on a smart phone or other mp3 

player, go back and re-listen, or keep track of where you left 

off.  I figured if I'm going to go through the trouble of 

properly organizing the files, I may as well share it with the 

world.  I also included the eBook to follow along with.  
Enjoy!
