"The Future Dunphys"

When Phil takes Claire to the hospital for
her angiogram, they encounter a family that
is basically their future selves, and they're
not sure they like what they see. Manny drags
Jay on a visit to a prospective private
school, and Mitch and Cam organize a fun
"girls day" for Gloria and Lily -- but it
becomes a spontaneous "cultural day" instead.

Evolve... or die.
