Summary:

The exciting debut of a new paranormal romance series

As a Miami narcotics detective, Leah Daniels never knows how her day will turn out. But she certainly never expected to be strapped to a stone altar, the human sacrifice in an ancient Mayan ritual meant to coax up a demon from the underworld. Or that she'd be saved by a handsome warrior-priest king who claims to recognize her from his visions...

Jaguar Strike wishes he hadn't made the mistake of reuniting his fellow warrior priests, or broken the law by saving their chosen human sacrifice. Now, he has no choice but to join forces with Leah and invoke dangerous magic in a death-defying race against the end of time. - Goodreads Summary of Nightkeepers (Nightkeepers #1)

Note: Contains mature themes, and scenes that are not suitable for younger audiences. Reader discretion is advised. Recommendable for adults that enjoy reading about Mayans, demons and steamy romances.
The series was originally called the Final Prophecy series. Book 5.5, On the Hunt, is located near the middle of the book, as it's an adjoining book with two other short stories from different series.
