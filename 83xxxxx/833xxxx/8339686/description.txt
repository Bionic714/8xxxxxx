Mills finds himself the target of resentment
from some colleagues when Severide supports
his desire to join Squad. Tara, a paramedic
candidate, joins Dawson and Shay on the job
for a few shifts. Meanwhile, Shay comes to
the aid of Cindy Herrmann, who suffers from
pregnancy complications while her husband
Christopher is out of town. Elsewhere,

opening of Molly s draws near, and Casey
receives a surprise visit.
