Uploaders Note: This is essentially a cinema level high caliber fan project, with real actors for a series that really hasn't been given enough screen time. 
George Lucas's movies where great, but the universe is so much bigger than 6 movies can possibly explore. Up until know fans have been content with expanded universe novels & it's offspring: wookiepedia. That is starting to change.
