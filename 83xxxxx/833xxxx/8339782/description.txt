The self-titled debut album of The Rockingbirds was initially released back in 1992 to critical raves. Much-loved equally by alternative music fans, country aficionados and singer-songwriter buffs, the North London-based outfit stamped their maverick country-rock brand on the young Camden Town scene. Defiantly bucking UK trends of the early ΓÇÿ90s, The Rockingbirds anticipated the alt-country revolution, and sit comfortably alongside like-minded contemporaries like The Jayhawks and Uncle Tupelo. This is a re-issue of the debut album The Rockingbirds together with a second disc of rare tracks, many of which are available on CD for the first time and all of which have been re-mastered. The album will be packaged in standard jewel-case format together with a 12-page booklet featuring new photos and sleeve-notes.
