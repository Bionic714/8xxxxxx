I edited all of the audio files with an audio-editing software, and following along with the book, I broke apart each audio file to correlate to a section of the book.  I organized the audio files in appropriately named audio files.  In addition, each audio file has an ID3 tag image of the album cover, the proper track number (in relation to all the tracks), and proper title and chapter information.  This makes it MUCH easier to enjoy while listening on a smart phone or other mp3 player, go back and re-listen, or keep track of where you left off.  I figured if I'm going to go through the trouble of properly organizing the files, I may as well share it with the world.  I also included the eBook to follow along with.

Enjoy!
