Enjoy.

,SmokeShadows,2013-04-04T18:43Z,"there should be a list, since the filenames are in droid and need to be deciphered into a readable format, lol im not too sure what half of them are, and dont want to install to find out, just saying, if possible please post a list next time =)"
,dSeeder,2013-04-04T19:12Z,Thanks for your suggestion but it's really hard for me right now to do that. There's no need to install a app/game to find out what that is. Just tap on that and it will show the name of the software you are going to install. Continue if you are interested or just hit the cancel button if you don't. I actually keep the file intact so that the md5 checksum stays same. It's states that the file isn't modified or repacked to add any deceptive codes. Sorry for the little convenience for better privacy. I prioritize that matter the most.
,ibanz0r,2013-04-05T03:34Z,wheres the file list ???
,dSeeder,2013-04-05T08:10Z,Click on the files.
,geoffp,2013-04-06T12:17Z,"This is a big torrent to download when you've no idea - at all,  what's on it :-)
Needs a list in the description  "
,SmokeShadows,2013-04-08T05:59Z,"ahh i see about the md5 checksum, and can deal with it, we appreciate all of your efforts and thank you very much!!"
,dSeeder,2013-04-08T21:52Z,"All right guys.. I am hearing a lot from you already and now i think a list is necessary to know what's inside. I downloaded this games and apps from feirox , if you want, you can go there and check for the files which posted on March and around that time. You will get detailed info about all of them. Thank you,.."
,naruozond,2013-04-09T20:44Z,"For those who want to see the file list, just click on the files (the number in front of it )above in the description."
,sasi8,2013-04-10T12:51Z,"huge collection :)
A small suggestion.
next time please upload smaller collections with different categories.
ex: 1.wifi/tethering apps,2.back up/uninstall apps, 3.root apps etc "
,stevephp,2013-04-10T14:56Z,"All the games are Free No Paid Games, Load of Rubbish "
,DrPiso,2013-04-19T13:27Z,"what's this !!!!

,bobdoleo,2013-04-24T20:11Z,"Ok, if someone can download the program ""APK organize"", and run it on the downloads here, THEN copy-pasta the names into a comment, that'd be sweet.

I would download, but my dl speed's under 350KB/s
