doesnt do it for me.. plus they seem to be getting greedy
and comes across more and more stage

I dont think beechyboy has this up yet?

beechyboy if you do xvids (as tpb lost my messages to you)

make sure to add xvid in the filename as some people are mixing avi with mp4 for h264
also if have a title why not add it to your filenames as people tend to search on the title more then the episode numbering since its so messed up

see tv.com and tvguide.com sites for starters.. I suspect its still S02 now.. but I dont know or care
tvrage once said S03 but changed and so did a few other sites"
[V],psspss,2013-04-04T11:03Z,opps I forgot to align on interleaves and opt header for sony but I think it play just fine anyhow
,Hick3y,2013-04-04T11:19Z,"You do an awesome job here psspss. I always keep a record for myself as to which episode i'm ""up to"" aka s03e10/s02e25.
I like to see the fights :p lol. Such a negative bunch, they are!"
[V],psspss,2013-04-04T11:23Z,:O
[V],psspss,2013-04-04T11:25Z,"yeh I think its season 2 after all now.. just to keep flow I left it as S03.. this time.. but I prob rename all mine if I can be blowed

I like storage wars better but its gone quiet on that one.. no one capping or the law suit fight put a hold on it?"
[V],psspss,2013-04-04T11:29Z,yeh I forgot to sort header as i noticed the black long bits left in and re0edited it which undoes the extra optimizing lol make mistakes when tired I guess :/
[V],psspss,2013-04-04T12:15Z,ok Ive renamed my collection.. your noticed that S02E14 ane S02E15 are missing (rename backwards is easier starting at S03E10) so we did miss getting those episodes... initially.. not sure if anyone has added them to tpb etc since but i have a look about.. the thing is one needs a stream id to source them and they only offer them for limited time i believe too :/
[V],psspss,2013-04-04T13:35Z,anyhow I did say I stick with paranormal and UFO and mytery shows but I will do the odd missing show I do watch like this cant say I keep doing them.. depends on data caps here sadly.. and I just had a ahole free loader come to our house (kid) and download 7gb of our limited data plan. thats liek 3 days worth!
,miamisunset,2013-04-04T14:40Z,"The Futon Critic lists production numbers:
http://thefutoncritic.com/showatch/storage-hunters/listings/
These suggest that it's still season 2. Although it appears that the next episode could be the last of the season.
Storage Wars isn't back to new episodes until the 16th."
[V],psspss,2013-04-04T14:55Z,"really cappers said wars was a new session lol

another messed up series huh.. i guess those 4 werent new season.. but the kinda look like it..

I think the new episodes were delayed cos of the dave suing them same happened to many shows the  same way,,. like cajun shrimping series"
,Majty,2013-04-04T15:31Z,"Its still watchable. I hope to see some more container wars in the future, that arab dude sure is one pissed fellow!"
,miamisunset,2013-04-04T15:34Z,"Those 4 were a new season of Wars, but then they decided to run repeats for a few weeks."
,Metazip,2013-04-23T14:30Z,Anyone have episode 26?
[V],psspss,2013-04-26T16:41Z,not seen it.. was it on though or guides wrong again
