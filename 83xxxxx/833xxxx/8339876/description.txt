River Monsters Season 4
For three successful seasons of Animal Planet's River Monsters, extreme angler Jeremy Wade has taken viewers along as he unravels freshwater fish tales of giant killers - where sometimes the fact really is stranger than the fiction! These voyages have taken him across the globe to waterways far and wide, all on an endless search for man-eating creatures that lurk below. He's caught dozens of these elusive beasts, typically in remote jungles and unexplored lands.




7)  Invisible Executioner 
Jeremy Wade takes on Africa's wild Zambezi River to unmask an invisible predator that's dragging fisherman to their deaths. Crocs and hippos are guilty of killing many in plain view, yet it seems there's another monster stalking these deadly waters.
