This book was voluntarily read by a follower of Mar Stevens, and uploaded to YouTube.  I 

downloaded the audio file, edited it with audio-editing software, and following along 

with the book, I broke apart the audio file to correlate to the chapters of the book.  In 

addition, each audio file has an ID3 tag image of the book's album cover, the proper 

track number (in relation to all the tracks), and proper title and chapter information.  

This makes it MUCH easier to enjoy while listening on a smart phone or other mp3 player, 

go back and re-listen, or keep track of where you left off.  I figured if I'm going to go 

through the trouble of properly organizing the files, I may as well share it with the 

world.  I also included the eBook to follow along with as well as a copy of the criminal 

script questions.

I highly suggest listening to Marc's radio show at  http://marcstevens.net/radioarchive   

 

Enjoy!
