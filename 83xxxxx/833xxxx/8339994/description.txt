I edited the original CD files with audio-editing software, and following along with the 

book, I broke apart the audio file to correlate to the chapters of the book.  In 

addition, each audio file has an ID3 tag image of the book's album cover, the proper 

track number (in relation to all the tracks), and proper title and chapter information.  
This makes it MUCH easier to enjoy while listening on a smart phone or other mp3 player, 

go back and re-listen, or keep track of where you left off.  I figured if I'm going to go 

through the trouble of properly organizing the files, I may as well share it with the 

world.  I also included the eBook to follow along with.

Enjoy!

There is a story that is usually told about extremely successful people, a story that 

focuses on intelligence and ambition. Gladwell argues that the true story of success is 

very different, and that if we want to understand how some people thrive, we should spend 

more time looking around them-at such things as their family, their birthplace, or even 

their birth date. And in revealing that hidden logic, Gladwell presents a fascinating and 

provocative blueprint for making the most of human potential.

In The Tipping Point Gladwell changed the way we understand the world. In Blink he 

changed the way we think about thinking. In OUTLIERS he transforms the way we understand 

success.
