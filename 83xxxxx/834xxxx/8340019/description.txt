     For those unfamiliar with this classic world of fantasy                   
     adventures, Talisman is a game like no other ΓÇô indeed, it is no

     monsters.                                                                 
                                                                               
     As play progresses, a story unfolds from turn to turn: a heroic           
     epic of brave deeds, of daring encounters, of treasures and magic,        
     of battles fought and sometimes lost, but always a tale that              
     challenges and enthrals!
