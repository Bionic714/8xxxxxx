I edited the original CD files with audio-editing software, and following along with the book, I broke apart the audio file to correlate to the chapters of the book.  In addition, each audio file has an ID3 tag image of the book's album cover, the proper track number (in relation to all the tracks), and proper title and chapter information.  

This makes it MUCH easier to enjoy while listening on a smart phone or other mp3 player, go back and re-listen, or keep track of where you left off.  I figured if I'm going to go through the trouble of properly organizing the files, I may as well share it with the world.  I also included the eBook to follow along with.

Enjoy!

In The Power of Habit, award-winning New York Times business reporter Charles Duhigg takes us to the thrilling edge of scientific discoveries that explain why habits exist and how they can be changed. With penetrating intelligence and an ability to distill vast amounts of information into engrossing narratives, Duhigg brings to life a whole new 

understanding of human nature and its potential for transformation.
 
Along the way we learn why some people and companies struggle to change, despite years of trying, while others seem to remake themselves overnight. We visit laboratories where neuroscientists explore how habits work and where, exactly, they reside in our brains. We discover how the right habits were crucial to the success of Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, and civil-rights hero Martin Luther King, Jr. We go inside Procter & Gamble, Target superstores, Rick WarrenΓÇÖs Saddleback Church, NFL locker rooms, and the nationΓÇÖs largest hospitals and see how implementing so-called keystone habits can earn billions and mean the difference between failure and success, life and 

death.
 
At its core, The Power of Habit contains an exhilarating argument: The key to exercising regularly, losing weight, raising exceptional children, becoming more productive, building revolutionary companies and social movements, and achieving success is understanding how habits work.
 
Habits arenΓÇÖt destiny. As Charles Duhigg shows, by harnessing this new science, we can transform our businesses, our communities, and our lives.
