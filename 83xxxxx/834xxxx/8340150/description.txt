Description

Risty is the youngest princess of the royal family in the demon world, however it turns out that her brother Garum (who she isnΓÇÖt related to by blood), is going to be the next demon king! Having betrayed Risty before, Risty just canΓÇÖt imagine the things he can and would do to her if he is to be the next king. And so not wanting to have to deal with him, Risty leaves the demon kingdom and into the human world to establish her own kingdom, and make herself the Queen of her kingdom.

Installing?

None. Just double click on the .exe file.

The original game was given to me in four rar files. I've joined them together for convenience so it's easier to run.

This game is NOT IN ENGLISH. I cannot stress that enough. I know the menu is in english, but no one has released an english patch for it. Its sequel: The Second Reproduction has an english patch. I will upload that one if wanted.

Enjoy ~
