[T],STBGD,2013-04-06T01:02Z,"Yes. Now I see it (and that a later pages are not sharp scanned), more than 300 people didnt noticed it. I took just a casual look at the book (""it works""). I'm gonna see what I can do but I believe that it is from original scanner.... :(
If nothing I have more books on subject :)"
