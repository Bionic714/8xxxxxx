If you guys want to Torrent it, go for it, but I'm not Warner Bros or Universal, I'm just a dude trying to make a movie and support myself. If you could remove this, that would be awesome, but if not, I get it and am alright with that. For anyone interested in getting this for a cheap price and support an Indie Film, you can purchase the film in FULL HD at http://www.chill.com/pleasesubscribe

Thank you

,moeburn1,2013-04-11T15:10Z,"@dandobi, this is already full 1080 HD.  It's probably the same file you guys offer.  But since some people are complaining that the download speed is slow from your site, why not offer your file as a torrent?  You can do what's called a ""private tracker"" where you can set it up so only people who have paid can use the torrent.  You won't have to pay for bandwidth and people can enjoy max speed."
