However, there's a bug (found it on BF forums too) at the bonus chapter, when you should take the car to the church, instead of showing the map, it's stuck saying ""First, you should find David"". There seems to be a new version that solves the bug, but (at least for me) it's not worth the trouble... it's been OK as it was, next..."
