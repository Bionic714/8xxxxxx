But the quest is still. WTF is it and why are there exe windows files included?"

If you just go to the site with the actual software you will see its packaged that way with Mac/Win files together. Blame the developer. Granted he should have zipped it..but the result is the same. Get the one from the site and use his script... Took me all of 20 seconds to figure it all out and get it working.
