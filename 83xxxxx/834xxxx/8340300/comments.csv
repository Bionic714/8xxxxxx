,AdrianoPineiro,2013-04-05T20:33Z,"Hi!
I have installed Windows 8 Extreme Edition R2 64x
and now i can´t install the game, it comes a ""Error"" (Access denied), what can I do?
I wait answer:) 
Thanks"
,electro cute,2013-04-06T02:19Z,"FOR EVERYONE THAT HAS ""NOT 100% DOWNLOADED PROBLEM""

here's how i've fixed it.

1. i followed every step in the installer and got this message.
2. i've went in the firewall and deleted every protocol associated to starcraft 2
3. i've blocked a sc2.exe located in your install directory - versions - base 24944. i've blcoked it through advanced settings - ingoing rules and advanced settings - outgoing rules.
4. i deleted starcraft 2 folder located in documents directory - not the directory with install but directory that has saves in it.
5. IT WORKED!!!!

(i've also installed the game in c:starcraft 2. don't know if it helped or not).

be sure to have registry cleaned before the install. enjoy the game!"

This worked for me on an AMD FX 8150"
,locozombie213,2013-04-07T03:39Z,"If you got an ""Error- access is denied"" when you tried to install the game. 

I worked out that my Comodo firewall was blocking the run execution. Turning off/shutting down Comodo didnt solve the problem. I had click a button that said ""Game Mode"" or something like that. 

after that the exe file launched and i was able to install he game.

hope this helps"

,Boyarf,2013-04-13T01:43Z,"*****100% problem fixed*****
i believe someone above mentioned this, so I will verify it works.

Find your starcraft II folder in the ""LibrariesDocumentsstarcraft II"" and delete it. (for windows 7). EVEN IF YOU HAVE IT INSTALLED ON ANOTHER DRIVE, the game installs this folder to the C, or find wherever you put it manually.

then start the game. should work. if you want the saves, u can manually move them however the game saves slightly different now, so youl have to feel it out. Or just play a new campaign"

I had previously installed reloaded's SC2 wings of liberty.  and was going to install over it, then read that this Trnt includes:

Includes Wings of Liberty.

ne ways wanted to say that after a couple of reno installs/uninstalls.  I took the advice of deleting the My Documents folder/starcraft 2/ (where the save games are) and she starts up now.  

I did back it up by copying it to another folder.  just so I could save my saves. I Don't think im going to put them back just in case.
