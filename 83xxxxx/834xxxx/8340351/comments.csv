,DarkKlown77,2013-04-05T16:50Z,Thanks again Wanderer! Your the man/woman whichever the case may be!
,Quilroy,2013-04-06T23:34Z,"Works great Wanderer, another great upload (as usual). Do you think you could get Cultures 3+4 up, or a couple of the D&D (i.e. NWN 2, Temple of Elemental Evil, etc) games on special that don't have a GOG release (or not very good ones) on the pirate Bay yet?"
