I saw this convention-exclusive version of Critter #10 released by Darkness-Empire and (as usual on Thursday) I have to post something to TPB related to boobs and/or butts. However, I was check to see if it had been posted and noticed that the last one was #8. And then going back, there are no torrents for #1 and #2. So here are #s 1, 2, 9 and 10, thanks to Re-em, Tyrant Lizard King and Darkness!

(There are also no seeded torrents for the first (mini-)series of Critter, but I didn't find those.)

Please seed and share with our friends here on TPB!  --STFmaryville
