Ep 5: Maj in Manhattan

PREMIERE: Wednesday April 3, 9:00 pm
 
It's shoe time! After reviewing the shoe prototypes for her fall collection and pulling out all the creative stops to make them fabulous, Rachel jets off on the hunt for a Manhattan apartment. But can she ever live in a city with such limited closet space? And will Rodger ever go along with it? Meanwhile, DreamDry has growing pains that bring Rachel's stress to a new level. Thankfully a visit to Bryan Atwood's shoe emporium gives her mind a rest from her troubles! But when the shoes are off and reality sets in, Rachel must face her own growing pains -- is she really ready for a New York move?
