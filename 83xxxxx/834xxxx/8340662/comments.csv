,windevil,2013-04-17T12:33Z,Just installed it and what can i say i expected better FPS. Using I5 4gb 2000Mhz ATI 7770 and getting 15fps.So i guess you need beast machine to play run this smooth

,jamesdk09,2013-04-25T03:13Z,will dis run on Core i5 2450m 2.5Ghz 4GB DDR3 1600mhz HD 7670m overclocked to 750mhz/  950mhz
,finnr2008,2013-05-06T22:41Z,"@jamesdk09 it probably won't.
• VIDEO: graphics card with 1 GB Video RAM or better / NVidia GTX560 or AMD Radeon HD5870

You'd need a 5870 and probably a x870, 6950 or better. Even if you have a 6 or 7 series, you will need a top range card, not a 76xx.

I got an average 22 fps with AMD 965 and HD5850."
,stassano,2013-05-12T10:46Z,doesn't work... probably uploaded tailored this to his own pc and forgot there might be other models.
,varso2012,2013-05-15T22:50Z,i have a decent PC....and this shit crash all the time.
,mikedongs,2013-05-17T22:17Z,"taylorswiftfreak: uh, no that's wrong. of course it will run on a laptop as long as it meets the specs, just like any desktop. why wouldn't it?"
,mikedongs,2013-05-17T22:24Z,"finnr2008: don't answer questions that you don't know the answer to. his HD 7670m will run it fine! it's on par with a geforce 9600 GT which was a very powerful card when this game came out in 2008. when this game was released, i was still using an old geforce 7300 GT which is a real piece of crap, and it ran this game at around 20 FPS with all low graphics settings in 800x600."
,mikedongs,2013-05-17T22:30Z,"oh shit, my mistake. i must look stupid correcting people now. i didn't know the 2013 actually had updated graphics!

to the guy with the HD 7670m, no i doubt it would work well. you should download the original 2008 version of this game. that will run well on your system."
,mikedongs,2013-05-17T22:34Z,"
5.Support game developers like we do.

  hahaha, really? the people that release a pirated version of this game claiming they support game developers. give me a fucking break."
,mikedongs,2013-05-18T04:46Z,"oh, shit. the 2013 edition really sucks. they changed the entire character model for niko, and he looks fucking gay now. deleting this immediately."
,taylorswiftfreak,2013-05-25T04:23Z,mikedongsam talking about rockstar games stupid people -_-
,taylorswiftfreak,2013-05-25T04:25Z,mikedongs@ :  am talking about rockstargames !  stupid people -_-
