You seriously think there's never been one death related to marijuana? There's been plenty of killings and assaults over it right here in the US, but an estimated 70,000 people have been killed in brutal territorial warfare in Mexico, with many people beheaded. Most are caused by cartels fighting to bring drugs into the US to supply ""Fucking IDIOTS"" like you.

Sure, some of those deaths are related to heroin and cocaine, but there's been thousands of deaths DIRECTLY RELATED to marijuana.


This is from an article written in February, 2013:
""Although marijuana is portrayed as safe, the drug does not magically appear in the hands of consumers. Marijuana leaves a very long and very bloody trail behind, a trail that can be traced all the way back to Mexico. When people spend money on marijuana, they are fueling Mexican drug cartels who have killed tens of thousands of people in the ongoing drug war.""


If you're smoking pot, theres a very good chance that your money is going to ruthless killers who will stop at nothing to get it to you. But what do you care as long as you're getting your fix, right?"
