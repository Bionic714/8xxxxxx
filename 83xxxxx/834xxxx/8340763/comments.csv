,dsbv,2013-04-05T05:07Z,Doesn't work on my jtag (usb). Haven't tried burning it because I don't have any discs. Anyone know if there is a fix?
,dsbv,2013-04-05T05:28Z,"Don't know what happened to my previous comment.

I tried playing this game on a J TAG through a USB. I've had no problem doing this with other games.

I get the message please download this game again and the address to the support site.

Is there a fix or should I wait until another version to come out later?"
,ganeshpr,2013-04-05T06:01Z,Does this copy work good or similar to Bioshock. 
,RobsonDUG,2013-04-05T08:28Z,"Alguem testou ou sabe se tem Dublagem ou legenda em português?

Someone has tested or knows Portuguese subtitles or dubbing?"
,hardcorecouple69,2013-04-05T09:20Z,@dsbv in the last 2 or 3 years i have downloaded and installed over 500 games and i have come across that problem saying please download the game again and all i had to do each time is upgrade the nxe dashboard to the latest one to fix it- i used xeBuild_GUI_2.089 to download the dash and build the modded dash and flash360 to flash to the xbox360 with new dash--all you need is a backup of your nand taken with flash360 and your cpu key.
,napsterdp,2013-04-05T09:45Z,Does this verify on ABGX?
,flurryous,2013-04-05T18:31Z,"Download's moving hella slow... my internet connection is 17MB/s, and I'm always sure to seed for whatever my download was worth... but at this rate, the game will be out before my download finishes.

I exaggerate, of course, but 2 days? Auuuugh guys. Increase your uploads. My shit is always open-ended so the people after me get the best of what I've got. Please please PLEASE seed like you care. :("
,anm00727,2013-04-05T19:40Z,"Hi, thanks for the upload and I'm sure its working great for everyone else. However, I myself couldn't get it working.

I'm using IMGburn (up to date) with the truncate method, did not go through abgx360 because I don't plan on going online (an have not for any of my games either). Also using the proper verbatims.

I ended up getting an I/O error half way through the burn, anyone have a solution?"
,malasorte7,2013-04-05T20:37Z,since i didin't own a xbox but i'm interested in the story mode ( i bet i'm not the only one) can someone upload those video on pirate bay? dont upload on youtube cause WB are getting them removed fast. Thanks.
,GetBangedOnNewb,2013-04-05T21:47Z,i hope i can extract the iso on this one. kept getting access denied on the new hitman game through xbox image browser. will post if working here in a few im at 94.5
,Smallz94,2013-04-05T22:52Z,Done downloading and now seeding for few days and I will post up later hows the game :))
,retlem,2013-04-05T22:52Z,updated dashboard to 16203. ran it through agbx and burned it with truncate via img burn and it still doesn't read disc in xbox... :( does it not work with flashed drives? I dont have jtag.
,Nutinurgut,2013-04-05T23:11Z,Is this flash to xbox only? Or can i play this on my pc?
,GetBangedOnNewb,2013-04-05T23:29Z,"TRY THIS if you are getting an error while burning or extracting iso through image brower. Right click on the iso after downloading, click on ""properties"" and uncheck ""READ ONLY"" this solved my problem and it might solve yours if you are having errors. S/o to Chrome Modz for his help. "
,Smallz94,2013-04-06T03:15Z,"Are you dum Nutinurgut  This is only for xbox360

anyways this game works for me. Burned with Truncate method without ihas burner "
,Ross13X,2013-04-06T03:32Z,Am I mistaken in thinking I can burn this to a verbatim? I've tried twice to no avail. Excuse my ignorance.
,GotLongboard,2013-04-06T11:37Z,"Confirmed broken on RGH Dash 15574.

Tested XEX and GOD format and both times crashed to NXE menu."
,Averad,2013-04-06T11:41Z,Was able to burn and play without any issues thanks Gh0stNet
,anm00727,2013-04-06T16:19Z,"@smallz94: can you tell me your process of burning. I too have no ihas, but for some reason mine wont work (I get I/O error when burning)"
,Smallz94,2013-04-06T17:25Z,"@anm00727

I HATE THAT SHIT lol. Okay i hope you know you run everything thru abgx360. You dont have to do it with this game though because it is not release yet but all you have to do is to turn off your wifi. MAKE SURE NOTHING IS DISRUPTING YOUR BURNING PROCESS like dont go on the internet or dont play games while you are burning. So basically dont do anything while the process is still going. After you are doing, then you can turn everything one :))) hope this method works"
,Smallz94,2013-04-06T17:27Z,*done  *on 
,FLslova,2013-04-06T17:58Z,O jogo esta com dublagem em PT-BT e legendas tambem
,Assassinprofessor,2013-04-06T18:11Z,"im on LT 2.0 using topology works perfect, thnx GhostNet:))"
,gameboy77,2013-04-06T20:27Z,"ok so i too was having issues burning this and bioshock. did some digging and come across this http://www.ixtreme.net/360-backups/14394-xgd3-layer-break-burning-info.html

it gave me the idea to update imgBurn. i am at vers 2.5.7.0 and you know what, i just finished playing this game no probs :) hope this helps."
,GotLongboard,2013-04-07T05:05Z,Updated RGH from 15574 to 16203 and got it to work.  Great upload!
,anm00727,2013-04-07T17:19Z,"@smallz94

Thanks for the advice, it turned out to be a different problem. I never do things on my computer during the burn, however, I never would have thought of turning off the wifi.

Either way, this game works perfectly. "
,anm00727,2013-04-07T17:26Z,"@retlem
If unauthorized disc error: playing music on USB should work
If unsupported disc error: if you are on LT 2.0 then you'd need to patch the ISO (google LT 3.0 to 2.0 patch or something like that)"
,nevermask7,2013-04-07T18:08Z,"Anybody care to post their impressions of the game?  Is it bad, good, great, terribad?  

Would be nice.  It's not like you're planning on obeying the embargo rules, you've already pirated the game.  Lol"
,GetBangedOnNewb,2013-04-07T19:11Z,gotta say i've been playing the shit outta this game with my friends. most advanced fighting game ever.  definitely my top favor over the soulcalibur series
,rabbil21,2013-04-07T20:12Z,Thanks! Working on JTAG. 8/10. Cool game.
,kirAldk,2013-04-08T18:01Z,"Works like a charm, in multilanguages (french included)

Hey there guys release the upload, uploading leave one week after the deletam iso, download why everyone who download but low first is selfish and not share!"
,Ross13X,2013-04-09T07:14Z,@anm00727 What ended up being your problem? I cannot get this damn game to work no matter what I do. I have the ihas burner with the proper verbatims and doing a perfect overburn but it's not working. 
,cteck123,2013-04-09T20:34Z,This game works for me. Burned with Truncate method

,Averad,2013-04-10T17:56Z,"Game downloaded and burned fine using iHas drive and LT+ 3.0.

Game play is slow and feels clunky no where near the speed and action of Soul Calibur. Was expecting so much more from this game and it totally let me down. "
,nevermask7,2013-04-11T17:12Z,"Averad....it's not even made by the same people who made Soul Calibur.  Mortal Kombat has always been a slower and more tactical fighting game.  What did you expect from the same developer?  You want fast, you should play shitty Capcom games.  "
,Averad,2013-04-12T02:13Z,@nevermask7  - This isn't a technical game you can press random buttons and beat the entire game. It's slow and nothing like the action in Mortal Kombat.
,nevermask7,2013-04-12T22:10Z,"Averad - Oh, I didn't realize you played the game on Super Easy."
,smerfff,2013-04-14T12:45Z,Averad!! soul calibur is TERIBBLE! I hate that they get to use such cool fighters like Yoshumitsu and Yoda but totally RUIN them as chars with its AWFUL gameplay and crap story line. Play Mortal Kombat or Tekken. OH YEAH!
,nevermask7,2013-04-14T15:54Z,"smerfff - Well in his defense, I love Soul Calibur.  But you can't compare SC to Injustice or MK.  It's just not a fair comparison.  Two totally different types of games.  But yeah, C'MON MAN"
