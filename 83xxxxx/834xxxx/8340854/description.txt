A bit about Halloween Man:
Halloween Man is the story of a goodhearted but flesh eating ghoul who inhabits a retro-futuristic Texas city. Solar City is filled with superheroes, robots, and all manner of sci/fi stuff. But it also has an increasingly large problem with ghouls and goblins. So our hero hunts them down and mashes monsters into paste.

The central figure is Solomon Hitch, the titular Halloween Man. He's sensitive young man who as at heart a romantic. He's also a cannibalistic monster. Is he a hero or a monster? Noone is quite sure and the people living in Solar City are scared to death of him. Possibly with good reason.

Dr. Lucy Chaplin is the female lead. Basically picture Reed Richard's brain in Marilyn Monroe's body. She is the brainy beauty to Solomon's beast. (Halloween Man is above all...a love story.) She is what inspires Solomon to heroics and keeps him grounded in humanity. The fact that she is also one of the smartest people in the world doesn't hurt.

Rounding out the cast is a gang of weirdos and misfits. Including a foul mouthed wizard, a talking goat, and *gasp* a normal human.

The cover is a tribute to the classic Freddy vs. Jason poster.
