,Xigor,2013-04-06T00:57Z,Is this the game? it's pretty small
,ArtepSkywork,2013-04-07T08:23Z,"Hey faggots, no one cares if you have a fucking walkthrough. People back in the old days like me played the fucking game and figured it out. Take your walkthrough and shove it through kids asses who don't know how to play a game."
,kinroko,2013-04-07T10:57Z,"Gotta agree with guy above me, if you can't fucking beat a game of THIS generation without a walkthrough, then don't bother playing at all. Only exceptions I might make are for Dark Souls, and that's only for finding some of the hidden shit, since exploring in DS isn't...Rewarded very often."
,deyyan,2013-04-07T12:14Z,Awesome !!!! Thanks ! This game brings old memories :)
,MjShitF,2013-04-07T17:18Z,Lol I agree. how retarded do you have to be to need or want a walk through.
,SlyFox909,2013-04-07T17:41Z,please upload Mac Version
,psimon,2013-04-08T19:03Z,anyone know if there is a way to play this in a windowed mode? i apologize if this is a noobish Q
,Khaoskidd,2013-04-13T05:02Z,ummmm....who asked for a walkthrough?!
,snusbagaren,2013-04-13T13:06Z,"Awsome! Thank you, will surely buy if first 10min is goiod"
,zaroba,2013-04-13T13:06Z,"@ khaoskidd

obviously somebody who's post was deleted.  lol

And I agree, if you need a walkthrew for any game (outside of helping when getting badly stuck) then you you should stop trying to play them because your not even playing them, your just following the directions of a walkthrew like it's a gps."
,vinivitesmw456,2013-04-14T01:24Z,"@ArtepSkywork
@kinroko

You guys are ignorant as fuck. What if someone can't play w/o a walkthrough? Then they MUST not play it? Lol... people play however they want. Being able to play w/o walkthroughs is a talent, not a requirement.
