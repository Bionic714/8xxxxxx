In the tradition of Laura Corn's 101 Nights of Great Sex, Great Sex Notes includes notes for her to give him and for him to give her. With short introductory text to get communication and intimacy flowing, each note includes an enticing activity for lovers to share. 

For example:
Come with Me, Outside
Outside feels different than inside, and having sex outside feels different than having sex inside. Differences are fun and exciting. So, whether you have a house with a big backyard, an apartment with a little balcony, or only have access to your roof from your apartment, find some way to get outside with your partner for some very fun sex. The idea isn't to be public, it's just to be outside, although the risk of being seen may add to the excitement.

It may be difficult to go all the way with it, in terms of comfort, availability of a place to lie down, etc. But you'll improvise, and you can always get off to a good start outside and then move inside for more comfort. There is just something about the fresh air and having no walls around you that is very stimulating.
