 Nathan Leopold Jr. was half of the famed duo Leopold and Loeb, murderers of 14-year old Bobby Franks in 1924 on the south side of Chicago. Life Plus 99 Years is an autobiographical work which does not dwell on the crime, as Leopold was attempting to present a positive image to his parole board at the time.
