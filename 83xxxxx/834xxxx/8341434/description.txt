Despite the many changes in governance regulation over the past decade, few boards function as a true corporate asset to the companies they oversee. In this book, Behan offers practical advice that a CEO, Chairman or board member can introduce at the very next meeting. Boardrooms are filled with intelligent, accomplished peopleΓÇöyet seldom achieve their full potential and add the kind of value for the CEO, executive team and company shareholders that many boards are actually capable of.

Beverly Behan draws on her experience working with more than 100 boards over the past 14 yearsΓÇöfrom major Fortune 500s to recent IPOsΓÇöoffering no-nonsense insights that can take any board from mediocrity to the top of its game including establishing a constructive working relationship with your board; addressing some of the dysfunction that may lie within the board youΓÇÖve inherited, and making your board a significant asset to you, your company, and your executive team.

Working with the Board of Directors is one of the most important components of any CEOΓÇÖs jobΓÇöand most will admit it is something they wish they knew more about. Nearly all CEOs want to change at least something about their board, yet many are unsure how to go about this in the right way. This book not only alerts the reader to common pitfalls that CEO's can make with their boards, it provides workable approaches to a tackle a variety of boardroom issues from getting new talent into the boardroom to engaging effectively with the board on strategy and succession planning.
