,Kortzen,2013-04-04T20:32Z,"I downloaded an earlier Reloaded version and installed it with no problem. For some reason when I run the Starcraft shortcut it simply dies. I've blocked the sc2.exe, but apparently it wont even run the game.

Not sure what I'm doing wrong...I did block ALL the .exe in the the Starcraft folder...Was I overzealous?"
