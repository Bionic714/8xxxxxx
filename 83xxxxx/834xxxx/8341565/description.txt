Hired to answer user questions such as ΓÇ£What is a poke?ΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£Why canΓÇÖt I access my ex-girlfriendΓÇÖs profile?ΓÇ¥ her early days at the company were characterized by a sense of camaraderie, promise, and ambition: Here was a group of scrappy young upstarts on a mission to rock Silicon Valley and change the world.

Over time, this sense of mission became so intense that working forfelt like more than just a job; it implied a wholehearted dedication to ΓÇ£the cause.ΓÇ¥ Employees were incentivized to live within one mile of the office, summers were spent carousing at the company pool house, and female employees were told to wear T-shirts with founder Mark ZuckerbergΓÇÖs profile picture on his birthday. Losse started to wonder what this new medium meant for real-life relationships: Wouldimprove our social interactions? Or would we all just adapt our behavior to the habits and rules of these brilliant but socially awkward Internet savants who have become todayΓÇÖs youngest power players? Increasingly skeptical, Losse graduated from customer service to the internationalization teamΓÇötasked with rolling outto the rest of the worldΓÇö finally landing a seat right outside ZuckerbergΓÇÖs office as his personal ghostwriter, the voice of the boy king.
