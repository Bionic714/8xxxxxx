,Nanak007,2013-04-13T19:05Z,Most of the FLAC Files are unusable as far as I've experienced.  A few are OK.  A majority won't translate in XLD or any other program.  I don't know what's wrong with them

THIS ONE IS WORTHWILE FOR JAZZ FANS.

I don't know why it would all be packed into a single ISO file rather than just allowing us to pick and choose the albums, but hey, what can you do?

When extracting the ISO file with winrar, I did get a few errors (2% or so), but then did the same with Power ISO and unpacked all of the flac files without a single error, so if you get errors (like the comment above), try Power ISO.

I will be adding around 80% of these albums to my Jazz collection, so like I mentioned, this DL really is worth the wait for Jazz fans!

Just be patient, I will seed to at least a 3:1 ratio (which will take me like a month).

Thanks to the uploader!"
