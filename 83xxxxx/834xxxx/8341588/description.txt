Ladies and Gentlemen... Today my heart explodes with happiness as SYN​-​ÆSTHETIC oscillates out of infinity and emerges from the cosmic dust of the Golden Nebula Pool. I feel incredibly grateful and continuously inspired to have worked with Erik Blood﻿, Adam Straney﻿, Anna Porter﻿, Kyle Michael Porter﻿, Palaceer Lazaro, Irene Barbaric, Rude Boutique, Sasha Perera﻿, and John Rafter Lee.
