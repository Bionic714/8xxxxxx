I love the sound, just a shame it's not mixed to be more dynamic in my opinion ;) Thank you once again for all of the vinyl uploads! A lot of people really appreciate them, and anticipate new ones as they pop up. You're doing a great job :-)"

,gheghe1,2013-04-06T20:50Z,"sorry to bother, it's wonderful that you uploaded this, but on the 8th and 10th tracks there's a problem. the sound bounces between the channels continuously. I presume that this is caused by the condition of the disc itself, but if it's not and you could do something about it, I would be eternally thankful.  "
