The Operative: No One Lives Forever is a story-driven video game, set in the 1960s, and stars female spy Cate Archer as the eponymous Operative, who works for UNITY ΓÇô a secret international organization "dedicated to protecting humanity from megalomaniacs bent upon world domination."[1] During the story of the game, Archer is sent on missions to a number of locales, including Morocco, East and West Germany, the Caribbean, and the Alps, where she gets into intense situations, such as scuba diving a shipwreck, freefalling from an airplane without a parachute, and exploring a space station in outer space, all the while fighting armed villains.

As in the first game, missions can be completed by pure action, by using pure stealth, by using gadgets, or a combination of all methods. In many cases, the missions are more open ended. While the original game contained several missions that required you not to be detected or to avoid setting off alarms, the sequel contained only a few objectives that required complete stealth (i.e. do not set off any alarms while in the proximity of a certain objective.) However, to counter this, NOLF2 utilizes re-spawning enemies more often than the original to encourage the player to complete the missions in a surreptitious manner.
