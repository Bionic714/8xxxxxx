,vonepic,2013-04-04T22:06Z,"Don't forget.. Rather than enjoy life and everything it has to offer there's those that crawl around the internet shitting on everything, living to complain.. 

Awful shame we let people like that continue to waste our air/land when we're overpopulated as is eh?  

Thanks for the awesome torrent, I appreciate a good 4/1 joke, especially one like this that they put some thought into and you can really have some fun with it :) "
