So I figured I'd let my first torrent be a 2 hour mix I made this morning of MLP music.

I find it pretty great, as well as some of my friends. 

Please let me know your thoughts and provide feedback for any improvement.

Just so you know, this isn't "girly" Brony music, but actual enjoyable electronic music.


Thanks

I'm uploading from my school, so I'll try my best to seed, but someone please download and seed this so it's not lost since my internet at home is disconnected.
