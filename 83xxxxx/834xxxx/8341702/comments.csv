,SteelerJ17,2013-04-04T23:46Z,I have question for you. How many uploads do you need to have to get a color skull? Feel free to use any of my torrents.

It's not about the amount of torrents.
Other users should find you well and they can recommending you in the forum of TPB,
that you earned a skull for good torrents.

Just good torrents with proper information and adequate seeding and you earned finally a skull.

1 condition is very important in earning a skull, and stands in the forum clearly defined.
You should never ask, because TPB staff is seeing everything from everybody and if u deserve, finally u get a skull.

Just get your account at the forum, and find all information u need to get a skull."

,DerSpiegel64,2013-04-11T03:12Z,If I earn a skull can I use it to buy groceries or pay my mortgage?
