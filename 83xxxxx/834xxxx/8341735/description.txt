Anthrax have always had a thing for the odd cover. Search early
albums and you'll hear their takes on Black Sabbath and Sex
Pistols. Then, of course, there's the legendary version of Public
Enemy's "Bring the Noise," a song that played a massive role in
their success. For the Anthems EP, they tackle six classic rock
radio staples from their teenage years: Rush's "Anthem," AC/DC's
"T.N.T.," Boston's "Smokin'," Journey's "Keep on Runnin'," Cheap
Trick's "Big Eyes," and Thin Lizzy's "Jailbreak." When original
singer Joey Belladonna tries to hit the Geddy Lee high notes it
can get a little iffy, but most takes are meticulously executed
and in the fun, dumb spirit that most Anthrax fans will love
