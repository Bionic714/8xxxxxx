1983... The year when ex-Deep Purple singer Ian Gillan joined forces with the almighty Black Sabbath. The result was the outstanding "Born Again" album, well maybe not outstanding but a unique and desireable product.

Released in 1992 in Italy. These recordings are taken from mint condition pre-boradcast-LP's of the US Radio Program "Captured Live". The sound quality is stellar! No one should miss the chance to hear Sabbath layin' down the legendary "Smoke On The Water". Wow!! This is the definitive version of the famous show.
