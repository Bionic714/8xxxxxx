Loopkicks is a Tricking team from the San Francisco Bay Area, ca. The team curates a week long camp extravaganza of tricks, creative potential, and pure fun. Every camp we highlight the week with performances and tricking battles and insane body movement during our 7-20 Night Show.

Since our first camp in 2004, the art and craft of Tricking has evolved and proved to the world to be infinite and magical. Trickers from around the globe gather to share, learn and grow this incredible phenomenon.
