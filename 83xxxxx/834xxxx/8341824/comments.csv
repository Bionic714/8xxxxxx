,guidoanselmi,2013-04-05T18:37Z,"This was, after a couple of experimental films he did in New York with Brian de Palma, Robert de Niro's first ""Hollywood"" film. American International put de Niro on a bus with some pocket cash and had him hopping city to city in the South to promote the movie. He was a nobody and no one was interested in talking to him, but I was a movie reviewer then and had heard of the de Palma films, so I agreed to stop by and talk with him after I got off work. He greeted me in his hotel room and started a memorized spiel about the movie. I stopped him and said, ""Tell me about de Palma."" He gave me an incredulous look - we were in Winston-Salem, NC, after all. ""You know who Brian de Palma is?"" YOU know who Brian de Palma is?? he asked and broke in to a grin. It was exactly the tone of voice I'd hear later in ""Taxi Driver"" when he said ""You talkin' to me? You talkin' to me??"" Then he pulled open the drawer of the bedside table and pulled out a bottle of whisky. We sat and talked about movies for an hour or so. Soon he caught up with Scorsese and Coppola and got ""Mean Streets"" and ""Godfather II."" I'll always remember what a decent guy he was that night - before he got paranoid about the press. Wish I remembered more about whe we talked about - but the whisky poured a little too freely."
