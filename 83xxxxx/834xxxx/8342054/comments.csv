,MissComicGeek,2013-04-06T02:37Z,"@Blubbers83 I wouldn't know, I just collected these into one torrent for easy access since some of the issues are not available on TPB. I downloaded them all over the place"
,Decrid,2013-04-11T03:14Z,Any chance of you uploading Batman Beyond: Hush Beyond?
,MissComicGeek,2013-04-14T12:57Z,@Decrid you can already find it on TPB: http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7739929/Batman_Beyond_Mini_Series_%282010%29
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-22T03:11Z,"MissComicGeek, first and foremost, thank you for your torrent. i think the point Bubbers83 was making is just that this series, when it comes out as one of the DC digital releases, is simply titled ""Batman Beyond"". i think they've been reprinting the same stories in a printed comic called ""Batman Beyond Unlimited""."
