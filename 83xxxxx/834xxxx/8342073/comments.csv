,hashtagnwo,2013-04-06T04:50Z,"Chloe is a young Canadian doctor who divides her time between Ramallah, where she works with the Red Crescent, and Jerusalem, where she lives next door to her friend Ava, a young Israeli soldier. Increasingly sensitive to the conflict, Chloe goes daily through the checkpoint between the two cities to get to the refugee camp where she monitors the pregnancies of young women. As she becomes friends with Rand, one of her patients, Chloe learns more about life in the occupied territories and gets to spend some time with Rand's family. Torn between the two sides of the conflict, Chloe tries as best she can to build bridges between her friends but suffers from remaining a perpetual foreigner to both sides. Following up her acclaimed debut-feature Le ring, filmmaker Anais Barbeau-Lavalette delivers with Inch'Allah the moving tale a young woman's encounter with war and its everyday life.

I think we must get those bastard towel-head fanatics used to see their beliefs ridiculed so they stop murdering others for so-called 'blasphemy', which in the freedom loving west only causes verbal condemnation, no more...  We must try to civilize those barbarians the hard way or more will die because of their ignorance and backwardness.

.... And this movie, no big deal, just more of the typical franco-canadian tear jerking regret for how cruel the world is, blah, blah, ignoring the regular slaughter of baby seals and the brutalizing of the local natives through government handouts and liquor, nothing to make them worthy of admonishing anybody....

you r an American right? (with all respect to fellow Americans,the open minded ones)"
,portydert,2013-04-06T19:13Z,It's a good movie. It helps to understand how a group of people can hate another group of people. Good luck to Palestinians and Israelis!

@solidesnake

You mean the 'open minded' Americans who taught those murderous bastards of 9/11 how to fly planes? Those were suckers but fortunately most have realized what a good towel-head is....
