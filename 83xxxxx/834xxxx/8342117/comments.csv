,jizzlobber11,2013-04-13T03:34Z,"I cound't get this working all codes seemed to be rejected, so i read around for a few other jeppesen uploads on TPB and this is what i did to get this up and running.....

use VNX1-IBYH-E5K1-7G8F for code to install jeppview and flightdeck if you want that, i dont fly 
real life so didn't install that.

the later in the install use:

014KH45212 for full worldwide, this is the code reported by the uploader, and it works.

when startup for the first time it offers a 30day trial, dont start using the trial instead, 

select next and then activate by phone, 

use r00d kcab 

make sure its lower case with r zero zero d etc

then it activates and can be used, 

excellent stuff."
