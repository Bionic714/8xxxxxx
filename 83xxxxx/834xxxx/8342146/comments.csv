TESTED BY ME

,booobp,2013-04-05T03:30Z,"Didn't work for me using original install :( the splash screen starts and it comes to the log in screen, but then the game closes and goes back to the reloaded booter.

Also, yes the crack firewalled the game properly."
,booobp,2013-04-05T03:40Z,"Actually, I think it works :S haven't fully tested it but it ran normally and lets me use the menu of HOTS, but only when I just use the SC2 exe crack and not battle.net folder."
,pinkincide,2013-04-05T07:35Z,How about with the FLT release?  The one currently failing on everyone...
,DoctorGreenThumb,2013-04-05T13:44Z,"works perfect for me  and I used the FLT version
thank you 
I played about 7 or 8 missions so far not 1 problem"
,wpnig,2013-04-06T19:01Z,"This doesn't work with FLT release, at least not for me. Still getting the damn cannot play offline with starter edition bullshit. Ah well."
,BluntzNzigzags,2013-04-07T03:15Z,didnt work for me either...
,DoctorGreenThumb,2013-04-07T06:34Z,"really strange ...
it didn't worked for me before  with FLTs crack
I always got the message  I Can't play offline mode I need to register first 

when I  downloaded this crack and pasted it
it works perfect now... I played it little bit more  and still no problem I completed mission 8 now
sorry my first comment I just completed mission 4 ... stupid prologue took so long for me (in the beginning is like 2 or 3 levels where you run around) and I didn't notice before they show how many missions are completed 

I'm using the new starcraft2 app. to start the game  not more SC2Switcher
then something pops up, choice a character name ... while some initializing is running (something like that and only takes a few sec)
and  game starts .... log in with some email that was provided ""rldsince@9y"" 
I just click connect and than on offline mod and window pop up
Dr.Greenthumb
You are in offline mode
bla bla bla

I updated my starcraft to 2.0.6.25180
about installing this crack super easy :P
like always just pasted everything into your starcraft folder and done"

,Menegroth,2013-05-05T02:39Z,"This doesnt work for me either. I have followed the instructions in the .txt file exactly and still i cant get it to work. what happens is as follows.

1) The boot application appears asking me to choose a name.
2) The game ""heart of the swarm"" launches, Kerigan appears with the Loading indication.
3) The game reaches the ""Login"" screen. There the Login screen Contrasts out as to verify the login info.
4) the game is immediately exits back to desktop with the crack application where you choose your name.
5) The proccess ""Starcraft2.exe"" REMAINS active  inside the Task manager - Processes. 

If there is anything that you can tell me to make this work, feel free to post it here or e-mail me at env01077@env.aegean.gr

Am looking forward to playing this game. 

Also, I installed the uploaded game by RELOADED, without having the original Starcraft 2 installed first. Could that be the reason its not working? "
,Ruyh,2013-05-06T20:21Z,"florencio15 you must first let it update AND THEN block it, not  the other way round, that should solve the problem and if Blizzard already patched it download the downgrade to 2.0.5"
,florencio15,2013-05-06T23:09Z,"Awtz i already deleted it and downloaded the proper reloaded installer which is 14gb............ i didnt know there is an downgrade uploaded here ....... and i try all instruction, searching internet but didnt solve the problem in flt installer so thats it........... and if i also get the same problem in reloaded installer maybe you can put a video on youtube ^_^.................... lelz............. and thanks for the replies"
,florencio15,2013-05-16T21:21Z,"Ruyh Sucess I Playing It Now............ Maybe Its the update why the game wont run...............

I Get The Same Problem 100% etc....... but when i deleted the starcraft 2 on my documents it run..... ^_^ lelz............................. 

Dam ISP Slow My INternet Speed ^_^"
,Jailing,2013-06-01T15:56Z,"I previously downloaded the FLT version of SCII from Mr.Stifmeister could not get on any custon games because simply put it was starter edition because the FLT crack was not properly working.

If you too have the FLT version here is what you do in 3 easy steps.

1) Download this torrent
2) Extract the crack from the Archive 
3) Copy the CACHE inside Battle.net folder
4) Paste it in (C/) Program Files (x86) Starcraft II (Battle.net) folder.

5) Go back to the crack folder and copy the new APP from there and replace the one in (C/) Program Files (x86) Starcraft II.


Once you are ready just click the new app and choose your game name. You will lose all your previously saved data from your FLT version, I currently do not know if you can transfer over the data.

Custom games and everything works perfectly."
,IAmTorrenter,2013-06-09T05:03Z,"THANK YOU!!!!
RELOADED is a saviourrrrr!
the FLT versions dont work anymore, found that out the hard way after downloading 7 gigs, then updating the game which was another 4 gigs, and ofcourse they patched it by now so it didnt work.

however this patch fixed it all! just dragged it over to the install folder, opened the game and BAM i can play in offline mode. :D"
