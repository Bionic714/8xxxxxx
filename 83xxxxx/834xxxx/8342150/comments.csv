Would you happen to have seen 'Anathema' a 2012 female werewolf comic with art done by Chris Mooneyham? "
,reneshakil,2013-04-04T23:15Z,"u r welcome Skyreign
i'd this but deleted it somedays ago. i'll upload it if u can wait 1-2 days cause i need to recollect it."
,Skyreign,2013-04-04T23:43Z,"Wow! That would be awesome. 

Thanks again for the upload. I just read Five Ghosts and was thoroughly impressed. Glad to see Mooneyham get on a title for a major publisher. He's a Kubert grad and has some great stuff on Deviantart. I'm sure his name will rise in comics, even after Deering bashed him on Twitter after he left Anathema.  

People should check this out! "
