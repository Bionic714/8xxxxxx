,Akvafrank,2013-04-07T20:06Z,"Nice quality? Perhaps in 1978!
Audio is ""phonebooth"", video is more blurred than VHS.

I can only hope someone ups this in a decent quality - soon!"
,Akvafrank,2013-04-07T20:09Z,"Nice quallity? Perhaps in 1978...
Audio 3/10, video 2/10
Audio is overcompressed (phonebooth sound)
Video is so blurred it's hardly watchable. 

I can only hope someone up's this in a watchable quallity - soon!"
,q2323,2013-04-08T00:47Z,"Dear Mr. 1978 phonebooth, go fuck yourself, and wait for something better. 
Quality is just like as it was on the History Channel's website. Go complain to history.com"
,q2323,2013-04-08T00:48Z,Hardly watchable is your mother.
,pjones452,2013-04-11T11:42Z,watchable thank you! just wish it was HD but good effort!
