Audiobooks of "Drive" by James Sallis and the sequel "Driven". 

Drive: 
"You don't have to be a crime fiction fan to appreciate the subversion of the American dream that takes place in this hark back to the pulp fiction of 60 or so years ago.

James Sallis gives us the seemingly amoral Driver, who is what he does ΓÇô a man who drives stunt cars in Hollywood for a day job, and getaway cars in his spare time. The novel opens with the aftermath of a shoot-out, the result of the gang Driver is with robbing someone too powerful for them. Driver continues to kill in order to stay alive and, as he does so, the novel asks just how much we are tied to our fates; whether we can ever escape our backgrounds." - http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/drive-by-james-sallis-2360391.html

Driven: 
"This is a shorter novel than the first, a novella if you will, that packs just as great a knuckled-dustered punch. Sequels often retread old ground and this one certainly does just that. Yet Sallis revisits the character and his dour outlook on the world in new and unexpected ways. He isnΓÇÖt interested in Driver growing as a character ΓÇô he is who he is and everything that took place since we last spent time in his company has been a lie. When it comes down to it, Driver is good at two things: driving and violence." - http://alternativemagazineonline.co.uk/2012/06/01/book-review-driven-by-james-sallis/
