Here is Spose's (major label) debut single, "I'm Awesome" from 2010.
I ripped the tracks from my copy of the CD which I ordered online.

Tracklisting:

1. I'm Awesome (Radio Edit)
2. I'm Awesome
3. I'm Awesome (Instrumental)

The radio edit is the clean version. Track 2 is the original, uncensored masterpiece.

These are 320 kbps, AAC files. AAC is the format that the iTunes store uses - if you don't like it, you can easily convert to MP3 using a free converter. I prefer AAC (M4A files).

Cheers.
