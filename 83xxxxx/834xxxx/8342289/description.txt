This is Half-Life.

The original, installer and all, along with both expansion packs - Blue Shift, and 

Opposing Force. It ALSO comes with a few extra mods - Deathmatch Classic 

(Basically, Quake) Ricochet (Quite fun with a few friends) and Team Fortress 

Classic.

You can choose not to install any extra mods.

When installing, you will be prompted if you want to install the HD pack. This 

basically replaces the textures, giving the game a better look, but if you want to 

stay true to the original, you can choose not to install it. The HD textures are 

what is normally used for Sven Co-op, and does NOT need to be installed for them to 

be used in Sven Co-op. Sven Co-op comes with HD textures, and the maps themselves 

are configured for either using them, or not.

Blue Shift sets you as Barney, a guard at Black Mesa, who must escape the compound.

Opposing Force sets you as a Sergeant who was sent in to clean up the compound, 

but crash landed on the way there. This one lasts quite longer than Blue Shift, 

and has quite a few more weapons.

This will NOT communicate with actual game servers - it's a cracked version. Local 

(LAN) play STILL works for all mods, just look up how to do it (Never forget 

sv_lan 1). Sven Co-op ready, and runs nicely. Using a flashlight seems to cause a 

bit of slow down, but other than that, it'll run fine on pretty much anything. Oh, 

and attempting to host a server using Sven Co-op that runs through the game 

campaign (ONLY THE GAME CAMPAIGN, EVERYTHING ELSE WORKS) runs incredibly 

awkwardly, as deaths put you back at the beginning of the level, and joining at 

the beginning puts you in the air. There's a Sven Co-op mod to allow Co-operative 

play through the campaign, but it WILL NOT work with this. It does not detect a 

STEAM-VERSION ONLY file.


I've made a black wall! And it's falling apart at the seams!
