Encoded the entire series of Street Fighter II V into high quality MKV h.264 format with both English and Japanese audio, and English Subtitles as well.

Finding this series was somewhat easy but it was hard finding it with good enough quality to not bother doing this series myself. All I could find were small resolution AVI episodes and 60-70MB Mini MKV files that looked okay but were very blocky and had alot of detail loss.

For playback all you need is the proper codec if you dont already have it. 
Combined Community Codec Pack (which I prefer) or the K-Lite Codec pack should give you all you need and more to play these back.

You should be able to hear audio just fine if you have one of the mentioned codec packs above. If you cannot hear any audio and do not want to install a codec pack for some reason, then you do not have and need the nero aac audio codec. As of today it can be found here.
