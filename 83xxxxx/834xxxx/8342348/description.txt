        Discovering Statistics Using SPSS + Data Files 3d.e. - 2010kaiser
        =================================================================


Andy Field's self-deprecating, vivacious but yet easy to understand writing style has won him many plaudits, and now an award from the British Psychological Society (2007), for his irreplaceable Discovering Statistics Using SPSS. The Third Edition is now even more accessible to the introductory student at the very beginning of their statistical journey. The textbook now uniquely walks students from very basic to advanced level concepts, all the while grounding knowledge though the use of SPSS.
Accompanied by an improved Companion Web site at www.sagepub.co.uk/field3e including animated SPSS walk-throughs of tests discussed in the textbook; assessment materials and datasets pertinent to lecturers / instructors in Business & Management and Health Sciences; and a suite of other materials for lecturers / instructors and students as per the 2nd Edition. The original CD-Rom materials are now found on this Web site as well.
Optimization with Adobe Acrobat Pro.
