[for all those who care, I made this using another FLAC rip from TPB, I included the respective uploader's log file in case you wanted some sort of verification]

This version is split into multiple tracks. The original album had 12 songs, but many of them started with a song, and ended with an intro to the next song. This is annoying because sometimes I just wanna listen to "Summer Love" but on the CD it's too long because it has an interlude at the end. I split each of those tracks into two tracks and I labelled everything correctly. It makes it much easier to listen to the singles or skip around songs.
