Men... (Männer...)

1985

Directed by Doris Dörrie

in German with English subtitles (that can't be turned off)

Heiner Lauterbach ... Julius Armbrust
Uwe Ochsenknecht  ... Stefan Lachner
Ulrike Kriener    ... Paula Armbrust

When Julius finds out that his wife is having an affair he moves out and becomes her 
lover's roommate. Comedy ensues.

A great movie! Made better by NOT being dubbed into English.

Thanks to 'leila2' for posting this version in 2010. I had almost given up hope of 
finding it. All I did was trim off a few seconds from the beginning, and remove the 
last 20 minutes of static from the end of that one. That reduced the size by half 
without affecting the quality. It was recorded from a VHS video tape.
