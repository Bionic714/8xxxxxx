-The password is ""[Mafia-The City Of Lost Heaven]"" without the .iso. Simply copy and paste.

-After that, either mount it using PowerISO or other image processor or for better performance, just extract the folder to desktop or any other location, setup resolution to 1440x900, save, and then play. It must work if u did the right thing."
