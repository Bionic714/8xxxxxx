Zend Studio is a commercial, proprietary integrated development environment (IDE) for PHP developed by Zend Technologies, based on the PHP Development Tools (PDT) plugin for the Eclipse platform (the PDT project is led by Zend).
Zend Studio is tightly integrated with Zend Server, Zend's pre-integrated, tested PHP application stack. The integration enables developers to quickly set up a complete PHP environment and speed up root cause analysis[1] of problems detected in testing or in the production environment.
Zend Studio is also integrated with Zend Framework. For example, it provides an MVC view for easy code navigation and integration with Zend_Tool for automated code generation.[2]
