Here is Justin Timberlake's 2nd album, FutureSex/LoveSounds, in all its lossless glory.

This was not originally my rip. I just cleaned up the tagging a little bit, and added an extra cue file as I will explain momentarily. For those interested, I included the log file from the original uploader.

Included in this torrent:
- 13 FLACs (Album + 1 bonus track)
- log file from original uploader
- cue file - original track listing
- cue file - split track listing

The second cue file exports 17 tracks instead of 13. Many of the tracks have interludes or preludes preceding them, but instead of separating them into tracks, they are part of the previous song. I find this pretty annoying. If I want to listen to "My Love" for example, I wanna hear the interlude that comes before it, but I wanna get straight to it, I don't wanna have to hear "Sexy Ladies" first every single time. If this doesn't bother you and you just want it to be an exact CD copy, just go for the original cue file.
