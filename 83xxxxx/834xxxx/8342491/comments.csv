,smaw2010,2013-04-05T05:00Z,"Nepotu, I know you must be a Boston or Yankees fan. But please, I would like to see the nationals."
,Roger_Rogers,2013-04-05T06:23Z,"I love a good Yankee-Red Sox rivalry game, but could you please add some more variety in 540p? Only if possible, of course. And thank you very much for the consistent hockey games all season long."
[V],Nepotu,2013-04-05T09:43Z,I'm not a NY nor BOS fan. In fact I'm not a baseball fan. I'll do this for you. I'll try to help you with other games.
,smaw2010,2013-04-05T11:51Z,"Thx, a few games of the nationals a week would be more than enough. I know a lot of people also support this exciting team."
