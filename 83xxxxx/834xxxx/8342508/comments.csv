,DubKingdom,2013-04-11T01:39Z,"Damn your right, I fixed his by replacing episode 25 with the actual episode 25 and apparently uploaded the still screwed up torrent file instead of the fixed one. Wait one. Taking this one down and resubmitting the correct one."
,DubKingdom,2013-04-11T01:55Z,"The Stupid Delete Torrent Option Is Not Deleting The Torrent. So this is just going to be a dead torrent I'm not seeding it anymore, go download the other one."
,DubKingdom,2013-04-17T08:31Z,Don't expect to see me uploading anymore torrents here I am on KAT
