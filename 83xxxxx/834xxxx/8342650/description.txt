This was the first show from Jerry's third TV series, which began in 1967.

Also with Harold "Odd Job" Sakata, Victoria Carroll, and The Baja Marimba Band.

Thanks once again to Francisco for uploading these to You Tube....in parts
which I've assembled. His most recent uploads are incomplete, such as 
part of an episode with Don Rickles as one of Jerry's guests!
