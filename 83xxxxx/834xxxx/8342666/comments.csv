,ozforme,2013-04-06T04:04Z,krikri3 What's wrong with xvid? Better than 264 unless your going to watch it on a cinema screen.
,m8gix,2013-04-06T07:21Z,"Thank you, Subtitles are broken though. They overlap eachother."
,namrepus1,2013-04-06T08:03Z,"Anyone who wants to complain about the uploader taking their time giving us FREE shows/movies please feel free to upload a better version or.............  put up or shut up. Stuff here may not always be the best quality but its FREE! If you want perfect go buy it, if you want it in a different format/container then convert/remux or do whatever to make it the way YOU want or..............

Thanks for this up much appreciated always"

,topeak,2013-04-07T11:36Z,"Movie isn't that bad. It's worth the 700 meg download at least. The emo shit with the stupid blonde kid is ridiculous, but watching Iron Man and war machine blow shit up was entertaining enough after a few beers. 

You people sure bitch a lot over a free product. It must suck to be your imaginary girlfriends. "

,bubbasmith1235,2013-04-07T19:57Z,"Worst ""animation"" I've ever seen."
,q00u,2013-04-07T21:26Z,"You really won't believe how bad this is.

The animation is extremely low-budget, mix of cheap cgi and repetitive old-school Japanese style (that is to say, very low-frame-rate). The action scenes are shaky-cam, and look confused and ridiculous.

The voice actors sound like they are reading directly from the script, seeing it for the first time. Absolutely no enthusiasm. Plus the whole audio-work is cheap. Everyone sounds exactly the same no matter what's going on on-screen. In the suit? Sound the same as out of the suit. No effects there. Near? Far? Sound exactly the same. The backing score sounds like a school project. And, not a good one. Completely generic.

And the story.... have these people ever =read= Iron Man? Or seen any of the movies? Who are these characters? These pretenders? It's like really bad fan-fiction. REALLY bad. You don't know how bad.

It's not so bad it's good. It's so bad that it goes all the way around back to bad again.

This is a good rip of an extremely shitty shit. It's not worth watching, even for free. Actually, if watching this were my job, and I got PAID to sit through it, I would quit. Forcing prisoners to watch this as punishment would be a violation of their human rights.

In my long life, I have but three regrets. THIS is TWO of them. That's how bad it is.

You really _really_ won't believe how bad."
,ut_bhai,2013-04-07T22:51Z,it is not iron man 3!! :( god!!!! i was shocked for a sec.... bitch!!!! fuck!... animated series!!
,pauonepunch,2013-04-08T14:05Z,"Thanks uploader 

Also gotta love the idiots saying ""this isn't Iron man 3!!!""  No shit that movie doesn't come out for over a month. Also is it hard to read a description of a movie before downloading?  I would think not but people seem to prove that wrong by bitching about this...."

V/10
A/10

Always amuses me that people don't read the title name before downloading and then have the nerve to comment and blame the uploader?? LOL

Movie was good, had an AKIRA type feel to it (not the animation the story). I liked the animation especially the ""FLIGHT"" scenes, i think they did a great job with the supposed camera angles and such. 

Cheers"
,ScottyD7421,2013-04-09T06:48Z,"p.s. @q00u, dude!! u need a hug!!

Everyone is entitled to their own opinion on things and thankfully all of our opinions differ otherwise it would be a dreary world indeed but it's just a movie friend. Sure it doesn't follow the Iron Man lore to the letter but it's fiction.....U do realise that Iron Man isn't real don't u?? I mean, look how quickly everyone accepted Nick Fury as being a black dude when for the past 40 years he has been a white dude with greying sideburns....LOL

Mate, my offer of a cuddle stands albeit a virtual one if needed :-)"
,blankety-blank,2013-04-09T07:41Z,"@ krikri3 - XviD is playable on many home DVD players, and has been for a long time. If you want X264 find another upload, it's becoming far too prevalent imo now anyway.
To convert to x264 to DVD I'd have to get new software, and the ability to just burn along with 3-5 other movies and play on XviD capable players would mean waiting to see if it is the format chosen over mkv and other compressed files. Quit moaning and just enjoy the UL, and thanking them would be nice too.

Thanks for keeping XviD alive juggs, you and the other who do so save a lot of people money and headaches. I appreciate this UL along with many others you provide."
,pxpierre,2013-04-10T06:41Z,"@ q00u - Very entertaining review. :-)

I hope you can make a living writing reviews one day.

Thank you juggs99 & seeders for the torrent and to q00u for saving me from downloading it."

M - 4 This is really a bad Marvel anime.  While none of the anime releases from Marvel have been that good (Blade being the best, IMO), this is by far the worst."
,BarryFLASHAllen,2013-04-13T16:35Z,"@q00u, how can you say Technovore wasn't in the comics? his first appearance was summer of 1993

The Punisher, War Machine, and from what I've read on the synopsis Hawkeye and Black Widow are in it, and they too have appeared in Iron Man Comics, Iron Man tv shows, and Iron Man Movies. 
do you not like anime-animation or something? 
listen, we get it, you're a fucking poser who only goes and watches the movies and pretends to know how to fucking read.
we are sorry you are disappointed that this isn't Iron Man 3. But like alllll of those commercials have stated ""In Theaters May 3 2013"".
So settle for a different median on the telling of another epic Iron Man story, and read up on Iron man before you spill amples amount of shit from your mouth."

Kid, I guarantee I've been reading Iron Man longer than you've been alive. You don't know what you're talking about.

I didn't say Technovore wasn't in the comics, I said that these characters aren't the same as the ones from the comics. I was referring to Iron Man, War Machine, etc. In the comics, Tony Stark is an alcoholic genius. Here he's just a fuckup with money who makes constant poor choices. War Machine is a disciplined military man, and the contrast between the two is great in the comics. Here he's just another fuckup, if possible even worse than Tony (somehow). It doesn't match the existing characterizations. I thought it was clear.

Sorry for not spelling everything out. I assumed a certain level of erudition; the folly is mine. I'll try to write on your level in the future.

I *love* quality anime and animation. It is my favorite medium. I *hate* utter shit, which is what THIS cash-grab is. Go read my review again. The animation is low-quality. The sound mixing is bad. The acting is bad. The plot is bad. Dialog is bad. There are no redeeming qualities here."
,starlite2,2013-04-21T01:19Z,"First of all, yes I'm a troll. Secondly, the complaints about this encode using XviD (and especially an avi wrapper) are completely valid. AVI is an ancient wrapper, and has always been crap. XviD once was important as a competitor to DivX, which was patent encumbered... XviD had it's day, but is now quite depricated and irrellivant. If you haven't noticed, there is simply nothing encoded in DivX anymore, and there is a reason for that... better codecs are available. 

But I think what makes the complaint stand out is that this film is animated. It is a universally accepted convention that animation is encoded with 264 and wrapped in mkv. I'm pretty sure that's what prompted the complainer to complain.

Anyone that has an IQ low enough to believe it's worthwhile to defend DivX and avi can eat my dick. The codec is outdated and the wrapper is and has always been shit. 

That is all, fuckwads."

,cryskonig,2013-04-24T22:41Z,CONVERTXTODVD! If it doesn't play make it a DVD retard (or buy a TV with an HDMI and plug your fucking computer into it)
,michaelrwatson,2013-04-28T07:37Z,"@starlite2, cryskonig: You baby boys obviously spend too much time playing with eachother's wing wangs in your mommie's basement instead of creating video out in the real world, so FYI: 

1. AVI was never the best wrapper but is perfectly good, takes low CPU usage (i.e. good bang for the buck), is universal and reliable. 

2. If you knew anything at all about video you would have mentioned MP4 which is the best wrapper and happens to be a standard, unlike Mkv.

3. MKV sux greasy goats balls. "
