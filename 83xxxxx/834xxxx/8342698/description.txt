mirrormaster82 posted a scan of this trade paperback a couple of years ago, and I also included that file in one of my graphic novel megatorrents. However, this is a higher-quality scan by Bchry-DCP, who is a prolific master of trade paperback scanning.

Even 15 years later, I'm amazed by the creators assembled for this project, but still disappointed that it was so plagued by delays. (It took almost a year and a half for 4 issues.)

Enjoy and please seed to share with all our friends here on TPB! --STFmaryville

From Wikipedia, with a few corrections by me:

WildC.A.T.s/X-Men was a crossover event from Jim Lee's WildStorm and published by Image Comics and Marvel Comics in 1997 and 1998. Featuring the WildC.A.T.s meeting the X-Men, it was originally released in four individual comics, each by a different creative team and each representing a different "age." The miniseries was collected by Image Comics/WildStorm as a trade paperback in December 1998.

The four stories all occur in a unique continuity which appears to follow Earth's history as defined by the Marvel Universe, but an Earth where events central to the WildC.A.T.s universe have also occurred.

This story takes place in Manhattan in 2019. North America is a wasteland ruled by the Daemonites. It is revealed that the Daemonites on Earth went insane in anger and grief after learning that their homeworld had been conquered by the Kherubim. Still intent on conquering Earth, they stole Sentinel technology from the US government and fused the technology with themselves, turning themselves into monstrous cyborgs who easily overpowered the combined human/superhuman/Kherubim forces which tried to stop them.
