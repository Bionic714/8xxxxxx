,zeno78,2013-04-05T23:17Z,I havn't abandoned ship... just because it says I'm not seeding doesn't mean as such... VPN works funny sometimes.

If you need help for mkv files, search: mkvtoolnix. It is the default tools for splitting/joining/etc mkv files."
,zeno78,2013-05-12T00:39Z,Future videos will include a sample. I assure you it is good thou.
