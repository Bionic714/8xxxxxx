This is an image of the Macintosh System 6.0.8 install disk. This was compiled from the two 1.44 MB floppy images on Apple's support site: http://download.info.apple.com/Apple_Support_Area/Apple_Software_Updates/English-North_American/Macintosh/System/Older_System/System_6.0.x/

This torrent is the all of the floppy images in the above link, already put together in an .img format ready for mounting. It has been tested with Mini vMac. You can also boot System 6.0.8 with the disk, no Network Access image needed!

I hope this saves you time, and please seed!
