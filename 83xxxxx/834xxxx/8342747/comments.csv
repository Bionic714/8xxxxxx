I've been looking for some classic Wrightson for months on here. 
I'm trying to do new comics in the vein of classic fun because comics should be a great fun read. So I sit up and pay attention to the Masters like Wrightson. 
After the comics I'm doing come out I'll try to find a way to send you some digital prints. One is 55 pages the other 88. 
Thanks for sharing this wonderful gift!  "

,desertshark,2013-04-10T04:17Z,one dump question: So is there two Swamp thing ? one by Alan Moore and one by Berni Wrightson ?
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-15T05:28Z,"Yes, there was the Swamp Thing from House of Secrets #92, Alex Olsen. For a long time, that was his one and only appearance.

Then Alec Holland is the Swamp Thing from Swamp Thing #1-onward, as well as in the 1982 movie by Wes Craven.

Len Wein and Berni Wrightson created both characters. Alan Moore didn't create either."
