This fills a request for an artist who aspires to study the greats. (And whose user ID has been lost, due to the damn continually disappearing comments, I believe.) Here's hoping TPB and digital comics in general can help the next wave of artists (and writers, and colorists, and editors) hone their skills!

Please seed and share!

This has a ton of good stuff, but I'm not going to list it 'cause my dinner's getting cold!!!
