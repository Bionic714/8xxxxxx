,customchevy_350,2013-04-05T23:34Z,Great quality but whats up with the english subs?
,customchevy_350,2013-04-05T23:40Z,Are they hardcoded 
,bananabre,2013-04-06T21:51Z,"@customchevy_350 they probably aren't hardcoded. It is an MKV file.. with the subtitles nested in the file. Up in the menu, depending on the player you can select to turn them off."
,joegi50,2013-04-07T07:00Z,Thanks.
,customchevy_350,2013-04-07T16:03Z,thanks
,joegi50,2013-04-08T21:48Z,Great film. Great video. Great audio. Better than YIFI. Nice Subtitles.
,ericsmith,2013-04-08T23:57Z,"@joegi50 YIFY's is also more than 5x smaller... people don't seem to understand that he packs as much quality into an HD movie while still being a fairly small download. My ISP caps by downloads at 120gb/month, I can't always go using up 5gb every movie that may or may not be good."
,ZarathosDJ,2013-04-09T23:28Z,@ericsmith IMO the compression YIFY uses to reach such size at the same time detracts quality on the video. So I guess some others prefer to spend 5 gb of his HDD but they'll be sure the A/V is top.
,transcona,2013-04-10T05:08Z,"Hey Zarathos!  Talk about stating the obvious!  I mean really?  A lower filesize detracts from the quality?!  NO SHIT!

Read his post again.  Some people have limited bandwidth, which makes YIFY's downloads VERY attractive.  It has nothing to do with hard drive space.  What is it with all these fuckheads that need this explained to them?!?"
,chairmanxyz,2013-04-13T05:55Z,Great work as always! I always click your torrent whenever I want a movie because I know they will always be great. Keep it up :)
,joegi50,2013-04-14T19:29Z,"Ericsmith, do not get me wrong, I love YIFY and they have done great job with nice video, subtitle, reasonable audio. Best of all, everything at a small size. It works well for ok films.
Gangster Squad is great and you can enjoy every moment, especially sounds to make it perfect.
For every great films, I would suggest not to sacrifice both Audio and Video (4-7 G file size).
Thanks Pirate Bay, YI-FI, PublicHD, and wonderful  contributors. We just love you."
