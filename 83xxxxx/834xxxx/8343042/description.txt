"She's Killing Me"

Upon receiving some unsettling news, Meredith 
and Derek take preventative steps for their 
children┬Æs future; a group of Syrian doctors 
arrive at Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital for a 
crash course in basic surgical skills that 
they plan to apply in the field; and April 
decides to come clean to Matthew regarding 
the truth about her virginity. Meanwhile, 
multiple pre-op patients develop infections, 
causing one doctor to wonder if she is at 
fault.
