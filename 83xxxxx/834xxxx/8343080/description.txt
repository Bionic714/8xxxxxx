Here is the ISO for Retro Machines Mk2, version 1.0.0. It runs in NI's Kontakt 5 or Kontakt player. This will work on both Windows and Mac computers.

These sounds are fat as hell. You get a lot more control than I thought you would, considering that these are sampled sounds. Really though the sampled part is just the waveform, most of the processing is done in realtime, so you can modulate it how you want.

There is no serial, no crack, no key, just mount and install. It should run in Kontakt without any problems.

Enjoy, fellow piratebayers
