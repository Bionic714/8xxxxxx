But: Couls you PLEASE add some of the most basic informations?

What kind of 3D? (Anaglyph? SBS?)
What Language?

Frankly: Its realy nice of you you tu upload all the stuff. But there is nearly no distribution, because noone else is going to share your stuff, too - because they dont download something they cant imagin what it is.

Some Screens would also help!"
