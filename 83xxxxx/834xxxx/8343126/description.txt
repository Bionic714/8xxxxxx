Thanksgiving is a special holiday during which we Americans gather with our loved ones, share a feast and most importantly, remember the good things in our lives. Thanksgiving reminds us to be thankful for these good things, value others and to share what we can, just as the Native American did with the Pilgrims at the first Thanksgiving feast. With such a wonderful message, letΓÇÖs honor Thanksgiving with the same excitement as the other endΓÇÉofΓÇÉyear holidays.
