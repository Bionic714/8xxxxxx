Praise for the Neverwinter Saga:
 
ΓÇ£Emotional, respectful of its characters, intelligently written and structured, and finally summons a sense of nostalgic sorrow throughoutΓÇ¥ΓÇôFantasy Book Review on Gauntlgrym, Neverwinter Saga Book I
 
ΓÇ£Full of excitement. Salvatore has mastered the art of showing a beautiful fight scene, and he is at the top of his game in this one. We meet many characters with many different fighting styles, and Salvatore does a great job of distinguishing between them. He manages to take these scenes from so much more than just a fight scene, to an integral part of the story.ΓÇ¥ΓÇöThe SFF Hub on Gauntlgrym, Neverwinter Saga Book I
