""Killed my laptop""

March 5, 2013  |   By abeaner

Version: Combofix

Pros

None. Complete waste of time.

Cons

After running this I could not open any of my programs. I had to restore my system to an earlier date, which left me with all the same issues.

Summary

Not sure how others got so lucky. I'd rather wipe my computer & start over than waste my time with this again."
