into the psyche of serial killers, to
consult. Jack also seeks the help of Dr
Hannibal Lecter, a brilliant p
sychiatrist, who, unbeknownst to him, is
not only one of the most successful
serial killers of all time, but also a
cannibal. After a copycat strikes, Will
and Hannibal join forces to track down
the culprit
