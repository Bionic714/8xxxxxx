,jonaslorik,2013-04-07T17:11Z,yeah. I think the pilot was really good and the preview for the season looked pretty beast. I would at least watch this one if I was you :P
,kssamseed,2013-04-07T22:38Z,"What a shit show. First of all its impossible to understand what the Hannibal character is saying, very poor voicing. Second, its poorly written. Don't bother downloading, this will be cancelled b4 first season is over, if the studio has any sense"
,UncleO,2013-04-08T10:06Z,"Thanks for the UL! The opening scene(s) promise one hell of a good acting/directing job.  Why just ""opening""? Is the jerkiness of the video deliberate?  Plz let me know so I can stop whining about it!"
