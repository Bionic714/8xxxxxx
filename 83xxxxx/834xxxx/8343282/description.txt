To mark David Bowie's comeback album and a new exhibition at the V&A,
Alan Yentob looks back at his legendary 1975 documentary, Cracked Actor.
The film follows Bowie during the Diamond Dogs tour of 1974.

Alan Yentob says "I'd caught him at what was an intensely creative time,
but it was also physically and emotionally gruelling. Our encounters
tended to take place in hotel rooms in the early hours of the morning
or in snatched conversations in the back of limousines. He was fragile
and exhausted, but also prepared to open up and talk in a way he had
never really done before."

Cracked Actor has become one of the classic rock documentaries of all
time, remaining an enduring influence on generations of Bowie fans.
