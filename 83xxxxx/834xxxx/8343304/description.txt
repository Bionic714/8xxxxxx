Star Wars: TIE Fighter, a space combat game, is the sequel to Star Wars: X-Wing, and the first game of the series that puts the player on the side of the Galactic Empire.

This is the TIE Fighter Collector's CD-ROM, which was released in 1995 and includes the following additions and expansions to the original game:

-Enhanced SVGA graphics
-New cinematic cutscenes and voice overs
-New fighter: Missile Boat
-Defender of the Empire expansion
-Enemies of the Empire expansion

This version is recommended over the X-Wing Collector Series Pack, which removed the cinematic cutscenes and soundtracks.
