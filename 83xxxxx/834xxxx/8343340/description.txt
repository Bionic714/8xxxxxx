"'For A Second Time' may well be THE BEST COLLECTION OF PURE MUSIC-MAKING THAT YOU'LL HEAR OUT OF NASHVILLE THIS YEAR." ┬¡ Rev. Keith A. Gordon, Blurt!

"...They meet through their humor as lyricists and their shared love of GOOD OLD-FASHIONED SWAMP-BRED GUITAR RIFFS, and as amply evidenced throughout this album, the result is AN INFECTIOUSLY GOOD TIME for all concerned." ┬¡ BluegrassSpecial.com

"The musical approach is rustic, recalling hints of Dylan, the Band, Clapton, the Allman Brothers, and Little Feat. Give this Daddy the respect it deserves." ┬¡ New Times

"...FANS OF ANYONE FROM DYLAN to WILCO will find plenty to like about DADDY." ┬¡ News4U
