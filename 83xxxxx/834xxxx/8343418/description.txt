A hush and a hurtle down the wrong end of a telescope, a slip and a trip through the cracks in the pavement, to somewhere removed from here, yet strangely familiar. Tales like this abound in English folklore; those half-worlds of quiet darkness, uncanny and uncomfortable. IΓÇÖm aware I sound like a pretentious prick, but I promise you ΓÇô that story, the one about the world glimpsed out of the corner of your eye in the mirror, that story is what Mary HamptonΓÇÖs music most resembles.

So now youΓÇÖre thinking Tinkerbell and glitterwings, floaty velvet scarves and dream catchers. Rainbows. Unicorns. Bat For Lashes. Please donΓÇÖt. Hampton creates art that is timeless, seasonless and genderless. ItΓÇÖs steeped in history and rooted in the Sussex downs and pebbled beaches, yet is also completely of the present and gleefully inventive. There are no histrionics, only an intense calm. But the calm isnΓÇÖt restful, itΓÇÖs anticipatory, like a hush in the air before the rain. When Hampton sings, her mouth twists into ugly shapes. Beauty is not simple and it is never painless.

On Folly, HamptonΓÇÖs second album, her sound is developed and honed. Her band Cotillion come into their own and instrumentation is used exploratively and to great effect ΓÇô off-kilter trumpet, steam pipes, violin, piano, cello, double-bass and accordion all feature. Most notably HamptonΓÇÖs voice is treated as just another instrument used to build up a brittle storm lantern of considered noise. Every song has been perfectly shaped so that thereΓÇÖs no question that each one is the definitive version. Take ΓÇÿBenjamin BowmaneerΓÇÖ, a 17th Century folk song performed under various names for almost 300 years, most recently by Eliza Carthy. Mary HamptonΓÇÖs version is the correct version. It just is.
