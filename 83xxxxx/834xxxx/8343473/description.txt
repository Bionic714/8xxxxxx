Live at El Morro, Puerto Rico was recorded and filmed during Yanni's two concerts there in December 2011. The first artist to ever perform at this UNESCO Heritage Site, Yanni fulfilled a 20 year dream to play at the beautiful and historic 16th-century Castillo San Felipe Del Morro in San Juan a spectacular setting for this live concert. For two sold-out audiences, Yanni and his world-renowned orchestra performed an inspired set of favorites from throughout his career including "Felista," "Voyage," "Nightingale," "The End of August," and more.
