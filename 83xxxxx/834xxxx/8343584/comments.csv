,ZenRhino,2013-04-10T00:11Z,"Thanks for the upload, but I was hoping you'd also have the prelims like usual. I had 2 friends fighting on the prelims fight card & i can't rip it from either the Bellator or Spike websites with the program I use for that.

If you can get us the Bellator 95 Prelims I'd appreciate it."
