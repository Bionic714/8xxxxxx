The eleventh edition of Modern Nutrition in Health and Disease follows from a long history of publishing an authoritative text related to human nutrition, from the basic science of nutrient metabolism and functions to the applications of nutrition for improving clinical outcomes and public health.

The goal of this edition, like that of its predecessors, is to provide an updated, comprehensive, and authoritative text and reference source authored by experts in their fields. In this new edition, more than 190 authors have joined this effort. Nearly 60% are new authors. All authors have provided the most up-to-date view of their respective areas.

The history of Modern Nutrition in Health and Disease now spans more than five decades, as outlined in the following table, which lists the editions, publication year, editors, and publisher of this text.
