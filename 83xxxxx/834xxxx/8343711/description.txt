The heavy haulage turbo charged PRR Alco RS-11 road switcher is now available for Train Simulator.

Built between 1956 and 1964, the RS-11 was AlcoΓÇÖs answer to the EMD GP9 and was fitted with a turbo charger and had a heavy pulling power of 1,800hp, making it an ideal heavy freighter but also saw some passenger service in its lifetime. In total, 425 units were built, primarily for the American and Mexican market, and some can still be found on US railroads today.

The Alco RS-11 for Train Simulator, developed by virtualRailroads, is available in Pennsylvania Railroad livery and features fully detailed and working cab, dynamic braking capability and independent wiper control.

The locomotive is also Quick Drive compatible, giving you the freedom to drive the Alco RS-11 on any Quick Drive enabled route for Train Simulator. Also included are scenarios specifically for the Horseshoe Curve.
