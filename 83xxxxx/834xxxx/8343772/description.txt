Easter Sunday, like the name implies, is a quieter, reflective and spacious
recording. Acceptance, which begins with a crash of percussion, soon sees Moore
playing a longing and gentle melody that stretches over quiet but insistent
brushwork. The woodwind on Suleika intertwines and shares intimate space with
the piano, which gradually become more rhythmic but still restrained. In
general, a quiet energy permeates. The playing has a lighter touch that keeps
it floating along even as the piano picks up in intensity and slight bluesy
figures drift through the atmosphere. My favorite is the classic It Might as
Well Be Spring which closes the album. Played on clarinet, the melody is
rendered with all it's fragile joy and swing intact.

Gentle, but with a tenaciousness, this recording is the most
consistent. However, all three albums contain different atmospheric and
textural qualities and are high quality recordings of an utterly professional
and accomplished group.
