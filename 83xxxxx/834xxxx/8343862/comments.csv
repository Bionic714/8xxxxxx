[V],Nepotu,2013-04-05T16:30Z,Good day! I have only the game 2 (from april 3rd)
,drew1972,2013-04-05T16:50Z,Darn.  Would it get on your nerves if I ask for a couple MLB games per week during the course of the season?
[V],Nepotu,2013-04-05T21:00Z,You can ask me for any game you'd like and I'll try to bring it to you. No promises.
