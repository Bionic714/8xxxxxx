[V],HeroMaster,2013-04-05T10:32Z,ENJOY ENJOY New Update 2 of Resident Evil 6 MULTi by Gameworks!
,Nachorz,2013-04-05T10:51Z,Is this the recent update released today? Does it also include the Left 4 Dead 2 characters for Mercenary mode?
,TheDragonReborn26,2013-04-05T12:35Z,What's the point if Agent Hunt mode is only online? Or will people use tunngle and such things for it?
,cesc1250,2013-04-06T19:47Z,"Donwloading, hope this version doesn't have a Trojan like the stiffmeister one :)"
,schnorrer0,2013-04-08T07:05Z,"Hi Heromaster, sorry for the newbie question...If I apply your v1 & 2, will the online feature work via steam? or should I still need to put a crack on my Steam Client before your RE6 online feature to work?? Thanks in advance!"
,schnorrer0,2013-04-08T07:08Z,"I understand that you put this note:

Update Version: 1.0.2.134 ( Update 2 )
Version Required: ( Steam-Rip & RELOADED )
Tablet: Not Required

But I just want to be sure...."
,schnorrer0,2013-04-08T08:34Z,"shit!!! I should've downloaded your steamrip (16G)  if I want the online feature to work...Instead, I downloaded the reloaded...anyways, I'll find a way to fix the online feature on my RE6 reloaded...Thanks a lot heromaster"
,Barrytoo,2013-04-08T22:15Z,"After a fresh install of the game & then applying this update I get a fatal error: ""Failed to initialize Steam"".
Anyone with ideas here?"
