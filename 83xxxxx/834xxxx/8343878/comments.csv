This upload is missing some parts. 
From part 104 (just starting Franklin Pierce) it jumps in part 105 to Lincoln milestones.
So it's missing the rest of Franklin Pierce, all of James Buchanan and pretty well all of Lincoln's presidency.
Any way these can be found and put up as a extra torrent?
Many thanks again."
