Visual Studio 2012 Update 2 (KB2707250)
=======================================

Tired with Microsoft using web installers which are unreliable, don't support
pause/resume.

* The update is an ISO format (it's inside the .7z file (I have a shitty internet))
* You can extract using : http://www.7-zip.org/download.html
* The update is untouched.
* You can create your own update using VS2012.2.exe /layout
