Owner Mike Ballard and a full cast of characters race against the clock to serve huge crowds at the Full Throttle Saloon, which is only open for 10 days a year in August during the annual Sturgis Motorcycle Rally. More than 300,000 people visit the Full Throttle during the annual event, where Ballard and his team are pressured to make a year's salary in a short time window, all while providing patrons an experience they will not forget.
