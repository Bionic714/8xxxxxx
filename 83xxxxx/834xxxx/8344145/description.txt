Ep 5: Not Cheap, Chic

PREMIERE: Wednesday April 3, 10:30 pm
 
Cameron jets off to New York City to shop at an acclaimed vintage mart, hoping to add new treasures to the Decades inventory. While penny-pincher Christos has given him a budget, CameronΓÇÖs far more interested in finding hidden gems then sticking to the bottom line. Back in L.A., Christos dives into the closet of actress Monet Mazur in hopes of consigning some amazing pieces for the store.
