                  26 years after a fatal accident in Chernobyl Nuclear
                  Power Plant that covered half of the Europe in clouds
                  of radioactive smoke, a large group of terrorists took
                  over the area, trying to steal all the remaining
                  radioactive waste - and use it.
                  This is a no-frills, old style, gun-blazing and
                  explosion-roaring attack against multitude of enemies.
                  Hit them hard where it hurts and become a legend for
                  generations to come!
