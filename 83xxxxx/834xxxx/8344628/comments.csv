,ut1880h,2013-04-07T14:21Z,"Thanks for sharing. And thanks for taking the time and making the effort required to ""do it right"". Doing it right is what it's all about. 

BTW - This book is a strange weaving. In one direction is woven some very interesting, quite handy, and even practical things to consider regarding our interaction with others. However, in the other direction is woven a manual on how to be a selfish asshole. Hopefully, the listener will not be misled into the erroneous belief that manipulating other people is really a goal to be pursued by anyone other than a fucking doosh. But just the same, be wise. Wisdom is more powerful than self-centered trickery.  "

LOL Yeah, pretty much. I read this book years ago. A compilation of the military strategies and political maneuverings and social manipulations by writers like Sun-Tzu and Machiavelli. Look in the business section and you will find tons of these types of books. Basically, HOW TO guides to fucking everyone in your way. Don't mind the ruined lives, career death and destruction that you created, just focus on your goal and think happy thoughts.

If you ever want to read  the ultimate books on lying, manipulation and mind fucking...read anything by Frank Luntz, a political strategist for the Republicans. 

Examples of his logic - 
Don't call it oil spill, call it environmental alteration. 
Don't call it cheating on your wife, call it unauthorized bedroom adventures.

Yep, a lot of that going on.  Reminds me of something I read about a lawyer interviewing a witness.  It goes like this:

The witness is the Doctor...
ATTORNEY: Doctor, before you performed the autopsy, did you check for a pulse?
WITNESS: No.
ATTORNEY: Did you check for blood pressure?
WITNESS: No.
ATTORNEY: Did you check for breathing?
WITNESS: No..
ATTORNEY: So, then it is possible that the patient was alive when you began the
autopsy?
WITNESS: No.
ATTORNEY: How can you be so sure, Doctor?
WITNESS: Because his brain was sitting on my desk in a jar.
ATTORNEY: How can you be sure the brain in the jar was his?
WITNESS: Because the jar was Delivered by Private Courier and the labeled said it was
his brain!
ATTORNEY: I see, but could the patient have still been alive, nevertheless?
WITNESS: Yes, it is possible that he could have been alive and practicing law."
,ps2779,2013-04-17T11:44Z,"Great Example of Political Spin:

'Remus Reid, horse thief, sent to Montana Territorial Prison 1885, escaped 1887, robbed the Montana Flyer six times. Caught by Pinkerton detectives, convicted and hanged in 1889.'


A Senator's Spin on this relative:

'Remus Reid was a famous cowboy in the Montana Territory . His business empire grew to include acquisition of valuable equestrian assets and intimate dealings with the Montana railroad. Beginning in 1885, he devoted several years of his life to government service, finally taking leave to resume his dealings with the railroad. In 1887, he was a key player in a vital investigation run by the renowned Pinkerton Detective Agency. In 1889, Remus passed away during an important civic function held in his honor when the platform upon which he was standing collapsed.'"
