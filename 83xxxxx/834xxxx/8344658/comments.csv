,digigod,2013-04-07T05:51Z,Are these hard subs?
,anacondon,2013-04-10T22:31Z,"Separate 'srt' subs file.  Watched the In the House 2012 SUBBED DVDRip x264-PLAYNOW version last nite and subs were embedded on film.  Horrible translation which makes for an infuriating viewing experience.  D/L'g this one now, quality is excellent & quick scanned thru the srt file and they're far FAR better translation which means everything with a 'clever' and dialog-driven movie such as this.  Highly recommend this film, absolutely brilliant (and can't wait to watch again with PROPER subs).  Thanks for the upload!"
