Grotesque Tactics combines the features and cliche?s of Western and Asian console role playing games (such as Fire Emblem, Final Fantasy Tactics) and provides an highly addicting and entertaining change to the current more serious role playing titles. To protect the kingdom from the merciless cult ΓÇ£The Dark ChurchΓÇ¥ which has murdered all heroes and knights you will have to hire dubious soldiers ΓÇô and rescue jealous maidens who will follow you into combat as your groupies. Up to 10 heroes are deployed in tactical battles to take on the Dark Church with their special abilities. 
The developers of Grotesque Tactics are deeply focused to bring across the fascination of the Strategy RPG genre known through more serious titles such as Heroes of Might and Magic, Jagged Alliance or KingΓÇÖs Bounty.
On the side Grotesque Tactics throws a lot of dialogues and a grand story in your face mimicking the whole RPG genre in a most humorous way including numerous side blows towards Oblivion, Final Fantasy or Lord of the Rings. Grotesque Tactics is funny with a great plot and gives you a tactical challenge to remember.

*In chess, a Grotesque is a problem or endgame study which features a particularly unlikely initial position, especially one in which White fights with a very small force against a much larger black army. Grotesques are generally intended to be humorous.
