On Request: I was a bit hasty, so the earlier torrent with some corrections:

Every month I could find enough songs to make an I1 Indie Playlist (Extreme HQ). Not this month. I had hoped to open with Lifeforms from Daughter. Music that whispers how we can learn to really love. Its an I3 List now (lower sound quality).

However, this does not mean that the playlists are less then other months. In the contrary, all five playlists I2 Rock, I3 Pop / Folk and I5 Electronic, are simply awesome.

Enjoy,
