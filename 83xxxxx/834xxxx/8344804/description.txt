"Spirit Science is a video series starring Patchman, who takes you on a journey into the unknown as we look at many basics of what it means to be spiritual. Chakras, Thoughts, Sacred Geometry, and even Atlantis, in Spirit Science we look at and discuss many of these topics.

Most people donΓÇÖt realize that thereΓÇÖs actually a very powerful connection between Spirituality and Science. The entire field of science and philosophy is slowly coming full circle in understanding the cosmic connection between all things. All of the atoms, particles, plants, animals, humans, planets, stars, and galaxies, all work in the same fundamental geometric structures that shape all of the universe! There are so many deep mysteries that lay hidden in our world, and we are discovering what all of them truly mean."
