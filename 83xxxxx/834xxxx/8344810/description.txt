Nihongo So- Matome Series (μùÑμ£¼Φ¬₧τ╖Åπü╛πü¿πéü), or the JLPT books with the animals on the covers, is a great series of books that does an incredible job of breaking up the grammar into easily digestible sections that contain related grammar.  The explanations are in English as well as Japanese and offer several example sentences.  The book is divided into so many weeks and with in those weeks 7 days.  Each page is a day that includes new grammar along with 7 test questions.  At the end of the week (or the 7th page of that section) you will be given a review test of the grammar you learned that week.

The Nihongo So- Matome Series makes books for every level of the JLPT and for every portion of the test:

Kanji
Vocabulary
Grammar
Reading
Listening
 

Overall a great tool to have help prepare you for the JLPT and learn proper Japanese.  If the practice questions were a bit more difficult  than this would be perfect.
