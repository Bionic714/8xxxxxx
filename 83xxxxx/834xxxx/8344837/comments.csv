Click on the ""Files"" link above and you'll see.  I am going to make a guess that they should be PDF files, so if I can get one to complete I'll will test that idea and report back."
[H],LemonJ-Lo,2013-04-05T17:51Z,"They aren't PDF, epub, or mobi.

I'm killing all my downloads because it isn't worth wasting the bandwidth to download crap or worse, malware disguised as something useful.

When the poster gets his anonymous act together and figures out how to post, I'll give it another try."
