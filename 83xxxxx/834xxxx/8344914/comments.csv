,BigFatAlpha,2013-04-06T01:45Z,Seeders would be nice (0 seeders / 122@0%)!!!
,darthdeath666,2013-04-06T12:07Z,"As i always say: Be patient. Can only seed at certain hours. No need to rush up, better when it takes its time. :-)"
,Metthos,2013-04-06T19:58Z,"Thanks dude,"
,snake4445,2013-04-06T23:54Z,"Many thanks DD666.  Stuck at 70.4%, but plan to leave my computer on all night.  Seed baby seed!!"
,aarque,2013-04-07T04:20Z,"NO WAY. First SnakEye brought us Antartica and now you give up Kamchatka. The scenery is a massive coverage area of a very remote region, east of Russia and north of Japan. It's a place where the Soviets would test new weapons and United States congressmen die when their Korean Airlines 747 is shot down by a Russian jet.
Frikkin sickness and I never expected to find this rare gem at TPB, thought fo rsure I was going to have to spring for it, so, ""thanks"" to say the least."
,DJiF,2013-04-07T10:45Z,"gentlemen, kindly asking you: if somebody has downloaded all of it, please, keep seeding for some time. the speed is zero. thank you."
,mitsoswutang,2013-04-13T14:37Z,"If you keep haveing problems with download speed, change your port number in u-torrent program."
,tornade25,2013-04-19T16:14Z,"Great scenery, thank you darthdeath666 !
