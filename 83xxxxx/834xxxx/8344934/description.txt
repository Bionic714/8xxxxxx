This torrent contains all cutscenes from the Playstation 2 game "Xenosaga Episode III: Also Sprach Zarathustra" in HD (1080p). This is the source material I uploaded to YouTube. More info in readme.txt inside the torrent. You can find all of these videos on my YouTube channel (Helsionium). Part 1 covers chapters 1 to 6, part 2 covers chapters 7 to 10.

Please select only the cutscenes you're interested in - I can upload at a maximum rate of 500 KB/s. All files are compressed with WinRAR - note that the files are much larger when uncompressed - on average they're about 3.5 times the compressed size.

A short explanation of the file names (e.g. 005RE.rar):

005 - number of the cutscene as on YouTube (001-345)
1st letter: R (regular outfits) / S (swimsuits) / X (only one version exists)
2nd letter: E (English voices) / J (Japanese voices) / X (no voice acting)
