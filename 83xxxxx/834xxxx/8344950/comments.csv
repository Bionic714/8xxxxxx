,eightyth_attempt2register,2013-04-10T06:24Z,Narutoget always covers its images in spammy watermarks.  I recommend to get an MKV subbed version (only MKV lets you turn subtitles off) and then get one of these site's spammed up video and play their English audio with a clean subbed MKV.

Q-2 Did you chech files From 167 - 175 ??
