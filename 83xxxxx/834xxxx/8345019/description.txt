An amazing but true story about an experimental dub session organized 
by BOB MARLEY in Jamaica in 1979!!!

In 1979 during a visit to Japan, Bob Marley met the 
acclaimed Japanese percussionist Pecker. Pecker, a big fan of reggae, 
convinced Marley to bring top Japanese musicians 
(mostly members of The Yellow Magic Orchestra) to Jamaica to mix it up 
with the cream of Jamaican reggae artists, to jam and play out in informal 
dub sessions at both Channel One and Tuff Gong Studios. The astounding results 
were released only in Japan on two separate LP's in 1980.
