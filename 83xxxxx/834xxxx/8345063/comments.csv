Would you consider doing a pack for weekly IDW comics as well? I am still looking for the latest GI Joe comics. "
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-06T17:28Z,not at this time -- i'm still a little concerned about my internet bill -- but hey maybe someone else would?

i will also include it with next week's image releases."

Thanks for the up"
