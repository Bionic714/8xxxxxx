,Realhater,2013-04-05T18:09Z,Dude thank you. I've been waiting for this. My steam version won't update because of some error and keeps trying to re-download the game.
,BeastWagon,2013-04-06T01:21Z,When will we see a GUTS release? Is it even possible?
,raymund14,2013-04-06T12:33Z,will this version be compatible with the latest synergiesMOD? :)
,raymund14,2013-04-06T12:34Z,where could I get the modlauncher?
,Realhater,2013-04-06T12:36Z,Thought this update would have GUTS built in or something. Does that mean we'll have to wait for a GUTS release? 
,siradein,2013-04-06T21:33Z,"If you don't mind going to a bit of trouble, I found a quick way to get GUTS for this update.  Download the demo from the runic games site. Install it. Hit play and let it update.  Once all updates are done, exit launcher and go to the location you installed the demo to.  Pull the 'DataEditor' and Mod Launcher.exe files and paste them to your pirated game folder.  Now you can just run the mod launcher and play your downloaded mods."
,siradein,2013-04-06T21:36Z,"Also the Editor.exe, if you want it"
,Goosifur,2013-04-07T02:29Z,Is there a way to play with GUTS mods with this update?
,PUTOgenic,2013-04-07T12:53Z,can someone upload the modlauncher pls?
