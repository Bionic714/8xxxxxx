Walking Tall 2004 BDRemux MPEG DTS multisub HighCode- PHD

When a former member of the U.S. Army Special Forces returns to his small hometown in rural Washington State 
hoping to realise a childhood dream of working in the local lumber mill, he discovers that much has changed, 
as the normally tranquil town is now besieged by drugs, outbreaks of violence and a general feeling of malaise and terror, 
with many pointing a finger at the influence of a crooked casino where his ex-girlfriend now works as a dancer. 
Seeking to wreak vengeance, with a four-foot-long 4-by-4 in his hand, and righteousness in his heart, the highly-trained soldier, 
now the county's sheriff, and his deputy, realizes it's time to bust some heads with a very hard piece of wood.
