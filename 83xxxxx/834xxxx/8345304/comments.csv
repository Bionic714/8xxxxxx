I am impressed with the quality of your uploads. They are superb.
Sir, I am new to TPB and want to upload a few of my torrents. The thing I want to know is whether the TPB pays money to its uploader like other sharing sites like rapidshare etc. 
PLEASE respond!
Thanks"
,chop007,2013-04-05T21:42Z,"Hey bro, I just saw your question, I think TPB relies on donations and as a group of hackers I think some get paid through adds, donations etc, but I do not think people get paid to crack, that would be defeating the purpose of freedom of knowledge. I think they should though, fighting the system is not easy and when the CIA,FBI,NSA come knocking, one needs lots of cash to buy them off."
,ZmisiS,2013-04-05T22:47Z,This is fine. Thanks.

Thanks brother! Have a good day!"

that information in notepad was helpful, without that I can't install. keep sharing cool things :D
and Is that keygen harmful for computer now? I gues maybe. Malware bytes caught it but I didn't remove until I installed idm. thanks for uploading idm it."
