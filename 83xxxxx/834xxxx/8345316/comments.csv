,Calel1234,2013-04-05T19:03Z,"I actually totally forgot about this series. I hope there is a 5, since I hate inconclusive comic series.

Btw, do you know what happened to America's got Powers #6? "
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-05T19:18Z,"yes Calel1234, i know what happened. the habitually late bryan hitch is its artist.  ;-)

seriously, i suspect he stopped drawing it as marvel was probably pressuring him to get age of ultron done. which he didn't get done, and he's now been replaced with two b-list artists for the final issues.

the image website says #6 is shipping TBD (to be determined). it will probably come out later this spring. by the way, it's now added another issue to the miniseries so expect to wait another 3-6 months for the conclusion in #7!"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-05T19:20Z,"and by the way comics fans, carrie kelley from dark knight returns is the next robin."
,tdurden83,2013-04-05T20:39Z,"that's some funny shit, I wondered what the hell was going on. thx for the up stf"
,1337irl,2013-04-05T21:20Z,Thanks for the insight.... Another great upload.
,dandadestroyer,2013-04-05T21:53Z,What do you expect?They're Robins..they never last.Still weird that Bruce keeps recruiting teens.He really can't get it that they KEEP DYING.Tsk Tsk
,comawhite2008,2013-04-05T22:22Z,Great series. Do you or know where I can find the series Nth Man: The Ultimate Ninja?
,tdurden83,2013-04-05T22:44Z,don't really understand the need myself. they ought to at least kill off 5 or 6 of the robins they already have before bringing on more.
,riverchase,2013-04-06T02:18Z,just a question. Have you heard of a series called Troublemakers. I would love to read the entire run.
,Calel1234,2013-04-06T02:22Z,"I really, really liked Damian as the last Robin... Idk why they had to kill him off to make a new Robin. Makes me think it was for political/social reasons that they picked a girl rather than best interest of the storyline. "
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-06T02:24Z,"i guess he needs somebody to yell at, other than alfred  ;-)

the new 52 should have eliminated tim and jason, if they were keeping nightwing and damian. just too many supporting characters, imho."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-06T02:27Z,"troublemakers can be found here http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7833326/  , along with all the other acclaim comics titles. check out quantum & woody if you want another good one! it's soon to be relaunched at the new valiant."
,riverchase,2013-04-06T03:49Z,again thank you. you and the other uploaders have helped us too many times and we all appreciate it
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-06T04:25Z,you're very welcome riverchase. thanks for saying thanks.
,tdurden83,2013-04-06T04:36Z,"having only nightwing and damian would've been ideal. instead, not only is there going to be yet another robin character added to the mix, once damian inevitably gets dunked in a lazarus pit we'll have one more than we even started with "
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-06T05:13Z,"comawhite2008, when i can get all the issues to finish downloading, i'll post a torrent of the complete nth man"
,comawhite2008,2013-04-06T06:57Z,Much appreciated.  :)
,riverchase,2013-04-06T12:12Z,im getting really bad speed for the acclaim/valiant upload im not even at 50 percent yet
,kakuichi1,2013-04-06T14:56Z,"I was reading these the other day; thanks for the ULs!  But, here's a link to the marvel website that shows the covers to issues 5-8:

[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-07T04:55Z,"did that ever finish for you, riverchase?"
,DreamingFar,2013-04-07T15:12Z,"Actually, I think Tomasi kind of hinted that Carrie's not actually the new Robin."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-08T14:18Z,"peter said she may not be, especially in his follow-up interview with the post. however, bear in mind that tim drake wasn't robin for half a year in the batman comic, either... "
