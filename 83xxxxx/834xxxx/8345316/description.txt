Sometime during the Crisis on Infinite Comments that TPB had this week, kakuichi1 was asking me about this series. With no idea whether he/she saw my response(s), I thought it would be good to torrent the issues published so far, particularly since a new issue is ALLEGEDLY coming out soon!

Marvel.com claims the following:
Brilliant (2011) #5
Published: April 17, 2013
Albert gets the group back together so they can find a way to save Maria before what happened to Amadeus happens to her.

kakuichi1, although some sites haven't been updated, this series has been shipping embarassingly late. There was a 6-month gap between #1 and 2, then 3 months until #3, then 4 until #4 came out. IF MAYBE POSSIBLE #5 actually hits the shelves this month, it will have been the longest delay yet (8 months).

None of that would really matter if it sucked, but Brilliant is (in my opinion) really quite good.
