[V],2010kaiser,2013-04-09T07:15Z,"@archerduchess

There's no keylogger or any other Malware in this torrent. The Adobe Tool v3.4 is giving you a false positive."

,d3monsweat,2013-04-12T21:08Z,Easy install and works like a charm.  Thanks dude.
,deathstalker82,2013-04-13T04:33Z,"Thanks for the upload. Very easy install and works beautifully. One question, I noticed that its a trial version. So after the 30 days will I have to re-install? If so not a problem since the install is super easy. Thanks again for upload."
[V],2010kaiser,2013-04-13T13:06Z,"@deathstalker82

If you followed the installation instructions EXACTLY, the trial will be frozen and there'll never be a need for a re-install. If the trial continues to count down, then you've missed something at some point during the install and you'll need to do a re-install. Watch the video provided in the installer for the correct procedure to install.
If you do need to re-install. Once you've removed the current install of Photoshop. Go to:

C:Program Files (x86)Common FilesAdobe

or/and

C:Program FilesCommon FilesAdobe

Highlight all the folders and delete them. For those which you can't delete. Just skip them.If you don't do this step after the uninstall and before the re-install. Your fresh install of Photoshop will not be ""frozen"" and will count down like the previous install."
,deathstalker82,2013-04-13T14:39Z,Cool man. Thanks for the quick reply. I followed it to a T so I should be good. If not its no biggie and I can always fix it later.
,torrent_fan1001,2013-04-19T23:56Z,question...what is this torrent and do you need anything to download and use it.. sorry i'm kinda' clueless 
[V],2010kaiser,2013-04-20T02:03Z,"@torrent_fan1001

All you need is a torrent client to download the torrent. Download and install uTorrent from the link below. Everything else is contained in the downloaded installer:

[V],2010kaiser,2013-04-24T20:57Z,"@abdou_dz

1. Disconnect your internet, open photoshop and select update (It won't/can't update because your internet is disconnected).
2. Close photoshop but leave the update window open.
3. Re-connect your internet and you can now download all updates.
4. If trial starts again, just re-patch the amtlib.dll files.

5. You can also download updates direct from Adobe and install them that way."

,Arwen0001,2013-05-06T07:47Z,"@AnySecond: You have to run it as it is. If it doesnt work I would guess your security is blocking it, or your download is corrupted. You should get a startupscreen.

[V],2010kaiser,2013-05-06T18:48Z,"@AnySecond

Arwen0001 is correct. Your A/V is probably reading the installer as Malware and not allowing it to run. Disable your A/V for the whole process and make sure you run the installer as Administrator. I can guarantee than it's 100% safe as i packaged and compiled it myself.
Also, NONE of my torrents will ever be password protected in any way nor have they ever been. If you come up against the same issue on one of my torrents again. Disable your A/V and make sure you are running it as Administrator.

,cyborg05,2013-05-14T08:41Z,After downloading this what should be done? Should I watched the video first? Or I can just install it easily.? 
[V],2010kaiser,2013-05-14T15:54Z,"@cyborg05

Options:

1. Watch the video to see how the application is installed correctly and then install the application.
2. Get someone who knows what they're doing to install it for you.
3. Stare at the downloaded torrent in the hope that it is an auto-installer and will install itself, making you a cup of coffee as part of the process :-)

Personally, i'd go with option 1 ;-)"

,PeaceMaker22,2013-06-08T23:43Z,"It seems to have worked. A couple minor things I ran into (besides missing text in instructions) was when I went to continue trial, I couldn't click it and it was grayed out.  It said 00 days on the left. That's probably because I had it previously on trial. Another thing is I was thinking, ""Watch this get deleted because I didn't turn off my Norton360.."" Yup.. I had to re-download it because Norton killed it after I started the exe. It says thousands of Norton users used it though and it was released a couple months ago, which seems about right. Turned off antivirus temporarily and put the file on exceptions to be sure and took it off exceptions after I was finished. Besides that it all worked and took about 5-10 minutes to install. I'll message back if something in the future goes wrong. Thanx for upload ~"

And to anyone else who's had a previous install.
Uninstall/delete your previous version.
Then delete it from the CommonFiles directory. Normally located at:

x64bit:
=====

C-Program Files (x86)-Common Files-Adobe

x86(x32bit):
========

C-Program Files (x86)-Common Files-Adobe

Skip what can't be deleted.

Then do a re-install of the software."
