Among the exquisite pieces of glass in Robert Lehman's collection are many that exhibit the consummate skill of Venetian glassmakers and explain why Venetian glass was so coveted in Europe in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The factories in northern Europe that produced glass a la fa√ßon de Venise are represented as well. Robert Lehman also acquired perhaps the richest American collection of eighteenth-century lampworked glass figurines, which are usually attributed to Nevers, France. Smaller groups of reverse-painted panels and ancient Roman and early Islamic glass round out the 136 objects catalogued in this volume.
