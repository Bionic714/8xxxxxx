When i open the ""datafiles"" in the launcher, i can´t see the files, although i can see them in the datafolder in the install directory. I have the Reloaded version. Any ideas?

Cheers"

I thought I had fixed this!
Do the following:
1. Press WinKey+R and type regedit and hit enter to open the registry editor
2. Go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SOFTWARE/Bethesda Softworks/Skyrim. If you're on a 64bit machine it will be HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SOFTWARE/WOW6432Node/Bethesda Softworks/Skyrim
3. Add a slash (/) to the end of the Installed Path key"
