        Volbeat have established their own genre with their music,
        and with their fifth album "Outlaw gentlemen & shady ladies
        they follow the rules and road they set up in 2000 straight
        like an arrow. This time, though, the Poulsen gang has added
        some extra weight - the tracks are laden with even more
        diversity, deepness, and clout. 'Room 24', for example, is
        an epic and dark song featuring the mighty King Diamond at
        the mike - although he usually tries to avoid
        collaborations. But there's a light side, too: 'Pearl hart'
        is a smasher, airy, joyful, and a contender for a "best
        summer song 2013" competition... 'Black bart' is its
        counterweight: one of the heaviest songs ever written by
        Volbeat, but still being a perfect part of the track
        package. "Outlaw gentlemen & shady ladies" impresses with
        its homogeneity and compactness - how do they manage to
        repeating themselves... Hats (or Stetsons) off to the Danes
        this one hits the bull's eye, again.
