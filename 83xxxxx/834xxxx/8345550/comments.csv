If you have done it once the steam_api.dll has been caught from you virus program as a trojan and probably deleted. What you have to do is make an exception for those files when you copy them over. What I did is first make the whole mounted drive an exception, then the whole Aoe install folder an exception. Then, after I had copied over the files from the crack file on the mounted disc I made only the steam_api.dll an exception and deleted the two other exceptions (so the defense from the virus-program is not weakened).

All you people using still using XP. that operating system was released 12 years ago (2001) and support will end April 2014.  No more security updates!  Perhaps the biggest problem with XP is that it cannot utilize more than 3gb of RAM, and this cap includes the memory on you video card as well as system RAM.  If you've gotten a new PC with 4GB+ ram, 64 bit processor and still decided to put good ole windows XP 32 bit on it because you're afraid of change....you should rethink your decision!  Also, didn't Dad take Vista out back behind the barn and shoot it a few years ago?  Get 7 while you can..you'll need it to survive past 8 and possibly whatever comes after Dad takes 8 out back behind the barn.  7 is the new XP!"

The trojan isn't a real virus, your antivirus is incapable of telling the difference. in order to use the file add it to the acceptance list, if you're too much of a bitch to do that cuz you're scared, then dont download, don't install, delete it and don't complain about downloading shit illegally again, cuz, its obviously at your own risk you sour tarts"
,skillzorz,2013-04-19T02:07Z,"Shadow416: Calm down there, buddy! How can you be so mad at someone for making the most common mistake in torrenting/warez? Everyone who knows something was once a beginner. You should either ignore it altogether, or make this place better for everyone by explaining the confusion. No one is going to believe someone who is insulting them as much as possible. Their antivirus told them it was a trojan, and they don't have any other information. It seems, for them, to make sense to warn other people. They are trying to help (except for some, who are like you, and insult others.)

To anyone who may be new: If you aren't extremely familiar with the technology you are using, try not to make assumptions. Ask questions instead of getting a small piece of information from somewhere (like your antivirus program) and then acting on it as if there were no chance of it being false information.

Due to the way the software is modified for distribution like this, antivirus programs often mistake it for a threat. If you have any doubts, read comments and use your best judgement."

Just because AoE HD is shit doesn't mean it wont get a bunch of downloads---and i didn't say the game itself was shit i said the HD REMAKE was shit, and it was, removed LAN, upscaled the resolution and made the water prettier...now tell me how that makes the game an HD Remake?

I'm an asshole, but im actually quite helpful if people ask. I don't appreciate people who bash the uploader for their own stupidity. If they're concerned about a virus say it, someone will tellem, if they're going to be a dick about it, i or someone will be a dick back."

,1-mitke,2013-05-14T10:00Z,"i've downloaded this game to enjoy bigger resolutions, but i can't even choose what resolution i want to play on! and it's only AOK, not AOC included. so, i downloaded ""age of empires 2: forgotten empires"" and got a lot of new features such as resolution menu, new civilizations and bunch of bugfixes. also, this torrent has 2000+ seeders, but download speed is terrible (under 100KB/s). my advice is to search for forgotten empires and enjoy all campaings in any resolution you choose. cheers!"

,Balian67,2013-05-15T10:25Z,"@NZ_Gamer: I had the SAME exact problem. I changed permissions on all sorts of stuff...I disabled AVG and everything. What I did to fix it: Uninstalled Microsoft Security Essentials. Then it copied and pasted just fine! Try that. :)

By the way, some have said the graphics still look like $hit, well what do you expect from a game that game out about 15 years ago. I have a laptop with a 1920x1080 on a 15in screen and it is still low textures but it looks decent on my screen.

Would I pay 20 dollars for a re-release of this in the HD version...No...why, when I can just play the old non HD version I already own for FREE. That I bought YEARS ago for 20 bucks. That is so stupid."
,josef256,2013-05-15T21:24Z,"how to play on Xp :
1)dl steam and green luma( last version)
2)download and copie the multiplayer crackfix
3)download and copie the v2.3 patch (do not copy the .dll file)

I don't use antivirus since 2010, Im playing this since it was released and my computer is fine. Stop bitching about virus, if u dont like, dont download. pussies"

,Synixtrix,2013-05-22T04:59Z,"@ Hilterism
Ignorance must have taken root in your skull and drained your intellect.
Your comment -
 ""You RELOADED/Mr. Stifmeister stupid fucking twat! steam_api.dll is a fucking trojan, you wanna put your stupid little eavesdropping app to all the seeders? Fuck your mom very much, thanks!""
Oh my my my, what an angry little fellow you are.
---Hitlerism..... you should not be anywhere near TPB and Pirated software, your failure to grasp what is a fundamental of cracked software and cracks in general has me shaking my head in sheer disbelief.
You need to pull your head back into your trailer and get back to the crack-whore piece of white-trash that is your wife/daughter (I hear they are 1 and the same in your neighbourhood).
Maybe she can crack your skull with a bat to improve your IQ."
,elim420,2013-05-26T05:21Z,"Hi, everytime I try to play the game it tells me "" this is not the .exe you are looking for."" but this is the only exe there is in the game file... help me please I am new to steam hacks"

PSSSSSSSSSSTT!!!!! Not really a virus geniuses!

Anti-virus programs are for 55 year old technological luddites and cave-dwellers too stupid to not know hot to browse the god damned internet by this point. Get a clue, dumb-asses."
,4seed2u,2013-05-29T13:38Z,"Do not download this and it has Trojan . If you are not taking it seriously I will tell what happen to me. As I was playing the internet setting (network settings ) are automatically changed to some ip address and I can only fix after a reboot.
I was not serious about this Trojan and I excluded that file in antivirus now I know I should not done that. "
,romasworld,2013-05-29T14:45Z," I downloaded this and installed as instructed. But, every time that I try to start the game it opens my steam account and that's it. Suggestions? "

,Dreadhawk123177,2013-06-03T21:06Z,"Firstly, this CANNOT be played through LAN. They took it out and used Steam instead. Secondly, I feel that the pirating of this game is completely justified. I paid for 2 of the original games ($50 total) and refuse to pay $20 more for a freaking patch. The quality of the ""game"" itself is okay. They made some nice changes, mainly things that were easily done (bigger pop. limit, can select more units, etc.)."
,med_stud,2013-06-04T10:55Z,"Trojan detected: steam_api.dll

Judging from the comments here: multiple virus scanners have judged this to be a trojan horse.
The creator of this torrent claims that it is not (how surprising...)

I, however,  tend to trust a whole bunch of internet security experts more than some anonymous bloody twat on the web that calls hiself ""Mr.Stifmeister"".

Luckily, this guy is so fucking dump that a goat could outwit him: he chose a trojan horse that's detected by every virus scanner in the universe.  

...this guy is the Homer Simpson of the hacker world......Kinda makes me laugh....=)

My recommendation would be not to download this file. Take care everyone! Big hugs! ;-)"
,Gorak_Khul,2013-06-04T21:41Z,"med_stud It seems obvious that you, my friend, are trying so hard to understand what you can't.
steam_app.dll is detected as a ""trojan"" because it's a file that overwrites and modifies the behavior of the original steam_app.dll, which of course is detected as a thread by AV/AS's.

If this isn't your first time downloading a game, you should know somethig that simple. But if it is, welcome to internet, friend."
