,popeye707,2013-04-11T21:32Z,"@imstevep you have to type the first part of the code(before the dash) in the first box, and the second part(after the dash) in the second box."
,imstevep,2013-04-11T22:30Z,"Hi Popeye707, thanks for taking the time to reply..but its this part I am having the problem with...
Copy/paste all 11 authentication blocks in the keymaker (request field)
   (66 digits, no spaces,dashes,...)
Thanks for your help..stevep"
,sregnov,2013-04-18T19:24Z,where are the materials at? installs great. 
,imstevep,2013-04-19T15:51Z,"Hi sregnov how did you Copy/paste all 11 authentication blocks in the keymaker (request field)
(66 digits, no spaces,dashes,...) I can only paste about 7 of them and no more
any help would be much appreciated"
,imstevep,2013-04-21T01:37Z,Sorted !!..it seems the keygen only works to insert all of the 66 digits in win xp ( I have it installed on Win 7 ).. so I opened the keygen in my old xp laptop and just copied the serials etc to my manga 5 registration in windows7..
,xyl0phyt4,2013-05-05T21:21Z,"I can't paste the long authentication code fully either. The entry box in the x-force gen only allows about 5 of them before it ""runs out of room"" and won't allow any more characters to be entered. Please assist! There are no ""dashes"" in the request box either. So I have no idea what you're referencing other users to in the comments. Thank you."
,xyl0phyt4,2013-05-05T21:23Z,"By '5 of them' I meant 5 of the 11 blocks of code that manga studio generates when you are trying to manually activate your license, and you've given it a serial."
,xyl0phyt4,2013-05-05T21:26Z,"And, like imstevep, I am running Win7. But unlike imstevep, I don't have access to XP to solve this bug. :/ Sorry I kept having to add info so there are 3 separate comments. Hah. Thanks for any help."
,GRhapsodos,2013-05-09T03:01Z,"So has anyone figured this out for Win7? I'm DLing now and if I can't get the keygen to work it'll kind of be a waste of time... Without seeing it yet I don't know, but has anyone tried to copy/paste to something like notepad then copy the whole 66 characters?"
,greeeey,2013-05-12T03:30Z,Keygen works fine for me and I'm on Win7...
,jhamil53,2013-05-15T08:42Z,"I was having the same problem as everyone else on my Windows 8 desktop. I couldn't paste all 11 parts, only 5 (or 7 if no caps WTF??) But it worked on my Windows 8 laptop AND my Mac, so I would recommend copying the keygen to another computer and trying it that way. Good luck everyone!"
