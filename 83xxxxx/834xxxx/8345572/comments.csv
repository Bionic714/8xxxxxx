,buenio,2013-04-06T04:49Z,JUDAS I'm waiting for your Fast and Furious 4 2009 and Fast Five i want to replace yify's rip
[V],dhjudasx,2013-04-06T08:00Z,"working on it... 4 and 5 are prepped.. but i'm away all weekend for business...

I might be able to slip the 4th in sometime though. we'll see.


in regards to ""pissed off""... i'm not pissed off.. in fact i'm far from that... but i'm not going to upload games, there are plenty of games already provided by others... I don't have max payne nor do I want it...

I'm working on blurays only... I believe this is the 5th time you've repeatedly asked for or about max payne."
,joser116,2013-04-06T19:31Z,Thank you for the great encodes. I just have one question. Why do you sometimes do 1920x816 and sometimes 1920x1080? 
[V],dhjudasx,2013-04-07T08:55Z,"Because of the aspect ratio..

Rarely are any movies encoded at anything above 800/816 because the movies are presented in letterbox widescreen.

There is no point... actually it is counter productive to encode a movie with those giagantic BLACK bars above and below the actual film.

A few movies actually use 1920x1040..

As I said, it's rather still rare for any movie to be available @ 1920x1080.

Trust me you aren't missing anything. If anything, you are gaining BETTER quality video at a smaller file size."

[V],dhjudasx,2013-05-09T19:38Z,"there is 120+ seeders seeding.. I look and everything seems to be seeding at the fastest rate as it is.

I personally can't see much and hope others seed for me because my limited 58kbps connection is .. well... not ideal for it lol"
