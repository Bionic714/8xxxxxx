,FredLeGrand,2013-04-05T22:16Z,Having issues running the game. Asking me to have steam running. I properly copied cracked content.
,Sensej,2013-04-05T22:50Z,I have the same problem ... it doesn't work for me.

,ferothul,2013-04-06T03:15Z,"Just to be blatantly clear for people, this is what I had to do to get this to work:

1. Download this torrent.
2. Run the setup.
3. Go into the game directory you installed it to, usually Steam/Steamapps/common/Sang-Froid Tales of Werewolves.
4. Go into the 'Install' folder and run 'SangFroidSetup.exe'.
5. Copy the contents of the NoDVD folder over to the main game directory and overwrite. 
6. Play. 

If it still doesn't work, then download the fix HeroMaster posted and put it in your game directory. If it *still* doesn't work, copy the contents of the included 'Steam' folder into your Program Files x86Steam directory. Do not overwrite anything. "
,AedanClarke,2013-04-06T03:21Z,"Says ""Unable to read 'config.sf' file in C:ProgramData.""

I've installed this on both my C: and G: drives, making sure to use the updated 'steam_api.dll' file. Also, there's no such folder on either of my drives names 'ProgramData', so... I have no clue what's going on. Also, I've downloaded it twice and reinstalled both times. *shrugs*

Some help would be appreciated. Thanks. :)"
,AedanClarke,2013-04-06T04:23Z,"Oop, nevermind. Ferothul listed the step I missed: Going into the install menu and using THAT setup. The rest was fine.

Thanks to the both of you and to Artifice Studio for making the game. Looks like a buy from me at some point in the future, at least from what I've seen so far."

Thanks !"
,eric603x,2013-04-07T21:05Z,"This doesn't work for me.
I've been dealing with cracks for years so i'm no dummy.
HOWEVER, even after downloading the fix, etc.
What happens is the game loads, I see the loading screen and then it goes to a white screen and does nothing after that. No crash, no freeze. Just a white screen and that's IT.
Might want to address this issue, because this is a pretty big fail."
,eric603x,2013-04-07T21:07Z,"Also, sometimes it just hangs on the loading screen and does nothing."
,katoNAp1,2013-04-07T23:16Z,"1 Download The Kaos version (400Mb) and install c:Game (yes its a beta)

,kewlbeanspx,2013-04-09T22:54Z,"works for me, i forgot step 3 the first time, but once i ran the setup in the install folder, everything was gravy"
,skareo,2013-04-14T02:17Z,I'm actually surprised anyone would download this trash.
,tke494x,2013-05-31T17:50Z,does this game require Steam to be installed?
