CHRISTINE (DELUXE PDF)

a short story by c.seanmcgee

Based entirely on the Nietzsche proverb:

ΓÇ£He that fights monsters might take care lest he become a monsterΓÇ¥

This is the story of Christine and the day she grew a penis.


This particular work was inspired by the albums:

Dummy by Portishead

The Sound of Perseverance by Death

This has been another FREE ART project by CSM Publishing

Presenting art from C. Sean McGee 

This is the 5th free ebook written, published and released free digitally by c.seanmcgee since December 25, 2012

....and this is just the beginning

In my simple belief, it is better a story be a thousand times told than a single time sold. 

I look forward to bringing you more literary portraits and I hope you continue with me on this journey. 


Take Risk and Take Care,
