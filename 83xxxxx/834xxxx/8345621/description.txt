Welcome to D.C., the most powerful city in America, where it takes more than money to impress people ΓÇô it's about political power. With the social season in full swing, Michaele's Polo event caters to those who want to be close to it all, with attendees including the Ambassador of India, Michelle Jones and Republican Lobbyist, Edwina Rogers. As old rivalries cause Lynda to snub Michaele's Polo event, Mary struggles with the guest list for her birthday party. And Cat, the brash Brit and new girl in town, gets a crash course in public relations at Stacie's dinner party prepared by a celebrity chef.
