Can you really Play as the Left 4 Dead 2 characters in The Mercenaries: No Mercy mode?
Come on people the suspense is killing me. :)"
,4nt1trt,2013-04-06T05:38Z,we need to finish the game first to see it but loadings are faster
,l0w_rider,2013-04-06T09:55Z,For some reason the update is being detected as a Trojan by Eset....
,Soulicrus,2013-04-06T10:35Z,"This is the left4dead2 update
for RE6 Mercenary  No Mercy

except it still hasnt fixed the sending record data freeze yet"
,WonderPirate24,2013-04-06T10:41Z,"Wo! I guess I'll be waiting for ever...
There must be a way to skip to that level?
I mean, there must be a fix for that sucker
somewhere, no one really want's to wait
just to get a turned to play that level."
,WonderPirate24,2013-04-06T10:57Z,Oh no! A Trojan you say? I hope I have not been infected.
,chriscrash,2013-04-06T19:31Z,"kick ass torrent!! just a couple of things for those lame noobs, first, if you're  afraid of trojans, stop downloading torrents and buy the fucking game!! or change your stupid antivirus at least!!! second, please! don't be such a asshole and finish the game first in  order to unlock dlc!! damn!! you got this game for free and still complaining?? "
,4nt1trt,2013-04-07T14:29Z,"@trojan words
1: its false positive
2: if not (you think) block game by your firewall for going online"
,WonderPirate24,2013-04-08T04:30Z,"Boy this game is really tough!
Can't seem to shake off that blasted
zombie from chewing on my neck dough.
Still stuck in the Leon and Helena
Campaign 1, and if that ain't bad enough,
Still no word about the Left 4 Dead 2
characters in The Mercenaries: No Mercy mode.
Hey! Thanks for sharing! :)"
,Bakemonosama,2013-04-10T23:48Z,"Thanks alot you piece of shit.

""The saved data has been corrupted and could not be loaded.""
All my saves fucking vanished after installing this update. I had completed all the campaigns and had all the mercenaries costumes. Fuck you."

You're an idiot... you realise this, right? You actually think Stif makes the cracks?... Pretty sure it says RELOADED. So, even from a retards sense of logic, that would mean Stif had nothing to do with it. So how about aiming your anger at the right people?

Besides, you're seriously deluded to think being a pirate would come without any flaws or problems whatsoever."
,Bakemonosama,2013-04-23T17:51Z,"@ArkAngel666

You're THE idiot... you realise this, right? 

Read my post again fucktard. I didn't point my anger towards Stifmeister. Can you see me mention him anywhere? No. 
Cumgargler piece of shit."
,4nt1trt,2013-04-24T22:00Z,"only have tank and witch
