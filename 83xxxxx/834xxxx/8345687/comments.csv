,maxg50,2013-04-05T22:56Z,OMG! the nostalgy that i have from this game!!! (sorry for bad english)
,cliff3kate,2013-04-06T01:50Z,"greetings extremezone! crack folder was detected with this item Virtool:Win32/Obfuscator.XZ, alert level is Severe in Windows Defender. This is my first time that your uploaded game was detected with such alert. Is this safe anyway? Thank you so much. :) long live!"
,BluntzNzigzags,2013-04-06T04:14Z,theres no virus..its a false-positive...anyone should know extremezone is trustworthy...hence the green VIP skull...
,zekdala,2013-04-06T05:33Z,"anyone can help me? i have this error: GetFileInformationByHandleEx /Kernel32.dll/

my OS is XP professional pack 3"
,toajaller99,2013-04-06T05:50Z,"true the green skull does mean what you say man but take it from someone who has PERSONAL experience from these ""false positives"" in the past I have downloaded games with cracks and they always came up with virus's (trojans) and that exact trojan....and I use a more advanced better virus scanner and firewall then windows defender and when I said what he did on the site I got it from they said same thing ""its a false positive ignore it because its a crack so essentually its a hack so yea just ignore it"".....EVERY game I ever did that for ALWAYS F**** up my computer and I always BARELY got it recovered it replaces the win32 file that is one of the many files to make the OS run and yea.....so I no longer trust any game that I download that has a ""virus"" in it.....regardless of the possiblility that it might be false or not so I will say this....I am not saying this trojan alert is a real trojan or not but what I will say is this only download at you're own risk (just incase iis real I though I would make that point) but even if this is an actual false positive I hope everyone that reads this takes my lesson into account to not trust every ""false positive"" because they jsut might not be false "

If you're fucking up your PC from torrents, you have no clue what you are doing. A VIP is not going to upload a virus. For some reason you idiots think they are going to slip this past the thousands who download their torrents?

Learn how to use a computer properly before downloading torrents. Simple as that. Your computer is most likely fucked up because you do a lot of downloading."
,Davidhill7,2013-04-06T06:41Z,OMG!! THANKS A LOT!!
,Davidhill7,2013-04-06T06:50Z,THANKS A LOT!! I really love this game! 
,BluntzNzigzags,2013-04-06T07:03Z,"@toajaller99

Ive downloaded soooo many torrents from extremezone and Stiffy and NEVER had a virus / trojan...and i use norton 360, not windows defender and it has never brought a virus up to my attention..but yea..have a good day!"
,STONEDSTONER,2013-04-06T08:46Z,"Noobs and ther noob anti virus bs, Turn you computer off and never try using one again"
,LovingitlikeEZ,2013-04-06T12:25Z,"@toajaller99
lmao well thats fine while your flaming comment pages with QQ about viruses an shit ill be playing awesome games and watching high quality rips of movies ect........ 

Have fun with that!

but on a lighter and more calmer note dude just chill and think things through a little bit as you may or may not know already there are too many variables with computers to go blaming just any one or more things heck i know with mine even with a fresh os on it is different mostly everytime i turn it on and i cant be alone here so just think things through mate and make sure you make a system restore point each time then install its dead fucking simple."
,supermario5029,2013-04-06T14:48Z,"to anyone who thinks his torrents have viruses,its your dumb anti-virus,its false-positive and you should trust extremezone because he has a green VIP skull :)"
,supermario5029,2013-04-06T14:49Z,AND ONE MORE FUCKING THING:FUCKING SEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED!!!!!!!!!!!
,user46565,2013-04-06T16:13Z,"its easy, do not use the steam dll cracked from the game releases, use your own cracked. that all i do every time, i dont understand why they cryp their steam cracks, there nothing to hide."
,christoph.thomas,2013-04-06T16:34Z,ah nice ... i must have been playing entire days ...  thanks for sharing this !
,Jisto,2013-04-06T17:39Z,"Nice extremezone, nice. 
But is anyone else getting low res or is it just me?
I mean it has the same screen res mode as the old game not 1080. The preview showed a gigantic view. Is there a way to change it EZ?"
,Kapri25,2013-04-06T17:43Z,"For those that get the virus detected...it is not a virus. For me and Winsometimes Defender just allow the ""virus"" at the game works. Not a virus.

@ExtremeZone: Whoever you are...may all your babies be born naked! Thanks for a great classic game and all the wonderful uploads!"
,ables_jun,2013-04-06T20:07Z,seed plssssssssssss....
,solutioN-Ghost,2013-04-06T20:37Z,"People tend to prefer AoE II than AoE III, why is that ? Any specific reason?"
,nignug,2013-04-06T22:19Z,"@solutioN-Ghost

AoE 2 is just a classic bad ass game. Definitely in my top 10 of all time. AoE 3 didn't deliver much extra. Just better graphics."
,KcahllaW,2013-04-06T22:21Z,"Hi, thx for the upload.
I tried to set up an ad-hoc server to play this game but it doesn't works. I need help pls :/
I'm on Win8, the other PC on Vista."
,patapum,2013-04-07T00:52Z,"someone try to make it a Mac Game with wineskin please.

,chimacc,2013-04-07T01:24Z,ERRORCODE_26 wtf  any help?
,tiagosmx,2013-04-07T08:05Z,"Well, I got disappointed on this game.
I was waiting modifications and upgrades on the menus, graphics etc.
I guess i was wrong.
Ah! And there's NO LAN MULTIPLAYER mode, this REALLY sucks!"
,ArtepSkywork,2013-04-07T08:20Z,Was taken to steam and yes I did copy over the crack. I'll try again but...
,jblackham66,2013-04-07T11:56Z,"This is weird! It have had the game for about 48 hours. This time, however, i went into the game and there is no text in any of the button boxes. I tried to reinstall the game but it's still the same. Any ideas????"

Try running the game in admin mode, and with win xp compatibility. You can also try running in 256 colors. These are fixes to older games, but they might not work since this is an old game that has been remade for new PCs."
,jackelman,2013-04-08T06:58Z,the steam.dll is fucked don't download won't work.
,xyz675,2013-04-08T08:54Z,"When i start match i can see only minimap and menu,everything else is black. How i can repair this? I have Win7 x64"
,steliosfire,2013-04-08T15:53Z,crack file have a virus he blog it my antivirus.... ESET 4 EVER
,hazardose,2013-04-09T22:44Z,"I have the same issue, as xyz675 above.
Installed & cracked the game properly.
But when I run it, the main part of the screen is black (I can't see the hills, the houses, etc.). Only the minimap and the menu are visible.
I also have Win7 x64, NVidia gfx card, etc.
Does anyone have any idea about how to fix this?
...anyway, thanks for the upload, EZ!"
,Hero557,2013-04-10T01:45Z,I mounted and installed it but I don't see the crack file to replace. It's not in the folder i downloaded. Where is it? Anyone?
,Hero557,2013-04-10T02:02Z,"Nevermid. I got it to work by copying all the files (3 of them) from the crack directory to the main folder. Playing game, it just won't close when you try to minimize it. "
,jfc_campos,2013-04-10T14:29Z,how to change the game resolution?
,yourdead09,2013-04-10T23:57Z,Wasnt this released on April 9? 
,Capn.JackSparrow,2013-04-11T09:42Z,Yohoho
,nignug,2013-04-17T02:22Z,"@hazarddose

It just seems their ""tweaks"" didn't make it run perfectly on new machines. Try making a couple of your own tweaks(this worked for me). Go to properties of the game .exe and run as admin, set to 256 colors, disable visual themes and desktop compostition, and if that doesnt work also set it to run in win xp(service2) mode."
,lackluster0,2013-04-17T05:38Z,I tried making tweaks but i got a rainbow screen and then it closed.
,Babality,2013-05-09T12:46Z,Trojan in it ! Did u copy/paste from Stiffmeister lol 
,golbaiin,2013-05-13T19:29Z,"Dont have to download, know its a virus! Shame on you motherfucker!"
,Bangis17,2013-05-14T13:53Z,Tack  
,Baheera,2013-05-21T08:44Z,"For all of you who say this torrent contains a virus - - - there is a crack file included in this torrent.  OF COURSE your AV/AS software will think its a virus.  Duh (rhetorical question is, have you really never used a crack before...)
On another note, thank you for taking the time to package the torrent + crack file so I don't have to hunt it down myself :D"
