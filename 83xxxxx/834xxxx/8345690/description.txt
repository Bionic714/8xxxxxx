Notes: (READNFO) Audio is CAM. Could possibly be wrong because we haven't been
around much, but this is better than the last bit of CAM audio that was floating
around. (Don't hold us to that sh!t pls.) Standard work done.

P.S - Been some time, jeez. To all the sites that we're on; We'll be back soon,
just gotta sort some stuff. Sorry for not being active, we're not ignoring y'all. 

Greetz: To everybody keeping things alive.

Looking for... Vodka, Vodka, Vodka and Vodka.
