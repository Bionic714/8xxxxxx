If it does just remove the update with wii backup manager before moving it to a HDD or burning it.

actually i need the updates, so does it have the updates?"
,khairo_j1,2013-04-11T09:29Z,how about how to properly burn this to a dvd?
,bainf,2013-04-25T03:44Z,"thanks for the upload, some mini games are fun.  for latest version 4.3. Pick a newish Nintendo game. They always have it, something like mario and sonic at london, others have updates but its trick, they are often only uploading the IOS they need to operate only. You generally don't need 4.3 and if you are asking that question you may struggle to recrack your Wii. You can just add the ios for shop channel, which is easier, google it"
