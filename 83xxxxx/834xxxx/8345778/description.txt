Sir Georg Solti was one of the greatest
recording artists who ever lived
not only his still unequalled record of
31 Grammysr attests to that:
the present documentary illluminates
the life and work of Sir Georg Solti on
the 100th anniversary of his birth.
We follow the Hungarian-Jewish
conductor's career: as Toscanini's
assistant at the Salzburg Festival,
as music director in Munich and
Frankfurt after the war,
achieving worldwide fame
with his legendary
Vienna Philharmonic recording
of Wagner's Ring cycle.
It was as the long-serving
music director of the Royal
Opera House, Covent Garden
and of the Chicago Symphony
Orchestra that Solt became an
international star of classical music,
one whose musical ardour
and perfectionism remain unsurpassed
to this day.
