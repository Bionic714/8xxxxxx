This book contains Bible study lessons on various subjects that were taught over the years, at our church (Paran Baptist Church in Lake City, SC). This book is dedicated for knowledge, understanding, and inspiration as we seek to follow Our Lord & Savior Jesus Christ. We hope that this collection of Bible study lessons will serve as a useful companion guide to the author's Biblical commentaries. A comprehensive range of topics are covered, including Christian living and prayer, Christian history, the nature of Christ and the Holy Bible, and Biblical prophecy.
