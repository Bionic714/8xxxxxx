Brief introduction to PDF password

The standard security provided by PDF has two different passwords: user passwords and owner passwords. A PDF document may be protected by a password for opening (user password) and the document may also specify operations that should be restricted even when the document is decrypted: printing; copying text and graphics out of the document; modifying the document; and adding or modifying text notes (using owner password).
