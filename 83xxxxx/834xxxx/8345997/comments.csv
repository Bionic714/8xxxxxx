,BluntzNzigzags,2013-04-05T23:23Z,hmmm.sounds interesting..thanks for the upload big stifmeister
,nazgull2k10,2013-04-05T23:39Z,"Just a heads up, last time I downloaded one of this guys torrents.. it cost me my credit card and about 60 dollars due to hacking my data..  I dont trust this guys uploads..  you have been warned."
,pringles9,2013-04-06T00:00Z,"Unless you can provide substantiative proof that the malware came from Mr.Stifmeister's torrent, you shouldn't throw around accusations like that. The old ""correlation =/ causation"" and all that."
,Tjezee,2013-04-06T00:44Z,"Just a heads up, I actually had really good experiences with Mr.Stifmeisters stuff and would like to thank him for the time and effort. Have a great day."
,lrdgarth,2013-04-06T03:05Z,"First off you're full of crap. Non-authorized charges are refunded 100%. Secondly, I doubt you could track it down to this program from this guy stole this card number and charged this charge."
,klord2010,2013-04-06T03:45Z,"""you have been warned""
and you have been high"
,nazgull2k10,2013-04-06T03:54Z,"LOL, I never ONCE said ""I never got the money back.""  

2nd - yes, I CAN.  Was simple really.. BioShock 2 was a Steam Rip, first bogus charge on my card was a 44.98 for a STEAM GAME.  Then Three $1 charges for a bogus seller account on some website called iBuy.  That was when I found the charges, called the card company, reported the card stolen, emailed steam (and yeah dickbag, i DID get my money back.)  then forwarded the messages to the police and FBI Internet Crimes Division.  

I Also know for a FACT it was HIS torrent that caused it.  I had JUST bought that card, used it ONCE on a legal STEAM purchase, then installed HIS bioshock 2 rip.. (Normally Im STRICTLY EzTv or ExtremeZone.)  ... and I get my CC info jacked?!  Bullshit.  It does NOT take an idiot to figure out EXACTLY what happened.

Like I said.. You've been warned.. When it happens to you, dont come fuckin cryin to me about it."

,riwcio,2013-04-06T11:57Z,"great story, bro. but how exactly does it work, to message ""the police and FBI Internet Crimes Division"" about a guy stealing your card info while you've been stealing games ? poor little thief-boy.."
,klord2010,2013-04-06T13:50Z,anyone stuck at wating for steam init. screen?
,klord2010,2013-04-06T13:59Z,"nvm it was afterburners ""Enable compatibility with modified Direct3D runtime libraries"" option. so either sweetfx or osd not both. lol."
,Kingsanx,2013-04-06T15:18Z,Why did they take the positive and negative thumbs? I used to enjoy taking those into consideration.
,CakeTown7,2013-04-06T19:08Z,"@nazgull2k10
Wow you're pretty stupid if you think anyones gonna believe that.   What kind of an idiot would pirate a game, then go complain to Steam that your credit card info was stolen because you tried to pirate a game.

Wow you're smart.   Please learn something about technology so you don't look like a complete idiot."
,gioamasha,2013-04-06T20:36Z,when i start game it asks for steam to be running so any help
,felperc,2013-04-06T21:58Z,"Game just stops at loading screen, while music is playing. "
,Machine4578,2013-04-07T01:14Z,this release from RLD is still a BETA version(BETA v1.03) ALI213 released the steam release v1.11!!!
,BluntzNzigzags,2013-04-07T02:08Z,"i did every thing as followed in the directions...copy the crack, let InstallSangFroidSetup.exe run after setup. ect... but when it loads, a screen pops up saying steam authorization. than it just shuts down. any1 know what happened?"
,BluntzNzigzags,2013-04-07T02:22Z,"nevermind....dont know what happened earlier, but seems to be working now"

,f_loia,2013-04-08T04:32Z,"Thaks katoNAp1, i did what you wrote, but nope...still stuck on ""Waiting for Steam Initializantion""....i tried both version with and without the heromaster fix and still didn´t work....thanks anyway...any help will be aprecciated !!!"
,sleven06,2013-04-09T02:35Z,"@f_loia :think i got good news for you, I myself somehow had a lil problem to install that one, so here how i solved mine.1-go in downloads, then extract.install by running the setup exe.(note that i didnt have to ''mount''this game).go in crack's folder.copie the 2 steam_ one NOT the app.copy right when u enter ur program files 86x/sang froid/tales of warewolfs.after return to ur crack file an copy JUST the app. one.Return in same place u just copy the previous 2 cracks.Click to highlight the app in programfiles 86xan copy OVER it  (when its HIGHLIGHTED)replace it.run it.enjoy it.tell me if it worked for you.(sorry for my English grammmar, 'am from france:P"
,lrdgarth,2013-04-09T02:53Z,"@klord2010. If you got your money back then it didn't ""cost"" you $60 did it? You'd have to be a real dumb ass to complain to the authorities that the illegal software you installed stole your credit card. If something stole your credit card number it would have to have been on before you used it for steam. If you installed the rip after the purchase as you said your cc is already on steam's servers and there's no way for it to get the number. They don't store it locally and don't give it back out."
,f_loia,2013-04-09T08:58Z,"Hi sleven06, thanks for the tips...i did exactly what you wrote, but still doesn´t work...I´m from Brasil and my English is not that good either...I love France by the way, amazing country....merci !!!"
,ZtorkX86,2013-04-20T00:04Z,Has anyone tried multiplayer through a VPN or does it require valid Steam copy for that?
,DarkMan70,2013-06-08T21:05Z,"I've just made crack to resolve ""Waiting for Steam initialization..."" issue. You can download it here:
