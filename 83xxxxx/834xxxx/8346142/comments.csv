[V],QborT,2013-04-06T20:22Z,"RBH4908 -  TPB has it listed as Leechers, but really it should be Peers as those are just the people in the swarm that don't currently have 100% (Seeders).

Sure some of them are obviously true none sharring Leechers, but that isn't something TPB worries about.

Also this isn't a Retail Blu-Ray, it is an RC.  That's why it doesn't have DTS sound."
