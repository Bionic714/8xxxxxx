,SeuLunga,2013-04-21T14:24Z,"slinckkey, I have fixed my mouse bug. Put the game into window mode (or do Command + Tab) and try to search for the mouse while it appears as a window. Sometimes, you put the mouse to the dock bar and when you return to the game, it continues for 2 segonds. So, in this time, you can change the screen resolution. When you change the resolution, the mouse is back. "
,CRASH1SG0D,2013-05-23T18:48Z,"Thanks for saving me the effort of doing it myself; installing the Windows version and copying it over to the same Wineskin they used here from paulthetall.com 

It might still be faster to do it myself really, considering the hours I save for the Windows game installer downloading. But if you run it before bed it makes no difference anyway. 

Its stupid that it's default at Russian and not English, because the majority is English speakers. Changing it to LOCALIZATION/LANGUAGE=en worked though.

You spelled ""Cities"" wrong and left out the space on the disk image and application too which is stupid also.

And is it normal to take forever to load and be glitchy as fuck? I may try doing it manually just to see if it works better."
,CRASH1SG0D,2013-05-23T19:12Z,"My bad, glitchyness was caused by the game resolution being set higher than my desktop resolution. (I have a massively high def 15"" TV for a monitor so I set it lower than max res so I can actually read what's on the screen) I set the game to the some resolution as my desktop and the glitchyness went away.
