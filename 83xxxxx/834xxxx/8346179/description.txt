Vampire: The Masquerade ΓÇô Bloodlines, abbreviated as Bloodlines or VTMB, is a role-playing video game developed by Troika Games in 2004. Like Activision's Vampire: The Masquerade ΓÇô Redemption, Bloodlines is set in White Wolf, Inc.'s Vampire: The Masquerade universe also known as the World of Darkness (WoD), but it is not a sequel to the earlier game. The game allows the player to choose one of several different vampire clans and progress through the game according to the different strengths and weaknesses of the player's character, as in its paper and pencil role-playing origins.
Although Bloodlines divided critics at the time of release, it retains a popular cult following.[1] It is also notable for being the first third-party game to use Valve's Source engine. The game can be played from either the first-person or third-person perspective. It is also Troika Games' third title and the last to be made before Troika closed down in February 2005.
