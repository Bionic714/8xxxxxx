Question for anyone who knows for sure. This looks like all the cut scenes from Lego Batman 2 put back to back to make the movie am i right? I have the game and beat it twice and helped my son beat it as well and watch the trailer for this movie and really does just look like the scenes from the game. 
Kinda cool for anyone who hasnt played the game and even for people who have played it all gets put together. My son and I will definitely be watching this very soon again Thanks again for the up!!!"
