But you do know that you have to seed first, so that interested people can get your torrent and then they can take over seeding, don't you?  You've got a few interested parties, myself included, so now is the time!  SEED!  And when I get this, I'll seed for at least a week - more if there's any activity!  "

Time of death. . . . ."
