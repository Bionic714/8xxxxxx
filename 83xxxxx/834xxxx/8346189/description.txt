An excellent war movie about the Bosnian civil war in the 1990s.
It won an Academy Award, receiving the best foreign film Oscar in 2001.

I had to create my own version of the video with English subtitles in order to watch it.
They speak mostly Serbo-Croatian in it, and the only subtitled version of the movie that I could find had burned in Swedish subs.
So I ended up downloading a version with no subtitles, and finding an English subtitle SRT file on a web site.
Those subtitles were unfortunately not in sync with the movie, so I had to resync them.


91 minutes
H.264 encoded MP4 file format with hardcoded English subtitles.
