*Gun owners and vets labeled terrorists*
On the Friday, April 5 transmission of the Alex Jones Show, Alex breaks through the wall of lies overthrowing reality as Americans face the fight of their lives, confronting a purge of gun owners and a persecution of returning veterans being disarmed and having their children stolen. He also breaks down the accelerating global economic meltdown, and the escalating North Korean nuclear threat's chillingly close April 10 deadline. On today's show, Alex speaks with former presidential nominee of the Constitution Party, co-author of Romans 13: The True Meaning of Submission and the founder and former pastor of Crossroad Baptist Church in Florida, Chuck Baldwin. Also, Alex welcomes Dr. Greg Dixon, a Baptist pastor who staged a peaceful protest against the IRS's para-military order.
