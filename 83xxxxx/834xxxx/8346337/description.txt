"The Incident"

When Max tries out Jane and Alex's long-time
hairdresser, Krisjahn, he gets some good
salon gossip on the girls, but his loose lips
may cause World War III between the
Kerkovitch sisters. Meanwhile, the Steak Me
Home truck is stolen and Dave and Penny try
to figure out whodunit -- but are perplexed
by what they find when they finally locate
the thief.
