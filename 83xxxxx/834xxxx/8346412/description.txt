Storyline: 

The film is composed of multiple comedy shorts.
Since the source had some Russian pieces in it, to connect one short to another, I removed the Russian pieces and replaced them with a little transition effect.

As the source was a R5 and the R1 / R2 version has another storyline between the shorts, it does nothing for the movie, except connect the shorts.

The short comedy bits are all intact.
I translated the English and added Dutch subtitles.
Enjoy!
