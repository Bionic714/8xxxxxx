Enjoy!"

,reb1138,2013-04-07T14:33Z,Thank you so much! will buy the physical copy too though as soon as it hits record stores over here :)
,piratebuddha,2013-04-07T15:12Z,"You're welcome, and I want to thank all the other seeders for helping.

I definitely think everyone should buy a physical copy of this (if you enjoy it and can afford it) as a way to show support for good music. This group, in my humble opinion, was some of Layne Staley and Mike McCready's best work."
