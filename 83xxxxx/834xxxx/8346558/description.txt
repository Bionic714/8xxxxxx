"Two Of A Kind"

As Jake uses a cipher to locate
Amelia, Martin tracks a bloody path
to Guillermo, who is stalking Dr.
Nell Plimpton, someone we've seen
before and one of the righteous "36."
Meanwhile, Calvin Norburg meets with
Nicole Farington, the uber-competent
CEO of Aster Corps, who introduces
him to the first quantum computer in
an attempt to woo him back to the
company. When different roads lead to
the same location, lives are lost as
shocking events unfold
