"One Angry Fuchsbau"

Rosalee asks Hank, Nick, and Monroe
for help when a defense attorney
tries to use Wesen wiles to overturn
a murder case; memories rush back to
Juliette when she returns to the
trailer. Memories of days spent with
Sam and Dean on television show that
actually has originality and, well,
semi decent writing.
