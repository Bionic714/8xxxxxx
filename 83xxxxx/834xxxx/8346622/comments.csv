Also sorry about the lateness, Life caught up for a bit."

,MoMoCHu5,2013-04-06T19:34Z,"what do you mean when you say you upped the quality a bit

My pc can't play 1080p stuff, so I just want to know what you mean"
,MoMoCHu5,2013-04-06T19:35Z,"I have really slow internet, since the fastest internet it 40Mbps at $400 PM and the slowest, 1Mbps, what I have, is just over $40"
,FoodBank,2013-04-06T20:11Z,Size is fine Quality is nice!
,MoMoCHu5,2013-04-08T01:51Z,"It wouldn't play properly
Can't he release a high quality 1280x720 episode, like it is now
and a low quality 1280x720 episode, like normally is "
,TriplePlay2425,2013-04-10T05:39Z,"I quite like the quality, however for a 11-minute episodes and when there are 26 episodes per season, I would prefer your old file size.  For the cartoon style, I think the quality was more than acceptable.  They were great quality for the size.  Although you said you'll probably drop it to halfway between your old episodes and this one, which I think would be a good compromise.

In my opinion, this is just a little too big, considering the length of the show and the number of episodes, it would add up to a lot of HDD space if they all started being this big (over twice as large as most episodes!).

That said, I'm not complaining.  It's a great release, great quality, and I love the job you do.  I would just prefer sacrificing a little quality for the filesize, as I think the quality was quite sufficient in your previous 720p releases.  Just my own personal preference.  :)"
