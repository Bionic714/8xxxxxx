,SikDuc,2013-04-06T20:28Z,Spartacus is starting to lose it's appeal for me... only ONE set of ta tas in this episode. Wayyy to much crying by the gladiators... Next thing we'll see is they all start to 'sparkle' in the sunlight... it's friggen becoming another Twilight!

,lassik2,2013-04-07T18:58Z,"So with everyone dying in this episode except Spartacus and him being captured, where could they possibly go with the Finale?

I really didn't expect Tiberius to kill Naevia like that..."
,cervece41,2013-04-08T01:40Z,Thanks !
,funseeker521,2013-04-08T06:05Z,"@lassik I hope you are consumed by a flesh eating bacteria that starts with your unnaturally tiny genitals you son of a poxy whore.
To all others just say nay to the ferkin Merkin! Huaa!"
,funseeker521,2013-04-08T06:50Z,"@lassik OK, perhaps I was a little too harsh considering you didn't actually spoil anything. 

I would change the curse 

from flesh eating bacteria to just an annoying fungus 

that is easily treated with an ointment that stings quite a bit !

 Ha!!"
