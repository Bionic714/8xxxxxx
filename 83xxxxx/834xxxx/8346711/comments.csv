,SixWingedFreak,2013-04-16T17:05Z,"Thanks uploader. 

I've installed the 47 updates, the store fixes, the collections, and worlds. It says I also need to put in the buildings/lots. I'm looking at the lots here, and some are packages and some are sims3packs. Okay, that's fine. 

But where in the Readme, comments, or otherwise does it say I need to do with the ""A"" & ""B"" files? Do I use both? One or the other? Whats the difference? Please advise."
,droewyn,2013-04-20T16:34Z,"The Sims3Pack in the Live, Love, Laugh building doesn't have an extension.  Adding the .Sims3Pack extension makes it usable."
,seedersanonymous,2013-04-21T07:22Z,"This may sound incredibly stupid, but does this include all of the sims 3 expansion packs also?
and if not, do you have an updated version of those that we can install for those of us who are ""stupid"" in this sort of area and don't know how to do anything with cracks and stuff? "
,Keiko12A,2013-04-26T09:17Z,"Thank you !!!

But I didn't like your .package with more than 1GB. It's too big !!! It would have been better if they do not exceed more than 200MB.

But, thanks !"
,shenomega,2013-04-29T02:15Z,"I installed all .sims3pack and put in the Fixes in the package folder.

When I started the game, I have these empty invisible items that does not show, and many of them as well... I'm in the latest update which is 1.50.56 and have university.

""I've done many .sim3pack and .package before so please do not ask me I misplaced the files...""

So why are they invisible.. "
,jeanc47,2013-04-29T04:47Z,can someone please help with installing the packages files only store updates 21-47 are installing the others doesn't show up
,daichiwai,2013-05-01T12:43Z,"Hi, thank you very much for uploading.
Putting all those .package files into the game seems make the game a bit lag. I found a tutorial for combining the .package files somewhere else. But I would like to ask is it safe to combine those .package files that you asked us to put in the collection folder?"
,alackey,2013-05-04T14:41Z,I am a Comcast user is it safe for me to download this or will they hijack my browser because the war against bittorent  users.  Anyone else have comcast?
,LaChimere,2013-05-08T23:16Z,"@daichiwai I tried combining the .package files and none of them showed up in my game. They don't cause any lag at all for me - perhaps it's other custom content (sims3packs or .package) causing it? You could also scan your other CC to see if any of them, or your game save, is corrupted - corrupted files cause serious lag for me.


I did notice that the monthly .package files ""conflict"" with the updates, according to Delphy's Dashboard. Any reason why this could be showing up??"
,kathykat63,2013-05-09T10:46Z,"Thanks Rachel!  And, thanks to the seeds, the download is going pretty quickly. [:"
,lindz444,2013-05-10T18:54Z,I'm not getting Sims 3 Store Updates 001-020 v1.3.1.package show up in game for some reason. The other two are working just fine. There were all extracted and installed the same way. Anyone else having this problem or know how to fix this?
