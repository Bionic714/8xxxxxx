Are u by any chance going to release movies in 3D format - HSBS or HOU?"
,jalucian,2013-04-07T18:10Z,"WOW. Since YIFY was my inspiration for getting into encoding, that is absolutely the best compliment I have gotten so far. Thank you! 

It probably wont be anytime soon for 3D I'm sorry to say. I don't have any way to playback or test 3D at the moment and I would hate to upload untested material but if that situation changes then I will probably start doing it. Thank you again for the wonderful comment."

I really like the audio bitrates in your release. Yify always suffers in the Audio dept.
Yify has gone bigger and since it has a standalone site..probably has far more seeders. But am sure guys who probably download from u once, will look no further. Cheers!"
