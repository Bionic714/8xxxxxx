Notes:

The is the American adaptation of Stieg Larrson's MÃ¤n som hatar kvinnor (2009), which is the first of the Millennium Trilogy movies. If you like this movie, you'll probably like the Swedish original even more. And the Swedish version has two sequels - something the American version cannot claim. I have encoded all three of the Swedish Extended versions into a single torrent, here:

The Swedish version is also in 1080p resolution (although I also have it in 720p) and is in the original Swedish with English subtitles. I do not ever use dubbing or English voice-overs in my encodes of foreign language films. Dubbing ruins movies. Use the subtitles. 

Bitrates listed are variable, using multi-pass encoding for maximum quality, which means the numbers you see are average bitrates.

Please note that my bitrates and file sizes are optimized for those who store and watch movies on their computers. The bitrates are high enough to look perfect on "normal" sized monitors and low enough to keep download times short and the file size small enough for those who have limited hard drive space to work with. If you plan on watching something on a large HD screen, you may need one of the larger file size, higher bitrate torrents. The larger the screen you'll be watching on, the higher the bitrate has to be to maintain picture quality. If you have a large screen, you'll need to experiment too see what bitrate it takes to maintain a quality picture for your particular size screen.

Please seed as long as possible, preferably until reaching a share ratio of at least 3:1.
