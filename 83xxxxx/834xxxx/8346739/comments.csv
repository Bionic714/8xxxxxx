based on the sample it is GOOD quality.  There is a slight blur around the picture but not blurry so I give a 7 for video

the sound is loud and bassy but definitely better than a lot so also a 7 for audio.

overall the sample looked good but it was a bright scene.  based on the bright scene it looked good. so I would assume the dark was also this good quality."
