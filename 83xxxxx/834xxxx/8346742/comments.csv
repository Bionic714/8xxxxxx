,repulsiv,2013-04-10T02:32Z,"Why does everyone's comments have to revolve around gay shit?  Why can't people just give their opinions without being ostracized?  That's why there should be an age restriction on the pirate bay, to keep the high school kids out."
,crumrugin,2013-04-10T04:05Z,woe to the casting director 
,pawn3d,2013-04-10T04:15Z,"Thanks Ace, the quality was great... The movie however, sucked so bad, that I was compelled to jump on TPB and tell the whole internets just how much of a piece of shit movie this really is.

I'm not lying when I say I had my finger on the FFWD>> button the whole time. I'll bet the entire cost of this film's budget went to renting Seth Green and a restaurant for a day... That leaves millions of dollars to bribe critics and reviewers to say this piece of shit is a masterpiece. 

Fuck you seth green, fuck you old hag trying to play a high school girl and fuck you sean penn. I'm taking this to small claims court for wasting my fucking time. Have a nice life. See you in hell!!!1"
,aoxo,2013-04-10T09:22Z,"Hmm..I made it 24 minutes in before I realized this whole movie is going to take place in a bar, and involve people talking about some bitch I don't care about.  Just to make sure, I skipped to several points throughout the rest of the film...yup.  Somehow I though if it had Seth Green in it it must be funny, that and the ""genre"" says comedy.  Then again the plot says ""a group of guys"" so Michelle Trachtenberg must have a penis.  This movie is pretentious...right down to the drinks the characters order...martinis?  Absinth?!  Absinth tastes like ass and she didnt even use a sugar cube or anything..I'm pretty sure shes sipping on Midori.  If you like to hang out with people that like to call themselves artists..yet can't draw a stickfigure...and listen to them talk about themselves all night long while ordering gross drinks just to impress people...then this movie is for you."

The longer you watch it the bigger the retard you are.

,mikrovision,2013-04-13T01:15Z,"What a waste. In one scene, Michelle Trachtenberg actually refers to Seth Green by his real name, and not the character he is playing. Too drunk for re-shoots, I suppose."
