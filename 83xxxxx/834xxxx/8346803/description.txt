"Agent-00" is portrayed by Filipino born Weng Weng. The 2'9" (0.84m) miniature man spoofs the Bond-like character by solving international crime figures such as Mr. Giant and his lunatic band of henchmen who want to push their drugs any way possible. That is until Agent-00 is on their trail and relentlessly pursues them. Along the way he meets a woman whom he begins to develop feelings for.

Agent-00 doesn't stop until he has whipped up on every single henchman, using a wide variety of special miniaturized weapons developed exclusively for his fighting style and stature, but the bad guys discover Agent-00's own hands and feet are nothing to be trifled with as he kicks their behinds into submission.

This can be a rather enjoyable movie, albeit unintentionally silly much of the time, but it follows in the footsteps of the popular English spy, of which, the title of this film borrows it's name.
