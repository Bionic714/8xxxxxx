HAVE YOU BEEN BANNED FROM THE NEXUS FORUMS? 
NOW YOU CAN'T USE THE MOD MANAGER BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO LOGIN? 
NO WORRIES! HERE IS A CRACKED VERSION FOR YOU!

Or maybe you just want your privacy.

This cracked Mod Manager will not force you to log in. 
UPDATE: HOORAY!! NEXUS SITE SAW THAT I HAVE CRACKED THIS AND GOTTEN HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOWNLOADS, STOLEN FROM THEM! THEY SEE THAT EVEN BANNED MEMBERS STILL HAVE ACCESS, SO THEY LOSE THEIR POWER!! THEY HAVE SUBMITTED TO US!! NOW THERE IS AN "OFFLINE MODE" IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO CRACK IT!!!

However, seeing as the following things, you still do want to crack it:
1) They still do not let members who are banned be able to download mods. So we must use the cracked version to defy them until they submit further!
2) If you are banned from the Nexus site, you still have to login to download! This means you can't get new versions if you are banned! Scum.

BUT HOORAY FOR THE FIRST GREAT VICTORY OVER THE NEXUS MODS SITE!! LET'S CONTINUE TO DEFY THE SELF-DECLARED NEXUS LORDS AND REMOVE THEM FROM THEIR FALSE THRONE!!! LET'S FORCE THEM TO SUBMIT TO US FURTHER!!!

Based off the latest 0.44.7 version of the Nexus Mod Manager in April of 2013.

FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS EXACTLY, AND IN ORDER.

=======================================================

STEP 1:
	a) Open Mod_Manager_Cracked_0.44.7.zip 
	(NOTE: Why zipped? Faster downloads, and less likely for file corruption. Also if you ever get your copy corrupted, then it's easy to restore to a working copy of the program by just unzipping the folder and overwriting all.)

	b) Copy "Mod Manager 0.44.7" folder to C:/Program Files/

STEP 2:
    When it asks you to log in, choose "OFFLINE MODE". You don't even need to be connected to the internet!

STEP 3:
    SUCCESS!

=======================================================

NOTES:

How do I crack the program?
	Already cracked!
	
What does crack do for me / Why is it cracked?
	1) If you're banned from the site, now you can use the application by downloading this torrent.
	2) You can use the program without being logged in.
	3) More security for you.
	4) Peace of mind.
	5) PORTABLE means no install required! Better for you.
	
Can I update mods? 
	YES. Just not through the Mod Manager if in OFFLINE MODE.
	If you do have a login, it will work!

Can I update the Mod Manager? 
	Yes!

Will it ever try to access the Nexus Forums?
