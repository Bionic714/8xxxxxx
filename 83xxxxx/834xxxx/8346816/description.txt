Directed by the late, great Kinki Fukasaku and based on the novel of the same name by Koushun Takami, 2000's Battle Royale proved to be quite a controversial film but few who saw it would deny its power. For various reasons, from rights and contractual issues to a wariness to release it in a post-Columbine world, the film and its sequel were never released domestically.
