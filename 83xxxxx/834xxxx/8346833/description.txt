Trout Steak Revival isnΓÇÖt going to earn any awards as the fastest or loudest bluegrass pickers. But the band may be in line to challenge many of those quick and ripping pickers when it comes to songwriting.

The Denver-based group formed in 2008 through a network of friends at backyard and sometimes backwoods parties, and part of Trout SteakΓÇÖs charm is that jam-session-like looseness. But amidst that casual approach is some intensely focused attention to song structure and lyrics, backed by some very solid, yet not flamboyant, picking.
