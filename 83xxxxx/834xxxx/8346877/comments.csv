You wouldn't happen to have ""The Money Pit (1986)"" or ""Easy Money (1983)""??"
,nabsltd,2013-04-08T02:33Z,"They aren't on my current ""want to have"" list, and I don't even recall seeing either one playing on any HD movie channel (that shows uncut films) that I get.

I upload everything as fast as I finish it (within reason, as I need to allow a day or so for other seeders to help relieve the load).  I obviously only do films that haven't been released on Blu-Ray and don't already have a good version available.

I have one with an logo that's temporary but more often and more annoying than HDNet:
For Love or Money (1993) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106941/

And, my ""with constant logo"" collection:
Delirious (1991) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101701/
F/X 2 (1991) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101846/
Gorky Park (1983) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085615/
High Spirits (1988) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095304/
Hollywood Shuffle (1987) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093200/
Married to the Mob (1988) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095593/
Moscow on the Hudson (1984) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087747/
No Way Out (1987) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093640/
Punchline (1988) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095927/
Seems Like Old Times (1980) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081480/
Undercover Blues (1993) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108442/
Who's Harry Crumb? (1989) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098645/
Yours, Mine, and Ours (1968) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063829/

If there is great demand for any of these, I'll upload them."
,TheOnlyest,2013-04-08T03:19Z,"Delirious and Who's Harry Crumb are on my want list. I'd love to have those, even with a logo!
I uploaded a few of my own semi-original 1 of 1's  recently, you should search my username and see if there's anything you need. Same share criteria as yours."
