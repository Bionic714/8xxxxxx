The Rachel Maddow Show plus All In With Chris Hayes - mkv
April 5  - 2013

Both shows are in one file - 126 minutes
I included - ALL IN - because it was a new show and Rachel has been talking about it.
I thought some of you might have been curious about it.

My cable changed from a SD full screen 4-3 to a SD wide screen 16-9 letterboxed
This made my source file even smaller which makes the quality worse.
Nothing I can do about that.
