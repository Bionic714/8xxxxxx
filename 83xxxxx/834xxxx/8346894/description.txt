Placebo is the eponymous debut studio album by English alternative rock band Placebo. It was released on 16 July 1996 through Hut Records. It is the only album recorded with drummer Robert Schultzberg before his departure from the group.
In recent years, only a few songs from the album were still being played live. Since 2006, "Come Home" and "I Know" were often included in live setlists. "Nancy Boy" was occasionally played as an encore. "Bionic" was regularly present on set lists until 2005. It has been played often on the Battle for the Sun tour.
Placebo was remastered and reissued in 2006 for its tenth anniversary.
