 Recorded Live in Peru May 2007: "The Krystal River Dance & the 1st Dance of the Cycle of ΓÇÿLast StandsΓÇÖ; Machu Picchu-Caral & The Sacred Valley. Enjoy the breath-taking scenery along the rugged desert mountains and lush high altitude valleys of Peru while experiencing the first ΓÇ£SlideΓÇ¥ into Aquarius, the New Ascension Earth. Travel with EarthΓÇÖs Team Indigo on the ΓÇ£RaShaLAe Projection Journey that started the process of progressively opening the Ascension Passage between Earth and Urtha. Hear all about the amazing multi-networked Ascension Passage (An-Sha-TA-Sa Passage) and its relationship to Human Tribe Seedings Two and Three. Learn about the FOUR levels of 3-dimensional reality fields, the first of which was created by a series of passage openings including Level-1 activation of the Gyrodome and the Aqualene Sun during this Peru workshop.

The Seeding Three Aquari hybridization programs allowed a small proportion of the Aquari/Indigo/Human hybrids to pick up the keys to not only the Seeding Three passages but also the Seeding Two passages (called the Aquafereion NavAHo Indigos and Humans). These Indigos and Humans were commissioned to visit specific sacred sites (linked to the Ecousha Platforms and Aurora Zones) in Caral, the Sacred Valley of the IncaΓÇÖs, Cusco and Machu Picchu. Learn about the fascinating and ancient history associated with these beautiful ΓÇ£archeological sitesΓÇ¥ that date back to Human Seeding Two and how they relate to the Seeding Three (Astura) and Seeding Two (Aquafereion Krystal Heart) Ascension Passages and the mysterious subterranean cities of Ah-RU-NE-Wa and Ah-RU-NE-Pet.
