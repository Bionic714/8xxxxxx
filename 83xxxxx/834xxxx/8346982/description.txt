On April 1st, 2010, Kerry Cassidy, a co-founder of Project Camelot, interviewed Ashayana Deane in what was initially expected to be a 2- to 3-hour interview. What actually occurred was an incredible 8-hour co-creation and exchange that encapsulated the body of work known as Keylontic Science in a brilliantly sequenced, stepped-down framework that has been titled the Realities of Ascension. Ashayana distills information from at least 10 years of transmissions from the Guardian Alliance (brought through using electronic data-streaming, not channeling) into a beautifully sequenced, graph-assisted lecture that covers a huge range of topics, revealing the order, mechanics, and intricate structure inherent to natural organic Creation, the context within which either Ascension or Fall occurs, and the truth about the self-serving aliens associated with the Fall Systems. There is information on 15-Dimensional Universal structure; Re-evolutionary Determinism; the God-Source Consciousness Field; the Eckashi Expansion of consciousness; Hara Bodies; Time Vectors; Event Horizons; the Core, Inner, Middle, and Outer reality field Domains (each with their unique states of matter and consciousness); the Eyughas; the KaLE-Yugha turn-around (also called the Adashi turn-around or Krystar turn-around); the Adashi Return Cycles of Ascension; and the three paths of the Kryst ΓÇö Ascension, the KaLE-RAma Step-back, and the KaLE-DEma Kryst Fall. Other topics include the audible sound tones of Creation and the origin of the word KRYST; the ElumΓÇÖEir-adhona Spirit Body and its Na-VA-Ho Core Flows, which represent a number of ancient planetary Interface Gate ΓÇ£rescueΓÇ¥ systems; the Fallen Amenti Star-Gate System (the majority of which currently opens into Fallen Black Hole Systems); the association between the kinds of DNA activation and Interface Gate passage; the false Ascension programs found throughout todayΓÇÖs New Age Movement; and Fallen Thothian Death Star mechanics. The interview also covers important information on the difference between Living ShaLAah ΓÇ£LightΓÇ¥ and finite Sho-Na ΓÇ£Light,ΓÇ¥ and distinguishes between Death Star mechanics and the eternal-life Kathara Grid Template mechanics in Keylontic Science, comparing the configuration of the natural Yan-Yun Flows within living solar systems (that carry our natural ΓÇ£solar symbiosisΓÇ¥) to the distorted yin-yang flows (and associated vesica piscis phase-lock) in our Solar System, with its 23.5-degree tilt (and wobble).
