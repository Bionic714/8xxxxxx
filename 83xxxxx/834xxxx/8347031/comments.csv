Could you upload The Hunt for Red October (1990) in 1080p?"
,ectoendomezo,2013-04-06T19:35Z,"Hey Alright! Thanks.

Good Selection my current file is a 700mg crunchy one so Graci!

So now the request thing:

Classics that are either Not Available on TPB Or are 'Under Represented' especially in the '1.5 - 3 Gig' range aka ""Collectible"":

1) 'Shakes The Clown' (does not exist at this time as a torrent and that is a real testimonial to the reality of global 'culture')

2) 'Rolling Thunder' (classic with great character actors and leads too)

3) 'Brown's Requiem' (a great sleeper written by James Elroy starring all manner of damn fine actors/actresses and this ALSO does not exist as a torrent currently well..only in German)

Thanks for anything you can do..truly would appreciate these being added to the global library."
