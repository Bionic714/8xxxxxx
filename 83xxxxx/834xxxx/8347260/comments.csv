The sound quality is very, very good, however, and I'm certain you wouldn't be able to tell the difference.  The first 16 songs come from the actual CD.  The other source is his box set Just Yesterday (FLAC).
I don't actually like live songs too much, but the 2 included live songs sound great.    
I am just learning Tag & Rename, so any mistakes are mine. "
,WasAtWoodstock,2013-04-06T21:42Z,"I gather what you mean is the first 15, plus 17 are ripped from your CD. Correct? And they are your rips?

I don't know what FLAC level you are ripping at, but you should be ripping at Level 8, which is sometimes called Best. The other levels rip faster, but with today's computers the difference in time is minimal.

How are you finding Tag&Rename? There are multiple ways of doing things. I like embedded art. To not confuse myself I went to View -> Toolbars -> Folder Cover Art and turned it off. Then only File Cover Art appears. And I added a column that shows the art in each track."
,Rialta1,2013-04-07T02:32Z,"The first 16, which come from Al Stewart's Greatest Hits (Remastered 2004), only the ones mentioned are (were) MP3, and the rest were from his 2005 Box Set.  Box Sets/Greatest Hits always leave off important tracks.   Very frustrating.   

I don't know how to sequentially number tracks automatically.  I had to go through each track and number them.  Frustrating at first but I'll get it.  "

Anyway, I'l encode at FLAC 8 from now, it was at FLAC 5."
