In the spring of 1958 I made a concert tour through most of western Europe which was called "An Evening with Ella Fitzgerald and the Oscar Peterson Trio". It never occurred to me to record the concert in Europe as I had done for so many years with Jazz At The Philharmonic in America. Fortunately, a rabid jazz fan in Amsterdam recorded the concert that I presented at the Concertgebouw and afterwards presented me with the tapes. On these tapes is some of the most exciting jazz, and certainly the most exciting trio music that I've heard in years. This album is the best of that taped concert at the Concertgebouw as played by the Oscar Peterson Trio (with Ray Brown on bass and Merb Ellis on guitar), and if your tastes in jazz lie in hard, emotional, and exciting directions, then this is your album.
