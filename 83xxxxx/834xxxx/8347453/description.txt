----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cowabunga, dude! The Turtles are back. Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael and
Michelangelo are four mutant turtles, trained in the art of "ninjutsu"
by their sensei, Master Splinter. The animated series explores their
camaraderie as they learn to rely on one another as they unravel the
mystery of their existence and train to become the heroes they are
destined to be. And they're doing all that while trying to defeat
Master Shredder, an old enemy of Splinter who is training a peculiar
band of ninjas while hiding in New York City. When they are in the
surface world, the Turtles become involved in a conspiracy involving
alien creatures, robotic droids and missing scientists. And they come
face to face with the glowing green substance that originally mutated them.
