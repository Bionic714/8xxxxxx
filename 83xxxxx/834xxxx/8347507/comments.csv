Since you've been so awesome uploading Image comics, do you have Youngblood 77?  Thanks."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-07T04:50Z,"did you get it in one of those 3-pack comics that were sold at drug stores and odd places that didn't usually have new comics? if so, i think i did, too!"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-07T04:54Z,and i can't find youngblood 77. it's entirely possible that it still hasn't been scanned. i'll keep an eye out for it.
,Nikoli1129,2013-04-07T06:38Z,"No, actually I got it at a grocery store rack back when I was really young.  I was into the Super Powers action figures and Batman was my favorite.  When I saw it at the grocery store I asked my mom and she bought it for me.  Little did I know what that would cause...

As to Youngblood 77, thanks for keeping an eye out."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-07T12:02Z,good memories!
,CbrBro,2013-04-08T02:07Z,"Thanks STFmaryville! Could you give me some advice on anonymity for uploading torrents I was gonna upload some higher quality scans than some on here ex. Venom, etc but it seems a little scary :c."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-08T14:02Z,"CbrBro, i'm not very concerned with my own anonymity. my philosophy is that if someone really wants to find me, they'll find me.

however, a lot of people who upload torrents here on TPB just check the box marked ""Anonymous"" and that changes the ""By:"" field on a page to not show your user ID (like this one, scroll to the top & you'll see ""By: STFmaryville"").

you can always check the forums for more info, and discuss it with people with much more technical knowledge than i have. a good thread i found in this vein was:
