The .srt subtitles are a nice touch.

I am collecting & repacking your uploads, therefore I feel obligated to seed even longer than normal.

My compliments on the excellent and so far consistent quality, and thanks!

V:10 (I reserve 10s for when I am surprised)
A:9
M:6 (This episode was cheesier than a plain pizza... Still watched it!)"
