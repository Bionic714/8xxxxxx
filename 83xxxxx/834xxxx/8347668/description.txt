I have trouble seeding the original torrent, so I've reuploaded it here with different trackers, let's see if it goes better this time.
South Park Seasons 8,9,10,11,12 - High quality for all 70 episodes
Spoken language: Czech
Texted language: Czech
Excellent resource for Czech language learners to get acquainted with colloquial speech and slang!
Video format: mkv
Resolution: 720x576
In VLC media player:  
To activate the subtitles click on Video - Subtitles Track - the 2nd subtitles
I also have seasons 1-7 in Czech but the quality is not as good as in this torrent,
the resolution is only 576x432, all files are in avi, the audio is less clear and there are no subtitles. I can still upload them if anyone is interested, just drop a message in the comments.
