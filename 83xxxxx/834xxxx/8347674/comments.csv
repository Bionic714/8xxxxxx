,Hamster-X,2013-04-06T18:02Z,Thanks a lot STF! Was looking forward to this one. :)
,Calel1234,2013-04-06T23:29Z,"Thanks for the upload. Forgot about this series. This one is even stranger than the its predecessor. 

Btw, do you know what happened to Dan the Unharmable, Crossed #27, and Ferals? Reading the end of this comic just reminded me of Avatar's other ones. "
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-07T04:47Z,"you're both welcome. yeah Calel1234, it's pretty damn strange!

crossed badlands comes out every 2 weeks (at least for now) and so #27 isn't due until 4/10. dan the unharmable #12 is listed as the final-issue and a 5/29 release. and ferals #14 is set for 4/24."
,Calel1234,2013-04-07T05:28Z,"Thanks for update on everything. I just get antsy when I see the last page of Avatar comics advertising future releases. 

Btw, do you know what happened to Ferals 13?"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-07T12:01Z,"oh, i know what you mean. i check comiclist.com once or twice a week to see what is/will be out. another good resource is the online store at midtowncomics.com because they keep release dates updated.

anyway, #13 came out 2 weeks ago. i don't think it's been scanned yet. i think GreenManGroup-DCP has been doing that title, but who knows when a #13 .cbr will show up!"
