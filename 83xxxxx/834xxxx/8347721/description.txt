The patrimony of the extraordinary Irish civilization has been made available almost in its entirety for this exhibition. The profound feelings that the people of Ireland have for their treasures is something that we all understand, and their lending these precious possessions to us is an exceedingly generous act. It might never have transpired, but "Ireland ... is like not other place under heaven." George Bernard Shaw saw that the impossible in Ireland was an everyday occurrence. The impossible, therefore, has happened and is very welcome.
