"I have a proposition for you..". 
Kacey should have run the minute those words left Seattle millionaire Jake Titus's mouth. Instead, she made a deal with the devil in hopes of putting her past behind her once and for all. 
Four days. 
She could do four days! 
But she wasn't counting on JakeΓÇÖs older brother Travis being there to witness their farce of an engagement. 
One thing is for certain. 
One brother is right for her. 
One wants a lifetime. 
And one is in league with the devil. 
She should have gotten JakeΓÇÖs signature in blood.


Seed and Enjoy!
