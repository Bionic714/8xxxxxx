lack Market Music is the third studio album by English alternative rock band Placebo. It was released on 9 October 2000 through Hut Records. The album took nine months to record, the longest that the band have ever spent recording an album to date. It has sold over one million copies to date.
The album is dedicated to music publicist Scott Piering, who died of cancer in early 2000.[1] The song "Commercial for Levi" is a reference to the sound technician Levi Tecofski, who on one occasion saved frontman Brian Molko's life: Molko, drunk and about to cross the road, was quickly pulled back by Tecofski from the path of an approaching vehicle.
