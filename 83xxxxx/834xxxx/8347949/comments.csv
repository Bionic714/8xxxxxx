Thank You very much.  This may have taken months to put together."

Just curious !!"
,Rialta1,2013-04-07T02:22Z,"The torrent itself is the download, and when the torrent is finished, just add it to your client.  It's easy."
,wijagels,2013-04-20T23:34Z,"lmao. This is as large as my music collection is now!  If only I had a real NAS, this would be a new addition!"
,aildoux,2013-04-29T11:58Z,Wow... so much work.  Thanks a million!  I wonder what's the largest torrent out there.  Getting near the 100 Gigs with this one.  Some day a 1 TB will show up!
