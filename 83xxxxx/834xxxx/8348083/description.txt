This radio drama adation of J.R.R. Tolkien's 'The Hobbit' is an abridged full cast recording produced by The Mind's Eye (not to be confused with BBC's radio drama adaption from 1988). It has been made available by Jabberwocky, Soundelux and HighBridge Audio/HighBridge Company and was directed by Bob Lewis. This particular torrent is sourced from compact discs, though it has also been published on cassette tapes.

This torrent is sourced from the 2010 Wood Box CD publication by HighBridge Audio/HighBridge Company, though the images are probably sourced from the 2009 HighBridge publication.


A special thanks to rambam1776 for the FLAC rip and to Anonymous for the images. Converted and fixed by BogPojkin.


I made this because Anonymous' 320kbps torrent had broken files, missing some portions of the drama.
