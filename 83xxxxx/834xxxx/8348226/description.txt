Recently divorced no-nonsense lawyer Alex (Amanda Peet) hires contractor Pete (David Walton) to renovate her kitchen. An irresponsible womanizer, Pete is trying to rebuild his contracting career after ruining it with his gambling addiction and promiscuous ways. The highly strung Alex, whose husband was sent to prison for insider trading, is trying to maintain a busy work schedule while raising her 8-year-old daughter Charlie (Joey King). Aware of his reputation with women, Alex insists she will fire Pete if he presents any problems. Other cast members include Alex's flirty sister Screwsie (Margo Harshman), Pete's aspiring actor father Walt (Jeffrey Tambor), Charlie's babysitter Simone (Susan Park) and Pete's contractor crew (J.B.Jesse Plemons, and Pasha D. Lychnikoff).
