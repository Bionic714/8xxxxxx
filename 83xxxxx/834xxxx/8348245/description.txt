Toto IV is the fourth studio album by American band Toto released in 1982 .
The album received six Grammy Awards including Record of the Year for "Rosanna", Album of the Year and Producer of 
the Year for the band. It reached number four on the Billboard Pop Albums chart shortly after its release in 1982. 
The single "Rosanna" reached number two on the Billboard Hot 100, while the album's third single, "Africa", became 
the group's only Hot 100 #1 hit. Both songs were smash hits in the UK as well, reaching no. 12 and no. 3 
respectively. "I Won't Hold You Back" came next and reached the top 10 in the USA and the top 40 in the UK. With the 
success of "Africa", the album climbed back into the top 10 in early 1983.
The album featured a stronger dose of the pop/hard rock/R&B-fusion that had characterized their self-titled first 
album than had been heard on their previous two albums
