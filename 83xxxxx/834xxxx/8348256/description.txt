Hi All.

i have reworked this movie with a new audio line from another title with bad bad bad video, i have scrubbed the audio and video the best i could, trimmed the audio down of the english version as the dutch video had a 3 minute scene missing i had to accommodate for and every 14-18 minutes audio gaps were existent for some reason i had to cull back the whole audio line. video is pretty steady except for a couple of seconds here and there with either a angle drop or some goose walking past. my main goal was to complete a watchable cam with working audio and it came out really good for the most part the only thing i could not improve on was the brightness flashes in some scenes soooory =). 

quality rating would be about

Video - 7 maybe 6 1/2
Audio - 7 

English Language

overall a watchable copy until a better bray copy gets released.

enjoy all
