SEEDBOX SUPPORTED!!

In this case, I found the user review much more descriptive than the IMDB one:

"This film is a breath of fresh air and among genre films I've seen this year, 
you won't find any better."

"October and Russell are an estranged son and father (respectively), coming 
together (what seems like) for the first time in quite some time. A weekend out 
in the woods to repair bonds gets off on the wrong foot when Russell hastily 
puts down the family dog despite the efforts of October to save him. Clearly 
this a family at odds and something darker is lurking within their souls."

"The weekend to reconnect carries on and October and Russell head out to the 
neighboring woods which surround Russell's home. But things quickly derail when 
Russell sees a strange figure in the woods and steps off a cliff and breaks his 
leg. October finds him and drags him to safety."

"The remainder of our film involves father and son stranded in the woods, trying 
to reconnect, but with the ever present threat of something lurking, out there 
to get them should they try and escape the confines. Flashbacks clue us in as to 
what exactly happened to this family. And as the final denouement hits, our film 
ends in terrifying fashion as two worlds collide and our monsters make the men 
face their greatest fears."

"With fantastic performances all around (both Sean Elliott and genre vet Lance 
Henriksen shine), you won't find a better genre feature this year. The film will 
wear on your psyche and stay with you for days. Highly recommended."

Hey, it's got Lance Henriksen!  Ya can't go wrong!

Enjoy!
