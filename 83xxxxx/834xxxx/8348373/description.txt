Midnight Serenaders

Proving that hot jazz and vintage pop of the 1920ΓÇÖs and 30ΓÇÖs is as relevant as ever in the present day, the Midnight Serenaders provide an infectious and irreverent take on the raucous and carefree music of ΓÇ£The Jazz Age.ΓÇ¥ The band formed in 2005, putting together a sound reminiscent of the small swing combos popular during the 20ΓÇÖs and 30ΓÇÖs, adding a Hawaiian flavor with the inclusion of ukulele and Hawaiian Steel guitar, with lots of clarinet and muted trumpet. Led by the charming frontline of crooner/rhythm guitarist Doug Sammons and ukelele-strumming chanteuse Dee Settlemier, the Serenaders' repertoire consists of specially chosen gems from the past, as well as vintage sounding original songs. The Midnight Serenaders are based in Portland, Oregon and perform at clubs and events throughout the Pacific Northwest, continuing to delight audiences with their brand of hot retro swing.
