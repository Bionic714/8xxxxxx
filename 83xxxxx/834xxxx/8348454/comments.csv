,FureeTutawk,2013-04-07T03:36Z,"Download and install went smoothly, except it was in Russian I guess, but gave the option to install in English. Unfortunately, the install continued to read in Russian and I unchecked things which seemed to be standard questions i usually say ""no"" to like ""desktop shortcut"" because those checkboxes seemed to be appearing in those kinds of locations during the installation. Because it came with direct x installs and other things, I also kept unchecking the preselected boxes for things which seemed to be wanting permission for that, because I have had problems in the past with old games .. and new ones.. wanting to install different versions of direct x and other elements even though I am up to date and then conflicts happen and I don't need to have so many versions of everything. Once, I had 7 different versions of direct x installed on my pc all from different games.

So here is the problem: When I try to run it, a popup says ""The procedure point GetFileInformationByHandleEx could not be located in the dynamic link library KERNEL32.dll.

I doubt it has to do with the two checkboxes I unchecked from their default condition of being selected, but if so, which one should I select (the Russian language if printed here, I can read and compare to the Russian on the install window)

Or, if it is due to something else, what would it be?

,Poldozzz,2013-04-07T16:43Z,"I installed as the picture said but when i run the game the words are all like this ""???????"".. i can't read anything. Is there some kind of patch or somenthing??"
,Toperharrier,2013-04-11T00:06Z,"@FureeTutawk Newer directx versions installed does not meet the req for older version from other games. Dx libraries are not acumulative, so sorry to say, but your supposed version conflicting resumes to you not allowing them to be installed."

,Toperharrier,2013-04-11T23:31Z,@Polishmafia You may need steam to be installed. Couldnt say if theres a way to bypass it just copying  the file as I already had steam installed.
