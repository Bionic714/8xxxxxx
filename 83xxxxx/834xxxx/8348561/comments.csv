,DjEj1201,2013-04-11T20:57Z,Why are these in Mkv files? I cant open them. They wont open with anything I have. Can you upload them as avi or mp4 file?
,xevilx,2013-04-13T21:18Z,@DjEj1201 ever heard of VLC?
,DjEj1201,2013-04-14T17:27Z,No. Whats VLC
,DjEj1201,2013-04-14T17:30Z,No. Whats VLC. Ok so I looked it up but why should I have to convert why cant the uploader just convert them to mp4 files before they uplod them so I don't have to. Much easier. I don't have time for that stuff

,evilkumquat,2013-04-21T18:10Z,"Really, @DjEj1201?

The uploader is gracious enough to upload these shows and you're complaining about the file format?

MKV are pretty much the defacto format for high-def, especially since multiple audio and subtitles can be encoded within, perfect for those streaming the video to their televisions through their PC or PS3.

If you want these in a lower-quality AVI, why don't YOU download the video from iTunes or capture from satellite instead of complaining like a spoiled infant?"
,DjEj1201,2013-04-26T06:40Z,"Why you being so rude? I just dont understand why everyone cant upload into AVI than everyone can play them? Im not being a spoiled infant, I just dont understand if its so easy then to reformat it then why couldnt the uploader do it. By the way TY uploader for uploading it. Im not ungrateful I just dont know how to reformat it. I dont have access to satelite or Itunes or I would not be on here now would I? Im not in the US and I dont have access to much. This is as far as I have learned in the torrent world it is not my fault I dont know all this stuff. There is no directions that come with this, so why the name calling"
,bran2k,2013-04-26T13:48Z,We Prefer MKV. You are out voted so drop it
,DjEj1201,2013-06-04T05:48Z,why would you perfer something that doesnt work?  Instead of you being so rude why dont you tell me how to convert it. ive tried every converter there is and i cant find one that works. which one do you recomend.
