The problem with arguments for God is that the idea of proving the existence of God through philosophical/logical arguments is fundamentally flawed. Imagine arguing for the existence of anything else that way - i.e without any physical evidence either way and without the testimony of witnesses, whether current or historical. So why do I believe? I believe that Christianity is unique among world religions in having documents (i.e historical records) that are demonstrably as reliable as anything else we have from the classical period of history. These give evidence of Jesus and his resurrection - which goes to the existence of the God he spoke of. It is common to dismiss these as myth, but you must then dismiss all historical documents of the period, as they are no better attested, and often far worse. Unbiased treatment of the New testament documents, just as we would any other from the period, is key."
