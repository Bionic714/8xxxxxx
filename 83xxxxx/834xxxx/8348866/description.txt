Comments:
throughout show, mics/pick-up's are being turned on and turned off in the mix with variations in crowd noise 
noticeable between songs.  these are not extraction errors or sector boundary errors.  they can also be heard 
on 3-16-94.

d1t02 @ 00:40 - brief static.  smokin' althea.  the unforgivable post UJB-Jam fadeout suggests probable boot 
ancestry.
