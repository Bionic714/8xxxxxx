The Nuclear Weapons disposal facility on Shadow Moses Island
in Alaska's Fox Archipelago was attacked and taken over by
Next Generation Special Forces, being lead by members of Fox
Hound.

They're currently demanding that the government of the
United States turn over the remains of Big Boss and they say
if their demand is not met within 24 hours, they'll launch a
nuclear weapon.

Solid Snake (you) has two mission objectives. The first is
to rescue the DARPA's chief, Donald Anderson, and the
President of Armstech, Kenneth Baker. Both are being held as
hostages. Secondly, Snake has to investigate whether or not
the terrorists have the ability to make a nuclear strike,
and stop them if they do.
