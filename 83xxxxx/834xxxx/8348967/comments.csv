Please stop spamming your YouTube channel.

@everyone else:
This is an untouched ""0-day"" scene release. As such, it is double packed. There are 8 zip files. Each contains 1 rar file. The rar files together contain ""setup-1.bin"" and ""setup.exe"" (the mushroom icon). If it is broken, then you likely forgot to extract a rar file. Remember that there should be 8 rar files (.rar, .r00-.r06).

Also, the game is multi-langauge: English, French, German. You can change it in the game's options."
