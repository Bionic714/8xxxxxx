The most important part of any WipEout title is the smoothness of the experience. WipEout HD delivers in spades, running at a blistering 60 frames-per-second at any resolution, including 1080p. Playing like a half-roller-coaster-slash-half-combat racer, you're able to weave in and out of turns like a bobsled with a rocket affixed to its back. The controls are tied directly to the framerate and are immensely responsive. It's the perfect combination of dead-on controls and complex raceways.
