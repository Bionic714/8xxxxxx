Frontman Brian Molko, who is known to be a fan of the band Sonic Youth,[11] was notably influenced by their album Sister while writing the lyrics for Sleeping with Ghosts; at least two of the songs feature references to lyrics from Sister[citation needed]: "Plasticine" ("Beauty lies inside the eye of another youthful dream" directly references "Beauty lies in the eyes of another's dream" from Sonic Youth's "Beauty Lies in the Eye") and "Sleeping with Ghosts".
