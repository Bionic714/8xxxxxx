Two unique story lines, challenging puzzles and fast-paced action
combine to create one of the most innovative RPG titles to date.
With two adventures to choose from, the game never gets dull as
new abilities are discovered and new scenarios are revealed.

Unique powers such as the ability to shape-shift and cast magic
spells can be tailored to specific situations. This lends an
unprecendented amount of gameplay to an already featured filled game.

Throw in a beautifully rendered 3D world, high-resolution graphics,
and fluid animations and you have a game that looks as good as it
plays.
