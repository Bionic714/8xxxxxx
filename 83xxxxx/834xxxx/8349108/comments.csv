,BUTT_SEX,2013-04-07T00:33Z,Yeah the scene people are fucking idiots. All adding the same exact torrent. They should focus more first on avi/xvid since it's more compatible and then release a x264 version. 
,BUTT_SEX,2013-04-07T01:04Z,"You know, one focuses on the 1080 and 720 HD release, another on the avi/xvid, and another on the MP4 x264 release. Etc etc."
,ent1718,2013-04-07T01:39Z,"Worked perfectly, and included all of the minutes! Thanks much!"
,DrTeeth707,2013-04-07T02:18Z,"@ BUTT SEX

Agree 110%"
,cuteycindyhoney,2013-04-07T03:29Z,"Thanks guys for the warning about missing minutes and Mork and Mindy! I'm half tempted to download that version anyway!
LOL!"
,cuteycindyhoney,2013-04-07T03:30Z,"Oh, and thank you for the upload, Drarbg! "
,DreamGoddessLindsey,2013-04-07T03:46Z,"Agreed, the ""scene"" people are a bunch of morons. I hate hipsters. Half the time, MP4s will not work on a media server to play on the PS3 on a television. It's aggravating. I always feel like I'm rolling dice. Why does no one post the episode in HD in AVI?"
,Harvey_P,2013-04-07T04:33Z,"100% Complete Torrent with Previews for next week at the end.

A/V: 10/!0

Thanks so much for uploading this one!"
,Harvey_P,2013-04-07T04:36Z,The last 3 minutes aren't missing from eztv's torrent if the file is played in VLC. 
,Tuckle,2013-04-07T04:56Z,"In regards to the AVI complaints.  AVI is an obsolete file type.  The quality is poor for a large file.  This as a 720p AVI would be nothing short of 1gb.  Eztv made the switch to mp4 a couple of years ago, ALL of their uploads will be mp4.  Other scenes will post .mkv files, which are even better than mp4.  They boast high compression rates, high quality, and smaller file sizes.  

As far as compatibility goes, the 3 'main' media players (windows, VLC and media player classic) have no issues with mkv or mp4.  My playstation also has no issues playing 99% of these files, provided it is updated.  
If you're still having issues, you can always run a cable from your PC to PS3 and stream (or use wireless).  
Not too sure what mp4s have to do with hipsters.  If anything, wouldn't they be trying to hold on to the 'retro' feel of xvid rips?

As a final note, stop complaining.  You are getting a FREE show from people who spend their time putting it up.  If you really want an xvid version so badly, there are about 100 free programs that will do it, or you could UPLOAD IT YOURSELF...."
,Death2Dipshits,2013-04-07T05:26Z,"Tuckle, MKv doesn't work on ps3 & I'm not running a cable anywhere, then again I'm not complaining."
,MyKrossini,2013-04-07T06:08Z,"Thanks Drarbg for the excellent upload. I appreciate it. As for the format, why would anyone want to go back in time (as far as video formats are concerned) to an inferior format? x264 provides you with much better quality at the same size as an avi/xvid file and it is faster to convert to whatever format you like. This is what's happening. Get used to it. If you don't like it, take the 10 minutes to convert the file then re-upload it AGAIN in some other format. Thanks again!"
,lordquilton,2013-04-07T06:57Z,"MyKrossini is right; in the time it takes for people like BUTT_SEX to bitch about nothing, I just converted this very episode to xvid. Literally less than 5 minutes.
Like my grandad used to say- ""some people would complain if their ass was on fire."""

,dreamwar17,2013-04-07T19:46Z,"fleckn is wright, this episode is cheesed up to sky heaven, didnt know to barf or to shit myself in tears  from watchin it :D"
,cuteycindyhoney,2013-04-08T23:39Z,"Personally, I thought it was a great episode. I loved the Doctor's monolog to the ""Old God"". "
