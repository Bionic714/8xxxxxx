,viktorbir,2013-04-06T22:34Z,It's missing the last three minutes.
,slendrman,2013-04-06T22:43Z,"Yes as stealforgedinfate said it cuts of the end. So I caution you before you download this. Hopefully the eztv team can fix this. First ""bad"" torrent I have had from them. Other then that small error.

A 10/10

,Gryph_on,2013-04-07T01:21Z,Well that was an abrupt ending. Eztv failed me. I never thought it would happen!
,ZakMarcus,2013-04-07T04:12Z,First time I've ever been let down by eztv. Should have read the comments before downloading and watching. 
[T],k3nd00d,2013-04-07T06:08Z,The FOV release is good. This one needs to be nuked.
