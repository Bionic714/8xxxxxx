As far as I can tell, you are one of only two people who have posted any Rolex racing over the last season+, and the other guy told me he wasn't planning on posting any more (although, since he told me that, he posted both Daytona & Austin)."
,arctictpb,2013-04-07T06:46Z,"@ drew1972  - I really wish I was going to be able to post all the GrandAm Rolex and Continental races.  Right now I am not getting consistent high quality HD feeds of either at the moment.  I really want to and if I do I will keep posting them.  My capping partner who took care of all the IRL and GrandAm races quit and I am trying to find someone to replace him.  I am a big fan myself of AMA, MotoGP, WSBK, GrandAm, and IRL and will post as much racing as I can."
,drew1972,2013-04-07T13:48Z,"My fingers are crossed!  I'm also a huge fan of road racing of just about every type:  F1, GP2, GP3, Formula Renault, WSBK, MotoGP, Moto2, Moto3, Grand-Am, ALMS, IndyCar, V8 Supercars, etc.  I probably watch too much, and I always want more, hence my nagging you a little too much.  Thank you for your efforts, and here's hoping we can both watch Rolex racing this year."
