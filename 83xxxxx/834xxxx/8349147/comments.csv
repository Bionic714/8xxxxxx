Thank you dodekaeder!

Perhaps some of you are not familiar with the use of these things (I recall my initial wonderment and frustration when first learning this stuff), and so I will give a brief description of the steps involved in making it all work together.

The torrent downloaded to its own folder named ""Corel Draw X6 x64,"" which contained a single file: ""CorelDRAWGraphicsSuiteX6Installer_EN64Bit.exe,"" and a single subfolder named ""KeyGen 64 bit"" that contained another single file named ""keygen64bit.exe"" and that's it. Two files, total.

Disabled my internet connection.

Fired up the keygen, and selected the program and version (which was at the very bottom of the list), and it promptly generated a serial.

Ran the executable to install the program, punched in the serial I had just generated, and everything was happy and functioning.

Opened up the program via the new icon on my desktop and it advised of a trial period which will expire soon enough. Told it I wanted to activate it and went the phone route.

Back to the keygen to punch in the program-generated Installation Code and it promptly produced an Activation Code.

Back to the program to punch the Activation Code into the waiting empty box, and the program immediately thanked me for my purchase and sent me on my way.

Thanks again to the nice people at CORE who produced the keygen, and also to dodekaeder for uploading a clean copy!
