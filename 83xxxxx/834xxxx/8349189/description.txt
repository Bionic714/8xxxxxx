To finish I suggest you play 1680x1050 or 1920x1080 resolution because if you decide to play in a lower resolution than 1680x1050 you can not see the HUD displayed correctly "Makckey" locate at the top left of your screen,I check myself playing a lower resolution and the HUD becomes inactive unfortunately I have not had time to check what it could induce slight problem but I will keep you informed once corrected.

As of version 1.07b of DMX 1.3.4 you can post your error log to bring the
Necessary adjustments that permettras of improved and make the mod more stable.
