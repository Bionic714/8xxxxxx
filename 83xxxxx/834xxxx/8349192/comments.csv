,BUTT_SEX,2013-04-07T00:45Z,Everyone downloading this and not a single person can come back and fucking comment how this file is missing the last 3 minutes and keeps cutting out to an episode of Mork and Mindy? Jesus fucking christ!
,Bsrkr,2013-04-07T01:01Z,"Yeah wait for a ""REPACK"""
,ss4johnny,2013-04-07T03:00Z,"@BUTT_SEX, I certainly didn't notice anything missing. Went back and checked and it still has the clip for the next episode."
,kitrana,2013-04-07T03:50Z,it does seem to be missing the last couple of minutes
,willis245,2013-04-07T04:18Z,"I just went to the end of t he file and it seems to show ad for next episode, seems complete to me."
,Harvey_P,2013-04-07T04:35Z,"If you think the last 3 minutes are missing, try watching on VLC player. 

If you are still having problems, this torrent was perfect (A/V: 10/10): http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8349108/Doctor.Who.2005.S07E07.The.Rings.of.Akhatenn.REPACK.HDTV.x264-TL

Great-ish episode!"
,iratethep,2013-04-07T09:42Z,"Proper file naming is S07E07, not 7x07.

Start doing it properly, so we don't have to make multiple searches to find what we need, and so it doesn't get all fucked up, once there are more than 9 seasons."
,McEllis82,2013-04-07T10:47Z,"Actually this is episode 8 you have to count the Christmas special so proper naming of this file is ""Doctor Who 2005 7x07"""
,McEllis82,2013-04-07T10:47Z,"I mean ""Doctor Who 2005 7x08"" SMH"
,Tsetsu,2013-04-07T11:49Z,"Those complaining obviously have this upload confused with the previous.

This is the repacked version of the errored version uploaded by eztv earlier.

The last three minutes as well as previews for the next episode (which looks equally as terrible) are in tact.

There are no Mork and Mindy cuts.

Audio: 10
Video: 10
Episode: 4 (Lost its way at the end with some increased overacting from everyone and a horrible plot twist.  But Clara's hot, the Doctor's on cue being the Doctor - unless the writers tell him otherwise, the melodies were nice, and there's even a tantalizing reference to the first seasons of the original Doctor Who)"
,BoonesFerry,2013-04-07T12:05Z,"NUKED (bad): Doctor Who 2005 S07E07 The Rings of Akhatenn HDTV x264-TLA 
REASON: missing last four minutes
SUCCESSOR (good): Doctor Who 2005 7x07 The Rings Of Akhaten HDTV x264-FoV"
,iratethep,2013-04-07T13:54Z,"No, McEllis, you don't count the christmas episode. That's a special, and is counted seperately."
,sabbalo,2013-04-07T19:18Z,"Thanks man, I've been looking forward to this. "
[V],albiondean,2013-04-07T22:45Z,"Your all wrong, this is Series 7 Part 2 episode 2."
,Durk_Who,2013-04-08T02:18Z,"I don't know what everyone is bitching about. Quality and sound were fantastic, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with this download. Just another normal eztv download, right as rain as always. I am actually a bit disappointed it wasn't messed up like some of you claim. I didn't get Mork and Mindy, and honestly I love that show and would have laughed my ass off if that was indeed the case. However it is not,. this download is 100% genuine, matched perfectly with exactly what was aired, and is high quality. So maybe check and make sure it was not you who screwed up before blaming the uploader, cause this download is in a sense, perfect"
,pvnrt4,2013-04-14T09:25Z,A 10/ V 10 Thank you EZTV
