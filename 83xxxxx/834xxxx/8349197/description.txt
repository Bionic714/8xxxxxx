
We, Sky Swallows Challenger stand for the world wide extension project, derived from the local performing Romanian rock band, called Halat Alb.

The brand has a new formula ( another guitar player joining the three founding members ) and we can finally extend our musical boundaries and start experimenting even more than before, trying to blend originality with innovation, working hard to come up with something new and exciting.

"Align To Collide" is our latest release. Many thanks to  Supersize Recording, HU for their support. Enjoy!
