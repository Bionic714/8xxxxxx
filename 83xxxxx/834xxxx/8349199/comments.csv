,iratethep,2013-04-07T09:41Z,"Proper file naming is S07E07, not 7x07.

Start doing it properly, so we don't have to make multiple searches to find what we need, and so it doesn't get all fucked up, once there are more than 9 seasons."
,christti,2013-04-07T11:29Z,"Thank eztv.

Btw, i always search the files like 7x07, no S07E07. But both ways are fine."
,notalp42,2013-04-07T12:16Z,Thank you. So much!
,iratethep,2013-04-07T13:53Z,"No, both are not fine. It should be consistent, and 7x07 becomes a problem, once there are more than 9 seasons, since they will no longer be sorted in the correct order, so only right thing, is to keep with the standard s07e07."
,PteCrash,2013-04-07T17:41Z,"@Iratethep, Why don't you just not complain. What kind of Whovian are you. Really? Really.

Eztv, Thank you for putting this up! Cheers."

,tanjapir,2013-04-07T22:18Z,"How abit a little less complaining about the naming of free stuff, if you dont like it, dont download it as a protest..

someone have spent their time making a torrent for you, you should ""say thank you, owe you 1"""
,ast03,2013-04-10T01:09Z,why the hell did none of you comment on the quality?
,ent1234,2013-04-12T04:37Z,"great quality, but chopped off the last 15 seconds.

This means you didn't get to hear the classic closing theme, and was the first time I've seen anyone chop off the closing theme to Doctor Who.

Saving 15 seconds of disk space isn't worth making it look and sound like an amateur hackjob.

Such a shame."
,Earthboundhero,2013-04-14T01:13Z,"I couldn't for the life of me get this torrent to work. I tried streaming to my Xbox. Nope. I tried using VLC Player nope. I used KM Player, it worked but audio was way off and I couldn't fix it. It's probably just my laptop, but I thought I should mention it."
