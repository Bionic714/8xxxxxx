Born out of the massive electro/punk cult group MINDLESS SELF INDULGENCE, the meat and two veg half of the band, JIMMY URINE and STEVE, RIGH? release their second album in a decade under the name THE LEFT RIGHTS. Jimmy and Steve make a collect phone call to god and smite the world with the album BAD CHOICES MADE EASY. As if things couldn't get worse with the recession and joaquin phoenix ΓÇª. the lead singles ΓÇ£WHITEΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£WHY YOU IN MY PHYZICALΓÇ¥ are better then The Beatles ...period! Don't argue with me. It's too immature for adults and too adult for children. Its the perfect Mother's Day gift.THE LEFT RIGHTS are the drug problems you're too afraid to admit you have, and the porn addiction you brag about . You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll kiss 10 bux goodbye! 41 tracks with songs including ΓÇ£YOUNG BLACK AND CONSTIPATEDΓÇ¥, ΓÇ£MAGIC BONEΓÇ¥, ΓÇ£FREE PORNΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£ASS IN MY FACEΓÇ¥ (parts 1 and 2...) will make you wanna shit your selfΓÇª.so just admit you have been beaten and submissively lay down and enjoy THE LEFT RIGHTS!!!
