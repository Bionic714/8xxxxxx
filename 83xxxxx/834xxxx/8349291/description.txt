After several over caffeinated, sleepdeprived days in a studio without an engineer to tell them that everything they were doing was wrong, Righ? & Urine (of Mindless Self Indulgence) created this album.

 They used a Pro Tools system as a tape recorder and recorded everything as left and right. No seperation of tracks. No mix down. No production whatsoever. What they ended up with was 39 tracks of fecally-obsessed children's music for adults and other such idiots.
