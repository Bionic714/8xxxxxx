                                 Release Notes

SEEDBOX SUPPORTED!!

A high stakes poker game. A drug lord. A million dollars. A set of ruthless 
killers who want it all. 

This was a great film with two exceptions: 1. There were a couple of parts in 
the film that just went white for half-a-second or so, like during a gunshot.  I 
don;t know whether this was planned, or somehow a workprint got released.  2.) 
Almost ten minutes of credits at the end moving so slowly my mother in her 
walker could pass them.  There is an Easter Egg after the credits so don't stop 
watching. 

The film is supposed to be 90 minutes according to IMDB, but this release is only
73 minutes hinting further at a workprint. 

The film overall had a lot of action and great acting, but the gunshot scenes 
were a little bit badly done with the CGI.  The plot and follow-through more 
than made up for that.  This film was professionally done.

The film is somewhat minimally halting, and I tried encoding at both 29.970 and 
the original frame rate of 29.000 but it made no difference.  It was that way on 
the web as well, so it's not on my end.  I just tried to fix it without success.

Enjoy it nonetheless!
