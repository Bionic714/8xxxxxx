2007 Transformers: Fre, Ger, Hun, Ita, Rus, Spa
2011 Transformers Dark Of The Moon: Fre, Por, Spa

you can download from my old torrent:
http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/6744810/Transformers_trilogy_%282007-2011%29_1080_multi_%5Bmkvonly%5D

Note that 
Transformers Revenge of the Fallen 2009 IMAX  is longer, that's why those tracks wouldn't be good.
Encodes from this torrent are slightly better then from old release, that's why I encoded them again.."
,karimbaraka,2013-04-08T07:31Z,Thanks
,joegi50,2013-04-13T07:24Z,Thanks. It is unnecessary to include samples because take longer to torrent. Thanks.

The sample is for ""size-queens"" who keep saying ""the bigger the better""...and 40 MB is peanuts,  also you don't heve to download it, just un-check it (in utorrent click on Files colomn/right-click on sample/select ""Don't download"".
You're welcome."
,joegi50,2013-04-14T17:46Z,"HighCode, thank you for everything you do."

A 8

Disappointing image quality. Graininess and aliasing present around edges, especially people's faces. Too much file space is wasted on subtitles in 28 languages."

You're full of shit. You forget something, people can compare the samples and will find out that you're a liar ;-)
Secondly the size of the subs is peanuts, altogether 43 MB and the 42 MB (VobSubs) nobody forces you to download. Lol, try again with better argument to put off people from downloading. "

Wow this is how you treat people? No, you're the one that's full of shit. If you don't like my honest rating that isn't 10 out of 10 you can try looking at real rips. Transformers is very high action, high CGI. Compare it to blu-ray, compare it to 10GB rips and you'll see yours falls flat. If you can't accept that, then you shouldn't be encoding."
