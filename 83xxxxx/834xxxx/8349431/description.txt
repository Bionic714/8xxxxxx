LEFT BEHIND AFTER THE RAPTURE

After the Rapture there will be many disasters, many deaths, and many, many will be left behind. 

GET READY NOW !

God has been very busy warning us through many means and signs (earthquakes, tsunamis, severe storms, etc.) and through many of His messengers. Still most are ignoring God's warnings and signs.

Children, your LORD has Words for you:
"There is a lot of turmoil about the day ahead. Some believe MY Coming is near. Not enough believe this. There are not enough who believe this. Many believe this world will sustain them into the future. They are not keeping their eyes fixed on ME. I am the ONLY ANSWER to a troubled worldΓÇöa deeply troubled world.

You need to prepare your hearts as the days are growing dark. It is no mistake that the human race is turning a cornerΓÇöheading into deep, dark depravity. I am not going to take out with ME rebellious children when I come for MY beautiful bride and I AM COMING!

These are the ones who will be the most, saddest: MY lukewarm church and those who lead them astray. Do not despair MY holy churchΓÇöthose who pursue me above all else: worldly pursuits; idols of the world; all the things that cause your heart to go astray.

The warnings are winding down, because MY Coming is close. Stop relying on your earthly gods to lead you. I am the ONE, TRUE, LOYAL GOD. Only those who are watching will come with ME. Church prepare: your salvation is at hand.
