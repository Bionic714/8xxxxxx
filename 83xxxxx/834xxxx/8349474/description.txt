Pablo Neruda (1904-1973) was a Chilean poet, diplomat and politician who Gabriel García Márquez once called "the greatest poet of the 20th century in any language." Neruda won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1971. The following four bilingual editions are included here:

  ISBN: 1556590415 | 74 pages | Bilingual edition | PDF

  In "The Book of Questions", completed only months before his death in 1973, Neruda refuses to be corralled by the rational mind. Composed of unanswerable questions, these poems integrate the wonder of a child with the experiences of an adult. By turns Orphic, comic, surreal, and poignant, Neruda's questions lead the reader beyond reason into realms of intuition and pure imagination.


Pablo Neruda - The Captain's Verses, trans. Donald D. Walsh (New Directions Press, 1972).

  ISBN: 9780811218214 | 160 pages | Bilingual edition | PDF

  Neruda finished writing "The Captain's Verses" in 1952 while in exile on the island of Capri -- the paradisal setting (islands of Procida and Salina) of the Academy-Award-winning film Il Postino. Surrounded by the natural splendor of Capri, Neruda addressed these poems of love, ecstasy, devotion, and fury to his lover, Matilda Urrutia. Later the same year, Neruda published "The Captain's Verses" anonymously in an edition of fifty copies, fourteen years before he and Matilde legally married. The first "acknowledged" edition would not appear until 1963. This complete, bilingual collection has become a classic for love struck readers around the world -- passionate, sensuous, and burning with all the erotic energy of a new love.


Pablo Neruda - Twenty Love Poems and a Song of Despair, trans. W. S. Merwin (Penguin, 2004).

  ISBN: 9780142437704 | 112 pages | Bilingual edition | PDF

  First published in 1924, "Veinte poemas de amor y una canción desesperada" remains among Pablo Neruda's most popular work. Daringly metaphorical and sensuous, this collection juxtaposes youthful passion with the desolation of grief. Drawn from the poet's most intimate and personal associations, the poems combine eroticism and the natural world with the influence of expressionism and the genius of a master poet. This edition features the newly corrected original Spanish text, with masterly English translations by award-winning poet W. S. Merwin on facing pages.
