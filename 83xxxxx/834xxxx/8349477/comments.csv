[V],TorDigger,2013-04-07T07:23Z,"@ pattyo41: it works great, copy and paste kegen to installation directory, run keygen and click on ""patch+genrate"", now write your name in the blank box of keygen and click again ""patch+genrate"" it will give you code, now register application with given name and key, Done."

 and it worked fine, i just wasn't filling in my name
 after clicking on the patch, keep up the good work,
 and a big thanks again"
