Tabatha kicks off season five when she visits the up and coming area of East Nashville, Tennessee where celebrity stylist Tanzy Clark WrightΓÇÖs salon Mogulz is in a tizzy. Although Tanzy has been a pillar of her African-American community for years, she has struggled to evolve her business to attract the diverse clientele that now inhabit the booming area. Not only has the salon fallen out of touch with the community, the pregnant shopaholic Tanzy has lost her drive, her money and control of her staff. To save TanzyΓÇÖs salon, Tabatha must get her to step up, be responsible and lead her and her staff to embrace the diverse wave of the future.
