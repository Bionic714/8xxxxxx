The first 25 years of Castlevania games on every console and platform it was published/ported. These are the English variants whenever an English version was released. Also included are direct spin-off games and a number of games in which a castlevania hero is a playable character or makes an appearance. Literally thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of playtime hours would be required to play though all of these. Enjoy and please seed this for posterity.
