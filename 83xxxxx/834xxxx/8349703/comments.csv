You are the best and you know that…
I have a question: many of NTSC movies don’t have English subtitles. Could you tell me why? Thanks."

Why many of NTSC movies don’t have English subtitles, i can't tell u exactly, i think it is the region where there com from.

But most NTSC have English SDH subtitles.

And i am not the best, i try to give the best i can make and hope people like it.
Rebuilding DVDR is complex and a hard job and i am learing every day. The best DVDR rebuilders are from scene releases i think.
I do it my own way, and my DVDR's are just fine."
