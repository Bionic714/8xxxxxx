,tomahawk_dts,2013-04-07T22:06Z,"@Mr.Stifmeister: well now I'm curious, why would someone make a crack that looks like a trojan? Must be someone very stupid. Or your reasoning has some gaps?"
,xSandrex,2013-04-08T02:36Z,"@tomahawk_dts: Most keygens, cracks and patches are detected as trojans by your antivirus program just because of cooperation between commercial software companies and antivirus software manufacturers.

Do you think cracks are legal?

,FSXNebdeath,2013-04-08T22:33Z,"tomahawk_dts It's because it's what's called a ""false positive"" but why am i explaining anything to your almighty reasoning and superior intelligence? Cuz all of that only exists in your own mind. You're the most laughable kind of noob and trust me... anyone that read your comments doesn't have to read mine to see what a douche you are!!! lololololololololol"
,sircuncid,2013-04-22T09:18Z,"setup.exe is not working, I get a message that says: ""The setup files are corrupted, please obtain a new copy of the program""
Any ideas why? btw, the file did not download as an .iso, it was just folders and files.
Thank you"
,sircuncid,2013-04-22T09:30Z,"setup.exe isn't working. It says that the files are corrupted and that I should replace the program.
Any ideas"
