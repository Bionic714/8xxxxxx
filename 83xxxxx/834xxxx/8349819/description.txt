 NOTE:
=======

Serbian-born Ana Popovic, one of the most lauded blues guitarists on the circuit, moved to Memphis to capture the cities' greasy Stax sound, record at Ardent Studios, and play with its finest musicians.
 Her new LP "Can You Stand The Heat" is out April 16th.
 A passionate student of the blues, this is equally inspired by Albert King and WAR.
 She belts from the gut and shreds her StratΓÇªin a pair of high heels.

"Can You Stand The Heat" is the follow-up to Ana's 2011 album, "Unconditional", which was nominated for two Blues Music Awards and landed in the top 15 of Guitar World's top Blues and Roots Rock Albums.
 "Heat" was co-produced by long-time BB King drummer Tony Coleman, GRAMMY-winner Tommy Sims and Ana.

"Can You Stand The Heat" was recorded at Ardent Studios in Memphis and features a crack band of some of Memphis' finest players including John Williams on bass (Al Green), Harold Smith on rhythm guitar (BB King All Star Band), The Bo-Keys on horns, Tony Coleman on drums and a guest appearance by Lucky Peterson on "Hot Southern Night".

Tracks like the sultry "Boys Night Out" and her take on a deep Rolling Stones cut "Rain Fall Down" and Robert Palmer's "Every Kind Of People" crank up the thermostat on old school blues and funk in the vein of Albert King, Albert Collins and WAR. The album also includes a sweltering cover of Albert King's classic "Can't You See What You're Doing To Me".

Ana was born in Belgrade and quickly took to the guitar at 15 after uncovering her father's impressive collection of blues and soul records. She's turned heads at festivals around the world, shared stages with Buddy Guy, BB King and Taj Mahal, and has been nominated for a total of four Blues Music Awards.
