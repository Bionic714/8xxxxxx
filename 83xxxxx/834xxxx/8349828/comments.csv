,CallOfKtulu666,2013-04-18T08:16Z,Why say it's in English when it isn't? It might get you more downloads but in the long run it will make everyone stop trusting you
,gotdeadmansluck,2013-04-20T05:13Z,What the fuck.....Why is this in Russian man had to get VLC like ninjan8 suggested which did solve the problem but man I mean put that in the title so we don't have to fucking download a piece of software just to have it in english I would be pissed but seeing how the problem was solved I'm only a moderately pissed...

,Zielregen,2013-05-21T22:22Z,"Pressing ""B"" and ""V"" on your keyboard will cycle through the audio and subtitle tracks in VLC. 
Just because you can't figure out how something works doesn't mean theres something wrong with it. "
,huggy2013,2013-06-07T19:05Z,if you wanna get rid of the stupid dubbing for good covert the avi file to MP4 using Handbrake. Select audio track 1. It take about 20 mins to convert all episodes
