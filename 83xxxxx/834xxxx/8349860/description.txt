Atlas Drugged

ItΓÇÖs a murderous level of muscle burn when a champion bodybuilder is found drugged and baked to death on a sunbed. 

ThereΓÇÖs a bulging mass of suspects: an overshadowed brother, a jealous rival, a devoted trainer and a long time grudge-holder. The mystery deepens when Charlie is attacked, and the main suspect disappears. 

As Nicola and Charlie cleverly piece together the truth through misplaced weights, fake-tan stains and Sylvester StalloneΓÇÖs arrest record, they end up face to face with a giant-killer in the creepiest of places ΓÇô the morgue.
