VALKYRIE PROFILE 2 - SILMERIA  [NTSC]
(English text, japanese audio)


{:}

Divine insurrection besieges the heavens. Invoking his power as king of the gods, Odin hastily reincarnates the spirit of the rebel valkyrie Silmeria into Alicia, Princess of Dipan. However, unbeknownst to Odin, the spirit of the battle maiden awakens within Alicia, still seeking vengeance.

Years pass. Believing his daughter to be possessed, King Barbossa of Dipan declares Alicia dead and exiles her to a faraway castle. Odin learns of Silmeria's awakening and dispatches the imperious Hrist Valkyrie to summon her spirit to Valhalla. Alicia runs in fearΓÇöand Silmeria in defianceΓÇöas they embark on a journey where nothing is what it seems and all hide behind a mask.

Sacred treasures offering unimaginable power suggest hop for independence, but manipulation and intrigue fool those who fight fate into fulfilling more diabolical destinies. The battle rages through the realm of Midgard, over the bridge of Bifrost, into the heavens of Asgard, and beyond, as the struggle for control over Alicia's fateΓÇöand all of existenceΓÇöunfolds in unforeseeable dimensions.
