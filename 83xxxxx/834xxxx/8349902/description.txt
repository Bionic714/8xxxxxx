"The Surprise Party"

Tom plans a surprise for Ivy in an 
attempt to find a balance between 
their work life and their friendship. 
Relations between Karen, Jimmy, and 
Derek explode just as "Hit List's" 
rehearsal process nears its close. 
While Richard asks Eileen to spend 
less time at work and more time with 
him, Julia finds herself also pulled 
away from "Bombshell" by an unlikely 
source.
