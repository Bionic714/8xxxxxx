AC3 (Dolby Digital) is so much better than FLAC - why aren't more people uploading songs in AC3?  

It's very easy to convert using the free AuioMuxer, it even takes up less space
than FLAC.

Even if you download an AC3 song on your laptop and listed to it with headphones, it's STILL much better than FLAC!

This song is just one example out of thousands and how the quality can be.  FLAC doesn't even come close to AC3 as far as quality goes.
