Can u find & upload any of these movies:

I don't know if you've looked at my list of uploaded torrents or not, but I usually only do high resolution encodes. 

I'm also planning on doing The Usual Suspects 1080p, Pi 1080p and The Sunset Limited 1080p first, but I will absolutely try to get The Walker for you."

Yes, I have been a regular follower of all your torrents and really appreciate the quality of ur releases. 
Also, one thing that really differentiates you is the fact that you respond quickly to all the requests.
I saw that you generally do releases that are not done by Yify and so selected these movies.
Thanks for The Walker(in advance) :) "
