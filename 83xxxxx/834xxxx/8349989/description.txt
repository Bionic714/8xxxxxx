IΓÇÖll Be There Tomorrow is an extremely diverse album that can only be described as experimental country and blues with a couple of covers mixed in. The musical arrangements and instrumentation on each song are perfect backdrops creating the moods and settings for The Sumner BrothersΓÇÖ stories. Not only are the arrangements spot-on, but their vocals are terrifically suited for this grungy, rootsy, bluesy, country music.

Fiercely opening with ΓÇ£Toughest Man In The Prison Camp,ΓÇ¥ an experimental, garage, punk-like blues tune with the muscular sound of crashing percussion, screaming guitars, and BrianΓÇÖs rough, howling vocals. This is definitely a statement song demanding attention and telling the listeners that The Sumner Brothers mean business. Simply put, they ainΓÇÖt playinΓÇÖ, son! The brothers then move into something more haunting in ΓÇ£Going Out West.ΓÇ¥ In this song, youΓÇÖll hear guitar strumming, some banjo plucking, and the tumbleweed-blown sound of a steel guitar while Bob expresses turmoil in his somewhat pained vocals. For me, the song has a Dust Bowl feel and sound with a modern twist. Then, they move into a stunning cover of ΓÇ£Coloardo GirlΓÇ¥ that would garner Townes Van ZandtΓÇÖs approval. ΓÇ£Lay You In The GraveΓÇ¥ is a daring combination of country and western music with a cynical attitude while ΓÇ£You Will Find MeΓÇ¥ has a slightly different stance and gentler sound. Toward the end of the album The Sumner Brothers perform a loud and raw cover of Arthur ΓÇ£Big BoyΓÇ¥ CrudupsΓÇÖs ΓÇ£ThatΓÇÖs Alright.ΓÇ¥ Closing with the quiet and sleepy instrumental ΓÇ£I Would Love You In The KitchenΓÇ¥ is an appropriate end to the albumΓÇÖs bold sound.
