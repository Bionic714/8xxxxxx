A woman with a violent alter ego defends the weak and the oppressed in this series from London Night Studios. In this case, the weak and the oppressed are the victims of child pornographers; sadly, the criminals are protected by, and in league with, members of the police force. While writer Jerry Kennedy crafts a fairly strong story about horrible crimes against children and the need for justice, murky black-and-white artwork distracts a bit from what could be a very powerful piece of work. Occasionally, shock violence overshadows what could be very well-told story.
