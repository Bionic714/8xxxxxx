Just when you think you're heard the best of the up-and-coming Americana stars, along comes one whose music almost takes your breathe away.

Andrew Combs, whose album "Worried Man" is set for October 30 release, is one of those rare artists.

The title track opens with a big, bouncy beat which gives way to wailing guitars and keys behind Combs' diamond-edged vocals. It's easy to get caught up right away, thinking this guy is the real deal. But how many times has an artist released an album with a killer title track that is clearly the only gem on the album?

No need to brace for such disappointment here.

"Worried Man" "is just a delicious appetizer for a hearty feast of Americana tunes, many accented with killer pedal steel -- it's tough not to love that. Whether Combs is going for a rock edge such as on the title track or other uptempo songs such as the gritty, guitar anthem "Big Bad Love" or one of his don't miss ballads such as stand-out track "Too Stoned to Cry," his music is a delight.

Combs will tour with some major Americana artists before he goes out on the road himself later this year. It really doesn't matter where you see him -- just go.

Get ready to watch Andrew Combs join Jason Isbell, Justin Townes Earle and other young guns in setting the musical pace for the next wave of Americana.
