You can play an mp4 video on a dual layer dvd.

You have to burn the dvd in UDF 2.5 and the ps3 will see it and play it.

What is the difference between Full SBS and Half SBS rips?

The difference is resolution. A full SBS rip is 3840x1080 meaning each "side" is 1920 X 1080p. This means the picture is much better however this comes at the cost of compatibility as there aren't any devices outside of PC that support that resolution (as far as I know). In other words, higher detail but PC only for now

A half SBS rip is 1920 X 1080p for the entire screen,Each half is 960 X 1080. When making half side by side files the converter squeezes all the detali on each half, this is then un-squeezed when played back on a 3D media device. HSBS Encodes have a much higher compatibility than (FSBS)

It's a good question and its important for people to read the summary before downloading to ensure that the rip is suitable for the required platform. That is why all the media info is included along with screens and a sample; You can test before laying down 10GB in bandwidth. That bit is totally up to the user though, I can't make people read.
