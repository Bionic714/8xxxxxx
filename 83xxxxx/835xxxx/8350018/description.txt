You can play an mp4 video on a dual layer dvd.

You have to burn the dvd in UDF 2.5 and the ps3 will see it and play it.

Don't forget to burn in UDF 2.5.

What is the difference between Full SBS and Half SBS rips?

The difference is resolution. A full SBS rip is 3840x1080 meaning each "side" is 1080p. This means the picture is much better however this comes at the cost of compatibility as there aren't any devices outside of PC that support that resolution (as far as I know). In other words, higher detail but PC only for now

A half SBS rip is 1080p for the entire screen, both sides. This means that when played in 3D the two sides are combined then stretched to make up the full screen width. Half SBS rips have compatibility with most 3D devices however this comes at the expense of detail

It's a good question and its important for people to read the summary before downloading to ensure that the rip is suitable for the required platform. That is why all the media info is included along with screens and a sample; You can test before laying down 10GB in bandwidth. That bit is totally up to the user though, I can't make people read.
