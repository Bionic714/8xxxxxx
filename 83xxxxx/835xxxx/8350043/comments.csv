I cut out the commercials that the History Channel inserts. 
Overall a decent watch, since the big groups have left us high & dry!"

,stugots13,2013-04-07T19:49Z,thanks!
,Akvafrank,2013-04-07T20:02Z,"Thanx for the up, but this is to low quallity for me. 
Can't be so hard to resync audio, and rip with decent bandwith?
With only 1mbit bandwith it's more than possible to get bether stuff than this :-/
"
,beechyboy,2013-04-07T20:37Z,"If like you say it's more than possible to find better stuff then this, then why don't you do that Akvafrank? Then you can upload it for all of us to enjoy! I see you have never even uploaded anything yet?
"
,Akvafrank,2013-04-07T21:57Z,"@beechyboy:
Where do I say I can find this in better quality? I never ever have written that. I ONLY wrote the fact; I rather skip this episode, than watch it in piss poor quality. My choice – I hope!
I don’t understand why every small group or “do it at home-rippers” not can encode the shows in a decent way. A lot of us love quality, instead of quantity :)

I still hope someone‘ll up some 720p or better shit!"

Unless Killers or AFG releases a HD that is the only way your going to find a better quality video.
It doesn't matter how good you encode the video, it's the quality of the source. That is why it is named ""WebRip"" so you know what your getting. I wish there was a better quality source myself. (Read info)
It takes a lot of time and effort to download,encode, and upload this for others to watch. 
Hope you find a HD source. If you do, could you upload it for us all to watch?"
,q2323,2013-04-08T04:31Z,"Akvafrank is a dumbass! He wrote me too.

thanks for this"
,beechyboy,2013-04-08T14:45Z,"Akvafrank complains about shows uploaded that are not perfect HD. You can't always get a HD source, so you watch what you can get, or don't download it and miss watching that show.
Look at this history. He has not upload as much as a single show. He's just a complaining leecher!"
,whosu,2013-04-10T16:30Z,do you still watch Market Warriors beechyboy?  Would love to see those uploads from you for this season.
