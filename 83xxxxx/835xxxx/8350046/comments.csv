Why the fk you are annoyed dude? Was your mom a cock sucker of a hindi speaking guy?"
,masoud.su,2013-04-23T16:01Z,"@gs2907 no obviously it's your mom or maybe sister. indian movies are all fantasy and meaningless. fucking actors and director rip off people with making fantasy movies, and people who watch indian movies are idiots because they waste their time and money if they go to cinema or buy the dvd to watch them. you are one of them u fuck"

The movie content is good, but predictable at some times. The brew of fresh faces - Rhea Chakraborthy is so HOTTT,  Saqib Saleem and Prabal Panjabi's comical timing is quite good. The ending is quite quirky.

Overall, you might enjoy it.

And masoud.su - Get a life man. No offence. Peace."
