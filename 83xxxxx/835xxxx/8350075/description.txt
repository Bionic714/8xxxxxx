Comprised of husband and wife Ben and Dorothy DeBerry, the two have been creating quite a buzz within Music City as of late.

Their debut album has been getting a lot of response for the couple, who admit their musical stylings are a little hard to place neatly in a nice little box. "We've been describing it as an Americana-Folk thing with a World beat. To me, I think it's an acoustic American fusion, because we draw from so many different influences. Dorothy is influenced by soul and blues music. We both share a love of folk music, and I'm a little more influenced by bluegrass, rock, and country. Our players all have similar type influences. To us, it just seems like we are playing music. But, people say that we are doing something that is a little fresh. I think that's because we haven't pinned ourselves to a specific genre."
