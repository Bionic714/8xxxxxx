My first ever torrent!

A big fan of Dominic Fortune so I thought I'd put together all his major appearances starting from Marvel Previews up to his recent appearances in Hawkeye & Mockingbird and Avengers 1959.

I also included The Scorpion series Chaykin did which was the precursor to the Fortune character.

From Wikipedia:

"Dominic Fortune is a fictional comic book character, owned by Marvel Comics.
Created by Howard Chaykin and based on the Scorpion, Chaykin's character for the failed Atlas/Seaboard Comics company,[2] Dominic Fortune was originally a 1930s costumed, fortune-seeking adventurer."

The Chaykin produced stuff is the best but the digital Astonishing Tales story written by Dean Motter was all kinds of fun as well.

Not my scans so kudos to the original scanners and uploaders.
