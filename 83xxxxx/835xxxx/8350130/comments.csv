,XHaloXX,2013-04-14T16:33Z,"thx alot, but this software is junk piece of shit, always crashing and freezing, and its too fuckin slow in preview and rendering, use Adobe After Effects or CyberLink Power Director, they are alot better."
,gitmo-by-the-bay,2013-04-19T04:37Z,"The torrent was great, until my virus protector detected two trojans."
,froguy,2013-04-20T07:29Z,Thanks Man! It works great! :)
,Cybersprire,2013-04-21T14:22Z,"Many thanks for this torrent Ching_Liu!

Please(!) look into adding or creating a independant torrent for the plug-in called TWIXTOR for sony vegas. I'd appreciate it - A LOT! :)

I've been checking out sony vegas 10+TWIXTOR for 64-bit windows. It's there on this site, but the torrent/program is very unstable unfortunately...

After Effects does not support audio in HD files in the form of MTS-files (canon and sony) without converting them.

,nandofire,2013-04-26T19:44Z,patch not working! keygen of digital insanity works fine 
,Sytheee,2013-05-07T12:57Z,"Has anyone gotten this to work on Windows 8? Cause all i get is an error saying ""Failed to initialize script host."""
,corruptreality,2013-05-08T03:59Z,"Software is fine, sorry your having computer issues with it halo. My renders are fast and have zero issues running the program. you cant compare vegas to CyberLink Power Director, its not even on the same level. x264 is the best to render anyway,but users dont care to learn commands"
,W7W,2013-05-10T14:26Z,"Thank you so much! Vegas is working just fine, any problems or errors issues aren't spotted."
,jgibbs99,2013-05-10T23:25Z,Works great on my Windows 8
,LeNiTo72,2013-05-17T14:47Z,Oh my god! I love you man it works PERFECTLY!
,DjFloMusy,2013-05-20T20:59Z,Thank's a lot !!!!!!! You're the best !
,bsnonpsn,2013-06-02T08:34Z,"Signed up just to leave this comment. I'm running this right now on Windows 8. Starts up and functions properly, make sure you read the nfo file for directions on how to correctly install and don't forget to manually block Sony Vegas in your firewall settings."
,proxymob,2013-06-09T03:27Z,"this patch worked flawlessly.
fast download, easy patch. 
THANK YOU SO MUCH!

if you're having problems, make sure you read the nfo file. (seriously.)"
,M2theO,2013-06-09T23:42Z,Does anybody get a glitchy effect after rendering when you add allot of text and stuff??
