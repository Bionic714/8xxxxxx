Meet Patrick Cleary: party boy, loser, and spaz. PatrickΓÇÖs been trying desperately to transform himself, and the results have been so spectacular, theyΓÇÖve almost killed him. Meet Wes ΓÇ£WhiskeyΓÇ¥ Keenan: heΓÇÖs a field biologist wondering if itΓÇÖs time to settle down. When the worst day of PatrickΓÇÖs life ends with Whiskey saving it, Patrick and Whiskey find themselves sharing company and an impossibly small berth on the worldΓÇÖs tackiest houseboat.

Patrick needs to get his life togetherΓÇöand Whiskey wants to helpΓÇöbut Patrick is not entirely convinced itΓÇÖs doable. HeΓÇÖs pretty sure heΓÇÖs a freak of nature. But Whiskey, who works with real freaks of nature, thinks all Patrick needs is a little help to see the absolute beauty inside his spastic self, and Whiskey is all about volunteering. Between anomalous frogs, a homicidal ex-boyfriend, and PatrickΓÇÖs own hangups, WhiskeyΓÇÖs going to need all of his patience and PatrickΓÇÖs going to need to find the best of himself before these two men ever see clear water.
