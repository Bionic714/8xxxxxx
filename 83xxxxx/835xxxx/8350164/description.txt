This is the 1996 Spanish film about the Spanish Civil War/Revolution that was the subject of George Orwell's Homage to Catalonia wherein the Anarchists and Communists/Socialists fought against the Franco's fascist army and eventually each other. Also titled FreedomFighters, this is an MPEG4, h.264, AAC Xbox 360 and other player compatible version taken from the Matroska and hardcoded with the english subtitles so they can be viewed on the 360 and other players. 

Hope it helps someone
