Whether curating their own micro-festival in a North Yorkshire pub or busking atop the Great Wall of China, British Sea Power can make a claim to be one of the more intriguing British bands of the past decade. But their fifth album finds them playing it relatively straight, and it's no bad thing. The title track blends the warmth of Elbow with the propulsion of Neu!, K Hole recalls the exuberance of early Strokes, while What You Need the Most could be Arcade Fire reining in the bombast for a lullaby. Even better are the joyfully unrestrained Monsters of Sunderland and the sublime, mariachi-flecked Radio Goddard.
