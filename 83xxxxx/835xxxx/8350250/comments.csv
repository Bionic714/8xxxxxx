,twirpdk,2013-04-21T03:57Z,"There is no trojan in this torrent, it once again the cracks behavior when bypassing the games DRM thats misinterpreted by the anti virus programs.

So please, it would be super awesome if you don't report virus in a torrent unless if you're absolutely certain."

What should I do?? Anyone ??"
