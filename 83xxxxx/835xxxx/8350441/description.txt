This is a breezy, chatty, non-technical, fun-to-read explanation of low carbohydrate dieting ΓÇö why it works, the surprising health benefits, and most importantly, how to ΓÇ£doΓÇ¥ the diet. Or, rather, diets,since the book details three very different main approaches to controlling carbohydrates (including the Basic Low Carb Diet, similar to Atkins or Protein Power, and the Mini-Binge Diet, popularized as The Carbohydrate AddictΓÇÖs Diet), plus several variations, finally summing up the basic principles which tie them all together. The point is to give the reader the tools necessary to construct a new way of eating that will fit his or her body, psyche, and lifestyle, thus allowing them to stay slim, energetic, and healthy for life.
