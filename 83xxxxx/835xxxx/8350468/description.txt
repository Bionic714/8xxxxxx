Editorial Review: After the massive success of the FugeesΓÇÖ The Score, the popularity of any Refugee Camp solo project was guaranteed. No one, however, was prepared for the massive response to Lauryn HillΓÇÖs debut album. Apart from the chart-topping singles ΓÇ£Doo Wop (That Thing)ΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£Everything Is EverythingΓÇ¥, the album includes collaborations with DΓÇÖAngelo, Carlos Santana and soul diva Mary J Blige. Her unique blend of Motown vocals and hip hop proved remarkably addictive, and the tracks are sweetly interspersed with classroom conversations on love. []ΓÇª An album reminiscent of the classic soul records of Stevie Wonder and Marvin Gaye, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill deserved every one of its Grammies. ΓÇôEd Potton
