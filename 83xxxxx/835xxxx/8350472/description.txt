Michel Petrucciani 1
999 - Concerts Inedits Solo Duo Trio


He wasn't one of those musicians who played only for his fellow musicians. He knew that there is no such thing as a bad audience, only bad artists. "I always play for people. I hope that after every concert they go away happy and want to come back. My music isn't intellectual; it's sensual and full of song. Enchanting. I want it to beat with the heart and to be simple. But, just because people like my music doesn't make it in any way commercial. I'm just trying harder and harder to apply the lesson of the great mastersΓÇöless is more."
Michel Petrucciani will remain one of the greatest lyrical artists of our day. Not just because he was a genius, but, perhaps, because like nobody else, with his joy and his pain, he knew how to get to the essence of sincerity and generosity with his trademark excess and truth. Francis Marmande clearly understood in his article in Le Monde, "Perhaps because he was not like us, but rather as we should beΓÇöhe played life's game to the fullest."
