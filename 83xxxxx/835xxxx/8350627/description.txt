    A fatal combination of coincidence and human error,
    there is no point in arguing what  went  wrong,  no
    point in asking who pulled the  trigger  first  and
    who fired on whom in return. The Incident went down
    in history as fatal. Within 12 hours of  the  crash
    the ground beneath the German  capital  is  shaking
    with the salvoes of a war  never  meant  to  be:  a
    conflict between  former  allies  over  Europe  and
    global supremacy. In  this  game  the  worst  comes
    true, and it may just change the fate of the  "free
    world" forever! WWII is now just a memory - but the
    Cold War has just begun.
