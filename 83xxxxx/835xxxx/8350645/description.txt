Kubla is a terrorist and would like to rule over India. To do this, he needs vital information about the Indian armed forces, and he recruits an Indian army officer, Vikram. To get this information, Vikram kills another soldier and ensures that Karan Singh (Ajay Devgan), yet another army man, gets the blame. This goes according to plan, and Karan Singh is on the run. Then Kubla and Vikram abduct Col. Choudry and his daughter, Priya. They give Bhagat Singh two-and-a-half hours to locate the information or else the Colonel will be killed, and Priya (Raveena Tandon) raped.
