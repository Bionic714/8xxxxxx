                                 PLOT
Two legendary superheroes collide as Daredevil faces Spider-Man in an all-out fight for justice. Dwelling in a world of eternal darkness, Attorney Matt Murdock defends Peter Parker by day, but at night he takes to the streets, battling anyone in his path as he searches for truth ... and revenge. Discover the origin of Daredevil, "The Man Without Fear," and witness the thrills as he and the Webslinger ultimately team up to take down their supreme nemesis, The Kingpin. It's an animated, epic clash you'll want to experience over and over again! 
Released on the same day as the Daredevil movie with Ben Affleck, Daredevil vs. Spider-Man is a collection of four animated episodes from the Spider-Man animated series which started in 1994 on Fox. "Framed" and "The Man Without Fear" feature Daredevil, while "The Ultimate Slayer" and "Tombstone" are just Spidey adventures. The first two episodes tell the origin of Daredevil as attorney Matt Murdock, who overcompensates for his blindness with his other superhuman senses. This collection also introduces the villain Kingpin, Daredevil's ultimate nemesis. It should be noted that Daredevil and Spider-Man aren't really enemies, despite the curious title of this release.
