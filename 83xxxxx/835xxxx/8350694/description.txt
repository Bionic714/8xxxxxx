Book Description

Publication Date: November 1, 2010

The beer-sodden recollections of the former editor-in-chief of Ralph provide a bawdy insider's look into the world of mens magazines. The history of mens magazines in Australia, from Playboy, Penthouse, and The Picture to FHM, Ralph, and Mens Health is explored. How women become cover girls, and how cover girls become perfect women using Photoshop, airbrushes, and an art director's imagination is also revealed.
