- Custom installer compressed (1xDVD5). No serial is needed
  to install or to play (the single player campaign) and you
  can make the installer shutdown the computer automatically
  at the end of the installation.

- The game is updated with the last patch 1.1 (main menu shows
  v1.1.1.711) and does not need to be cracked.

- Multiplayer does not work unless you have a valid key.

- Voice and text are in English and Spanish (the rest of the
  languages have been deleted). The installer will give you
  the chance to install one or both (and, in this second case,
  let you choose later using a cmd menu).

- Every level can be unlocked if the user wants to.

- A trainer, several guides and the libraries the game requires
  are also included.


Attention!: this release ONLY RUNS UNDER 64-BIT Windows systems
and (to be able to burn the .iso into a single DVD-5) two
things have been deleted: the intro video and the low resolution
textures, so it is mainly MADE TO RUN UNDER A POTENT PC.

Q: My game does not work.
A: Try installing or updating DirectX and Visual C++ libraries.

Q: Single player asks for a serial.
A: This is due to SECUROM. Just do not run the game from
   "Crysis.exe" but from "Crysis64.exe", or use the shortcuts
   the installer makes.

Q: Does the multiplayer work in this release?
A: Yes, but only if you have a valid game key. In this case,
   run the game from "Crysis.exe" instead of "Crysis64.exe".

Q: Does it use DirectX 9 or DirectX 10?
A: Under XP, DX9; under Vista/7/8, you can choose between DX9
   and DX10.

Q: Do I need Steam to play?
A: No.

Q: Does this release work under a 32-bit Windows?
A: No.
