This fills a request for somebody. I can't remember anything these days!

But I am fairly certain that this was the first series that I collected from #1. I was a fan of Hama and Wagner from G.I. Joe comics. I believe #8 is the first major work of Dale Keown, who would later draw Hulk and his creator-owned Pitt.

Normally I would copy and paste the Wikipedia article about this series, but it just doesn't do this one justice.
