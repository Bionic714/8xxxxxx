NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH SCI CHANNELS SHOW OF THE SAME NAME :)"
[V],psspss,2013-04-07T14:19Z,opps got roger leir last name spelt wrong switch the i-e around :)
[V],psspss,2013-04-07T15:12Z,i see also et/tne have upped s01e01 of unsealed con and alien files but since ive already upped them as xvids way back from web streams I wont bother as im happy with what i got already :)
,bmnott,2013-04-07T17:26Z,"pss
how come when i try to dl ur torrents it gives me 0 seeds?? :("
,SerSpec-V,2013-04-07T22:22Z,"Thanks! Downloaded fast with many seeds, it's just you."
[T],trialNerror,2013-04-07T23:14Z,"Thanks. Might check out the ""special"" to see if it's something I haven't already seen.

And are you sure about that, psspss? Look at the comparison images and you might change your mind about which copy you'd like to have in your collection. Night and day difference from your old webrip to the new hdtv cap. That sharpener in VLC won't do a bit of good to the web copy once you realize just how low quality it really is. Not just the video, but audio, too. If you still think your copy is ""just fine"", then you -- well -- whatever. Wasn't released for you anyway. :) It's for those who don't care to have crap.

If anybody gets 0 seeds while downloading from psspss it's because he has blocked you for whatever reason he thought was justifiable.

I've tried giving encoding advice and explaining how wrong CBR is to use. He ignores it, thinks CBR is the only way to be multiple device compliant (not true!) and calls me a drip. I've tried suggesting a seedbox so he can seed without it severely effecting his data cap and not block everyone and their sister but he just ignores it and calls me a drip. Great guy, yea? ;)"
[V],psspss,2013-04-08T01:35Z,"tne stop causing problems

its was well seeded when I went a bed so I wasnt blocking people it might be the 40 seeders that were left were slowing or blocking him

but I suspect its cos most are on udp trackers and if not using utorrent but crappy vuze 4900
it has a bad bug and wont connect to them"
[V],psspss,2013-04-08T01:36Z,"you can find the special in mp4 720mp 350mb with a google search like I did.. some have been deleted
and others encoded with crap bitrate but one is HD
hint use the video option of google and keyword alien intent"
[V],psspss,2013-04-08T01:43Z,"and yeh I know my MQ web rips of unsealed of Ep1 wont be as good as HDTV but the shows not that great really and mine is good enough being its 20min only its like a new head line or summary show.. be good if they do more unknown stuff instead of repeat what others have said on that show. the best episode was that astronaut photo need more like that.

also if havent watched yet.. check out the abductions collection I did.. the romanek presentation was tops and the John Macky ones"
,bmnott,2013-04-08T06:00Z,ok 
,SativaCyborg,2013-04-08T06:44Z,The story he tells seems like the story in the movie Communion with Christopher Walken
[V],psspss,2013-04-08T06:59Z,"make sure to listen to Whitley interview here
as he goes into much much details and things that this 30min show didnt cover

like when he had visitors at his house

[V],psspss,2013-04-08T07:01Z,sativa it should sound the same cos hes the one that wrote the book that was later made into a movie I believe.. dont think I like the movie much though when watched it years ago.. 
,SativaCyborg,2013-04-08T07:48Z,ahh that would be why then! haha The movie is ok. It didn't age well at alllll. The effects come off as beyond corney now. 
[V],psspss,2013-04-08T08:32Z,i get the movie and rewatch it.. I think I didnt like the main actor they used but yeh cgi was costly back then I guess. even star wars wasnt cgi on the first one it was models and blue screening.. although they did a good job lucas pioneered cgi field in the sequel movies and now its used in all movies even budget ones.even now pcs are fast enough back then they needed supercomputers els eit take too long to do it :)
[V],psspss,2013-04-08T08:51Z,"that dark skies 2013 movie will be much better then communion effects are good 

i bet they remake that communion since ufos and aliens seem to be hollywood flavour currently

hes got a book update to original communion to cover whats happened since.. so be wondering if a new movie develops from it"
[V],psspss,2013-04-09T03:14Z,"
Just out also covers ufos etc
I wont bother doing 350mb version save some data

https://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8355274/Monsters.and.Mysteries.in.America.S01E03.Ozarks.HDTV.XviD-AFG"
[V],psspss,2013-04-09T15:54Z,"Man that communion movie is so badly done like fire in the sky.. the creatures look so fake and
makes it more a laughable movie then a serious one

they need to redo it.. and make it less like a dream state comical movie if they want people to believe his story"
[V],psspss,2013-04-09T16:45Z,"the aliens werent even blue lol more grey trolls
its so much liek a spoof movie LOL

but if they can fook wih his head perhaps they also beamed fake images of what he was seeing.. would of been more funny if they showed themselves as G bush and bin laden and korean leader in obe wan robes :)

but when I saw the alien touch his head and tip glow it was so much like ET movie LOL

and the vaccum hover cleaner pipe up his bum was just too much.. hardly hitech lol

Now Dark skies does a really good job with limited modern effects... and was more scarey and believable :)"
[V],psspss,2013-04-09T16:52Z,"opps crap not grap and hoover :)

right time for bed again 3am "
[V],psspss,2013-04-16T01:15Z,"Seems tvrage dont even list it.. instead they mix up the other
crappy H2 version with the talking heads on theories
in fact the H2 one should be called Are we Alone-Alien Encounters

this one is called Alien Encounters (from BioChan)

I think theres another episode out but dont see a source yet
e.g. Alien.Encounters.S01E03"
[V],psspss,2013-04-16T01:17Z,opps I mean episode 2 S01E02 since I included the one of special that features Shrieber that obviously was the pilot for the show
