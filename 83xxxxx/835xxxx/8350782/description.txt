    About DLC:
    Genesis 2 fills the role of Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2
    for new players to the series, introducing them to the
    story of the first two games in the Mass Effect trilogy
    and allowing them to make some of the major plot decisions
    that players could make by playing through the previous
    games (see Save File Transfer). The player is prompted to
    begin Genesis 2 after character creation, but using it is
    optional. There are two versions of the comic, one each
    for a male and female Commander Shepard.
     
     
      1. Install this minor DLC (thanks EA).
      2. Enjoy! ;)
