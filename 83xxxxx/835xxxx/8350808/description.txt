Dr. Bekken - 2006 - Flood Street

Blues Revue has called him '...a monster pianist', and his playing has been described as 'dazzling', 'sublime', exquisite' and 'exceptional' by the same publication.
I'm not a fan of mp3, but I don't have this in a lossless format, so here it is.

Track list:
01 - The Wake
02 - When I Hear You Whisper
03 - Backwater Blues
04 - The Smile In Your Eyes
05 - Saturday Night Function
06 - Sometimes I Feel Like A Motherless Child
07 - Still Water_El Choclo

Enjoy and share!
