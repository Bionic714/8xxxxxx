2013-Ray Liotta in a mobster movie? Let me put on my Shit-O-Vision goggles!

Thanks uploader :)"
,michaelrwatson,2013-04-08T02:25Z,Is this another straight-to-DVD junker? It's out on DVD/Bluray but *not a single vote* on IMDb..!?
,Jack_Reacher,2013-04-08T05:20Z,"@michaelrwatson  Hell it hasn't even been released to theaters!  April 23rd is release date.  I would take a wild guess that this is a major clunker.

Thanks juggs99 for the up!"
,Pdid,2013-04-08T16:37Z,"Okay; finished. A/V-9/9 Very good dvd quality. Movie is, as predicted, awful. Michael Chiklis with an Australian accent?! 'Nough said."
