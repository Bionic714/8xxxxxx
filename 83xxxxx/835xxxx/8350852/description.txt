Book Description



First revealed over 2,000 years ago in the Kama Sutra, the link between yoga and sex has been generally recognized but widely ignored - until now. In Sexy Yoga, Ellen Barrett, popular author and instructor for New Yorks Crunch studios offers the modern yoga student a specific program designed to transform and heighten sexual pleasure and lovemaking. Barrett's program includes a series of asanas (postures) that use yogas combination of movement, breathing, and focus to release sexual power. Sensual, erotic, and guaranteed to improve sexual performance, the poses are also designed to improve one's ability to navigate both the physical and emotional demands of intimacy. Rooted in the rich tradition of yoga but far from an esoteric Indian practice, the program in this book is suitable for everyone from new students to experienced yoga practitioners.
