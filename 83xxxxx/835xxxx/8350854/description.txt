Advances in the renewable energy sphere are proceeding with an unprecendented speed, and in order for the world''s alarming energy challenges to be solved, solid, up-to-date resources addressing the technical aspects of renewables are essential.
This new, updated second edition of Da Rosa's successful book continues to give readers all the background they need to gain a thorough understanding of the most popular types of renewable energy-hydrogen, solar power, biomass, wind power, and hydropower-from the ground up. The latest advances in all these technologies are given particular attemtion, and are carefully contexualized to help professionals and students grasp the "whys and hows" behind these breakthroughs.
