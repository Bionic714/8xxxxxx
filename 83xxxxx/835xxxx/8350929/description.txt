There have been doomsday signs and prophecies for centuries, and humans'
time on this planet may be nearly over.
 
For those of you who give a shit, this release looks and sounds SO much
better than that low-quality tv rip we were stuck with for a while.
I understand "something is better than nothing", I was once on that ship
myself, but after years and years of watching cams and low quality web
streams you stop caring for that low quality crap and wait for a sharp,
crisp, clear, vivid, bright, nothing left to the imagination quality
picture and audio version. If you're not with me on that raft, then
you are not my focus demographic and you can stay in your corner quietly
while continuing to feed on your fuzzy, blurry, shitty copies.
