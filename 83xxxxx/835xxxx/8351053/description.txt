You won't believe the incredible drawings you can create using common pencils and the special techniques illustrated in this book. The methods are so easy that anyone ' from doodler to advanced artist ' can master them in minutes! Step by step, you'll learn how to capture the look of metal, glass, weathered wood, skin, hair and other textures. Two detailed start-to-finish demonstrations show you how to use these textures to create drawings that look so real they leap right off the page!
If you already have drawing experience then this book will help you to flesh it out more..I wouldn't recommend this book for a beginner, quite involved processes for getting those realistic touches that the author is so good at achieving.
