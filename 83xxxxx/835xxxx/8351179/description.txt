Many truly great and immediately identifiable singers have graced the genre of Country Music down the years. Few have been greater or more immediately identifiable that the man who, to his fans, will forever be known by his nickname of The Voice , and who died in April 2009.

After a long career with his brother Rex as the Gosdin Brothers, which included co-credit on Gene Clark s first solo album Gene Clark & The Gosdin Brothers as well as turning down an offer to join The Byrds, Vern went solo.

The three albums in this collection all originally released on Elektra Records between 1977 and 1979 were made in an era when country music was going through one of its most commercial phases. The albums include ten of his forty-one country hits and feature his hit duets with Emmylou Harris ( Yesterday s Gone and Hangin On ) and Janie Fricke ( Mother Country Music and Never My Love ).

The album is extensively annotated by country music expert Tony Rounce. (amazon.com)
