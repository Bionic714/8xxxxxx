Perhaps the most influential of all Folk music artists in the 20th Century, no one has done more to preserve and broadcast Folk music than Pete Seeger. His passion for politics, humanity and the environment has been the driving force behind his songs, which have won him both fans and enemies since he began performing in the 1930s. His simple honesty and pure-hearted clarity has helped change the course of history during his 60-plus years career. Fatured here are some of his very best recordings from the '50s. (amazon.com)
