Established in 1950, Elektra spent its first decade signing folk artists, fast becoming the chief competition of the most successful folk label at the time, Vanguard. Forever Changing begins in the early-ΓÇÿ60s when a new flock of folk music troubadours and vagabonds nested in coffeehouses and festivals.

The label changed with the times, stretching in different directions and experimenting with artists and music that were wholly un-commercial. The good, bad, strange, and sublime are all present and accounted for across these five discs.
