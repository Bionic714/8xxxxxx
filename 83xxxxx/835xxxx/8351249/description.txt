Many aspiring artists want to draw a portrait of their best friend-especially where their pal has four paws and fur! This newest addition to the Drawing Made Easy series pairs our best-selling medium with the wildly popular subject of dogs and puppies. Unlike similar titles on the market, this book doesn't simply provide a collection of dogs for artists to re-create exactly. Instead, the book focuses on techniques specific to drawing accurate depictions of dogs and puppies-from creating a variety of fur types and features to achieving accurate proportions-so that artists can use the knowledge to render their own canine portraits. The book also includes a series of easy-to-follow, step-by-step projects showcasing a range of dog breeds, poses and props. This allows artists to practice their developing skills, guiding them from simple sketches through the study of various techniques to polished renderings.
