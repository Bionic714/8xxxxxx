The Best of Roger Rabbit:

Tummy Trouble (7:46)
Roller Coaster Rabbit (7:51)
Trail Mix-up (8:53)

Completely over-the-top slapstick comedy.

These 3 shorts were initially released on VHS as "The Best of Roger Rabbit"
completely separate from the movie "Who Framed Roger Rabbit". When WFRR was
released on DVD they were included as extras. 

These were ripped from the DVD as a (much better quality) replacement for 
that tape.
