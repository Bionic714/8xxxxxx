The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire (sometimes shortened to Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire) is a book of history written by the English historian Edward Gibbon, which traces the trajectory of the Roman Empire—and Western civilization as a whole—from the late first century AD to the fall of the Eastern or Byzantine Empire. Published in six volumes, volume I was published in 1776 and went through six printings. Volumes II and III were published in 1781; volumes IV, V, VI in 1788–89. The original volumes were published in quarto sections, a common publishing practice of the time. The work covers the history of the Roman Empire, Europe, and the Catholic Church from 98 to 1590 and discusses the decline of the Roman Empire in the East and West. Because of its relative objectivity and heavy use of primary sources, at the time its methodology became a model for later historians. This led to Gibbon being called the first "modern historian of ancient Rome".

Book Description
================
Considered one of the finest historical works in the English language, 
The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire is lauded for its graceful, 
elegant prose style as much as for its epic scope. Remarkably accurate 
for its day, GibbonÆs treatise holds a high place in the history of 
literature and remains an enduring subject of study.

GibbonÆs monumental work traces the history of more than thirteen centuries, 
covering the great events as well as the general historical progression. 
This first volume covers A.D. 180 to A.D. 395, which includes the establishment 
of Christianity and the Crusades.



EDWARD GIBBON (1737-1794), an English historian and Member of Parliament, 
had little formal education. He went to Oxford, but was forced to leave 
when he converted to Roman Catholicism. His family then sent him to 
Lausanne, where he was reconverted to Protestantism. His most important 
work, The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, was published in six 
volumes between 1776 and 1788.
