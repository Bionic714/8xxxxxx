,Odin1066,2013-04-15T13:53Z,"It's legit. Not a porno, but a low budget early 70s sexploitation flick and in pretty decent quality. The last credits show 'Vinegar Syndrome' which is a new company devoted to such films. Here's their page for it http://vinegarsyndrome.com/launch/?product=massage-parlor-murders-bddvd-combo ...this torrent is the movie only...without the extras listed of the store-bought BR. Hopefully someone posts more films from there (more are coming) since it's rare to find this genre in such good looking quality."
