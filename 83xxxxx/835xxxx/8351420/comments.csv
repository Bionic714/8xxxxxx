,Zoolater,2013-06-01T08:14Z,"Only about 16 files work out of the 44 and 12 are none functioning copies of other files. None of the bear, bull and donkey files work. The only files for the dogs are the 4 watersport videos and 2 knotting videos. And only 10 of the horse files works. This is also after finding the stand alone copy of the TSC2 codec and installing Camtasia Studio 8.

In case you're still interested in downloading this and are having trouble playing the few playable videos, here is that codec: https://support.techsmith.com/entries/22849238-Camtasia-Studio-Download-the-TSC2-standalone-codec"
