Hello all. It is me again. I hope you enjoyed my previous release.
Most of the leechers ignored the content probably for not knowing what "Grimoire" is.
But that's normal. Only the chosen few will find what they look for.
I will continue to punish you for your bad reputation until you realize it.
If the chosen few cannot obtain this knowledge from your tracker, then they shall find it here. Without any ratio limits.
You know who you are.

The rules are simple:
Not everyone will get this.
The content will be alive as long as the seeders are alive.
You will not use any of this for bad purposes or for self fulfillment. If you do so, may you face your fate.
(The same rules apply for all my occult releases)

Remember, many hold the wand but few are the true magicians.

May the fun begin!

(Torrent notes: The reason why my releases are packed into one huge RAR is because TPB won't accept .torrent files larger than 200KB, so bare with me)
