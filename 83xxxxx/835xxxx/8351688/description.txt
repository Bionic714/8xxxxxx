Since it seems that the original torrent from other user will not be seeded anymore, and as I think this is a valuable compilation, I had to rebuild it from various sources, at the maximum bitrate I could find, so there it is for you all!!!

Notice: I have serious issues with my web time in my country, plus, not much dsikspace available. As of may 23rd, 2.013, the file will be removed, so please take this in consideration, download fast, and PLEASE SEED.

Depending upon the torrent's acceptance (by the downloads and visits), It will be available again at request, only for limited times.

Of course, there will be other ways to reach the album, so ask me!
