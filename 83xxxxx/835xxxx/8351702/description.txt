Encounter Recurring Themes in American History
Professor O'Donnell has selected these specific historical turning points based on his expansive knowledge of American history and his decades of experience as a professor and lecturer to a wide variety of audiences. What makes these specific events turning points, regardless of the form they take, is the fact that they signal times when American society made a break with its past and entered a new phase of development.

"Turning points mark decisive 'before and after' moments in history," he says at the start of his course. "Before Shays's Rebellion, for example, Americans lived under the Articles of Confederation. After Shays's Rebellion and the constitutional convention it inspired, Americans lived under a new federal government and enjoyed the protections articulated in the Bill of Rights. Put another way, America became a very different place after this event."

Throughout Turning Points in American History, you'll encounter a series of recurring themes that will put your understanding of U. S. historyΓÇöand even history itselfΓÇöinto a larger, more informed context. Some of these themes are these:
ΓÇó	Surprises: Few people in any historical era are prepared for what's coming, whether it's a war, an epidemic, a revolution, or an invention. Who, 20 years ago, could have expected the astonishing impact of the personal computer on everyday life in America?
ΓÇó	Agency: History is often made by towering figures like George Washington and Martin Luther King Jr. But it's also made by many nameless and faceless peopleΓÇöslaves, workers, farmers, suffragistsΓÇöwho take matters into their own hands and achieve historical change.
ΓÇó	Crisis: Historical crises are, more often than not, opportunities for great change. American history is filled with moments when a terrible crisisΓÇösuch as the Civil War or the Great DepressionΓÇöled to a sudden and radical change for the better.
