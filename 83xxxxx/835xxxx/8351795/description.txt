Il Divo is a multinational vocal quartet of male singers who are internationally known through their numerous television and concert appearances and their chart-topping recordings. Their mixed repertory of classical and popular fare clearly places them in the crossover genre, and their global popularity makes them a formidable alternative to the Three Tenors, the Three Irish Tenors, or other such male vocal groups. The quartet consists of three tenors -- American David Miller, Swiss Urs Bühler, and Frenchman Sébastien Izambard -- and a baritone, Spanish opera singer Carlos Marín. Il Divo have appeared on the Oprah Winfrey Show, Live with Regis and Kelly, American Idol, and other major television shows in Europe, and have performed in concert with Barbra Streisand and Toni Braxton and at major sporting and charity events.
