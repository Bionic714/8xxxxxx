,joegi50,2013-04-18T04:57Z,"wdc1, YI-FY has an excellent file size. Most of them are 2Gb or less. Check them out."
,janimorph007,2013-05-07T08:35Z,"I generally try and get the largest file sizes that I can, since they convert better to Blu-Ray and DVD that way  Yours is the largest that won't take days to download

Thanks GoodFilms!  Keep posting these awesome movies, dude!"
,janimorph007,2013-05-11T08:29Z,Can't seem to find subtitles for just the non-english parts.  I hate being forced to keep the english subtitles on when they're speaking english.
