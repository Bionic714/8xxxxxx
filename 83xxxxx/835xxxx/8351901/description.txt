In the 1930s and '40s, while American dance and jazz orchestras were just finding their mature footing and popularity, Jones was there to sabotage their efforts with great playing, parody tunes (I Dream of Brownie with the Light Blue Jeans, I'm Forever Blowing Bubble Gum), and, oh yes, gunfire. As novelty artists go, Jones was one of the best. He hired great musicians for his Cityslickers, he wrote memorable songs, and he was a snappy dresser, too. This set features more of the musician than you'll ever need, nice liner notes, and great music (that still sounds hilarious after all these years) make it a steal.
