,lmatth13,2013-04-28T17:16Z,Kaspersky is telling that AutoKMS has a Trojan embedded named (HEUR: Trojan Win32 Generic). I deactivated kaspersky during the installation process. The anti-virus warning appear after reactivating kaspersky

After short while (two reboots), upon launching any programs, the MS Office Configuration window opens and attempts to configure. Ends in reboot request or error with activation key... Unable to use any programs...
Please advise!"

,TranceJunky78,2013-05-05T17:35Z,"First of, THANK YOU KAISER! Secondly, please forgive my computer illiteracy but upon completion of downloading this torrent, do I burn the 'office' .iso file to disc, then install office? And THEN follow Kaiser's instructions he listed in the comments here...?    ****Any/all suggestions are GREATLY  appreciated. Thanks guys. One love. Long Live THE BAY!!!"
,TranceJunky78,2013-05-05T18:25Z,"i just installed the program and it seems almost too good to be true because it was so simple. Unless some unforeseen problem happens from this download, (i.e. it carries a virus that eats my computer and shits it out) This is an Epic upload."
,SuaX,2013-05-06T19:59Z,It was actually really easy! Thank you very much!!!!!!

,dzchimp,2013-05-12T20:09Z,"I'm getting an error midway through install regarding a missing file ProPlus.WWpropsww2.cab. But that file is already there.

,phantomresponse,2013-05-29T03:41Z,"This no longer works, i now get a product activation failed message in the header and when opening the file. The coding seems to have changed in the document and interferes with working in word docs, obviously to prevent you from working without buying the product.

What's the fix? I'm not sure if auto updates to Office were in sync or if they just deauthorized the volume license."
,phantomresponse,2013-05-29T07:52Z,Also made a post here https://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=144317&pid=873329#pid873329
