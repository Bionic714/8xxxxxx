,nickcwpg,2013-04-10T17:34Z,I downloaded and extracted the image file. However I get a Visio and Project Folder.  The folder Office Professional Plus contains the Visio setup not Office Professional Plus.  So Office Professional Plus is missing?????
,smithilberry,2013-04-12T23:11Z,"visio and project work fine, but office said that it wasnt for my version of windows when i have a 32 bit version.... WTF!?"
