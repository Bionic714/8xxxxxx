This hugely popular double CD collection isn't so much X-rated as exhilarating, offering rib tickling rump shakers - each with their own nudge-nudge, wink wink meaning. The politically correct among us should check their pulse rate and stick to Abba. But if PC to you means the boys in blue or your home computer, you're old enough - and broad minded enough - to enjoy this feast of fleshy delights. (amazon.com)
