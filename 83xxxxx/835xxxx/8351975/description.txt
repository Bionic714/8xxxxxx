   Learn how to develop your own applications to monitor or control          
   instrumentation hardware. Whether you need to acquire data from a         
   device or automate its functions, this practical book shows you how to    
   use Python's rapid development capabilities to build interfaces that      
   include everything from software to wiring. You get step-by-step          
   instructions, clear examples, and hands-on tips for interfacing a PC to   
   a variety of devices. Use the book's hardware survey to identify the      
   interface type for your particular device, and then follow detailed       
   examples to develop an interface with Python and C. Organized by          
   interface type, data processing activities, and user interface            
   implementations, this book is for anyone who works with                   
   instrumentation, robotics, data acquisition, or process control.          
   Understand how to define the scope of an application and determine the    
   algorithms necessary, and why it's important Learn how to use             
   industry-standard interfaces such as RS-232, RS-485, and GPIB Create      
   low-level extension modules in C to interface Python with a variety of    
   hardware and test instruments Explore the console, curses, TkInter, and   
   wxPython for graphical and text-based user interfaces Use open source     
   software tools and libraries to reduce costs and avoid implementing       
   functionality from scratch
