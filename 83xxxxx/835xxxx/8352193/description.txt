            Age of Empires II HD *Gamefix* (c) Microsoft Studios

      04/2013 :..... RELEASE.DATE .. PROTECTION .......: Steam+CEG
            - :.......... DISC(S) .. GAME.TYPE ........: Strategy


Note:
~~~~~
Some users of our release approached us with what they believed to be a
crack issue. The game would crash on certain setups during the first Age of
Kings campaign, upon finding the second relic. This is in fact a game bug
that can be reproduced on the original version of the game as well. Because
we like this game, we've patched the problem away and present you with this
game-related fix. The publisher is allowed to use this fix in their next
update provided they remove DRM ;)

Btw, for the users who expected multiplayer to work, this version has no LAN
option. So get started writing a server emulator or pay up if you need that!
