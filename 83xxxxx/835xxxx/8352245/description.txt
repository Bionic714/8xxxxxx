*Songs from Home Nr.1* is the debut EP of Folk Noir. Recorded by founding members Kaat and Oliver at their home studio, it features 5 soft tunes that unfold seamlessly in dream-like relaxing fashion.

----------------------------------------

Folk Noir started out as a two-person 
project of Oliver S. Tyr (of FAUN) and 
Kaat Geevers (of L.E.A.F.) Meanwhile, 
in 2013, this has grown into a full, four 
member band, performing a powerful 
festival show. 

Folk Noir is Oliver S.Tyr (FAUN) on 
vocals, nyckelharpa, guitar & bouzouki, 
Kaat Geevers (L.E.A.F.) on vocals, 
hammered dulcimer and nyckelharpa, 
Stephan Groth (FAUN) on hurdy-gurdy, 
piano and vocals, and Alex Schulz on 
drums.
