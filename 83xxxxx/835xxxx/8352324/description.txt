Notes: It's a CAM, so you know what to expect. Video is on par with the average cam,
and audio is a little above average. The audio is a little bit quiet, so turn up
your volume. Be aware that the film has a lot of funky colors in it, so any
unrealistic colors you see, aren't just related to this rip.
There are a few minutes where the video goes black throughout when the camera had to
be hidden from ushers. Also, unfortunately due to technical issues the video from the
last 15 minutes is not available. The audio is still there, though. We'd suggest you
either listen the ending, or maybe even watch it theaters. We would also be
appreciative of any individual or group who would go into the theater to CAM the last
15 minutes, and would be happy to do a rerender from our master with the additional
minutes added back in.
