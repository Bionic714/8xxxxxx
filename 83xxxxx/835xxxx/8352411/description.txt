Thad Jones siblings included drummer Elvin and pianist Hank.  That statement

alone seems fantastic.  Not just jazz musicians but GREAT Jazz musicians.


Charlie Mingus championed Thad Jones and offered his DEBUT label and his 

own artistic contribution.


This 1954 album was Thad's first.  It has undergone several modifications

over the years.  There are actually two album releases here and two

alternate takes.  Mostly I delete alternate takes, but these were 

worth ripping.
