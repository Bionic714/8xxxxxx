It's the second ""Top 100"" audio-book torrent I've had this problem with today...  That list needs better troll-filtering."

,The_Abee,2013-05-13T10:17Z,"Actually, Seems there's a problem while creating the torrent by it's uploader (happened with me as well). So that's why It's not showing any seeders but only leechers but actually more than half of them are actual seeders. It's a mistake or say any file got missed while creating a torrent. otherwise it's great torrent. And, there will not any or may be 1 or 2 seeders here in future as well but many leechers. I hope some panicked guys could understand the problem with torrent. ;) "
