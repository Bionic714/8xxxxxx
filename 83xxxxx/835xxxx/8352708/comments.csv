,pxpierre,2013-04-09T20:24Z,"Man I hate those jerks always asking for more before even taking the time to say thanks.

Regenzy1 was the first to upload this motogp race in English and just click his profile to see what he did last year too: great quality/file size ratio and no 720p nor moto2 or 3.

Thanks Regenzy1 & seeders and what a race it was!"
