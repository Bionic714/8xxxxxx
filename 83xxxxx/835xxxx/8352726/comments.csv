,demmydemon,2013-04-11T19:15Z,"Thanks for sharing, but I can't get it to work.
""StarDrive has stopped working"" right when it's launched.
Not a big deal, I'm buying it a soon as I can get my filthy little hands on some money anyway, but it'd be nice to get going before I have legitimate access...  ;-)"
,sobrien96,2013-04-11T22:25Z,Hey guys right above me. I think your problem is you don't have microsoft xna when you install. It's in the redistribute folder. Its a simple setup.
,theassassinguy59,2013-04-13T20:17Z,"when i try to to open i get stardrive.exe has stopped responding, help!"
,Zeik13,2013-04-13T21:53Z,Any chance of a torrent for the current beta? currently it's 1.06S
,johnjacob87,2013-04-15T12:36Z,"@ you guys that the game wont start for/crashes soon as you launch, you need to make sure you have three things installed in addition to stardrive, as mentioned above XNA, .Net 3.5 or above, and Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable. All three are included in the download in the file Redistributables, personally whenever i torrent i download those from the source, but either way there you have it. 

@any kind loving soul who can!
Could someone please upload the latest version please? For the record, i plan on buying this game the INSTANT i have the money (joblessness due to health issues sucks), it is the first game that makes me feel like im playing a real succesor to the MOO games, essentially the best 4x i have played in the last 10 years, and i have played just about every single one to come out for windows!"
,meskiman,2013-04-17T00:09Z,Anyone got the latest version?

,theassassinguy59,2013-04-20T14:46Z,"w8 nvm johnkacob, altho i am running windows 8 so it may not work"
,P.I.N.G,2013-04-20T16:13Z,"@theassassinguy59

Go into the Redistributables folder in the torrent you downloaded and just install every one of these files"
,NanoEntity,2013-04-20T20:20Z,any update to this? its on 1.06S
,theassassinguy59,2013-04-21T06:28Z,"when i try to install microsoft visual c++ it says thats its already on my computer, but it isnt, CURSES WINDOWS 8, CURSES"
,P.I.N.G,2013-04-21T09:27Z,"@theassassinguy59

You need to go to Microsoft webpage and download it from there"
