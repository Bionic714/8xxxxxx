Whale Adventure with Nigel Marven
Wildlife adventurer Nigel Marven is traveling 6000 miles, following grey whales as they undertake the longest mammal migration on Earth, up the Pacific coast of North America. From the warm winter birthing lagoons of Baja California, Mexico, a grey whale mother and her newborn calf must travel northwards to the icy seas of the Alaskan Arctic. It's a long, dangerous journey, past some of the world's most breathtaking scenery. On land, he finds snakes, bears, eagles and antelope, while out on the ocean waves he comes across a supporting cast of boisterous dolphins, playful sea lions, huge humpbacks and deadly killer whales. 





2)  North to the Golden Gate 
The grey whales' migratory journey takes Nigel up the coast of California, where the hustle and bustle of human activity is a stark contrast to the peace of the Mexican desert he has just left behind. He encounters humpbacks in the Santa Barbara Channel, is led on a merry dance by a diminutive fox on the island of Santa Cruz, spots condors above Big Sur, and crosses the Golden Gate Bridge to end his adventure in Redwood National Park.
