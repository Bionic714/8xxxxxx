After the horrible crimes the japs committed in WW2 and for which they never formally apologized or offer reparations, like the Germans did, the only jap language I need is these pictures: of a jap, then of a dead jap lying on the ground, then the jap standing and smiling, meaning; a god jap is a dead jap...

(feeling shared by almost all ex-jap allied prisoners of war)

In every rule there are exceptions, but the basic brutality present in the japanese mentality (which made possible the atrocities during WW2) is shown  for example in their TV shows in which horrible things are done to participants (buckets of roaches put under women's blouses, women put in snake pits, etc.) which far from causing horror brings about laughter from the jap audience... And there are many more examples.

Since they haven't made any reparations or acknowledged their particularly brutal and evil behavior during WW2, when they have natural disasters, I just say: you deserve them, you bastards...

,triggerjerk,2013-04-08T18:21Z,"Yes, the Japanese are a brutal people, unlike the rest of us. 

They ""conquered"", enslaved, raped and murdered countless thousands of natives. stole their land, placed them on reservations and, later, repaid them by allowing them to build casinos on their reservations.

No...wait...that wasn't the Japanese.

Now I remember. The Japanese were the people that were living in the US, being good citizens, who were illegally incarcerated and had their belongings and property stolen, for the unpardonable offense of looking like people we were fighting at the time.

Japanese, Americans, Europeans, Russians, etc. - we all have skeletons in our closets, eras we would rather not think about.

Let it go, sakstroy, it's all history now.

BTW, you're not actually saying that the Germans were somehow more ""noble"" post-war than the Japanese?"

I can't and won't let it go. You can't compare the US brutality towards the indians with the japanese atrocities.  It's absurd. The US soldiers massacred indians but didn't behead indians for fun or use them for 'medical' experiments, didn't force their women into brothels for the soldiers, etc.

You are rejecting facts known to everybody of the brutality in japanese culture passed from generation to generation and which they refuse to admit or atone for the horrible crimes they committed during WW2 and before.

Yes, the Germans made full admission of nazi war crimes, outlawed even the symbols of nazi ideology, put in prison deniers of such horrors, paid money to those who suffered persecution by the nazis, a very dignified and honest attitude.

,mantikor777,2013-04-12T01:55Z,"@sakstroy: Your ignorance of the actual history of American treatment of the native Americans is clear.  You bring up stunts on Japanese TV shows but say nothing of shows in your culture like ""Fear Factor"" which do the same thing and enjoy great popularity.  You are a narrow-minded bigot.  Most cultures in the world have examples of the things you accuse the Japanese of but are not as well known (such as the American treatment of the native tribes as well as the treatment of black slaves).  I am not, for a moment, justifying the atrocities that the fascist regime of Imperial Japan committed - I am simply saying that painting the whole society with that brush is an act of hypocrisy on a massive scale.  That you cannot see that beggars credulity.  Crawl back under your rock where we cannot see or hear you."

Well, assuming the natural course of things, all the WWII ""war criminals"" are, or soon will be, dead. As will yourself, and man's inhumanity to man will continue, always seeking new victims.

   I, for one, won't punish an entire culture for the sins of their fathers. You are free to hate whomever you choose, right into your grave. I have better use for my limited time here on earth."
