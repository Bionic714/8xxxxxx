I hope people who read this don't take all these fantasies and hallucinations for reality of after death existence, then they would really be idiots...

,bonzofan,2013-04-08T12:31Z,"There are good neurological explanations for these experiences. Some operating theatres have a word written up near the ceiling which could only be seen from above- just in case. Unsurprisingly no patient has ever read one, even if they claim to have had an ""NDE""."
