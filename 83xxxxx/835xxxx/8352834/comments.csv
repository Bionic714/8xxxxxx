[V],psspss,2013-04-08T08:53Z,"its amazing how many ufo and aliens shows are showing up on tv and web this year...

theres something going on

who knows perhaps the ufos will show when korea sparks a war with usa and basically risk of the world LOL

another dictatorship wiped out in weeks if he does do sometihng.. think usa have better tech only problem is china would be on the wrong team"
,nnik0,2013-04-08T14:46Z,"Where is fact or faked when we need them, the case about the alien at the window was been investigated by chasing ufos (i think) and was a faked one, about the others my opinion is the same.
About 2013 so many sheith that could go wrong and it will"
[V],psspss,2013-04-08T15:17Z,"HAsnt been proven to be fake at all.. where is the docu on that? chasing ufos was a joke.. fox messed up with that show. or badly edited..
cos they could prove they could fake it similar doesnt mean it was fake
sure its been in a few shows as well 
and I think with all the new material Romanek has shown in his latest abductions presentation show even more creditable alien photos and videos and plan weirdness he would have to be full time scamming to produce it all to keep up and they claim thats only 20 percent of all the have collected (you obviously havent watched it)
at first I thought it was fake too and him doing it for money but ive kept open mind about it i think theres some dna evidence coming too

as for aliens snaps.. the one over the road looked like a starving dog and perhaps the one in sewer looked like a type of cat prob hunting rats for a meal"
,nnik0,2013-04-08T16:47Z,"For me dont add up, an alien in window doing that move.
Im very skeptic about new videos bcz so many ways to modify a video, tecnology now is a pain in the 4ss, now is becoming very hard to know truth bcz with drones, flying objects are more common than ever, but i believe in aliens, in the early 90's i saw an ufo near my house that shook my world.
But about new videos i have always one foot behind, unless it's something very obvious."
[V],psspss,2013-04-09T02:15Z,"its pays to be skeptical however you could say all ufos and alien videos are faked... why is there so many people making them world wide.. dont add up there? maybe then theres some truth in it.. we know its not the old claim of sleep parallesis cos theres cases it happens in day time and seen by multiple people

anyhow you see a bit of one of his leaked videos of alien inside the house ducting in door.. since hes got camera alls over the house now tryign to get proof

perhaps they are his alien children who knows perhaps we never know if ufos and aliens are real in our life time cos people still dont want us to know the truth

if its truth aliens are using some white beam that can alter the solid atoms of objects to pass through each other without damage. now thats scary tech"

,bmnott,2013-04-09T05:36Z,"pss

u r a ufo paranormal believer?"
[V],psspss,2013-04-09T06:02Z,"looks like TPB is moving domains again.. guess its not time to trust sweden any more

moving to greenland just had to ask to resend new password so they reset all those too

=--------------------------

No I never see a UFO etc.. but various friends have seen them from the ball foo fighter kind zipping up a river bed to a real silver sauncer lifting from a forrest. and one claiming to seea mothership with various ufos flying up under it and entering.. guess they are the lucky ones
it seems to change them once they experience it

so I believe them and have been interesting in following whats happening in the field

also for paranormal same.. although I believe ive had night visitations with unseen ghosts as had some jump on me while sleeping it really started when sister and kids were experiencing weird activity in their home

so now i have a interest in UFOs and paranormal to find out more and keep open mind to it

still I dont think its time travellers or multi unverses.. out universe is big enough and old enough for many other lifeforms to develop and travel it..

if USA now have cloaking tech that can hid planes and tanks pretty much from view  im sure advance lifveforms have way better."
[V],psspss,2013-04-09T06:05Z,"opps a few typos..

our unvierse not out universe :)

seen not see

you get what i mean though"
[V],psspss,2013-04-09T15:00Z,"i see theres a D grade Alien Dawn movie.. anyone bothered to grab and watch it?

also I see a new scifi mystery series called alien dawn.. thats probably better.. anyone watched

as I havent either... tv series sounds liek got good reviews but the movie 2 out of 10 on movie DB.. but sometimes a grap movie is fun to watch"
