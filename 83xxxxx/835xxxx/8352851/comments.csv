,FRivera,2013-04-08T10:24Z,"RE: the ""too large"" comments:

@720p, 10MB per minute is crap quality. 20 MB/min is decent. Great quality really starts at file sizes around 30 MB/min and over.
Personally, I have a relatively small (woefully small, really) HD, and a pretty slow DL speed once I go over the monthly quota...But I don't want to spoil my own experience by DLing GOT - with its landscape shots, costumes, etc - in small size and poor quality. 

I USED to. But those times are long past...Good image+sound make everything a completely different beast..."
,FRivera,2013-04-08T10:25Z,"oh and many thanks, uploader"
,kiwij,2013-04-08T12:11Z,"Thank you.  No video or audio glitches, video quality looks marginally lower than usual but I may be imagining things. V8 A9."
,knasiotis,2013-04-08T12:32Z,"If you want subs , install bs player"
,waldorfx,2013-04-08T14:42Z,English subtitles: http://www.correctsubs.com/Game.of.Thrones.S03E02.720p.HDTV.x264-IMMERSE.srt
,Lulzaar92,2013-04-08T16:00Z,Great fucking quality 10/10
,one2or3,2013-04-08T19:38Z,"a/v:10
i had som issues with the quality in vlc, but works fine in other mediaplayers like mplayerc (media player classic)

oh, and:
Thanks for the upload :D"
,SteezyToe,2013-04-09T00:20Z,"Thanks for the upload! By the way, anyowne looking for subtitles can find any version of them in subtitlerseeker.com. They subtitles for almost everything"
,bender420,2013-04-09T00:56Z,"is this 2 channel or 6 channel audio?  none of the ULers seem to bother posting that detail anymore, but its pretty important to me"
,iCeDmeTeL,2013-04-09T02:56Z,"getting tired of seeing the same bullshit in every episode nowadays.  too large?  fuck off, 1.5-1.8gb is the standard for 720p, im talking TRUE 720p, if you want small file size then go download a realmedia rip, around ~300mb.  seriously, get an external HDD and  faster internet, fuckers"
,Wormsoff,2013-04-15T07:27Z,Does this seed have the audio/video problem with the credits?
