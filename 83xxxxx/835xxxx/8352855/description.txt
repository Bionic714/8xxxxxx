About DLC:

Genesis 2 fills the role of Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2
for new players to the series, introducing them to the
story of the first two games in the Mass Effect trilogy
and allowing them to make some of the major plot decisions
that players could make by playing through the previous
games (see Save File Transfer). 
The player is prompted to
begin Genesis 2 after character creation, but using it is
optional. There are two versions of the comic, one each
for a male and female Commander Shepard
