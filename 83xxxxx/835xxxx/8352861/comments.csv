About the skull, it's not only about how many movies you did but also includes the no. of good comments, no. of seeders/leechers and also how the uploader interact and help others. At this rate you will get one soon ;)

Yeah yify's audio is terrible and your's is far good. Continue doing unique rare movies like now. Stay healthy. Cheers !!

I prefer rare old classics. If it's alright with you i would request few."

I'll come back and rate the upload when it's done. Thanks again."

,twrightson,2013-06-07T12:41Z,"Hi. I am new to all this and not very tech savvy. I wanted to download this for transfer onto my USB so I can plug straight into my TV (60"") and play it. I have done this successfully before and assumed it would work again but when I plugged USB into TV and tried to play, it wouldn't open. Said ""cannot access file"" or something like that.

Do I have to download a higher bit rate version in order for it to play on TV? 

Perhaps I need a specific type of file that is compatible with my TV? It is a sony Bravia Full HD LED LCD.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks
TW"
