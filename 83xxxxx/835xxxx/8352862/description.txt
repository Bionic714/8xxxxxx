Various Artists - R&B Hipshakers, Volume 2: Scratch That Itch [2011]

Original Release / Vampisoul / VAMPI CD 126 / CD

Second volume of our ΓÇ£R&B HipshakersΓÇ¥ series, featuring rockinΓÇÖ R&B and early soul from the King/Federal/DeLuxe catalogue

A long fingernail, calamine lotion, a Rudy Ray Moore back scratcher, this set of wild King and Federal rhythm-and-blues songs: what do they all have in common? Why, itch relief, of course! If volume 1 of our series (ΓÇ£Teach Me to MonkeyΓÇ¥) left you with an acute case of R&B pruritus, we at Vampisoul are here to dispense 20 more doses of musical medicine to help you SCRATCH THAT ITCH!

We clawed our way into the King Records vaults again to come up with more virtuosic instrumentals (ΓÇÿMarsanovaΓÇÖ rhymes with ΓÇ£bossa novaΓÇ¥, more or less, if you pronounce organist supreme Hank MarrΓÇÖs surname with the right accent; Freddy King raises Mr Marr two dance crazes in ΓÇÿBossa Nova Watusi TwistΓÇÖ); more classy love songs with a hook (ΓÇÿBurnt Toast And Black CoffeeΓÇÖ, besides being the epitome of that particular sub-subgenre, is highly elusive and expensive on an original Federal 45 and much in demand in the R&B dance parlors of Western Europe; kudos to the gong banger on the plaintive ΓÇÿYou Have My BlessingsΓÇÖ); more unholy dances (ΓÇÿMonkey TonightΓÇÖ is one of Eddie KirkΓÇÖs more restrained performances, believe it or not; this compilationΓÇÖs title track describes a dance that, like so many of the worthwhile ones, might get you escorted from your high-school prom in handcuffs if you tried it); and more holy nonsense (ΓÇ£My name is Puddentane,ΓÇ¥ declares the prolific and wonderful Lula Reed, an earthily appropriate reply to Hank BallardΓÇÖs to-the-point pick-up line ΓÇÿWhatΓÇÖs Your NameΓÇÖ; if ΓÇÿWhiz-A-Shoo-Pepi-DadaΓÇÖ meant anything, would it get your hips shaking quite so violently?). Then thereΓÇÖs the record thatΓÇÖs almost always in my DJ box, one of my favorite 45s ever ΓÇô so exciting when its drums and taunting female chorus kick in over a loud system in a sweaty club, only to be answered by Johnny WatsonΓÇÖs blistering voice and guitar: ΓÇ£I say, I love you.ΓÇ¥ The women singing ΓÇ£Get them women off your mindΓÇ¥ ΓÇô confusingly, I canΓÇÖt get them off my mind.

And the capper? A strong contender for Greatest Song Ever, in its best incarnation: Otis ReddingΓÇÖs ΓÇÿShout BamalamaΓÇÖ. The custodians of the King vaults couldnΓÇÖt come up with this recording for us; for some reason, they found only a tamer mix. I had to dub it off my well-worn 45 (speaking of scratches!).
