,LserEvil,2013-04-08T07:34Z,"Lol explojoseph......

Its not gana take 9 hours... It may say that because of the current ratio but thats because the torrent was just uploaded and thousands of people are downloading it.

Will take 2 hours at most..."
,LserEvil,2013-04-08T07:36Z,"Over 100,000 people will have downloaded this torrent by tomorrow morning.

LOLOLOLOLOLOL"
,phelpz,2013-04-08T07:44Z,"Downloaded in 9 minutes for me, and that was just a couple minutes after it was initially uploaded, so not nearly as many seeds as now.

,victor1947,2013-04-08T11:16Z,"Wow fast download
Thank you"
,Niles,2013-04-08T11:23Z,"When will people get through their heads that from a downloading perspective the ""seeder/leecher"" ratio does not matter. The file is broken into segments and if you need segment x, whether you get it from someone sharing the entire file (seeder) or someone who has so far only downloaded that particular segment is completely irrelevant.

Why PB chose to call ""peers"" for ""leechers"" is a mystery to me, it only adds to the confusion. 

When I look for a torrent, I look for the number of people sharing the file in total. Right now my fastest connection on this torrent is a guy only sharing 38% of the file.. but so what, I'm still getting 800 kb/s from him.

So stop whining about leechers, the more the better."
,lozory,2013-04-08T12:25Z,haha Niles you're new to this huh
,WittoPL,2013-04-08T12:30Z,Great like always! Thanks ettv.

,dshaon,2013-04-08T14:23Z,"Apologies if I am wrong, but i added one subtitle with it, there came some dialogue with Ser Selmy at the beginning, but there isn't any with this rip! It starts directly from the intro music!

Looks like scenes before intro got cut!"
,ph5r,2013-04-08T14:27Z,"Fantastic job with these show uploads, thank you,i did hear HBO was going out of buisiness is it true?"
,gameofgroans,2013-04-08T14:39Z,thanks for posting this man. i'm so glad they are doing season 3 so we can all see how Robb and Catelyn get betrayed by the Freys and die at the infamous 'Red Wedding' by episode 9 or so. damn I hate the starks.

,w00tbie,2013-04-21T04:53Z,thanks ettv for all your awesomeness 
,funseeker521,2013-04-23T06:30Z,"All you stupid cunts complaining about download speed, how fucking dumb are you. If its really taking more than 15 min just restart your computer. Unless you got a static IP you'll get something quicker. Worst case scenario is 45 min. You losers arent ER doctors, you got plenty of time. After 4,000 downloads I have never seen it take as long as the ETA said it would."
