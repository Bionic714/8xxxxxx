,kanamite270,2013-04-08T04:39Z,Thank you very much. You ROCK!!!
,Lorple,2013-04-08T04:41Z,"@HeroMaster FUCK YOU, I WONT DO WHAT YOU TELL ME, but thank you anyway."
,Wintermute00,2013-04-08T06:08Z,"So is there a reason this won't play at all? I have VLC and all the correct codec packs and all that... 

Beware, might be a FAKE, which I've never encountered before. Not trying to troll here, honest. Anyone have any luck playing this?"
,magfibre,2013-04-08T08:23Z,"Yeah I cannot play it either. I don't think it is a fake, it is just a corrupt upload."
[V],HeroMaster,2013-04-08T09:20Z,"@Wintermute00 Try to update your VLC Player or try it on other player, as own my side it is working fine.

@magfibre It is neither fake nor it is corrupt, the video is fine, on my VLC player it is working fine, try to update your player and then try it because sometimes mkv files just dont fit in good."
,Wintermute00,2013-04-08T09:29Z,"So in other words, DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS VERSION...."
,Wintermute00,2013-04-08T10:02Z,"Aw damn, of course I can't delete that last comment...

I'll try updating my VLC and see if that helps."
,j0lly1,2013-04-08T15:57Z,you guys probably didn't let your torrent finish 100%... works fine just like any other week
,kelleytoons,2013-04-08T17:31Z,"Works fine even with the WD Live player (which can sometimes be picky about mkv files).

Thanks!"
,Wintermute00,2013-04-09T00:52Z,"Hmm... My VLC is the current version (2.05 twoflower)... And yeah, I let it download 100% >.<

Although Windows does say the file is 1.65gb instead of 1.66gb, but I think that's just because TPB rounds up when it's close. *shrug* I don't know, but if it works for some people, cool. I already downloaded a different version that worked, so I'm happy. Going to get a 1080 version anyway. Sorry for telling people not to download this, I don't know if there's a way to delete old comments :/"
