,JeffMiller1984,2013-04-08T06:43Z,Audio out of sync.
,x.h8tr.x,2013-04-08T06:43Z,"Audio is out of sync, badly on the immerse release. Unwatchable."
,tastypic,2013-04-08T06:44Z,"Audio is hastened. 

Correctable in VLC with a -2.0 sec setting. Good quality otherwise."
,justoned420,2013-04-08T06:46Z,I don't understand how someone can post this without at least watching the first few seconds!  Audio sync is several seconds off.
,tastypic,2013-04-08T06:47Z,Actually the audio is all fucked up. The sync changes multiple times within the ep. Not worth downloading.
,justoned420,2013-04-08T06:50Z,@tastypic - not really correctable as the audio goes further out of sync as it is played
,ggoerl,2013-04-08T08:06Z,immerse has shit releases this is the second time I've wasted my time downloading a 720p house of lies episode that has had a/v sync issues. Don't waste your time on this.
,vatel88,2013-04-08T17:51Z,STOP UPLOADING YOUR TRASH TV TEAM! NO ONE LIKES YOU!!! GO FUCK A DONKEY!
,eaglstk,2013-04-08T20:09Z,"Immerse is mostly fine, at least, for the few shows I watch.  I never found a problem before this one.  And on this one, as tastypic wrote, the audio sync changes, so to fix it would require a video editor, not merely remuxing.  

TVTeam, how about re-encoding your high-res original and re-upping? "
,Manimal18,2013-04-09T02:08Z,Audio is WAY out of sync...AGAIN.
