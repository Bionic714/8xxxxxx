,newslime,2013-04-08T08:32Z,"Decent speeds 
Started at 300-400kb/s but then went up to 1.5~2.0mb/s

Video and audio are decent for the filesize, meaning the video isn't perfect. Still perfectly watchable and enjoyable.

Download just finished and file is fine. Video quality maybe 8/10 but perfectly watchable and no surprises."
