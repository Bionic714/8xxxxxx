You think you're prepared, but you're not. You've been decisive in your actions up to this point, but now things have been turned upside down. You feel you've conformed your mindset and are ready to accept what you're about to experience, but you haven't. That's because SHRUGGED is back and ready to blow your mind! Theo and his friends are entering their final year of high school, and even though Ange and Dev are still along for the ride, a host of new characters have joined in on the adventure! But, everything isn't all fun and games this time around as an evil force has also returned and is preparing to silence those voices inside their heads...permanently. If you thought you knew what fear was, you haven't seen anything yet!
