This is definitely not See Dad Run.
This is an episode of ""Wendell and Vinnie"", with Nicole Sullivan 
and Jerry Trainor.... imdb.com/title/tt2477858/

This release has not been nuked by The Scene, so there is no successor...yet.
We'll keep an eye on it and post the PROPER or REPACK if/when it becomes available."
[T],MrUnpopular,2013-04-08T18:38Z,It has since been nuked.
,EyezGl,2013-04-08T19:41Z,Not see dad run.
,KESThai,2013-04-09T05:58Z,Replacement links please.
,BoonesFerry,2013-04-09T07:08Z,"This release was finally acknowledged by The Scene as flawed and has been Nuked, but so far there is 
no proper or repack. With more popular show there are multiple Scene groups who will cap a show and 
if one release is flawed then another release takes its place fairly quick. But in this case, a less popular 
show, there may have only been one capper, and if that's the case then we may have to wait for the 
episode to re-air before it is capped again. [shrugs] We will just have to wait and see.

Reminder: EZTV has no contact with ""The Scene"". EZTV does not cap (record) tv shows and has no control over what shows are chosen by The Scene, the container (file format), the video resolution (SD or 720p), or the season/episode numbering scheme, etc.. These are all functions of The Scene, not EZTV. EZTV is a torrent distribution group only."
