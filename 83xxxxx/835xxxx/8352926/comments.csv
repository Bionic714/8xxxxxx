,Kleavage,2013-04-08T06:11Z,What does EVOLVE and IMMERSE mean?
,William412,2013-04-08T07:02Z,"Haha it is really amazing how people who have the chance to get this kind of shows and watch 'em in perfect quality still asks for shitty quality as 360p - 480p is. C'mon you all cunts please enjoy this Breathtaking series by watching it on HD. There's nothing better than watching all thoses scenes and fields and battles in such amazing quality. 
-So Thx Eztv. Fucking love this show!"
,tetnem,2013-04-08T07:24Z,thnx!
,tetnem,2013-04-08T07:28Z,"PLease, please don't minimize the size. It's just fine with the quality you are given us. I don't care about the file size. I would be much more grateful if I could get the episode in full resolution, 1080p or 1080ip. That would be great. 

And for those who want a smaller file size, go to hell! XD"
,kodokapi,2013-04-08T07:42Z,Thank you eztv!!
,BoonesFerry,2013-04-08T07:48Z,"@mandy12 -- I totally undertand the need for smaller file sizes. You are not alone, there are people with a monthly bandwidth limit or who play on portable devices. However, EZTV only torrents SD (standard definition, typically 720x404) and 720 (typically 1280x720).  Smaller sizes are occaisionally available by other torrent groups, or individuals. 

@Kleavage -- IMMERSE and EVOLVE are names of ""Scene"" groups who cap (record) the shows. EZTV, TvTeam, ettv, etc, are names of Torrent groups. A torrent title consists of:
Show name, season/episode, dimension (SD is default), source (almost always HDTV), the name of The Scene group that capped the episode, and sometimes a torrent group name is added at the end. 

@William412 -- Simma down warrior man. lol. Some people need the smaller file sizes. 
But for show with a lot of actions scenes and or special effects, like you, I prefer 720

to the people complaining about the size you can always download the standard one , but i'd rather watch this in HD ofcourse, who still download 360p-480p >."
,hachiko00,2013-04-08T13:30Z,"@mandy12, fuck you, you stupid cunt. Go to the OTHER torrents that are NOT HD if you want a smaller size. "
,mirelsalaj,2013-04-08T14:13Z,very slowwwww seed guys pls
,downlode,2013-04-08T14:18Z,"Why do some of you feel the need to use swear words, or even attack someone because they make a request, is it that you have such a low opinion of yourself that doing do makes you feel 'superior'? we all have different requirements depending on one's 'situation',  I'd personally prefer a somewhat larger file for even better quality on a large screen, that doesn't make me an asswipe. 
Calm down guys n gals and enjoy the show.*Thanks for the upload."

,ectoendomezo,2013-04-08T15:47Z,"Have to chime in..

But first..thanks for the share..much appreciated..

File Size..I started years ago..going for 700mg films etc..

Now I'm conducting the laborious process of Replacing...all of them with Much Bigger Files..I now prefer films..especially ANYTHING with 'Smoke'..'Water' (especially Under Water) 'Forest Shots' lots of 'Night' or 'Dark'...and frankly..they are almost Different Movies..the difference is that significant.

Last year..and the year previous I obtained GOT in the 300mg range..and now am replacing those as well..

1G + for a high-end show like this is GREAT.

Please keep it there...

Thanks again."
,Bud625,2013-04-08T17:18Z,Anyone know if there are any files out there in 5.1 surround sound? The only one I can find listed appears to be in Portuguese

,robin.wingard,2013-04-08T17:54Z,@tetnem They are only streamed in 720p and I highly dought you would even want 1080i even if they did.

,slasklxxv,2013-04-09T22:22Z,Anyone else having issues with the sound using PS3 media server? Same issue with E01 but can't seem to find the source of the problem.
,extremeleif,2013-04-10T15:57Z,"I´ve also got that soundproblem with PMS. It works just fine until the titlesong, then it sounds like it´s backwards or something. :("
,904utjzfd,2013-04-10T17:19Z,A workaround I found with PMS is to force stereo sound by setting the Maximum Number of audio channels to 2 for AC-3 re-encoding under Common Transcode Settings.  The show starts in stereo but then changes to 5.1.. and PMS apparently can't handle it.  If anyone knows of another way let me know.
