,pengouin007,2013-04-08T05:50Z,fucking insane ratio..... !!!!!
,soviet001,2013-04-08T06:34Z,"Why can't ettv 1-up eztv (or just for the sake of modernity) and upload HD releases too?? It blows my mind, I just don't understand -- you've obviously got good encoding abilities, so why not make a similarly neatly packaged hd release of an hd show? Meaning, what's wrong with higher resolution? Dimension uploads "
,soviet001,2013-04-08T06:37Z,"tend to come out 5-10 mins earlier than both ettv & eztv, yet have higher resolution. Even if you're catering to slow to mid-speed DSL, it's 2013 and even in Khyrgistan they're not paying by the minute like 2-3 years ago (even if running dial-up), so why not increase file size and resolution?? Thanks for your uploads, & I'm not saying w/ respect to ettv and eztv that 1 is better but why not finally do SOMEthing to outshine or at least standout SOMEwhat from the other? Thanks for reading this if you did, and hope you take at least part of it into account! :)"
