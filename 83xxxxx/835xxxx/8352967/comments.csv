,WWEps,2013-04-08T05:44Z,slow as fuck...
,onerok,2013-04-08T05:47Z,"really dude? of course its fucking slow, it literally just came out, don't be a dumbass!

Thanks uploader!"
,sngrsfamous,2013-04-08T05:49Z,is this the whole 3 hours? cuz for that size idk?
,FearNickB,2013-04-08T05:51Z,Thanks
,leftofright92,2013-04-08T05:53Z,what is the quality of this. low bandwidth so I don't want to start to find out that its not worth watching
,JHackerX,2013-04-08T05:54Z,482MB? I seriously doubt this is Wrestlemania 29 in full. Think I'll wait for another post that has a size more legit and believable than 482MB.
[V],loverulz,2013-04-08T05:54Z,THE QUALITY IS VERY WATCHABLE AND A FULL PAY PER VIEW SO DONT MAKE UR FOOL COMMENTS ABOUT QUALITY AND SPEED ENJOY THE SHOW... 
,DjKiel,2013-04-08T05:55Z,@WWEps considering it just went up 8mins ago why are u complaining about speed liek get the fuck over it u cry baby atleast he took the time to upload this for ur poor ass next time u want it fast PAY FOR IT U FUCKING GOOF AND PVR IT 
,roc009,2013-04-08T05:57Z,"but wweps, that is a good thing...lol"

,dog19652575,2013-04-08T05:59Z,is this the fucking preshow or the whole thing if its preshow buildup you are a real fucking asshole!!
,RBishop,2013-04-08T05:59Z,"Can't be the real thing, way too small for the entire show."
,shawn998,2013-04-08T06:02Z,how come the size is only 482 Mb 
,WWEps,2013-04-08T06:08Z,.

,ed1032,2013-04-08T06:10Z,"There is no way that this is legit. Wrestlemania is a 4 hour show. Even in standard def, it's gonna be nearly 2 gigs."
[V],loverulz,2013-04-08T06:12Z,J
,cruiserblade77,2013-04-08T06:16Z,thanx loverulz.............wats the duration of the show???????
[V],rr-ne,2013-04-08T06:22Z,sorry but i think the quality is bad!! havent seen it yet but for 482 mb?? bitrate must be very low
,captnick2,2013-04-08T06:24Z,"loverulz thanx for the upload but it would be really helpfull if you write the details of the torrent in the description. 

Does it have pre show too? "
,tDotD,2013-04-08T06:26Z,"What-the-fuck is WRONG with you assholes?
Have you even looked to see what this guy's upload history is?
Obviously not!
And this guy takes the time to put up a quick version for people who want to see it right away and you fuckheads bitch and whine.  
Like @DjKiel said . . you want it hi-res right away?
Pay for it!  
You guys are just stoopid.
Sorry @loverulz . ..no good deed goes unpunished, TRUELY."
,captnick2,2013-04-08T06:28Z,"loverulz thanx for the upload but it would be really helpfull if you write the details of torrent in the description.

,galaxybay,2013-04-08T06:32Z,"this is the legit torrent , the uploaded is the VIP and he also uploaded some previous pay per view too of same sizes . "

,kenisio,2013-04-08T08:07Z,seed plz
,fruitydrink,2013-04-08T08:08Z,"This is the whole show, broken up into 14 parts and VERY low quality. Worse than 240p. Ripped from a low-quality stream, I'd guess. It was good for those who wanted WM29 asap, but better quality options are up now."
,AntonGarciaBITW,2013-04-08T08:43Z,SEED SEED!!!!!!!!!!
,leftofright92,2013-04-08T08:47Z,great for the first upload. quality could be alot better. v-3 a-8. It's watchable if your not patient enough for an HD. Thanks for the upload. Downloaded surprising fast.
