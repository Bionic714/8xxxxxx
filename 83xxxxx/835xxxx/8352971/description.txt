The search for the national best cabin crew is on again. Every steward and stewardess is anxious and looking forward to the competition. The top 12 finalists are finally selected, including Dania and Tania. Bella is the winner of the previous year's competition from a competitor's airline who is beautiful, graceful, super-efficient, young, and an overall favourite as the winner. Curious to find out what is so special about Tania, Dania sneaks on board one of Tania's flights without thinking in order to check out how Tania treats the passengers and how she performs her on-board tasks. But Dania is unlucky, just minutes after sneaking in, a load of passengers come in, and Dania is unable to get out. Then the plane takes off. What will happen to Dania now?
