"Who Done Did It?"

When Arianna The Bear is rude to Donna, Cleveland 
defends her honor by egging Arianna's house. But 
when Cleveland starts seeking revenge on everyone 
in Stoolbend, things get out of hand and he's 
accused of a murder he didn't commit. Meanwhile, 
in a murder mystery parody, Freight Train, Rallo 
and Junior try to exonerate Cleveland.
