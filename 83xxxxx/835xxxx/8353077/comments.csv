,Sdarts,2013-04-09T15:49Z,"Dibya, first, thanks for torrenting high quality episodes for everyone week after week for some years now.
Thank you very much!!!

Second, do you (or if you know any group) intend to release the 1080p or at least the 720p WEB-DL from iTunes?

Asking because in the past you released scene group's CtrlHD 720p WEB-DL episodes of Mad Men's Season 5.

Also, group NTS (never heard of them) released the 1080p WEB-DL of the first part of season 6's premiere.

PS. Before anyone says it, why not get it from them, like stated above, I never heard of them, if you say other groups aren't releasing it or you won't, them I try their version.

Thanks in advance and keep the excellent work.
