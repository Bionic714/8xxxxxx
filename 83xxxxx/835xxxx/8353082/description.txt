    Loona is a masterpiece of modern Punjabi poetry. A verse-play, published in 1965, Loona is based on the legend of Puran Bhagat.

        The Legend:

        King of Sialkot marries a young girl Loona. She falls for his son (from 1st wife) Puran who is of her age. He declines her advances; she complains abt him; heΓÇÖs punished (hands/feet amputated and thrown into a well). A guru rescues him; he gets well and becomes a Bhagat. Years later, Loona still childless comes to ΓÇ£the BhagatΓÇ¥. The truth comes out; she admits her mistake; he forgives them and wishes a child, Rasalu.

    ThatΓÇÖs how the legend of Puran Bhagar has been told in Punjab for nearly two thousand years. But thatΓÇÖs not how Shiv tells is. For Shiv, itΓÇÖs the legend of Loona: a girl of lower caste, married against her wishes, falls in love with a man of her age. So what? he asks and retells the legend and makes it about Loona, not the prince-turned-bhagat. A masterpiece at the age of 28! ThatΓÇÖs called a great poet.
