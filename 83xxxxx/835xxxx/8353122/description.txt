Stuck in a dead-end job at a call center, Alex dreams of a life in rock 'n' roll. Earlier ditched by his band and his girlfriend, he is given a second chance by his former keyboardist to provide a track for a new compilation CD. Alex is given two nights to cut this in a state of-the-art recording studio. The only caveat is that he is locked into the facility overnight. Then, as Alex is fine-tuning his track he is greeted by hysterical screams. Soon afterwards he isolates a segment of music from an incoming song on the radio and, hidden within it, he clearly hears the words 'help me'
