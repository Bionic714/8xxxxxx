MLKΓÇÖs Dream of Economic Justice-PBS Moyers and Company 040513 PTC
April 5, 2013

Martin Luther King, Jr., who died 45 years ago this month, had long known that racial equality was inextricably linked to economic equity ΓÇö fairness for all, including working people and the poor. In the last year of his life, Dr. King announced the Poor PeopleΓÇÖs Campaign to demand an ΓÇ£Economic Bill of RightsΓÇ¥ for all Americans, regardless of color. But nearly a half-century later, that dream is still a dream deferred. Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Taylor Branch and author and theologian James Cone join Bill to discuss Dr. KingΓÇÖs vision of economic justice, and why so little has changed for AmericaΓÇÖs most oppressed.

Also on the show, poet Kyle Dargan talks about his efforts to reconcile disparate cultural environments through poetry.
