Thanks to original uploader Daveg. Who's done a great job compiling the bits and pieces of this TV broadcast.


"2 mins 11 secs of video grabs were used 
to fill in the missing video and chapter 7 has an extra 20 secs of video on the end of Lotus on Irish Streams 
it was used to find a better spot to end piano solo (in my opinion both of these work much better) the audio 
syncing really only starts from 2 min 45 secs on the DVD very few will even notice the filler video/audio matching 
I'e seen many different copies of these 2 parts over the years and now synced to this audio and watching the DVD 
this is the best version I've seen.....recommended upgrade ... I hope the complete concert gets an offical release "
