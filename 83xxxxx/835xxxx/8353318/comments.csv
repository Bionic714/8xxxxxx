[T],theburningbush,2013-04-08T23:41Z,"Say, magmaz, how about a little sleuthing on your own before you waste others' time?

Last ep of Californication (or ""califronication,"" in your language) for Season 6: S06E12 (http://epguides.com/Californication/). (Gee, that was hard!)

Torrents for Californication.s06e12: https://thepiratebay.sx/search/Californication.s06e12/0/7/0 . (Hmmm...major league rocket science there!)

Well, let's see now...garsh...Californication.s06e12 was uploaded way back on April 1...a whole week ago!

Now, I hope it doesn't blow your little mind that some eps are actually available via torrent *before* they're broadcast.

Lesson: Try Google...you'll like it...and you'll begin to quit looking like a dunce who likes to waste everyone else's time.

PPPHHHHHTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

I am sitting here laughing hysterically at the thought of you sitting all alone in your mom's basement getting so mad because some one had the nerve to ask for a show that aired for the first time last night.  All pissed off typing away on your computer cursing to yourself.  ""What the eff is this effen effer asking for a effen A show for G-dammit?  What effen nerve of this mutha-effer.  Now I need to type a message to belittle this person I've never met so I can feel great about myself and my ability to Google search.  Aren't I awesome?  Boy am I lonely.  Mom is dinner ready yet?  Did you wash the skid marks out of my undies for me?  ect. ect""  
Yes the torrent did come out a week ago but that was only because Showtime has been releasing it a week early on their website.  It even says original air date on 4/7 on your little link.  So, why would a person even think to google a show that they knew was on that night?  And if he did google it, he would have seen the release date being last night and then would have asked the same question in the same pleasant manner that he did.  Which brings me to my point.  You're a douche.

P.S. I do realize the irony of me writing this message effectively doing the same thing right now that I am criticizing this dude for doing.  Only difference is that I am asking my wife if my undies are clean. "
