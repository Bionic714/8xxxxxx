,MavinJar,2013-04-12T12:55Z,Seed please
,evman1986,2013-04-18T13:18Z,every one should see this at least once it's very bloody but very good i know the directer of this movie joshua oppenheimer
,timothx,2013-04-18T21:09Z,I am looking forward to watching this documentary. I am writing a paper about Indonesia for school.
,evman1986,2013-04-22T17:00Z,saltywolf where did you get this movie from
,oyajisan,2013-04-22T21:13Z,"Thanks a lot for this :) Too bad for the m4v video format though, my TV doesn't play that format, I'm gonna have to watch it on my computer."
,saltywolf,2013-04-30T07:43Z,"evman1986, I got it from one of my friends who also knows the director."
,saltywolf,2013-04-30T07:45Z,"evman1986, I got it from one of my friends who was raised in Indonesia. He also knows the director."
,TAOKJagal,2013-04-30T13:34Z,"Dear Saltywolf and all seeders and leechers.
I am a human rights activist in Indonesia. I have spent the last 8 months screening the film here in secret.
You are sharing an early rough cut of the film. It doesn’t have correct and final audio picture and subtitles.
MUCH MORE IMPORTANT there are serious safety and humanitarian concerns about the old version you are sharing. I can explain these to you in detail, if you would contact me immediately on taok.humanrights@gmail.com
If you do care about the issues raised in the film PLEASE STOP sharing this version. 
Regards,
An Indonesian human rights activist and ACT OF KILLING fan"
,Merdek,2013-05-01T09:46Z,"Dear TAOKJagal,
Thank you for your work in relation to this film. I am also in Indonesia and as you must know, there are many many people here who need to see this film that can't because they're not part of the very limited university/cafe/activist scene where it has so far been shown. And as we also both know, the government isn't going to allow it a theatrical release here. So, if your concerns are about something in this version - which to be honest is extremely similar to the one I've already seen at an ""officially"" organised screening here - which really does seriously endanger someone who worked on it, for example, then I think that if you are truly concerned about that then you are morally obliged to release a ""correct"" version for download. 
Also note that the majority of people seeding will never come back to this page and see your comment, so the torrent can't be stopped even if the original uploader wanted to. 
The only way to stop people seeing this ""wrong"" version at this stage is for you to upload the final version - I can personally guarantee to seed it - with a good introduction so people choose to download it instead of this one.
Please consider doing so.
Selamat Hari Buruh Internasional!"

,JakartaBoy,2013-05-02T02:28Z,"TAOKJagal, I agree with the comments above: a LOT of people really want to see the film. The distributors are making that extremely difficult. Not everyone is in the very small circle of activists who can attend screenings at expensive Kemang cafes. If it isn't made more widely available, you can be 100% that people WILL download it! And then they'll copy it and give it to friends who don't know how to download. As a filmmaker, if you'd heard of this film but couldn't otherwise access it, isn't that what YOU would do?! Or would you just refrain from watching it?! Be realistic: it's out there now. If you're major concern really is related to security, then RELEASE A VERSION THAT DOESN'T ENDANGER ANYONE. Until that happens, everyone else: SEED!!!!"
,JakartaBoy,2013-05-02T02:31Z,"I encourage everyone who downloads this film to burn at least two copies, and to pass on the disk to friends who should do the same."
,saltywolf,2013-05-02T13:13Z,I'm glad to see people care so much about people seeing this film. It's why I uploaded it in the first place. I agree with Merdek and if a better version appears I will seed it instead of this version.
,TAOKJagal,2013-05-08T14:39Z,"Merdek yang baik,

Betul bahwa dalam dunia per-torrent-an ini, apalagi di Pirate Bay, dengan semangat membajak sebagai hak azasi, tentu saja untuk mengurangi persebaran versi non-final tersebut, film versi final perlu dibuat online juga. Seperti sebuah kompetisi bebas.

Teman-teman yang telah menyebarkan film ini di Indonesia saat ini menyediakan 1.000 keping DVD dan ongkos kirim gratis bagi penonton di Indonesia. Pada akhirnya, persebaran lewat internet hanya menguntungkan bagi mereka yang punya sambungan internet baik, sementara lewat distribusi DVD di Indonesia, telah diadakan setidaknya 300 lebih pemutaran, dan mencapai peminat di Kalabahi, Pulau Alor. Saya kira ini jauh lebih efektif daripada mengunggahnya ke internet, kalau memang yang dituju adalah masyarakat Indonesia.

Jika Anda ingin film ini tersebar dengan baik di Indonesia, Anda bisa hubungi kami. Anda juga boleh mengusulkan komunitas/kelompok/organisasi yang sebaiknya kami hubungi untuk membantu menyebarluaskan film ini dengan mengadakan pemutaran film versi final di komunitasnya.

Salam hangat dari Indonesia.

,Lovevolution,2013-05-29T18:19Z,"This is I think what TAoK HR said:

Please seed this one instead:

http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8518979
Seed this one, the director's cut, final version.

Much better.

This one has been color corrected, sound-mixed, and its subtitle has been fixed."
