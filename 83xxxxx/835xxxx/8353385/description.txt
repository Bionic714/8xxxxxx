This torrent is a complete audio rip of the website In the Studio with Redbeard (http://www.inthestudio.net/). It contains all the MP3s streaming on the website as of April 8th, 2013. 

Redbeard has been a rock radio personality since the 1970s. For over four decades, he has conducted in-depth interviews with legends of rock on his nationally syndicated show "In the Studio with Redbeard." Each interview focuses on a specific album or subject, and each runs about 20 minutes in length (some have multiple parts). 

The torrent is broken up into three sections: In the Studio radio interviews, online exclusive interviews (these were not broadcast on the radio show and only available on the website), and live tracks (these include in-studio and live performances from a variety of artists). 

If you are a fan of rock music and like hearing interviews from the musicians about the creation of the albums, and behind-the-scenes stories, I highly recommend downloading this torrent. It will keep you engrossed for hours and hours on end. I haven't seen this offered anywhere else, and I wrote a custom program just to be able to download the files. So it's something you can't get anywhere else. 

There are 288 MP3s in total. All tracks are encoded at 128kbps and downloaded unaltered from the site, aided by a custom Java script using the excellent library jsoup. All files are fully tagged with consistent filenames, and are tidy and well-organized.
