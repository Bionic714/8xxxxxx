also, there are other eps of the 1963 series, I know of two (Honor Ranch and Great Manhunt) , and therefore probably many more. "

,BadNix,2013-04-09T03:20Z,I tried to find the 1958 videos but was unable to find them. I have found what I could on the internet but if somebody else can find them I would be more than glad to grab them.
,BadNix,2013-04-11T04:32Z,"So many hit and runs, would be nice to see more seeders than me. "
