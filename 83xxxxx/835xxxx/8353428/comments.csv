,jstriker,2013-04-09T20:29Z,"720 x 406 is not 720p

It is 480p NTSC at a 16:9 Widescreen dimensions.  

However, since true 480p NTSC is 720x480 there will likely be black bars if converted to a DVD, even more so for PAL TVs in Europe. (720x576)

That means this video is EDTV (Enhanced Definition TV) not HDTV. 

Uploader would have been more accurate to say DVD quality or 480p(NTSC) or EDTV."
