We're not going to be able to help unless you go on line and actually UP the torrent FIRST - then we can take over and make your torrent a success.  

We're waiting. . . .  for YOU!  "
,LeKirtap,2013-04-09T18:41Z,I'm sorry about that. Something seems to be wrong. This is my second upload so please have some indulgence. I did a test upload (https://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8334149/Friend_Of_A_Friend_Vol._01) which downloads without problems. I don't know what went wrong but I'm going to look into it asap. I wont be home for 24 hours+ though (I'm on a different computer now) but I'll see if I can fix whatever went wrong or try to reupload. Thanks for commenting and sorry for the inconvenience. I don't want to waste anyones time and I to hate it when people upload and don't seed.
,LeKirtap,2013-04-09T19:00Z,"Thank You for commenting. I'm sorry but something seems to be wrong. This is my first couple of uploads so please bear with me. I did a testupload (https://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8334149/Friend_Of_A_Friend_Vol._01) which seemed to download fine but actually stalls at 99,9%. I don't have access to my computer at the moment since I'm not at home for another 24 hours. Maybe it has restarted or something. I will look into it asap. If I can't get this torrent to work I will reupload.
Sorry for the inconvenience."
,terrenmcconn,2013-04-10T08:06Z,"OK, I won't declare it dead just yet.  I'll give you all the time you need.  Good luck, I know you'll figure it out.  "
,terrenmcconn,2013-04-16T19:56Z,"Well, we're up to 81%.  That's something.  But it's taken about a week to do it.  But there's still people waiting.

Dead?  Maybe. . . . "
