Your videos provide the detail more akin to a DVD or SD release rather than that of a BD or HD video encoded with a respectable bit rate.

Please stop posting your videos in the HD section. They do not meet the standards of many people browsing this section.

How many times do we have to tell someone this... Seriously, a comment like this shows up every HD video. 1080p is 1920 pixels wide OR 1080 pixels vertical. The aspect ratio of cinema isn't 16:9. "

Absolutely amazing. If this received poor reviews, its because the watcher had poor taste. Its a action/drama, filled the bill, and exceeded. Great story line, could of been more engaging at times, but no complaints."

,chapter81,2013-04-28T19:36Z,"""Any display device that advertises 1080p refers to the ability to accept 1080p signals in native resolution format, which means there are true 1920 pixels in width and 1080 pixels in height, and the display is not overscanning, underscanning, or reinterpreting the signal to a lower resolution.""

Can someone please explain me why motherparker is wrong? To me, since the beginning of time, 1080p means AT LEAST 1080 pixels in height. Since this copy has only 800 pixels in height, it's a little bit far from being 1080p. And don't give me that shit about aspect ratio. It could be 2400x1020, still it wouldn't be 1080p. 
And if you say that ""well, he's just implying something, it's not the true resolution, but you get an idea"", then you must be very happy fucking trans believing they're a woman. ""Well, they have long hair, tits, wear makeup and are feminine...yeah, they have a penis also, but you get the idea, it's just a small detail after all""."
,alexslife,2013-04-28T21:59Z,"For the average middle age balding man, YIFY movies that are 720p resolution yet DVD quality these would be fine...

For the rest of us who want quality and DTS surround....this is not up to my standards"
,innerwave,2013-05-05T02:31Z,"ok, for the whiners that are complaining that this isnt hd. its a hell of a lot better than dvd. i have dvd files on my hd. there is a huge difference. and yes, there is a huge difference between yify's releases and what you call hd. however, there is also a huge difference in file size too. i have a few direct bray copies on my hd. they range from 12 to 24 gig. that uses up a lot of space. i can tell you that if i went that way with most of my movies, my collection would be considerably smaller. so, i would rather have the balance of what yify provides with quality vs file size. and with all due respect, if your complaining about the quality of  something that is not only free, but illegal, then you have more issues than whether or not the movie is up to your standards.
