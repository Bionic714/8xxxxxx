Ok Simple instructions go to my YouTube Channel I have a complete how to for this whole processes.
But if you are stubborn its still easy I made sure it was. Just fallow the steps below.
1: Shut down Gmod not required to exit Steam.
2: Navigate to you GarryΓÇÖs Mod Game Folder.
Usual Directory: ΓÇ£ C:Program Files (x86)Steamsteamappssteamidgarrysmodgarrysmod ΓÇ£
3: Unpack all of the RAR files to your desktop 
Do it this way since some versions of Windows will not allow permission for the archive program ( WinRar / 7Zip) to load files directly to the C: drive and my just error without any signs of why. This has happened before so you were just warned!
4: Copy the extracted folders one by one to the garrysmod folder. Make sure to combine any existing folders with the same name and to copy and replace any existing files when prompted to do so.
5: Start Gmod and Play there are no additional settings to change.
If this helped you Please tell a friend Thank You
And donΓÇÖt forget to seed.
