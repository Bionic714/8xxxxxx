,sonicfan2,2013-05-01T13:50Z,i love the show its amazing but i never saw the movie so now im glad i get to see and own the movie :D
,DubKingdom,2013-05-06T20:45Z,I redid this with a better program so the issue aimersoft's program did to the screen ratio is fixed in the other version I posted on kick ass.  Also any of the dvd's which have dual language tracks and subtitles available are uploaded with the different tracks on there. So for those who don't like dubbed they can turn subs and jap audio on instead in programs like VLC.
