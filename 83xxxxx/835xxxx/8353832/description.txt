2002 The Band compilation CD on the Dutch Disky label. Disky also released the compilation The Weight in 1996 and a deluxe re-release of Rick Danko's first solo album in 2000.

The Moon Struck One is more like a Richard Manuel tribute than a Band compilation, since Richard sings lead on all the tracks here (sharing lead vocal with Levon and Rick on some songs, of course).
