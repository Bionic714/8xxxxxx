Ergo Proxy (2006)

Complete series (23 episodes) + opening

Storyline:
Sometime in the distant future, humanity has managed to survive, but only in
isolated cities and through the use of cloning and robotic servants called
Autoraves. Life in the cities is strictly controlled by management dedicated
to preserving their 'utopian' way of life. But something is causing the
Autoraves to become independent and is driving them to seek to escape the
city.
Re-l Mayer, a female inspector from the Citizen Information Board, learns that
the awakening of the Autoraves is caused by an encounter with something called
a Proxy. In seeking to learn more, Re-l stumbles into a secret that management
is desperately trying to hide and will go to any length to keep suppressed.

The small MKV file contains 2 editions :
– All episodes chained but with only a single opening (two actually, because
  of episode 15) and a single ending, no preview. Good for marathoning.
– All episodes, no cut.
These editions use the separate opening file. Individual episodes (03 and
above) contain the opening too, but with a lower video quality.
