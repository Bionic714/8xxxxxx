Workdone:
Ok..some good new for you all that wanted the ending. Well thank my wife cause she found the ending on YouTube of all places. LOL. Ok we used THC source and clean it up better by brighting it up more and for the Youtube video we had to crop out the black borders but only could do so much since there is CAM movements during the video  The video and audio was more then decent. Now for the bad news, which isnt all that bad LOL, but there is still missing footage between THC source and YouTube source which is around 30seconds. Your only missing him handing her the letters. So enjoy! It made my wife happy so it should yours LOL
