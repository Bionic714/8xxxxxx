,alltojah,2013-04-12T17:38Z,"Hi again,

If perhaps you ever come across the discography of the group Truth, it would be super blessed fantastic if you could upload it. Roger Breland was the leader and their music was outstanding, ahead of its time and a definite blessing. I believe they disbanded in 2001 and started in the '70s."
[V],TorrentTracts,2013-04-16T15:14Z,"Alltojah, Truth has a very storied carrier and a portfolio of nearly 50 albums.  This, you already know.  Sadly, I only have 3 of those albums.

The problem I have with a band that used a common word for it's name (such as ""truth"") is it's so very difficult to detect as music, or search out.  And I think that's why there are only 3 of 50 sitting in my collection today.  Hardly enough to make a discography.  :("
[V],TorrentTracts,2013-04-16T15:15Z,"Soulmuziq, I do indeed have that Kingdom Business 4 album, but there are two problems.  (1) It's a 2012 release, so I can't bundle it with my 2013 releases, and (2) I've already uploaded a Canton Jones discography before I have KB4.  So I can't make a new discography.  Nor do I torrent single albums.  :("
[V],TorrentTracts,2013-04-16T15:17Z,"Xandrew, please show a little patience.  My internet connection has been unstable for most of the year.  I could take that as a sign not to share any more music, or I could continue sharing if you can exercise a little patience with me.  Your choice."
[V],TorrentTracts,2013-04-16T15:21Z,"Littleredcorvet, yes to Fred Hammond and no to Kurt Car.  That's the good and bad news.  But here's the thing.  I will be torrenting my 13th bundle momentarily today, and since it was already 2 gigs in size, the Fred Hammond release wouldn't fit.  So it will have to wait until my 14th release.  Hopefully, in that time, I can also come across a copy of Kurt Carr for you too."
,littleredcorvet,2013-04-16T19:29Z,thanks much
