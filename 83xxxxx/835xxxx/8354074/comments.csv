Internet charges are very high at my place ;) 

No offence here however, would be really helpful for people like me if you can reduce the upload size.

Keeps the great work.

Cheers, God bless !!!"

,hsotnas,2013-04-08T18:57Z,"OOPS, my mistake ! I realised that just now when I saw your reply as well saw completed download.

I will be careful next time onwards ;-) My bad, simply lost around 250 MB or so...

SyndromeOfADown, Thanks for your suggestion :) Appreciated."

,hsotnas,2013-04-11T18:18Z,"hey Inspiron,

Do you have any personal website or a blog, where we can request for trance singles to be included in upcoming Trance Philosophy episodes ?

By the way, downloaded all the existing episodes, love your choices !

Would you please include ""Yahel - pia no more"" in next episode please ?

Thanks "
