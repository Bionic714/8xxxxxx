A "Documentary" spanning from the Korean Wars to the present.

Quote:

"It is the outstanding feat of Kim Jong Ill that he regarded the People's Army as main force for the completion of socialist course and made Korea a strong military country."

"The people of the world will see more clearly the might of the Korean People's Army, that once determined it will do and win at any cost."

"The stand of the Korean People's Army against imperialist weasels is firm and the riffle of Korea is merciless."

"The army and people of Korea came out in a decisive struggle to defend socialism. The invincible units fought singlehanded against the desperate imperialists."


A good example of bad propaganda work, curiosity behind closed borders that looked like ultrakange Soviet newsreel
