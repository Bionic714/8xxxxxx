About the game:

Amnesia: The Dark Descent is a survival horror video game by Frictional Games, who previously developed the Penumbra series.
Amnesia is an adventure game played from a first-person perspective. 
The game retains the physical object interaction used in the Penumbra series, allowing for physics-based puzzles and interactions such as opening doors and fixing machinery.
Few in-game objects are operated by toggle; to open a door, for instance, the player must hold down a mouse button and then push (or pull) the mouse. 
This gives the player stealth, allowing them to peek out a barely-opened door or open it slowly to sneak away, 
but also adds to the player's sense of helplessness, as it is now entirely possible to attempt to push open a "pull" door whilst danger approaches from behind.
In late August in the year 1839, Daniel, a young man from London, awakens in the dark halls of the Prussian Brennenburg Castle with little to no memory about himself or his past.
All he can remember is his name, that he lives in Mayfair and that something is hunting him.
Shortly after awakening, Daniel discovers a note written to himself, from which he learns that he has deliberately erased his own memory, and that he needs to descend into the Inner Sanctum of the castle to kill the Baron, Alexander......
