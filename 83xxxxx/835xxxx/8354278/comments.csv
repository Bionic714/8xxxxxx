,mizar,2013-04-12T22:45Z,Thanks! My Dreamweaver was becoming Crazy!
,rocket221,2013-04-16T20:47Z,"Thanks, it's working for me."
,mazz921,2013-04-28T03:03Z,"Thanks, Working perfectly. CPU is running less."
,raizenshin,2013-05-08T14:02Z,"After using this, I opened Dreamweaver and I found that ""Product Registration..."" under the Help menu is still clickable (its not grayed-out)

I clicked it and it says, ""Your trial will expire in 0 days""

Did I do something wrong or does the crack really work like this??"
,DalmaPirat,2013-05-08T19:09Z,"@raizenshin
1. I do not see ""Product Registration..."" under the Help menu. Are you using DW CS6?
2. Why the hell would you reg a cracked software?
3. Is DW CS6 working for you? If it does - do not touch anything else :)

@every1 else: NP ppl, you are welcome."
,raizenshin,2013-05-08T23:44Z,"Yes I use DW CS6

I clicked Product Registration out of curiosity (I also have a cracked Photoshop CS6 and under its Help menu ""Product Registration"" ""Deactivate"" and ""Updates"" are all grayed-out. So I found it odd when they weren't the same after I coped this dll into Dreamweaver"
,DalmaPirat,2013-05-09T02:00Z,"@raizenshin
Yap, I guess I know what you mean, but sadly I do not use PS. Guess Adobe software updates are shared among components, so it consider you are using the latest version.
Nothing else is going trough my head about that issue.
Again you didn't answered me if DW is working as it should?"
,raizenshin,2013-05-09T11:13Z,"@DalmaPirat
It seems to be fine, I've been using it for 2 days now."
,S.I.C.,2013-05-20T02:08Z,"CONFIRMED.

Installed DW CS6 from thethingy and replaced stock .dll file with this and DW's CPU usage drops to 0% when not in used. Thanks thethingy and DamlaPirat!"
