Comedy directed and co-written by 'Family Guy' creator Seth MacFarlane. Mark Wahlberg stars as John, a man whose Christmas wish as a child was that his teddy bear, Ted (played by MacFarlane using motion capture), would come to life and be his best friend forever. Amazingly, John's wish comes true - but unfortunately Ted turns out to be a swearing, pot-smoking delinquent who reduces John's life to rubble. Mila Kunis and Giovanni Ribisi co-star.
