Set in a world where the remains of the human population live inside cities surrounded by enormous walls due to the sudden appearance of the Titans, gigantic humanoid creatures who devour humans seemingly without reason.


Probably should have included that for those that are curious."

,Taoppvasken,2013-05-09T16:07Z,"Really great quality, thank you very mutch."
,Kleavage,2013-05-09T21:19Z,Is it just me or this doesn't work on VLC?
[V],QborT,2013-05-10T21:36Z,Kleavage -  Personally I use Media Player Classic with the CCCP (combined community codec pack).  both are easily available through a quick google search.
,architeuthis666,2013-05-12T05:40Z,"Just being honest here... I am not loving the encode quality on this. It's a HUGE file size, the quality should be staggeringly good, but there's really blatant macro-blocking, even right from the first few frames when the birds fly by. Maybe it's better on a different player, but I have tried it on DivX Plus Player and on XBMC and got the same blockiness on both.

Seem to be excellent subs tho -- no stupid fonts and minimal liberties taken in the translation. Better than the other group's encode I previewed. Something is wrong with the encode settings though -- I recommend gg fix it and put out some v2's."
,tanker52,2013-05-12T06:35Z,"I noticed that the image was a little choppy in the first few seconds, then it was perfect after that. Almost like it needed time to buffer. I am also using VLC on Mac and I initially thought I was having the same problem as Kleavage because it wasn't playing, but after about 2 minutes, it did start playing. 

I think architeuthis666 has a point with the encoding, however my quality was great after the first 2-4 seconds. It takes VLC about 2 minutes on my mac to start playing and I cannot skip though the track without VLC freezing for a few seconds before resuming. "
,architeuthis666,2013-05-12T17:16Z,"Maybe the  high bitrate is overpowering our wussy little computers... I am on a laptop, and tried it on my Raspberry Pi media center."
[V],QborT,2013-05-12T18:31Z,"Yeah the high bitrate maybe too much for your computers, or it could be the players and codecs you are using.  This episode plays absolutely flawlessly for me, no pixilation of any sort.  

As I already mentioned, I recommend Media Player Classic and CCCP (remember to uninstall other codecs you have installed, having multiple packs can sometimes cause issues)."
,Occular,2013-05-18T03:42Z,"VLC plays sound only with a green screen for video.
Downloaded the media player classic and the cccp as mentioned in QborT's comment and it works perfect on that player.  There is some slight blockiness in the first couple seconds, but it clears up and looks fantastic.  a-9 v-9  
Thanks for the upload!  Always appreciate some new anime on TPB."
