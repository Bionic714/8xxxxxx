JeppFD 2.0.0 cracked version for those who want to get back to this instead of 2.0.5. Your iPad have to be jailbroken to install this file. You need AppSync as well. If you don't know what to do, then in short explanation:

1) from Cydia you have to download the appropriate AppSync for your device.
2) use iFunBox to install ipa on your device. You can get it from www dot i-funbox dot com. (Mac & Win).
3) Choose 'Install App' icon from the menubar.

Let me know if it works.
