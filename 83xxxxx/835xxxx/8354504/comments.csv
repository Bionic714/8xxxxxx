Thanks, and Blessings..."
,UnviolentPeacemaker,2013-04-09T16:01Z,"LochDhueDude, I'm sure you are not so criminally irresponsible as to make such a comment without a profoundly clear sense of what you are talking about - what constitutes violence, what constitutes giviving our children a future, right?  I mean, you aren't stating what you have using the standards of, well, every organization, set of standards,  set of operating beliefs of the Right, Left, and Center in the US that have PROVEN UNEQUVOCALLY that the one thing they are capable of is driving us off the cliff of ecocide, right?  Fact.  So lay it out friend.  Tell me wise sage, how to avert ecocede in the few months our kids have left for us to do so, the alternative being global spiritual, economic, physical violence on a scale 1 million more than the most evil villains ever on this earth could have dreamed of.  Uh, otherwise, keep your mouth shut.   Jesus was violent too, right?  Twisting that whip and driving folks out of the temple.  My guess is that you are an armchair verbal masturbator.  Tell me why I'm incorrect in that, if that is the Truth. "
,UnviolentPeacemaker,2013-04-09T16:05Z,"ps: This isn't a game for me, like I suspect it is for you.  This is Immediate family for me; the current and future 204 billion children facing all but certain ecocidal Hell on earth, cuz folks like you refuse to make that personal to you too, they're my kids.  Violence is Violating what is Right, Conducive to the Wellbeing of those most in danger, most in harms way.  I am NEVER violent.  Tough as nails, harsh when needed?  YES.  I don't play when even ONE of my kids is in harms way, let alone 204 billion.  Why do you?"
