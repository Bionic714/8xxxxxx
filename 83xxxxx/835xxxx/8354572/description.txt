These are serious events, folks. And Jesus and the Bible have been forewarning us of this for centuries. And the warnings have been coming even more urgently in the past few years.

In this book, you will come to understand that Jesus has been very busy giving warnings to us that the Rapture is very, very soon. He has been warning us through various ways ΓÇô some of these ways are: calamities on Earth, through messages given through His faithful prophets, and in visions of Hell and Heaven that He is giving to many people around the world.

Ignore all these warnings at your own eternal risk. Because the events prophesied in the Bible, given to us by God, are sure to come to pass
