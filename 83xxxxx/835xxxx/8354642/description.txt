Full discography of Shyft, underground composer, DJ, and founder of Shyfted Minds Records.  Info on artist, label, and releases below.



Full: Shyft Trakia-Vorga VahtiDahl. Born in Stillwater, Minnesota, United States. Currently resides in Mahtomedi, Minnesota.

This is ShyftΓÇÖs gabber/hardcore/breakcore/drillΓÇÖnΓÇÖbass project. Distorted heavy bass kicks, thick synths, and powerful melodies are the aim here- unless itΓÇÖs chopped up progressive percussion.

Shyft started playing with music composition at age twelve and production at age fourteen in the year 2003.Stubbornness and impatience cause this artist to learn music programming almost entirely first hand and through trial and error. Experimentation is responsible for the final mix of many tracks. Influences come from many places, and not just the gabber or brain dance scene. It ranges from techno, trance and house genre classes to organic genre classes such as folk and metal.

ShyftΓÇÖs musical philosophy focuses on a continuous struggle to make tracks sound better, clearer, and more crisp, as well as breaking down boundaries of genre in terms of both composition and production.

Some where near the beginning of Shyft's musical career the Shyfted Minds label name was being kicked around, but it wasn't until 2008 that the name really went in to use, being an outlet for Shyft's hard core project, Red Ankh, and Philopsycho Lawlawlawl. ┬áThe label today has a heavy focus on electronic hard core with a few other small time artists on board with the most recent projects, but is hoped to expand to other genres and build a community of artists. ┬áIt is headed by Shyft with the support of Kyat Dittman. ┬áUntil 2013 all albums and EPs were released digitally in 320kbps completely free of charge, though donations were accepted. ┬áSince spring of 2013 select releases are provided digitally for sale, due to economic constraints.  If influence is taken from any one other label, it would have to be Cardiac Records.
