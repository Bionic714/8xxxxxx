,svidrigailovjones,2013-04-09T09:19Z,"I am also looking for, Mosaic box set-wise...

Count Basie LIVE Roulette sessions,

Earl Hines,

Ellington Small Groups,

Coleman Hawkins,

Jimmy Lunceford,

and even the Benny Goodman classic sessions, I don't have those either.

Just thought I'd put that out there along with Chu Berry and The complete Count Basie on Verve (don't know if that is Mosaic or not).

Oh yeah, the Art Farmer/Benny Golson as well.

I almost forgot, the complete Sarah Vaughan on Mercury Volumes 1-3 emphasis on volume one.

Well, I won't go on, tempted as I am (Louis Armstrong)."
