Michael Portillo travels to Spain and France to examine the life and work of Pablo Picasso, and reveals how his love of Picasso's art was influenced by his own father, a Spanish republican exile. Michael travels to Malaga, birthplace of the genius, and visits the bullring which inspired some of his greatest works. In the Paris studio where the famous Guernica was painted, he meets Picasso's granddaughter Diana. Salvador Farelo, one of Malaga's greatest bullfighters, tells Michael why bullfighting is so important in Spanish culture, explaining that it is in itself a pure form of art.
