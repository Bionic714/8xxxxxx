Comprehensive Hebrew III includes 30 additional lessons (16 hrs.) which build upon the language skills acquired in Level II.
Level III will double your vocabulary and grammatical structures while increasing your spoken proficiency exponentially. Upon completion of a Level III, you will be able to:

* engage in fuller conversations involving yourself, your family, daily activities, interests and personal preferences,

* combine known elements into increasingly longer sentences and strings of sentences,

* create with language and function in informal situations,

* deal with concrete topics in the past, present, and future,

* meet social demands and limited job requirements,

* begin reading for meaning.

Note: In order for the Pimsleur Method to work correctly, you must first complete the Level II language program before proceeding to the Level III language program.
