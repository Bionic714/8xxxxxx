BioShock.2.PROPER-RELOADED

BioShock is set in 1960, in which the player guides Jack after his airplane crashes in the ocean near the bathysphere terminus that leads to the underwater city of Rapture. Built by the business magnate Andrew Ryan, the city was intended to be an isolated utopia, but the discovery of ADAM, a plasmid which grants superhuman powers, initiated the city's turbulent decline. Jack tries to find a way to escape, fighting through hordes of ADAM-obsessed enemies such as the deadly Big Daddies, while engaging with the few sane humans that remain and eventually learning of Rapture's past. The player, as Jack, is able to defeat foes in a number of ways by using weapons, utilizing plasmids that give unique powers and by turning Rapture's own defenses against them. BioShock includes elements of role-playing games, giving the player different approaches in engaging enemies such as by stealth, as well as moral choices of saving or killing characters.

BioShock 2 is set in the fictional underwater dystopia of Rapture. The game opens with a cutscene set in 1958 then jumps 10 years to when Delta wakes up in 1968, eight years after the events of the first BioShock. The protagonist and player-controlled character is an Alpha series of Big Daddy, a human being that has been mentally conditioned to protect Little Sisters which is amongst the first of its kind. The player-controlled character Big Daddy, named Subject Delta who was previously paired with a single Little Sister, reactivates with no recollection of the past decade's events and scours the city in an attempt to relocate the Little Sister that he was paired with. Fearing this reunion will ruin her plans for the city, Sofia Lamb, the antagonist, sends out her spliced up followers that she calls "The Rapture Family" and new Big Sisters in an attempt to deter Delta.
