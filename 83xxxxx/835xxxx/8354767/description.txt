Well I decided since I had this in my personal music collection of mixes that I would share it here.
These are my personal picks that I started putting together about six years ago and it just kept growing.
Quality is from 128kbps to 320kbps
All are tagged with album artwork so no needing to painstakingly search the net for the right ones(Which I had to do).
Genres include Symphonic,Epic,Rock,Gothic,Nu-Metal and such.
YES I know Cradle of Filth isn't Female-Fronted but there are Women who sing in those particular songs on that certain volume that's included.
So please SEED and enjoy this modest collection.
