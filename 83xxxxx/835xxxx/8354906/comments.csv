,mwisher,2013-04-09T02:10Z,Thats wierd so is the 270 meg version. All due respect to these groups but why do so few of them check their work before releasing it. This is happening so often I'm getting to the point of forcing myself to wait a day first to wait for propers.
,Hancock79,2013-04-09T04:10Z,Most media players can fix an unsynced video for you.  It's certainly not a common occurrence to me and I watch a lot of shows.  I prefer them getting shows out faster.
,Hancock79,2013-04-09T04:48Z,"I mean it's cool if you want to complain, maybe they really should check it more thoroughly it can't take too long and look how competitive and proud their .nfo's sound sometimes.  Just saying we should keep in mind it's a thankless job they're doing for very little if any compensation"
,zak108,2013-04-09T05:32Z,"This one is a bit shit. You can hear the adverts after the breaks, which throws off the sound. A bit annoying, nothing I couldn't fix though. 
I would advise waiting on a better copy."

Could anyone upload a normal version please? Eztv version has the same trouble."
