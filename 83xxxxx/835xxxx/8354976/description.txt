To celebrate the 50th anniversary of the world's longest-running S.F. series, BBC America is going back in time to pay tribute to every incarnation of Doctor Who, from William Hartnell, the original time-traveller, to Matt Smith, the current occupant of the TARDIS.

Every month throughout 2013, The Doctors Revisited will look back at the adventures in time and space of one of the eleven Doctors, featuring discussions with contributors to the show, past and present. Each monthly segment is followed by a classic episode of Doctor Who.

This episode will focus on the 3rd Doctor as played by Jon Pertwee from 1970 to 1974. This upload includes only the first 26 minutes of the special that includes the interviews and retrospective of the Pertwee years. The episode that followed, "Spearhead From Space" is not included here as the first part of this is all I could find elsewhere online.
