,ninothin,2013-04-12T16:43Z,"Gotta love creative anti-piracy code.

Your worms receive mandatory pirate hats, and start all matches poisoned.

,moeburn1,2013-04-13T18:38Z,"Doesn't work, sort of.

Game starts up just fine to make it look like it's working, but it has a F.A.D.E.-like protection system where all your worms will be sick from the start of every match, making them slowly lose HP.  They also aptly have pirate hats on :D"
,bigdrago,2013-04-15T21:03Z,I have HTC One S and it don't work. I created the OBB folder in sdcardObb but the game won't start. Yes I transfered the file.
,Juular,2013-04-16T20:09Z,"Before I waste my time trying to do it, am I suppose to use this with the cracked app store? Because nothing I do with Lucky Patcher will take the clever anti-piracy thing off. I've done plenty of full erases and turned wi-fi off."
,Weedbag,2013-04-20T00:22Z,"Couldn't get it to start :(
Not used to obb files so it could just be me making some kind of mistake."
,Juular,2013-04-21T18:53Z,I can confirm that the droidcrack link works. Thanks a lot!
,DSfreakazoid,2013-04-26T02:40Z,"1. put com.worms2armageddon.app folder in sd/android/obb
2. put apk in a folder just make one called games
3. use astro file manager or whatever u use & go to games folder in ur phone & install apk
4. play"
,moeburn1,2013-04-28T01:06Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD this torrent.  It plays long enough for people to test it for 2 seconds and think it works, but if you actually play the game, you are detected as a software pirate, and it puts little pirate hats on all your worms and makes them sick and slowly lose HP.  

Can we please get rid of this torrent?"
