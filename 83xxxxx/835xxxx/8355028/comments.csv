,DerangedS,2013-04-09T00:53Z,Might just be me but at around 4:20 the audio cuts out and the video lags for a moment. Then returns to the normal with the audio out of sync.
,Hancock79,2013-04-09T01:59Z,so does the 720 version according to someone else.
,shinjukublack,2013-04-09T02:43Z,"It seems like the source is glitched since all versions have the same glitch. This is the 2nd torrent I've tried, both glitched at 4:20, audio out of sync from that point on.

Incidentally, you can hear the tail end of a couple commercials due to the audio glitch."

Im in the process of uploading a fixed copy. but will need seeders as my internet is crappy at the moment. I will link to it when it's ready. Just exporting now."
