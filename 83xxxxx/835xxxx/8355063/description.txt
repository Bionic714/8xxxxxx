The DVD titled ΓÇ£RaptureΓÇ¥ was recorded in 2011, when Arena visited Poland as part of the tour promoting their new release ΓÇ£The Seventh Degree of SeparationΓÇ¥. The album opened a new chapter in the history of the band led since 1995 by two acclaimed musicians: Clive Nolan (Pendragon, Caamora, Shadowland) and Mick Pointer (ex-Marillion). The album was recorded with a new singer, Paul Manzi (Oliver Wakeman Band), the bassist John Jowitt, who returned to the bandΓÇÖs line-up after a several year break, and the guitarist John Mitchell. Filmed in 2011 at Wyspia┼äski Theatre in Katowice, Poland, the DVD features a wide cross-section of ArenaΓÇÖs music, with material ranging from the tracks from the bandΓÇÖs very first release (including The Visitor, Solomon, Crying For Help VII, Ascension) up to their latest songs (The Great Escape, The Seventh Degree Of Separation, Rapture, One Last Au Renoir, The Ghost Walks, What If?, Burning Down).
