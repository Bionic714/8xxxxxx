Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site :: On the Monday, April 8 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex continues his coverage of the intensifying effort by the feds to stigmatize and label patriot groups and Christians as dangerous extremists. He also takes a look at the latest moves by the gun-grabbers as the ATF builds a massive database to spy on law-abiding Americans practicing their right to own firearms. 

On today's broadcast, Alex talks with renowned author and former Department of State official Steve Pieczenik. 

He also welcomes former Secret Service agent and New York police officer Daniel Bongion, who is running for the Maryland Senate. 

Austin political activist Antonio Buehler appears in-studio today. Antonio was arrested in early 2012 for protesting against police abuse and again later in the year for "cop watching" in Austin, Texas.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
