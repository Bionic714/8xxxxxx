Sourdough is bread for the connoisseur, and is Paul Hollywood's passion.
Today he shares how to cultivate a sourdough starter, harnessing natural
yeasts to leaven your bread.

He starts with a classic sourdough and from this basic recipe, he makes
the ultimate sweet bread, a white chocolate and raspberry sourdough and
a fruit packed summer pudding. But for a real family feast, Paul serves
tuna nicoise salad with tapenade and a stunning, leaf shaped sourdough
fougasse bursting with olives
