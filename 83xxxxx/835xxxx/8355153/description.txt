He involves his wife as the fictional co-respondent for painter Carlo Stasio but the pair are shot dead in the hotel room. In charge of the case is Frank, TonyΓÇÖs ex-partner still on the Brighton force. His most likely suspects are Angeline, StasioΓÇÖs mistress who is set to inherit his house and pictures, and Tony himself, parts of whose story donΓÇÖt seem to add up.
