,jalucian,2013-04-10T20:04Z,"Sure. Three main differences:

1) The old torrent did not include ""The Final Cut"" - it only included ""The First Cut"" and the theatrical version and had ""the lost scene"" as a separate file. This torrent has all three versions in their entirety. 

2) I completely re-encoded the theatrical version for higher quality using x264 settings more specific for sources containing lots of grain (something YIFY did not do with his version.) I also used more grain-specific settings on The Final Cut here.

3) I added an optional director's commentary audio track on The First Cut.

Also, one slight error I made in my notes here. Movie-censorship.com did not label the versions incorrectly. There's actually two different entries over there and I hadn't seen one of them. "

,OLD-SMOKE,2013-05-13T14:15Z,"Thanks Jalucian, thanks for doing what YIFY couldn't do. This torrent kicks ass!"
