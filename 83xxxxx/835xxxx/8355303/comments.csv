Either way, thanks as always!"
,caffinate,2013-04-09T03:56Z,So your goal is to make game of thrones suck.  GTFO.
,Flame_Leg,2013-04-09T05:00Z,"@LifeTheHound 

I tried going for a higher quality mkv this time, and did mess with the encoder settings, however, I couldn't settle for any settings that seemed to improve the quality, without making it too big. I tried searching for an x264 plugin, but it costs 300 dollars, which I'm not interested in paying right now. I'm going to have to stick with the old setup, however, if I find a way to make them higher quality during the season, I'll re encode season 3 before I upload it as one bulk torrent."

i really appreciate your work flame_leg.
i wouldnt even listen to the dirty trolls trying to put you down! your a legend!"
,bonnibel,2013-04-09T10:25Z,"Taking, thank you! Will seed.

Also I and my friends appreciate your efforts with the censoring, this series can manage just fine without the unnecessary nudity/sexual content imho, especially with its popularity due to the books and its setting. 

In response to your question, I'm all for keeping the cussing intact. "
,dreadquake,2013-04-09T14:10Z,"Truly sir, you have created something here which has enriched the world. I can now enjoy this fine, fine show, without being tormented by the horrific sight of breastitude most foul!

I eagerly await your upload of the Kentucky Derby, but with all those unsightly naked horses edited out, and your upload of The Transformers, with all those lewd, unclothed robots edited out!"
,arslanistic,2013-04-09T20:37Z,"if you guys dont like censored shows, dont fucking visit the torrent that offers them.

i wont watch the censored version but i see the uploader's point in creating this.

also i havent seen it myself but in my opinion, the audio should've been left as it is [only bleeping F words] and the video should've been censored the way network tv's do it [by pixelating] "

I could have blurred nudity that was just nudity, not sex, but with sex, even if there's no nudity, it still has the same effect. I did keep the majority of the dialogue, but some scenes are just two people having sex, and the dialogue is not worth the trouble of keeping in. 

Unfortunately, I'm not skilled enough in video editing to blur anything, even in situations where it would be the best option.

-----------------
On another note...

If I find most of the comments want the cussing kept intact, when I re-upload season 3 in a bulk torrent, I'll leave the cussing in."

I neither like nor dislike censored uploads of shows, and I couldn't care less whether the uploader had a point in creating this. I have no personal interest in censored content, but I obviously don't care if someone creates a censored version, or if anyone else feels like downloading it. But you can hardly expect someone to search this site for ""Game Of Thrones"", come across an entry that proclaims ""CENSORED"" in the title, and not ""visit"" the torrent, if only as a pure ""WTF"" moment. Then once I visited, there was pretty much no way I could move on without commenting. I mean, the jokes just fucking write themselves! Whoa, whoa, sorry... I of course meant to say ""the jokes just f***ing write themselves""!"

I've enjoyed this show very much and you make it possible for me to watch this with my wife. She loves it too (as well as friends who don't like the full version). Tbh, I don't mind the swearing however, my wife does like that you make an attempt to edit it out. My personal vote is that during any scene where there are multiple words in whatever combination dished out, do as you did in this episode. If there is just a moment where one word is dropped here and there, no big deal imo. I think the way you have handled sex/nudity is perfect. I have a son who, as he grows up and understands this type of plot, id let him sit down and watch this version much sooner than allowing him to watch the full. 
To all you haters -- the idea/concept of censorship is not so black and white. Flame_Leg has been clear, the full content is fantastic, but there are different people in this world who would love to enjoy this rich story/show at all (or many) ages. It's absurd to think it would be appropriate for a family to sit together of all ages and watch a fully uncensored sex scene. Some people aren't comfortable with that, especially at younger ages. This doesn't denote that there is anything wrong with sex or understanding it - it simply implies that some people don't like ""watching"" sex between other people."

,Flame_Leg,2013-04-14T09:43Z,"Just letting you guys know, the next episode will be late, maybe even after the the one after it. The computer I do all the editing on needs repair, and it won't be fixed until at least Wednesday. Sorry if this inconveniences anyone."
