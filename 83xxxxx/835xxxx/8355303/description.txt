Yes, it's what it sounds like. This is game of thrones censored. My main focus is to remove all of the nudity, and some swearing. Here's links to the other seasons:

DISCLAIMER

Although I edited out all the nudity, and some swearing, there is still lots of swearing left, sexual references, and violence. Keep that in mind if you are thinking of showing this show to your children. This show was not made for children, and even without the nudity it is still a very adult show.

Why would someone want this?

-If they did not watch the series since they didn't want to watch the nudity and sex.
-If they want to watch it with a friend or family member who does not want to watch the nudity and sex.

Why did you do this?

I wanted to watch this show with some friends, but they heard about all the excessive sex and nudity, and didn't want any part of it. I decided to censor it for them, so they could enjoy the show like I have. Since I already did it, I thought I might as well upload it for other people to benefit.

Wouldn't censoring this leave holes in the story?

Yes, that is why I have kept most of the scenes, even the ones with nudity mostly intact. I censor episodes using 3 techniques.

-Removing a part completely, if it didn't add anything to the story.
-Removing the image and replaced it with a freeze frame of the character talking so you can still hear the dialogue without the nudity.
-Removed the part and replaced it with a black screen ans text to explain what was happening.(almost never did this.)

So, you can still get all the action without the "action".

What did you edit out of this episode?

This one didn't have any nudity, just a scene with Tyrian and Shay where she does "stuff" to him. Experimented with removing the cussing in the scene too, let me know if I should continue, or just leave all the cussing in from now on.

Note: If I perhaps missed something you think I should of censored, comment explaining what I missed and I'll re-upload the episode if I it's something I think should be censored.
