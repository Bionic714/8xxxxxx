Notes:
Great show by Robert and co.  really enjoyed it!

I was about 5 rows from the front with the speaker basicaly sitting on top of me so not the best recording ever
but I am sure someone far more capable than me can give this recording a tweak and make it sound a bunch better.

Hope you all enjoy it and I would love to see some more Robert Plant Aussie shows turn up!  Let me know!
