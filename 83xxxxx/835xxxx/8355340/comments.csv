,openstar,2013-04-10T08:13Z,"Great!
however DVD, DB could not be mounted.
Audio does not work"
,chop007,2013-04-10T17:43Z,"Why Mount the dvd's when you can play theme directly from hard drive, just select folder and press play?"
,ampuniaku,2013-04-11T06:09Z,"Nice share, but no sound at all :("
,matt208,2013-04-11T16:05Z,"I followed the instructions.  When I clicked on the patch to run it, it doesn't run but disappears both from the download folder and the program folder.  Thought maybe it did its magic silently.  I go to run PowerDVD and it asks for a activation key.  Help please.  BTW I turned off my anti virus just in case it was deleting the patch, but it still deleted when I tried to run it."
,mickegbg1,2013-04-11T20:48Z,hey anyone have the same problem as every time I insert a disc so I can not play the actual start button is not makerad so you can push play media
,NYPD55,2013-04-11T23:10Z,"Hey Ching_Liu! Thanks for the upload. Everything works just fine but playing *mka files. It plays, but no audio. Could you please look for whats causing this? Thank you."
,Nordicwolf,2013-04-12T12:31Z,"It's so frustrating, i have some issue when i want to open a kmv file despite how big is the file it will show the movie but no sound, i even tried the retail version. with that i had the sound but no video!

I don't know if there is a bug in this app or its something else which cause these issues."
,hackztor,2013-04-13T07:53Z,"I have noticed issues with audio in mkv mostly dts-hd audio. That is when you double click your video file. If you open powerdvd up first, then browse to it audio works. Issue with powerdvd. Version 12 works fine."
,marmalada,2013-04-14T06:28Z,"Plays files on my computer, but cant get my blu-ray discs to play. only reason I need this program. Is there a fix to get disc playback working?"
,PocketAcesDMB,2013-04-17T19:44Z,Anyone else having a problem playing DVD's i can load them into my drive and the drive and PowerDVD recognize them but when I get to the play screen i have the button but clicking it does nothing :(

@PocketAcesDMB
@mickegbg1

I have had the same problem with the program not playing DVDs. If you navigate through the My Computor tab you can open the DVD and play the files. It isn't very slick though."

,sdsucks,2013-04-29T20:36Z,"This one didn't work for me, so I tried a pre-activated version from another tracker and everything seems to work just fine."
,y2kbadbug,2013-04-30T08:06Z,Anyone notice that this version has no serial key for activating PwoerDVD Mobile... only for the remote.
,y2kbadbug,2013-04-30T08:07Z,"Anyone notice that this doesn't have a serial key to activate PowerDVD mobile.  Only for the remote.

,SBonesE8,2013-05-04T15:50Z,"ok so PLEASE ANSWER: does 3d video now have audio in synch,UNLIKE with power dvd 12?
an yes I was not the only person who noticed it.

I don't care that it don't play dvds,ill use vlc or splashplayer in that case,but what I very VERY MUCH want to know is:
can  I spend a day,go buy a kindle or ipad or android ro something an use it as a remote control as was supposed to be an option even back in power dvd 12? the icons are to small to read at night an im in bed an need something handheld to sort thru my many terabytes of videos

ill chack back for answer(an whats cheapest device that will do this on a big handheld screen plese?)"

,guccicar,2013-05-16T15:41Z,"Can anyone get digital surround sound from SPDIF? I been having problems since PowerDVD 12. I'm stuck using legacy technology, PowerDVD 11. Which is the only that plays digital surround sound through SPDIF or even my NVidia video card when I play Remux movies."
,chop007,2013-05-16T17:47Z,"Install DFX audio enhancer, it helped me when my copy of powerdvd 13 was fucntional, that was 1 month ago. But it works awesome in pdvd12 and 11. Just set DFX as default audio device."
,chop007,2013-05-22T22:00Z,"YES IS GOT IT. Finally, what I did was download the Claud.sim file, placed that into powerdvd 13 audio filter and main program path, NOW, Finally got sound when playing back video ts from hard drive. Maybe your crack/patch deletes that claud.sim file. WORKING, AWESOME NOW!!!!!Thanks for you help friend."
,theprophetagp,2013-05-27T09:28Z,"Ching_Liu, the program doesn't want to play any BD or DVD discs inserted into my computer, I keep clicking on play and nothing happens, a loading icon  beside the 'Media Library' tab just continuously moves around. Video files on the HDD work perfectly though. Is anyone able to help? Cheers :)"
,guccicar,2013-05-27T21:58Z,To fix any problems with PowerDVD 12 or 13 including the digital audio. Download the trial version from the source. Use the patch from here and you set to go.
