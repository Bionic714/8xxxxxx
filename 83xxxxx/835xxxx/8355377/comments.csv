,hahawhat,2013-04-11T01:44Z,"Just wanted to thank you for uploading House of Anubis episodes, and other things. Thank you very much, will you upload the rest, or is this the end of Unpopular releases?"
[T],MrUnpopular,2013-04-11T02:34Z,"There's more to come. Our cap of S03E38 got all messed up so you couldn't understand what they were saying, so we're getting a better copy with good audio. It'll just require a tiny bit of waiting. :)"
,hahawhat,2013-04-11T03:48Z,"Alright, thanks for taking the time to upload these episodes, it has to be stressful at times. :) Did the same happen with Episode 39?"
[T],MrUnpopular,2013-04-11T04:55Z,39 was good to my knowledge so both have been uploaded.
