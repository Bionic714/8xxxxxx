Tried downloading another version like a month ago and it would not work"
,AmuLight,2013-04-09T13:07Z,This is the latest version that is currently available at this time.
,Mercer99,2013-04-10T01:25Z,Is this the full game or just a patch?
,pocoksama,2013-04-11T17:08Z,"I have always appcrash some minutes after launch. Error module name: steamclient.dll. I tried more versions of kf, but I have the same error. What can I do with this?"
,AmuLight,2013-04-12T22:15Z,This is the full game
,haseo1998,2013-04-13T01:13Z,"Ok thanks for responding, but like the other torrent (I think I downloaded from you as well) it would crash or be completely unresponsive at a bit more than 30 seconds after start up "
,AmuLight,2013-04-13T04:16Z,"Well, that's not really torrent specific. What are your system specs? If it's integrated graphics make sure you have the latest drivers. Better yet, make sure you have the latest drivers for everything. It's for the best."
,haseo1998,2013-04-13T22:44Z,"I have some type of nVidia, and the latest driver. Will try to mess around with the game like troubleshoot compatibility because it doesn't do that with any of my other games"
,cantkillya,2013-04-20T23:03Z,"pocoksama you must turn off your steam because when u run steam u get that error,because of that error i uinstalled steam and restarted pc and game worked fine"
,cantkillya,2013-04-20T23:04Z,and this is latest version on tunngle u can play multiplayer easly 
,TacticalSheep,2013-04-26T20:20Z,"Same problem as haseo1998 . Game keeps crashing after 30 sec - 1 min. I tried to change the settings, my PC can handle the game, drivers up to date. No idea why it keeps doing this :/ (running windows 7 32bit )"
,Chiwa20,2013-05-06T21:57Z,"Running the Killing Floor from desktop seem to crash. all the time.
There's an alternate solution:

You can run the KillingFloor.exe(Zombie face icon) from: 
Program Files>System>KillingFloor.exe and it WORKS FINE!!! Does not crash.
But, all the DLC weapons are NOT unlocked."
,xXxZombinexXx,2013-05-12T06:03Z,"Very good torrent! It works well, but the Perks don't save, maybe its because I accidentally deleted the stats.bin"
,1337haxour,2013-05-15T04:42Z,"I finally got it working, all you need to do is turn off your internet (disable adapter or w/e) then start the game, then you may turn it back on and tunngle as well, and it works!"
,Chiwa20,2013-05-18T12:30Z,"@1337haxour

Wow, that worked! For singleplayer, Just turn off your wi-fi or internet connection and start playing. All the DLC weapons and Perks work fine. Not sure how to play multiplayer yet."
,xXxZombinexXx,2013-05-22T12:33Z,"Nevermind, perks save. I was on Sandbox and running non-whitelisted mutators xD

Good torrent! I found a patch from v1046 to v1047 here: http://s1.sfcdn.in/YWNjYzY1MDM1Zjk4MDJmZGYzM2QzOTk2YmM0NTQwMmUxYzUzZWZkNDoxVWR6N0k6WGhXUTFlcGpqa2xwUUJNWGtyTkhZeXhoZEs0/5bb4a7c6de/CAK_KF_Patch_1046_To_1047_Fix_NonSteam.7z"
