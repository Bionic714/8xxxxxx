Tanith Lee - Tales from the Flat Earth (DAW Books, 1978-1987)

1. Night's Master (1978)
2. Death's Master (1979)
3. Delusion's Master (1981)
4. Delirium's Mistress (1986)
5. Night's Sorceries (1987)

All are new scans of the original DAW paperbacks. All are clearscan pdf files, except for Death's Master, which is image-based. (Due to the poor quality of the paperback's printing, clearscan was grumpy and ended up doubling the file size, so I decided not to use it.)



These are fantasy classics recently republished in a form that I believe has been revised by the author -- I recommend seeking them out for purchase. Meanwhile give these old versions a try.

For information about the series, google the article by Gene Hargrove, which is too lengthy to quote here.
