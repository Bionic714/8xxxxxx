If you have no experience with DOS emulators, please read our FAQ first ()
NOTE: As with any DOS emulator, this application needs access to the SDCARD and plenty of free memory to run. Your phone should have at least 50+MB to run DosBox properly. Copy your old DOS games onto your SD card and start playing!
