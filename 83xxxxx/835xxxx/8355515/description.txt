"Family Ties"

Hooten and Buck find themselves facing off in
court against attorney Mitch Tompkins after a
grieving son refuses to comply with his
mother's final wishes. Sydney's outrage over
the health of a morbidly obese 16-year-old boy
further strains her relationship with
Lieberman. And a seemingly harmless patient
puts one of Chelsea General's own in grave
danger.
