,m00njaguar,2013-04-17T04:19Z,"I saw the movie ""Oblivion"" last night. Very Hollywood, with some good special effects and visuals. The plot was OK - some parts reminding me of ""The Matrix"" and ""Avatar"". But I really liked the soundtrack and when I watched the credits, I was pleasantly surprised to see that it was by M83, a great group. So now I like forward to hearing the soundtrack by itself. Thanks for the upload!"
