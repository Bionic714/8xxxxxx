I was going through some old image folders and found a bunch of forum signatures. I'm sure other people will have some use for them as well.

All images are 350x19 pixels.

In this pack there are various tech signatures for Linux, Windows, Nvidia, AMD/ATi. There are some for Winamp, GIMP, uTorrent. then there are girl and joke signatures among others. 

Enjoy.
