*Christians demonized as extremists*
On the Monday, April 8 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex continues his coverage of the intensifying effort by the feds to stigmatize and label patriot groups and Christians as dangerous extremists. He also takes a look at the latest moves by the gun-grabbers as the ATF builds a massive database to spy on law-abiding Americans practicing their right to own firearms. On today's worldwide broadcast, Alex talks with renowned author and former Department of State official Steve Pieczenik. He also welcomes former Secret Service agent and New York police officer Daniel Bongino, who is running for the Maryland Senate. Austin political activist Antonio Buehler appears in-studio today. Antonio was arrested in early 2012 for protesting against police abuse and again later in the year for ΓÇ£cop watchingΓÇ¥ in Austin, Texas.
