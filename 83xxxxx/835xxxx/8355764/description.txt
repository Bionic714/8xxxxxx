Nitinol Free Energy Torrent

This is what I could gather on Nitinol.

Collection of videos, clips, pics, screengrabs and pdfs on Nitinol shape memory metal. It has possible Free Energy, Overunity and highly efficient solar power applications.


The main video is about Nitinol memory metal engines that are basically Stirling heat engines and work on a very low temperature difference.
This technology can be easily scaled up into the KWatts range and drive a power generator to generate 50 or 60 HZ AC power. If you use solar power via Fresnell lenses to heat the hot water bath you can convert this heat energy into mechanical motion energy and then use a generator to generate 120 Volts 60 Hz AC or 230 Volts 50 Hz AC power.

Too bad the oil industry killed this invention also as it did also kill the electric cars !
In this report it is said, that 1 KWatts would require 600 US$ investment for the engine and that it is cheaper than PV and Nuclear power and this was in the 1970s. With todays alloy technology this price could be dropped dramatically and this would be a very cost effective technology.
Also Nickel and Titan metals are not rare metals and it would be
cheap to manufature without much maintainance...
but Big Oil killed this technology long ago... What a shame... !
