Notes: Since I'm bored, I've started ripping my DVD-collection of rarities. Hope someone will download... Why is it so hard to find CCE 2.67.0.27 Retail on the web? I had to settle for 2.67.0.23 or make a XP-image in viritualbox to install the 2.70's. Impossible to Google your way to Rebuilder 1.28.2 proper cracked as well. Bah, I shopped it from J.Dobbs when none of the major torrentsites could deliver. Had to cut down on the Ganja to afford it, though.

And no, I AIN'T NO HO-BO. Just fed 'tv-piraterna' on Swedish television when I was a kid.

       In need of a ripper with own supply?  laidback@live.no





EOT.
