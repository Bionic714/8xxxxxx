Bono met his wife in high school, Park says.

So did Jerry Lee Lewis, Eleanor answers.

IΓÇÖm not kidding, he says.

You should be, she says, weΓÇÖre 16.

What about Romeo and Juliet?


Shallow, confused, then dead.

I love you, Park says.

Wherefore art thou, Eleanor answers.

IΓÇÖm not kidding, he says.

You should be.


Set over the course of one school year in 1986, this is the story of two star-

crossed misfitsΓÇösmart enough to know that first love almost never lasts, but brave 

and desperate enough to try. When Eleanor meets Park, youΓÇÖll remember your own 

first loveΓÇöand just how hard it pulled you under.
