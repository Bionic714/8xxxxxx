After all the delays in our Mageia 3 planning,  we're very pleased to be able to announce the beta 4 release.

Packagers and the QA team have worked hard to fix as many bugs as possible. We are now one month from Mageia 3 final release, so your tests - and reports! - are more important than ever.

This beta release comes with nearly all the designs for Mageia 3 integrated - many thanks to Leo who made the background image for Mageia 2 and then worked again on the Mageia 3 design. Our thanks to him for his patience and for his contribution!
