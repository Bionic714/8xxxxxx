,crumrugin,2013-04-09T18:47Z,"The film, directed by Steven Pressman, chronicles the story of the daring mission by the Krauses to travel to Nazi Germany in the spring of 1939, and their ultimate achievement of bringing 50 doomed Jewish children to the United States. They did this despite the nations harshly restrictive immigration laws, rampant antisemitism and strong efforts by major Jewish leaders in Philadelphia to get them to call off their mission."
