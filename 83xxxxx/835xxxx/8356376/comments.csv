Thanks for the upload!"

But I am aware of it now so if it does it again its simply because I derped. I have the blue ray disc too because it came in a box set dvd and blueray however I do not have a blue ray player. Was debating purchasing one, but decided to waste some cash on a SSD instead. the advertised 500mbs read and 500mbs write time just sounded awesome."

I'll fix it when I have the time. But I am not posting on the pirate bay any longer. I've moved to KAT dot PH"

Also all the ones that are listed on this site have been redone with a better program and listed on kick ass so the issues with the video display size and other issues were fixed but again im not going to go through trying to upload them to multiple sites anymore"
