[V],HeroMaster,2013-04-09T14:17Z,ENJOY ENJOY ENJOY ENJOY ENJOY Leaked by Russian Guys and yeah baby its Real :)
,froopdoop,2013-04-09T14:33Z,"thanks for the upload. this a cruel world, so having something like this leaked early is just another event in an eventful world. the download is pretty good its around 300-500kbps average."
,froopdoop,2013-04-09T14:34Z,wow it hit 800kbps for me! thanks heromaster!
,CheeseNBaconShapes,2013-04-09T14:46Z,"Definitely legit, thanks Hero.

Haven't downloaded it yet but this game was definitely leaked today.

Earlier on someone from an imageboard I happened to be on found a simple exploit in uPlay allowing people to download it without authorization.

I would have downloaded it then but I don't have a uplay account and didn't want to install uplay either."
,Ignusdej,2013-04-09T14:49Z,"Title says Multi8, description says english, russian... uploader, are you stupid?"
,smanukin,2013-04-09T14:53Z,"it's Multi5, not multi8"
,virtualmatrix258,2013-04-09T15:06Z,"Awesome. Just upgraded my upload speeds as well, 150mbps upload. I'll keep it going. "
,Corcy,2013-04-09T15:33Z,"Hmm, MSE is alerting me of an Obfuscator.zx virus/trojan in the torrent. 

False positive or an actual virus?"
,lowlife89,2013-04-09T16:20Z,You know that cracked content always shows its a virus/trojan. Dosnt mean it really is just your antivirus is seeing like it is.
,Fib123456,2013-04-09T17:08Z,"Doesnt work for me, UPlay keeps opening up when opening the .exe files asking for a Serial Key, even if started from offline mode."
,randir12,2013-04-09T18:04Z,The game works but I've experienced two crashes in 30 minutes of playing.
,KapooyaKapooya,2013-04-09T18:21Z,Please seed! :))) Hope this works!
,Helgi00,2013-04-09T18:37Z,It doesn't work for me. I copied the crack to the bin folder but when I launch the game Uplay pops up and won't let me play unless I register. I tried to launch if offline but it says I need to be online to register my copy. Help! What am I doing wrong?
,scythe06,2013-04-09T18:42Z,Awesome torrent as always HeroMaster works flawlessly
,Fib123456,2013-04-09T19:04Z,"Randir, how do you open the game without uPlay asking for serial????"
,lisapower,2013-04-09T19:13Z,"Another (Uplay) Hack is needed like in Far Cry 3 (the Original Game).

This hack does not work for me."
,ahoi1,2013-04-09T19:46Z,"Awesome! Not only DRM free, but also 1 month earlier. What a service."
,BluntzNzigzags,2013-04-09T20:21Z,"@fib123456

you have to copy the contents of the crack folder to the BIN folder after installation. than presto, no u play."
,Koca114,2013-04-09T21:49Z,"My game gets stuck at screen which saying ""tracking"" and nothing more. Help?"
,ermrgrd,2013-04-09T22:00Z,Works great! This game is fucking genius.   
,BruceWayneJr,2013-04-09T22:19Z,"Cool game, runs fine. What a pleasant surprise! :)"
,CrownMeKing,2013-04-09T22:22Z,Is this a standalone or expansion?
,ryen2051,2013-04-09T22:27Z,"Doesn't work, keeps asking for uplay, installed and reinstalled multiple times and copied the crack folder over, nothing."
,ryen2051,2013-04-09T22:31Z,"Doesn't work, reinstalled multiple times and copied the crack over and it still keeps launching uplay. Even uninstalled and reinstalled uplay - nothing."
,ermrgrd,2013-04-09T22:31Z,"koka, give it a minute, it only looks like it's frozen."
,BruceWayneJr,2013-04-09T22:35Z,I uninstalled Uplay after installing the game. That might help some of you getting notices.
,ermrgrd,2013-04-09T22:35Z,Make sure microsoft security essentials is turned off. It won't allow you to copy over one of the .dll's which prevents uplay from popping up constantly.
,gold_magistrate,2013-04-09T22:40Z,The crack doesn't work.  Uplay still pops open!
,Fib123456,2013-04-09T22:47Z,"Finally figured out the problem, make sure your antivirus, in my case MSE, its not automatically quarenting the ""ubiorbitapi_r2_loader.dll"" when you copy and paste the contents of the crack directory.

If uPlay is opening whem you open the exe, then that file is not copying properly between the folders."
,Igliu,2013-04-09T22:52Z,So much win .
,tstreamer,2013-04-10T04:16Z,Is it just me or this game reminds the Terminator? The colors and soundtrack. Even the shotgun :x
,heretic_1808,2013-04-10T08:03Z,since the leaked video got taken down before i could watch it all i had to go on were the screens. Honestly I suspected that it was some weird prank by Ubi. I was wrong. This is....this is great. Thank you game developers for this gleaming piece of campy amazingness and thank you Russians for stealing it.
,virtualmatrix258,2013-04-10T08:25Z,"Works great! Been seeding all day. The only bad thing about my experience is that the Fazor or whatever the gun is called, sounds like the assault rifle from Far Cry 3's campaign, and not like a faze plasma rifle like it should. Must be sound design corruption. I'm sure this probably isn't their final version. v1.1 will probably be a day one patch. Thanks Hero!"
,matthew123173,2013-04-10T08:55Z,Works great! I disabled internet on first startup so I don't know if there were issues. Great game! Would actually pay for!
,Sovereignlol,2013-04-10T13:52Z,"I'm fucking raging right now, the game works fine, but in the tutorial, when i am supposed to stealth kill the cyber soldiers, i just automatically die at the chainkill tutorial. I have tried it like 20 times now, but it keeps happening, ffs."
,GObonzo,2013-04-10T14:06Z,this is an awesome adaption for Far Cry 3. nostalgia! i love the cut scenes.
,ahoi1,2013-04-10T14:49Z,@virtualmatrix: read the gun description.
,SteXmaN,2013-04-10T16:19Z,"Tried it ,loved it,will buy it."
,bollenx,2013-04-10T18:32Z,"You dont need to turn of mse, just make sure to add exceptions for download and install folders."
,JohnScott,2013-04-10T21:56Z,Working!
,boxatoys,2013-04-10T22:29Z,Copied the crack over to the bin folder and then ran the main exe but it didnt work and all I got was uplay. So I reinstalled the crack and then ran the d3d11.exe version and that worked fine. Been playing for a while and as yet no crashes.
,tstreamer,2013-04-10T23:57Z,Does anyone have problems saving? I get past multiple checkpoints but i have to start all over again when i re-launch game. :( 
,tstreamer,2013-04-11T04:04Z,"OK, found out that checkpoints don't work but the game lets you save if you press ESC and select SAVE after the first liberated garrison. It seems the game doesn't save your progress while you're doin missions."
,HazyChestNutz,2013-04-11T05:12Z,how do you insert disk 2.....?
,mvnning,2013-04-11T08:55Z,"@Hazychestnutz there is no disc 2, its not an iso or daemon file, just run its setup"
,Assault591,2013-04-11T09:51Z,"Torrent works amazing!!

Download said torrent
Install via setup.exe
open installation directory
Open the Crack folder
Copy entire contents of crack folder into the installation directory
launch the game through fc3_blooddragon_d3d11.exe

,Konner900,2013-04-12T05:11Z,"for all the idiots saying its a virus, almost all cracked files are false positives. now like that @boal1996 fucktard that uses norton, he needs to learn how to use a computer, because Norton is the worst.

,Devilwings,2013-04-12T20:34Z,"@barsason 

Uplay was hacked and people were able to download anything they wanted from it for free including this. So that's why it's available almost a month early. It's just another epic failure of DRM. "

,bonethugnharmony,2013-04-13T02:17Z,"@boal1996, You need to take an intensive computer course asshole. Toss your cheesy anti virus software in your recycle bin and learn to use a fucking computer.

,Pvt_Ryan,2013-04-14T07:30Z,"Hi, I need some immediate help with this torrent. I'v e copied all the crack files into the bin folder, and I've tried running both application files using compatibility mode and running as admin. The problem is that every time I try to open it, the splash comes up for a few seconds, and then either closes instantly, or comes up with ""Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon has stopped working... A couple of other users have encountered this problem and I'd really appreciate any help. And BTW, stop bitching about viruses. Cracked Game=False Positive."
,Pvt_Ryan,2013-04-14T07:36Z,"@THRobinson

,Zebra667,2013-04-14T21:56Z,"Oh and another thing, 'skareo', I checked and noticed that since you seed so many torrents and are such an active part of the community, you totally have NO FUCKING RIGHT to say ANYTHING to HeroMaster! You should be licking his fucking BALLS for just putting the game up, all for YOU, at NO CHARGE! See, I find it odd that you 'pre-ordered' this on STEAM yet, were compelled to come on TPB, LOOK for the game, and then DOWNLOAD a game you had 'pre-ordered' already, tried to play it and THEN bitched! You have NO ground on which to stand! If this torrent is 'fucking garbage' then WHY THE FUCK DID YOU DOWNLOAD IT to begin with?! You're a fucking stupid crybaby that has no room to talk. Games nowadays don't run on that 486 you have, so the only one you have to blame is YOURSELF! Asshole!"

5. Starting the game.

i noticed my virus protection (comodo) was quarantining uplay_r1_loader.dll, so for me...

i restored the file...closed comodo, replaced cracked content back into FC3BD directory, and just ran the game (not as administrator) and it is working fine so far,

This is definitely not my first rodeo. In fact, far from it. I've installed hundreds of cracks, including some that require editting the registry, host files, and the use of hex-editors. I have Far Cry 3 installed, which also uses UPlay, and it plays just fine. So if that makes me a ""moron"", okay. It doesn't change the fact that it's clear from various posts and threads that many of us are still experiencing the same issue with UPlay coming up instead of the game, despite having followed the installation instructions. I was just asking if anyone had any other workarounds. That's all."

I do not have an everyone user account.  I am using daemon tools to do the install so if anyone has any suggestions to overcome this please let me know
,FreeBandz.com,2013-05-19T17:43Z,"I have copied the crack to the crack to the game directory and did everything correctly, however whenever I try to start the game up from the folder the game starts up and then after 2 seconds it gives me a message ""Far-Cry 3 Blood Dragon has stopped Working"" Can someone please help me with this problem? Otherwise its an exceptional torrent!"
