,GObonzo,2013-04-10T03:42Z,"is not a ""remake"" like everyone has been hoping for. just some crap. funny all you have is 2 bad uploads."
,Sleepmore,2013-04-10T21:42Z,"Perhaps it is a language problem, and not a try to fool us.

This is just the ""normal"" PC port/conversion of FFVII. It was a great game in its time, but after playing this for 2 hours I got tired of the boring repetitive battles."
,BluntzNzigzags,2013-04-11T21:53Z,lol this isnt a remake. its the normal game
