,Durendal123,2013-04-13T01:31Z,"A:8 Dubbed english
V:6 Odd lines through objects in movie... you'll see. Very watchable though

M: 0.5/10 Really pretty close to the worst movie I've ever seen despite half decent production value. I literally registered for the first time so that I could comment on how bad this one is. Poor acting. Boring fight scenes. Lousy script. Not complaining, just leaving feedback for anyone else who's unsure about this one."
,fukunt2,2013-04-13T13:26Z,very bad video ...fuck yuo uploader you fucking shitbag cunt..I hope you die ...we want stuff for free thats good quality not this garbage...f uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
,cheach420,2013-04-13T13:50Z,"^^ 
previous comment -.- if u want it FREE stop your bitching about quality, comments about quality ARE helpful, If that's your opinion though,  go PAY for the movie as it was produced... 

Durendal123, thx about the opinion. might check imbd b4 DL"
,kaito09,2013-04-14T19:29Z,"Is it possible from someone to post a blu ray version of this English dub as well? That would be greatly appreciated. 

Also the movie woochi :the demon slayer was released the same day as this in english. A blu ray version of that would be awesome also :D"
