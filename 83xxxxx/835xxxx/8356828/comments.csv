If eztv( the BOSS)  can't upload a good file, you know there is a problem with the file.. "

,dylan_bigdaddy,2013-04-10T16:33Z,"yea guys, sorry. I'm still new to uploading. Um, you still can watch the video file. might fave a small glitch in it, but nothing too major. Keep it in downloading mode and we can still leech of on-other. Sorry everyone. I will get the hang of this I promise "
,Swampnook,2013-04-10T18:57Z,I'm gonna seed the fuck out of it when I'm done downloading.
,swallowswing,2013-04-11T01:45Z,"Excellent thanks. The issues were not enough to spoil enjoyment. Although I could only download 99.9%, it was all there. Just one glitch of a couple seconds in the whole thing. Brilliant."
,NileQT87,2013-04-23T02:45Z,"Finish seeding, please. You left it at 99.9%."
