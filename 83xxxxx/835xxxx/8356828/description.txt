Hey there!

Thanks for downloading and please seed!
No really, my internet is crapping out badly at the moment so my seeding won't do much good. SO I need you. Please seed for as long as you can.

I downloaded this file from EZTV, but the audio was giltching and went all around the place. No shame on eztv, one bad out of thousands. Please don't look to me for regular uploads of tv shows. This is a one off, because I couldn't see anyone else fixing the audio. 

I could only work with what I had. So there are a few moments where the audio was cut and missed. So I tried my best to fill them in with ambient sounds from the scene or with a strings sound pack. I did my best, sorry for the loss dialogue. it seems such a shame, from a show where each word, expression and movement tells a part of the story to be missed and I really hope I hadn't overwritten the directors concepts. If so, sorry.

Any feedback would be appreciated.

Love
Dylan Bigdaddy
