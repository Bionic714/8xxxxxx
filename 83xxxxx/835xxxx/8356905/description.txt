BBC HARDtalk - 04-09-2013 - Sir John Holmes - Former UN Emergency Relief Coordinator

HARDtalk speaks to Sir John Holmes, who was the UN Emergency Relief Coordinator during crisis in Sudan, Sri Lanka and Haiti. Today, emergency response is focused on Syria. Does humanitarian aid work for those who need it most?
