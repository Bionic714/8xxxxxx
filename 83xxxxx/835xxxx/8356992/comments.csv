,malmo2013,2013-04-10T03:18Z,"the only error being made is by you gayfleabag.The Untucked show didn't air during the 1st season of the main show and is therefore always one season behind.Don't believe me? read this!

,gayflea,2013-04-14T04:30Z,I always rename the untuckeds to the right season. too confusing otherwise. itunes is for losers.
,ButtonsTheMonkey,2013-04-16T14:12Z,"While I don't agree that Shoelace is wrong, I do agree that it's kind of dumb to number it a season behind. Because would anybody really just go out and buy season x of untucked on its own? They really should be packaged together on iTunes as well."
