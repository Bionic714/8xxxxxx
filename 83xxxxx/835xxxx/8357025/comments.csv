[V],Gh0stNet,2013-04-09T16:04Z,its more like p2p and not rld 
[V],extremezone,2013-04-09T16:05Z,"from my source it stated this, i've write it on description"
,Chaoz6,2013-04-09T16:08Z,Holy fuck its real :o
,rxanp,2013-04-09T16:12Z,really???
[V],extremezone,2013-04-09T16:16Z,"Gh0stNet i think you're right maybe the original uploaded downloaded this from a ""reloaded-skidrow"" non official sites but on original torrent upload page-from private site it was writed this in description, anyway make sure you block it in your antivirus to play, write/read comments from my source comments it seems it's working, i don't have time to test it right now because i need to go out in the city, maybe later"
,SteXmaN,2013-04-09T16:21Z,wow
,Matinator10,2013-04-09T16:46Z,yeah right extremezone....block in your antivirus to play...thats like switching off your PSU in order to boot your pc. To clarify: block in your firewall.
,Machine4578,2013-04-09T16:53Z,"like Gh0stNet said, this is not RLD's release, its a P2P release with the RLD FC3 crack implemented into this game.. which works flawlessly I might add.."
,kuralla,2013-04-09T17:02Z,Can you upload the crack only?
,BluntzNzigzags,2013-04-09T17:53Z,holy balls this is real? this is the FULL blood dragon game?
,RMJ113,2013-04-09T18:12Z," another low budget crap game with a Known actor on the cover and used for voice, then stick a well known GAME title on it , that never stuck to the main game theme and call it a day and screaming ""SUCK'AHS"" all the way to the bank, while laughing cashing all the idiots checks that payed for it!

I support the idea of piracy, but this is really not cool IMO. UBIsoft may have to take drastic measure again.EA and Blizzard already 'Won' through simcity and diablo iii. A lot of people dislike it and bitch about it sure, but still pirates like me can't played it. By leaking it early even non pirates would probably download it therefore really hurting UBI. You may played it early, but in the long run it's going to hurt the industry a lot more.

FUCK!"
,lordvo1demort12,2013-04-09T18:52Z,guys don't download this .. you might get caught and have to pay a large amount !! just wait till its official !
,lisapower,2013-04-09T18:58Z,"Another (Uplay) Hack is needed like in Far Cry 3 (the Original Game).

This hack does not work for me."
[V],extremezone,2013-04-09T19:18Z,"Matinator10 i was in a rush, you know what i meant to say..."
,lordvo1demort12,2013-04-09T20:39Z,is the game any good anyway ?
,ZexMax,2013-04-09T21:05Z,"@Aoishiro 

Pirate a game early and hurt ubi
or
Pirate a game late and not hurt ubi.

Its a hard choice. But If I can fuck with a company. I will."
,Koca114,2013-04-09T21:50Z,"My game gets stuck at screen which saying ""tracking"" and nothing more. Help?"
,7necromancer,2013-04-10T03:14Z,"Extremezone, what is your original source?"
,92krle,2013-04-10T03:56Z,"Instaled it, works great, nice fast paced shooter for a change :) not bad at all!"
,Matinator10,2013-04-10T11:25Z,Extremezone..yeah I know...but not everyone knows much about computers on here ;)
,nerfu,2013-04-10T12:08Z,"""EA and Blizzard already 'Won' through simcity and diablo iii.""

I know, I am one amongst legion and both games have sold quite well. But losing me as a customer on BOTH games makes for a really strange kind of victory. And I am sure I'm not the only one who decided to take their money elsewhere."
,mmircetic,2013-04-10T17:07Z,The game is waste of time!!!

One of the files in the ""Crack"" folder has a lot of detections on virustotal.com 

ubiorbitapi_r2_loader.dll"
,RobertoNor,2013-04-10T22:46Z,my guess is that it's a monitoring tool / keylogger...

,Bloooddrunk,2013-04-11T01:18Z,Anyone could please tell me the requirements? 
,0101neo0101,2013-04-11T11:06Z,"Works great. No problem to play.
Be patience because the game takes long to load (""tracking"" scene) but in the end, it loads.
Thanks!!"
,saaffran,2013-04-11T11:49Z,when i try to play the game i must log in to uplay and then they ask for cd key?? help
,InMyBedNow,2013-04-12T03:17Z,"@saaffran, make sure you drag the files in Crack folder into the bin folder in your install directory. Overwrite files."
,thcfreak666,2013-04-12T21:23Z,Savegames don´t work Epic Fail waiting for a working crack.
,Stefanovics,2013-04-13T13:18Z,"Great game, bring back some nostalgia. If you old enough to remember the 90's the budget action movies on videocasettes, and the dos games, you can fully enjoy this retro feeling fps game."
,MrEkko,2013-04-13T14:58Z,"Guys, any WORKING trainer for this??? This game have some strange difficulty settings. Even on medium is difficult like hell to kill those dragons with normal weapons, and their damage is ridiculous. Help pls"
,Just_Humen,2013-04-13T18:39Z,"Hello Extremezone, you're one of the best uploaders in my honest opinion. But, after playing Far Cry 3 for a few weeks, I had trouble running it again. It's hard to explain it here. So, is there any chance that I could chat with you via any social networks? You can add me on Skype: Just-Humen1
It'll be easier to talk there. Thank you :)"

Lol, you made the crack ;)"
,shark1669,2013-04-14T09:05Z,There are some people I'd like to thank for providing me with this awesome game. Extremezone and the Russian hackers that hacked uPlay to provide the internet with a fantastic game over half a month before its release. 
,saaffran,2013-04-14T17:08Z,when i try to drag  the file: ubiorbitapi_r2_loader inte the install directory i get an error message saying that i need to have authorisation from everyone to change the file. Im the only user of the computer and i am the administrator on the user account im using when i log in on the computer. any thoughts how to fix this??
,Se7entijz,2013-04-14T18:25Z,"Hi, I would like to play this, I copied the cracked and when I launch it black screen, they if I alt tab an empty error message pops up."

Also just follow the fucking instructions stated, you fucking twats. And it will work."
,MLO89,2013-04-25T00:52Z,People posting must not have played this game long enough to know IT'S NOT SAVING.  Kind of surprised Extremezone would upload this without checking it out.
,MLO89,2013-04-25T03:19Z,"I was wrong, it does save. It's just a LONG time in between saves, like each level."

,SM757,2013-05-01T12:42Z,"I'm getting a ""signal out of range error"" If I remember well enough I had this same problem with just Far Cry 3. I was about to fix it because the game would start up but I couldn't see anything. I can't remember exactly how I fixed it but with this game anyway it doesn't even start up. The logo comes up then my screen turns black and says the error. I tried adding ""/window"" or ""-window"" to the target but that didn't work either. Anybody mind helping me out here?"
,hitman217,2013-05-02T19:47Z,Works great for me! Thanks!
,RAMEN00DLE5,2013-05-03T17:17Z,"Hey fellas I just came back to let you know that not only does this upload work (With SM there is never any doubt anyway. He is like heir to EZ's crown) but the game is awesome. If you are a child of the eighties like me, meaning your in your mid twenties or so you will TOTALLY understand and appreciate the magnitude of awesome injected into this game. Hopefully the younguns that are bitching about shit like ""bad writing"" (How can someone be that dense?) will come to appreciate this game enough to tie up the high horses and just have some fucking fun."
