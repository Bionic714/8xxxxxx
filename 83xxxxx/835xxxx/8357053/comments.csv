,erh111,2013-04-10T13:30Z,"This is the same as the others. The original cam is really low quality. The picture links are of fairly clear scenes however most of the movie is out of focus. The autofocus has trouble focussing when the scene goes dark and we have to wait a few seconds for it to refocus. This happens far too often in the later half of the film - I had to use my imagination to work out what was happening. 
A8 - V6(as low as V2 in places).
Before you all start, I'll save you the bother... 
Why don't I upload a cam if I can do better?
A: I don't have a camera, and movies aren't shown in English where I live.
Keep em coming. "
