,Espana25,2013-04-10T01:29Z,come on @kingashi do some favors to the community by not stopping the seed and let this thing get past 79% for god sake!
,maddog7777,2013-04-10T01:29Z,"@Kingashi- thanks! I don't use PMDG stuff normally because of crashing issues and I did not know what it was actually for. 
@coreshe- SUCK A BIG ONE ASSCLOWN! ""Yeah I am yelling it out at you douche!"
,Brill51,2013-04-10T04:54Z,stuck at 79%... same as many others...

,kingashi,2013-04-10T07:33Z,"@ maddog7777

are u using fsx tweaks?? + enb series.? tell me maybe i can help..."
,maddog7777,2013-04-10T11:39Z,"@Kingashi- I am not using any tweaks. Not sure what you mean by ENB series. I downloaded PMDG NGX B700-800-900 series. It had a update which was labeled PMDG Update 737-800  6700 SP1c update and the 737-900 8900 Sp1c Update. Then it had a PMDG_737NGX.dll file for the crack. After I followed the install instruction, it loaded up the first time with grey gauges and then it crashed and crashed every time since then. I did uninstall it because it obviously giving me issue. I see now the NGX in your title as it was labeled that. Unless there is a better copy of the plane itself might help."
,kingashi,2013-04-10T13:10Z,"@ maddog7777

I have the same setup like yours and i works like charm...try searching avsim threads...and also try to set the textures in low in performance manager....you'll find it in the pmdg ngx folder in FSX directory.."
,aarque,2013-04-10T13:20Z,"What, McPhat - issues? It is a wonder people still take these guys seriously, they are constantly having confrontations with their affiliates.

Is it possibly related to the fact that this is the only group that has come close to turning a profit by selling nothing but repaints? ""Hey, I know it's not a new airplane but the repaint is so good you'll swear it's better than a new one.."" "
,maddog7777,2013-04-11T00:11Z,"@Kingashi- Thanks, I will give that a try and see if it helps. I have so much add ons installed it could be one interfering with the other. I will re-install and try what you said. I reviewed the plane  and it looked great! I like the Ifly version too which is fantastic. "
,mamadkalak,2013-04-11T16:25Z,"thanks so much budy ;) , REQ : Aerosoft Mega Airport Frankfurt V 1.5 for fsx "
,Manhole45,2013-04-13T08:25Z,"I have to agree with you Aarque.  I remember when the guy that started McPhat got started when repainting the original Coolsky Super 80.  He was a douche then, too.  "
,ge88,2013-04-24T16:44Z,"thx dude!
those were relesed as freeware for the pmdg ngx
with an annoying key that only appeared in a youtube clip-so this is a blessed shortcut  
but mcphat also made payware repaints that were relesed before pmdg told them to take it off their site
they are very good-and extremly rare "
,rieper45,2013-05-12T03:06Z,Thank You!!
