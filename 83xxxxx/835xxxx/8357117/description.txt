The Chinese Detective is a British television series, transmitted by the BBC between 1981 and 1982 and created by Ian Kennedy Martin, who had previously devised The Sweeney and Juliet Bravo.

The series starred British-born Chinese actor David Yip as Detective Sergeant John Ho, and offered traditional police procedural storylines whilst refusing to shy away from portraying institutional racism within the police force, and the prejudice displayed by those Ho encounters whilst doing his job. Like many other TV detectives, Ho was something of a maverick, often using unorthodox methods to solve crimes.

Ho's immediate superior in the police force was Det. Insp. Berwick (Derek Martin) and he was also often seen visiting his father Joe (Robert Lee) at his restaurant for advice.
