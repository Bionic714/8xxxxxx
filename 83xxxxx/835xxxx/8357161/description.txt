 MS-DOS 6.22 

===================================================================================
MS-DOS 6.22 is a classic command line OS from Microsoft.

This is the MS-DOS 6.22 bootable install CD with the CD-ROM drivers.

While booting for the first time install MS-DOS 6.22 and

after restart install CD-ROM Drivers.

When the install begins it will show error because your disk has to be formatted 

before running the setup. You will have to create a new DOS partition using "fdisk" 

command and format the drive using "format C:" command.

Thats it the setup will do the rest of thing by itself.

This release is a pure Mastermind release.
