The Sagan Series is an educational project working the hopes of promoting scientific literacy in the general population.

Featuring breath-taking visuals and powerful audio narratives from the late Carl Sagan, the series seeks to question and examine some of the preconceived notions that we as humans often have, while at the same time offering inspiration through the teachings of modern day science.

Perhaps the series is best described as 'soul-stirring'.



All thanks should be given to the creators of each respective series. Reid Gower is the publisher of the 9-part series, and C.J. Sutherland is the creator of the series that is now approaching close to 30 episodes. You can look them up on youtube or social media if you would like.
