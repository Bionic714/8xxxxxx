Notes: Another Dupe of some old release, haven't seen it myself, but decent
       Imdb-score. Ripped for the amusement of yours truly. If I ever need
       the backup, it's just to search TPB and hope the seed is being looked
       after. Ahead, I'll probably Spam the DVDR-section with encodes as long
       as I find something unripped in my shelf. Unless someone convices me
       to go for the news instead, that is. I haven't got the hardware to jump 
       on the cineavia-craze everybody seems to have these days, so I'll guess 
       I just stick to MPEG2 I've loved all the way back since the days of 
       the '~ 1 er' LaserDisc.
