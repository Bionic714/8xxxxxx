,brizzy001,2013-04-09T21:02Z,"Much appreciated :) I see all the hard work you put in getting the sports events up here, we're all grateful. I'm on a 16 hour difference, so usually early morning when your uploads start coming in. If you could get my Leafs game up earlier, you'd be a god to me!! lol"
