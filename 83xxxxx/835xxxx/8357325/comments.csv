V/8.5

I rarely EVER rate anything with a 9 or 10, unless it looks like a dvd or bluray from my player. This upload is very close to dvd quality.
I'm only half-way through watching it, but it seems like a pretty good flick from everything I've seen so far. I would recommend it to others."
,digital.dominion,2013-04-13T21:07Z,"@jigface 

don't know what the fuck you're talking about or what the hell kind of player you're using to watch this with, but it DOES NOT have any Arab subs or my-egy across the top (whatever that even means)."
,KevinCostner,2013-04-14T01:33Z,"I burnt this to a disc and every now & then, there is a random sub title, it may be in Spanish bot Arab though."
