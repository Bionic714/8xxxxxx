Will Montgomery (Nicolas Cage), a master thief who has been sent to prison for 8 years after being double-crossed in a heist gone awry. Upon his release, he's ready to leave his criminal past behind and rebuild his relationship with estranged daughter, Alison Loeb (Sami Gayle). Montgomery's former criminal cohorts and FBI agent Tim Harlend (Danny Huston), are all convinced that the $10 Million dollars was hidden away by Montgomery before he was sentenced. In order to get his hands on it, former partner in crime, Vincent (Josh Lucas), kidnaps Alison and demands the missing loot as ransom; giving Montgomery one day to deliver. Montgomery is left with only one choice: To trust his instincts and join forces again with another old partner in crime, the beautiful, sexy and smart Riley Jeffers (Malin Akerman). Together they must pull off one more heist so he can get his daughter back... before it's too late.
