  First appearing in the summer of 2001, New Jersey's the June Spirit instantly made their mark with the strong Treat Me Like Someone Else EP. Filled with passionate vocals and strong songwriting, the album launched the guys -- vocalist Ian Musgrove, guitarists Alin Ashraf and Garrett Crouse, drummer Jordan Crouse, and bassist Dave Carlson -- onto the touring circuit with bands like the Descendents. After coming back from the road, they stepped back into the studio and recorded Testing Superstition, again for Negative Progression Records. The album was released in the summer of 2002, and the June Spirit broke up the following year. Several members later went on to record an EP under the name Fire Divine.
