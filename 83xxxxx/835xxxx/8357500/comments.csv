[V],dhjudasx,2013-04-10T17:50Z,"at the moment i'm still waiting on the a proper full extended version that is beyond that of even the ext/dc/skynet version... but i'm losing hope.

I'll have to review the skynet edition again. But I was sure it was missing a good 10 minutes of good material."
[V],dhjudasx,2013-04-10T17:55Z,"buenio

Unrated-ext includes an additional 70+ seconds of content plus the unrated part includes blood and splatters and little more overall graphic violence."

take your time finding the extended version.
but put in your best effort encoding it.. much more than you have till now.. i request this as Terminator 2: Judgment Day ranks number 1 in my top 3 movie list.
i have grown up watching T2.
if i ever buy a BluRay player someday.. im gonna Own this movie.
just consider this request coz.. i hold this movie very close to me and i really wana watch the extended edition now.."
[V],dhjudasx,2013-04-10T22:34Z,"T2JD is among my top movies as well..

@dhjudasx:

What is a difference in ultimate edition? i see only ext/dc/skynet versions here in TPB.?"
,eroticburps,2013-04-11T16:25Z,"dhjudasx :-

mate.. if u read the FAQ's on the imdb.. u will come across an article which mentions about two scenes that were shot but never made to video. which are
1) t-1000 getting blown up by enrique's artillery
and
2) atomic dreams.

is there any chance one could find these scenes. i tried a lot but couldn't get my hand on 'em.
is there anyway u could trace them?????"
[V],dhjudasx,2013-04-11T17:17Z,"I have my doubts i'll ever find the bluray with those 2 scenes in them, but I still have to watch the entire skynet version through to make sure it's the right one."
,eroticburps,2013-04-12T12:52Z,okay....
,tobi1,2013-04-23T08:23Z,i need spanish subtitles please! :(
,ilikefish3,2013-06-03T09:19Z,"Watch out guys, I got a letter from my ISP a few days ago for downloading this torrent."
