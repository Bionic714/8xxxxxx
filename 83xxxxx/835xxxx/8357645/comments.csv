,LovingitlikeEZ,2013-04-10T08:25Z,@Karlzbad  you see mate the thing here with EZ they dont release anything early because 9 times out of 10 they wait for a good copy and then upload it so you can safely assume it is of above average quality i promise you will 99.9% of the time be happy with whatever you download from EZ
