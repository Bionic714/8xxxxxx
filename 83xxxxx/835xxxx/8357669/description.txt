Note: When I ran this through Calibre the metadata ordered the books in chronological versus the published order you see listed. Now this doesn't affect anything, its just that HarperCollins (his publisher) in updating the formatting and covers, has listed them (including putting THEIR ordering on the covers) in the setting that they happen, which means The Magician's Nephew is the first book in the series. I'm a Traditionalist but I did put the series ordering as offered by Calibre. All you have to do is open Calibre and adjust and then reconvert to ePub or Mobi, which ever is your preference
