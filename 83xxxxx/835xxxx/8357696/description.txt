Travel Documentary hosted by Dougie Vipond, published by BBC broadcasted as part of BBC The Adventure Show series in 2013 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

This year is the 50th anniversary of the Cairngorm Mountain Rescue Team, and in that time they have attended over 3,000 incidents. In what has been their busiest winter for 30 years, the Adventure Show has had unprecedented access to the team's 42 members who go out, whatever the weather, to help those in danger.

This film follows the team and those they rescue from what, in storm conditions, is one of the most inhospitable landscapes in Britain.
