I compiled PJ Harvey's music videos from 1992 to 2009 (before Let England Shake)

1h24m


Videos:

dress
sheela-na-gig
50 ft queenie
man size
down by the water
c'mon billy
send his love to me
henry lee
that was my veil
is that all there is
ballad of a soldier's wife
a perfect day, elise
the wind
broken homes
good fortune
a place called home
this is love
crawl home
the letter
you come through
shame
who the fuck
when under ether
the piano
black hearted love
