Pop! The First 20 Hits is a greatest hits collection from Erasure, released in 1992 by Mute Records in the UK and Elektra Records in the US. The album utilizes a straightforward format: all of Erasure's singles up to that point, sequenced in chronological order with the addition of the Hamburg Mix of Erasure's first ever single, Who Needs Love (Like That).

In the UK, "Who Needs Love Like That" was released as a single in remixed form ("The Hamburg Mix", a reference to Erasure's extensive touring of Hamburg during the band's formative period). This is included as a bonus track on the UK version of the album, although in the U.S. it only appears on the cassette release, failing to appear on the CD.

Pop! The First 20 Hits became Erasure's fourth consecutive number-one album in the UK. In Germany the album hit number twelve and in the U.S. it peaked at number 112 on the Billboard 200, where it was certified Gold nearly 10 years later by the RIAA.
