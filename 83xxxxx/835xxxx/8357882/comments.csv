However, it would be very useful to know whether this has a WATERMARK like some of Ganool's other rips."
,luvtpb123,2013-04-11T08:01Z,I wish Ganool did rips to XVID/AVI not MKV :/
,Dramat,2013-04-11T18:29Z,"720x304, Great quality and VERY sexy size :)

Thanks for upload BONE !!"
,michaelrwatson,2013-04-13T04:50Z,"@luvtpb123: AVI won't let you get as good quality with such a small filesize (well, you can cram h264 into the avi package but it's horribly nonstandard). Unfortunately, MKV is also nonstandard shitcrapgarbage. Good luck getting this one to play.

What Ganool (and everyone else) really should use is MP4."
,michaelrwatson,2013-04-16T04:04Z,"Well, bad news: This is NOT a BDrip, and Ganool your are an a-hole (None of the other ""BDrip"" releases to date are actually BDrips either). 

This has hardcoded Spanish subtitles periodically, like all the others. Not that that's so bad, but now i have to download another rip because this one sure isn't worth saving. You are all lying faggot bastards."
