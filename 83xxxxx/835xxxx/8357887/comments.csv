,BluntzNzigzags,2013-04-09T20:19Z,this game looks so dope. +1 NosTeam 
,Julez520,2013-04-10T02:45Z,you guys better seed...
,ponknasty,2013-04-10T13:02Z,Game works but crack sadly doesn't. Saves get locked and you can only select the first save from the beginning of the game. Anyone know a workaround?
,jonjonjonj,2013-04-11T04:11Z,update video card drivers and you have to run it as admin or disable UAC.
,jonjonjonj,2013-04-11T04:18Z,not sure why my last comment disappeared. make sure you video card drivers are updated and run the game as admin or disable UAC.
,stackerman,2013-04-12T13:58Z,got and error just when it was about to complete instaling
,thcfreak666,2013-04-12T22:02Z,Another Fake Release. Fuck you asholes Savegames don´t work again !
,bonethugnharmony,2013-04-13T02:23Z,"@nosTEAM...Good Job ^^nosTeam^^, you are a true master. Sorry for any previous negative comments. I guess the newer more in demand games are slower to download and still acquiring seeds. That shit is not your fault. It´s not your fault assholes don´t seed.

I´m sorry for any negative shit I may have said earlier. Your torrents are among the best. You rate up there with the masters. Thank you very much for all your hard work bro. "
,fkr2020,2013-04-17T17:06Z,"no save function for me
the game doesn't save progress !!! "
,Bandila22,2013-04-21T00:27Z,"SAVE FIX
1. go to nosTEAM site
2. find Farcy 3 blood dragon
3. Download patch
4. install patch into game folder
5. You're welcome"
,DexM99,2013-04-23T22:18Z,"Works perfectly. Went to the Nosteam site downloaded the patch, placed the patch in farcry folder and your golden. Except no voice audio. Leaves alot of cutscenes with characters having long awkward stares at each other."
,DexM99,2013-04-23T22:51Z,Will be seeding for the next week atleast. Thanks again!
,MLO89,2013-04-24T18:31Z,So can anyone verify that the saves work now?
,MLO89,2013-04-24T20:37Z,Saves still do not work even with nosTEAM patch.
,jonjonjonj,2013-05-01T23:02Z,game saves and audio work fine.
,VektorX,2013-05-02T05:49Z,"Still getting UPlay login. Uninstalled, reinstalled, applied this crack. Tried `allowing' the directory in my antivirus, same thing.
Does anyone know any other way around this UPlay piece of shit? I play Far Cry 3 and all other games just fine...
thx"
,RAMEN00DLE5,2013-05-03T17:37Z,"The saves aren't broken because of this upload. NosTEAM always goes by scene rules you should know this. You must make saves on your own and the auto save will work once you beat the first chapter or whatever its called. Also, to the angry noob above me you must block the EXE.files with your firewall. The anti virus dont matter a shit or a giggle. You must block Ubi's ability to find your game with your firewall.   I SAY AGAIN TO EVERY NOOB. BLOCK YOUR EXE FILES WITH YOUR FIREWALLS THAT MEANS INGOING AND OUTGOING FOR MICROSOFT FILEWALL USERS"
,Girby93,2013-05-04T03:02Z,"i cant seem to get the game to work at all, its aying that skidrow.dll isnt there, this is the first issue ivre had with any of nosteams torrents, does anyone have a solution i really want to play this game"
,Girby93,2013-05-04T03:11Z,update: i got it to work after i reinstalled thanks for the awesome upload noSTEAM
,Girby93,2013-05-04T23:06Z,i tried what you said RAMENNOODLES to actually play the game but i still cant seem to get my save files to work

,VektorX,2013-05-14T18:19Z,"For those with UPlay problems:
Okay, so for whatever reason, I decided to try and install this on my laptop using this link:
http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8356634/Far_Cry_3_Blood_Dragon_2013_MULTi8_CRACKED-P2P_
Worked fine. But I've had a few games work on my laptop that wouldn't work on my desktop.
On a whim, uninstalled the game, uninstalled UPlay (separately), and reinstalled using the game and crak found at the link above.
It now works fine on my desktop. No UPlay nonsense. Just works. (Far Cry 3 still works fine as well.)"
,XxfluffyxX,2013-05-19T01:09Z,"Hi, when i try to run the game it says im missing a .dll file, what should i do? Im a noob so dont hate."

,FreeBandz.com,2013-05-19T17:48Z,For some reason all but 1 of my nosTEAM games have the problem with the saves not being able to load and Ive been staying away from them ever since because I was afraid that this one would have the same annoying problem. Please tell me this isnt the case as well?
