,Bubbers83,2013-04-10T00:15Z,"Any chance of a upload of all issues of Witchblade from 115 and up? Plus any specials, miniseries, and crossovers?"

,nazgull2k10,2013-04-16T02:26Z,"Good lord what was that... 10 pages?!  

Thank god Im not paying money for these, I'd be pissed as all hell."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-16T15:17Z,"nazgull2k10, this series is a digital first weekly title, along with ARROW, BATMAN BEYOND, LEGENDS OF THE DARK KNIGHT, SMALLVILLE SEASON 11, TRANSFORMERS: MONSTROSITY, etc., and is always 20 ""tablet pages"" (which are equivalent to 10 standard comic pages cut in half).

and i don't think you'd be hurting if you did buy it... it's only $0.99 a week, so for $3.96 a month a reader gets 40 pages with no ads."
