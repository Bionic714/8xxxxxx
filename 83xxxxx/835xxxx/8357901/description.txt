Two notes. The aspect ratio is weird (tiny black bars on the left & right of picture). That is how it came on the special DVD I acquired years ago. I tried to stretch it out, but then it looks obvious. So I chose to leave that alone.
Next is the duration of the film being shorter than the R rated version. Here's what I can tell you. Everything is in this unrated version. I played it side by side with the R rated to figure out why it has a shorter runtime and discovered that the unrated version plays a little faster than the R rated does.
