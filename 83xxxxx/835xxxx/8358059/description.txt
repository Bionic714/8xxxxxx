I'm dying for my current and future 204 billion children to have a future other than Earh-Hell fromm fossil fuel Ecocide.  Oh, I'm not being figurative - I'll be dead by month's end, or restrained and forcefed for the rest of my life.  Google "start loving" (piratebay won't allow blogger urls here.  argh).

If it cost me a million years of forcefeeding as a price to have the world know one author, the last 32 years of Leo Tolstoy, he would be my pick, I'd take the deal Joyfully, and ecocide would be averted.  HE MADE GANDHI, AND THEREBY MLK JR.  GET IT?
