Every project in the book can really move! Origami in Action presents 39 actions origami models that are as animated as they are exquisite. Each project is complete with clear step-by-step diagrams, instructions, and a photograph of the finished model. Included are such traditional favorites as the cootie catcher and the waterbomb, as well as some modern novelties--a strumming guitar player and a toothy Tyrannosaurus Rex. Other projects include: --Flapping Butterfly-Blow-up Bunny-Barking Wolf-Talking Dragon-Wagging-Tail Doggie-Boardsailor-Swimming Manatee-Indian Paddling a Canoe
