,emokid117,2013-04-10T03:03Z,YAY!! been waiting for this!! will seed after download...and uhh is there any chance that you'll upload the Mac App version? 
,marhowl,2013-04-10T22:05Z,"This better be downloaded in 9 hours time when I wake up!

I'm going to seed at least 100-150GB of this, then I'm out"
,FastForwarder,2013-04-11T17:43Z,"Is this Mac native or a port?
Thanks."
,TalibanNinjaX,2013-04-11T17:49Z,"If i download just the update, can i use it in my 1.2.2 version of the game? "
,gatosardina,2013-04-11T19:02Z,"@talibaNinjaX
yes
i had a similar issue when i downloaded the version 1.2.0 and had the 1.1.0
i deleted the previous version and kept the newest one
I dont think you loose the characters when doing that (unless you use app cleaner)
anyways to make it sure, i copied the data of my savegames from ~Library/Application Support/Borderlands 2/WillowGame
that whole folder contains all the savegame data
you can use it to transfer characters between computers or systems"
,emokid117,2013-04-12T04:01Z,done downloading after 2 days..will seed :D
,marhowl,2013-04-12T10:33Z,"I cant launch the game. I got this message after pressing ""Launch Game"" in the menu

""an unrecoverable error has occured and borderlands 2 cannot continue""

Does anyone know what to do? Running 10.8.3"
,marhowl,2013-04-12T15:06Z,"Alright, so I have figured it out

For those of you who use the gfxCardStatus on 2009 macbook pros , when you switch from your integrated to discrete graphic card or the other way round, the game will not work for some reason. So, you have to do it manualy through the log-out method. 

The game works perfectly and quite smooth on my 17"" 2009 MBP 2.93GHZ running on 10.8.3"
,Dee34,2013-04-13T01:04Z,"I can't find the exe in the torrent

,i_love_thepiratebay,2013-04-19T03:59Z,"Damn, it wasn't until this was already ALL THE WAY downloaded that I realized that this was for Mac. Does anyone know a .dmg opener for Windows?"
,mickyt20,2013-05-01T13:01Z,is this only single player or can it be played lan with 2 versions of the crack?
,exikoz,2013-05-01T18:14Z,This is a DMG file only for Mac. But you can convert it to iso so you can use it on Windows as well. 
,xasper,2013-05-08T13:39Z,"I manage to extract all the contents from the dmg file but how can i make it works on windows because it has trash folder , events , should i copy the contents to the installation directory or wat"
