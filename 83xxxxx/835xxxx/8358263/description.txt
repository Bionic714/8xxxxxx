Victor Feldman - 1958 - The Arrival of Victor Feldman (1998)

A very good set of unpretentious, relaxed modern jazz. John A. Tynan, Down Beat (from the back cover)

Victor Feldman had first recorded as a leader when he was 13 and a swing-based drummer. In 1957, he moved from his native London to the United States, and by early 1958 (when he was 23) was in great demand as a pianist and vibraphonist. For his second American release and debut for the Contemporary label, Feldman is completely in the spotlight. Joined by the brilliant bassist Scott La Faro (whose playing is a strong reason to acquire the album) and drummer Stan Levey, Feldman performs a mostly boppish set including "Serpent's Tooth," "There Is No Greater Love," Dizzy Gillespie's "Bebop," a Chopin waltz and three of his diverse originals. An excellent showcase for the still-developing Victor Feldman. (AllMusic)
