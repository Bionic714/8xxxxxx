For one day in rural central Wisconsin, the dead came back to life. Now it's up to Officer Dana Cypress to deal with the media scrutiny, religious zealots, and government quarantine that has come with them. In a town where the living have to learn to deal with those who are supposed to be dead, Officer Cypress must solve a brutal murder, and everyone, alive or undead, is a suspect. A beautiful 'farm noir' that puts a new twist on the zombie genre, created by NY Times Bestselling author Tim Seeley and Eisner nominated artist Mike Norton.
