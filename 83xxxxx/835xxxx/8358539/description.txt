Are People On Your Network Right Now?If youΓÇÖve stumbled across this site, chances are that youΓÇÖre concerned about how secure your wireless network really is. You might even be concerned that someone you donΓÇÖt know is connected to your network this very minute.

The problem is you canΓÇÖt see a wireless network. You canΓÇÖt touch it. And you canΓÇÖt know who is connected to it without some help.

But there is a way to be 100% certain that no one is on your Wireless Network but the computers and devices that you want to be on itΓÇª

ItΓÇÖs like they say ΓÇ£Trust but VerifyΓÇ¥.

At this point, I hope you see the true value in verifying who has been connecting to your network.

I know when I first ran the software on my own machine, I kept expecting that someone I didnΓÇÖt know would connect any minute.

I have to admit that I was pleasantly surprised.

I run WPA2 on my wireless network, and in the 6 months that IΓÇÖve been running this software, IΓÇÖve only seen 1 person connect to my network that I wasnΓÇÖt aware of. And that was my wife who plugged her new computer directly into the Wireless Router without telling me about it.

For about the same price as a DVD or BluRay disc, you can have the piece of mind that your network is safe.
