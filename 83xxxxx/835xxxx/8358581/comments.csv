,markofbear,2013-04-10T00:25Z,Is the translation 100%?
,8BitHero,2013-04-10T00:54Z,Unfortunately it is not however the translation is about 75% completed as of now and the torrent comes with the translations installed. I have played this game for several days and I can say that most of the untranslated text won't ruin the game for you :)
,Shintien,2013-04-10T02:27Z,So are the story completely translated?
,GuttedGnome,2013-04-10T10:16Z,"I don't think the story is entirely translated even though it's not that heavy on story. However, if you still want to translate the remaining text I recommend Chiitrans2.
http://code.google.com/p/chiitrans2/
1. Install Princess Maker 5 and put Chiitrans2 anywhere you seem fit (like the desktop).
2. Open Chiitrans2 and click ""Click here to start"".
3. Click ""Browse"" and go to where you installed the game and click pm5.exe.
-Keep AGTH key blank and make sure it says ""Run through AGTH"" at the bottom. If not, change it.
4. Check ""Fix game locale"". and press OK.
5. play like normal.

Even though it translate some weird things at times (usually in the main menu and load/save menu) it works quite well. However, it uses online translators such as Google Translate. If you want to change and add active translators  click the third button from the left at the top of Chiitrans2. :)"
