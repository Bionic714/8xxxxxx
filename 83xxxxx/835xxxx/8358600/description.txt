*Obama pushes for background checks*
On the Tuesday, April 9 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex tears apart the steadfast push to tamp down so-called ΓÇ£gun violenceΓÇ¥ as Obama once again parades the dead children of the Newtown tragedy for maximum emotional manipulation of the masses. Alex also breaks down the DHS audaciously testing surveillance drone technology that can detect whether or not a person is armed. On today's show Alex welcomes American musician Dan Spitz and his wife Candi Spitz to speak about their fight against autism and their ongoing crusade to alert as many people as possible to the dangers of vaccines.
