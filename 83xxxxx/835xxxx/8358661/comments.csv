,egozi44,2013-04-10T13:28Z,"Is this crack works fine the Entire game?

I heared that all the cracks so far either have saves problems or crashs as some points

is this crack have these issues?

did you beat the game with this crack without issues?"
,Twinmin,2013-04-10T17:47Z,"This one works for me. Win 7 x64. Just follow instructions.
For those already using FLT release:
Copy folder SaveData from C:UsersYOUR_USER_NAMEAppDataLocalFLTSteam8870remote   to:  C:UsersYOUR_USER_NAMEAppDataLocalSKIDROW8870Storage
You might need to go back to Blue ribbon to pick up some items from DLC's. Don't know if it's possible, I'm about to try. "
,Magotchi,2013-04-10T20:15Z,"I haven't beat the entire game, but I've gotten deep into Finkton (about 18 Infusions into the game), and I haven't had any issues with saving or crashing."
,egozi44,2013-04-11T03:54Z,"I see

,langheden,2013-04-11T11:02Z,Works perfect...
,Remiv,2013-04-13T02:29Z,"Forces my game to crashes on start up. I click play, and it said BioshockInfinite.exe stopped responding. I have it on Steam. I have all the DLCs legitly besides Comstocks Rifle. Any way to fix, or just let me activate the Rifle dlc?"
,Jintek55,2013-04-13T20:45Z,@Remiv:  Try not copying over the and replacing the BioshockInfinite.exe...?
,Magotchi,2013-04-14T01:13Z,"I have now beat the game with this package, with not one crash or save issue the entire time."
,Remiv,2013-04-14T07:06Z,"Okay new problem, decided to start a new. deleted all my pirated stuff, and installed/reinstalled the game. redownloaded this...and the rifle DLC files are missing....."
,Magotchi,2013-04-14T11:06Z,"There are no folders for UpgradePack or BirdsEye in this package.  They're simply added to the ini file for ChinaBroom, as described at http://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?p=821038#p821038 ."
,egozi44,2013-04-14T19:54Z,"Nice to hear that you was able to beat the game 
I will give it a go too soon : D"
,Magotchi,2013-04-15T10:52Z,"The DLCs still work on 1.1.21.26939 if you apply the RELOADED update (http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8366401) and use their BioShockInfinite.exe, but leave the other files from this package (Steamclient.dll, steam_api.dll, steam_appid.txt, and Unleashed.ini).

I haven't played much to test the saving or crashing though, but it's probably fine."
,Magotchi,2013-04-15T12:25Z,"Since the last comment, I played through about 5 checkpoints, and I didn't have any issues with saving or crashing."
,RoaringFire,2013-04-15T17:52Z,"I'm really new to pirating, where do I put the files?"
,Magotchi,2013-04-15T21:02Z,"You put them in the directory in which you installed the game.  For example, it may be ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Bioshock Infinite"" (PirateBay deletes backslashes)."
,Magotchi,2013-04-15T21:03Z,I guess you can make backslashes by typing two of them in a row.  :-)
,Magotchi,2013-04-15T21:07Z,"Hmm.  My other comments aren't showing for me.

Put all the files in your game's installation directory, which may be something like ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Bioshock Infinite""."
,Magotchi,2013-04-16T02:02Z,"I updated this package to 1.1.21.26939 (merged the RELOADED package with the Steam crack files from this package):
