I made this package because I had difficulty getting the BioShock Infinite Full DLC Pack-P2P package (http://thepiratebay.gl/torrent/8323601/BioShock_Infinite_Full_DLC_Pack-P2P) to work, and I thought I'd provide something that's easier to find and use.

As he says, it's the FLT BioShockInfinite.exe and the Steam crack from the Unleashed rip of Zen Bound 2 (with the app ID changed).

The DLC folder is set up like machine4578 says in the same forums:
