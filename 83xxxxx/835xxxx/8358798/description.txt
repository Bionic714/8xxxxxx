From Wikipedia:

X-Factor is a series featuring a team of superheroes, published by Marvel Comics. It is a spin-off from the popular X-Men franchise. The series has been relaunched several times with different team rosters, most recently in X-Factor volume 3 as X-Factor Investigations.

X-Factor launched in 1986, featuring a team composed of the five original X-Men. In 1991, the founding members were incorporated back into the regular X-Men series, and X-Factor relaunched as a U.S. government-sponsored team incorporating many secondary characters from the X-Men mythos. The series was canceled in 1998.

In 2002, a four-part X-Factor mini-series detailed an investigation by the Mutant Civil Rights Task Force into an alleged conspiracy by hate-groups to commit murder against mutants.

In 2005, a new X-Factor series was launched, following the mutant detective agency X-Factor Investigations. Written by Peter David, the series drew acclaim from Ain't It Cool News, as well as controversy for establishing a romantic relationship between Rictor and Shatterstar, a move criticized by Shatterstar's co-creator, Rob Liefeld. The series also won a 2011 GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Comic Book.
