The All-in-One Resource for Infrastructure Jobs, Green Careers, Reliable Blue-Collar Work, and More!
Not everyone is suited to a white-collar career or wants to get the four-year degree that these jobs typically require. But that doesn't mean you have to turn your back on a great salary, exciting work, and a profession that commands respect.
Joe Lamacchia is proof. After graduating high school, he said no to collegeΓÇöand found personal and professional success as the owner of a thriving landscaping company. He also started BlueCollarandProudofIt.com, a resource for people who want to find work in the skilled trades. Blue-collar workers build and maintain our bridges, keep our cars running, fix our plumbing, and provide vital services to every home. That's why Lamacchia calls these 'necessary jobs.' Most blue-collar work simply cannot be outsourced to foreign countries and it's often recession-proof. As Baby Boomers retire, blue-collar industries
are experiencing workforce shortages because there aren't enough well-trained
people to fill all of these jobs. That is, until now . . .
