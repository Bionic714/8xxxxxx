,Kuyuuji,2013-04-11T03:06Z,"Hey adrianyujs, thanks for the consistent uploads of Running Man :D. Anyway, may I know what's the difference of this Sub and KSHOWNOW sub? Are there any ""Lost"" subtitle content? Thanks!"
,adrianyujs,2013-04-11T10:08Z,"@Kuyuuji: There is no lost in subtitle, only different is subs team, hard sub and soft sub.
KSHOWNOW version is Hard Sub which doesn't require load subtitle file while this version is Soft sub which require additional file to load subtitle like *.srt / *.sub / *.idx file and so on."
,adrianyujs,2013-04-11T10:09Z,"@Kuyuuji: U can try delete the subtitle included in this torrent and u try play the video, and surprise there is no subtitle, just RAW format ^_^"
,Kuyuuji,2013-04-11T23:49Z,"Haha yeah I figured that out after I downloaded both version for other episodes, I do prefer this Version as there will be no Watermark unlike KSHOWNOW. All I do is Hardsub it using converter :), thanks alot!"
