I would like to know if there is a calendar for Phase 4? "
,chronicelite,2013-04-20T17:45Z,"@ 783788 - Yes, I will get around to it shortly. "
,wolfenstein4,2013-04-20T19:35Z,"hmm will you be uploading everything for hypertrophy max ?

just asking :)
as this phase also is missing the issue booklet pdf "
,783788,2013-04-20T19:39Z,Thank you!!
,chronicelite,2013-04-20T23:32Z,"@ wolfenstein4 - the booklet pages necessary to do the workouts will be included in future torrents. the other pages are just advertisements for supplements and not worth scanning. also HMAX no longer offers a digital PDF for the newsletter, so it has to be scanned. this phase will have the scanned pages uploaded shortly"
,783788,2013-05-08T20:59Z,What happens with the calendar?
,castrogfx,2013-05-19T23:35Z,"Awesome!
