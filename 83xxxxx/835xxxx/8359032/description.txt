Color Splash convert photos to gray and let you choose details in color!

Color Splash Effect Pro
Color Splash Effect lets you quickly and easily give photos a dramatic look by converting them to black and white, while keeping your chosen details in color. This effect draws the viewers' attention to the colored areas, creating striking images.

Most selective coloring apps give you 2 painting choices: Gray or original color. Color Splash Effect gives you this PLUS the ability to paint nearly ANY color!

The intuitive and responsive multi-touch user interface makes Color Splash Effect amazingly easy and fun to use. Use your finger as a brush to "paint" sections of your image black and white, or to bring back the original color. Zooming in and out using the two-finger pinching gesture allows you to work on details with pixel-accuracy.
