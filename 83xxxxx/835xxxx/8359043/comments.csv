His copies of The Hunt for Red October and The Usual Suspects were released within one day of yours. His settings are awful compared to yours though. It's too bad more people don't know more about x264 settings or you'd have far more seeds. Your encodes are actually even better than YIFY's, though much, much better than anoXmous'. Keep up the great work!"
