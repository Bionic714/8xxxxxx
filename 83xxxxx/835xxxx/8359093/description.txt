For many of us, plants herald the change of seasons, represent the promise of nourishment, or serve as stunning visual reminders of Earth's natural beauty. As vital components of nearly every ecosystem on the planet, plants play a fundamental ecological role in the lives of most organisms for their utility in food and clothing production, fuel, shelter, and a host of other activities.
