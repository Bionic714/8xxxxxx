2000 - Blue Note / 7243 5 22672 2 4 / Connoisseur Reissue Bonus Tracks / CD

This is part of Blue Note's Limited Edition Connoisseur series.

Although Andrew Hill is widely known as the leader of such complex classic Blue Note albums as POINT OF DEPARTURE and SMOKESTACK, it is mostly forgotten that he composed Lee Morgan's follow-up to the "The Sidewinder," the trumpeter's equally groovy "The Rumproller." Here with GRASS ROOTS, which brings together two of Hill's sessions from 1968, the pianist steps back from his raging explorations to settle into a series of the soothing grooves that dominated the popular jazz scene of the late '60s. While this is not the most popular of Hill's excursions, it does reveal a side of the creative pianist rarely heard. What is also intriguing is the inclusion of alternate versions of the tracks "Venture Inward," "Soul Special," and "Bayou Red" from the bonus session, which were actually recorded earlier in the year than the master tracks. This makes for some interesting contrasts in interpretation from one session to the next. Finally, only the closing ballad "Love Nocturne" hints at Hill's more enigmatic side for which he is so widely acclaimed.
