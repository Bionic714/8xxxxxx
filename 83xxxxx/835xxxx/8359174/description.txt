Screenshot ER is a screen capture app for rooted devices, proven to work where nothing else does. Easy to use and with lots of settings for capture maniacs too!


This app is a pure screen capture utility and nothing more. You get all the possible capture methods:

Γÿà Long press on search button
Γÿà Shortcut
Γÿà Delay
Γÿà Device shake
Γÿà Visible or invisible notification icons

The root daemon is complemented by a powerful suite of options designed to increase ease of use and compatibility across a wide range of devices:

Γÿà Edit screenshot images
Γÿà Interactive thumbnail preview
Γÿà Rotate and flip images
Γÿà Manage service with widget
Γÿà Customize file names
Γÿà Dynamic image override
Γÿà Disable service when screen is off

And of course, all the usual options are there - image type, countdown timers, share menu integration, and an editable storage folder.
