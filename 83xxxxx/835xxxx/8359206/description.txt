"Why Don't We Get Drunk?"

Lavon's big plans of making BlueBell a Spring 
Break destination hits a roadblock when the 
competing town tries to lure the partiers 
away. With the help of Ruby Jeffries (guest 
star Golden Brooks), Lavon creates a 
competition that is bound to attract some 
attention. Eager to join in some 
much-deserved fun, Zoe agrees to give 
partying a try with Jonah (guest star Travis 
Van Winkle), but seeing them together makes 
George jealous. Wade and Lemon decide to 
compete in Lavon's contest in order to win 
the grand prize to buy the Rammer Jammer, 
which they have learned is for sale. 
Meanwhile, Brick has been acting odd and when 
everyone begins to notice they force him to 
seek treatment.
