Hayley Sings is the debut album from American Dad! star Rachael 
MacFarlane. MacFarlane voices the beloved animated character of Hayley 
Smith on the Emmy nominated television show, American Dad!, currently in its 
seventh season. The 14-track playlist is inspired by music from the 60s and 
70s. "When I was growing up, my dad introduced me to groups like Simon and 
Garfunkel and The Beatles and Crosby, Stills and Nash. So we decided to run 
with the idea of re-imagining music from my childhood, which would be 
appropriate for Hayley to sing. Two of the album s fourteen songs will be 
included on that season-opening episode of American Dad!. First is Someone 
to Watch Over Me, which introduces Hayley s vocal skills. It s a song I ve 
been singing since high school, says MacFarlane, We wanted to strip it down 
and create a quiet, introspective version with the small group. Second is 
Makin Whoopee, the album opener. The show s producers, says MacFarlane, 
were going for a Fabulous Baker Boys feel, which was perfect for the 
storyline. Out of This World, is also on the album. The classic Harold 
Arlen/Johnny Mercer song is a tongue-in-cheek nod to the fact that Hayley is 
becoming romantically involved with an alien, and would be a great addition 
to a future episode s soundtrack. A few additional standards found their way 
onto the album. I m Glad There Is You is, says MacFarlane, my father s 
favorite. It is really stripped down just me with George Doering on guitar and 
it s a love letter to all the musicians, and everyone else, who made [the 
album] possible. The remaining tracks are all drawn from the 1960s and 70s. 
Paul Simon s Feelin Groovy , Tedd Firth of the Chiffons 1963 hit, One Fine 
Day, written by Gerry Goffin and Carole King. A second Goffin-King 
composition, Up On the Roof, also made the cut. To close the album, 
MacFarlane chose Lennon and McCartney s All My Loving, arranged and 
conducted by Matt Catingub with just Doering s guitar and a bank of strings.
