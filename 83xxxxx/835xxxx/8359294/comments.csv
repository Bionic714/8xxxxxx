,zakimar5,2013-04-10T15:58Z,God Bless Jimmy Carter. He's the ONLY decent President in over 100 years. And of course the greatest former President.

,arte123,2013-04-10T19:37Z,"EZTV is also still missing the last episode of ""Real Time with Bill Maher"" ..."
,gunbravo,2013-04-11T15:42Z,I love Jimmy Carter. He is one of the kindest men I have seen so far in my lifetime. A true christian that loves everyone and still active in helping others. May you live a long and happy life Mr. President.
