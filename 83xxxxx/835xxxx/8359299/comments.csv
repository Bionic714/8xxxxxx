,pythonista99,2013-04-10T11:49Z,Hmm - torrent seems to show zero size.  Can the uploader please check it.
,13ghosts,2013-04-10T12:45Z,"I'm new to uploading torrents, but as far as I can tell the files are in the right place and seeding correctly; I've downloaded them onto other computers myself using uTorrent and Vuze. If other people are having problems, leave a comment and I can check further."
,Farson79,2013-04-11T03:11Z,Thanks for the up!  Been waiting for AMOL for a loooong time.
,f000bar,2013-04-11T04:11Z,Awesome! Now I just need to find an epub version...
,Lilyprincess,2013-04-13T11:08Z,"f000bar: If I remember correctly, Calibre (Mentioned in the description of this torrent) can convert ebook files, and it should be capable of converting mobi files into epub files. You should give that a try."
