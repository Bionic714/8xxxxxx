Almost did not want to UL this shit due to the ugly bitch in Bourne 1, but turns out low res + deblock has the benefits of smoothing out her face. Seriously goddamit Bourne is a good series but it almost got ruined by an ugly actress. Ugh.

(Wikipedia) The Bourne films are a series of action/thriller spy films based on the character Jason Bourne, a CIA assassin suffering from extreme memory loss,[1] created by author Robert Ludlum.
All three of Ludlum's novels were adapted for the screen, featuring Matt Damon as the titular character in each. Doug Liman directed The Bourne Identity (2002), Paul Greengrass directed The Bourne Supremacy (2004) and The Bourne Ultimatum (2007). Tony Gilroy co-wrote each film and directed The Bourne Legacy (2012).
Matt Damon chose not to return for the fourth film. The character Jason Bourne does not appear in The Bourne Legacy, but mention of his name and pictures of Damon as Bourne are shown throughout the film.
The series is noted for its realism, in contrast to the growing use of computer-generated imagery in the action genre.
