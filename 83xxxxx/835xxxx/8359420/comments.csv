,eheske,2013-04-11T17:09Z,"H TxJag, Thanks for the Torrents you have been uploading. I am an ardent follower of yours. I have downloaded all the uploads done by you. I really appreciate your hard work and pain you are undertaking to provide all of us with excellent books. 

If it is not too much of a difficulty to you, could you upload books of Mary Higgins Clark?. I have already have a collection of books by her which is downloaded from Internet, but they are not retail quality.

I also request you to let me know where I can get books of Peter Chyney especially his Slim Callaghan Series. None are available on Internet.

Thanks and regards. Keep up the good work!!!"
