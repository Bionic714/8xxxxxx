The Best of The Andrea Tantaros Show - Rand Paul captures the moment of a movement,
 A movement underway to regain lost freedoms from growing government control.

ΓÇ£I will speak until I can no longer speak, I will speak as long as it takes,
 until the alarm is sounded from coast to coast that our constitution is important,
 that your right to trial by jury is precious,
 that no American should be killed on American soil without first being charged with a crime,
 without first being found to be guilty by a court,ΓÇ¥ said Senator Rand Paul on the floor of the Senate.
