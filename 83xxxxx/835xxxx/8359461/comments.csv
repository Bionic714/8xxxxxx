,thescotsman1960,2013-04-17T17:15Z,Did ep 7 air last night or was it pre empted?
,rowsol,2013-04-17T17:51Z,From what I've read it did air.  I hope someone uploads it so I don't have to wait 8 days.
,q2323,2013-04-17T18:11Z,did the uploaders overslept or something?
,acsmith1972,2013-04-17T19:13Z,Apparently what happened is they aired it on the West Coast and it was all Boston coverage on the East Coast. Apparently everyone who uploads it lives on the East Coast. 
,thescotsman1960,2013-04-17T21:29Z,I think Fox will have it repeated next week then ep 08 to follow the next hour....for the East Coast. I hope.
,rb368,2013-04-18T01:00Z,Thanks for the info to the posters above.  Was wondering why this episode wasn't available.  Will wait patiently...
