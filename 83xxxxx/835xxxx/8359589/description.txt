You know youΓÇÖre doing something right when you get picked to tour with Neil Young & Crazy Horse.

IΓÇÖm not going to lie, itΓÇÖs the reason why I decided to take a deeper look into Infantree (Alex Vojdani, Donald Fisher, Matt Kronish, Jordan Avesar), one of many bands I get contacted by everyday, and I was seriously impressed so I decided to commit and review their second album, HeroΓÇÖs Dose.

It could best be described as a tale of two albums, one extremely good letting you know theyΓÇÖve got a bright future ahead of them. The other, not so good.

The album kick starts with ΓÇ£What You Wanna Do,ΓÇ¥ ΓÇ£Original SinΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£Skinny Bones Jones.ΓÇ¥ Three uninspired songs that just donΓÇÖt grab your attention at all, then ΓÇ£Bag of TricksΓÇ¥ hits your ear drums and all that negativity is out the window. The thought of ΓÇÿthis bandΓÇÖs definitely got itΓÇÖ comes to your mind. ItΓÇÖs got a real Traveling WilburysΓÇÖ (the legendary band featuring Bob Dylan, Tom Petty, Roy Orbison and George Harrison) sound to it that makes you say, ΓÇ£awesome.ΓÇ¥

The awesomeness continues right after that with ΓÇ£Fibber.ΓÇ¥ One of my favorite tracks on the album (along with ΓÇ£Here Goes NothingΓÇ¥). The lead singer hits some awesome notes and the writing is well done.

ΓÇ£Here Goes NothingΓÇ¥ is by far the best track on the album. They slow it down and hit you hard with some powerful vocals and spot on notes, all around perfect execution, which makes sense considering the album was produced by Niko Bolas. Bolas has also done Neil Young, Warren Zevon and Secret Sisters.

Will I be following Infantree after this album? Your damn right. Sometimes its better to know that the best is yet to come. IΓÇÖm sure IΓÇÖll be saying something different about Infantree ΓÇÿafter the gold rushΓÇÖ hits.
