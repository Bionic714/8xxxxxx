NOTES.........: Trimmed to fit the UK BD runtime.  The glitch from the NOR BD
                (00:41:03) was spliced out. Various scenes, mostly the beginning
                of the movie, with banding/blocking were either spliced out using
                the UK BD, which has considerably less blocking, or filtered 
                with gradfun2dbmod.
