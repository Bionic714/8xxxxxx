I think I will stick to this level, please leave your opinions on this level."
,Wonkasaur,2013-04-10T09:43Z,"thanks, man!

This is great quality @ a consistent level. I ESPECIALLY appreciate the sound level being consistent with your Adventure Time uploads. Sometimes I put in a playlist when I sleep, and it's jarring when the odd LOUD episode comes on. I only d/l your Adventure Time uploads - thanks, man! I'm looking fwd to getting the ""Glitch is a glitch"" in full and in this quality from ya! ;)
Cheers, man - and thanks again."
