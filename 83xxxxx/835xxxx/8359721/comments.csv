I've tried testing download from the same local network so maybe that's why my test didn't work. Any comments aprecciated. I need to know if it works in order to be able to upload any genuine stuff no-one have uploaded before. Thank you very much for your help. I am gonna try seeding this torrent Monday to Friday 6 a.m. to 1 p.m. UTC (GMT) {when there aren't that much people downloading so it won't mind if I stop seeding anything else people share here}. Thank you very much indeed in advance for your help."
