This is a live CD featuring KDE, distro is Slackware based, it should fit on a mini CD or you can give it a try in your favourite virtual machine. It's quite a lite distro, probably not the very lightest one, but quite close. Sorry, I am bad at describing, but I believe you could enjoy this stuff. In fact I'm just checking whether I know how to upload at the moment.
