,nickcwpg,2013-04-11T13:20Z,"I downloaded and installed. I then opened Toolkit, on the Main tab I get: ""supported office installation is not detected on this system"".  Everything is greyed out.  I go to Activation Tab and under Auto KMS tool everthing is grey. I go down tool list and everything has grey keys except KMS Server Service.  I can the click install which I did.  I then go the Product Keys Tab. When I select Office 2013 and each office product and click chek, I get a Product Key which is valid for each product. 
So that is my experience. The EZActivator is greyed out in Activation Tab.  
So I next open Word and checked for status and Product Information.  In that screen I see ""Activation Required""  What have I done wrong. Could you consider including a detailed activation instructions.  Thank You"

If that's the case, try upgrading to win7 like everyone else on the planet. It doesn't require very much more processing power."
,nickcwpg,2013-04-11T20:08Z,"I am using Win 7, 64 bit.  I am willing to uninstall and start over if you can send me more step by step instructions on activation.  I am a bit challenged with computers but know enough to follow.  Please respond ASAP...I will keep checking.  Could I contact you personally"
[V],murphy78,2013-04-12T08:00Z,"Try the MTK project page over at mdl nick...
go to mydigitallife.info then click on forums/community, then mdl projects, then Microsoft Toolkit"
,nickcwpg,2013-04-12T11:12Z,Tried another Microsoft Toolkit and same thing on Main Tag: Supported Office installation not detected on this system.  I will now uninstall Office and then try re-installing
,nickcwpg,2013-04-13T15:36Z,Ok. I had to clean install Win 7. Uninstall update kb971033 which installed itself.  Then checked registry keys to remove all microsoft office entries. I then installed your files.  The toolkit recognized the installation and activation was successful. I think the problem I was having was related to registry keys left over from previous office installations.  Thanks
,ecoSt,2013-04-16T14:30Z,"hey Murphy, thanks for this app. just have 2 doubts to clarify please
1.  do i need to uninstall the office 2007 currently running in my PC?
2.  Is this a permanent activation? (I ask because of the need to back-up activation with MTK)...or is it just another KMS activation that might need to be reactivated once in a while.

Waiting for your response... YOu a great dude"

,sundharam,2013-04-22T07:44Z,My Kaspersky detects a genric trojan when the activate button is hit in the toolkit. Any ideas how I can deal with this?
,ChillyCrossFoot,2013-04-23T17:39Z,"""setup cannot find or validate an installation file office 2013"" Whether I try to run as Administrator from the ISO Image Mounted, or from 7zip, or from a separate folder extracted from the ISO. Does not matter. Setup JUST does not start. This is B.S. Wait for a Fix. Office 2013 is nice, but what's the use if Setup cannot start? 
Can you please chime in on this? I was so frustrated I deleted the download! Will come back to DL if I can calm down. A little help would be appreciated Murphy, thank you."
,ChillyCrossFoot,2013-04-23T17:44Z,"Exact Message when Setup is Run is this.
=============================
Setup can't find or validate installation file. Please try reinstalling Office from your installation source, or if you installed from a downloaded package, please re-download and reinstall. If you continue to have problems, please contact Microsoft or your system administrator.
==============================

What mess is this? 
I have .NET 4.0 Extended. Latest Visual C++ also. What can I do?"
,ChillyCrossFoot,2013-04-23T18:00Z,This IMAGE is Corrupted. Setup does not Start. Please repost. I have downloaded this Twice.
,ChillyCrossFoot,2013-04-23T18:04Z,"NEVER MIND. I am sorry. I just found out SSE2 is a requirement for Office 2013. If you are installing on ANY x86 Processor without SSE2, you are screwed. I use such a Processor to test downloads BEFORE putting them on my main PC. So I hope I helped clear that up. Often System Requirements are over looked by many, including myself. Will try this on a different PC and report back when I have time. Thanks!"
,ShyGuyHC,2013-04-24T07:21Z,Thanks for all these updates to so many versions. Helping techs out everywhere. Much Appreciated.
,MEGAWOP,2013-04-28T03:29Z,For some reason it keep saying that it encountered an error during installation
,thescotsman1960,2013-05-19T03:29Z,"I need to write this, I'm not computer savy. This download worked for me the first time & I only wanted the Outlook portion. I kept my MS 2010 by clicking the customize and using the keep 2010. I then used WinRAR and clicked on Set up. Should say this download is on my USB 8 gig. The setup started and installed like magic. Then i restarted my HP computer. I then used WINRAR for the  MTK file, clicked set up as ADMIN then clicked the activation tab(second one from the left). Now I have a pop up from MS that says that my edition is not activated..no worries as the MTK activated successfully. Then I rebooted. Outlook 2013 took all of my setting from 2010 and works perfectly. It's activated as I checked. It was a smooth operation. Thank you Murphy78."
