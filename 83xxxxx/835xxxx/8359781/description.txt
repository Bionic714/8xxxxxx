Basically, what you have here is a beautiful MSDN ProPlus VL source
and it has an updates folder. You can't simply toss the exe files
from MS Download Center in the folder, but you can extract those files
with 7-zip and then copy the en-US and the none.MSP files to there.
You also have to add any proofing Spanish and French files or Update
nags you.

And that's exactly what I've done. These are all of the MSP files
contained in MOST of the KB exe files available for download. There
are still a few ones that don't have any MSP file inside, but
they are very small. The non-MSP kb files total about 1-2megs on
Microsoft Download. Those, you can do yourself. I cannot
pre-integrate those without making a fully custom install using
a bunch of registry settings, task settings, services, etc.
Basically, just not gonna happen; would be a mistake to even try.
