,whateveryou,2013-04-27T16:37Z,Can I use the USB boot image program from one of your Windows releases to mount this ISO to USB key?  Or does this have to be burned?

,Doubzstep,2013-05-10T04:25Z,"Hello murphy78,

I do not make requests usually and feel a little embarrassed to ask of you, but is there any chance you can do an Office release with both x86 and x64 in one .iso? This would be very convenient like all of your other torrents are.

Thanks from a big fan,

PS Keep up the great work!"
