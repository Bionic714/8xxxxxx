Bill Ryder-Jones left The Coral after their fifth studio album, Roots & Echoes, on which his arrangements hinted at a deeper and spectacular compositional talent. In 2012, Ryder-Jones explored this side of his creative talent in full with the orchestral album Ifâ€¦. His 2013 album A Bad Wind Blows In My Heart, marries his masterful capacities as arranger and composer with his first firm steps as a singer songwriter. It's an album of capital-S songs that will more than sate the appetite of those that appreciate his knack for heart swelling melody and painterly detail.
