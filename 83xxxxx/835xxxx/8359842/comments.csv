,pythonista99,2013-04-10T10:36Z,Please explain why this one is better or different from the standard one Google supplies ?
,acousticguitar,2013-04-10T10:42Z,So far the only difference i see is the new look and more choices in settings. Nothing really big 
,bry68,2013-04-10T10:56Z,@ pythonista99  it probably don't check for lic # verification 
,pythonista99,2013-04-10T15:22Z,"Cool.  Always appreciate the choices.  This is quite a critical app on a phone, and anything malicious here could cause BIG trouble  :-)"
,PolarisFx,2013-04-10T20:28Z,"I think I saw on XDA that a new Play Store had been released. I do not however think that this has the license verification patch pre-installed. You can try the other torrent here and see if it can patch this version of the store, but as I have multiple apps that check for licenses I'm gunna stick with default until I know for sure...

I do like the look of the layout though. "

You are right i have tested the patcher and it does not work nor does freedom"
