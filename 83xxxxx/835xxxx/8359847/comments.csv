,jdveraser,2013-04-13T09:20Z,very much appreciate your hard work. looking forward to more excelent anime (dubbed of course) from you. btw... do you do requests?
,DubKingdom,2013-04-15T02:12Z,Yes I have a pile of anime I'm ripping and converting for uploads people have requested though I started mainly using another site to post them. Its easier with people being able to send messages directly to you and it lets you know when a comment is posted rather then having to go look through each of them constantly. so I have been posting mainly onto Kat
,jdveraser,2013-04-18T07:46Z,so then are you dubkingdom on kat? my name is the same there too.
,jdveraser,2013-04-18T07:48Z,nvm. found you. friend request sent.
,DubKingdom,2013-05-06T20:40Z,"Yea, I'm not going to worry about trying to load torrents up to both sites so all the future ones will be loaded to kick ass t. Also all the ones that are listed on this site have been redone with a better program and listed on kick ass"
