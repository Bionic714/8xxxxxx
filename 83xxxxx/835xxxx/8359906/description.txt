CompTIA A+ certification is where IT careers begin. You'll learn how to be a computer technician -- from installation, configuration, and basic networking to computer diagnosis and maintenance. A+ certification gets you started in IT. It prepares you for your role as a Computer Technician, IT Technician, Remote Support Technician, or Depot Technician, along with many other entry-level IT jobs. 

This James Conrad A+ Certification Package is mapped to the 2006 CompTIA A+ exam objectives, while showing you what you need to know as an on-the-job computer technician.
