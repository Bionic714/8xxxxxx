Episode: The Politics of Dancing

Original Airdate: April 9, 2013
 
In this patriotic episode, Abby assigns the girls dances inspired by the political state of America, but all is not fair in politics...especially in the dance world. Maddie and Chloe compete head-to-head and continuing with the political theme Abby has the Abby Lee Dance Company vote on who gave the best performance. Forced to sit on the sidelines, injured Mackenzie must watch her coveted spot on the team be taken over by ALDC's newest little powerhouse, Asia.
