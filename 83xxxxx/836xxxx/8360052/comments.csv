,sparks529,2013-05-06T22:40Z,"Spanish also has a level 4. I have Italian Plus and Spanish 4, but I don't have the full, 30 lesson Italian 4.

They are available on the internet if you know where to look, but they're pretty hard to find. I can upload them to TPB if people are interested."

Yes Please upload Italian IV. I am looking all over and can't find it. That'd be swell! Thanks!"
