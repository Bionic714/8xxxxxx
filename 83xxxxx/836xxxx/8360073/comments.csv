,highres99,2013-04-10T15:49Z,"Hello there, Sir, please i have a question and a request- is it possible for me to play a PS1 game on my modded PS2? I really like the game RED ALERT Retaliation and since its not available on PS2, i was wondering if there'll be a way you could help me out. I've seen people modifying Nintendo games to play on PS2(Super Mario), and would appreciate if it would be possible for the Red Alert, too. Thank You for all your uploads and for your time. Waiting, please."

depending on your mod chip,you can inserrt a ps1 disc in the ps2 then double tap the power button.It should boot to ps1 mode.This works on my ps2 slim"

,highres99,2013-04-11T15:09Z,"Thanks for the info Sublime90, i'll give it a try. But before then, you said ""depending on my mod chip"" which mod chip is yours, please. I'm asking cos i'd like to compare with mine. Thanx, once again."
,Sublime90,2013-04-11T20:11Z,@highres I dont know which i=one i have because i got it pre-modded.
,highres99,2013-04-12T11:53Z,"Thanks once again, Sublime90. I forgot to mention one thing, though, the PS1 game I want to play on the modded PS2 is a Burned game, not an original CD, would it still work?"
,Sublime90,2013-04-12T19:49Z,@highres Yup.Works for me every time.
,highres99,2013-04-15T10:49Z,"Hi there Sublime90, got it to enter the PS1 mode but did not play the game. Worse still, can't play my PS2 games, either!!! Any way out? Thanks."
