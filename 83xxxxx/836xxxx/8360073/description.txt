Size      : 0.52gb                    Genre     : Adventure

Release Info:
The game draws its inspiration from traditional Mexican culture and
folklore, and features many interesting and unique characters. Guacamelee
builds upon the classic open-world Metroid-vania style of games, by adding
a strong melee combat component, a new dimension switching mechanic, and
cooperative same-screen multiplayer for the entire story. The game also
blurs the boundaries between combat and platforming by making many of the
moves useful and necessary for both of these.

We're currently looking for...
- secure and fast gbit sites
- who can supply PS3/360 games before retail date
- anything else that may be useful?

Notes:
1) Install the game .pkg from XMB
2) Put (via FTP) UP2045-NPUB30672_00-GUACAMELEE000002.edat in:
dev_hdd0/home/0000000?/exdata/
If you don't have exdata dir just create it manually and put
the .edat inside.

Tested on CFW 4.40

Enjoy
