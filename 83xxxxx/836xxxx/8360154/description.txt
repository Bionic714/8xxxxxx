Following the ΓÇ£Dark CrawlerΓÇ¥ single and LP released through Hyperdub, Terror Danjah yet again raises the bar in Grime with his the latest collection of tunes which drops today. The ΓÇ£HardwiredΓÇ¥ compilation features past bangers from the likes of Joker, Champion, Bok Bok and Royal-T as well as a special set of previously unreleased material from Kode 9, Falty DL,  Zed Bias, Swindle, D.O.K and PJam amongst others. The tunes range from the more tropical styled garage percussions to bare instrumental tunes, altogether making a really harmonious group of productions to hit the dance-floors with.

Some highlight tracks that IΓÇÖve found myself going back to quite a bit would be the eight minute ΓÇ£Arizona Skyz VIPΓÇ¥ from PJam which covers all grounds going from a garage-to-jungle tempo (making it a wicked DJ tool). Kode 9ΓÇÿs appearance on the tracklisting (ΓÇ£IceΓÇ£) definitely caught my ear and, as suspected, took me to an extremely dark place with the minimalist structure and crunching sounds of the track and FaltyDL also takes a stab at Terror DanjahΓÇÖs ΓÇ£Zumpi HuntahΓÇ¥ giving it a funked-up garage flavour. Stay FreshΓÇÖ Swifta Beater is also in the track-listing, a producer who made major waves this year in Grime,  with an absolutely beautifully crafted instrumental with an aggressive synth keeping it flowing (ΓÇ£MoveΓÇ£). To be honest, every one of these tracks will surely be heard in mixes to come in the year, if not already.

The compilation attests to GrimeΓÇÖs past and gives a good look at the future of the much growing popularity of the genre.
