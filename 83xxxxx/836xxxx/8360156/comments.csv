,lars.etch,2013-04-20T22:24Z,"@Maxxxima on TPB people don't really comment on a DLC or RGH torrent, cuz they always work, plus they have seeds not more than 10 or 12 so this one definitely works, judging by the no. of seeds."
,jakedilla,2013-04-26T15:22Z,"well you do get some comments from time to time, they're usually by someone with a retail 360 saying ""How can I play this on my Xbox 360 plz?"""
,lars.etch,2013-05-05T01:38Z,"@jakedilla I get you bro... I tried alot to get mine working and non of the ways worked so i got this freaky software ""DLCXplorer"" from a random guy over a random forum, i cant find it anywhere else lemme post it here if anyone needs it"
