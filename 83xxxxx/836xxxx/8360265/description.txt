Black Keys, the straightest Rock I know (bit of Blues, some Hendrix, some Beatles, very Black Keys). Sounds a bit underground but deserves some more light. `Nova Baby` would have been a good title song too (The Flame?). Black Keys sets the standard (with Porcupine Tree) for our Rock future. Next Love can only be better Do not mind waiting,... at all. I am stuck for a while (sorry Garbage), its pure magic.... Enjoy,
