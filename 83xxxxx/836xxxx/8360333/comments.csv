,TheKodec,2013-04-19T13:14Z,"DeLtA_Sn1p3r, Any chance of a faster download? I've downloaded 23,3 / 29,1 GB under during one + day. My current download speed remains around 0,1 - 30 kB/s with a 10/1 broadband. Please SEED the last bits! Thank you."
,TheKodec,2013-04-20T11:05Z,"Installation works like a charm and great supply of additional packs. Though MAX for Live do not seem to work as intended as it runs on the 30 day trial when installed. 

Quality 4.5/5
Installation 4/5
Download time (for me) 1/5 

Overall, 3,5 / 5 due to download time.

Great with the exception for Max otherwise!"
,sonicalchemy,2013-05-12T21:27Z,"Thanx Delta_Sn1p3r for the good work (: 
Having problems unarchiving the the64bt & the32bt
Have tried a bunch of decompressors. Is this for Mac? I have tried dl both 2xs and the same thing...
Using Stuffit 15 tried springy as well but it stops at arnd 11gb. Have tried on all 3 MBP's and my new Mac Pro 12 quads. Any help would be much appreciated. I can run it with parallels if it's for windows but thats not very convenient. The machines differ in OS Leopard, SL, ML, ML
Thanx in advance (:
Much love light peace harmony & gratitude!!!

,honbolo23,2013-05-18T18:19Z,"I seem to be having a problem with my VSTs showing up. I have it on the correct folder in preferences. On my old Ableton Live 8.2.2 the VSTs show just fine and I'm using the same directory folder in 9. I never used the packs before, I try to drag them into drum rack and it doesn't wanna play the sound through the midi track, I don't know what I could be doing wrong or curious if this is a bug or something. Nonetheless the torrent is working, I have Live 9 activated. I can make beats, I just want to use my VSTs but can't. Let me know! Thanks for sharing! I hope I can get this fixed QUICK!!!!"
