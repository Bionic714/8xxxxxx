iTUNES Rip.

Revolution comes from the minds of J.J. Abrams and Eric Kripke. It is an adventure thriller in which a family struggles to reunite in a post-apocalyptic American landscape. This is a world of empty cities, local militias and heroic freedom fighters, where every single piece of technology -- computers, planes, cars, phones, even lights -- has mysteriously blacked out.
