,pow.r.pop,2013-04-12T00:34Z,"Thanks Hawk~

Ok ok , this one was pretty good. But then again, no Ezekiel in this issue. Lets see if Mr. Puss Puss obeys his commands in issue #110  "
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-12T04:09Z,i thought you'd like the letters column bit about his tiger...
,pow.r.pop,2013-04-12T06:20Z,"STF - Yup , Think about it, if you wrote a comic book you too would lurk the pirate bay to read the comments and see how many leechers there was.

I'm betting Kirkman was talking directly to me.

Just a hunch"

,pow.r.pop,2013-04-13T04:03Z,"The only thing Kirkman should be bitching about is how they don't make sacks big enough to haul all his money to the fucking bank !

Piracy ??? Pshhh, He wouldn't even have a TV show had it not been for torrents and the spreading of word. I never would have bothered to pick up the series had I not been able to torrent the first 56 issues. 

I may still torrent, but I buy the issues to for my collection now. He never would have grown such a huge fanbase if it weren't for torrents. 

If that's you're attitude Mr. Kirkman, you money grubbing dick,...Well sir, then go fuck a corpse "
