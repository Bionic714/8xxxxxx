Looking at my PC screen I couldn't imagine having one larger. But I did not foresee the coming of high resolution smart phones and tablets. The new Samsung has 468 pixels to the inch. Your 320 wide one is only 11/16"" on such a screen. Apple has made 600x600 their standard.

I use IrfanView to create them. I first clean off any crude along the sides. Then I reduce the large dimension some to make it square. Then I reduce to 600x600. I use 85% compression. This makes it somewhat small without making it too large. If really large -- like it wasn't reduced at all -- it takes a long time to load when the song starts. Even more so if you are playing your music over WiFi."
