[T],crwildman,2013-04-12T06:13Z,"@bigrg23  You say it is a good cam?  But you only give it a 5?  

Then you say Audio is also a 5?  

A TS means it is a direct audio feed from source.    And you give that a 5?  So you obviously don't know what you are rating.  Or how to even Rate a video.  If the film is a TS.  You rate it based on being a TS.  You don't try to compare it on a scale to anything it is not.

A/8
V/8  Very Watchable.  Slight screen flicker on camera when in certain lighting.

Thanks for the upload juggs."
