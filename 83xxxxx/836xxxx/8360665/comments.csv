This japanese release comes complete with all booklets and photographs and music.
Everything is in order, box after box, cd after cd. Each cd contains one .flac, one .cue and one .log file.
For those who would like to sort them out as separate files, you can easily burn them on cd using the .cue file and an appropriate software.

Thank you gatasalvaje.
This upload is incredibly valuable. "
