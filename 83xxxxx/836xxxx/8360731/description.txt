Combining action and strategy in a unique way, Sang-Froid: Tales of
Werewolves transports you into an epic folktale co-written with best-selling
Canadian author  Bryan Perro  (Amos Daragon, Wariwulf), in which two feuding
brothers will have to put aside their differences to save their sister,  who
is pursued by the Devil himself!

This time however, sheer brute strength won't be enough to save the day as
your enemies are way stronger than you are. Only your  wits  and the  ability
to combine ingenious traps to setup deadly ambushes  will give you a chance
to see the sun rise again on your frozen piece of forest...

Features
* Plan your strategy!  - Take advantage of the calm during the day to fill
  your forest with all kinds of traps that are as inventive as they are
  deadly.
* Fight heroically!  - If some of the beasts get past your traps, that's
  when it gets bloody! First you can shoot them with your trusty musket and
  then eliminate the ones that survive by slaughtering them with your axe!
  Action and carnage guaranteed!
* Customize your character!  - Choose one of the two O'Carroll brothers and
  develop your character using a skill system based on role-playing games
  (RPGs), making your hero as unique as he is powerful!
