,Tzaddi,2013-05-13T05:58Z,"I_QBot, This book is more for those who are, at best, uninformed about atheism, or at worst, like to intentionally misrepresent atheism.

But as the author states in the beginning of the book, ""I learned about history from historians and history teachers. I learned about religion by listening to believers and reading their scriptures directly. But most of what people know about atheism they learned from people who aren’t atheists and don’t especially like or even understand them.

That’s a recipe for misinformation if ever there was one."""
