Hello, hello! This is a complete collection of musical games from both versions of Whose Line is it Anyway?. There are also non-Whose Line songs included, from the cast. This includes Drew Carey's Improv-A-Ganza.

All non-Whose Line games (except for those that are similiar to WLiiA games. Mostly Song Styles) are at the bottom, under the label "Xtra".

This is also the first torrent I've ever compiled and uploaded anywhere. If this doesn't work, please let me know.

If this works, I may add an amendment pack later with songs from the new season.

All in all, there is approximately 1.5 gigs of .mp3s in here. I spent a lot of time in the early 2000s scrounging the internet for a great collection, and I think I've succeeded.

Gotta give credit where it's due though. All those who have ripped the videos over the years - Prefect, Third Dimension, and of course, all the scene releases. TinGrin87 and Huzlinefan also helped quite a bit throughout the years with supplying me with some of these files.

Every musical game to ever be played in almost 20 seasons of Whose Line is included. And then some.

I'm a little bit proud of this pack, so pardon some of my ramblings. Let me know if this works. I'll try to keep this seeded for as long as I possibly can, but my computer is prone to shut down due to overheating, so it may fizzle from time to time. Assuming this torrent works, of course.
