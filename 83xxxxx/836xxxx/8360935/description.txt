A brand new arc begins this week in Ferals #13!  The lazy drunken Dale Chesnutt is gone.  HeΓÇÖs become a feral beast bent on ripping the lungs out of the man that took his woman.  David Lapham continues to deliver consistently powerful tales that have redefined werewolf mythology into a slick modern survival horror story.  If you havenΓÇÖt tried Ferals yet, this is the time to do so.  CBR called it ΓÇ£a fun romp and guilty pleasure series at the top of its classΓÇ¥ and  FEARnet said ΓÇ£The comic is gleefully adult, relishing sprays of blood and the occasional nipple. It has a sense of abandon that sweeps the reader with it. You feel caught in this million-mile-an-hour storyΓÇªΓÇ¥
