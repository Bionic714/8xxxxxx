28 Weeks Later 2007 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0463854/
Six months after the rage virus was inflicted on the population of Great Britain, 
the US Army helps to secure a small area of London for the survivors to repopulate and start again. But not everything goes to plan. 

Note: Like 28 Days Later, portions of Weeks were filmed at times with lesser quality sources so as to stay true to the original movie. As a result, the material shot on DV and 16mm will be covered in an inherent fine layer of grain. These scenes were most evident when "the infected" appear on screen, and this was confirmed by Fresnadillo in the commentary track. He wanted the camera to be "infected" when infection is on-screen...
