,faceeater,2013-04-11T02:31Z,why would you have to delete it?

my new policy is to seed to no more than 10:1 and if I'm the only one seeding at that point - rather than leave a post with no seeds that users may inadvertently leech without possibility of seeding - I delete the post.

I don't want to be a rube,  compromising my internet connection for the benefit of selfish leeches who NEVER seed, AND I don't want to be one of those posters that abandon a post that will never be seeded again...

If you're not going to contribute material by uploading then the least you can do is seed for a reasonable amount of time/bandwidth."
