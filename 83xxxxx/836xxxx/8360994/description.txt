Sales Advice Not Swiped From Other Books!
This book is about getting rich by becoming far better at the selling process that your competitors. What it is NOT is the kind of warmed-over, clich√©-ridden advice you find replicated in a jillion other books on selling. Dan Kennedy would never have it that way.
He offers a set of No B.S. strategies for overcoming obstacles to success, many of them self-imposed. Provocative, sarcastic, and irreverent, the book reads like the seminars Kennedy conducts around the world - events that cause a stampede to the back of the hall for his materials after he finishes his presentation.
