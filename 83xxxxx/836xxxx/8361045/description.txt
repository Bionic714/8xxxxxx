Review:
When Wayne Coyne opened The Flaming LipsΓÇÖ 2004 Coachella set by crowd-surfing in a giant inflatible bubble, it represented more than just another gimmick to add to the bandΓÇÖs ever-increasing arsenal of theatrical parlour tricks. It effectively split the Flaming Lips into two bands. On the one hand, you have the merry pranksters that have remained a constant in music-new feeds for the past decade, whether theyΓÇÖre doing rails with Ke$ha, beefing with Erykah Badu, or taking the concept of a physical album release to literal extremes. And then the other, you have a band that, over the past few years, has entered the most fiercely experimental, stridently anti-pop phase of its long and storied career. ItΓÇÖs just that the former aspect inevitably overshadows the latter-- even on the tours for 2009ΓÇÖs dark, disorienting Embryonic, volcanic salvos like ΓÇ£Worm MountainΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£See the LeavesΓÇ¥ simply got subsumed into the LipsΓÇÖ usual onstage circus and became the backing soundtrack to more bunny-costume dances.
