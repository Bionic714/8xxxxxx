The Blu-rays on this one were exceptional quality. I sat through many preview encodes to try and capture the original quality as best as possible with the smallest size and after 6.5 days straight of encoding on a 2600k @ 4.8Ghz we are left with this. 1.6GB per episodes is not exactly small but completely necessary to get close to original quality. I did keep the grain as best as I could. If you want a slightly smaller size with no grain or 720p go download the [OZC] release.

The movies video is Hi10p (10 bit) and also not my encode. I re-encoded the audio for the Japanese 24 bit FLAC to 640Kbps AC3 and re-muxed making English the default language. I don't remember the release group sorry. Thanks to them for that video encode.

Lastly be sure to buy this when / if it comes out on Blu-ray in the US / EU it is going to be one hell of a collection.
