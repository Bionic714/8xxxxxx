The most complete unnofficial Eminem collection. All 46 music videos, 80 live performances, 4 complete concerts and 10 albums, including "D-12 World" and "Hell: The Sequel". ALL the albums are in FLAC format, and I tried my best to obtain the best quality from the videos. Enjoy the 409 files! :D

P.S.: This is going to take a loooong time for me to seed it, so please be patient.
