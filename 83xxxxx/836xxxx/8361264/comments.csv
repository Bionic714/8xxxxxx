Thanks for the film . . .but what's with sudden switching into Italian for long stretches?
The actors are still speaking English but the sound is dubbed in Italian."

Not sure,  didnt have time to see the movie,  only ripped it then checked some parts of it.  sorry for that friend.  :(

That might be the reason my nick is KeFF coz i make zom keff-blunts sometimes.
I'll try to make a new one, do you whant with or without swesub?"
