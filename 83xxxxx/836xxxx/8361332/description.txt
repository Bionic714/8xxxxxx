Assimil 
Assimil is the ideal solution for anyone wanting to learn modern, practical German efficiently and naturally. 

How does the Assimil method work? 

All our courses are based on Intuitive Assimilation, an original principle that is both simple and highly effective. We have taken this natural process, through which you learned your own language, and adapted it to our books and audio courses. Working progressively, with natural, lively dialogues, simple text notes and exercises, you will progress steadily to a level where you are able to converse in everyday situations. 

ΓÇó The first part of the course is the passive phase: you immerse yourself in the language by reading and repeating each lesson. 
ΓÇó During the second, active phase, you use the structures and reflexes you have already absorbed while continuing to advance and learn. 

In just a few months, you will be able to speak German easily, fluently and naturally.
