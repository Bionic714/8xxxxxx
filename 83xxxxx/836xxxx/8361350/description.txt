Anne Frank Remembered
This Oscar winning feature documentary is the first and, to this day, the only truly comprehensive eye-witness account of the life and legacy of the iconic child diarist, Anne Frank. Combining surprising and often emotional interview, photographs, previously undiscovered family letters, rare archive footage (including the only known moving footage of Anne herself) with evocative contemporary film, and this haunting documentary was halied as a masterpiece; in the British and American press when it was first released in 1995. By peeking away the onion skin layers of mythology and concentrating closely on the details of Anne's brief life, rather than her famous Diary the film makes real, as never before, the story of this one child and her family, and those who lived and died with her. == DVD Release Date: 1 Feb 2010 ==
