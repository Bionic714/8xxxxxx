Some schools offer a one-semester course - these are usually for people who are becoming teachers and may be taught out of the School of Education. This is a growing course, and it may be replacing Western Civ. at some schools or added to the curriculum in addition to Western Civ. Enrollment for world history is about 420,000 students per year.
