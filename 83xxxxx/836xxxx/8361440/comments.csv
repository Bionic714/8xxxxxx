,euphya,2013-04-11T22:03Z,A/V is pretty good. Much better than past versions. A8 V9. It seems that the scenes in between the individual stories have been cut out. I can not attest  to just how many missing scenes there are though since this is the only version I have watched more than 2 minutes of. Thanks NLUPPER002 :)
