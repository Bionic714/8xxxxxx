Thatcher: Phew, at Last

Chumbawamba ΓÇô Margaret Thatcher EP ΓÇÿIn MemoriamΓÇÖ was mailed out on 8th April, 2013, to all who pre-ordered the CD. No further orders will be taken.

SheΓÇÖs not been gone more than a few hours, and already the national media have cranked into gear and begun the blandly respectful eulogies ΓÇô at their most critical they seem to be only able to say: ΓÇÿShe polarised opinion ΓÇª whatΓÇÖs certain is how much of an impact she made on Britain ΓÇª etc etcΓÇÖ

Twitter set off at a pace with a thousand ΓÇÿDing Dong the Witch is DeadΓÇÖ messages only to be followed by a slew of bleeding heart liberals bemoaning the fact that people were daring to celebrate someoneΓÇÖs death.

Pah! LetΓÇÖs make it clear: This is a cause to celebrate, to party, to stamp the dirt down. Tomorrow we can carry on shouting and writing and working and singing and striking against the successive governments that have so clearly followed ThatcherΓÇÖs Slash & Burn policies, none more so than the present lot. But for now, we can have a drink and a dance and propose a toast to the demise of someone who blighted so many peopleΓÇÖs lives for so long.

If we must show a little reverence and decorum at this time, then so be it. Our deepest sympathies go out to the families of all Margaret ThatcherΓÇÖs victims.
