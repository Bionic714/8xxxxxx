,pumpkin33,2013-04-18T21:47Z,anyone know of a webpage that has directions on how to zip these files so they don't take up so much room? How about a site that walks you through making your first torrent?
,cetme308,2013-04-19T00:31Z,"Most of the files are .PDF and are not going to compress very much - It's not worth the trouble or time to do so.  Besides, hard drives are getting pretty cheap, as are blu-ray burners/media.  Delete the ones you know you have no interest in and keep the rest...  For example, I did a quick check and compressed 427megs of PDF files and it compressed down to 395megs...


If you use uTorrent, go to the File menu, click on Create Torrent, select the file or folder you want to include.  As for the trackers, I just copied and pasted from another torrent I downloaded from here.  check the Start Seeding box, and then click on create and save as - type a file name and let uTorrent do the rest. When it is done, you can upload the .torrent file here or where ever...

Before uploading this series, I had never created a torrent before - It's pretty easy..."
