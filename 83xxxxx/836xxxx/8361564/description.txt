"Fresh and mystic album named ΓÇ£Owl SplintersΓÇ¥ opens the musical scenes from modern classic to dark ambient. Recorded in the studio based in Germany the work contains some improvisation with sound and technique.

Hardly it is possible to find exact musical definition for this work because it is a mixture of all that is considered to be valuable in academic plane. The creation that leaves behind the limit of the mind."
