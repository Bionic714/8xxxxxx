This is pretty much a Complete Discography of My Bloody Valentine. Included here are all 3 of their studio albums, their 2 mini-albums, their 7 EP's, 4 various compilations, 5 different singles, and their only Official live album "Man You Love To Hate" (I didn't have this on hand, and the only one I could find around here was  a cassette rip in a crappy CBR of 192, so sorry about that).

Also, I've thrown in 3 different bootlegs; 1 from Vancouver in 1992 (commonly known as "Loom"), 1 from the ICA in London from 2008, and a another from London from their 2013 tour.

Lastly, I've also included a Vinyl Rip of "Loveless" in a 24-96 FLAC format and I've included the 24-96 version of 2013's "MBV". As a bonus, I've thrown in a concert video from Leicester, England from May 4, 1990. Enjoy!
