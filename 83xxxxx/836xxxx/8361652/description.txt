GAME INFORMATION:

Cities in Motion 2 (CIM2) is the sequel to the popular mass transit
simulation game Cities in Motion. Build, manage and lead your
transportation network to provide cities with their ever changing needs.
CIM2 introduces new features including multiplayer game modes, day and
night cycles, timetables and dynamic cities.

Building the transportation network will directly affect how the city
grows. Affordable transportation brings middle class housing and work
places, while more expensive and exotic choices bring high end businesses.
Take advantage of many different types of vehicles including buses, trams,
ferries and more.

Build alone or play cooperatively with a friend. Use the newly implemented
bus lanes to build efficient traffic free roadways. Tackle rush hour by
managing transportation timetables and meeting the needs of the citizens

INSTALLATION INFORMATION:

Extract, mount and copy to applications.

We noticed a bug in the game that when Apply/OK settings the window doesn't go away.
Settings are however saved but you need to CMD+Q and relaunch it. Blame the devs..
