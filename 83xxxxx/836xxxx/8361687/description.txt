"4 Star Revue" was the original title of this comedy-variety series, 
which by  its second year was retitled "All Star Revue" to accomodate 
more rotating hosts after Danny Thomas left to start his sitcom.

It's sort of like Colgate Comedy Hour, and a few of the regular hosts
are the same in both series ( Jimmy Durante, Eddie Cantor, Danny Thomas ).

In this episode, Abe Vigoda made an early TV appearance as the
cab driver in the live Motorola commercial with Jimmy Durante.
