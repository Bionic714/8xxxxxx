,Abarrat,2013-04-11T02:07Z,Know where i can find the original Comics Greatest World series from Darkhorse? or the Star Wars stories from Darkhorse.
,binderguy1,2013-04-11T03:09Z,"Look under Dark Horse Heroes Omnibus.  It collects both the World's Greatest Heroes and Will to Power.  If that's what you're looking for.

As for the Star Wars from DH, there's too many to list and your best bet is to download in bulk.

There's alot of Star Wars torrents."
