IF YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW TO SEED, simply allow the torrent to stay in your torrent client (BitTorrent, uTorrent) after it has finished downloading. In other words, download the file, and then leave it be with the program open. It will continue seeding. Thanks all."

On my computer, I mean. I regularly listen to the 2 real albums on my record player.

NCC86, way to go!!"

However, if you REALLY think the artist(s) are making a positive change then buy their music, help to publicize their shows, or just send them a few pound in the post. I'm sure they won't argue with that. "
