Doctor Who 1974 to 1981, entire run of the fourth Doctor portrayed by Tom Baker. 

The Australian Digital broadcast files in terms of quality are somewhat comparable to DVD. The original files were around 350 megabytes, i reencoded them to a more manageable 175 megabytes. Some of these files from the original torrent had a large watermark on the bottom right corner. For those episodes i used other sources.

All the marked as DVD Rips have the following specs:
VIDEO:
Container: MKV
Codec: H264 @ 872 kbps
Resolution: 640 x 480 (4:3 aspect ratio)

AUDIO: AAC @ 128 kbps or MP3 @ 128 Kbps (Depending on the source file) 	

Some of the source files which i listed below were DVD rips but weren't made by me. They used lower resolution (less than 640x480) and were encoded in xvid (rather than h264).

I also included Shada, this is an unfinished serial intended to be the final of Season 17, but was never completed due to a work strike at the BBC during filming. In 1992, its recorded footage was released on video using linking narration by Tom Baker to complete the story.

There is another version of Shada created by Big Finish Productions, it was created as an audio play, with flash animation and was made available on BBCi and the BBC website in 2003. This version saw Paul McGann take on the role of the 8th Doctor, with Lalla Ward reprising her role as Romana II, with an otherwise different cast. Portions of the Big Finish version were reworked to make the story fit into Doctor Who continuity. (I didn't include this version in this torrent).
