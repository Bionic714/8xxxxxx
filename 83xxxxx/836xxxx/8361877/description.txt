"Dollar Days"

After successfully graduating from dental 
assisting school, Frankie attempts to 
interview for a job but discovers that, 
when asked about herself, she doesn't 
quite know how to describe who she is. 
Meanwhile, when Axl gets his band their 
first paying gig at the Orson Dollar Days, 
Sue becomes a 'Yoko' to boyfriend Darrin's 
'John' and begins to offer unwanted advice 
to the group; and when Brick informs 
Frankie and Mike that he has joined the 
Prairie Scouts, Mike ends up reluctantly 
having to lead his quirky troop's camping 
trip. Jack McBrayer guest stars as Dr. 
Goodwin, who interviews Frankie for a 
possible job.
