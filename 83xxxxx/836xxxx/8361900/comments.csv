,tdurden83,2013-04-11T22:14Z,"holy bejeezus!! thanks, I may have to toss my ultimate library in favor of this"
,tdurden83,2013-04-11T22:38Z,"just looked at the way you have them organized, i'm impressed and definitely going to dl and seed. quick question though, in the post death of spider-man/x-men folder there are some files named 6119.cbr.ptl and so on, by the file size they look to be dupes of the other 13 issues in that folder. it's no big deal, only curious if they are important or if I should just deselect them? thx again for the ul"
,Dexterosity,2013-04-12T18:42Z,"The .ptl files were a backing up issue with my external harddrive. I thought I had deleted them all, which you can do. Or if you delete the .ptl from the filename and leave the original extension (.cbr usually) you'll see the original file"
,tdurden83,2013-04-13T01:33Z,"I just decided to go ahead and dl them along with everything else, that way I can seed the whole thing for awhile. then i'll delete once I'm through seeding. thx for the answer"

,Bialgesuard,2013-04-24T01:23Z,"Thanks a ton for the compilation, Dexterosity. I know praise from internet anonymous may be small comfort, but it truly is appreciated. Especially for those without access to these comics in the first place."
,ankmiike,2013-05-09T12:44Z,"Thanks a lot man. I had finished reading the Ultimate X-Men arc and, since then, have been looking everywhere for 'Ultimate X: Origins'. After a lot of searching could only find issues 1, 2 & 5. Issues 3 & 4 are nowhere else on the internet except in your torrent. Thanks man :)
Much appreciated
May Thor bless you"
