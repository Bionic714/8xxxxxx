,ChingaTuu,2013-05-10T15:53Z,"...Hey STFM, considering that the IDW series is officially canon according to JJ and Orci, can we get a complete archive of all the IDW issues up to and including Countdown to Darkness? Especially since  the issue where Harry Mudd is rushed to Starfleet Medical by Cyrano Jones when Mudd's sexual experimentation with Tribble Stuffing goes a bit too long and the Tribbles start to breed before the parent can be extracted. This has an important meaning to the ending of STID, especially by giving all the K/S ""slashfic"" fans the sad news that it's inclusion in the film's plot means that there can *never* be a Kirk-Spock gay relationship due to resulting medical reasons.

[ducks while K/S ladies start throwing dead tribbles]

...Heh, pull this off, and I may have to repack the archive, just so it'll have one of those modified DC Archive covers listing it as the STFM Official Memory Alpha Archive :)"
