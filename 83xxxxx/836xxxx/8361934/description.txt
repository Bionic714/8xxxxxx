"Flip Flop"

Phil is pretty confident in his ability to
sell Claire and Cam's flipped house, but when
it proves to be a little harder than he
thought, he recruits the whole family into
taking some desperate, borderline crazy
measures. Meanwhile, Javier is visiting Manny
and brings along his new girlfriend, which
doesn't sit very well with Gloria.
