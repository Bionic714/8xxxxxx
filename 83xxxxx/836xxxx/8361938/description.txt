The Green Guide for Artists inspires artists to make better eco-conscious choices within their work and their studios and shows them how. The book has four sections: The first contains recipes for DIY art supplies such as ones for mixing your own non-toxic paints and adhesives and making your own papers from recycled paper. The second offers safe and green practices for the workspace. The next section shares a fresh look at using recycled materials through creative step-by-step projects and a gallery section. The final section contains a resource guide for eco-friendly materials and supplies, including websites and forum links.
