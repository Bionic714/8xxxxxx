,h20baby,2013-04-11T03:59Z,Thank you from Australia!!!! :)
,Epuni,2013-04-11T13:06Z,You must be so happy it's over!  haha!  Thanks for the whole season!
[T],duranie,2013-04-12T02:43Z,"Epuni, you made me laugh!   I was ready for 15 episodes like season 1. So this was a nice surprise for me.  

I feel bad for RHOV fans though, as 10 episodes is a very short season.

,Epuni,2013-04-12T07:03Z,"hehe!  :)

I'm kinda glad it's ending with 10 episodes cause I don't know how much more I can handle Jody.  She literally makes my blood boil every time she opens her big fat mouth!"
,Thelxi,2013-04-15T22:18Z,"Thank you for uploading the whole season.

Is there any chance for you to upload the reunion whenever it is aired if at all? Nothing beats seeing Jody put on blast and humiliated by logic :D"
,fixatia,2013-04-25T01:40Z,i read today that there is not going to be a reunion. how lame!  the reunions have always been my favourite episodes of every housewives series.  why  would a station even pick up this garbage if you aren't going to get a completed series.
