I am happy to see your reply. I am a big fan of Hitchcock, Billy Wilder and Buster keaton.

Can you consider doing those legends movie like The man who knew too much (both 1934 & 1956), The lost weekend (1945), Topaz (1969), Our hospitality (1923) and any movie of them from you.

If possible do these movie in 1080p. Thanks in advance Jalucian :)"
,onlyHD,2013-04-11T11:02Z,"I just find the Topaz extended version in 1080p here https://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7837612/Alfred_Hitchcock_12Topaz_1969-2012_avchd_1080p_EN_NL_B-Sam

I find only two torrents of Topaz with extended cut. The above link has smaller size while the other one is around 38gb. Please do it if possible as this is not done before by anyone."
,jalucian,2013-04-14T02:55Z,Look for Topaz 1080p Tuesday evening. It will be encoded and posted by then.
,onlyHD,2013-04-14T19:15Z,"Wow !! Great :)

I just can't find any words other than thank you !!"
,jalucian,2013-04-15T20:05Z,"I'm also planning on doing Vertigo (restored) in 1080p. I don't see any low file size versions of it either, and it's my favorite Hitchcock film. Should be done by end of week. "
,jalucian,2013-04-16T02:35Z,"Bad news. The link you provided was an .iso file and for some reason there was no audio detected by my encoding program (either corrupt or some sort of copy protection) so I'm going to have to try for another source, which may not be easy. This could set my timeline back by several days, IF I can get another source. Sorry."
,onlyHD,2013-04-16T10:19Z,"OOPS..!!!

My bad. I had no idea that the link i provided would be iso. Am sorry for wasting your bandwidth. But i appreciate you tried. It's okay, take your time my friend :)"
,onlyHD,2013-04-16T10:21Z,"BTW any luck with the other requested classics ?

And also waiting for vertigo :)"
,jalucian,2013-04-16T22:12Z,"What if I did Topaz in 720p and gave it the same bitrate that I give my 1080s? Maybe that would allow you to full screen it and still have 1080p-like quality? Ive never tried that, but it's a theory.

Our Hospitality I could only find a 720p source and it isn't well seeded. The Lost Weekend hasn't been released in HD from what I can tell, and same for the 1956 version of The Man Who Knew Too Much. I did locate a 1080p of the 1934 version though. Could you help keep it seeded for a good long while if I did that one, because I suspect it would have only a limited audience. "
,onlyHD,2013-04-17T13:23Z,"I will seed them for sure even if you didn't ask me, after all it's my request :)

If you could find only 720p of those movies, then do them in 720p.

I was looking for Extended cut of Topaz in any form like 480p, 720p. So it's not a problem for me.

For a decent 720p i think 1 MB/s is enough for me :)"
,jalucian,2013-04-18T21:58Z,"If you could choose which one to get first, would you want Topaz in 720p or The Man Who Knew Too Much in 1080p? Thanks for your help with seeding btw! If you can spare the HD space and bandwidth for a while, Killing Zoe and All the Presidents Men both need some seeding help. I'll try and get at least one of your requests encoded and posted within the next few days."
,onlyHD,2013-04-19T18:19Z,"As i mentioned before ""Topaz Extended cut"" is so rare and so The man who knew too much.
So let it be 720p, 1080p or even 480p ;)
Anyway it's so kind of you to ask my suggestion but you do as you wish based on the time slot you get :)"
,jalucian,2013-04-22T23:49Z,"Here is Vertigo in 1080p, and I've finished encoding The Man Who Knew Too Much as well. I will probably post it day after tomorrow after Ferris Bueller's Day Off im 1080p.
