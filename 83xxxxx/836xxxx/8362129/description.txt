"My Heart Would Know"

A personal crisis in Nashville causes Rayna to
leave the tour in New York City before her
sold-out concert with Juliette, but for
Juliette, the show must go on. Jolene stakes a
claim on her sober counselor Dante as Juliette
gets closer to him personally and
professionally, and Deacon doesn't like the
woman Juliette has become and tells her point-
blank. Gunnar declares the next 24 hours a
"Scarlett O'Connor party" to celebrate her
success, and she brings Will along to join the
fun. Meanwhile Avery becomes a roadie for
Juliette, and secrets involving the men in
Rayna's life see the light of day.
