,Dabibsta,2013-04-12T00:20Z,"I just signed up to comment on this.. I read all these comments and was totally turned off to download this. I have been downloading since the beginning . The people complaining about this copy are total morons. I just looked at it and the hard coded skype thing is not even 1/2 as bad as everyone is making it out to be. This is a HUGE movie and already has a nice copy and your complaining about something so pety? You people are not worthy of commenting you make no sense. If your gonna complain at least be ""accurate"" and everyone said same thing. Wow this world is going DOWN... idiots. "
,Dabibsta,2013-04-12T00:23Z,And so everyone who looks at comments for information on the file like they should here is the REAL information. Not based on opinions but reality of what is on this RIP. The skype thing isn't in the middle of the screen the whole movie . Not even close. It isn't even on there a lot of the times and sometimes it's smaller in the top right or left. Only a few times is it in the middle of the screen and it isn't even that annoying. This is a big movie don't know about you guys but I am beyond impressed any rip is out of this. You should be thanking this guy not making false statements and turning people off such a great rip and movie.

,Dabibsta,2013-04-12T05:07Z,"michaelrwatson are you blind? Did you even look at the copy before you started whining like a little kid? I posted the correct info to the file for everyone. And after I easily showed everyone was wrong you still say the same thing? And have the audacity to call people retards and 12 yr olds? LOL.. I wish I could meet some of you idiots and slap the shit out of you for being so ignorant. The one comment that did make sense though was the one about ""why"" the watermark is on there at all. And I can see that being true that it's a setup to get people to hang themselves and message on skype and show they are downloading illegally. And with the IQ's I am seeing I am thinking they made a smart choice because I can picture you morons trolling him on skype with the lack of life you have. Ok I am done I win."
,Dabibsta,2013-04-12T05:14Z,@wanderinpilgrim I find it amusing that you signed up to leave a comment and it is totally wrong. You really are a waste of space. You took the time to complain about there being an Ad in the middle of the screen so it won't happen again. When the Skype thing is only on there 5 mins or so at a time. And I would say 25 mins of the movie have it in the middle of the screen. It is completely normal for that to happen. And it isn't overboard at all. Before you state something why don't you get some facts so when someone watches it they don't realize how ignorant your comment was. But hey maybe you lack pride like most of these comments. Commenting is fun lol 
,Dabibsta,2013-04-12T05:23Z,"Ok one last comment with information regarding if this file has the ""complete"" movie. I looked up the runtime. It is 126 mins. The first file cd1 is 60 mins long and the cd2 is 57 mins long. That is the FULL movie. The credits are all that is missing but maybe you like those enough to complain about a great upload. Idiots."

a/v 7 for cam"
,TheCrowdGoesWild,2013-04-13T04:08Z,"As others have said, text advertising the guys Skype name appear approx every 10 minutes, some smaller and to the side while others (about 4 or 5) are pretty large, red letters and plastered in the middle of the screen for around 4 minutes at a time.

Last pivotal action scene of the movie is totally out of focus and impossible to work out what the hell is going on. Rest of the movie is in focus for the most part.


I imagine that this FOX guy has the original that no watermarks and is hoping someone will contact him so he can sell it to them, it's the only reason to plaster his ads all over the show.

I'd guess that this FOX guy would now be the most trolled Skype user in the world at the moment.

A - 8 Pretty decent for a cam
V - 8.5 IF there was no watermarks, but seeing that there are watermarks and the action scene at the end is out of focus, I rate it a 5/10 for video.

The author conviently leaves out his douche-baggery in the screen caps.  On Cap shows a white ad that is out of the way, but in reality, those ads are EXTREMELY ANNOYING and obtrusive.  
     I get wanting kudos for your hard work, but 1. you aren't gonna get any money off of this and 2.  What you're doing is ILLEGAL, so why would you want it that much easier for people to identify you for prosecution? Silly, narcissist!)  It sucks that this dude plastered his ads all huge and bright like that, because it is actually pretty good quality for a cam -- EXCEPT for the scenes with crappy focus and how the whole thing's cropped so you dont see the entire picture as shot (heads cut in half, etc.)

,Katee1,2013-04-19T22:29Z,"Like a ton of other people here, the watermarks made me a member!  LOL  I am one of the people who is always saying -thank the uploader, people!!- and I still mean it. And, I don't think the bad language is called for.  .......ok...now that's out of the way.  

UPLOADER - THIS PART IS FOR YOU:  You see what's happened, right?  People hate you now and whatever it was that you were pushing through those horrible adverts will not be bought, seen, whatever.  I did look at the screenshot and it's ridiculous.  

Here's what you could have done --because, YES, you do deserve credit for your work, A brief promotion/sinage on the screen at the start, perhaps as the movie studio logos show up along with one at the end.  You could also do what the studios themselves do when they submit the films for awards and do semi-transparant watermarks discreetly, meaning top right, bottom, etc. not over the actors themselves and not in red, etc.  And, only a few times..meaning 3, max, during the film.  

Had you done this, you would see three pages of praise here instead of insults (whether they were over the top or not).  That's what you want, right?  You spent time offering up something for free and it looks like you did a good job.  No one is talking about that.  No one is asking, where can I get more.  Or saying, please...upload more.  Or...what else do you do or offer...which is where an opening to a possibility to make money might come in, because most of us have or want jobs: that's not a sin.

So, just take the lesson and your licks and next time follow the guidelines I suggested and I bet you get a great reaction.  I'm not an expert in movies, but I am one in promotion.  If I saw your screenshot and the quality was horrible, or the A/V ratings were crap, I wouldn't take the time to write this post, but it sounds like you're a talented person who got a little over zealous after spending a lot of time on a great product that you were set to give away.

Thank you uploader.  I hope we see more from you... sans over the top watermarks, but certainly with some information on where we might see more of your material. :-)"

Their small brains can't actually absorb a movie and its plot in any event. They just want to see lots of color and movement on the screen. :D"
,GavinFace,2013-04-28T13:36Z,"I don't know why you desperate fuckwits would waste your time watching a movie like this which is all about the eye candy/special effects, in a FUCKING SHITHOUSE CAM VERSION. Be patient and wait for a dvd rip you fucking gutter dwelling slobbering pigs."

V 0
A 0

wait until this comes out to the cheap theatres or for a bluray rip...otherwise, you can't possibly get any enjoyment out of this DECENT sci-fy movie....

if you hate Tom Cruise don't watch it...much like how he ruined Jack Reacher..."

Overall: Very watchable

Note: VERY Annoying hardsubs promoting whoever got this for most of the film. Arabic subtitles in some areas. "

,legio9,2013-05-18T22:23Z,"Am in here since the very beginning of TPB. and HATE to see what garbage pollutes the site now.

In accordance with a TRUE and STANDARD rating method of QUALITY where:

Blue ray = 10
DVD= 9
Excellent mkv, xvid etc = 8
Excellent cam = 5

This one is rated:
V =3
A= 3

Never rate M as its a question of personal preference.

Note: xxxlavalxxx NEVER upload ANYTHING higher than 3, especially that he NEVER comes up with his own material (renamed copies of others)

Now if you want REAL uploaders who thrive toward QUALITY, looks at extremzone (smaller format) or BOXZ (perfect picture  but larger file size)

but then again, what do you want? Quality viewing and sharing or are you satisfied with mediocrity and garbage?"
,jthm,2013-05-19T08:53Z,Ive got the personal contact info plus home adress for the user with that skype name.  Shall I post it? 
,David89an,2013-05-20T12:40Z,"Blue ray = 10

This torrent is:

IMO, the sound is not TS/other source. It sounds like its from the cam."

A:5

Would have been better WITHOUT THE STUPID
WATERMARKS throughout the movie.

One or two at the beginning and end would have
been enough ya think...

I would wait for a better copy... preferably one
WITHOUT the watermarks every few minutes...
kind of takes your eyes off of the movie and
what is going on.

Either way, thx for UL."

It is a CAM  copy of the movie, but it has this silly advert imprinted in the centre of the screen - it reads FOXIMAGINE - seemingly a skype address, a silly, pointless thing to do that wrecked an already difficult to watch movie. 

Use one of the other torrents and dont entertain this goon who is clearly a desperate virgin trying to get a bang and no one is having a bar of it. 

The bleedin' hack of this dope.

Even though it's a trusted source (Red Pirate) the print has watermark advertising right in the middle of the screen for some two minutes and corners and sides at other times. The quality is OK but imagefox has forever achieved the SPAM LIST OF SHAME. What a wast to do a good rip then poison it with self aggrandizement. Oh what a good boy you aren't.
