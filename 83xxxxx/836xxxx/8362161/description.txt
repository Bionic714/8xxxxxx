A young woman discovers that she is the focus of an evil nazi experiment involving selective breeding and summoned elves, an attempt to create a race of supermen. She and two of her friends are trapped in a department store with an elf, and only Dan Haggerty, as the renegade loose-cannon Santa Claus, can save them.

I cannot say enough about this movie. It is definitely in my top 3 best/worst movies ever. This movie will make you cry with laughter.

My intent here is to try to ul the torrents that I haven't been able to find on tpb. I will seed until there are a sufficient amount of seeders. Any constructive criticism will be received. Looking forward to sharing some rarities.
