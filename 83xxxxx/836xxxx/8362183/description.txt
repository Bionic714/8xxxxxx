Widespread Panic
Jazz & Heritage Festival
Fairgrounds Race Course
New Orleans, LA.

*****SBD REMASTER*****

~Note: This doesn't sound like wsp's main board. This was either done 
thru wsp's onstage monitor sbd or through the festival board. I have 
remixed this to sound as close to the other '97 sbds as possible, in 
any case an upgrade.
