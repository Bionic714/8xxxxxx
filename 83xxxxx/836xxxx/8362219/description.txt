Gorilla Interrupted was the first major collaboration between the people that would go on to form Red Letter Media. Shot in 2002 and remastered in 2013, this updated version of the rarely-seen film features newly shot special effects and a new score.


Included with the movie is the retrospective documentary ΓÇ£How Not to Make a Movie,ΓÇ¥ which chronicles how these guys all met and started making movies together, the disasterous production of Gorilla Interrupted, and how the new effects and remastering were accomplished. The DVD also includes commentary track and outtakes.
