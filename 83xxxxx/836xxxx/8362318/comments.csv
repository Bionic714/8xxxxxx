[V],psspss,2013-04-11T09:24Z,"you might as well get haunted collector of et this week as Im low on data yet again

http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8362464/Haunted_Collector_S03E06_Spirits_of_Gettysburg_Headless_Horseman"
[V],psspss,2013-04-11T13:20Z,"theres also a new ghost series called deep south paranormal again low data I cant do it.. 
but its already up if search.. not sure if any good
might be like that other south team called ghostland"
,q2323,2013-04-11T14:06Z,"psspss: use uTorrent for seeding. right click on seeded torrent in the list, choose properties, and check the ""initial seed"" checkbox. you wont have a problems with seeding to a big amounts of leeches anymore.

I am not sure if you know this.

thanks for the upload."
[V],psspss,2013-04-12T04:50Z,"yes I know that but the down side it will add another 1 or 2 to seed out a 350mb

I dont have a seedbox with unlimited gbs on it like most scene cappers use

and I do use initial seeding I then can see which
ips get some data and sit for ages.. then I know
who to block then I realease it

also since not all peers use utorrent initial seeding dont always work well and can hang depending how many connect with non utorrent

the easiest would be if people read and bloody seeding or stay off .. surely if you see none or 1 on 100 percent and you limit kbs upload you stay off for a while"
[V],psspss,2013-04-12T04:51Z,another `1 or 2 hours (missed hours above)
,q2323,2013-04-12T14:34Z,"With initial seeding, I always seed things out just by ratio 1.1 to 1.2, without it, its about 1.5 to 2.0 depending on leechers upload speed settings..."
[V],psspss,2013-04-12T16:07Z,"generally it slows upload speed from 100kbs down to 20kb/s and depends on peers but could get up to about 70ks  if lucky but never reaches max speed
why it takes longer to seed out thats cos it has more work to calc and track on the ut client

again people need to be sharers they seem very bad lately else it ruins it for them and others affects the global good"
[V],psspss,2013-04-12T16:13Z,as one can see im not sharing much now cos greedy people took more from me then I could offer..for a given month.. every costs..its only free at my cost mostly and some of their cost in data too but the uploader has the better burden and risks in sharing now days
[V],psspss,2013-04-18T07:24Z,"i have ep6 but since out of data for 2 days or so

I cant share it"
