Since its publication in 1960, William L. Shirer's monumental study of Hitler's 
German empire has been widely acclaimed as the definitive record of the 20th 
century's blackest hours. The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich offers an 
unparalleled and thrillingly told examination of how Adolf Hitler nearly 
succeeded in conquering the world. With millions of copies in print around the 
globe, it has attained the status of a vital and enduring classic.

Now, many years after the end of World War II, it may seem incredible that 
our most valued institutions and way of life were threatened by the menace 
that Hitler and the Third Reich represented. Shirer's description of events and 
the cast of characters who played such pivotal roles in defining the course 
Europe was to take is unforgettable.

Benefiting from his many years as a reporter, and thus a personal observer 
of the rise of Nazi Germany, and availing himself of some of the 485 tons of 
documents from the German Foreign Office, as well as countless other 
diaries, phone transcriptions, and other written records, meticulously kept at 
every level by the Germans, Shirer has put together a brutally objective 
account of how Hitler wrested political control of Germany, and planned and 
executed his six-year quest to dominate the world, only to see Germany go 
down in flames.

This is a richly rewarding experience for anyone who wants to come to grips 
with the mysterious question of how this menace to civilization ever came into 
being, much less was sustained for as long as it was. The answer, 
unfortunately, is that most of Germany, for a whole host of reasons, 
embraced Nazism and the fanaticism that Hitler engendered.
