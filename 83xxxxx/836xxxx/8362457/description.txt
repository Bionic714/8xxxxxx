Subject: great summertime show in KY!

My friends were in Atlanta on Friday , Louisville on Saturday! This show was truly fantastic. I was right and the band was right on. I could not believe the stuff they were doing onstage. Even Jerry was in shorts with some weird little slip on loafers. And let me tell you , the man and the band were on fire here. Jerry was smiling , laughing talking to Brent and just having fun. Ive been to my fair share of shows and something about this one burned into my brain.
