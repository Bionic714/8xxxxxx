West Coast rap kingpin Snoop Dogg has launched his own YouTube news network.

The Doggfather announced the launch of GGN (Double G News Network) in a parody clip on his YouTube channel WestfestTV, appearing as "Nemo Hoes," in a dark suit and an afro wig, alongside spiritual advisor Bishop Don "Magic" Juan, anchorwoman Stormy Fronts and Android Miller aka comedian Andy Milonakis.

Posting new GGN episodes each Tuesday, GGN will cover a range of controversial news topics, like the debut episode's point-counterpoint discussion, "Missionary vs. Doggystyle."

"We go in the depths of the hood," Snoop explains, in the YouTube clip. "You know how Jacques Cousteau used to go underground in the water, like, real heavy? Imagine us going underground in the streets like that. GGN network has now been officially launched."

"I am excited to launch another project for my fans to get up close and personal with me," Snoop Dogg said in a more formal statement. "Being the social media guru that I am, the GGN: Dogg News Network gives me a chance to be innovative and create my own original programming."
