[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-12T00:40Z,"you're both welcome and nerdygeek, if you didn't see them already, look at the marvel fanfare torrent for the links to uncanny x-men vol. 1!

also i forgot to mention, this torrent was actually posted by someone else on torrage about 6 months ago. however, it was unfortunately missing 2 issues. so i grabbed those, put it all back together and here you have it! complete is one of my favorite words (although technically you may need http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/4964562/ to use it)!"
,ggaanneesshhaa,2013-04-18T02:31Z,"Dear Sir,

I'm one of your thousands of silent followers here in the Pirate Bay and once I found out your impressive ability to attend obscure requests (X-Men Forever Vol. 1 and Vol. 2, for example) I finally took the time to register only to ask you for a favor. 

You see, I'm a fan of the X-Men comics, particularly those of the Claremont-Byrne era, so, I'd like to ask you to upload the Classic X-Men issues (#01-#110) or at least the X-Men Vignettes Vols. (#01 and #02).

What I like most of this series (excluding the original stories) is the art of John Bolton illustrating the usually mesmerizing backup stories written by Chris Claremont himself. 

I know Claremont did stopped to write those stories after a while, but these first ones alone have blown my mind when I first read them. And i recall there were a few sketches and wonderful Arthur Adams and Steve Lightle covers and pinups included that I'm sure it would also be a dream come true to many people around the world downloading all those 110 issues, particularly if scanned in good quality.

So, if by any chance I failed in making myself clear, since english is not my first (nor second) language, here are a few links to help you understand what I'm looking for:

Classic X-Men:

X-Men: Vignettes, Vol. 1 [Paperback]

X-Men: Vignettes, Vol. 2 [Paperback]
http://www.amazon.com/X-Men-Vignettes-Vol-Chris-Claremont/dp/0785117288

Thank you very much for your time and dedication sharing all those comics.

Excelsior!"
