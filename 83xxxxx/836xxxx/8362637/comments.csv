,aric420,2013-04-12T00:39Z,ty for the up this is prob the best quality so far you did good work on the cam that everyone else cant seem to get right a/6 v/7
,Quixane,2013-04-12T05:13Z,Thanks so much for the upload!  Will rate it after I watch :)
,Quixane,2013-04-12T05:25Z,Just flipped through it quickly.  Totally watchable on my TV A6 V6.  Thanks again.
,doomslayermax,2013-04-12T08:34Z,"Thank you anyway but this isnt watchable , due to the camera angle kept moving around"
,shea1969,2013-04-12T09:59Z,Where are the people that actually do good cam work??  I used to get great cam torrents all the time.  Now it is mostly shit cam torrents like all the time.  Too bad no one takes pride in it anymore.  I am going to try this copy.  I hope it is better than some of the others but I'm not holding my breath.
,Stinnett,2013-04-12T11:44Z,"V/4.5
A/3"
,n171717,2013-04-12T18:27Z,"A:3
V:3

Same as the FOX rip, just enhanced ever so slightly.  Thank you uploader for the effort, but this is still totally unwatchable.  "
,cricket01,2013-04-13T03:57Z,I've seen worse... Not bad at all. watchable if you can't wait for anything better. thanks for the upload. a/7 v/7 for a cam.
,ludomancer,2013-04-18T10:08Z,Are there any rips of this that don't seem to have chunks cut out?  I dont even care about the quality so much as missing chunks.
,Cecil366,2013-04-19T23:12Z,"The quality isn't bad, but there is 7 or 8 minutes of footage missing. That's reason enough to wait for a proper rip. Saw this in theaters last night and it was good, don't waste your time with this shit cam."
,Cecil366,2013-04-19T23:15Z,"The quality isn't too bad, but there are 7 or 8 minutes missing. Wait for a screener, a proper rip, or just buy the Blu Ray.

And for the record, ALL CAM RIPS OF EVIL DEAD ARE LIKE THIS."
,daemon150,2013-04-20T04:45Z,"Thanx alot Pimp! I loved the OG Evil Dead, we'll see how this 1 compares. ;) The lines here are crap (stuck on DLS w/ a 2-wire 'POTS' outlet), and need to rewire, but Will try to re-seed when I possibly can..."
,K1bbler,2013-04-22T10:10Z,All the cam rips are the same because everyone is using the same source. You think all these guys are going out and filming this on their own. These geniuses are re-posting the same crap and diluting the seeder pool ensuring it takes longer to download.
,arcangel757,2013-04-24T05:56Z,im new on this pimp  but i wanted 2 know is this a good copy
,bellissima187,2013-05-21T06:11Z,Thanks pimp!!
,AxDeath,2013-05-23T06:28Z,"45 minutes in, source switches, rest of movie, complete bullshit. unwatchable."
