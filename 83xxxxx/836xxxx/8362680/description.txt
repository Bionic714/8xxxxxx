This is a direct rip of the episode as recorded from 4HD by a Freesat box.

Encoded with Handbrake (High Profile @ 3000kb/s), with MKV Merge to remux.

Original 1080i50 broadcast converted to 1080p25, original AC3 stereo audio.

About as close as you'll get to broadcast quality without the original TS file!

(It's a little later than usual because the first attempt at encoding ended with a corrupt video, had to start again from scratch.)
