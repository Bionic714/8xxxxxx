,SC2Superbibi,2013-04-11T11:18Z,There is a Quizz on GomTV homepage right now that gives you a 3-day ticket to watch all SC2 leagues on their site. Just register an account and answer 'WCS' to the quizz.
,SC2Superbibi,2013-04-11T11:21Z,"The 3-day ticket gives you access to the live stream too, watching in EHQ right now."

And thanks for the info on the quiz @ gomtv"
,athhcarl,2013-04-12T06:36Z,"And disregard my previous comment about GSL's part of WCS, WCS Korea is being seeded from GSL Code S, so it's one in the same. "
