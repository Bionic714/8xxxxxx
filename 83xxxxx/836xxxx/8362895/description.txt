As hypnotist Maya Anderson, itΓÇÖs up to you to figure out the mysterious circumstances, behind a doctorΓÇÖs disappearance from a psychiatric clinic. The police have requested your help in the investigation. The patients are behaving oddly when you arrive at the scene. As an experienced hypnotist, you sedate them and travel into their psyches to help them neutralize phobias and obsessions.

All of the characters are exceptionally brilliant: a painter, a musician, a scientist, a businessman, and others, each with their own bright mind, full of surprises and puzzles. In the psyches of the patients youΓÇÖll be attacked by their phobias, with which you battle in mini-games that serve as pleasant deviations from the main adventure.

Unique features:
- a consciousness expanding plot
- impressive graphics and special effects
- uncommonly charismatic personalities
- simple, yet deep gameplay.
-adventure /puzzle (same genre as nancy drew)

In the course of the game the doctor realizes that this case isnΓÇÖt merely about the disappearance of one man, but a catastrophe of epic proportions, and that she wonΓÇÖt be able to deal with without first facing her own subconscious.
