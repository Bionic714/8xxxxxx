[T],480v,2013-04-11T12:50Z,Download Hartmann if you're looking for anything on Obama's Chained CPI proposal. Randi will not mention it all. Guess what the topic is instead. Gun control....again.. ugh
[V],TheExecutive,2013-04-11T15:33Z,"Randi spends WAY too much time on gun control.
1 hour a few times a week would be fine but entire shows several days in a row is OVERKILL (pardon the pun).

Sure would like to know what Ed Schultz is talking about on his show these days..."
[V],TheExecutive,2013-04-11T15:37Z,"I think Randi isn't talking about Chained CPI
because she knows it won't pass in the House.
Not because the Republicans care about raiding Social Security over the course of the next several years, but because the bill requires something they simply don't want :  tax cuts.   

So much for ""grand"" bargains."
[V],TheExecutive,2013-04-11T16:25Z,"480v, could you or someone please seed this and Tom's show ?  I'm not getting any bandwidth this morning."
[V],TheExecutive,2013-04-11T18:34Z,"If I haven't posted enough here already, can somebody please seed today's Thom Hartmann Program ?

[T],480v,2013-04-11T23:49Z,"I understand but I'm sure her listeners are a little more concerned with Obama than what the repubs will or won't do. Repubs are slime...nothing we can do about it. the issue is Obama right now and to be honest, I've had it with him. And Randi for dodging the issue. We all know Randi has a serious crush on Obama, but this infatuation has really affected her better judgement."
[T],480v,2013-04-11T23:58Z,"Using SS, Medicare & Medicaid is a dangerous and dumb strategy. Bluffing or otherwise. Pass or not. It should never be mentioned at all. "
[V],TheExecutive,2013-04-12T02:39Z,"I don't completely disagree on that.

Maybe it would have been better if there was no ""Grand Bargain"" with the RepubliCONS because they won't give anything up -- least of all taxes or subsidies."
[V],TheExecutive,2013-04-12T04:28Z,"Ooops.... typo in my earlier post. 
The Republicans simply don't want tax INCREASES on the rich.  They're all about tax cuts. Ha ha."
