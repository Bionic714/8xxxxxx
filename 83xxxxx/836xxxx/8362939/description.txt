This is a set of tools and functions for managing licensing, deploying, and activating Microsoft Office and Windows. All output from these functions is displayed in the Information Console. All functions are run in the background and the GUI is disabled to prevent running multiple functions, as they could conflict or cause damage if run concurrently. The Microsoft Office Setup Customization Functions (Customize Setup Tab), AutoKMS Uninstaller (if AutoKMS is installed), AutoRearm Uninstaller (if AutoRearm is installed), Office Uninstaller and Product Key Checker work even if Microsoft Office or Windows is not installed/supported. For information about individual functions, read further.

Requirements:
Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0 or 4.5 (Not 3.5)
Microsoft Office 2010 or Later for Office Toolkit Support
Windows Vista or Later for Windows Toolkit Support

Microsoft Toolkit FAQ

My AV/Firewall Detected a Virus when activating.:
Most major AVΓÇÖs have decided to flag KMSEmulator as a virus/hack tool, because it can be used for piracy and many AVΓÇÖs flag cracks. The file is completely safe but you must add it to your AV exclusions for proper use of KMS activation.
So add AutoKMS's (%WINDIR%AutoKMSAutoKMS.exe), KMS Server Services's (%WINDIR%KMSServerServiceKMS Server Service.exe), and KMSEmulator's (%WINDIR%Microsoft.NETFrameworkv2.0.50727vbc.e xe) path to AV/Firewall exclusions.

Can I really trust these files?:
They are confirmed safe by MDL community and our reputations would be damaged if we were trying to infect you, but if you still donΓÇÖt trust the files donΓÇÖt use KMS activation. You can use AutoRearm to keep Microsoft Office in grace period forever without any AV Configuration/False Positive hassles.

I tried to activate via KMS and it failed.:
First be 100% sure your AV and any security products (including built in Windows Products) are not interfering.
In any other case, please post to the forum with the output when you attempted activation.

Microsoft Office licensing is shot/Setup window shows on start of Office/I get red bar and nag.:
If your Microsoft Office licensing gets damaged or marked as tampered, Microsoft Office will try to repair itself and when it does you will be in Notifications Mode (with 0 rearms). The only way to resolve this is to activate Microsoft Office successfully (YouΓÇÖll have to use KMS due to lack of MAK/Retail keys). If you successfully activate youΓÇÖll be activated with 5 rearms.
