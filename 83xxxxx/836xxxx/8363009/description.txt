Randy Weston - 1956 - With These Hands (1996)

This session could be subtitled "The Boys from Brooklyn," for Weston and featured guest Cecil Payne were childhood buddies in the New York borough that also prepared Duke Jordan and Max Roach for important contributions to modern music in the same period. Weston and Payne work together here like the longtime friends that they were and remain, sharing ensemble leads and solo space in a most imaginative way. This album was an important recital for the then-neglected baritone saxophonist, who like Weston has become one of jazz's living legends and most consistent performers. While the program is unusual in Weston's discography for its emphasis on standards, the pianist also contributed two originals, including the debut recording of his classic waltz "Little Niles."
