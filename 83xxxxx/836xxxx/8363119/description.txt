Horizon: Volcano Hell
In 1985 a volcanic eruption in Colombia killed 20,000 people asleep in the town below, leaving the scientific community horrified that they were unable to avert this tragedy by foreseeing extreme volcanic activity in the region. This programme follows the subsequent quest of two researchers to find a method of prediction, and reveals how years later, when they thought they had achieved their goal, they clashed over one volcano, leading to the shattering of reputations, but also the solution to the future.
