About the Game
Shipwrecked on a tropical island, you must use your wits and the natural environment to survive, craft, explore - and eventually, find your way home. Under the Ocean is currently in early alpha.

Craft

Under the Ocean features a flexible, physics based crafting system. Hundreds of items interact in strange and unexpected ways. Attach a sharp rock to the end of some driftwood to make a spear. Then a glow worm for lighting, or dip the tip in poison berries - or both! Build traps to ensnare prey, windmills to generate power, a lakeside cabin, and eventually, a raft to make your way home.

Explore

Islands in Under the Ocean are randomly generated, giving you a new experience each time you travel. Elements mix and match in interesting ways. If you're on a boar infested island, you'd better have washed up armed! Islands can have different size, shape, terrain, lighting, weather, starting equipment, tools, weapons, animals, plants, backstories, hazards and more.
