Complete unreleased second album!!! Beautifull magical psychedelic folkrock. Originally recorded in 1971, but unreleased for over 20 years, this was the second album's worth of material from the English folk rock trio. All original material, this is a fine showcase for a largely forgotten band of mystic troubadours...
