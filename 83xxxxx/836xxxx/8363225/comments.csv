HI dalesteyn as you see realy dad quality, really bad and if i try to encode them it's going to be worse, that's the reason many ""popular"" encoders Choose their rips .
if y want to contact me try in (extra torrent or kissass torrent) 
 search for tomcat12 "
,dalesteyn,2013-04-15T05:45Z,"first of all thnx for the reply...really appreciate it..and yes they are indeed pretty bad quality for the file size...thnx for the info,atleast now i know the reason :D....will contact you friend..."
