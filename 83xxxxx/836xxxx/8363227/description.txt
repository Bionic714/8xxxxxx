Notes :
As there is no better source available yet, I decided finally to share it on RT.
Quality is not that bad if you consider the chatty crowd around (volume sound level was very low, many chatty chatty mouths).
It was a regret not seeing them in a jazz club with better acoustic set.
By the way, it was a very good groovy set (even shy to start), and a pleasure seing and listening to these great artists.
For Fans only.
Hope you will enjoy !
Recorder was just in front of the soundboard table.
