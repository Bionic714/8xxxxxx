Lloyd Stearman - A Forgotten Aviation Pioneer

The Boeing Stearman is one of aviation's most recognizable and loved aircraft. We summarize the history of The Stearman Aircraft Company up to 1933, when Lloyd Stearman left the company. Using historical footage, still photos, restored aircraft filmed air to air and interviews with their owners, we bring this history alive. 
In the Crop Duster section, you will see unbelievable air-to-air footage of the Stearmans dusting and other action from the fifties and the important role that Crop Dusters played in saving these aircraft for future generations. 
It concludes with the National Stearman Fly-In at Galesburg, IL and how much the owners of the Stearmans love these aircraft. 

- "A fast moving joy-filled tribute to the Stearman biplane, the first 25 minutes recount the formative years of the planes inspiration and namesake, Lloyd Stearman. Includes heart stopping aerobatics and lump in the throat air-to-air photography. A joy-filled delight from start to finish." - Flight Video Review
