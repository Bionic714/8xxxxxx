Cheers mate!

BTW, are you gonna post the Theatrical too?  Is it worth the effort do you think, or is this version better...?

Thanks!"

Both cuts got a couple of different scenes. Some say theatrical is better probably because of the bigger amount of blood lol. I personally wouldn't bother with the other cut once I got this one but it's up to you guys which one you go for. 
Often shorter versions are better with some boring/useless scenes removed. Some longer versions of some movies make (some of) us yawn."
