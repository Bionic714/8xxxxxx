,eirini_c,2013-04-23T23:04Z,"Just a question, apologies in advance if it's silly: are the subs hardcoded? Or one can turn them off and use the English ones instead? Cheers!"

Good video and acceptable sterio audio quality but sadly, the lower screen is obscured by large, white on black, hardcoded Dutch subtitles."

- No English subtitles are included.
- HARD-CODED Dutch (NED) subtitles are included, covering the bottom quarter of the video frame, and cannot be disabled or removed."
