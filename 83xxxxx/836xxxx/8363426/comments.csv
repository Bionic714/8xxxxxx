""This is a Drama with a couple zombies thrown in..""

And  

""About a couple and their martial problems""

No thanks.   To each his own.   But just a heads up out there.   =)   

Hey on the other hand.  It might be the first movie about zombies your girlfriend will like watching with you?  Who knows... "
