Request time, though:  I cannot find a seeded version of Image's The Infinite Horizon, written by Gerry Duggan (of Deadpool with Brian Posehn). Individual issues or the trade, either way.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-11T18:49Z,"you're welcome Nightwing1945.

hopefully i can locate that series. i've found an old torrent that should have the first 4 issues... if it's still seeded by anyone... will look for the others, and try to torrent it before the weekend, if possible. will be AFK the rest of today though!

if anyone else reads this who has it, c'mon, help a Bat-family member out!"
,ana9820,2013-04-11T19:02Z,Yay! Thank you so much:)
,KoldPT,2013-04-11T21:14Z,"Hey STFMaryville, could you upload Glory #34? I think http://comicsall.org/image-comics/4541-glory-34-2013.html has it, and it was out one week ago."
,KoldPT,2013-04-11T21:31Z,"or a batch torrent, I guess :P"
,tdurden83,2013-04-11T22:02Z,"thx as always STF. can u plz give me a suggestion on where I can turn to for my comic torrent needs should the unthinkable happen? im still fairly new to this and tpb is all I know, so I thought i'd ask for a plan b while I have a chance. this site is a beacon for the freedom of information, so I hope I never need to use it"

[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-12T00:24Z,"ana9820, you're welcome.

KoldPT, i already did my friend, it's in http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8345063/IMAGE_COMICS_WEEK_OF_2013.04.03"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-12T00:30Z,"tdurden83, it's hard to share links in comments, but i'm sure you can figure out the urls: for comic torrents check out h33t dot com or i-s-o-h-u-n-t dot com.

a few of my favorite links for new comics on wednesday are http://bolt.cd/board/f234/  and http://rapidbelgrade.com/index.php?topic=80918.new  and magazine3k dot com

hope this helps."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-12T00:34Z,"phineus, thanks a lot! degu2012, it is very cool."
,tdurden83,2013-04-12T00:54Z,much appreciated STF!!
[T],MelloYello,2013-04-12T05:01Z,"Thanks for this.  I went to the closest comic shop which is about 30 miles from my house.  The shop is a small one so he seems to get shorted a lot on his orders on Wednesday so he has to wait on his re-orders for Friday to come in. So I wasn't able to get Avengers Assemble #14, Age of Ultron #5 or Ultron #1.(I'll still buy them later)  Thanks a lot. Now I don't have to wait to read them."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-12T15:06Z,"tdurden83, you're welcome.

MelloYello, sorry to hear that about your LCS. mine often has trouble with diamond. in my opinion, distribution (customer service, at least) was much better before capital city folded, during the marvel/heroes world bullshit and the monopolization by diamond. glad you got to read these, in any event. i felt like this one is the best AU issue they've had."
,Nightwing1945,2013-04-12T18:35Z,"I leave for 1 day, and come back to such camaraderie and goodness!  Awesome, thanks STF for all that you do, now I have a few extra places to look for issues.  And a special thanks to phineus, who was able to fulfill my Infinite Horizon request so speedily, so thank you very much!"
,Nightwing1945,2013-04-12T18:37Z,"...And I should say, I heartily re-endorse Magazine 3K, much comic nerd glee with fast, fast links."
