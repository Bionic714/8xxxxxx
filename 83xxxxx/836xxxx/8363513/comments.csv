,Crazy_Joe,2013-04-16T05:11Z,"This is common with windows 8 nothing to do with the flash drive method it would do the same with a Retail DVD install.  Windows 8 does not have the sata drivers for some mother boards you need to install from windows 7 then delete the windows.old folder.

Or find the sata drivers.  you can use windows 7 drivers in most cases put it on the usb drive and point to the inf file"

,Crazy_Joe,2013-04-25T06:13Z,"Prince, the usb tool will format it correctly .

no worry's

If you just want XP you don't need all of this, but if you want you can copy the xp iso from the disk and the yummi program under software/tools on your desktop then format the disk and run yumi then select xp and the xpsp3.iso image file it will then create a disk with just xp on it
