,aoxo,2013-04-12T06:08Z,"Here's a basic security lesson for you all.  Don't download something from an unknown third party when you can just as easily get it from the legitimate source for no cost.  That's not to say that this is infected with something, but that it could be.  It's even more suspicious to me considering the motivation of the uploader to put it here is in question.

Before you download any program using torrents...have a quick check on google to see if it's already 100% free.

If a stranger on the street walks up to you and offers you a corndog, and says he got it from the corndog stand 2 yards away that has a big sign up that says ""free corndogs!""...would you want to eat the one from the stranger or would you go up to the vendor yourself and cut out the middle man who maybe didn't wash his hands?

@aoxo
You Buy From Manufacturer or You Buy from Retailer it will not effect till the taste, packing , shape, expiring date,etc. are same. Similarly, You Download from  Official Site or You Download from Torrent Site it will not effect till the Hashsum of the Official Installer are Same!!

Secondly, there are many new downloaders who are sometimes not aware that a particular free software exists. Such persons are not only educated through uploads of ""Free"" software but it also an compliment to the manufacturer and coder of such softwares.

So, if you feel insecure, nobody's forcing you into downloading anything ^_^"
