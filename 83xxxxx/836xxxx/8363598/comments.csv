,jaycesixx,2013-04-14T03:27Z,"HELP lol   k trying to follow the instructions for putting game to ENGLISH. however when i try to start game it no longer loads. I put everything back to the way it was and it works but still in russian. I must have followed the instructions incorrectly.  After renaming the two files, where do I put them? I put the TXD folder in game directory. I assume thats where Im to put it. Ive also downloaded the gta-vc.exe file. So can anyone please tell me exactly how to go about getting the english to work in the game? Thank u"
