,ROCKnTIME,2013-04-12T22:29Z,Thanks.. Works great.. 
,yorch,2013-04-14T00:18Z,"After installation and reboot I start the app, says it needs to download something, it jumps from 1% directly to 92% and then does nothing. If I disable the wi-fi the program immediatly asks for retry or cancel,  so I know it isnt stuck. I have waited for as long as 30 minutes. Any ideas what im doing wrong?"
,yorch,2013-04-14T00:25Z,"Never mind. I guess i just needed to wait a little longer. The app works great in my Asus TF700. Just be patient while updating. Maps are huge, thats why it takes a while to update. Thank you for sharing this."
,bigcid10,2013-04-20T02:44Z,is this Spanish or English?
,Pyr0TeK,2013-05-07T17:11Z,Yeah... Spanish or English? I am hoping ENGLISH since it is US and Canada. Wouldn't really make since the have it Spanish since our native language is English (well... used to be I guess).
