Dex is a nerdy scientist. Sid is an angry punk rock idiot. Ray is an alcoholic with anger management issues. And Jacob is a crazy person who thinks he's a safari hunter. Together, these four hacks are forced to team up to save the world...while hating themselves and each other.

Gorilla Interrupted was the first major collaboration between the people that would go on to form Red Letter Media. Shot in 2002 and remastered in 2013, this updated version of the rarely-seen film features newly shot special effects and a new score.

Included with the movie is the retrospective documentary "How Not to Make a Movie," which chronicles how these guys all met and started making movies together, the disasterous production of Gorilla Interrupted, and how the new effects and remastering were accomplished.
