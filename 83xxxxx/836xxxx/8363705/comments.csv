,moyrtzoyflis,2013-04-12T00:50Z,"Dear CODYBOSS1969,
Thanks for the upload.I wanted to ask though:Did you give up on uploading the movies in both qualities(xvid 480p-mp3 audio and HD)?Are your uploads from now on are gonna be all in HD?I don't know about other people but I would still like to have a choice.Also for one reason or the other most people that I know watch their movies in stand alone DVD players and not on their computers.So please think about it.Thanks again for all your uploads."
