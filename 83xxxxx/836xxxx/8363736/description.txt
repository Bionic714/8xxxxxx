From Library Journal
The essays in this third volume of mathematical mini-essays by the author of The Joy of Mathematics (Wide World Pub./Tetra, 1989) and More Joy of Mathematics (Wide World Pub./Tetra, 1991) are for the general reader, requiring little mathematical background. They range broadly over mathematical themes in art, architecture, music, games, and everyday technology, encompassing history, new discoveries, applications, and recreations. Though the choice of subjects is haphazard, and each essay barely skims the surface, the book is fun to browse. Ideas are tossed out and discussed one after another with just enough details to keep things interesting. There are many illustrations and few equations. Thought-provoking yet not overwhelming, this book makes the author's pleasure in mathematics evident. Recommended for young adults and older.
