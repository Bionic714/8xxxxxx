,Dargonplay,2013-04-26T17:49Z,"Bioshock.exe stopped working.

There's something I can do to fix it?"
,cc178700,2013-04-28T15:49Z,"I get the following error when trying to install:

CRC failed in BioShockBuildsReleaseBioshock.exe
CRC failed in BioShockContentBulkContent5-hephaestusLevel.blk

When I try opening the game from the desktop shortcut, as instructed, the system can't find Bioshock.exe.  I have Win 7 x 64 and have never had a problem with any other installs.  I've checked google and crc files don't seem to be ""universally repairable"".  Any help is appreciated!"
,nosTEAM,2013-05-03T14:50Z,"@ cc178700 :

Stop torrent ,Force Re-Check files ,Start torrent ,when is done 100% reinstall game - install update patch - play game . 
Some seeders sent to you damaged files."
,bronsongotn,2013-05-04T19:53Z,It's not working for me...win7 64bit...
,tikitroll,2013-05-07T00:19Z,"Maximum resolution the game can handle is 1600x900, if you have any problems, just lower the resolution.
Other then that it works fine."
,FlyinCoco,2013-05-10T12:55Z,"Great release, BioShock is such a unique game and i fuking love it. Couldnt imagine how bioshock infinite can do it better."
,youcifer,2013-05-11T00:26Z,Still better than Infinite. RAPTURE FOREVER! 
,Dominoblu,2013-05-19T18:40Z,"Hi, i have no sound after the game start, i can hear the ""my parents told i will do great things"" blah blah blah but after he fall into the water i hear nothing. please help."
,HelSpecial,2013-05-19T20:33Z,"I dont got sound after he says ``my parents told blah blah´´, but i've got sound in the starting menu... Help?!"
,Beakerbee,2013-05-19T22:30Z,"I'm not getting any audio in-game. The beginning movie works just fine, but then once I'm in the water, it mutes the game. I checked my settings and everything...not sure what to do."
,Beakerbee,2013-05-19T22:38Z,Need audio fix pleaseeee! Game runs fine besides no audio...
,PSyCHoHaM,2013-05-25T10:25Z,"FOR THE SOUND ISSUE! I found that playing the game in Windows XP compatibility mode fixed the sound issue. Though all in all this game still seems buggy, crashes etc."
,Frutson,2013-05-26T17:09Z,"Seed, please."
,pravilaudavila,2013-05-28T13:33Z,i dont know bout you but i played it 30 min and i have no sound problems on windows 7 
,likeitis69,2013-06-01T20:49Z,Great release. Working perfectly here w/XP.. stereo or surround.. Looks even better with antialiasing - can apply AA in the nVidia Control Panel
,jc305,2013-06-02T19:45Z,had stop working issue and sound issue with windows 7 64 bit fixed by installing in programs 86 in local disk then changing compatibility to windows 7. the sound issue open the recording devices on volume control show disabled devices enable stereo mix for any other questions jcaldwell10@yahoo.com
,jc305,2013-06-06T04:17Z,great game just finished it for the first time only ting you have to jump through a few hoops to get it to work and see to differ from person to person on how they got it to work. my friend downloaded and installed with no issues at all and we are both running same setup. if nothing on here works go to nosteams web site for other thingsthat worked for others.
,polybass,2013-06-08T00:06Z,"I'm running Win7 x64, and at first the game wouldn't run at all. I put it in ""Win 7"" compatibility mode and the game started, but I didn't get any sound.

The answer for me was to switch to Win XP SP2 compatibility. Game runs great!"
,polybass,2013-06-08T00:12Z,"Another issue I found a fix for: I couldn't change the resolution. Whenever I'd hit apply, the game would crash. The answer is to add "" -dx9"" (without quotes) to a shortcut to the bioshock.exe file, at the end of the target box in the properties of the shortcut."
