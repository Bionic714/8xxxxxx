,U-235,2013-04-12T06:55Z,"Thank you lolzob for this release, hope it's the same quality as the previous one. :)

1 seeder and 111 leechers, I guess that explains why I'm downloading 1 kB/s and seeding 1300 kB/s. Oh right, it's the hit & run bay. Seed, people..."
,lolzob,2013-04-12T10:18Z,"Is very good and expected to confirm after you testing this windows!
This release is the same as Windows 7 SP1 x64 All in One has integrated all updates for: Windows 7 HomeBasic, HomePremium, Professional, Ultimate.
Normal to download 1 kb/s for are the only seeder"
,RenanRischiotto,2013-04-12T11:13Z,"How so includes other Windows 7 updates (Home Basic, Home Premium, Professional and Ultimate)?

Sry for bad english, using google tradutor =)"
,lolzob,2013-04-12T12:39Z,"I do not understand RenanRischiotto !!!

In the original Windows 7, that you find (download) yourself at Microsoft, Windows 7 Ultimate are included HomeBasic, HomePremium, Professional and Ultimate.
You can install the version you want!
I added offline only updates and I tested Windows to virtual machine to see if updates are integrated."
,U-235,2013-04-12T14:19Z,"@RenanRischiotto: When you boot from DVD with this Windows you could choose which version you want, because this one contains Home Basic, Home Premium, Professional and Ultimate. Just pick the one that suits your taste. Those are all 64-bit of course, but there is a 32-bit version also. Just google 64 & 32-bit and you will probably find what version suits you the best. If you have a 64-bit CPU the 64-bit version of Windows (this one) is probably the one you would prefer since it can address more memory and therefore better performance."
,RenanRischiotto,2013-04-12T16:47Z,Ok thanks =)
[T],prodallasosoft,2013-04-12T23:33Z,"Thanks for the up,didnt know there was loader also. iso looks clean to me."
,lamportyx,2013-04-13T00:47Z,go to filehippo.com if you need .net framework 4.5
,lamportyx,2013-04-13T00:56Z,"for those who does not know what is 32 and 64 bit

Windows 7 32 bit = 3.75 gb to 4 gb of RAM limitattions..

Windows 7 64 bit = 4 gb to 12 gb of RAM and depends on your motherboard configuration.and your  CPU (processor) must be 64 bit capable usually dual core and quadcore.(core i3. i5, i7)
1st gen,2nd gen, and the newer 3rd gen. if you are using one these processor better to use  64 bit to have optimal performance!"
,lolzob,2013-04-13T09:42Z,"Test and the new Windows 8 Pro, uploaded by me !!!"
,U-235,2013-04-14T09:09Z,"Now I've uploaded 113 GB of this release, so now others have to take over the seeding. :)"

,U-235,2013-05-02T16:58Z,@lolzob: Will there be a May 2013 release of this or will you wait until june or later? Just curious. :)
,Daveg,2013-05-10T21:58Z,incluye la versión en Español. avisar por favor.
,U-235,2013-05-11T02:46Z,"@Daveg:

En Windows 7 Ultimate se puede instalar un ""paquete de idioma"" a través de Windows Update, por lo que no es necesario una versión española.

(In Windows 7 Ultimate you could install a ""language pack"" through Windows Update, so you shouldn't need a spanish version)"
,lolzob,2013-05-23T16:42Z,"@U-235
Now is the release of May 2013! :)"
