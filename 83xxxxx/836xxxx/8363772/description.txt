Bradley and Kayla.
Series in which young drivers take to the road in the family car, unaware that their parents are watching every manoeuvre through state-of-the-art cameras placed in the cars. Jack-the-lad Bradley's fantasy life of going to casinos and lying to girls that he's a professional footballer don't quite match the reality of an 18-year-old going to college. Living his life in the fast lane continues behind the wheel, much to the annoyance of his dad Chris. Kayla's classic role as a daddy's girl means she can get away with murder - which is almost what happens when she holds a house party. But it's her skills behind the wheel that her driving instructor dad really has trouble with. With bickering, brawls and one of them even being over the legal limit the next morning, do either of these two barely legal drivers deserve their own car or should they go back to driving school?
