THOSE CLUELESS TO THE PLANETARY EMERGENCY OF IMPENDING ECOCIDE SHOULD GO ELSEWHERE.  These uploads were created for me, to equip me to Wage All-out Unviolent War for my current and future 204 billion children.  If you are looking for style over substance this site and these materials are not for you.  THE PRESENT AND FUTURE KIDS ARE SCREAMING AT US TO SAVE THEIR FUTURE, not whether there are typos, hugely rough parts, audio artifacts, pauses, footnote numbers, etc.  HAVE THE DECENCY NOT TO COMPLAIN.


ALSO, CUT ME SOME SLICK.  THIS UPLOAD WAS PREPARED ON 04.11.13, THIS DAY 14 OF MY 'ECOCIDE'S DEATH FAST, ZERO CALORIES,' RACING TO FINISH THIS PROJECT SO I CAN ABSTAIN FROM LIQUIDS AS WELL BY MIDNIGHHT SUNDAY NIGHT. GOOGLE 'start loving.' Also GOOGLE, 'tracking plan b'  So, I'm working with a 23,400 calorie deficit, and a sleep deficit the last 4 days of near 8 hrs x 4 = 32 hours, so I can get this done, before I am.  (Hmmm, you too are this committed to averting ecocide so out kids and grandkids have a Life, like you and I did, right?)


WITHIN WEEKS I'LL BE GONE.  FOR CREATION'S SAKE, SEED THESE.  KEEP EVERY ONE, ESPECIALLY THE WEAKEST, ALIVE WHILE I'M GONE.  OK? STARTING NOW?

OH! A final note.  This project, on now a 4 day near zero sleep sprint, may be A. one of the wonders of human endurance, or B. full of technical disasters, errors....  I've devoted my life to have it be the former.  If it is the latter, ROFL, I WON'T BE AROUND FOR YOU TO WHINE AT, RIDICULE, BLAME!!!!  FIX IT, BUILD ON IT. DO YOUR PART!  UnviolentPeacemaker

From the Preface - 

Untold numbers of people believe that what they understand by ΓÇ£DarwinismΓÇ¥ has been scientifically demonstrated and is fully supported by the majority of contemporary scientists. ΓÇ£Darwinism,ΓÇ¥ to most persons in the Western world today, usually connotes ΓÇ£the struggle for existence,ΓÇ¥ ΓÇ£the survival of the fittest,ΓÇ¥ ΓÇ£nature, red in tooth and claw,ΓÇ¥ ΓÇ£the strongest survive, the weakest go to the wall,ΓÇ¥ ΓÇ£eat or be eaten,ΓÇ¥ ΓÇ£dog eat dog,ΓÇ¥ ΓÇ£competition,ΓÇ¥ and similar notions, all of them endowed with a content of combativenessΓÇöand all of them unsound.

The layman is not to be blamed for holding ideas that were largely conveyed to him, either directly or indirectly, by scientists who were themselves addicted to these erroneous ideas. The biologists of the nineteenth century, and many of their leading interpreters, were largely responsible for the spread of these erroneous notions, while, paradoxically enough,
they were at the same time making the basic facts available upon which a sound theory of evolution could be developed. Unfortunately, what was sound and what was unsound in the theory of evolution became inextricably mixed for most people, and they either accepted the mixture or wholly rejected it....
