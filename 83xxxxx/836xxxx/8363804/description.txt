Cougar Town focuses on a newly single 40-year-old mom Jules Cobb (Courteney Cox) and her teenage son (Dan Byrd). In a small town of Florida, the most important thing is the Cougars high shool football team, which is very appropriate since there are tons of divorcees prowling in the area looking for young men. Jules doesn't want to be one of them, but after an ugly divorce and her 40, she desperately wants more action in her life. Encouraged by her best friend Elle and her assistant Laurie, Jules tries to enter back into the dating scene. To her surprise she meets Bobby a very young nice guy, as he discovers that she still has what it takes.
