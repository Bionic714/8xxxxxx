FAQ

Will be able to updates my malwarebytes suite after activating??
A:Yes you can updates the database but not the version

Hey I will not call you cyclonoid you are an psycho where is the keygen??
A:Umm -_- actually if you have any antivirus-suite preinstalled it will remove the "woot" keygen and mark it as Trojan.Gen.2 because of its false positive effect. Believe me i have installed it on my own pc by disabling my norton suite.
