,crumrugin,2013-04-11T23:57Z,Gleaned the info that states (infers) it is a re-encode of the fox spam cam
,michaelrwatson,2013-04-12T02:28Z,"Wow, so so many fuckin retards re-encoding that FOX crap cam. 

Note that this is not only WATERMARKED but also CROPPED. But thanks for at least including a sample, mate. I recommend people download that *before* downloading the whole AVI."
,Anarchemist,2013-04-12T09:42Z,"Fox should do the right thing and just reupload the movie without his fucking name plastered all over the fucking screen. Either reupload Fox, or kill yourself. I personally vote for you killing yourself, but before you do.. Turn on your webcam and record yourself on Skype while putting a shotgun in your mouth and painting your walls with your retarded brain matter.."
,Bring_Back_Demonoid,2013-04-12T10:59Z,"Why risk filming and distributing this if you are going to ruin it with your advertisements all over the screen? 

That's like robbing a bank so I can have paper to wipe my ass with.  "
,sackese,2013-04-12T23:08Z,"Can somebody please kill this motherfucker cildmolester ""foximagine""? That will improve the gene pool definitelly!"
,crazyoliv,2013-04-13T03:53Z,"It's slighty cropped - unsignificant seriously. A/V are pretty good for a cam. English-speaking. No watermark. No arabish hard subs. No autofocus gone mad. No color-autobalance gone mad. Just a script the size of double-size subtitle with bacon writen in the top-left end side or in the middle from time to time doing self-propaganda for skype-Foximagine. VERY Recomendable. 
You geeko, may know that watermark only exist on protected DVD. It is non-sense with a cam. They invented something called Technology. Ring a bell?

For those complaining like taliban reading a hustler... Try Prozac if dick-less girlfriend doesn't make it first. 

The movie seems pretty boring by the way... we'll see.

Thank you xxxlavalxxx and original uploader Foximagine"
,crazyoliv,2013-04-13T03:58Z,"Sorry, There is arabish subs when Cruise reads poetry... "
,crazyoliv,2013-04-13T07:27Z,VERY BORING... The movie sucks... sorry to spoil what's left to spoil...
,CarolR,2013-04-13T19:23Z,There's now a decent Brazillian cam out there. Someone will be kind enough within the next couple of days to take the English audio from this and add it to the vid from Brazil. The only good thing Fox did was give us a source for a decent English audio.
,sanislo,2013-04-13T21:09Z,"Don't be noobs, this all new watermark thing is a new way to trick people. You get pissed off and contact the uploader on skype giving your identity (and IP) away willingly.
Fox, you're a lame."
,rzaba,2013-04-14T09:16Z,"All of CAM rips with size of
1.47 (.801+.701)
1.1 (1.05)
.876.39
.785
ARE THE SAME copy!
(I've checked most of them - see scene at 0:1:08 - when Tom get up - cam shaking)
All the same crappy but watchable.
So... beter chose the smallest one."
,amine1,2013-04-14T20:34Z,Tom Cruise rocks in this movie..for me finally perfect SF but i saw it in better quality then here at 021.su/dvdrip
,awyeahh1,2013-04-20T00:45Z,foximagine should be tracked down and shot in the face asap.
,QualiMAXX,2013-05-31T17:06Z,"Guys can some one tell me how to upload movies? I have some that I want to upload, just don't know how to. "
