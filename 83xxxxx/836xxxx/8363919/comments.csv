Please post 75767 version.

In your Steam library, right click on Don't Starve and select Properties
Click on the Betas tab
From the dropdown, select the ""adventuretesting"" branch
type ADVENTUREMODE in the password box and press the ""Check Password"" button. (DON'T PRESS ENTER! IT WILL CLOSE THE WINDOW)
Steam should now say that you have opted into the beta
Close the dialog, and play the game! Your version number should be 75767"
