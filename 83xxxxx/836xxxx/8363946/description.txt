    On a quiet, tree-lined street, evil has arrived in a most ordinary       
    way, an old television set. It receives a single channel, one that       
    not only shows the same film over and over  a horror film where       
    zombies rise from the grave to kill  but also frees the gnarled,      
    evil monsters.and once out, theyre not going back! They like       
    the real world. Theyve already killed five people and want more       
    bloodand a new family is moving into the neighborhood!
