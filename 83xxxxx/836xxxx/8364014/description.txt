After a decade of playing second fiddle to Superboy in "Superboy and the Legion of Super Heroes", the Legion finally made a grab for the title's marquee when the boy of steel left the 30th Century. In this seminal issue, penned by Gerry Conway and drawn by Joe Staton, Superboy was confronted with a vision of the death of his adoptive parents when he battled with the misguided Rejis Thomak. As he set off for Smallville, Saturn Girl used her telepathic powers to insure that Superboy would stay in the past and therefore never have to confront a similar vision about his parents' fate when he returned to the future.
