* Plot :

Following an alien invasion 60 years earlier which nearly destroyed the Earth, former Marine commander Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) is drone mechanic 49, one of the last few humans stationed on the planet. Jack lives in a tower standing thousands of feet above the Earth where he and his colleague Victoria are part of an operation to clean up the remaining forces of the invasion and extract the planet's remaining resources. Jack and Victoria maintain contact with civilisation via a video link with their commander, Sally, and are due to join the rest of humanity on Saturn's moon Titan in two weeks. Jack suffers from recurring dreams and flashbacks, featuring images of New York before the invasion and an unknown female. Assisting Jack in his cleanup work are weaponised 'drones', sophisticated airborne machines that scour the landscape for, and destroy, alien lifeforms.

Nearing the end of his mission, Jack rescues a female stranger (Olga Kurylenko) from a crashed spaceship. She is encased in a sleeping capsule, in a state of hibernation, but Jack immediately recognises her as the woman in his flashbacks. Shortly after, Jack and the stranger are captured by an insurgency led by Malcolm Beech (Morgan Freeman). Inside the insurgent stronghold, the insurgents claim there are no aliens on the planet, and demand that he reprogramme a recently captured drone. Meanwhile, Victoria sends a drone to scout the area for Jack, but it is soon disarmed by members of the resistance. Beech allows Jack and the female stranger to venture into an area of the landscape ostensibly unapproachable due to high levels of radiation, advising Jack that it is in this place that he will find answers to his questions.

Jack and the stranger climb the remains of the Empire State Building, and the stranger reveals herself to be his wife, Julia. Despite his initial shock at this revelation, it allows Jack to reconcile his flashbacks, and he knows it to be the truth. It is revealed that the ship in which Julia crash landed was a NASA shuttle that had been orbiting the Earth for 60 years. The duo travel into the supposedly lethal radiation zone, where Jack is stunned to come face to face with drone mechanic 52, a clone of himself. Jack and the clone engage in combat that ends with Jack choking the clone unconscious.

Beech later reveals to Jack that the life form he encountered is only one of thousands of clones, including himself, resulting from cloning the real Jack Harper, who lived 60 years ago. These clones are used to repair drones and scout for 'alien' presence. His colleague Victoria is also revealed to be a clone. The resistance is revealed to be the planet's last remaining human outpost, exposing the truth that Jack and Victoria's superiors, i.e. Sally, are the 'aliens', using the clones to drain the Earth of its vital resources. The drones, it is revealed, are programmed to attack humans, not aliens.

With this in mind, Jack desperately tries to convince Victoria to escape with him and Julia, leading her to report his insubordination to their superiors. Jack is scheduled for termination by Sally, who sends a drone to their location immediately. In the ensuing attack, Victoria is killed by the drone before Julia is able to disable it with a gunshot from Jack's aircraft.
