Chet Baker - 1954 - Jazz At Ann Arbor (2012)

"If people could hear jazz often enough, in person and on records, perhaps more and more of them could begin to accept and understand it." That's the idea Ollie works from; with a three hour record show every night, where he can play just as much jazz as he wishes, and with concerts like the one he recorded, it is inevitable that more people will learn to enjoy music. (from the booklet)

About this release:
In addition to the Ann Arbor concert contained here in its entirety, this release also includes five bonus tracks recorded at The Tiffany Club in L.A. on August 10, 1954. The aforementioned tunes Line for Lyons and My Old Flame are added here as well as Baker's sole recordings of Hanley's Zing Went the Strings of My Heart, Charlie Parker's My Little Suede Shoes, and the debut recording of his celebrated hit Everything Happens to Me by Dennis & Adair!
"I play every set as if it were the final one. It has been like this for years. I don't have too much time left, and it's important to show the musicians I'm playing with -more than anybody else- that I give everything I've got in me. And that I expect them to do the same. "
