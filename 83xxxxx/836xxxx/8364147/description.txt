Ep 6: Godzilla Rachel!

PREMIERE: Wednesday April 10, 9:00 pm
 
When a 50-foot-tall billboard of Rachel goes up in the heart of Hollywood, Rachel has to face her insecurities. Already feeling overwhelmed by the glare of the spotlight, she then takes on a video campaign that leaves her stammering for the cameras. Back at the office, her handbag collection looks fabulous! That is. . .until there's a leather problem that leaves the whole team scrambling.
