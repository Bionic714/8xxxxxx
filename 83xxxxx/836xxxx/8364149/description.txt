BBC Big Band - 2001 - Evidence FLAC

The BBC Big Band is somewhat like the twoΓÇôfaced god Janus, showing its ΓÇ£hipΓÇ¥ face to perceptive Jazz aficionados and its ΓÇ£squareΓÇ¥ face to those who simply want amiable background music that doesnΓÇÖt require much thought. Trouble is, the recordΓÇôbuying public doesnΓÇÖt always know which BBC band is going to show up. Another recent release, The Gleneagles, directed by Barrie Forgie, was disappointing to those of us whoΓÇÖd prefer more Jazz and less schmaltz; Evidence, directed by trombonist Jiggs Whigham, finds the band in a more adventurous frame of mind, saluting hardΓÇôcore Jazz enthusiasts by storming earnestly through a seductive program of luminous standards, splendid original works by Francy Boland, Paul Ferguson, John Clayton and Petri Juutilainen and swinging charts by Clayton, Vaughn Wiester, Mike Barone, Rick Wilkins and Manny Albam. Not satisfied merely to conduct, Whigham unlimbers his agile trombone to good effect on WiesterΓÇÖs arrangement of JobimΓÇÖs ΓÇ£Dindi,ΓÇ¥ JuutilainenΓÇÖs ΓÇ£Lester Went Out,ΓÇ¥ WilkinsΓÇÖ definitive treatment of Ray NobleΓÇÖs ΓÇ£The Touch of Your Lips,ΓÇ¥ FergusonΓÇÖs ΓÇ£Blues for Clare,ΓÇ¥ ClaytonΓÇÖs ΓÇ£Shout Me OutΓÇ¥ and AlbamΓÇÖs arrangement of ΓÇ£YouΓÇÖd Be So Nice to Come Home To.ΓÇ¥ When not soloing, Whigham makes sure that every i is dotted and every t is crossed, and the ensemble responds with a letterΓÇôperfect performance that presses home the richness and vitality of every number. After opening with ClaytonΓÇÖs lively take on ΓÇ£Deed I DoΓÇ¥ (solos by trumpeter Mark White, flugel Paul Eshelby, tenor Martin Williams), the band slows the pace for ΓÇ£DindiΓÇ¥ and BaroneΓÇÖs comeΓÇôhither arrangement of ΓÇ£Yes Sir, ThatΓÇÖs My BabyΓÇ¥ (Andy Panayi, alto; Roy Babbington, bass). Drummer Harold Fisher, once the driving force behind Jack SharpeΓÇÖs excellent big band, assumes the same role here, kicking the band hard when necessary and playing with elegance and restraint when that is called for (as on ΓÇ£The Touch of Your Lips,ΓÇ¥ whose handsome solos are by Whigham and Williams). Williams returns with pianist Andy Vinter on ΓÇ£Thou Swell,ΓÇ¥ trombonist Gordon Campbell is showcased on BolandΓÇÖs lovely ΓÇ£Clair Obscur,ΓÇ¥ and vibraphonist Anthony Kerr shares center stage with trumpeters White, John Ruddick and Nigel Carter on ClaytonΓÇÖs arrangement of Thelonious MonkΓÇÖs skittish ΓÇ£Evidence.ΓÇ¥ Whigham and alto Howard McGill are the soloists on ΓÇ£Blues for Clare,ΓÇ¥ Whigham, McGill and Kerr on the bluesy finale, ΓÇ£Shout Me Out.ΓÇ¥ If youΓÇÖve been searching for a crisp and dynamic recording by the BBC Big BandΓÇÖs ΓÇ£A Team,ΓÇ¥ you need look no further. Here it is. (Jack Bowers, allaboutjazz)
