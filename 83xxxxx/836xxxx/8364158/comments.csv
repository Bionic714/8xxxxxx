,peasantx,2013-04-13T23:30Z,"Hey judas,

recently I watched your rip of Kung Fu Panda 2 on my HT system in 5.1 via USB, and since the video/audio were so damn good I replaced many of my old files with your rips (Dredd, Looper, fight Club, etc). When i tried watching them again, however, I only had 2 audio streams, both of which were AAC 2.0, with no 5.1 stream. Any idea on why this happens? 

Anyway, keep on doing what you do man. Your rips are the best on this site as far as AV quality (for enjoyment on my PC as of now ;))."
[V],dhjudasx,2013-04-14T18:30Z,how is your home theater setup... what were you using to plug the usb into... if it was ps3... make sure the hdmi output on the ps3 is set to LPCM ... aac5.1 cannot in most cases be bitstreamed.. for a computer make sure it's also setup with 6 channel mode if using hdmi..
,peasantx,2013-04-14T20:33Z,"Sorry, forgot to mention I have a HTIB setup. I usually just plug the USB drive directly into my bluray player, play the mp4, and I'm good to go.

[V],dhjudasx,2013-04-14T22:56Z,"I know that most often firmware updates done to a bluray player will reset a lot of the audio/video settings on it. So if it was working before, perhaps something was reset. Make sure that LPCM mode is set in the bluray player.. or perhaps check to see other options.

It would be silly for a bluray manufacturer to suddenly disable aac5.1 support if it was working before. But I wouldn't be surprised."
