"The Time Machine"
April 6, 2013 - Glendale, CA

In this Q&A session, Bashar explains the concept of time travel in relation to the idea all time existing simultaneously. Also includes Q&A with Darryl.

Q&A includes: How does karma relate to the concept of all time existing at once? Why did I have such gruesome dream experiences? Can you speak on Time Travel and DMT? What happened to "Tabor"? Bashar explains Mathematics of Universes and The Prime Radiant. What would you have us do differently? Why did you choose Darryl Anka? As you read the energies now when do you foresee the ET contact taking place? What is the relationship I have to the UFOs I've been seeing? What does your race eat? What is the prognosis of earth? How can we shift to other parallel realities?
