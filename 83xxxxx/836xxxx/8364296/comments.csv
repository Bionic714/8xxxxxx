I create my descriptions from a template and forgot to fill in the decimal places there. Ooops."
,cevapcic,2013-04-12T23:30Z,"Thank you, your work is great!

Could you please encode Ondskan (Evil) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338309/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1"
,jalucian,2013-04-14T02:58Z,"I have several ahead of you, but I will have Ondskan done for you within 4-6 days. I have a soft spot for Swedish movies. My fiancee is Swedish. The Millennium Trilogy in 1080p was one of my first encodes. She is who introduced me to Stieg Larrson's work. Thank you for the positive feedback and I hope you enjoy Ondskan."
,dalesteyn,2013-04-14T16:47Z,fantastic upload...your choice is prty good i must say....it's always a great feeling to find a great NEW encoder(someone who knows what he/she is doing)...i downloaded the dreamer 1080p from you..i was very impressed...
,dalesteyn,2013-04-16T08:38Z,fantastic work Jalucian...saw this one yesterday....awsum quality...there is so much movies to be done...since YIFY only do HOLLYWOOD MOVIES...(what a shame)!!!!
,jalucian,2013-04-16T22:25Z,"Thank you! He did do this one in 720p I believe, but not in 1080p. And just out of curiosity, I tested this one out on a 26"" screen using an HDMI cable. While my encodes are optimized for watching on smaller screens, I was pleasantly surprised to see that my 1080s still look crisp even on larger screens. Also, I think I've honed in some additional x264 settings to improve quality even more and this was the first encode I did with these more rigorous settings. The encoding takes a little longer, but from what I saw on the 26"" screen yesterday, it seems to be well worth it. From here on out, all the 1080s should look just as good as this one on larger screens. There's a huge difference in quality compared to some other encoders who only use a hexagon motion estimation method (I won't mention any names...lol)"
,jalucian,2013-04-16T22:29Z,"I don't mean YIFY, btw. Most of the time his team doesn't use hex (Iron Man 720p being one notable exception, however.)"
,dalesteyn,2013-04-17T05:38Z,"that's good news for us then..MORE CRISP QUALITY..MORE FUN WATCHING IT...ONE SUGGESTION-----you should provide some info about your next upload(S),in that case i won't download that movie from anywhere else...this happens so many times & you know it better than me..."
,jalucian,2013-04-17T20:36Z,"I have considered that, but I already seem to be having a problem with anoXmous/Zen_Bud copying what I'm doing. On All the Presidents Men and In Bruges, within a week he released his own versions, and with The Hunt for Red October, he posted a version of it within *hours* of mine. He's been holding this juvenile grudge against me ever since I pointed out that one of his 1080's had blocking and pixelation in it and I suggesting he increase his bitrate (often below 1600kbps on his 1080s.) I don't know for a fact that he's doing this on purpose, but it certainly looks like it. He even had my comment removed even though what I said was 100% true. He has a bigger audience base just because he's been around longer and so when he releases a version after mine, that tends to steal seeds away from mine, even though mine were posted first. So you see, if I post what I'm going to do ahead of time, there's a chance he will take advantage of that and the situation would just get worse. He does offer 5.1 audio on his and I not (yet) but his encoding settings are mediocre at best. He's the one I was referring to that only uses a hexagon motion estimation method. So much for not mentioning names, but frankly I'm sick of this juvenile behavior from him and no longer care whether or not people know about it. Maybe once it looks like he has stopped doing this, I'll post future release info. What are your thoughts on this?"
,dalesteyn,2013-04-18T07:21Z,"That's unfortunate...we want healthy competition...
all of you(from YIFY to AXXO to someone who uploads CAMs) are like a god to me...coz u take ur time  from your BUSY LIFE and upload movies(or whatever) for free...i respect you guys..such a thing is uncalled for...
Now i have been looking all of your torrents..there i found out about the situation you mentioned...i would like to hope that's a coincidence(as you are not sure)..but if its true,then i must say that is going to be the DUMBEST THING EVER...however, i would like to encourage you to provide info,if your torrents are good enough people will appreciate your work...(GOOD EXAMPLE TED   YIFY released his version way back in 2012, but i see your one has 135 seeds,which is the 3rd highest !!!) Why they didn't download from YIFY,it was AVAILABLE right???(NOW INFORM ME IF I'M MISSING SOMETHING)  you have to hope for the best and go for it and think positively...i suggest you go for it and find out for sure if its really coincidence or not...you have to make the move..whatever it is, i'll STILL LOVE YOUR UPLOADS... :D"
,jalucian,2013-04-18T10:35Z,"I was willing to think it was coincidence after the first time it happened. And even the second. But when it happened the third time, and about 9 hours later (which is, ""coincidentally"" just about how long it would take to download a source and re-encode it using his settings) that's when I really started to doubt it was coincidence. You are right, of course - the work should speak for itself. The only problem is that anyone watching on a small screen, like a laptop, wont see any differences. The differences in quality only become apparent when you compare on larger screens. Consequently, the average computer viewer sees no quality difference. But we'll see. I'll give it some thought. :) Thanks for being a fan and for the encouraging words. "
,dalesteyn,2013-04-18T14:09Z,"@Jalucian-
no problem at all...this is the least we can do...we r getting it for free,and since it doesn't cost a penny to provide support, i guess we can afford it... :)"
,jalucian,2013-04-18T22:05Z,"cevapcic, your Ondskan request is finished and will be posted within the next 36 hours (I may post the 1080p version of Das Boot first, but if so, Ondskan will be the very next one. Due to bandwidth limitations I can only UL one at a time.)"
,jalucian,2013-04-22T03:27Z,"cevapcic, here you go. Sorry it was late:
