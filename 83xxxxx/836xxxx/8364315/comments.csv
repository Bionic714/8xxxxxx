,MrRickardo,2013-05-28T06:05Z,"I uploaded the version 18 below and decided to test this version for you pirates. The 64 bit is has a faulty exe. file and wont work. The 32 bit is good but the patch is from the 18 version and doesn't work on any version. You can install the 32 bit but will need a server license from Tekla to activate it. The uploader knows this and that is why he only uploaded 99.8 percent. He's a piece of shit so don't waste your time on him. Use the 18 version below and good luck. The version 18 32 bit, works on my 64 bit windows 7. If you have windows 8, google tekla 18 compatible with windows 8 and a how to install on windows 8 is on the internet. "

I apologize for my comments to EngM7md. I was wrong. Hopefully he doesnt speak english. There is enough information in the 99.8 percent download to run Tekla 19. The patch had a password and when i cracked the password and ran the patch in the nt/bin file it worked. The password is 181. You must run the patch as administrator, by right clicking the file when you run it. Sorry about the comments. "
