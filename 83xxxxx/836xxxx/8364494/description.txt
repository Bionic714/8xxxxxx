Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site :: On the Thursday, April 11 edition of The Alex Jones Show, Alex covers the latest on the stand-off with North Korea as a Chinese professor predicts all-out war and the U.S. and North Korea engage in a dangerous game of military brinkmanship. 

Alex also breaks down the latest on the Democrat orchestrated march in Congress to destroy the Second Amendment and impose gun registration and ultimately confiscation on the American people. 

On today's broadcast, Alex talks with country and Southern-rock singer-songwriter Shooter Jennings. His latest album is The Other Life.

Not mentioned in the official show description, Larry Pratt of Gun Owners of America is a guest in hour two. Also, Mike Adams is on late in hour two and early in hour three talking about the latest BitCoin news.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
