 : You already know you can create amazing things with LEGO, but did you know :
 : you can also make vehicles that roll and model plans that include landing  :
 : gear and flaps that actually extend and retract? You can even make         :
 : functional robots without getting into Mindstorms and programming. In      :
 : Practical LEGO Technics, Mark Rollins shows you how to use LEGO and Power  :
 : Functions components like motors and remote controls to create motorized   :
 : cars, all terrain vehicles, vehicle steering, construction equipment such  :
 : as cranes and forklifts, airplanes. All-in-all, you'll learn to create a   :
 : wide variety of fun, unique LEGO creations.                                :
 :                                                                            :
 : LEGO Technic is similar to Mindstorms in that you can create all sorts of  :
 : cool vehicles and gadgets. But unlike Mindstorms, you don't have to learn  :
 : programming. Power Functions allows you to add motors, remote control, and :
 : battery boxes to your LEGO projects, no programming required. And while you:
 : could just build a LEGO Technic gadget from a boxed set, with Practical    :
 : LEGO Technics, you'll learn the hows and whys of Technic project design,   :
 : and pick up ideas for your own custom projects.                            :
