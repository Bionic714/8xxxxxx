Summary:

Internationally bestselling author John Marsden takes us beyond The Tomorrow Series ... but the war isn't over.

For Ellie Linton, being back on the farm with her parents is what makes the terrible things that happened during the war -- the things she, Homer, Lee, Fi, and the others had to do -- all worthwhile. It's where she belongs.

But the war won't let her go. A devastating tragedy has shattered any hope she ever had to reclaim her life, or herself. It's a new kind of fight. And the enemy isn't always from the other side of the border.

Another spectacular novel of war and its consequences by bestselling author John Marsden. - Goodreads Summary of While I Live (The Ellie Chronicles #1)

Note: The sequel series to the critically acclaimed series "Tomorrow" Series by John Marsden, and is recommendable to those who enjoy wars, apocalyptic worlds and a romance to put everything on the line for. Mainly for a young adult audience, but is recommendable to all.
