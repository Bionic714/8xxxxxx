Plot: Three middle-age guards learn that their museum has sold a wing of art to a Danish museum. Each has a favorite in that collection, and none can imagine life without the peace and completion it brings. Though mere acquaintances, they plot a theft of the three pieces between the time they are packed and the time theyΓÇÖre loaded onto a plane. First each must obtain a forgery; then, they have to smuggle the forgeries into the museum and find a way to make the switches. The heist is complicated by RogerΓÇÖs intrusive wife ΓÇô heΓÇÖs promised her a trip to Florida for their anniversary ΓÇô and GeorgeΓÇÖs proclivity for taking his clothes off when standing in front of the warrior statue he loves.
