Uncomfortable with his sudden fame in 1959 Sonny Rollins took 3 years 

off.  He sharpened his axe on the Williamsburg bridge NYC in the meantime.


The LP "THE BRIDGE" with guitarist Jim Hall was his "return" opus in 1962.



RCA added 2 tracks to the original and called it "THE QUARTETS FEATURING

JIM HALL."
