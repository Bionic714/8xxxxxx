There are two releases by the same group with different file sizes and resolutions but (virtually) identical names - not sure what that's about, but it's been happening quite a bit lately.

Anyway, they're both in the weeklies:

http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7962204/0-Day_Week_of_2012.12.19 -> Super Dinosaur 16 (2012) (digital) (Minutemen-InnerDemons)

http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8139057/Hitlist_week_2013.02.06_-_Part_4 -> Super Dinosaur 016 (2012) (digital) (Minutemen-InnerDemons)"

[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-12T14:59Z,"sid4fun12345, i'm not worried about trade paperbacks. so if you want point of impact just search for it and download the #1-4 torrents. they were posted between october and january.

gesserit, yes InnerDemons released the 1st version when it was published in december, and later in february released a higher-resolution version as part of a full run. thanks for the links.

you're welcome PiratusLongus!"
