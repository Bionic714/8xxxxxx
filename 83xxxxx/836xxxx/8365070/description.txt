Hunky NY lawyer Jeff Daly has finally got engaged to fickle Sarah Huttinger, who presents him to her Pasadena family, who all soon take to him, for her sister's wedding to Scott. But Jeff's clever counting makes Sarah realize her dad Earl isn't her biological father. Once movie clues from family indicate as suspect success author Beau Burroughs, she insists to get to meet him. Only like her mother and grandmother, she has a one night-stand with Beau, which may well cost her Jeff.
