,Scyrthis,2013-04-13T12:52Z,"This torrent is dead

And what mods is used here?"
,fabiencolombo,2013-04-15T11:38Z,"the torrent is alive, I'm the only one seeding though.
For videos check here:

It's a small thing i put up to present everything.
under media section you'll find the video"
,Sorfex0,2013-04-15T23:03Z,Nice job. It looks absolutely awsm. Gonna download and seed at least for few months ;P
,ZshadeZ,2013-04-20T06:13Z,"Seeding this to 100% will take roughly 2-3 more days at current speed. After that there will be many of us with the full DL. Speeds from 0-80% reached 4meg/s+, just stuck in line waiting on the rest now. From the site seems more than worth it."
,Sorfex0,2013-04-22T19:08Z,Done ;) Going to check it out and report here.
,Sorfex0,2013-04-22T23:35Z,Ok. Got a problem for few hours but everything is working fine. Mods are awms. Download and play. No viruses. ;P
,bashnma,2013-04-24T11:26Z,"This compilation is madness. Please, update this eventually, because 1.8 version is already old. Anyway i am gonna play your version, thanks for the hard work. Its not so ""animeish"" look as you think, you know? Only elins i saw in videos, other things in the game looks delicious to players, that love dark and ambient look of skyrim, even though elins really look out of place, because even you play some sort of elven character. Why bring elin race to this, when every other thing is perfect? 

Also very good work with choosing texture replacements, weapons and armor. It has good look in game. Even if i had time, i think it will be a whole month to collect all of this.

 Can this version be used with BOSS? Because i think it will not detect it, i am afraid. Are other players installed correct load order by hands?"
,bashnma,2013-04-24T12:48Z,"By the way, The.Elder.Scrolls.V.Skyrim.Install.Fix by Reloaded works great with this. If you just drop files to some Skyrim folder (even if you don't have skyrim before), you can use Install Fix to set required registry links to your installation directory:

http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8111368/The.Elder.Scrolls.V.Skyrim.Install.Fix-RELOADED

Now you can run it with BOSS and use it to build mod file list."
,bashnma,2013-04-24T14:37Z,"Hey, uploader! Why you didnt mention this:

""IMPORTANT UPDATE:
YOU MUST DEACTIVATE ( OR DELETE) THE FOLLOWING ESM :

Solstheim Climate Overhaul
getSnowy
Skyrimaguas_Bigger_better_Sun
SkySet - Climates of Tamriel
Skyset

I forgot to take them out before uploading the torrent, sorry.
It will cause CTD at startup""

I founded this on your site. I think it is a very important information! Because this files are still in torrent."
,tanner15,2013-05-18T19:42Z,can you fix your game save dl on speedy share. it's requiring you to be premium before it will allow you to download it. the Ini files were fine though
