After gathering volunteers, Ragnar, Rollo, and Floki embark on an unauthorized raid to England. Lagertha violently objects to Ragnar's refusal to take her along. Earl Haraldson has a man killed who attempts to seduce his wife Siggy, as well as the blacksmith who forged Ragnar's anchor. After a tense voyage, Ragnar's men land in England near the monastery of Lindisfarne, which they proceed to sack. They kill most of the monks and capture the rest to take back as slaves, including the young Athelstan, whom Ragnar protects from death at Rollo's hands.
