THE  BIG BANG OF IDEAS 
Some child in an cient  times  must have  said, as he  watched a bird sar  up  in  the  sky,  "If  only  I could  fly  like  that!"  Obviously  his  elders would have laughed, hearing this. But it was the birth of an  idea  that  inspired generations to  come,  through  countless  centu ries,  to be  realized  in  modern  times  through  the  efforts  of the  Wright brothers. An  idea  is  in visible  and  weightless,  having no  material  substa nce. And yet  it has  the  power  to  change  your  life or  even the course of history. Any in vention, discovery or  historical event had  its origin in  a spark of thought that  developed in to an  idea. In  this  issue  of Tell Me  Why,  we  are making  an  attempt to  present some path-breaking ideas  that  changed  the way  we live.
