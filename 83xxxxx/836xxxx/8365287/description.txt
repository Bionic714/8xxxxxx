Similar to flame_leg's edition, but with some important differences:

- Much smaller size and better consistent quality
- No swearing removed
- Less reliance on still/text frames

In this episode:
Bronn and a prostitute are fooling around when they are interrupted by Tyrion's squire. The fooling around is completely removed, and the scene begins with a short still after the door opens. After this point, whenever something naughty comes up, it is cropped old-school style with them raunchy ol' black bars.
