Hasbro and DHX Studios: Make this and MLP available legally (I'm in the UK, neither is available in any way shape or form) and I will buy every single episode without hesitation.  I love it and want to support it.  But you literally give us no choice but to pirate it.  JUST TAKE MY MONEY!  It's British, but it's not dirty, I promise!"
