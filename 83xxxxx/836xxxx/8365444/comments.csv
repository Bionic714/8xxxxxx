,KiNGDRASTIK,2013-04-14T09:48Z,"This TV series has been going downhill recently.
I remember when it was about a community college."
,Capn.JackSparrow,2013-04-15T12:52Z,"@KiNGDRASTIK

The reason for that is because Community is in it's
4th Season, and College is just 4 years, so the producers are experimenting if the can go beyond Season 4 and into Season 5.

And , uh, yohoho and a bottle of rum."
