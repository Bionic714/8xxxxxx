This show aired on STARZ, same as Spartacus so I do not know how the editing came about. Will delete and wait for better version. Thank you for your efforts! It is appreciated.

A/V = 9/7"

Nudity being blurred out is a turnoff.
If Starz wants to compete with HBO, it should not make the show almost unwatchable.  I'll stick with HBO shows, more watchable."
