,Viciously,2013-04-12T11:53Z,"ok heres the facts, its a bitter pill to swallow, but what ive agreed with the admins & a sysop is for the GOOD of the SITE as well as keeping US happy.

Sky issued a nasty DCMA to take down/remove all my F1s this season & threatened the removal of the site - legally - IF any further Sky Sports F1 content went up.

At the same time, my sky account (thats ALL sky TV & broadband) as closed by Sky Security & Investigations team



Ive managed to source via a 3rd party a new sky box & card.. via a m8 in Eire (Ireland)
however..

In light of the above.. the following has been agreed as i said..

All future F1 shows & Races for this season - Includiing Formula 1, GP2 & GP3  - Practice, Qualifying & Race & The F1 Show.. OFF SKY will no longer be allowed on site. By Hannibal.


Looks like there wont be any Sky content anymore. Fuck no. :(

Do what you can, but find a way to upload sky f1 elsewhere, whatever needs to be done.... fuck em , its not like they are short of money and need to sue a lowly peer sharing site.

Just upload them elsewhere , seriosuly!"
