,ajoiner85,2013-04-12T22:58Z,"I'm still upset that Jodie Foster wasnt in the movie Hannibal because the script was ""too violent"" or some shit. I mean she was in The Silence of the Lambs and she couldnt do Hannibal because of a fucking pig scene??? Gimme a break!!
FUCK YOU Jodie Foster!!!
I dont care if she delivered amazing performances in The Silence of the Lambs and Contact and Taxi Driver and Nell and The Brave One and pretty much every fucking movie she does. She had an obligation to reprise her role in that movie and she didnt and that is just BAD FORM..."

,ozboy101,2013-04-14T10:32Z,"@ajoiner85.......are you kidding me?.......ignore the fact that Jodie had absolutely NO obligation to do any Silence sequels, and i agree, it would have been great if she did do it.......but move on .......it was more than a decade ago ....surely you have more important things to waste time fretting about!"

,coute,2013-05-21T03:39Z,"Guys, this show is in trouble! If you like it, please consider watching it on tv or Hulu! This is not an anti-piracy message, I DO download this series as well because I can get it faster and at better quality through torrent but I also go and watch it on Hulu later to increase the ratings. I just really love this show and would hate to see it cancelled! Support Hannibal!"
