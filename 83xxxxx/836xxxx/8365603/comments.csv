,pumpernickel,2013-04-12T17:28Z,At Jotti 14 out of 22 Scanners reported malware. So I have not dared to try it.
,NicksonYap,2013-04-12T18:18Z,"@pumpernickel
Funny you, to install 22 ""scanners""? 
Well, this is not my patch I am here to share what I have found. I am also using this software and also trying to design PCBs. Use this 6.4.0 or stay at the 6.3.0 
I only use Windows Defender. Coz all other anti-virus softwares are nasty. While you've got 22 of them."

Good, never heard of Jotti. Would like to try it.

I have used it to scan:
-cadsoft.eagle.professional.6.4.0-patch.exe
 This one does have a lot of warnings, but they are all marked as ""not-a-virus:RiskTool.Win32.Patcher.dk"", ""Win32/HackTool.Patcher.AD""

the patched files:
- eagle.exe and eaglecon.exe
  All scanners mark it as safe except: ClamAV scanner, ""PUA.Win32.Packer.BgiStrokedFont"""
,codlink,2013-04-12T18:43Z,"Than don't use it idiot.  It's a false positive which if you had any knowledge of torents, then you would have known that 95% of cracks will show up as a virus because the companies don't want you to use them.  The rest of them will show up on virus scans because it hooks the program to make it do what YOU want.  Technically, that IS a virus.  But one that won't harm your little computer.  

I have installed this and works like a charm.  

@NiksonYap, is this made by Bunion?  I have lost his forum bookmark and would like a link to it, please and thank you.

Hahah, I've used some of your Cadsoft Eagle torrents too! 
I've tried looking for 6.4.0 for quite some time but none seems to be released.
Then few days ago I tried to search in Google again. One of the search results from Google was a website that indexes uploaded files from various upload sites and displayed a rar file of the 6.4.0 and a patch.
So I just downloaded it and gave it a try. it worked like a charm like you said :/

Haven't found any forums about CadSoft Eagle cracks.... Sorry :("

 Haha, that's how I found the first Eagle 6.2 crack was searching.  That's when I found the forum I am seeking again.  One of the members name was ""Bunion"" that wrote the cracks.  His cracks are worded just like this one.  By the time he realeased 6.3 crack, I was like, hell, why don't I put this on tpb.

Then when 6.4 was released months later, I noticed I lost the forum bookmark.  And up until now, I was looking for the crack for 6.4.  So I kept using 6.3!

And no, that's not it.  the forum had a dark theme, with like green text.  It had some weird name, prolly why I can't remember it.  I sure wish I still had that link...

Thanks for the up man."

,zmasterz,2013-05-19T23:24Z,Someone knows if there is any crack for Eagle 6.4.0 for OSX (10.8)?
