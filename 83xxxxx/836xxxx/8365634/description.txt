British saxophonist John Butcher and bassist John Edwards are two of the most
prominent voices in European free improvisation. They are joined by two Italian
improvisers, Alberto Braida on piano and Fabrizio Spera on drums. As with many
free improvisation, forget about roles in the band: all musicians contribute in
equal parts, adding sounds, interacting and creating high levels of immediate
intensity. The band's name is well chosen, as the music is somewhere suspended
in the air, very sparse and devoid of a need to produce sound, free of earthly
concerns, although it flows quite organically, naturally, without structure or
foundation. The musicians play their limited notes and sounds with reserve,
paying full attention to each of them, infusing every one of them with
power. Braida can play a few keys, just enough to add to the overall
atmosphere, without feeling the need to make chords, or phrases. It's the sound
that counts, and in that he finds a real soulmate in John Butcher, whose
careful powerful minimalism is impressive as usual, Edwards' versatility and
creativity, both on arco and plucked is astonishing, and listen how Spera
builds depth, contrast and color. Some moments are harsh, others are of an
incredible subtlety and nuance. The end result is one of ethereal beauty, not
easy to get into, but worth every note.
