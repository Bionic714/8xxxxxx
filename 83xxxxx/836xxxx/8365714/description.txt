Wormhole [The Rho Agenda, Book 3]  Richard Phillips

When the Rho ProjectΓÇÖs lead scientist, Dr. Donald Stephenson, 
is imprisoned for his crimes against humanity, the world dares 
to think the threat posed by the Rho ProjectΓÇÖs alien 
technologies is finally over. The world is wrong. In 
Switzerland, scientists working on the Large Hadron Collider 
have discovered a new threat, a scientific anomaly capable of 
destroying the earth ΓÇô and only Rho Project technology can 
stop it. In exchange for a full pardon, Dr. Stephenson agrees 
to create a wormhole that will send the anomaly into deep 
space.

But his promise masks the alien agenda that brought the 
Rho Ship to earth. Now a trio of accidentally altered 
humans must infiltrate StephensonΓÇÖs wormhole project and 
stop it, no matter the cost. The final battle has begun 
and this is one battle mankind cannot afford to lose.
