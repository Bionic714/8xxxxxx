The solo debut from Adam Haworth Stephens, lead singer and songwriter of San Francisco duo Two Gallants, spotlights his ability to craft compelling and intelligent songs that have forged an intimate and emotional bond with fans and captivated critics with words so personal theyΓÇÖre universal.

From beginning to end, We Live on Cliffs is a shimmering blend of alternative folk with a pop sensibility full of first-person narratives that create a marvelously eclectic collection. And while there is a natural bridge between Two Gallants and Stephens' solo work, these songs contain an introspection and musical diversity that has not been touched on before. Produced by Grammy Award-winning producer Joe Chiccarelli, We Live on Cliffs features Stephens on vocals, guitar and piano and a host of guest musicians including Patrick Hallahan and Bo Koster (My Morning Jacket), Justin Meldal-Johnsen, Joey Waronker, Cody Votolato (Blood Brothers / Jaguar Love), Mike Daly, Petra Haden, Andy Cabic (Vetiver) and current band members Jen Grady, Matt Montgomery and Omar Cuellar.
