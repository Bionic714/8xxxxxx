His boundless energy and enthusiasm for performingmusic are evident at every show whether it's with his former band-matesin Cadillac Sky, or whether it's with the Avett Brothers, Jessica LeaMayfield, Among The Oak & Ash, or his The David Mayfield Parade.The self-titled debut album, The David Mayfield Parade, released on 9thGrade Records which David co-founded with fellow songwriter JoshJoplin, effortlessly ventures from classic AM radio rock with lush stringarrangements to unadorned alt-country ballads whose lovelorn subjectsevoke the outlaw songs of the early 70's. It succeeds and endures because at its heart it does not pretend to be anything but what it is, a sincere rock record.This sincerity is reflected in every performance the band gives, as there is no posturing, no fa√ßade, nothing but great songs and the instruments to play them. Mayfield's ability to connect with audiences from performances at Bonnaroo and MerleFest, to NPR's Mountain Stage and The Grand Ole Opry, have earned him the reputation of being the kind ofextraordinary artist who goes beyond trend and simply delivers genuinelyessential music.Mayfield says while making the album in his hometown of Kent, Ohio hedrew inspiration from his musical heroes Buddy Holly, Harry Nilsson, andRandy Newman and the albums he grew up listening to, Simon andGarfunkel's "Bridge Over Troubled Water" and Melanie's "Gather Me"
