Spectacular scenery and large sweeping curves through the Rocky Mountains are just some of the features of Marias Pass, available now for Train Simulator.

The route is famous for its spectacular bridges, and these are accurately depicted alongside other features including mountain snow sheds, the silo Dalek at Browning, Belton Lake, the concrete Penguin at Cut Bank, a large marshalling yard at Whitefish, industrial facilities throughout the route and the 13 mile branch line to Kalispell.

Also included with the route is a GE ES44 DC locomotive in BNSF heritage livery and a Burlington Northern EMD SW1500 switcher, along with new BNSF 50ft box cars and lumber cars, and several reworked freight cars in BNSF and BN livery.

Marias Pass is a stunning Montana route through some of the most picturesque mountainous settings with its unique challenges of driving long, heavy freight trains up and down the wide valleys and gentle gradients.
