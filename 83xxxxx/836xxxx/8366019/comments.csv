Bottom Line:
“Assassins Run” is an OK 90 minute distraction with a cool concept that is completely buried in a pile of over-thought marketing rubbish.  Take this story concept and put some marquee quality stars in it with a wide theatrical release and it would probably do some business.   Unfortunately, with its generic title and cover art, this straight to DVD release is sure to be overlooked by many due to the real film inside being completely misrepresented and is destined for bargain bins and ultimately completely forgotten.  It’s a shame, because this movie’s not bad."
