What I've done here is compile the Season 2 Hatufim videos uploaded by TVIS (with hardcoded Spanish subs). I've used the English subs found in the torrent uploaded by Drizzle99 and re-hardcoded those over the top of the Spanish subs with a black letterbox behind them (covering the old subs) and with yellow text so that it stands out from the israeli subs which were also hardcoded.

It is not a perfect situation but it is definitely watchable and thought it would be appreciated until a better options is uploaded.
