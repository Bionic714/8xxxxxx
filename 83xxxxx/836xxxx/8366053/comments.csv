Cheers!"
,420_buddy,2013-04-13T00:19Z,no keygen in all those zips...
,senseinai,2013-04-13T02:02Z,"Many thanks for this.
@420_buddy The keygen is in cr-dde30.zip. I've unpacked and installed the whole works, run the keygen, and all is well."
,druggie,2013-04-13T04:03Z,can someone write directions for unpacking and loading this please
,macomaniac,2013-04-13T12:18Z,"hi druggie!

The silly method I used : I decompressed EACH .zip file to nearly as many folders happening to contain in turn .rar compressed files, but for several of those .zip files that gave directly .rar files without being contained into folders themselves. Then I dragged BY HAND each .rar file contained inside a folder out of it, so as to have in the end exactly 39 files ending from part01.rar to part39.rar. Do count the files and check the right succession from part01.rar to part39.rar. Now a double-clicking on the first one will decompress & join the whole of them to a Dragon_Dictate_EN_3.0.dmg.

Be careful to extract separately the core_keygen.dmg contained aside of a .rar file in cr-dde30 folder  obtained from the decompression of cr-dde30.zip file. Now you are at it.

[Either I am but a moron with moron-methods or that package implying so much handicraft is but some test-intending joke.]

,420_buddy,2013-04-13T19:48Z,ok ill try again...
,420_buddy,2013-04-13T20:59Z,my apologies - worked like senseinai said - THANKS!!!
,Troutstalker,2013-04-14T00:56Z,"Initially I did what @macomaniac did, on an iMac.  Unzipping produced all these other folders etc, just like he did.  Pain in the whatsit.
But I think that's just due to a problem with the Mac expanders.
I then did it on a Windows PC - I used WinZip to unzip all the zip files, which resulted - directly, no extra folders - in a complete list of RAR files.
I then used WinRAR by right-clicking on the first RAR file and clicked on ""UnRAR here"", and ended up with the final .DMG files for both the app and the keygen.
Then just popped 'em on a USB stick, transferred them to the iMac, and - Bingo!"
,druggie,2013-04-14T01:49Z,"Macomaniac, great instructions and method. I was able to install the program after constructing the dmg file. One final question....when I run the keygen, it gives a ""fingerprint"" with about 8 characters but the serial activation requires a lot more so can you tell me how to utilize the keygen since the product states that it is unregistered.
THanks for all your help and thanks to sgenius for a great upload."
,macomaniac,2013-04-14T10:02Z,"@Troutstalker.

Yeah! I think the uploader, though willing to share a Mac version here, actually didn't use Mac tools to convert the software into the split & archived files of that package. But Holly Crap! why at first such a weird decision to cut the 'Dragon' into small .rar pieces AND zip them moreover? I cannot figure out the whole thing.

@druggie. Great MORON's method, actually. When peeping at myself in the mirror, that's just the way I happen now to look to myself (lol). Just to make a bit more automatic that childish proceeding, one could open on Mac the «Unarchiver», go to the Dragon folder with all the .zip files, select them all in a row and ask for decompression in the same folder. Don't be afraid of so many windows opening in the Finder one after the other. Just close them all in the end. In the Dragon folder, there would be now a series of blue folders in a row.

One could put on the left side of the Desktop the  opened window of the Dragon folder showing them and create a new folder on the desktop, with its opened window on the other side, the right one of the Desktop. Then, select the series of freshly decompressed blue folders in the Dragon one and ask the Finder to open them all, ending in a superposition of open windows. Just by hand drag each .rar file contained in each window to the right window of the empty Desktop folder and after each dragging close the emptied window. Having to perform that 39 times is not the end of the world. Be careful to extract the .dmg of the Keygen too out of the cr-dde30 folder.

In the end, you should have your series of part01.rar to part39.rar files in the right folder of the desktop. Double-clic the first one to generate the .dmg Dragon file.

As for the Keygen, a simple clic on the 'Save lic' button seems to do the trick, making 'Registration details successfully saved' to allow the activation of the app. I figure out, in the 'About Dragon' infos, the mention : 'unregistered', to merely mean 'not registered as a user' beside the 'Nuance' site and not 'unable to run due to the lack of a serial'."
,jumjumb,2013-04-14T16:36Z,"I know its for free etc etc etc, but I still wanna know why some sickhead did compress the files like this!? Dont tell me its because of the size. This is bullshit. 
Thanks for the upload anyway, but sorry I dont seed  ... :o("
,420_buddy,2013-04-14T18:29Z,this method of splitting reminds me of the old school usenet days downloading from alt.2600.warez in Outlook Express....
,chelvaonline,2013-04-16T11:10Z,please Someone  tell  me  how to register with the core_keygen.dmg
,demss2,2013-04-16T19:05Z,"Download and install went fine but when trying to open dictate I get ""Dictate quit unexpectedly"" and the keygen save license button sez ""Failed- check your privilege settings and try again"". "
,midorosan,2013-04-23T11:07Z,"thank you macomaniac for the detailed instructions it took a while and I screwed up twice but eventually got the dmg file and installed the software. When I launch I am asked for an activation number, I have 5 additional times before activation is required.
I have opened the keygen but all that is is an app which when clicked does nothing.
Any help would be appreciated I am running OS X 10.8.3"
,midorosan,2013-04-23T12:21Z,"Further to my previous comment I havve tried finding an activation number on the web, I have found the same serial number several times but it is in the format 4 4 4 4 whereas the DD activation number is in the format 5 4 4 3 2.
Thanks again for the help."
,midorosan,2013-04-24T11:34Z,I am writing here in the hope that someone will respond. I booted my mac in Snow Leopard today and the core keygen opened just as described I pressed the key and got the message your license is activated. Problem is DD only works in 10.8.3 and the key only works in 10.7.2 so short of installing this in Snow Leopard which means I will be constantly changing OS's I can't see how I can use it which is a pity as it a class product.
,vanoremi,2013-06-01T03:50Z,"So I'm a little confused. I did everything on the instructions for unpacking the zip files, I have 01 through 39 of the .rar files in order after I drug them out of each of their blue files, and I ran the keygen, but when I double click on the part01.rar file nothing happens. It just says the keygen does not support this file type and does not decompress them all and join them into Dragon_Dictate_EN_3.0.dmg. I'm very new at doing this so please pardon my stupidity, but could someone please help me. "
