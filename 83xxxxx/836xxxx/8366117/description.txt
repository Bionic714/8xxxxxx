It is composed of 11 stunning original songs, which are straight from the artist's heart. " I think it's the first record that I've recorded that comes the closest to a true representation of my music and where I come from. There was a great vibe happening on these sessions. Although it's a studio recording all the songs were basically live takesâ€¦ there is no fancy cover up just the raw, real truth." -Reed Foehl 

The Boston Globe
"He sings like he feels every note... Each song tells a story, all of which he relates astonishingly well."

Donnie Moorhouse-WRNX
"If it is the assignment of artists, authors and songwriters to make sense of our emotions, then the work of REed Foehl represents the very pinnacle of the craft."
