BBC Radio Big Band - 1990 - Special Edition FLAC

THE RADIO BIG BAND
Because of certain legal niceties which prevent it from using its full name, there may be some minor doubts as to exactly who the band is! However, there can be no doubt at all, that it is now regarded as one of the finest of its type anywhere in the world, with an almost unequaled 'panache' and range of repertoire, the envy of big bands everywhere. (CD booklet)
So it's the BBC Big Band.
