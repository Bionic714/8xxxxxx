[T],[D],2013-04-14T21:40Z,"There is a steamfix that allows to play mercenaries. You need steam installed and logged to play, and works fine. Just google ""royalgamer06 resident evil 6 fix""."
,Prince75,2013-04-15T12:13Z,D There is no way i can play merceneries offline i dont want to be online all the time if i want to play mercenaries 
,vinzumitzu24,2013-04-16T05:26Z,do i need update 2 to install this?
,4nt1trt,2013-04-16T08:44Z,"i hope we'll see these fixes on next:

-mercenaries mode sending records data freeze
-add skip button to game credit
-game crash at collections section when using high graphic setting to view configures (i mean player's statues)"
[T],[D],2013-04-16T09:45Z,"Yes, you can play offline. You need at some point to be signed din to steam, but after that you can remove the cable and still play.

The mercenaries sending data is not an issue with the game to be fixed by them, it's an issue with the crack.

You can skip credits with backspace."

,Prince75,2013-04-16T16:49Z,D please explain to me how is the procedure currently when I'm browsing I'm using a modem so first I should have Internet activated then I log in steam after that I start the game is it correct please let me know 
,Prince75,2013-04-16T18:03Z,D can I login to steam. With my phone that is connected to the computer as a modem coz I have the steam application in my phone 
[T],[D],2013-04-17T00:53Z,Steam must be installed and logged in on the computer you want to play the game on. After that you can disconnect. And you need the steam fix crack.
,Digimoon,2013-04-17T03:55Z,When one asks the fucking question do you NEED A FUCKING PREVIOUS UPDATE? IS IT HARD TO SAY YES OR NO? FOR FUCK SAKES!
,Prince75,2013-04-17T18:19Z,Thanks D the solution you gave me works wonders i can now play mercenaries mode without any freeze of sending data records thanks just login once logged in play offline works thanks dude 
,4nt1trt,2013-04-17T19:01Z,"in nfo said previous updates are required but in torrent description is not
In fact we wont need previous because update 3 means update 1+2+3 inside this pack"
,4nt1trt,2013-04-17T19:04Z,"My bad, in far cry 3 update 1.05 said previous is required not resident evil 6"
,bac7330,2013-04-18T03:59Z,"D, the steamfix made my Resident Evil 6 unstartable. What version of the steamfix do I get and does the crack I have matter? http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8289638/Resident_Evil_6_(ENGRUS)_Repack_By_R.G_Origami_NASWARI_ZOHAIB_"
[T],[D],2013-04-19T16:34Z,"Version 1 of steamfix is the one to use with this update3. It will work with reloaded crack, so should with that repack as well. Dunno, ask in steamfix forum thread."
,DAMOhero,2013-04-19T17:19Z,"Dude need help. I got stuck at when i fight the giant fish. When leon shouts "" Here it comes get ready"" the giant fish just disappear. NEED HELP!!"
,DAMOhero,2013-04-19T17:27Z,"Need help! i got stuck when leon fights the giant fish and shout "" here it comes, get ready "" the giant fish just disappear. "
,4nt1trt,2013-04-19T23:36Z,"@[D] thank you for helping us
@DAMOhero did you applied update completely?
If it disappears everytime means that first time you installed the game you ignored some files when error occured on installation"
,DAMOhero,2013-04-20T05:17Z,@4nt1trt Yup just did it today. Still the same thing happens. That's a bummer i just deleted the installer. So re-download and re-install is the best solution?
,Remi187,2013-04-20T22:07Z,thank berry much! :)
,4nt1trt,2013-04-21T10:56Z,"@DAMOhero I think you have blackbox or steamrip version but this update is for reloaded version.
My re6 is reloaded which mr stifmeister uploaded
Try another update"
