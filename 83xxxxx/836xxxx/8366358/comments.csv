@Buxaroo, some of us cant afford to buy it right this minute :(, i for one cant, but this is my first purchase as soon as i can afford to, how could i not support the company, this is the first 4x that feels like a real successor to the MOO games!
Any chance someone could upload a more current version please :)"
,theassassinguy59,2013-04-16T11:09Z,@johnjacob87 could you link me the new version (cant seem to find it even tho theres only 2 torrents)
