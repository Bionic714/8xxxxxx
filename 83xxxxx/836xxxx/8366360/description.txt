A Pulitzer PrizeΓÇôwinning reporterΓÇÖs riveting account of the transformation of the CIA and AmericaΓÇÖs special operations forces into man-hunting and killing machines in the worldΓÇÖs dark spaces: the new American way of war
 
The most momentous change in American warfare over the past decade has taken place away from the battlefields of Afghanistan and Iraq, in the corners of the world where large armies canΓÇÖt go. The Way of the Knife is the untold story of that shadow war: a campaign that has blurred the lines between soldiers and spies and lowered the bar for waging war across the globe. America has pursued its enemies with killer drones and special operations troops; trained privateers for assassination missions and used them to set up clandestine spying networks; and relied on mercurial dictators, untrustworthy foreign intelligence services, and proxy armies.
