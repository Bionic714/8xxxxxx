,D4rknecross,2013-04-12T18:06Z,Work's In Windows XP?
,Stefanovics,2013-04-13T13:13Z,"D4rknecross:
i dont think so, but if you have XP,
try the old Age of Empires II The Conqueors
it's basicly the same only this has better effects and supports larger resolutions"
,whatthefuckpassword,2013-04-14T15:30Z,"There has been an announcement on steam that they are working on the problem of it not working in XP.  So if this update was released in the last few days, they it may indeed be the XP fix."

AOE II HD Update 4/8
You should be seeing a game update pushed out here shortly to address the issues users experienced with Windows XP. Please note that players currently in game that haven't updated will likely get an out of sync if they play with people who have updated. So go update! Thanks :)

,white-energy,2013-04-14T21:45Z,Still.. XP has issues loading it.
,gezimd,2013-04-14T21:56Z,"pasted the crack files

,Drunkllamajr,2013-04-18T05:29Z,For all those with single player LAG this fixed it for me!!!
,silviu_bs,2013-04-19T09:57Z,I still have LAG in single player even after this update..... 
,whatthefuckpassword,2013-04-24T18:19Z,"Why are you capitalising ""lag""? 
It's not an acronym."
,danielpr3,2013-04-25T23:08Z,"I tried downloading this update, but still I have the same problem: every time that I try to start a game(be it single player, AoK campaign, TC campaign, or even Scenario editor), it crashes and it was using nearly 1 GB of RAM some seconds before crashing. But now, after crashing, it doesn't show the ""Age of Empires II HD has stopped answering"" window. If anyone could help me, I would be grateful!"
,spark198501,2013-04-26T08:06Z,I noticed that bombard towers only cause 1 hp damage to rams and (unpacked) Trebuchets does anyone know if this update may fix it?
,crysisftw,2013-04-28T12:50Z,"didn't solve the single player lag problem. hmmm, will just wait then.

by the way, the single player performance fix has arrived in steam as a beta update. any chance that can be uploaded?"
,danielpr3,2013-04-29T04:21Z,"Guys, I found the problem: It were my videocard drivers: I updated them and it worked!!! So, there is a tip for the people who got the same problem as me ;-)"
,Jackal96,2013-05-04T19:44Z,"This is great man, keep the Updates/Patches coming!

Would it be possible for you to upload Mods/HD Texture repacks from the Steam Workshop so we can add them to the Non-Steam game?

Thank you!"
,gezimd,2013-05-06T18:20Z,The application failed to initialize properly (0xc0000142); anyone fixed this yet? win xp
