We don't know exactly what was updated in this version, but the game still
had the bug we fixed a few days ago, so we've applied the patch again.

Hint: Stack overflow in "AVTRIBE_World#56".

More updates to this game are expected as it is buggy. For instance it may
not always work correctly when installed in C:Program Files
