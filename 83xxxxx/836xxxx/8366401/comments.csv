,dubai1991,2013-04-13T04:54Z,"1. Fix for occasional crash occurring during startup of the game during opening movies
2. Fix for some audio being permanently disabled if a checkpoint is restored while the screen is still faded to black prior to the player’s first encounter with Daisy Fitzroy.
3. Fix for user inventory issue in the Town Center fair"

Yes because clearly a Reloaded crack sucks.

Get a better antivirus, chooch."

,RAMPAGE572,2013-04-14T19:00Z,I installed this crack/update but for some reason now when I go to the options menu i can only select graphics options from preset and custom - very low and low settings..... umm wtf
,Toperharrier,2013-04-15T23:28Z,@jflch1 You clearly have no clue at all. Just stop posting so people realize you are an idiot. Get a life and couple it with a new antivirus.
