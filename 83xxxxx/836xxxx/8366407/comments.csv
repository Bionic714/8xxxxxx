Would be great if those who downloaded the previous torrent would make a re-check and continue with this torrent. Sorry for inconvenience. Cheers."

[H],EverybodyLies,2013-04-13T02:22Z,"^^^^^

It would be nice if you stopped with such comments."
,VideoLeech,2013-04-15T12:02Z,"I really wish you hadn't merged the episodes; the show doesn't rotate three-episode story arcs to justify this.

A particular bummer considering the specs are fantastic."
[V],HighCode,2013-04-15T13:21Z,"You're very welcome.
Everybody with his own wishes, you don't like it get them somewhere else, I don't force anybody to dl them.
This is how I like them period. I share what I have and like not what other's ""wishes"" are."
[V],HighCode,2013-04-15T13:34Z,"Nobody said a thx, just moaning and moaning, for that I removed it from seedbox and fair well, have fun sharing between your selves....
I seeded over 30 ratio, everyone seems to H&R and forgets to leave a thx or quality related  comment. Ignorant bitches, well, I can be ignorant too."
,VideoLeech,2013-04-16T07:52Z,"HighCode, your reaction to my comment was harsh. I didn't mean any disrespect, I was simply expressing my personal disappointment with how you chose to upload this file; just as you like to watch a show in a certain way, so do I.

150 leechers where in obvious disagreement with me."
,Cinczer,2013-04-16T22:22Z,thanks man i've been waiting for this!
,SaTaNiK1,2013-04-17T06:35Z,"Yeah, merging of episodes is a huge pain for me to add to my XBMC. I am downloading the original Blu-rays and will encode it myself if seeds hold up on BitHQ. Don't know when I will upload them though. You all might very well have to wait till August. I have a lot of other things to upload."
,eviltrrnt,2013-04-26T03:48Z,S04 E19-22 has error and will not play...
[V],HighCode,2013-04-27T08:42Z,"@eviltrrnt
I tested all files before I made the torrent.
If you couldn't play that particular file you couldn't play any other file because all are encoded with the same settings. 
Also I merged the BD files before I encoded them so no merging issue should occur.
You're very welcome eviltrrnt, I'm so glad you enjoy the free stuff..."

,frailwordscollapse,2013-05-02T22:04Z,Accidentally posted the comment twice...my bad...
,williamballs,2013-05-27T22:16Z,"Its great to have standardized 1080p for all seasons, thanks for the up

One question, is the video level 5.0 or 5.1? I was hoping for 4.1 myself"
