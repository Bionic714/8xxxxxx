Notes:
~ I found 20 min too short and irritating, the episodes are very addictive (to me at least)
so I merged 3ep-s in one, 1H 5 min to watch in one go. It's a lot cosier so.
~ End-credits removed (very annoying to hear the same tune again and again)
but the last episodes of each Season are kept. About 1GB saved.
~ S1.ep 10 source got some weird error @ 19min 18 sec and had to cut out about 40 sec. No subs after that. It's toward the end so won't "hurt" so much.
