Ragnar's warband returns in triumph to Kattegat, where the Earl confiscates the plundered riches except for one piece per man. Ragnar picks the distraught Athelstan and returns home. The monk's faith and his vow of chastity perplex Ragnar, but Ragnar gathers useful intelligence about the kingdom of Northumbria. On that basis, Earl Haraldson authorizes another raid on England. Now accompanied by Lagertha and the Earl's trustee Knut, Ragnar re-embarks post-haste, leaving Athelstan to mind the farm and the children. As the Vikings set foot on English soil, they are met by the local sheriff and a handful of armsmen, who invite the newly landed "traders" to meet King Aelle. Ragnar agrees, but his other warriors' distrust incites a battle, in which the Northumbrians are slaughtered.
