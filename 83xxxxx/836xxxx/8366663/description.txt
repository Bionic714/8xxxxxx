The book concludes with a look at what life means for nonbelievers. Understanding the world is an entirely different problem from dealing with the world, and this section recommends attitudes that can be beneficial in a world where the veil has been lifted by the power of reason. In the end, it is found that false hopes are replaced by a newfound sense of realistic possibilities and a greater understanding of the human condition.
