[T],Totenkruez,2013-04-22T06:06Z,"Yes, you don't need the directly previous version to update. You can even update from a fresh install.

Games usually leave your saves untouched if you decide to uninstall them. There may be an option to delete your saves, but such things are usually left off by default. In any case, you could just make a backup copy of your saves."
