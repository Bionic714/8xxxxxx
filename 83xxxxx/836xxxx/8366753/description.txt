Bryan Singer returns to direct this big screen sequel. Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), Wolverine (Hugh Jackson), and the Academy for Gifted Youngsters, aka the X-Men, find themselves in the firing line after a failed assassination attempt on the President points the finger at the school. It was in fact the mysterious teleporter Nightwalker (Alan Cumming) who ordered it, and, in an attempt to clear their names, the X-Men are led into a trap set by the evil William Stryker (Brian Cox) - a mysterious scientist apparently working for the government. As it soon becomes evident that Stryker's agenda is to destroy all mutants, the X-Men need to call in the help of many of their old friends and foes, including Magneto (Ian McKellen), if they are to stop him.
