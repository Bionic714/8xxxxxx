Enter a new era of the Soulfire mythology with the debut of Soulfire: Chaos Reign #0! Aspen artist Marcus To adds his penciling prowess to this tale of lands lost, untamed magic, and unspeakable terror. Vicious creatures rule the day, but an even deadlier predator stalks the night. As one lone tribe of warriors struggle to stay alive, this new evil presence delivers a killer welcome. With the death toll rising and comrades missing, revenge takes over and a journey is planned. A journey deep into the bowels of the jungle, that will lead them face to face with a horror never before seen in this land. One that could mean the end of all existence and the beginning of Chaos Reign.
