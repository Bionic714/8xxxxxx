,rahulgr8888,2013-04-26T20:19Z,What about its subtitles? English?
,aSToViRuS,2013-04-27T12:57Z,Looking at the filenames I guess it has no subtitles. Please use (for example) http://www.opensubtitles.org/en/ssearch/sublanguageid-eng/idmovie-145250 to look for them
,dib_tpb,2013-05-02T06:55Z,Thanks!
,shanebb,2013-05-19T03:13Z,"The text is in German.
So the text messages are in German.

AVOID!!!!!!"
,bgruthless,2013-05-25T05:28Z,"Agreed.  Unless you speak German this is worthless.  There are multiple text message conversations that are presented on screen in German that are vital to the plot.

Without subs for these this is a waste of a download."
