,aaron250689,2013-04-18T00:54Z,Oh and Yes all Expansions OP and TOV are on this Game Apart from being unable to set a LAN game! works perfect
,repayfriendship,2013-04-19T07:40Z,"Jesus Christ!  Thank you HeroMaster.  Hopefully this one works.  I have an official downloaded version from Steam.  However, there is some kind of glitch.  So it is nice that there is a backup."
,Pogie4,2013-04-22T13:29Z,Before I download this.. does this have Tales of Valor?
,lelouch.geas,2013-04-22T18:33Z,Does LAN work??
,repayfriendship,2013-04-23T05:28Z,"Jesus Christ!  I looked at BestBuy and it looks like they have it in stock two months down the line.  It is expensive at $59.99 plus tax for a digital version.  If I had the money, I would buy the deluxe disc version for $99.99 plus tax from BestBuy as long as it is family oriented.  No blood.  No violence.  Just peace.  "
,repayfriendship,2013-04-23T20:04Z,Jesus Christ!  The beta Steam version does not work on Microsoft Windows XP HOME with SP2 using NVIDIA Geforce FX 5200 AGP 8x 256MB on an eMachines T3104 with a PS/2 mouse and PS/2 keyboard displayed using NEC LCD1920NX.
,repayfriendship,2013-04-23T20:34Z,Jesus Christ!  The official version is tested working on Microsoft Windows Vista Home Premium (french 32-bit edition).  It works on a MacBook Pro (early 2011).  DYNEX USB wireless mouse is nice.  It needs right and left click.
,Daboor,2013-05-11T18:04Z,hey guys the game doesn't work on Windows 8 the install just keeps on the 3 soldiers pic and nothing happens (I tried compatibility mode for xp and w7) pls help any suggestions.
,glata10,2013-05-25T15:53Z,@Daboor No offense but just get Win7 or something else because Win8 just sucks.
,OneBadBasterd,2013-05-30T03:28Z,"Thanks for the up HeroMaster !

I just hope people will help seeding someday...

Seriously it's not even funny downloading @100-200kbs...."
