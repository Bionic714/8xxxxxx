i think the 3rd book is the assassin's creed comic that someone on here made 500 requests for! i believe that i used to see a request for it every week. if so, hope he/she gets this!!

hey blackcanary, can you find strange attractors #1-5? the 5th issue just came out (on comixology, anyway) from archaia this week."
