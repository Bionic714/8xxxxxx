When expatriate "Griff" returned to the states after 16 years in

Europe, he enjoyed the recognition Dexter had previously experienced.




When these two "battle" it is really more of a lovefest than any 

form of competition.  The sound of them playing the same note with 

their thick sounds has serious GIRTH......."flanged" without any FX

boxes in sight.


Eddie Jefferson adds vocals with his own lyrics on (2) of these 

(5) tracks.


Oddly the CD indicates MONO but the "FI" is excellent.



GREAT ENCOUNTERS INDEED!
