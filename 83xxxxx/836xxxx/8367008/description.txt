This is a virtual machine to go along with the book @ https://tpb.ipredator.se/torrent/8219818/Enterprise_Linux_System_Administration_by_GURU_LABS_-[-PigeonMas  
There are tons of different labs to do, and they are all set up for you already. This should work on any OS, because it is a VM. You can add this as an appliance, or just add it as a virtual hard drive. I hope you enjoy!
