Kirsty Cotton (Ashley Laurence) is committed to a psychiatric hospital run by the strange Dr. Channard. But when the doctor uncovers the secret of the Lament Configuration, he resurrects the skinless corpse of Kirsty's evil stepmother (Claire Higgins) and calls forth the legions of the damned led by Pinhead (Doug Bradley). Now, the doorway to Hell has been re-opened, the brutal Cenobites again walk the earth and the sweet suffering of evil has only just begun.
