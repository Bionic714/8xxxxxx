,Knan4051,2013-04-13T21:47Z,Thanks. For anyone wonder the video bit rate is 1550 Kbps. Unfortunately I can't tell the difference between this and mRS's rip that has a bit rate of 566 Kbps (because its animated). I wish Loadstone did 720p rips of more shows
,Knan4051,2013-04-13T21:55Z,Actually is this the uncompressed version downloaded from iTunes? doubt I'll get an answer but what the hell
[T],loadstone2k12,2013-04-14T01:41Z,"@Knan4051 This is a reencode. The type of compression is in the video description, in this case a 1-pass constant quality encoding optimized for Playstation 3."
