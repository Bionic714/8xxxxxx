Earl Haraldson's raiders assault Ragnar's settlement, killing all they can get hold of. Ragnar, Lagertha, Athelstan and the children narrowly escape in a boat, but Ragnar is severely wounded; he is saved from drowning by Athelstan. The family hide in Floki's house, where the shipwright and Helga slowly nurse Ragnar back to health. Meanwhile, Earl Haraldson marries his daughter Thyri to a rich old Svealander against his wife Siggy's wishes. Knowing that the Earl has Ragnar's friends watched, Rollo offers his services to Haraldson. The Earl feigns acceptance, but Siggy's warning to Rollo is too late: Haraldson has Rollo seized and tortured in an unsuccessful attempt to discover Ragnar's whereabouts. As Torstein brings word of this to the still-weak Ragnar, he sends Floki to challenge the Earl to single combat.
