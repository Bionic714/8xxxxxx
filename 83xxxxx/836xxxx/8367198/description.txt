this works for error message showing " windows running non-core edition"
follow these steps...
1. run command prompt as admin.
2. type in " sfc/scannow" and "restart"
3. again run cmd as admin and type in "slmgr.vbs/rilc"
4. then run the activator provided.....

you are done.. windows 8 will get activated for lifetime...

if it doesn't , I deeply apologize..... n cheers...
