,niveaformen,2013-04-12T23:03Z,Will this work for me to install if I have no key and have you tried this on another computer before uploading?
,lolzob,2013-04-13T09:28Z,"In this torrent you will find a file .info , where they are serial numbers.
But it this windows, you can skip the activation step.
So do you put serial number or skip this step.
For Activation use KMSnano, you find in this torrent.
All windowsurile uploaded by me are verified in the virtual machine."

,bossmj,2013-04-14T00:52Z,"Admins, please explore blocking sonic_27.  Incredibly prickly personality that is quite irritating in the comments he/she/it makes."
,bossmj,2013-04-14T05:31Z,"Incidentally in reponse to the conversation about .NET feature, in Windows 8, .NET 3.5, 3.0 and 2.5 come with the OS, you just have to enable them."
,lolzob,2013-04-14T12:59Z,"@Sonic_27
Not irritate the people with your comments and do not talk nonsense if you know nothing. If you want to advertise to murphy78 go somewhere else, on the forum.
Difference what I do and murphy78 is:
murphy78 It capture install.wim, for integrate all updaturile and replace the old install.wim (original from Microsoft) the newly created him.
In return I do not replace install.wim (still like the original from Microsoft).
I appreciate the work that I do murphy78 and respect him."
,Sonic_27,2013-04-14T17:51Z,"@lolzob

First off I know more than you know and second off I know NOT to get your torrents!! All I'm saying is that I dl your torrent and checked for updates and still about 15 updates had to be still installed and when I went to install my oem logo it ask me to install Net framework!! Maybe I'm just use to murphy78 torrents that all of that is integrated already. Oh well..."
,bluebuury,2013-04-14T19:04Z,I can't wait to try this torrent! It seems like an ease to install according to some users. Is this a legit copy of Windows 8?
,lolzob,2013-04-14T23:40Z,"@bluebuury
with confidence install this torrent is original and trusted"
,lolzob,2013-04-15T00:06Z,"@Sonic_27
I do not want to get into polemic with you, I explained what makes colleague and what I do.
After I saw your the declarations here and elsewhere are a fan of a specific Usser.
We all want original windows, and why I'm here.

P.S.
I do not think you know more about integrating updates, as you say!
Good luck further and not take people into error, because I report the admin!"
,lolzob,2013-04-15T00:18Z,"I said what I have to say.
I need to talk to people if it's good or this torrent!"
