Hebrew is the language of God.God spoke the world into being through his "Word". These Hebrew words were made by putting together Hebrew letters.To learn Chemistry, it is important to learn the periodic table.To learn about God and the Bible, it is important to learn some Hebrew.

In the Western world, we study the Bible in English.If you want to get closer to God, studying the Hebrew letters will bring you closer.

The Hebrew Alphabet is made up of 22 letters.Learn the letters of the Bible and you can start to learn the words of the Bible.When you study the Bible from a Hebrew perspective-all sorts of Hidden Treasures will be revealed to you.

In the English Bible- Rev 1:11 "I am the Alpha and Omega"-that is Greek.Is our God Greek? Our God is the King of the Jews. He really said, "I am the Aleph and Tav".

Consider that the word Alphabet comes from the 1st Hebrew letters "Aleph and Beit". Hebrew is the first language.

This study will focus on the 2nd Hebrew letter-Beit. Make a copy of the El Shaddai notes, they go along with the video. If you start at 1 minute into video, it finishes up Aleph and then goes into Beit. The 2 other videos offer some info. But El Shaddai is the best source to go to first.

All the El Shaddai videos and notes are free to anyone by going to the El Shaddai ministries website.Then scroll down and click on ARCHIVES.Then you look through the past teaching.It takes some searching.

 I am just trying to make it easier for more people to share this information. I encourage you to share this with others and support El Shaddai ministries, if you can.

I pray that these lessons will bring you "Truth" and "Understanding".

Please leave a comment if you find these lessons helpful.If there is interest, I will add more lessons. 

There are dark days coming to this world. I believe we must be a blessing to Israel for God to bless us. Be weary of people who think they have replaced the Jews or want to persecute the Jews.
