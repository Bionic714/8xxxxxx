TIME'S Green Century HERO Scheer [txt] Solar Economy -  ScanSoft Daniel reads


Note frome Start Loving.  Sheer is A German do-er, amongst a sea of American auth-whores - McKibben, Gore, Lester Brown, even Derrik Jensen it seems,  and lip-server extraordinaire, Joe Romm, my beloved brothers all.  

The exceptions to this rule being the author activists Diane Wilson of Sea Drift Texas, and Dr. Jim Hansen of NASA.  I'll be eternally grateful for their putting their bodies where their books are - in front of the unfolding ecocide, as Hermann Sheer did the same.

THOSE CLUELESS TO THE PLANETARY EMERGENCY OF IMPENDING ECOCIDE SHOULD GO ELSEWHERE.  These uploads were created for me, to equip me to Wage All-out Unviolent War for my current and future 204 billion children.  If you are looking for style over substance this site and these materials are not for you.

ALSO, CUT ME SOME SLICK.  THIS UPLOAD WAS PREPARED ON 04.11.13, THIS DAY 14 OF MY 'ECOCIDE'S DEATH FAST, ZERO CALORIES,' RACING TO FINISH THIS PROJECT SO I CAN ABSTAIN FROM LIQUIDS AS WELL BY MIDNIGHHT SUNDAY NIGHT. GOOGLE 'start loving.' Also GOOGLE, 'tracking plan b'  So, I'm working with a 23,400 calorie deficit, and a sleep deficit the last 4 days of near 8 hrs x 4 = 32 hours, so I can get this done, before I am.  (Hmmm, you too are this committed to averting ecocide so out kids and grandkids have a Life, like you and I did, right?)

OH! A final note.  This project, on now a 4 day near zero sleep sprint, may be A. one of the wonders of human endurance, or B. full of technical disasters, errors....  I've devoted my life to have it be the former.  If it is the latter, ROFL, I WON'T BE AROUND FOR YOU TO WHINE AT, RIDICULE, BLAME!!!!  FIX IT, BUILD ON IT. DO YOUR PART!  UnviolentPeacemaker

Hermann Scheer
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Hermann Scheer (2008)
Member of Parliament
for Social Democrat member of the German Bundestag (Parliament)
Personal details
Born 	29 April 1944 (age 68)
Died 	October 14, 2010
Political party 	Social Democrat
Occupation 	a Social Democrat member of the German Bundestag (Parliament)
President of Eurosolar (The European Association for Renewable Energy)

Hermann Scheer (April 29, 1944 to October 14, 2010) was a Social Democrat member of the German Bundestag (Parliament), President of Eurosolar (The European Association for Renewable Energy) and General Chairman of the World Council for Renewable Energy.[1] In 1999, Scheer was awarded the Right Livelihood Award for his "indefatigable work for the promotion of solar energy worldwide".[2]

Scheer believed that the continuation of current patterns of energy supply and use will be environmentally damaging, with renewable energy being the only realistic alternative. Scheer had concluded that it is technically and environmentally feasible to harness enough solar radiation to achieve a total replacement of the foclear (fossil/nuclear) energy system by a global renewable energy economy. The main obstacle to such a change is seen to be political, not technical or economic.[2] In 1999 he was one of the initiators of the German feed-in tariffs that were the major source of the rise of renewable energies in Germany during the following years.
