Thanks for all the uploads! I especially enjoy the Queensnake ones. I have never made a request before, and I don't like asking of the powers that be, but I can't find ""Pump up the nettle"" from Queensnake anywhere. Could you please upload it? 

I would greatly appreciate it, and thanks once again for all the awesome videos and dedication!
