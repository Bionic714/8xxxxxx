Information
------------------------------

The Blood of the Rose is film about the life and death of Joan Root, a wildlife filmmaker turned conservationist who was murdered while trying to save Lake Naivasha, the only fresh water lake in Kenya and the centre of the cut flower industry. Flowers, particularly red roses for Valentine's Day, are Kenya's second largest export and the flower farms are both directly and indirectly responsible for the environmental destruction of the lake and the industrialisation of the area. Joan Root's story ┬û and in particular, an investigation into her death - offers a narrative that provokes all kinds of questions about the environment, globalisation, consumerism, and the West's troubled relationship with Africa.
