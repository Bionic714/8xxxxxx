Gnomoria is a sandbox village management game where you help lead a small group of gnomes, who have set out on their own, to thrive into a bustling kingdom! Anything you see can be broken down and rebuilt elsewhere. Craft items, build structures, set traps and dig deep underground in search of precious resources to help your gnomes survive the harsh lands. Build your kingdom and stockpile wealth to attract wandering gnomads to your cause, but be wary of also attracting enemies! 

Gnomoria v0.8.35

General

-Import/Export Professions
-When importing Professions, old Professions with the same name will update to the new one.  Gnomes with old professions that don't exist in the new Profession settings will get a custom profession similar to changing settings directly on the gnome.
-Updated the following windows to be resizable: Gnome, Workshop, Butcher Shop, Market Stall
-Build job names are more specific, ie "Build Carpenter" instead of "Build Workshop" and "Build table" instead of "Build Construction"
-Updated check box check to stand out more
