Also this show looks like it will be good.. but can't DL it right now. "
,tdurden83,2013-04-13T04:32Z,can you plz go into a little more detail? like how much you were fined and how it happened? I don't mean anything really specific. i'm just curious and want to avoid that happening to me if I can
[T],Calypso127,2013-04-13T04:48Z,"His ISP fined him for P2P traffic.

Download a proxy program. "
,oddzero,2013-04-13T05:45Z,@ Calypso127... where do I find one? 
[T],Calypso127,2013-04-13T06:22Z,"I use to use Tor in combination with Privoxy, but that's a complex combination not for the faint of keyboard. Also its run on donated server bandwidth so its not fair to hog it for P2P downloading.

You know a proxy 9 time out of ten will slow your download speed considerably. There are plenty of proxy apps on TBP, just do a search. May take some time to learn to use them though."
,NickNX43,2013-04-13T06:42Z,use PeerBlock... its so easy!
,tdurden83,2013-04-13T07:40Z,thx for the suggestions. I thought he meant he got fined by the big boys. are fines from them or isps very common?
[T],Calypso127,2013-04-13T08:20Z,"The ""Big boys"" don't care about mere pirates. But if they did crack down on you they would confiscate your computer/servers and hold you in a cell pending charges and possibly a lawsuit. But you have to be a big boy to get busted by big boys. elsewise they would have to arrest half the country.

most of the ISPs just got forced by the Gov't to punish those caught in the act of piracy. but generally the range of punishment is nothing to worry about. Though a fine sucks, my isp just sends warning letters and never does anything about it. When you get 50Mbps internet they know damn well what your doing with it and they don't care. But there forced to do something about it. I believe Comcast in throttling a well as blocking connections and forcing you to call them to get your internet back.

Honestly I wouldn't even be on TBP if NZBmatrix hadn't been shut down. Usenet is 1000X better than bittorrent

Also I believe PeerBlock is an IP filter which wont help you at all, IP filters are bullshit."
,Sikkwolf,2013-04-13T09:00Z,"Wow Calypso you sure full of shit aren't you? ""IP filters don't do shit?"" That's like saying mirrored paint on your car won't help you avoid getting a ticket. 

IP filters are only as good as the lists you're using, if you're using PB and haven't upgraded from the basic bluetack list you're the problem. As well dumbass, no one is going to get arrested for downloading torrents, nor fined. People who claim they have been are full of shit. They want the guys who run these sites not the peons that consume media from them. Next time you get drunk off your dad's semen go somewhere that people will believe all your bullshit before gaying up the bay even more by contributing your trite nonsense. "
[T],Calypso127,2013-04-13T09:31Z,"Ip filters do nothing to prevent either your ISP or the Gov't from seeing what your doing and or downloading.

Do you really think a stupid little application will stop the gov't from viewing your activities if they really wanted to.

Take your shit talking some place else, if you like IP filters than good for you but an IP filter will not stop this man's ISP from sending him fines and thinking anything else is idiotic.

And yes some ISPs will fine you. I am a trusted member for a reason, I'm trusted. What I type holds truth.

I'm not here to argue with fools who hid behind filters, I'm here to give a member advice. Since I have done just that I conclude my argument"

Recommend downloading this"
,jonaslorik,2013-04-13T19:01Z,considering but dunno if I want to pick this show up o.o
,oddzero,2013-04-13T20:45Z,@ Calypso127 thank you for the advice. I'll try to figure it out.. also sorry for spamming up this thread  EZ o.o. not sure if or how to contact people directly through here. 
,tdurden83,2013-04-13T20:54Z," I don't want to get involved in any shit talking. thx for taking the time to share your advice Calypso, and anyone else that is willing to help me better understand any potential risks. I would really appreciate it. common sense would dictate that they only be interested in the big fish, but I was concerned that they may try ""making examples"" of the little guys from time to time."

LETTERS TELLING ME THAT IF I DON'T STOP DOWNLOADING MOVIES THEY WILL TERMINATE ME FROM USING THEIR CABLE SERVICES.
BOTH MOVIES I DIDN'T EVEN WATCH. BOTH WERE
DOWNLOADED IN THE AFTERNOON BETWEEN 2 & 5PM. ALSO I DIDN'T GET THE ENTIRE MOVIE ON ONE OF THEM. I GUESS THEY DOWNLOAD A MOVIE & COPY ALL THE IPs CONNECTED TO THEM AS THEY DOWNLOAD. THEY HAVE NO PROOF THAT I DOWNLOADED THE WHOLE MOVIE OR NOT. I THINK LATE AT NIGHT MIGHT
BE SAFER BUT I DO REMEMBER ONE THING.
THEY WERE POPULAR MOVIES THAT JUST CAME OUT IN THEATERS & BOTH WERE MADE BY WARNER BROS & LETTERS WERE A COMPLAINT FROM WARNER BROS. I'M NOW USING WIFI. HAS ANYONE BEEN POPPED ON WIFI"

I've got a few of these in the past and moved to IPTorrents (with a friend request from a buddy) but my Synology likes magnets and they don't always count my seeds.
I've never figured out how to avoid these things so I dig the discussion."

,Funk606,2013-04-16T13:58Z,"I got Denmarks biggest fine back in the days, like 10 years + ago, the Danish Anti Pirat Group did send me a Giro Card asking for 105.222,55 USD, within 14 days, telling me in a letter than i could pay 50%, if i signed a letter, and they hade like 50 pages of screenshoots of stuff i did share on a P2P site, old one called ,ahh forgot name, but something with ++ in it, anyways, k i not payed the fine, and like 100 other Danes got huge fines, but only a few morons did pay em, i did just ignore em, they wrote to me for like 1-2 years,after that they gave up getting a $ out of me, but sux if its your ISP, k of the ""closing of your connection"", what country are we talking about? If they was 100% serious about any fines, they would have been at your door already and colletet your PC as proff, as it is now, k the MAC adress will say its u, but Again , you can say u setup a Wireless connection, and dont know anything about security = could b the guy living NeXT door who ""borrowed your bandwidth""! I think they just try and scare you, when i talk with my ISP, the TECH´s always say that they use Utorrent em self, and we talk about settings and shit,so..but its Denmark..and here they gave up fighting people WHO DL stuff for private use,and are now only going after people WHO in huuuuge style DL stuff with a plan to make Money! Evrybody else they leav alone....and in Denmark 95% of population got internet, 50% + is DL stuff with ©, they going to send 1/2 the country fines? Nah.."
,Funk606,2013-04-16T14:32Z,"Oh i remember the name now, it was called DC++, and i did a search, they still use it, lol, its soo old fasion, or was, compared to the hole torrent idee.."
,wadbr,2013-04-17T09:30Z,"DO NOT belive Calypso. 
ISP's need proof to fine you, they get that proof by sending people to download torrents and getting the IPs of the people that downloaded from them, to stop them you need to block their IP address so you won't download from them.
USE AN IP FILTER WITH A GOOD LIST IF YOU ARE IN EU OR US."
,Funk606,2013-04-17T09:45Z,"Final comment, @Calypso127 is right 100%, they did change the laws here in Denmark many years ago, now all ISP got to keep a record of all traffic for (I don't know how long time, but its something like 1/2 -1 year), and as he point out, u need to use your ISP´s as a well lets just call it ""start point"", u cant set up any filters or anything that will do your ISP cant c your traffic, or at least I don't know of any way to do that, I mean even you using a Proxy, unless you find a open WIFI somewhere, your ISP will still log your traffic or what Calypso127? Must admit I am rusty when it comes to this point, as I don't have any need for using it...the little I know about proxy software or servers, are that they get your http request, and then look up the DNS, but ads its own IP address as the originating IP, and they can use shitloads of proxy servers on there way to the address u r asking for, to ""mask"" or make it harder for ""others"" to know where the original request comes from, but like I did mention and as Calypso127 also does say, if the government want to know where or who is looked into what ever site, u can do what ever u want, they can and will find u in the end! The problem now is that soooo many DL, hmm how to put it, innocent stuff, that they will have to focus there resources on shit like, yes I don't even want to use the words, but u know where they main focus is, so all us little guys that Dl a movie or MP3 song now and then, well if they should spend resources on that, I mean OMG, we talking military budget! So I think that as long you don't visit stupid sites, or set up a huge business, where you make $$$$$, you can surf and DL your MP3 song in peace, I might be wrong, and rules are different from country to country, or what do you think @Calypso127? Do they have time or even want to go after each and every one of us DL a movie or MP3 song? Don't you also believe there focus is at other arrears? Well ? is not just to @C, what do the rest of you think? I mean just look at how many is online at this site, how much would it cost em to bring us all 2 court and prosecute us? The problem with the software I used , well its more than 10 years ago, more like 15 years ago, DC++ you had to share x GB of stuff to join one of there ""Groups"", and then everybody could DL a list of what people did share, like if I was bored and not looking for anything special, I did DL a list of what a guy did share, if he hade something good on he´s list, I did order it, and DL it, but that was the biggest weakness of the program, as the Danish Anti Pirat group did just DL a list of what I was sharing, and back in those days, lets just say that if they send me a fine of 100000$, you can imagine that I did share a ""bit"", k the more you did share, the better groups you could access! Groups would set up min. shares, like some Groups u did need to share 50-100GB b4 you could log into then... I really hope they made some huge changes to that program, as I saw you could still DL a copy of it, hehe"
