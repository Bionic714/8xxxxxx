,okch,2013-04-14T06:52Z,"Doesn't work for me.  Asking for serial and I tried 4 valid ones and I still get the ""not valid"" error..."
[T],ILPruny,2013-04-14T11:46Z,"WMP 11 SUCKS , i use wmp10 and it works like a charm. "
,Antraxy,2013-04-14T15:06Z,"1. WMP10 has security holes.
2. WMP10 is not better than WMP11 it's the other way around. Look at the Win7 and Win8 WMP they are based on the WMP11 not WMP10.
3. If you don't like WMP then you should better use another Player like MPC or VNC and keep you PC updated."
,strixoideus,2013-04-14T19:33Z,"cant install, no valid serial key"
[V],ThumperTM,2013-04-15T00:21Z,"XP Serial:
MR49R-DRJXX-M6PX2-V96BF-8CKBJ"
,Rancher0,2013-04-15T00:55Z,"I just tried the serial you posted, ThumperTM, including about ten others, and none of them seems to work. Too bad."
,sturmur,2013-04-15T01:23Z,"This one seems to work. Looks like this copy is 64bit.

,Rancher0,2013-04-16T17:04Z,It works indeed. Thanks!
,Ripm0re,2013-04-16T17:15Z,Am I able to use WintoFlash? 
,Ripm0re,2013-04-16T17:21Z,Does this work with Win2Flash?
,Ripm0re,2013-04-16T19:13Z,"Well it wont let me install because I am unable to Locate the Serial ATA or SATA configuration section, in my bios. Anybody have any ideas?"
,FastBrad,2013-04-22T21:26Z,I was able to install this and it is in fact a 32 bit version although it is not Activated using this serial C4FPJ-HQCGP-QD3XC-2JF34-FT8Y6
,Ravenak2,2013-04-23T19:47Z,Why are you saying Windows Messenger and IE6 were removed if it's not the case?
,Ravenak2,2013-04-23T19:48Z,"Also, activation doesn't work. Bad work!"
,Ravenak2,2013-04-24T02:13Z,"Could you at least provide an activation tool, so that we don't have to reinstall the whole thing..."
,marlborolyts,2013-05-03T12:56Z,thank you very much!!! 
,apcoelho,2013-05-06T18:44Z,Thumper how do i activate this Windows XP? When I installed says I have 60 days to activate
,feitian,2013-05-09T06:17Z,i burn to cd-rom but it cannot see my HDD -- pavilion dv4t. i tried a recent windows xp black edition ( http://thepiratebay.sx/user/LuxLOL/ ) and it works well
,feitian,2013-05-09T06:25Z,"Thanks, it works. BTW, i think for my 4gb ram computer, staying with 32-bit os is still better because those 64-bit kernel+applications require 1,.5~2 times of ram comparing with the same 32-bit versions."
,D255,2013-05-11T16:58Z,"ThumperTM;

,menda_3,2013-05-20T18:28Z,"WTF man!!
This windows includes wml9, windows messenger, ie6, and you are saying that they are removed.
