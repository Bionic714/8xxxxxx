And may I know what will be the next to be uploaded? I was hoping for Drive Angry since you mentioned about uploading it after the Fast and Furious series.

Thank you!"

@dhjudasx:

I too requested u Drive angry a long time ago. This drive angry was on your movie list that was posted u in some of your torrent's comment section and later it has been deleted by u or someone. Do u have Jurassic.Park.Trilogy.1993-2001, Transporter trilogy and mission impossible trilogy. Do u have any website like yify has? so i can know what new and old movies u have right now."
