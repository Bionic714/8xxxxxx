,ChivveZ,2013-04-15T05:28Z,Welcome! :)
,URUNicoM,2013-04-27T19:57Z,"""HD"" means 720p (=1280x720p resolution). This is not 720p at all. Please fix the title as it is misleading"
,Mark_NUTT,2013-05-09T04:08Z,That's not true. People always think HD is 720p minimum. 480p is considered HD. Youtube just doesn't mark it that way so people think it isn't HD.
,brsoares,2013-05-24T23:09Z,"actually 480p is just Enhanced Definition, not High Defition"
,PrincessNuria,2013-06-07T15:53Z,Awesome rip! Exactly what I was looking for. Thank you ChivveZ! I will seed for as long as I can. (:
