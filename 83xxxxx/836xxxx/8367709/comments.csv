,ewtbmm,2013-04-15T22:15Z,Unable to view quite a few of these pics. Using IRfanview. Any suggestions? It closes out IRfanview.
,haggis_masher2,2013-04-24T11:24Z,The reason for your pic problems is the length of the file name. Move the folder to C:Temp and edit the longest filenames. I delete the first 22 chars of every file and they all display perfectly
