I've been really looking forward to this video and just recently got into the arcade collecting hobby when I have spare time (so far only MAME, but still refurbishing old cabinets with real monitors nonetheless!) I think the community is so awesome and I wasn't even alive in the 80's when these games were released. Expect a donation from me soon (I also am a college student in film... So I should love this move haha)"
