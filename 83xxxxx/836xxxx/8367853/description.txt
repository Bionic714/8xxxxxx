Imagine.....A TR compilation which doesn't include HELLO IT'S ME, BANG

THE DRUM.....,or CAN WE STILL BE FRIENDS?


TODD RUNDGREN is the Stanley Kubrick of "Pop/Rock" music.  He does it all.


Most of these 16 tracks are vinyl "rips" but the last 2 tracks are

analog (mini TRS) out of a PC.  Tracks 9 and 10 were at first from 

cassette tape but I later splurged on the CD to reduce noise.


Track #6 is from one of the many fine LPs Todd produced for other 

bands...in this case he also wrote the tune (TUBES LP Remote Control

1979)


Tracks # 15 and 16 were recorded for a Daryl Hall music series (Live

from Daryl's House) and was recorded at the Rundgren residence on 

Kauai. During the intro to the episode fellow Philly native Daryl says 

something like ".....Todd goes his own way."

That hits it......who else would list Gilbert and Sullivan light

opera as an influence.  Track #13 is Todd's contribution to

RAP.  It grew on me; sometime after the initial shock of it.

Todd's lyrics are about as pithy as pop lyrics get this side of 1950.


The unique guitar voicing on some of these are certainly Todd's own

inventions as were the unusual drum sounds on his earlier LPs.

Total involvement....He wouldn't like this


   


Before getting religion (aka JAZZ) Todd was a regular on my turntable 

along with Zappa and Procol Harum.     Now I'M irregular
