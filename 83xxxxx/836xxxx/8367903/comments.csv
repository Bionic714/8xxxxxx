if universe was made who made the god!?! they never ask this.. its stupid believing in god

but they wrote him out of the history books sadly

this thing about satellites losing time proving einstein correct is wrong.. it could easy be electromagnetic forces acting on the nuclear clocks at sub atomic levels and light bending around a sun from a star experiment also could have other reasons for it.. not gravity

people get so stuck in what they are told"
