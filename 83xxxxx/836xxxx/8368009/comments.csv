,deadcow1,2013-04-13T16:56Z,"incredible series. I was cheering for the romans until the very end. debauchery , orgies and luxury lived to see another couple of hundred years. thank gods."
,morinoravenberg,2013-04-13T18:46Z,"fuck the romans!in the words of spartacus:'blood demands blood'..this was a losing battle from the beginning,but the victory lies within giving the romans a slave boot in their asses reminding them thata proud human being will either die free or live like a wothless slave."
,SikDuc,2013-04-13T18:58Z,"Thanks for the upload! A10 V10
What a lame ass Finale! Let's all get a group hug going and shed a few tears. Glad they ended this series... friggen 'tear jerker'!"
,Diabolixxx,2013-04-13T19:53Z,"One of the best series finales I've seen, even though I'm sad that it came to an end, the feeling of a well done conclusion was definitely there."
,Helldiver-SB2C,2013-04-14T00:28Z,"Excellent series! Watching Manu Bennet in ""Arrow"" now,  great actor. Didn't care for Naevia's replacement, but it was tough watching Gannicus die ... he would have much rather died in combat. Show didn't stick to History much, but where they did it was entertaining enough. Spartacus's body was never found or identified? Crixus was a Gaul, Spartacus a Thracian, what was Gannicus?"
,eferecto,2013-04-14T00:56Z,i want to ask why upon i click to download there are no seeders is there something wrong with the torrent...kindly help me.... thanks...
,nekrofora,2013-04-14T01:41Z,"spartacus one more Great Greek

respect Greece "
,jimimetis,2013-04-14T03:37Z,"That was really a great show, although not really historical like HBO's Rome but very nice. Specially since the show itself was a challenge.

@ nekrofora: you are mistaking, thrace is thrace and greece was no part of it, although they have close history, the only nation to invades thrace before rome was macedonia."
,nekrofora,2013-04-14T21:54Z,"@jimimetis: Thrace,Macedonia,Creta were Greeks they all spoke Greek but at that time Greece was separated in many tribes but that doesnt change the fact that they were all Greeks (ELLHNES) "
,eferecto,2013-04-14T23:24Z,thank you so much....asap(ettv) your the best...and thanks yo all seeders...i'll miss spartacus (series)

Helldiver-SB2C: i think Gannicus was a norseman? Just guessing based on his tattoo"
,Das_Hoff,2013-04-15T07:51Z,"@Helldiver-SB2C: the show actually stuck to the historical narrative surprisingly accurately, in the major plot points"
,Calumbiran,2013-04-15T11:08Z,thanks for the up!
,Bunstuff,2013-04-15T19:01Z,"Apparently all it takes is a little bit of titty, and tje odd softcore shag, to involve the functionally illiterate in a TV series to the extent where they beging argiung about it's ""historical accfuracy"".

Historical? Accuracy?? Bwaaaaa-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-haaaaa!!"
