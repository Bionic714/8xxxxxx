The much-anticipated album from the brilliant young American cellist marks one of the most exciting Decca Classics debuts in many years.

Doubly exciting is the participation of conductor Daniel Barenboim a fervent supporter of Alisa Weilersteins extraordinary talent since their 2010 Europa Concert in Oxford, in which Alisa Weilerstein gave a searing account of the Elgar Concerto.

Alisa Weilerstein is the first cellist for many years to play the Elgar Concerto with Daniel Barenboim, and his decision to record it with her is a major statement.

Elgars Concerto is brought together with a contemporary masterpiece Alisa Weilersteins homage to the doyen of American composers, centenarian Elliott Carter.

Already feted as one of todays top international soloists, Alisa Weilersteins career recently reached new critical heights, following the award of a Genius Grant by the MacArthur Foundation. In the citation it was stated: Alisa Weilerstein is a young cellist whose emotionally resonant performances of both traditional and contemporary music have earned her international recognition . . . a consummate performer, combining technical precision with impassioned musicianship.
