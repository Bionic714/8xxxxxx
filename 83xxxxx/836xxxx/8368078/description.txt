"The Storm Before the Calm"

Penny insists that she's fine after her
breakup with Pete, but the gang begin to
wonder when she writes a play entitled "Black
Plague: A Love Story" and asks Derrick and
his theater group to stage it. They brace for
"drama" in more ways than one. Meanwhile a
marketing group asks Alex and Max to be
tastemakers, but is it a scam?
