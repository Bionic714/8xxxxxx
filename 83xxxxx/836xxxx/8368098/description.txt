Brief Synopsis:
David Lynch's masterpiece with all deleted scenes reincorporated.

Intention:
To give viewers an extended experience of Blue Velvet.

Additional Notes:
Two of the deleted scenes I did trim for this edit. It seemed that these two scenes basically had Lynch set up a camera and told the performers to just do whatever. I did include the unaltered versions as a special feature.
