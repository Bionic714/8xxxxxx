Game Info

Final Fantasy Origins will feature both Final Fantasy
I and Final Fantasy II on a single disc for the
Playstation console. The games have been completely
revamped in terms of graphics, gameplay, music, and
storyline. New difficulty modes will also be added,
with an "easy" mode for beginners and a "hard" mode
for experts.

Opening and ending FMVs have been added to the game,
as well as an option for viewing them at any time
after finishing the game. An art gallery featuring
Yoshitaka Amano's sketches, a bestiary containing
information on defeated monsters, and a quick-save
option are among the already confirmed extras. Expect
to see other extras similar to those found in Final
Fantasy Chronicles or Final Fantasy Anthology in this
new package.
