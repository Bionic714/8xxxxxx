The Earl accepts Ragnar's challenge, and the two meet in single combat. Ragnar kills Haraldson, Rollo kills Svein, and Siggy kills her hapless son-in-law. After Ragnar is acclaimed as Earl, he grants his dead foe a chieftain's burial at sea, and Athelstan is revolted to see a slave agree to follow her master in death. In the following winter, Lagertha is pregnant again, Athelstan learns the Viking tale of Ragnarök, and Siggy accepts Rollo's protection and his proposal to marry an earl – himself. As spring beckons, three of Ragnar's ships sail up the River Tyne. After throwing the luckless Wigea into a snake pit, King Aelle prepares to meet the raiders in battle.
