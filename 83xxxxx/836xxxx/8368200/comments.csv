Any YMAA material is highly appreciated!! :)"
,Necromimetic,2013-05-18T20:32Z,"When I tried to watch this it kicked up a lot of artifacts. I ran it through DVD-RB and DVD Shrink, they both kicked up a lot of errors. What did you use to rip this dvd and what was the possibility of corrupt/missing files during the process?"
,thespiritofthis,2013-05-23T13:13Z,I have downloaded several files of this torrent but like the comment above says i am having video and audio lagging issues to the point that i cannot understand what is being taught and it seems like the files are corrupt. Uploader please confirm this that should we keep on downloading or not. If the files are really corrupt can you please take some time to reupload this torrent because it is a real gem and is a big favor to those who are unable to buy it. Thx. BTW: I just registered to write this comment because i am a Tai Chi Lover. 
,thespiritofthis,2013-05-23T13:25Z,I have not downloaded the complete torrent but for what i have downloaded 'The video and audio is all scrambled'. Please confirm if the files are corrupted or not? Whats the pint in downloading corrupt files. Please reupload this gem of a torrent. Many Thx.
,tamahc,2013-05-23T15:53Z,"Guys, I had the same problem, however, as the uploader states, you have to use the VLC player in order to watch, and it has to be the latest version (update it). I havent been able to rip it with DVDShrink, like you, I get errors and scrambled images, the only way to watch it is with the updated version of VLC. Hope this helps..."
,thespiritofthis,2013-05-24T11:29Z,Cool advice man! Issue resolved... Your comment means a lot. One Love.
,udstealth,2013-05-27T22:18Z,"Sorry for the late reply. I could not rip the DVD so I just directly copied the contents from DVD to hard drive, created a torrent and uploaded it. I can only play it on VLC though.

I have used WinX DVD Ripper in order to get only the video, but that loses the chapter markers. So I opted for leaving the DVD files and everything as is."
,Garrone,2013-06-08T10:36Z,"YMAA DVD's have CSS copy protection. The artifacts are from it. To remove it and be able to rip the DVD you need to have a program like AnyDVD running that decodes it. I didn't try if it works for files copied directly yet, i'll see after I get the torrent."
