I still have my original Space 1999 comics somewhere in the house after all these years. Great TV Show, great comics."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-14T01:03Z,you're welcome phoenixgenesis. you should post a follow-up comment about whether or not you like the job Blam! has done remastering them as current digital comics.
