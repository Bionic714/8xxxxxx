,cipherpunks,2013-04-13T07:42Z,1.62Gb are you nuts? This is an hour of talk show. I've seen compressed 1080p feature films that were smaller than this.

Thanks for the up. "
,robert342,2013-04-13T15:17Z,This is the right size if you want to watch it on a large monitor. Thank you so much.
,ItsASpork,2013-04-14T06:23Z,@cipher there are plenty of other options if you prefer a smaller file size. A lot of us like to be able to watch in fullscreen with decent quality though. 
,TheBly13,2013-04-17T03:55Z,"Thanks for uploading an HD version. I use to watch this online on HBO GO and it was 720p streaming, but now most people upload this show in crap 600mb or less rips.

It's well worth the extra space, I love this show, and it deserves to be shown in all it's high def glory."
