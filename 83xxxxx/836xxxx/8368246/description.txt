As most Tommy Keene fans know, the album "Songs From The Film" was essentially recorded twice, first with T-Bone Burnett and Don Dixon producing, and then again, for the version that was ultimately released, with Geoff Emerick producing. Some of the Burnett/Dixon recordings were later released on the "Run Now" vinyl EP. Those tracks, plus a few more outtakes, were then included on the 1998 CD reissue of "Songs From The Film."

These five tunes are recordings from the original sessions that remain unreleased. Four of them were re-recorded for the second version of the album, but none of these particular recordings appear on any officially released version of "Songs From The Film." I believe these are unfinished mixes, as I've heard more polished versions of some of these songs.

From a cassette received in trade in 1984.

Excellent sound quality. Check the samples below. (The slight boost in volume at the beginning of "Call On Me" is on my original tape.)
