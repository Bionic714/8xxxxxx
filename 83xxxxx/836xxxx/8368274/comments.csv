Everything should work fine."
,romellos,2013-04-15T16:49Z,"Hello there mate, thanks for your work! Is it possible to check out also the ""Close Combat: Panthers in the fog"" (from Matrix Games too)?"
,anonymousjerk,2013-04-18T10:42Z,The DWSetupCrack.exe should work with ALL Matrix Games installers (setup.exe). If you have access to a Matrix installer please upload it with DWSetupCrack.exe on PirateBay for all to share. If you have a Matrix title that isn't on TPB please upload it for all. Thanks.
,travick,2013-05-11T12:49Z,I have Close Combat Panthers in the Fog but cannot get this running. Tool you mentioned does work when running setup but once game is started an error comes up saying code is corrupted. No crack anywehere on google.
