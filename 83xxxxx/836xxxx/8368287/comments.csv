,anonymousjerk,2013-04-18T10:42Z,The DWSetupCrack.exe should work with ALL Matrix Games installers (setup.exe). If you have access to a Matrix installer please upload it with DWSetupCrack.exe on PirateBay for all to share. If you have a Matrix title that isn't on TPB please upload it for all. Thanks.

I noticed you had uploaded ""Command Ops-Battles from the Bulge"" about 11 days ago, but the link/url does not work any longer.  Did you remove it for some reason?"
