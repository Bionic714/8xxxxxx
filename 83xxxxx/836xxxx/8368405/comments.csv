,binderguy1,2013-04-13T15:54Z,"Thanks for the ul Dadrkhomr!  Much appreciated.

Since you're a regular over at H33T, is there any chance of you re-seeding FAUST [Gilgamesh} torrent?  I'm stuck at 99.6%

As for the Bittorrent, I thought I was the only one having ""stuck at Checking"" problems.  Is there any way to resolve this without rebooting your computer?"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-13T16:23Z,"here is this week's issue, Secret Service #6  http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8363603/"
,dandadestroyer,2013-04-13T18:15Z,I think the only way for BitTorrent to work properly is to wait for another update like last time.This happened before and they fixed it in about after 5 days.
,dandadestroyer,2013-04-14T05:55Z,"Now it's fixed.
Yay."
,Doordonot,2013-04-21T19:24Z,Thank you for doing this with Marvel. I never understood why DC got the weekly attention!
