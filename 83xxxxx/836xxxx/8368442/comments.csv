Is this the real deal?? Or is it Russian? Russian titles?"

,jarrks,2013-04-17T08:47Z,"It seems that official release date is May 14, 2013.

This version is made from
1080p Blu-ray Remux AVC DTS-HD MA 5.1 - KRaLiMaRKo ...Thanks!
--- which derives from
Cloud.Atlas.2012.1080p.CEE.Bluray.AVC.DTS-HD.MA.5.1.-CSB
--- which has no info about source."
,monkorang,2013-04-17T17:16Z,I finished downloading and can confirm that everything is in english including the city names and credits. There is also no russian audio at all so there's no overlapping effect. Great release!

Appreciate the efforts you people put out to do this for the community."
