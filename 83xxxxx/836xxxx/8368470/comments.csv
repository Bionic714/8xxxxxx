,mantikor777,2013-04-14T03:50Z,Do you have any idea how much our understanding of the Human Body has changed in 50 years?  This is quaint but it is very outdated.
,burt007,2013-04-14T06:19Z,"@mentikor777:
That is the first thought that occurred to me too, but I didn't dare say it, because this guy gnv65 is highly respected here for contributing wonderfull stuff consistently and I also have respect for him."
[V],gnv65,2013-04-16T06:42Z,"You are quite right mentikor777!
But the basic anatomy has not changed, the organs/bones are the same - hence this book is good enough for the beginners/schoolchildren for whom its meant. 
Its definitely not for advanced users!"
