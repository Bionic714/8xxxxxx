,NanoEntity,2013-04-16T08:11Z,"The thing you posted has no new stuff everyone else got.

Please post 75767 version.

In your Steam library, right click on Don't Starve and select Properties
Click on the Betas tab
From the dropdown, select the ""adventuretesting"" branch
type ADVENTUREMODE in the password box and press the ""Check Password"" button. (DON'T PRESS ENTER! IT WILL CLOSE THE WINDOW)
Steam should now say that you have opted into the beta
Close the dialog, and play the game! Your version number should be 75767"
,Dandero,2013-04-17T01:35Z,"Should i have steam installed in order to play the game or what ?

,Fensus,2013-04-21T09:48Z,First time I've double clicked an .exe from pirate bay and had 3 ads popped up. I won't be running it again.
,Khugra,2013-04-22T21:21Z,"Utterly shitty installer.

Can't change install location, and if you try to move it (even though it's named ""portable"") the game no longer works.

Reinstalling fails silently but still gives you the ads page which pops up when you run the installer."
