,dizzie2,2013-04-14T12:31Z,Will the installation of kb 971033 affect windows activation?
[V],murphy78,2013-04-14T12:36Z,Most people who use .net 4 programs would disagree.

[V],murphy78,2013-04-21T00:55Z,An invaluable contribution corey. Way to keep it high-brow.
[V],murphy78,2013-04-21T00:57Z,"page80, I never release anything that you cannot update. Of course, you still have to use your common sense for some things. Like if a kb file mentions ""super genuine validation check"" then obviously you might have a problem, as this is obviously not super-genuine."
