Prager H3: Per usual, callers set the agenda.
 Issues raised include:
 have you noticed the rise in profanity in the left;
 what book do you suggest for a paper on American history;
 what is your take on the femininity of god..
 what do you think the basketball players answers were to the questions 
''how would you fare against someone like Michael Jordan?'';
 if the culture informs behavior as you have said... how does that jive with gay men being born that way.


Prager 20130412  02 Happiness Hour: Expectations

 not expecting too much and being grateful for what you do have..
 is one of the keys to a happier life.
