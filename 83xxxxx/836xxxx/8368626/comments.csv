,Toperharrier,2013-04-13T23:35Z,@erra TS Screener means video from cam recording and audio from other source (normally better than full vid/audio CAM).
,GObonzo,2013-04-15T15:00Z,"""screener"" means it was sent out for screening for awards andor reviews. not that is was recorded by a camera from a screen. these people online are just too fucking stupid and the term has come to mean this by dumbasses."
