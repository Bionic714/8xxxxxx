Chupke Chupke 1975 DVDRip x264 AAC Esubs Phantom

Raghav brags that he can smell a rat or an impersonator automatically, and Dr. Parimal Tripathi decides to take him on - result: funny family slapstick comedy, with a dose of pure Hindi and Urdu thrown in, especially the dialogue delivery by Om Prakash, Dharmendra, and Amitabh Bachchan. Notable songs are :Sare ga ma, ma sa re ga ma...."; "Ab ke sajan sawan me, aag lagegi badan mein, ghata barshegi, magar tarsegi nazar, mil na sakenghe do mahn ek hi aagan mein..."; "Chupke chupke chal di purvaiya, basuri bajaike raas rachaye daiya re daiya, chupke...".

Trivia
Jaya Bhaduri was pregnant during the making of the film. Most of her shots have been taken very carefully, as to avoid her profile view.
Mohd. Rafi has one stanza less in the song 'Sa re ga ma', as he was not present during the dubbing session. Kishore Kumar, who was the other singer, sang the additional stanza.
Hrishikesh Mukherjee wanted newcomers for the parts played by Amitabh Bachchan and Jaya Bhaduri.
