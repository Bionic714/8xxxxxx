This movie is great, and the copy uploaded by Zen_Bud is perfect. Perfect except for the intensely distracting English subs for every line of dialogue.  This is just a stripped down .srt for native English speakers so that they can enjoy the movie while still getting the sections with Farsi translation, setting information, and written epilogue at the end.

Enjoy.
