,egtorraptor,2013-04-13T11:44Z,"^Why are you waiting for footy to upload race torrents? 

These two profiles upload every session 4 hours before footy. Check the dates and times of their uploads. Footy uploads the same torrents as them just 4 hours late.

I use Footy only for shows like this. For races and f1 sessions he is 4 to 5 hours slower than everyone."
,MakedonMakedon,2013-04-13T12:00Z,"Wow! I didn't knew that, thanks for sharing! Still grateful to footy for his uploads!"
,rediffpiratebay4ever,2013-04-13T16:09Z,"@egtorraptor footy does sometimes take a while to upload but no one is as reliable and his torrents are always perfect, i will personally always wait for footys upload"
,egtorraptor,2013-04-13T17:27Z,"^Oh don't get me wrong mate I love footy as well. Just trying to help people out who want the race fast.

He is reliable but he still posts the same torrents as all these people get it from the same website. For example I know when he will upload the qualifying from today it will be either 700mb or 1.4GB because those are the two torrents available.  Both of these same torrents have been uploaded 4 to 5 hours ago on the accounts I've posted who also never post fakes."
,rediffpiratebay4ever,2013-04-13T19:53Z,"@egtorraptor footy is definately taking his time today, but the other torrents i have checked and they are either bbc qualifying not sky or they are just qualifying no pre post show, have you found any sky sports one with  pro and post"
,Abawcom,2013-04-13T23:10Z,I'm waiting on the SKY coverage. Since the BBC spent all that money on the Olympics there coverage has gone WAY downhill.
