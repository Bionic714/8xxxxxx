Install the game first(from the setup downloaded) and in the folder of the installed game there will be the key.txt. Enjoy"
,pirateawol,2013-04-14T18:02Z,Thank you for this. The demo on their site wouldn't work for me so this is my alternative route to see if I like the game. Support the devs.

,Gerend,2013-04-15T03:13Z,"Key expired even without updating this no longer works, you wouldn't happen to have a key for .42 would you Nanomech?"
