The .srt subtitles are a nice touch.

I am collecting & repacking your uploads, therefore I feel obligated to seed even longer than normal.

My compliments on the excellent and so far consistent quality, and thanks!

V:10 (I reserve 10s for when I am surprised)
A:9
M:8 (Great episode, I'm really feeling the plot buildup.  Kraang!)"
