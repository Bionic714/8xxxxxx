Tiger Lillies - 1998 - Low Life Lullabies

A strange, haunting, collection of songs. It's fair to say that this new collection is at opposite ends of the spectrum to 'Farmyard Filth', the former dealing with man's inhumanity to beast, while the latter deals much more with the troubles and pain of the human condition itself, and the cruelty of humanity against its fellows. Cheerful, no? (tigerlillies.com)
