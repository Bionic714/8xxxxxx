,hustlakid,2013-04-14T02:47Z,Thanks for the upload.  Could someone post if this mod actually works please?  I've spent money on buying donuts and I don't want to install this one if it's not modded with free donuts.  Thanks.
,thompson6,2013-04-14T03:29Z,"OKAY, proceed at your own risk! THIS WORKS, but I was only able to do it because I had managed to save my progress on Origin. It only works because I worked off an earlier Mod version and for about a day there was an overlap that allowed me to sign in to Origin and establish my progress there. Upon installing this apk I had to erase both my versions of Tapped Out but thankfully used Origin to secure my backup. Had I didn't backup it up, I would be starting from zero. Donughts work fine, thanks to the uploader! But beware, this may only be working for me due to a glitch. If anybody else far more knowledgeable wants to jump on this, go right ahead."
,hustlakid,2013-04-14T04:06Z,I installed right on top of previous installation and works GREAT.  FREE DONUTS!! WooHoo!!  Thanks Mcl_85.  You da man!
,ddivar,2013-04-14T05:21Z,"Works great. Uninstalled the previous mod and installed the new one. Was prompted to log on and did, but it took me into another version of Springfield I had on the Orgin servers. I logged out and played as anonymous a got my modded version of Springfield back.  "
