,rixnstuff,2013-04-13T14:58Z,Is this the SKY coverage with pre/post shows? Thanks!
,Viciously,2013-04-13T16:26Z,"It is sky. Check the tag. Plus it is long enough to include pre and post quali. Use your damn brain.

@SMCGILL1969, dude, please!, stop bloating the file size.

3500 to 4000Kbps is the max you should go with a 720p file. 

CABAC= No?. Why?. Seriously?.

Why encode using VBR?. Now wonder why the size is bloated.

Audio is prefect imo.

4 to 4.5gB should be the max file size. This 5.88 is a fucking bloat.

Still, Thanks. Hope to see you improve your next rip!."

""Viciously at 2012-10-14 19:03 CET:
A '+1' and 'Thanks' would be appreciated. :)""

;)"
,Viciously,2013-04-13T20:16Z,"Clearly, I dont upload much here and what I did, hasn't received any criticism, not that it would because I know my game.

As for +1, that feature is gone now. :p

As for Thanks, I wrote it. It's a genuine thanks. 

Stop using Apple OS. geez :p"
,horsse,2013-04-13T20:31Z,"Thanks a bunch - for your other upload ;) . 

The smaller file is the perfect size for me, with a fresh torrent I'm dying to watch .
This one would take me forever to get; no offense ."
,smcgill1969,2013-04-13T20:55Z,"@Viciously - I'm just yanking your chain! ;) 

Please note, I also upload the same broadcast(s) as a 640x352 avi..."
,Viciously,2013-04-13T22:03Z,"Well, I am not yanking your chain.

Just finished downloading it.

For 5.88gig or even half of it, I cant accept this.

Nothing more to say."

,dieana,2013-04-14T04:09Z,"Quality isn't great for a 6gig file, looks like Vaseline was smeared over the lens :( Though I'd downloaded the SD version by mistake! 

Still it's only Qualifying, hopefully the bugs can be ironed out for the race! I do appreciate all F1  I can get my hands on honestly, will be watching this asap! "
,mosh1111,2013-04-14T09:35Z,"people have some manners please, thank the guy firsy for his awesome work and then if u have a comment about the quality be gentle and dont act like childs, ok?

,pkorus,2013-04-14T12:38Z,"hey smcgill1969,

thx for this.. now that hannibal @ thebox stopped uploading full SKY coverage there arent many option left, so your upload is highly appreciated!
comment:
the video quality is poor, I don't know which setting you use.. but I recommend using either Handbrake or Megui to encode the video..
use a HIGH 4.0-4.1 profile with more ref frames! pref 4-5. CABAC is a must.. and use a CRF value of 18-19 at max .. you dont need more for 720p, also dont use VBR.

just download FAIRPLAY's version of the qually and compare quality ;)

thanks again for ur effort!

cheers"
,pkorus,2013-04-14T12:39Z,"oh I forgot, download FFDSHOW and encode with x264 codec!"
,Celeborn81,2013-04-14T14:46Z,Thank you so much for sharing this! I appreciate it immensely!
,mosh1111,2013-04-14T14:57Z,"when will be the race uploaded , smcgill1969 ?"
