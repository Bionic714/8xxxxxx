Bombay City Police suspect that some diamonds are being smuggled through Santa Cruz Airport, they immediately alert Customs Officials, and Airport police who thoroughly check through all the luggage and the passengers who have just arrived. They notice a nervous male, and when they approach to question him, he flees, leads the police onto a high speed chase, then crashes his vehicle against a tree and is killed. The police are able to recover diamonds and jewelery from a suitcase, and trace it to Bhagwandas Jewellers. When Mr. Bhagwandas is questioned, he denies having any knowledge of this, and asks his Munim to go to the Police Station and file a statement to this effect. Before the Munim can carry out his employer's instructions, he kills himself. The police must now determine as to why the Munim killed himself or was he killed by Bhagwandas, and assisting them in their task is a young man by the name of Shekhar, who has fallen in love with Bhagwandas' daughter, Rita. All the clues and trails point to Bhagwandas and his "silent" partner, Shamsher Singh, who was formerly known as criminal don, Shyamlal, but the police have no evidence to link Shamsher to the smuggling racket nor to the death of the Munim. It looks like the wily Shamsher does seem to have successfully pulled wool over the eyes of the police again.
