Dhund 1973 Hindi DVDRip x264 AAC Esubs Phantom

Dhund (Fog) is a 1973 Hindi movie produced and directed by B. R. Chopra. The film is based on Agatha Christie's play, The Unexpected Guest, and stars Sanjay Khan, his then flame Zeenat Aman, Danny Denzongpa, Deven Verma, Madan Puri, Navin Nischol and Ashok Kumar. The music is by Ravi.

Dhund is the story of a young woman Rani Ranjit Singh (Zeenat Aman), whose invalid husband Thakur Ranjit Singh (Danny Denzongpa) is murdered. The finger of suspicion points at the young widow and her former boyfriend Suresh Saxena (Sanjay Khan), but the killer is someone else. It is a taut thriller with a fantastic performance by Denzongpa. Two of the songs, "Sansar ki har sheh ka" and "Uljhan suljhe na" were hits.
