,xander442,2013-04-15T00:20Z,"to add some additional details, when attempting to switch the language using the ""office toolkit 2.4.1"" i get the following error message: ""Failed to integrate setup.exe.  setup.exe not found at the extraction path.""

i've tried the root directory and the x64 and x86 directories.  it fails each time."
