This popular syndicated talk and variety program is Steve Allen's 
second late night show, and at least his fourth national TV series.  
He competed against Johnny Carson┬áfor a couple of years instead 
of re-claiming The Tonight Show that he was the original host 
of a decade earlier!

Although it's hard to find the color tapes of 3 years' worth of
Steve's NBC prime-time series from the late 1950s other than the
one I uploaded earlier this year, this early 1960s show is 
in its original black & white videotaped form and complete 
at around 79 minutes, I'd sure like to see more of these...and not 
the partial show with Frank Zappa doing his bicycle demonstration again.
