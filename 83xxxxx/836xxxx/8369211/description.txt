Tiger Lillies - 2003 - The Gorey End

Now Grammy Nominated - Best Classical Crossover Album
The Gorey End, Writer/Illustrator Edward Gorey enjoyed 'Banging in the Nails' so much he sent us a large box of his unpublished stories, some of which we adapted and turned into songs. Then, before he could hear them, Mr Gorey passed away. So sad. But here are those songs, with the Kronos Quartet providing strings and barks, on our new CD The Gorey End. We think he would have enjoyed them. If he hadn't passed away. Tragically.
More on The Gorey End. Listen to songs and play a game. (tigerlillies.com)
