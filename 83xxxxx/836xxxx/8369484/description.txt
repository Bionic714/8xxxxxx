MiAPi presents a flick I couldn't find in a prebase:


Date..............: 13.04.2013 Anno DOMiNiOiPi
Title.............: Saat.Po.Long.2005.NORDiC.PAL.DVDR-MiAPi
Imdb..............: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0478024/
Imdb Score........: 7.1/10, 5616 users
Runtime...........: 89 mins 01 sec
Video.............: 6 passes CCE SP(L) 2.67 at 4857 kbps
Audio.............: AC3 and DTS 5.1
Stripped..........: Warnings, Trailers, Extras. I Also authored the entire DVD 
                    from scratch building my own with the material of the rip 
                    using as few PGC's and commands as possible. I've seen
                    DVDMANIA do it to their rips, but AMIRITE accuses them of 
                    this beeing using a 'One-click method'.

                    First of all, to make this perfectly clear, this is NOT a 
                    'One-clicker' It makes all sense in the world to use a 
                    standard authoring with as few commands as possible. It can 
                    ofcourse not be done in all rips, but should not be viewed 
                    as 'bad ripping'.

                    Anyhow, here it is. A good flick. Enjoy it with DTS.


                    Can you read my MiAPi?
