"Gentleman" is a K-pop single by South Korean rapper PSY released on April 12, 2013. It is the follow-up to his international hit single "Gangnam Style", which at the time of "Gentleman"'s release had been viewed on YouTube 1.5 billion times. The first public performance of the song, with its associated dance is scheduled for 6:30 PM April 13 at Seoul World Cup Stadium in Seoul. Like most of PSY's singles, the song is performed in a mixture of Korean and English. A poster was released containing the main line of the song 'I'm a mother f***** gentleman' , with the term 'f*****' reportedly being a mock-censored form of 'father' rather than the F-word.

Immediately after its release, "Gentleman" became the most downloaded song on numerous music streaming services in South Korea. The song is expected to debut on the UK Singles Chart this coming Sunday. It reached number 30 on the UK iTunes Chart by the end of the day of its release there.[citation needed] Two unofficial audio versions of the track on YouTube reached over 200,000 views each 24 hours after they were uploaded following the track's first release in New Zealand.
