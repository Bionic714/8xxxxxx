,accuslut,2013-04-13T19:02Z,also wondering about the sky coverage.
,IAMH67,2013-04-13T20:06Z,"Thanks for posting Tonyisaac

To those wondering why there is no sky coverage. Sky have sued one of the main uploaders of Sky F1 torrents. They have also been sending DMCA's to everyone who records and uploads their show so in the future you will see more BBC torrents than Sky. "
