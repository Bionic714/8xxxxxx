That being said this looks really good.  Worth the money to Buy/Rent."
,Homeoplasmine,2013-04-18T19:05Z,"Dear director,
Checked it on Youtube rentals and Google play, not available in my country (europe).

You (like many many many publishers) leave me no choice but to pirate it. 

When will you people understand you can't enforce regional restrictions on an open network without consequences?

Keep whining about the bad bad pirates."
