,crazyoliv,2013-04-24T11:33Z,"Exactly. Great qwality Cam. Very fine atenuation of the original watermark, congrats.
Anyhow, the movie sucks. Cannot produce fine piece of SF in 21th century?? It's crap+special effects+shaded watermarks!!"
,ProphetZarquon,2013-04-28T12:37Z,"This torrent (or any containing the 865mb file) is by far the most audible version I have found of Oblivion so far.

The video IS the FOX Cam, with the insanely annoying Skype address carefully blurred. Good job on that as apart from one hilariously blurred scene it is a very nice cleanup.

About the movie:
I am not a fan of Mission Impossible 3 through X. Tom Cruise is definitely not my favorite action hero.

This movie was fun. I was reading way ahead by the final scene but all in all I'd say above par for modern US scifi. I wish TPB had a way to post Spoilers that only appear if you click on them, because I can imagine this movie being ruined simply by knowing too much about it going in.
