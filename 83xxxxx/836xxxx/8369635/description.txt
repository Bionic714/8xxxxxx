Where to start.


 Basically i have chopped this video up into pieces blurring out all logo watermarks as they changed from one part of the screen to the other.No blurring when no logos were present but to be honest was it worth it as one of the watermark/logos that appears for roughly 3 minutes at a time is BIG so it not going to look pretty :lol:

 I had a go is all i can say alot of work went into this so if you dont want dont bitch at me for what it is.I gave another option that is all

 Screen 2 shows the biggest blur happens 4-5 times for roughly 3 mins throughout release
