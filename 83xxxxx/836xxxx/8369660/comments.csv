,Smeghain,2013-04-13T23:17Z,Looks like the Foxcam version with it blurred out and cropped to remove the subtitles.
,rzaba,2013-04-14T09:09Z,"All of CAM rips with size of
1.47 (.801+.701)
1.1 (1.05)
.876.39
.785
ARE THE SAME copy!
(I've checked most of them - see scene at 0:1:08 - when Tom get up - cam shaking)
All the same crappy but watchable.
So... beter chose the smallest one."
