You can play offline with an AI team fighting against another AI team in Death Match, or CTF mode. I don't normally play these kind of matches, but this had me hooked. You can also join, or host a local match. There are also vehicles in some stages to drive and gun down your foes. Using the gamepad is a lot of fun too; feels like playing on console. Game output size is 1 gig, enjoy."
