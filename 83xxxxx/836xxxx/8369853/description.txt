Willow #1
With the disappearance of magic, Willow Rosenberg lost the very thing that made her tick. Armed with Buffy's broken scythe, and fresh off an adventure with Angel and Faith, Willow is ready to find a solution on her own terms. The world can't live without magic-and neither can she!

Willow #2
In a strange new dimension, many unexpected encounters guide Willow on the quest to return magic to her world. While she's increasingly better at keeping her darkest self at bay, her mystery companion Marrak encourages darkness, making Willow wary of his intentions while dependent on his knowledge of this magically abundant realm. Just how far down the path of volatile magic will she go to get what she wants? And whom might she find there?

Willow #3
Willow has found someone she's been missing since Earth was cut off from other realms. But her ultimate quest to restore Earth's magic is flailing . . . Her search is pulling her one way, her companion another, and a newly encountered society of witches has a completely different idea for the future of Willow.

Willow #4
Willow struggles to keep her cool when she discovers that her traveling partner, Marrack, isn't who she thought he was. With magic at her full disposal, she can easily convince him to spill any and all secrets (right?) while they continue their journey to get home with magic in tow...

Willow #5
Willow's search for magic has led her to some strange worlds with mysterious creatures, fantastical spells, lost love, and new friends (as well as enemies). As her journey speeds toward its end, Willow lands within a rather morbid landscape where the greatest evil she'll have to confront is herself if she's ever to make it home again.

Buffy Season 9 continues with Willow's story!
