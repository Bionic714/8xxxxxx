,heyyouguys,2013-05-11T22:23Z,"have to agree with dauntless.  the audio is of very bad quality.  ive downloaded other season 1 torrents, it seems the source has audio problems, but the way this particular torrent was encoded, the audio simply cant be saved.  it is ok for someone who isnt picky, but it is quite noticeable and very distracting.  thanks for the time you spent uploading though, it is appreciated."
