No subtitles I'm afraid. I looked in opensubtitles, subscene, and podnapisi - none to be had in any language, not even French. That is typical of French films though, they don't seem to care about the deaf any more than they care about foreigners. 

Please, on behalf of all the poor deaf children who are dying to watch this film, is there a French person out there who can be shamed into creating a subtitle file?"

The children book Ernest & Celestine are amazing!
True peaces of art."
