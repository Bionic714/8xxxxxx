,hanksantana,2013-04-13T22:28Z,"ignore my comment, torrent is good, i was just paranoid about the short running time after last weeks torrents had no ending"
,hanksantana,2013-04-13T22:33Z,"wasn't trying to troll, i apologize again. if i was trolling i wouldn't have come back to apologize. I still have PTSD from last weeks torrents all cutting off at the climax. thanks for the download!"
[T],Calypso127,2013-04-13T22:37Z,"No swiping swiper, no trolling troller!"

,tyj0810,2013-04-14T01:46Z,"Just started watching this episode... the audio lags behind the video at the start, by a couple seconds at certain points.  Unwatchable for me, gonna try another :("
,tyj0810,2013-04-14T02:52Z,"False alarm.  I'm a dolt.  I had several programs running that were, for some reason, throwing the audio out of line with the video.  It is all working properly now - carry on DLing :D"
,cuteycindyhoney,2013-04-14T03:17Z,Thanks once again Drardg! 
,cuteycindyhoney,2013-04-14T03:22Z,"Thanks once again Drarbg. I hope this posts! For some reason I can't get ""Write Comments"" to work for me today! "
,bignowhere,2013-04-14T06:55Z,"It would be nice to have the full end titles, sure. But considering some t**t at the BBC see's fit to ruin them with a ""Stay with us or, turn over now for another shite new low budget show hosted by three no-names whose names you won't remember in another 30 seconds,"" I don't really see the point in bitching about it."
,Tinny_pb,2013-04-14T23:19Z,This file played on my computer but would not play on my WDTV Live. 
,Tinny_pb,2013-04-15T00:38Z,It's also missing the opening tracking shot - the first 10 seconds.
