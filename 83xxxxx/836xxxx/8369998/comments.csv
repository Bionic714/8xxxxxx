,hanksantana,2013-04-13T22:27Z,"I wAS WRONG, EPISODE IS JUST A SHORT ONE, APOLOGIES FOR SLANDERING YOUR good torrent, was worried after last weeks cut off one"
,Ardith,2013-04-13T23:00Z,"It's not that short. And last weeks episode played just fine for me. 

Im using VLC, and it went right through the credits. 

I was going to say that maybe your player has a missing codec or something, or a damaged codec. But maybe your specific torrent file got corrupted somehow. "
