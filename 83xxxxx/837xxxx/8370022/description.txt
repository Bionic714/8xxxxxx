Steven Spielberg Presents Animaniacs: Wakko's Wish, usually referred to as Wakko's Wish is a 1999 direct-to-video animated tragicomedy musical film based on the Warner Bros. 1993ΓÇô98 animated series, Animaniacs, and also the swan song to the series. The film relocates all the Animaniacs characters to a quasi-medieval fairy tale world and portrays their race to find the wishing star that will grant them a wish. While the film was released during the Christmas season, the holiday is not a factor in its plot, though the events do take place during winter.[1]
Wakko's Wish was first released on VHS on December 21, 1999. It contained 10 original songs and starred Rob Paulsen, Jess Harnell and Tress MacNeille reprising their roles as Animaniacs characters Yakko, Wakko, and Dot.
