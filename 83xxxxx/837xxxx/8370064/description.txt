"The Man Without Qualities" (German: Der Mann ohne Eigenschaften) is a monumental, unfinished novel in three parts by the Austrian writer Robert Musil (1880-1942), who worked tirelessly on the book for more than twenty years.  Set in Vienna on the eve of World War I, this great novel of ideas tells the story of Ulrich, ex-soldier and scientist, seducer and skeptic, who finds himself drafted into the grandiose plans for the 70th jubilee of the Emperor Franz Josef. 

This 1995 edition, published in two volumes and translated by Sophie Wilkins and Burton Pike, is the first to present Musil's complete text, including material that remained unpublished during his lifetime.  Volume 1 contains Parts I and II ("A Sort of Introduction" and "Pseudoreality Prevails"); Volume 2 contains Part III ("Into the Millennium") in addition to twenty galley chapters, drafts of the final incomplete chapters, and Musil's notes on the development and direction of the novel.
