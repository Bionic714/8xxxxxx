Great early movie by Michael Powell. Although this thriller has some lame attempts at humour, the photography and direction are first-rate.

As usual for spook stories of this era, the supernatural is debunked in favour of a crime story, turning it into a thriller. I have yet to see a genuine pre-1940 ghost movie, unless you count Rebecca.

Nonetheless, Powell's direction gives us a genuinely creepy atmosphere, plus we get to see some historical footage of the Ffestiniog Railway which I have ridden). Roy Kellino deserves a lot of credit as photographer, shooting a genuine lighthouse (Eddystone) must have been difficult - you can feel the claustrophobia.
