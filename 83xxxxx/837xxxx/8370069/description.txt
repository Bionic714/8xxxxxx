Tiger Lillies - 2001 - Two Penny Opera

2 Penny Opera, It's one cheaper. A new version of the seminal work, Die Dreigroschenoper, focused through the dirty lens of the Tiger Lillies vision. Love, death, betrayal and redemption on the mean streets of London. Recorded in London and San Francisco, and with guest guitar from Bad Seed, Blixa Bargeld, 2 Penny Opera also features 25 Minutes to go, unavailable until now. (tigerlillies.com)
