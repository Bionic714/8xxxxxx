Doctor Who is a show that I have been watching since 2005, and I have loved it since the start. It uses great acting and loads of exciting special effects and sci-fi aliens that totally rock. The show started originally back in 1963, when William Hartnell stepped in as a pequiliar fellow named the doctor, who lived with his neice in a police box. His niece's teachers wanted to meet him, so they broke in to the police box, only to find out that this box was a time machine, and they were suddenly whisked away on a series of strange but wonderful adventures to numerous other worlds.
