For Monet, the act of creation was always a painful struggle. His obsession to express emotions and to transmit light effects over nature was much more intense than his contemporaries. In his words: ΓÇ£Skills come and goΓÇª Art is always the same: a transposition of Nature that requests as much will as sensitivity. I strive and struggle against the sunΓÇªshould as well paint with gold and precious stones.ΓÇ¥
