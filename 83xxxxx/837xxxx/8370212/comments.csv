THANK YOU
I was just wondering if you would be so kind to upload
WATCHMEN DIRECTOR's CUT in 1080p
the ultimate cut is already available and seeing as how you are uploading alot of superhero movies i just thought you might do this one
Thanks again and hope you consider it. "

Judas, one more thing. Would you mind if you could list what films you've encoded so far? A simple print-screen would do. Thanks!"
