Tiger Lillies - 2002 - Live In Russia

Tiger Lillies Live in Russia 2000-2001. The bars and great halls of Moscow and St. Petersburg captured on cd, a collection of our more 'lively' tunes performed to various 'lively' audiences in the Russian Republic. Feisty!
Our only live cd to date, this collection of songs was recorded on our first two visits to Russia. We didn't know what we were in for and nor did the Russian audiences. The sound quality is well above average for a live album and the performances are full of verve and vigor.
Lavishly illustrated in colour, with lyrics in Russian and English. (tigerlillies.com)
