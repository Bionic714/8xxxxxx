Garden Window (2011)

The first and only album by O'Brother, an american alt-rock band with metal influences. 

Notes on sound quality:

Quality isn't the best, all songs were ripped from youtube with Audio Hijack Pro 2.10.4 and upscaled to 320 kb/s in an attempt to lower the quality loss. Expect to hear a bitrate of roughly 128, since that roughly is the youtube standard.
