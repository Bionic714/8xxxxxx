I Do... (1989)

The movie opens with some cheap classic music & Hyapatia Lee (the wife) frolicking trough the park, chased by her husband Randy (Robert Bullocks). After teasing him into the house both end up lying on the stairs and she calls him fatty. Randy overreacts, freaking out at her remark. She calms him down & he fondles her breasts, sucks at the nipples & works himself down to her pussy. He starts licking. She moans and suddenly remembers a scene from the past she has to tell him about. Immediatly. This cannot wait. So, instead of staring at Hyapatia's breasts, we find ourselves looking at a scene with Robert Bullocks and Bud Lee playing chess. Tom (Tom Byron), a young arcitecture student, shows up and Randy tells his wife to show him the garden. Tom gives the shrubs a glance and Hyapatia, the obedient housewife, shows him her bush. His effort to water it fails and ends up in a facial. We're back on the stairs. After hearing from Hyapatia how much she enjoyed that facial Randy wants to know how long Tom's dick is. It's really important to him. Hyapatia flees into the next scene. She's walking in the garden, accompanied by a girlfriend. She tells her about her problems with Randy. It seems like Hyapatia has to tell him fake sex stories to get him exited.
