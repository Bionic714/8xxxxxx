Napoleonic Era is a renowned, fan-made modification for Age of Empires 3 and its expansions The Warchiefs and The Asian Dynasties. The mod intends to accurately illustrate the time from 1555-1815 by greatly expanding and reworking the game with new units, buildings, maps, sounds, music and civilizations. The mod has been founded in January 2006 at the German Age of Empires site age-community.net by Alexander Fleger and is being continued by Peter Piepenburg since February 2010. It is still one of the most anticipated mods for Age of Empires III in the whole world.
