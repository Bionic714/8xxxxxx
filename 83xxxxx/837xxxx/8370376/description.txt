Information
------------------------------

The Airbus A380 is the world's first full double-deck passenger aircraft, a ground-breaking design in aviation history. A revolution in aircraft design, the Airbus A380 is the word's largest passenger airliner. With room for more than 500 passengers, a tail as high as an eight-story building, and a wingspan nearly the length of a football field, this massive commercial airliner is a game changer. But it's also a big gamble for Lufthansa. Take flight on this mighty plane's maiden journey from Frankfurt, Germany to San Francisco, California as they try to win over customers and maximize profits. If the flight is successful, this Airbus may force other airlines to go big or go home.
