Army Brat (1987) 

It all started with Private Benjamin. Jamie was bored, again. Then one day she filpped on the dvd and saw all the fun Goldie was having in that cute green uniform. And thatΓÇÖs all it took. The brat decided once and for all to be all that she could be. So she found a future, in the army.
After thoughtfully visiting many of the weary servicemen at their lonely bedsides, Jamie becomes caught in a tangled web of international intrigue and sexual espionage. But ultimately, she finds herself. In a cot. Army Brat, donΓÇÖt tell Colonel North. HeΓÇÖs shred it.
