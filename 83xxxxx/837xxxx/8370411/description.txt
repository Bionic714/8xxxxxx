Liberals are fond of quoting Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes who said, "taxes are what we pay for a civilized society"---but at the time taxes were just 10% of GDP. Now they are triple that. Is that civilization or theft?

Texas Congressman Louie Gohmert says the current tax code is just too complicated. He wants the current code scraped---and replaced with a flat tax.

American economic growth has stalled. Scott Hodge, the president of the Tax Foundation says America's hefty 70,000 page federal tax code is largely to blame.

John Merline, a writer at Investor's Business Daily, says ObamaCare is a tax too---a complicated one. It's so complicated that H&R Block made this disgusting commercial about how they can help you with ObamaCare. The actress's grin infuriates me.

Some in the IRS apparently think taking our money is funny. Our Special Correspondent, Kennedy, and Reason's Editor-In-Chief, Matt Welch, discuss the outrageous $60,000, taxpayer funded, IRS Star Trek video.

While some celebrities, like Eva Longoria and Ben Affleck, say they don't want a tax cut, former Reagan economic advisor, Art Laffer points out how many celebrities-- and others--- run from high tax states. Phil Mickelson, Tiger Woods, and even liberal Bill Maher said they would consider moving (or already have moved) because of California's high taxes.

To demonstrate the tax code's absurdity we play a game of "Real or Fake." I'll face off with FOX and Friends hosts Steve Doocy and Gretchen Carlson to see if we can guess which taxes are real, and which are fake.

Finally, Amity Shlaes, the author of Coolidge, discusses one president who actually cut the budget---and the deficit. What can we learn from him?
