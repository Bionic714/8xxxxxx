,deim0n,2013-04-14T09:53Z,"Thanks once more footy for the great upload.

I'm in the states stuck with horrible F1 coverage. The BBC and Sky broadcasts are so much better than the Speed and now NBC offerings we are forced to suffer through. Be greatful he's uploading this stuff at all instead of demanding SD and Sky uploads. "
