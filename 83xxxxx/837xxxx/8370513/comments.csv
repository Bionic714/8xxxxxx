,Delerium6,2013-04-14T08:29Z,Why are the subs hard coded?  I never understand why people do that.
,TeKeSTe,2013-04-14T11:57Z,"@Delirium6: Why you're download vostfr version ?
there is English version with no sub"
,Delerium6,2013-04-14T14:08Z,"Well I didn't see it when I did a search for ""Da Vinci's Demons""  Perhaps the English version isn't named properly.  Either way, my point is why hard code subtitles?  It's just better to provide a separate subtitle file or imbed in a mkv format so that it can be software controlled.  That way it can be enjoyed by all and there is no need to have hundreds of different versions of the same video."
