Dunno if i approached this correctly (if not PLEASE forgive my ignorance!) but i PM'd you @SuperBay Pirate Bay Forum re: a comic request.  Hope you are able to help!"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-14T12:30Z,"imsandee, that's quite alright, just f.y.i. i don't check my suprbay PM box as often as i should. i read comments on my last 1-2 days of posts here almost every day, so that's the fastest, although not private, way to reach me!  ;-)

i'll go get your message now!"
,imsandee,2013-04-14T12:59Z,"Thanx for your speedy reply!  Any chance you'll be able to help?  Lemme know one way or the other, k?"
