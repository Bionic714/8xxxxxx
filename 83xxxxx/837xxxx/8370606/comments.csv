The principle behind comments, is that it is a most helpfull way to share some meaningfull opinion about the upload's qwality to the very mainstream audience of the well behaved PTB crowd. Good manners want it to be said in plain english.

Interresting advices might have been shared their indigenous way, if only portuguese were not that historicaly proven bunch of alcoholich retardch. 

So what about the movie fuck-o?
