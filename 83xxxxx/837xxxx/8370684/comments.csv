,unyk,2013-04-14T14:46Z,Xvid .. Arghh.. It's 2013.. get a move on
,zakimar5,2013-04-14T15:01Z,"Shia LeBeouf makes every movie he's in, UNWATCHABLE! No wonder this thing made no money."

Thanks Acesn8s"
,FamilyGuyFan,2013-04-14T17:12Z,"I appreciate Xvid. I don't have to convert it to watch it on my DVD player and big screen. I make no complaints about having to convert to Xvid, maybe you should get a video converter and do the same...hmmm?"
,SweetSpotSune,2013-04-14T18:04Z,I also enjoy AVI

very good copy
thanks, Acesn8s"
,alan-bakr,2013-04-14T20:02Z,This movie is nothing but a great waste of talented actors. DO NOT watch it! DO NOT waste your precious time. 
,Jack_Reacher,2013-04-15T01:17Z,"@ alan-bakr :  I could have told you that when I saw that washed up, has-been, enema sucking communist bitch Redford was in it.  That cocksucker should be castrated although I doubt he's got any balls to begin with."
,seednope,2013-04-15T05:41Z,"Jack_Reacher: I have a feeling your opinion of this film might be based upon your political differences with Robert Redford rather than the film itself. Butthurt much there, buddy? "
,vampzcore,2013-04-15T05:57Z,thanks!!
,tonguethimble,2013-04-15T09:57Z,robbie red makes me wet cant wait to watch this
,Lawndog,2013-04-15T11:05Z,Perfect rip thanks !
,DrMD,2013-04-15T17:07Z,"A/V=9, M=6
It's not a total waste of time but ultimately just kind of bland."
,Paxet,2013-04-15T20:58Z,I dont get why people hate Shia Lebaouf :S He is not the greatest actor to ever live but he is not bad in anyway. He did a fantastic job in transformers. 
,michaelrwatson,2013-04-15T23:52Z,"Hey all you gayboiz panting that Redford AND Labeouf are in this: don't forget that it also has Nick Nolte, who no one would suggest is uncool. However, i am going to download the 700MB TODE rip because 1.61GB is way too big."

,pirate4584,2013-04-16T09:15Z,"michaelrwatson dont be such a drama queen, it makes no much difference between 700 and 1.2 is there no fast connection where you live you uncivilized prick?"
,pirate4584,2013-04-16T09:19Z,wheres my comment at?
,DjEj1201,2013-04-16T10:05Z,Why such garbage mouths? Seriously can't you just give an educated comment or does it always have to be with a foul mouth. All of you know which ones I'm talking to. I like these actors. I think they are all great but I have not seen this movie yet. I'm downloading it right now.
,rewar001,2013-04-16T10:57Z,I hate pigs so I'm going to probably love this movie!!!
,MAIK72,2013-04-16T20:04Z, A/V 10 Excellent movie!! Movie 10!!
,horus1sun,2013-04-16T20:13Z,yet another total bs movie that people will watch and take as fact. and lets all prey lapuke dies a horrible death. may he never be forgiven for ruining transformers and every other movie he has been in.
,Rush,2013-04-16T23:07Z,"More Hollyweird propaganda glorifying un-repentant, Left wing, Marxists murderers. 

If a conservative had done this shit they would be calling for his head. 

You morons eat it up like you did the other Marxist lie [ARGO] 

Obama voters really are this stupid."

,ectoendomezo,2013-04-17T04:19Z,"Well I was hopeful but the reality is an unbelievably annoying ""Big Chill For Post Civil Liberties America"".

The Rabid Right is actually so kneejerk as to be raving about this being 'apologetic' or some such nonsense regarding the 'sixties radicals' when in FACT look...watch it..with the SINGLE exception of a 'sort of' speech by Susan Sarandon to the effect 'what would you do if they opened fire on you?' the reality of this is an insipid...stunningly snide Apology FOR 'Ever Thinking We Should EVER RESIST THE GOVERNMENT"".

Redford not only blames the ""Women"" by the way with Sarandons character getting caught and another Woman ""changing Her life-long ideology in order to save Redfords tween daughter"" but he also literally states that ""The Women Radicals Lost Their Cool And IF HE had been There It Would ALL have been fine"".

Sexist?

Not that I care about that but its just ONE point regarding the jaw dropping mealy mouthed ""we're SO Sorry for EVER thinking we could RESIST tyranny..Gall!"" ""plot"" of this film.

The you have the ""journalist"" played by hippie kid Shia..

Well..umm..having grown up with radicals and artists..umm..guess what REALLY happens when ANYONE that Arrogant 'inserts' themselves in your affairs? They Get Punched In The Face for Starters..but Redoford jusrt keeps telling this little psycho 'what a smart kid' he is...

This is a sickening Boomer Apology to Big Brother..thats what it is.

Its Redford making it REAL clear that Hoover and the rest were ""Just Following Orders"" and resistance is ""Silly"" (a direct quote by the way).

This really is Obama style ""Neo Cons Posing As Liberals So As To Get Away With EVERYTHING"" hypocrisy.

And when Obama APPROVES 'Keystone XL' and he will..its the Hypocrites and sell outs like Redford that will facilitate the excuse making..because after all..all that Environmental Resistance is just such a waste of time and really quite ""Silly"" or at least thats what you tell your 'Tween' when you have to run and hide from the FBI just long enough to blame the Women who used to be your allies.

Wow!

Redford is PATHETIC."

,exarmy28,2013-04-17T11:13Z,Another shite film! Where are the new cinema releases uploaders?...whats happend to piratebay its so slow with thelatest films now :(
,jimimetis,2013-04-17T12:12Z,"@ exarmy28
you should take under consideration the risks those pirates take to serve your entertainment, there's a reason why the community has a harsh time now, didn't you watch this documentary on piratebay? if not you should, you'll understand what happen today"
,SebaKL,2013-04-17T17:15Z,"Thanks for the AVI - looks great on my big ass screen. 

@unyk yeah, let's make it animated GIF with WAV file for the audio. BRAVO (slow clap)"
,Funk606,2013-04-17T19:47Z,"Ahh for gods sake, u talk about propaganda, I saw that BS movie the other day, wtf was it called, ah yes "" Red Dawn"", I mean there should in the credits after the movie stand ""Made with support and money from ""Colt's Manufacturing Company"" & ""Magnum Research Inc"" and so on, I never ever seen anything so stupid, USA that is the worlds number 1 country when it come to spending $ on weapons, u spend 41% of the money the hole world spend on military, number 2 country is China, that got a population that is like almost x4 of what USA got, and still they ""only"" as number 2 spend 8%, North Korea is not even on the top 10 list, but still they manage to Invade USA, I mean I never ever seen so blatant propaganda, well unless you go back to WW2, and watch some of Hitler's speeches, I don't think u can find same amount of propaganda as was in that fucking stupid movie, and if you ask, who got a interest in that US population live in fear of thing like that North Korea invade? And who the fuck is soooo stupid they believe it would be possible for Planes / ships / blabla to travel from North Korea to USA without anyone noticing it? I mean USA got satellites across the globe, and can see what's in the sandwich that you eat, but nooo Korea sneak with there super stealth things all the way over the ocean and jump out from planes, strange, in the movie the planes are visible, wonder why no US planes shoot some of them down, ahh yes they are all deployed in other countries, right!!  But the reason that you don't spot them and had any warning are those nasty EM missiles, again, WTF about all your satellites? When they can spot even 1 single missile test any country makes, how the fuck can they let 10000 nasty EM missiles fly all the way over to US, k they using some cloaking devise, its just sooo strange that US that spend 41% of the hole globes $ on military don't have any of the weapons that Korea got, I mean in witch world does that make sense? So please stop your BS about propaganda, as both sides does it, and do it so obviously, that everybody but you ""yanks"" have a hard time trying to not just laugh when we watch so stupid movies as ""Red Dawn""!  You are being manipulated by both sides,  so you gotta tune all BS out and start to think for your self, k its hard, when you are born in a country where ""taking a trip to the local library is = renting a movie at Blockbuster"" Start spending some of those 41% u spend at military, and spend it at education! Honest, you need it! I don't know any other country where you can walk out to the streets with a atlas, and as the population to point out where USA is, and 1/2 of the people you ask, got no idea where US is, jesus! Back to school with all of you lol :-) @Rush can you even tell what the difference is from what Lenin / Stalin / Karl Marx believed in, do you even know that Karl Marx not was from Russia / Ukraine, but that he was one of two German philosophers that was the front thinkers behind what you call ""Marxists"" I strongly believe you cant tell what he's original political views was? Well USA, the land of the free, got the worlds most inmates, you are around 4.5% of the worlds population, but got over 20% of the hole worlds inmates! U got more inmates than China, and I don't mean per inhabitant, no just plain and simple, even China got x4 your population, you have more inmates than China got! Something went wrong or? I think I would have a hard time calling USA the land of the free, when it got more inmates than any other country in the world! And then you say, well if we just had more guns, then crime would be down, well fuck me sideways, also there you got a world record, for every 100 people, you got 90 guns! You are the most well armed country in the world! And still you got the most inmates, can you please explain how that compute? Or tell me how many guns is it you think will solve your crime rate? Shall we back to the good old west, and every yank should have a gun belt strapped around he's waist, with a gun in each side? Then all would be good, right? Again, back to school, you "
,portaal,2013-04-18T12:46Z,you seriously expect ANYONE to actually read that shit? 
,jagwiz69,2013-04-19T02:02Z,@ectoendomezo.............well put. I agree completely.
,jagwiz69,2013-04-19T02:07Z,"@Funk606.............the problem in our country begins with our education system. So you could've summed it all up a little quicker.....no, a LOT faster than the time you took to type that."
,shikai84,2013-04-19T12:07Z,"@ Funk606 ... You do realize you just went off on a rant about a remake of a movie that's 30 years old, right? They just changed Soviets/Cubans to North Koreans for this one."

,hatepig,2013-04-25T04:57Z,"Only the most ignorant people on the planet can think Obama is anything but a corporate whore. You people who think he's some kind of leftist radical are so completely brainwashed it'd be impressive if it weren't so disgusting. What exactly has he done that's so socialist and radical? Reagan, who's probably your hero, said himself he gave the most corporate relief (subsidies) than any of his predecessors for the last 50 years. THAT is socialism, just redistributing money up rather than down. You people should be embarrassed by how bought into the most ridiculous lies you are. Republicans and democrats are two wings of the exact same party."
,OzGoat,2013-04-25T13:04Z,Good quality audio and video! Thanks for the up! 
,YMGenesis,2013-04-25T22:42Z,"Seriously, what is wrong with you people?
Uploader uploaded movie for your viewing pleasure... yet you spam the comments with ideological stupid ass political crap. Any comment that actually mentions the quality of the film will be one million times better than any of this political TL;DR shit... EVERYONE HAS OPINIONS.

Great quality, great audio, mediocre movie. "
