Pin marshmallows with uncooked spaghetti and build your way to the next level.
Spaghettis bend, snap and throw your marshmallows to the ground.
Many levels can be solved in many ways. Experimentation is everything!

On level completion, go rampage and bring everything to the ground to a symphony of snapping spaghetti!

I deleted to free up space on my phone and went back to download it, and it wasn't available, so I'm uploading so you can find it easier than all I had to go through.

Cheers & Enjoy.
