,Anthari,2013-04-14T11:15Z,Is it me or do i see a lot of leechers in there. Can anyone tell me if it's fake or? Anything? Is it the real deal? Quality or what not?
,Promx01,2013-04-14T12:24Z,"Thanks :) The quality is not bad, could be worse. 720p. The video is little glitched at some parts. It has korean hardsubs and intergated english subs."
,foxmlg,2013-04-15T01:56Z,"It's legit, I'm the one who subbed it... "
,mirmir1,2013-04-15T02:40Z,"Hey Prmx01 what do you mean by this""It has korean hardsubs and intergated english subs. "" so its not pure english sub?"
,.allbliss.,2013-04-15T03:33Z,WTF is with the leechers' count? 
,elevyn,2013-04-15T12:43Z,"It's hardsubbed Korean with English slapped over the top of it in a black box. Mostly blocks out the Korean, get's a little distracting sometimes but for the most part it's fine. Still great quality and subs.

The subs look like this: http://bayimg.com/daLLlaAEm

,Promx01,2013-04-15T19:00Z,"Yeah, and those eng subs can be turned off :)"
,Pat9110,2013-04-16T14:42Z,Nice movie! A10/V9/M9 - Sometimes the eng sub is wrong and the sentence on video doesn't make sense also the japanese (moro moro for example) isnt translated into english which is quite annoying for certain parts. Thx uploader all the same!
,JohnGReco,2013-04-17T20:00Z,What is the resolution of the video? is it HD?
,ps3andseeds,2013-05-22T23:08Z,great download love the animation grew up with this cartoon
