,soviet001,2013-04-14T04:20Z,"Hmm strange -- when I dl a FRESH torrent (i.e., ul'ed 1-10 [sometimes more] mins ago), the initial speed is abysmally slow... yet a minute earlier, I just began to download the same 2HD release (but diff. torrent of course) off torrenting.com (the site), which obviously uses just 1 tracker (their own), yet the speed almost immediately jumped to my max, getting up to 1.3mpbs already 10 seconds in... Any explanation anyone? I thought here on TPB they already have multiple trackers embedded in the torrents? Why is it so slow in the first hour after an upload but not on a ""semi-private"" tracker site like torrenting.com?"
,soviet001,2013-04-14T04:26Z,"..and I realize this torrent doesn't have torrenting.com as 1 of its trackers...the trackers are determined by the uploader, right? It's just confusing to me how basically all bay torrents have publicbt and openbt and 2 other udp trackers usually -- or is it always like this by default on TPB?? sorry for my ignorance in this matter. But why would, as I mentioned in my post immediately prior, 1 torrenting.com tracker allow for such quick speed right away vs. multiple trackers (which I always assumed were very fast and large, etc. [publicbt, openbt, etc.]) like in this torrent?"
[T],Calypso127,2013-04-14T07:56Z,Multiple trackers is not always good as it can throw more peers into the pool and your torrent application can limit the maximum amount of connections to each torrent or each piece of data which means you will get more leechers than seeders in your pool by adding a tracker that contains more leechers
