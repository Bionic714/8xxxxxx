,mike205992,2013-04-27T06:34Z,"This cracked worked for a while, but after a few days it stopped working and I got the trial message. If you're trying to rip blu-ray discs, AnyDVD requires an internet connection to connect to it's decryption database, and that's when they check to see if you're using a crack or not. If you are, then they blacklist your IP. I don't know if it really requires any decryption info from their database, but if you're going to crack this thing you will need to patch out that part."

,Dalkamyr,2013-05-27T15:38Z,"I got this msg after using this program for a few days:

Sorry, but trial versions are not allowed to use the update server!

The AnyDVDHD trial is intended for functionality testing only and,
for business reasons, updates for processing some new discs are not available.
ERROR processing Blu-ray disc!"
