,jhmman,2013-04-14T06:21Z,"Llwynog, this is indeed episode 8. The christmas special isn't counted, if that's what you're thinking. "
,trace535,2013-04-14T18:21Z,Episodes not written by Steven Moffat tend to suck don't they?
,GothBoy8,2013-04-14T18:41Z,"trace535, I find it's the other way around. I hate Moffat and his repetitive writing. "

Ep 3

Worst episode I've seen of Doctor Who yet.  Storyline was rushed with little explanation about anything, and the entire thing was just sappy.

This wasn't written by Moffat, but Mark Gatiss, though.  Moffat wrote the first episode of the second half of this season (""The Bells of Saint John"").  The other two (""Rings of Ahketan"" or w/e and this one) were written by two other people and it shows, for they were abhorrent.

Doctor Who is going downhill so very tragically."
