,amine1,2013-04-14T20:35Z,Tom Cruise rocks in this movie..for me finally perfect SF but i saw it in better quality then here at 021.su/dvdrip
,SikDuc,2013-04-14T22:28Z,Tom Cruise is the worst actress that ever wore a TuTu. I'm going to download JUST to eat up some bandwidth and hopefully discourage anyone from finishing a download. I care about my fellow TPB'ers. :)
,TheFiremaster,2013-04-14T23:14Z,Thanks mate been looking forward to this one :D
,K1bbler,2013-04-14T23:42Z,"@BKKJack and @665w4w2d

Maybe you should learn the what downloading metadata is before making retarded comments because you clearly know nothing about torrents you stupid fucks."
,Stinnett,2013-04-15T01:13Z,Will this work with cinava?
,OXYMORPHONE,2013-04-15T02:34Z,"Couldn't get previously release by FOX to work on my PS3. Cinavia errors, don't know if it's the same with this rls. Still a good quality release though, played beautifully on my PC"

,BKKJack,2013-04-15T07:12Z,"@k1bbler, it seems plenty have got past the 'metadata' stage therefore simply aren't quite as fuckwitted as you obviously are..."
,Stinnett,2013-04-15T07:25Z,"Ok thanks man, I'm going to convert it to mp4 1280*730p with the video codec h264 and audio codec:acc and see if that will work on ps3. I'm sure it will but converting it to mp4 will put it at 3.4Gb which is alot.  "

,K1bbler,2013-04-15T11:10Z,"@BKKJack

Still doesn't change the fact you don't grasp how torrents work. Maybe you should think before commenting to avoid making an even bigger loser of yourself. Make shutting the fuck up your strength your time on the internet would be a better place for everyone."
,Octabong,2013-04-15T12:44Z,"Boyakasha watchable(= A job well done Ace. Good movie, although I must say that it sounds like they have used the soundtracks from War of the worlds and Mass effect, not very original but hey it works for me."

,bluesborn,2013-04-16T06:39Z,"The very beginning of the movie is missing although I don't think it adds up to much.The over all quality is decent although not great.As has been noted already-it's watchable. 
a/6 (hollow sounding)
v/6 1/2 (continually gets blurry clears up-murky interiors)
Thanks for the effort uploader."
,peopelle,2013-04-16T15:51Z,"It looks very much watchable at first glance I'd say !
Tnx a lot Acesn8s !!"

""how about a ts now . it is due""

The fucking movie isn't even out in theaters until April 19. Dumb fuck. "
,halfchaos,2013-04-17T11:34Z,"the V is not a 7, it's not even a 3 ... it's a cam. C dot A dot M ... aka dogshit. you little kid fuckers should wait to download until the dvdrip comes out or go to the movie and pay to see it now because the quality here sucks liquid anal turds."
,saint84,2013-04-17T12:15Z,Bring_Back_Demonoid. why don't you take care of your zits and hormonal mess you are in . and then you can go and fuck yourself. just asking a better audio . and by the way who cares if it out now. so get lost or make a suggestion . 
,saint84,2013-04-17T12:17Z,"was already out in europe ,moron , before the usa. so why don'y you get lost .
audio is a 3 . l cannot understand all the time and dialogue in this movie is very important "

,cwdthree,2013-04-20T05:29Z,"30 seconds in there was some camera shake...literally the person was aiming.

About 5 mins in the cam moves again...

Honestly, if it weren't for those 2 points I wouldn't have thought it was a cam. It's GREAT video.

The audio is lacking but not so bad you can't keep up.

The person that shot this should set up an account here.

This is the best cam I've ever seen. It's good enough to make you wonder but still lacks that you know it's a cam...because of the first few mins and the audio.

Super watchable.

V/8 (only because the first few minutes
A/4 It's a cam. Crank it up and it makes it damned good

Best cam I have ever seen."
,cujo4025,2013-04-21T15:15Z,a:6 v:8 not bad for a cam it missing about 5min in the beginning and at the end it get blurry at the end and there something pop up every 15min and stay there about 5min for the movie story is not bad but it a little bit like total recall
,GeorgeMack,2013-04-21T20:55Z,I am obliged and a lot people in here must certainly be giving a fresh choice instead of that watermarked fox shit episode audio 5 (can be adjusted in the effects on your vlc player) video 8 for a cinema camera. Keep it up:)
,DrugSquad66,2013-04-22T11:45Z,Fuck you you fucking fuck fuck !! !!

Thank you!"
,Proper_Rating,2013-04-27T21:20Z,I was waiting for some one to do this.  Thanks bud.  I'll download regardless of quality just because of the effort you put in.
,Calamakuya,2013-04-27T22:51Z,"*Sighs* 

I'm gonna give it a try for the lack of better choices available until a BRrip or DVDrip appears online....


...........................However, I hope I don't regret it later."
,w_wibbly,2013-04-28T05:12Z,"Acesn8s has done a great job minimising the effect of that frigging promo-thing - far from perfect but very watchable.

I don't think I'd have watched it as it was - the banner-placement seems designed to piss people off, rather than promote I suspect.  If it was a promotion attempt, that guy is clueless."
,rp87,2013-05-01T03:27Z,Bro this movie is legit and anybody that hates on a free movie should go play in traffic. You did an awesome job hiding the water mark. Thanks for the upload keep up the amazing work. A:7 V:7

,Fyrecide,2013-05-07T04:13Z,"Wow, phuckstic, you're such a pathetic, whiny, ungrateful loser. Think you can do better? Then do it and stop whining, which accomplishes nothing except makes you look like a miserable twat. If you CAN'T do better, then shut the hell up.

It's a free copy of a movie still in theaters, and someone went through the effort and the risk of filming it so that YOU, you miserable waste of flesh, don't have to pay or even leave the house to watch it.

And all you can do is complain. What an ungrateful twit. I hope you get banned. It's ironic that you call everyone else ""miserable"" when YOU are the miserable ponce whining and complaining about the quality of a FREE movie and insulting everyone, instead of just posting constructive feedback (i.e. an ""A/V"" rating) without insulting people or being a douche. But I guess a miserable, ungrateful twat like you is just not capable of being anything but pathetically stupid and negative."

,PookaHookah,2013-05-15T01:55Z,"@K1bbler: You have to be one of the most ignorant pieces of shit I have ever seen here. It easily gets past the metadata stage and downloads perfectly fine. You claim to be some expert on torrents but clearly your stupidity is glaringly obvious. Learn more about torrents before making yourself look like more of a complete and utter waste of oxygen. Your father should have pulled out, because the rest of what you need dribbled down your mothers legs."
,DeazLeg,2013-05-19T18:42Z,"Probably one of the best cam I have ever seen... Very watchable, audio is just fine. The few dark scenes stand ok to watch.
- Video : 7 (This is high for a cam)
- Audio : 5 (Maybe a bit annoying at the beginning but you will get used to it pretty fast)
- Movie : 8 "
