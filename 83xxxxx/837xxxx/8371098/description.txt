A USER'S MANUAL FOR THE HUMAN EXPERIENCE is a post-modern guide for today's realist – everyone who knows that meditating on rainbows, angels and puppies won't solve anything. It's a libertarian approach to recovery - from substances, bad people, and lazy work habits. 

WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING ABOUT THE BOOK:

"Part intellectual memoir, part self-help book. Michael W. Dean's Practical Emotional Self-Defense (PESD) techniques flow from a wealth of life experiences, both positive and negative. 'The Only Two Rules in Life' have some radical, refreshing implications."
--Jason Sorens, Ph.D. (Assistant Professor, University at Buffalo, SUNY), founder of the Free State Project

"You owe yourself the opportunity to step outside your comfort zone and put yourself in the court with this modern-day Socrates."
--Pastor Kenneth V. Blanchard, Sr., author of Black Man with a Gun

“I knew Michael Dean back in the day, when he was a 19-year-old punk rocker with an appetite for self-destruction. I honestly didn’t think he’d live to be 30. But guess what? It turns out that Michael isn’t just a survivor; he’s a survivor who’s learned how to enjoy life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness after recovery. For everyone who wants to know how to stay sane, develop a great work ethic, and make a mark on the world, Michael Dean has a great story to tell."
--Professor Michael Bérubé, Ph.D., author, Life as We Know It
