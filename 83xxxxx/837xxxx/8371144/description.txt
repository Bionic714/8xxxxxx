ANALYSIS

The ΓÇ£AnalysisΓÇ¥ is a set of PhotoshopΓäó actions that produce 11 distinctive photo effects. The
actions involve ΓÇ£breaking downΓÇ¥ of an image into a number of elements such as the inner pages of a book, a bookΓÇÖs cover pages, individual photos, filmstrips, stripes. At the end the original image is presented as a combination of these elements. All layers are placed within a group and left intact for you to manipulate to taste.


THE FILM MACHINE

The FILM MACHINE Photoshop1 actions create 15 different filmstrip effects using your images. The package contains three action sets; the FILM MACHINE 2 PICS, the FILM MACHINE 3 PICS and the FILM MACHINE 4 PICS. The first set uses 2 images to produce the effect. The second set uses 3 images while the third set uses 4 images to produce the final filmstrip. The actions are designed for Photoshop v.7 and higher. Since there are a number of memory demanding steps (copy, insert path, etc), I recommend you free up computer memory in advance, by closing any other applications, if your system resources are limited.


THE PANOS CUBE ACTIONS

Contains 2 action sets:
The first set (Panos cube_1 IMAGE) lets you create 9 different cubes, using 1 image of your choice.
The second set (Panos cube_3 IMAGES) lets you create 9 different cubes, using 3 images of your choice. All the images must have the SAME size.
In total there are 18 different cube effects! Just follow the instructions given while the
actions run.
