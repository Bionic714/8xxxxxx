I found this on Soundcloud and downloaded it before it got removed. I'm guessing he just wanted people to be able to listen to it and get a preview of some of his songs, but I enjoy listening to the whole thing. I also have access to an Allkore show that was removed, I'll probably upload that within the next week. If anyone wants a tracklist, leave a comment about it and I can probably figure it out. I know the first song is RoughSketch's remix of Terror In Your Mind by DJ Plague and the second song is his own No More Loop. Muscari is also in there later, as is Samurai Terrorist.

Please seed, and enjoy!
