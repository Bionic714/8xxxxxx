That said I have not figured out a way of overriding the tab behavior in Chrome which brings up either your Chrome installed apps (as it runs as a kind of mini os) or history ( as does Firefox these days).... Both such a good idea but no biggie.

Only go google where I need to but avoid their search engine pages religiously!"
