,Lanyus,2013-05-20T21:10Z,"''320kbps CBR MP3 format ripped from compact disc or transcoded from lossless source

proper ID3 tagging for artist, album, year, genre and title
proper song title capitalization, files are named ""00 title"" (track#-space-songtitle)
there are NO unnecessary tags, NO stupid URLs in any fields, NO low quality ""iTunes rips""''

This is what everyone should do, I always edit all the music I get with mp3tag and give it a 500x500 artwork as well.

Keep up the good job and thank you. "
