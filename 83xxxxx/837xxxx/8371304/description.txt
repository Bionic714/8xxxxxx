Tiger Lillies - 2002 - The Sea

The Sea, Sick sea-shanties of sailors, portside whores, con-men, pirates, mobsters and devils. Pump organ, Celeste, Singing Saw and other objects washed up with the tide create a picture of the docks and depths around the Sea. A fragile siren calling all to their doom. (tigerlillies.com)
