,Nimh,2013-04-14T11:33Z,"Problems? like what problems? 

Thanks for explaining,  my connection is bad , which the telco company wont fix until April 26th.  Only have 50kB a sec and am almost finished downloading this one.  So what are the problems???"
,Nimh,2013-04-14T11:38Z,"Wish you could explain yourself. I understand that you do this  but geez, may aswell have waiting just downloaded sec's upload. Do i continue at 92% or do i skip it and download another from scratch??"
,SouthTPB,2013-04-14T17:09Z,I'd recommend grabbing SecTPB's version instead of finishing this one.
