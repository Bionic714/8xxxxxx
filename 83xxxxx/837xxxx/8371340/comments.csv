,superdupahorn,2013-04-15T20:47Z,This needs to be seeded
,innoavril,2013-04-16T09:15Z,"Seed Please...

Stuck at 82%...!!"
,reefmag,2013-04-19T06:09Z,"The instructions say:-
Run ""Start-KMSmicro-WO.vbs"", waiting for the server to load. If for any reason the server won`t start,  try to run ""KMSdebug.cmd"" in qemu folder to start it. 

There is no ""KMSdebug.cmd"" in the qemu folder.

I can't get that ""Start-KMSmicro-WO.vbs"" file to open for anything, it opens for half a second and disappears."
,lelouch.geas,2013-04-21T18:20Z,yup..same here..cant get the vbs file to work as it should..needs more clarification on how to get it to work before more people download this..

,Lordwise,2013-04-26T06:55Z,"@reefmag @lelouch.geas @brigzy try to stop or remove the seed from your torrents, wait until KMSmicro finish loading after you launch it, it takes a while to load. "

How can I overcome this problem? If there is a soliution please explain step by step, because Iam a newcomer. Thanks."
,north_a,2013-05-14T12:20Z,"Start-KMSmicro-WO-En.vbs is also not working for me. With Firewall off it does not load after being left for an extended period of time.

However, in Microsoft Office is says that the product is activated already somehow?"
