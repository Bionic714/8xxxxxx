Lilyhammer Ep3

Guantanamo Blues - Whilst collecting a debt owed at his club, Frank learns about a construction project of luxury condominiums in a local resort. Eager for a piece of the action, he offers to strong-arm an environmental objector to 'persuade' him to co-operate. Meanwhile, a routine inspection reveals that Frank is not properly licensed to drive in Norway, but rather than undertake the two-month instruction he decides to take a short cut. Stars Steven Van Zandt, Marian Saastad Ottesen and Sven Nordin. (From Norway, in English and Norwegian)
