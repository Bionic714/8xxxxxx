Description: A collection of three hundred koans compiled by Eihei Dogen, the thirteenth-century founder of Soto Zen in Japan, this book presents readers with a uniquely contemporary perspective on his profound teachings and their relevance for modern Western practitioners of Zen. Following the traditional format for koan collections, John Daido Loori Roshi, an American Zen master, has added his own commentary and accompanying verse for each of DogenΓÇÖs koans. Zen students and scholars will find The True Dharma Eye to be a source of deep insight into the mind of one of the worldΓÇÖs greatest religious thinkers, as well as the practice of koan study itself.
