,robgauthier2,2013-04-14T16:08Z,PLEASE anyone know where the TUF 17 fuel tv prelims are ?? NO torrents yet ???
,robgauthier2,2013-04-14T16:10Z,"please, someone fine the fuel tv prelims... send link ?"
,saffronsghost,2013-04-14T18:16Z,"Seems prelims don't exist, amazing...."
[V],SecTPB,2013-04-14T20:02Z,"Not many people have Fuel in HD, if they even have it at all. That's why no one uploads the prelims if they are on Fuel. I only get the SD broadcast, but it's so bad I rather watch an online stream rip or something."
,blairtomtom,2013-04-15T02:31Z,"All the prelims can be found at http://mma-net.com.

The qualities not great but it's better than nothing.."
,means916,2013-04-15T02:46Z,Thanks for all the quick uploads of MMA events. I know it takes work and you do that well sir... BIG ups SecTPB
,means916,2013-04-15T02:50Z,"I found the prelims on another users catalog. Here's the link http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8371180/TUF.17.Finale..Prelims.WEB.DL.x264-Strajow.mp4 .. If you aren't satisfied don't kill the messenger, that file is still downloading."
,johndbap,2013-04-15T18:13Z,thanks!
,fordm,2013-04-16T13:30Z,where is the match between Team Leaders?
,NMEofMan,2013-04-16T13:47Z,"""where is the match between Team Leaders?"" ---- Most of the time the coaches don't fight on the finale. Jones vs Sonnen happens at UFC 159... Hasn't happened yet."
[V],SecTPB,2013-04-16T18:46Z,"Since no one seems to have the prelims uploaded, I'm going to look for a rerun of the prelims on FUEL SD and cap them myself. Just keep a look out. No idea when it's airing again."
,LloydChristmas7,2013-04-18T06:23Z,Another great fight file by SecTPB. Thanks very much.
,Kastelator,2013-04-22T21:25Z,You can find the full prelims on Kick Ass Torrets.. unable to post link for some reason
,You_Muppet,2013-06-03T14:03Z,"Yeah, I also tried posting the link (to kat) and it wouldn't work. 

I've downloaded the torrent and like SecTPB said, it ain't HD, but you can still see that the blood is red! Search for the file ... The Ultimate Fighter 17 Finale Fuel Prelims.DivX-NONAME.avi"
