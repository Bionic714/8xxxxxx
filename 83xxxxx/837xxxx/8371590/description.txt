This is a great little torrent I threw together with a lot of love and care for all you John Lennon fans out there. It has everything a Lennon music fan could possibly want or need and then some. Please check it out and leave me some feedback in the comments. If you like this one, please check out my other torrents. Every single thing I upload is always iTunes friendly and tagged to the max. All of these albums are official John Lennon releases except for two pretty decent bootleg albums I threw in for good measure. Enjoy, and please remember to put in your seed time for others!
