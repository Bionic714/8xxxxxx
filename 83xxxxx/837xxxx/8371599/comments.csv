,Eugenie64,2013-04-14T14:26Z,"If it's from scenetime, it's not a fake."
,garry26,2013-04-14T14:35Z,"I just finished confirming this myself. Sort of. The Pilot episode of Defiance WAS released early. I repeat: The pilot episode WAS released early.

But... you can get a FREE copy @ amazon.com & view it instantly. So there be no need to DL this now."
,Arthzil,2013-04-14T14:37Z,"It's better to wait those 2 days for proper copy than to waste your time on this... This is Defiance. But quality is awful. 2GB of minecraft... Video is made of 1mm cubes, real fps is around 5 from what I can see, sound seems to be slightly out of synch. Feels more like 50mb than 2gb."
[V],scenetime55,2013-04-14T14:41Z,"Yes it's legit  I only upload quality copies here some screens from container:

,garry26,2013-04-14T14:41Z,"Yes this is definately a legit copy. Anyone can get it at Amazon.com. There seems to be a problem with the comments. I see 4 comments were made, but cant read them, except for my 1st one."
,poc12345,2013-04-14T15:35Z,if its legit all the legit uploaders would have it il wait till the rest have it then i know its legit
[V],QborT,2013-04-14T16:05Z,"Hah, it might be legit but the quality sucks.

Whoever was capping this didn't have the bandwidth to keep up.  Video stutters and is of poor quality.

Also it is 1280x720 so technically this should be in the HD section."
,titaniumten,2013-04-14T16:35Z,the quality of the 720p one is really really bad. Its like someone just resized a 480p movie and callled it hd.

,vovih1,2013-04-14T19:08Z,Качество видео очень плохое-лучше подождать пару дней и не портить себе удовольствие от просмотра!
,0v3rmind,2013-04-15T00:12Z,"Thanks in advance SceneTime! I love you! I don't care if the quality is kinda low... It's not their fault. Also, his just means I get to watch it twice now =)
"
,CarolR,2013-04-15T00:46Z,"scenetime is recognized and respected, so I'm sure this is real.
Does anyone know of a smaller size file being upped (normal size 500mb or less)?
Thanks"
,fishboy11,2013-04-15T00:50Z,"How can you watch it on amazon? i cant find any link to it here, just a link to the 15 min preview."
,dinusha123,2013-04-15T03:55Z,thanks man

,Satan6667,2013-04-15T19:41Z,"Yep, its a crapy copy. Ill wait for better one"
,oak415,2013-04-15T20:30Z,"V: 2

,CapPanda,2013-04-15T20:55Z,This is legit because its from SyFy's website.

,melkume,2013-04-16T08:35Z,How is this over 2 gigs? looks like utter crap. I should have paid more attention to comments before downloading. What a waste
