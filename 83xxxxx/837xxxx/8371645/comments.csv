try google: anamorphic"
,madhev,2013-04-14T22:09Z,comon these 576p rips rocks .....pls do  the 1st part of this movie in same quality ..

You are an idiot.  That's not anamorphic.  If it was 1280x576 then you could say it's anamorphic.
If it was 720x576 it could be justified as a PAL DVD rip.

Your attempts at being knowledgeable have failed miserably."
,CommonR,2013-04-15T03:39Z,"Try reading the video stats: 1024x432
720p is 1280x720 or perhaps less vertical resolution.  But this is less Horizontal and Vertical.
576p almost implies it is a PAL DVD which is 720x576.  I have no idea what this uploader is trying to do."
