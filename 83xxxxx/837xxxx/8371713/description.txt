In law, a law dictionary is known as a secondary authority in law. 

"A secondary authority is an authority purporting to explain the meaning or applicability of the actual verbatim texts 

of primary authorities; such as constitutions, statutes, case law, administrative regulations, executive orders, 

treaties, or similar legal instruments. Some secondary authority materials are written and published by governments to 

explain the laws in simple, non-technical terms, while other secondary authority materials are written and published 

by private companies, non-profit organizations, or other groups or individuals." 

Black's Law Dictionary is one of those secondary authority in law.


The 5th edition is reportedly the edition modern day judges use in American court houses, which are really merchant 

tribunals based upon how they operate today. Courts are measures and machines for collecting cash for governments 

nowadays. You see this all time pertaining to traffic cases. However, this is not the fault of judges, the court 

system, politicians,or government in my opinion.

It is the fault largely due to the American people who have become so fearful,lazy, and ignorant pertaining to their 

rights and the duties of their governing bodies and officials, so much so that their elected officials tell them what 

to do despite the people paying the elected officials via their tax dollars.

Employers (American people) are supposed to telltheir employees (government officials) what to do, but no longer with 

American citizens.  Americans, generally speaking, have been successfully dumb downed! People fear government instead 

of government fearing people. This was the slogan of the movie "V For Vendetta".

The 5th edition was the last edition to contain case-decisional law orlegal precedent.  All editions after the 5th 

edition - the 6th, 7th, 8th, and now 9th, do not contain case-decisional law or legal precedent.

However, Black's Law Dictionary, 5th through 7th Editions are not as accurate because references to common law are 

progressively removed, and Roman Civil Law concepts are augmented in order to conform to the law enforcement needs of 

political power centers such as the Federal Government and the United Nations. 

The rule of thumb is that older dictionaries are useful for understanding natural rights, common law, personal 

sovereignty, and the people's point of view. Newer dictionaries are useful for understanding civil rights, Roman civil 

law, centralized authority, and the government's point of view. All attorneys are trained in the latter. Judges may go 

to special seminars to learn the former.

Interesting Notes:

The properly and completely defined the term ΓÇ£United StatesΓÇ¥ was removed from the 7th Edition of the same dictionary 

by the publisher (possibly in an apparent effort to further conceal the truth about the limited jurisdiction of our 

federal government).

The properly and completely defined term "Marriage License" has been removed from the 6th Edition and up.
