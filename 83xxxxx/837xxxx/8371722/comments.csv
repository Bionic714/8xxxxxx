The keys of Enterprise Edition do not work for Standrd Edition, nor does the Keygen (found on internet, elsewhere), provide keys for Standard Edition. The Keygen provides keys only for Enterprise and Server Edition.( A request has also been posted at Suprbay too).

Note : Temp. Time bound Serials are however available, but a permanent serial would be great :)"
