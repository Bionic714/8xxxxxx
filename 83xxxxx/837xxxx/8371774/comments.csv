""There is an invalid character (!) in Your temp directory. Please remove the invalid character from your TEMP (or TMP) environment variable and run the installer again""

Am I the only one having this issue? I'm mounting it using Daemon Tools."
,dedexuro,2013-04-28T23:02Z,I have registered just to say thank you! It's clean (scanned with Avira and COMODO) and well served FIRST CLASS software. Thanks!
,dedexuro,2013-04-28T23:03Z,@MajorSock: Don't use DAEMON Tools Lite. It's a bunch of crap. Use this instead: http://static.slysoft.com/SetupVirtualCloneDrive.exe

,MajorSock,2013-05-04T19:55Z,"I'm still getting this same error:

""There is an invalid character (!) in Your temp directory. Please remove the invalid character from your TEMP (or TMP) environment variable and run the installer again""

I tried another version as well and it just isn't working. Does anyone have any ideas? The solutions on the matlab website don't seem to be working. I can't quite tell what to look for in my environment variables."
,CommanderArma,2013-05-12T05:02Z,"I'm sorry, where is the .txt file for the instructions? All I see is a system info file, I read it with Notepad++, but all I saw was the same description as you posted here. If you could tell me how to set up the license files and etc. that would be great."
,CommanderArma,2013-05-12T05:21Z,"Sorry if this is a repost, but I couldn't find the .txt file for instructions for the license setup. I checked the file but there was only a ""System Info"" text which was just a copy of the description. Could anyone point me to where the instructions are?"
