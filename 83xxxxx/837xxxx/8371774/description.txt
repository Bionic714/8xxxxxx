MATLAB is a  high-level  language   and  interactive  environment   for numerical computation,  visualization, and  programming.  Using MATLAB, you  can  analyze data,  develop  algorithms,  and  create  models  and applications. The language, tools, and built-in math  functions  enable you to  explore multiple  approaches and reach a solution  faster  than with     spreadsheets   or   traditional   programming languages, such as C/C++ or Java.

You can  use MATLAB for a range  of  applications,   including   signal processing  and  communications, image  and  video processing,  control systems, test and measurement, computational finance, and computational biology. More than a million engineers and scientists  in industry  and academia use MATLAB, the language of technical computing.
