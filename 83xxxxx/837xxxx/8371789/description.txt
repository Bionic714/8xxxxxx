Notes

grabbed fox vid, work done chopped into
23 pieces all the different parts where the
logos were.... got  a friend to help making
the blur templates then blurred each piece
seperately before joining vid back then encoded
with various filters then had to mux audioback
while fixing minor sync issues.really nice now
the original should have been upped logo free
instead of crucifying it with logos
