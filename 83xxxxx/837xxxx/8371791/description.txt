Offender made ridiculously absurd crime. The elements of the crime are arranged one after the other with inexorable logic hostages, ransoms, gunfire, explosions killed. But instead of having it all over, gunpowder smoke from the public to swim classic scene, it appears that events have created a maze in which it is impossible to trace the thread of truth. Too many people involved, too many things have normal explanations and obviously something very important is missing.

Shmenti Capelli - a comedy about what happened before our eyes without us know it. A war horse for the average person, whom nobody could understand. A movie of our time, and his crimes. A story of secrets that powerful can not hide from the weak.
