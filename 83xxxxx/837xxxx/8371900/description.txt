Plot

Suhani Sharma (Rani), a pediatric student in Mumbai medical college, was unlike many girls of her age. A bookworm who spent most of her time studying pediatrics and doing night shifts practicing surgery, Suhani never thought she could fall in love. But one day, a chance meeting with a stranger Aditya (Vivek) on a morning train to Marine Lines changes it all. It is a case of love at first sight. The two get married. Suhani gladly accepts whatever Aditya has to offer # a dingy room with unplastered walls, rickety furniture and a makeshift kitchen. Financial insecurities and ego hassles begin to drive a wedge between the happily married couple and the duo part ways eventually. However, deep inside both of them there still lingers their platonic love. Both know they cannot live 'with or without' each other.
