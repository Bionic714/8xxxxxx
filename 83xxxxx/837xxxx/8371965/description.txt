Tiger Lillies - 2004 - Death And The Bible

We like songs about Death, and we like songs about Christanity, so logically we HAD to make this album. Recorded in Hamburg in 2001 and with guest musicians who played on The Sea and with Tom Waits and Lou Reed, this cd has many odd, exotic intruments such as pump organs, celestes and whistles among others. 18 songs of religion and mortality on one album, our 15th studio album finds us walking hand in hand with Death and Jesus.
Review by David McComb of Bizare Magazine

Recorded around the same time as their moody epic The Sea, Death And The Bible is a world away from the gleeful perversity and kinky stompers of the LilliesΓÇÖ last album Punch & Judy, instead finding the twisted trio in a more sombre and reflective mood.
As the title suggests, Death... focuses on the bandΓÇÖs favourite themes of decline and religion, from the tragic subject of Incontinent who wishes for death to escape the body that is rebelling against him, to Mary Magdalena who shagged Roman centurions, fishermen, thieves and even "had that Jesus Christ".
While the record isnΓÇÖt nearly as much fun as PunchΓÇª or the LilliesΓÇÖearly albums, DeathΓÇª nonetheless creates a dark, melancholy atmosphere and beautifully captures the mood of seeing the band play live (without the inflatable sheep, pig masks or greasepaint, of course). (tigerlillies.com)
