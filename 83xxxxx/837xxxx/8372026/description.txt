MOTORING: F1: Grand Prix
On: BBC 1 
Date: Sunday 14th April 2013 (Already shown)
Time: 07:00 to 10:15 (3 hours and 15 minutes long)

China.
Suzi Perry, with guests David Coulthard and Eddie Jordan, presents all the action from the Chinese Grand Prix, where Nico Rosberg will be hoping to repeat his history-making victory from 2012. Rosberg claimed both his first pole position and a debut win in Shanghai last year, giving Mercedes their first Grand Prix victory since 1955. Rosberg's lights-to-flag victory was a resounding one, winning by a margin of over 20 seconds; the battle for second place, however, was anything but. The victorious German's now-teammate Lewis Hamilton ended third after just losing out in a titanic battle with fellow McLaren driver Jenson Button. Hamilton left China with the Championship lead in 2012 and, with new employers Mercedes' impressive recent history in Shanghai, will be hoping for big things this time round.
