           A greedy music agent in desperate need of a chart-topping    
            act turns to his nephew Frankie for help. Frankie Stein      
            is a brilliant scientist with a macabre attraction to all   
           things deceased, and he has created a serum that can         
            reanimate dead tissue. With the help of a grave robbing      
             roadie, Frankie builds a ghoulish superstar from the body
             parts of legendary rockers including Hendrix, Holly, 
             Vicious, and Morrison. But a certain appendage ends up in
             the re-assemble mix of organs and limbs, and it leads to a
             schizophrenic meltdown of the rock 'n' roll monster that is
             utterly hilarious and down-right horrifying. And sure
             enough, people must die... Long Dead Rock 'N' Roll!
