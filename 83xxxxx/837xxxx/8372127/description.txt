[code]The wonderful thing about Edge is that, unlike pretty much every other gaming magazine out there, it is not tied into any one platform, featuring the PC, PS3 Xbox360, Wii, PSVita, DS and even iOS games. Edge is a Mecca for games journalists, featuring contributions from the leading writers across every format, and includes famously expert and honest reviews, all the latest news, fascinating insights and views from within the games industry and features on the nature of gaming as a whole. Beautifully designed and produced, Edge is a must for any gamer. A consistent purveyor of fine covers, to boot.[/code]
