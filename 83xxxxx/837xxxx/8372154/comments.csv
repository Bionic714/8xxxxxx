,NdGMM,2013-06-01T15:32Z,"Regarding Mac OS X: The last big update (YNAB 4.3?) changed the location of the license file from '~/Library/Preferences/com.ynab.YNAB4.LiveCaptive/Local Store/.lic' to '~/Library/Application Support/com.ynab.YNAB4.LiveCaptive/Local Store/.lic'

Any chance you can update the reactivator to reflect that? Currently it's just quitting because it can't find the file. Editing manually (vim/nano/text edit/whatever) is still working fine, so no changes by the devs there."
