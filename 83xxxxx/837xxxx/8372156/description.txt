WiHack ΓÇô is the first normal working program for hacking Wi-Fi. This project was developed as a special software to work with protected wireless networks. WiHack is an improved version of AirCrack which we have previously tried to crack. 

 The program is able to analyze wireless Wi Fi for the presence of insecurity, then it becomes possible to perform the main hacking features such as:
 1)Get the Users List
 2)Guess the network password (crack Wifi password)
 3)Sniffing Users Mode (you are able to see every User's movement)
 4)Block the User (program will disconnect user from the network, it's useful when somebody is donwloading something and because of that your internet start lagging)
