A selection of poetry written and read by Chi Cheng, bass player for the Deftones, who passed away just a few hours ago.

I would say that you should support Chi by buying this album but it's long out of print and I already saw one scumbag on Amazon selling it for $300, so I decided to upload it in memory of Chi. It's ripped with EAC, scans included, so instead of buying a used copy and letting some asshole profit from Chi's death, I suggest you make a donation to his family, or at least send them a message of love and support: http://www.oneloveforchi.com/ 

I met Chi many times, he was a truly warm and loving person and a fucking bad-ass bass player. I will miss him terribly.
