Workdone:
Well save best for last since we are the only group so far able to remove the watermarks complete threw the whole video. Cheers to everyone who tried. Well first off we had to resize the video's so we can combine them. After that we broke the video up in 23 pieces and the watermarks appear 11 times threw the video. The ones on the sides where no problem, it was the one that moves across the screen and grows was the big challenge. The one that moves across the screen we had to cut up frame by frame till it starts growing. This was not easy and probably shouldnt of even bother but we where to far along to stop. After all watermarks where remove we adjusted all the cuts for light and dark scenes the best we could. Around 59min threw the video there a CAM drop or some lost of video and you here the CAM move around and we choose to remove that and now you cant even tell it happen. Oh we also remove the CAM movement in the beginning as well. We did all kinds of filters which we wont bore you with, So we hope you all enjoy this release till a better one comes out in a week or two.

CAM AUDIO: 
Denoiser and adjusted equalizer :)
