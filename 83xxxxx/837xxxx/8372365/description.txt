Episode 11:  Heading to Disaster

January 25th, 2010 En route to Addis Ababa, Ethiopian Airlines Flight 409 takes off from Beirut, Lebanon, with 90 people on board. As the plane climbs to cruising altitude, tower controllers ask the pilots to turn on to a new heading. The pilots acknowledge the instruction. But just moments later, the plane spirals out of control and crashes into the Mediterranean Sea. Several witnesses report seeing an explosion at the time of the crash leading investigators to suspect terrorism. But after almost two years of investigation they reach a very different and controversial conclusion.
