,neingott,2013-04-14T16:01Z,"Gracias @footy, espero sea de sky sports y que tengga el pre y el post de la carrera."
,ndtoronto,2013-04-14T16:11Z,"It has the pre and post show.  Its the BBC/Setanta feed for that.  The race is either BBC or Sky or 5 Live depending on what audio track you choose

I hope someone can get the Sky post race show.  I want to see the  Ted's Notebook feature"
,StenStyren,2013-04-14T16:32Z,This does not include the pre-/postshow! Only two hours long so no matter which audiotrack you choose you will not get to see it.
