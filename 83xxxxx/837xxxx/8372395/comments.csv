,WeanedOnGin,2013-04-17T07:02Z,"Awesome pointelite! I have tried various activators with no success, and some of the instructions just plain suck (stand on your head and go to cmd, then lay on your left side and hit enter, etc...), 
but your shit RULES! And it was fucking simple!  There was no way I was going to pay for 8, not worth it imho.

Thanks pointelite, you is da man!"

Can you help me?
Thanks."
,Cobra2500,2013-04-24T20:47Z,"I have the same issue, my download has stopped at 33.4% I really need this to work cause I did a different download of windows 8 and now it keeps asking me to validate it."
,JayCal,2013-04-29T22:07Z,This activator rules!!!! I already had installed windows 8 enterprise 64bit from another torrent but the activator was not working so I used the activator on this torrent and voila!!! it permanently activated my windows. the only thing I did that was not in the instructions is I disconnected my internet connection. I don't know if it was necessary but it worked just fine. Thank u so much pointelite u rock niggaaa!!!!
