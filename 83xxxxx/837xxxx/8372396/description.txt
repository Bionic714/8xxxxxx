DESCRIPTION:

The Cartel shows us our educational system like we've never seen it 

before. Behind every dropout factory, we discover, lurks a powerful, 

entrenched, and self-serving cartel.

Teachers punished for speaking out. Principals fired for trying to do the 

right thing. Union leaders defending the indefensible. Bureaucrats 

blocking new charter schools. These are just some of the people we meet 

in The Cartel. The film also introduces us to teens who can't read, 

parents desperate for change, and teachers struggling to launch stable 

alternative schools for inner city kids who want to learn. We witness the 

tears of a little girl denied a coveted charter school spot, and we share 

the triumph of a Camden homeschool's first graduating class.
