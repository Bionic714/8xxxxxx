""Unable to Launch Total Spaces""

Dock Got an Error: Can't Continue 
. (-1708)

Please call home,,,,

Pity!"
,bjornagainswede,2013-04-15T03:36Z,"Sorry...It does but it does not play nice if you are running Default Folder X.

Depending on where you have installed it to Nowse to Library/ScriptingAdditions/ and remove default folder X

Looks like one or th'other..."
,weebey7,2013-04-15T06:07Z,"So does the regular trial version work, or is it just the cracked app?
Maybe just an incompatibility all together with default folder x?"
,bjornagainswede,2013-04-15T08:12Z,"I got the same message both before and after applying the crack..

I then stripped out the  Default Folder X Addition.osax script and it launched and behaved fine without the messages. I have since put back the Default Folder.osax script and all seems well. I have not restarted the Machine though so I may run into the issue again on reboot in which case I may have to lose one or the pther app,,

Thanks again for the Up - this is a beaut of a Utility - Pre-Lion Spaces Functionality and Behaviour on ML..."

it does work, its just that when i change screen, in the grid it says ""trial period expired"""
,weebey7,2013-05-03T01:52Z,"Didn't even notice that... doesn't matter, it works flawlessly and it's barely noticeable."
