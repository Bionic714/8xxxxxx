,smcgill1969,2013-04-14T18:21Z,"FYI: I am using uTorrents' ""Initial-Seeding"" for the first time today - my upload (2x 18Mb/s) is already maxed out - from my understanding this means if you all share nicely with each other this will fully seed beyond me quicker. Let's see..."

,pkorus,2013-04-14T23:50Z,"thnx again !

too bad though you didnt read my comment on the China Qualifying torrent: 
the settings on your encode are not optimal for HDTV 720p content.. 
What program are you using for this? ever heard of Handbrake of MeGUI? Google is your friend.. 

hope you do something bout the quality on the Bahrain race

cheers

,mishu_edm,2013-04-15T00:39Z,"yes, I have to agree, too... 9.56 gb is useless if there's bad encoder settings
let me quote what uploaders of this f1 stuff on some forums are sayin' about your rip: 
""the format and quality is not as good as some other 720p rips."" 
so hope you'll do a great job next time :)"
,pkorus,2013-04-15T07:46Z,"I've seeded about 300 GB, think thats enough .."
,smcgill1969,2013-04-15T09:37Z,"Hi All, 

I do like to have a bit of banta with the likes of @Viciously et al, but I don't see any reason why I should explain why I upload the broadcast rip in the format I do - so here goes anyway;

Hardware: SkyHD -> HDCP Stripper -> EyeTVHD -> MacBook Pro

EyeTV records at 720p50 and then I export it using Elgato's built in (fast) AppleTV-HD preset, which suits _MY_ setup - I watch this back on a 63"" Samsung 63C7000 series TV with an AppleTV2.

Now the fun part, a lot of the time I will have do this WHEN I'M NOT AT HOME, I have to VPN/VNC back to my MacBook & do this remotely (whilst still doing my job)!

I've stream-lined my process so I can share this as quickly & as fuss-free as I can, this is how I do it & this is how I will continue to do it. 

The PirateBay is a democracy and no one is being forced to download, you don't even have to be 18 to get a vote here, just don't download if you don't like my settings - or do, and then complain bitterly, it's your choice - my sharing though is a dictatorship & I will not be loosing any sleep over it.

But ~2GB per hour for 720P that still plays on lower spec hardware - I'm happy enough with that, if you're not maybe you could download the 640x352 AVI version that I upload at the same time instead... :)

Cheers, smcgill1969.

,smcgill1969,2013-04-15T09:42Z,I should point out that I think some people believe this upload to be a bit wishy-washy on the video - I'm guessing they've never been to Shanghai - it's called air pollution & I'm glad I don't have to live there! :(
,mrjlr93,2013-04-15T10:13Z,"I don't know why people are complaining for last season there where some races where the total file size was 10.5gb from other sources, I really appreciate what smcgill1969 is doing for people that want to watch F1 in HD. I am also happy that smcgill1969 is providing the SKYF1 coverage as in my opinion it is the greatest coverage available.

Its not a big issue but it would be awesome if smcgill1969 you could have the Dolby 5.1 audio but i will take what i can get.

Thanks for uploading the races and i hope you continue to upload the rest of the season.  "
,mosh1111,2013-04-15T13:27Z,"someone answers me please , i get maximum download speeds on private tracker but when i download some torrents like this one in a public tracker which have a lot of seeders i cant get to 10 or 20 % of my speed , why is that ?"
,pkorus,2013-04-15T23:28Z,"to smcgill1969
I commented on your upload previously and thanked you for it.. so im not complaining..
to quote you on this:
- I should point out that I think some people believe this upload to be a bit wishy-washy on the video - I'm guessing they've never been to Shanghai - 

thats some BS imo , sorry.. dont want to offend you but pleeeeaasse compare your rip to that of FAIRPLAY..  
http://pirateproxy.net/torrent/8372869
the resolution maybe the same.. but the quality of the video is much more crisp..
I dont care even if the video was 20GB.. or even bigger! its just the quality that bothers me

oh and 1 tip on the file.. I think alot of ppl will thank you and appreciate it if you would split up the whole thing into ie : the pre-race -- race -- post race

just m 2 cents

cheers!"
,pkorus,2013-04-15T23:29Z,"to mosh1111

thats always the case with public torrents.. there are rarely seedboxes that do the initial seeding and alot of ppl hit 'n run so ur fucked like the rest of us.. ;)"
[V],albiondean,2013-04-16T08:58Z,"Well said smcgill1969, do it your way or not at all.
There seems to be people telling you the wrong and right way how to do things, funny thing is, when i click on their user name they haven't capped or posted anything of their own.  "
