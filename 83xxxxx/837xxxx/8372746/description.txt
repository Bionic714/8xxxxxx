Tiger Lillies - 2005 - Huinya

Huinya is a collaboration between Leningrad and The Tiger Lillies. Most of the songs are Tiger Lillies songs translated into Russian and performed by Leningrad and The Tiger Lillies. The album was recorded in 2003 and released in 2005.
Leningrad (╨¢╨╡╨╜╨╕╨╜╨│╤Ç╨░╨┤ in Russian) is a Russian ska punk band from Saint Petersburg (formerly Leningrad).
Composed of 14 members, the band appeared in the late 1990s around singer Sergey "Shnur" Shnurov (╨í╨╡╤Ç╨│╨╡╨╣ ╨¿╨╜╤â╤Ç╨╛╨▓). It soon became famous for its vulgar lyrics
The title can be loosely translated as "Crap". The Russian word "huinya" is part of the Russian vulgar slang, mat, and would more literally be translated "dickness". However, the album was released in Russia under the transliterated title "Huinya" (hence the "H" on the cover), which makes it somewhat less offensive compared to the Cyrillic spelling.
