,smcgill1969,2013-04-14T18:23Z,"FYI: I am using uTorrents' ""Initial-Seeding"" for the first time today - my upload (2x 18Mb/s) is already maxed out - from my understanding this means if you all share nicely with each other this will fully seed beyond me quicker. Let's see..."
,Viciously,2013-04-14T19:43Z,"Thanks for this.

BTW, do stop sharing your 2x18Mbps connection with that piece of shit 10gig upload.

Seed this to 100:1 first."

,SerSpec-V,2013-04-15T02:11Z,"A:9, V:5. Maybe a slightly higher bitrate and mkv or mp4 would be better than avi."
,nursemorph,2013-04-15T06:30Z,"Thankyou very much for uploading this. I can't afford Sky and don't like the BBC coverage so you are giving me a way to watch the F1. Much appreciated and please continue uploading

@Viciously: Are you deliberately trying to get him to stop uploading the coverage? Or are you one of these people that feels entitled somehow? You are bitching and moaning (on various of these torrents) about the files. Would you feel better if he stopped uploading them? Would that give you satisfaction, knowing you spoilt it for everyone else? I'm just glad he is finding all your comments amusing because some would wonder why bother uploading. Jeez....moaning about something that is free that someone else put work into? You are just sad"
,GhostRec0n,2013-04-15T07:48Z,"viciously: go fuck yourself you fuck wit!! fucking retard  F1 is too complicated for you to watch. better stick with your animal and gay porn, cunt!!"
,smcgill1969,2013-04-15T09:38Z,"Hi All, 

I do like to have a bit of banta with the likes of @Viciously et al, but I don't see any reason why I should explain why I upload the broadcast rip in the format I do - so here goes anyway;

Hardware: SkyHD -> HDCP Stripper -> EyeTVHD -> MacBook Pro

EyeTV records at 720p50 and then I export it using Elgato's built in (fast) AppleTV-HD preset, which suits _MY_ setup - I watch this back on a 63"" Samsung 63C7000 series TV with an AppleTV2.

Now the fun part, a lot of the time I will have do this WHEN I'M NOT AT HOME, I have to VPN/VNC back to my MacBook & do this remotely (whilst still doing my job)!

I've stream-lined my process so I can share this as quickly & as fuss-free as I can, this is how I do it & this is how I will continue to do it. 

The PirateBay is a democracy and no one is being forced to download, you don't even have to be 18 to get a vote here, just don't download if you don't like my settings - or do, and then complain bitterly, it's your choice - my sharing though is a dictatorship & I will not be loosing any sleep over it.

But ~2GB per hour for 720P that still plays on lower spec hardware - I'm happy enough with that, if you're not maybe you could download the 640x352 AVI version that I upload at the same time instead... :)

Cheers, smcgill1969.

,smcgill1969,2013-04-15T09:41Z,I should point out that I think some people believe this upload to be a bit wishy-washy on the video - I'm guessing they've never been to Shanghai - it's called air pollution & I'm glad I don't have to live there! :(
