I've grabbed stuff from you before, and always the quality is top drawer.
To release this, selecting thru so many variations of each title, is incredible.
I'll say it for all those that don't- thank you for your efforts..."

As a long time Bowie fan, may I suggest you give this collection a try ?

http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7383425/David_Bowie_-_24_Bit_Remastered_Series_-_Flac

These are audio cds released by EMI and in my opinion they provide a clearer and louder sound than any Rykodisc series.

They're not a complete discography like here as they begin with Bowie's second album (Space Oddity 1969) until Never Let Me Down 1987, and 8 songs are missing on the Aladdin Sane album.

But...

Thank you very much rjordan21 for uploading this complete Bowie discography. It's just great and all files look perfectly clean and enjoyable...

...though for some reason you chose not to upload any bonus files, maybe to match the original discography ?

[T],rjordan21,2013-04-19T19:01Z,"^^^ Unlike some other torrent-whoring posers here on TPB who get so sensitive when anyone posts a comment on ""their"" uploads (ridiculous, I didn't ask Mr. Bowie for permission to give HIS music away for free!) or loses their minds when someone asks a question about equipment (thinking the uploader actually created the torrent or ripped it themselves) and don't have the decency to say, ""sorry, I don't know what turntable was used 'cause I just re-uploaded this from another site"" I appreciate your comment woritstoh!  ;)

Thanks for the link.  I went back and did some serious listening and I still have to give the edge to the Ryko AU20 remasters here.  They were sourced from the original analog masters.  The 24bit files sounded thin in comparison and suffered from upper frequency digital harshness.... but that's just my opinion my friend.  Everyone's entitled to one!

and yes, I'm not really in to any bonus ""outakes"" or ""early versions"" of an Artists work,  If it wasn't good enough for the final release then....

I also like to stream an Artist's entire discography to my HiFi sometimes and let it randomally play.  Fun for me to hear a song from 1976 then one from 2011!  Makes for an interesting listen....

Thanks agian for the link.... I'm always interested in the ""best"" sound!  (or at leasy MY favorite)

Happy Listening....."
