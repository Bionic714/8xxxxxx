Jean-Pierre Vallarino - Lecture in Italy (RARE Private Footage) [Trailer]

Rare private record of JP's lecture in Italy from the early 1990's. It includes card magic, coin magic and close-up magic at its best!

The lecture is in french/italien language but you don't need to speak those languages because the instructions are really easy to follow. Smile

If you are a magic lover you can't miss this!!!
