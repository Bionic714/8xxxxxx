The McClure family is passionately restoring American glory, one classic car at a time. Their family business, Desert Valley Auto Parts, houses over 10,000 rust-free vehicles over 100 sun-baked Arizona acres. Not content with merely providing original parts for thousands of car collectors and restoration junkies each year, the McClures and their rag-tag crew are constantly on the hunt for cars to restore -- seeking them out in backyards, barns and even on their own massive lot.
