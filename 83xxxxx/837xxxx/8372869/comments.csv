,jswalski,2013-04-14T19:24Z,Is this sky? pre/post as well?
,jswalski,2013-04-14T19:31Z,Anyone upload sky pre and post race?
,gbrecht,2013-04-14T19:39Z,"Sky race only, in description."
,ndtoronto,2013-04-14T19:42Z,"Is Hannibal the only person who posted pre and post race Sky F1 coverage?  I know what happened to him but I can't believe no one else uploads the whole length of the coverage.

Thanks for the up"
,Incognito2781,2013-04-14T22:14Z,"any SkY pre/post floating around ? All I see is race only or rubbish BBC footage.
I really enjoy the pre and post shows."
,SerSpec-V,2013-04-15T06:17Z,Very good quality! 
,stuabroad,2013-04-15T16:26Z,Thanks; downloaded the BBC then realized it's nothing like the Sky footage.  Pity this is the race only - no Martin Brundle grid walk for example - but at least we have the race.
,Ataman,2013-04-15T21:24Z,Nice releases as always from fairplay but to my knowledge trophy ceremony is part of the race :(
,55trucker,2013-04-16T19:01Z,"Tony:

any chance you can upload the *hannibal* full Sky program at 9 gig?

I see it on one of the private servers, but it's not here on any torrents."
,55trucker,2013-04-16T19:05Z,"^Being on cable I cannot dl all of it because of ip restrictions that are imposed.

Here's a link to where I found it.

Freakshare allows 1 gig max segments @450kb/s, but when on cable you can only get one a day."
