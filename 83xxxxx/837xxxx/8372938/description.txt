This is the local newspaper from Columbus Ohio. 																										Please don't be a leecher only. This is a small file so please seed so the last 3-5 people can finish in a reasonable time. I watch almost daily as 8-12 download right away and only myself and maybe 1 other will seed for more than a few hours.
