In an NME interview, Chris said "We'll definitely start working on a new album next year " He went on to say "I think we'll definitely take some time off after this touring period because it's something we've never done. I think the most time we've had off is about six weeks in the last 12 years, so we're due a break." In another NME interview, Matt said that he was thinking about writing a more personal music project for their next album. "I sense that that's going to lead to a writing project that will be more personal, rather than talking about grand political concerns. That itself might lead to material that's more suitable for smaller venues."

Chris has said in a recent interview that the band want to do something "radically different" on their next album. The bassist told Kerrang! magazine that it felt like they were "drawing a line" under their past and were eager to embrace new ideas. He said:" feel like we are drawing a line under a certain period of what we've done in our career. It feels like it's time to move on and do something radically different." However, he also admitted that it wasn't always easy to progress and push their sound forward, adding: "But then you could get into the studio and go back to what you're comfortable with. You get in the studio and there's a natural process and you have to see where a song will take you."

On his Twitter account Matt jokingly described the album as a "christian gangsta rap jazz odyssey, with some ambient rebellious dubstep and face melting metal flamenco cowboy psychedelia".
