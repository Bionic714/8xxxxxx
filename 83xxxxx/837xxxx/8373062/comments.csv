,sevilalucard,2013-04-19T05:02Z,"Saint i think you mean a TC, TS has nothing to do with video thats Audio"
,ScottyD7421,2013-04-30T08:06Z,"Thanks for uploading ROthschild, much appreciated.

Checked out the sample and for a cam it's not bad. I'm a little confused about the ""No Watermarks"" comment though because the sample had a big blur in the middle of the picture. I guess you could mean that you have blurred out the watermark but in doing so you've created a big blur which to me is just the same as having a watermark? I could be wrong?

Anyway, from the sample i would say it's totally watch-able.

Based on sample i would rate the following;

V/8 - looks more like a TS then a regular cam. Picture is steady with no movements, bright and fairly clear.
A/8 - Clear audio and didn't appear to be any sync issues.

Please note the sample went for less than a minute and i have only rated based on the sample. I am downloading now and will report back if the actual movie differs from the sample.

Cheers again ROthschild. "
,ScottyD7421,2013-04-30T10:51Z,"Just finished watching and here is my report.

It is a regular cam but definitely one of the better ones. Picture is cropped top and bottom and has black lines however this doesn't detract from the movie. There is very little camera movement throughout the movie and a minor adjusting at the very beginning. The blurred watermark pops up now and again but after a while you don't really notice. There were no syncing issues and the audio was very clear for 99% of the movie. At approximately 1 hour and 36 minutes a couple of the scenes blur in and out but it only lasts a few minutes. All in all it is a good copy and an enjoyable movie.

Cheers "
