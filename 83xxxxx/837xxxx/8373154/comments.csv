,aljberry,2013-04-15T14:09Z,"How DARE bollywood take the name of one of the greatest action movies EVER, and use it for some cheesy, B quality movie like this..legit, its a insult to  Arnold Schwarzenegger..

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088944/"
,tpbse2010,2013-04-15T15:06Z,"@aljberry: DARE?? really?
Till the time Hollywood does not own copyrights to words in the dictionary, suck it , you piece of xenophobic shit!!"
,Proper_Rating,2013-04-15T15:57Z,"@tpbse2010 

Could you tell us the quality please?  Your comments about it being cheesy and what not don't inform us of the video quality.  

Plus the original Commando was a shit movie with shit actors all around.  An Italian played a Columbian criminal.  And a German played an American Soldier.  Neither pulled off proper accents.  Shit movie, the original Commando."

,v3blotto,2013-04-16T05:29Z,"Here is another reason these Bollywood movies suck chode. 
The movie Commando wasn't an awesome movie because it was well played or even because it was well acted. It was an awesome movie because of what it brought to the genre at the time. You obviously don't understand this, it's a cultural thing.

Using the name is akin to doing a remake of Lawrence of Arabia but doing it entirely using Mexican actors in a field of rolled oats. 

It wasn't so long ago that the world viewed the middle east as exotic and intriguing but like everything else middle east it's just the nasty shit flowing down the Ganges river. 

The fact that @tpbse2010 chooses to be some racist scumbag doesn't help that this movie could have been called a hundred other things without pissing off 7/8 of the movie goers. 

Good Job guys, another reason not to see this pile of shit. Is Indian commando a metaphor for some guy not wearing underwear? It sounds as frightening as a group of ice cream men para dropping into a school yard."
