,Aphoniac,2013-04-15T02:47Z,Seed please? Just finished season one and stoked to get into 2.
,cavalerul123,2013-04-15T15:28Z,ok
,Ooinn,2013-04-16T21:50Z,"Season 2, Episodul 1 is in Japanese only

The audio track is Japanese / Japanese.

*I assume S2, Episodul 00 refers to the OVA of this season.

The rest of the episodes for s1 and s2 are dual-audio"
,Ooinn,2013-04-17T00:02Z,EDIT: Apparently the English audio track is mis-labeled as 'Japanese'
,cavalerul123,2013-04-17T19:28Z,use VLC player like VLC to season 2 will not look than Japanese
,Ooinn,2013-04-20T03:57Z,I just used MKVTool to correct the mis-label.
