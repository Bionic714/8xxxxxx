Scoops is considered the first British S.F. magazine, although, at the time it was sometimes referred to as a comic. Published by Pearson, London.
This is a rare title nowadays and of great interest is that, "The Poison Belt" by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is serialised from #13. The scans are from old tired, copies and the text might be difficult to read in places but the illustrations are excellent.
#1 is missing page 2 and the cover is from the internet.
