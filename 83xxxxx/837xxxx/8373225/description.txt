The updated, cornerstone engineering resource of solar energy theory and applications. Solar technologies already provide energy for heat, light, hot water, electricity, and cooling for homes, businesses, and industry. Because solar energy only accounts for one-tenth of a percent of primary energy demand, relatively small increases in market penetration can lead to very rapid growth rates in the industry???which is exactly what has been projected for coming years as the world moves away from carbon-based energy production. Solar Engineering of Thermal Processes, Third Edition provides the latest thinking and practices for engineering solar technologies and using them in various markets.

This Third Edition of the acknowledged leading book on solar engineering features:
Complete coverage of basic theory, systems design, and applications
Updated material on such cutting-edge topics as photovoltaics and wind power systems
New homework problems and exercises
