Sonja i bik 2012

Especially from HRT ...

The film has a very good picture quality, but the sound - it's a completely different story, sound spoils the experience of each second of the movie.

The story begins interestingly, continues a little bit off-road, but at the middle of the storyline story is lost on a off-road rally race - goes to something that has nothing to do with either Sonja or with the bull, but with inconsistent characters who are trying to complement the duration of the movie.

The film offers a couple of interesting characters, such as the butcher, but most of them are poorly characterized.

As for the miser humor in the film: it's cheap and inadequate. Watching Sonja and the bull is more like watching a social drama with elements of comedy, than watching a comedy. In fact, humor appears as much as unnecessary nudity.

In short, the film offers a one-time "entertainment" for a Sunday afternoon.

Note to parents: keep in mind that the film contains EXPLICIT CONTENT, so first watch the movie by yourselves in order to assess how much the movie could be interesting to your children.
