Beaucoups of Blues is the second album by former Beatles member Ringo Starr,
very far removed in style from its predecessor. While playing on sessions for
George Harrison's All Things Must Pass, StarrΓÇöa long-time country and western
fanΓÇömet Pete Drake. Realising Drake's deep connection to country (having also
played on Bob Dylan's Nashville Skyline), Starr asked him if they could
collaborate on an album together. Drake promptly told Starr his musician
friends could compose more than an album's worth of material in a week, which
Starr thought was "impossible". Starr was very keen and agreed. He flew from
London to Nashville on 29 June to begin working on the project.
