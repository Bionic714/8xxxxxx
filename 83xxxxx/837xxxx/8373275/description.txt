Goodnight Vienna is the fourth album by Ringo Starr. It was recorded in the
summer of 1974 in Los Angeles, and released later that year. Goodnight Vienna
followed the commercially successful predecessor Ringo, and Starr used many of
the same players, including Billy Preston, Klaus Voormann, Robbie Robertson,
Harry Nilsson, and producer Richard Perry. The title comes from an English
slang phrase meaning roughly, "It's all over".
