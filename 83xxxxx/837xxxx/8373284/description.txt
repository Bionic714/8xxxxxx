The Honeycombs were an English beat/pop group, founded in 1963 in North London.
The group had one chart-topping hit, the million selling "Have I the Right?",
in 1964. After that song the interest in the group ebbed away, and they split
up in late 1966. The group's most distinguishing mark was their female drummer,
Honey Lantree.
