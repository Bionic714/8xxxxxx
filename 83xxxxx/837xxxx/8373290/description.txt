Tiger Lillies - 2007 - Love and War

A Tribute (of sorts) to Monteverdi is a fusion of the familiar squeeze-box stomp of the Tiger Lillies and the baroque harpsichord flourishes of McGuinness. Inspired by Monteverdi's Madrigals of Love and War, the new works touch on murder, rape and mutilation. And Jacques' vocals - his voice is the missing link between classical falsetto and Berlin cabaret - range from a Tom Waits growl to an angelic operatic warble as he rages against religious and political hypocrisy in times of war. Mark Fisher - The Scotsman

What The Tiger Lillies have come up with - Songs of Love and War - is, on the evidence of the preview CD, both aural seduction and assault in the same breath. There is edgy beauty, rage and a sense of politics. Sarah Unwin Jones - The Herald

The Tiger Lillies (collaborating with David McGuinness of Concerto Caledonia) present their tribute to Monteverdi's Madrigals of Love and War. Harpsichord, Accordion, church organ and musical saw unite in songs of the futility of war.
