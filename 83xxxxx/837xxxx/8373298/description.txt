ZD Soft Screen Recorder is a high performance screen recording software program. It works just like a real camcorder. A real camcorder can record many real world things including computer screen, while ZD Soft Screen Recorder can only record computer screen but can do much better than a real camcorder on screen recording, because software screen recording is crystal-clear, pixel by pixel, 100% true color reproduction, non-interfering, no shaking and no noise. You may need ZD Soft Screen Recorder when you want to capture what you see on computer screen, as well as what you hear and/or your narration
