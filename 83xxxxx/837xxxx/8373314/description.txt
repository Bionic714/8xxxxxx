This file contains four .PDF files that include two samples of my writing from my self-published E-books that are entitled I AM DESTINY'S CHILD AND OTHER POEMS A COLLECTION and TERWILLIGER'S TOMBSTONE TERROR.  The poetry sampler showcases six of forty-two verses that give readers an idea about how I view my life as a disabled and gay man.  TERWILLIGER'S TOMBSTONE TERROR is a nostalgic novella that deals with how a boy and his newfound friend thwart a pesky school bully.


The remaining two .PDF files are a call to action to share the files if what is read is liked and a listing of where all my other works can be purchased.


I appreciate all downloads, likes and purchases.
