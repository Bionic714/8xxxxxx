,fuginator,2013-04-15T00:36Z,Thank you for this. Been looking for it. :}
,BagOfMoney,2013-04-15T03:19Z,"Version 4.98 updates fine on my home system. But on the dedi that our station is run on, which is Windows Server R2 2008. Everything registers and updates fine with 4.9.8, except Runtime Error 217. Causes nothing but a lock up from hell.

Ran a Registry fix and everything, but 4.98 just locks up and won't get away from runtime error 217. 

I just rolled it back to 4.96, which works flawlessly.
...FYI :)

For those without the Runtime error, enjoy this sweet update."
,BlackDragontc,2013-04-15T04:26Z,"Will Be testing this out tonight, Thank you for this. I have 4.9.2 it works brilliantly , but i love upgrades "
,BlackDragontc,2013-04-15T06:39Z,"Sorry i got a problem Windows 7 64 SP1, it statics after doing everything that was put into instructions.

Even did this on Windows XP SP3.

Ducking down to 4.9.2. 

If there is anything missing let me know, i can screen record the whole and put it on youtube. Because this crack does work 4.9.2 without no problems."
,hchristo,2013-04-15T07:10Z,THX It WOrks :D
,Gypsiee,2013-04-16T07:48Z,Where can someone find 4.96 that is cracked that works?
,BlackDragontc,2013-04-19T16:26Z,I guess you won't comment back on this.
,Cosmic_Rocker,2013-04-20T20:20Z,"I remember finding this KeyGen with patch but it was for SAM Broadcaster Studio.  When I ran that the audio would put out a loud hiss and fast forward.  Maybe this one is different we'll have to see about it and if so maybe it will at least upgrade me to 4.9.8.  I'll let you know when I have the time to try it.  Its not 2013, but the last of the 4.9 series."
,Cosmic_Rocker,2013-04-20T21:22Z,"@BagOfMoney

Thanks so very much for this GREAT upload.  Its what I've been waiting for.  Installed it, ran the patch, Ran the KeyGen on SAM Broadcaster 4xx Pro and started SAM.  At first the Encoders had to be re set as it was different than 4.9.1.  After the first song the player played at fast speed but I re set it to normal stopped the encoder and the player and re started it.  Now so far everything was fine.  I guess it had to re do the database file or something when I upgraded and at first it took a while to patch things up.  Thank God I'll let you all know."
,Cosmic_Rocker,2013-04-20T22:01Z,No good folks starts playing at fast speed after the second or third song.  Can't get the sound to sound normal at all.  I ended up putting the patched exe file that I had for 4.9.1 back in there to replace the one for 4.9.8 and it works but we're back to 4.9.1.  It was very close to working but no dice folks.
,BagOfMoney,2013-04-21T02:44Z,"Yeah me too. I'm back to 4.9.1. This may work on some brand new installs, but as far as overwriting a current install, it will muck up your config and no files will play. They'll have a loud screech and that's it..."
,BagOfMoney,2013-04-21T02:45Z,"As far as 4.9.6, there is no cracked version of 4.96. 4.97 was the closest."
,Cosmic_Rocker,2013-04-21T18:53Z,"@BagOfMoney: any word on SAM Broadcaster 2013?  From what I've read it is suppose to correct all the issues that V9 had (though V 9.1 is the most stable of them all).  What is nice is that it works in Windows 8 as well as 7.  Right now I have Win 7 but thinking of buying my wife a computer for her video games she plays and if I buy a new machine I may just get me one hell of a PC for the station and all my audio/video needs and give her my old PC.  I want one with an i7 processor or greater, 8GB Ram, 8 MB cache, 1-2 TB HDD.  This should run a damn sweet Album rock station that is Rock solid."
,BagOfMoney,2013-04-24T01:41Z,I would Try ProppFrexx. It's now available for everyone to try out.
,FKNL,2013-04-28T20:32Z,Doesn't work on Windows 8. Currently running a VM with SAM 4.9.1 in it.
