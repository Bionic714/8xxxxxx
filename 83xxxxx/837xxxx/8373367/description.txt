Charlie Chaplin's comedic masterwork - which charts a hapless prospector's search for fortune in the Klondike and his discovery of romance (Georgia Hale)-forever cemented the iconic status of Chaplin and his Little Tramp character. Shot partly on location in the Sierra Nevadas and featuring such timeless gags as Chaplin's dance of the dinner rolls and meal of boiled shoe leather, The Gold Rush is an indelible work of nonstop hilarity.
