,DjordjeL,2013-04-15T20:23Z,"@Afatsum070 unfortunately you can't buy the game on mac because it was never released. maybe you mean black ops I. 
if it is the real one, we ask for some evidence if possible. thanks :)"
,Kproct0r,2013-04-16T11:32Z,I am betting this is fake.  there isnt a native version and its impossible to port it yet since wine still doesnt support dx11 which is needed for the game.  -.-

""Guys I make a mistake. I will reupload it. Sorry.""

""How fuck do you know it. You can buy the game for mac.""

They should ban your IP! If you can ""Biy"" Black Ops 2 for Mac the tell us where because googling it brings up absolutely NOTHING but this fake torrent!

Furthermore it was bad enough on Windows and had some ridiculous date locked crack to play the game... and then playing it - nothing special until it came to that Ridiculous tactical ops mission...  I quit to desktop, deleted the game and saved myself a lot of Disk Space... Rubbish!

Wanna play good games? Assassin's Creed (any of them), Borderlands, Batman (Arkham City or Asylum)... Tomb Raider (Gamer of the year this - it's awesome!) or if you have the patience for boss upon boss upon boss.... there is always that Biochock dross... I cannot stand a game when you're still trying to get to grips with the basics of it when suddenly you are thrown in at the very deep end... it's a total head wrecker... but even that is better than a fake torrent and a waste of days trying to help seed something that is not genuine..."
,Afatsum070,2013-04-16T23:46Z,bjornagainswede and the other if you think that this is a fake torrent don't download it. Just ignore it. 
,Afatsum070,2013-04-16T23:47Z,I dont force you to download it.
,sebolito,2013-04-18T18:08Z,"yes :D dont bother downloading, hehe ill keep waiting the re-upload and seeders again"

,Afatsum070,2013-04-20T11:01Z,I am working really hard  know trying to port games.
,ljson890,2013-04-23T10:22Z,i can't download its too slow. 
,Afatsum070,2013-04-23T15:54Z,"dont download ljson890, I sayed that when I port the game from pc to mac I make a mistake, I swear it worked for me. SO"
,wolf277,2013-04-26T08:32Z,"Afatsum070 please remove this, this is NOT black ops 2, this is black ops 1, if you click on the blue ""503"" next to files, we can see the contents of the .app as a matter of fact, you can see the black ops 1 mission files in the code, like vorkuta, hue city, kowloon, etc. You aren't fooling anyone anymore buddy, can someone please remove this torrent, it is FAKE!"
,ClubQBall,2013-04-29T08:49Z,"This has been reported on the Forum as a mislabeled fake.

@Afatsum070 ... my best advice to you is don't try to fool the very people you need on your side to become a successful / popular torrent uploader.  Fucking over / with us is the LAST thing you want to do, bud."
