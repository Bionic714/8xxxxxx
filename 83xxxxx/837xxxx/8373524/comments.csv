,one_of_7.500.000.000,2013-04-18T17:09Z,"New Fresh friends I would say. I'm stuck on 46,5% three days already and nobody is seeding. F*ck."
,neterciser,2013-04-27T01:21Z,"Well, it's two weeks after post and torrent stuck on 72% with still only 1 seed... very frustrating as there are always great songs on this list!"
,The_Barman,2013-05-04T01:27Z,Its quite disappointing that people with a lot of new fresh acclimation marks are not even able to seed their own torrent. 
,dragonbandit314,2013-05-16T21:03Z,Appreciated. Always worth the wait. As always I seed to well above 10:1 and my machine is always on. Be well
