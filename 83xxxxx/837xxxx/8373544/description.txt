Winner of the International Peace Prize at the 1953 Berlin Film Festival and considered "one of the really important postwar Japanese films, Where Chimneys Are Seen focuses primarily on the interconnected lives of two couples in a lower-middle-class neighborhood in Senju, a poor industrial section of Tokyo. The narrative is structured as a series of juxtaposed scenes that dramatize this connection and show the cause and effect of events on the couples' lives. As part of this structure, there is the central motif of the chimneys and the kinds of "lyrical" interludes for which Gosho is famous.
