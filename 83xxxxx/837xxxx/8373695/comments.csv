I still dont understand why there are people who prefer the AVI formats over the MP4s. Mp4s are typically smaller size, higher resolution, and compatible with multiple different devices.

For instance, when im on the go, the x264s play excellently on my android phone with the native video player. 

Just throwing it out there"
