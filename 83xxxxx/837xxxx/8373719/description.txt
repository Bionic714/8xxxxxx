When Peter, Quagmire and Joe fly on a 
private plane to Canada, they crash in the 
middle of the wilderness, far from 
civilization. Peter is chosen to find 
help, but ends up going missing for two 
months, only to be found as a feral 
creature with no ability to communicate 
intelligently. The Griffins must find a 
way to bring back Peter to his old self.
