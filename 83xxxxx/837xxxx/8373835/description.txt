This is out of print and hard to find. Jami Gertz was great and Martha Plimpton gives one her best performances in this.

Fact-based story of a 19 year old ballerina (Gertz) whose collapse on stage leads to the discovery that she has cancer. Transferred to a specialty clinic, she rooms with a working class girl (Plimpton) who is directly in conflict with the more refined girl. With both facing their potential deaths, an unlikely bond is formed.

Starring Jami Gertz, Martha Plimpton, George Peppard, Bruce Payne, Rip Torn & Theresa Merritt.
