I am unsure about this. I haven't tried anything new. This is from a while back. It is difficult to do. I have a mac on one boot and win 8 on the other. Garage Band works better than any Windows software. But mostly...this is Elvis Costello. I put his voice in the same area as Michael Stipes from REM. They both sing kinda of the same to me. I am not sure if they sing a little of pitch on purpose or what it is I notice but it is difficult to match. I wanted to upload something and I haven't been on the mac recently.
