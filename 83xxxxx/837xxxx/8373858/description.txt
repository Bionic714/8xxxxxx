Review:
In a well-publicized late 2011 interview, James Blake drew his line in the sand on the Great Dubstep Debates. The boy who fell for the emotional resonance of bone-disintegrating sub-bass only after years of playing piano privately came out against the American version of guys like Skrillex (whom he couldnΓÇÖt even be bothered naming). Such performers, Blake contended, appealed strictly to a ΓÇ£testosterone-driven, frat-boy marketΓÇ¥ that couldnΓÇÖt be more different from the Feist-and-Joni covers and Bon Iver duets pouring out of the Londoner whoΓÇÖd just turned 23. Blake argued that his music was not only more egalitarian-- appealing to women and men equally-- but was also a purer representation of dubstep as an idea. It was a misrepresentation of American dubstepΓÇÖs audiences and a presumptuous statement about What Women Want, sure, but at the same time, it was hard to fault Blake for forcefully trying to stake his claim to a patch of land within a genre broad enough to incorporate a rave resurgence and a brooding folkie.
