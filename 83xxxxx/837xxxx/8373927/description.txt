What would you do with one month to change the world? Family man Dennis Sykes must answer that very question when he intervenes in a botched robbery and is exposed to a deadly mix of medical waste. Dennis is left with a diagnosis of terminal cancer - but also gifted with the ability to mold solid matter at will! With the clock ticking, one ordinary man must learn how to be extraordinary as he uses his new found abilities to save the galaxy and leave behind the legacy of a husband, a provider and a hero. If he hopes to succeed, he'll need help from an all-star roster of Marvel's finest - including Spider-Man, the Fantastic Four and the Avengers!
