@dhjudasx:

You did not find ULTIMATE CUT of this movie  Watchmen 3hr 35 min (215 minutes)."
,reddragon92,2013-04-15T20:42Z,"@Judas: Thnx bro, never seen any 1080p copy for this size n quality.

@rajakumar: Cant u just dwnld whatever is being uploaded. Every movie that is being uploaded, you have some nitpicking to do. I have seen it all the posts of Judas and also other encoders. If u r so interested in getting the proper copy, why not just buy them from amazon or from ur local stores. Or just netflix them if u cant afford it. Be thnnkful for the stuff ur getting for free."
[V],dhjudasx,2013-04-15T21:34Z,I do plan on doing ultimate cut later...much later.. when I get the bluray back.

@reddragon92:

Man I am talking to the uploader not u buddy, are u Judas?. If no, then shut the fuck up u asshole. I know what i am doing. The Judas's torrent description says ""Feel free to leave a + vote and a comment, Thank You!"" so that's what i am doing. It's none of your business why don't u keep your mouth shut."
,rorkovacs,2013-04-16T02:31Z,"dont want to overstep any boundaries but YIFY had uploaded the ULTIMATE CUT a few months ago

,rorkovacs,2013-04-16T02:33Z,"thanks again judas.....freaking awesome. 

do you have a lits of the Blu-Rays you have? i know you will upload em when you have a chance (very kind of you) but maybe we can request from that list itself (ynkow like priority)"
[V],dhjudasx,2013-04-16T06:50Z,"Yeah yify's upload.. still no 5.1 in it though.. and some people wanted the directors rather than ultimate..

reason i'll be uploading both.

as for a list..

it's out of date"
,rajakumar,2013-04-16T14:26Z,"@Judas:

Yes, I know YIFY uploaded a few months ago and does not have 5.1 DD in it, it has only 2.0 stereo. The difference in both yify's ultimate and judas's director cut are 30mins more length in ultimate cut. The ultimate cut has more lengthy when compared to titanic 3hour 15min."
,buenio,2013-04-17T11:29Z,Judas can you upload THE GODFATHER TRILOGY because i don't want to download a very great film to other uploader.
,buenio,2013-04-17T11:36Z,Judas can you upload The Godfather Trilogy w/ 5.1 and Django Unchained because i don't want to download a greatest film to other uploaders thanks
,mariee24,2013-04-17T13:45Z,"Hi will download this for sure ur rips r way more superior to yify, anyhow could u possibly squeeze, Legends of the Guardians-The Owls of Ga Hoole, in when you get a chance. There is currently no mp4 1080p version anywhere plenty of mkv's. It would be golden in ur 5.1 version. Many thanks to all ur patience with all ur supporters. "
[V],dhjudasx,2013-04-17T21:57Z,"i still don't have django or god fother trilogy on hand.. sorry

legend of the guardians .... uploaded.. i actually was planning on doing it next lol"
,allblackbatman,2013-04-18T03:12Z,yify's rips are no comparison to Judas.  Yify's may look good at first but as soon as there is movement or any complex video It's block city. I replace all my movies with Judas's rips. Each upload I am amazed at how perfect the picture is with such a tiny file size.  (only exception was Avatar which you explained about in the description)
,pro346pro,2013-04-18T12:23Z,"if anyone is interested this rip of watchmen ultimate cut is done in ""judas style"" http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8183395/Watchmen_The_Ultimate_Cut_1080p_x264_AAC_BRRip_BRait very good quality"
[V],dhjudasx,2013-04-18T17:18Z,"pretty good attempt... ;)

Only suggestion I'd make to the encoder for that is to have cropped out the black parts of the film.. this would dramatically increase the video quality Substantially."
,pro346pro,2013-04-19T10:10Z,@judas 1920*800 wouldn't this mean the black bars were cropped???
[V],dhjudasx,2013-04-19T20:07Z,"Yes... 1920x800 means the 140 pixels above and 140 below (280 total) were cropped out for encoding.

There is Nothing beneficial for encoding a 1920x800 film AS 1920x1080... only purely cons."
,pro346pro,2013-04-20T02:06Z,@Judas yeah I know that  I thought you were saying that the encoder hadn't cropped the black bars but he had .
,Nelix192,2013-05-08T18:13Z,Thanx!
