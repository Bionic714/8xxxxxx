,Drewski4747,2013-04-15T04:23Z,"@Soulesne, it was posted 6 minutes ago, and everyone wants to download it. People have to actually have a chance to download it before they can seed o.O"
,sparxx007,2013-04-15T04:24Z,"slow going on this one, http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8374144/Game.of.Thrones.S03E03.720p.HDTV.x264-EVOLVE_[PublicHD] seems to be going the fastest of the 4 I am currently downloading"
,jonathanjonathan,2013-04-15T04:34Z,"you stupid fucking retarded kids, if you upload you will be able to download faster! 

UPLOAD ASWELL, dont turn UPLOAD OFF !!!!!"
,maximkt,2013-04-15T04:38Z,i agree with soulesne!!!
,TheRealKeyserSoze,2013-04-15T04:42Z,"Leeching assholes?  What does that make you, Soulesne?  Stupid scumbag!"
,baatezu_,2013-04-15T04:59Z,What is a seeder?
,gibbywmu,2013-04-15T05:03Z,"Guys...forgive me, I'm new at this!!! I've downloaded 2 episodes so far, worked great!! I'm using Bit Torrent. How do I share these so other people can get them also? I can't figure it out!!"
,Hancock79,2013-04-15T05:08Z,"Drarbg's torrents seem to go decent speed for me right away for some reason.  Like minutes after they're uploaded.  This was 45 minutes total, usually hours on other torrents"
,Addifreyr,2013-04-15T05:12Z,pls seed!!! we are all waiting!!
,blackhelio,2013-04-15T05:17Z,Whoever has the best internet wins here. 
,acsmith1972,2013-04-15T05:20Z,"Gibby: Leave the program running and don't change any settings that would stop sharing. If you leave it on it's default settings (not optimal, but okay for novices) and running you'll be sharing. "
,kristiej,2013-04-15T05:31Z,"@gibbywmu: Just let it automatically seed(upload to other people) till a decent share ratio(uploaded/downloaded).
Please try to share till ratio=1 atleast. I personally share till 100 but then I have an awsome connection :)"
,zrctnga,2013-04-15T05:33Z,"Downloading for 30 minutes and can't go over 250kbps. SSEEEEEEEDDDDDDD, wtf is wrong with this world?"
,Unzippedx,2013-04-15T05:35Z,"12 KiB/s download.

Very nice..."
,alrightiwill,2013-04-15T05:36Z,The EVOLVE release has the last 2 minutes of dialogue cut off. Hopefully a Scene PROPER will be up soon or just wait for a Web-DL.
,njekt,2013-04-15T05:51Z,"alrightiwill is correct.

the last 2 minutes of this release has audio cutoff. and it seems (cant say for sure cause i cant hear the dialog) to be during a dramatic moment."
,Justkanji,2013-04-15T06:02Z,Why are there so many different torrents for the same release ~.~
,Axter,2013-04-15T06:26Z,"PUT THIS MAN TO THE SWORD!
WHAT KIND OF JOKE IS THIS??
I'm a musician and you made me hate music right there..

DONT DOWNLOAD! NOT PROPER"
,kristiej,2013-04-15T06:27Z,"@Justkanji: Free market lol.
Loads of people competing to provide a service(releasing scene releases to the world) :D"
[V],Drarbg,2013-04-15T06:32Z,"Only the SD release is nuked , not the HD(720p) one ( this one) , so stop trolling"
,stevewashere,2013-04-15T06:43Z,"OMG this is slow, Im uploading 3 times the speed Im downloading...

Can anyone see if the last 2 mins of Audio is there, as mentioned earlier?"
,CapPanda,2013-04-15T08:03Z,For the best speed set your upload to 50% of your download.  If you average say 1.0 Mbps on download once it finds peers then set your upload to 500 Kbps.  Sometimes you may spend more bandwidth on uploading than downloading but in the long run you will download faster.  The number of peers you are allowed to download from is proportionate to your upload.
,Bring_Back_Demonoid,2013-04-15T08:20Z,"So is the last two minutes of audio bad on the 720p release or not? 

I'm reading two fucking different answers. Someone who has watched the 720p version, please answer ! "
,kiwij,2013-04-15T08:47Z,"Audio seems fine, no missing audio at the end.  I think it is only the SD release that had problems.  This torrent is ok."
,omgzelda,2013-04-15T08:49Z,great release! ending credit song is a stupid rock song but its still cool
,kiwij,2013-04-15T08:51Z,"Just watched this, the audio is fine.  The missing audio only effected the SD release."
,kiwij,2013-04-15T08:52Z,"I watched this the audio is fine, it was only the  original SD release that had problems."
,ImmaDLStf,2013-04-15T12:57Z,"""2 seeders, 60 peers, 58 leeching assholes"", said the leeching asshole.
Jesus, the Pirate Bay community makes the LoL and CoD communities look downright pleasant. Torrent hasn't been up for more than 20 minutes and already complaining about slow download speed."
,ImmaDLStf,2013-04-15T12:59Z,@Axter I'm pretty sure that's part of the episode. At least get your facts straight before bitching.
,petator,2013-04-15T14:00Z,"Perfect! Seeding, thnx alot!

(for spanish people, spanish subs:

,stonebonez,2013-04-15T20:00Z,"Audio is legit all the way through to the credits.

Thanks for the up!"
,dereg22,2013-04-15T23:49Z,"The real shit, thanks uploader. Will seed."
,ben303,2013-04-16T06:39Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!

the last two minutes of this have a rock song imposed over it. All of you idiots that think this is part of the actual episode are clueless. It is some error with the recording. Either when recorded someone changed the audio channel or it has been imposed over as a joke.

I am an audio engineer and music producer and this is the 100% situation. "
,Hancock79,2013-04-16T08:26Z,"I'm pretty sure Ben303 is joking, because no one is this stupid.  But if you listen to the lyrics you will know the rock song was in the right place."
,Hancock79,2013-04-16T08:40Z,"and no one would really give a shit if it didn't belong either.  Most releases have the credits cut out entirely, telling someone to not bother with this torrent based on that is silly."
