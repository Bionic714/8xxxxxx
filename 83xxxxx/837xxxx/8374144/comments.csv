,PENGUIN1234,2013-04-15T04:22Z,"It says there are no seeders, but utorrent claims that there are 611 in swarm. Even with no seeds its downloading at 320 kb/s avg. "
,sparxx007,2013-04-15T04:25Z,this is downloading faster than most of the others available
,ddudes,2013-04-15T05:11Z,"I go 4 it now, let‘s see,."
[T],Danimal1q2w3,2013-04-15T05:13Z,Thanks !! :)
,Grotslag,2013-04-15T05:16Z,Gotta watch GOT in HD. Thanks. :)
,alrightiwill,2013-04-15T05:35Z,The EVOLVE release has the last 2 minutes of dialogue cut off. Hopefully a Scene PROPER will be up soon or just wait for a Web-DL. 
,zrctnga,2013-04-15T05:37Z,I'm having the same avg speed as PENGUIN 1234...maybe lower. But still better that the others...
,andrewIII,2013-04-15T06:49Z,"Does anybody know if this one has the dialog replaced with shitty rock music at 52:35 like the other torrents? I'm seriously so pissed off, the show has been going a bit slow and that scene was tense as fuck, only to have that garbage pop up as the scene was getting intense."
,yu4657,2013-04-15T07:02Z,Those last two minutes were MAJORLY FUCKED UP. Hoping the HD releases aren't nuked like the SD are
,smoker05,2013-04-15T07:30Z,wow I am getting download speed of 0.2KBps. Amazing.
,sunsetrider,2013-04-15T07:45Z,so is this one also fucked up in the last two minutes?
,andrewIII,2013-04-15T08:00Z,"@sunsetrider: I downloaded an EVOLVE[RARBG] at first, and starting at 52:35 the ending credits started rolling over the dialogue. I downloaded this and just skipped ahead to about 52:15 and the problem wasn't there at all. However, the audio appeared to be somewhat out of sync, so I don't know if I would recommend this. Maybe do what I did and download the other torrent(which was 10/10 all the way through until the last 30 seconds or so of the show before the credits) and this for the last bit of dialogue and just delete it afterwards."
,richkill9,2013-04-15T08:03Z,I have downloaded 3.5% and am uploading faster than my download! Screw the non seeders!!!
,jeso6778,2013-04-15T08:11Z,"Dibya's releases are usually perfect, is this one fucked up?"
,crumrugin,2013-04-15T08:20Z,"^^^ yes you should abort and look for ""proper"" copy"
,jeso6778,2013-04-15T08:26Z,there is no proper HD...
,LackThereof,2013-04-15T08:27Z,This is actually how it aired on the east coast.  HBO is developing a pattern of doing this.  
,Cbergur,2013-04-15T08:28Z,"its not that people aren't seeding its 20,000 or so leeching off 7,000 "
,kiwij,2013-04-15T08:46Z,"Audio is perfect on this release, no missing audio."
,ddudes,2013-04-15T08:53Z,"One hour and 50 min. with 10 Mbit bandwith.
Thanks Dibya. Much appreciated. "
,ddudes,2013-04-15T08:58Z,"Down in 1.50 hour,. with 10 Mbits bandwidth,. 
Not checked out the quality yet."

,thegh0sts,2013-04-15T09:45Z,on usenet there's an immerse release...is that real or fake?
,name112,2013-04-15T10:01Z,@DibyaTPB Im curious to why there is only 2 channel audio every week?
,thegh0sts,2013-04-15T11:17Z,the recap is 2.0 but the actual episode is 5.1.
,HoldenVR,2013-04-15T12:14Z,"FIXED TORRENT BELOW:

The audio is fine on this one http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8374342/Game.of.Thrones.S03E03.PROPER.HDTV.x264-2HD%5Brartv%5D

PLEASE SEED. Alot of people are trying to get this, don't be selfish and seed your copy!"
,hekler80,2013-04-15T13:19Z,"The show has gotten even better in this season. Btw, I think this episode here is in full b4 the credits roll,,,its just that the very end might have been too gory to leave it in for some people?!"
,cloudsora,2013-04-15T14:07Z,I'm waiting for the 1080p web but holy crap 20k seeders and 16k leechers... I haven't seen numbers that large in a while.
