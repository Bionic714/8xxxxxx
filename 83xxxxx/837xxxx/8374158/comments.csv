,darkizzle,2013-04-15T04:32Z,Yes! I really hated how Brienne died in the book. But the way Jaime missed her after was really important to his character. But whatever I've really been looking forward to this episode!

,noybinhd,2013-04-15T05:19Z,"Brienne did not die in the book. If you want to do spoilers at least give real info lol.

She is captured, not dead, and she actually has an out available to her. "

,PreatorX,2013-04-16T10:10Z,"Just to warn everyone, this one doesn't have the proper ending, a song cuts in in the last 6 minutes obscuring the audio. Uploader seems to be playing a joke on a lot of people."
,thewizardchrist,2013-04-16T10:25Z,I will never download your shit again you rank dick faggot.
,thewizardchrist,2013-04-16T10:37Z,"Reading the comments I am reminded there are always some smarmy cunts who like to say ""U mad bro, how much did ya pay for it, take a joke"". You can go fuck yourselves almost as much as EVOLVE can. I hope your parents had some children who lived. Then I hope they die slow of a terrible series of cancers and in their dying breath simultaneously whisper what a disappointment you are............nah, I'm just joking........can't you take a joke?"
,Derthiel,2013-04-16T11:51Z,Are you fucking serious. what the fuck is that song at the end. for years eztv had gr8 uploads and now what the fuck is that. (same as walking dead)

,RyanB1,2013-04-16T13:17Z,"The song at the end started to early, ITS THE SAME SONG THE BROTHERHOOD WAS SINGING RIDING DOWN THE TRAIL. I believe the song is supposed to start at the credits.
But yeah, defintly annoying as hell."

,pizzacav,2013-04-16T16:53Z,"I will never download EVOLVE again. How can you throw out something like that? I mean the songs last for 5 fucking minutes, ie almost 10% of the episode. It's like posting a message with 1/10 of it blurred and not noticing it."
,pizzacav,2013-04-16T16:54Z,"Btw, thanks to the uploader."
,Bossive,2013-04-16T17:27Z,"The ETTV version is actually legit for anyone who searches via top 100 like I do. This version has the audio ""skip"" ahead towards the last minute during and important scene. The audio IS legit, it was the same audio you'll find on every copy as that's how it was shown on HBO. Its a real song, the one the brotherhood sings while walking down the trail. So unfortunately its all there but the end credit song they added in (vs just playing the intro music like normal) overlapped the tense dialogs. So yes, same issue the walking dead finale had."
,darkcrimsondeath,2013-04-16T17:52Z,"it's no joke same song they were singing , is annoying though it might have been a mistake on behalf of the uploader . Thanks for the effort though eztv .Better luck with the next upload  "
,mcrowley,2013-04-16T19:05Z,"  Wow.  Over 70,000 people still using this torrent.  Must be one of them international Jewish conspiracies I keep on hearing about.

  The last bit of audio is fucked.  Nothing important, but the credit music does take you out of the magical world of Westersomething.  If it were a 1080 bluray release and not just the first low res TV-rip out of the gate I might have been a bit disappointed.

  I still wouldn't be as pissed as Jesus up there, but he's a VERY old man, obviously can't divine worth shit and will not forgive you for his lack of foresight.  Go lick a leper.

V- Decent
A- Decent until the last scene."

,danabv57,2013-04-16T21:54Z,"For crying out loud! The song, crap as it is, BELONGS to the original episode, believe it or not! It's true, the sound is missing about 30 seconds at the end, but the song IS from the original episode and it is played when the cast is rolling.
All this years EZTV gave us absolutely great torrents, and very fast, how can you forget that?! Shame on you for all the ugly, indecent and absolutely unfair comments!"
