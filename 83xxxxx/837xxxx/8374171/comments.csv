,mandy12,2013-04-15T05:03Z,"plz upload in 140 to 160 mb in size 
thank you"
,Raynor79,2013-04-15T05:25Z,Don't download. Last minute of video has some stupid fucking song playing over everything. I guess this is Heromaster's idea of a joke.
,bender010110,2013-04-15T05:51Z,@raynor - I think its a sync/encode problem with all of them right now - the end credits song cuts in 30sec early. You could just download the subs if you really want to hear whats said but I dont think its much.
,veng3ance4,2013-04-15T05:57Z,What Raynor said some stupid fucken 80's song ruins a major part of the storyline at the end of the episode. I think its the End of the World as we Know it or some gay shit. FUCK YOU UPLOADER
,veng3ance4,2013-04-15T05:59Z,Also you are gay and love jizzum all over your mouth. 
,ebNight,2013-04-15T06:13Z,"LAST 3 MIN IS FUCKED UP AND THAT 3 MIN IS VERY IMPORTANT! fuck and i shared to 3.0, my shit ain't free ffs"
,Cronien,2013-04-15T06:18Z,Great audio at the end. I don't think that qualifies as a good file just fyi. 0/10
,andrewIII,2013-04-15T06:53Z,"What in the fucking fuck? Are ALL of these torrents fucked at the end starting around 52:30?

Seriously, this is fucking garbage. Torrent was at least 9/10 all around before that shit. That fucking ruined it."
,DragonChaserKev,2013-04-15T06:56Z,Comments on all torrents for episode three seem to say there is a minute or so of punk music at the end of the episode... hmmm now isn't that sort of curious.  :)
,soonerguy72,2013-04-15T07:12Z,Absolute garbage. Last minute is dubber over with some shitty punk song. Thanks alot douchbag.
,noybinhd,2013-04-15T07:12Z,"Oh you bitches lol. The cliff hanger ending is replaced with fucking punk rock music. 
"
,maymay04,2013-04-15T07:14Z,"all the downloads seem to have the same problem, not just this one"
,j1776,2013-04-15T07:20Z,"AUDIO OUT-OF-SYNC IN FINAL SCENE! The end credits music begins too soon and plays instead of the last ~minute of dialogue.

Here is a better version with the CORRECT AUDIO for the final scene:

,pirate_share_the_love,2013-04-15T07:24Z,"The last two minutes gets out of sync alright. The ending credits start a bit early, but you wont loose any of the story regardless. It's very clear what's happening at the time and sound isn't really crucial."
,payaso13,2013-04-15T07:46Z,what a way to fuck up an good upload  (heromaster) Why did u have to add music at the last min. really disappointed in u 
[T],nosnavis,2013-04-15T08:38Z,"a link to the scene? at least the audio. I don't wan't to download 400MB again, I can fix the file myself, if I have the correct audio"
,crumrugin,2013-04-15T09:04Z,Blame evolve not H.M. all evolve copies need re encode
,yobar23,2013-04-15T18:52Z,Never did understand why people upload sh*t without first making sure it's good.  Been uploading since '96 and always ensured that it was good before doing so.  Are y'all in that much of a hurry?  Can't do a rep good with craptastic uploads.
,kradeht,2013-04-20T01:55Z,DON'T DOWNLOAD! no audio at the episode's finale!
