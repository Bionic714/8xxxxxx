,ryan5892,2013-04-15T07:46Z,"Good copy, good quality, fast download.

But the last 30 seconds, which include a very big plot event, the audio cuts into irish pub music that isn't supposed to be there. You don't miss anything except for a meaningless exchange of words.

But it had me like WTF!

the last few seconds are uploaded on youtube though.

Love this show, thanks for the fast upload!"
