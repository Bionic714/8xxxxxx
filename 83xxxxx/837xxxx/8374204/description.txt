Magical realism and comic confusion blend in a startling film about visions and expectations. Amid the debris of a Colombian cyclone lands A Very Old Man With Enormous Wings whose seemingly miraculous anatomy attracts the curious and devout from around the world. Silent and disheveled, this fantastical “creature” is housed in a chicken coop as his hosts and the onlookers wait for his heavenly message which turns out to be a very mixed blessing. Based on a story by Gabriel García Márquez.
