On the Sunday, April 14 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex breaks down the plan to disarm America by passing incremental feel-good laws that will further erode the foundation of the Second Amendment. 

On today's show, Alex talks with Douglas J. Hagmann of the Hagmann Report and the Northeast Intelligence Network. Mr. Hagmann reveals inside information about the case of David Lewis who had his legal firearms wrongly confiscated under New York's recently passed NY SAFE Act. 

Alex also gets into the latest on the failed state of North Korea and the threat of a new Asian war. 

He also covers a threat issued by the Austin Police stating they will arrest citizens for drinking and walking.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
