You do not need any of previous updates installed for this
release. Check out the included changelog.txt for a list of
what's new

The Enhanced Edition contains Sword of the Stars II: The Lords of
Winter and the first expansion, the End of Flesh. The new expansion
introduces the new playable race, the Loa. All previous DLCs
containing new avatars, new combat music, alternate voices, skins,
and new badges for the warships are also included.

Customize your own starships, amass your fleet, explore the outer
reaches of the galaxy and expand your empire. Research new alien
technologies and bring them into battle with a mix of turn-based
strategy and real-time skirmishes.

Now a new Faction bursts onto the scene, a race of Artificial
Intelligence who once served as slaves and now return seeking
vengeance. Playing as the Loa, your Fleets will become masters of
metamorphosis, shape-shifting into new forms to become the ships you
need, where you need them. Durable and hardy, your colonies can be
built on any rocky planet. Building an empire of silicon and steel,
you will bring your former masters to their knees... or will you
bring about the End of Flesh
