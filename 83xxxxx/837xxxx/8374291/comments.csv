,Kona_Guy,2013-04-16T07:19Z,The KING SLAYER gets his hand cut off at the end. There you go i spoiled it fore you.
,Couter,2013-04-16T07:34Z,"Just watched the full episode. The last scene has the complete audio.

For whatever reason the ending credit music is still replaced with ""end of the world as we know it"" by REM, but on this version the song doesn't start until the credits roll.

,BoonesFerry,2013-04-16T23:38Z,"As a couple others' have said...

Missing dialogue was only an issue in the first SD (standard definition) release only...which was nuked and a successor 'proper' SD released. The 720p was not nuked because it is not flawed. The song is 
supposed to start playing as the credits start rolling...which is exactly what occurs in this release.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones_(season_3)#Music

The U.S. indie rock band The Hold Steady recorded ""The Bear and the Maiden Fair"", a ribald folk song from Martin's novels. The recording is played over the end credits of episode three, and the song is sung by Brienne's and Jaime's captors in the same episode. Set to music by series composer Ramin Djawadi, the recording is to be released on a seven-inch record on April 20, 2013.

Anytime you are about to make a claim that a torrent release is flawed, STOP!, do the research, make sure that what you are about to say is true and accurate. Do not just repost crap you read somwehere, make sure you are referring to the correct torrent release. Otherwise you are only spreading false accusations and damaging your own reputation and credibility."
