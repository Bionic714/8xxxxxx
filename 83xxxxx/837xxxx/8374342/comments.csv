,njekt,2013-04-15T05:57Z,does this suffer from the same problem as the evolve release does in its last 1minute w/ respect to audio?
[V],Drarbg,2013-04-15T06:00Z,its called PROPER... means no glitches.
,stefanjones,2013-04-15T06:15Z,I will post a comment to see what's up after its done downloading
,Sea-Goat,2013-04-15T06:45Z,Going to download again due to the horrible pirate rock crap at the end of the episode. 
,kiwij,2013-04-15T06:58Z,"Look at the full proper description here: http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8374343/Game_of_Thrones_S03E03_PROPER_HDTV_x264-2HD[ettv] - The description states missing audio, even though it is a ""proper"" fixed version."
,j1776,2013-04-15T07:07Z,"DOWNLOAD THIS ONE

The audio track in the final scene is correct in this version. I just downloaded it and played it myself."

,stfu_or_die,2013-04-15T07:25Z,"Confirmed, the audio is proper at the end of this one. Kind of balls having to download it again for the last 30 seconds....anyway fuck you eztv and thank you rartv. "
,pbxpb,2013-04-15T07:28Z,"the song is  during the credits is ""the bear and the maiden fair"" its in the book and u guys heard a punk rock version of it lol the soldiers would be sitting on their horse backs and singing the song if u rewind and listen to the lyrics lol 
""A bear there was,""
""A bear, A BEAR!
""All black and brown,""
""And covered with hair!
""Oh come they said,""
""Oh come to the fair!""
""The fair? said he,
""But I'm a bear!""
""All black and brown,""
""And covered in hair!""
""And down the road,""
""From here to there,""
""From here!To there!""
""Three boys, a goat,""
""And a dancing bear!""
""They danced and spun,""
""All the way to the fair!""
""Oh! sweet she was,""
""And pure and fair,""
""The maid with honey,""
""In her hair! Her hair,""
""The maid with honey,""
""in her hair!""
The bear smelled the scent,
""On the summer air!""
""The Bear! The Bear!""
""All black and brown,""
""And covered with hair!""
""He smelled the scent,""
""On the summer air,""
""He sniffed and roared,""
""And smelled it there!""
""Honey on the summer air!""
""Oh I'm a maid,""
""And I'm pure and fair,""
""I'll never dance,""
""With a hairy bear,""
""A bear! A bear!""
""I'll never dance,""
""With a hairy bear!""
""The bear,the bear!""
""Lifted her high,""
into the air!""
The bear, the bear!""
""I called for a knight!""
""But you're a bear!""
""A bear! A bear,""
""All black and brown,""
""And cover in hair!""
""She kicked and wailed,""
""The maid so fair,""
""But he licked the honey,""
""From her hair!""
""Her hair! Her hair!""
""He licked the honey,""
""From her hair!""
""Then she sighed and squealed,""
""And kicked the air,""
""She sang: My bear so fair,""
""And off they went,""
""The bear! The bear!""
""And the maiden fair!"""
,j1776,2013-04-15T07:51Z,"Could someone please make a torrent containing just the final scene (with proper audio) of this episode? Maybe starting around 52:00 and ending before the end credits music begins?

You would be such a hero to the tens of thousands of people who downloaded one of the bad torrents and don't want to re-download the entire episode for just one scene.

(I'd do it myself but I'm clueless.)"
,Bring_Back_Demonoid,2013-04-15T08:05Z,We need a PROPER for the HD version.  I don't know how any of you can ruin the show by watching it in crap/fuzzed out quality.  
,hulkcum,2013-04-15T08:08Z,the PROPER version is good with no audio issues.
,kiwij,2013-04-15T08:23Z,"Just watched the entire episode, no missing audio."
[T],nosnavis,2013-04-15T08:35Z,how about uploading only the fucked up scene?
,mousetrapper,2013-04-15T08:38Z,"If you downloaded the earlier version with bad audio sync, I've uploaded the final scene and credits only here: https://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8374630

The PROPER version is fine, just downloaded and confirmed that the audio sync is good at the end. 

The closing credits music is by Irish Moutarde, BTW. You can get i there: http://www.irishmoutarde.com/fr/music/bearCDS.php"

[T],nosnavis,2013-04-15T14:14Z,Can you upload just the last scene? I don't want to download 400MB again. I can join it. Thanks
,cjolwd,2013-04-16T02:18Z,"EZTV does not rip TV, it just posts the links to them.  There's no need to bitch at them for someone else's idea of a joke."
,Ttones,2013-04-16T02:46Z,Thanks for the 'proper' torrent.
,blackinkgeorge,2013-04-16T04:07Z,GOOD Copy with GOOD Audio all the way to the very end!
,eddiescorpi,2013-04-17T02:01Z,A9/V9 very good! Thanks.
,Normalcy,2013-04-22T11:14Z,"This episode has the exact same audio issues as the EVOLVE version. The audio is not correct and I have no idea why so many earlier comments said otherwise. I an not mistaken, this exact torrent by Drarbg has the same audio issue.

Also this is not HD, it's 720x404."
,vampzcore,2013-04-27T08:43Z,thanks!!
