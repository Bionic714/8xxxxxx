,njekt,2013-04-15T05:58Z,does this suffer from the same problem as the evolve release does in its last 1minute w/ respect to audio?
,Aleysia,2013-04-15T05:58Z,"Downloadin now. Thanks ettv, ya'll have have been good to me. ;)"
,CtrlXAltXDe1337,2013-04-15T06:06Z,The audio problem played on HBO too… so it's going to be on all of these unfortunately
,Srandah,2013-04-15T06:13Z,"Same as above:

Is this the fixed version of the earlier, faulty torrent?
--> Does this version switch to music with 30 seconds left?"
,Srandah,2013-04-15T06:17Z,"   --> CtrlXAltXDe1337

Really?! My nerdsenses are tingling, the missing audio made me angrier than ever before!

Praise tpb, no hate"
,YourWorstNightmare,2013-04-15T06:18Z,"No, njekt, this is the proper after all."
,Sl4ppyw4g,2013-04-15T06:22Z,"@njekt the description on this one says ""missing dialog"", so i would assume so"
,Hoirc88,2013-04-15T06:22Z,I assume this version will be ok with the ending audio since its PROPER and not the EVOLVE version. We'll see.
,njekt,2013-04-15T06:43Z,"I ended up downloading this to check myself, since all responses to my original comments were only speculation (thanks for those guesses guys!).

The audio is okay up until the original credits in this release.

yet, oddly enough, then breaks into the same song that plagued the evolve release... (?)"
,Srandah,2013-04-15T06:48Z,This version is updated and contain the missing dialogue!
,Axter,2013-04-15T06:54Z,WE HAVE A PROPER ONE!

,fuckyourbullshit,2013-04-15T07:34Z,"Could someone who has a good copy please upload the last minute as a seperate file so the 100,000s of people who downed the first up don't need to download the whole thing again."
,Aleysia,2013-04-15T07:40Z,"A/10 V/10. The cheesy punk-rock music is what was supposed to happen. I have read many comments on many different torrents and this one is as the episode is supposed to be. Nothing is missing. Again, thank you ettv."
,fuckyourbullshit,2013-04-15T07:53Z,can someone who has a proper copy please upload the last minute as a seperate file so all those with the bad copy dont have to download the entire thing again.
,hulkcum,2013-04-15T08:10Z,YEAH EVOLVE FUCKED UP DON'T BLAME ETTV
,kiwij,2013-04-15T08:23Z,"Just watched the entire episode, no missing audio."
,WoundedWolfgirl,2013-04-15T08:53Z,"Just watched it, this is the legit version, no problems at the end."

,rachelbtw,2013-04-15T11:01Z,"CAN CONFIRM THIS IS THE FIXED VERSION. Thanks, ettv!"
,Agaryulnaer,2013-04-15T23:23Z,"Thanks, ettv! :D"
,Caly104,2013-04-16T07:06Z,"The ""shitty Irish song"" is a rock version of ""The Bear and the Maiden Fair"" from the book. Jamie and Brienne's captors are singing it in the episode. 

Thanks for the fixed version!"
,ba4624,2013-04-16T07:18Z,"This one does not have the audio problem at the end.

For those that didn't read the books (not a spoiler), the song at the end of the episode is a cover of one of the song/poems from the books."
,thewizardchrist,2013-04-16T10:44Z,Evolve and EZTV can such each others rotten peckers till they get mouth cancer. ettv thank you so much. 
,H0P4,2013-04-17T21:55Z,"Sorry but terrible video quality, this looks like a crap rip, maybe you did it from a hd tv originaly... Off to find a better proper version."
