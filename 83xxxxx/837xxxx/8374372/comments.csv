,thyblight,2013-04-15T06:59Z,Agreed. What a disappointment at the end.
[V],LegendET,2013-04-15T07:01Z,audio is fine on this tnx
,stfu_or_die,2013-04-15T07:07Z,"^^Same. Yea, its a free download, blah blah blah. How hard is it to fuck up the end of an episode like this. Same goddamn thing with WD season finale. Piss off eztv"
,peter.faux,2013-04-15T07:20Z,missing dialog at 52m26s
,rummcakes,2013-04-15T07:47Z,"don't pay attention to the idiots saying the audio at the end is screwed up.  they obviously didn't download this particular torrent and watch it.  audio is out of sync for all of the x264 versions

also, don't blame ettv for the screw up, clearly all of the uploaders get their files from the exact same source seeing how EVERY SINGLE ONE is screwed up.  except this one...this one works perfectly, as Legend ET said.  and he is a green skull, so ya better believe it"
,shipdoc,2013-04-15T07:55Z,Last 90 seconds or so has some bullshit song playing. How the hell did you get a green skull??? ettv is NOT EZTV. Lessons learned.
,STONEDSTONER,2013-04-15T08:29Z,"Its what HBO put out #dealwithit

FAG NOOBS"
,Valahas,2013-04-15T11:17Z,"Hallo from greece salonika tnx for up. Aπο τις μαλακιες που γραφει ο καθενας στο τελος δεν μπορουμε να βγαλουμε ακρη τι πραγματικα συμβαινει. Any way stop bla,,bla,,bla,, bla, and action."
,IdiotFirstClass,2013-04-15T12:19Z,"There's nothing wrong with the audio, that song was supposed to be played at the end, if you don't believe it read IGN's review of the episode, they mention the song at the end credits as well. Thanks for the upload!"
,Butcher851,2013-04-15T12:54Z,"IGN mentioned the song at the End Credits so it means that's how the episode aired. No-one screwed up if that's the only issue, it was aired that way. "
,cutsickass1,2013-04-15T13:29Z,"First of all, thanks for the XviD. Second, the song at the end credits was indeed how HBO aired the episode, but doesn't really affect it. Great job."
,sanitybleeds,2013-04-15T20:14Z,"For those of you that are apparently hearing impaired, the song at the end credits is the same song the soldiers who captured Breann and Jamie were singing on the road. Meaning the song was probably supposed to be there all along and you weren't really paying attention!"
,TedLilly,2013-04-16T09:46Z,@ stfu: If you think you can do better why don't I see any torrents from you? You should do what you name says: stfu or die you ungrateful fuck....
,nevyn68,2013-04-24T02:40Z,Thank you ettv.
,Tinna_30,2013-04-27T17:03Z,thanks
