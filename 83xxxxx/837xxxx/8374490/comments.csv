,Satan6667,2013-04-15T19:42Z,Is it better then Defiance S01E01 Pilot HD-NoGrp?
,Satan6667,2013-04-15T19:54Z,"Just downloaded. This copy is watchable on computer monitor, dont know how is it on big TV screen though.  Definitely better then NoGRP"
,CapPanda,2013-04-15T21:02Z,"While technically lower quality it is better than NoGrp or FinireDH.  The Web PreAir is not in full 1080p, the original source is at best 720p and probably a bit lower than that.  NoGrp and FinireDH are simply taking the resolution of this video and upsizing it.  This will look better than a hard encoded upsizing because the scaling of most TVs is far more advanced than software scaling on low end machines."
,siiiix,2013-04-15T22:26Z,"actually have bad codecs problems with this file every minute or so, most players recover but its interrupting, and something is weird with the audio, i cant pinpoint it but its hard to understand when they talking"
,Kelisen,2013-04-16T07:25Z,Audio is funky as fuck.
