The ORIGINAL/FIRST RELEASE of Pirates of the Dark Water that aired on Fox Kids back in 1990/1991 under the name "DARK WATER" with Roddy McDowall as the original voice of Niddler. There were 5 episodes released under "Dark Water" as a mini series before it was enhanced and made into a movie and then WB released a 21 episode cartoon series.

THIS IS NOT A RIP FROM THE WB DVD RELEASE OF THE SERIES!!!!!
 Compare the two first episodes. There are several significant differences, one being the quality of the animation!!!
