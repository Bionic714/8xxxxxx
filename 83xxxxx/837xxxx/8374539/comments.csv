,sol_kn,2013-04-15T20:22Z,is the audio ok at the end? I can't blindly trust eztv torrents these days :(
,fredkite,2013-04-15T20:28Z,@sol_kn It's slightly out of sync.
,scottymadlove,2013-04-18T19:46Z,I think it's EVOLVE not eztv. Anyone know the deal? eztv has been a godsend....But there have been a lot of bad files lately.
