,th3anti,2013-04-15T16:11Z,Is there a copy that isn't .mkv?  Or conversely is there a program that will convert it to something xbox will play QUICKLY?  I apologize for the excruciating noobieness. 
[T],trialNerror,2013-04-15T22:42Z,"MKV to PS3/X360 ready MP4 in minutes:

Tools required: AviDemux

1) Drop the MKV into AviDemux
2) Copy the video track
3) Change the audio to Stereo AAC
4) Save as MP4

Since it's only re-encoding the audio the ""conversion"" process only takes a couple minutes."
