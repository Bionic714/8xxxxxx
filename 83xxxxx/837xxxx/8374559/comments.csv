,fuckyourbullshit,2013-04-15T07:54Z,can someone who has a proper copy please upload the last minute as a seperate file so all those with the bad copy dont have to download the entire thing again.
,jeso6778,2013-04-15T08:25Z,400 MB is not HDTV
,Bean-Bandit,2013-04-15T08:44Z,Where's the HD Proper version!?!?!?
,BoonesFerry,2013-04-15T08:52Z,"
That's a good idea. Perhaps an individual will do that. 

Generally speaking....

If you want to greatly reduce the probability of downloading a flawed release, then wait, wait a few hours, let someeone else download and comment on quality.

If you are one of those people who must download a torrent the second an episode is posted, then you accept the risk that the release (though rare) may be flawed."
,xanat0s,2013-04-15T09:26Z,"@jeso6778 The source was HD, are you a wee bit retarded? Or maybe you jus crawled outta a cave?

@BoonesFerry
I'm sure we're all getting annoyed at you spamming this same post in every different upload. So kindly stfu. Please and thank you."

,HaoleGuy,2013-04-15T11:25Z,"Screwed up audio again!! It's only over the end credits, but I gotta think that eztv has taken to trolling. How can a random piece of audio ""accidentally"" slip into a video file?"
,GavinFace,2013-04-15T11:47Z,6 comments and not one of you useless fucktards comented on if this version is ok. Can someone who isn't a fucking downey please confirm if this version is ok and not faulty?
,Zergborgcolective,2013-04-15T12:00Z,"version is ok,ignore the others 

if u want to comment either follow the show on hbo or try to upload urselfes 

tx again eztv for a good upload"
,arildus,2013-04-15T12:08Z,Thanx:)
,HoldenVR,2013-04-15T12:13Z,"FIXED TORRENT BELOW:

The audio is fine on this one http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8374342/Game.of.Thrones.S03E03.PROPER.HDTV.x264-2HD%5Brartv%5D

PLEASE SEED. Alot of people are trying to get this, don't be selfish and seed your copy!"
,xanat0s,2013-04-15T12:30Z,@HaoleGuy You ppl are seriously pissing me off tonight. THIS IS THE END CREDIT MUSIC. If you had actually bothered to read ANY fucking comments on the other uploads you would know that.
,xanat0s,2013-04-15T12:31Z,"And for the record, this IS proper....finally."
,kasutooo,2013-04-15T12:52Z,"Thanks!

This is great. There is NO audio glitch at the end."
,cocoonair,2013-04-15T13:22Z,"This one is fine and not nuked like the previous uploads! If you check on eztv.it you will see that this ""strange"" music should be on the end credits however not before. :-)
So go and grab this torrent as it really is PROPER and PERFECT without any audio troubles in the end.
V10/A10"
,gameofgroans,2013-04-15T14:51Z,"Thank goodness the messed up audio at the end does not obscure the fact that Shae betrays Tyrion and she was sleeping with Tywin all along. All pissed, Tyrion shoots his father in the groin with a crossbow and chokes Shae to death. Tywin Lannister did not, in the end, shit gold."
,jeso6778,2013-04-15T15:31Z,"lol @xanatos getting mad on an internet torrent site

grow up"
,torourke22,2013-04-15T16:05Z,"Thanks, your uploads are the best!"
,warmonger3,2013-04-15T16:07Z,Thanks for the comments about this being a proper copy.  Also thanks eztv.
,CRISPIGGY,2013-04-15T16:39Z,"SECOND TIME EZTV....
I HOPE THIS IS OK...
I COME BACK LATER FOR COMENTS"
,Alvroasis,2013-04-15T18:14Z,muchas gracias!
,GrouchoMX,2013-04-15T21:54Z,"This one is without the music cutting it off in the end! That's probably why it says ""proper""."
,ProphetZarquon,2013-04-16T05:04Z,"Good lord people get angry about free stuff that isn't up to their spoon-fed standards.

eztv is like a massive charity hospital and one or two patients die and it's some kind of scandal.

eztv *is* my TV, so I understand the pain of getting a bad file, but... it was free. and done by someone trying to be nice. not for money...

Many people pay for subscription TV and it still isn't perfect.  The number of digital flaws I've seen on paid cable still outnumbers those I've seen on free PC videos, and I watch 99% by PC."
,HKCannibal,2013-04-16T05:49Z,Thanks a lot eztv!
,snake368,2013-04-16T07:36Z,"Thanks eztv! This version has no audio problems, is there any chance you upload flawless 720p version?"
,MihawkxxZoro,2013-04-16T07:56Z,"I cant believe it that people sold eztv so fast just cuz of one mistake. Did you forget their work before? -_- 

Cant blame you all, luckily I had exam so I am downloading it after all the shit that happened. I am safe. Thanks eztv and thank you commenters, I was going to download the older one if it wasnt for you all. "
,painkiller21,2013-04-16T09:23Z,The torrent is just fine.thnx ez:)
,GavinFace,2013-04-16T15:28Z,"@HaoleGuy You incredible retard, this version is ok. The music goes over the end credits AS IT IS SUPPOSED TO DO. Get off this site and never come back please."
,pirate_LD,2013-04-16T17:39Z,Thanks eztv ! 
,trixi50,2013-04-16T18:35Z,"Generally one reads comments to see if the torrent is good quality.  Why, just because it's free, should we watch crud quality?? Hey? If anyone expresses an honest opinion, they are shot down in a hail profanity. What in god's name is wrong with you boys!! Do you think eztv is a person and they will think you are kind for defending them?  Do you hope eztv will think you are mad cool??  Lolz for days. :DDD"
,trixi50,2013-04-16T18:38Z,"Oh and aside from being assaulted with all the filthy language, there are also all the spoilers to avoid reading....
A simple mark out of ten would do.
Thank you and good day!!"
,brian_177,2013-04-16T23:10Z,"Love all the couch torrent experts who still seem to think that the song ""the Bear and Maiden Fair"" is a joke by eztv... some nefarious plot to ruin our Game of Thrones experience.
It is a song, written by George RR Martin, and moments before the credits it is being sung by one of the men who have Brienne captured.

Not everyone who watches the show has to watch the book--but maybe if you haven't read the book you shouldn't comment on weather a song belongs in the show or not, retards."
,lakiejo,2013-04-17T03:47Z,This IS actually a good version!!! Do it!!
,clawdigga,2013-04-17T06:06Z,fuck all you hoes..  i just wanted to say that :)
,mcrowley,2013-04-17T06:55Z,"So I think, a big hand please, for the Great ProphetZarquon!  Wherever he's gotten to..."
,BorgiBloodstorm,2013-04-18T08:54Z,"SONG AT END=
The song is the ""Bear and the Maiden Fair."" The lyrics are in the book, A Song of Ice and Fire by GRRM. It is performed in a punk rock fashion that makes it seem out of place, but it is 100% Westerosi in origin. It was not added by some moron for a good laugh.

It should not, however, be playing at the most important part of the drama as Jaime is sitting down to have an important conversation at the diner table. That was an error, which this torrent is supposed to fix."
,traloth,2013-04-18T17:31Z,"First time the music played thought some pop up somewhere had sprung into life. Second time I was dismayed then realised lyrics were the same as the song near the start and that something must have gone wrong. When I realised the source, the source I trust most on TPB, this confirmed it was mere glitch. I hope this torrent fixes the glitch. And also, to all those willing to burn eztv, and never downlowad again, go ahead. Less of you fucking leechers to trouble our thoughts. :)"
,alorama99,2013-04-19T02:00Z,"Guys, be careful. User 'gameofgroaners', who obviously suffers severe respect and mental issues, offers a MEGA spoiler.  Seriously, what he describes is probably going to close out the season finale.  Way to go, ultra-douche..."
,ironymon,2013-04-21T23:04Z,"how did that troll shit with bad audio got past scene impervious rules inspection... fucking retards, u don't make mistakes, if u make mistakes the worlds doomed."
,deltoroxx,2013-04-21T23:35Z,"Found the latest episode (s03e04) floating about on the net. Isnt it funny how HBO never admits to pirates who have infiltrated their company? haha, always the hush hush. Oh well, the episode was really entertaining but not as shocking as the last one.

Would be great if someone could .torrent this later on but for now just enjoy it as it is: http://www.gameofthrones24.weebly.com"
,FakeHater67,2013-04-22T04:43Z,"refer to MihawkxxZoro .check your comments first.it wasn't the first mistake with eztv.check The walking dead s3e16 b4 it was repacked.it was uploaded by eztv and fuckd up right at the end too.But I do believe eztv is a great uploader,and deserves respect&admiration.i have a exc collection thanks to the likes of EZTV&similar uploaders..THANKS"
