coz the title says 720p and the info states as 1080p."
,anoXmous,2013-04-15T10:25Z,"@ onlyHD.......Thx for the help :)

This is the correct info: 1920 x 800 (2.400) at 23.976 fps = 1080p :)"
,onlyHD,2013-04-15T11:50Z,"Yeah i am watching this right now in full hd :)

You can contact moderators and edit the title.
And also you can upload Hotel Chevalier 2007, a short prologue of The Darjeeling Limited, if you wish."
