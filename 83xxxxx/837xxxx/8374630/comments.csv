,Torcache,2013-04-15T08:56Z,It seems every version had the problem actually not just rartv
,macwtf,2013-04-15T08:58Z,"Thnx mousetrapper.
Much appreciated!

BTW, who was the band that busted in early? Sounded a bit like the Pogues."
,mousetrapper,2013-04-15T09:02Z,"Argh! Saved this on a Mac and the extension changed to .MOV. It's really an MP4 so if you're having trouble opening it with your media player of choice, just change the extension to .MP4 and you should be good."
,mousetrapper,2013-04-15T09:02Z,The band is Irish Moutarde. Song is here: http://www.irishmoutarde.com/fr/music/bearCDS.php
,j1776,2013-04-15T09:04Z,"Thanks! I already re-downloaded the whole episode for myself, but I'll download and seed this for others."
,fuckyourbullshit,2013-04-15T09:07Z,awesome
,xanat0s,2013-04-15T09:21Z,"Don't even bother, this worthless attempt still has fucked up audio. Not as bad as before but still out of synch as hell. "
,smatchimo,2013-04-15T09:24Z,seeding because this guy is a bro.  thanks mousetrapper
,mousetrapper,2013-04-15T10:00Z,"My bad. The version of the song over the credits is actually by The Hold Steady. Coming out next week (20-04) on 7"" vinyl."
,somedude72,2013-04-15T18:54Z,"You rock for uploading this. And for xanatos, the audio is perfectly fine, not out of synch at all with the VLC player. You should try that instead of whatever worthless player you're using that causes you to come here and make worthless comments on a worthy upload."
,Fanchig,2013-04-16T01:10Z,"Confirm audio is just fine. Thanks for the effort, even little."
,batchi,2013-04-16T03:54Z,"Thanks a lot!
This is the real thing, no crappy song before credits that some a-holes thought would be funny.
Just confirmed myself."
,piratewit,2013-04-16T21:46Z,thanks for this
,omnipote,2013-04-30T13:46Z,"Thank you very very much for this, you're awesome."
