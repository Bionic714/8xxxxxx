ΓÇ£Let go, let love.ΓÇ¥ WeΓÇÖve all heard it before, the cliche expression about not dwelling on the troubles of the past. Thankfully, The Let Go, a Seattle-based Hip Hop trio comprised of rappers Kublakai and Type and producer Captain Midnite, donΓÇÖt take such a played out approach in their recently released album ΓÇ£Tomorrow Handles ThatΓÇ¥ (though they do, on occasion dabble in rapping about rain and/or the lack of sunlight, among other tired Seattle-centric themes). Kublakai and Type somehow find a way to incorporate humor (the kind you actually laugh at, not the ΓÇ£oh, thatΓÇÖs clever ΓÇ¥ so prevalent in the genre) with the introspective observations that seem to be a staple of the subgenre.

The live-and-let go attitude is presented immediately by the intro track ΓÇ£Turning On YouΓÇ¥ in which the sample sings a heartfelt, ΓÇ£ItΓÇÖs turning on you and itΓÇÖs brining you down.ΓÇ¥  Continuing with this train of thought is ΓÇ£Standing Back,ΓÇ¥ one of the highlights of the album in which the vocalists speak on the pains of ending a relationship. The catchy chorus of, ΓÇ£Baby donΓÇÖt leave meΓÇª but if you have to leave and thatΓÇÖs what you need to breathe then I ainΓÇÖt gonna stand in your way,ΓÇ¥ exemplifies the optimistic view of life these guys subscribe to. The albumΓÇÖs message culminates in the tell-it-like-it-is track ΓÇ£Easy RoadΓÇ¥ and the inspirational ΓÇ£DesolationΓÇ£, which summarize the philosophy of embracing lifeΓÇÖs challenges but not allowing oneself to be bogged down by them.

Interspersed between tracks similar to the aforementioned are songs that are pure hilarity. Some may say that this makes for an unfocused and incoherent effort, but I beg to differ. Thanks to this, ΓÇ£Tomorrow Handles ThatΓÇ¥ is one of the most fully developed albums to come along in a good while, complete with an advertisement (Sponsor Words) ! Whether itΓÇÖs poking fun at the America Fuck Yeah mindset (No Difference), discussing how to wreck a party one hasnΓÇÖt been invited to (Party Crashers), speaking on the art, and the difficulty, of picking up women drunk (Booty Fiend), or the dilemma of trying to hook up with oneΓÇÖs friend (No I DonΓÇÖt). All the while, the listener is serenaded by the real star of the show, the sonic environment crafted by the polished and topic-appropriate production by Midnite.
