Restoration is an easy to use and straight forward tool to undelete files that were removed from the recycle bin or directly deleted from within Windows. Upon start, you can scan for all files that may be recovered and also limit the results by entering a search term or extension.
Restoration also provides the option to wipe the found files beyond simple recovery. The program is small and standalone, it does not require installation. Restoration works with FAT and NTFS as well as digital cameras cards.
