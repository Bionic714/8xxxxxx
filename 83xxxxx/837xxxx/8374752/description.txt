Here is a collection of some of the best death metal songs of the past 25 years.
Quality varies from 192kbps to 320kbps on all songs to the best of my knowledge.
All songs have artwork tagged to them.
I meticuously went through my entire library and came up with these tunes
that should make an impressive Vol.1
Collections are becoming more and more popular simply because
it eliminates alot of the filler and B-Sides in music that people just scan through.
Of course there are many albums that just must be heard from beginning to end.
Remember to share and SEED!!!.I cannot stress enough to SEEEEEDDDD!!!,it 
seems to be the one thing that alot of people don't do.
Although even I have hit and run before but not anymore.


Thanks and keep Metal alive!!!
