“Block Programs From Going Online Using Windows Firewall with Advanced Settings”.
In this particular case, choose the outbound panel and block the “2 application files” individually that are located in the Reallusion folder. The 2 application names are called “CTApp” and  “RLSysRegAgentU”. 
This does work folks. No more unplugging the internet."

No big deal though, this software still works great when disconnected manually from the internet.

Thank you ""Ching_Liu""  for posting this torrent:)"
