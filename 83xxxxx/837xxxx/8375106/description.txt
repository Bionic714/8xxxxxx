Defiance S01E00 - The Making of Defiance

Interviews with the cast and crew are featured in this behind-the-scenes look at "Defiance", a science-fiction drama about the survivors of a war between humans and aliens that has left Earth forever changed.

The first episode of the series will air on April 15, 2013.

This aired on April 13, 2013 on Showcase HD in Canada. Like all of my releases to date, the source is an analog rip, so the quality is, at best, something like A8 V8.
