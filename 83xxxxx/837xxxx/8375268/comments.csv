,ChamberVet,2013-04-21T06:01Z,"Does anyone have ""The Brown Tape"" that was included in the deluxe edition of Twelve Reasons To Die?

Supposedly it was an actual tape that was included, but c'mon, theres gotta be a digital.

Hope someone uploads it soon, Apollo Brown killed it on the remake!

Thanks for the upload, btw. "
