Tiger Lillies - 2007 - Urine Palace

The Tiger Lillies and the Symphony Orchestra of Norrlandsoperan.
Swedish 30 piece orchestra meets London filth merchants.
We performed our latest collection of songs in Uma, Sweden in May 2006 with the Symphony Orchestra of Norrlandsoperan who had invited us to perform with them for a live concert series and had full arrangements written for this one-off event. The results were quite startling, one minute dramatic and moving, the next an x-rated warner brothers cartoon score. We felt that it was important to record the show, even just so we could confirm to ourselves that it actually happened. (tigerlillies.com)
