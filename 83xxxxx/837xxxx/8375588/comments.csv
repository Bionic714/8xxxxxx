How bout at this point I see NO seeders at all !"
,Garyhall,2013-04-15T22:18Z,"This torrent is dead. NO seeders.
If you're not going to seed a torrent, DON'T UPLOAD IT even if your excuse is that you have no bandwidth left. I guess it does't matter anyways. The show is good, but the video quality sucks anyway!"
[V],psspss,2013-04-16T00:26Z,"the torrent has been seeding all night while I slept i fact I have a virus and sick in bed

force seeding just means it goes faster if people dont restrict their upload speed and share

I have released it for now but already seeing some percentages going up meaning they not seeding back as getting"
[V],psspss,2013-04-16T00:30Z,"idp trackers havent been updating but http ones work pretty mcuh all the time.. I suspect you have no http trackers.. maybe tpb removed them
Kat doesnt do that.. so those who got it from kat instead gets all the trackers to see me"
[V],psspss,2013-04-16T00:34Z,seems some udp trackers are being blocked in various countries
[V],psspss,2013-04-16T01:08Z,"so ive shared over 100 percent now and still

everyone is 76 percent or less.. so whos the dude ruinning it for all and not sharing then"
[V],psspss,2013-04-16T01:43Z,ok Im off 7 have it all now and I shared way too much of 1.5 ratio now i have 3gb to last me 4 days :/
[V],psspss,2013-04-16T02:02Z,"the TPB stats for seeders always seems to be wrong

it dont count the seeders on http trackers so its not 0 or 1 often theres more pays to always load a dead torrent directly and check

and always add http fr33dom tracker if its not there! tpb messes with the torrent when uploading sadly !!"

I thought the wall climbing dog had already been aired on a older episode and season? or was that another dog or they now reusing stuff to make longer episodes?"
[V],psspss,2013-04-16T04:44Z,actually diesel dog been on before too.. googling seems it was on season 2 episode 3 what the hell is going on with bondi vet programming

I really hate recaps waste of time and data .. most of the items came from Season 2 by looks and some S03 I think"
[V],psspss,2013-04-20T15:47Z,"looks like S05E07 is a darn recap as well so I wont botther.. seems they from Season 1 this time.. episode 9 has dalmation swallowed a corn cob.. can tell they repeats lisa hasnt wedding ring on :)
