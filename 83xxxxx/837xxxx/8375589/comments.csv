,muLineZu,2013-04-15T23:37Z,"Thanks for sharing. Perfect quality/size ratio! Glad that there are still encoders that use the DVD size (4,37, or 7,95GB) for their encodings; the majority of releases are 5,x-6,x GB, and it's just a job more for re-encoding them to the size I prefer. Don't wanna seem to be complaining, I'm glad there are a lot of good encodings, I just prefer keeping them on DVD (5 or 9), and I'm happy that guys like like DAA make it even easier for me.
P.S. ...and a good thriller to watch, this one. Thanks!"
