DEVONthink Pro Office 2.5.2

This maintenance update not only fixes a number of reported bugs but also improves the synchronization, the Clip to DEVONthink browser extension, the bookmarklets, and many other aspects of the app. The web interface allows you to change comments and is much faster.

Whats New:

* Clip to DEVONthink indicates that a web address to be added is
   already present in the currently open databases and allows to reveal 
   the first found document directly from the destination popup menu.

* Both bookmarklets and Clip to DEVONthink can also create rich text
  documents and can capture the selection as rich text if possible.

* Favorites are shown in destination popups.

* Automatic Wiki links support also names and aliases with only two 
  characters (e.g. for Asian languages).

Whats Improved:

* Synchronization is faster and more reliable. It's also more compatible 
   to damaged databases. Better logging.

* Web interface allows to change comments via its "Info" panel and is 
  much faster.

* Group selector shows the type of the bookmarklet that opened it.

* DEVONthink Pro Office creates thumbnails for bookmarks 
  immediately if set to do so in the preferences.

* "Home" and "End" keys can be used in Quick Look panels without
   activating it first.

* "Activity" panel no longer takes the focus, shows progress smoother, 
  and uses less CPU time.

* Going up, e.g. via the toolbar or the Go menu, retains the selection if
  possible.

* Importing of QuickTime movies (in 64-bit mode)

* Text views don't scale too large attached images anymore.

* "File &gt; Import &gt; Images (with OCR)" retains the original PDF file
   name (again).

* Indexing unknown file types now supports "Preferences &gt; Import &gt; 
  Titles &gt; Localized display name."

* Better recognition of duplicates.

* Faster and more reliable Sync Agent for synchronizing with 
  DEVONthink To Go v1.

* Graphics of Sorter tab updated.

* SkimNotes support updated.

* German and French localizations.

* Overall reliability.

Whats Fixed:

* Several issues related to synchronization in general, sync stores on
   WebDAV servers, and memory management.

* Several issues related to text recognition.

* Several issues related to scanning.

Minor issues of the web interface.

* Badge count of Dock icon wasn't always updated correctly.

* "Activity" panel containing too many activities didn't use vertical 
  scrollbars.

* Changing the modification date via the "Info" panel changed the 
  creation date.

* Some contextual menu commands appeared even though the selection 
  didn't contain usable data.

* Toolbar search didn't always correctly search only in results of global 
  smart groups.

* Saving e.g. modified grayscale JPEG images could corrupt the image 
  file.

* Pressing ΓîÿS cleared the "Sorter's" note instead of saving it.

* Web windows/tabs were sometimes closed/reset after e.g. repairing,
   optimizing or synchronizing databases.

* Glitches of text rulers.

* Support Assistant didn't work on non-admin accounts due to a 
  permission issue.

* Rare crash after quitting the app in fullscreen mode on OS X 10.7 
  and up.

* Several minor memory management issues.

* Further minor glitches.
