,Desquitto,2013-04-16T16:22Z,How's the performance compared to original Windows 7 Ultimate x64?
,Mentast,2013-04-16T18:44Z,Is it working? anybody tried it already?
,and222,2013-04-16T19:55Z,So...? anyone tested? Why it is better than normal average windows 8 pro?
,PattyrRob,2013-04-16T22:10Z,"Installed this completely and it worked great until I installed updates from windows update.
Completely broke the OS. Cannot boot into OS at all.
This has all the flags and whistles but its no good for practical use."
,Mentast,2013-04-16T22:23Z,no one who tested can't write comment?
,Mentast,2013-04-16T22:24Z,so it's not possible to make windows update?
,jacob5800,2013-04-16T23:02Z,"with respect to all why not buy windows 8 if u really want it , will always  have a problem of activation , or . hacktivation  so I tried them all or most and always something coming up,  so I bought one and its over.  just  a comment with no arm to nobody one day or another we will have to."
,PattyrRob,2013-04-17T00:54Z,@Mentast no you can not use windows update. In the description it says you can but thats bunk.

,acsmith1972,2013-04-19T03:04Z,That's a good point about the activation b.s. I am a little tired of that so I think I'll buy this OS retail. 
,Typhoon2000,2013-04-22T09:54Z,"Yeah, go ahead and BUY this software, instead of pirating it. But don't come here and tell everyone about it, nobody cares! It's better if not every moron gets his shit for free. Get out of here and PAY for your shit and leave the rest of us alone! We don't want you here."
,yago007,2013-04-23T19:15Z,"Yep if you use windows update it fucks up your boot, and you can boot the OS no more.

Only thing that saved me from reinstalling is the restore point it auto made when first installed the OS.

Sad.
Any fix to be released?"
