A friend of mine (Jamal the Moroccan) Uploaded his collection recently. We shared about 900 songs. Unfortunately all tracks were 128Kb. Usually not good enough for a playlist. However from the 800 tracks I did not know I found some good dance tracks and sound quality is a bit less important when you are jumping up and down. Most tracks are before 2011 (I started in May 2011). So as a bonus to the May 2013 playlists.... Enjoy,
