
About the Game

Awakened by an oncoming storm, you open your eyes to discover yourself in a strange, dark roomΓÇötucked away in a house thatΓÇÖs not yours.

As you play the game, it changesΓÇösubtly, almost imperceptiblyΓÇöto reflect your perspective. It's a horror game unlike any other, and as you'll discover, its truths are entirely subjective.

Changes in 1.3.4:

Bugfixes, and generally new things. Enjoy it, folks.

If you like it, please buy it. Support the developer.

(Sorry for the long wait, I've had a ton of things going on. Anyways, enjoy!)
