Cougar Town is an American television sitcom that premiered on ABC on September 23, 2009, but moved to TBS in early 2013. Set in the fictional town of Gulfhaven, Florida (nicknamed "Cougar Town" since its high school teams are the Cougars), the series focuses on a recently divorced woman in her forties facing the often humorous challenges, pitfalls, and rewards of life's next chapter, along with her son, ex-husband, and wine-loving friends who together make up her dysfunctional, but supportive and caring extended family.
