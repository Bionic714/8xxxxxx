Plot: Director Ochir Mashbat reveals the sublime beauty and grace lurking just beneath the surface of otherwise normal lives with this emotional tale of a woman violated, and the enduring friendship that helps her move beyond her potentially crippling trauma. Jinjimaa is a deaf woman who lives in rural Mongolia. When Jinjimaa is raped by the local party chairman, she shoots her attacker dead. In the aftermath of the shooting Jinjimaa's lifelong friend, a lame farmer named Sukhee, takes responsibility for firing the fatal shot. Later, after six long years of serving time, Sukhee is reunited with Jinjimaa. As the two lost souls attempt to pick up where they left off so many years ago, neither suspects that the other has been keeping a closely guarded secret.
