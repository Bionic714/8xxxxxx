,LifeTheHound,2013-04-16T01:19Z,"No problem!

I received a request to release a version without nudity in the paintings either, so I'll be uploading that one as well. 

Personally, I think that might be going a bit far (even the most famous pieces of art contain nudity, after all), but to each his own, and these episodes aren't going to censor themselves. "
,Flame_Leg,2013-04-16T05:36Z,"Great job on this episode. Nothing I would change, although I can't tell if you melded the audio or not when you cut the brothel scene short.

Don't think you need to edit the nudity in paintings out, thats pretty common place. Colleges even have nude paintings hanging around. It's not like any of them are sexual.

Anyways, keep up the great work!"
,alottabear,2013-04-18T03:49Z,"Thanks LifeTheHound, and Flame_Leg.  You guys make watching this show with family manageable. 

I like how you played through the scene in the whorehouse without anything showing, the story was easily understandable the way it was edited.

For the record if you guys decide to also censor movies that have nudity, I would seed.  

Example: The Campaign... looks funny but because of a scene with a nipple my wife doesnt wanna see it.  

Great work and thanks!  "
,Flame_Leg,2013-04-22T16:32Z,"S03E04 doesn't need any censoring. No cussing, sexual scenes, or nudity. The first of It's kind..."
,LifeTheHound,2013-04-22T22:10Z,"Incredibly, that is the case with episode 4. Good catch. 

Should I release it anyway if no work needs to be done? Maybe it would be a good idea so it can be in the same format and package?"
,Flame_Leg,2013-04-22T23:15Z,"I don't think it's necessary, since these are all individual episodes anyway. If you released a complete season3, then I would say include the episode."
,LifeTheHound,2013-04-30T01:28Z,"Doesn't look like uploads are working right now. I have S03E05 done.
