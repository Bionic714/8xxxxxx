    Maciste rescues Ario, the son King Sandor, and his people from their     
    land in a volcanic island that blows-up and they sail to the Land and    
    Urias in a long and dangerous voyage. They are captured by the Urias     
    but when the Queen Amoha meets Maciste, she tells that the traitor       
    Kermis has joined the tribe of Head Hunters and slaughtered her          
    people, but the warrior Taro has saved them from the annihilation;       
    however, her father King Olibauna was missing in action. She asks        
    Maciste to help her against the Head Hunters, but Maciste tells that     
    he is protecting the tribe of Ario. When the Urias are attacked by       
    the Head Hunters, Maciste decides to help Queen Amoha.
