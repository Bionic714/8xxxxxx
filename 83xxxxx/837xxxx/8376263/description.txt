I'd only heard the hits way-back-when and in desperation for something new to listen to from 

that era, I thought I'd give this band a go. Well what a pleasant surprise! I shouldn't have 

left it so long. Brilliant musicianship, vocals and arrangements and packed with very 

original songs. There isn't one I don't like and some are much better than the hits. You'll 

be humming and singing the catchy bits all next day. The reproduction is also second to 

none. I must look out for some more Supertramp. Enjoy!
