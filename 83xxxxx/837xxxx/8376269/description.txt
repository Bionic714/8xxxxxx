Great White North is the hit comedy album from Bob & Doug McKenzie, better 
known as SCTV veterans Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas, respectively. 
There's one serious problem, though. It's not very funny as a whole. The 
shtick is that the McKenzie brothers are lazy, beer-swilling dimwits who focus 
on Canadian culture and rely heavily on slang interjections and put-downs like 
"take off," "beauty, eh?," and "hoser." Only two selections are truly 
noteworthy. The first is the catchy novelty hit "Take Off," which features 
Rush's Geddy Lee singing on the chorus. The edited single eliminated the 
playful banter among Lee and the McKenzie brothers before and after the 
song portion. Lee's supposed reason for participating? "Ten bucks is ten 
bucks." The Yuletide favorite "Twelve Days of Christmas" replaces the 
traditional gifts with items such as beer, turtleneck sweaters, French toast, 
toques, backbacon, cigarettes, and comic books. The brothers are overcome 
by their version, and Bob McKenzie says it's comparable to "Stairway to 
Heaven." A few other cuts are OK. "The Beerhunter" is about a Russian 
roulette-like game involving shaken cans of beer. (The title spoofs 1978's 
Best Picture Oscar winner "The Deer Hunter," which included infamous 
Russian roulette scenes.) "Doug's Mouth" features goofy sound effects. 
Moranis and Thomas resurrected the Bob & Doug McKenzie characters for the 
1983 cult film Strange Brew and beer commercials in the late '90s.
