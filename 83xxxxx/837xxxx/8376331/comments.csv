,SongDaemon23,2013-04-16T07:05Z,Works great even though the only map available right now is the prototype map. Thanks edison88.
,genuinedickies,2013-04-18T09:00Z,"thanks for this, i had never heard of timber before now. tested and plays great, but there is something funky with castle story. loads fine, sometimes... and in game the menu system seems broken, plus never lasted more than 2 minutes without a crash. but onnce again, timber is great ;-)"
,genuinedickies,2013-04-21T15:05Z,"I take it all back, i had some custom settings that were interfering. Both are working now. Thanks!"
