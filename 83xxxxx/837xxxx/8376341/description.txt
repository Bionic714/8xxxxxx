Enhance productivity by automating routine tasks and providing custom functionality not built into Access with a few basics in VBA code. Author Curt Frye introduces object-oriented programming and provides database designers with a foundation in the Access object model and the Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) programming language. The course covers automating tasks with macros, working in the Visual Basic Editor, writing functions, adding logic, reading data, controlling forms, and more.

Topics include:
===============
Working with macros and managing macro security settings
Creating, exporting, and deleting code modules
Running a VBA procedure
Debugging VBA code
Defining variables, constants, and calculations
Displaying a calculated result in a message box
Repeating tasks with loops
Creating conditional statements
Manipulating database objects, such as forms, tables, and queries
Adding, editing, and deleting records
Looking up values in a table
Requerying and repainting forms
