Description:

Yukari wants nothing more than to make her parents happy by studying hard and getting into a good college. One afternoon, however, she is kidnapped by a group of self-styled fashion-obsessed artists who call themselves "Paradise Kiss." Yukari suddenly finds herself flung into the roller-coaster life of the fashion world, guided by George, art-snob extraordinaire. In a glamorous makeover of body, mind and soul, she is turned from a hapless bookworm into her friends' own exclusive clothing model.

In this manga we meet characters from Gokinjo Monogatari like Mikako (and her little sister, Miwako - she's in the "ParaKiss" group) and Arashi's father (only a poster, but still), as well as new characters like Isabella.
