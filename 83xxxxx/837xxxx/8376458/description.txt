Martial arts expert Colonel John Matrix (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a commando without peer. And because he's led so many special-ops assignments, he's been "retired" in order to protect him from retaliation. But now a vicious South American dictator Matrix ousted has tracked him down and kidnapped his daughter (Alyssa Milano)! To get her back, Matrix must return to South America for one last mission: kill President Velasquez - at any cost!
