You're not hallucinating (but they are)...
It's the legendary toker jokers Cheech &
Chong as you've never seen them before -
in their very first Animated Movie. Catch
the buzz as their most outrageous routines
and laugh-out-loud lines from their Grammy
Award-winning albums come to life, including
"Dave's not here," "Let's make a dope deal"
and more. With help from a bud-lovin' body
crab named Buster, Cheech & Chong "the
masters of smokin' word" deliver the ultimate
comedy high and give you the munchies for more.
Watch It With All Your Buds!
