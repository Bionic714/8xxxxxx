Romantic comedy about Charles, a noncommittal Englishman who meets Carrie - the American girl of his dreams - at a mutual friend's wedding and proceeds to awkwardly woo her through one funeral and three more weddings--one of which happens to be her own.

While frothy to a fault, Four Weddings and a Funeral features irresistibly breezy humor, and winsome performances from Hugh Grant and Andie MacDowell.
