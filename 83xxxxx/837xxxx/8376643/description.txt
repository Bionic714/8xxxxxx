I couldn't find any torrent about it, so I thank yutubaer for uploading the entire soundtrack of the game. I reduced the silences so it would be more comfortable, considering the time cd readers often took to play each piece of this awesome music.

Enjoy listening, please seed, I'll (and people will) appreciate your help!
