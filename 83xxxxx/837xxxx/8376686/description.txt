Using the thesis/anti-thesis arguments to change the church mindset into abandoning Godly inspired scripture of the orginal early churches preached for centuries to an indoctrinated Roman Catholic Sunday Worship and commandments made by men.

Seed long and Prosper with Blessings from our Father. I have prayed to The Father, Bless all that Seed Long. (I have 4 year old active seeds out there, must be working for some folks!)

Ephesians 5:11
11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove (expose) them.
