,Crazy-Nish69er,2013-04-16T01:17Z,"Why do people put the same fucken shit on here, What the hell happen? When I downloaded movies they would be 9/9 that's the A/V. Now these days it's fucken shit. So get your act together and put better Quality on this Pirate Bay....GIVE YOURSELF A GOOD NAME......Peace"
,hatepig,2013-04-16T04:06Z,"Only impatient fucking children demand ""9/9"" quality days after a movie is released in theaters."
,anmar85,2013-04-16T06:54Z,"I can see the problem with expecting great quality right off the bat, but there is still a MAJOR issue with this source. It is missing about ten minutes of the film. Hopefully a new source comes along soon that at least has the film in its entirety."
,crumrugin,2013-04-16T07:03Z,If it was a NEW cam you can bet they would mention THAT
