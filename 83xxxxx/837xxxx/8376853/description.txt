If you would love to have a go at bread making but are put off by all the
kneading, proving and waiting, soda bread is the bread for you. Paul
Hollywood shows breads you can make from start to finish in under an hour
No kneading, no proving - just mix, shape and bake.

He shows how these simple breads can be at the heart of every meal. His
classic wholemeal soda bread topped with a cheesy Irish rarebit is the
perfect snack at any time of day and his dark and dense, full flavoured
stout bread with smoked salmon pate is as impressive as it is quick.

Paul shows how easy it is to enjoy the magic of homemade crumpets bubbling
on the griddle and how a simple scone recipe can transform a humble stew
into hearty, fragrant beef cobbler that will have your hungry hoards
beating a path to the table.
