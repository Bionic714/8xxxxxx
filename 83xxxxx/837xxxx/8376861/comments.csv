,jalucian,2013-04-17T05:17Z,"Uploader, you've been told multiple times in comments before - 576p is NOT considered HD. HD is only 720p and up... yet you continue to post 576p encodes in the HD section. Maybe you never bother reading comments on your torrents, idk. I just had a bunch of your 576p's moved by a moderator yesterday. Guess I'll have to do the same thing again."
