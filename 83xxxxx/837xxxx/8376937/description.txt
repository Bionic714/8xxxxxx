The following torrent includes many things I have compiled about the Baha'i Faith. There are the Writings of Baha'u'llah, which includes a compilation of all completed English translations of Baha'u'llah's Writings. Also included are provisional translations of many other tablets. The other folders include the Writings of the Bab, Abdul-Baha, Shoghi Effendi, the Universal House of Justice, the Baha'i International Community, some histories, devotionals, study material, feast programs, compilations on many subjects, and essays from many others. I found most of this from www.bahai.org and www.bahai-library.com. As I gather more documents, I will update this torrent. 

If anyone is interested in learning more about the Baha'i Faith or just want to talk about religion in general, I can be reached at smada808@gmail.com.

Take care!
