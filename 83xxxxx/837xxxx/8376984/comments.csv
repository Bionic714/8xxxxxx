,dosel57,2013-04-17T06:56Z,"Doesnt work

i install patch, copy and replace the 2 cracked folders aand i i click the exe  and it says nvtt.dll is missing.  Help?  Cant play the game now"
,Magotchi,2013-04-17T08:04Z,I'm not sure why it wouldn't work for you.  It does for me on the FLT release of the game.
,AnonymousBasterd,2013-04-17T17:04Z,How will I know if it's already working? It seems the downloadable content tab is still blacked out? Should I just play the game as usual as everything is already unlocked?
,Magotchi,2013-04-17T20:36Z,"When you first start playing, it should tell you about some of the gun upgrades.  When you get to the Blue Ribbon Restaurant (Comstock Center Rooftops chapter), the infusions, gear, and gold will be on the tables and bar."
,Resausk,2013-04-20T05:11Z,"Warning, this update will delete your saves...Just thought I'd let you know."
,Magotchi,2013-04-20T10:52Z,"Resausk: You're incorrect.  It just changes the storage location of your savegames, as it says in the Instructions section.

If you were on the FLT release, they were previously in:
C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\FLT\Steam\8870"
,ashishrane,2013-04-22T05:44Z,"Thanks Magotchi, it works flawless even with FLT version. The only thing is that is that we have to start new game.  I copy pasted my old saves from FLT folder 8870 in skidrow 8870 folder, but then also to no avail. Neways thanks for the dlc. It is worth playing new game again.:)"
,ashishrane,2013-04-22T06:27Z,"I take back my comment of saves not working. I found out that by default my old saves folder was named remote, so I changed the name to Storage and deleted the new Storage file which the game automatically creates while playing new game and Voila! It did the trick. I was able to play from my old save game. Thanks. Changing directory name made the trick. Thanks Magotchi.  It also states all DLCs are unlocked when you start playing.:)"
,Magotchi,2013-04-22T09:51Z,Glad to hear.
,anon7301,2013-05-06T12:21Z,"This works with the FLT release. However, do yourself a favor, and not install any of the DLC's, they all give you strong in game items near the beginning of the game, and once installed you can't choose not to pick up the items. This game's problem is it's too easy, and I started on hard mode. I say that, but it's not that I'm good at fps' either, for example I thought all the CoD games (from MW1 and so on) are kinda hard. "
,Maou-JP,2013-05-14T04:23Z,"Works like a charm, Thanks!"
,jakedilla,2013-05-26T15:35Z,Saves would not transfer over for me. The game tells me they are corrupt. My game is Black Box.
