A Self-Determined Future with Asperger Syndrome presents an empowering, practical approach to helping people with Asperger Syndrome (AS) to succeed at college, at work, at home and in life.
The authors highlight how treating AS as a 'problem' is unproductive, and advocate a solution focused approach which recognizes and uses the strengths of people with AS to foster mutual respect and understanding.
Drawing on both their personal experience and knowledge of counseling, the authors use anecdotes and stories to show how people with AS cope in day-to-day situations. They also illustrate how effective communication and understanding of a person's needs and goals are key to improving daily life for people with AS. The final section of the book comprises practical worksheets and resources to help people with AS to recognize their achievements and work towards their goals.
This book will be of interest to people who are affected by AS, their families and the people who work with them.
