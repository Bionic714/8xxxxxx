[H],LemonJ-Lo,2013-04-16T05:22Z,Thanks!  You are to be commended for sharing the result of all the time and effort you have put into this.
,waldyrious,2013-04-23T03:55Z,"Oh, I forgot to mention: the main reason the complete version I found online is unusable isn't that it's write-protected, nor that it doesn't contain any of the niceties I described in points 3, 4 and 5 above, but that it botched up some formulas; for example: 3+4j shows up as 3%4j, √-1 shows up as √%1, etc."
