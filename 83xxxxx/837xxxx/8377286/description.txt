While the first edition of BUILD MUSCLE, LOSE FAT, LOOK GREAT may have been the most complete book on how to transform your body, the second edition is even better. The most important change is the brand new Chapter 17: How to design your own training programs. This chapter reflects Stuart's six years of additional experience and research. In addition, Chapter 19 has been revised, as have some of the most important sections of exercise technique in Chapter 12. And many other improvements have been made throughout the book.
