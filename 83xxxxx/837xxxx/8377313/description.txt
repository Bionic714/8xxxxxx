"Guilt By Association"

When John Ross and Pamela make a shocking
discovery about an enemy's whereabouts the
night J.R. was killed, Bobby is compelled
to reveal more of J.R.'s master plan to
them and ask for their help in a surprising
way. Meanwhile, Christopher heads out to
search for his mother, but as an unexpected
secret comes to light, a rift drives
Christopher and Elena apart. At the same
time, Sue Ellen makes an impassioned plea
to convince Ken Richards to do the right
thing, even though it may have dire
consequences for him.
