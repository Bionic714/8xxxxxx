Absolutely essential tome that was the first major book on the topic. Contains chapters overviewing Italian, German, French, and Spanish genre cinema, as well as full elaborated chapters on Jess Franco, Jean Rollin, Jose Larraz, Jose Benazeraf, Walerian Borowczyk, and Alain Robbe-Grillet. This book is an absolutely great entrance point to the occasionally overwhelming world of European Genre Cinema. I can't recommend this enough.
