Plot: Joshua Lazarus (Nick Stahl) possesses a special gift that enables him to read peopleâ™s minds, and the government has trained him to use his ability for missions involving national defense, all the while telling him that it will ultimately destroy him — but will it? When Joshua falls in love with Anna (Mía Maestro), another telepathic “scoper,” he and his friend, Kira (Taryn Manning), must find a cure for their gift and expose the lies.
