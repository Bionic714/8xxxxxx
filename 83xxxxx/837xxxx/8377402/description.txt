Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site :: On the Monday, April 15 transmission of The Alex Jones Show, Alex takes on the lie that "sensible gun laws," in the form of background checks, will not lead to a gun registry and confiscation, which is already underway in states like New York and California. 

Alex also examines leaked photos of former Secretary of State Colin Powell attending the private and secretive San Francisco-based retreat known as Bohemian Grove. 

We'll also cover the Venezuelan elections, the price of gold being artificially manipulated, and new grisly images of US-backed Free Syrian Army Rebels up to no good. 

On today's show, Alex welcomes comedian, actor and author of Dead Wrong Richard Belzer to talk about his new book Hit List, an in-depth investigation into the mysterious deaths of witnesses to the JFK Assassination.

NOTE :: Approximately eight minutes into a 4th hour overdrive, news broke of the Boston Marathon bombing. Originally intending to end the broadcast at 3:20 p.m. CDT, Alex completed a full fourth hour and then announced his intention to stay live for at least two more hours to cover this story and its implications. I will be uploaded those hours of extended broadcast separately.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
