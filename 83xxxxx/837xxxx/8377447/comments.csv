,Pseudoplaydo,2013-04-16T06:13Z,On every one of the Defiance torrents it gets stuck saying Checked 0.0% - none of the other torrents are having any problem downloading. anyone know whats up? First time i've ever had a problem.
,BoonesFerry,2013-04-16T07:04Z,"Pseudoplaydo -- fix your torrent client. 
Use the help/faq section of your torrent clients website. "
,Mr_Heisenberg,2013-04-16T20:57Z,"^Utorrent is probably overloading, you can change the cache size in settings and that should fix the problem, plenty of videos that show you how to do this as well.


Thanks ettv, gonna give this show a shot
