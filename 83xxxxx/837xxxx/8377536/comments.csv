,mcrowley,2013-04-16T07:16Z,"Thanks eztv & EVOLVE!

I'd imagine if I were ripping multiple versions of shows I've recently watched I wouldn't check every one of them either.  Put 'em in the list and let the recoding shit do its work and re-rip if necessary.  Or I'd fuck right off like axxo did after reading too many comments.  Nobody appreciates a bunch of cuntish children except maybe their mothers.

V- Probably decent.
A- Probably okay."
,Sikkwolf,2013-04-16T11:07Z,"lol - ""Build a thousand bridges and you still have to argue that you're an architect, accidentally stumble into the ladies room drunk and you're a pervert. No questions asked.""

EZTV's contributors have upload literally HUNDREDS of rips, 99.99% of them flawless, one GoT episode has the ending song 53 seconds to quick and people are bitching like they just figured out Nickleback is cooler than them. I'm sure the release is fine, if it isn't I'll be back to tell you; but stop it with the proactive derision. "

,vIXEr3,2013-04-16T15:34Z,No subtitles out yet?
,WiiZe,2013-04-16T15:38Z,"@Powerslave0

It was HBO that put the music in there, NOT Evolve. Get your facts before bashing awesome uploaders that do this practically for nothing."

,Wamphire,2013-04-16T18:45Z,"Since at the time of writing this message, nobody bothered to give the info, I jumped to the end and it looks good.

So at least, that's covered. Now I'll watch it from the start.


@WiiZe

FYI : The EVOLVE GoT release was nuked and a proper was released. The song was legit, just not starting at the right moment in the Evolve rip.

Having said that... some people should seriously STFU instead of spreading shit around without even having downloaded the file to see if it's good or not.

Cheers!"
,jonaslorik,2013-04-16T22:07Z,why can't there be a imdb link in the description. :C

,boxatoys,2013-04-17T00:59Z,"I was looking forward to this but its a load of rubbish and I'm sure it will only be one series. Good actors spoilt by a bad script written for the brain dead who dont care what they watch.

God knows how it gets a 7.9 rating..

,Salvidrim,2013-04-17T01:43Z,"I mean come on. He's giving you free stuff, promptly, and nearly all of it is of exceptional quality. Just shut it and take it up the ass like the good little manchild you are or buy a fucking HBO subscription and watch the real deal."
,mistycoyote,2013-04-17T02:59Z,"To avoid eztv problems, wait for powerslave0 releases, after all he is a great uploader. Take a look at the files he sent..."
,mcrowley,2013-04-17T05:53Z,"Audio/Video were fine.  I don't really understand what buddy is going on about.  So he's downloaded five nuked first run low resolution television shows.  That's like what? A gB? Two gbB?  An hour, maybe two to three with a shit connection.

  Iron Maiden mixes well with whores and cocaine.  And apparently science fiction and fantasy and the whole of nerddom.  What the fuck is that kid going to do the first time he gets hungover, nevertheless withdrawl symptoms or a flu?

Hell, I'm still seeding that Game of Thrones.  Just to make first world children and the illiterate unhappy.  And see how a 20-30 second audio jog on an unimportant and frankly completely fucking obvious scene of a popular show impacts on their lives.  High drama from the reality TV gang.  Interesting stuff."
,vegamax,2013-04-17T06:42Z,haha i got that episode i just thought it was how it ended lol i knew what was going on
,KOswald,2013-04-17T07:55Z,"A/V are good like normal... thanks eztv

as for Defiance... good acting for a syfy but terrible writing. I would be very surprised if this lasts more than one season"

[T],k3nd00d,2013-04-22T04:41Z,"I started watching this...at the start I was saying ""what the hell? This should be some amazing sci-fi stuff, but this is lame and cheesy."" I kept watching, waiting for it to get better. After about 40 minutes, I couldn't take it any more and turned it off. This pilot is terrible, I do not know if I will be willing to try to finish watching it much less watch episode #2.

You all tell me, does it turn into some good sci-fi in the last half of the pilot or just a really lame old west murder whodunnit with really bad character development set in a near future Philly populated by a few really bad looking alien races along with earthlings?

I rfecall the commercials, you know...it looked so amazing and you are wondering is this a new tv show or a movie or a video game??? The you find out it is a game and a tv show and you can't wait to see the tv show. Well, talk about a severe  let-down! It seemed almost as bad as all of those stupid lame TV movies ""SyFy"" pays for to ensure they have a new movie every Saturday night.

With the CG available today, SyFy could be working on some very incredible projects...so where are they? Defiance does not appear to be what we (or at least I) had hoped for."
,nokosage,2013-04-22T06:19Z,"Upload quality was great, no problems. The show was okay. I just don't like having to suspend my disbelief so much while watching it."

I am going to *try* to watch this again..."
