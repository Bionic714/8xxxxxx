,benwelker,2013-04-16T18:45Z,I added all the bates motel s01e05 on piratebay and all of them say checked 0.0%. It's the weirdest thing. I've even added other torrents and some of them have downloaded but others do the same thing. Using utorrent.

,steeevg,2013-04-17T03:27Z,"benwelker - its an issue with utorrent. Update to the latest version.. if you're already on the latest, just exit utorrent and relaunch it, fixes the issue at least temporily until they release another update that fixes it."
