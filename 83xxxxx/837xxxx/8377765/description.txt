This is Award winning singer-songwriter Laurie LevineΓÇÖs third album but the first to be released outside her native South Africa.

As I know next to nothing about LaurieΓÇÖs background I will take the album at face value; which is probably the best thing to do anyway!

After listening to SIX WINTERS several times now IΓÇÖm impressed with the quality of the songwriting on offer; especially the Hammond drenched I WonΓÇÖt Ask Him Why and Where My Soul Sings which both use words and expressions in a way that will make your ears tingle.

Although the songs are all well written it will be LaurieΓÇÖs effortlessly breathy (and a little bit sexy) voice that will attract listeners back to this album, time and time again. There is a fragile warmth as the young singer wrings every emotion imaginable out of her songs; but there is also an unexpected depth that only becomes apparent on songs like Not Gonna Cry and the piano enhanced HeavenΓÇÖs Door which are both exquisite folk songs.

This now brings me to a song that in many ways couldnΓÇÖt and shouldnΓÇÖt be covered, as the original has to be the definitive version; Ring of Fire. Yes; you read correctly Ring of Fire; made famous by Johnny Cash and written by his wife June and Merle Kilgore. Well, dear reader, Laurie Levine is not only very brave for even attempting to put her version on record; but she actually pulls it off and makes it the sexy love song that June and Johnny always wanted it to be ΓÇô 10/10. 

SIX WINTERS is a very impressive album from a clever songwriter with an outstanding voice; and well worth checking out.
