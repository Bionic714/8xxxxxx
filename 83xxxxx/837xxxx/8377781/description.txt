Full hours 5, 6, 7 and 8 plus partial hour 9 of The Alex Jones Show!

Mostly hosted by Jakari Jackson and David Knight with contributions by Alex Jones and Mike Adams as they follow the breaking story of the Boston Marathon bombing and discuss its potential repercussions.

This internet broadcast ran from the end of the fourth hour of the radio show until the live start of The Infowars Nightly News.

There were no commercial breaks during this broadcast, so I had to make somewhat arbitrary cuts to get it down to manageable-sized files. Each .MP3 is about an hour long... plus or minus a minute or two.
