,oink666,2013-04-17T13:41Z,"The little children that leave comments here about doing things they actually have no knowledge of should have their computers their parents bought for them taken off them and spare us all their adolescent wank fantasies. I tire of kiddies breaking bad on teh interwebs.

Your turn children - ""You are gay"" ""I fucked your mom"" etc etc etc. Whatever. Your comments bagging me don;t change the fact you are snot nosed whiny little children.

Uploader and seeders - Massif respeckt and thanks, Chur!"

,dizzyky,2013-04-17T18:55Z,"@sunsetrider .. it's ""learn to spell"" not ""learnt to spell"".. wankhead"
,Swedz,2013-04-17T20:52Z,@dizzy   that was actually a typo
,beriously,2013-04-18T05:45Z,"The quality itself is perfect.
In my honest opinion this show is terrible, definitely not going to watch any more episodes of it. "
,tpbhost,2013-04-18T05:46Z,@Swedz mind your own business... 
,Swedz,2013-04-19T23:42Z,"@tpbhost Woah there, FBI"
,Emplehod,2013-04-22T02:20Z,"Don't listen to the naysayers: There is nothing wrong with the show (so far). This pilot is actually quite good. These must be people who don't like science-fiction. Besides, to judge a series on a single episode is crazy. This may encourage me to try the game again as well. Wasn't happy with a particular aspect of it in beta, but may look at it again.

BTW, the audio/video quality of this upload is excellent. Thanks for the fine upload."
,ogstankyfluff,2013-04-25T07:45Z,"lol some of you piraters are violent. every torrent is hardly seeded wen first uploaded. idiots. just shut the fuck up and enjoy the free shit. Btw for anyone who knows, I use peerblock and a company tried accessing my ip address. theyre called evidenzia GMBH. theyre a company that has shit to do with copywright stuff. and they tried accessing my ip address wen i came on this site. should i be worried?
