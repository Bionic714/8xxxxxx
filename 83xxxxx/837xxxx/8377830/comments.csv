,theshop,2013-04-16T07:38Z,Do we need previous updates?
,auximenes,2013-04-16T08:04Z,"awesome image Sitfmeister, 2legit2quit

@theshop: Update # = DLC #
so as long as you have both previous DLCs -- up to Dunwall City Trials -- then you should be good. i.e. this works with the R.G. Catalyst release as it includes the previous two DLCS"
