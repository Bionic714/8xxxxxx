,Grom75,2013-04-16T16:10Z,I tested a lot of Windows XP's but this one takes the cake. It is simply working flawlessly and has every update included. This is also the first Windows XP i saw that has SATA drivers included where you can still use the Windows XP Recovery Console.
,God_Am,2013-04-16T17:24Z,"It has pretty much everything. Your efforts are appreciated, dude. "
,YFNShyne-Box,2013-04-16T17:56Z,"I agree. This IS the best XP version, all updates, Frameworks, Java, Flash, etc. etc...

Now, if you can do a Windows 7 Black, and do it better than the others (murphy78, lolzbob, Alchemist, MAFIAA. and some also rans...)

IE10 is out now, so looking forward to YOUR version LuxLOL.  Make it the best!

Thank you so much for what you do."
,kyajibhai2,2013-04-16T20:55Z,"Yes, Yes and Yes.. I dub thee luxlol ""XP_KING"".. 
in the meantime what version of win7 do u recommend.."
,LuxLOL,2013-04-17T01:39Z,I'm sorry about the Win7_BE delay but the lack of free time has killed my planned release date. :-(
,asus512,2013-04-17T03:46Z,thank you...downloading now...but the speed seem slow...
,km11,2013-04-17T09:36Z,can you please update the directx 9 to directx 10?please please PLEASE PLEASE
,Eldain,2013-04-17T10:26Z,"I appreciate your work,thank you."
,LuxLOL,2013-04-17T16:11Z,"@km11
I would but there is no DirectX 10 or 11 for Windows XP DirectX 9 was the last DirectX for Windows XP."
,Szalu,2013-04-17T17:08Z,"I have a few questions, thanks in advance LuxLOL:

1) WMP 11 and IE8 are optional as well?

2) ...if not, can we remove them completely? Will Revo Uninstaller, or other program ""see them""?
(as with most uploaded XPs on PB, there are no possible way to get rid of them, which is strange, because I would think more ppl using Firefox and more decent media players, so they are useless for the majority of us...)

3) Also, by the optional, you mean we can choose it during the intallation (so, breaking the unattained installation at a single point), or we can remove them later?
(first option would be better)

Thanks for answering LuxLOL, and for the upload ofc!"
,kyajibhai2,2013-04-17T17:15Z,"@luxlol

No probs dude.. we will wait for it, whatever it takes.. 
I am sure it will also be as a big a hit as the xp_BE"
,tipsy_deadra,2013-04-17T23:39Z,works very well best xp install iv ever had easy to install and all updates LuxLoL you are a god among men
,NexisX,2013-04-18T00:26Z,"Nice, just wish I could somehow extract my OEM's key/whatever and use it on this. My old restore cd is just a old SP2, with a day's worth of updating after restore x.x, its said when a pirate version is better then your own legit..."
,NexisX,2013-04-18T00:31Z,...Side note woulld be awesome if someone could hack IE10 make it usable on xp. 
,LuxLOL,2013-04-18T03:33Z,"Only Microsoft can do IE10 for WinXP but that will never happen.
I would say use FireFox on WinXP or if you don't care about your privacy use Chrome. :D"
,stephen_fawkes,2013-04-18T15:34Z,"Just like to give my thanks for this release. I was too busy trying to mess around with another, regular edition of windows xp which was supposed to have the key embedded. Turns out it wasn't, i searched the internet for keys which didn't work, found ""activators"" with nothing but trojans, then saw this release.

I was hesitant to re-download an iso, but I took the plunge and it paid off. All the small touches make it the best, everything from the removed components, to having the latest IE for XP, right down to the useful links in the favourites and the reccomended programs.txt file.

Thanks a bunch.

For anyone reading this, he also included a few windows keys + an activator registry file. I haven't had to use them but it's good to see someone's taken precautions!"
,jh4,2013-04-19T06:53Z,"Is this for people who already have Windows of some kind, or people who don't have Windows and want to install it for the first time?"
,LuxLOL,2013-04-19T08:22Z,You don't need any other Windows to install this Windows XP on to your computer. You can also install it in a Virtual Machine (VirtualBox).
,jh4,2013-04-19T08:43Z,"Ok, thanks. Also, thanks to all seeders, it's going really fast."
,MNyb,2013-04-22T00:06Z,Is it possible to change the system to Swedish languages? Now I only succeed to change keybord layout and time/date and not the menus etc.

,NexisX,2013-04-22T22:46Z,"@Luxlol Well only MS can legally make IE10 for xp, wither or not someone backward's engineers IE10 and adapts it to WinXp is another thing, but I doubt someone will, not with alternatives like firefox and chrome available. Don't think too many care enough about IE to warrent such a thing.

Side not, know a script that can retrieve my actual XP Pro OEM key so I can use it for this? Also how do I disable that auto theme setup for new accounts?"
