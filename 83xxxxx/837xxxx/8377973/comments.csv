,canjoin,2013-04-17T04:21Z,Thanks but where are the seeders.
,Bring_Back_Demonoid,2013-04-17T07:07Z,"I can't believe Luffy did not use his falcon punch not once in this move. 

He used it TWICE on Hordy.  

But that scene where he used his Conqueror Haki to knock out all the marines was EPIC. 

Zoro never even had a real challenge. The one opponent he fought had nothing on his skills. "
,JohnGReco,2013-04-17T20:05Z,"1st step STOP downloading
2nd step START seeding (the leechers)

So we can all get unstuck from 50%"
,ginrayo,2013-04-18T00:05Z,please seed
,benstevenson261101,2013-04-18T04:52Z,WTF!!!! Seed people! why isn't the uploader seeding? why does he want his torrent to DIE!!!!
,one19,2013-04-18T07:25Z,I suggest just waiting for someone else to upload it because this is just ridiculous.
