i hope it's the end for dan slott, personally...

many thanks Ahlat!"
,Ahlat,2013-04-16T17:33Z,"Your welcome STFmaryville. And Slott won't be leaving the title anytime soon, he has it planned all the way through 2014 if I remember correctly. That's fine by me though as I've been enjoying his run."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-17T05:06Z,"i am glad you like it, my friend! hey do you read ultimate spider-man?"
,Ahlat,2013-04-17T15:32Z,"I've read the first trade for Ultimate Spider-Man, wasn't really interested to continue reading on. Though, I do have the Morales stuff downloaded waiting to be read."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-17T17:13Z,"i like it a lot better, definitely give it a chance"
,huhwuzzat,2013-04-18T02:43Z,"I've read more Spidey comics than any other character, but I hadn't read anything from the past 8 years or so until I heard about Superior Spider-Man. The idea intrigued me, so I had to check it out, and I'm glad I did. 

Spider-Ock has turned out to be an interesting and fun character to read. And I love that writers and editors are taking risks and doing unusual stories like this, instead of the same old ""bad guy has evil plan, good guy defeats him"" story over and over again. It's very refreshing. I hope it continues at least a little while longer. And when Peter inevitably regains control of his body, I hope that Otto's consciousness ends up in someone else's body (some D-lister), so that the character can continue instead of bringing back classic Doc Ock right away.

Thank you, ScanBro and Ahlat, for getting this online so quickly."
