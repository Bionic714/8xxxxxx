But kindly suggest:
 Which version looks better (better 3D effect) on 3D-TV - This version i.e. H-SBS or H-OU one"
,grvnvt,2013-04-16T17:56Z,My mistake in asking - this version i.e Half-OU or Half-SBS one?

I don't think there is any different in 3D effect between those two but passive screen benefits alot from Half-OU videos due to the way it works. So rule of thumb:
active screen: Half-OU and Half-SBS
passive screen: Half-OU"

Since I have a passive 3D TV, I guess this ones the better bet for me!
Thanks :)"
