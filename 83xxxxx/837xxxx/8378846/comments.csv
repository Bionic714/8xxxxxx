[T],480v,2013-04-16T11:03Z,I didn't get Randi due to coverage of Boston. I wasn't aware otherwise I would've found her on another stream. 
[V],TheExecutive,2013-04-16T16:44Z,"Thanks for Thom , 480v !

As for Randi, have you considered ordering her podcast for $6 a month?  That way the bumper music (which also gets in the way of what the host is saying for a good minute+) is replaced with quick beeps and the already commerical-free show is much more seamless."
[T],480v,2013-04-17T08:43Z,"No. I'd never send Clear Channel my money. The very thought disgusts me. Those bastards are the Fox of radio. They discriminate against liberal opinion and frankly any objective reporting. Go to iheart website and look at their news/talk category. Out of maybe 500 stations, you will NOT find a single one labeled ""Conservative talk"". Why? Because they are all Conservative talk disguised as regular objective reporting. Wall to wall rightwing talkers. By contrast there's probably only four progressive stations. How do I know? Because they're actually singled out & labeled ""Progressive talk"". And not a single one has a complete progressive lineup. Oh and few of the progressive stations broadcast only two hours of Randi. No Thom. So on. I have to record Randi from a rightwing station. Sometimes I have to record Levin to get to Randi. I have to zip through his shit or else I get acid reflux. It's that bad. Anyway, Randi's under contract therefore I doubt she sees any of that money anyway."
[V],TheExecutive,2013-04-17T12:56Z,"Of course Randi is paid what she's owed BECAUSE she's under contract.  If not she would have quit years ago.

Yes, Clear Channel is mostly conservative as a result of the the Fairness Doctrine being removed during the Reagan years in 1987. That's why the wrong-wing owns most of the media.

If I were you I'd pay the $6 a month so you don't have to fast-foward through Mark Levin to get to Randi!  It shouldn't be a moral dilemma of making the rich (station owners) richer.   Randi will get paid no matter what. 

Once I'm earning regularly again, I'll re-subscribe to Randi's show.  I did before for months last year leading up to the electios."
[T],480v,2013-04-18T17:49Z,"It's not a moral dilemma. It's a matter of principle. They killed kpoj and numerous others. Didn't they kill the one in San Diego? If Randi works for them then that's her choice. I'm just not going pay for her subscription. Hosts like Malloy who run their own show actually do need help but that's not my point.  Even if I want to subscribe to randi, I can't. My budget is tight and unfortunately it's a luxury I really can't afford.

[T],480v,2013-04-18T18:43Z,"Exec. Don't take this the wrong way, but if you were a subscriber then why haven't you uploaded her show? You didn't even have to work on them. With commercials already removed, all you had to do was just upload...that's it. 

I record edit and upload almost everyday and for someone to suggest I pay and upload instead is a little insulting. Why me? Why can't someone else pay? I understand your suggestion meant well. But there's a thing called tact."
[T],480v,2013-04-18T19:03Z,"Lack of Fairness Doctrine is a problem. But it wasn't removed by Reagan. Only the obligation to enforce it was. The Fairness Doctrine was finally removed completely under Obama. 

I think the bigger issue is consolidation, ie, the Telecommunications Act of 1996. "
