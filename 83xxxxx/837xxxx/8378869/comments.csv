,molotov1991,2013-04-16T18:16Z,"Thanks for uploading. Honestly I couldn´t wait so i used a british proxy and watched it online last night.
Is there any way to get it in HD?"
[T],GaryBradbury2012,2013-04-17T00:34Z,"@molotov1991- Not sue if anyone is uploading it in Hi-Def. I don't think you can watch it online in that way, but I could be wrong. I would have to be in Britain to record it in 720p, then upload it. Unfortunately (only in the case of MIC and TOWIE and no other reason in life) I live in Australia!!"
,nachoholic,2013-04-17T02:06Z,"Prince Gary, sir!

I've been meaning to PM you for a while but apparently that's not a thing so here's a public comment:
1) So sorry to hear you've been ill!!  You seem like such a genuinely cool guy, and I hate to think that you've been under the weather.  Hope things are looking better for ya, man!
2) I once offered you to buy you a beer, which I 100% intend to do whenever I finally reach AU, but in the meantime, is there anything you want from the States?  Look how fat we are - we've got loads of good-tasting, highly caloric processed foods.  Just say the word and a care package will be on your way!! :)"
[T],GaryBradbury2012,2013-04-17T03:47Z,"LOL!!
You are GOLD! I really appreciate the offer, but I am good thanks. I do love and appreciate the funny comments from people and the general gratitude from everyone. Laughter IS the best medicine!! Thanks again :) :) :)"
