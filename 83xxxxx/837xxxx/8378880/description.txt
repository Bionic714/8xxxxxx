http://www.Speed. CdOblivion 2013 CAM BLURRED XViD - JUSTiCE



SOURCE : THC


Video and audio both cleaned and given justice.
Check sample and see.....


First off top work on THC for the blurring and cutting the video etc....
And yes i've been lazy and used their encode,but haven't the time to cut video into loads of pieces nor
doing the blurring which also takes a long time.

Anyway the screenies below show the work done with my encode being top and THC being the bottom.
Main thing was the colouring,brightness and contrast levels....so it will be down to personal taste.
Yes this video is a touch darker but had to be to lose the glare that was in the video and yes while the
video looks sharp there is detail lost as i had to use a smart HQ smoother to tone down the break up of pixels
in the video,specially on scene changes....( fox's source was also the same,so not caused by thc ).

Audio has been remastered and cleaned too my liking in Adobe and then resaved to mp3 and finally remuxed.
Once again thxs to THC for their hard work,but heres my spin on it.
