,szabiban,2013-04-17T04:59Z,"yeap, that's it. :D
so when you install The Knife Of Dunwall be sure how you select the folder where you want to install it. I mean if in the main Dishonored folder there is another Dishonored folder thats your problem. There should be only Binaries, DishonoredGame, Engine and a couple of files. Hope i helped you. "
,szabiban,2013-04-17T05:09Z,"yeap, that's it.
So check out your main Dishonored folder if you see another dishonored folder that's your problem. There should only be Binaries, DishonoredGame, Engine folders and a couple of files. so the installer installed it into the main folder not onto it.
so get the inside dishonored folder out of the main folder and copy paste it onto the main  one so it owerwrites things. 
i hope i helped you guys"

wtf?"
,Ph03N1X_,2013-04-18T20:40Z,"To people who have problems, it be error on startup, 2 folders, no visible DLC etc. I have encountered all these problems but found my solution. At least it works for me.

If it turns out you suddenly have 2 ""dishonnored"" folders in you installation location it might be due to bad targeting when you were to install the dlc.

My path is (scince I never install games on my primary HDD) is: E:GamesDishonoredDishonored

This path is to the folder where the ""Binaries,"" ""DishonoredGame"", & ""Engine"" folders are located. In other words not the installation folder, but the game folder. This is NOT the folder where the DLC The Knife Of Dunwall should be installed. It will only result in crack malfuncion and error.
 In my cas the correct path was:

E:GamesDishonored

So that the game would DLC sould be installed into the folder of the game subdirectories.

After it was only to aply cracked files.

I had a run where i did not find th DLC, but then i just applied patch again and it worked. 

In-game the DLC is located under from start-menu - ""Missions"" - ""DLC"" - ""Knife of Dunwall"" 
I could almost not see the ""The knife of dunwall"" DLC but it was there i only had to chose it.

I hope this helped someone, if not send me a mail @-  atlantishtc@gmail.com and I'll upload a vid. on how I did install and run.

The torrent contains no viruses (that will harm your system) and is safe to use. Almost all cracked files will report as a trojan, becouse most of them are. The are designed to ""break"" into the game, not your system. It is always a risk off course, but then again you always have a choise not do download."
,kroen1988,2013-04-18T23:06Z,"@Ph03N1X_: I installed to the correct path. I don't have double folders and the DLC is located where it should be located. The game loads just fine, but there is no DLC anywhere."

,kroen1988,2013-04-19T16:58Z,"I have a solution to everyone whose game luanches but can't find the DLC's! Your antivirus probably deleted steam_api.dll from the crack folder. You should have 3 files in the crack folder of this update: steam_api.dll, steam_api.ini and Dishonored. If some of them are missing, disbale your antivirus and then download the crack folder again. Then copy, paste and replace the files to the game directory where they belong. Then simply select the game folder in your antivirus and exclude it from being checked, and finally turn your antivirus back on. This worked for me."

,PsiloX,2013-04-20T01:52Z,"I myself had the same problems as everyone else. (And I to found a solution for installation.) 

When you install the DLC after downloading. Do not install it to the directory right away. Make a NewFolder on your Desktop and install it to there. Trust me, it will work. After the installation is complete. Apply the Crack to the Dishonored Binaries in the NewFolder. Now open your original game installation in Program Files(x86)>Bethesda Softworks> Dishonored. Now Copy the Dishonored Folder from the NewFolder that you had just installed The Knife of Dunwall DLC to. And just Paste and say Yes to all. 

I hope this helped. :) "
,Dinans,2013-04-20T04:16Z,"1. Install main dishonored > Update 2 trials > update 3 the knife (i did it right, there is no another dishonored folder) > copy all the crack
result: got the application failed to initialize properly 0xc0000142

2. then i tried to copy the crack from update 2 and replace the crack from update 3
result: it works, but there is no knife dlc nor trial of dunwall

3. i installed update 3 to new folder, then replace all the files to dishonored that have update 2 triall of dunwall >> also i copy the crack from update 3 
result: same as ""1"" above

how to solve it bro?

1.Get any main dishonored version
2.I dunno, but i think update 2 is unesecasrry
3.Install update 3 to main dishonored ( so it will replace some your dishonored files) and copy all the crack
4.Make sure that you are on windows7

For anyone having trouble, try this.

- Uninstall Dishonored and The Knife of Dunwall DLC
- Make an Empty folder on your desktop
- Re-install Dishonored as usual
- Go to The Knife of Dunwall Setup.exe.
- When asked what directory to install the DLC to, Choose the empty folder on your Desktop.
- After installation, open the desktop folder where you installed the DLC and open the installation directory of the main dishonored game. (c/programfiles/bethesda/dishonored)
- Inside the DLC folder, you should find a folder named Dishonored, open that and copy all of the files and folders from the Desktop folder to the Dishonored main game folder.
- Answer yes and copy and replace.
- Now copy over the crack and steam DLL files into the win32 folder of the main game directory.

Start Dishonored and when it asks for permission to connect the the net, press cancel on the firewall window. Done. "
