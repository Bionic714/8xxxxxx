,baroness9,2013-04-16T20:09Z,"oh I am so happy for jinkx!. Does anyone think this show is like pushing all the gay taboos and ""weirdnesses"" out of the window, and leaving behind just the same conflicts that lie in any culture (straight - or anything). In the end it's about mean prom bullies vs. the smart funny weirdo all over again."

,MissAnaMatronic,2013-04-17T00:27Z,"Does anyone know how many episodes will air on this series? If this is epsiode 11, is there only one more episode to air to make 12 like has been in the past, or maybe will there be 13 and a 'best bits countdown show' thrown in and hopefully a reunion which will make 14.Fingers crossed. Also I havw to throw this in too, the comment above mine talking about Jinx pissed me off because give us a chance to watch it too before you give out your spoiler alert, luckily I only got the first sentence so Jinx better not of gotten evicted coz now I have the thought of Jinx in my head from starting to read your recap of the show and he is my favourite. @Baroness9: Please refrain from making spoiler comments again. I will come back to read it after I watch the show to see if my comment was warranted or not."
