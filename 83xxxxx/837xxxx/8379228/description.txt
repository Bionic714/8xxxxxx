Sensual Passion: Bellydance Secrets of Tamalyn Dallal 



DVD Rip (Full DVD is a dual layer, like 7GB, so I won't be uploading it straight away... have to clear my computer out of rips and things I need to reseed here)



What can I say but...LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT. Its not often I watch a DVD and think, WOW! But this is one of those DVDs. I haven't actually used it properly yet, but it definitely fits the title. Everything is nice and slow and sensual. I think a beginner could do some of this, but perhaps not the belly rolls. Either way its one of those DVDs where instead of thinking "OMG I can't do that" I was left feeling that actually, I could do it. Normally I hate learning choreography, but this DVD makes me want to try this one.
