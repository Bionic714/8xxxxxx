I recalled this series a few weeks ago and had great pleasure watching it and recalling many dear memories from the days this show was first broadcast. However I found no torrent for English-speaking people, only a Swedish-spoken one, which really doesn't help a Norwegian such as myself anyway :-)

So here it is, I had to search around a bit for some of the episodes, and sadly, episodes 24 and 25 are missing, as they are nowhere to be found on the Internet. If you do come across it, or know where it is, please inform me so a complete collection may be shared.

Enjoy U.B.O.S !!!

P.S. This is my first torrent, let me know if I've done something wrong :-)
