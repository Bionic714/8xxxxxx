marvel makes some weird ass choices for free comic book day. i don't see how this is going to build readers, since heroes appear in only 2 panels(!), the full comic isn't out for 3-4 months, and the writing isn't very accessible"
,Ahlat,2013-04-16T17:35Z,"Yeah, this is just a tease for fans and completely inaccessible to new readers. Though, what really annoys me is that a month after Age of Ultron the next big event will start (Infinity), and I'm pretty sure there will be some sort of X-Men 50th anniversary event."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-16T22:41Z,"too many crossovers!

if they were smart, they would realize the people who pick this infinity freebie up are already going to buy infinity.

they could have given away something to build new readers, for example an issue of captain marvel, journey into mystery or red she-hulk (might convince female readers to try out those titles).

i do like their other FCBD title, AVENGERS ASSEMBLE/HULK AND THE AGENTS OF S.M.A.S.H., a television tie-in to attract kids.

archie comics and valiant have the best FCBD titles this year, in my opinion."
,Ahlat,2013-04-17T15:31Z,"Completely agree with you, fcbd comics should be able to attract new readers without alienating them."
,phoenixgenesis,2013-05-05T09:54Z,"STF & Ahlat, I agree with both of you on all your comments. I went to 4 local comic stores today and what I saw was lots of hardcore fans (mostly male) and very few women, kids, and esp. the absence of NEW comic book readers. 

Not only did Marvel put out some poor choices of FCBD titles, but Disney who owns Marvel, didn't even bother to really come out to the local comic shops closest to them and support their titles and/or meet old and potentially new fans. 

I think it was great to see a short Korgi tale in ""Top Shelf Kids Club,"" but it would have been better to include in the comic some background on Korgi (for example, that there are 2 books available, that they are always SILENT issues and the story behind that). 

I think Stuff of Legend was great as they gave a nice intro. to the storyline before going into the Vol.5 Preview. And of course it is always great to see Mouse Guard in FCBD. And Scratch9 was a nicely done free issue. "
[V],STFmaryville,2013-05-07T13:53Z,"very insightful phoenixgenesis. i think that in any business, publishing or otherwise, marketing and promotion is one of the most important tasks a company has -- and often the most screwed up, unfortunately.

but hey, as readers we take the good with the bad. we can help promote comics to the next generation all the time if we make an effort. support local comic shops, donate unwanted trades to a library, show a kid how to use comixology... we probably do a better job promoting marvel than marvel does!"
