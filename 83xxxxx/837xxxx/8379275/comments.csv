,MissAnaMatronic,2013-04-17T00:17Z,"Thankyou from the bottom of my heart for giving me such quick access to my favourite show in the world. I am stuck at home with a chronic illness for now and tv has become my life so this really means a lot. Wednesday morning the first thing I do before anything is run to the computer and watch it the second I wake up. Its my favourite time of the week. Thanks for giving me a bit of joy during this trying time in my life. Big smiles going your way. P.s the other will you marry me msg was a joke, I am not a weirdo, hehe. : )"
