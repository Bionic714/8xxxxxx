Here are the newly updated version of Norton Internet Security . I believe it'd better to add some more info about the activation. This one includes BabelPatcher's Trial Reset Tool v1.1.5, which i think the safest and most reliable activation method available for Norton 2013 apps..

- Resets the 15/30 Days Trial Period of NAV / NIS / N360 to 180 Days
- Works on setup for ANY language, and installed in ANY location
