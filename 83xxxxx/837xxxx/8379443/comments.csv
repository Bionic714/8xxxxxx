,roadtrooper,2013-04-19T21:33Z,"c'mon man,i always appreciate the time you guys take to upload this stuff,but please don't mislead us by titling the upload as ""season 3"". it's not,it's just 2 episodes. i know you make this clear in the description,but imo you should change the title. peace.."
,leaf13,2013-04-20T02:58Z,"when i searched for ""Game of thrones season 3"", i knew that there would only be 2 episodes, 3 max(depending on how up to date), because i follow the shit and know its still airing. i think its safe to assume that fear_134 felt he didnt need to tell us something we should already know.

,fear_134,2013-04-21T09:49Z,^thnk u.. and my point exactly..
,Petetech888,2013-05-21T03:29Z,"Thanks for the uploads fear_134, I appreciate the time it takes to do this. 
As for the bloody flamers, they have a cheek when all most of them do is leech without contributing.

@ eddie1001 & those that flame before thinking.

Opinions are like Ars*holes, just cause you have one doesn't mean you should show them people. 

It's better to have people think your an idiot than to open your mouth and have it confirmed beyond any doubt."
,Rickyboy1992,2013-06-05T02:56Z,"How's the quality/sound? I only ask because the last torrent I got was good on my laptop but HORRIBLE when hooked up to my TV.  So sorry to have to ask. Anyway, I guess I'll go ahead and download.. and let you guys know. If it's good, I will seed for as long as I can."
,Rickyboy1992,2013-06-07T02:04Z,"After watching the episode, I had to say, I am very impressed. Will seed all of the episodes if they are the same. Thank you for the upload!
