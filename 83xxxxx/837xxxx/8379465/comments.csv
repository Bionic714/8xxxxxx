,danikhil,2013-04-16T15:51Z,thanks for the DLC
,Zozur,2013-04-16T21:27Z,"Douchebag nosTEAM. Why the fuck do you repack the whole game just for a 3 gig DLC? I guess you just repack games from other releasers.

Wasn't expecting this kinda shit from you man."
,butoi24,2013-04-16T22:54Z,"Fuck you zozur , keep up the good work nosTEAM.
Does this repack includes all the updates ?"
,terjitt,2013-04-17T01:41Z,"Thanks Nosteam.  Had a hard drive failure and lost my copy so this repack is welcome, no matter what some assholes say."
,kilatdaguob101,2013-04-17T02:10Z,"@Zozur, nosTEAM is doing that so that people who's not a computer whiz will not have a hard time(i guess). not like other torrents that you need to mount the disc and paste the crack to make it work. nosTEAM is just making things convenient for us."
,Kill3rXD,2013-04-17T06:42Z,Shut up zozur. Nosteam is doing a real good work. You know some people delete the game after they end it and they have to download it again to play the dlcs.
,BluntzNzigzags,2013-04-17T06:59Z,"@zozur

if you don't like it don't download it, no need to go onto the comments and talk shit. and btw your the douchebag"

,nosTEAM,2013-04-23T11:18Z,@ mustafa99 - is related to Reloaded c'rack and is a false positive
,thefredericth,2013-04-24T18:12Z,unable to play because steam_api.dll is missing. I tried downloading the file and placing it in game folder but still nothing :( anyone has had this problem?
,scourger,2013-04-26T13:50Z,"I can't open my game menu!!!
When i play and the game tries to autosave i get the message ""Game could not be saved"" and then every time i try to accest the interface the game blocks but doesen't stops responding and there is nothing i can do"
,okirokai,2013-04-29T07:53Z,@thefredericth - you need to go his link when installation is complete.. there's a patch there that you need to download.. Your Welcome :)
,devilboy0023,2013-05-01T20:21Z,@okirokai it didnt work it still says its missing steam_api.dll
,DaedricBlood,2013-05-02T00:57Z,"@devilboy0023 i  believe your problem may have to do with the fact that you may not have steam on your computer, that was the error that i had when i tried to install borderlands on my and my gfs brand new computer at the same time, mine worked and we eventually figured out she needed steam. hope it helps

Ok nosTEAM i love your work and appreciate it, however it might be useful to say in your installation that you NEED steam to run nosTEAM games"
,devilboy0023,2013-05-02T02:02Z,@DaedricBlood thats weird I play a LOT of nosTeam games and its the first time it happens well im going to try your thing thanks

,eal12333,2013-05-20T22:26Z,why does MSE flag this as a virus?
,cavetrole,2013-05-21T23:58Z,I have no problems with the normal games that runs great but my knife of dunwall crashes at the end of the second level every time. Does anyone know how to fix this?
