Thanks in advance! "

""New version""? What does that even mean? That game is from '96. Stick to pr0n, it's more fulfilling than Larry."
,dp098765,2013-04-18T07:04Z,Is anyone else having trouble getting this game to load?  It installed fine but when I start the game I get the resolution selection menu and after that the game window loads up with a white background but never gets to a main menu or anything.
,DarkKlown77,2013-04-18T16:36Z,"Same problem as the guy above, it installs great, i go to start it, and the resolution popup pops up, and I click play, and nothing.  Any fix available that anyone else knows?"
