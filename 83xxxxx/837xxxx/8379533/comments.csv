,Giga_Gaia,2013-04-16T17:37Z,It was on Hulu yesterday.
,cindy25,2013-04-16T18:50Z,"has anyone been able to convert this to avi?

I ran it thru freemake twice, and failed both times.  never had this happen before"
,ewjbtz,2013-04-16T19:07Z,"When I tried to watch it, it plays for 2 seconds and then shuts down VLC."
,temporary2010,2013-04-17T02:35Z,"Hey siimc, you do know that your head is full of dung ... just to let you know."
,THRobinson,2013-04-17T03:10Z,"Mine turns off after 2sec as well using XBMC media server. Will find another copy, be just as fast as converting."
,THRobinson,2013-04-17T03:14Z,"Ha, weird... on a whim, I decided to run it through MKVMerge and basically just re-saved it without any conversion or re-rendering, took 5 seconds and works fine. Has a small hiccup where it normally would shut off so, maybe a corrupted spot?"
,esdii,2013-04-21T18:00Z,^^ that works or just skip to 4 seconds...
