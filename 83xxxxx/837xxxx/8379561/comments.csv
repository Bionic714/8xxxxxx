[V],TorrentTracts,2013-04-16T21:34Z,"Lillbas19, try calming down.  The torrent was only a couple of hours old when you posted with such desperation in your words.  If you're that hard up for an album included with, then perhaps try buying it.

As I mentioned to another user in my 12th bundle, my internet has been spotty at best this year.  So I can either (1) stop torrenting entirely, or (2) you can show a little patience.  Your choice."
,ninjanz,2013-04-16T22:30Z,Have to say im all good to wait for this bundle thanks so much Been waiting for Andy Mineo fr a while any chance u can upload kj 52 dangerous deluxe when it comes out
,ITFPB,2013-04-17T02:26Z,"Thanks, TorrentTracts. I thought you forgot about me. This truly makes me appreciate even more all the work that you do. I am patiently waiting. Thanks and God Bless."
,TedDekker,2013-04-17T03:07Z,TorrentTracks! You are the best my friend! Please do not let any get to you because your work is truly amazing and you do whatever you need to do whenever you need to do it! I wish I could help in some way! Keep up the amazing work my friend!
[V],TorrentTracts,2013-04-17T03:18Z,"ITFPB, good to hear from you!  You'll be happy to know that I acquired a copy of that new Kurt Carr album this past weekend.  Totally forgot all about it.  So when I saw it sitting on my hard drive earlier today, I checked it out.  And it's good to go, and will be included in my 14th bundle for you, Scorp804, and littleredcorvet.  :)"
,WallySlam,2013-04-17T03:20Z,"Wow, thanks bro! Was not expecting Heroes For Sale to be up so soon, it just came out today! Keep up the work. God Bless :-)"
,soggal,2013-04-17T04:15Z,hey TT i cant remember if i wish you a happy new year. Anyhow blessings your way my brother.
,kunstee,2013-04-17T05:25Z,hey it's coming up with a red exlcamation point? saying that it can't write to file? how do i fix?
,soggal,2013-04-17T12:35Z,"hey TT i notice track 8,12 and 16 not showing up when i download, have any idea why?"
,Tiga1234,2013-04-17T15:21Z,"For the 14th bundle, can you please find:
Martin Smith- God's Great Dance Floor 2013 album for me. It comes out on April 23, 2013. "
[V],TorrentTracts,2013-04-17T16:24Z,"Tiga1234, are you talking about the Fourth Movement of God's Great Dance Floor?  That's a Martin Smith project.  Check out my 9th bundle in 2013."
[V],TorrentTracts,2013-04-17T16:25Z,"Kunstee, try stopping your torrent, and then forcing a recheck."
[V],TorrentTracts,2013-04-17T16:26Z,"Soggal, tracks 8. 12, and 16 of what?  I'm confused."
,studog123,2013-04-17T16:51Z,I was going through my collection and found that all of my Clay Crosse albums are corrupt. Any chance for a discography?
,soggal,2013-04-17T18:36Z,"sorry track 8,12 16 of Evangel -Eyewitness Encounters and also the track surrounding them are not downloading either. that is 7,9,11,13,1517."
,Tiga1234,2013-04-17T22:37Z,I was talking about the full God's Great Dance Floor album for Martin Smith not the EP
,super1313,2013-04-18T01:43Z,Hey thanks for more music. The Afters is all crackly and funny sounding. do you hv another copy of it? I love those guys
,shaund0,2013-04-19T23:08Z,"TorrentTracts, you're the best. I did in fact get it. If you'd like it to upload for others and there is any way for me to get it to you, let me know. I guess you can comment back or something."
,Jailroll,2013-04-20T21:31Z,"Purified! ^.^/

Thanks for remembering the little things TT!"
,JiLoa,2013-04-20T23:52Z,"Hey TorrentTracts, thanks for all your hard work and spreading the gospel in a way such as this.  I would like to ask  you if you wouldn't mind seeding ""Revival Generation - 1998 - 12 Songs That Rocked A Nation"" I've been stuck on 95% for a looong time lol once I have it I'll seed it.  Thanks again for all.  God bless"
[V],TorrentTracts,2013-04-21T18:16Z,"JiLoa, done!  There were also a couple of those other Revival Generation albums struggling along.  I don't know if that was you, but I went ahead and offered seeding support to those too."
[V],TorrentTracts,2013-04-21T18:18Z,"Soggal, did you ever complete that download.  It's an odd problem that I can't really say for certain I know how to fix.  I would simple stop the torrent, and use your client to force a recheck.  If that failed, I would stop it, delete the offending files, and then start it back up again.  My guess is one of the two ought to resolve your problem."
[V],TorrentTracts,2013-04-21T18:19Z,"Tiga1234, I wasn't aware that those four releases from Martin Smith were anything but EP's.  I have all four ""God's Great Dance Floor"" titles, and they're all EP's."
[V],TorrentTracts,2013-04-21T18:21Z,"Super1313, thanks for the heads up on ""The Afters.""  I wasn't aware of the problem.  I have since acquired a fixed copy, and I'll torrent it in my next 14th bundle, in the days ahead."
[V],TorrentTracts,2013-04-21T19:53Z,"Studog123, I am missing a few of Clay Crosse's most recent albums, but I went ahead and created a quick discography for you anyway.  :)"
[V],TorrentTracts,2013-04-21T19:55Z,"Ninjanz, I'll keep a watch out for that new KJ-52 for you."
,soggal,2013-04-21T20:24Z,"still no luck TT, i even trying to down load the album by itself but i'm stuck at 91.2%. would it be possible for you to upload that album by itself ""Evangel -Eyewitness Encounters "" pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee :) my Del Way Discography 1995-2008 is stuck at 99 % for months also. blessings your way."
[V],TorrentTracts,2013-04-22T00:49Z,"soggal, I went ahead and gave that Del Way discography a boost.  You now have 100% of it.  As for Evangel, I just posted a discography including that 2013 album you were having troubles with.  I think Evangel has 4 albums, and I only had 3 of them.  Now you do too!  :)"
,studog123,2013-04-22T02:31Z,Thanks for the Clay Crosse discog. just wanted to throw in my 2 cents for some seeding help. Kirk Talley Discography 1993-2005 (15 Releases) & 3 For 1 Discography 1998-2003 (6 Releases). Blessings
,studog123,2013-04-22T03:04Z,"here might be a little bit of an obscure discog, but have you heard of the Nitro Praise series?"
[V],TorrentTracts,2013-04-22T04:34Z,"Studog123, I began to help seed ""Kirk Talley"" and ""3 For 1"" for you this evening, but there was already a seeder there.  My bandwidth is perhaps better used sharing new music with all, and not rejuvenating old torrents.  So I'll leave that one to the existing seeder.

As for ""Nitro Praise"", I believe there are 10 releases in the discography, I had 9 of them.  And now, so do you.  :)"
,studog123,2013-04-22T14:17Z,"I am not showing any seeders for either torrent on my end? I have had them running constantly for 5 months? any suggestions on how I might connect with the seeder that you are seeing? thanks for the Nitro Praise, it brings back memories for me."
,ecsrob,2013-04-22T15:08Z,"Do you also have the album of Anneline Breetzke, called ""where the fire is""?
Blessings, ecsrob"
[V],TorrentTracts,2013-04-22T16:18Z,"Ecsrob, the song or the album? Breetzke's first album was called ""Where The Fire Is"" and her second ""Grace Revolution.""  I only have Grace Revolution, which appears in my 2nd bundle for 2012. The 15th track on that album is called ""Where The Fire Is."" Wish I could help you out with her debut album, but I don't have it. :("
,chuksemeka,2013-04-22T18:00Z,God bless you for the great work!! Please can I get Joshua Rodger's debut album after winning Sunday's Best? Thanks!
[V],TorrentTracts,2013-04-22T18:33Z,"Studog123, I went ahead and gave both of those discographies a boost this morning.  Now there are three seeders for each.  Hopefully you were one of those that completed the download, and are now seeding.  If not, hopefully those three seeders I did help will stick around long enough to help you complete your download as well."
[V],TorrentTracts,2013-04-22T18:55Z,"Chuksemeka, what is that Joshua Rodgers album called?"
,JiLoa,2013-04-23T14:07Z,"TorrentTracts, thanks for seeding Revival Generation again, I've been DL it for 2 days straight   at less than 1kb/s lol, it's going to take awhile.  About the other Revival Generation, it could be me, can't find the torrent but notice it is DL at the same rate and seen that for a few months it was static.  Thanks again."
,studog123,2013-04-23T17:12Z,"TT, thanks for the help on seeding some of the older torrents. I will make sure to help seed. I usually seed to 5x's. Thanks for all the discographies. One last request is Michael English. Thanks again for all you do."
,studog123,2013-04-23T17:14Z,"TT, thanks for the help in seeding some of the older torrents. I have one last request, Michael English. Thanks for all you do."
[V],TorrentTracts,2013-04-23T18:05Z,"I'm never concerned about how much a person seeds upon completion of any of my torrents.  It's either in their character to serve God this way, or it isn't.  That's between them and the Lord.  I am just doing my part as faithfully as I can.

But, given a choice, I prefer sharing the 2013 bundles over discographies because they do remain active for longer.  So I get to see the Lord at work longer."
[V],TorrentTracts,2013-04-23T18:06Z,"JiLoa, I'm confused.  Are you telling me that you don't yet have those Revival Generation albums complete?  Or are you trying to tell me that it is indeed now complete?  Like I said, I'm confused."
[V],TorrentTracts,2013-04-23T18:29Z,"Studog123, I have 10 Michael English albums.  And now, so too do you.  Enjoy!  :)"
,Tiga1234,2013-04-24T14:30Z,where's bundle 14. it's supposed to come out yesterday. 
[V],TorrentTracts,2013-04-24T16:30Z,"Tiga1234, then I better put up a 14th bundle today, huh?"
,Tiga1234,2013-04-24T16:38Z,"sorry, I was expecting it to come out yesterday since Tuesday's are when new christian music comes out. "
[V],TorrentTracts,2013-04-24T17:27Z,"Tiga1234, it takes me a while to amass 2 gigs worth at a time.  And with all of the discographies I have been sharing lately, I haven't as much free time to hunt down any new 2013 music.  But I got the 14th bundle up for you now.  :)"
,JiLoa,2013-04-25T00:31Z,"Oh sorry, it's now at 98.4% and is going to take a while but don't worry about it, I'm sure there is more important things for you to concern yourself about, I'll wait however long."
[V],TorrentTracts,2013-04-25T01:07Z,"JiLoa, I don't know how many of those Revival Generations you still need, but I see that there are three with leechers and no seeders.  So I am giving all three another boost as we speak."
,JiLoa,2013-04-25T01:10Z,"Wow that was super from you.  Thanks TorrentTracts 100% complete.  I'll seed indefinitely whenever I am able, so you don't need to worry about this torrent again.  Thanks, God bless you abundantly."
,JiLoa,2013-04-25T09:41Z,"It was mine from 10 months; 2 years ago :D  I see today I have 3 Revival Generation '98;'99,2000 complete. thanks again (Doubt people are still looking for these, but nevertheless will seed).  If you need help with anything, even off topic please feel free to ask."
,phish2525,2013-05-10T15:47Z,"I'm getting an error after 2-3%...I really want the new Shane & Shane, can you upload that cd separately?  Thank you!"
