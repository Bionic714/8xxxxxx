2013 - THE YEAR IN CHRISTIAN MUSIC
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Back in the comments section of my 8th bundle, Clardx1 asked me for a copy of Alexis Spight's new 2013 "Living Out Loud" album.  I've been keeping an eye open for it, and I will be including that Alexis Spight album in this 13th bundle for Clardx1 today.  Likewise, I am also including Andy Mineo's new "Heroes For Sale" for WallySlam.

For anyone interested, this is the way it works.  I torrent all of my 2013 music as soon as I get it.  Unless, of course, if there's an abundance of it, and it won't fit in my current bundle.  So if you're looking for a particular 2013 release, please know that I would be sharing it, if I had it.

But that's not to say I don't make notes of 2013 requests, such as Clardx1's and WallySlam's.  The truth is, I keep pretty good notes.  I am still looking for a copy of Deon Kipping's album for shaund0.  Damanyal is looking for Hart Ramsey.  Scorp804, ITFPB, and littleredcorvet all want the new Kurt Carr album.  Jailroll is hoping to see the latest Purified.  And Fred Hammond's latest album will in fact be included in my 14th bundle for littleredcorvet.  It didn't fit in this 13th bundle today.

So, speaking of today's bundle, our year-to-date total for 2013 up to 373 releases.

This 13th bundle includes the following 26 titles...

 * 3 Days Leave - 2013 - Rebuild My Heart - Single
