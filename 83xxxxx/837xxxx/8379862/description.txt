Gex: Enter the Gecko (known in Europe as Gex 3D: Enter the Gecko and in Japan as SpinTail) is a platform game released in 1998. It is the sequel to the 1994 game Gex. The game involves collecting three types of remotes to unlock different levels, and to aid in the fight against Rez. 

Enter the Gecko is Gex's first foray into 3D world. His main moveset involves a tail whip attack, bouncing on his tail, using his tongue to eat flies, and performing a karate kick. He can also climb up on certain surfaces and swim underwater (he could only swim in the N64 version of the game in the exclusive Titanic Level).

The game takes place in a large hub filled with several TV screens based on various genres, parodying various genres from Looney Tunes to Star Wars. Each level has about three remotes to collect, as well as an additional one for collecting 120 collectibles within the level. Collecting enough remotes unlock new areas, bonus levels and boss levels and collecting all remotes unlocks a special ending showing concept art for the game.
