While we expect this patch to be an improvement for everyone, if you do have trouble with this
patch and prefer to stay on the old version we made a Beta available on Steam, Build718.4,
that can be used to switch back to the previous version. Please note however that you can only
play multiplayer with people that share your version.

WeΓÇÖve been working closely with NVIDIA to address the issues experienced by some Tomb Raider players.
In conjunction with this patch, NVIDIA will be releasing updated drivers that help to improve stability and performance of Tomb Raider on NVIDIA GeForce GPUs. We are continuing to work together to resolve
any remaining outstanding issues.
We recommend that GeForce users update to the latest GeForce 314.21 drivers
(posting today) for the best experience in Tomb Raider.

We are planning further patches beyond this one to address various issues that have come
out of consumer feedback since the release of the game.
