Richard Thompson - Electric (Deluxe Edition) (2013) mp3



Richard ThompsonΓÇÖs latest album, Electric, produced by Buddy Miller, comes in what is arguably his most creatively productive period in a career that stretches back some 45 years, back to his emergence as a teen guitarist and songwriter with the groundbreaking Fairport ConventionΓÇöthe band that essentially invented the term ΓÇ£English folk-rock.ΓÇ¥ And thatΓÇÖs saying a lot, with his dozens of albums consistently high on critics polls and guitar skills that have earned him a Top 20 spot on Rolling StoneΓÇÖs list of Best Guitarists of All Time.

Richard ThompsonΓÇÖs many facets only seem to get more, well, multifaceted. And multi-fascinating. The recognition continues and has become even stronger in the last few years: his long-acclaimed guitar workΓÇöpiercing, delicate, often both at onceΓÇöbrought him MOJO magazineΓÇÖs Les Paul Award, his equally gripping songwriting earned him the 2012 Americana Music AssociationΓÇÖs Lifetime Achievement Award, presented to him by Bonnie Raitt, and BritainΓÇÖs coveted Ivor Novello Award, and he was awarded an honorary doctorate by Aberdeen University in his ancestral Scotland.

Oh, and there was that Order of the British Empire (OBE), bestowed upon him by Queen Elizabeth for service to music, summing up the whole artistic package.
