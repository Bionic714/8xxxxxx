Also I think he is fine haha just being all vague & hidden like normal.

And that was a demo of Jasmine he was working on the vocals are a bit better imo but I think he was still working on mastering it."

,TotopaWJ,2013-05-07T03:33Z,I downloaded it even though it's fake. I just can't wait until his legitimate album
