,frienziar,2013-04-17T15:25Z,"Ok after installation the problems are..
1-Map(Dust 2) look crappy unlike in v77 it looks awesome
2-Cant connect to servers which I used to play with v77(Steam Rejection error)"

If you updating from previous version CS:S. You must add to rev.ini (placed in game-dir) strings:

[Loader]
ProcName = hl2.exe -steam -game cstrike -appid 240 -novid

and replace

SteamDll = .binSteamSteam.dll

to

SteamDll = .SteamSteam.dll

Then off antivirus and run updater. After complete updating run game. Enjoy."
[T],bruss.aka.durka9,2013-04-17T18:24Z,"Correction:

replace

SteamDll = ./bin/Steam/Steam.dll

to

SteamDll = ./Steam/Steam.dll"

How can I do that and where I must put in my VPK files?"

Too many questions for my. Use google search engine."
,DJ_DU2CE,2013-04-18T01:39Z,"I googeled allready, but I know how to install skins, but if I make that, nothing changed! Have this changed since the update? Normally you download a weapon, in there is models, materials, scripts and sound. And this put in the cstrike folder. But nothing change! Do you know a site, where I can find how to install? Or a video? PLS HELP!! :/"
[T],bruss.aka.durka9,2013-04-18T01:56Z,"to DJ_DU2CE
Place your models, materials, scripts or sound dirs in cstrikecustommy_prety_content or in cstrikedownload - that's all )"
