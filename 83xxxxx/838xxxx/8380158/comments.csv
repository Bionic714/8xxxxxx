,Bakaat,2013-04-21T06:09Z,"@ teto_tata  --  Better picture for the size, if you go with lower quality sound. I always use YIFY, because I KNOW the picture quality is there(I can always adjust the sound), so I'm not wasting time looking for the ""best"" quality download. BTW... I have nothing to do with any uploaders... just my opinion."
