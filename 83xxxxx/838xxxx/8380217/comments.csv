,Mr_Heisenberg,2013-04-16T21:21Z,"Thanks, normally i wouldn't ask for you to upload a movie but i see you have taken a few requests lately. If you can upload Miller's Crossing http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100150/ in 1080p? There are a few 720p rips around 5 gigs and a 1080p around 13 gigs, my bandwith won't really allow me to download that much so it would be appreciated to get a rip from you. Either way thanks for your work A/V 10"
