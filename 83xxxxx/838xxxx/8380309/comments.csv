Just try to imagine: a black island in the middle of the Atlantic, with reggae Sunday to Sunday. No, not Jamaica. Well, let me tell you a story. It is known that reggae came to Southeast, initially, via major labels that had some of its tentacles throughout Brazil. 
Already in 1980, when barely knew what reggae in our land, came a guy named Bob Marley for events ""diplomatic"" to promote the German label Ariola, owner of Island. Then came the researchers, based mainly in Europe, they brought several discs that played there: the rub-a-dub. 
Until today there is a very strong tradition of rub-a-dub in Sao Paulo: Don Carlos, Black Uhuru, Ini Kamoze, Twinkle Brothers, are the inspiration for many of the bands and dj's Sao Paulo. (Today, however, there is a significant move and promising the rocksteady and early reggae, which the guys in this blog is a part).

The fact is that in Maranh+â-úo it happened differently. In the 70 popped up several blocks of St. Louis ""sound mechanical,"" the clubs that played, besides the disco, lambada and other Latin rhythms. 

Since the release of these rhythms were scarce around here, and the perceived need of updates, due to competition, the only way out was smuggling by Cayenne and Bel+â-¬m do Par+â-í came boxes and boxes of records and the Caribbean thus despretenciosamente, began a history of more than 30 years with the LP's Jamaicans who came in leading. 
At first, no one quite knew what it was, but the audience danced and approved. Therefore, the North and Northeast of Brazil is perhaps the only place where the two dance reggae, which, face it, is much better. The ""Radiola"" (at roughly the sound system of Brazil) have multiplied. In 30 years, over 400 of them spread only in Maranhao, along, of course, with hundreds of dj's. There was a time when every street in certain neighborhoods in St. Louis had its radiola, in many cases with the legendary giant walls of sound. 
And the obvious result: 

the monstrous competition between them, it did happen tragicomic episodes, such as sabotage of rival parties, throwing up a copper wire in the wiring, for example. But the good side of this is that many people were forced researching what was most unusual, what the competition did not play. Songs that British record companies and even Jamaicans rejected today are absolute hits. The album ""You & Me Inna Maranhao Style"" attempts to enter this universe of radiola parties, vast and unknown to many, bringing some of the hundreds of songs that make the history of reggae ludovicense. 

Between laughter and tears, each one at some point, made thousands of people go mad, made the comment the other day, to wait anxiously for the next party, which are rare, as ""Josephine"", which came to be bought for 200 a real DJ to be sold CDs and tapes k-7. The hard thing is trying to make a summary of this still unfinished story of decades, despite the evident decline of radiolarian, because of competition, began making own productions with amateur singers in digital pace. What is certain is that all this time, reggae in Maranh+â-úo became very rich, master of spectacular achievements, and made good music would leave the realm of entertainment in a literate middle class for the fun of simple people. 

There is a tiny piece of it all.

Hope you enjoy."
