HereΓÇÖs the tale about a little girl who meets him after he awakes her with his wobbling funny steps in the corridor. She steals quietly into the kitchen to see someone thoroughly examining the cupboards. There are small wet footmarks all around the floor and the favourite towel doesnΓÇÖt hang on the peg on the wall.

ΓÇª There follow the incredible adventures in his magical country and evenings full of stories at the homes of huge and hospitable snails.
