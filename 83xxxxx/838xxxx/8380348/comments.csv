hey blackcanary, i am looking for injustice #3 -- the printed comic, not the digital first comic -- that was in stores 3/27. here's a link, for clarity's sake:

http://www.comicvine.com/injustice-gods-among-us-3/4000-395313/

the first 2 issues were scanned by greenmangroup-dcp. could you check to see if anyone's done #3, please? it's been 3 weeks so i don't think it's ""my impatience"" asking.  ;-)"
,CeraKesh,2013-04-16T21:43Z,"Maybe because Northstar's coming out was handled appropriately and wasn't an irresponsible retcon among 50 other retcons from the 5YL era, insensitively cramming in a fan theory about Jan's sexuality and being appallingly flip about transgender people at the same time? :("

STFmaryville, Injustice: Gods Among Us #3 (print edition) hasn't been scanned yet.  I'll keep my eyes open for it, though."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-17T05:02Z,"CeraKesh, wow i'm honestly intrigued. how is it irresponsible and flip? i'll have to re-read this; i haven't read it in 20 years!

the actual on-page story with northstar's coming out is atrocious, scott lobdell couldn't (and still can't) write and mark pacella couldn't draw.

i meant to refer only to the controversy (or lack thereof) for the 2 titles/publishers."
,CeraKesh,2013-04-17T05:49Z,"to be fair, it's been equally long since I read Northstar's coming out.

consider this: there was a long time fan belief that Element Lad was gay.  when Levitz and Giffen introduced Shvauaghn, a lot of people were disappointed that Jan appeared to be hetero.  This issue a) implies Jan isn't allowed to be bisexual or amend his sexual interests (because if he could, why would they to go to such crazy, complicated lengths to force his interest in a man) and b) marginalizes gender identity issues to the point that anyone who wants to switch genders just has to pop a pill but still must hide deep down their ""condition"", even to the person they love so much that they'd undergo such treatments.

Finally, the any progressive storytelling is undermined by the fact that this was retcon #300 in a run that heavily revised continuity and revealed ""shocking secrets"" about the Legion's past.  It happened so much that it started to look like they were just actively trying to piss off longtime fans with an ""everything you cherish from your childhood is wrong"" approach."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-17T23:31Z,"i definitely see what you mean. that makes a lot more sense, because i wasn't looking at it from the perspective of our real-world problems. thanks for explaining."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-17T23:47Z,"if you'd care to re-read the Alpha Flight issue, it was digitally colored and printed as the 2nd half of Astonishing X-Men Annual a few months ago:
