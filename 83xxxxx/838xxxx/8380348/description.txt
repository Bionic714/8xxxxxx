Due to the Dominators outlawing the drug ProFem, Shvaughn Erin is forced to reveal to the love of her life that she is in fact a man who had been taking gender reassignment pills. Unfazed by the revelation, Jan tells Shvaughn a story to ease her through the pain as she begins her transition back into Sean Erin. Elsewhere, Jan's young SW6 counterpart is having a difficult day of his own as he's faced with the awesome destruction his transmutation powers could cause.
