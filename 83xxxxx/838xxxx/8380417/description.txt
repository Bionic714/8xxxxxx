Roberto Malone plays a famous photographer of women who is interviewed about his career by journalist Anna Fisher. He reminisces about his career and the sexual encounters it has led to. Cue flashbacks. These include glamour shoots which turn to sex, including his first encounter - as an assistant to a photographer where he is seduced by the model, an assignment to photograph newly-weds Helena Mirelli and Christophe Clark (ditto, DP for the bride) and private-eye-type peeping on wives who stray, during which he falls off a ladder. By the end of the interview, the journalist is turned on and has sex with Malone. This is interrupted by his wife, Lisbeth, who does not bat an eye, and her lesbian lover, Ursula.
