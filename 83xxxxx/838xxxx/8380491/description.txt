Overview:

Tyrant Ceville might have been overthrown by the citizens of Faeryanis but heΓÇÖs still a selfish, sadistic, short, sleazy bastard and no one can take that away from him. Where other adventure game heroes go out of their way to become the peopleΓÇÖs champion and save the realm, he will do whatever it takes to make people miserable and put his boot back on their collective neck. They messed with the wrong despot and now theyΓÇÖre gonna pay. But before Ceville gets his revenge, he has to deal with the usurper, Basillius (who seems to be doing a better job at being evil than our anti-hero did). Vengence wonΓÇÖt come easy, though, since the only ΓÇ£armyΓÇ¥ Ceville can muster against him consists of a feeble girl and a pompous paladin.

Ceville is an witty and colorful 3d adventure game that sports a classic, intuitive point-and-click interface that will make the fans of the genre feel right at home. While the interface feels familiar, this title brings new life to adventure gaming with unique puzzles where you must control all three characters simultaneously to advance your half-pint "hero" on his quest to be the baddest despot in the land. Guide your characters through many puzzle-packed locations and prepare for tons of wicked, twisted humor along the way.
