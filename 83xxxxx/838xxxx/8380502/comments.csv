,anboob,2013-04-21T10:07Z,"which software do I have to use to view this ? 
a noob in need of help :p"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-22T04:20Z,"there are a few different popular readers. i use CDisplayEX, which is free at  http://www.cdisplayex.com/"
,TNBG,2013-04-22T16:18Z,There's also Simple Comic (Mac) and Comic Rack (Windows).  These are the two I use.  I might try CDisplayEX again if their UI has improved any since I last tried it.
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-23T17:26Z,"i totally agree, the UI is clunky. however, i think it is a little more stable and less prone to loading errors."
,Berni182,2013-04-28T23:53Z,"BIG UP to STFmaryville!!! Thanks for uploading this great series. Is there a chance to get issue #12, or didn't i just find it?"
