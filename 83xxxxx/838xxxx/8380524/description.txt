New Warrior Soul Album:  Stiff Middle Finger


Kory Clarke is back, and he's still pretty pissed off - at politicians, at big corporations, at the current state of the music business, and at just about everything and everybody else. For Warrior Soul fans, this of course is a good thing. Clarke and his veteran punk-influenced metal band released their 7th full length album, Stiff Middle Finger, on Cargo Records (United Kingdom) at the end of October, 2012 and in the U.S. on Livewire Records in March 2013. Throughout Warrior Soul's career, the band - and Clarke - have never been afraid to tell listeners what's on their minds as bluntly as possible.
