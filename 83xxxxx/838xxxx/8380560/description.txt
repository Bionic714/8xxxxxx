Since I had a devil of a time finding any download for this game, and because I really, really like it (I had fun with it as a kid, at least), here is the RAR file from ROMHustlers of Gadget Racers. (Also, as of a quarter after two on the upload day, it finished downloading a couple hours ago, and I just got back to the computer, so I have no idea if something happened to the quality yet.)
