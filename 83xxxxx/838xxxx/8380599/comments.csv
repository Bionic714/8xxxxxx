,sinbad269,2013-04-23T07:27Z,"@mgman770 I understand your argument, but when the vast, VAST majority of users here will have a 1080p screen or similar [whether it be a monitor like mine, or a living room TV], it's hard to justify downloading a 30GB version of a file, when there's nearly no difference in the quality compared to a 1.6GB version [in this particular case].

Also, I sincerly hope you DON'T use YIFY's torrent's if you have a monitor that is over 1080p. That's like getting a reasonably good DVDRip and playing it on a 1080p screen"
