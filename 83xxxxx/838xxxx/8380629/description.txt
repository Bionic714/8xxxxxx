Less than 2 months after the classic MOANIN' LP (30-OCT-1958) this

music was recorded live at the Paris Olympia.  Included are extended

versions of Bobby Timmons' MOANIN' and Benny Golson's  ARE YOU REAL?

which were both on the earlier Van Gelder studio recording.


If forced to choose, this lineup would be my favorite of all the 

variations of the Messengers.  This choice is largely based upon the

contribution of writer/arranger/tenorist Benny Golson. (same personnel

as the MOANIN' LP)
