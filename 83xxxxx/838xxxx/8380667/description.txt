Backstreet Boys - Black & Blue (Chinese Release)(with Cover Art)

Yes, another cool disc rescued from the racks of a Salvation Army.  I think I will become a regular shopper. Maybe you should too?  )

According to the UPC barcode, this disc does not exist. But I don't know how that stuff works in foreign countries, but the way this thing is put together is cool in itself.  At first I could not figure out how to open it, because the hinges are in the reverse of what I'm used to.  Also, this has the full album on it, plus another song (What Makes You Different (Makes You Beautiful)), plus, it has four of their previous hits at the end.  There are other Black and Blue torrents up, but none are like this one!!

I also tried to scan what the jewel case looks like, just so you don't think I'm crazy......much.

MP3's 320kbps plus cover scans. 

If you find any words spelled wrong, it's because that is the way it appears on the labeling.  Check out the scans.

Please seed it and enjoy it!
