Described as ΓÇÿWest African music meets Jimi Hendrix,ΓÇÖ the fluid kora stylings of Ba Cissoko add new dimensions to the traditional. Originally from Guinea, Ba now lives and performs in France. The European influences are here, but the African beats interwoven with the multilayered kora sounds still dominate. Produced by Philippe Eidel (Gipsy Kings).
