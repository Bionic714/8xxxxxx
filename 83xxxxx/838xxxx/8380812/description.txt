!Reup!

Action and puzzles on the high-seas! In Overboard you captain 
a small galleon style ship through all kinds of dangerous 
environments. Levels consist of interconnected puzzles and combat 
engagements (against pirate vessels). Reward treasures, increasingly 
more potent weapons and progressively devious puzzles keep the 
pacing alive.

Launch broadside volleys of cannon shot and man the front guns
to decimate everything that stands in your way. Other vessels?
Shoot them. Gun turrets? Shoot them. Switches? Shoot them, too.

Progress through various environments, each rich with unique,
arcade-style hazards and enemies, all made to a special
cartoon theme. Suitable for children 8 and up!

Overboard! supports solo- and multi-play.
