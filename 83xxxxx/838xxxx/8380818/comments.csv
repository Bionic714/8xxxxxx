will this possibly be a regular posting for you?
I hope so, the sources for the entire Sky broadcast unaltered are thinning out, can't get the European sources over here in N.A "

,aimz7,2013-04-22T05:56Z,"Thank you very much... really... I saw the F1's live Quaylis and Races, but the 50fps gives you a whole new experience on the screen even knowing who's going to win each round, and above all the entertainment from the Pre and Post sessions is superb. Again, thank you for the effort, detail and your time to do all this work. I'm always waiting, only, for your next F1 upload."
