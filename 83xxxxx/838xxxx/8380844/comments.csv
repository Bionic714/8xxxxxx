,Stefanovics,2013-04-18T20:31Z,"""Crashing during the third act 
The DLC appears to crash a lot for people in the third act, no solution.""

So i will never be able to play it through?
wtf?"
,Tardivex,2013-04-24T01:15Z,"I can't play it, I install it just fine but when I launch the game and click on Missions the DLC just isn't there, and it also makes Dunwall City Trials disappear too...

How do I fix this?"
,jakedilla,2013-05-05T20:43Z,"sooo... can any of the 19 people seeding this confirm it woriks? Also, why is it 2 gb instead of 3? Anything cut out, or just compressed?"
