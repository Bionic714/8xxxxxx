Cabaret of Souls is an album released by Richard Thompson on 10 October 2012 on Beeswing Records. It was recorded at Bruce Ryan Soundstage at Idyllwild Arts Academy Idyllwild in May 2011.

This album grew out of a small project that was planned for 2009 convention of the International Society of Bassists.

The society wished to honour Thompson's friend and frequent collaborator Danny Thompson, and commissioned Richard Thompson to write a piece to be performed at the convention and which would highlight Danny Thompson's skills. What Richard Thompson eventually delivered was a collection of thematically linked songs with narration in between the songs.

The theme is a "talent contest" in the afterlife between the souls of recently deceased people. Each soul sings a song revealing key elements of their lives, including a crucial sin or vanity. After each performance by a soul the Keeper Of Souls and his assistants sing or speak in reply.

The album was not made available in retail stores. It could be ordered from Thompson's own on-line store or purchased at live shows.
