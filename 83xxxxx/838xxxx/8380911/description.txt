Storyline:


Joshua Jackson (The Skulls, TV's Dawson's Creek) and Jamie King (Pearl Harbor) star in a hysterically rowdy look at small-town life and big-time trouble...deep in the heart of Texas. Also starring DJ Qualls (The New Guy, Road Trip), Matthew Davis (Blue Crush), Ryan Hurst ( Remember the Titans, Sons Of Anarchy) and recording artist John Mellencamp (Falling From Grace).

With a couple grand in the bank and a dream in their hearts, Earl Crest (Jackson) and his girlfriend Baby (King) plan their escape to Los Angeles from their hometown of Bennett, Texas. But a dim-witted cousin (Qualls), an ex-con and an angry drug lord threaten to derail their plans. Now, with just 48 hours to straighten things out, Earl finds himself in the middle of a mess-bigger than the entire state of Texas.
