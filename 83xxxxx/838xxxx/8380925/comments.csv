This is kind of a duplicate request, but I'll ask it anyway on the off chance that someone will be able to point me in the right direction...
Is there any chance of someone doing a collection of Comico, Innovation, and/or Caliber titles, or is there such an animal already in existence?  I never got to read any of their stuff when it was current, and after recently getting a pack of The Maze Agency and seeing the quality of that title along with the ads for the other stuff, I'm interested in reading more from those publishers.  I don't see many torrents for that material around, though.  :("

@stoooopid316, you're welcome.  I only have a handful of titles from Caliber, Comico, and Innovation which all are already on TPB.  Perhaps STFmaryville will have some to share.  If not, if there's a particular title you're interested in, let me know and I'll see if I can find it."

I know your skills at sniffing out hard-to-find items are top-notch just from seeing what you've posted in the past...hopefully you either have some of these titles laying on a hard drive somewhere or know of some out-of-the-way forum where they've been posted, because I've come up with nothing.  :(

You are hugely appreciated, BC, even if you can't help with this particular request...you've already filled hundreds!"
