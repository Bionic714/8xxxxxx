,Pruusis,2013-04-19T18:55Z,"works really great, but a bit laggy sometimes...any suggestions?"
,kasperkid,2013-04-20T23:42Z,really laggy cant play
,noobnak,2013-04-21T02:53Z,"sorry about that, but what do you expect, this just a wineskin port"
,kasperkid,2013-04-21T19:39Z,its allright hopefully they can make a native version
,patwik,2013-04-22T01:22Z,works fine. excellent port. fast download. will seed for as long as I can
,kasperkid,2013-04-22T05:57Z,all the other assassins creed games work perfectly its a shame this one doesnt
,noobnak,2013-04-22T10:05Z,"@kasperkid

Other assassin's creed are native port but this just only a wineskin port and that is why you have graphic issue"
,noobnak,2013-04-22T10:08Z,and btw what system you are running kasperkid
,adarsh12,2013-04-22T19:04Z,"i have an issue. downloaded and extracted the file...copied it onto the applications folder.

when i run the game, i don't change the name from 'desmond'...but after the initial sequence where they recap the story, the tiny diamond on the right stops spinning. it gets stuck there...

so basically i cannot play the game as i can't get past the recap video..

any suggestions?

am using a macbook pro intel i7 processor.... running the latest version of mountain lion... "

,kasperkid,2013-04-23T02:52Z,sorry for the repost
,bloopton,2013-04-23T03:49Z,"weird, is there any reason why this works better on bootcamp compared to wineskin (really laggy) even though its on my same computer?"
,noobnak,2013-04-23T13:32Z,please SEED after download
,le_manol,2013-04-24T00:46Z,"Come on guys, this is ThePirateBay!

We've got to find an issue for the freaking lag in the game!"
,noobnak,2013-04-25T15:10Z,"for the laggy issue

right click on the wrapper and show package contents then go to drive_c/assassin's creed revelations and delete the systemdetect.dll"
,friaug,2013-04-25T15:52Z,"hey guys, where are all the seeders? I've been downloading for 4 days straight. i really don't want to be a pain, but please seed so the rest of us can seed as well!"
,kasperkid,2013-04-25T23:31Z,thanks noobnak hope this works
,kasperkid,2013-04-26T00:03Z,thanks the lag is more bearable now and I can play
,friaug,2013-04-26T02:39Z,"Hey man, thanks for the upload, but, just like kasperkid, i have a large amount of lag. I deleted the systemdetect.dll file and lowered the graphic quality to a minimum, but it is still kind of a problem. It is playable, but i can hardly concentrate on the game. Any advice would be appreciated, and still it is a good torrent."
,noobnak,2013-04-28T04:46Z,Does anybody know how to fix the recap video
,tensified,2013-04-28T20:40Z,how come when i unzip and click the game it won't open?
,4vrDwnldr,2013-05-06T19:14Z,"got everything working but the lag just won't go away. 

Processor: 2.7 GHz Intel Core i7
Memory: 16 GB 1600 MHz DDR3
Graphics: Intel HD Graphics 4000 512 MB
Software: OS X 10.8.3 (12D78)

set all graphics settings in game to as low as possible. movie scenes are unbearable. at first in game play was perfectly fine until you get to playing as the assassin after you've watched the scene. and i deleted that dll file as well.

probably just end up buying the game for PS3."
,MrPooPaLot,2013-05-07T20:30Z,"it works just fine for me, no lag and no other issues, thanx for the game dude."
,donassar,2013-05-08T16:25Z,i have deleted the dll file reduced the vid setting to minimum and the game is still unplayable anyone got other solution this is getting boring
,donassar,2013-05-12T01:18Z,did anyone find any solution to the lag problem???
,MrPooPaLot,2013-05-19T09:47Z,"hmmm....got 24% nof sync done and now it wont open anymore the icon doesnt even appear in the dock, any solution for it?"
,strawolu,2013-05-19T15:09Z,why mac is always forgotten...
,kidzgot5wagg,2013-05-20T17:44Z,When I open the game it stays at a black screen and does not go anywhere from there. If I click the mouse arrow turns into an X and that's pretty much all it does!
,Player_girl,2013-05-25T11:58Z,"Guys, seed please!"
,MrPooPaLot,2013-05-30T10:48Z,"hmmm figured out how to get it work again, just open folder contents then wineskin and settings then tools and refresh your wrapper, that shoud help, worked for me atleast."
