,baba.mulon,2013-04-17T02:49Z,so is this the movie or the mini series? coz your imdb link is from the miniseries and you are describing the movie.
,dalesteyn,2013-04-17T05:24Z,i guess this one is the movie..
,onlyHD,2013-04-17T13:26Z,"One of the movies with best ending i ever seen :)

FYI i already got this one in english audio :)

But thank you for sharing !!!"
,onlyHD,2013-04-17T13:31Z,"Mine also director's cut. But i will get this one too, since mine got no director's comment."
,jalucian,2013-04-17T17:31Z,"My bad on the IMDb link... I didn't notice there were two entries. I was running on very little sleep when I posted that. Here is the correct IMDb link:

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082096

And onlyHD, shame on you for watching a foreign film that's been dubbed. Dubbing absolutely RUINS movies. You should always watch foreign films in the original language with subs. I don't know how people stand watching dubbed movies. It completely removes the acting from the actor because you loose the emotional inflections in the voice. Terrible, terrible stuff, that dubbing."
,jalucian,2013-04-17T17:36Z,"tpb really needs an ""edit"" feature like other torrent sites. This is the only site I know of that doesn't have any way for corrections like that to be made after posting."
,jalucian,2013-04-17T18:54Z,"Also, why does IMDb list the miniseries as 1985 when the miniseries version was the first version, preceding the movie versions, which were 1981?

,onlyHD,2013-04-18T07:49Z,"Jalucian, yeah dubbing sucks.

I prefer using dubbed movies until Millennium trilogy from yify. It was bad and i stopped using dubbed versions. 

Years before when i desperately need Das Boot, i got my hands on english version only but it was not that bad.

And if you want to edit your torrent seek help from TPB forum (suprbay) and if you got their attention they might help you. I hope you will get their help :)"
,MsPeachy,2013-04-22T17:52Z,Thank you. I like your choice of movies.
