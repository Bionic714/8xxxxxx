Notes:

This is the Director's Cut of Das Boot in original German with English subtitles. The second audio track of the Director's Commentary is however in English. Many Das Boot torrents are labeled incorrectly. The theatrical release is 149m (2h29m), the Director's Cut is 208m (3h28m) and the original uncut version is 293m which was actually a 6 part miniseries.

Bitrates listed are variable, using multi-pass encoding for maximum quality, which means the numbers you see are average bitrates.

Please note that my bitrates and file sizes are optimized for those who store and watch movies on their computers. The bitrates are high enough to look perfect on "normal" sized monitors and low enough to keep download times short and the file size small enough for those who have limited hard drive space to work with. If you plan on watching something on a large HD screen, you may need one of the larger file size, higher bitrate torrents. The larger the screen you'll be watching on, the higher the bitrate has to be to maintain picture quality. If you have a large screen, you'll need to experiment too see what bitrate it takes to maintain a quality picture for your particular size screen.

As far as I can tell, this is the only torrent of the Director's Cut in 720p that includes the Director's Commentary track, so please seed as long as possible, preferably until reaching a share ratio of at least 3:1.
