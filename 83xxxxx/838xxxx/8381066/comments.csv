No surprise this ""movie"" lost money."
,felix1984,2013-04-17T19:18Z,@DanyBoss : thanks for the trailer and all but the quality of a film has nothing to do with opening weekend or total grosses...
,thuganomie,2013-04-17T19:59Z,wonder what eric cartman would say
,arildus,2013-04-18T05:28Z,Thanx:)
,lanebob13,2013-04-18T08:21Z,"@DanyBoss

if all movies made that kind of money then there would be no movies anymore. If you break even then the movie sucks. Not to mention I'm sure dude was talking about us only. "
,mmosakuji,2013-04-18T09:31Z,"Ugh.. just save yourself the DL, AV was fine 10/10, but my god, I really tried for about 30 minutes before I gave up and deleted it off my pc. What a POS movie.
Humor level: -9000"

,mrknowitawl,2013-04-18T14:42Z,"Very good movie, if you were looking for a comedy with all out laughs, this was not that type of movie. The film was meant to paint a story of a mother and son going a trip and in their travel they build a bond  they never had. Not a movie for this young immature generation, but for those that no anything about being raised by your mom, this one is for you..."
,amiga902,2013-04-18T20:23Z,"Used to skim through comments about peoples m-rating but eventually I learned that movies some people think are 0% funny - are 100% funny to me. Getting this despite negative comments above, thx"

A great movie to watch with your mother, not that funny IMO."
,DrugSquad66,2013-04-21T13:34Z,"this movie was so bad it made me want to cut my face off and head butt children. i'd rename it to ""Cocksuckers"""
,Catsar,2013-04-26T21:57Z,"@DrugSquad66 Your disturbed just for thinking up that comment.  @ Everyone Else, Please leave a/v/m ratings and leave the biased/racist opinions out of it cause noone wants to hear your immature rants and attacks on others.  If you don't agree with this you are probably very young and completely unsuccessful and may want to rethink your life."
,Catsar,2013-04-26T21:58Z,"a 10 v 10 m 7 was a good movie in my opinion, though as said by others not a laugh fest but mildly funny."

,Kulturalist,2013-05-01T09:34Z,"Some of the best entertainment is the comments made at Piratebay...@drugSquad66 seriously!

scen4all: big up on the movie quality"
,Kulturalist,2013-05-01T09:35Z,opps     @scen4all
,emcinc,2013-05-06T22:18Z,This may all be true but I do not come here for criticism of the plot or storyline simply the a/v quality thanks! 
,tamimc,2013-05-14T05:08Z,"thank you for the movie, looks good"
,ydnarmai,2013-05-23T02:57Z,Chick flick for sure. Disappointed with Seth Rogen for participating in this film.
