,danjaq,2013-04-17T21:28Z,"SteelerJ17, thanks a lot! 

Amazing to get Criterion releases on ISO file...

Can you give a list of your Criterion belongings, so that we can ask for some titles? THE SMALL BACK ROOM, by any chance?"
,SteelerJ17,2013-04-17T22:03Z,@danjaq You can e-mail me your lists to jplut08@yahoo.com. Also I'm looking for Hard Boiled and Robocop with full menus/features iso. 
,danjaq,2013-04-17T23:45Z,"@SteelerJ17 many thanks, once again!"
,SteelerJ17,2013-04-18T00:31Z,"@danjaq The following Criterion's that I have The Rock, Being John Malkovich, Spartacus, Shallow Grave and Armageddon. I can always get Criterion's through my local library. "
,Waikiki2008,2013-04-18T03:07Z,Many Thanks
,famemon78,2013-04-18T18:16Z,sounds brilliant Steeler :) ya i got u bookmarked now :) .. Small Black Room definitely seems like a hard one to get a hold of.  In the meantime perhaps some tv shows if its a possibility ? Iv been waiting FOREVER to try and grab an up of How I Met Your Mother Season 7 and One Tree Hill Season 8 from somewhere the only ones missing out of my collection. Would be much obliged if u went thru the trouble of upping any or both of those !
,SteelerJ17,2013-04-19T00:12Z,@famemon78 Thank you for bookmarking me. As for uploading tv series. It's going to be too much for me. Movies are much easier. Please understand. 
,SteelerJ17,2013-04-19T02:20Z,@danjaq I looked up The Small Back Room. I could not find it on DVD or Blu-Ray
,Talos63,2013-05-04T08:38Z,Thanks so much for this. Could we please have some more seeders?
