British patriotism is the order of the day in Red Ensign, a film about a nefarious attempt to economically sabotage the British shipbuilding industry. The guy who tries to fight this is thoroughly obnoxious and not above a little foul play himself - a modern anti-hero.

I have had complaints about these mp4's, but they play just fine in VLC - which is all I ever use. If you need super-loud volume, you can run the file through SUPER C and check "adjust volume". I think the quality is impressive for such an old movie, especially the file is so small.
