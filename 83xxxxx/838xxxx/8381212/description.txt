Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site :: On this Tuesday, April 16 edition of The Alex Jones Show, Alex breaks down the Boston Marathon terror attack and its aftermath as the official story begins to unravel and the establishment media prepares to blame so-called "rightwing" patriots for the deadly incident. 

On this important edition of the show, Alex talks Stewart Rhodes of the Oath Keepers about the attack, and also Mike Adams of NaturalNews.com and Douglas J. Hagmann, the founder and director of the Northeast Intelligence Network.


NOTE: The extended broadcast today ended at 5:00 p.m. and consisted largely of Jarkari Jackson and David Knight taking calls -- some interesting and some less so. I'm including with this upload a roughly half-hour segment from hour five that contains the Stewart Rhodes interview. The first minute or so is missing. Sorry.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
