I made this CD of the vinyl album years ago as there was nowhere else to get it.
This is being shared in full CD quality WAV format. Below is Wiki info on the album.


Filthy is the third album by rapper/DJ, Egyptian Lover. The album was released in 1988 for Priority Records and was produced by Egyptian Lover himself. The album was both a commercial and critical failure only making it to #99 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and producing no hit singles.
