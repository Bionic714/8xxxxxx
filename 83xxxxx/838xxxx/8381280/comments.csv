,NullUnit,2013-04-17T04:45Z,I didn't think this was scheduled until the 29th of April...
,Bean-Bandit,2013-04-17T05:18Z,Well I doubt it would be a fake from eztv. Then again it could be a mistake but there are others posting it.

EZTV Never posts fakes. :)
There is the ccasional flawed scene release, but never fakes. 

Early, OnDemand, Sneak peek.
This is a one-off.
To my knowledge, there will NOT be an early (ondemand) release next week.
The schedule on the show information page is correct.
