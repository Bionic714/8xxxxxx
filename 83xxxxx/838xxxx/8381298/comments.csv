,dandadestroyer,2013-04-17T04:58Z,"thanks!
hey,just a random question,how much comics do you actually own?tpb,hc and all that"
,binderguy1,2013-04-17T05:11Z,"Don't think anybody'd mind how you count, STFmaryville!  ;-)

Thanks for the ul!"
,tdurden83,2013-04-17T05:43Z,"thx for another great contribution, and especially for WildCATS/Aliens. I've been wanting to read and add that to my Ellis collection forever"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-17T05:54Z,"dandadestroyer, about 50. you should've asked me a year ago. i had somewhere between 11 and 13 thousand in my collection, but this year i decided it was time to sell it all and go digital. now i have 1,845 .cbr and .cbz files, with close to 500 of those being collected editions. i'm still buying 5-8 new comics weekly, and giving away/selling them as i go."
,dandadestroyer,2013-04-17T07:22Z,"11-13??DAMNNN.I wish I could even do that.I live  in Hong Kong so it's hard to get english comics.All we have here is manga and Chinese comics.I'm Not Chinese so it's hard..been here 18 years and i still don't speak the damn language except ordering noodles.So,digital for me all the way.You have a real long history with comics,that's fuckin' awesome"
,stoooopid316,2013-04-17T10:43Z,"Long time lurker, first time poster...been loving yours and blackcanary's posts!

Is there any chance of someone doing a collection of Comico, Innovation, and/or Caliber titles?  I never got to read any of their stuff when it was current, and after recently getting a pack of The Maze Agency and seeing the quality of that title along with the ads for the other stuff, I'm interested in reading more from those publishers.  I don't see many torrents for that material around, though.  :("
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-17T13:40Z,"dandadestroyer, it was a nice collection to have, but many of the comics i only read one time. my wife is nice and reads TWD and some vertigo. but so many boxes! many of them were good memories, but i let go. digital takes up much less space! today i have one long box in the bedroom.

i started downloading from TPB maybe 7 years ago. now i seed and share, and collect what i want with no plastic bags or cardboard boxes! ;-)"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-17T13:45Z,"stoooopid316, hopefully blackcanary reads your post. as the expert on finding obscure and rare scans, she has amazed me many times. (i mean dinosaurs for hire, really?!)

anyway i'll try to find some of those in a couple of days, too."
,NEL117,2013-04-17T15:24Z,"jesus! with all ur collections im gonna dl i think im gonna be a senior citizen when im finish downloading it.. damn this broadband im using.. i finished the batman series almost 2 years of waiting , 2 years oh oh god. im hooked. sorry about that just that im happy.. this collections of yours i think 25gig+++. MARAMING SALAMAT STF. THANK YOU VERY MUCH STF.. WHOOSSSA."
,Ahlat,2013-04-17T15:33Z,"Thanks for these, definitely going to read Alpha Flight and The Underwater Welder. 
By any chance do you have a torrent with an Iredeemable omnibus? I only ask becuase I got an Incorruptible digital omnibus off of another one of your torrents similar to this."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-17T16:17Z,"i know i don't have the irredeemable omnibus, and i don't think i've seen one posted. which is very strange that they put out the incorruptible spinoff and not irredeemable. i have seen a torrent or 2 with the entire irredeemable series, of course. hmmm. i'll look for it a bit later."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-19T23:56Z,"Ahlat, no sign of an omnibus version of the Irreedeemable series yet. i'll keep an eye out for one!"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-20T00:05Z,"stoooopid316, just an update: i've found a torrent with a good innovation collection. whatever i can get from that, i'll share here on TPB in the next few days or so. no luck yet on caliber or comico titles, i'm afraid. will keep looking though!"
,stoooopid316,2013-04-21T14:15Z,"STFmaryville, you and BC should've been on that pope list!

BC asked me for a list of specific titles, and this is what I gave:

Comico:
Ginger Fox
Ribit!
Rio

Innovation:
Flare
Hero Alliance
League of Champions
Legends of the Stargrazers
Newstralia
Straw Men

Caliber:
Black Mist
Helsing
Kaos Moon
Kilroy
Lori Lovecraft
Raven Chronicles
Robyn of Sherwood
Seeker
Technopolis

All of this came just from reading what few comics I have from those publishers and seeing ads that piqued my interest.  I didn't ask for anything that I knew had been posted already, like Fish Police or Elementals.

You both have filled so many requests already...you're hugely appreciated, even if you can't specifically help with these.  Awesome, awesome work by you two for this community."
