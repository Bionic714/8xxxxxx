you're quite welcome, I hope everyone approves of the quality, going forward like these episodes and one I'm going to post soon of seasons 1-6 will be compatible with Plex Media Server, since it's trans-coder isn't compatible with some codecs."

,88Phoenix,2013-04-17T06:37Z,How are the speeds so far? Curious since these are my first few torrents posted
,mercurochrome,2013-04-17T08:05Z,"Pretty slow for me so far. I think people are doubtful of the authenticity of this torrent. At the time of this writing, this is the only torrent for episode 13, Season 6. I haven't finished getting it yet."
,88Phoenix,2013-04-17T10:46Z,"@mercurochrome
understandable, I'm extremely new, but I hope to change that. I wish people that finished downloading this would comment."
