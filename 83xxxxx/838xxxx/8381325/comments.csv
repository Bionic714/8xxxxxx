Thanks for the upload, I would not donate a penny to the company for this game. I liked the original Sacred game on ps3 actually bought it but this is far from being a good game imo."
,Jacko2410,2013-04-18T17:51Z,man this game looks really great. Anyone tested this?
,GObonzo,2013-04-18T19:25Z,"game is cool. compared to other platformer type games this one has quite a bit of depth in battle. also rpg aspects with weapon, armor, and skill leveling. don't expect it be a sacred 3 or anything of the sort."
,sawuking,2013-04-19T05:24Z,@harrybutts4u this doesnt have anything to do with the other sacred series
,x3merrr,2013-04-20T14:48Z,"gamepads wont work!
even with the x360ce "
,gagvirus,2013-04-21T02:16Z,"I downloaded the game, installed, played about 2 hours, closed it, it was still fine, but when i opened it second time, holy sh*t!!! my savegames where not saved...(( any ideas how can i fix it??"
,Davenporterk,2013-04-22T00:00Z,"Gamepads do work, you just have to press escape until you go back to the very first screen and instead of pressing enter, press either A or Start on a 360 controller for it to work.

My question is, does anyone know how to change the profile information off of the one provided and if you can choose your own colors?"
,KaizoKage,2013-04-26T11:14Z,"I cant save, any solutions? >"
,zerg24,2013-05-02T16:02Z,"Same here, savegame wiped at game restart.
Please inform if solution exists thks.
(ps loved the game)"
,x3merrr,2013-05-23T11:03Z,"nope, gamepads don't work and it won't react even if you try to press A or START at the beginning (with or without x360ce)"
,x3merrr,2013-05-23T11:11Z,"oh, I just found a solution for gamepads! rename xinput1_3.dll to XINPUT9_1_0.dll"
