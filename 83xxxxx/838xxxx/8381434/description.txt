This is my one shot installer for Battlefield 1942.
It was made from a clean install on a XP machine.
I copied all the files and reg info from the XP
machine for Battlefield and made an installer to
speed up a new install. I use a keygen to install
it and have included a readme in the "Change KEYs"
folder on how to change you keys to a legit ones. You
will not be able to play online unless you change
your keys. Yes keys, as in this will install the
following.

[games with keys]
Battlefield 1942
Battlefield 1942: The Road to Rome
Battlefield 1942: Secret Weapons of WWII

[MODs included, no keys needed]
DC Final Client
DCX9
Desert Combat

This is what my gaming group mostly played. There is
no virus or spyware of any kind, thou,

I WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGES OF ANY KIND!!

This is pre cracked and I have included an installer to change
out the crack files with the original ones if you want to go
on line, thou, you will need to key your keys first. It will
also change out the original files with the cracked ones.


If you are have any problems playing the game (crashes, etc..)
go to this site.


It has some info for playing BF on newer PCs.


As for that, have fun!
