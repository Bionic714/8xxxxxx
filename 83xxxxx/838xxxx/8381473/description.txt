Formed in the late nineties, this Swedish indie/folk band are a gem of a find.

WeΓÇÖve all heard the mellowed sultry tones of Jose Gonzalez, as he mingled his way through the singer-songwriter charts with his release of the single Hearbeats (originally released by Knife). His writing talents had a past that I think are far superior as he spearheaded this talented trio through the 2010 release of the bandΓÇÖs album entitled Fields. The album has the joy of listening to GonzalezΓÇÖs blissful voice with the musical accompaniment of drummer Elias Araya and keyboard player Tobia Winterkorn.

The creation is a haunting electric undercurrent with a melody ridden backbeat created by GonzalezΓÇÖs intricate acoustic rhythms. In a sense the band have seemed to be much of a sideline project for Gonzalez, which is a shame as musically there appears to be so much potential. Their first EP was released in 2006 and it was clear that they had not quite found their elemental sound yet. None the less it did include a perfected cover of Bruce SpringsteenΓÇÖs The Ghost of Tom Joad. Their 2010 album is what turned the tables on a mediocre and nondescript sound to produce something unique but with that faultlessly catchy pop edge.

ΓÇªIt is an amalgamation of the much loved folk soundΓÇª
Amy Granzin (Pitchfork) says the ΓÇÿthereΓÇÖs more than one way to do chill waveΓÇªand it involves psychedelic space effects, boss nova sway, economical song structures and high fidelity recordingΓÇÖ. This may appear a half hearted compliment, but this is a sound that is often difficult to achieve in a genre that allows little in the way of diversity. It is an amalgamation of the much loved folk sound and the ever so chart worthy ΓÇÿindieΓÇÖ presence.

The high importance of a ΓÇÿhigh fidelity recordingΓÇÖ is not one to be ignored either. This album demands volume, despite it being quite a sombre compilation and this is centred on the intricacies of the instrumental backings and GozalezΓÇÖs polished lyrical overtones. The best examples of this are Without You and In Every Direction. I wonΓÇÖt lie in saying that they are musical masterpieces, but the tracks have a wonderful way of building up and honing in on base sounds to ensure emphasis on every note. GonzalezΓÇÖs more diverse musical interests in African rhythms can be heard in the song Howl, which keeps beat through gentle muted guitar backing, soft drumming and occasional cow bell rings. The album is essentially formulaic but this is not necessarily negative.
