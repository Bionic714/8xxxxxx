Human Like a House is the debut album from the effortlessly charming San Francisco duo The Finches. It gracefully rides the line between folk and pop, and singer-songwriter Carolyn Pennypacker Riggs brings to mind such unclassifiable wonders as Vashti Bunyan, The Marine Girls, and Mirah. Together with guitarist Aaron Morgan (Roots of Orchis), The Finches' musical storytelling attracts fans both near and far. Aside from songwriting duties, singer Riggs also creates all the artwork for Finches releases. Human Like a House is packaged in a deluxe chipboard digipack featuring twelve of her beautiful woodcut drawings. Guest Alissa Anderson of Vetiver plays cello on the song "Two Ghosts," but otherwise the album is literally a family affair: chiefly recorded by Morgan's father David, Human Like a House features both band members' mothers singing harmony. Riggs' mother Susan also lends her fantastic recorder talents to the album's centerpiece "The House Under the Hill."
