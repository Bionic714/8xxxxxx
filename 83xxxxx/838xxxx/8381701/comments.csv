,lilynthorns,2013-04-17T09:36Z,Thanks again! :D
,blajas,2013-04-21T22:35Z,"TvTeam could you please, please, please upload the HD version of the 2nd episode"
,q2323,2013-04-22T19:24Z,"OH MY GOD, THE SHOW WAS CANCELLED!! :("
,blajas,2013-04-23T06:20Z,I'm a huge Shandi Finnessey fan so highly disappointing! 
,lilynthorns,2013-04-24T07:13Z,"Slow down! Shandi, and several other contestants including Eva Longoria have announced that they're looking for a new time slot for the show! It's not canceled until NBC pulls the plug completely. But due to the idea that a CRAP TON of money has been spent on this show, they're more inclined to air the shows in order to break even than to loose hundreds of thousands of dollars altogether. So chill out. If all else fails, they'll simply air the shows on NBC.com and you'll get to watch it online to find out the end. "
,lilynthorns,2013-04-24T08:15Z,"Also, please post episode 3? Thanks! :)"
,jchen9999,2013-04-24T15:44Z,please upload episode 3

if you are not from USA, download application TunnelBear, which is easy to use VPN with 500mb/month free. it's enough for playing the whole thing."
,Habibi99,2013-04-25T08:52Z,"I am in Australia. I downloaded TunnelBear now what do I do next please to be able to watch the episode 3?. The below link doesn't work for Australia. Will the show run again soon ?, It is a great show I hope it runs until the end. Love the matchmaker part too :)"
,q2323,2013-04-25T13:20Z,"register in tunnelbear, confirm registration email, log in the application, and push ""ON"" button. then open link in browser. it works."
