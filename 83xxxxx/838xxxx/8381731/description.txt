The first full story Orson Scott Card published that takes place in the Mither Mages Trilogy world as we know it. A Prequel of sorts to the currently publishing Trilogy. It gives you the first taste of the world Orson Scott Card envisioned for more then 3 decades.

I'm posting this torrent that was only surviving on DHT seeds. I added some Public trackers to help breath life into this torrent as a story like this deserves to live. I hope you'll enjoy the Mither Mages as much as I do, and I encourage you to check out the new Trilogy starting with "The Lost Gate"(Book 1) and continuing in "The Gate Thief"(Book 2). Book 3 has not been given a release date yet(but I'm guessing early 2015).
