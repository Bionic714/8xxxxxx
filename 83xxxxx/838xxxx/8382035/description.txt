Release Notes:
--------
Once again repeating a pattern that's quite familiar from over the past two
decades, Willie Nelson follows up his star-studded 2012 Legacy duet with Let's
Face the Music and Dance, an intimate record of standards recorded with his
longtime backing band, the Family. Apart from Willie's son Micah, there are no
guests here -- just his sister Bobbie on piano, drummer Paul English, Mickey
Raphael on harmonica, Kevin Smith on bass, Jim "Moose" Brown on organ, and
Billy
English batting cleanup on guitar and drum -- and the album sounds as if it
were
cut in the living room late one night, the bandmembers easing into songs
they've
always loved but never played.

Happy 80th birthday!
