BTW I don't think seeding will hurt anyone, leechers always growing in numbers over seeders."
,djnforce9,2013-04-17T15:00Z,"I doubt you'll see a start button but nothing Classic Shell cannot remedy. Personally, I just stripped out all the useless crap bundled in the Start Screen and replaced it with the applications that I use and found launching programs from there to be quicker than the start menu but that's just me."
,Barrytoo,2013-04-17T15:23Z,"I know a plenty of programs to do this, I don't have a problem with the start screen but I think Microsoft should at least include a start button leading to it, not every user knows he must click at the left bottom to access it.
Anyways just saw a screenshot about the button which is original, that's just y I wonder."
,asusG75VW,2013-04-17T17:11Z,"I'm downloading this now. The speed is a bit slow, so if everyone can allow this torrent to seed it'll download faster without the risk of Microsoft taking it down within whatever amount of time they will. They already took down the part downloads so lets pick up the pace.

I'll report back if this is a legit version.

Also, Gh0stNet, why do you have a folder with setup.exe by itself? Care to explain what that is? My guess is it my be a sample of the version or a validation of the build?"
,Sonic_27,2013-04-17T17:41Z,"How do I activate it, tool kit DIDN'T WORK??"
,piratbaad,2013-04-17T20:17Z,"Activation works just fine with M$ Toolkit 2.4.3.

Watermark stays though. At the bottom Right-hand corner:

All ok !"
,TaZeRz,2013-04-17T21:12Z,Hey how is gaming on this is it a lot faster games like Crysis 3 and Battlefield 3?
,asusG75VW,2013-04-17T22:28Z,"1. I'm installing it now on VMware. They key works and this time it asks you to enter the ""Key"".

2. Install was fast.

3. Connecting to my Microsoft was good.

4. This Build of 9369 works. It's safe, but you didn't have to wait until I said that.
