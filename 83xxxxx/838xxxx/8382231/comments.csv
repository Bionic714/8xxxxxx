[V],TheExecutive,2013-05-14T13:56Z,"Wow, I didn't realize that the ball has been dropped by the remaining seeders!

I guess they figured after a month nobody else was interested.  I usually don't save the shows I upload if I got them from somewhere else (in this case like most You Tube -- where you can get it too) but in this case it's Jack Benny!  So I save all of those on my hard drive as long as the video quality is decent.

I'll seed this again as long as somebody is there to download it but just today only."

It's not 3....it was 0 before I came back to it this morning. I only seed these things for half a day or slightly longer. The Carol Burnett Shows I uploaded have lasted for ** months ** without me."
