Chandru lives in a palatial house with his dad, Ram Kumar; mom Sita; elder brother Shyam and his wife. Chandru is in love with Geeta Sinha, the only daughter of wealthy Dr. Sinha, and would like to marry her. Geeta, too is in love with Chandru and introduces him to her dad. Dr. Sinha has no objections, the young couple are then formally engaged and a wedding date is set. The wedding preparations take place in both the households, and soon the big day arrives. Before the marriage could be formalized, Dr. Sinha asks Ram that he has heard that Chandru is not the son of Sita but of a prostitute named Radha. This shocks everyone present, and it looks like Ram has a lot of explaining to do in order to get his son married or else live with this stigma for the rest of his life.
