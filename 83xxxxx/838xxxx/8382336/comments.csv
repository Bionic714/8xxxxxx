,REBELPATRIOT,2013-05-31T22:48Z,"What happens if I play Source with Steam online???

Because 1.6 requires that steam be online to play on their servers.


Another thing also in Source some ""warlord"" server links I cannot join because I am missing maps? or something?   

How can I fix these issues?

Thanx NOsteam for this torrent!"
