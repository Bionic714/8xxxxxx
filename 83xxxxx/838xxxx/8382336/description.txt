About the Game:

Counter-Strike: Source is a remake of Counter-Strike, and retains its team-based objective-oriented first-person shooter style gameplay. 
The aim of playing a map is to accomplish a map's objective: defusing the bomb, rescuing all hostages, or killing the entire opposing team. 
The ultimate goal of the game is to win more rounds than the opposing team. 
Once players are killed, they do not respawn until the next round on most servers. 
Shooting while moving dramatically decreases accuracy, and holding the trigger down to continuously shoot produces severe recoil. 
Shot damage depends upon where the bullet hits, with hits to the head often being lethal.
This gameplay feature distinguishes Counter-Strike from other first-person shooter games, where players respawn instantly or after a short delay.....
