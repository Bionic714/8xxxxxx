Gibe best quality rip  in ANY fucking size, as long as it's the best hugest resolution, best picture quality and FUCK FILE SIZE

,topk,2013-04-17T18:23Z,"DVD = Youtube 360-480p
BluRay = YouTube 720-1080p

Now. Watch a video on YouTube in HD and then try watching it in 360-480p - now you're watching it in DVD quality.
FUCK DVD"
