Shut the fuck up you stupid bitch. We can say what ever the fuck we want to say, rather it's about the video, the audio, or the movie itself. You need to learn how to spell before you type some shit on the internet, you stupid motherfucker. 

Now with that said, the audio was low. I had to turn the volume all the way up, but still barely heard a thing. The video quality was excellent. The movie was garbage. It was marketed as an action packed thriller, but it wasn't. You can skip this one.

'Preciate it."
,libertaswv,2013-04-21T02:26Z,"Right on, ZoPunde (re tweety).

Thanks to juggs99 and all seeders and leechers - much appreciated!"
,Sharak,2013-04-21T03:55Z,"A9 V9 M5. Boring and overplayed theme. Watch it if you have nothing better to watch, but it won't end with you feeling like it was time well spent. "
,kabila97,2013-04-21T04:23Z,"Tweety2455 is right absolutely.  You ignorant fuckheads learn to count to 100 first then give your worthless thoughts about the film (not that anyone asked for it to begin with).
ZoPunde and your lovers,
Go fuck yourselves.  Comments should be kept only for the technical quality."
,kabila97,2013-04-21T04:26Z,"Tweety was absolutely right.  Keep the comments at a technical level only. No one's interested in your worthless opinions.
ZoPunde and your lovers (admirers),
Go fuck yourselves.  I got two more words for you: ""8 inches"".
Enjoy "

,PostTenebras,2013-04-23T03:20Z,"Haven't downloaded this yet, but to those arguing about comments on TPB, here is the basic format:

A:#/10
V:#/10
M:#/10

Down here goes any closing comments on either the audio, the video OR the movie itself. Yes, this is how we've been doing it on TPB for years, but I understand if some of you new-comers haven't been taught the routine yet. 

It's also polite to thank the uploader for their work. Now please go back to pirating and stop arguing with each other. If you haven't figured it out yet, persuasion never works if you sit there spouting profanities at other users. Try being courteous and logical: you'll go much farther. This applies to all of life as well.

For the file size, I'm confused why it looks so bad? Very pixilated for me on VLC.

Is no one else having this problem?"
