,Ahlat,2013-04-17T15:37Z,Thank you STFmaryville. I know most people (atleast the ones I've spoken to) haven't enjoyed Geoff Johns JL but I personally have.

I've found the book pretty enjoyable. Geoff Johns writes VERY decompressed storylines, and some feel six issues is too much to get a team together. I personally really liked the first six issues. It got its characterisation down pretty well, showed the team dynamic and really made it feel like the Justice League was needed due to the size of the threat.
Teen Titans is what I see as a bad team book. Very little of the  team dynamic is shown and the first storyline ends with a crossover that is so dull it hurts. Seriously, 10 issues in and the team hasn't truly formed yet. The arc fatigue is strong with that book. The Culling itself is just not necessary. Why make it some time travel story (other than for the crossover with Legion Lost, I guess, and even then it's not really necessary)? The villain is dull, the story drags on and on (what was the point of the dinosaur island-thing?) and the book overall just isn't FUN (3rd issue aside), which is what the Titans should be! I only just started reading from where I left off, completely ignoring The Culling. OH, and then I'm guessing it goes into ANOTHER crossover for Death of the Family. Yay...
Anyway, yeah, Justice League has been pretty hit or miss. I found Origin and Throne of Atlantis to be really enjoyable. Everything else is just... meh. Nothing special aside from maybe Graves, and even then that's giving Johns more credit than he deserves.
So, yeah. Just wanted to share my opinion on the book and vent my frustrations regarding Teen Titans."
