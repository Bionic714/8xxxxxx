,Ahlat,2013-04-17T15:44Z,Thanks for this STFmaryville. Really wish the WTF covers wouldnt have spoilers on them. =
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-17T15:52Z,"yeah i felt like they (meaning the creative teams) were rushed to do this, and it takes some thinking to do a good one without giving away too much."
,ImmaDLStf,2013-04-17T16:06Z,Thanks for the fast upload :)
,ImmaDLStf,2013-04-17T16:08Z,"@ahlat
Well, the cover does draw you in... until you see Simon. Then yeah, there be mad spoilers. I think. Haven't read it, but it does make me want to know how Simon became a White Lantern."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-17T16:52Z,well hey maybe it works then. i think that's def. the INTENT: draw in readers who don't usually buy a title
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-17T17:25Z,"hey Ahlat, you're almost internet famous! http://www.bleedingcool.com/2013/04/17/marvels-fcbd-infinity-gets-pirated/  LOL!"
