Jackie crafted the world as he saw fit. For the longest time, nobody noticed. As master of the shadows, he knows that he must operate outside of the spotlight if he wants to get what he truly wants. But there are those who know the unbalance Jackie caused. Witchblade bearer Sara Pezzini knows what Jackie stole from her and the time has come for her to make Jackie pay.
