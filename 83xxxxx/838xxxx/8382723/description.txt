Dutch Treat Sweetlists C044 and C045 are actually one. It is a special gift for two special persons. The list grew a bit long and kind of broke in two. Just like in real life.

They must know each other some interesting year now. By this special gift I can give them some deserved attention and share it with everybody at the same time.
Is it L-o-v-e, I Wonder.

Listening to some jazz my thoughts went their way and.... in this way I can give them real Love and I Wonder. Romantic jazz music for two, I guess they both like (when they take some time (off))..... With special thanks to Jamal the Moroccan.... Enjoy (Part One),
