,K1,2013-04-17T18:25Z,Will there be a version with HD sound? Remux or Full disk?
,chl2is,2013-04-18T00:12Z,Thank You for the UL! I also want to know if this is an HD sound? Or will you have one?
,magredana,2013-04-18T02:07Z,"Audio: DTS 1509k

How much HD did you want with your audio?!

Sometimes it pays to actually READ!"
,greasyHampster,2013-04-18T06:58Z,"Thanx for making it soooo easy to find the RIGHT torrent BOZX.. you owe me about 2T's now, with your outrageously large file sizes. ;)

,chl2is,2013-04-18T07:56Z,"@magredana, I read the Audio. What i would like to know is what is the difference between DTS 1509k, and DD 5.1.. Sorry but when it comes to all this, I'm not sure what it means."
,TheLathe,2013-04-18T09:52Z,"@Chi2is

Hmmm, I THINK what you are asking is what is the difference between the DTS here @1500 and FULL HD Audio, right?  In other words NOT DD 5.1 but you mean HD 5.1, right?

IF that is so, then the DTS is the 'core' of the HD Audio and it is almost always @1500.  Whereas FULL HD Audio is completely LOSSLESS and not compressed at all, say like Dolby 5.1 @640.  HD Audio tracks vary with different releases, but usually I think they can be anywhere around @3000-4000.  For example in a normal 2 hour movie the DTS track would take up maybe 1 Gig or so.  Whereas the full HD track could take up 3-4 Gigs, thus the LOSSLESS quality. 

But, with all that said, usually the DTS is quite good and MUCH MUCH better than what you normally would find on a DVD which would be Dolby @364-640 or so.

I hope that helps..."

,trishya,2013-04-18T17:02Z,great educating comments re sound formats and filesizes. my amp decodes the very conservative losssy stereo and it never sounds as good as 5.1 anything. I always went for bigger file size in general. thank you TheLathe. and uploader of course.

Your probably one of the retards that download 1080p movie with stereo sound right? 
Why bother with HD movies if your gona settle for 2 channel audio MP3 crap sound? just so you can have a much lower file size? 
There is nothing wrong with the picture btw so you have no clue my friend!"

This print is not for poor guys with 40 inch screens! This works great for 120"" screen with projector and authentic 5.1 setup."
,thereisnoother,2013-04-26T05:15Z,"I must say I am let down on this one. Watched it (tried to) on my Sharp 80"" and it looked like 720P at best. Unwatchable. "
,thepirateperez,2013-04-28T00:33Z,Thanks! Seeding!
,whisperingdeath,2013-04-28T02:42Z,"@TheLathe and cl2is:

TheLathe - nice try but you are a bit confused, and you've confused some people here too. The main difference between DTS 5.1 and DD 5.1 is the bitrate. Bitrate is how much information in the track is being delivered per second. DTS is over TWICE the bitrate that DD (Dolby Digital) is, 1500kbps vs 640kbps. DD 5.1 is therefore AUDIBLY INFERIOR because it is lower bitrate. So always look for DTS 5.1 tracks, they sound noticeably cleaner, surround sounds better, bass is tighter too."
