Subs Eng Hi : http://subscene.com/subtitles/jack-reacher/english/717513"
,mr2old,2013-04-19T13:22Z,Why would an English movie need English subs ?
,Extremist,2013-04-19T19:36Z,Because not everybody is fluent in English and find subs very helpful!
,EyezGl,2013-04-20T03:32Z,"mr2old: SOUND. That's it. I personally fucking hate watching movies w/o eng. subs these days as the producers no longer know how to seperate regular speach levels from the sound effects in say, explotions or anything else that is usually higher in sound. To be able to hear the speaking you have to have such a volume that the house is brought down when the sound effects come on. That's just fucking retarded but that's how it is. "
,blackrebelmotorcycleclub,2013-04-20T22:23Z,"Obviously EyezGl has a shitty home theater setup, which explains his inability to discern the dialog. Don't blame the ""producers,"" which btw have nothing to do with the editing aspect, for your poor listening skills newb."
,upskirthq,2013-04-21T00:35Z,Good rip by Amiable V/10 A/10 M/8 Thanks people
,Revenge2269,2013-04-21T07:43Z,"I agree with you 100% EyezGl, no idea what the other guy is talking about. I am always complaining to my wife that they actually had to PAY someone to decide ""Yeah, turn the volume level up 300% whenever doors open and bombs go off."" It always wakes my son up so I have to use subtitles and keep the volume low."
,jp_pt,2013-04-24T00:17Z,Subs in english are very helpful for those that translate and make non-english subs.
,Tinna_30,2013-04-27T17:57Z,Thanks!
,Ogdin,2013-05-01T22:11Z,"EyezGl and mr2old,turn on night mode on your recievers. It normalizes the sound and won't wake up the munckins."
,village1diot,2013-05-10T07:10Z,"@extremist!  If someone wasn't fluent in English, wouldn't they want subs in their spoken language? I'm fairly certain that is not a reason for someone needing english subs.

lol."
