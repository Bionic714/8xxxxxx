Once the Wednesday release rush finishes, I was hoping you might take another couple of requests.  I'm trying to fill in some holes in my collection of completed runs:

I noticed you had Aspen's Soulfire Vol 1 trade in your latest batch (thanks for all of those, too!), but was wondering if you had a full set of Soulfire v3, which I can't locate.

Also, Mr Downtown had a torrent of Oni Press' Resurrection v2, but it isn't being seeded, and he hasn't been around in about a month, so if you happen to have the full Resurrection v2, a new up and/or seeding the existing torrent would be mighty handy. 

And, if asking one more isn't too much, There doesn't seem to be a torrent of Stitched 8, 9, or 10 anywhere. Thanks again!"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-17T18:48Z,"sounds good to me. the thing about soulfire, i had downloaded that, and i went to comixology because it was confusing me -- i think it was the only release they've done for any volumes of that series. (so it may be hard to find v3, but i'll try.)

stitched is the same story, i downloaded 11 and 12 the other day, but like you've noticed, there are a few missing in the middle.

but yeah sure, i'll look tomorrow or the next day, time permitting."
,dannyxt0,2013-04-18T00:58Z,"Hey STFmaryville, is there any chance you have Outsiders V3?"
,shamelesspunk247,2013-04-18T03:58Z,i downloaded this to 2 laptops and they both have error.anyone else have trouble with this one?
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-18T04:28Z,"what's the error? it works fine for me, but then again, TPB uploading has been wacky today..."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-18T04:39Z,"dannyxt0, you can grab Outsiders v3 from this torrent:

,ZombieHero,2013-04-18T08:26Z,"This is really Awesome! Thank you very much!

But Could I make a request please. Could you please upload Red hood and The Outlaws #18 I cant find it anywhere. Thank you very much!"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-18T20:22Z,"ZombieHero, it's right here. the uploader simply forgot the issue number."

,ZombieHero,2013-04-18T23:22Z,"Oh, thank you very very much. I didnt trust it at first because I had no idea which it would be."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-19T03:22Z,"no problem. if you look at the ""Files:   "" line item at the top of a torrent page here on TPB, you can click the number (""1"", in this case). i did that and saw the issue # in the actual file name. hope this helps!"
