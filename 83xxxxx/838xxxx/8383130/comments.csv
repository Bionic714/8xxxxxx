,tdurden83,2013-04-17T20:37Z,thanks. is this series really as good as I've heard?
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-17T21:34Z,"it depends on your tastes (pun intended). i think i'm lucky because i only started reading it last year, and i started from #1. 

it has changed over the run from more of a straight-up police procedural story with sci-fi elements to more comedy and running jokes and layman (writer) really lets guillory (artist) go crazy and fill it with sight gags. which is either great or distracting, depending on your tastes...

i recommend it definitely, it's on my top 10 right now for sure. but i think i'd try reading the first trade paperback before anything else."

,tdurden83,2013-04-18T02:50Z,"thanks for the input, i'll have to check it out. I've got the series collected, just haven't tried it yet. I actually even have a hard copy of the first trade. long story short... I was buying a lot of used reading copies of trades for awhile, and a couple slipped through the cracks. I've seen it on some lists of best current ongoings too. "
