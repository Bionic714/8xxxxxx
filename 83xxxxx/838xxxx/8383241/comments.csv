Do you have EU Wales and USA/CA Southern Alaska?"
[T],_SnakEye,2013-04-17T18:54Z,"@B737NG , what is your point exactly? "
,namco-nexgen,2013-04-17T19:02Z,"I couldn't care less about the crack, i'm serving this for the community and i guess even a RIP would leave most people happy.

Thanks for doing nothing."
,jdpeen,2013-04-17T19:08Z,"Geez considering Namcos past contributions, why would you even question his motives for this post. Nobody else has posted these and he helps the community by getting it out there. Im sure he would prefer you just say thanks and move along..

So, thanks Namco.  Surprised Orbx has turned about on their position to not copy protect. Someone will break it."
,tornade25,2013-04-17T22:13Z,"Thank you namco-nexgen
request Kamchatka X v1.10, if possible with installer"
,bournejsnm,2013-04-18T05:45Z,"Thanks Namco, @ B737ng, concurring with ""snakeye"" you're a moron.
A polite request for anyone with a copy of Virtavia - A4 skyhawk and/or HU-16 Albatross
Thanks"
,meddraw,2013-04-18T05:57Z,"Yes, thanks from me, too! for all your efforts.....appreciated!"
,namco-nexgen,2013-04-18T17:32Z,Thanks. I have Wales and the Alaska ready if someone wants to have a go at it.
,deltonos,2013-04-18T17:36Z,"@namco-nexgen : yes, please, alaska!!! :-)~~"
,RossM236,2013-04-18T17:56Z,"What is the type of crack that is on them, like PMDG sort of DLL, or serial? I think rips would be fine anyway - just add the files to the ORBX folder and you would be able to load them through FTX Central anyway :)"
,namco-nexgen,2013-04-18T18:15Z,It's some sort of check after getting rid of the first wrapper. Maybe the first wrapper generates some file or decrypts part of the executable. Either way i don't have the time to learn to use IdaPRO at this time.
,fenriz747,2013-04-18T18:35Z,"That protection looks like special fature of flightsim store. Anyway, thank you Namco for your work to TPB. Please keep your good work. I'm still waiting for Wales and Alaska :)"
[T],_SnakEye,2013-04-18T20:09Z,"Namco, if you can send me (or post here) Wales and Alaska, I'll try and give it a shot cracking it."
,fenriz747,2013-04-18T20:48Z,@SnakEye you mean cracking that Aerodromes or Wales and Alasca need crack too ? (i don't think so)
,Cauan,2013-04-18T21:38Z,Will be nice to see wales and alaska.
,RossM236,2013-04-18T21:50Z,"Hmmmm, it sounds like it would be simple to get rid of through simple cracking with IDA etc. I am no expert though :P
SnakEye will probably have it done shortly if he takes a look at it. "
,aarque,2013-04-19T07:54Z,"Don't anybody buy this crap. The worst thing we can do is show them the piracy junk works. 737NG is completely off the mark. Picture a shady character in a trench coat, shifty eyes - ""Hey, Mr ORBX, I can stop all your piracy losses with my 'wrapper,' but you got to pay me for 'protection'.""

 Right now, ORBX is weighing the expense and inconvenience of a wrapper against expected sales - and they don't have squat to do with the nature of the protection, or ""increase her,"" except to maybe select the super nuclear package when they sign up with Flight1 (or whichever pusher).

If you do have to buy the stuff, be sure to get on the forums and make a lot of noise about how inconvenient the wrapper is and how it prevented you from attending the family reunion fly-in because tech support could not unwrap it at 2 am Australia time and how you will get on the enthusiast sites and write posts about how ORBX has gone all paranoid and to the dogs...

Can't believe they took the plunge. It's fear mongering, straight up. Seriously, you look at the seeders of the most popular torrents here. What do we get, 200 maybe? I see 40 tops right now, but SnakEye isn't doing his binges. Anyway, the point is, there is NO WAY what we do here affects the bottom line. In fact, they won't even recover in sales, what they spent on the security that will supposedly make people buy. That's why all the security vendors are the true parasites. They go to the conventions, they chum up to the developers and start whispering in their ear, ""lost profits!"" they coo softly, ""your customers will welcome the added hassle, knowing you are spending their investment wisely."" Once these customers get past the clear implication that they are not trusted, that is."
,atlas81,2013-04-19T11:03Z,"There is a Flight1 unwrapper available with Reality XP weather radar torrent -- http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/3722454/FS2004_-_Reality_XP_Weather_Radar_for_PMDG737
"
,RossM236,2013-04-19T21:46Z,I was wondering if you had the Orbx Tweak Launcher namco? Been looking for it for a while.
,kingashi,2013-04-22T08:43Z,"@ aarque

Then do something about it....dont just sit..."
