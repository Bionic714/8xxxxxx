DLGuard will provide you with the purchase link you need, and a small snippet of code you use to integrate your payment processor with your website.

DLGuard allows you to easily offer bonus products for secure download after purchasing your main product through it's unique bonus download feature.

New products can be set up in minutes!


DLGuard has it's own built in shopping cart!



Your customers will be able to select which items they'd like to purchase, and then make one single payment. They will then be transferred to a secure download area where they will see all the products they purchased on the one page.

The shopping cart and the download page can be fully customised. DLGuard uses a template system for ease of modification, and to make sure the system blends into your existing webpage design.



Paid (Recurring) Memberships:
DLGuard makes it quick and easy to set up PayPal, Clickbank, or Linkpoint memberships payments. No need to create button code, DLGuard will do all that for you.


Single Sale Memberships:
DLGuard allows you to create a members area for people who buy your single sale products. Offer your customers a secure area to download updates, run polls, keep up to date with news and new offers, and more.

 

With both types of memberships, DLGuard allows you to display secure download links to your customers, as well as limit the number of times they try and download products within your member area.

The membership site is completely flexible. You simply add a small snippet of PHP code to your existing webpages, and they become automatically protected.

The same method can be used to easily protect blogs and forums - simply place the DLGuard member code into your blog or forum's header template.


Download link sharing:
We've had people come to us for a solution because their download link or download page URL has been posted on a forum and they've just lost hundreds of dollars in lost sales.
DLGuard prevents this.

Each download link can have a expiring time limit as well as a maximum number of download attempts.

This means that you can give your customer, for example, 2 hours to download your product with a maximum of 3 download attempts. Even if your customer posted their own real download link on a public forum, the link would become useless before real damage is done.
