"[i]Nashville Skyline[/i] contained a number of striking songs, notably the great ballad "Lay Lady lay", and a charming duet on the early "Girl from the North Country" With Johnny Cash. But in general the album succumbed quickly to the vices of country Music, its central idiom, without much awareness of C&W's strenghts. ***

"So here he is, folks, Homebody Bob, singin' ten songs for your listenin' pleasure--well, nine, really, one is a hoedown sort o' thing. Everyone knows by now, I hope, how intense that pleasure is."
