,123457,2013-04-21T02:10Z,"YIFY: While the videos you upload do meet the standard technical defintions of HD, which is primarily resolution oriented, you DO NOT provide the bit rate to take advantage of the resolution your videos are coded in and to show the detail that the HD definition was meant to.

Your videos provide the detail more akin to a DVD or SD release rather than that of a BD or HD video encoded with a respectable bit rate.

Please stop posting your videos in the HD section. They do not meet the standards of many people browsing this section. Your flooding this section with sub-'HD' releases and making it very annoying/difficult for people looking for actual 'HD' releases.

,111me222,2013-04-22T08:30Z,"@ mgman770 and all other whingers

yify's movies are more hd than dvd rips so they are hd 

by the way 

search - 'movie name -yify'

not hard"
,J3rryKo42O,2013-04-22T17:50Z,"Blind people think his releases are HD 

go download BOZX's HD release of this and try and tell me there isnt a difference 

lmao theres a reason yify doesnt show the bit rate on his releases ;)"
,moeburn1,2013-04-22T21:01Z,"1.1gb for a 2 hour movie in 720p?  Yify, WTF?  1GB is standard for 2 hours of 480p!  Your codec bitrate is set so low that compression artifacts made these HD releases look like SD ones!

Please at LEAST use 2-3Mbps for 720p releases, otherwise you may as well be uploading high bitrate SD movies.  Although I do understand WHY you do it, because very few downloaders actually understand what bitrate is, and people often just go for the video with the lowest file size.  People will learn..."
[V],manOtor,2013-04-22T23:41Z,"Guys, maybe everyone should calm down and take a step back here.

Though I'm not a fan of YIFI's rips myself (but mainly because of the audio, a bit too low volume for my taste - at least in the early releases), I don't see a problem with YIFI posting in HD.
The quality of the Rips is clearly higher than DVD.

Maybe they don't bring the full possible quality they could, but a lot of people seem to enjoy them, because they get a higher than DVD quality in a reasonable size.
If you have to argue about bitrate, do that on a private tracker, there people might actually care about it.

And this here is just utter BS:
""Your flooding this section with sub-'HD' releases and making it very annoying/difficult for people looking for actual 'HD' releases.""
WTF man? All Rips are clearly labeled ""YIFI"". Just skip 'em and move on if you're looking for higher quality.

This one I'll grab, thx YIFI :P!"
,Rizzo220,2013-04-23T01:20Z,"Fuck the complainers!!! lol
Cheers YIFI!"
,bdoggonewild,2013-04-23T03:43Z,i have downloaded Yify movies and compared them to bigger file downloads and can't tell a bit of difference.don't know why people say these aren't HD.maybe the audio isn't as good as a bigger file but i don't care.i just crank up the volume.
,Typhos,2013-04-23T06:21Z,Thanks!
,chachiola,2013-04-24T08:17Z,you know what the problem is in today's world...to many fucken whingers download the movie WATCH IT and shut the fuck up...thanks YIFY
,1apolon1,2013-04-25T00:00Z,"For good quality check out this *** Brownsugar13*** all  uploads 1080p DD5.1
much better than  -YIFY- where u have to turn all volume up and u cant hear nothing...."
,mrwolf71,2013-04-25T00:13Z,"If any of you nit-picking jack-asses dont like YIFY's uploads... as for you money back!

In the meantime, learn how to use TPB search fucntions as quit bitching. YOU are flooding the comment sections with your ridiculous complaints when people here just want an A/V rating. "
,Shadow416,2013-04-25T05:53Z,"although i got the 1080p version from yify, i feel it necessary to say

fuck you people who complain about Yify team's rips...

The picture quality is great, especially when I watch it on my big screen, yes there are sometimes blackness or whatever the technical term is called but its not even close to being an issue that it would stop your enjoyment of the movie.


If you people are so fed up, go buy the damn movies you wanna watch so bad or go watch Public's releases.


I as im sure many others, prefer YIFY because small file size while providing video quality of about 8/9.

Audio, well i use my Sony Pulse Headsets so I don't have a problem with audio, it infact sounds outstanding on my headsets

but if i didn't use my headset audio would be about a 6 at the most---then again, idc, cuz i have alternatives I made the effort to get these Headphones so i could watch these releases and enjoy them better, and if i like them I go out and buy them.

And I'm 100% sure that a majority of you don't bother to buy the product you like after you've watched/tried it."

,fuktastik,2013-04-26T06:21Z,"Thanks for all the great mp4 work YIFY .
If you compare them to the avi xvid files I was downloading before I figured out how to update my xbox to play x264 format, obviously looks better on my T.V. with smaller file size for same pixel count. And for that I thank you. But my surround sound and my dog aren't loving the audio quality. I'll try not to whine and bitch since I have nothing to contribute like some of these assholes. But I have to repectfully beg for future releases to be 5.1 or at least a higher bit rate? I don't know all the tech shit but if you can it would be appreciated. Also Jack Reacher Kicked Ass. The A/V was typical for YIFY. 
V=10
A=7.0  
M=8.0
Want to hate Tom but MI4GP and this both entertained. Cant wait for Oblivion. Either way Ill be downloading from YIFY until something better comes along."
,greenwheel,2013-04-27T02:35Z,Bitrate is too low for any of this uploaders movies to be considered TRUE HD. Cut and dry. To see the difference simply download the same movie release by BOZX or other reputable HD uploaders and play them side by side. Or one after the other if your computer sucks. You'll see a clear difference in quality.
