Shelly Manne - 1972 - Mannekind (MFSL)

One of the least interesting groups that drummer Shelly Manne led can be heard on this long out-of-print Mainstream LP. Manne tried hard to keep his mind open to the avant-garde and free jazz during this era but his septet (comprised of trumpeter Gary Barone, John Gross on tenor, pianist Mike Wofford, guitarist John Morell, bassist Jeffry Castleman and percussionist Brian Moffatt) only had one distinctive soloist (Wofford) and the group originals (by Wofford and Morell) are uncomfortable and immediately forgettable. Despite a few good solos, this is one of the weaker Shelly Manne albums. (Scott Yanow)
