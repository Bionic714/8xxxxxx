It seems like the torrent "Esoteric and Occult Library (VA_ATS)" by VA_ATS will no longer be the largest. (It is dead anyway)
I have more than 300GB and I will be uploading in large chunks. Please note that some sections are not full leaks from TO.bz, but only content that is interesting to me. So don't get disappointed!

I decided that this torrent would be called Qabalah as requested by keter7, and for his kind words on my first torrent. Cheers!

If you mess with your user base then your user base will own your torrent base. LOL!!!!

All I want from you guys in exchange is to just seed and be patient! I really cannot force you to seed but at the same time, I can't be seeding all my occult releases because my upload speed sucks big time. Even if I had seedbox, it would take ages to transfer the torrents to the seedbox so I can seed it from there. So do me the favor.. Seed!!!

Check out my other torrents:
Grimoires: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8325121/
Ritual Magic: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8351478/

If you guys have trouble downloading the Grimoires torrent, then just reply here. I might reupload it IF I don't manage to re-download my deleted RAR.

I guess my next RAR would be Satanism & Left-Hand Path. Ave Satani!!!

All your torrent base are belong to us!!!
Saludos to the true occultists the Illuminati! You don't become illuminated by just being a powerless conspiracy theorist.
