What lurks beneath the surface of PLANET DEATH?

Aric of Dacia has taken his one-man war to the Vine's homeworld, Loam, and is using their own X-O Manowar armor to wage it. Finding an ally in the unlikeliest of places, Aric will discover that his mission to reduce Loam to ash will come with a high price. Past, present, and future are about to collide, and if Aric isn't careful, he will be the common thread that undoes them all.
