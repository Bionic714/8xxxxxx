I've been looking for the biggest rip available because i don't want to watch this any time soon. 10 GB should take a few days to download. I hate those little 700MB rips that you can download in an hour because they are only 98% the quality of a big fat rip like this. Thanks, you morons."

If people want a high video quality and have the bandwith to download it, aint that good? Is that something to badmouth? You, you are the moron here."
