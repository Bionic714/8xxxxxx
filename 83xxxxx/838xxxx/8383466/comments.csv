Between classics and recent titles, thank you very much for your releases, they have been a breath of fresh air.

Can I make some personal suggestions? This are some of the movies that I´ve been looking for quite some time on DVD:

High Sierra (1941, Raoul Walsh)
Mrs. Miniver (1942, William Wyler)
The Search (1946, Fred Zinnemann)
Red River (1949, John Ford)
The Window (1949, Ted Tetzlaff)
The Prisoner (1955, Peter Glenville) 
Gigi (1958, Vincente Minnelli)
Father of a Soldier (1958, Rezo Chkheidze)
Charade (1963, Stanley Donen)
Taps (1981, Harold Becker)
Kingdom of Heaven (2005, Ridley Scott) (4 disc director´s cut) 

And if you have any requests, I´ll be happy to see if I can help. Again, thank´s for the work, you have been a tremendous help to movie enthusiasts like myself. "
