official title: The Report of The Constitution Project's Task Force on Detainee Treatment (The Constitution Project, 2013). 601 pages.



This report was released on Monday, but risks getting lost in the news of the Boston bombings. I figured it might be useful to have it here. This version was downloaded from the Constitution Project website. The downloaded copy was 53 mb; I've reduced it to 3.5 mb but have made no other changes.

The New York Times begins its article describing the report this way:

A nonpartisan, independent review of interrogation and detention programs in the years after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks concludes that "it is indisputable that the United States engaged in the practice of torture" and that the nationΓÇÖs highest officials bore ultimate responsibility for it.

The sweeping, 577-page report says that while brutality has occurred in every American war, there never before had been "the kind of considered and detailed discussions that occurred after 9/11 directly involving a president and his top advisers on the wisdom, propriety and legality of inflicting pain and torment on some detainees in our custody."
