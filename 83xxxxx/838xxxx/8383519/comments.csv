[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-18T02:45Z,"lol i remember as a kid i once refused to leave the electronics section of a department store because i was watching he-man on the wall of television sets...

the major difference is that in 2013, teela is dressing like a huge ho!"
,ScottyD7421,2013-04-18T02:47Z,What i remember about He-Man is Dolph Lundgren and She-Ra......OMG i am soooooo old :-)

,podU,2013-04-18T17:08Z,thanks STFmaryville for sharing this comic book....really brings out some nostalgia....
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-18T20:19Z,you're welcome podU
,hotdogger83,2013-04-19T23:38Z,"Thanks! I'm confused though, as last year also, they released this same title and I have issues 1-6. So they rebooted the series again this year?"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-20T13:16Z,"yeah, last year's series was always going to be a 6-issue miniseries. this is meant to be an ongoing series, although if it lasts 6 issues or more... that's anyone's guess.

if you missed it, you should also grab the 8-issue MotU digital exclusive comic that came out last year. it was also written by giffen and featured adora (as an agent of hordak), as does this series."
,hotdogger83,2013-04-20T17:11Z,"I see. Glad they decided to start a regular series with it. And yes, I did get the MOTU series last year too."
