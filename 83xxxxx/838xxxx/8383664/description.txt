I wish someone could send a message to the KAT Staff for me as my account is not working properly, I cannot accept new friends I have 3 waiting at the moment and no matter how many times I accept them it doesn't work I also cannot pm anyone to tell them as that doesn't seem to work and I cannot post on community to the help section and I am getting very upset about it this might be the only way of getting a message to them
