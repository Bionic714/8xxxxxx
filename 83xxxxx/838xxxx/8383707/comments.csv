,Robinwood_13,2013-04-17T21:15Z,"it's only the track ""Get Lucky""

PROPER sound"
,rafeno,2013-04-18T03:50Z,i think its legit. it has new verses and it sounds great. although..someone said..that wikipedia said..its 6 minutes while this song plays out at 4 min
,RaulGtzz,2013-04-18T05:26Z,"Thanks man, great quality.
@rafeno this is the radio edit, the only version that has been leaked."
,MrBoob89,2013-04-20T17:26Z,"I'd be careful downloading from this account.. Robinwood_13 only has 2 uploads: the new MGMT single and the new Daft Punk single, both artists of which are on the Columbia label. Just sayin"
,s1raz1,2013-04-23T19:50Z,"@parcolan
Album comes in may, i think by the 20th or near that date"
