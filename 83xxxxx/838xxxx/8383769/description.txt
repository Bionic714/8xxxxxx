""Oh Very Young" is a lovely, simple melody, the vaguest song here and one of the most appealing. "Ghost Town" sounds like high adrenaline Neil Young, and if you nod along to Gerry Conway's drums as feverishly as Cat himself would, you may not even notice lyrics that drop the names of Anne Boleyn, Houdini, Bill Bailey, Buster Keaton and King Tut. All of the album is beautifully performed, but parts of it are overproduced. Cat needs a dozen good songs a lot more than he needs a dozen background singers right now." ***1/2

"In "Music," for example, Cat tells us there wouldn't be any "wars in the world/If everybody joined in the band." This kind of lie is called a tautology; it's like saying there wouldn't be any hunger if everyone became an ice cream man. And makes you wonder why a guy who loves trees so much (reference: "King of Trees") designed a double-fold cover With cardboard inner sleeve for this unlovable single LP." C-
