,chl2is,2013-04-18T00:23Z,Thanx for the Upload NLU002.. Im curious to know the difference between the audio DD5.1 and DTS at 1 509kbps 6 channels? Is either one better than other?

If You are asking the difference between the 2 Audio tracks HERE on this post then the DTS @1500 is far superiour to the Dolby AC3 @640"
,brbear,2013-04-18T12:55Z,"Would love to see a full BD, if possible."
,chl2is,2013-04-18T19:41Z,"@TheLathe
Thank You for your comment and the knowledge. I would like to know what would be the best audio DTS or DD? You did say DTS was far better than AC-3. I also have seen where they have DD, whatever audio that is. But as far as audio what is to your preference of yours?"
,TheLathe,2013-04-18T20:09Z,"You can never go wrong going for the DTS; usually it will be at the full 1500 core from the HD.  Sometimes, like High Code, they will bring it down to 785, but it is still much superior than any other Lossy format.

DD...  Here is an article that should explain it:
