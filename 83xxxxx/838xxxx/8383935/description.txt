I really wish I would have heard this album last year, as it absolutely would have appeared on my year end lists. That said, the title is pretty much a black and white declaration of what this album is about. People, lovers and wives all find their final breaths at some point in the 11 tracks that make up Murder Ballads & Other Love Songs, and itΓÇÖs all done to a high-lonesome guitar & mandolin soundtrack.

The album was recorded and mixed in Toronto by Laurence Currie (Amelia Curran/Wintersleep/The Once), and features Canadian talents including Andrew Collins (Creaking Tree String Quartet, The Foggy Hogtown Boys), Max Heineman (The Foggy Hogtown Boys), Christine Bougie (The Good Lovelies, Amy Millan), and Brad Kilpatrick (Hawksley Workman), among others.Steeped in tradition, and raised on a healthy diet of ΓÇ£the old countryΓÇ¥, The Heavy Horses are naturally drawn to writing in the same style of music, and make no excuses for it. Although they have never raised a pistol to a man, fled to Mexico, murdered out of love, anger, or murdered ΓÇ£just to watch him dieΓÇ¥ as Johnny Cash once put it, these themes are abundant in the writing.

Trust me on this. Stop reading, start listening and know that The Heavy Horses will never slip below my radar again.

Steeped in tradition, and raised on a healthy diet of "the old country", The Heavy Horses are naturally drawn to writing in the same style of music, and make no excuses for it. Although they have never raised a pistol to a man, fled to Mexico, murdered out of love, anger, or murdered "just to watch him die" as Johnny Cash once put it, these themes are abundant in the writing.
