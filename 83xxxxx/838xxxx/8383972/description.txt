"Paul Simon, the first LP, set the stage for his growth: it is rougher and more expansive that any of the Simon & Garfunkle recordings, with several quirky reggae numbers made in jamaica and a sense of lost innocence that says much about the necessity for the groups demise." *****
- Dave Marsh, Rolling Stone

"I've been saying nasty things about Simon since 1967, but this is the only thing in the universe to make me positively happy in the first two weeks of February 1972. I hope Art Garfunkel is gone for good--he always seemed so vestigial, but it's obvious now that two-part harmony crippled Simon's naturally agile singing and composing. And the words! This is a Professional tour of Manhattan for youth culture grads, complete with Bella Abzug, hard rain, and people who steal your chow fong." A+
