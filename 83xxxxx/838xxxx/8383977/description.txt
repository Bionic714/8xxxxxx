"Desire, much more ambitious in scope, lacks only a great band. With love songs like "Sara", such topical numbers as "Hurricane", and Joey (about the imprisoned boxer Rubin "Hurrican" Carter and gangster Joey Gallo, respectively, and simple rockers like the ironic "Mozambique, it could have been a masterpiece" ****

"In the great tradition of Grand Funk Railroad, Dylan has made an album beloved by tour devotees--including those who were shut out of Rolling Thunder's pseudocommunitarian grooviness except via the press. It is not beloved by me. Although the candid propaganda and wily musicality of "Hurricane" delighted me for a long time, the deceitful bathos of its companion piece, "Joey," tempts me to question the unsullied innocence of Rubin Carter himself."
