GROUP NOTES:
- We had to take a leave of absense for awhile as we were unable to be consistent with our shares are we have been in previous years. We are back now, WITH internals added to our share per many requests and glad to see all those that missed us and welcome us back!

  ** We always try to avoid DUPES or NUKES of any kind, but if an error occurs, best we can say is STUFF HAPPENS! **



GREETS
