,TheLathe,2013-04-18T10:05Z,"Heh HOLY SHITE HighCode, a FULL Blu-ray...?!!!

DAMN dude, you B smok'n some GOOOOD crack mate!  : )

I bet you didn't do your ol' DTS@778 this time, huh...? (Heh, couldn't help it  : )

You just keep getting better and better my friend

THANKS and much respect!!!!!

@Python@ss

If you don't appreciate Top Quality, then please kindly keep your fetid cakehole SHUT and go and download .BONE.s of YIFFY's  low-grade SHITE!"
,TheLathe,2013-04-27T08:03Z,"Hey HighCode, may I ask please what is your opinion of this Blu-ray as far as Picture Quality and such?  I'm not sure if I should keep it as a full BR (if the quality is really sharp) or if I should bring it down to a BD9.

Thanks man!"
[V],HighCode,2013-04-30T15:28Z,"Picture quality is very poor. I just started encoding it to 1080p, although 720p would be probably the same result. It looks like an average DVD. No user reviews yet on bluray.com because release date was just a week ago, but I'm sure many buyers will be very pissed lol. Keeping the full BD is surely a waste."

In June will be released the UK BD but I doubt it will look any better."
,TheLathe,2013-04-30T20:21Z,"Geez, that's too bad...

Thanks man for taking the time to let me know what you think.

Cheers!"
