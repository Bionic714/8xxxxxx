It appears that this version was ripped from Comixology, and for some reason it is missing page 10! That issue is being fixed on the official version, but I hate to think that people here are getting the story missing a very important page! See the page at this link here:

The missing page is the last one shown. It would be the 10th page of the file. It's a VERY important splash page, so please get the full story! Check it out!"
