Agent Cole Fletcher lives for his job at the FBI, and heΓÇÖs more than ready for his next assignmentΓÇöraiding a cult compound and putting their leader behind bars. But he isnΓÇÖt prepared for Savannah and her knock you on your ass good looks. At nineteen, sheΓÇÖs too old for foster care and too damaged to live on her own. With nowhere else to go, and against his better judgment Cole takes her in. 

But helping her out wonΓÇÖt be easy. He comforts her through screaming nightmares and escaping the lingering fears of her past, but thatΓÇÖs the easy part. Her preference to sleep cuddled up next to his warm body, and her desire to please him in every way makes her harder and harder to resist.
