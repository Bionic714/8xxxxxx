,riverchase,2013-04-18T00:28Z,This is just s  personal question. I used to be able to help all the wonderful by rating them and helping them get skulls. i no longer have that option. how do I encourage everyone who brings these wonderful uploads for all their hard work using thepiratebay site? 
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-18T00:37Z,"yeah i kinda miss the ratings too, but maybe as the site has gotten bigger they were slowing down page loads?

anyway, just say thanks whenever you have time. but the best thanks is when you seed files so others can get them a week, a month or a year from now!"
,Torrenad000,2013-04-18T21:37Z,"They got rid of the ratings system because a lot of people were rating good torrents down for no reason, or they worked for a company who are against pirating and were paid to rate down torrents or write comments saying they were fake. As usual a few idiots ruined it for everyone else. Anyway thanks for the upload!"
