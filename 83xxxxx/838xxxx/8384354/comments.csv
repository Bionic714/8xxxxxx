,nsj7762,2013-04-18T02:14Z,Thanks again TIFY! Keep up the excellent work.
,virtueso,2013-04-18T05:09Z,"Hey man, is the audio codec in any of these rips dolby digital? Or dts?
The visuals are always amazing of your uploads but i dont get the best performance out of audio on my home theater.. 
Thanks"
,Viciously,2013-04-18T07:13Z,"Thanks.

^ Only a retard asks such a fucking stupid question. So dont let anyone tell you otherwise, that you are not a retard."
,nginx,2013-04-18T07:57Z,Thanks YIFY. These new rips are a massive improvement over your past encodes.
,muzwakai,2013-04-18T11:32Z,"lol, viciously it would have been quicker for you to just answer the question.
i think they are just stereo usually, i dont notice the difference as i use stereo speakers on the smart tv, played through the LAN off my laptop"
,virtueso,2013-04-18T11:42Z,"Viciously, if you dont want to help, kindly fuck off. Was a simple question, can be answered without being a douchebag, but perhaps that is an alien concept to you. Not being a douchebag"
,CrysisHawk,2013-04-18T12:06Z,Thanks :D
,Bunstuff,2013-04-18T12:47Z,"@virtueso:

,Shadow416,2013-04-18T19:39Z,"@Virtueso 

Simply put, the audio is made for Headphones. Otherwise playing through tv speakers, or surround sound system will require to blast the audio during speech and immediately lower it during action scenes (cuz it gets fucking loud lol).

That's pretty much what it comes down to.

I use my Sony Pulse Headset to watch off of my TV, so fucking awesome."
,jitzrulez,2013-04-18T21:29Z,wished YIFY gave 5.1 channel :(
,virtueso,2013-04-19T03:34Z,"@shadow416  thanks,that helps.

@jitz yea man that would be so awesome ..! even under 4gb,if he did 1080p with ac3 6channel, it wouldbe awesome.

Anyways, thanks for the up yify!"
,HKCannibal,2013-04-19T03:53Z,Thanks a lot YIFY!
,typ050212,2013-04-19T12:19Z,Normally YIFY torrents are good but this time the audio is too soft.  You really need to turn up the volume control to hear the audio during quiet moments. A-3 V-10.
,killerslot,2013-04-19T13:40Z,"Awesome!

,sagtion,2013-04-19T15:13Z,Hi there. I was just wondering why some of your uploads are a different aspect ration to others? Some are 16:9 which is perfect for TVs but most are 21:9
,mantikor777,2013-04-19T19:11Z,Sorry YIFY - audio SUCKS on this one.
,war59312,2013-04-19T23:36Z,"Audio is always stereo because that is what the specs call for. ;)

Why? To be as compliant with as many hardware devices as possible.

For example, the XboX 360 can NOT play 5.1 audio when using x264 with MP4. Many other devices only support stereo today as well. Sadly!

That is the main reason why it's stereo sound in these rips.

If you want 5.1 audio and higher quality audio at that, then you should stick with the full Blu-ray rips."
,excelguy,2013-04-20T21:47Z,YIFI please stop uploading in the HD-department. It's for HD-movies only!1
,Brahj,2013-04-20T23:27Z,"YIFY's torrents like this one here are like expecting to get a gourmet meal out of drive thru happy meal, it's just not gonna happen.  

Okay lol that may not make any sense but the audio is always to fucking quiet, i understand the small size is nice but i want HD audio with my stunning picture quality, sorry YIFY I am not downloading this one just so I have to crank the volume all the way up on my TV and it is still not loud enough, the dialog that is, and i have to turn it down during action scenes FFS YIFY is a clean uploader but is quality ain't all that it's cracked up to be.  I don't listen to these movies with headphones, and I know alot people complain about YIFY's audio, i'm fucking done with this guy's uploads, if I have to move up to 3 or 4 gb files for 1080p BRRip's with at least 5.1 channel sound so be it.  FFS."
,wasimdon,2013-04-22T14:53Z,so the king does it again .... ty yify will seed for very long time
,1apolon1,2013-04-23T01:06Z,audio SUCKS  big time
,mohawkm,2013-04-23T16:54Z,"Downloads fast.  Quality is really good considering the size of the file as expected.  Not bluray clarity, but still great work."
,asmodeus130,2013-04-25T01:23Z,Why do some of you idiots out A: 10? If you actually think this audio is better than a 5 you're fucked in the head
,RMK.Ultra,2013-04-26T07:17Z,"Kudos YIFY, thanks for the up.
Audio whiners freakin' chill & do the following with HandBrake for low sound:

1. Video tab select Copy
2. Audio tab select codec (AC3)
3. Container tab select MP4
4. Sound tab select Gain & Channels original.

Literally takes 10 minutes on a half-way decent machine."
,tiz2,2013-04-27T19:38Z,"A: 5 v: 5, Not really hd, too low bit rate"
,chicagotarsier,2013-05-05T18:57Z,Been a member for a long time and never post.  Just have to say thank you Yify for all your hard work.  Hack the planet!
,andyfukinj,2013-05-09T09:24Z,"Since all these fool spammers were talking shit on YIFY's uploads  ( My personal favorite uploader of good stolen movies) , I thought I would let everyone on here know there is actually a YIFY website out there you can download from......"
,DoomFather,2013-05-17T03:59Z,"If you like the uploads, YIFY has a site, become a member. High quality movies, no retarded monkeys. Only issue, and I hope you read this YIFY, slower download time..."
,oknilem,2013-05-17T17:53Z,"great torrent.

,veelckoo,2013-05-27T01:13Z,"A:10? V:10? 
You must be watching those YIFY ""BrRips"" on a toaster."
,t-wan,2013-05-27T20:37Z,"First of all, I'd like to thank Yify for really nicely sized rips :)
But I too have to complain about audio...
In my opinion, it has absolutely nothing to do with bitrate but the wrongly executed AC3/DTS downmix. For those who aren't aware, Yify encodes stereo (aka 2-ch audio) and it's fine by me. But, to get such an audio from, say, 5.1 AC3/DTS audio track, you first need to do a downmix of all those tracks to just two - left and right. And there is a Center channel that holds the majority of the dialogue - and I feel that particular channel is neglected by Yify team on all their releases!
Notice how everyone complains about very quiet dialogues and too loud explosions, cracks, bangs and whatnot - I believe that is the reason.

So, Yify Team, thanks for all the effort, but it wouldn't kill you to dedicate just a few more minutes of your time and create a proper audio downmix template that doesn't make the central channel quiet as a whisper ;)

@RMK.Ultra - I've downloaded Handbrake and haven't found the exact options you posted, but thanks for the tip all the same - I'll keep digging! ;)
But it isn't a real solution, who would want to tinker with every single download...
And - I watch movies on my LG TV, using its embedded media player, so no, I don't have loads of PC media player options ;)"
,Grymace,2013-05-28T22:52Z,"Awesome download as usual YIFI! I don't care what anyone says, your downloads ROCK!!! Always have always will! FACTS DON'T LIE! Keep 'em comin' YIFI!!!"
,dude8888,2013-05-31T04:40Z,"A=6, V=8, M=6
Very good Bluray rip
(but audio is very, very, very low level)
thanks YIFY!"
