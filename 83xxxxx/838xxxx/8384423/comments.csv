,sgcb,2013-04-19T02:45Z,fuck these piece of shit animation movies that always come out just before an actual film release
,wooziee,2013-04-20T12:01Z,wtf is this shit
,AntBrown,2013-04-20T22:35Z,"Why are you all acting shocked and offended that this is the animated movie? Your mistake, not the u/l's, as it is titled correctly.
Thanks for the upload."
,rohit2310,2013-04-21T18:11Z,All cocksucking motherfuckers..stop fucking & appreciate the uploader for the good upload. The movie details are clearly mentioned so read it & then download  & stop messing with the uploader. If u have money  then buy the movie from the store instead of downloading from here. AND yes the movie is animated.
,kingkong57,2013-04-21T18:19Z,yify in the heading put it as anime.......
,sgcb,2013-04-21T22:32Z,"not pissed at the uploader, just the producers"
,TaiTheGuy,2013-04-23T12:57Z,"@ mgman770 ^
I've been around TPB for a while. I remember when high quality/small file size films were up'd by a hodgepodge of different users- w/ & w/o skulls. Like Zen_Bud & Viceroy & many others.

But your complaint is inaccurate because really, YIFY is just filling the HUGE, MONSTROUS void that aXXo/circlensess left when she/he/they fell off. Accept YIFY is doing a MUCH better job.
What you don't realize is that YIFY didn't originally categorize all his films in Hi-Res. He must have shared your opinion, but the moderators moved them from Video > Movies, over to Video > Hi-Res, which is now HD - Movies."
,rohit2310,2013-04-23T15:10Z,I  totally agree @ TaiTheGuy . Yify is the uploader that you can count on for best uploads other than aXXo & circlensess. Its now hard to find best quality uploads in small sizes which Yify is definitely doing the best job.

,zysis,2013-04-27T02:04Z,"YIFY does it again, thanks so much! Great quality and a very good animated film!"
,Balthazaar007al6i,2013-06-03T03:28Z,"Can confirm I get a Cinavia protection error at approx the 20 min mark when playing back on PS3, for this torrent.
