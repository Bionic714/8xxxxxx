Step-by-step photo essays, pro-level advice, and insider's tips cover every step in the process. The reader is guided through designing a floor plan; framing walls; roughing in the plumbing and electric supply; installing drywall, flooring, cabinets and countertops, tub and shower enclosures, and moldings; and more.
