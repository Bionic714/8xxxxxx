Summary

It is rumored that before his death, Hemingway wrote one last manuscript that contained the location of a real life treasure; now, Lupin is working toward finding the location of the manuscript to find the treasure for himself. His search brings him to a small island in the Mediterranean where two power hungry tyrants fight over power and the location of the treasure. With Goemon working for one faction for his own reasons, Jigen working for the other in order to get revenge, and Fujiko off chasing another rich bachelor, it looks like Lupin might be on his own for this adventure!
