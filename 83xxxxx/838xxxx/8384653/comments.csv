thanks..

I think he actually believed you.

People here are usually too dumb to understand sarcasm. The comments here remind me too much of YouTube.

@ak08 Just about anything would be better than Windows 98. But first you should figure out what your hardware is.

Make sure your system meets the minimum requirements for whatever OS you're going to install. 

See here for Win 8 requirements : http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/system-requirements

Considering that your computer is out of the 90's and you're obviously not very tech savvy though, it'd probably be best to just get a new computer..."
,AlexM13,2013-04-19T08:48Z,"Also, more seeders would be appreciated. Please don't limit your upload speed, upload speed doesn't make much of a difference to your download speed.

I'm connected to what is being listed as 18 seeders and 100 peers and I'm still getting only 10kbps."

i have already 8GB RAM/2TB HDD/i 7/ASUS RAMPAGE 4 EXTREME/NVIDIA Geforce 680.

But I Still Recommend Win 7 64 Bit.

Thanks."

Anyhow, Win8 is very OK. It's not a huge upgrade from win7, but it does integrate the windows store a lot better for the oem people.

I'm not sure how BLUE is gonna turn out but from what I can tell it's going to be like a SP1 used to be kind-of. It changes a few features like the start menu, speed, etc.  I don't play with the trial versions, but I can assure you that I'll be integrating it if I can.

I like their new policy of not taking 5 years for every new OS release to come out. Hopefully people will start realizing what overpriced pieces of crap apple systems are and start getting real computers..."

...will surely use your uploaded."
,intelarmamd,2013-04-19T22:17Z,murphy78. Is the WMC also preactivated in Windows 8 ProWMC?
,elenos_priam,2013-04-19T23:04Z,"yeah, windows 8 is good. lighter and faster than windows 7 with less problems so far, makes apple systems totally waste of money in my opinion and Linux the only worthy alternative"
,CoreyJensen83,2013-04-20T06:47Z,Eat a fatty dick snitch
,intelarmamd,2013-04-21T10:28Z,@murphy78. Is the WMC also reactivated in your Windows 8 Professional WMC edition?
,ShyGuyHC,2013-04-24T07:13Z,Thanks for all these updates to so many versions. Helping techs out everywhere. Much Appreciated.
,rehceel99,2013-04-25T07:57Z,"for me windows 8 is for touchscreen and basic build pc. If you are technical, use Windows 7 sp1 (better)."
,adcool2007,2013-04-30T05:42Z,Is there any way to know that the current installed version is a `VL` edition or `Retail` Edition of  windows 8....like any kind of `slmgr` command
,YodaDaCod,2013-05-02T11:50Z,"@murphy78 do you have any plans to release an AIO with x64+x86 together again? If not, would I break anything by combining your x64 & x86 releases into one install.wim?"
[V],SecTPB,2013-05-03T09:31Z,"I don't understand the three differences between (Core), KMS and the others listed without info.

Also, what is N, VL, and N VL?

I just want a pre-activated Windows 8 x64. Which do I choose? I want the one with the most features. 

I'm going to guess I want to install Windows 8 Pro x64 Pro N VL... but which one? The one listed as KMS-Activated or the one without?"
,NBOOSTER,2013-05-03T10:09Z,"@murphy78
YOU DESERVE GREEN SKULL.
1] PLEASE DON'T COMBINE X86 AND X64 VERSIONS.

2] IS IT OFFICIAL WIN8 OR RTM??

3] I THINK COMBINING PRE-ACTIVATED AND UNACTIVATED VERSIONS IS WASTAGE, KEEP ONLY PRE-ACTIVATED.

4] THANKS FOR YOUR REPLY.

5] KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK NEVER END:)"

,NBOOSTER,2013-05-03T10:19Z,SORRY FOR 2 COMMENTS NET PROBLEM.
,Little.Wonder,2013-05-06T20:24Z,"@ SecTPB
With a bit of knowledge and research, I have some answers for you.
N: the N means ""not with Windows Media Player""
(I think this was something imposed on MicroSoft by the EU)

VL, I think, means Volume Licence: if so, then I don't understand the ""VL 64-bit KMS-Activated"" option as I thought VL meant it didn't need to be activated??

@ murphy78 Do you have a web page that explains the various variations ;) ?"
,deusBG,2013-05-09T11:19Z,"VL means value licence, and that means that with one key you have right to install windows on many computers, and no that you don't have to activate windows ;)
N means that there is no windows media in specified installation.

@ SecTPB
Install Win8 Enterprise Activated, and if you don't use win media player install N version."
