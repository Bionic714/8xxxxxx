[V],murphy78,2013-04-18T14:55Z,"I could use win7enterprise-N-sp1 if you have the rtm FRID. I'm using wzt's leak, which is almost identical, but I'd still prefer the rtm if you have it. Could use both the x86 and x64 versions..

hit me up with a pm on mdl maybe we can do a private torrent or something if you wouldn't mind...

Or if you really don't want to do that, you can pm me on suprbay... just lemme know if you do because I hardly ever go onto suprbay."

,MissRychelle,2013-05-11T06:33Z,Im sorry for the stupid questions but can i use this to install windows 8 on my laptop that currently has windows7?
,Mr.CTT,2013-05-11T17:43Z,"MissRychelle

Yes this will work just burn it to a dual layer dvd or extract the iso and copy the files to a bootable flash drive (google how to make a bootable flash drive)  the last and easiest option is to use a portable hard drive just extract the iso and copy the files on the portable hard drive.  make sure the partition is set to active "
,S.I.C.,2013-05-20T05:39Z,"murphy78,

Thanks for the upload! The built-in KMS is genius.

After researching other Windows 8, I chose your upload because it appeared more trustworthy, and I decided to install ""Windows 8 Enterprise 32-bit KMS-Activated"". I am new to Windows 8, so it took a little effort to familiarize myself with the new environment, but nothing too difficult.

With a fresh OS install I needed all my previous applications reinstalled, which, pretty much, all came from TPB. I started off with Adobe's products (PS, DW, and Flash Pro - from thethingy), and I noticed the OS developed a ""hiccup"".

The hiccup is the PC Settings is no longer accessible, and I cannot find the direct folder location to troubleshoot the problem (since it is a new feature of Windows 8). 

Is this something that you have ran into yet? If so, what would be the solution to get PC Settings accessible again? The system is still activated, and I have disabled all startup applications from running to prevent software conflictions, but ""no bueno"". I did some Googling and was unable to locate a solution...

If anyone else has experienced this problem, any help is appreciated. Thanks in advance..."
,S.I.C.,2013-05-20T06:30Z,"Disregard above post, I found the problem...

I ""over customized"" the Start Screen and removed some essential programs, along with other start screen shortcut files.

Ran sfc/scannow from cmd prompt and had the missing/corrupted files recovered..."
