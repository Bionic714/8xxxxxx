(Core) and ProWMC versions of KMS Activation are not
officially supported by Microsoft, so use them at your
own risk. They default to 30-day activation instead of
the normal 180-day period. All KMS-Activated Indexes
will auto-renew indefinitely as long as you do not
install any kb file that blocks the service or if you
install a security program without allowing the
activation traffic and program through the firewall.
