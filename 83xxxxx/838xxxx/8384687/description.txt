In a small grade school, one class has a unique way of learning about the world with their teacher, Ms. Frizzle. To illustrate the science concepts they discuss, they always take a field trip on the Magic School Bus, a magic vehicle that can literally go anywhere and be anything as the class explores space, the arctic, the human body, and more in order to have a firsthand experience of the principles of science.
