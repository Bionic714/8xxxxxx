A SNAKE IN THEIR MIDST! Her name is CHAMELEON -- and she used to be a COBRA agent. Now she's made her way into the G.I. JOE team -- the honest way. But even with the best of intentions, does she have what it takes to fight on the side of the angels? FLINT thinks she does, and he's willing to gamble the lives of this teammates on her...
