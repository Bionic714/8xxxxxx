--- Description ---

This is a handy software for people working on Thermo courses. It normally comes with the Sonntag Thermodynamics (engineering) book. 

This will work with contemporary windows versions (up through Windows 8 at least, and certainly everything that supports 32-bit and 64-bit windows applications). You can use both a 32-bit and 64-bit Windows version with this. No linux, mac, or other versions are available. 

--- Sample Problem to Remove the Fear of Using a Computer ---
Find the specific volume of water at 120 C and 500 kPa. 
1. Open the progam.
2. Mess around with the buttons at top for no good reason.
3. Click the UNITS button and set things to the metric system you think appropriate. 
4. Click the CALCULATOR button and, for case 1 (P and T), enter the appropriate values (120 C, 0.5 MPa). 
5. Notice your history of searches is tabulated on the lower pane. Notice that cryogenics and other substances are in tabs on this pane. 
6. Keep on messing around with stuff.
