Olesya Kharitonova, the beautiful professional Russian model. What the fuck do they put in the water there to produce such fine specimens? I will seed forever so her beautiful image is immortalized. When future scientists perfect cloning technology they will hopefully come across this torrent or her pictures and realize she's the perfect physical specimen. Don't screw this one up, scientists. I plan on having my head cryogenically frozen. When I'm repaired in the year 2300, if the world's not filled with beautiful Olesya's, I'll be pretty damn pissed. I don't know what weapons the future holds but I'll acquire it and blackmail you bastards into cloning her.

I worked hard to scrape this so you don't have to. Seed or walk the plank, mateys!
