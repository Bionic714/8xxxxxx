,Gros_Shadok,2013-04-19T04:26Z,"First of all many thanks for this episode and more globaly for your great work.

I was wondering if it would be possible that you also share the ""Ponderosa"" episodes that are available on the CBS website... because they are available only to people living in the USA (the site uses geolocalisation to block everybody else) and we are many fans of survivor abroad who would love to see those episodes too.

Here is an example of one of those episodes we can't see from abroad (the guy eliminated this week arrives at the camp : Warning spoiler alert if you haven't seen the survivor episode yet !!!) : http://www.cbs.com/shows/survivor/video/Uh_Zuez9ZTBYSlAOyqI6ycj6_coAnrWL/survivor-caramoan-phillip-joins-michael-at-ponderosa/

Thanks"

Survivor Ponderosa videos will be posted in Youtube at some point."
