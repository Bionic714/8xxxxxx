TVble is a new project that combines the simplicity of DLNA enabled media servers (allows you to consume content straight from your smart TV/tablet) with the freedom of online torrent content.

TVble works like this:

-&gt; Browse movie information sourced from themoviedb, rotten tomatoes and TPB.
-&gt; Select a playlist of movies (for example TOP rental DVDs, house of cards etc)
-&gt; TVble adds files to the queue and begins to download the first 2% of each file
-&gt; TVble media server allows DLNA players (smarts TV, media players, tablets etc) to browse the files and start playing a file.
-&gt; TVble un-pauses the currently playing file and continues to download the rest of the movie - while you watch it

The bottom line is that your selected list of movies is ready to watch straight on your TV, without having to download, wait, connect a TV, or walk to the computer to turn on the volume :-)

TVble combines these three areas to make a great experience:
* DLNA media server
* Torrent peer to peer sharing
* Online movie databases and metadata
