smanukin try deleting your map cache"
,Milos2020,2013-04-18T15:04Z,"I forgot to say that I already tested it and it works perfectly.But before runing it I deleted my map cache, deleted everything(victoria 2 related) in my documents too."
,Milos2020,2013-04-18T15:06Z,"After deleting your cache and succesfully running the game, you should exit and just start the game again.Doing that will prevent crashing when minimizing."
