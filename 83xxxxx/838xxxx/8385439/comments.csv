Gonna try now :)"
,onlyHD,2013-04-18T12:27Z,"@Jalucian: I just happen to read your posts in The Sunset Limited (2011) [1080p].
I go with dalesteyn's suggestion in this issue. 
Let's hope that as coincidence. This is just a beginning of a journey and lots more waiting on the way. So never let yourself down.

Cheers mate !!!"
,dalesteyn,2013-04-18T14:10Z,thnx @onlyHD for your support...happy downloading mate :-)
,grvnvt,2013-04-18T18:08Z,"Wow..this is some weird movie - will give it a try though!
I agree with dalestyn-will definitely wait for your releases if I know which are coming up. Example- Yify has just released Jack Reacher in 720 & 1080p. If I know that your 1080p release is coming up, I would definitely wait for your release !"

,jalucian,2013-04-18T21:41Z,"Wow, thanks guys for your support and encouragement. Really means a lot and keeps me wanting to keep cranking them out! Especially since YIFY's work was what inspired me to start encoding. I generally try to target stuff he hasn't done though because his team is extremely competent. The only thing I can really fault their releases on is low audio volume. Often I have to turn VLC audio up to 125-150% to get a ""normal"" level on those releases. They are encoded at 96kbps audio whereas mine are 160kbps. I'm not exactly sure why this would affect volume as opposed to quality, but I haven't yet heard anyone report similar issues with my audio. 

Oh, another encoder who I admire greatly who has also helped me quite a bit with advice and whatnot is dhjudasx. Check out his work. He only does 1080p (no 720) but like myself and YIFY, does an outstanding job maintaining quality while keeping the file size down. He also offers a second audio track for 5.1 audio which is something YIFY and I do not do. My main target audience are those who watch movies on their computers and most people who do so do not have 5.1 systems, which is why I haven't done that (yet), but I am considering it. Adding a 5.1 audio track also generally results in a 500-600meg file size increase which is another reason I've been reluctant to do so. What are your thoughts on having an additional 5.1 audio track if it means bigger file sizes?

Coming up tonight and tomorrow night: the 1080p version of Das Boot, and (by request) Ondskan (Evil), another Swedish movie. Das Boot 1080p has the distinction of being the longest encode Ive ever done. Using my new more rigorous settings, it took a whopping 27 hours to encode - a new record! :) But it looks FANTASTIC even on larger TV screens. My 720's are perfect for computer monitors but for larger screens the 1080's are unparallelled. Just out of curiosity, what size screens do you guys watch these on?"
,grvnvt,2013-04-19T14:47Z,"27 hours - gosh that's long! Really fantastic effort to spend so much time.
Normally I watch on a 42 inch screen- ur 1080p releases look fabulous on it :)"
,dalesteyn,2013-04-19T15:01Z,"its funny coz i asked onlyHD this exact same question few days ago,he watches movies on 21"" desktop monitor....& I watch movies on a 23 inch dell monitor...but i will buy a 32"" FULLHD LED TV later this year....so it would be a nice experience...
what do you watch movies on???"
,dalesteyn,2013-04-19T16:42Z,"wow..grvnvt, that's fantastic news mate...42"" is quite big screen...then it will look prefect i guess on my ""GONNA BE"" 32"" tv....brilliant work JALUCIAN... :)"
,onlyHD,2013-04-19T18:23Z,"27 hours ????

Just wanna share one word.














INCREDIBLE !!!!"
,jalucian,2013-04-21T00:23Z,"I'm having bandwidth issues right now so unfortunately Ondskan 720p will have to wait another day or two - sorry.

Thanks again for the support guys, really appreciate it. I had a friend of mine test some of my 1080's, also on a 42"" and reported the same results. Very encouraging. Now, my 720p's will not look that great on larger screens, but look perfect on computer monitors, which is what they were meant for. I usually watch movies initially just on my laptop, which is 17, and then if I love the movie, I'll get the 1080 and I have a 26"" TV with an HDMI connection for the good stuff. Thanks for the info guys - really helps me out."
