Information
------------------------------

A powerfully moving large format film unlike any other, Hurricane on the Bayou carries audiences behind today┬Æs news headlines on a journey deep into the soul-stirring heart of Louisiana ┬û before, during and after the unprecedented devastation of Hurricane Katrina. Unfolding against the poignant backdrop of the most costly natural disaster in America┬Æs history, MacGillivray Freeman┬Æs IMAX┬« cameras follow a group of four musicians, both legendary and rising, as they explore the electrifying culture of New Orleans: speed through the beautiful, alligator-filled bayous on airboats; recount their heart-wrenching, personal stories of Katrina; and most of all, bring the focus to the rapidly disappearing wetlands that are New Orleans┬Æ first line of defense against deadly storms. Vanishing at an astonishing rate of one acre every 38 minutes according to the U.S. Geological Survey, the wealth, cultural vitality and very future of New Orleans depend on the preservation of these wetlands.
