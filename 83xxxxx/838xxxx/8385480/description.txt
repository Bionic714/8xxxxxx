Help an ex-tennis star, Pete Pagassi, save the city from the evil energy drink corporation, Explodz! In Tennis in the Face, you will knock out creepy clowns, evil riot police and other Explodz-addicted maniacs with Pete's trusty tennis ball... in their faces! Tell Pete where to hit and watch his tennis ball bounce off the walls to strike enemies. The more enemies you knock out with a single serve, the higher your score! It's up to you and your Tennis in the Face to take out the diabolical Explodz!
