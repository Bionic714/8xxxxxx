,Ghostwire,2013-04-18T12:00Z,*In the actually torrent you have the Corps instead of the new guardians. Might want to check that out. Anyway thanks all the same! Keep it up

[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-18T14:49Z,"Ghostwire, as I had explained in the description for the New Guardians 19 torrent, the scanner accidentally titled the .cbr file ""Green Lantern Corps"". easily fixed after you d/l.

as for saying Batman 19 came out last week, uhm... ok, so what? Batwoman 19 came out this week, which is what is here.

this pack has all the new 52s from this week! thanks mirrormaster82"

,HeyNow01138,2013-04-19T13:55Z,Hey now!
,Azrael_214,2013-04-20T05:05Z,"Thanks a lot man! Wait for your torrent every week. :)

BTW any chance you can reduce the size of the comics? The first 40 weeks were like 200MB, now everything is going up to 520MB. Not good when your internet is capped. :|
Or a link to a smaller file size would be nice. 
Thanks.

,war_klaw,2013-04-20T16:17Z,"Hi, anybody here happen to have Injustice #03 (Print) on torrent?"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-21T00:21Z,"war_klaw, blackcanary and i were searching for that on tuesday, but it had not been scanned yet. it will probably appear in the next week or two. i promise to post it, if i get it -- i love the series and i prefer the print version.

Azrael_214, for one thing the publishers are putting higher-resolution scans on comixology. and also, we uploaders have zero influence on the file sizes.

your best bet is to look for a torrent by mastacow2, he does shrink 3 or 4 issues every week to a smaller size for tablet readers. leave him a comment with your request, that's my advice."
,Azrael_214,2013-04-25T16:28Z,Thanks STF!
