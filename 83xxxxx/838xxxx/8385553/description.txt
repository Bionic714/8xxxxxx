4)  Alcohol 
In the " Alcohol" special edition of "Drugged," viewers were presented with a story that was both a tragedy and a cautionary tale. Ryan, a 28-year-old alcoholic, drank three pints of vodka a day. Ryan turned to alcohol when his father, who was also an alcoholic, passed away four years ago. In just four years, Ryan has done severe damaged to his body, and yet he seems fully aware of the danger he's in, and oddly" My organs are shot. They hurt every day," he said at one point. "It would be weird feeling if they didn't." And yet still he wouldn't stop drinking. While Ryan did agree to and enter rehab at the end of filming, he died just 17 days into treatment.
