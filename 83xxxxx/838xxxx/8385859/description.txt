This episode: Thursday 04-18-2013 - Mathieu Kassovitz - Film Director and Actor
From engaging child actor to best director at Cannes, Mathieu Kassovitz has been a darling of French cinema for thirty years. Now he says "I'm out of this country" - and it's nothing to do with taxes.

Frustrated with an industry that was indifferent to his latest movie, or with the politicians who furnish some of his least appealing characters? Or could it be the French themselves who've annoyed Mathieu Kassovitz? His newest film attracted an audience there of just 150,000 people.

Has the actor-director tired of France, or have the French tired of him?
