[V],L3G3ND,2013-04-18T19:49Z,"The ISO file is : en_windows_8_x64_x86_aio.iso

Is it PRO or AIO

I think this guy is alot confused himself  lol ^_^"
,spoon1090,2013-04-18T22:55Z,"sorry, it's AIO. 
Please change in the description, to Windows 8.

cheers :)"
,skin1235,2013-04-22T12:46Z,"I searched for removewat/removewat.exe several times
it is not found
I assume this will mean the windows install will not be activated
therefore I just wasted time and bandwidth downloading something I could have picked up at the local bookstore for $5 ie an unactivated copy of win8"
