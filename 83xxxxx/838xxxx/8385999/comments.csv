,Kanegasi,2013-04-22T09:23Z,"(Serious comment)

mgman770, your first sentence contradicts itself.

""There is nothing remotely considered HD about these uploads except pixel count.""

HD, which is short for High Definition, simply means an increase in resolution, or ""pixel count"" as you call it. Please explain more clearly how YIFY's high pixel count 24fps uploads are not HD, unless you are simply picky about the compression level of his uploads, then that's just your opinion. That's why YIFY's so popular. They release space-saving uploads with an almost perfect balance between quality and compression. They are still HD. Go ahead and Google the definition of HD or the explanation of 720p and 1080p. All of YIFY's uploads are correctly listed in the high definition section."

Maybe TPB should create a new section called ""Uncompressed Raw HD"" for the whiners that like stuffing almost 10 GB worth of a movie into their 10 TB stack of drives. Regardless of today's storage prices, a lot of people still have space at a premium. I, myself, have room for approximately 100ish of YIFY's average uploads before I have to get another drive, and that's not including the other crap I put on that drive."
,kkphotos,2013-04-22T23:54Z,"Well said, Kanegasi.
mgman770 is spamming the entire HD section with the same comment. "
,funky_ace,2013-04-23T16:18Z,Man this movie suck so hard. These Anime are killing the Marvel Universe. Stupid gestures that are meaningless to most fans plus cliche dialogues. They need to stop.

,RazielOO7,2013-04-27T19:07Z,"All this fighting on YIFY torreent threads !! :P

Some of them know what they are talking about....some are empty cans - all noise no stuff and the rest are just on someone's payroll ;)

*************

My two cents on the matter at hand :

I have a 22 inch led monitor on which I used to watch the downloaded movies. So I used to be quite pleased with the YIFY downloads - 1.5/2 GB stuff - nice picture quility...nice sound.

But then I bought a 32 inch led TV. And guess what - I was like ""what the hell !!"" when I tried watching the 1.5/2GB YIFY downloads on TV !!
They looked total CARP !!

So I would say ....

If you plan to watch the downloaded movies on your 20 inch monitor these YIFY downloads are just fine.
But if you plan to watch them on your your HD TV (32""/42"")....you better download atleast 4GB+ files. 

I downloaded a 4.5GB file for ""Life of Pi"" - looked just fine on my 32 inch screen.

(Now I just download the 'general/so-so' movies from YIFY (1.5/2GB) and the 'awesome' movies from other uploaders (4/7GB)....best of both the worlds)

***************

So for those folks who are fighting over stuff they can't comprehend.....stop fighting and live wisely...peace out !! O:)"
