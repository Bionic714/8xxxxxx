,keywest33,2013-04-18T17:44Z,Ta but just a word of warning about nero--there is no cleanup software for later versions and I had hard work uninstalling also support via email etc from nero is nil as the never replied to any of my emails
[V],promodsharma,2013-04-19T07:46Z,"@'keywest33' - You need not have a Nero Uninstall Utility to clean up the previous versions. First Uninstall the previous version normally, using your Window OS Program. Then 

Clear also:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWARENero

HKEY_CURRENT_USERSoftwareNero
(You can delete the entire Nero Folder in the registry)

Then also delete the Folders :

C:Program FilesNero
C:Program FilesCommon FilesNero

Your Computer will be ready for a Fresh Install of Nero.


@'     ThumperTM' - Thanks for the upload :)

,xplorar,2013-04-22T05:23Z,The provided serial no longer works. Please provide another!
,xplorar,2013-04-22T06:55Z,I take back my comment! Serial does works.  You need to replace DLLs (step#3) before adding serial (step#2). Thank you guys!

,smokebig,2013-05-13T06:58Z,^ Same here. Using on Windows 8 Pro (64-bit).
,blombardo,2013-05-13T13:20Z,Same error - Error: Cannot open input file.  - nothing on his website about it. Win 7 64bit 
,Shamejais,2013-05-18T07:38Z,"Same: Error: Cannot open input file 
Too bad :("
,Madaz13b,2013-05-19T15:03Z,"Just getting ""error cannot open input file"" when double clicking install exe, tried in admin mode also."
,erza20,2013-05-28T16:33Z,"error input file solution:
rename the main folder shorter like""Nero"""
,steelllynx,2013-05-30T08:56Z,"It's just because of those two retarded characters around ""ThumperDC"" in the folder name, just take those two out of the folder name and it works. (and now I can't seed it, so copy it into a different folder works better)"
,steelllynx,2013-05-30T10:11Z,Key is Non-Licensed
,steelllynx,2013-05-30T10:14Z,"I'm wondering why every version of Nero so far can not handle anything to do with MP3, it just crashes."
,steelllynx,2013-05-30T10:33Z,"Disregard my previous comment.  Reverse steps 3 and 2 and the key works, now it is burning my MP3s to audio cd.  THANKS!"
