O&O AutoBackup 2.1 Build 16 Final (32-64bit) Incl Serial - SceneDL

O&O AutoBackup automatically synchronizes selected files and folders with an external backup device (USB Stick, external USB hard disk, FireWire volume). As an example, you can use O&O AutoBackup to create a backup copy of your photo folder onto a USB stick and set it so that changes made to the original data are automatically taken into account for the next backup.

The copy process will start automatically whenever you connect your USB/Firewire disk to the computer. Using the status bar icon and the status window in the program, you can see when the process is complete and simply remove the external drive at the end.

OS : Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8 (32-bit, 64-bit)
