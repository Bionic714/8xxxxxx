,firedart,2013-04-21T15:45Z,"God yify ,sir what do u get other than our appreciation and gratitude of uploading these hundreds of movies,which we bear the fruit.How do u earn money? how do u fund yourself,for your website,i don't see any ads in your site without turning of my ad block extension.or r u just doing for the glory,r u like a activist, a anti producer activist for movies, and pro piracy activist."
,firedart,2013-04-21T15:53Z,"i am just curious,your are a bit responsible for the downfall of Hollywood gross collection ,bluray and dvd gross collection,i love you,but u know coz of people like you.
 people dont buy blurays and dvds (orginals legally).I am just curious ,i have been a part of your digital empire since 3 years from now own,and i seed every single one of your movies,i have more than 3 tb of space,and great bandwidth,so i seed most of your movie.People don't go to theatres coz of this site,and that way no producer will have the balls to budget any movie,DMCA is fighting against torrents,and tpb is banned in my coutry right now here.so could you tell something about yourself in a blog or something and tell people like me y you should torrent"
,Twiddler_13,2013-04-22T02:19Z,"@firedart... what do you want from YIFY? you say that you share movies from him, but you give reasons why he shouldn't rip and share.

You say that TPB is banned in your country on TPB.

You are a confusing individual."
,murknow,2013-04-23T07:47Z,"@mgman770..
     Just shut up man, Yify's uploads belong here, they are HD, you claim to understand why people flock to his awesome size/quality ratio, and then you call it spam when you see him with the top seeders.. guess what if you dont know how to weed through your own searches and you start crying and complaining about your own stupidity, well then, idk kill yourself because dim wit comments like yours ""spam"" up the comment section..  so ya YOU need to be in a different section. ya fukn duck lol

@YIFY - You my good sir make stupid ducks like this^ cry in they're ramen noodle soup! Keep up your supreme uploads brotha"
,roadjag,2013-04-29T14:54Z,"@mgman770I have to second it.

,nsj7762,2013-05-14T13:29Z,possible to get in 1080p by any chance? 
,kiasta,2013-05-25T02:12Z,"@firedart Hollywood makes their money and more from the theatre, if their movie is good they will make more money, it's a great way to stay competitive also. He's not really hurting them, they're just greedy bastards and want to take all your money."
