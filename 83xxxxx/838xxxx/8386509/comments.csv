,matrael,2013-04-19T06:46Z,"Installed into VirtualBox and seems to work well. I don't like the themes that were installed. A lot of the modifications are hard to read and what not. I felt there was too much work to make this usable for myself, so I deleted it. Thank you for the effort. Just realize not everyone shares your aesthetic ;-)"
,Perdekop,2013-04-20T14:20Z,Windows Update does NOT work.
,Gets,2013-04-21T16:42Z,use wuoffline if Windows Update does not work. Windos Update is crappy anyway.
