,dshaon,2013-04-18T20:04Z,all good with this one?
,jasonleigh282,2013-04-18T21:45Z,"Does it work on rogero 4.30?
Please reply cus I don't wanna risk downloading it. I live in a 3rd world cntry and my max speed of download is 300KBps."
,banditten,2013-04-18T23:46Z,"Really What the FUCK Happened, With respect, appreciation & FOREMOST GRATITUDE... INSTEAD of bombarding for me one of the best uploaders in this section... YOU ARE SO LAZY SPOILED FUCKERS THAT YOU CANT EVEN USE GOOGLE..."
,ps3links,2013-04-19T00:50Z,"@banditten

You could simply of just answered his question. He meant 0 disrespect to the uploader. There was no need at all for a response of that magnitude. TheNoobish is a great upload, and I'm sure he would have never wanted someone to treat a user that way.

@jasonleigh282

It will most likely work on that MFW, if not, update to the latest one, 4.41 I think it is. There are quite a few floating around, check ps3hax.net for them.

Have a good day everyone!"
,banditten,2013-04-19T01:34Z,"By all means @ps3links, you know what... I give you that one :-) 
i am so sorry that i didn't Open a New window and googled it, as a part of my Daily surfing around helping people that JUST WANT TO HAVE AND STILL dont have the common sense and Say Thx To you guys... 
But Then AGAIN MAYBE YOU DON'T GIVE A SHIT, about people appreciating your Effort???
But You Now what, As Long as @thenoobish Don't mind me saying MY OPINION...
I Really don't give a flying f..k, About yours... Thats The way we are heading, if people dont treat each other with good old Respect and courtesy... "
,dshaon,2013-04-19T08:51Z,Ohh Boy! Knock it off guys! Now anyone confirms this run with 3.55?
,banditten,2013-04-19T13:03Z,"And thats what i mean, you take your effort in comenting our comments... But yet you can't seem to find the 7 keys on the keyboard, that when you push them in the right sequence form the magic word THANK'S "
,dshaon,2013-04-19T22:30Z,"Haven't downloaded it yet, just was inquiring whether it will run or not with 3.55 like other dplex releases! Banditten, I think you are disturbed! And if you are a girl, you must be having period! "
,banditten,2013-04-19T23:15Z,"And you must really have a HUGE reading problem, Stupid fuck... Times like this i really hate the distance and safety, the internet provides stupid pussys like you... You stupid little ignorant M.... fucker...  I would love just 3 min in a quiet, sound proof room... After that your mom would be proud of her pussy ass son, and the real gentleman you would become... To show how disturbed i am, i would be help full in any way possible, to make a meeting between you @dshaon and me or a representative on my behalf depends country etc... 
And then i will provide you with a face, looking like you been licking a dog with its period... So i hope to hear from you my email is bandittenken@gmail.com
Or just be a fucking tough ass Wannabe gameplaying stupid ass pussy wanker, throwing comments around guarded by net anonymity.  THE CHOICE IS YOURS... ARE YOU or are you JUST PRETENDING..."
,B7U31C3,2013-04-20T01:03Z,"confirmed working on Rogero 4.40 v1.03,however sometimes in different fight scenes your character,(whoever you are playing),will not fight back. Yes he or she will move backwards and forwards but will not fight back or is very slow to do so. Don't know why this happens but is very f%*king annoying..."
,dududus,2013-04-20T05:29Z,banditten bought the wrong tampons.. his pussy hurts now so he is angry
,dshaon,2013-04-20T08:25Z,"Haha...tell me about it Dududus, Banditten needs to get a life!"
,banditten,2013-04-20T09:07Z,still waiting for your contact info dshaon :)
,GopherTee,2013-04-20T09:18Z,dshaon! Don't be a dumb***.  Upgrade already. And yes the uploader is an idiot.
,DrVonEvil,2013-04-20T13:38Z,"Hey banditten, does this work on 3.55?"
,banditten,2013-04-20T15:41Z,"To DrVonEvil, I haven't finished downloading. I am on cfw 4.30, so i can sadly not confirm it... The only thing i know is That if thenoobish IS THE UPLOADER Like on this one, THEN it's A WORKING GAME... But wich Cfw its working on i don't know...Sorry DrVonEvil, but Download it... and anyway if there is not now, there probably will be a fix for you... But Why not upgrade to cfw 4.**? "
,dshaon,2013-04-20T18:28Z,"Miss. Banditten, get in line! :)

Gophertee, I don't want to right now! Simply asked whether it runs or not on 3.55. Why so hostile?
"
,dududus,2013-04-20T18:42Z,"yah guys.. really is time to move on from 3.55

,Persia514,2013-05-22T23:47Z,"okay so on ROGERO 4.40 I  found a SOLUTION TO THE FREEZING SCREEN AT THE BEGINNING ON INJUSTICE GODS AMONGS US.

download the other release : 
http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8490007/Injustice__Gods_Among_Us___6_DLC_%5BPS3%5D_%5BRepack_v_1.01%5D

Forget about this torrent i tried everything and it was just frozen.

on the other torrent just install the first 4 PKG's ...that is if you have cfw rogero 4.40"
