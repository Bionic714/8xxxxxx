I'll be putting this into the Image Week torrent today, but I just sat here and read it. This is so good! Along with TWD and Chew, this is one of the Image series that I buy every month. If you aren't reading it, give it a try! And this is actually not a bad issue to start with... Seeley does a good job making it easy to jump aboard...
