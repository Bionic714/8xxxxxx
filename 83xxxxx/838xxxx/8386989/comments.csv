The first step to trusted status is SEEDING. Previews would be useful however since you don't seed the files, previews seem to be far beyond your abilities."

Thus, I do not download anything by this user, he really needs to play the unspoken rules of TPB."
,sylver_shadow,2013-04-18T22:21Z,He needs to be banned from TPB is what needs to happen!!! He keeps posting torrents and never seeds any to completion. I wish the mods would just block or delete his account.
,DickStarbucks,2013-04-18T22:48Z,Seriously dood!!  Previews!!
