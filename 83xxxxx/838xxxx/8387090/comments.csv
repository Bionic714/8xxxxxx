,SteelerJ17,2013-04-18T19:35Z,@E.Game I'm doing The Final Countdown right now and will upload today. I thought I had The Replacement Killers director's cut. I'm a huge Chow Yun Fat fan. It's out on DVD so I ordered. As soon as I find it. Ill upload 
,E.Game,2013-04-18T20:16Z,"SteelerJ17 you're awesome!!! thanks a lot!!!
Chow Yun Fat always got good movie... At first when you upload The Killer (Criterion) I thought that was The Replacement Killers, but both are different story... The Killer is awesome movie too, I will like to know is there any Chinese sub on it? :)
I'm sorry as my request is usually old movie, hope you don't mind... "
,SteelerJ17,2013-04-18T20:41Z,@E.Game The Killer (Criterion) only has English subs. I have never seen a Criterion that has more subs in it. Now I have to buy Hard Boiled (Criterion) and upload it. The Killer (Criterion) is my favorite cut of the film. 
,E.Game,2013-04-18T20:57Z,Hard Boiled... WOW!!! support you!!!
