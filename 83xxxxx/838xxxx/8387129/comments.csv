,SystemFolder,2013-04-19T06:48Z,"According to IMDB demographics, females under 18 gave this an 8.2; everyone else gave it a 6.8 or less. People of my gender in my age range gave it a 5. I think I'll pass too."

,averagehuman,2013-04-20T05:07Z,"I'm left wondering whether people have any eyes and ears or not. Video played perfectly in VLC. Quality was good for the resolution and file size. Audio was noisy and crackled but bearable.

Video quality was good. No choppiness in VLC. Audio was noisy and crackled. Not good, but bearable."
,PauloFran,2013-04-20T14:40Z,"Good video quality. Thank you!
The movie is terrible, though.

,ozeem301,2013-04-20T16:07Z,"what do you expect from the author of Twilight? another rubbish !!!!!!!!!, from the cover it looks like another boring love triangle with annoying girl love 2 guys, :facepalm"
,SRICE82,2013-04-20T19:10Z,"Is it really so hard to type ""cropped"" in the title and save us the hassle of comparing screenshots. Seems like nice quality though."
,THRobinson,2013-04-20T20:30Z,"Is it me? or does the video seem a bit stretched/tall? Not by a lot but, by enough that it's noticeable?"

,TruWING,2013-04-21T21:27Z,"This really IS choppy. You'll notice it even more so when the camera is panning from left to right.

Still, regardless, it's still a decent quality enough that I watched the entire movie. So its not all that bad, if you can deal with the choppy video, of course.

A=8.5
V=7.5
M=6.5"
,averagehuman,2013-04-22T06:39Z,"This is not CAM, it's an asian DVD rip. It is not choppy at all. If it is, then there's something wrong with your video setup. The audio on the other hand is quite noisy."
,averagehuman,2013-04-22T06:44Z,@PetaFlux: Visually impaired? Look at the fucking jpegs. Seen a lot of crisp and colorful 30-30 fps full pixel 2:41 CAMs lately have you? :P

I must be the only one who enjoyed the movie. 
i really don't care what rotten tomatoes or anyone else says about the movie. Everyone has different opinions. "
,averagehuman,2013-04-22T11:07Z,"@TDWPx210
It was nowhere near as bad as Twilight. But the whole romance triangle shit was very reminiscent I thought. If you liked this movie you should check out ""They Live!"" and ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"". The Invasion from 2007 and Puppet Masters from 1994 are also ok."
,Djpabloh,2013-04-24T20:17Z,Really thanks :D
,leftofright92,2013-04-25T04:31Z,Audio was synced up pretty good but crackled alot. I give it V:9 A:6. The movie was okay. I wouldn't watch it again but not bad for a free movie. Might be worth watching once.
,TitMonger,2013-04-26T03:15Z,"@averagehuman Not as bad as Twilight? That made me laugh at setting the bar so low. They Live was pretty original, even if it was cheesy."
,ectoendomezo,2013-05-08T12:51Z,"@....everyone who mentioned 'They Live'..

'They Live' is a bizarre Classic..sadly made in the era of ..well...'mixed ideas about sci-fi'..so you have ""Rowdy Rodney piper"" in the lead and actually not doing TOO bad a job..while on the flip side you have one of THE greatest sci-fi 'moments' with the 'sunglasses' that ..while giving you a migraine allow you to 'SEE' the alien control mechanisms and propaganda everywhere...every page of every magazine...all money..""This Is Your God"" was a Particularly brilliant moment..and bilboards everywhere stating ""OBEY"".

Brilliant and Hilarious and ..WHY has it not been REMADE?

Remake 'They Live' Now!

Anyone want to start a committee? How about 'Occupy'? ""Occupy The Remake Of 'They Live'!"""
