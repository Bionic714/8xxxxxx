,JB2425,2013-04-18T19:52Z,Having trouble locating TMNT Micro Series Villains Krang #1. Any idea if anyone's UL yet?
,Calel1234,2013-04-18T21:43Z,"Thanks again for the uploads. Can you tell me again where I can find the list of comics that are released and not released? There's a few Avatar comics (crossed, dan the unharmable, ferals) that I have no clue for when it comes to release dates. "
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-19T01:45Z,"Calel1234, comiclist.com is great for looking up this week & next week. midtowncomics.com is harder to use, but they keep all companies' release dates very up-to-date.

and before you ask, i haven't seen crossed badlands scanned. or stitched. or living dead. yet. ;-)"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-19T01:46Z,"JB2425, i saw it but didn't d/l it yet. will try to post it here soon."
,Ahlat,2013-04-19T07:10Z,Thank you STFmaryville! 
,Hamster-X,2013-04-19T13:23Z,Thanks a million for these STF! This weekly pack is something I'm looking forward to xD
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-19T14:22Z,"you're both welcome. yes Hamster-X, i've been reading more of their lesser-known titles as a result, and they have several good books i've never tried."
