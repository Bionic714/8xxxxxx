Plot: Ross Noble as a murderous clown in Stitches. Keith Chegwin and Joe Pasquale victims in a slasher movie called Kill Keith. That other, no less socially unacceptable Keith (Lemon) headlining an actual movie. Yep, what with one thing and another, itΓÇÖs been a strange year for British cinema. Most unlikely of all, though, is May I Kill U? which stars cuddly comedian Kevin Bishop as a crazed and dangerous vigilante police officer.
