In an innocent heartland city, five are shot dead
by an expert sniper. The police quickly identify
and arrest the culprit, and build a slam-dunk case.
But the accused man claims he's innocent and says
"Get Jack Reacher." Reacher himself sees the news
report and turns up in the city. The defense is
immensely relieved, but Reacher has come to bury
the guy. Shocked at the accused's request, Reacher
sets out to confirm for himself the absolute
certainty of the man's guilt, but comes up with
more than he bargained for.
