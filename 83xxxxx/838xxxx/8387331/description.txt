I was never really that interested in Enrique Iglesias (though my aunt loves Julio, Enrique's father) until I bought it for less than a nickel (a music store was going out of business)! After about 3 weeks of not touching it, I finally decided to give it a try while cleaning up my room. I fell in love with the CD afterwards. Enrique is very talented and writes all his songs!! And I say this is the best CD because it's not like my other favorites where there are a lot of songs I like on the CD and then there are those that I don't. On this CD I don't have to skip tracks 'cause I love them all!!
