,Yorio,2013-04-20T02:10Z,http://www.xboxmb.com/forum/19-horizon-modding/58417-how-put-games-demand-dlc-onto-hard-drive-using-horizon.html This might help out.
,derds900,2013-04-20T07:09Z,Already done that. And still states that the file is corrupt.
,AdamQsac,2013-04-20T15:22Z,"""Error
Downloadable content is damaged.""

I extracted multiple times using both winrar, and 7zip, and i transferred it using horizon, still does not work."
,Yorio,2013-04-21T04:54Z,"Yeah, me too. I think it's cause pirated DLC only works on the original account which this guy did not provide."
,v_Unity,2013-04-23T10:21Z,Whatttt you cant edit ID's in Horizon? I wonder if it will still work?
,VisciusK,2013-04-24T22:44Z,"Thanks, works perfect"
,VisciusK,2013-04-24T22:45Z,Need to apply update 9 for work
,Yorio,2013-04-25T06:02Z,"Viscius, you mind helping us out then if it worked for you? Like posting a little tutorial or something?"
,toonamo,2013-04-26T20:56Z,"used xtaf and horizon. tu9 is installed and working. still get corrupted data error.
