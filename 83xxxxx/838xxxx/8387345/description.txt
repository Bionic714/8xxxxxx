Game information
=================

Quico's best friend, Monster, is a huge beast with razor-sharp teeth,  but
that doesn't scare Quico away from playing with him.  That  said,  Monster
does have a very dangerous problem: an addiction to poisonous  frogs.  The
minute he sees one hop by, he'll scarf it down and  fly  into  a  violent,
frog-induced rage where no one, including Quico, is safe. And  yet,  Quico
loves his Monster and wants to save him
As Quico, players will build their  friendship  with  Monster  by  solving
puzzles together and adventuring  through  a  magical,  surrealist  world
Players will need to learn to use Monster's emotions, both good  and  bad,
to their advantage if they want to complete their search for  a  cure  and
save their pal
