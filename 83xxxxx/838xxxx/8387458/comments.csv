@dhjudasx:

OMG 300!!!!! I was waiting for this a long time ago. Anyway thanks for uploading. What is your next upload will be?"
,buenio,2013-04-19T04:17Z,"Judas please upload Django Unchained, CZ12, Gangster Squad and Inglourious Basterds in 5.1 Surround..."
,peasantx,2013-04-19T04:55Z,"fantastic upload. All of your uploads are 10/10, even more so now that i fixed that audio issue I was having earlier.

Just wondering, could you upload the Kill Bill films? I love Tarantino's style and I'm sure the discs aren't terribly expensive. 

Keep on uploading these flawless rips!"
,buenio,2013-04-19T07:52Z,@peasantx yeah i love quentin taratino's film too especially Inglourious Basterds and Django Unchained so please Judas upload this 2 great movies and then CZ12 and Gangster Squad...
,buenio,2013-04-19T11:15Z,JUDAS why you only post 5.1 Surround 192 kb/s it's wrong men your bitrate in 5.1 is 228 kb/s i'm using mediainfo!.
[V],dhjudasx,2013-04-19T17:27Z,"Because the bitrate i set is 192kbps... and it's 2 pass encoded, with loosely enforced bitrate settings.

Which means

While 192kbps is the base for the encode, it'll attempt to stick around the 192kbps range for the first pass, however on a 2nd pass it'll determine if the bitrate is insufficient for any specific part of the audio, if it finds that the audio is not as accurate as it should be, it bumps the bitrate up above the preferred setting. Sometimes it'll creep well past 300kbps if there is a requirement for it.

2 Pass AAC Encoding with loosely enforced bitrate settings has proven to me to be the most effective and best possible compression with the highest potential audio quality. It's pretty damn bullet proof.

Someone using AAC LC encoding on a single pass would HAVE to double the bitrate to be anywhere near equivalent in quality to much my HE-AAC/LC 2 pass encoded audio, and even then it might still be debatable.

192kbps AAC5.1 (or in the case of this movie 225kbps with 277kbps peak) Bitrate is equivalent to that of 448-640kbps 5.1 AC3/DTS Core at about half or less than half the original size (using a 1536kbps 5.1 DTS/True-HD Master Audio source)"
,buenio,2013-04-19T17:46Z,"Ah ok, @dhjudasx please upload Inglourious basterds, CZ12, Gangster Squad and Django Unchained in 5.1 if you still don't have this movies would you please upload expendables 1 & 2."

@dhjudasx:

thanks for the movie. Just downloaded now.

Question: Why is the video quality looks like a bit grainy image like in bright scenes i see a lots of white dots. Is the physical blu-ray disk comes in same video quality."
[V],dhjudasx,2013-04-19T20:05Z,"the physical bluray uses a lot of ""grain"".... that is how they made the film...

it's a very very grainy filter they used and even more amplified by the fact that they used additional filters/effects on top of it.

I don't have those movies ready yet."
