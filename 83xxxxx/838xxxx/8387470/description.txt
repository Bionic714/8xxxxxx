Shawn isn't sure what to do next after Juliet finds out that he is not psychic, but he has a bigger problem on his hands when the taxi he's in narrowly avoids hitting an injured Swedish woman, giving him a head injury in the process. As he investigates from there, a string of murders is revealed, but Shawn plays it out from two scenarios, the second being what would've happened if Juliet never discovered the truth. In the end, it is Juliet who crushes Shawn further when she orders him to move out.
