,glooking,2013-04-19T18:58Z,any english subtitle that works with this release?
,Pdid,2013-04-19T23:40Z,"This movie suuuuuuccccccckkkkkkkkkssssssss!!!!! Two hours-I repeat-two hours of this annoying chick talking to herself, saying no no no a lot, and being an all around idiot. The super 'green' and environmentally friendly aliens still use gas cars? (No spoiler; evident quickly) Only one example of this movie's completely moronic plothole problems. I took my girlfriend to this in theaters, spent thirty bucks, and contributed to future film atrocities by these producers. You have all been warned. "

,Sharak,2013-04-20T10:04Z,"A: 10, V:10. It is like DVD even better. How? I thought it was just released in the cinemas. Thank you! I LOVED this movie. Some won't like it, but I am sure most can appreciate it. "
,Sharak,2013-04-20T10:06Z,"This movie is about storyline and emotions, it is beautiful. You won't find a whole lot of action. Some people are ADD and get bored if there is not a bomb or gun going off every 30 seconds. This is not an action flick. It is a beautiful film. "
,pinoy23,2013-04-20T14:18Z,"Definitely could use a lot less kissing every guy she meets... lol

the audio and video are good..

the movie..meh"

,briebee72,2013-04-20T17:03Z,"Good quality even more so considering how this is or was still in theaters just the otherday. as for the movie BLAHHHH. aperently the aleins are whores kissing everything that walks. and 95% fo the movie is close ups of faces and desert how the hell did they spend 40 million making this piece of crap..  of yeah pointlessly useing high dollar lotus cars and chroming every car helicopter and motorcycle in the movie trying to make it look like the future.. im sure half the bidget was spend on the stupid  STORE...  hahaha watch the movie and you knwo what i mean.  I would rather watch the crow 2 and ben ""aflac"" as dare devil over and over and over in a 24 hour marathon followed by 3 michael moore documentries while the whole time not being aloowed to eat or drink and having to crap in a ziplock bag then watch this piece of crap movie again.   but oh it has feelings LOL  some woman must have wrote that comment.  why not let this bitch write the next aleins vs predator... they fall in love and start a day care then the laughs begine as the fumble through growing to know each other and raise their three kids . its  heart warming story .. but be carefull predator dont make alein laygh or acid shoots out her nose and .. UH HO  the comedy really begins. 

that will get the ladies to a sci fi film and fellas youll get laid that night for sure."

Let's be honest here folks: Anyone who gives the audio anything higher than a 6 should have their ears checked. Audio is tinny and hollow, like it was recorded through a tin can and some string. It's watchable, but just barely. "

,joe72637,2013-04-22T01:57Z,It seems as though Stephene Meyer's goal in life is to take my favorite genres and make them super Gay. First she took vampires and somehow made them even gayer than they already were now she's done it to aliens. Somebody needs to kill this bitch before she does it to superheros!

It's a good movie if you haven't read the book, but if you have, it's a bit of a disappointment. If you haven't read the book, watch this first, then read the book. A much better experience. "

Now before you go and start calling me a hater; I read the book about 5 years ago. The book was better than any stephanie meyer had written. And the movie did not do it justice at all. Even if I didnt read the book, the movie wasnt that great. They cast the wrong people. "
