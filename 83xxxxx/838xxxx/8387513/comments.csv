[V],CAPTAIN7SS,2013-04-19T01:01Z,...not a good idea....the files will be too big...most podcasts are at 48k...some are at 64k...levin is sent out at 32k....a 3 hour show around 50 mb's is about right....making it to about 100 mb's or more is too large for people and takes way too long to download...and upload.....i record it at 705k and then convert to 56k...i used to put it up at 48k....so the 56k is a much better sound...today's show was from a different station in texas and i may have had the volume up to hi to distort it...not sure....the station has a different sound....but it is 2 hours earlier than the one i usually get.....i could try it at 64k....that would be about 55k
