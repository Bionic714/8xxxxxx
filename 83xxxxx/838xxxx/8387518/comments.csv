After the first version came out with the Skidrow crack, not further cracks were necessary. Just copying over future patched files was all that was needed to patch this game. If you do copy over the included Bat-Team Steam_api.dll (which is the crack), then the saves will be in a different place."

but thanks for sharing mr.stifmeister :D"
,sixor,2013-04-28T04:24Z,"ok, update works, but since it have another crack, then it saves to another folder, you must transfer your old save to the new save folder

new
C:ProgramDataSteamRLD!

old
C:Usersmaodesk8AppDataLocalSKIDROW203160

then play some with the folders

also you can edit 
SKIDROW and steam_api to match your folder

the game seems to be running better and yes it needs to be patched a lot since it is a bugfest crap, the game is great but the bugs on pc are too much

thanks stiffmaister"
