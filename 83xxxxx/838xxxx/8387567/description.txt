Matt,Buckner (Elijah Wood) a visiting American drawn into the violent, smash-mouth ways of London's toughest football "firm" of diehard fans...and discovering a side to himself he didn't know existed. Hooligan leader (Charlie Hunnam) who mentors Buckner in the firm's code of conflict. And Lexi Alexander directs with head-butting intensity, taking us inside a rarely seen world of honor among thugs. Boozing, brawling - what else is there to life? The hard lesson Matt learns is that there's so very, very much more.
