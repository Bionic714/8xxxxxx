The Forza Horizon 1000 Club Expansion Pack is now available on Xbox LIVE as a free download, Turn 10 and Playground Games have announced.
The free DLC features more than 1,000 new challenges, ten new achievements worth 250 Gamerscore points, and two brand new bonus cars.
There are new challenges for every car in the game. Some focus on speed, such as racing through a speed camera as fast as you can, while others focus on driving skills or specific stunts such as burnouts, drifting, catching air, smashing objects, or weaving through traffic at high speeds.
There are also new location-based challenges that span the entire open world of Colorado - such as road trips, racking up skill points while exploring the golf course or mining town, or drifting your way around Red Rock's winding roads.
Most of the challenges can be completed with the on-disc car roster, but some (hundreds) will require the downloadable car packs. In addition, the new DLC features 1956 Ford F100 and the 1995 RUF CTR2.
