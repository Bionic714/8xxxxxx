,joegi50,2013-05-08T23:15Z,It is almost perfect. DTS Audio is a much better option for this wonderful movie. Thanks.

The TrueHD soundtrack included in this rip is the original TrueHD soundtrack from bluray disc. There was no DTS audio on disc. Not quite sure what you mean?

TrueHD is better and has higher bitrate than DTS and core DTS audio.

TrueHD and DTS-HD MA sounds just about the same. Both can handle very high bitrates and produce exellent soundtracks.
