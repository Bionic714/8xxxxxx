,Marikhen,2013-04-19T04:14Z,"Just as an FYI, this update ""fixes"" the ""bug"" with your bank that let you over-stuff it.  Unless you're willing to resort to using CheatEngine to modify the values in the future you probably shouldn't use this patch until it's required for something you actually want to use."
,rylgmr06,2013-04-19T07:27Z,Hacks are not meant for this game! ;)
,rylgmr06,2013-04-20T13:34Z,"Yeah, it's very fun!"
,dragonsonata,2013-04-28T23:36Z,"I install and the game works great, able to use LAN with tunngle and everything.
But my version still says 1.4.0 and I can't join most 1.5.0 games.
Can you help me out?"
,rylgmr06,2013-04-29T02:13Z,Ensure you install it to the right directory!
,paperboy666,2013-05-03T02:36Z,does this works with skidrow version? do i need previous updates? can i install this and then the dlcs?
,rylgmr06,2013-05-04T04:52Z,Yes. Yes. First install the DLCs then this!
,noekk,2013-05-04T18:09Z,"Hi guys, this is how I do a fresh install:

1) install borderlands 2 (skidrow)
2) install update (1.5.0)
3) install mr. torgues campaign of carnage (skidrow)
4) install sir hammerlocks big game hunt (skidrow)
5) copy crack files from update (1.5.0)
6) run steam registry file .reg (if you don't have steam installed)

For me, (on Win8 x86 and x64) this works perfectly without doing anything special or using any additional files.

I hope it works for you too."
,jadrdc,2013-05-09T20:31Z,"My character don't get exp points to lvl up. It's like the first one, you only lvl up at the DLC's maps?"
,jadrdc,2013-05-10T00:11Z,"Sorry, it's me again. I don't have the Psycho character too and there's nothing in the eridium store. I install this the correctly. I'll be gratefull for the reply"
,Drsavation,2013-05-13T23:52Z,"Sorry sir, but after the installation of this, i had to download a lot of dlls to fix errors with the launcher, and now i got the error ""Failed to find default engine . ini to retrieve My Documents subdirectory to use.Force quitting"". Can you help me fix this? i have the file already."
,jadrdc,2013-05-14T23:40Z,I installed everything again and my character is now gaining xp and theres the new stuff in the eridium store. But i can't play with Krieg and use the new costumes i must purchase it says. So if someone could help me i'll be gratefull.
,rylgmr06,2013-05-15T13:20Z,"I think you haven't installed it correctly. Check your ingame version (""find games"").
Or are you using a legit steam copy? In that case use this unlocker:

,jadrdc,2013-05-15T16:54Z,Thanks for the reply rylgmr06. When i copy the dll's the game won't open. Yes my steam is the legit and i use windows 7. I'm sorry to bother you with this but could you help me by skype? If you do search this nickname Tiffosi Gatto the image is doraemon eating a cake. Thanks again for the reply cheers.
,Valaice,2013-05-16T04:06Z,"So I did this 

1) install borderlands 2 (skidrow)
2) install update (1.5.0)
3) install mr. torgues campaign of carnage (skidrow)
4) install sir hammerlocks big game hunt (skidrow)
5) copy crack files from update (1.5.0) 

with two computers, following the same exact sequence, and it says that they are different versions? any help?"
,mehul3121996,2013-05-17T12:11Z,"Okay RoyalGamer, i have a question. My history:
1.I installed ""skidrow borderlands 2""
2.Then I installed your torrent called ""Borderlands.2.Update.14.Incl.Hotfix.&.8.DLC-BlackEcho""
3.Now to install this do i have to do a complete new install of the game and dlc, or just install it into the current directory?"
,wrecktem,2013-06-01T01:11Z,It doesn't seem like this patch includes the Ultimate Vault Hunter mode patch. I'm not gaining experience in UVHM.
,rylgmr06,2013-06-03T22:15Z,"If u already are in the UTVHM, you are already playing the DLC >_"
