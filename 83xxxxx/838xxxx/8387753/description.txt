The Hebrew Alphabet is made up of 22 letters.Learn the Hebrew letters of the Bible and you can start to learn the words of the Bible.When you study the Bible from a Hebrew perspective-all sorts of Hidden Treasures will be revealed to you.

In the English Bible- Rev 1:11 "I am the Alpha and Omega"-that is Greek.Is our God Greek? Our God is the King of the Jews. He really said, "I am the Aleph and Tav".

Consider that the word Alphabet comes from the 1st Hebrew letters "Aleph and Beit". Hebrew was the first language spoken.God spoke the world into existence.

This study will focus on the 3rd Hebrew letter-Gimmel.I pray that these lessons will bring you "Truth" and "Understanding". Christians need to understand "Fullness of the Gentiles" can refer to a set number. There are plenty of Christians in the world that have a warped understanding of the Bible.They are growing by large numbers. The key is are there a growing number of Christians that have a proper understanding of the Bible.If your church is PC or believes that Christians have replaced the Jews-it is time to actually study the Bible.Make a copy of the El Shaddai notes, they go along with the video.The 2 other videos offer some info. But El Shaddai is the best source to use.

All the El Shaddai videos and notes are free to anyone by going to the El Shaddai ministries website.Then scroll down and click on ARCHIVES.Then you look through the past teaching.It takes some searching.

 I am just trying to make it easier for more people to share this information. I encourage you to share this with others and support El Shaddai ministries, if you can.


Please leave a comment if you find these lessons helpful.If there is interest, I will add more lessons. 

There are dark days coming to this world. I believe we must be a blessing to Israel for God to bless us. Be weary of people who think they have replaced the Jews or want to persecute the Jews.
