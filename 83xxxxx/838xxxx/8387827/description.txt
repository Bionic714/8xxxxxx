"Edgar came up with a huge hit in 1973, with "Frankenstein", from They Only Come Out at Night, heavy rock recorded with the band that included Derringer. He's never repeated that success, however. ****
- Dave Marsh, Rolling Stone

"This may be heavy, but it's fast, which means real rock and roll after the attempted progress and hyperboogie. And instead of hyperthyroid Jerry LaCroix we get Dan Hartman, who knows enough about songs to come up with "Free Ride," and Ronnie Montrose, who knows enough about guitar to get by. Not only that, but Edgar's found a midrange. And not only that but he wears lipstick, eye makeup, and a cheek stud on the cover." B
