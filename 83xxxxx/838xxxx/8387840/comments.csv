,jalucian,2013-04-19T09:30Z,576p is not HD. You continue to post 576p material in the HD section even after many of your other 576p encodes have been moved out of the HD category by staff.
,BasilBrush,2013-04-26T20:20Z,"The size of the encode is independant of the source. If the source is HD then it goes in the HD category. If the size was 468p and the source was HD then it goes in the HD category. The file is clearly marked.

If you take a look at the spec you'll see that the size is much smaller than equivalent 720p files. The idea of 576p is to keep the size down but the quality up.
