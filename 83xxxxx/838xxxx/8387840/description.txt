Sociopolitical Documentary hosted by Sean Gilder, published by Channel 4 broadcasted as part of CH4 Dispatches series in 2013 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

Olly Lambert spent weeks living deep inside Syrian territory - with both government and opposition supporters - to explore how the two-year-old conflict is tearing communities apart. This unprecedented film witnesses first-hand how the country is collapsing into a sectarian conflict and faces a bleak future. Lambert is the first western journalist to spend such an extended period filming on both sides of Syria's sectarian and political divide. For five weeks he lived in the Orontes River Valley in rural Hama, an almost entirely unreported front line that is fast becoming a microcosm of what Syria will become if the regime of Bashar al Assad finally falls. His film is a graphic and unflinching portrait of a society cleaving apart in the face of dwindling international support, escalating violence and a growing mutual desire for revenge.
