Thinking governments are gonna steal your guns, the UN is the enemy and obama is satan...

Put your effort into helping people and building trust in your community instead of finding ways for criminals to get weapons for free."
,rocksburys_mom,2013-04-24T02:44Z,Please excuse my son's comment. He hasnt done anything in life and resorts to hating on others who have done work. He hates seeing other people do projects that get global recognition because the only thing he has done is download pornography off this website and then goes to masturbate. I wish my son was more like Defense Distributed.

LMAO  -  You fool.

Personally, I can appreciate the Idealistic thought that the world should be free. Information should be free. And even possibly questionable information should be freely distributed. Our own governments are the risk of the future. The power and liberty of the people must always be maintained unless we wish to lose those freedoms. Doing nothing and being complacent will allow authorities or assumed authorities to run over the freedoms and rights of the people.

I support the distribution of these files from a political stand point.

With regard to the ""Physibles"" category on TPB,
My only question is... 

Is this Defdist, with it's various versions, the only type of physible that people are interested in these days? 

Come on people, surely there are more designs that we could upload or request to be uploaded to TPB. With the advent of 3D printing, surely someone MUST want to share more files than just these.

In addition to 3D Print files please start uploading CNC and 2D files for laser cutter/router tables etc... There is a whole world of these files out there and very few are making their way to TPB. "

,noybinhd,2013-05-07T00:30Z,"I think these printable guns are cool as shit and look forward to trying them out. 

That does not make me a right wing gun nut though. The idea that the government is going to turn tyrannical and come after us ... is a FANTASY. 

Our government is elected civilians. 
Our military is a volunteer civilian army.
Our cops are civilians (C)itizen (O)n (P)atrol

Pretending there is some big government with some unknown army they are apparently hiding ... and they are coming for us ... is just paranoid fantasy."

,mathiasthebold,2013-05-10T13:30Z,"Yes, this torrent now has historic significance. I was kicking myself for not having taken the opportunity to procure the contents of Defcad.org. I'd had it on my favorites list for some time but never got around to it. Now the Piratebay has, as usual, come through. Let Freedom Ring! Thanks to the uploader. You're a hero."

Huge kudos to everyone for sharing and seeding!

YOU are the pillar of civilization that governments are powerless to destroy!"
,LOLicopter,2013-05-11T08:40Z,"""The idea that the government is going to turn tyrannical and come after us ... is a FANTASY.""

Right, because governments have never turned tyrannical before.

LOL!

""Our government is elected civilians.""

And?  What kind of silly, half-baked attempt at an argument is this?  Is there some reason to believe politicians who come from the civilian ranks can't behave tyrannically?  After all, Stalin and Hitler were civilians at one time.

""Our military is a volunteer civilian army.""

Again, so?  What would prevent a volunteer civilian army from carrying out tyrannical orders?  Wishful thinking?

""Our cops are civilians(C)itizen (O)n (P)atrol.""

So what?  What does any of this ""but, but, but civilians!"" crap prove?

""Pretending there is some big government some unknown army they are apparently hiding ... and they are coming for us ... is just paranoid fantasy.""

LOL, nice straw man."
,Solcis,2013-05-11T12:07Z,"Uh huh. I guess the Department of Homeland Security (240,000 personnel) and the Transportation Security Administration (55,000 personnel) are ""some unknown army"" that's ""hiding"". You know, the civilians that are already armed with hundreds of millions of hollow point bullets, and who stand to receive about a billion more.

Nothing to see here. If you worry about the rampant abuse of power of other regimes in other countries, and somehow think the same will happen here, you're just a raving, paranoid loser. Got it.

,Bonesman1990,2013-05-12T20:36Z,"Welcome to the New American Century

The leftist Libtards don't like it when the world is able to blow their brains out for their loud mouths, constant neediness, and traitorous notions of good government.

If the Right/Right will just take up arms to destroy the Wrong/Left, America would be a better place to live, work and play.

DEconstruct the reconstruction and rid America of the ""parasite"" class that keeps electing these pussified socialist nanny staters, with their rose-colored dreams of peace and love among all of humanity; an impossibility so long as THEY exist.

When civil war comes again (and it IS on its way), be sure to aim for the Liberal/Democrat/Neocon traitors first! It will be ammo well spent!

,AlexLibman,2013-05-14T22:20Z,Can't post comments.  Testing with a short comment.
,AlexLibman,2013-05-14T22:22Z,"@rocksbury...

Your comment is completely detached from reality.  

Governments *are* stealing guns - that's a fact documented a million times over, in dozens of different countries, and it is a part of the socialist (''liberal'' / ''progressive'' / ''green'' / ''Democrat'') agenda here in US.  The UN *is* pushing legislation that would make USA far less free.  And Obama is indeed a socialist relative even to USA's mainstream politics, and his policies are taking this country in the wrong direction.  Criminals already have guns, and most of them work for the government.  This is about balance of power - free people must have a way of defending themselves, which also makes further increases of government a lot more expensive to implement."
,AlexLibman,2013-05-14T22:23Z,"(OK, I think there's a length limit.  Continued from previous comment.)

Having a gun does not prevent you from ''helping people'' - just the opposite, it empowers you to protect your neighbors from government tyranny and crime.  As for ''building trust in your community'' by individual disempowerment - that is nothing but irrational collectivist blind faith, which historically leads to very bad consequences."
,Teh_Frm4terer,2013-05-28T12:38Z,"Okay, that's it. You gone damn done and made me comment on a torrent.

Dear Americans (and other countries with Second Amendment type bullshit),

Down here in Australia, we have this pretty sweet system in which anyone can buy guns! (I know right, it's pretty sweet). Now I say 'anyone' with a grain of salt.

You see, in order to get a gun in a backward, ""lefty"", ""green"", ""socialist"" country like ours, a person who wants to own a firearm of any sort jumps through a few hoops so that we know they aren't batshit insane, ex-criminals or might go and shoot out a primary school! This includes psychological evaluation, gun safety training and the like. They also have to have to provide a 'Genuine Reason' they want a gun, whether that be hunting, collecting etc. Any sane person can jump these hoops, as long as they can be bothered putting in the time and effort.

Afterwards, that person gets a Firearms License! They can then buy a personal selection of guns, up to a certain number and degree of danger.

We still have gun stores. We still have gun ranges. You can still protect your family personally, if you feel it's necessary. Most people don't bother, because our police are trained to protect us, and if there was anything particularly dangerous happening, they can help us most effectively if we aren't pulling out our guns to help. In my 21 years in this country, I've seen maybe one citizen with a gun, and it was holstered. No gun violence, no shootouts, nothing. And guess what? The government haven't come to quash our freedoms. Last I checked, no paramilitary troops have kicked down my door to demand I kneel to their every evil whim.

Was this gun control behaviour a long-held byproduct of our old culture? No! After the Port Arthur massacre in 1996, we as a country decided that we weren't going to let another 35 people die at the hands of some lunatic with a weapon. 

Guns aren't freedom, anymore than guns are evil. Guns are dangerous weapons, and should be treated so. You want one? Prove you're responsible with one. 

That said, I agree with TPB's policy on free information, so as far as the 3D printed guns go, it would be against my morals to argue against them being here. This rant was more to do with the reasons they should be available, I guess."
,Bonesman1990,2013-06-07T06:28Z,"The world can go in any direction its herd chooses. America, on the OTHER hand, is going to make some changes to our globalist policy of ""retard see, retard do"" in preference of clinging to American tradition and the values engrained in OUR Constitution.

The rest of you parasites won't be suckling our economic teet for much longer. And once your overlords/heroes face the resulting drastic budget and pay cuts, you may notice the requisite changes in their behavior toward the sheep (i.e. YOU) they have conditioned to submit to their ""every evil whim"" as if it were ordained by God Himself.

To a masochist, torture and abuse is the status-quo. Enjoy serving your well-armed masters. "
