"Side one of Atom Heart Mother is an orchestral rethinking of the studio sides of Ummagumma. Not unlike something by the middle-period Deep Purple, Floyd breaks up into its components soloists and sets them in the context of a large orchestra playing a score of light classical fanfares. Even the several avant garde sections late on the side fail to redeem the music's middle-brow pretensions. Side two is a rehash of ballad ideas left over from the Movie scores." **

"Believe it or not, the, er, suite on the first side is easier to take than the, gawd, songs on the second. Yeah, they do leave the singing to an anonymous semi classical chorus, and yeah, they probably did get the horns for the fanfares at the same hiring hall. But at least the suite provides a few of the hypnotic melodies that made Ummagumma such an admirable record to fall asleep to." D+
