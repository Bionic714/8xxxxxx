,BKKJack,2013-04-19T08:57Z,"I worked at an Embassy in BKK (I won't say which one) for 9 years and we'd deal with around 5 cases like this a WEEK!

Golden Rules: 

1) If it seems to good to be true then there's a 99% chance that isn't true...
2) Use the same common sense you would use at home. Don't marry a whore. You wouldn't do it at home, don't do it in Thailand.
3) Never forget that with a Bar Girl, it is a purely financial arrangement and that YOU are the boss.  
Live where you want to, not where she wants you to. Do what you want to do, not what she wants you to so. 
4) Never do as this idiot did and throw all your eggs in one basket.
5) Be aware that not all Thai prostitutes and bloodsuckers work in bars. Some are very cunning indeed.

Just why people come here year in, year out and  get into these messes is beyond me especially in this internet age, when cyberspace is rammed full of horror tales and warnings....
There are bars all over most main tourist resorts full of fanny. Why not just plug a few each week, keep your brass safe and enjoy your retirement. "
