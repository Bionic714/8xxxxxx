Its only good use is as a pacifier for Twilight fans, but any non-fans should stay at least twenty yards away, or better yet, toss all the Twilight losers into a Sarlacc pit along with every existing copy of this 'film.' You have been warned."
,deathcap,2013-04-20T09:55Z,not really a twilight fan except i liked the books before all these lunatics got all fanatical about twilight. The movies sucked but the books were alright. The Host is way better though. Just like twilight though the books way better then the film. This copies good thoug quality wise. A-10 V-10 i wouldnt say the movie sucked though it was alright with the exception of some of the acting made me lose some interest at some points.
