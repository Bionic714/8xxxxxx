This pilot for James Franciscus' fourth TV series was also 
a reunion for him and guest star John McIntire, who played cop partners 
in the first season of "Naked City" 11 years earlier. 
Ironically, John's character's first name in this show is again Dan!

Martine Beswick played Mike Longstreet's sexy assistant Nicki Bell.
The producers replaced her with Marlyn Mason in the role. Maybe that
was because Martine was busy filming "Dr. Jeckyll and Sister Hyde" in England.

One thing unique about the pilot is that Longstreet has an electronic cane
that produces audio beeps to assist him. By the start of the series
he has an ordinary cane still used by the blind to this day.
