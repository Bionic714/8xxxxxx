 In Nano Assault, players blast their way through 32 twisted cell stages and
 dark worlds with rugged landscapes that adjust in difficulty based on the
 player's skill level. Prepare to battle and defeat extreme nemeses including
 the Black Nucleus, Hyper Blobs and Spore Plants using powerful beams, energetic
 bombs and other unlockable assault weapons. To ensure successful missions,
 players can clone and respawn themselves to continue the journey anytime.
 Special features include Missions Mode, an unlockable arcade style cell stage
 where players must beat the clock by destroying the most enemies,
 and Hall of Fame, a bragging rights leaderboard where players can publish and
 compare high level scores with friends. Additionally, players will be able to
 use the StreetPass feature to trade unlocked content.
