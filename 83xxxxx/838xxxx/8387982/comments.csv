,Pdid,2013-04-19T23:44Z,This movie is the worst. Alien invasion would be super-sweet compared to ever having to view this garbage again. I took my girlfriend to the theater and lost time and money and regret-immensely-losing both. Do not do the same. You have been warned.
,TDWPx210,2013-04-21T21:23Z,@Pdid Then why are you here? why would you bother searching the movie? you do know everyone has different opinions on movies right. No one cares about your opinion all we want to know is how the quality is.
