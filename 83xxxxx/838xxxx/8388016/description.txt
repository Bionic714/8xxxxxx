Dr. Heller's book strips away the invisible workings behind most of these programs and takes the mystery out of hypnosis at the same time. The book was clearly written for the benefit of therapists, from Heller's course "Clinical Hypnosis: Innovative Techniques ┬½", however it is extremely well written and accessible to even the most inexperienced layman.

Rather than being a skeptical treatise on the impossibility of hypnosis, the book takes a deep look at our preferred modes of communication and describes practical methods for matching those modes to produce everything from "instant rapport" to deep hypnosis.
