This Brazilian drama chronicles the lives between three female roommates sharing an apartment in Vitoria, Brazil. Former music teacher Gertrudes is hiding from the world after her lover spurns her. Magdalena is a free spirit. By day she works in a mental hospital; at night she is out in search of men. Lucia is the third, and most troubled roommate. To get Gertrudes to mother her, Lucia pretends she is mentally ill. Her ploy works and she and the older woman frequently get involved in mother/daughter games.
