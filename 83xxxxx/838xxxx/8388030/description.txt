Novatix ExplorerPlus v6.2 - SUPER FAST replacement for PowerDesk 6!
Full retail version, no key or crack required!  

Great news for PowerDesk users!  Finally found a copy of this equivalent software, thought I'd upload it, this should replace a torrent I found that's dead unfortunately.

This is a branch-off of PowerDesk 5 by the original programmer of PowerDesk (owned by Mijenix, Ontrack, V-Com, Avanquest, ad nausium....:^).  He went and formed a new Novatix company, produced ExplorerPlus, then it went back to V-Com for ver 6.  See some of the history in the included web pages.

If you're reading this, I'm assuming you're already a PowerDesk user.  I've been using PowerDesk since ver 3.  Features almost exactly comparable to PowerDesk 6.0, except ExplorerPlus is Lightning fast in comparision, and no crashes or glitches!  

Opens in a flash, WinSys32 folder displays in a couple seconds.  Picture thumbnails pop up fast, big photos appear in the Preview Pane almost instantly.  A big plus to me is it doesn't make you wait while loading the thumbnails and pictures like PD6 does, you can interrupt the process and click another folder or picture.  Only thing missing is Size Manager, just grab it from any version of PowerDesk.

Tested in Win XP SP3.

If at some point you need a reseed, leave me a comment.  I'll check back here now and then, and reseed it if needed.

Cheers!
