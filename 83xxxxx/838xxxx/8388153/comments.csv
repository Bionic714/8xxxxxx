,darkko,2013-04-19T09:09Z,Not much point uploading a torrent and then not seeding it. :/
,darkko,2013-04-20T03:26Z,"seriously?
no seeding whatsoever?"
,tbtelly,2013-04-25T03:02Z,@darkko I must have done something wrong as it does not say seeding on torrent but downloading 0.0%.....should I redo it?
,darkko,2013-04-29T02:17Z,"@tbtelly,

i saw that you uploaded this movie again. the other torrent works just fine.

thanks so much!"
