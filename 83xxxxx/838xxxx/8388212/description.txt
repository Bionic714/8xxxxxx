Summary

00:08 - Meeting People on the street is not the most uncommon thing in the world
00:14 - Women are naturally hesitant about many things
00:30 - Guys think they're being rejected, this isn't nearly the case.
00:36 - Girls want to respond, but society says differently
00:50 - Society labeling girls as "sluts" is complete bullshit
01:04 - How can you tell if she wants to continue forward?
01:18 - It's all in the smile: usually means yes
01:25 - Look for the genuine smile: watch for the laugh
01:38 - You have to find different ANGLES to get her to smile
02:02 - If she says no, find a new angle, say something / do something else
02:19 - The reason it works is because you're being persistent
02:30 - This goes for anything
02:37 - If she says no with no smile, don't go: back off
02:46 - If she says yes with a smile, keep going
02:52 - The Approach
11:10 - Breakdown
11:25 - Default Angle move to get girls off the phone
11:48 - Tell her friend that she'll call her back in 5 minutes: want to get the girl attracted to you before her friends arrive
12:00 - Also, it makes her feel she's not ditching her friend (if she says call her back in 5 minutes)
12:19 - Hang up the phone for her; shows balls
12:37 - Smiled while I did it, so it was justified for me to do it
12:53 - Angle, to get her distracted by discussing
13:10 - Though rude, she found it very funny
13:32 - Another angle: trying to make the main girl give her friend the phone, so I can have more alone time with her
13:45 - Get cockblocked and don't succeed
13:50 - The point is to say what you want her to do in different ways (angles) because itΓÇÖll mak things more fun & sheΓÇÖll be more likely to do it
14:29 - I see a bunch of her friends coming over, so I get the number ASAP. Because once her friends arrive it's going to be harder to do anything else with her
14:44 - Goes for the kiss and she says no ΓÇô but is smiling, which meansΓÇª
14:55 - Second angle: close her eyes but not kiss her
15:07 - Third angle: just a peck on the lips
15:27 - Fourth angle: only one way to find out
15:45 - Another angle: trying to marry her
15:48 - Getting her friends permission is key so she doesn't feel like she's too easy
16:19 - The best way to deal with her cockblocking friend, is to make the cockblock laugh
16:49 - The disgusting angle
17:26 - The kissing on the cheek technique
17:39 - A few spots to increase my chance
17:48 - Try what you want to try, using different angles
18:01 - Change your reasoning to persuade her to do the same thing, but in a different way

There are going to be times when you approach a girl and she will reject your advances, but not in a way to tell you to go away. Instead, her rejection is a test to see how persistent you can be with your advance. The idea though is not to keep saying or doing the same thing over and over, rather you need to change your actions and the things you say so you can keep the interaction alive: you need to find different angles to complete the advance.
