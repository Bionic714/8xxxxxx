Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site :: On the Thursday, April 18 edition of The Alex Jones Show, Alex lays out the huge victory Infowars had yesterday in identifying several members of the Boston Marathon crowd that looked highly suspicious, even though a supposed arrest had already been made. Quite possibly, Infowars, with help from crowd sourced sites and a treasure trove of independent photos, may have held a huge part in destroying the official narrative the government intended to run with. We'll also examine the explosion at a West Texas fertilizer plant that killed as many as 15 people and injured more than 160. 

On today's show, Alex welcomes American broadcaster, filmmaker and financial analyst Max Keiser to discuss the drastic fall of gold and silver prices and what that means for the dollar and world economies in the long run.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
