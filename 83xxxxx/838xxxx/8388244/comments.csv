,microload,2013-04-23T03:30Z,"If you guys check out my profile, i'll be uploading project go + podcasts + Q&A on weekly basis from now on. 

I noticed a lot of these guys don't have the podcasts and Q&A and it sucks because they have tremendous value. 

Plus, when they come out with anything new i'll try and have it up as soon as possible. "

I can see the comments to the simple 30 day 1 challenge. I am using NoRedirect, but I can't see the video. Can anyone of you see the video? Has anyone of you with computer skills an idea how to make them visible?
Cheers."
