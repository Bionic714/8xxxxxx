In this episode you'll see an interaction where Jason doesn't vibe well with his girl. However, he then goes to show you that you cannot leave the approach or bounce out just because the girl may be boring, can't speak english, or any other trait she has that is turning you off. The point is to tell yourself to keep going because you need to make things second nature, you need to make sure that everything you're doing becomes a habit so you don't even have to think about the next steps you make when you meet a girl who you vibe very well with.
