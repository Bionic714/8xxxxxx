,bgg1175,2013-04-19T05:30Z,"Moore's Superman story gets #1. Weird how we value writers who deconstruct the creations of other writers more than those who write entertaining stories. We confuse deconstruction with creativity. 

There were hundreds of Superman stories from Maggin and Bates that were far better than Moore's. 
And as a writer its harder to write the stories of Maggin and Bates and later Byrne than it is to just come in and break things like Moore did.  "
[V],blackcanary,2013-04-19T06:08Z,Thank you so much for this CeraKesh!
,smokey8,2013-04-19T10:58Z,"@bgg1175 

As long as Moore has written for a character, his story will likely be voted #1 in fan votes. Most comic book fans are blind to Moore's poor writing and just buy into his hype because OMG WATCHMEN!!! "
,bgg1175,2013-04-19T14:34Z,"@smokey8 Watchmen was a nice comic but it also just Moore deconstruction of the superhero The JL and JS in particular. It was originally supposed to be the Charlton Heroes acquired by DC. 

From a writing standpoint its harder to stay within boundaries and create entertaining stories more than it is to come in and be allowed to leave those boundaries which is all Moore did. 

Every Comic has its barriers you dont cross but if some ""popular"" writer gets a comic they get to cross those lines and people think its great writing. 

Moore simply could not write an entertaining story in Superman at that time if he had to play by the same rules as others. "
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-19T14:48Z,"bgg1175, your statement ""We confuse deconstruction with creativity"" is so true! perhaps the CBR list should've been called ""favorite"" rather than ""greatest"", because it was only a fan-vote.

smokey8, i think that's a bit nearsighted. speaking for myself, i like moore for many different works. (swamp thing and supreme are my personal favorites.) i think a lot of people today don't, or choose not to, remember what comics were like in 1980. put into perspective of what others were writing then, he has done groundbreaking, intelligent work that ""raised the bar""."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-19T14:55Z,"bgg1175, i just saw your second post!

have you read dc comics presents #85 by moore and veitch? or the supreme issues he wrote for image? -- the latter was, in many ways, a silver-age superman story. although i think it is deconstructionist, as well."
,bgg1175,2013-04-19T15:38Z,"@ STFmaryville I read that DC Presents story and it may be in one of my TPBs but I vaguely remember it. Something about Superman with a virus and Swamp Thing cures him. 
Moore did do one good Superman story about his b-day gift though.  
But I look at writers like Moore, artists/so called writers like Liefeld and others like the kid we all knew who had neat toys but for some reason couldnt play with them. So they would just break them. 
Those guys come into Marvel or DC and they cant create so they break. But as long as its called ""DARK"" people think theyre getting something cool. 

But the most popular writers of comics today could not function as writers if they had to work within the barriers guys like Lee, Wein, O'Neill, Bates, Maggin and Byrne worked in and create entertaining stories.

Its not a coincidence that most Marvel films and animation use stories pre '85 or so and then reboot and start over. "
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-19T18:06Z,"true true, i think you'd like his supreme work, because he approached it as a commentary on revisionism and the ""differences"" -- some better, most of them worse -- between the pre-1985 and post-1985 superman.

anyway, totally agree about writers who do the month-in, month-out grind having a harder row to hoe... coming in and blowing everything up to re-boot or repackage as a new #1 isn't as difficult as writing something interesting for #283."
,bgg1175,2013-04-19T19:07Z,"@STFmaryville I'll check out his Supreme stuff. I just started torrenting his run from your uploads. 
I read maybe 2 issues of Supreme back when Image was hot but always late and comics could still be found in grocery stores. 
Thats where I saw one and bought it. It was one of the 1st few issues. Wasnt that impressed with the art. I remember the guy was Brian-?. 
"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-19T20:35Z,"oh yeah brian murray, who did most of the art on #1-11. he was awful. thankfully the alan moore run is almost 100% murray-free, he only did a pin-up in #50.

having said that, the art team changes a lot during the moore run, some (like chris sprouse) were great, and some were bad (joe bennett, rob liefeld). rick veitch does a lot of flashback scenes, in a silver age style.

i was exactly like you, i had #3 and #4 when i was young and they were terrible. but i bought #41 (the 1st moore issue) because it had a painted jerry ordway cover, and i was a fan of his superman & power of shazam art.

even today i'm still seeding that torrent, by the way. so you shouldn't have any trouble getting them to d/l."
,gldnarm66,2013-04-21T16:38Z,Why isn't the uploader seeding?
,tdurden83,2013-04-21T23:12Z,"I like the lively debate. I just want to chime in to stick up for watchmen real quick. Considering when it was written, I think that book deserves every bit of praise it gets. I'm not saying that it isn't overused today, but when it's done right, like with watchmen, I love it when writers delve into the psychological motives behind character's actions"
,tdurden83,2013-04-22T00:23Z,"oh ya, thanks for the upload. plz seed."
,CeraKesh,2013-04-22T01:52Z,"I think there's some good points here.  Alan Moore is over-rated and over-celebrated.  That said, over-rated does not mean ""bad"".  I find him to be an extremely good author, just not as good as most of the shallow-reading casual fandom would find him to be with their narrow experience and lack of serious thought on the subject.  I think this also applies to Neil Gaiman and Joss Whedon, too, though I love their work as well (but that's beside the point)
I agree that it takes more effort and skill to create rather than deconstruct.  But I think that deconstruction takes a different kind of perspective and does require significant creativity.  And deconstruction aside, Moore's writing is still extremely good.  Deconstruction does not always result in destruction, that's only one stop on the way to recreation (albeit in another form).  I don't respect it as much as strict creation but it certainly is a valid approach to storytelling."
,evillvi,2013-04-23T04:02Z,thanks for the upload but can we please get someone to seed?
,ChingaTuu,2013-04-23T08:02Z,"...Otay kids, where are the seeders for this one. TPB claims there's two, Vuze says 0 of 0. I'm about one day from punting this one, because I've been stuck at 76,7% for a full day now.

STFM, you got a clue here on this one?"
,ChingaTuu,2013-04-23T21:36Z,"...417 ""leechers"" now and *NO* seeders?

This has gotten fracking ridiculous."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-24T00:52Z,"i think CeraKesh is seeding it, just not 24/7... and i don't think there are enough (if any) people who've been able to get the full 8.6 GiB. hopefully another day or two and i'll get to 100% -- at 80.3% now..."
,tdurden83,2013-04-24T01:22Z,yep. slow and steady like.
,ChingaTuu,2013-04-24T01:25Z,"...Hell, I don't think he's even seeding it .025/7. Not to be an unappreciative leech, but he could have at least seeded long enough for at least 4-5 new seeds, because the only other seeder took off almost as fast as he started seeding!

Ah well, I'll give him another day, seeing as how I'm still feeding to new peers. Up to 422 now, so maybe we'll hit a record in a day or two...:P"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-25T01:48Z,i've made it to 91.1% .......home straightaway!  :-)
,ChingaTuu,2013-04-25T05:29Z,"...93.7%. I may actually seed this for a week at a high speed just to help those 406 leechers get this damn thing. And that's 25/8 not 24/7, either."
,ChingaTuu,2013-04-25T19:25Z,"...Otay, it finally finished. I'll leave it as a seed for the rest of the month. CeraKesh, next time you seed something, seed it for a full 48 hours after it first finishes uploading. Sure would have helped getting a few seeders going earlier."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-28T04:12Z,"i'm helping seed it too, now! it's truly a great compilation. thanks again CeraKesh"
