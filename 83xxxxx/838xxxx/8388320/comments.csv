,MrSammich,2013-04-22T23:16Z,"Hi STFmaryville I really want to start reading Ultimate Spider-Man but I could only find good Empire scans on usenets up to 71, is there any chance you could find and upload them? Thanks :) "
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-23T14:35Z,"MrSammich, since this came out 2 weeks ago  http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8361900/  i don't think ultimate spidey needs another torrent. 

alternatively, this torrent is pretty good:  http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/4585512/  (It has all the issues from 2000 until just before the 2009 crossover Ultimatum.)"
