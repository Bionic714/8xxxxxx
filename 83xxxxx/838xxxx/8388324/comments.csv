This is the only ""Doctor Who"" ever that SHOULD be at 23.976 fps (or 29.97 fps interlaced) - it was shot in Vancouver, BC, on film, at 24 fps, and the effects were done on video at 29.97 fps.

(All other DW is shot at 25fps since it's a UK series, and the UK's PAL standard is 25fps. This is also an issue with ""Torchwood: Miracle Day"" - it was shot in the US at 24fps instead of the 25fps of Series 1-3.)

However, for one reason or another, the only version that's ever been released on DVD is the 25fps version.  Even the US DVD uses the same type of standards-conversion as the other DW DVDs, meaning it's just 25fps pulled down to 29.97fps, not 25fps slowed down to 24fps.

So what does this mean?

It means that all available versions of this run 4% faster than they're meant to.  And the pitch of everyone's voice is 4% higher than it should be (going from this to Paul McGann's normal pitch in the Eighth Doctor Big Finish audios can be jarring).

So I guess my point is, if you have software that allows you to either slow it down 4%, or play at 24fps and slow the audio down to accommodate (WITHOUT ""fixing"" the pitch, as it SHOULD drop 4% as well), then do that.

If not, no big deal - it's only 4%, and the pitch alteration likely won't bother most people.  Just figured I'd educate folks!

I've actually been working on a proper-speed version of this, but the problem is the way it was converted from 29.97 to 25fps in the first place. It baked-in quite a few awkward interlacing artifacts that are now a challenge to get rid of. I'm working on it, though, and I'll post it to TPB as soon as it's done (in DVD-9, MKV, MP4, and AVI formats).

I'd also like to take this opportunity to say thank you very much for these torrents, whoever you are - they're the best quality classic ""Doctor Who"" torrents I've ever come across.  Sure, they're re-sized to 640x480, but that's not that big of a deal since you preserve the 25fps framerate (which NO ONE else does for some reason).

Combine your torrents with http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8163053/Doctor_Who_-_Loose_Cannon_Reconstructions_of_Lost_Episodes and you have the definitive ""Doctor Who"" collection!"
