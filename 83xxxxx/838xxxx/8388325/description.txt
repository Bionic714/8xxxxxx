RESEED (I will seed this for one week)

WARNING: This is a very early (possibly the earliest) live recording. There were major problems on the first 5 tracks where you can barely hear the vocals. It is what it is.

 Do not sell this recording.
 Share freely and losslessly.
 For a Mann, Aimee is one nice woman. (inside and out).
 and if you want to hear her sing, 
 you don't have to wait until Tuesday.
 (only until the soundperson gets it together in track 5.)
comments:
  since there is no official live recording of 'Til Tuesday, 
(only 1 2004 Aimee Mann live CD/DVD, without 'Til Tuesday) 
and the earliest listing in etree is for Oct. 1984, in 
Manchester, New Hampshire (U.S.A.) this may be the 
earliest full show live FM broadcast they did. 
Spit was located in a corner of the Metro, next to Axis, 
another seeding ground for unknown Boston area locals.
  the 1st two songs here have weakly mixed Aimee vocals, maybe
part of why I couldn't figure out the titles of those songs,
which is too bad since she is the lead singer, and a good one.
after that it gets better. otherwise the sound is pretty good.
maybe someone more familiar with them could figure out what 
these ? songs are. It's a fine early set from one of Boston's
favorite singers. It was already quite obvious here that this 
group has talent for catchy pop tunes and vocals. I did my
best with the titles. there is a cut in the recording about 
20 min. into the show for no apparent reason, but it was after 
a song and it cut back in before the next one started so you 
may not even notice it. the cassette was flipped after voices 
carry. nothing is missing from the show. 'Til Tuesday may never 
rival Garth Brooks or Britney Spears for popularity, but this is
a pretty big band to be playing a club about the size of a bedroom.
this is a totally up close and personal show with Aimee Mann. maybe 
even before 'Til Tuesday had an album out. If you like her at all you 
should check this out, and if you never heard this band, they were 
one of Boston's best in the 1980's. this was the 1st time I ever 
heard them in a concert, and it seemed likely not to be the last.
fortunately it wasn't, I just regret never seeing them because they
were one of Boston's best local area bands in the 80's.
