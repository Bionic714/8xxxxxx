,XanderSploosh,2013-04-19T06:31Z,"I've also been looking for this to pop up since it's release. I bought the actual comic early today, but I prefer to read digital. Thank you!"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-19T14:18Z,"doomcare, no i don't.

XanderSploosh, you're welcome."
,JB2425,2013-04-19T15:44Z,Thank you so much! Greatly appreciate your timely addressing of requests also!
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-19T18:27Z,"oh no problem, when it's wednesday or thursday, it's fairly easy to post a new comic (as long as one of the scanning groups has released it)! it's sometimes much harder to find back issues from just a few years ago. thanks for saying thanks."
,ggaanneesshhaa,2013-04-19T19:12Z,"Dear Sir,

I'm one of your thousands of silent followers here in the Pirate Bay and once I found out your impressive ability to attend obscure requests (X-Men Forever Vol. 1 and Vol. 2, for example) I finally took the time to register only to ask you for a favor.

You see, I'm a fan of the X-Men comics, particularly those of the Claremont-Byrne era, so, I'd like to ask you to upload the Classic X-Men issues (#01-#110) or at least the X-Men Vignettes Vols. (#01 and #02).

What I like most of this series (excluding the original stories) is the art of John Bolton illustrating the usually mesmerizing backup stories written by Chris Claremont himself. 

I know Claremont did stopped to write those stories after a while, but these first ones alone have blown my mind when I first read them. And i recall there were a few sketches and wonderful Arthur Adams and Steve Lightle covers and pinups included that I'm sure it would also be a dream come true to many people around the world downloading all those 110 issues, particularly if scanned in good quality.

So, if by any chance I failed in making myself clear, since english is not my first (nor second) language, here are a few links to help you understand what I'm looking for:

Classic X-Men:

X-Men: Vignettes, Vol. 1 [Paperback]

X-Men: Vignettes, Vol. 2 [Paperback]
http://www.amazon.com/X-Men-Vignettes-Vol-Chris-Claremont/dp/0785117288

Thank you very much for your time and dedication sharing all those comics.

Excelsior!"

[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-19T23:05Z,"MemberJLA, i have posted Grimm Fairy Tales #83 here:  http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8390423

Steed and Mrs. Peel #6 was posted here by shipJ:  http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8336654/

Lone Ranger Snake of Iron #4 was posted here by shipJ:  http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7937697/

Lone Ranger #12 was posted here by shipJ:  http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7937697/

Lone Ranger #13 and #14 have been released but have not been scanned yet, as far as I can tell.

Green Hornet #34 and #35 have been released but have not been scanned yet, as far as I can tell. F.Y.I., as of #34 the title is renamed to Green Hornet Legacy."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-19T23:08Z,i had one of those wrong. the last link (lone ranger #12) should have been to this torrent:  http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8082403/
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-19T23:17Z,"ggaanneesshhaa, i can't deny your polite request.

however, it will take awhile to compile that series.

right now i've been collecting another requested series (ALF, from marvel's star comics). i have some other requests waiting. but i'll try to get it to classic x-men next week, perhaps monday?

i will probably collect the classic x-men issues that had new backup stories (john bolton did a great job on those). after classic x-men #1-45, it was renamed x-men classic and #45-110 are really just reprints with new cover art.

so to fill your request, i will probably do 2 torrents: 1. classic x-men and 2. x-men classic."
,MemberJLA,2013-04-20T04:24Z,"STFmaryville, thanks very much for the information and the links.

[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-20T23:24Z,"you're welcome! yeah if you check the 0-Day pack and the Hitlist Week packs, you'll find every new comic and all the back issue scans, respectively. that guy uploads everything he can find!"

I just want to personally thank you for extending such courtesy and patience to your downloading audience.

Your informative and friendly posts are a welcome addition to your excellent uploads.

I too am a fan of both ALF (got that TODAY, thanks!) and Classic X-Men.  At this rate I will have to dedicate a new hard drive:

Classic TV
New TV
Movies
(StarTrek)
Music
Comics!"
