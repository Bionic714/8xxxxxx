Translated into English for the first time, this book was written by the Elizabethan magus, Dr. John Dee in 1564. He explains his discovery of the monas, or unity underlying the universe, as seen in a hieroglyph or symbol. The monad is representative of the alchemic process and goal of the magus, who in partaking of the divine, achieves that gnostic regenerative experience of becoming God and thus furthering the redemption and transmutation of the worlds.
