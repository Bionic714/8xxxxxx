Lafayette Ronald Hubbard (March 13, 1911 ΓÇô January 24, 1986[2]), better known as L. Ron Hubbard was an American pulp fiction author and the founder of the Church of Scientology. After establishing a career as a writer, becoming best known for his science fiction and fantasy stories, he developed a self-help system called Dianetics.
Writers of the Future (WOTF) is a science fiction and fantasy story contest that was originated by L. Ron Hubbard in the early 1980s. Hubbard characterized the contest as a way of "giving back" to the field that had defined his professional writing life. The contest has no entry fee and is the highest-paying contest for amateur science-fiction and fantasy writers.
The winning stories are published in the yearly anthology L. Ron Hubbard Presents Writers of Future. The contest enjoys a favorable reputation in the science fiction community. The latest awards of WOTF 2013 are the 29th of the series.
I have scanned one of my older editions which most probably few of you must have read & which must be out of print after 25 years now! I have added bookmarks & internal links from TOC.
