,KelleyBates,2013-04-19T07:11Z,"doesnt itunes usually upload at least 256kbs though? anyways I hope this works, thank you."
,KelleyBates,2013-04-19T07:13Z,"Oh, it is 256kbps THANK YOU. Its not available in canada yet -_- That was one of the fastest downloads i have ever had."
,bobykarot,2013-04-19T07:17Z,It's just the leaked version from 04/17 ...
,bobykarot,2013-04-19T07:19Z,Oops sorry nevermind it's the good version ... It was supposed to be 6:00 mins long minimum ...
,CyPhErLoUs,2013-04-19T07:34Z,"You're welcome :)

Yeah I don't know why the full version wasn't released on iTunes. I'm guessing this is sort of a teaser for the real version later on.

If it does come out before the album i'll share that one too."
