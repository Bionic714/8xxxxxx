,WasAtWoodstock,2013-04-20T20:04Z,"Thanks. This is a convenient way to play almost five hours of the best of Stephan Stills across all the bands he was playing in. And it has all the art, properly cropped and named! And it has all the useful meta tags, including embedded art that exceeds the Apple 600x600 standard! Ideal for the high resolution smart phone and tablet displays.

The only changes I made were to remove Box Set from the album title. I didn't see ""Box Set"" on any of the included art. And since this technically is a VA, I used Tag&Rename to include the artist in the filenames.

Thanks again. If only all torrents were this well assembled..."
,TheScribe56,2013-04-21T00:26Z,"Vtwin, you're always coming up with these gems that I didn't even know existed.  I love these boxes sets where they pick the best version of a song, instead of giving you four subpar recordings of the same thing and letting you choose.  Just trying to pad the output.  "

,Coltbear50,2013-04-22T01:00Z,"Boy, does Stephen and Crosby, Nash and Young bring back a LOT of terrific memories - thanks very much for this, especially for the excellent quality (of ALL of your work.)  Who says ""You can't go home again?""  Much appreciated! "
