Stay at the fount, where the blessings pour out. Study what this means as we learn to keep ourselves in the love of God. Examine the ways we are drawn away from the overflowing fountain of blessing. Explore Old Testament pictures of New Testament truths, looking for the mercy of Jesus Christ, unto eternal life!
