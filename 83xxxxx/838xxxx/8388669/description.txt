Bible Study Jude taught by Brett Meador

Sound the alarm! That is exactly what Jude, one of the half-brothers of Jesus, aimed to do. In light of the alarm sounding, what should you do? Tonight, we are equipped with a perfect example of how to approach our spiritual battles, how to overcome the apostates. We have insight and admonition from the One who has won the victory! Greater is He that is in you, than he that is in the world.
