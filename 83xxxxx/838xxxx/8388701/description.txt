Bible Study 3 John taught by Brett Meador 

ΓÇ£I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.ΓÇ¥ Though he himself was a Son of Thunder, we learn tonight from one who has grown to be the Apostle of Love. Practical lessons are revealed as John calls three specific people by name. Read through 3 John with us, and be challenged to disciple others in Truth, be aware of those who reject the Truth, and be encouraged by those who walk in the Truth.
