This product is an artistic representation of the subject matter, which is inspired by the Pilatus PC-21. 
IRIS Flight Simulation Software does not endorse and is not endorsed by, Pilatus Aircraft or its owners.
 
The Pilatus PC-21 is a completely new training system developed to meet the requirements and expectations of modern air forces for the next 30 years; both in capability and life-cycle cost.
 
The PC-21 has better aerodynamic performance than any other turboprop trainer on the market.It is also supported by a more powerful, flexible and integrated training system than any other jet
or turboprop trainer but still has life-cycle support costs equal to current turboprop benchmarks.
 
The PC-21 is as benign and easy to fly for the ab initio student as it is challenging and satisfying for the advanced pilot preparing for the front line.
 
Equipped with a pressurised cockpit, air-conditioning, an anti-g system and on-board oxygen generation, the PC-21 provides a comfortable modern training environment.
 
The PC-21 is capable of sustained low-level speeds in excess of 320 knots; hydraulically-assisted ailerons and roll spoilers can produce fighter-like rates of roll in excess of 200 degrees per second.
