Pleasant children's fantasy in keeping with the taste of the time - it should appeal to people who liked Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. Most noted for being the last feature film of Michael Powell, also he is assisted by his trusty side-kick Emeric Pressburger. It's not a typical Powell film, but it's as much fun as his Tales of Hoffman or Sorcerer's Apprentice.

ROTTEN QUALITY, don't say I didn't warn you! This film seems to have been rescued from the garbage can, we're lucky it exists at all.
