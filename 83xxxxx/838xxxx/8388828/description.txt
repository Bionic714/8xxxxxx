I do not know if any of you guys know this, but in my younger years (teens actually) I did a little bit of fashion modeling. When I never grew past 5'7 by 19 years old I retired.

Anyway, so many of the Photographers Were such weirdos (Obviously not All Photographers are pompous A-holes LOL). Most are pretty cool. But, I thought it would be funny to try and direct Tyler to be a jerk (if you know him, you would see that he is actually one of the nicest guys on the planet; so his acting skills are really quite good here!) . I had to keep reminding him to be a jerk, the girls and I were cracking up the entire time! Also I HAD to Keep the Directing Girls to act like They did not want HIM (Because They both Thought he was really hot, Which he is ... and so are They).
