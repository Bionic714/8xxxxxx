,itsmej,2013-04-30T07:55Z,"@ladyboss52 girl i had same problem before. I've accidentally learned that you just need to update directX. Here's what i did, since i desperately wanna learn the game and i can't play this one, i went to bigfish site and downloaded the trial. After trial was installed, surprisingly another pop up came up on screen and it says about updating DirectX. I went thru the whole update process. So since i only have 60mins on trial, i uninstalled trial and then i installed this torrent which is the full version of game. Annnnd you're done. :)"
