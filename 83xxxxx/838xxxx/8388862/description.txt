Taken from:


The calmly-spoken-yet-ninja-like C0nc0rdancemade a good video (too good apparently) exposing some concerns about the Burzynskiii (oops, 2 unnecessary "i"s at the end there) Cliniccc (damn!).
The video got DMCAd, by someone almost certainly owning no copyright to the material used in the video, presumably to silence criticism of (almost certainly) one of the lowest forms of life in the more putrid parts of the pool.

If you wish to raise a middle finger on this occasion, spare fingers can be found here:
