,DeerEst,2013-05-08T14:41Z,"Patience is a virtue, but I'm curious if anyone can tell me why the series seems to have stopped dead? English at least. I'm not in the US, so not really sure what gets to air when etc.

Anyway, just making conversation in the lull between episodes ;)

Interesting series, thanks for the UL Dibya (^^)/
