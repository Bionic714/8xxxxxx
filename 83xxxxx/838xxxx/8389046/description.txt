Zay Harding explores the colonial history of the State of Victoria in Australia.

Starting in the Grampian Mountains, he meets the original inhabitants: the Aboriginal people. He then heads to the gold rush towns of Ballarat, Bendigo and Stawell, where he pans for gold, takes part in a Chinese Dragon Festival, and runs the country's most famous footrace - the Stawell Gift.

Zay cycles along the Great Ocean Road, taking in the famous Shipwreck Coast, before heading to  Melbourne to explore the city's grand Victorian arcades and architecture.

Then he heads back into bush country for the Ned Kelly trail, where he investigates the history of Australia's most notorious outlaw, from Kelly's birthplace in Beveridge to his place of execution at the Old Melbourne Gaol.

Finally, Zay explores the roots of the founding of a new country.
