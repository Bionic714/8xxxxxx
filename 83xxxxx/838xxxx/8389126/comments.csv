,ouchyfish,2013-04-20T19:49Z,"This movie is absolutely horrible. Nothing at all redeemable here. If you're looking for anything resembling a war movie, look elsewhere. if you're looking for anything resembling horror, look elsewhere. The whole movie is three retards running through the woods of Oregon stumbling into random encounters Final Fantasy style with Germans that have absolutely zero situational awareness. The plot was shit, the actors were stereotypical and boring, and the T+A they tried to include wasn't even done right so don't look for that here, either. This isn't even a movie so bad that it's funny. It's just absolute crap. The fags movie about the bag blowing around in ""American Beauty"" had more merit."

V - 9

The movie is a very low budget film, poor acting and effects. Wouldn't recommend."
