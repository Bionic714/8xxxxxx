What a delight for the young French saxophonist to be the leader of a quartet
with Lee Konitz on alto sax, Gary Peacock on bass and Paul Motian on drums. In
contrast to her relatively wild previous album "Shape", or her more adventurous
albums with "You Had Me At Hello", the playing here is quite accessible, but
without being mainstream: without actual soloing, the two saxes are engaged in
a continuous free dialogue of action and reaction, assent and dissent, with
bass and drums feeling equally comfortable in the open musical environment. The
music is extremely lyrical, very rhythmic, but without patterns or themes.

The sound quality of the recording is superb, easily illustrated by Peacock's
bass on "Petit Matin", which is absolutely stunning in its sensitive subtlety,
equalled by Grimaldi's soaring soprano.

Some of the more composed pieces have a more post-boppish character, and the
album would have had more unity without them. That notwithstanding, and without
really being adventurous, the album is a delight of intimate musical joy and
interplay.
