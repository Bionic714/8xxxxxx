,ndtoronto,2013-04-19T16:35Z,Amazing download speed.  Thanks guys!!!! Keep it up over the weekend
,pentwofour,2013-04-19T19:49Z,That naming mistake could be keeping us from a legitimate P2 upload. You could upload the real P2 to save face ;)
,IAMH67,2013-04-19T21:05Z,"Some other uploaders are going to be uploading FP2 today here very soon in 720p.

I will upload Qualifying tomorrow, the race on Sunday and maybe Practice 3 too. "

As a cable-less louch - stuck with horrible coverage in Canada, I truly truly appreciate it."
