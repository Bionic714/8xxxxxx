This wonderfully entertaining book also happens to be quite effective.
Everything any child will need to know about chess strategy and more is here in this book, which is well laid out and easy to follow.
Part of the fun factor for kids is that the book is replete with cartoon images of chess characters to help make the learning experience more exciting.
The main part of the book consists of 100 exercise sheets with nine diagrams each. The positions include forced checkmates, combinations that win material, defensive and general strategic problems, as well as endgames. The extensive solution pages give detailed analysis of both correct and incorrect moves. Important concepts are explained in clear and simple language.
