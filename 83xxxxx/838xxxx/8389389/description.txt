What's cool about it?

Set clever traps and lure your neighbour into them.
Plan your steps ahead not to get caught and win a prize in a wacky TV show.
Includes the original Neighbours From Hell and it's sequel Neighbours from Hell 2: On Vacation.

Living next door to you is a real Neighbour From Hell and it's now time to have your revenge! Creep around your neighbour's house performing ever more elaborate tricks upon the unsuspecting resident. As the star of a fantastic new TV show, cameras will track your every move as you set your fiendish traps. Your objectives are to create more and more disarray, increase ratings and maybe even win prestigious awards. But beware of watchful neighbours and alert guard dogs; if they catch you then the show will be taken off air.
And when your neighbour wants to enjoy an undeserved holiday - go with him. Sneak along onto a cruise liner to make the nasty neighbour's holiday a living hell. This time, the neighbour's mum has joined him, and she is taking good care of her baby. Get the neigh from hell into his mum's and fellow travellers' bad books, play tricks on him and give free reign to your vengeance.
