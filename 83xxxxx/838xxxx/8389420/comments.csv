,Devryl,2013-04-21T22:54Z,this torrent is busted. no matter what I do it just gives me some steam error in chinese.
,Jechtshot,2013-04-22T18:41Z,"It's not bugged out, your just a nub :X

That chinese worded warning only pops out when it detects you got steam client running in the background.

It's a warning, tell you to shutdown that steam client, so it can run the game, because it's using some sort of offline steam crack thingy, but can't do it with the original steam client running in the background.

It's version 0.51

cheathappens already has a trainer out for this beta game :X

instructions:

1. download
2. extract the folder to your pc
3. make sure steam client is turned off
4. go to the folder for the game you extracted and just run the LegendaryHeroes.exe launcher
5. enjoy the game, and help others by continuing to seed."

,FLAC-er,2013-04-24T02:36Z,@Angriff36 >> I had the same problem. just install Net Framework 4.5 and XNA Framework Redistributable 4.0.
