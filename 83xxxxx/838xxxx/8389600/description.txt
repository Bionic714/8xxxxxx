v2.2.0:
a. Tethering now functions correctly. Root applications and kernel must be enabled. Please read the app description for more information.
b. If you have a lot of apps on your SDCard, those apps, probably disappear from AF after a reboot. There is now a setting that changes that. This changes how the rules are applied after reboot. Please be aware that if you enable this option the firewall will be disabled until the Media Scanner is done scanning the SDCard.
