While studying in medical college Arun Kumar Mathur (Shashi Kapoor) has a misunderstanding over a love letter with Kavita Kapoor (Sadhana), and must leave the college, much to his dismay. Kavita later finds out that it was not Arun's fault, but Arun has already left town. Arun's marriage is arranged with Saroj Chowdhary (Seema Deo), who also happens to be a distant relative of Kavita. When Arun loses his vision in an accident, Saroj is unable to go to take care of him, and Kavita takes her place. Unwilling to reveal her identity, Kavita let's him think it is Saroj, not her. She learns that he still hates and despises her. Soon it will be time to take bandages off his eyes, and he will be able to see again, much to the dread of Kavita.
